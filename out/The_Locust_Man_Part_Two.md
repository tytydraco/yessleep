When you stare too long into what feels like an endless sea of brown and green, your eyes can begin to play tricks on you. Even the most rational person could find their imagination beginning to run wild. The forest almost feels like it consumes you, and for some, it truly does. 

Hundreds of people go missing every year while exploring forests- even in national parks with well established and frequently used trails. Everything can start to look exactly the same when you’re in the middle of the woods. You could be walking in a giant circle and not even realize it. Many unfortunate folks have gone off-trail for one reason or another, only to never make it back to that trail. 

Our patch of woods wasn’t tiny by any means, but we figured it couldn’t be *that* big, because we knew where all the borders of it were. We assumed it didn’t go too far past the mine, as the terrain there became more rocky as it rose in elevation. To the left was the old highway, and to the right was the next neighborhood over. 

The old men in town loved to tell horror stories of our woods, passed down from generation to generation. As part of our upbringing, we’d heard them all. Tales of miners who went missing in those woods while on their way to or from work, never to be seen again. Countless deaths that had occurred in the mine as a result of the dangerous working conditions. The mutilated bodies that had been discovered over the years, deemed as animal attacks. The missing girls. And, of course, the “Great Disaster of 1902”. 

When we made it back to the mine, and with it the trail, I found myself hesitant to walk past the entrance. I still couldn’t completely shake the feeling that we were being chased by something down there, even though logically, I knew we weren’t. Anything that might have been wouldn’t have stopped its pursuit just because we exited the mine. *Right?* Mikey unknowingly provided me with a much welcomed distraction by making a joke. 

“Hey Dev! Why don’t you go back in there and grab your flashlight? We’ll wait right here for you, buddy!”  

“Pshh, whatever. Shut up dude.” Devin scoffed, as Lacey and I giggled. 

“Was The Locust Man in th-th-there?” Michelle asked. 

“Yep, sure was.” Devin replied. “He was big and scary, too! And he tried to eat us!!” 

She gasped and looked at me, to which I silently shook my head and smiled, gesturing for her to keep walking. I turned and peered into the darkness pouring from the mouth of the mine once more, as we embarked on our journey back toward civilization. And, hopefully, with Mikey and Devin’s curiosity fully satiated.

As we traveled onward, I began inspecting the abrasions I’d received from running through all of that brush like a lunatic. I was still so ticked off about Lacey screaming like she was being murdered out there. I had warned her about those damn shoes, too. I was also annoyed with Michelle for not listening to me when I told her not to move. Actually, it was pretty safe to say that at that point I was pissed off at all of them, because the boys had been the ones behind this entire idiotic plan in the first place. 

“So, how exactly are we supposed to cross the creek now, with Devin carrying Lacey?” I asked. 

Mikey turned around and said,

“Hmm, I dunno… she might have to just hop all the way across on her one good foot!” 

“Uh, you guys, I’m plenty strong enough to cross with her on my back. It’s not gonna be a problem.” Devin defended. 

“Yeah, well… it’s not just about strength, it’s about balance too.” I pointed out. 

“Guess we’ll just have to *’cross that creek’* when we get to it, eh?” 

I rolled my eyes as Devin laughed at his own stupid joke. As we continued on, we silently reflected on all the events that had just transpired in the last hour. Or at least, *I did*. In my mind, I began working to analyze and, hopefully, rationalize those sounds we had heard. The banging noise was obviously more explainable. As with age, things can just naturally deteriorate to the point of falling down. But as for that other sound… I was having difficulty just trying to find the correct adjectives to describe it, let alone a logical theory on its source. The closest thing I could come up with was that it almost sounded like rusty metal gears grinding against each other, but with a simultaneous reverberation. As if whatever was moving closer to us and making the screeching sound was also vibrating congruently. 

*Maybe it was some sort of pulley system that had gotten knocked around by the support beam falling. But then, why would it have sounded like it was quickly getting closer and closer to us, then stop like that so suddenly? Like, very suddenly… too suddenly… almost as if it were in response to my voice?*

I tried to convince myself that had to be a coincidence, though. That all of those strange sounds were just random old junk falling apart down there, and we were lucky to have made it out without getting hurt. Then, I managed to step away from my thoughts just in time to notice something troubling… we had been walking long enough that I felt like we should have gotten to the fallen tree by now. Reflexively, I looked down at my watch, forgetting it was broken, only to discover… it wasn’t?

*2:04 PM*

Not only had it started working again, it seemed to have somehow caught itself up to the current time. Unless… it hadn’t stopped at all? Maybe I had been mistaken somehow- so much crazy shit had happened by that point, I honestly couldn’t say for sure. I didn’t get a chance to tell anyone my watch had stopped working either, so with no one to corroborate my story, I tried to just shrug that off, too. 

Besides, it just didn’t make any sense. If my watch *had* stopped, then somehow randomly started again, it would be showing a time much earlier, and 2:00 seemed about right to me. Considering all the stress brought on by the previous events, though, it’s entirely possible my perception of time was skewed. I mean, when you’re scared, a minute can feel like forever. But all of that had to be put to the side, as I now had more pressing questions in my mind to answer. 

*Why hadn’t we reached the fallen tree yet? Had the woods… shifted on us? Had time??* 

My ridiculous racing thoughts were interrupted by Lacey asking,

“Uhhh Mikey… how much further is the tree?”

*Oh thank God, I’m not the only one who noticed*

“Should be coming up on it anytime now.”

“Oh please Mikey, cut the crap!” Lacey snapped. 

I stepped in before another argument could ensue, and said, 

“Seriously Mikey, we really *should have* gotten to it by now.” 

At that, he stopped and turned around. 

“Oh really? How do you know? Hmm? Did you time us on the way here?”

“No… I only checked my watch when we went inside the mine.” I admitted, purposely leaving out the part about my sense of time being less than reliable at the present moment. 

“Mikey, are we lost???” Michelle whined urgently while tugging on his camo jacket. 

He didn’t answer her, he just swatted her hands away and shot her an angry look, then looked back at me.

“Well, then you can’t say for sure then, can you, Ms. Know-it-all?” 

Devin pointed at me and laughed, and I think that made Mikey feel bad about his comment. That, along with the facial expression I had made in response to it. He looked down at Michelle and asserted that we were not lost, then he approached me. 

“Look, let’s just keep going for 10 more minutes, okay? It’s gotta be right up there. We must have just gotten back on the trail a little further down than we thought. Trust me, okay? I know these woods better than anyone.”

He did have a point. I suddenly recalled that when we got back on the trail, I glanced back to see if the fallen tree was visible behind us, and it wasn’t. The trail wasn’t exactly a straight shot though, and with all the dense overgrowth obstructing my view anyway, I wasn’t really worried about it at the time. *Now I was.* I clenched my teeth. 

“Okay fine, but *just* 10 more minutes.” I agreed. 

He smiled at me, then tuned to Devin and said,

“Alright dude, 10 minutes! Count it down!”

I started to say that I could just keep track with my watch, when Devin interrupted me with a robotic ‘one-one thousand, two-one thousand, three-one thousand’. It only took until the sixth sequence of Devin’s obnoxious counting technique for us to all realize at once that we were *not* going to see that fallen tree. Because instead, what lie before us was a break in the tree line with the trail coming to an abrupt end, and the highway beyond it. 

No one said a word. They all turned around to look at me, to which I shrugged, held up my hands, and said, 

“I’m not gonna say it.”

I felt an odd satisfaction from being right, even though being right meant we had just spent the last 15 minutes walking the wrong direction. The highway ran the length of the woods on the *western* border, and we should have been heading *south* to get home. Mikey had been so confident we were going the right way that he hadn’t bothered to check his compass again until this moment. Unbeknownst to all of us, the trail had turned and veered off west. And suddenly, it all started to make sense to me. I looked at Mikey with an air of superiority, and all he had to say for himself, while looking absolutely defeated, was,

“Shit.”

“Yeah, shit indeed.” I said, snatching the compass out of his hands. “We must have walked too far after we crossed that damn creek the first time. We ended up on a totally different trail, Mikey!”

I held the compass out in front of me, made a quarter turn to the left and squinted through the trees, trying to locate a clearing in that area. 

“Look, I didn’t even know there was more than one trail out here. None of us did!” He tried to defend himself. 

“Oh yeah?” I laughed, then turned to look him in the eyes. “Because I’m pretty sure I remember you saying you know these woods better than anyone.” 

He just glared at me. 

“Wait, you guys… instead of trying to find the original trail again, why don’t we just follow the highway home? Can’t get lost that way.” Lacey posed to the group. 

“We’re *not* lost.” Mikey angrily asserted. 

“Not anymore.” I said with a smirk. 

Devin groaned,

“Alright, all you need to hurry up and decide what we’re doing, cuz Lacey ain’t getting any lighter.” 

She smacked him in the back of the head, and he pretended to lose his grip on her, causing her to scream dramatically. I looked back towards the thicket, then down at my scratched up arms, and at Lacey’s now swollen and purple ankle. Michelle complained that she needed to pee. I knew that Mikey wouldn’t want to accept the defeat of not successfully navigating us back the way we came, but all things considered, this was looking like the better and safer option. He knew it. I turned to him, and trying to give him the courtesy of still addressing him as our leader, I asked, 

“Might honestly just be easier to take the highway. What’d you think?”

He glance at me briefly, giving me a covert half-smile, then stoically replied, 

“Highway it is.”

The moment we emerged from the woods, I felt an immediate sense of relief, as if the clutches of some unseen malicious force had lost its grasp on me. At that point I was exhausted, thirsty, and *beyond* ready for the entire experience to be over with. We positioned ourselves into single file formation, and using the small patch of grass between the road and the woods, we headed left, back toward town. 

Now, this particular highway wasn’t the typical ‘four lanes with a median’ type of highway you may be thinking of; we called it the *old* highway for a good reason. It was basically just a regular two-lane straight shot road full of potholes, that once upon a time was the only highway that passed through our town. The interstate had been built in the 70s, and with it being much more convenient and nicer, no one really used this one anymore- which is why after we encountered our first passing car after having been walking a good 15 minutes, we all looked up. 

It was an older model black Chevy SUV, heading southbound. After it passed us, the taillights lit up, and it came to a sudden stop about 50 feet away from us, subsequently causing us to do the same. The SUV lingered in the middle of the road momentarily, then slowly made a u-turn into the northbound lane and began creeping in our direction. 

“Who is that?” Lacey asked. 

Mikey tightened his grip on the BB gun, and replied,

“I don’t know. Let’s just keep walking.” 

But I couldn’t. My eyes were glued to the SUV, now accelerating towards us, and my legs locked up and refused to move. I broke visual contact with the SUV long enough to gauge the distance from where we were standing to the tree line, because at that moment a terrible thought had entered my mind. 

*We can’t all get kidnapped if we scatter.*

Then, all at once, the reality of our situation hit me. Lacey couldn’t even walk right now, let alone run. Devin definitely couldn’t get away fast enough while carrying her. Mikey would be slowed down by Michelle. The only one with any real chance of getting away… was me. Every single muscle in my body tensed up as I prepared to make a run for it. The brakes of the SUV squealed as it slowed to a stop right beside us, and a voice rang out from the open passenger side window. 

“What in the hell are you kids doing out here?!”

I peered into the SUV and saw a large older man with dark hair, wearing a white t-shirt full of grease stains. It was the guy who ran the diner downtown. We all knew who he was, so he wasn’t exactly a *stranger*, but I was still hesitant to let my guard down. 

“We were just playing in the woods, sir. Lacey hurt her ankle, so we’re headed back home now.” Mikey answered for all of us. 

“Aw, well, come on then, get in. I’ll give you all a ride back to town.” The man offered. 

In true airhead fashion, Devin excitedly accepted, without giving it even a fraction of a thought. Sure, he was tired of carrying Lacey, but we didn’t know this man very well at all. At best he was just a nice guy trying to help us out, but at worst, we could all end up chained in his basement. Maybe it wasn’t that common for kids my age to think the way I thought, but I expected him to have a little more survival instinct than that, so I covertly tapped his arm. Seeing that, Mikey stepped forward and interjected. 

“Actually, sir, our street’s not much further from here. We wouldn’t want to trouble you. We appreciate the offer, though.” 

“Oh, it’s no trouble at all, already headed that way. Hey- aren’t you Joseph’s boy?” The man asked him. 

“Yes sir”

“Well, if your pops found out I let you and your buddies walk home on the side of the road, he’d kick my ass!”

Mikey forced out an awkward laugh and said,

“Fair enough. I guess you can just drop us off at the beginning of Rain Street then, Mister…”

“Just Slim, no ‘Mister’.”

I was slightly comforted by the fact that Mikey’s dad really *would* break every bone in the man’s body if he even so much as laid a finger on any one of us. Devin called shotgun as we moved closer to the SUV. He opened the back door and turned around to let Lacey down, but while he was doing so, Mikey shot past him and hopped into the front seat, yelling, 

“Spot jack!”

“Hey!!!” Devin protested. 

*Good. If things take a turn for the worst, last thing we need is that dumbass sitting up front.*

We all piled in. I sat next to Lacey in the backseat, behind the driver’s side, and Devin and Michelle were in the third row. Slim told us to buckle up as he whipped the SUV around back towards town. It smelled like cigarettes and old French fries. Empty crushed cans of various sodas and Papst Blue Ribbon littered the floorboards. After a few moments of fiddling with the radio, he settled on a station playing Incubus; I guess he was trying to find something we’d consider cool. 

I leaned forward and looked him over, his belly slightly pressing up against the steering wheel. I thought it was pretty ironic everyone called him Slim, because he was anything *but*. I’d later find out that it had been his nickname long before he bought the diner, and even though over the years he’d lost the physique, the name just stuck. He seemed old to me at the time, but looking back at it, he was probably around the same age I am now. Funny how much time can change your perception of things. 

Finally, Slim broke the awkward silence with a very pointed question that caught us all off guard. 

“So, did you guys find the abandoned mine?”

“What?” Mikey replied.   

*How did he know that?*

Slim chuckled.

“You all think you’re the first kids to go out there? Ha! Don’t worry though, not gonna tattle. Hell, I went out there looking it for quite a few times myself when I was around your age. If you think Trillium is boring now, just try to imagine how bad it was in the 80s before we had cell phones and internet…”

As Slim went on and on about how life was back in his day, and how he and his friends started hanging out in the woods as little kids, and how even in high school they’d still go out there to throw beer pong parties, I started to zone out. Instead, I focused my attention outside of the window, watching for our turn. When I see it coming up, my eyes dart to his blinker to make sure he hits it. He does. I sat back a bit in my seat, and then I heard Slim say something that instantly pulled me back into the conversation. 

“… and there were no birds in the woods that day. It was weird, like they all had flown away or something, man. Crazy right? So then, my buddy Jeremy convinced us all to stop setting up for the party and try to go look for the mine again. And we actually found it that time! Couldn’t really see anything though, too dark. God, it smelled foul in there too, man. Well, anyways, here’s your street!”

We all looked around at each other as the SUV slowed to a stop. A few minutes ago, I couldn’t *wait* to get out of there and get home, but now… I didn’t want to move. 

“Well, thanks for the ride.” Mikey said, as we all began exiting. 

Devin helped Lacey onto his back, and I held Michelle’s hand and helped her down onto the step bar. Before I closed the door, I leaned back inside, pretending I had forgotten something on the seat. Slim turned around to look back at me. Quietly, I asked him, 

“Hey, so did you hear any like, noises or anything inside the mine?” 

His innocuous smile quickly transitioned into a scowl. 

“No.”

That’s all he said. No further explanation, no follow-up questions, no surprise that I had even asked. In fact, he seemed to have gotten *angry* at the mere mention of it. I pressed my lips together, nodded, and shut the door. He was lying, 100%. There wasn’t a doubt in my mind that he had heard something in there, just as we had. Something that terrified him, and defied explanation. And for some reason, something that he harbored a lot of anger toward, apparently. 

I caught up to the others, who had already started down the road. No one said a single word during our entire walk back home. We arrived at Lacey’s first and waited for her to limp inside. Devin’s house was next. He and Mikey fist-dabbed before we moved on to my house, a little further down the road. As I stepped onto my porch, I could hear my dog Koda from inside, excitedly barking over my return home. I turned around and gave a quick smile to Mikey, who nodded. I waved at Michelle, then turned and hurried inside, locking the door behind me. I looked down at my watch. 

*2:52 PM*

I walked to the kitchen to get some water, and my mom was in there, loading the dishwasher. As she began her regularly scheduled interrogation of me, I glanced over at the clock on the microwave. 

*2:52 PM*

That night, I laid awake in bed for a long time, trying to fully process everything. There had been just *way* too many strange occurrences that I wasn’t able to rationalize, no matter which avenue of thinking I attempted to navigate. I didn’t tell my mom anything about what had happened that day, because even though I wasn’t exactly *eager* to go back into those woods again, I still wanted the freedom of choice. I just had way too many questions with no real answers to pair them with, and I knew my mind would never be able to settle until it closed those gaps.
