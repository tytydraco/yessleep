I need to tell someone about what happened at the Hendricks place. The cops won't listen—said there's no evidence of foul play, just another family that packed up and left in the night. But I know better. I was their mailman for three years, and families don't just vanish like that. Not families like the Hendricks.

Timber Creek Road stretches twelve miles through pine forest before it dead-ends at their property. I'd driven that route every Tuesday and Friday, my mail truck bouncing over the potholes that never got fixed because the county forgot about roads that far out. Most days, I'd see maybe two other vehicles the entire trip. It was the kind of isolation that city folk romanticize until they actually experience it.

The Hendricks had moved out there two summers ago—Mike, Sarah, and their twin boys, probably eight or nine years old. Nice enough family. Mike worked remotely for some tech company, and Sarah homeschooled the kids. They'd wave from their porch when I pulled up, always polite when they signed for packages. The boys would sometimes run to the truck, curious about mail delivery in a way that reminded me why I liked this job.

Their house sat at the end of a gravel driveway, surrounded by about forty acres of pine and oak. Beautiful property, really. The kind of place where you could hear your own thoughts. But there was something about that last quarter-mile of road that always made me uncomfortable. The trees grew thick on both sides, their branches forming a tunnel that blocked out most of the sky. Even on sunny days, that stretch felt dim and close.

The first sign something was wrong came in early October. I pulled up to find their mailbox knocked clean off its post, lying in the tall grass beside the road. The metal was dented like something heavy had hit it. I walked over to examine it closer and noticed claw marks scraped deep into the aluminum. Long gouges, too big for a dog or even a bear. I'd lived in these woods my whole life, and I'd never seen marks like that.

I carried their mail up to the house and knocked. Sarah answered, but she looked different. Thinner. Dark circles under her eyes like she hadn't slept in weeks. When I mentioned the mailbox, she just stared at me for a long moment.

"We'll get it fixed," she said finally, but her voice sounded hollow.

"You folks doing alright out here?" I asked.

She glanced over her shoulder into the house, then stepped outside and pulled the door shut behind her. "Have you noticed anything strange on the road lately? When you're driving out here?"

"Strange how?"

"Sounds. Movement in the trees. Things that shouldn't be there."

I told her I hadn't, which was mostly true. There had been odd moments—shadows that seemed to shift wrong, sounds that didn't match any animal I knew—but nothing I could put my finger on.

"The boys keep saying they see something watching the house at night," she whispered. "Mike thinks it's just their imagination, but..." She trailed off, wrapping her arms around herself despite the warm day.

I wanted to ask more, but Mike appeared in the doorway behind her.

"Everything okay out here?" His voice carried an edge I hadn't heard before.

"Just talking about the mailbox," Sarah said quickly.

Mike nodded, but his eyes stayed fixed on the tree line. "We'll take care of it."

I left them a new mailbox the following Tuesday. When I pulled up, I could see someone had already dug a fresh hole and set a new post. But as I mounted the box, I noticed something that made my skin crawl. The trees around their property had been marked. Not by any tool—these were the same claw marks I'd seen on the old mailbox, scraped into bark about seven feet off the ground. They formed a rough circle around the clearing where the house sat.

The Hendricks weren't outside that day. Their car was in the driveway, but the house felt empty somehow. All the curtains were drawn. I knocked, but nobody answered. I could hear sounds from inside—muffled voices, maybe the television—but no one came to the door.

Over the next few weeks, the mail started piling up. Packages sat on their porch, unopened. Bills and letters filled their box until I had to rubber-band them together. I'd knock each time, call out, but never got an answer. Their car never moved from its spot in the driveway.

Then came the night I had to work late, sorting packages for the next day's route. It was past nine when I finally headed home, and I decided to drive by their place on my way. Maybe I'd see lights, some sign they were okay.

The road felt different in the dark. My headlights carved a narrow tunnel through the blackness, and the trees seemed to press closer on both sides. About halfway to their house, I had to slam on the brakes.

Something was standing in the middle of the road.

At first, I thought it was a person. It had the rough shape of one—two legs, a torso, something that might have been a head. But as my eyes adjusted, I realized how wrong that first impression was. It was too tall, maybe eight feet. Its limbs were too long, joints bending at angles that didn't match human anatomy. And its skin—if you could call it skin—had a wet, glistening quality that reflected my headlights.

It turned toward my truck, and I saw its face.

I can't describe it properly. The features were almost human but stretched and distorted, like someone had tried to sculpt a person from memory and gotten all the proportions wrong. Its eyes were too large, too dark, and they held an intelligence that was both alien and terrifyingly familiar.

We stared at each other for what felt like hours but was probably only seconds. Then it opened its mouth—a hole that split its face too wide—and made a sound I'll never forget. Not quite a scream, not quite words, but something that made every nerve in my body fire at once.

It stepped off the road and disappeared into the trees with a fluid motion that nothing that size should have been able to manage.

I sat there shaking for several minutes before I could make myself drive forward. When I reached the Hendricks' driveway, I could see their house was completely dark. But there were shapes moving around it—tall figures circling the building with that same unnatural gait I'd witnessed on the road.

I didn't stop. I floored it past their driveway and didn't slow down until I reached the main highway.

The next morning, I called the sheriff's office. Deputy Collins drove out with me to check on the family. The house was empty. Not just unoccupied—empty. All their furniture was gone, their belongings vanished. The only signs they'd ever lived there were some scratches on the hardwood floors where furniture had been dragged and a few crayon drawings the boys had left on their bedroom walls.

"Looks like they cleared out in a hurry," Collins said, examining the house. "Probably got tired of living so far from everything."

But I knew better. Families don't pack up every stick of furniture and disappear overnight, especially not with mail still sitting in their box. And families definitely don't leave those kinds of claw marks scraped into every door frame, or that smell—sweet and rotten, like fruit left too long in the sun.

The house has been empty for two months now. The county's trying to figure out what happened to the Hendricks, but their investigation is going nowhere. No forwarding address, no contact with relatives, no trace of where they went. It's like they never existed.

But I know they existed, because I still have to drive past their place twice a week. The mailbox I installed is gone now—torn clean off its post again. The claw marks on the trees have spread, carved deeper into the bark. And sometimes, when I'm driving that last stretch of road, I catch glimpses of movement in my peripheral vision. Tall shapes moving between the trees, keeping pace with my truck.

I've put in for a transfer to a different route, but they're processing it slowly. Government bureaucracy, they say. In the meantime, I still have to make that drive.

The worst part is the sounds. They start about a mile before I reach the empty house—scratching noises from the forest, like claws on bark. Like something marking its territory. The sounds follow me all the way to the dead end and back, a constant reminder that I'm not alone on Timber Creek Road.

I don't know what happened to the Hendricks family. But I know they didn't just move away. And I know that whatever took them is still out there, waiting in the woods at the end of that lonely road.

The county's already talking about selling the property. Some city family will probably buy it, drawn by the isolation and the beauty of all those trees. They'll move in thinking they've found paradise, far from the noise and crowds of town.

I hope I'm wrong about what's waiting for them out there.

But I know I'm not.
