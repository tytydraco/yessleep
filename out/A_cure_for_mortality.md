That’s what we called it at first, a cure, a miracle even. I just never knew how wrong we were. My name is Dr. Martin Holloway, and this letter serves as both my admission of guilt and apology to all that will soon fall victim to my creation.

It all started with my research. My team and I were studying the regenerative abilities of various marine life: axolotls, starfish, and others you’re probably unfamiliar with. You see, our goal was to find a way to harness these creatures’ healing abilities and apply it to mankind. The idea was to create a serum that, when injected, would allow a patient to heal from an otherwise fatal or crippling injury. There would be no more amputees, no more paralysis. A simple shot was all it would take to be whole again.

And in a sick way, that’s exactly what we did.

It took years of research and development, but we finally isolated the genome that allows aquatic life to regenerate. And after an extensive round of animal tests, we were ready for human trials. Our first subject was Mr. John Davis, a veteran of the Global War on Terror. You see, Mr. Davis was eager to try our cure, having lost both of his legs after stepping on an IED.

The results were so much more than we could ever have hoped for.

One week after receiving the shot his legs had grown back. Then during the second week, he walked for the first time in years. And if that wasn’t incredible enough, the aftermath was even more so.

See, the serum seemed to target the worst injuries at first, but after Mr. Davis’s limbs grew back, it moved to the less serious ailments. By week three, he no longer needed to wear glasses. On week four, every scar and blemish on his body just… vanished. And that’s when we realized, we hadn’t just cured this man of his amputations. We’d cured him of everything.

And like every breakthrough in medicine, we wanted to see just how far we could take it. We brought in subjects with every horrendous condition known to man. Brain cancer, no problem. Stage four cirrhosis of the liver, gone in a few days. Missing limbs grew back. Broken spines reattached. There was no end to our cure. Hell, we even had one girl who let us cut her arm a month after her injection, just so we could watch her flesh sew itself back together.

Then, we took it a step further, going as far as surgically removing the limb of one of our patients. And just like we’d anticipated, it grew back in just under a day.

We reveled in our success, patting ourselves on the back and dreaming of the possibilities. With our cure, there would be no more illnesses. No need for doctors or nurses or any kind of medical care in the world.

We should have realized then that it was a fantasy.

When the government learned of our successful trials, they seized our research and demanded that our cure remain at their discretion. We fought and screamed, but when the black vans pulled up and the armed guards walked in, we submitted.

And that’s where it all started going wrong.

The first test they conducted was on a group of soldiers, low ranking and unaware. They took the shot at their leader’s command without so much as a question to what it was. See, the idea was to create soldiers that could survive the horrors of war, regardless of their injuries. A warrior who’d been injected with our cure need only wait until the wounds had closed, then they’d be back in the fight.

And you might be thinking, *well that’s not so bad, is it?* Let me finish first.

The government read our research, watched our trials, but that wasn’t enough. They needed to be sure. So, they packed all the indoctrinated soldiers onto an osprey and proceeded to crash it. We could do nothing but watch.

The men screamed from the burning wreckage. Some were impaled by debris, piercing their skulls and chests. Several men were so burnt you could hardly tell they were ever human. Still, the seared chunks of writhing flesh screamed from inside the fire. Each one was brought back to our facility, very much alive and under strict orders to be given zero medical care.

We monitored the almost corpses for days, watching as their bodies rebuilt themselves fiber by fiber. And to our horror, no one perished from the crash. It took about a week, then they all recovered as if nothing had ever happened. Like their mutilation had been nothing more than a bad dream.

And that’s how Project Mortality started.

Our formula was mass produced and given as a one-time vaccine to every member of the armed forces. With our cure, there was no need for armor. With our cure, there would be no more widowed wives or orphaned children. Soldiers could run out on the battlefield, unafraid of losing their lives, because no matter how much damage was done, they would heal.

And it all would have worked, if not for one fatal flaw. Our serum only targeted the body, healing wounds that should never have been able to be mended. But it did nothing for the mind.

The pain these men and women were feeling was real. Try burning to a crisp for ten minutes, then healing for days in the filth of some foreign desert. Try having your legs blown off again and again, knowing that each time they regrew would be another opportunity to have them removed again. Do you think you could handle that? No? Well, neither could they.

We sent wave after wave of these men and women onto foreign shores, watching them get blown apart, regenerating for days on end in piles of their own flesh. Each time they rose anew, their minds fractured further. And each time they fell, a little more of their mind slipped away.

And that’s how the breakdown began.

See, these people started to forget who they were, what they were. They stopped attacking the enemies of foreign nations and turned their attention to the entities that put this curse upon them. But that wasn’t enough. Each tested individual couldn’t fathom the idea of others living a life without our cure. And so, the hunt began.

They slaughtered us in droves, unopposed, and unyielding. We tried to fight, tried like hell. But it didn’t matter, nothing we did could ever stop them. It’s my fault that it came to this. We should never have tried to play God. Some wounds just aren’t meant to be healed.

I’m writing this from inside a bunker in Washington D.C. I can hear them above me, searching for a way in. It won’t be much longer now.

So, if you’re reading this[, ]()please heed my warning.

Run or hide.

There is no fighting them.

They are coming.

I’m so sorry.
