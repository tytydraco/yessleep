When it comes to hags, they're a bit of a mixed bag. Some are revered for their wisdom while others are able to be tricked by two little German children into getting inside of their own ovens. Whether they’re smart or stupid, one thing they all seem to have in common is the capacity to harness immense power. 

The Cookie Hag appeared to be no exception to this. As such, the boss determined that it would be too dangerous for either organization to deal with her alone. As such, he invited the Hunters to meet with us to discuss how to proceed. 

To my surprise, Iolo had agreed to it. 

(If you're not familiar with what Orion Pest Control's services are, it may help to start [here.)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/OpNHnxiz8U)

When the boss announced this meeting before the Wild Hunt arrived, Cerri and Wes had two very different reactions. Cerri blinked at us, calmly asking if we had an extra hagstone laying around. At that point, we didn't, but Deirdre was on a mission to remedy that. As such, our newest employee announced that she would be hanging next to Reyna during the meeting. 

Wes, on the other hand, seemed a little excited. For whatever reason, he's been fixing to fight the Hunters, Iolo in particular. I can understand wanting to smack the mechanic in the face, but coming from someone that spars with him daily, doing so is much easier said than done. While I don't doubt that Wes would be able to handle himself better than a human could… we didn't need any workplace casualties. Especially since we just hired the guy.  

He promised he'd ‘be good’ during the meeting but his smile was telling a completely different story. 

Victor gave him The Glare, telling him flatly, “You're staying by me the whole time.”  

“I'm *not* going to do anything.” Wes defended himself. 

“I don't trust you! *Get over here!*”

The Dubnos Towing truck pulled up first. The moment she saw it, Reyna slowly slid down into her chair as if trying to disappear. A few seconds later, that familiar blue truck joined it. The two Hunters stopped to chitchat in the parking lot as they waited on their third. 

Eyes huge as she watched the two jagoffs share a laugh about something, Cerri whispered, “It's one thing to read about them, but it's another thing to *see* them, you know?”

Wes tested his luck by leaning a little too far from where Vic could grab him if he tried to get aggressive. He commented, “Nessa, you weren't kidding about Briar looking like a Tik Toker.”

“Get your ogling out now,” Victor said. “Because when they walk in, they're most likely going to try to get into your heads. You're going to want to avoid eye contact as much as possible.”

The Huntress finally showed up in a white van emblazoned with McLeod Electric on the side. She didn't have her dogs with her this time. 

Iolo waltzed in first, all smiles, in stark contrast to Victor, who looked like he'd rather be pulling out his own fingernails than hosting this meeting. In all honesty, I was just as enthusiastic as the boss was, after my last encounter with the mechanic. I know Deirdre couldn't feel it, but the sight of his fingers moving *under* her skin had haunted me for days afterwards. 

When he tried to introduce himself to Cerri, subtly trying to catch her eye, she stared at the floor, politely saying, “Nice to meet you, but I don't have a name to give you.”

“Leave her alone,” I told him, stepping between them. “We’re supposed to be working together.”

He snickered, “Relax, Fiona! Just makin’ nice.”

*Yeah, sure you are. Asshole.*

Thankfully, he did back off. From that point on, Cerri didn't dare take her eyes off of the ground. 

Initially, he didn't acknowledge Wes whatsoever, despite the vampire openly glowering at him. Victor noticed and gave his newest employee a harsh nudge, which didn't escape Briar's notice. 

The Hunter sneered, looking Wes up and down, “Someone needs housebroken, it seems.”

“Not the time.” The Huntress reminded him curtly, crossing her arms as she regarded us with cold eyes. 

Iolo smirked, giving Briar a smack on the shoulder before helping himself to one of the donuts we set out, “Save the dick measuring contest for later, boys. We got business to attend to.”

Victor agreed, "Yes, we do.”

I started off what was going to be a long discussion with, “Right off the bat, I need to be bait, since the Cookie Hag will only be expecting me. If she thinks I'm going to accept her offer, she'll sit still. At least, she did when the Weeper and I met with her that first time.”

Iolo's eyes narrowed slightly when I passively brought Deirdre up, but he had the self-control not to interrupt. 

I continued, “I don't know if she'd be smart enough to know if I brought a decoy. My mom did trick her with a gumdrop, after all. But we only have one shot at this and with what she did to the False Tree, I don't want to take any chances.”

Iolo thoughtfully picked a sprinkle off of his donut, saying, “Willin’ to spare somethin’. But I expect it back in one piece.”

“So where does that leave the rest of us?” Reyna dared to ask. 

“Y'all just get the hag in one spot, we'll take care o’ the rest.” The mechanic replied nonchalantly. 

“And if you guys can't handle it?” Wes challenged, earning The Glare from Victor once again. 

With a snort, Briar responded, “Sounds suspiciously like you're trying to start something, boy.”

“What my colleague is *trying* to say,” Victor replied, giving Wes another stern look. “Is that the hag shouldn't be taken lightly by any of us. We all saw the devastation she can cause.”

The Huntress finally spoke up, addressing me, “Dog of Orion, did you notice any weaknesses in particular during your visit with the witch?”

For the record, I still hate that that's their nickname for me. 

“She was vulnerable to the Weeper’s hagstone.” I answered, internally bristling. “Her enchantment over me broke in its presence.”

The mechanic nodded slowly, considering, “Might be best for y'all to join us after all. Salt and hagstones don't really agree with us much.” 

“We should take care of this sooner rather than later.” Victor suggested. 

Iolo smirked at him, “And here I was thinkin’ we'd never agree on anything!”

“Likewise,” Victor replied stiffly. “Tonight work for you?”

“Sure does!”

From there, plans were developed further. To summarize, I was to bring the fiddle into the forest to draw the witch out. The Wild Hunt would do what they do best and track me down with the other Orion employees in tow, armed with as much salt and whatever hagstones Deirdre could obtain. Once we were done, we’d reconvene at the mechanic’s shop. And if we got separated somehow, that was our established meeting spot. 

All in all, it went better than I'd thought it would. 

When the mechanic brought me out to his truck to give me the fiddle, he annoyingly pulled it away just as my fingertips brushed the handle, the intensity of his gaze at odds with his playful expression, “Remember what I said?”

“‘Bring it back to you in one piece.’” I drawled, holding a hand out impatiently. “I know.”

He winked, letting me grab the handle this time. I wouldn't learn what that was about until much later. 

The rest of the day went by in a blur as I anticipated what awaited us all later that day. Termites. Roaches. Flies. Work was filled with infestations that were mind-numbingly easy to deal with. My body did the work while my brain took a back seat.

Time didn't resume normally until I stopped at home briefly before the sun set. Dierdre was waiting for me, a small pile of hagstones resting on my coffee table. She really outdid herself. There were enough that we even had backups. Just had to reinforce them with clear resin and they'd be ready to go.  

“I suppose I owe you a favor now?” I asked with a small smile. 

She grinned coyly, beckoning to me with a finger, “As a matter of fact, you do!”

She'd said that she can't feel it when we kiss, but that certainly doesn't seem to stop her from wanting to do it any less. 

When we broke apart, I admitted, “I’m kind of scared. For tonight, I mean.”

Stroking my cheek comfortingly, she assured me, “If anyone can do this, it's you. And you've got some great people behind you, as well.”

Dread already had my heart gripped firmly in its cold fist. Not just because of who Orion was going to be working with, but also because I just *knew* that we weren't  going to make it out unscathed. Call it foresight, call it anxiety. Either way, I wish I'd been wrong. 

The sun was setting. My heart was racing. It was time.

With the mechanic's violin case in hand, I set out, sending out a silent prayer to anyone that would listen to help me make it home afterwards. I also sent my phone’s location to my coworkers on the off-chance that the Hunters couldn't find me. 

When I arrived at the dark trees, I promised myself that I wasn't going to die that night. No matter what, I would not die. Not after Mom had already risked her life to save me from the Cookie Hag once before. Not while knowing that failure would spell disaster for humans and Neighbors alike.

I would *not* die.  

The hagstone rattled against my collarbone. Eyes in the trees. Crows. The crows were tailing me. One thrust its beak at me as it cawed angrily, unable to get past the stone's repulsion. 

*Of course.* If I had a actually stolen the instrument from the mechanic, there would be Lesser Hunters chasing me. It was good thinking, I'll give Iolo that. It made the whole ruse even more convincing. 

The stone began to quake even harder as I heard a crackly old voice coming from deeper within the forest. My jaw clenched as I used my flashlight to search for the trail of treats that I knew would be waiting for me. The crows called incessantly as if trying to drown her voice out. 

Then they all fell to the ground like pieces of scrap paper. 

Black feathers drifted down like ash around me. I hadn't even heard them die. It had only taken a few words from the Cookie Hag. 

What if we were in over our heads? Even if we were, we still had to try. We couldn't just let her settle in, eating away at those of us that called this place home. 

The smell of fresh brownies and the stench of decay intermingled with each other in the breeze. The Cookie Hag’s terrible voice floated through the trees, “Pesky things, aren't they?”

Trying to sound calmer than I actually was, I called out to her, “I brought the instrument!”

Her laugh echoed, sounding as if it were surrounding me. 

“A feast awaits, dear girl! A feast awaits!” She cooed. 

Knowing I would probably regret it, I looked through the hagstone at the first cookie I saw hanging off of a tree. \*Worms.\* Not sprinkles, like they'd originally appeared to be. With a shudder, I shoved the stone back under my shirt, my stomach turning as I thought about *oh my God, I ate those as a kid!*

Hold on. I forced myself to ignore the squeeze of fear in my chest as I took the stone back out to examine them closer. The cookies were filled with them. Not earthworms. Not mealworms. 

*No way. There’s… there's no way!*

After seeing that cookie, I no longer believe the white stag had simply been hibernating in the mines. Maybe I sound like a conspiracy theorist, but I don't believe that it was an accident that brought the worm epidemic to us. It was intentional. That stag had been *waiting* for someone to find it. 

Up until that moment, I’d thought that dream I had during the possession had been there solely to torment me. To break me down enough that the white stag could take up permanent residence in my skin. But now, I realize that it had been a hint that I’d completely missed. 

*If we fail, the worms’ll come back.* 

Hands shaking from this terrible epiphany, I followed the disgusting confections, not looking forward to seeing what the Cookie Hag considered to be a ‘feast.’ 

The flies buzzing the hag's gingerbread house could be heard from a long ways off, well before I saw or smelled the place. Smoke flowed gently from the chimney. Orange candlelight made the house resemble a lit jack o’lantern. 

The flies tried to crawl into my eyes and ears as I passed through their horde into the gingerbread house's front door, the handle making my palm sticky. Once inside, the first thing that caught my attention was a young boy, slouched over the kitchen table. Fearing the worst, I rushed over to him. Asleep. He was just asleep. 

The hag leered at me, humming as she stood over her ancient oven, patting the massive door affectionately, “It’s best to keep them alive before roasting. Keeps the meat fresh and tender.”

Reflexively, I positioned myself between her and the boy, despite knowing she could swat me down as easily as she had the Hunt’s crows. She didn’t seem to care, however. 

The hag reached a skeletal hand towards me, a piece of her red licorice hair falling across her gaunt, waxy cheeks, “Give the instrument here.”

I hesitated, the case suddenly feeling much heavier in my grasp. We needed more time. Where *were* they?! 

The candlelight surrounding us began to dim. Her voice got deeper, “Give it here. Free yourself.”

The hagstone could stop her song, but could it stop her from killing me? I didn't want to test it out the hard way. 

When she repeated herself again, her voice sounded like it came from the depths of Hell itself, *“Give it here.”*

I gripped the fiddle's case until my knuckles were white. The others weren't there yet. I was going to have to improvise. 

“You said there would be a feast waiting for me,” I said, swallowing to try to get some moisture back into my mouth. “I'm afraid I'm starving.”

The Cookie Hag's head tilted. “Patience. Dinner will be ready soon enough.”

Her oven was a relic, appearing as if it had was made primarily of clay, its wide mouth covered by a heavy metal door. I frowned at it, “Are you certain that your oven is capable of cooking the boy all the way through? You can't leave kids undercooked! You know how many diseases they carry?”

*Well, that ranks pretty high as one of the most fucked up things I've ever said.*

The lights slowly began to brighten again as the hag considered. “That oven has served me well. Since long before your people forced the *Aos Sidhe* under the Mounds.”

My frown deepened as I muttered. “Well, your warranty definitely expired.”

“My… what?”

“How can you be sure that the oven gets hot enough?” I motioned back at the unconscious boy. “He’s got a lotta meat on him.”

The lights began to brighten slightly as the hag pondered my words, “Yes. He is quite plump. Well fed.”

*Dear Lord.*

“How can you tell when it's hot enough?” I asked again, trying to ignore the nausea wriggling in my belly. “Do you have a thermometer, or…?”

The hag opened the oven’s massive door, bathing the inside of the gingerbread house with a blast of heat, “You must check it occasionally, see-”

I shoved her into the oven, throwing the enormous door shut, pressing myself against it to keep her from opening it back up again. The heat singed my palms when I missed the handle, accidentally touching the hot metal in my haste. I ignored the pain as I latched on to the handle. She banged on the door, causing the entire appliance to shake. My teeth rattled against her strength. 

Just had to keep her in there. Just long enough for the others to get here. Or for her to get cooked. Whichever happened first. 

She went from screaming in pain to rage, the candles going out completely as she battered the oven *hard.* It took all that I had to keep from falling away from it. 

Black thorns wrapped around the oven, helping to hold the door shut. From within the appliance, it began to sound like a chorus of angered shrieks. Even with the aid of Briar's thorns, it was hard to keep her trapped inside. 

Footsteps behind me, followed by Victor apologizing for being late. Together, we held the door shut. 

Reyna breathlessly ran into the house soon after, making a beeline over to the sleeping boy. She checked him out, frantically announcing to someone outside that he was still alive. 

The last thing I saw before all hell broke loose was her trying to lift the boy out of his seat. 

The only warning I had was a bizarre feeling in the air. Static. Like lightning was about to strike. The next thing I knew, my back hurt, the wind was knocked out of me, and I was staring at the stars as they winked through the branches above me.  

My head pounded. There was ringing in my ears. *What happened?* It took a moment. The oven door flying open as if under pressure. Victor and I both went through the gingerbread wall. I shut my eyes, shaking my head, trying to get the pounding to stop and for my vision to go back to normal. Victor groaned from beside me. 

When I shut my eyes, trying to clear my head again, I suddenly felt something sharp delicately graze my face. Claws. 

The gingerbread house was on fire, courtesy of Wes and Briar. The flames glinted off of Iolo's wings, chitin, and teeth in a way that was almost beautiful. Of course, that could also be the concussion talking. 

As suddenly as he'd appeared, he was gone, his banjo haunting as he played for the hag. I'm still not convinced that I hadn't imagined this part of the night. 

My body protested as I dragged myself over to check on Victor. 

“I'm fine.” He grunted, pulling himself up into a sitting position, his eyes suddenly going wide before he dove on top of me, shielding me with his body. 

The Cookie Hag had taken control of the flames. All around us, trees blazed. The turbulent, sweet-smelling smoke made the air around us hot and suffocating. 

A group ran past me. Burnt hair and flesh stung my nostrils. Briar had gotten the worst of the inferno, needing Cerri and Reyna to drag him away while Wes carried the kid. The Hunter’s leathery wings were draped over both over their shoulders, the skin charred and brittle. 

As nasty as his wounds were, what happened to him wasn't the worst injury a Huntsman would sustain that night. Burns, even severe ones, only take a couple of days for Hunters to recover from completely. As strong as they are, they can be hurt. And hurt badly. 

Victor looked like he had a bad sunburn on his face and hands after the firestorm. He rolled off of me, helping me to my feet. 

When I saw the hag, levitating, surrounded by a whirlwind of fire that consumed the vegetation around her, my heart damn near stopped. Her waxy skin had melted completely off, leaving only crispy, reddened meat to coat her bones. Her thin arms were raised above her head, the skin blackened and bubbling. 

I caught a glimpse of the Huntress as she flitted from tree to tree with her batlike wings, just barely fast enough to escape each blast of fire. In the chaos, I couldn't tell where Iolo had ended up, though the hag screeched with fury every time a banjo string was plucked. 

Without thinking, I drew Ratcatcher. We had hurt the hag, but regardless, we were losing. We *couldn't* lose. If either the Hunt or Orion failed, there wouldn't be anyone left in town that could stop her or the worms from wreaking havoc. Victor appeared to be on the same page, taking out the shotgun loaded with salt shells. 

As Iolo taught me the hard way, the hagstones can't do shit against projectiles. The firestorm fell under that category. If either of us were going to be useful, we’d have to find some way to get close to her without getting burnt to crisps. 

We retreated back into the trees, using the scorched trunks to hide. He went one way, I went another. For the moment, the hag seemed to be more preoccupied with the Hunters. Without wasting any more time, we were off, using the trees as cover. 

The fire had grown so massive that the entire forest was illuminated in orange light. The closer I got to the hag, the harder it became to breathe. The air was uncomfortably hot, the smoke making me cough roughly purely on reflex. My skin felt as if it was slowly cooking as I drew nearer to the source of the inferno. 

One of the whips of flame managed to catch up with the Huntress, knocking her to the ground not too far from where I was. Energy. There was energy building up around us, not unlike how it did before the hag broke out of her own oven. 

I quickly took my hagstone off, hanging it on a branch nearby before I darted towards the fallen Huntress, grabbing her arm and dragging her out of the way just as a wall of fire consumed the spot where she'd just been. 

While she hid with me behind the tree, she was breathing hard. Whether it was from fear or exertion, I don't know. Now that she was close, I could see that some of her hair had been scorched off, the entire right side of her face and body horribly burnt. Little flames sat on the top of her antlers like birthday candles. Without thinking I blew them out. At first, I’d thought that the red fur that surrounded the base of them was blood, but realized that it was simply the color of the fur, not unlike the red ears of the Cŵn Annwn.

I told her to stay there. Despite not having eyes that I could see - only sharp, wolfish teeth - I got the sense she was glaring at me.  

“You're hurt.” I urged her, trying to sound gentle despite my haste. “You won't be any good to your captain or your king dead.”

She let out a frustrated sigh, slumping against the tree trunk, a hand covered in red fur reaching up to gingerly inspect her burns. She winced. If she still could feel them, at least that meant that she hadn't sustained any nerve damage. 

There was a gunshot. While I was tending to the Huntress, Victor had managed to shoot the hag out of the air. The flames disappeared, leaving the clearing in darkness. Only a few small flickers remained here and there in the grass. The gingerbread house had been reduced to ashes, sickeningly sweet smoke drifting into the night sky.  

I retrieved my hagstone and raced over to join the boss. The Cookie Hag lay face down as he unloaded another shot into the back of her skull. 

Iolo had appeared nearby. He gave the strings of his banjo one sharp swipe. The hag's body split in two, from the top of her head to her groin. 

Not long after, the static built up in the air again. With a terrible sucking sound, the two halves pulled themselves back together. She raised a hand towards Iolo, or, more accurately, where he had been mere seconds before. The trees in the direction she'd pointed groaned, several of them falling noisily to the ground, their trunks split. 

She slowly rose into the air, her body curling, bathing the area in an eerie blue glow as her fingers twisting towards Victor, her horrible voice muttering in a language I'd never heard before. The sensation of static told me that her words were a curse. Whatever it was she'd tried to do to the boss, thankfully, the hagstone protected him from. However, the force of the spell caused it to disintegrate, covering his chest in black dust. 

I didn't realize that could happen. That was not something I *wanted* to know could happen. 

The mechanic's banjo cut through her terrible chanting. She suddenly spun towards him. I simply reacted, feeling electricity in the air once again as I ran towards him, hoping that the hagstone would be enough to stop whatever was about to happen. 

I got to him, but not quickly enough. 

He dropped to his knees. Two of his wings twirled to the ground beside him, leaving only the ones on his right side still attached. His entire body shuddered, those sharp teeth parting, but no sound coming out. 

The hag’s deep, cruel laughter pulled at my heart. Gingerly, I felt for my hagstone. By some miracle, it was still intact, though I was willing to bet that it wouldn't last much longer. 

She didn't just want the mechanic dead. She’d wanted him to destroy him slowly, piece by piece. Just like the poor insect she'd tortured. If I hadn't intervened, he would've lost more than just two of his wings.

Some may argue it's what he deserves. Believe me, I know firsthand what horrible things he is capable of. But it's one thing to indulge in fantasies of making someone that hurt you suffer, it's quite another to see them torn apart in front of your eyes. 

Another gunshot. Victor was trying to draw her attention away from Iolo and I. She contorted herself in midair, her bony arms reaching for him. At the same time, I went for her, Ratcatcher raised. 

Thanks to the boss, she noticed me coming too late. I brought the sword down across her throat. 

Thick, syrupy blood streaked the ground in front of me, coating my hands. Her head rolled. Her eyes had melted sometime during this altercation, crusting on her cheeks like burned egg whites. Her mouth fell open. 

I brought the tip of my sword down between her blistered eye sockets, not convinced that beheading her was enough. 

The banjo's strings were snapped harshly. The body split in two again just as the hag raised her hand towards me. I swung Ratcatcher in a downwards strike, slicing off the offending arm. Afterwards, I kept hacking, taking more and more pieces off of her. She was just a torso, now. 

Not enough. The sections of the hag kept trying to reconnect. I drove the blade into her heart, next. 

Victor, whose spine was twisted in the shape of an ‘S’ after being caught by the hag's spell, ambled ungainly towards her, taking out a brand new container of salt he obtained before we set out into the woods. He dumped it on each segment of the hag that I cut off. 

She weakly tried to chant again. He made her swallow the salt, along with whatever curse she'd been trying to utter next. 

I heard Iolo grunt painfully behind me. As I took out my own salt container, I glanced at him to see that he'd gotten back to his feet, slowly approaching us, off balance from his injury. He was coated in his own blood, using his banjo to keep himself steady. 

Once he got to us, he pressed the bottom of the banjo into her skull. There were a series of cracks as he continued to drive the instrument down until her head simply caved in. 

Meanwhile, the Huntress had come out of hiding, coming up behind Victor. “Brace yourself,” Was the only warning she gave him before she wrapped one arm around his neck, pressing the other into the small of his back. 

Not understanding what she was doing, I turned on her. Iolo weakly set a hand on my shoulder to keep me from raising my sword at her. The lightness of his touch surprised me. Now that the hag was down, I could see that he looked *bad.* How the hell was he still standing?

There was a sickening crunch, then Victor let out a deep sigh of relief. The Huntress had reset his spine for him. 

“We should separate the parts.” Iolo's voice was barely above a whisper. “Bury them far.”

His head was bowing forward, as if he was about to lose consciousness. I managed to catch him below the arms just before he crumpled to the ground. He almost took me with him, until the Huntress got a hold of him as well. 

“I’ll get him back to his shop.” The Huntress told me, but she couldn't hide the strain in her voice or the tremble in her arms. 

“Let me call my coworkers back,” I replied carefully. “No offense, but you don't look so good yourself.”

She didn't protest further. Together, we slowly lowered him to the ground. She didn't have the strength to get back up after that, and resolved to stay by his side, letting his head rest on her good shoulder. 

Victor and I waited until Cerri and Wes came back to collect both injured Hunters, telling them that we’d meet up with them at the mechanic’s shop after dealing with the hag’s remains. 

Yinz may be wondering why I was bothering to keep the banjo bastard alive. My justification is that as terrible as he is, the idea of simply letting someone die - even if that particular ‘someone’ is undeniably evil - has never sat right with me. It’s the exact same reason I couldn't let my father suffer.

I just hope it doesn't come back to bite me in the ass.

Initially, I'd been worried about spreading the hag pieces, thinking that if some wildlife made a snack of her flesh, it would kick start another worm epidemic. To prevent that, we coated every inch of her in salt. Afterwards, I’d checked the pieces individually through the hagstone and didn't see any movement. No worms. No attempts for the segments to reconnect to each other. Nothing. Just to be even more safe, we then burned them to ashes.   

Victor and I used the last of our energy to drive around, dropping off the hag’s ashes across multiple counties. We mostly targeted bodies of water with the idea being that the current would carry them farther. 

It took hours. By the end of it, we were even more exhausted than we were before. The sun was rising by that point, painting the sky in watercolor brush strokes of pink and gold. 

When we finally arrived at the mechanic's shop to rendezvous with everyone, we found Cerri was sitting outside, her face an odd shade of green while Reyna sat with her, supportively rubbing her back. 

“They're doing surgery in there,” Reyna informed us, eyes bloodshot from being awake for so long. “Or… trying to.”

Upon entering the shop, I immediately understood why Cerri looked sick. 

Iolo was slumped over a counter, claws gripping the stainless steel hard enough to leave deep gashes in it. There was a strange dual-image thing going on with him. It wasn't as if his visage was flickering between his true form and his ‘pretty boy act,’ but rather, both were visible at the same time, moving with each other in synchrony. 

He must've really been weakened, if his disguise was failing like that.

Briar’s vines, these ones thornless, were wrapped around his wrists, keeping him restrained. Judging by the dents and claw marks, Briar had needed to do this for his own protection. Iolo most likely had been trying to fight back purely on reflex. I’d seen it happen before in the med tent while I was on active duty.  

Another vine hung by the mechanic’s mouth, misshapen from the deep gouges in its starchy flesh. Bite marks. Probably to keep Iolo from biting his own tongue off from the nightmarish procedure being performed on him. 

Briar was behind him, blood covering his arms up to the elbows. He was back to looking human, but after what the hag did to him, he more closely resembled Freddy Kreuger than a handsome, edgy e-boy. However, his own injuries didn't seem to matter to him. He was focused entirely on his superior. 

He was using various tools to pry away the pieces of chitin that had connected the mechanic’s wings to his back. The exposed tissue beneath was spongy. 

Briar glanced at me, his exhaustion showing in his eyes. “I need to get these seeds planted. Might not want to watch this.”

In the dual-image, I could see that Iolo's eyes were half open, his eyelids fluttering the only indication that he was alive and semi-concious throughout all of this. 

Briar produced small, green, almond-shaped plant seeds. He tapped on Iolo's good shoulder, telling him to bite down on the vine resting by his mouth. Without comment or hesitation, the mechanic did as he was told. 

I ended up having to leave the room as Briar began to push the seeds into the exposed tissue in Iolo's back. The muffled screams and struggles followed me out the door. It doesn't matter how awful he is. I had no desire to see him suffer like that.

Feeling somewhat queasy myself, I sat with my coworkers outside, grateful that I couldn't hear the procedure anymore once the door shut behind me. 

While we awaited the results of this operation, Reyna caught us up on what had happened with the boy we’d found in the Cookie Hag’s house. Long story shot, the boy is back with his family, but kept talking about a strange dream about a ‘sweet old lady’ that promised him the best birthday party ever. I shuddered when I heard that last part. 

Rubbing his eyes, Victor questioned, “Where’d Wes go off to?”

“He went to get us first aid kits, water, and breakfast. He got burned up a little, but not as bad as our buddies inside.” Cerri piped up, looking slightly less nauseous than she had before. “I think he needed a snack to recover… ya know?”

“Yeah, I know.” Victor confirmed. “I’m gonna have to do the same once we’re all done here.”

“Why don't you do that now?” I suggested. “The hag messed you up pretty bad. We can deal with whatever else needs to happen.”

He looked slightly guilty. “You sure?” 

Reyna nodded, “Go ahead.”

With that, he left to do what he had to do. 

As I sat there, my tired mind trying to process everything that had just happened, a nagging feeling that I'd forgotten something began to arise. I had plenty of time to ponder while waiting on Wes and the mechanic’s operation. My eyes went wide when it hit me: the fiddle. In the madness of the situation, I'd completely lost track of it. 

Briar interrupted my heart attack by leaning out the door, sighing before telling us that they were done. He looked me up and down, “Mind sitting still a minute? Taking that hagstone off?”

“Why?” 

“Because you got thrown through a wall.”

Oh, yeah. That. 

Seeing my expression, he said, “I know I don't look it, but I know what I’m doing. I've been patching up other Hunters for centuries. Humans work similarly enough, albeit with longer healing times.”

Of all things, I didn't expect Briar to be a medic. 

Once the stone was moved far enough away that he could approach me, he shined a light into each one of my eyes while having me recite where I worked and my address. At first, the latter alarmed me, until the Hunter swore he didn't give a shit about where I lived; he was just testing my memory. 

Once he was done with his little examination, he announced, “Yeah, go to a hospital after this. Looks like a concussion.”

“Cool.” I replied flatly. 

Once he was done with me and had determined that no one else was hurt, he went back in to make sure the mechanic was still alive after surgery. 

After some time, Wes eventually arrived with everything he'd been sent out for. All traces of the burns that Cerri and Reyna mentioned were gone. Now that the adrenaline had worn off, food, caffeine, and ibuprofen were desperately needed. My back was stiff and horribly sore. I couldn't tell if I was dizzy from hunger, fatigue, or something more severe.

Briar ended up being right about the concussion, by the way. The hospital also found some internal bleeding, so I’m going to be in the hospital overnight. But I’ll survive, against my better judgment. 

Not long after I inhaled half of my coffee and an entire breakfast sandwich, the shop door opened again, then Briar beckoned to me. Apparently, the mechanic had regained consciousness and was asking for me. 

The room didn't look as much like a crime scene as it did before. Briar had done a decent job cleaning all the gore up. Iolo hadn't been moved from where he'd had his back dug up, his forearms resting on the damaged counter as he sat backwards in a beaten up, old desk chair. 

The dual-image had faded somewhat, favoring the human appearance, though the Dragonfly still hung over him like a shadow. He looked *terrible*. He was pale from blood loss, his light brown hair wet with sweat. Thick mounds of gauze were taped onto where his wings had been connected to: one on the back of his shoulder, the other on his mid-spine. Now that his eyes were open fully, I could see that his pupils were dilated; Briar must've given him something for the pain.

Every movement he made was sluggish. Even the smirk he gave me looked weak. 

“Well, that coulda went better.” He quipped, sounding like he desperately needed some water. 

“Could've went worse, too.” I pointed out. 

He shrugged his right shoulder; the side that hadn't been injured. 

“Yeah, there's that.” He conceded. “Hag taken care of?”

I nodded. “We spread the ashes across a few different counties.”

For a moment, his eyes closed as he straightened painfully, revealing that a triskelion was etched into the right side of his chest. An intentional scar drawn into his skin long before tattoo needles were a thing. If the symbol had any ink on it at any point, it had faded to invisibility. 

After he’d readjusted, he sighed, some of the wickedness returning to his smile as he said, “I hate to say it, but after tonight, we're pretty well even.”

*Wait, what?*

He continued, “We can decide what that means when I don't have one foot in the grave and the other in ketamine hell.”

As much as I can empathize with the fact that he was tortured, that still didn't stop my first thought from being, *‘Yeah, not so fun when it happens to you, is it?’*

Once I got over my initial petty reaction, I wondered about his earlier words again. Was he letting me out of the life debt? No. No way. He couldn't be. That wasn't like him. 

Not bothering to hide my skepticism, I replied, “So, I *may* have a concussion so I’m going to need you to clarify something, if you can. Does that mean you're releasing me?”

“Maybe,” He flinched again, his wounds irritating him once again. “Maybe not. Like I said, we’ll talk it over when I’m not half dead.”

The backdoor opened and the Huntress ambled in, the violin case clutched in her unburnt hand. Her human disguise was just as damaged as her true appearance. The  skin on the entire right side of her body had turned a bright, leathery red. What used to be strawberry blonde hair now clung to her scalp in dark, scorched patches. 

“I found this at the scene,” She announced, sounding equally as drained as I felt. “Figured it would be best that it wasn't left for just anyone to find.”

I’d expected him to glare at me. To take back his hint at an upcoming offer of freedom. But instead, he offered the Huntress a languid smirk, “You figured right. It's a good case. Cost me a pretty penny.”

*The fuck?*

“If you don't mind, sir, I’d like to be dismissed. I need to dunk myself in a pool of aloe.” She said as she set the case on the ground in front of him. 

He nodded once, “Go ahead. Ya earned it.”

Once we were alone again, he grinned at me like the cat that ate the canary. He asked me if I'd opened up the violin case at any point. My brows furrowed in confusion, I'd told him that I hadn't. 

He gave me a wink, “You should.”

With a heavy sigh, I indulged him, kneeling beside the case, lifting the latch to discover that it was filled with sticks, leaves, and some small animal skulls. 

He caught the look I was giving him, smirking as he said, “I wasn't willin’ to risk somethin' of mine fallin’ into the wrong hands. Ya understand, dontcha?” 

Amazing, isn't it? Even after enduring two amputations and being put through a hellish operation, he still found the energy to be a complete and total motherfucker. Truly amazing.

However, that energy seemed to be waning. He swiped his palm across his damp forehead as he started to slump forward, his eyelids growing heavy as he leaned against the counter. 

“Is there… somewhere in here you could lay down?” I asked despite my annoyance at being worried over a *case full of sticks and leaves.* 

Eyes now shut, he muttered, “I have a couch in my office. It's a piece of shit.”

“Better than the floor.” I retorted gently, grabbing him around the waist, forcing him to lean into me in case he lost consciousness again. 

He let out a soft *huff*, as if I was inconveniencing him, but slid his arm around my shoulders. He managed not to pass out until I got him positioned in a way that ensured that he wouldn't collapse on his bad side. 

I don't know if it had just been the ketamine talking when he said that we were ‘even,’ but I’m going to hold him to it. Though, I want to get Deirdre's perspective first. 

On the bright side, we have the hag situation under control. It was messy, but it's done.
