Night Log #1: It’s been four nights since its appearance, I’ve decided to keep logs to remind myself of the dangers this reality holds. It just stares at me, those cold, soulless, deep eyes reflecting that of your own mortality. Knows how to make a guy very anxious. Log end-

Night Log #2: I’m sure like everything else, i’ll lose care for these logs in due time. I’ll likely do one every day for I give it two weeks.

Night Log #3: It can’t be human, it doesn’t blink, it moves as one with the shadows, I started all this believing it was my mind. But Blake is gone now, it got him. He thought it was a friend in a costume, it wasn’t. I can see him in its eyes, he’s still alive but not anywhere close to here. Log End-

Night Log #9: I decided to try and speak with it in the night to get rid of the edge. I said “What are you?” no response. It doesn’t feel alive, it doesn’t move, only to disappear in the light. Log End-

Night Log #10: Still trying to get a response from it, No luck. It’s growing, eyes larger and darker, skin paler. I feel as if it benefits from being here. Log end-

Night Log #18: I Got A Response! of sorts, I said I”Do you know why you’re here?” it shook it’s head yes, it understands the english language to an extent at the very least. And when it moves its skin seems so tight and heavy when it makes movement. Log End-

Night Log #22: I’ve done some research into it and I found theories one about demons that feed off of fear. They’re described to come at night, find favorite victims and scare them. I’ll try and show this demon that i’m not scared of it tomorrow night. 
Log End-

Night Log #23: It has been a month since the last log, i’ve been recovering in the hospital, i have lost my right eye and gained a ever spreading rash around the gap where it used to be. I believe it is stronger than a demon that feeds off fear. Maybe it’s stronger than a real demon. I don’t know. Log End-

Night Log #39: My walls are torn, i’ve lost it all, to this, this thing, this entity of suffering 

Night Log #58: True despair only shows when you’ve lost everything. I’m going to kill it.

Night Log #98: Why! Why! Why must it be this way! The souls of all that once is gone to be that which was! Why Why Why!

Night Log #99: The shadows move in liquid form beneath all of those who are torn. Streets fill with bloody murder, scratch that inside and third cursor, one in the beginning watches the night, two in the middle stalk with strife, their falls fast into hell, where all evil remains, is born… Dwells

Night Log #512: So, how are you? ha, ha HA HA. Heh, yeah. That’s nice.
