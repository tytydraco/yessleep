Clinking of metal echoed through the basement as I pressed fresh shells into the reloader, one after another, the rhythmic sound almost ritualistic. Every cartridge I built was packed with finely shaved silver pellets, measured by weight, polished, and sealed with the same precision a jeweler reserves for diamonds. I wasn’t simply making ammunition; I was constructing insurance, in case something else decided to show up at my window. If safeguarding my home meant spending entire days underground forging shells of blessed metal, then so be it. The basement would become my factory. 

The process became methodical. I laid out every component of a shell, primer, casing, powder, and that vital payload, the silver. Materials purchased from a gun store, with silver that needed to be imported from the official D.N.A. Armory.

The scent of gunpowder seeped into the air, mixing with the iron-sour tang of heated metal. My hands were blistered, stained, not from negligence, but from repetition. It was a labor that felt holy, in its own way. A violent kind of prayer. Every shell held a piece of my resolve, and when they were lined up on the workbench, gleaming faintly in the lamp’s glow, I felt safer than I had in weeks. Safer, but never safe. Not anymore.

Then the peaceful ambience of the cellar died. A sharp electronic chime cut through the stillness, the security system. The newest cameras I’d installed flickered to life upstairs, alerting me to movement on the property. I froze. The monitor’s feed showed headlights drifting down the dirt road, slow and cautious, before a white car pulled into the driveway. For a moment, I didn’t breathe. My hand instinctively reached for the nearest shell, still warm from creation. A feeling of recognition flowed over me like water. I’d ridden in it a few times years in the past. A familiar face exited, holding a yellow file.

I moved up the stairs and unlocked my door, heading into the cold of the winter air.

”You remember where I live?” I asked Julia. She was covered in a large puffy coat.

She shrugged, “I just asked Nathan, I didn’t  memorize your middle-of-nowhere address.”

I nodded, not fully convinced, and opened the folder. Inside were two sheets of paper, each describing a job. One was…

”A Wendigo in Alaska?” I was appalled that she would offer me that after the recent events, "Seriously?" 

Julia finally broke into laughter, finally doubling over. I rolled my eyes and looked at the other paper. My curiosity peaked as she wiped a tear from her eye.

“Missing family?”

“All five of them. The Miller patriarch and his wife, along with their two daughters and son.”

I stared at the photos for a while before putting them back in the folder and nodding. Julia didn’t move. It seemed like she was waiting for me to say something, but no words came from me. I waved, and she seemed to take the hint, turning back to her car to leave. As she walked away, I felt a pressure rise through my chest and out of my lips.

“What if I don’t want to hunt anymore?”

She looked at me, “I asked you that question a long time ago.”

The silence covered the clearing. She had, when we were dating, offered to leave the program with me. An opportunity to focus on our relationship instead of killing. I had refused, the animalistic need inside me taking priority.

”There’s something controlling me,” I answered, my voice almost breaking. It was a moment of vulnerability I never showed and it caught her attention.

”You told me that-“

”You don’t understand,” I cut her off, closing my eyes to avoid tears. Acknowledgment of my condition brought forth a slew of hatred for my inhumane body.

”It’s a call. It’s a need to find something. I hunt to appease it, but I can tell it wants something more.”

Julia approached and hugged me. The sudden warmth leaked streams of salt from my eyes.

”What if the animal in me wants to hurt humans?”

The question hung in the air as we stood in the cold. No answer found me as the first sights of snow began to replace my words.

\*\*\*

I killed the engine and stepped out of my truck at the border fence. The Miller farm sat alone at the heart of four enormous fields, wheat to the east, corn to the west, and stretches of untended soil on the remaining two sides like empty moats. A weather-beaten wooden sign hung crooked on the fence: MILLER; its letters faded, as though the name itself was trying to disappear like the family it titled.

The sun was sinking, bleeding golden light across the land. It should’ve been beautiful, but beauty always meant nothing to me in places like this. As the last sliver of daylight touched the fields, I loaded my shotgun and pulled a serrated knife from the truck bed. The gate barely came to my waist, easy enough to clear with a quick hop. My boots thudded against dry earth on the other side, and the air felt suddenly colder. Ahead, silhouetted against the dying sky, were the shapes of a homestead and several barns scattered across the property like forgotten tombstones.

I followed the path forward, keeping my boots on the packed dirt while the wind rattled the fields. Corn and wheat rose high on both sides in dimming rows; almost like pillars in a cathedral. I knew better than to look too long between the stalks. It already felt like something else was looking back. Every so often, the field would shift, but never with the wind. Breathing… almost.

The homestead came into view as the sky darkened fully. Up close, it was worse; the frame of the house sagged inward, rotten wood stretching upward like the hand of a corpse reaching for air. The windows were dark sockets, hollow and empty. When I crossed the threshold and stepped inside, the smell hit me first: dust, decay… and something metallic underneath.

The interior told its own story. Furniture overturned. A chair shattered. A family portrait cracked across the floorboards. There had been a struggle, but no bodies. The quiet inside was wrong. Too intentional. As though the house itself was holding its breath, waiting for me to speak first.

My response came in the form of salt. I pour the chemical around the house, searching for any reactions. I got nothing but the vibe of a haunting from this house.

A common misconception about Ghosts; many think they’re spirits, dead humans drifting around after death.

Ghosts not a person embodied past death, but are echoes of negative emotion. Death, pain, any sort of agony and loss of life can result in a Ghost latching onto an area, the same way mold grows on rot. They’re parasitic phenomena, not living things. They don’t have organs or bodies, but they know how to mimic both when it helps them hide. In every case, you’ll feel a ghost before you see one.

A cold spot in an otherwise warm room. A pressure in your chest like your breath is being stolen. Sometimes they speak, voices of people you knew, or think you knew. They collect memories from their victims and play them back like recordings. They don’t understand language… just pain.

When a Ghost decides to manifest, it picks a shape. Usually humanoid, a copy of the tragedy they stemmed from, but twisted, limbs too long, spine arched like a hanged body, head lolling or twitching like it’s trying to remember how to be human. They move in flickers, never walking fully, existing one second, then reappearing somewhere else like blinking from frame to frame.

Ghosts cannot be killed. There is no heart to stab, no brain to destroy. They can only be severed from their anchor, an object, a room, a body, releasing the agony that was built up. Salt helps, so does iron, along with burning the source and praying it wasn’t inside a human being.

The cold had crept up my spine as I watched the salt line I’d laid across every threshold and hallway of the house. No footprints disrupted it. No shift of air. No whisper of pressure pushing against it. Whatever haunted this place hadn’t chosen to manifest, or it was something far worse than a ghost.  
I stepped outside, closing the rotting front door behind me. Nobody was living here. Not living. To be safe, I decided I’d burn the place down before sunrise. I turned toward my truck and froze.

Someone stood beside it.

A shudder moved through me, but I loosened my grip on my shotgun and walked calmly toward the fence. Whoever it was had a flashlight pointed through my driver’s window. Not a beast. Not a phantom. A man.

He was old, gray hair only growing in patches across his nearly bald head. His coat was thick, his stance casual, but the way he clutched that flashlight was predatory. He heard my steps in the dirt and whirled around, blasting the light into my eyes.

“Who the hell’s out there?” His voice was sharp, defensive more than afraid. 

I raised a hand to block the beam. “Easy. I’m with the D.N.A., doing a wellness check. The people who live here haven’t been seen in a few days.”

“The ‘D.N.A?’” There was a pause. Then his voice hardened.  
“We’re fine.”  
The way he said it was too quick, it snapped every nerve in my body to attention.

“You’re Mr. Miller?” I asked.

He nodded once. Impatiently. Like the question offended him.  
“And I don’t appreciate you being on my property.”

His gaze never left me. Not even to blink.

I apologized, backed away, and returned to my truck. I started the engine and began rolling down the dirt road. Miller stood squarely in front of the gate, arms crossed, watching me until I was out of sight.

But as I watched him shrink in the rearview mirror, I realized something important:

He didn’t look worried.  
He looked… protective.  
Not of his family.  
Of something on this land.

I parked a mile away and doubled back through the dark. Something wrong had rooted itself in those fields. Every sense in me, the human ones and the ones I inherited, told me there was another predator nearby. Maybe more than one.

The corn swallowed me as I entered it. The stalks rose above my head, brushing my arms, parting slowly as if hesitant to disturb the silence. I stepped carefully, controlling my breath, letting the soil swallow my sound. The fields felt awake. 

Finally, the path opened into a clearing. One of the barns was glowing dimly from inside, a weak amber light that didn’t reach the windows. That would be my last stop.

First, the dark ones.

The barn nearest to the homestead was shut tight with a keypad lock. I popped it open with my bare hands and slipped inside.

The smell hit me like a fist.

Bile flooded my throat. The walls were lined with knives and axes, each one varnished with dried red like trophies. Bone fragments littered the floor. Something was dripping in the back corner, slow and wet.

I covered my nose with one hand and drew my shotgun.

A noise erupted from behind me, an inhuman groan. A sound like pain without lungs to hold it.

Something enormous pressed against the doorway, a shape too big to enter. It lurched forward with a wet cracking sound as its shoulders popped and distorted to force themselves through. Hulking and Misshapen, it was nine, maybe ten feet tall. 

I dove out a window and sprinted through the field. Behind me, thuds and squelching with every step it took. I looked over my shoulder.

The fiend was humanoid., but swollen. Like a body left too long in a river and then forced to walk once more.

The look cost me, I tripped into a shallow pit. The thing rolled down after me, its many unseen  jaws gnashing in ravenous spasms. I fired both rounds into its face point-blank.

The muzzle flash revealed faces.

Multiple bodies, all fused into a single writhing sculpture of agony. Their mouths shredded and stretched. Some eyes were replaced with steel. Others blinking in sheer, animal terror.

The blast seemed to stun it, and I didn’t hesitate. I fled toward the only lit barn. Slamming through its doors, I kicked a barrel in front to barricade them. A cough made me jump, and I spun to meet whoever had let it out.

Miller stood behind me. His face was stone, but his eyes were alive with something black and feverish.

“I told you to leave,” he muttered.

“There’s something out there,” I said. “You’re not safe-”

His lips curled slowly into a smile.

“Safe? Son… I brought it into this world.”

The lantern light revealed the room, chains, hooks, slabs of flesh. A table covered in surgical tools and half-melted steel. This wasn’t a barn. It was a slaughterhouse, a workshop. The door behind me split in half, and the monstrous thing crawled in, its many heads twitching. Trapped souls inside flesh, reaching, snarling, weeping silently. Miller stepped beside it with pride.

“Their agony in death allowed them to stay,” he said softly. “I made them stronger. I made them beautiful. My modern Frankenstein..”  
He leaned close as his creation lurched toward me, seemingly intent on watching my death play out. I struggled as a hand made of arms reached for me. A madman had killed his own family in the most agonizing way possible, then attached the phantoms he’d created to a monster of his design.

An idea filled my head as I escaped the grasp of the poor souls. My running was limited as its other arm crashed into my chest. I hit the wooden wall next to Miller, wood splintering along my back. He grabbed me by the mouth, looking me in the eyes.  
“They could use another friend there.”

His words were like nails on a chalkboard. His brutal misunderstanding of what he’d done disgusted me. He began to choke me as his creation loomed over my body. I grabbed his forearm and squeezed. A horrible crunch came from it and he screamed in pain. The fiend noticed its creator's pain and lifted me off him. I threw a punch into its face, causing a shout of agony to come from it. I followed it up by jamming a finger into one of its eyes. A gurgle escaped it and it dropped me. I wiped the muck off my finger and turned my attention back to the other monster.

Miller looked at me with fear for the first time. He had recognized whatever had nestled itself inside me, the beast that craved a hunt.

“What the hell are you?”

I didn’t respond. I drew my knife and walked to him. He scrambled back, trying to escape his fate, but I had the man by the ankle before his escape was completed. His screams filled my ears as I flipped him over and plunged the knife deep in his chest. The attack had not been precise, and I pushed so hard that the bottom of my hand collided with his ribs. I heard them crush as his chest caved under my knife. Blood sprayed out of his mouth as his shouts were drowned by gargling.

The fiend behind me stumbled, and I watched the light fade from its eyes. I’d destroyed what the phantoms were tethered to. The pile of flesh and steel crumpled to the wooden floor, unmoving, the stains of agony cleansed from its person.

It only took me a half hour to lace the entire property in gas. I stood by my truck and tossed a lighter into the field. The blaze of orange climbed to the sky as rainclouds gathered overhead. I drove toward the airport, the darkness of what I’d seen hung over me. Not the animalistic acts of an animal, but the evil of humanity.

Despite this, one fact stood deep inside me still. Killing that man had not appeased the call I still heard, not like hunting the other beasts did. It was nearly a relief, but I could still feel the urge climbing. It was like an icy grip, a pull toward something horrifying.

\*\*\*

I poured myself a bottle of Jack Daniels, more than a drink, less than a solution, and collapsed onto the couch beside Julia. The TV flickered across our faces, casting color over the silence. We didn’t speak for nearly a minute. No jokes. No small talk. Just silence settling over us like dust in a crypt.

Finally, she asked, quietly but firmly,

“Why’d you call me? Why did you want company?”

Her question hung in the air. I’d dialed her number before I’d even reached my driveway. Before the engine cooled. Before the smell of blood could fade from my coat. She was right to ask. There was nothing romantic in my request, I don’t know if I’m even alive enough for that. I just needed a heartbeat in the room besides my own. Someone real to water down what I’d seen in that barn.

I opened my mouth to speak, but a knock at the cabin door cut me off.

Instantly, Julia rose to her feet. She didn’t hesitate. She just reached across the table and drew her pistol, cocking it with a quiet click. My pulse spiked, and I stood as well, grabbing my shotgun from my bag. We moved to the door slowly, weapons raised like we were stepping back onto a battlefield we never left.

I opened the camera feed on my phone. The tension broke, just enough for me to breathe again.

I unbolted the door.

Nathan stood there, framed in the snow. Frost laced his hair, his breath misting in pale clouds. His expression frightened me, a look of fear I’d never seen him display.

“We have an issue…” he said.  
His eyes locked onto mine.  
“In Alaska.”
