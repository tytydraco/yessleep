If you asked me what my dream job was when I was little, I would have said working at a movie studio.

I was eighteen when I changed my mind I lived with my mom but not my dad.

Because my dad worked at a movie studio, he wasn't a director or anything important.

But he made all the set parts and even knew how to make robots and androids for the movie.

Dad never really showed up at home except during Christmas or Thanksgiving or when it was my birthday.

But then I got the surprise of my life.

I was sitting on the couch in the living room playing my video games when my phone rang.

Confused I picked it up and my eyes lit up when I saw it was my dad calling.

"Dad, your calling, are you all right?"I shouted, probably blowing his ears out.

"I'm fine Alexander, calm down. I was wondering if you wanted to come see me for a few days," my dad said.

"Wait, you mean come to the studio?" I said.

"Sure, I asked the boss and he said if it was fine, just ask your mother about it and if she says yes, I'll see you soon," the dad said.

Then he hung up. After that, I got up and headed into the kitchen where mom was.

I told her about what my dad had asked me to do and she told me I could, and I gave her a tight hug.

Anyway, a few days later, I was all packed up and ready to go see my dad. Now, even though I was eighteen, I could drive.

Before I left, mom told me to mind my manners and listen to dad.

I nodded, telling her I would before getting into my car with all my stuff, and then I headed off.

As I was driving, I was wondering what kind of movies were going on at the studio.

Dad had helped make all the most popular movies that were playing right now.

Mostly, Dad was behind the camera because he did all the set and background things for the movies.

I once told my dad I would make a movie when I was older, and I tried my best, but it never worked out.

A few hours later, I got to the Killer Wood Studio, which was the name of the studio my dad worked at.

When I got out of the car, I grabbed my bag and then I turned around, nearly jumping out of my skin.

A grown lady wearing glasses was standing there and she was smiling at me, showing me very bright teeth.

"Greetings, are you Alexander Prescott?" The lady asked me

"Um-yes ma'am," I said, still in a bit of shock.

"Oh thank goodness your father sent me to come get you because he was doing a project and couldn't get away from it," the lady explained.

The lady introduced herself as Sofia, and then she told me to grab my stuff and then told me to follow her.

As I followed behind her, Sofia started talking about all kinds of things that happened at the studio.

"This studio first opened in 1920, and it was the very first movie studio to make a scary movie," Sofia explained.

My dad had told me the history of the studio, but I didn't want to be rude, so I just let her ramble on.

As we were walking, I noticed one building that looked old and broken down, and then I stopped.

" Hey Sofia "What's that? I don't think I've seen that before," I said, pointing at the building.

Sofia turned around and gasped when she saw what I was pointing at.

Then, before she could say anything, she hurried off, and I followed behind her, running to keep up.

"What is it, Sofia?" I asked as I got up right next to her.

"You don't want to go in there, young man; that's the robot graveyard," she said.

Then, before I could ask her what that was, she told me where the studio area where my dad worked was.

Then she hurried off, and then I headed into the building, and the smell of paint hit me in the nose.

"I need more blue paint," I heard a voice say.

I followed the voice and then noticed my dad, who was painting, and he had two other guys with him.

I watched as they were painting a background, and then dad turned around, and when he saw me, he smiled.

"Alexander, you made it," he said as I ran over to him.

Both of us hugged each other, and then I looked over dad's shoulder and saw the background he had been painting.

"What do you think?" He asked, grinning.

"It's awesome," I said, grinning at it.

"Well, since you're here, you can help me with cleaning up," my dad said, grinning at me.

I rolled my eyes and smiled and then headed over to start cleaning things where I noticed one of the guys.

He then introduced himself as Cal and smiled at me as he helped me clean up the mess.

While I was cleaning a paintbrush, I was thinking about what Sofia had said.

" What are you thinking about, kid?" Cal asked.

"Well, this lady I was with told me to stay away from this place called the robot graveyard," I said innocently.

All three of the men gasped, and I looked at all of them confused.

" What did I say that was wrong?" I asked nervously.

"You don't know what the robot graveyard is, do you?" Cal asked me

"Cal, don't you dare tell my son what that place is; he doesn't need to know," the dad said.

"All right, Mr. Buzzkill, you're the boss," Cal said, raising his hands.

After a few minutes, I was done cleaning, and Cal and the other guy told my dad that they were going to get some lunch.

After they were gone, Dad sat down at his desk and then looked up at me.

"I'm guessing you want to know what that robot graveyard thing is, don't you?" Dad asked me

"I mean, it would be nice to know," I said, leaning against the nearest wall.

"Well you see, the robot graveyard is where the owner of the studio puts all the robotics and machines that don't work," dad explained.

"Wait there just put in some random building and not thrown in the trash" I said annoyed.

"I agree with you, son, but I can't argue with the boss and some of my coworkers say that the place is haunted," dad said.

"Woah, hold on a second, haunted how?" I asked, looking at him.

"There's this one robot we tried to use for a movie but it never worked right, so we tossed it into the robot graveyard and some of the workers say that robot was haunted," my dad explained to me.

"Didn't you make that robot?" I asked him.

"Of course I did and no, I'm not a witch or a wizard, so I don't know what happened to that robot, but enough about that. How's your life going?" Dad asked.

I told him everything that was happening in my life and he smiled at everything, even the bad things that had happened.

After that, dad told me he was heading to the main studio and asked if I wanted to come along.

So I followed behind him as he headed to the main studio, thinking about that robot graveyard the whole time.

When we got to the studio, I slapped my hands over my ears. It was very loud inside the place.

Dad didn't bother saying anything, so we just headed off to the watching area with the camera guys.

They all smiled when they saw us, and I watched the scene that was going on in front of us.

The actors were having a big fight scene, and I was smiling like a baby who had a whole bag of candy.

"Cut!" A loud voice shouted, making me jump.

A man was sitting in a chair, and then he turned around and glared at us.

"Patrick, I thought I told you not to come in here when we're filming a scene," the man said.

" I'm sorry sir, but my son is here visiting me and he wanted to see the movie being made," dad said, grinning nervously.

"Well, you have to leave because we're very busy," the director said.

With that, my dad took my arm and led me out of the room, telling me that we were going to head to the hotel.

He told me that he slept there when he was done with work, but when we got to our room, I started texting on my phone with mom.

"Hey kid, I'm going to check on the background for the movie. I'll be back in a few minutes. Just stay here," he said.

I watched as he walked out of the room and then he was gone. An hour later, the sun was starting to go down and he was still gone.

I got bored of using my phone, but then I figured out something I could do, and I grinned a smile covering my face.

I was going to check out that robot graveyard, but then I got up and grabbed my phone before heading out of the hotel.

I then headed to the studio and then noticed the gate was locked, and then I actually climbed over the gate and landed on the other side with a small thump.

Running off, I headed to the robot graveyard, and when I got there, I noticed that the building was locked and I sighed softly.

" Darn it," I grumbled under my breath.

I then looked around and then felt around in my pockets, wondering if I had anything that would pick the lock.

But I didn't then I looked down and noticed a bright green hairpin and smiled as I bent down to pick it up.

I then started fiddling with that lock on it before it popped off and the door opened.

"Bingo!" I said, looking around.

I realized the room was super dark and I felt around on the wall, noticing there was no light switch.

So I took out my phone and then I flipped the flashlight on my phone on and looked around.

I noticed there were machine parts everywhere, and then I started walking deeper into the building.

As I walked past a pile of old robot parts, something grabbed my ankle and I jumped.

When I looked down, I noticed half a robot sticking out of the pile 

"Please help us," it said in a tiny voice.

My mouth fell open. Maybe it was because this part of a robot was talking to me, but still I couldn't help it.

"With what?" I asked nervously.

"Save us from the robot master," the tiny voice said, sounding scared.

"W-why?" I said, looking at it.

"Because he'll kill us all if you don't," the little robot said.

I headed off and then I saw it. Standing in the middle of this room was a giant robot.

It was wearing a trench coat and it looked like it was also human. It then turned around and I almost dropped my phone.

I then noticed it was missing an eye, so where an eye should be was a black hole.

"Do you like what you see, human?" It asked in a dark voice.

"Who are you?" I asked, backing up

"I'm the robot master and everyone here listens to me, including you," he said, pointing at me 

"But I'm not a robot," I said, looking at him.

"I don't care," it hissed.

Before I had time to run, the robot master snapped his fingers and then I heard this horrible noise.

I turned around and saw robot parts like arms or legs and others heading straight towards me.

"What the heck?" I shouted, jumping as an arm shot towards me.

"Kill the human if you have to! " The robot master was shouting.

I kept jumping over and ducking under robot parts. I had noticed that it was a bit brighter in the room.

I then ran off and kept running as I heard robots shouting and laughing, but then, like an idiot, I tripped and landed on the ground.

I turned around, looking over my shoulder, and saw the robot parts and the robot master heading right for me.

I backed up until I hit a wall. I couldn't move. I didn't want to. I was willing to let these robot parts kill me.

"Stop!"I shouted at all the machines.

I then slapped my hands over my eyes, waiting for the robots to do their thing, but nothing happened.

I took my hands off my eyes and noticed that the robot master and the robot parts weren't moving; they were frozen in place.

"What the-" I mumbled under my breath.

I then got up and ran out of the robot graveyard, and I noticed it was getting to be night time.

Suddenly, I bumped into someone. At first, I thought it was the robot master, but then I noticed it was Sofia.

"Alexander, what on earth are you doing here?" She was shocked to see me.

I didn't tell her. I just looked at the robot graveyard, wondering if the robots were going to follow me.

She must have seen me looking at the robot graveyard because she gasped in shock.

"You didn't go in there, did you?" She asked me

I nodded nervously before standing up I started to head off, but she grabbed my arm.

Sofia said, pulling out her phone. "We have to tell your dad, I'll call him."

"No, you can't!" I shouted at her in fear.

Then, before she could do anything else, I ran off, heading to the gate so I could go to the hotel.

But I stopped when I saw Cal and the other painter guy in front of me, and they both had their arms crossed.

"Alex, you can't leave until your dad gets here," Cal said.

"But I need to. I'm going to get tracked down by those horrible robot parts," I said in fear.

I turned around to run the other way, but Sofia and someone else were blocking the way.

In fact, it seemed everyone else who worked at the studio had made a circle around me, so I couldn't run away.

Then they all started talking at once, telling me I couldn't leave and not to worry and that my dad would soon be here.

I slapped my hands over my ears, screaming at everyone to stop talking and shouting, but they wouldn't.

Suddenly, a jolt went through my body and my hands fell off my ears.

I then shut my eyes and bent over halfway breathing heavily. I couldn't move or speak. All I could see or notice was darkness 

" Everyone out of the way, give me some space," a voice behind everyone else said.

Mr. Prescott shoved past the crowd and looked at his work. He sighed softly.

"What happened to the android?" Sofia asked Mr. Prescott.

" I'm not sure, Sofia, but I'll take a look at it really quickly," Mr. Prescott said.

He then walked over to the android and lifted the T-shirt up from its back.

It revealed a closed compartment on the back, and Mr. Prescott popped it open before looking around.

The wires were in a few of the plugs, but they looked fine, and Mr. Morris gasped when he saw the problem.

"What is it, sir?" Cal asked Mr. Prescott.

"It's main computer chip is fired, that's why it shut itself off," Mr. Prescott said.

" Do you think you can fix it, sir?" Someone else asked Mr. Prescott

" Yes I can, but Sofia, can you call my wife and tell her the android got shut off?" Mr.Prescott  said.

Sofia nodded and then ran off to go call Mr. 'Prescott's wife, and then he looked at Cal.

"And Cal you help me fix this thing? It's going to take too long with just one person," Mr. Prescott said.

Cal nodded and watched as Mr. Prescott grabbed the android and threw it over his shoulder.

"Back to the drawing board," he muttered as he walked off.
