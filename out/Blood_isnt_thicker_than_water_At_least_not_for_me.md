I’m writing this post on my laptop in some sleazy motel in Cody, Wyoming. My partner Maria is sleeping soundly, her pretty olive skin marred by terrible gashes, crimson arterial blood all dried and ugly. No hospitalization for her, or for me. It would be against company policy.

I’ll clear up a few details about myself. I get ticked off when people aren’t clear as crystal to me, so figured I should do the same. I’m Clarke Edwards- a detective working for a private consulting agency. I’ve worked for this agency, which I advise myself not to name, for about twenty years. I’ll be thirty-four this year, so they definitely plucked me out of my adolescence. My damn intelligence. The Denver branch of this agency is where I work, though I much prefer my home state of Maine. No “campuses” there though. Maria is my newest intern, but her forensic skills are through the roof so she’s  been upgraded to my partner. A gorgeous, Swiss babe with tanned skin and perfect black hair styled like Elizabeth Taylor. Cold blue eyes, though you’d never guess her personality. Stays sweet, even after I’ve yelled at her for her damnable system of file organization. Weird girl, though. I don’t care if you graduated from a top Swiss university at 16, or if you were a biophysicist and forensic scientist before the age of 24, licking evidence does not sit right with me. But she never gets sick, so who am I to care? Our agency isn’t on the government’s good side, and I’m not responsible for her. As long as I make sure no one is looking, she stays.

We had been assigned a case- or rather I, Maria’s not that important to be doing cases by herself. A guy brutally killed in Paradise…Paradise Valley, Montana. Normally those assignments were so mundane that they were usually assigned to lower level investigators. This one was different…our client who contacted us to solve this problem profusely wanted closure. Being insanely rich helped him acquire our services. He had seemed more concerned about the disappearance of wildlife from their acres and acres of property in Montana. Like that mattered, damn rich government paid farmers.

Getting up to Livingston, the closest big town to this valley, was easy enough. Shoot up I-25, merge to I-90, and head west from there. Maria and I had a fun little rendezvous up in Billings, before we ventured to Livingston. Checking into our motel for the night, or nights to come, was easy. Placidly Maria accepted the crappy motel I chose. I was used to sleeping with disgust etched into the walls, the sheets, the rooms, and I had no plan in stopping now.

The drive down to Paradise Valley was fascinating. I lived in Denver, so shooting up to Estes Park to see the elk was something I enjoyed pretty much weekly. There should have been more animals on this drive in mountainous southwest Montana, is all I would like to say.

“It’s so pretty,” Maria murmured quietly, looking out the window, sleepy looking blue eyes appreciating the landscape. .

“Eh, that’s your native Montanan talking, Miss ‘I worked in Billings for a corporation I still won't tell you about’. Colorado is way better. Or actually, Maine. Appalachians are just as beautiful, and the trees aren’t as dead.”

She ignored me, which was different from her usual acquiescence to listen. “Clarke, I haven’t seen any animals. I wonder where they’re hiding,” she added thoughtfully.

“Look harder.” I chided. Every kid finds an animal when they least expect it on road trips. Surely she should know better to shut her trap and keep looking.

That was the end of the conversation. Maria could argue to no end-often she’d win- but she spared me another bout of anger. And a broken console. 

We pulled up to our client’s house. A wealthy ranching family, obviously. Multiple buildings for whatever ranchers need to do. New combines and horse trailers. I whistled. The ranch house itself was huge, all brick and colonial. Strange, for all its modern furnishings. A man was standing on the porch. After I locked the car, Maria hopped out and walked up to him, flashing her agency credentials and that disarming, coquettish smile of hers, although she was the complete opposite of coy. 

“Hello! I’m Maria Engel, and this is my supervisor Clarke Edwards, and we were assigned from {Redacted} to help you with an incident on your property.” I let her introduce herself first, and helped give me time to assess the surroundings. And men always wanted to talk to her, anyway. 

“Nice to meet you, Maria. I’m Joel Whitfield. My parents are inside, and my…relatives are running about. I’m sure you saw them while you guys were  driving up. Would you guys like to come inside?” I appreciated the hidden mic Maria always used. It articulated every word clearly. Joel was a tall, smiley guy. I hated smiley guys. A bit old, a shock of red hair coating his jaw. 57 years old, if I had to choose an age. Didn’t look evil or suspect, but then again my ex-wife was an utter doll and she cheated on me with my brother.

“It’s a wonderful day out, it would be a shame to waste it,” I interjected. “And debriefings usually take so long, sir…Though I’m quite sure you’re the type to get over things quickly?” He seemed pretty calm after seeing a brutalized body.

“Ha, not at all. I drag things out, ask anyone in my family.” Joel grinned, leading me to the side yard overlooking the valley. Maria looked at the woods again before joining us on the patio.

“Real quick, Joel, we just have to get all the basic details down quickly. You found a dead body, correct?” I wasn’t here to have a sappy conversation on Montana wildlife and mountains.

“Yes, I was out with my father. We were trekking around a few miles south of our ranch checking our cows when we smelled something disgusting. The wind was blowing it towards us, y’know the smell of death, you can’t mistake it. And there was a guy. Poor dude. Didn’t recognize him at all. His face was bashed in, like a rock fell on him. And he was dragged around by knives. His face was meticulously cut up, as well as his chest. His stomach was all gutted, as well, not an internal organ— well I’m sure there weren’t any organs left. Even called up my brother in law, he’s a doctor. Sent pictures-“

“Hold on, Joel. When did you find the body?”

“7:45 this morning-“ 

“Is the body still there? At that spot?”

“Yes-“

“Why didn’t you call the police first?”

Joel’s smile widened.

“There’s more to that, but my first thought was my nephew. My nephew works for your agency, doesn’t he? Thought I’d give him some fun. Looks like he’s not here though.”

“Your nephew?” Not an entirely shocking revelation. Had to know the nephew’s name before I pressed on. Maria was beside me, writing down the information and then some.

“Philip Bliss. In fact, his father John is who I texted.”

“Oh, really? We work together, then. Phil is a paramedic though, and I’m assuming that guy is really dead in your report, otherwise he would have joined in.” I wasn’t so suspicious then of Joel. But it wasn’t enough to not also call the police. I also needed to see the body. Damn, I haven’t done cases like this in such a long time I was losing my mind. 

“Hey, where is the deceased locate-“

“Hold on, could I tell you something-“

“Sorry, Mr. Whitfield,” Maria interrupted softly. “If the police haven't been notified of this incident, it’s best that Mr. Edwards and I see it first.”

Joel looked embarrassed. 

“You can only get to it on horseback or on an ATV,” he cringed. “And I promise, I have a better explanation for not calling the police.” He headed to an ATV by an equipment shed but I called out to him. 

“Hey, I know how to maneuver one of those. Would you be fine if I drove, as long as you gave me directions?” Not taking chances of letting someone, even Phil’s relative, drive for me. “Besides, you can tell us your explanation in the meantime.”

Quickly Joel agreed, looking relieved. Maybe he was just a crazy uncle who really wanted to see his nephew. 

Damn, I hated ATVS! Annoying things. All bumpy and loud. The mic Maria had made everything better, though. 

“You just go past these couple hills, till we get to a cow fence-“ Wind whipped and killed any chance for Joel to have a coherent conversation, since he didn’t know we could understand him despite the bumps. Maria motioned for him to wait until we reached the destination of the deceased.

*Good,* I thought, *There is definitely a dead body*. *Least he isn’t lying.* With an internal groan of dissatisfaction I forgot about his father having also seen the body. It’s been so long since I solved a simple murder, I was getting weak.

There wasn’t much we could do for the poor man. His face was unrecognizable, and he was certainly gutted. But something was strange. The knife marks looked like claws shredded the body. It had the perfect balance of human motor control and animalistic rage.

“Wasn’t a human,” Maria breathed to herself, but I heard it clearly. I stopped her from licking anything. Didn’t know if she got off on that action or what, but Joel didn’t need to see it.

Joel looked more upset than stressed about the mangled body of a dead man.

“Mr. Edwards, do you want to know why I didn’t call the police?” He said, getting angrier. He wasn’t angry at me, I knew that much. I raised my eyebrows, waiting for his next sentence. It was a question.

“Do you know about the reintroduction of wolves in Yellowstone?”

I nodded. Went up there years back. Saw those furry beasts. I thought they were interesting. Surely he wasn’t implying…

“Well the cops here are prisses, bow down to the wolves as their god. Can’t shoot, can’t kill them. Even when you’re supplying meat and wheat for America. Even when you’re protecting your family. Moreso, elks, moose, deer, haven’t seen them for months. Can’t let the kids out after dark because I KNOW we have damnable wolves out on the loose.”

Joel kept on ranting.

“I know whatever killed this poor soul was a wolf. You think those bastards in Livingston will believe me? Or the warden? Hell no.” Joel hissed.

“It’s happened before. To our cows. Our horses. Our animals. My siblings guard from their windows with a shotgun now. And it’s not some mangy wolf either. It’s a smart, cunning one. It’s… sentient. There is more than one. And no one will believe me, because wolves are wonderful and amazing and great. The government isn’t keeping those wolves in Yellowstone, Mr. Edwards. They’re letting them roam, and they have the taste of blood now.”

I nodded along. It made sense. Wolves. But the body… the murder… was it even a murder after all? The signs showed a methodological nature. Wolves were smart, but not as smart as a human. I lost myself in thought.

“Mr. Whitfield, you want no… em, public authorities involved at all?” Maria’s droll voice woke me.

“Absolutely not- I mean not really, Miss. I’d probably get sued in a heartbeat.” Maria looked at me. 

*Let me lick the blood. Please.* She pleaded in her bright blue eyes. I wanted to throw up. This is why we never…nevermind. I cleared my throat.

“We’ll have to contact our agency’s BRT, Mr. Whitfield. Would you fill this form? I’ll have to contact our coroner.” Or one of our many coroners.

“We have no cell reception here-“

I waved my hand, walking around so he would face me and not Maria. Who was doing her little ritual. “We operate on a private network, Mr. Whitfield.”.

I’ll have to stop writing, I’m falling asleep. Maria is still sleeping soundly. Whatever got into her blood is in mine now. I don’t want to sleep, but the pain from claws digging in my skin sucks. Sleeping would be the better route. After seeing Maria hurt, and after getting my ass kicked, I decided that I’ll keep writing about this disgusting case. About my brother. I don’t care how rich he is, or if his social media wolves will delete my post immediately. His actions need to be held to light. I really hate my brother.
