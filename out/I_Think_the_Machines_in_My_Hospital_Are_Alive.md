A few days ago I picked up a new job at my town's local hospital, but something doesn’t feel right.

It’s hard to explain. It’s not like the place is outright haunted or anything. There's no flickering lights or cold spots. Just this... tension. Like a smell you remember, or a strange sense of nostalgia. It sits behind your eyes and makes the back of your neck itch, almost like a never-ending feeling of Deja-Vu.

I’m a cardiac sonographer. I do heart ultrasounds—echocardiograms. It’s a quiet job, usually. Dim rooms, soft beeping, the low whir of machines doing what they’re supposed to. You learn to appreciate the silence in hospitals. You learn to trust it.

Here, though, the silence feels full. Like it’s waiting.

The first thing I noticed was how the machines react when I enter a room. Not always, and not obviously. But sometimes I’ll step into an exam space, and a monitor will beep—just once. Or an IV pump will click. Little things. Too small to report, too consistent to ignore.

There was one patient, an older man in step-down recovery, who had already been scanned earlier that morning. But his nurse asked me to double-check some wall motion irregularities. No problem. I wheeled in the machine and started prepping the gel.

The moment I touched the transducer to his chest, his heart rate spiked. Not dangerously, but enough for the monitor to throw a minor alarm. The waveform jumped, flattened, then corrected itself.

But the strangest part was that it didn’t look like anxiety. His breathing was steady. His eyes were closed. He didn’t even flinch. The rhythm changed exactly when I began scanning, and stopped the second I pulled the probe away.

The nurse glanced at the monitor and said, “Happens with that one sometimes.”

That was it. No concern, no follow-up. She acted like it was normal.

A few days ago I stayed up late. Paperwork, mostly. I passed by the imaging lab after everyone had cleared out, and I could still hear the machines humming. That’s not unusual—some systems don’t fully power down.

But then I heard something underneath it. A kind of ticking. Not fast, not mechanical. Slow. Deliberate. Like a finger tapping on a table.

I waited. Listened. It stopped when I stepped closer.

The next morning, I ran a routine scan on a  patient. The room had no sound, except for the soft hum of machines, and slow beeps of a patient monitor.

I swept across the heart in a subcostal view. Everything looked normal. And then something flickered on the screen. For a split second, it wasn’t a ventricle. It was... I don’t know. A shape. Perfectly symmetrical. Too clean. Like a symbol that didn’t belong in a body.

It disappeared so fast I thought maybe it was an artifact. But I’ve seen a lot of artifacts, and this wasn’t that. It wasn’t static or noise.

It was something.

The nurse didn’t comment. She didn’t even look at the screen. She just said, “If it gives you trouble, power cycle it. Usually calms down.”

I didn’t ask what she meant by it.

Now I’ve started watching the machines more closely. The way the cords curl slightly when no one’s touching them. How the infusion towers seem to lean, just a little, when you walk past.

It could all be in my head. I hope it is.

But there’s something in this place. Something in the machines.

And whatever it is, I think it’s learning how to respond.

I picked up an overnight shift. One of the echo guys called out, and they asked if I could cover some ICU scans and a couple down in neuro recovery. I said yes because I needed the hours and figured the quiet would be good.

It wasn’t.

Something’s wrong with the machines here. Not broken. Just... wrong.

There’s a feeling you get sometimes in old hospitals, like the building itself has memory. Stale air, quiet lights, half-heard footsteps around the corner. I’ve felt that before. This is different. This place doesn’t feel old. It feels occupied. Like the machines aren’t just tools, they’re residents. Like they know their roles. Like they prefer nighttime.

The first scan went fine. Some routine follow-up on a post-op patient in the cardiac wing. The echo machine felt a little sluggish—slow boot, slightly delayed image rendering—but nothing to panic about. I chalked it up to a software hiccup and moved on.

The second patient was down in the neuro. Guy had been out for days, something with brain swelling. The room was cold. Too cold. There was a thin layer of condensation on the vitals monitor screen. Not fog, exactly. More like breath on glass.

That should’ve been my first clue.

I wheeled the machine in, ran my setup, and went through the standard views. Parasternal long, short axis, apical four-chamber. My heart was steady, nothing fancy.

But then the screen—my screen—blinked.

Not off. Not glitched. It blinked. A slow, deliberate shuttering. And when the image came back, the heart wasn’t beating.

It was twitching. Like something mimicking a beat. Not synchronized. Just enough to pass.

I looked at the patient. Still breathing. Monitors steady.

Then the echo cart made a sound—low and muffled—like someone shifting inside it. A faint creak, almost wet. I stepped back, and swear to God, the wheels adjusted themselves to stay facing me.

I powered it down. Full shutdown. Told myself I was being paranoid. Maybe I imagined it. But when I pushed the cart back into the hallway, every door I passed hissed like pressure was being released. Quiet little exhalations. Like sighs.

Later in the shift, I went to grab a drink from the vending machine in the main lounge. It’s one of those old models—an ancient thing, probably hasn’t been updated since 2004. It lit up before I even touched it.

The screen glitched, flashed a dozen symbols I didn’t recognize—lines, dots, little circular shapes—and then settled on a message:

TRY AGAIN.

No button had been pressed. No dollar inserted.

I walked away.

The last scan of the night was on a woman in the step-down unit. She was awake, kind of out of it, but aware enough to talk. When I introduced myself and started explaining the scan, she interrupted me.

“They like you,” she said.

I asked who she meant.

“The machines,” she said. “They don’t like everyone, but they like you. You’re gentle with them.”

I didn’t know what to say. I think I just laughed awkwardly and got to work.

During the scan, the image was crystal clear. No stuttering. No blinks. Just smooth, perfect echo views.

At the end, she looked up at me and asked, “Did it show you anything?”

I said no.

She looked disappointed.

Then she said, “It will.”

And she closed her eyes.

I immediately called in a code blue, but it was too late. The machines roared as her body went limp.

That was my first time losing someone. And I still think about it. I didn’t sleep that night, and I’m writing this because I still can’t fall asleep.

Tomorrow I work a later shift. I’ll try to write down anything weird that happens. And once I’ve gathered enough evidence, I’ll find someone who can help me understand whatever is happening here.

If anyone reading this has seen anything like this before—anything even close—please let me know. I just want to know I’m not the only one seeing it.
