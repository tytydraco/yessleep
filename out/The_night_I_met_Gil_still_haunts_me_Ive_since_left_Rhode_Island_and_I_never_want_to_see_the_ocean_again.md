That night in October haunts my dreams and my waking hours alike. I can’t keep it to myself anymore. It gnaws at me to be the only one who knows what happened. Well... not the only one.

Gil knows, of course.

I moved into a rented duplex outside of Little Compton, Rhode Island last year to take a job teaching high school English. Little Compton is a speck of a New England town near the Massachusetts border. Idyllic, quaint, and walking distance from the ocean. The move wasn’t exactly a step forward in my career, but it was a pleasant shock from my time in Boston. I’m a Tennessee girl originally, yet coming to this sleepy little seaside town felt like being reunited with an old friend, somehow forgotten.

How I wish they could have stayed forgotten.

I met Gilbert at a local pub called Neptune’s where I sometimes played trivia with a couple teacher friends. I saw him sitting alone down the bar from me, so alien and tall and awkward on his bar stool and strangely beautiful all at once. There was something unmistakably odd but wholly captivating about him, and when he looked up and caught me staring, his eyes were like an aquamarine arrow right through me. I don’t think I’ve ever felt that way looking at another human being.

It was then as if some unknown force had lifted me off my chair and carried me across the room to speak to him – something so out of my character that it’s still confounding to me now. We meshed like two well machined gears, and we talked and talked and laughed and drank and drank some more. He was gentle and soft-spoken and slyly funny, and although he was built like a great slender swimmer, there was also something fragile about him. Like the bone of a bird.

We stayed until the bar closed, and when we stepped out into the foggy bite of early October, my head was spinning. I hadn’t even considered how I was going to get home, and when he prodded me about it, I said it was “just down the way”.

“So it’s close?” he asked, and I said it was, although it wasn’t true.

He nodded and said he was in the other direction, and that’s when I blurted out a thought that hadn’t had the chance to face the scrutiny of my own good sense.

“What if I went home with you?”

Gil looked a little surprised and then peered up the road to where it fell away into a black cloak of trees just beyond the amber throw of the street lamps. Although he was turned away from me, I could see the edge of his face crease with discomfort or worry.

I backpedalled immediately, stammering and flushing red, but then he turned to me with a warm smile that stopped my words and said, “Alright.”

We walked through the night on an empty road that curved beneath old maples with their orange fingered leaves hidden by mist and dark, and our way was flanked by arteries of low unmortared walls built from stones plucked long ago from the surrounding fields. We barely spoke. I could smell the sea. The last drink I’d had kicked in, and I felt myself weaving a little at his side.

After about fifteen minutes, we turned onto a narrow, rutted drive that winded deeper into the gnarled trees, and we followed that for several minutes until the ghost of an aging two story colonial stood pale and luminous in the moonlight.

Gil led me up paint peeling steps and into the house. He flipped on the lights and revealed a kitchen that was somehow both organized and incredibly cluttered. All about were relics of boats and of sea life and of the sea itself. Shells and sea glass in jars, a mummified pufferfish on a wooden stand. The walls were adorned with nautical objects: block and tackle rope, fishing net, instruments I couldn’t identify, and numerous framed images of boats and fish and seabirds. The house was warm – hot really, humid, and the air smelled briny. Not unpleasant, but as if one were standing right on the shore.

He led me through the kitchen and into a living room that was outfitted much the same, and I gawked at the sheer density of the strange old fishing décor and mismatched antique furniture.

“Wow. I’ve never seen anything like this,” I said.

Gil gave a sheepish smile and rubbed his upper arms.

“It’s a bit of a mess. I wasn’t expecting anybody. I collect old things like this and… well, maybe I’m due for an intervention or something.”

I laughed with him, then I noticed a little framed picture of a bearded fisherman on a lobster boat. Lanky and tall with weathered smile lines around familiar piercing eyes.

“That’s, uh… my father.”

He moved close to me, and his proximity reignited a flutter in my stomach as we looked at the photograph together.

“Honestly a good part of this is his fault. He loved the ocean more than anything, and I’d say it loved him back. So much that it eventually kept him.” He rubbed a hand over his neck. “In a storm. When I was fourteen.”

“Oh. Shit. I’m sorry.”

A silence fell over the room, and I suddenly found myself sweltering in my peacoat. I shrugged it off, and he took it from me and folded it carefully over the back of an arm chair. I felt dizzy from the booze and the heat.

“Is it hot in here?”

“Yeah, sorry about that. The thermostat… somethings wrong with it. I gotta’ get somebody to come look at it.”

I took a deep breath to steady myself.

“Please, take a seat,” he said. “Can I get you anything?”

“Um… some water would be great, thanks.”

I eased onto a sofa that groaned under me as he hurried off into the kitchen. For a moment there was only the ticking of an ancient brass clock on the crowded mantle, and my breath suddenly felt loud in the room. I wiped sweat off my brow and sniffed the wet underarms of my blouse.

Something thumped quietly under the floorboards. I leaned over to look. The floor was dark wood, almost black, and worn to a polish by perhaps a century of foot traffic. I listened for a long moment, but the sound didn’t come again, and then Gil was bustling back into the room with a sweating glass of ice water. I drank it, and the relief of its coolness flooded through my veins and restored me.

He sat on the edge of the couch beside me and smiled, his hands fidgeting in his lap. He seemed abruptly out of things to say, and so was I. The moment lingered, and for the first time I felt a twinge of panic behind my drunkenness.

*What the fuck am I doing here? I don’t even know this guy’s last name! I don’t even know –*

He reached over and took my hand gently, and that disarming smile broadened with unmistakable kindness. The nagging fear vanished, and I was giddy all over again.

“You okay?” he asked, and then we were all over each other.

Clothes fell like autumn leaves, and then the wood of the antique sofa was moaning and chirping to a pounding beat. There had been two prior intimate partners in my life, but I suddenly found myself wondering what the hell we’d been doing all those times. This was like fireworks, and after we reached a wailing, hammering finish, we lay there panting and spent.

“Damn. You don’t fuck like a school teacher.”

“What’s that supposed to mean? What’s a school teacher supposed to fuck like?”

“I don’t know. I’m just surprised is all. Goes to show you about making assumptions.”

I giggled and looked up at him. There were several thin red lines on either side of his throat. Very faint, like scratch marks from fingernails, but uniform and chevron shaped.

“What’s this?” I asked.

He put a self-conscious hand to his throat.

“Nothing. A birthmark. Hereditary thing on my mom’s side of the family.”

“Oh.”

I traced the hair around his navel with a finger.

“I don’t want this to sound weird or intense or whatever, but I’ve never met anyone quite like you before,” he said.

“How do you mean?”

“It’s hard to put to words. You’re just… well, you just seem really great is all.”

“I’ve never met anyone quite like you either, so we’re even.”

“I was too much of a little punk to think much of teachers when I was in school, but this has really turned a corner for me.”

That grin again.

Twenty minutes later, we were back at it in the sweltering dark of his bedroom, twisting and moaning in the bedsheets and sweat. Afterwards we lay together for a short while, then Gil took a sleeping pill, and then we slept.

I awoke with a start sometime later. It was pitch black, and I was drenched. I felt feverish, parched. The air hung hot and oppressive. I sat up in the bed, naked, disoriented, my head already beginning to pound with an angry hangover. I peered through the darkness at Gil’s dim form next to me. He snored softly.

“Gil?” I whispered.

I nudged him. He didn’t wake. I nudged him harder, but he stayed fast asleep.

I rose from the bed and almost fell. The room seemed like it was orbiting around me. I was a little nauseous. I slowly felt my way out of the room and deeper into the house. It was unbearably hot now, and that briny scent only made it worse. I banged my shin on something and cursed softly, moving on through the dark until I made it to the kitchen. I found the light switch and turned it on, blinding myself. I swayed in the doorway for a moment, then moved to the sink and poured myself a glass of water. I gulped it down, then filled another and gulped that down too.

For a moment I just stood there, squinting against the harsh light, then I reached over the sink and unlatched the window. I hesitated, debating, then I swung the window wide and a merciful rush of night air, frigid with the season, washed over my bare skin.

*Thump*.

I turned with a start to a door at the opposite end of the kitchen. Perhaps a pantry. My heartbeat shifted up a gear as I stared in silence, but no other sound came. I took a few steps towards the door, holding my breath, then stopped and listened. The house was completely quiet. Somewhere far beyond the open window, a dog barked. I took a deep breath and left the kitchen.

I found the living room light switch and turned it on. I crossed to a large bay window and pried the stiff, tarnished latches open and swung the windows wide on their hinges. Cold flowed in like water through a broken dam.

As I turned from the window, I noticed the thermostat control on the wall. I moved close, and to my surprise, the dial was turned all the way up to 90 degrees. I puzzled for a moment, wondering how much of a line I was crossing in someone else’s home, then I lowered the dial to 70 degrees.

I turned out the lights in the house and felt my way back into the darkened bedroom where I settled into the clammy sheets and laid my aching head on the pillow.

I awoke soon after to a sound coming from deeper in the house. A sort of flopping, *whumping* noise, then the patter of water. I blinked in confusion, noticing immediately how much cooler the house was now. Cold, in fact. I turned to Gil’s sleeping form and shook him.

The sound came again, almost like a sheet of wet leather slapping against the floor.

“Gil! Gil, wake up!”

I shook him harder. He shifted in his sleep and drew in a deep breath through his nose, but he still didn’t wake.

“Gil! Goddamnit, wake up!”

I shook him again, but it was no use.

The house had gone quiet. I got out of the bed and navigated unsteadily to the door. I peered into the leering darkness beyond, suddenly very afraid. I looked back at the dark shape of Gil in the bed, then again at the void before me.

*Perhaps it was the wind blowing through the kitchen window… blowing the curtains? Maybe they knocked something over?*

I took a deep breath and inched my way deeper into the house.

I switched on the living room light. I looked around, but all was as it was before. The bay window stood open as I had left it. An icy chill seized me, and my skin prickled up in goose flesh. I moved to the window and shut it.

As I turned and approached the gloom of the kitchen doorway, a faint gurgling sound stopped me. My heart hammered dull in my ears as I stood peering at the vague dark shapes of the counter, of pots and pans and things hung on the walls.

The sound didn’t come again, so I moved carefully forward, the ancient floorboards grumbling under my bare feet. I reached around the doorframe to the light switch, and the kitchen bloomed to life. At first, I saw nothing unordinary, but as I stepped into the space, I found myself standing in a large puddle. I looked down and was shocked to see several fish heads strewn about the wet floor. I stared at them, dumbfounded, then traced the haphazard trail of them with my eyes to the door on the far side of the kitchen. It was now standing open; a square of deep black in the wall.

My pulse was racing, but some terrible curiosity drew me slowly across the puddled floor to that cavernous door, and when I looked in, it was not a pantry, but a rough hewn stairwell that descended into a basement. Water droplets pinged somewhere down there like cave drippings. The air that wafted up from the pit was cold and stale and reeking of saltwater and fish. I crouched, trying to get an eye-line on whatever was down there, and when I couldn’t, I crouched even lower.

The basement was flooded. Totally filled with water that shimmered blackly in the faint moon glow of a window well on the far side. I could see now that the rickety stairs before me descended almost immediately into the water. Unknown things floated in that pool, and old pieces of furniture protruded from it in little islands of swollen wood and rotted upholstery.

Something splashed faintly down there, and I snapped upright and backed away from the door.

Then a gurgling sound came from behind me – crackling with damp and closeness. I whirled around, and my eyes fell on a creature.

*A nightmare creature*.

It was coiled up against the door we had entered the house through like a huge serpent, partly hidden by a standing butcher’s block. The dark ichthian skin of its bulbous length shimmered with the strangeness of scales. My heart stopped in my chest as the thing shifted over itself, peering at me with lidless, black eyes, and I saw that its upper half was humanoid in shape. Lanky arms with webbed fingers sprouted out of a torso that bore leathery hanging breasts, and beneath a stringy cascade of dark wet hair, a face slotted with flat nostrils suddenly split in a fat-lipped maw, and a fish head fell out and plopped onto the tile.

I began to scream. The thing writhed at the sound, fins flopping like seal flippers. Crimson gils flared on the sides of its squat neck. Then it shot forward across the floor at me, webbed hands slapping and long fish tail swiping behind it.

I surged backwards out of the kitchen and crashed into a cabinet in the living room. I was knocked off my feet by the impact, and the whole thing came down beside me in an explosion of china. The thing scrabbled towards me and grabbed my ankle with a clammy, suctioning grip. Between my own screams, I was dully aware of Gil’s hoarse voice from the next room, and suddenly he was braced naked in the doorway and hollering at the creature.

“MOTHER, NO!”

He grabbed my arm and tore me from the creature’s grip with great strength. He hauled me stumbling from the room, and immediately I could hear the thing that he called ‘mother’ gasping and slapping after us. We piled into the dark of his bedroom, and he tried to fling the door shut, but the creature wedged itself in it, and I could hear wood snap as it fought the door back open.

“NO, MOTHER, NO! LEAVE HER BE!”

But the thing he called mother did not stop. She clawed across the floor towards me, silhouetted only by a thin light from the living room. Gil grabbed at her, but she fought him off and pursued me still, gasping and sucking wetly through her flaring gils.

I threw myself at where I knew the room had a window, blinded by darkness that swam with my tears. I tried to open the window, but could not undo the latch, and as the sound of flapping fins closed in, my hands found a chair back. I lifted it on instinct alone and swung it hard. The window shattered, and broken glass sang onto the floor around me, but I could tell that the wooden cross bars had not broken out. I went to swing again but was ripped right off my feet by fish cold hands.

I fought on my back, shrieking, as the thing squirmed over top of me, slippery like cold sex and shockingly heavy. Its mouth yawned wide in my face, the flesh at the corners unfolding like a barracuda, and there were glints of light on needle teeth.

Then Gil slammed into her side, throwing her off of me. They rolled together and thudded against the bed, and the thing he called ‘mother’ hissed like some viper, and her tail lashed about the room, breaking things in the dark.

I was up in a split second and sprinting across the house, not noticing when my feet were sliced by broken china and somehow staying upright as I skittered and slid on the wet kitchen floor. I could hear the sucking gasps of the creature already slithering close behind, and as I fumbled open the deadbolt on the door and flung it wide to the night, I could hear Gil wailing in despair.

I charged out into the darkness, crazed and directionless. I threw a single glance back at the house and saw Gil looking out the window at me, his face drawn with an anguish I could feel in my chest.

Heartbreak.

And then I was looking ahead as I ran. Branches slashed at my bare skin, and my bleeding feet pounded wet leaves and then gravel and finally pavement as I broke onto the main road.

I ran in the deep shadows of the reaching trees that sheltered the roadway in that place and did not slow for maybe a full mile. When I finally did, it was to get my bearings, and once I had them, I walked quickly onward in the center of the road, my breath searing in my throat and the taste of metal on my tongue.

I walked for perhaps forty minutes and did not pass a single soul in that time.

I reached my duplex in a trance as the sky to the east grew a pale grey with the approaching dawn. The windows about were all dark, and there was nobody out to see me wild and unclothed like some primitive being.

I stumbled numbly to my door. I pried up a stone from the weed-choked garden with shaking hands and grabbed up the key that lay beneath it. The door unlocked with a click that sounded like a gunshot to my ears, and then I was inside and sealed away from the horrors of the world.

I called the police on my landline at sunrise, and the timing of my call saw fit to put me in contact with the chief directly. He seemed stupefied by my words initially, then angry, and somehow it made me feel angry with myself for saying them.

“Gil is a good man,” he repeated many times throughout.

He asked if I had been drinking or if I had taken any drugs. I told him the truth. He asked if I had any psychiatric conditions, and I said I did not. He asked if I understood the seriousness of lying to a police officer about such things as I described, and it wasn’t long before I hung up the phone on him and cried on the floor of my kitchen.

I called out sick the next day and did not leave my place. I barely ate. That evening, a teacher friend from school stopped by to give me a paper bag that contained the things I had left behind at Gil’s house. My clothes, my purse, my phone. Gil had brought them by the school for me. When I opened the bag, I was struck once more by that briny scent, and I dropped it.

Some time has passed, and I’ve since moved home to Tennessee, but the events of that night are so fresh in my mind that they could have happened only hours ago. 

I never saw Gil again.

I know what happened to me that night in October, and yet I still routinely find myself questioning my own sanity. I ask myself sometimes if I am losing my mind. Perhaps this is just what losing your mind is: knowing something is real when everyone else knows it is not. But this was real. It happened.

I’m haunted by every detail of the experience, but the image that somehow lives most clearly in my mind – as if I’m actually looking at it whenever I think of it – is the image of Gil peering out the window at me as I ran. The devastation in his face. The crushing sadness.

His face will stay with me for a very long time.

I don’t know if writing these words will give me any peace or if anything truly can, but at least now I’ve told it as it happened.

Whether you believe it or not is up to you.
