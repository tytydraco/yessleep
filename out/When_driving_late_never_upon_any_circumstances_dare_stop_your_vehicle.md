Just in case I don’t make it away from this thing, I’ll leave this for explanation. 

I am, as my father was before me, a man whose collar could compete with the sky’s hue. my calloused hands a testament to that. With a stature that could rival some ball players and a lack of aptitude for education, I was a football coaches star child. Though, unfortunately, my NFL dreams are far behind me. 

Taking advantage of what god gave me, soon after high school I worked construction, where from dusk to dawn I slaved till my back begged for a reprieve. Nevertheless, I wasn’t taught to complain, and I never did. Somebody had to lay down supports and the job didn’t get finished quicker by whining. 

After a quarter of my life passed, I soon realized that as much as my wanted to hold true to my fathers ideals, my body was ready to call it quits. Hearing about an opening in a trucking company from a friend, I seized the opportunity without even a second thought. 

I’ll never forget the feeling I got from stepping high into that seat and watching how the beast came alive. The rumbling under my feet from the cabs humongous engine slowly began to be my comfort as I passed from province to province.

Aside from my dog of course. I found him as a mangy lab whose skin practically stretched over its ribs. The animal was uniquely dark, could probably disappear when night falls and it’s eyes matched it’s  striking appearance. They seemed to always look for something to explore. 

Seeing the state it was in, I’d be heartless not to give it a place to eat. Since then, it’d been my support throughout most of my hardships. Id grown accustomed to running my hands through its fur instead of pouring my sorrows into a liquor cup. 

And without change, here that same dog was accompanying me on another outing. 

Making sure I had everything I needed in the cab, food water and the such, I turned to the dog curled up in seat. As I gave him a soft pat the truck came to life and so we began the trip. As usual, the drive didn’t come with much entertainment. I watched tirelessly as car upon car passed by on the sun beaten pavement. 

My one break in the noise was the sunset spreading out colours of red, purples, and yellows. Even so, that was quickly replaced by stars laid across the night. I leaned back in the leather seat and laid my hands behind my head. Before I knew I was sleeping I woke up. 

To my shock, flat grassland had been replaced by trees that seemed to block out the moon, and between them no light escaped. The vast warped branches spanned far out, almost touching the asphalt of the road. The only thing I could clearly see was the path in front of me. Still half awake, I quickly took notice of my dogs whines, pulling over on the side of the road and letting the animal out to go do it’s business. 

As I viewed from the agape door, the dog made its way from the rocks deep into the cover of the tree line. I turned my head away and began scrolling on my phone. Worry began to settle after fifteen minutes ticked past. 

I let out a whistle, “Here boy… lets get out of here.” 

For a few moments the only thing that greeted me was the impasse of bark and foliage cloaking whatever may hide behind the surface. 

Then, as if on schedule, my dog clambered out of a break in the tree line. 

“Where have you been buddy?,” I chucked softly, “I was worried sick”

The second it’s ears perked up to the sound of my voice the animal became rigid. His body turned to me like he was attached to a spinning rod. A dead stare that went right through me matched my gaze. 

It sent a shock down my spine, it was out of character for the thing to move so strict. 

My dog held the same unwavering stare and with every second passing I could feel my heart pound harder in my chest. 

Then, he opened his mouth and began to let out this guttural moan. It was deep, quiet, and alien. 

Ignoring the primal voice screaming to get out of there and quick, I gave a look to the  animal standing more still than the deep pine beside it, illuminated only by the light of the truck cab.

“it was a howl,” I rationalized, “dogs do that”

For the first time in god knows how long I took my eyes away from the tree line, and onto the clock I kept on my dash. 

Before I could even make out the numbers on the clock, I saw in my peripherals something that sent fear down to the core of my heart. 

I slowly turned my head and as if to confirm the feelings of horror my whole body turned to ice. 

Upright on my two legs, and without breaking the leer it gave me, it again began to vocalize. 

“W…WHERE,” it let out in the same jarring tone, “H…A…V….E”

It spoke with long pauses between the letters, and it stretched out the vowels 

In that moment no matter how big I was, or the size of the truck, a primal feeling of being some animal’s prey struck every bone in my body. I slammed my door shut as it sounded out the word “you”.

As though he clocked in on my escape plan, it began making its way towards with its two back legs. 

Not once taking those eyes off me, it leaned side to side as it stepped, increasingly upping the speed. 

I finally took heed of the voice screaming at me to run, and pressed the monstrous car to the highest speed it could go. 

And though I expected it, dread still wormed it’s way through me as I saw the animal in pursuit with my rear view. Albeit slow enough to give me some time to stop at a motel and collect my thoughts. 

That’s where I’m at now, writing this. I’m watching and waiting in case that thing figures out how to open doors.
