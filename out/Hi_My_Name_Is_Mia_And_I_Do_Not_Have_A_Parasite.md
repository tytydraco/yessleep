A few days ago, I remember getting a letter in the post. Unfortunately, I don't really remember much else, not until I regained consciousness about an hour ago, and what has happened since, is all I can remember, but even that is starting to slip, so I best get it down quick...


"Do you recognise this, Mia?" Asked Detective Walker. "Do you know who wrote this? ...Helloo?... Mia?..." He clicked his fingers infront of my face, but all I could do was stare at him and think about the constant, intense itching, that was slowly sending me crazy.


I could hear the Detective speaking quite clearly, and I could see the letter he was frantically waving infront of me, but the dribble on my chin and the continuous blank stare, said it all. Even if I could reply, I would have no idea what to tell him. The Detective loudly huffed and placed his hands on his hips in pure annoyance, then passed the crumpled up letter over to the doctor.


"Do you believe in the Devil, Doctor?" Asked the detective.


With a confused frown, the doctor adjusted his glasses, grabbed the letter and began reading out loud.


**~~Choose a white room that has a mirror and gives you plenty of space to fall onto the floor.**


**Lay down pillows and blankets in the direction you would be landing to avoid injury.**


**Successful attempts have only been known to occur during the dark hours.**


**The number 6 should be written on your body somewhere.**


**Arms should be placed across your chest with your hands out flat and palms down towards you.**


**The participant is to stand as still as possible for 10 seconds, in complete silence and with their eyes closed.**


**Proceed to take three deep breaths, open your eyes, then say these words clearly and with pure feeling;**


*"I wish to leave this world behind, I offer to you my heart and mind, You can take my soul, but not my face, now fly me to another place."*


**The participant is then to fall backwards keeping their eyes closed.**


**An itching sensation may occur.**


**Failed attempts will be clearly obvious and successful ones even more so.**


**I hope to see you soon. ~~L~~.**


"I'm sorry, Detective." Said the doctor. "I honestly don't know what to say. What's happened to her and the other one is a complete mystery. It-It could be an unknown parasite, perhaps? That's honestly my best guess at this point until we start get some results back. Maybe try the other patient? I have him admitted just down the hall."


"You do?"


"Yeah. I'll have to check their personal file, but I'm pretty sure he was found a similar letter. Someone is bound to respond eventually, right?... I'll see if Mia can respond to us using the EZ keys program. I've set one up in her room."


"EZ keys?"


"Like what Stephen hawking used."


Detective Walker took one last look at me, tightly pinched his lips together and shook his head to himself. He huffed again, nodded in agreement, and let the doctor take me back to my room.


As my wheelchair began it's journey back, a single tear ran down my cheek, and I began to wonder just how long it would take before this itch, this *devils itch,* that covered my entire body from head to toe, this itch, that I would never, *ever* be able to scratch, would actually take to kill me.


I'm using the EZ keys program to type this up, but I really don't think that the detective, the doctors or anyone, for that matter, will actually take me seriously. I feel like the itch is slowly eating away at me somehow. So, naturally, I'm reaching out to you guys. I don't know how much time I have left, so I desperately need some answers. I'm afraid I can't tell you much else. I can't tell you what I don't know. But, I can tell you this much... *I definitely do not have a parasite!*
