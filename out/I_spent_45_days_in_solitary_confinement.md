What you're about to read is something I never thought I'd share with anyone but I do feel like the time is right for me to get it out there and let people know what I went through and experienced. Also let's go ahead and get this out of the way now, I'm not proud of who I was in the past so what led me to prison and who I am will remain my own dirty secret. I do want to warn you as the reader though that what you're about to read can be hard for some people. What I learned in prison is that in a place built for the scariest people you can think of, the scariest thing of all is the human mind. I guess there's a reason why the worst punishment you can receive in prison is being locked in a room all by yourself. Crazy to think about isn't it. You're walking around all day wondering if it's the day you're gonna get poked in the yard or if you're gonna get attacked in the shower. The amount of blood I seen shed in that prison would make most people stomach turn. The amount of sexual assaults on top of that is enough to scare any sane human away from ever even committing a crime but in a place with all of that, the ultimate punishment is solitary confinement, total isolation. I smuggled a journal and a pencil into solitary with me and that is what you're about to read, maybe by the end, it'll all start to make more sense why solitary is the ultimate punishment in prison and why I believe its the cruelest fucking thing we could ever do to another human being.

Day 1 

They brought me down to the hole today. It's smaller than I imagined. Concrete, steel, and a faint smell of bleach and piss. The door shut like the end of a chapter. It's cool though I can handle it. Just time. Just space. Nothing I haven't done before. Besides,  it's gonna be nice getting some fucking peace and quiet for once. Should get some good sleep too without having to sleep with 1 eye open all the time. 

Day 2 

Not much to report. They slide meals under the door. No window. Just the little slot. I'm rationing my thoughts. Keeping things neat. Organized. Working through old memories like boxes in the attic. I recited the names of all fifty states today. Twice. I remember this game my dad used to play with me in the car, I can still hear his voice in my head "who sings this?" "What's the name of this song?" It was a good memory exercise, probably why I'm so good at remembering shit.

Day 3 

Hard to tell what time it is. The light overhead buzzes in a constant hum, always on. No clock. No sun. I've been doing pushups and sit-ups. I count everything. Breaths, bites, steps. It's so fucking boring in here but it is what it is. I've heard stories of people breaking in here but mama didn't raise no bitch. 

Day 4 

Dreamt last night, or maybe hallucinated. My mother was there, cooking. I swear I could smell the onions but then I woke up and the smell was gone, but the hunger wasn't. I cried a little. Not proud of that.

Day 5

 I started talking out loud. Just to hear a voice. I described my breakfast like I was hosting a cooking show. Instant grits, dry toast, and something that was probably supposed to be eggs. Five stars for creativity. One for flavor. God, what the fuck is wrong with me. Gotta do what I gotta do for entertainment though, am I right? 

Day 6 

I heard footsteps outside the cell but no one came. They echoed too long, like someone pacing right outside the door. When I called out, it stopped. Weird shit but what's new? This whole fucking place is weird. I'm not sure what's happening anymore honestly, the days and nights are all the same at this point. 

Day 7 

The walls look darker today. Not sure if it's dirt or my eyes adjusting to nothing. I found a crack in the corner. I’ve been picking at it with my fingernail. I don’t know why. Anything to keep myself entertained and pass the time I guess. This whole solitary shit is for the fucking birds, I swear. 

Day 8 

I tried to sleep but kept waking up every few minutes. My dreams are starting to feel real. Last night I woke up swearing someone whispered my name. But there's no one here. Duh. I'm just gonna work out and try to tire myself out, maybe then I can get myself to sleep.

Day 9 

I started scratching tally marks into the wall with the edge of my meal tray. I think I counted nine, but I might have missed one. I can't concentrate. Everything feels loose. Frayed. I'm trying not to lose it but I'm also starting to understand why everyone seems to when they're in here. 

Day 10

 I'm starting to see shadows on the wall. Reminds me of being up for days on meth, the fucking shadow people. I'm aware of what's going on, I haven't lost my mind yet. I know what I'm seeing isn't real. It's all in my head, I just have to be strong enough to get through this shit.

Day 11 

The floor is colder than usual. I laid on it for what felt like hours just to feel something different. I think I saw frost. Or mold. Maybe both. My skin feels wrong. Like it doesn’t belong to me. Am I finally losing it? I hope not. Come on man, get your shit together. 

Day 12

I spoke to myself in a different voice today. It didn’t sound like me, but I answered. We had a long conversation about escape. He said there was a door behind the wall. I asked where. He laughed. Yeah, I'm fucking losing it. I'm aware and yet I don't think there's anything I can fucking do about it.

Day 13 

No food today. Maybe I missed it. Maybe it hasn't even been time for food yet. All I can feel is the echo of hunger. What I wouldn't give for some of my mom's cooking. I'm not sure what time it is, I wish they'd put a fucking clock in here or something. I'm losing my mind. Days and nights are one in the same. I'm so tired.. At least these fake ass shadow people are keeping me busy.

Day 14 

I know the shadow people are fake but damn are they convincing. One told me his name was Frank, he died in a fire and now he roams earth lost and seeking guidance. The other shadow said her name was Linda and she was murdered by a stranger. These poor souls, lost here on earth, looking for answers and they end up here in a fucking solitary confinement cell with yours truly. For their sakes, I really do hope they're fake because if not, what a cruel joke the universe decided to play on them. Just in case they're real, I think I'm gonna try to keep them entertained. At the very least, they'll keep me entertained. 

[As we reach this point of my journal, I hope my writing hasn't bored anyone half to death but I mean if you made it this far to even read this part, you must have some interest in where this goes. Honestly, I may just be stalling myself at this point from having to continue reading my journal myself and putting it down for you all to read. Look, I know I wasn't always a great guy and I've made decisions I'm not proud of but I don't think I deserved what happened to me. I don't think anyone deserves what happened to me. Fuck, the human mind is a scary fucking place to be trapped with. ]

Day 15

Frank told me a joke today. I don’t remember the setup, but the punchline was me. I laughed so hard I cried, and then I cried so hard I forgot what was funny in the first place. Linda didn’t laugh. She just stared. Her eyes look like my sister’s. I don’t have a sister. I keep telling myself that. I don’t have a sister. 

Day 16

There was a tapping. Not in the pipes — too rhythmic. Like fingernails on metal. Like someone trying to get my attention. I tapped back. Nothing. Silence, then three more taps. I don’t know what game I’m playing but I think I’m losing. I asked Frank if he heard it. He said yes. Linda said no. I believe Linda.

Day 17

I remembered a dog I had when I was eight. Her name was Penny. Brown fur, floppy ears, smelled like dirt and popcorn. I haven't thought about her in years. I swear I felt her curl up beside me last night. Warm, comforting. I almost cried again. I don’t know what’s real anymore. I just want to get out of here. The walls are caving in, the silence is deafening and the darkness is haunting. 

Day 18

I chewed through part of my fingernail without realizing it. It bled more than I expected. Honestly feels good to even feel something, a reminder I'm still alive, that I'm still human. Red looks brighter here, almost fake. Like paint. I smeared it on the wall in circles. Don’t ask me why. Maybe I wanted to see something new. Maybe I wanted a sign. Frank said it was a portal. Linda said I should sleep. I think Linda is right again.

Day 19

I heard someone singing. A woman’s voice, soft and sad, like a lullaby underwater. It was coming from the vent. I pressed my ear against it for hours. I don’t know if I actually heard it or if my brain just needed music. Either way, I felt peace. The first peace in a long time. I hope she sings again. 

[Before I get into day 20, I just wanted to take a second to point out, I still hear that song from time to time, gives me fucking goosebumps. That voice, that song, so haunting yet so fucking peaceful.]

Day 20

My body is starting to feel separate from me. Like I’m driving a machine I don’t fully understand. I watch my hands move and I wonder who they belong to. There’s dirt under my nails. The crack in the wall looks deeper now. I can see my skin move, bubble, like something is inside of me trying to get out. I think for the first time in my life I can say I'm truly scared.

Day 21

I tried to sleep last night. I was scared of what I'd see but ended up nodding off anyway. Dreamt I was back in the yard, but the sky was black and everyone was frozen in place. Statues. Their eyes followed me as I walked. No one spoke. Not even Frank. I woke up with my hands around my own throat. I'm not sure how long I was out but my brain is exhausted, I'm so fucking tired. 

Day 22

The tray slot opened and I screamed. Just reflex. I wasn’t expecting it. The food looked… off. I swear it moved. I didn’t eat it. I couldn’t. I buried it under my blanket like a corpse. Maybe tomorrow it’ll look more edible. Maybe tomorrow I’ll be someone else. There's a part of me that keeps telling myself none of this is real but it's the only thing that is real at this point. 

Day 23

I’ve started humming to myself. Nonsense tunes, like old commercials or TV jingles. Linda hums along sometimes. I think she’s getting friendlier. Frank hasn’t spoken in a while. He’s standing in the corner. Won’t move. I think he’s mad or scared. Maybe both. Honestly, same.

Day 24

I tried talking to the guards through the door today. No one answered. I asked for the time. I asked for the date. I begged. Nothing. Not even a shadow in the slot. Just me, my thoughts, and whatever else is hiding in here. This cell is a coffin that forgot to be buried.

Day 25

There was a knock tonight. Four soft knocks. Then silence. Then four again. Morse code maybe? I don’t remember Morse code. I knocked back four times and then something scraped across the floor outside. I pressed my face to the crack. Nothing. Just black. Just forever. There's gotta be someone out there, right? 

Day 26

I saw my reflection in the metal toilet. I didn’t recognize the man looking back. Sunken eyes, cracked lips, something behind the gaze that isn’t mine. He blinked before I did. I turned away. I don’t trust him. 

Day 27

I think I forgot how to speak. I tried reciting the fifty states again but the words felt wrong in my mouth. Like they didn’t belong to me. I mumbled. Slurred. Gave up. Instead I drew maps on the floor with my fingernail. I’ve never been to most of those places. I wonder if they exist. If they do, I hope I get the chance to see them. 

Day 28

Frank spoke again. Whispered, really. Said he found the door. Said I had to be ready. I asked Linda what he meant and she just cried. First time I’ve seen her cry. I wanted to comfort her but she disappeared before I could. I don’t want the door. I just want sleep. Hopefully the door is just this actual fucking door opening and them letting me the fuck out of here. Maybe that's why Linda cried, maybe she doesn't want me to leave yet.

Day 29

The light went out. Not flickered. Not dimmed. Just gone. I sat in the dark for what felt like hours, maybe days. Every creak felt like a scream. Every breath felt borrowed. When the light came back, there was a word scratched into the wall. “HOME.” I didn’t write it. I don’t think I did.

Day 30?

I woke up to warmth. Not the cell. Me. Like something inside me was glowing. I looked at my hands — they were shaking, vibrating. I laughed. I laughed so hard I fell over. The crack in the wall is wide now. I can see something through it. Maybe light. Maybe fire. Maybe nothing. Maybe the door Frank was talking about. I think I'm ready. I think I have to be

Day 31

I peeled a scab off just to feel something real. The pain was dull. Not sharp like it should’ve been. My nerves are dying or maybe I already did. I asked Linda if I was dead. She said yes. Frank said not yet. They both laughed after. It echoed too long. Too loud. I screamed at the wall until my throat went raw.

Day 32

I bit my hand today. I wanted to see if I’d bleed red or black. It was red. For now. Still human. There are things in the dark when I close my eyes—faces I don’t remember but who remember me. One whispered “I forgave you.” Another whispered “I never will.” I don’t even know what they’re talking about.

Day 33

The wall is bleeding. No one believes me. I touched it. It was warm. Metallic. It pulsed like a heartbeat. I laughed and told it “we’re the same now.” I don’t sleep anymore. I think sleep’s a trick, a trap to make you let your guard down. I stay awake to keep them out.

Day 34

I screamed until my voice gave out. No one came. I banged on the door with my fists. Nothing. I cried until I tasted salt and blood. I think I begged. I don’t remember what for. Help? Death? Company? I would trade my soul for five minutes in the rain. I used to hate the rain. I think. Fuck, who knows at this point.

Day 35

I found a beetle crawling across the floor. First living thing I’ve seen in here besides me and the ghosts. I talked to him for hours. Named him Harold. Told him my secrets. Promised him freedom. He climbed into the crack in the wall and didn’t come back. Even he left me. Fuck you, Harold.

Day 36

The shadows aren’t staying on the walls anymore. I saw one in the center of the room today, crouching. It had my face. My eyes. But it smiled wrong. Crooked. Like it was wearing me. It said, “We don’t leave.” Then it crawled inside the toilet and vanished. I think I’m losing something permanent now.

Day 37

Time’s not real. I know that now. There’s no past, no future. Just screams and silence, alternating like breaths. I keep seeing a door where the wall should be. A white one. Not the kind in here. A house door. I knock but it never opens. I think that’s the point. I think I’m being punished for something I can’t remember. Memory is a funny thing, we remember what we choose and forget what we don't but sometimes the mind breaks and we forget things we so badly want to remember. The mind, what a fucked up thing it is. We can talk to ourselves without making a peep, we can imagine whatever we so choose. The problem is the mind can do whatever it wants to. As much as we feel like we control our own mind, our minds most definitely can control us, control our reality. The human mind, fucking incredible. Fucking terrifying.

Day 38

I tried to gouge my own ears today. The buzzing. The whispers. The fucking hum. I tore at them until I bled. It didn’t stop. Nothing ever stops. Linda told me I used to be kind. Frank said I was never going to amount to anything. I told them both to go fuck themselves. I haven’t seen them since. I miss them.

Day 39

There’s another me. I saw him. Sitting in the corner, writing this same journal, word for word. When I moved, he moved. But when I stopped, he didn’t. I’m not the only one in here anymore. I don’t know who the real one is. Maybe I'm just having an out of body experience, maybe my mind has completely broken and I've become 2 different versions of myself. Maybe, just maybe there's a fucking living being in my god damn mother fucking room that looks like me!

Day 40

They’re in the walls. I know how that sounds but it’s true. I hear them breathing. Scratching. Whispering names I’ve never told anyone. I think they’ve been here longer than me. Maybe this place is alive. Maybe it feeds on us. Maybe it’s always hungry. I wonder how many souls have come into this room and experienced what I've experienced. Are they alive? Dead? Is it them that I hear inside these godforsaken walls?

Day 41

I almost stopped writing because I thought it was making me worse but not writing is worse. The silence fills in the cracks. Becomes a scream. This journal is my last thread, my last grip to my sanity. I think if I stop, I’ll dissolve. Just become part of the room. Just another echo scratching behind someone else’s walls.

Day 42

Ahhhh!!! Fuck!!! Mother fucker! 

Day 43

I think i just wrote nonsense the day prior, I'm surprised I wrote anything at all. Today though, 
I saw light under the door. Real light. Not the buzzing fake shit. Warm, yellow, sunlight. I cried. Got on my knees and begged the crack to open wider. It vanished. Cruel fucking joke. I think this place shows you hope right before it eats you. That way you scream sweeter. Scream sweeter? I scream, you scream, we all scream for ice cream? I'm losing it but damn I just made myself laugh so fucking hard.

Day 44

I’m not alone anymore. Something’s in here with me. Not Frank. Not Linda. Not the mirror version of me. Something else. I feel it breathing when I sleep. It moves just outside the corner of my vision. It touches the back of my neck with cold fingers. It says nothing. That’s worse. What the fuck is this thing. I can see it coming after me, it's getting closer, I'm trying to not look at it and keep writing but I'm scared. Really fucking scared. 

Day 45

They opened the door.

Just like that. No warning. No announcement. The light from the hallway burned my eyes. I covered my face and begged them to shut it. One guard said, “You’re being released.” I laughed. I cried.

They dragged me out and I screamed. Screamed like I was dying. Like the cell had become part of me and ripping me out was tearing flesh. The hallway looked fake. The world outside, worse. Too big. Too loud. Too real.

They handed me a bag of clothes and a paper to sign. I don’t remember signing it. I don’t remember walking out.

I just remember the sun.

It didn’t even feel warm, it just felt wrong. Like staring into something I’d forgotten how to exist in.

I should be happy, I know that, but part of me is still in there.

Still scratching the wall.

Still waiting for the next meal slot to open.

Still talking to shadows.

Still counting breaths.

Still waiting for the door behind the wall.

And I don’t know if I ever really left. How could I ever know what's real or not ever again? As far as I know, I'm still in that fucking room, trapped inside of my own head, making up all this shit while Frank, Linda, Harold and that weird fucking demon looking motherfucker are all having a feast with my corpse. I guess, I'll just choose to believe that this is my actual reality and that I did in fact make it out of that room and make it out of prison. The alternative seems far too fucked up. I guess this is as good of a point as any to end my journal and make an attempt at living a good life. 

Prisoner #37426

[What do they call this shit again, an epilogue? I mean, I guess the people who took the time to read my journal would like to know what's going on with me now days. I mean I’m free, at least that’s what they tell me.

I’m writing this from a halfway house. The kind of place where broken men go to pretend they're still whole. I have a bed, a shared bathroom, a chipped desk. There's a window, that faces a brick wall. I haven’t opened it. Don’t think I ever will. What's the point?

I still sleep on the floor from time to time.

Not because I have to, more so because the bed feels wrong. Too soft, like it might swallow me. I lie on the cold tile and listen to the silence. It’s not real silence though, trust me, I know what real silence is. Here, there's always something, a buzz, a whisper, a breath. Something.
Sometimes I wake up and think I’m still there.

Sometimes... I wish I was. Weird, right?

No one told me how loud the world is. Colors are too bright. People talk too fast. Every noise feels like a slap.

I just wanted the silence back, well not really. I'm being silly. That shit was scary, the real world just doesn't feel less scary at times.

I’ve tried to reconnect with people, but I see it in their eyes—they don’t know how to talk to me. They ask shallow questions. Offer me pity. They don’t understand what solitary does. It doesn’t just keep you alone. It makes you alone. Even when you’re with others.

I asked a counselor if I could go back in. Not for long. Just a few hours. She looked at me like I was diseased, sick, wrong.

They don’t get it.

Solitary strips you down. Burns off the layers. What’s left isn’t always something that can walk back into the world and function. It’s something feral. Something altered. Something haunted. I was always told prison was about rehabilitation and that they wanted people to be productive members of society but how do you become an active and productive member of society when all your rights are stripped away and you're stuck in a room by yourself for 45 days with nothing but your mind to keep you company? I get released from my own personal hell and get a swift kick in the ass into the real world and I'm just supposed to function. Un fucking believable if you ask me.

I still see Frank sometimes. In reflections. In alleyways. I hear Linda’s humming when I pass empty hallways. I know they’re not real. I know they never were but I think part of my mind fractured while I was in there for sure and now I just have to ignore the voices in my head, the hallucinations that linger and the way my mind has created its own reality within the reality that everyone else sees.

I continue to talk to Frank and Linda.

Because they listened.

Because they stayed.

They were the only ones who stayed.

Sometimes I go to the park and sit on the bench by myself. I don’t feed the birds. I just sit. Close my eyes. Count the breaths. Wait for the buzz to return. Sometimes I hear the metal door slam shut in my mind, and for a moment…

…I feel safe. Then scared. Then back to reality.

I know I’m not okay.

I don’t know if I’ll ever be okay.

Hard to be okay when part of my brain still thinks that any moment I'm gonna wake up in that room curled up in a ball. Hard to enjoy freedom when I have this fear that it's just not real. I guess that's why I'm typing this, why I decided to share my journal, just hoping that maybe, just maybe, enough people will validate my existence and that I am in fact living in the real world rather than the one I created in my own head.]
