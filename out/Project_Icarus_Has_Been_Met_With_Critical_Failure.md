 

I’ve always been a bit of an amateur radio nerd. I collect and restore old radios. You’d be surprised how much they can go online these days. Part of my restoration routine is to make sure they still work and so I try to see how many frequencies I can tune into and what the sound quality is like. It’s often a bit hit and miss, but sometimes you can tune into some hidden gems. 

A couple of days ago, though, I stumbled across something…weird. I've been able to transcribe it for you guys. Obviously, it has to be some kind of hoax right? I'd love to know what you think.

*Local news outlets will continue to brief the general population on the next stage after this broadcast. Please check your devices for instructions and be sure to follow them carefully.* 

*Failure to do so will result in severe ramifications.* 

*We are so sorry.*

So….yeah. 

I have absolutely no idea of what to make of that. It kept repeating itself for a few minutes and then it just stopped. 

Do you have any idea of what is going on? I genuinely thought it was a really good hoax up until 5 minutes ago when my phone went off. I thought it was an amber alert, but instead, this is what it said:

**ALERT!!**

Project Icarus has been met with critical failure!
