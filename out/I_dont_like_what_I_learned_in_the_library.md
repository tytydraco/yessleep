“Attention: The library will be closing in fifteen minutes.”

The voice coming from the building’s speakers startled me a few hours into my uninterrupted studying in the library’s silent area. I glanced at the clock on the wall, only to realize that hours of screentime had made me lightheaded and caused anything over two feet away from me to look blurry. Regardless of the library closing, I took this as a sign that I should probably wrap it up for the night. Besides, after snapping out of focus, I noticed the air flow in the library had at some point shut off, ending the comforting hum of the vents above. I liked the silence of the library, but without the vents running, it was almost too quiet. I packed up my computer and notepad, trying not to disturb the other sleep-deprived students around me. I had been studying in this same area nearly every Friday since the beginning of the semester, and it was clearly becoming more popular as midterms approached. Even I found myself staying later and later each week. It was easy to focus there, and I wish I had spent more time there during my first year. As I wandered towards the main doors of the library, I smiled to myself when I saw a committed gathering of students in one of the dimly lit conference rooms, clearly engrossed in whatever they were studying and likely to stay there until security threatened to carry them out. I wasn’t feeling great about the next day’s Differential Equations midterm, but historical class averages for Math 235 told me that was a common student experience.

When I received my midterm grade the following week, I realized I should have been a little more worried. Sure, a 68% average isn’t great, but the bright red 33/60 scrawled under my name on the returned test was considerably worse.

“How’d you do?”

I looked up at Harrison’s curious expression, his tone telling me that he didn’t do so well either.

“Not great. You?” I responded, offering my test in exchange for his. He silently handed his over, and I felt a bit better after reading his 31/60.

“Well, at least neither of us failed! Considering that I still don’t even know what question 3 was asking, I’d say that’s pretty good.”

I laughed at Harrison’s optimism as I handed his test back. I didn’t love this class, but at least I had someone to struggle through it with. As we gathered our things and left the lecture hall, I asked what he’d be up to this weekend.

“Uh, just catching up on work. I might try to go to that mid-semester club night I keep hearing about on Saturday, but tickets are so expensive I can’t decide if it’ll be worth it. You?”

“Same. Too much going on to do anything interesting."

“Ain’t that the truth. Well, enjoy what you can, and for what it’s worth, have a good weekend, Eliza.” With that, he zipped up his coat and headed out into the chilly Fall air. I gave him a mock salute and headed out in the opposite direction, taking a detour to Timmies before heading to the library.

“Attention: The library will be closing in fifteen minutes.”

For the second Friday in a row, the voiced startled me out of my study stupor. I was sure I’d get used to it as my late nights continued, especially since my current grades were motivating me to really pick it up before finals. Once again, I noticed the eeriness of the completely silent study room and absentmindedly wondered when exactly the vents turned off. I figured it was a good thing that I was so focused on my work that I completely tuned out my surroundings. Trying to shake off my screen-induced dizziness, I started to exit the library, looking for a garbage bin to toss out my long-empty Tim’s cup on my way out. I spotted one around the corner from the water fountain, right outside one of the occupied conference rooms. As I made my way over, I recognized the group of students I had seen huddled around the room’s table the previous week. Throwing out my garbage, I realized they were considerably older than me, closer to the age I’d expect most professors or possibly mature PhD students to be. I guess I had just assumed everyone in the building past 11pm would be undergraduates fighting for their academic lives. I saw through the glass walls of the conference room that all three windows were open, and I wondered how the room could still feel too hot at the end of October. Glancing at the room’s booking schedule, I saw that it was reserved every Friday from 10pm to midnight for “Anonymous”.

“Hey! Can I help you?”

I jumped, turning to look at the demanding voice behind me. It had come from a middle-aged man who I hadn’t noticed walk up behind me. Man, was he quiet.

“Oh, uh, I was just reading the room’s schedule.” I started to walk away from the door when I heard him again.

“What’s your name?” he commanded. I didn’t appreciate his question. It was dark out, he was at least 6 feet tall, definitely looked stronger than me, and I was well aware of how dangerous campus can be to young female students at night.

“I don’t need to tell you that.” I retorted, barely turning around to face him

“If you’re going to peer into my group’s private session, I want to know your name.” he snarled. At this point, I was starting to get annoyed.

“Dude, this library is open to the entire university. If you want somewhere private, go somewhere else. I was literally just reading the schedule.” I could see him starting to reply, but I turned and put my headphones on before he could say anything. Some people think they’re so important.

 \-------------- 

The next Friday, I found myself squinting at the clock multiple times before 11:30pm. I cursed previous generations for developing technology. I’m sure I wouldn’t feel so dizzy and nauseous if I could study from regular paper every day instead of staring at a computer. I had finished all my midterms for the semester, but I needed to make sure I didn’t fall behind over the next month and a half before finals, so I turned to Google in search of quick remedies for dizziness and nausea. I rolled my eyes at the typical fearmongering that greeted me on the first website I clicked on. I scrolled past multiple links warning me about “The Increase in Patients Suffering from Coronary Artery Disease in Canada’ and “Number of Surgeries for CAD Seeing Exponential Growth” and saw recommendations for various prescriptions. I figured it would be too much trouble to get a prescription, and besides, I wouldn’t even get the pills for another few weeks, so I settled on stopping to fill up my water bottle on my way out. I sighed when I remembered the most convenient water fountain was located right by “Mr. What’s Your Name” ’s booked room, but I needed water and as I had told him the week before, the library doesn’t belong to him. Also, I might be able to avoid him seeing me, as the fountain was around the corner from the glass doors of the room. I left my study area right at half past, noticing a couple of the sparse students around me rubbing their eyes or laying down on their desks for a break, and headed in the direction of the conference room.

I bent over to take my water bottle out of my backpack and felt a rush of light-headedness. Taking a deep breath, I took a moment to close my eyes and lean against the wall beside the water fountain. I could hear hushed voices travelling through the wall from the group inside.

“….system…blockages…transmitted….” my head felt better and my vision was no longer blurry, but hearing those few words made me curious about whatever Mr. What’s Your Name was being so pretentious about. I admit, our encounter was still annoying me, so I figured a bit of eavesdropping could be my way of secretly getting back at him. I turned my head and laid my ear directly against the wall.

“…increasing subject…cabbage…implantation…high recovery rate….” Cabbage? Were they studying gardens? I pressed my head harder into the wall, wondering what kind of gardening meeting would be such a secret.

“…continued artery…under radar…donor…” This voice was quieter, and while I could make out less words, what I did hear was enough to confuse me further. Arteries had no place in gardening… I would think? Then again, I figured this could easily be some sort of animal testing study. The voices went quiet, so I decided to give up my efforts and finally fill up my water. I really hoped hydration was the issue. I did not want to deal with health problems in the middle of my second year.

 \--------------

“Eliza, can you grab me a Gatorade while you’re at it?”

I nodded at Harrison as I stood up to go to the vending machine. He didn’t usually like to study on campus after class, especially in the middle of the week, but this week’s Math 235 assignment was kicking our asses, so we decided to work on it together in the collaborative zone in the basement of the library. As the time went on, I started to ask myself why I ever thought it was a good idea to become a physics major.

“Here you go.” I tossed Harrison his Gatorade and cracked open my Coke Zero.

“Are you sure you want caffeine this late at night?” he asked.

“Yeah, I mean, I’m so tired these days it’s not like it’s going to keep me up. If it can help me get this assignment done tonight, that’s all I care about.” I rubbed my temples, staring at the equations on my screen as if doing so would make them solve themselves.

“I feel you. Leave it to uni to drain us of our lives \*and\* our health.” lamented Harrison. I smiled in agreement. Returning to my work, I heard the vents slowly dwindle off.

“Oh, that is weird.” said Harrison, looking up at the ceiling. “I thought it was quiet before but you’re right, when the air shuts off you reeeeally feel isolated in here.”

“Yeah, it’s especially weird in the silent rooms or when no one else is around. Speaking of, I’m surprised we’re the only people stuck in here on a Wednesday night.”

“Well, I guess most people are either smarter than us or just have better things to do come, what time is it?” he checked his watch. “10 pm.”

“Huh. That reminds me of something I meant to tell you about earlier. There’s this group of, I dunno, professors or something that reserves one of the upstairs conference rooms every Friday from 10pm until the library closes. I tried to listen to their conversation last week and it sounds like they’re researching animal testing?”

Hunter frowned. “That’s odd. Shouldn’t they have labs or offices for that? Maybe they don’t want to be too public by creating a dedicated space for that because of controversies or whatever. What did the room booking say?”

“Anonymous, which makes sense if they’re wanting to keep that type of thing under wraps. Pretty sure all you need to do to book a room is enter an email on the library website. Still, why so late at night?”

“They probably drink too many Coke Zeros during the day.” I threw my pencil at Harrison, and he dodged it, laughing. I started to laugh with him, wincing as I felt the world start to sway around me and my chest tighten. Harrison noticed.

“Eliza? Are you okay?”

“Yeah, yeah, I’m fine. Just the same stuff I was telling you about earlier. It’s probably a migraine or something. Seems to get worse if I get worked up or excited. I’ll be fine.” Harrison still looked concerned, but I promised it was no big deal. We returned to our assignment and kept working for another hour.

  \-------------- 

Two days later, I found myself struggling to get through any work during my usual nighttime silent study despite being fully stocked with water, electrolytes, and anti-nausea medication. The dizziness and chest pain hadn’t fully gone away since my study session with Harrison, and it seemed to be getting worse as I continued to force myself to study. I knew I needed to go home and sleep. Maybe I would call my parents in the morning and see if they had any advice.

I headed out of the study area, deciding that I would see if I could eavesdrop any more on the conference room group. At least then I would have something to tell Harrison about and my library visit wouldn’t be a total waste of time. As I casually headed in that direction, I saw that the door was partially open. Perfect. I could feel cool air as I walked towards the water fountain, and I once again wondered how they could possibly be too warm at this time of year. I glanced around for bystanders before standing as close to the corner of the wall as I could. Holding my breath and trying to ignore my blurry vision and aching chest, I extended a keen ear and heard two voices.

“We’re being noticed. Have you seen the headlines this week?” I recognized the first voice. It was Mr. What’s Your Name.

“Yeah, and? Increasing cases of artery disease is not exactly new in North America.” The second voice was clearly a woman, her tone condescending.

“It is at this rate. I say we slow down our toxin influx. Just for now.”

A third voice chimed in.

“If we slow it down, it’s not a ‘for now’. It’s a ‘for good’. Do you think it’s easy to gain access to multiple building ventilation systems without public notice? Even just in one province? Even with our funding I don’t think I can swing it again if we don’t continue producing patients at our current rate. We have access for the next month, and if our output doesn’t keep up, they won’t renew our contract.”

The first voice piped in again as I felt my chest pain sharpen. I figured I should really go home…but I was so intrigued by what I was hearing, and I doubted I would get better any faster there anyways. I tuned back in and kept listening.

“…operate on each patient under our agreement, but I’m not confident that we’re going unnoticed. Speaking of output, are there any updates for the post surgery results? Have the devices been recognized yet?” He was answered by yet another voice.

“So far, no. Over the past month, we’ve received four positive health signals from our transmitters, all from patients who had been operated on within the past three and a half months. My estimation of three months was generally correct for the transmitter’s in vivo data collection, it’s fighting the toxin as expected, and all four patients passed every screening as predicted by the transmitter. Our outcome was at least 90% of our anticipated value in all cases, with the quality of harvested organs meeting or exceeding our expectations, and autopsy results showed little negative side effects from the transmitter.”

I heard the woman speak again.

“See? If our donor output continues to be this successful, we’ll be okay with the rise in cases making the news. I’m sure we’ll continue to receive funding and possibly extra protection if this keeps up. They won’t allow the public image of our healthcare system to turn. Continue the ventilation pump, surgery intake, and transmitter distribution as normal. Now, can you bring up the autopsy results?”

My heart was racing, trying to figure out everything I had heard. I wiped my hands on my jeans, suddenly noticing how clammy they were. Toxins? Artery Disease? Surgery? I suddenly remembered seeing some of those exact words on the healthcare websites I saw earlier this week. Fighting my now debilitating chest pain and nausea, I stumbled away from the room. Too late, I realized I probably shouldn’t have crossed in front of the glass wall, but I was trying so hard to stay upright that I wasn’t thinking straight. As I was halfway across the width of the glass wall, I heard the voices go silent and the door shut. I prayed that they didn’t see me. When I finally made it out of the library, I failed to see of the icy sidewalk through the darkness and my failing vision. I slipped and felt my head hit the ground with a loud thud.

 \--------------

I came to my senses amongst voices and sirens, feeling something covering on my mouth. The women I realized to be paramedics sitting on either side of me were exchanging words didn’t understand. As I slowly started to try and sit up, the paramedic to my left gently pushed my shoulder back onto the stretcher.

“Hey, hey. It’s okay. Don’t get up. The name on your ID was Eliza, is that the name you prefer?”

I nodded.

“Okay Eliza. Hang in there. Do you remember what happened?”

I squinted, trying but failing to remember the past few hours.

“Someone found you on the ground outside the library. You had a heart attack, which likely also caused your fall. Try to stay calm and breathe. We’ll be at the hospital soon.”

  \--------------

A couple hours and multiple intake steps later, I sat in a hospital bed waiting to see the doctor. I couldn’t wrap my head around what just happened. A heart attack? How? I’m 20 years old! I rubbed my chest, the debilitating pain gone but a dull throbbing remaining. I was also slowly remembering what I had heard in the library. I still couldn’t fully put together what they were talking about, but what I did hear did not make me feel safe in the hospital. I was struggling to piece it together while fighting my lasting headache when I heard the door open.

“Knock knock… Hi Eliza, it’s Nurse Jennifer. I wanted to give you the heads up that our on-call cardiovascular surgeon, Dr. Eberson, will be in shortly. Are you doing alright?” The answer was no, but I nodded anyways. She smiled and left the room, telling me to let her know if anything changed. About ten minutes later, I heard a knock on the door.

“Eliza?” the door opened. “I’m Dr. Eberson. I was expecting to see you here after seeing the state you were in leaving the library earlier.”

No.

It couldn’t be.

I looked up to see Mr. What’s Your Name. The shock probably showed in my face, as he smirked and gave a small chuckle. I opened my mouth to speak, but I didn’t even know where to start. Dr. Eberson continued, looking down at his chart.

“It looks like you suffered a small heart attack due to blocked arteries. We’ll be performing a Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting on you, which should resolve the problem. After the surgery, it is vital that you stay in good health through diet and exercise to prevent this issue from happening again. Do you understand?”

I managed to get my voice back.

 “No.”

 “Excuse me?”

 “No, I don’t want the surgery. I don’t consent.”

 Dr. Eberson looked briefly annoyed.

 “That isn’t an option. You need this surgery or your next heart attack could be fatal. I know you don’t want that.” He paused, his expression hardening. “And don’t pull that ‘consent’ bullshit on me. You and I both know that your idea of bodily autonomy is worthless.”

 He was right. I stared at my hands, feeling entirely defeated. I still didn’t understand what I had heard earlier, but I heard enough to know that whatever they were discussing, it had something to do with patients in the healthcare system. I couldn’t trust anyone in this hospital to help me. I was completely powerless.

 “Good. You’ll be having the surgery later today. And Eliza?” he said, prompting me to look up. “Whatever you heard, or whatever you think you heard, remember, the people making these decisions are experts in what they do and why they do it. It may seem like a big deal to you, but some things are done for the greater good.” He left, closing the door behind him.

 I felt all my hope leave the room with him.

  \--------------

It has been just over four months since my surgery. I feel like my body isn’t my own. There’s something…foreign about it now. Every part of me wants to fix it, but if there’s one thing I do know, it’s that I cannot go see a doctor. Who could I go to? The conversation I heard in the library that day constantly rings through my head, and I wonder what part I now unwillingly play in their plan. However, I have managed to gain back some control in my life. As it turns out, 1000 calories per day, 1-2 hours of cardio daily, and splurging every weekend with a fifth of vodka is enough to keep me barely alive. Positive health signals were received after at three months, said the voice in the room. Staying healthy is vital, said Dr. Eberson. As long as I can remember those words, I will continue to do the opposite. It seems to have worked so far.

Sometimes I still visit the library. And I worry every time I see a student rub their eyes.
