*Knock**Knock*

I heard a knock on my door at 12:13AM. I turned down my TV's volume to make sure I heard it right. I heard it again, this time slightly louder. 

I woke up and stumbled towards my door keeping my half drank bottle of wine on my table. As I walked over, i yelled out. 

"Who is it?!"

No response. I grumbled to my self,turned on my pouch light and looked into the peep hole and was stunned. It was Leah standing in my pouch buck naked, she looked just as healthy and full of life as she had ever been. My brain could not process how it was possible, I was about to swing the door open but I held myself back. 

Something was wrong, this couldn't be. I took two steps back then, I heard her voice. 

"Darell? Are you there?"

Her voice was just as i remembered it, soft and warm, but now she clearly sounded troubled and worried. As I heard it, I stopped and shakily asked. 

"Leah...?"

"Darell! I'm so happy to hear your voice. Please let me in."

She said, her voice now excited and happy. I couldn't hold myself back anymore so I rushed over and opened the door, she shot toward me like a canonball and hugged me tightly, I returned it fiercely.

I walked backwards with her and locked the door behind us with one hand. We held each other with no words shared for a good 30 seconds before I finally asked. 

"Leah... how is this possible?"

"I...I don't know... I was just- ugh."

She couldn't finish as she suddenly held her stomach and exclaimed in pain, I immediately panicked and princess carried her over to our couch. 

When I placed her down, she no longer seemed to be in pain though she was noticeably paler now. I frowned and asked. 

"What's wrong? Are you hurt somewhere?"

"Its fine pumpkin... I'm just hungry is all."

She tried to reply casually, but I knew she took this stance when something was actual wrong. I suppressed the desire to press her for more information and asked instead. 

"So, what do you want to eat Leah."

"What's available?" 

"Beef stew and rice."

"That sounds great, can i have some?"

She asked. I just nodded, went to the kitchen and heated it up and dished her a plate. I placed it in front of her and watched as she ate, she was leah as i remembered her. The same petite,brunette i fell in love with all those years ago. 

She caught me staring and smiled, the food in her mouth caused her voice to be slightly muffled as she asked. 

"I'm not going to vanish you kn-"

She stopped herself mid sentence as she noticed tears in my eyes, she placed her food down and caressed the side of my face and she asked. 

"What's wrong Darell?"

"Its nothing Leah... I just missed you so much."

She just hugged me and whispered in my ear. 

"I'm sorry for not being hear all this while."

This cause me to finally break down, all these sudden turn of events combined with the alcohol caused me to cry myself to sleep with Leah in my arms.

The next morning, I woke up with a slight headache, yesterday's events seemed like a dream until I heard the soft breathing beside me and it settled in. I rolled over and watched her sleep, a gentle smile finding its way to my lips. 

She rustled awake and looked at me with sleepy eyes as she greeted. 

"Good morning pumpkin."

"Good morning Leah, how did you sleep?"

"I slept great, definately better than a hospital bed."

I laughed dryly at her attempt at humor and we just stared at each other for a few moments, all sorts of questions burning behind my gaze. She finally broke the silence by saying. 

"I don't know why I'm here... I just remember being in alot of pain and then... I'm at your doorstep buck naked."

"This is.... no. It doesn't matter, all that matters is your here."

I then reached out and caressed her face, she placed a hand on mine and smiled softly before she pulled me in for a kiss.

We got out of bed rather late and freshened up, since it was a sunday, I didn't have to go to work since I'm a math teacher. 

She helped me clean out the house which was currently had beer cans and food wrappers laying about. I turned on the TV as a cleaned the living room, the news channel tuned on. 

"-cal woman has been arrested on the charge of 1st degree murder for the brutal stabbing of her boyfriend. When asked about why she did so, she said and I quote 'My brother was very hungry.'. Her brother had die-"

"Can you help me with something Darell?"

Leah asked, she had crept up on me as I focused on the TV. I turned her and said. 

"Of course dear, what's the matter?"

"I'm really hungry, can you get us some supplies?"

"No problem, Let me grab my wallet and head out."

I headed out to my car and ran into my neighbor, Sandra. She was currently on her front lawn checking her mail box. I was rather close to the woman since she was good friends with my wife when she was still alive. As I walked over she greeted me first. 

"Good morning Darell."

"Good morning Sandra, how did you sleep?"

"I slept rather well though something strange happened last night."

"What happened?"


"Its might sound like a delusion from a sleepy mind but late last night, this... figure lightly knocked on my bedroom window. At first I thought it was a potential burglar or something but after the first knock I didn't hear anyother sounds, After a few minutes, I finally gather my courage and peeked out my window but I saw no one, so i thought it was nothing until I heard a very faint whisper. 'Sandy' it said, it was my mom's voice. I immediately went back to my window but there was nothing there. I just convinced myself I heard wrong but... it still unsettled me deeply."

I knew Sander's mother died when she was just 15, my mood became slightly down trodden. I then said. 

"I'm sorry to hear that Sandra."

"Its fine, so where are you heading to so early in the morning?"

"I want to restock some supplies"

"Okay, Later then. Remember, if you need anything I'm always here."

"I know Sandra, thank you very much by the way I really appreciate it."

We then said our goodbyes and I headed to the store.

I spent the day with Leah at home, we made a meal together and had fun while at it. As we sat and ate dessert while watching a movie, Leah suddenly held her stomach and cried out in pain. 

I turned to her in distress but there was nothing i could do, after a few moments, she let go with beads of sweat running down her face. 

"I'm okay now Darell."

"No your not. We need to get you to a hospital Leah."

"And tell them what?"

I fell silent at that, she then said with a forced smile. 

"I... just felt a little queeze is all. Maybe its just menstral cramps from hell."

I took a deep breath and asked her something which has been nagging me for most of the day. 

"Are you still hungry Leah? Be honest with me."

She frowned slightly at that before she sighed and said. 

"Yes Darell, I'm starving." 

This made my heart sink, she had been practically stuffing her face the entire day, if she was still hungry then there was no logical explanation. I then leaned in and asked softly. 

"Have you been having any particular cravings?"

She licked her lips and replied. 

"Yes, You... smell really really good right now."
