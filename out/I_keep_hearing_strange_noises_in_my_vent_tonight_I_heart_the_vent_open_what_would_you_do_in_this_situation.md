Me and my parents moved to the suburbs in south carolina and ever since we moved I have heard strange noises in the vent every night and sometimes even in my kitchen downstairs
Our ventilation system runs through the top of my house from the bathroom to my parents room to my room the vent opens at the top of the bathroom and the system is big it’s as wide as a human.

Every night I hear something crawling through the vents sometimes I hear murmurs when I walk through my neighborhood people tell me stories about this neighborhood being exposed to a lot of crime and murders, my friend billy who lives across the street told me his grandma got killed in her own house by a 33 year old man.  

Today I was eavesdropping at school and I heard a group of 3 kids talking about something called phrogging where someone is living in your house without you knowing, the thought of that creeped me out so much that I walked away. Tonight my parents were going out to dinner for there 26th anniversary I was home alone my mom sent me a list of chores to do like do the dishes take the trash out and more, as usual I heard noises coming from my vents so I went outside to take out the trash when I came back in I heard something open…


I didn’t know what it was but after that I heard walking upstairs I walked toward my bat that I use for baseball so that I would be armed for what happens next I walked towards my bathroom and suddenly I was knocked out when I woke up I saw a middle aged man in front of me he had a hair patches on the sides and the top of his head like trevor phillips from gta and he had a short beard he had a deep voice that was a little raspy and he said to me “say a word to your parents and I will stab you in your sleep” and he walked back upstairs.

Later my parents were home they walked upstairs to me and I knew that the man was listening to me so I wrote on a piece of paper I had from my room and I wrote “there’s a man in our vents and he threatened to kill me if I told you guys” suddenly my dad had an angry look on his face I told him not to do it and I tried to calm him down so he would just call the police and that is what we did suddenly the police arrived and detained the man in my vents. 

We later figured out that he has been doing this for years and he has murdered 4 people before coming into our house right before we moved he had been hiding there for months and came out at night for food and water and crawled back in later.


Me and my mom have been trying to convince my dad to move because we never want to experience something like that again.
would you guys move out in this situation?
