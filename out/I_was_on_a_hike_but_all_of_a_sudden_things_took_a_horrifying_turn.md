My name is Joe Nazadouche. When I was around fourteen years old, my parents, brother Zack, sister Mia and I were on a camping trip. Zack was 12, and Mia was 8. We were camping in a forest since the only campsites in the province were all full. One day, my parents decided we should go hiking. I didn't really want to go hiking, but seeing as I aso didn't really care, I agreed. Me, Zack, and Mia followed my parents onto a trail. 

As the hike began, everything was fine. I ventured through the trees, looking up at the blue sky, listening to the birds chirping, and feeling the wind in my hair. My parents were chatting away, saying how nice it was to be outside. My siblings and I didn't really talk. Zack was just walking in silence, breathing it in, just like I was, while Mia whined about not wanting to be there, and she was being ignored. 

As we walked a bit further, the warm, happy trail began to gradually descend into darkness. The sky went from a bright blue to a pale gray, the trees turned from green oak and birch trees to dead and slowly dying trees, and the grass turned yellow and dead as we trudged on. 

"Something's off,"  I said. No one seemed to hear me, and continued on like nothing happened. We kept on going, and suddenly came to a clearing. But it wasn't a bright green, blue sky area like the first section of the hike. The sky had turned blood red, the trees black and dead. The sun was invisible and the grass was still yellow and dead. 

"Mom? Dad? Where are we?" I asked. "We're just in a clearing, Joe. It's fine." my dad replied. Joe could see it on their faces as plain as day- it was **not fine**. 

Suddenly, I saw a face. A pale, white, inhuman face. Its eyes were blood red, and they peered right into my soul. Zack looked shocked, he could see it too. Mia stopped whining and her jaw dropped as she looked into the creature's eyes. My parents? 

All of a sudden, I heard it. A blood-curdling scream. I looked over. Zack and Mia were still there. I let out a sigh of relief. I looked in the other direction, thinking I'd see my parents, but no.

*My parents were gone.* My eyes frantically darted around. I did not see my parents anywhere. And then we heard it again. *More screams. And maniacal laughter.* I then remembered the face. My eyes shot over to where we had seen the face. Oh, god. It was smiling. And it was walking. Towards us. 

The creature looked menacing. It had long, skinny arms, and it had four long, skinny legs. We decided to step back and try to run. As we ran, we figured out that there was no hope for us, as it was three times faster than us. Thankfully for me, I was faster than Zack and Mia, but sadly for Mia, she was snatched up by the monster, skinned and eaten. The monster tore her open. It was terrifying. 

Zack and I ran like we'd never ran before. Out of the eerie red clearing, through the gray area, and out into the warm, bright and sunny area. The monster had been following us, but we were farther away, so it couldn't see us. We managed to make it out of the trail alive, and we sprinted back to camp

Miraculously, we spotted a groundskeeper nearby, and called out to him. He was happy to help us, and    we explained our problem and how we needed to get home immediately. The groundskeeper took us to our grandmother's house, as our parents were missing. He dropped us off and told us that he would come back with our stuff. 

Even after my body had recovered, my mind did not. Every single day, I could never get the experience out of my head. Now I'm 36 years old and I still can't forget it. Thankfully my parents were not killed by the monster, and they made it out alive. They ran as soon as they saw the face of the monster, but did not tell us because they didn't want to attract its attention. I have no idea how I survived and how Zack survived.
