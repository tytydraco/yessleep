20 years ago, when I was 5 we moved to the town of Banana. Yeah really, Banana. I won’t go into too much detail, but it was a small dying town where the population maxed out at roughly a thousand (if that), and where the only chain that existed was a dollar general. Every other building in town was either little mom and pop businesses or houses that slowly disappeared behind curtains of forest the deeper you went. For the entirety of my life there it was a boring and at times miserable experience.

We moved to Banana to be closer to my maternal Grandmother, since she had health issues and my mom wanted to make sure to help care for her as needed. Our house was nestled in the woods just outside of town, woods so dense that if you walked a few steps past our driveway you’d have a hard time seeing our house through the thickets. The house itself was moderately sized, big enough for me to have my own room and for us to have a spare to use as a guest room. My bedroom and the guest room were connected by a small bathroom, something that will be important later. 

The first few days there were exciting to my young over-imaginative brain. I’d spend hours combing our house and yard searching for what hidden treasures this new land would hold for me, but I’d be disappointed by just how little there was to see beyond the rare sighting of a wild animal or discoveries of forgotten balls and trinkets. 

Once I started elementary, I also found that there was barely anything to do outside of school. I had friends for sure, but playdates weren’t something that could happen every day and neighboring houses were separated by dense forest and hidden away making it hard for me to meet any of the neighbors kids to hang out with. I guess my parents felt bad for the sudden change of lifestyle we once had living in the city, and decided the best solution to help cure my growing loneliness was to get a dog. 

I came home one day to be surprised by the excited kisses of a puppy when I opened our front door. He was about 10 weeks old, and a mix of Bluetick Coonhound and Labrador Retriever which left his coat looking like an odd Jackson pollock of browns, blacks, and whites. His name was Champ, and he instantly became my best friend. 

Like my shadow, he would follow me everywhere and we’d spend hours playing in the yard. I convinced my parents to let him sit at the table with us while we ate, making sure he had his own chair at the table and at night he’d always sleep in my room curled up next to me like a living pillow. He even saved me once from a cottonmouth that had found itself in our yard. He caught it in his teeth and thrashed it around until it turned limp after he saw it slithering towards me. I loved that dog so damn much. 

And when he went missing it was one of the most devastating moments of my childhood. 

I was 7 at the time. I had been at school that day and after the bus dropped me off, was looking forward to another afternoon playing with my dog. Instead of the usual excited licking or barking from Champ greeting me at our door, I found my mom and dad waiting for me seated in our living room. Instantly I knew something had happened to him, and for the rest of the week my eyes were bruised and swollen from crying. We put posters up everywhere we could think, on telephone poles, facebook, in gas stations, and some mom and pop places even let up put them up inside their stores. 

We were hoping someone had seen Champ somewhere, and I prayed my heart out every night that I’d wake up to his wet nose against my cheek whining for me to get up like he always did. But, time went on and there was no sign of him to be seen. Eventually I moved past it, my parents offered to get us a new dog but I didn’t want one, it felt wrong and disrespectful to him and I knew I wouldn’t love another dog as much as I did him. And for four years we lived without him, me (11 at the time) spending most of my free time either alone playing in our yard or spent with friends whenever I could see them. 

And then, one night, he came back. 

We had just finished dinner, my mom washing dishes in the sink while my dad was storing leftovers, and I was busy playing on my Gameboy Advanced in our living room. I heard my mom gasp and a glass break, my dad immediately asking her what happened when I heard her say 

“Is that… oh my god look!” 

My dad went quiet and then immediately called out to me to come quick. I threw my Gameboy aside, worried for what exactly was going on when I saw out the kitchen window what my parents were looking at. 

Out in our front yard, partly illuminated by the glow of our windows in the night, was Champ. He stood on the cobblestone walkway 8 or so feet from the front door, staring at it. Immediately I ran to the door, my parents close behind, threw it open and ran to Champ. My dad caught me by my shoulder before I could make it however.

“Hang on buddy, let me check to make sure he isn’t hurt.” 

I could see he was almost as excited as I was, but he also looked cautious. I understand now obviously, Champ could have been hurt, rabid, or just scared and my dad didn’t want me to accidentally get hurt too, but I was so anxious to wrap my arms around my dog. I watched as my dad cautiously approached Champ, holding his hand out. 

“Hey boy, you remember me?” 

My dad asked as he lowered himself to Champs level. He had gotten bigger since he was gone, not a lot but enough that he stood at about waist level with my dad who was 6’ 4” where he had once stood at his thigh. Champ turned his head to look at my dad, his eyes reflecting the light from our doorway in a way that made them gently glow, and lowered his head for a pat. My dad put his hand on Champ’s head, and once he realized that Champ wasn’t hurt, let me at him. 

My parents watched in joy as I held and sobbed into Champs fur. My mom kept crying and saying things like how much of a miracle it was, while my dad wondered where Champ had been for so long. They were both astonished he found his way back, whereas I didn’t care at all and just accepted the reality that he was here with me again. And at the time it really seemed like he was just as happy to be back, he was literally shaking in my arms. 

That night we gave champ a bath and spent the evening in the living room all of us together, finally whole again. I remember being so happy, it didn’t bother me that Champ didn’t show any of his usual excited and childlike traits. He spent the majority of the time just sitting and watching us, which I figured was him just taking in his home again. And just like when I was hugging him, each time I ran my hands through his fur or rubbed his head, his body shook. I worried he was cold but my dad and mom told me he likely was just readjusting to his environment and didn’t know how to show his excitement. When I went to bed a few hours later, now with him at back at my side, it was like my heart was whole again.

But unlike what my mom and dad assumed, he didn’t go back to his old self. He regained some of his old traits, like following me around constantly and sitting at the table when we ate, but he wouldn’t wag his tail as much as he used to or even bark really. He would lick every now and then, but they were slower and dragged on the skin, not the quick excited kisses he used to give. He’d constantly watch us, his eyes shifting to whoever was talking at the time, like he was following the conversation. And he still shook when you touched him, or when he would lay next to me at night. I wrote the shaking off as excitement of some kind, and I still think it was, but not in a good way. 

There was also the whining. 

He didn’t do it much, rarely at all at first, but when we were alone in the yard or laying in my bed at night I’d be able to notice a low whine. Slowly he would get a bit louder with his whining, and there’d be nights he’d do it right next to my ear. I remember once turning and looking at him when he did it, and I was honestly scared for a moment because he was staring right at me while he whined. But I rubbed his head and told him to go back to sleep, though that usually didn’t work. 

One night, I finally got enough of it. It had been several nights of rough sleep due to his whining at this point and I guess it stacked up. This quiet version of him that seemed more curious than playful made my heartache for what had been. And when he started doing that noise in my ear again I finally had enough and got out of bed. He did too, standing up and following me like he used to, but when I got to the door to gesture him to leave, he just stood there looking at me. 

“Go on boy, out the door.” I told him. He stood there still, slightly shaking. I felt a twinge of guilt denying him from sleeping with me, but I persisted.

“Hey! Come on boy, I said out. Now. We can play tomorrow.” 

Finally, Champ cautiously walked out, staring at me the whole time. I closed the door, locking it instinctually. As I was getting back into bed however, I started hearing claws on my door. Champ was scratching desperately, and making a low whining noise. I tried to ignore it, but at one point I had enough.

“Go away, I’m not letting you in!”. 

When I said that, he stopped clawing at the door. I thought he had obeyed until I heard fur brush against the door and noticed the whine get a bit louder. Except this time, I swear the whine sounded more like a whisper.

“Hey.”

“Hey.”

I felt my blood run cold. I didn’t move from my bed, my mind muddy with confusion. 

“You. In. Letting.” 

“Boy. Come. Out. Play.”

The words sounded slightly high pitched, but warped. Like he was trying to speak but they were catching on his tongue in his throat. 

“Boy.”

“Boy.”

I don’t know when he stopped, I think I passed out before he finished, but I remember waking up to my mom knocking on my door and asking me why I locked Champ out. I told her Champ is making weird noises at night and keeping me up, and that I don’t want him staying in my room anymore. She looked slightly hurt, not at me but I think more because she remembered when I had loved Champ so deeply and was sad that I was moving on from him. But I think in some ways she also understood, since I think I hadn’t been the only one getting a bit irritated with the new Champ. 

There were plenty of times my mom shooed him away after she got tired of him watching her while she cleaned the dishes, or had scolded him when he had opened pantry doors or drawers in the kitchen. Dad was pissed when he saw the scratch marks Champ had left on my door, he had stripped paint away from how long he had scratched. My dad wrote it off that he was probably anxious about not being near me since he had been gone so long, but at this point I wasn’t so sure. I tried to explain to them that he had spoken, and even show them, but he never did it around them so of course they didn’t believe me. I had started to fear Champ a bit. 

A bit of time passed after that night, and slowly I stopped acknowledging him when I would come home from school. His licks made my skin crawl, and even when he’d lay next to me I could feel his eyes on me. I started to soend most of my time in my room and he’d sit and wait at my door. 

I also started locking him out of my room every night, and he would still whine, but never really speak. There were times he would wait in my room to try to sleep with me, but I would instead sleep in the guest room if that happened, and when I did he’d just scratch on the guest door instead. Every now and then would I hear him whisper, and he’d say things like: 

“Hey. Boy. Me. Want. You. Come. Out. Me. Want. You. Go. Outside.”

Or

“Hey. Boy. Come. Here. Me. Want. You. Look. Outside. Play. We. Play. Outside.”

I told my parents less than a month after he first whispered words to me, and just about four months after he had been back, that I don’t know if I can handle Champ anymore. I asked them if we could take him somewhere else. And normally I think most parents wouldn’t be so willing to agree, but my parents had also grown annoyed of Champ’s habits in their own ways. It was decided that the next day my dad would take him to the nearest shelter. I remember when I came out of their room after the conversation, Champ had been standing right outside the door.

That night, I tried to hang out with Champ a bit. I did feel horrible that we were going to get rid of him, but I think it was more because I’d come to realize my dog was never going to come back. He had been lost since he first disappeared two years ago. I walked in my room, closed the door on Champ as he started moving to try to come in, and got ready for bed. By this point I would always make sure I locked my door since he sometimes would accidentally, or perhaps purposely jiggle the handle while he clawed, and I didn’t want to risk him coming in. 

I waited for the usual clawing to start, but it never did. And as I sat waiting for the worst, I eventually went to sleep. 

Click. Click. 

I don’t know what time it was, but I know it was past midnight when I heard claws at the door handle. I scoffed, turning over to ignore them, when I realized the clawing wasn’t coming at my bedroom door. 

Click. Click.

Id always lock the bedroom door, since that’s where he usually clawed, but my skin turned cold when I realized he was clawing from behind the bathroom door. I’d never had to worry about it, since he’d have to get through the guest room door and it’s bathroom door to get to mine, but that wasn’t possible..

Creeeeeaaak. 

I saw the briefest glimpse of Champ in the moonlight when he opened my bathroom door. He was walking on his hind legs, and I could tell he was wobbling a bit from the unsteady steps of his unbalanced body. 

And I could also see he was shaking so much. 

I closed my eyes and covered my head with my covers before he fully entered my room, praying he didn’t see me awake. 

Tap. Tap…. Tap…Tap. 

His footsteps clattered against the wood floor. They were getting closer to my bed. 

Tap…. Tap. Tap. Tap….

And it was now that I could hear, the first time since he had come back, that he was panting. 

There were no more footsteps, it felt like hours of silence when it had likely been no more than thirty seconds when I heard a voice.

“Hey. Hey. Boy. You. I. See.” 

My body was struck with rictus from terror. I didn’t dare move. 

“Hey. Hey.”

“Come. Out. I. See. Boy. You. Sleep?” 

“Hey.”

I felt a shivering paw touch my head through the blanket covering me.

“Hey.” 

“Hey. Look. Here. Me.” 

“I. Want. Show. You. Outside. Forest.” 

“Wake. Up. Look. Me.”

His last sentence sounded like it was spoken through chattering teeth. Even from under the covers I could hear how violently he was shaking. Tears streamed down my face, I know I was whimpering from fear. He pawed a bit at my covers, trying to get them off my head but I kept holding them so tightly. 

“I. Know. You. Awake.“ 

I didn’t answer. 

Things got quiet after that, and stayed so for the longest time. I started to think he had left until i heard nails click on the floor.

“Sun. Rises.”

“Lucky. Boy.”

After that, i heard it walk away from my bed.  Its nails tapping away through my bathroom, through the guest room and into the hall. After that I heard the sound of the front door unlock, after a few minutes of scratching, and the door swing open. 

I stayed in bed, shivering until the sun rose and my mom and dad came into my room, alarmed that the front door had been left open last night somehow, and asking me if I did it. However I think the look on my face and the faint claw marks on the bathroom door leading to my room, made them think otherwise. It took a long time for me to settle down from that night, for the rest of my time in that house I’d make sure every door and window was locked tight. 

We didn’t stay at the house much longer, we were out by the end of the month. I think my parents knew that Champ had opened the door and left, but I don’t think they understood how or wanted to. But it didn’t matter, I was happy that we were leaving. Whatever that thing was, it definitely wasn’t a dog, even at my age I knew that much and I couldn’t stand thinking that it was still out there watching us all the way until the day we loaded the last box and left. 

Even now, I wonder if the thing that acted like my dog Champ is still out there, and if it’s still waiting for the chance to take me out to the woods.
