**Part 1: The Summoning**

Okay take a deep breath and then picture a demon. Not just any but the ultimate killing machine. A demon that doesn’t speak and carries a black sword with serrated edges. A pale grey, burnt, scaly humanoid with a mouth full of shark teeth. Armored from head to toe in steel, with a long flowing cape. Basically, an indestructible tank that feels no pain or pity. His burning reptilian-like eyes rip a hole through your chest and grip your soul like the invisible hand of Fatima. Imagine standing there frozen in overwhelming terror. You can feel it in your bones. A slight tingle urging you to gather whatever strength you have left and make a run for it. Your last frantic burst of thought reaches beyond the grave and clings on to hope right before everything goes dark.

The wicked demon you just imagined is a very special class unique to the underworld called a **Legate.** They fall under one of the four Greater Demonic Houses: The Undead Legion. (The other three houses that serve Lyrael, and his fallen generals include: the Angelic Fallen, the Dark Order, and the Unholy Nameless Masses.) A legate’s mission is to lead the hellish army into victorious battle, during the final fight between good and evil.

The process of becoming a legate depends on several factors. I hope you are ready to begin because the journey will be taxing and some of you might not make it through the first few pages of this grueling bio. Always remember. A strategic mind isn’t simply thrown into the fire for all eternity. It is tested by the fire and if it survives than the thing that comes out on the other side is usually this twisted, broken metaphysical, metaphorical tempered steel. *Only* after the flames of damnation have scorched the mind, can the mind be quenched by the hellish legionary army into a hardened weapon of unfathomable destruction.

This isn’t even half the battle! The process of becoming a legate requires a literal sacrifice. A vampire who’s willing to throw themselves into a transformation process that is not at all for the faint of heart. So, if you are faint of heart, the journey ends here for you. If not, let us start by joining the Church of the New Faith. You are a postulant and must speak to an unholy priest to become a neophyte. A neophyte is a true believer in New Faith doctrine. Someone worthy who has received unholy communion on more than one occasion. A postulant must prove their piety to the antichurch by taking the plunge into the dark waters of blasphemous blood baptism.

Humans can join the church but to become a legate you must be a vampire and a neophyte. Why? Because only vampires are strong enough to work for the militant wing of the Dark Order. You are someone who’s both strong and a vampire. After several months of getting accustomed to the bizarre, ritualistic nature of the Unholy Church, you are ready to take the next step. And so, you speak to the thaumaturge at your local antichurch. He will decide if you are worthy enough to be promoted to the rank of *initiate.* This is a critical special position held by those who serve the Dark Order. It separates you from those who only worship at its New Faith churches.

If you show that you are responsible and can be saddled with certain menial duties, like ushering neophytes, antichurch security, and assisting with unholy communion, you can become an acolyte or proselyte. Proselytes are the ecclesiastical initiates and acolytes are the martial initiates. We will ignore the former and focus on our primary subject—the acolyte trainees. By becoming an acolyte, you are giving up your old life for a new one of servitude and piety to the New Faith and to the Dark Order that protects it.

The gravity of your decision weighs heavily on you. It took you a week to decide to say goodbye to everything you ever loved and knew. After one epic going away party, you turn yourself in to the local church. You will be processed and given quarters within G-HUN, which is this massive, global underground network of tunnels, bunkers, and facilities the Illuminati and New World Government maintains. It is the perfect place to carry out their evil schemes because it is away from the prying eyes of the conspiratorial public and annoying Angelic Holy Order.

You must harden your mind and body for combat and perform your duties with faith and devotion for several years before you will even be considered as a possible **“vessel of rebirth.”** How an acolyte is selected for Rebirth is an extreme state secret. All that is known for sure is that every candidate must be handpicked by a legate. One who remembers how well you’ve oppressed aggressive naysayers and jubilant agitators while on covert operations. Most acolytes will never know the honor of Rebirth. You are not one of those weaklings. Your bravery and faith stood out early and often. Because of this, you have been summoned before a legate. He stirs from stone-sleep with red, beaming eyes that pierce into the darkness like fire sabers. He beckons you deeper into his resurrection chamber. A boney, scaled gray hand reaches out from the gothic bio-casket and gives you a sealed letter. He demands in a harsh, dry tone from years of deep sleep, that you *“take this to the warlock”* at the nearest antichurch.

Over the years you have tasted a great deal of battle and gained a great deal of skill and experience because of it. You have become a powerful soldier for the New Faith, one who’s known for performing their duties without failure and without pity. You were led to victory by legates and even managed to befriend a few of these rare demons. Victory often brings out the comradery in people; the wicked are no different. Victory against who? Countless rogue vampire scum, cocky guardian angel cohorts, and terrible, highly classified \[Lv4\] Above Top Secret\] spectral “gateway” horrors—all have been crushed under your boot in the name of the new order. This was an exciting time in your life that flew by like a hawk in the sky searching for prey. And you were grateful for every moment of it. You smile and think about that split second decision to join the Dark Order and how much it has impacted you. How much you’ve matured and become stronger.

The whisper campaign has begun amongst unholy priests and the patrician families that faithfully support the New Faith Church. Your name comes up, again and again, in conversation as a possible “vessel of rebirth” candidate. To obtain this is every acolyte’s darkest dream. The life you’ve lived past to present was all for this moment. The day when your exceptional fighting skills, natural leadership qualities, and unflinchingly loyalty to “the Cause” finally paid off.

That day comes several weeks later. You have been selected by the “powers that be.” I use that phrase because no one knows how “vessels” are chosen. It is a closely guarded secret within the super clandestine antichurch hierarchy. That’s the good news. The bad news is that your ordeal is far from over. You might even say it just started. The process you knew as becoming a “vessel of rebirth.” The official name for it is: **Unholy Sanctification**. A term coined by DPI when a “vessel of rebirth” begins their unholy journey towards final ascension.

Before we can further discuss why government officials call it Unholy Sanctification, we should probably wade through a few more clerical matters. First and foremost, who are these so called “powers that be” who helped thrust you onto the path of becoming a legate? The answer is top secret. Well. Let’s just say rumors of your heroic deeds have made it all the way back to the Dark Lord himself. Agents from his Unholiness’ court in Moldovia will summon the elusive “Witch Queen” from her icy chambers and share with her the news. She will then be asked to tap into her “crystal ball” with a form of black magic and divination long forbidden by the Holy Order during the Atlantean era. Astrological charts will be consulted, and vatic visions deciphered. After which, the Witch Queen will send out what is essentially a letter of recommendation to the warlock from the appropriate church district (NEWGOD).

The warlock will grumble about the decision while dressing in his finest cassock, cancel all of his future appointments, and board a flight to church headquarters in \[Redacted\]. Once there, he will have to sit through half a dozen meetings on unrelated antichurch matters before an official unholy conclave will be commissioned. He will not be invited inside of course. Only high-ranking patricians and blood bishops are allowed to participate in conclaves. After several hours of waiting around for it to conclude, the warlock will be summoned inside to hear the verdict on the question of your Rebirth. A “no” would mean less paperwork and a much quicker return to his normal duties. The vote was narrow, but they have decided that you are indeed worthy of the honor. The flustered warlock will thank the council for their verdict before leaving so that he can get a jumpstart on the headache of hunting down one of the four church lictors, who seem to never be in their office when you need them. For the sake of this example, we’ll go with Ark Haven’s antichurch representative: Lictor Erik Wineblood from [“The Story of Emma Summers.”](https://www.reddit.com/u/RingoCross99/s/noCVgSjVp8)

Your fate will be solely in Erik’s hands after the warlock meets with him and reveals the unholy conclave’s formal opinion on Rebirth. He has the power to dismiss it out of hand or humor your disgruntled warlock advocate’s claims. Let’s say he does feel sorry for you, for the sake of argument, of course. He will then arrange a private meeting of the minds between your disgruntled warlock advocate and Ark Haven—the demon lord he serves. This meeting may take some time to arrange considering Ark Haven might be unavailable. He could be away doing anything from handling DPI business, gathering intel from one of his angelic contacts in the Holy Order, giving counsel to the United Stated president or his NWGO “shadow president” counterpart, engaged in the cruel hunt for vampire blood, or he could be in hell visiting Hannael.

Speaking of being engaged in the hunt, you can read [“There’s Something Far Worse than Vampires”](https://www.reddit.com/u/RingoCross99/s/nxALXWW5tc) to get an idea of what I mean about how eerily similar *your* selection process is to the one used when selecting some sad sap to feed on whenever the demon lords try in vain to satiate their insatiable demand for vampire blood. Remember: all five demon lords need the blood of vampires just as much, if not more, than vampires need the blood of humans. The only difference between this selection process and yours is that yours comes with a happy ending. If you can call what happens to you a “happy ending.”

The meeting will conclude after a few hours. You will not be told much by Ark Haven’s lictor as they rarely deal with low-ranking vampires such as yourself. Lictor’s are patrician vampires who hold a considerable amount of sway given the nature of their profession. What the hell is a lictor and why are they so influential? Real fast, a lictor is basically a glorified church appointed secretary. They manage affairs on behalf of their absent (fallen angel) master, regarding all matters Church of New Faith related. There’s a ton of paperwork and ceremonies involved when dealing with the procedural driven antichurch. As you can imagine, the fallen lords are not about to sit around and sign a bunch of documents, approve clerical promotions, or hand out death warrants. That is what their lictor is for and *this* is why they have an inordinate amount of influence in the vampire underworld. Anyway, so like I said, Erik will not say much. He will simply tell you to meet him at a secret site underneath one of the major antichurch cathedrals. And you better be prepared to fight. He will reiterate this and also that it’s not too late for you to back out. So, my friend, if you want to stop reading this, you better do it now. Last chance, before things get dark.

**Part 2: Unholy Benediction**

Inside the dimly lit chamber, you glance around to see that you are surrounded by candles, strange glowing glyphs, ornate half-crumbled columns, and vivid gothic masonry you’ve never seen before. You can barely make out the artwork carved into the floor. Interesting. Whatever it is, it appears almost Atlantean in nature and beauty. The details are shocking, and you’d like nothing more than to ask about this place. Sadly, you have very little time to marvel at the ancient angelic architecture that surrounds you. Ark Haven is already there waiting for you. You know this because he calls out to you in that cool collected tone he’s known for. You shudder at the thought of fighting the shirtless figure in slacks as he slowly approaches you wielding a baroque backsword.

Ark Haven is the most mysterious fallen lord. His slick dark hair is combed back. His face chiseled and expressionless. He rarely participates in anything Dark Order related. No one knows why the Devil tolerates his machinations. Rumor has it, he knows something that the others don’t. A secret about the universe the Devil needs to know if he’s going to win this new rebellion against God. But tonight is altogether different. Tonight, he will be your **Examiner** as you take the first step towards your quest for Unholy Sanctification. For reasons we’ll never know, he decided that you were the perfect vampire to test his skills on. That’s right... all you are to him is a glorified punching bag. Something to keep him honest and his predatory nature sharp.

You grip your longsword with both hands in eagerness and readiness. The fight against him is called: *“Final Testament by Confession.”* The name is very misleading because the fallen lord will play the part of examiner and literally beat a “final” confession out of you. For some reason, demon lords like pummeling vampires into the ground and then dropping the word “ritual” on top of the ashes. The first rate shellacking you receive is eerily similar to the fabled “Unholy Sacrament of Fire” our favorite hero-villain, William Chosen, went through in the novella Angel Hunters Part 2. Only difference is that his beating was far worse… so much so it was only allowed to be conducted by Lord Jurael due to the serious religious underpinnings tied to his ordeal.

In other words, everything had to go right. No one cares if yours went wrong. You are a brave but expendable acolyte, not the main um hero-villain. Be thankful for your luck! Ark Haven is the best fallen lord to fight in ritual combat. He’s not hot-tempered like Hannael, dogmatic like Jurael, or even worse, sociopathic like Sarahiel. Oof. Just Imagine drawing that short straw. I hate to be vulgar, but you would be “royally fucked.” No one survives their fights with her.

If the encounter with said demon lord goes well, meaning you aren’t outright killed during your final confession, the next phase in your quest for Unholy Sanctification will begin. This step is an unholy sacrament known as **“Purification.”** It is a form of *dark* *sanctification* for you (or religious observance for neophyte churchgoers) that is used to purge the old soul in wake of the new one. Minus all the religious jargon, in layman’s terms, what it does is turn you into an empty vessel ready to be infiltrated by a powerful soldier demon. What it does for neophytes is provide spiritual purification through *confirmation* and doctrinal testimony about two prior vampire-to-demon rebirths that involved the legendary brothers: Acolyte Aanos and Acolyte Banos.

Your **Mark** of Identifying Numbers Card, or “Mark” for short, will be wrenched from your fingers. Trust me, you won’t be needing it anymore for where you’re going. You will be stripped of all weapons, blindfolded, and then taken to level \[Redacted\] of Bunker 17. Yup. The exact same underground shelter from the short story [“The Adventure Games.”](https://www.reddit.com/u/RingoCross99/s/rxUXEjUowA) Bunker 17 is the North American headquarters for G-HUN. (Global Hemisphere Underground Network.) This massive facility has many underground levels. It is also the place where the NWGO conducts many of their most classified \[Lv5: E\] experiments. Rumor has it they keep their doomsday device on the final level, but this can neither be confirmed or denied.

The level of Bunker 17 you are on is redacted. It is a \[Lv4\] classified area with a state-of-the-art laboratory, casket chambers, and a final containment area. This level is strategically placed right above another highly classified level just in case any of the \[Redacted\] escape. The process of purification begins in this laboratory with the help of DPI techs and the AI Matrix.

**Part 3: Sentience**

The **AI Matrix** is an advance quantum computing artificial intelligence that takes on the persona of the late Doctor Susan Jane using a virtual avatar matrix that can interact in four-dimensional space. Doctor Jane helped develop the critical early part of the program but died in an accident years later before it was advanced on a subatomic scale. She also pioneered a tech called neuro mapping. It is essentially a way for the human consciousness to live on after death by having your brain downloaded or “mapped” inside her AI Matrix Core. The key to full sentience is for the deceased person’s brain to not just be computerized, but to have a full body holographic avatar. These factors make Jane the only human to become a Sentient AI. This is a misnomer, however. Since sentient artificial intelligences or “SAI” are **AI personas** like Nano, who come directly from her **Ultimate Simulation Program.** She created this \[Lv6: EE\] classified fully autonomous program some years later after dying and becoming the AI Master Administrator. Doctor Jane is the only human being to have ever been resurrected or turned into a fully sentient AI. The tech/process is crazy expensive so she will likely be the only person to be uploaded for a while.

Side note: Why aren’t the rich using this tech? Because it is crazy expensive and crazy classified! The resources it took just to upload Doctor Jane were considerable. Her case was an exception because she is possibly one of the most brilliant minds in human history. It also paid off because now that she has integrated with the AI Matrix, she essentially operates and oversees all of G-HUN as well as most international underground shelters and projects. The Ultimate Simulation she created after becoming a fully sentient AI has taken NWGO R&D to another level unachievable by our monkey brains. The total cost to convert her was an estimated \[Redacted\] trillion in unaccounted for spending. So outside of the ungodly cost. Human ingenuity is not needed due to the godlike intelligences inside of her Ultimate Simulation; a topic that deserves its own bio.

How does any of this relate to legates? Well. A legate is a demon. And a demon is an organic being with no soul (like the ones humans have) or celestial essence (like the ones angels have). This is why they cannot sustain themselves on earth as explained in the bio I made about the demonic species. This is where Doctor Susan Jane comes into play. Not her kid clone in Nero 0X, but the actual adult version who died in an accident. She was a prodigy scientist who pioneered several crucial techs core to the Illuminati/NWGO. One is neural mapping—the taking of a biological brain and mapping it into digital format so that it can then be uploaded into the AI Matrix Core for safekeeping or into her Ultimate Simulation for ascension. Her brain was the first to be mapped using this pioneer procedure. She is now fully sentient and represented by a lifelike virtual and holographic avatar matrix that looks exactly like her when she was 47.

**Part 4: Rebirth**

Let’s return to you, our chosen vampire acolyte faith-warrior and your mission to become something greater. Okay so we left off with you surviving your Final Testament by Confession, which was a glorified sparring match, where you got to see how long you could survive against a fallen lord before confessing your sins. After that you were blindfolded, sedated, and then dragged away to Bunker 17. A battery of physical and psychological tests will be performed by DPI techs before you are officially initiated into the **Phoenix Program.** This is the name of the life altering demonic rebirth program, where you go from vampire to legate. It was signed into law as Executive Action \[Redacted\] under the **Protocol 7 Initiative** by the president of the United States**.**

We have to say goodbye to you for a long time. You will be celebrated by the Dark Order for your faith and sacrifice to the Cause. It’s been one hell of a journey, and we are still nowhere near finished. You will eventually be put into fugue stasis when the time comes for your mind to be erased. Worry not. Your vitals will be closely guarded during the entire process by some of the best scientific minds humanity has to offer. The process itself takes time, but not much, only about seven months. It could be done much sooner, but prior failures have shown that removing memories too abruptly can cause agitation, possible shock, or other more common complications associated with brain surgery that can lead to death. It can also lead to unnecessary complications for your new user such as severe dissociation, and phantom pain/memories.

\---

**Part 5: Devil Driver**

Now that we’ve said farewell to you, boo! It is time to say hello to our demonic champion, yay! Let us all welcome **Bleda the Hunnic Rune Slayer** to the stage! His name on earth was actually Logan Rockwell, and he did not attain much glory in life to be honest. He did the usual stuff: worked a 9 to 5, raised a few kids, paid his taxes, never cheated on his spouse, and was a decent person overall. Even though he was a nonbeliever, he could have still managed to get into heaven. Sadly, he died in a bizarre slip and fall accident at a hotel during a work convention. It was one of those crazy, one in million tragic type incidents too. It’s a real pity because he had just started to make amends to all the people he had royally screwed over while working at that super shady MLM where his weirdly karmic slip’ n slide death occurred. Conveniently for us, his greedy half-baked scheming is the reason we’re here now in hell able to tell his fiery story!

After his soul drifts down under, it is evaluated by the powers that be before being turned over to a bunch of angry, overworked undead clerics and clerks from the Dark Order. His soul is deemed worthy, which allows him to be brought back into material form where he is immediately given an ultimatum. Join the hellish army or become another mindless, fleshy, broken laborer demon (the wretched). Most people are not given a choice. They are thrown in with the wretched masses of despair demon caste automatically. Whereupon they are forced to toil away in darkness and fire in eternal misery for a meager portion of rotten human meat each day. Logan was lucky. They saw something in him, using whatever secretive divination method dark priests use.

He chooses wisely and joins the Undead Legion as a fresh recruit. He works his way up the ranks slowly but surely by mastering his training and becoming a camp leader. He distinguishes himself with a display of valor during one particularly destructive angelic raid into hellish territory. *We will fast forward his career forty years into the future.* He has now achieved the rank of Hellion. It is the highest rank a legionnaire can hope to achieve. He has received several military stripes called Serpent Fangs, and most importantly, beaten the odds and survived to become a decorated war veteran. The greatest honor he has received was the rare Bladed Crown, which he now wears proudly atop his head. It was given to him by Fallen Lord Hannael in a ceremony eerily similar to the dubbing of a medieval English knight. Then after winning such an award, Bleda will spend a few days at the Weeping Fortress celebrating his triumph with bone mead, rotten meat, and siren songs before returning back to the front lines of the first dimensional plane of hell.

Several months after Bleda receives the Bladed Crown, an unholy conclave confers upon him the ultimate title of Legate. Note: almost every demon who has received the Bladed Crown has gone on to become one. The award has basically become synonymous with demonic ascension to the final rank of legate. So much so, recipients are usually summoned to the Unholy City, which is basically hell’s version of a capitol city and final bastion. Bleda is no different. Once he arrives, he will be led inside Brimstone Castle by a wretched. He will first have to listen to a bunch of dark priests rave on and on, like madman about ordainment and dark prophecy, before he is finally given the details on his conferment. Unlike you, our now sleepless, brainless acolyte volunteer, ascension is not a choice. He will say “yes.” This is made very clear when he is threatened with eternal hellfire by the Fire Lord himself.

\---

**Part 6: the Force**

How does a decorated veteran demon go from being a hellion in hell to a legate on earth? It is crucial to understand that the laws of physics cannot be broken, but they can be cheated. Wormholes are the perfect example of this. Albert Einstein’s famous theory of relativity states that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light. You know the whole E=mc^(2). The equation that has shaped the modern world and stood the test of time. Technically speaking, wormhole travel would mean arriving at a predefined point faster than the speed of light.

Obviously, this is all theoretical since the science behind wormhole traversal/manipulation is still far outside of our capabilities. A more practical example of finding a way around physics would be an airplane. Human beings clearly cannot fly due to biological limitations. Airplanes allow us to “cheat” the system and get from point A to point B. It’s not the greatest example, but you catch my drift. Speaking of drift, how does any of this correlate to Angel Hunters?

There is one major obstacle standing in the way of the Illuminati’s plan for world domination. That pesky law of the conservation of energy we talked about in the **demon bio.** The part where I explained why demons can’t just waltz out of hell at their leisure. And how the vast majority are stuck down there where they belong. Because hell is essentially an entirely different dimensional plane. What does that mean? It means that the physical energy of a person/demon/spirit, or whatever you want to call it, cannot be displaced from point A to point B without completely violating the whole “energy cannot be created or destroyed” thing.

Now that we have that clear. What exactly is the Illuminati doing about the problem? Two things. But before I can explain those two things I have to explain the history behind their secret project. It all starts with the **World Order Agreement.** It is a **Global Initiative** that the fallen angels’ and the world governments signed that’s very similar to a treaty. The initiative hands the Dark Order and the NWGO operational command and practical authority over all doomsday projects.

The biggest program under the WOA umbrella is **Project Final Order.** (The Phoenix Program is part of PFO) The sole purpose of PFO is to find a way to summon the demonic army to earth by any means necessary, in order to usher in the end times. Which, according to New Faith Doctrine, will not bring about the Book of Revelations, but a victorious “Second Great Rebellion.”

A significant amount of progress towards their aims came from the advancements made in particle acceleration. Down in Bunker 17, an entire lower level is dedicated to running experiments with a hydron collider that costs about forty times as much as the LHC used over at CERN. Not only that but it is also twice as compact and powerful, thanks to the use of classified particles and a classified metal that may or may not mimic angelic alloys.

Scientists and engineers at DPI applied the technological advancements made while using their Hydra Hydron Collider (HHC) to the angelic gateway they stole. They also applied Doctor Jane’s advancements in AI. They took her proto-computer simulation technology, combined it with their breakthroughs in subatomic particle acceleration, and came *this* close to reactivating the stolen gateway. Instead, they caused a terrible accident that killed the original Doctor Susan Jane. Her death was a catastrophic lost that took the Illuminati years to recover from. It was the very thing that led to the practical application of neuro mapping technology.

Side note: Notice the sudden rise of “AI” and its rampant use by big tech companies? This is what Doctor Jane created. The government always releases an outdated version of their most prized tech, years later, in order to study its effects on the general population. Nothing happens by chance when dealing with the powers that be. Candidates are preselected and given secret tech, selling their souls to become influential billionaires in return. AI tech is different. It is similar to internet technology in its wild west quality. No one was preselected for either one. Both were kind of thrown out there into the public to see what would happen. Doctor Jane originally created AI tech way back in \[Redacted\] right around the time social media was manufactured.   

Okay. Now with all of that out of the way. There are two methods the forces of evil currently use to circumvent the laws of physics in order to achieve their haphazard form of interdimensional travel. One for organics and one for inorganics. It all comes down to understanding and manipulating subatomic particles, which is a \[Lv4\] classified area of R&D conducted by advance AI quantum computing and super particle acceleration tech.

Special Case: **The Rite of Passage** is the ritual priests from the Dark Order perform to make this energy transference take place when dealing with fallen angels. This is a process totally separate from legates because angels are multidimensional beings which I will explain in the Angelic bio. Demons are not. Details on how this ritual works were narrated in the [Story of Emma Summers.](https://www.reddit.com/u/RingoCross99/s/noCVgSjVp8) Sadly, costly arcane rituals only work for fallen angels. It does come at the steep price of rapid energy diminishment, which is why the vampire race was created. Fallen lords use the blood of vampires to replenish their life force while on earth. If not for this cruel and ironic feeding frenzy, they would weaken to the point where they would have to return to hell.
