The flickering light of his dying fire sent strange silhouettes dancing across the fabric of Mike's tent. He rolled over in his sleeping bag and tried again to ignore the sounds from the forest. Seconds later, something began scratching against pine bark. He had seen enough raccoons and critters on the way to his campsite to explain the sound, but his paranoia grew all the same. 

As an adult, he knew the fiends and ghouls he had feared in his youth only lived in his mind, but their hold had been strong. Mike had been labeled a "bed wetter" by his older siblings who tormented and teased him constantly as a boy. His fear of his father tales and his brother's stories had frozen him in bed many nights, sometimes too scared to even get up to use the bathroom or glance out of the window. There were witches in the woods who would sacrifice him to Satan. There were impossibly long arms behind the bedskirts, waiting to pull him under the bed. There were even monsters in the bathtub drain that could suck him into the pipes and kill him.

But his past traumas wouldn't keep him from being a man anymore.

Deciding against sleep, he put his shoes on, fed the fire the last of his stockpiled wood, and sat on a rock with his back to the flames. New shadows sprang from his lively fire, and the dense forest seemed to dance to a noiseless tune.

Noiseless - except now he could hear a song. It was faint, but from an outcrop of rocks behind his campsite started an eerie chorus. He stood up and silently moved toward the rock face, noticing a crevasse he had not seen before. 

The sound grew louder. 

Terrified, he froze in front of the narrow cave and heard the song transform into a hideous echoed chant. Gutteral, snarling sounds accompanied this new clamor and drove fear deep into his heart. Visions of demons and witches flooded his mind and destroyed all rational thought. 

He bolted. His car was parked off the main highway less than a half mile away, but there was no trail for him to follow. He sprinted wildly through the dark underbrush in the direction of the road. 

Suddenly his feet left the path and he felt his stomach rise into his throat. Mike wheeled, but the ground was no longer under him. Confusion and panic consumed him as the wind screamed past his ears like a banshee coming to devour his soul.

Less than five seconds later, he landed feetfirst onto a pile of boulders at the bottom of a ravine, shattering the bones in his legs and feet.

At daybreak, a large family of Boreal wolverines sleepily wandered out of the crevasse to inspect an empty tent and the smoldering remains of a fire. They found a meager meal amongst the site and quietly crept back to their craggy den.

Two days later, hikers spotted my grandfather, mangled, barely alive and being eaten by ants, just off the main trail. 

Though he eventually recovered well enough to walk on his own, Grandpa Mike never went into the woods again.
