Campus life was something I had trouble adjusting to. I hoped to find some semblance of normalcy interacting with my peers. I only found that each waking moment perpetuated an isolation that continuously festered. 

I’ve never been one to seek solace, let alone from total strangers. Most people I had interacted with up until that point had heightened hormones and a fiery desire to drink copious amounts of alcohol with no consideration for self-regard. If only I had given myself more time to see that every person didn't fit into that narrative.

Anyway.

To say I was overwhelmed would be a gratuitous understatement. Between tuition costs, maintaining familial ties, amity between my relationships, my bartending job (which I hated), and the burdens of everyday life, the stress was burying me alive.

I never wanted to be a missing poster. I never wanted to be a hopeful undergrad who lost their way chasing something they didn’t understand. Sometimes things are beyond our control.

One summer afternoon, I made a life-changing mistake. Something that would appear to an unassuming viewer as a ‘meet-cute’.

I was running late, as I was accustomed to (see reasons above as to why). In my hurriedness, I bumped into a tall student. It was like colliding with a tiled wall. I was sent to the ground along with my belongings.

Beyond being embarrassed, I apologized about thirty times too many as I scrambled to pick up my biology lab reports. My eyes raised to him and… my God… he was incredibly handsome.

He feigned a pained expression as he helped retrieve the documents. He quickly inspected one of the papers. “I wasn't aware bio students were so strong.”

I giggled. “I was planning on trying out for football later. How was my tackle?”

He nodded. “Pretty good. Is that why you're taking biology? To make your own steroids?”

“That's actually chemistry.”

He wore a dumbfounded expression and simply said, “Oh.”

This situation, regrettably, made me laugh. Unfortunately, I was smitten. Some would say smitten-est. It’s only now, when I’m typing this out, that I realize how cliché that whole situation was. It wasn’t long after this encounter that he became my boyfriend.

I learned that his ‘family’ owned a business and was rather wealthy. He invited me to stay out in their cabin in the woods for a weekend, which turned into two weekends, then three. He flew me out every time. When I first arrived, I thought it was odd when the cabin had about a hundred photos of different men posing with various women. He explained that it was all his extended family. Nothing too out of the ordinary, everyone looked happy, and who am I to judge a man for loving his family? How foolish I was in my love-drunk state.

This almost goes without saying, but things moved rather quickly for us. My parents told me not to rush into things, but at the time, I thought they were being unreasonable and barring me from my happiness. They *already* found love. Now that I have finally found someone who was kind, caring, and compassionate, they want to reject him outright? He was everything I envisioned in an ideal partner. It’s only now that I understand what they mean when they say love is blind.

One of my glaring character flaws, if it wasn’t obvious, is that I would often just do things and deal with the consequences later. My solution to the stress that would come from these (often) poor decisions was simple—a shower.

I didn’t take many showers, truthfully, I mean, not an above-average amount. I took as many as was socially required, and I didn’t do so begrudgingly. I wanted to be free from what bothered me, and as a kid, a shower was the perfect solution to all the issues in the world. It was just a trait I carried into adulthood.

Hungry? Take a shower.

Failed a test? Take a shower.

Chained to a wall in an unbreachable darkness? Just take a shower.

But you can’t take a shower. You can’t take a shower because Paul won’t let you.

Paul wanted you to sit in the dark with these beautiful women.

Paul would emphasize, “No one could leave until only one of us was remaining. And when one of us was remaining, we had to eat the failures.” And Paul loved to watch.

A blinding light from the door leading upstairs would occasionally alleviate some of the eclipsing black. Then, to my surprise, it wouldn’t be Paul anymore.

This man would constantly congratulate and encourage me, as if I’d done something good.

Promised that everything would be better soon. It will always be better soon.

He took all of my belongings except the rosary that hung around my naked body.

To Paul's credit, he didn’t force me into the basement. I thought I was being a good girlfriend and getting something for him, but the second my foot crossed the threshold, I needed to be there. I needed to be in the darkness. All sense and reason had left me the moment I set foot in that basement.

Across from me was this… rotting corpse. Lit candles burned, but they emitted no light on the altar it was nailed to. Although the room was pitch black, it was always visible, even when my eyes were closed.

Its head would shift and stare in revelry. I could feel its excitement as it watched us fight and consume one another.

“You will be perfect. You will become her.” He would turn my face so that all I could see was that thing. “You will bear a beautiful daughter, and the world will finally know her beauty.”

He’d kiss me on my forehead, which comforted me, even between the stench of decaying corpses. 

He would sometimes give me a small amount of water, then whisper. “Yareli… My darling, you will become the most beautiful rose.” 

I imagine he thought I'd think this statement exhilarating and a way to ease my mind. I didn’t. I didn't want to become a rose, if a rose was that thing across from my imprisonment.

Then I noticed one day, I wasn’t chained up anymore. I couldn’t say with any certainty the last time I had been. A thought that sent me spiraling was: Did I do all of this of my own volition?

I calmly walked up the stairs and into the guest bedroom, the only place I was allowed to stay outside of the basement. I then took a shower—the most relieving shower I ever had.

The blood from my markings flooded the base of the tub, a deep scarlet pooled beneath me. I watched as it slowly spiraled down the drain. I felt the water's warmth, but maybe that wasn’t from the heat of the shower. I’ll never know.

I just sat at the bottom of that tub. Clutching the only thing I was allowed to have of my past. When Paul entered, he didn’t look like Paul anymore; he hadn’t for quite some time.

“What have you done!” He cried out when he discovered me.

He was usually gentle, despite all that I’ve told you. He himself never forced anything on anyone, from what I saw. It was my own actions that felt foreign, like a marionette of some sort. It was on that day that I learned he could do more than just watch.

I remembered firm hands on my skull. I remembered the immense pressure of my cranium meeting the tile. My mind was then suddenly elsewhere. I could see my father watching TV in the living room, and my mother would come up behind him. She’d kiss him and whisper, “I love you.” As a kid, I thought it was gross when they did that. Now that was all I wanted at the moment. I couldn’t have been further away from it.

When I came to, something had clearly changed. His eyes were now my eyes. Why this happened, I can only guess, but I was watching. He would end up in the shower, just as I had. Clutching the rosary my grandmother had given me. He would wail and cry. I wondered if I did the same in my final moments.

I unfortunately discovered that I couldn’t do whatever I wanted. Even as a ghost… demon… thing. How fucking lame, right?

My actions were entirely limited. Even in his possessed state, he still managed to convince others to try to become that thing, or maybe it wasn’t his doing. Yet, there were periods where I did have control of him. 

Again, I was mostly powerless; his body instinctively resisted anything he wouldn’t do himself. This included self-harm and calling for any type of assistance. He would call the police, however. I soon realized they were in on this as well. The only thing I *could* do was type a fucking story on a webpage he browsed when he was a child. 

Just before he’d meet someone, he’d browse about them online. Find their interests. It wouldn’t take long until he had an idea of what they desired. I’d feel his body shift. How his skin would slither and adjust. His bone and muscle structure became exactly what they wanted to see. I’d never seen anything like it.

Even now, his will pushes against mine; it is slick and oily, like mercury. Tainted and demented. I’ve tried to kill him, I promise, but he resists. He is a living, breathing nightmare.

He works with the people of this town. It seems to function normally for all intents and purposes, except for one detail.

Only men populate this town. I regrettably couldn't discover why. 

His desperation grew each day he lost control. Those around him noticed it as well. I was just as scared as he was.

Even though I didn’t have complete control, sometimes it felt as though the spirits of his other victims replayed their final moments like they were rewinding the end of a movie.

I have left everything here for you as to how and where that happened. As for this place, all I can say is they call it Anchorage.  

It took everything I had to make him forget or even type this out. Even now, I don’t know if I’m talking.

I wanted you to understand him better. He garners sympathy, manipulates, and is charming and funny in his own way. I truly believed I found someone who was made for me. I see how I was mistaken. 

Something approaches from within him. I fear this is the end. Everything is already here.

I’m sorry I wasn’t strong enough. I thought Friday was the last day, but I’ve somehow lasted this long. This is all I have left. I am out of time. A black flame approaches. It is all-consuming, taking me with it and leaving me with nothing.

I am sorry to my mother and father. I should have listened to you. I shouldn’t have gone with him.

A part of me wishes I could say this was a happy ending. That this was all that was right in the world. It’s not, despite the long nights of pleasure, excitement, joy, heartache, and peacefulness. I thought he was the one, but he isn't one; he is many.

Wow… that was… uncomfortable…

Sorry about that.

This was honestly fascinating for me. A bit of an out-of-body experience, if I say so myself. Have I really been writing all this stuff?

I suppose she meant to post this before I saw anything about it. I cleaned it up for her, don’t worry. Left no detail out. The original version was a lot more hurried. I did editorialize a bit, sorry about that. I wondered what purpose all of this was for? For a college student, you’d think you’d be more professional. I mean, really, how desperate can you be?

I can feel her presence again. It has been so long. The only wife that has ever mattered. The only wife I wish to bring back. And since she has returned, let me tell you a story about my purpose, my muse. The existence of my very being.

I was a lost young man in my early twenties. Ultimately, I concluded that a rope wouldn’t solve any of my problems, so I traveled. I traveled all across the United States with what little money I had in my account. When that ran out, so did the excitement like a kindled flame that was dying out. I wasn’t depressed, just… a little misguided, maybe lost.

I wanted to know what love felt like. The portrait I was given of ‘love’ was even more misguided than I was. Since when did violence equal compassion? Understanding? I digress.

I left it all behind. When you’re lost in life, it seems like everything and nothing is calling to you. When you’ve never been given a prime example of how to be an adult, your future can be… delayed. It’s understandable, in this situation, how someone can become eager for any source of validation. 

Validation came to me in the form of a whisper. Shortly after my bank account reached zero, I heard it. Or should I say, her.

I drove until I ran out of gas. I hitchhiked until the whispers graduated to more discernible phrases. But they weren’t phrases, they were moans. They called my name. I followed them. I walked until my feet were raw. Her ecstasy became contagious the closer I got to the source.

I traveled through a national forest, not seeing a single soul along the way. Her voice guided me clearly. Then I finally saw her.

Her body was suspended, clearly being worshipped. Her skin was exposed and stripped from her back, morphing into wings. Her silvery complexion had beautiful symbols carved deep within. Rose bushes left the area a thorny ocean of sanguine emeralds. The roses climbed the trees like vines, even though that wasn’t of their nature.

She called out to me, and I listened. I trekked through the thorns. It cut my skin deep, but I didn’t care. I had to behold her, feel her.

The forest itself found her endearing. The trees parted for her crucifixion. In her vacant eye sockets, beetles, worms, and maggots made her body their own, reveling in the splendor that is her warmth.

She begged me to fulfill her, so I tore her from her monument and gifted her my seed upon the rose bushes. She demanded it from me. I could not resist her, for she was the most beautiful creature I'd ever seen.

The crows watched on as we were twisted in one another, my flesh pressed against hers, as she called out for me. How the thorns dug deep into both of us. We bled into one another. Infusing. Becoming one.

I became her lover. Together, our union is eternal. After all those years of my crippling loneliness, I had finally found love. True love. Not what you see in the movies, those unrealistic portrayals of relationships where everything always works out.

This love is messy, complicated, and beyond the boundaries of selflessness.

She requested a bearer—a wife to gift her new flesh so she may roam this planet once more. I couldn't resist her charms. Her utterly flawless figure hypnotized me.

She blessed me and only requested that I provide a vessel for her to incubate. She’ll plant a seed within a rose, then she’ll inhabit the seedlings.

We were close. So very close. In my failure, she abandoned me. She has returned. I will not fail her again.

They don’t understand what I do for them. How I arrange them, sculpt them, it is all worship. All in her image. It is only praise—the highest praise to the Matriarch.

There is no finding Anchorage, by the way. Not unless she requests your presence. She does it now. I will tell you how to recognize her calls. In her endless generosity, she will inhabit your dreams. She will take the form of whatever you wish. She will pleasure you as I have pleasured her.

Little did I know that I was worshipping her for years.

Oh, how we tangled together. How she tangles with some of you, as well.

The roses survive as best as they can, but there can only be one. The finest rose is set in her image. The cycle repeats until she is reborn. No matter how many roses try to escape through a window, run through the forest, or hide in the shower, there will always be another. 

I loved every one of my wives. Our union, what it is to become. I know they don’t understand what they see in the basement. The epitome of beauty. Aphrodite reborn for mortals to experience.

And my wives will provide her with another Hera. It is only a matter of time.

Because I will not be uncovered, I will be what you want. I will be in your bed and in your dreams. “Too good to be true.” You will tell your friends.

She is within all of us. She guides us home.

And I will find you, just as I found her.

My delicate, beautiful roses.
