I made a friend today. Maybe not for the best or not what I wanted at all but whatever. He’s nice, he seems to really like me. I think we started talking in math class..I’m not too sure, I kinda just zoned out as he tried making small talk with me, agreeing every once in a while. We did laugh though. He told me his name. Tomas, as he reached out to shake my hand. His clammy hands disgust me.

Maybe having a friend isn’t so bad, at least people don’t have to see me alone anymore, I couldn’t care less if I am alone, I actually prefer it, I can’t stand noise. But I want to seem..normal. I can’t, however, seem to drown out the thoughts of his flesh melting and peeling slowly off his face, bubbling like..lasagna. I don’t know why I constantly get this image whenever I look at his face..sometimes I’m laying in bed trying to sleep only to get interrupted by this image.

It’s in a forest, whenever I see this image, it’s always in a forest. Something is telling me to make it happen, to turn this image into reality. I can’t though can I?

I got to school, I didn’t even walk through the gate before I was immediately greeted by Tomas waiting for me at the entrance. I faked a smile as I watched him walk over and as I feared stretched his arm out to shake my hand. I can’t fucking stand his clammy fucking hands. Who the fuck does he think he is? The images grow stronger and more prevalent every day, I can’t even look over at him sitting at his desk. We do laugh sometimes and I have to admit we spend a lot of time together. Someone even said whenever they see one of us, they know the other is somewhere behind. I have to kill him

I’m writing this as I am unable to fall asleep, the excitement is too much. Whenever I think about the inevitable I get a fiery tingle from my twos shooting up to the crown of my head. I love it.

Tomas came up with the genius idea of spending Halloween together, despite my initial but disguised disgust, its a good opportunity. So I agreed. At the end of the day I felt like ripping my own skin off and escaping this world as he stretched his arms, this time to hug me. I tried to hide the creeping expression of repulsion and I gave in. He told me how I’m his best friend and he’s glad I met him. I tried hard to ignore his face as he blushed as to not tear out his throat with my teeth and told him he was my best friend too.

Tomorrow is the day, I can’t even think straight, my mom told me I’m “unusually upbeat” today. If only she knew why. I can’t be bothered to hide my excitement, I just want to scream.

It happened. It was just like the vision told me it would be. Beautiful. I lead Tomas into the woods, once we got deep enough I quite literally stabbed him in the back, which also meant it was too late to go back. I generously sprinkled the lighter fluid all over him savoring every second, it was magical. Once the flame hit his body it wasn’t long before he was engulfed. He screamed and screamed and I stared and the fleshed melted and peeled off his face. I got home, not running but taking my time just to soak in what just happened, that’s where I’m writing this. If you’re reading this it’s too late. I’m in heaven.
