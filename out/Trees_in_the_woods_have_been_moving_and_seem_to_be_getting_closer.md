I had to get out of the city. The divorce hit me hard, left me feeling empty, like there was nothing left inside. Everywhere I looked, the city just reminded me of all the ways I’d messed up. After I lost my job, I started messing with drugs, pills at first, to take the edge off, then harder stuff that dulled the pain but made everything worse. It pushed everyone away, especially my wife. When my uncle offered me his old cabin in the Oregon woods for the summer, I didn’t think twice. It was a small, rundown place, tucked deep in the forest, far from anyone. I figured it’d be a chance to clear my head, maybe get clean. Just me and my dog, Roy, this scrappy little black and white spotted mutt, who stuck by me even when I was at my worst.



The cabin was a wreck when I got there. The wood was warped, windows coated in grime, and weirdest of all, these thick tree roots were pushing up through the basement floor. They didn’t look right, like they were invading the place. I spent the first few days cleaning up, hammering loose boards, wiping away dust, and chopping those roots with an old axe. They were gnarly, twisted things, almost creepy, like they were trying to grab the house. Roy hated them. He’d growl, keeping his distance, fur all puffed up. I wondered if he was picking up on something I couldn’t.



Then stuff started going missing. A screwdriver I swore I left on the table, a hammer I’d just used, they’d turn up in weird spots, like under the porch or by the shed. I wasn’t that scatterbrained, especially since I was trying to stay sober, but I blamed it on my foggy brain. Stress does that, right?



After a week, the cabin was looking better. I felt proud, like I was actually starting over. Roy was chasing squirrels and birds, and we’d sit on the porch at night, listening to the wind rustle through the trees. The forest was huge, quiet, and felt like the perfect place to put myself back together.



But I ran low on supplies, so I drove to town. It’s a long haul, two hours on twisty forest roads. Roy stayed behind, napping by the door. I knew that road like the back of my hand, but halfway through, there was this loud crack, and my side mirror was smashed. I pulled over, thinking I’d hit something. There was just a low, knotted branch from a tree by the road, like it had reached out and hit the mirror. Thing is, I could’ve sworn that tree wasn’t so close to the road before. It gave me a weird feeling, like it had moved. I shoved the branch aside and kept going, the mirror dangling.



Town was fine. I grabbed food, some treats for Roy, and a few tools for the cabin. Stocked up so I wouldn’t need to come back for a while. When I got back, Roy was on the porch but wouldn’t go near the trees. He used to love sniffing around, but now he just stared at the forest, whining. I tried taking him for a walk, but he wouldn’t move. Dogs get weird, I thought.



Back inside, those roots were in the basement again, bigger, twistier, like they’d grown overnight. I was mad now, so I hacked them up with the axe. They felt warm, almost alive, with this odd pulsing. I told myself it was just my imagination, nothing real.



Days went by, and the forest started to feel off. The big pines and firs around the cabin seemed closer, not all at once, but bit by bit, like they were sneaking up on the house. I went out to check, thinking maybe the ground was soft from rain, but it was solid, no signs of anything shifting.



I tried to keep busy inside, fixing stuff, reading old books I found in the cabin. But every time I stepped outside, the trees felt too close, their branches hanging lower, casting darker shadows over the yard. Roy stopped leaving the porch. He’d just sit there, staring at the forest, making these sad little noises.



Then I found a root inside the cabin, poking through the living room wall like a snake. I lost it, grabbed the axe, and chopped it out, yelling my head off. Roy cowered in the corner, scared. The root oozed this sticky sap that got all over my hands and wouldn’t wash off easily.



That night, I had a nightmare. I was stuck in the forest, trees closing in, their trunks moving like they had legs, roots wrapping around me, pulling me into the dirt. I woke up sweating, heart pounding. When I looked out the window, the forest did look tighter around the cabin, branches tangled together, like they were blocking me in.



I couldn’t ignore it anymore. Something was wrong. I grabbed the axe and went outside, ready to chop down whatever was too close. But when I touched one tree’s bark, a sharp, burning pain shot through my hand, like I’d grabbed a hot pan. I yanked my hand back, but there was no mark. The pain was deep, inside.



I tried finding a path through the forest, but the trees were so dense now, packed together, like the woods were alive and trapping the cabin on purpose. I went back inside, trying not to freak out.



Then I saw Roy.



He was on the kitchen floor, not moving. A root had punched through the boards and gone right through his chest. Blood was everywhere, and the root was still there, twitching, like it was feeding. I dropped to my knees, crying, unable to process it. My dog, my best friend, gone like that. I hacked at the root, screaming, but it didn’t change anything. The cabin felt so empty without him.



I’m stuck here now. The forest has closed in, trees right up against the walls, pushing so hard the wood’s cracking. Roots are everywhere, through the floor, the roof, making the whole place shake and groan. I can’t get out. The doors and windows are blocked by thick branches and trunks, like the forest turned the cabin into a cage.



I’ve got almost no food left, maybe enough for today. The air’s heavy, smells like wet dirt, and it’s hard to breathe, like the trees are stealing the oxygen. I hear noises all the time, creaking, whispering, like the forest is talking about me. I can’t sleep, terrified of dreams where the woods swallow me whole.



To my ex-wife, if you ever hear about this, I’m so sorry. The drugs tore us apart. I pushed you away when you tried to help, and I hate myself for it. I wish I could go back, make things right, be with you again.



The cabin’s falling apart, walls buckling as the forest squeezes tighter. I feel the trees watching, waiting. I won’t make it much longer, either I’ll starve, or the house will collapse on me.



If you read this, stay away from the forest. It’s alive. And it’s Starving.
