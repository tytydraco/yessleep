Truthfully, I don't know why I'm even doing this. I feel like a part of me that once was is no longer there. This is my desperate attempt at finding any sort of normalcy through internet interaction.

I’ve never been one to seek solace, let alone from internet strangers. Originally, I thought this community was a big inside joke. Now I am much wiser. The stories I used to browse occasionally now have a darker undertone that doesn’t alleviate any of the stress that is burying me alive. I pound and pound, but it won’t let me out. I’m drowning in an ocean of grief and other poetic nonsense. I’m sad. I’m terribly, horribly miserable. I don’t want to be a downer.  

I want to be free from this.

I miss my wife. She was a comforting presence at all points of my day. Now she is absent. I fear something much more sinister has replaced her.

I used to not be the superstitious type. I was certain as the sun would rise that paranormal entities didn’t exist. Now I am not so sure.

Please, oh please, I will take literally ANY and all suggestions you have to offer. I am at my wits' end here. Whenever the wailing stops and I am dried again, I am one step closer to calling a priest.  

To catch you up to speed. Yes, I have a therapist. Yes, he is fucking worthless. 

For my entire life, I have struggled with loss. As in, I’ve struggled with *feeling* the emotion of loss. While others were crying at a funeral, I knew from movies and books and all the signs around me that I should’ve been sad. Yet, every single time, grief had escaped me. 

When my wife died, I finally felt what I thought was impossible to feel. Grief, terror, abandonment. Whatever you want to call it, I felt it, and it was a hurricane.

That’s when I started seeing a therapist. The recurring conversations with them are repetitive, nonsensical, and honestly, I don’t know if I can trust a word he says. They tell me to let myself grieve and try again. 

I have.

How much water can you pour into a bucket until it is full? Until it is spilling over the edge and onto the floor? That is what it feels like. It feels like I’m doing the same thing over and over again. I am a failure. I am incapable of doing anything right. It’s like I’m bashing my fucking skull into a wall, just to feel anything.

Now I feel as though if I grieve any longer, I will go mad, and I fear I have. My therapist thinks I’m having dissociative episodes. Which just means I am getting so stressed out from… what happened, that I am blacking out due to said stress. I’ve lived twenty-seven years without feeling much of anything, and now I’m making up for lost time, it seems. 

It's been half a year since she’s been gone, much longer since I felt her touch. 

The first month continued on as normal. There was a hollow emptiness inside of me, but I persevered. 

Then I saw a therapist at my coworker's suggestion, but now I fear that even my therapist is tired of hearing about my problems because they’ve told me to find community and bond with others over similar situations, like the loss of a loved one.

I tried other online websites first. I’ve been on video calls with strangers, all talking about their problems. This only exacerbated my loneliness. I’ve even gone so far as to meet one of these people in real life, but that’s a story for another time.

So, if you lovely people don't mind, I would also like to hear the stories you have of your loved ones, if you can spare the time.

Give me Hope that I can make things right, that I’m not the only man out here struggling with a loss such as this.

To begin this all, let me tell you a story of my beautiful wife.

I think fondly of a lot of our dates. One of our most memorable dates was our first date to a particularly beautiful garden in Florida. 

She wore a spotted sundress that she probably bought for fifteen dollars, but it looked like Gucci on her (does Gucci make dresses?). Her auburn hair curled over her face, and I just wanted to brush it aside and kiss her all day. If you can’t tell, I was smitten. Trust me, I’ve been smitten before, but I was smitten-est. I've never been so in love.

There was one problem, however. I'm not very well known for my social media prowess, and she was a bit of an influencer. She wanted me (terrible idea, I know) to take photos of her, as part of our date agreement (terrible, *I know*). She joked that this was a "trial run" to see if I could “make the cut.”

After this comment, I thought she was absolutely insufferable and nearly any positive feelings I had for her had been thrown out a window. 

Throughout the date, however, we held hands and looked at the flowers that were blooming in early March. How she looked when she smelled those flowers… her auburn hair catching on the petals. I loved how her freckles would shift as she crinkled her button nose.

It was beautiful. It made me understand artists. The reason they would stand in front of a piece of marble or a painting for hours, working their hands to the bone. All in an effort to capture their beloved. To have something of them and cherish it, so that the world could behold a fragment of what you see in them.

So yeah… I humored her social media degeneracy and awkwardly held the phone. I kept taking landscape photos, but she insisted, while pointing a finger at me. “They had to be portrait.” I can still see her narrow her eyes at me, yet a faint crease was at the edge of her lips.

To this day, I honestly don’t know what the difference is. A picture is a picture after all.

Despite this, the date was magical in its own awkward way. Without my knowing, I think about this day constantly. 

It is one of my only remaining comforts.

I don't know if it was the smell of the roses or something else, but I was obsessed. She was obsessed with me as well, I think, because I took probably over a hundred photos of her. None of which made it to her Instagram, but she still asked me on a second date.

The rest is history, basically. We’d been together ever since. 

Now for the… less fun part. I hesitate even typing this. I’ve convinced myself that if I stare at the screen long enough, then what I’m about to type won't be real and I can delay the inevitable. 

I hate thinking about it.  It was a slippery slope once it all started, and it started when she had a miscarriage. It was traumatic, to say the least. She couldn’t get over it. No matter how many roses there were, no matter how many late-night conversations we had in the dark. Nothing was helping. I insisted we could try again, that this didn’t have to be the end of everything we worked for, but that only made things worse.

It is only now that I wonder if that was the right thing to say. When you put so much of yourself into a relationship, into a bond, when it is slipping away from you, you become desperate, especially when you’ve tasted the sting of bitter failure of past relationships. 

“You can’t change the past, but there is always hope for the future.” My therapist's words ring in my mind.

When I worked as a firefighter, I was no stranger to witnessing terrible things. That also means I am not at home for days at a time when it’s my turn to be on call at the station. For those who don’t know, when you work as a firefighter, there are things called 24’s and 48’s. Meaning, if you are at the station for 24 hours straight, then you are off for 48 hours after. My station is a little different; we, after much debate, prefer 48’s and 96’s. Which means we work for two days straight, then are off for four days. 

This means I got to spend more time at home with my wife once my 48 was over. We tried to communicate only when needed. After you’ve been with someone for a while, you sort of run out of things to talk about before your messages become meaningless phrases of “What do you want to eat tonight?” and things like that. So for a majority of the time, we weren’t connecting with one another. She was also hung up on a few things we hadn’t quite settled. I would be lying if I said this was the perfect relationship after we lost our daughter. 

In the early stages though… She usually greeted me by the door, wrapped her arms around me, and kissed my neck. She’d whisper, “I love you.” I would twirl her around like a ballroom dancer. In those moments, nothing else mattered in the world. I really miss those times. I can’t help but wonder if I could have been better for her. Could have been more present with her and been the person she needed me to be.

Man. I am glad you guys don’t have webcams, because you would see me bawling like a baby right now.

Anyway.

I was uneasy when I wasn’t greeted at the door. I told myself it was fine, we hadn’t done that in awhile.

I was nervous whenever I called for her and got no response. I told myself that was okay, she could be sleeping after all.

I was terrified when I opened the door to the basement. I figured she’d been there, as it had become routine ever since we lost Hera.

When the door creaked open, I saw her. She was at the bottom of the steps. Her vertebrae jutted from her neck like they were desperate for air. Her body was bare, with deep gashes in her shoulder blades. Insects made her their home.

I can’t get that vision out of my head. How the light of the kitchen barely illuminated the bottom of those steps. It almost appeared a monster was there, mangled and broken. But it wasn’t a monster, it was my wife.

This has been my first experience with depression, grief, and ruin. Let me tell you, I don’t recommend it.

Although it is cliché, I am disgusted with myself for letting her do that. Whether it was an accident or not, I blame myself for all the things I could’ve done. If I had only worked a 24, would she still have been alive? I was the one who pushed for the 48-hour shifts in the first place. Is she dead because of it? I’ve been told not to blame myself, but I can’t help but do so.

Then, I had been forgiven. I felt her presence. A soft humming. Her delicate fingers caressing my face. A soft press on my lips. I knew it was her. 

I pushed away all thoughts that this shouldn’t be happening, that this was all a façade, a hoax, some attempt by my body to deal with the stress. I just accepted it. If you haven’t been in my position, just be grateful your brain didn’t go to the lengths mine did to preserve itself. 

These moments brought me comfort beyond the therapy, beyond the consoling of my friends, and beyond anything I’ve ever known.

But then it started on Wednesday.

It is ALWAYS Wednesday. 

I woke up at the bottom of the stairs, right where I found her. It’s like a switch has been flicked. I black out for however long, and when I come to, I am at the bottom of those steps. Something replaced my loving wife's presence.

If it were just that, I wouldn’t be here, though. There is also this wailing sound. It is eerily similar to the noises my wife made when we lost our child. It is taunting me with her grief. Burying her deep inside me.

Then it started to escalate. I started blacking out on Tuesdays. I woke up in the shed out back, being assaulted by the most *awful* screaming. 

I’ve heard what it sounds like when someone burns alive. Being a firefighter, it is a known thing that can happen. We train for it, and we do our best to prevent it. But it is still haunting. 

Did you know that when you are burning alive, it isn’t the fire that kills you? It’s normally the smoke inhalation or your organs' fluids drowning you from the inside. 

Hey, sorry. If I can’t sleep at night, neither can you. But that is what I hear on Tuesdays. That screaming and the smell of burning flesh lingers in the air as I sit, curled up in the corner.

Then I began to black out on Monday. When I awake, the soft grass is beneath me. I’m always deep in the surrounding forest. Drums pounding in the distance and almost tribal in nature. 

Then it started on Fridays. Friday is always strange. I wake up in my driveway, dirt underneath my fingernails. When I come back into the house, it’s spotless. Counters are wiped down, dishes are cleaned, and the fridge is organized.

I would wake up at the bottom of the stairs on Wednesday, then I would just pretend nothing happened. When the next Wednesday rolled around, there I was, at the bottom of the stairs. The wailing pierces my eardrums. Again, I thought nothing of it. 

“The stress is just getting to me.” I convinced myself.

The third time it happened, I tried to set a timer of some sort. It’s very hard to do so when you suddenly black out with no warning whatsoever. I wear one of those watches that literally monitors every detail about your health. During that time, it registers my body as being in REM sleep. I think it has something to do with my heart rate and my breathing, yet when I check the app on my phone, my steps are always higher than what they were before I blacked out. 

The blackout only lasted about an hour at first, then it was an hour and fifteen minutes, then an hour and thirty minutes. The time I’ve been ‘asleep’ has been steadily increasing.

When I could no longer feel my wife’s presence, that’s when the concern grew.

Wednesday. Tuesday. Monday. Friday. I know that’s not sequential, but that’s the order I started blacking out. Let me tell you, it feels like I’m losing my fucking mind. 

I’ve scheduled an appointment with a neurologist out of town in hopes that they find a tumor or something, because at least that would be a satisfying explanation for what the fuck is happening to me and to tell me where my wife has gone.

Last week I blacked out on my 48 and walked home, not drove. Walked. My coworkers couldn’t stop me, no matter how hard they tried. They’ve said they’ve never seen anything like it. As a result, I am on an extended leave from work. My supervisor has told me to “Let myself grieve” and that “I’m freaking everyone out.”  

I’m freaking you out? How do you think I feel? I wish it were just grief. The guilt from my decisions, coupled with the fact that I inadvertently got my best shot at a happy life killed, being at the station is… something I’m stepping away from for a while. It feels like I'm falling, and no matter how hard I try to stop myself, I reach out, but nothing stops my descent. It’s a nightmare. A living, breathing nightmare. These five months since my wife has died have taken their toll.

My greatest fear is that whatever is happening causes me to lose control. That I black out for all seven days of the week, twenty-four hours a day. My fear may soon be realized, because two weeks ago, I blacked out on Sunday. I don’t know if it can get much worse than Sunday.

I woke up in the shower. I am soaking wet, and my skin is pruny from being in there for so long. My god damned electric bill has been so expensive because of it. I’ve gone so far as to put protective locks on the damn faucet and turn off the main water to my home, but it doesn’t matter. I always wake up butt naked in my bathtub, soaking wet.

And if it were just this, I think a part of me could rationalize everything. See, I’ve never been religious. I’ve never believed in god or spirits or demons. I’ve believed in real, tangible things you can feel. Yet, whenever I wake up in the shower, in my shaking hands, I’m clutching a rosary.

I don’t own a rosary.
