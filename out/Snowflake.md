My Mom calls me Snowflake a lot, especially around Christmastime.  She tells me it’s because I’m one-of-a-kind, though I’m not sure that’s true.  She also says it because she thinks I’m delicate—that’s the part she doesn’t say, but I can feel it in her head when her mouth gets soft and her eyes get hard and she wants me to do what she says.  I don’t have to listen, but I don’t mind.

 

So I crawl into my special pocket, fasten the cover, and we go out into the wintery night of the mall’s parking lot.

 

I love going to the malls, especially the few indoor ones that are left, and especially right before Christmas.  The contrast of the cold outside and the heat inside, the mixture of smells and excitement and stress and noise and lights…I just love to drift around and drink it all in.

 

All of Mom’s jackets and coats and sweatshirts have a special pocket for me—the hoodie, reinforced with hidden fabric and stitching and covered with a sheer mesh cover I can close when I’m inside.  I’m small and light, so usually someone would have to really pay attention to even notice how the hoodie is not quite as flat or droopy as it should be, or how the mouth is oddly turned forward a bit so I can always see out over her shoulders.  But even if they did, they’d normally just see a bit of shimmery fabric that they can’t see into but I can see out of very well.  Almost all the time, if someone is sensitive enough to notice all of that, they also feel something else.  Some sense that they should look away and move along before something bad finds them.

 

That’s another reason I love Christmas so much.  Everyone is so in their own heads that we’re extra invisible as we walk through the stores and along the avenues of hallway between them.  We’ll go to the food court on Christmas Eve and just hang out for an hour or so, watching everyone go by.

 

Tonight we’re doing much the same, Mom idly chewing on some French fries while I watch a pair of children playing on the carousel that dominates the far end of the court.  That’s when I notice the man staring at us.

 

He looked like he was in his fifties, but I knew he was younger.  His anger and craziness had aged him like milk left out in the sun.  He just watched us for a few minutes, his lips wrestling with each other as he muttered to himself.  I could already see him coming over soon—he was just working up the steam to make it so.  Sure enough, another few minutes and he wove his way between the tables to stop a few feet in front of us.

 

“Wot do you got in your coat?”  His face was lined and creased with what might have been oil or dirt, and his voice had that jolly meanness that cruel people use when they want to pretend something’s funny and nice before the hurting began.

 

Mom looked up at him and gave a short laugh.  “Why myself, of course.  It’s cold outside.  Are you having a good Christmas?”

 

She wasn’t an unattractive woman to most men, and she knew what to say to distract and diffuse a situation before it got bad.  A lot of people, her words and ways would have disarmed them, but not this one.  It just made him angrier.

 

He shook his head.  “No, no.  In your hood.  I see it’s fixed special, right?  What, have you got a pup in there?  Or a kitty cat?”  His face has been stretched into a toothy, almost wistful grin as he said this, but it changed suddenly, his eyes growing dark as his mouth twisted into a scowl.  “That’s against the rules, isn’t it?  I need to check and see.”

 

I felt Mom tense.  “You need to leave…me alone.  I don’t know what you’re talking about, and if you keep bothering me, I’ll call the police.”

 

The man studied her words for a moment, seeming to consider the truth behind them.  Then his face split into a genuine grin.  “No, you’re full of shit, aren’t you?  I don’t think you’ll be calling anybody.”  He leaned forward, reaching his hand out toward my special pocket.  “I don’t think you’ll be telling…”

 

He froze for a second, the smile falling away.  Most people wouldn’t have noticed that fast—I’d have to stimulate their amygdala to flood them with fear and make them go away.  But somehow he could feel it there.  The little tumor I’d just put in the middle of his brain.

 

His eyes rolled from Mom to where I lay watching him in my special pocket—somehow he knew where the cancer had come from.  His mouth worked soundlessly for a moment as tears filled his eyes, and then he turned and walked away without another word.  When he was gone, I leaned forward and whispered to Mom.

 

“I’m sad now.  Can we go to the house?”

 

\*\*\*\*

 

We had to drive through the falling snow for over an hour to get there, but it was still only seven-thirty.  Way too early yet.  So Mom drove us around a bit more, looking at Christmas decorations as we listened to a holiday channel on the radio.  Seeing all the bright lights and trees and snowmen cheered me up more than a little, and by the time we got back to the house it was after ten and I was in a better mood again.

 

Mom asked if she could take a nap and I agreed.  She had a busy night ahead of her, and I sometimes forgot she needed sleep more than I did.  Within a few minutes she was softly snoring, and I settled into her lap, staring out into the night and dreaming in my own way.  It was after midnight when I woke her and we approached the house across the street.

 

We always did research on our houses, especially at holidays.  You had to know all the variables, and Christmas introduced a lot of randomness,  It made it fun and exciting, but also more risky.  All the more reason to do the research ahead of time.  As we reached the side of the house, I pushed out with my senses.  There were six people inside.  Four adults and two children.  All upstairs, all asleep except for the children.  Just as expected.

 

Mom put her hand against the outer wall of the chimney, suppressing a cough.  The cough had been getting worse lately, and it worried me a bit, but I pushed the thought aside.  Tonight was supposed to be a happy time.  I crawled up the chimney quickly and then down inside.  I’d just checked it two nights ago, and it was open tonight just like before.  Mom always complained about me insisting on chimneys at Christmas.  It was dirty, and unnecessary when there were so many places I could squeeze in.  But that wasn’t the point, was it?  Sometimes it was enough to just do something because it was fun.

 

I peeked out from the chimney melodramatically.  I could sense them all still upstairs, and this place didn’t have any cameras.  Plopping onto the carpet with a sooty thump, I wiped myself off briefly before heading for the front door to let my mother in.

 

\*\*\*\*

 

My first visit was to the grandfather, the man of the house.  I crept onto his chest, feeling strangely shy in the silvery patch of moonlight cast across the sleeping forms of him and his wife.  I reached out tentatively towards his lips, wondering if he would stay asleep the whole time, though that was very rare.  And no, before I even made contact his eyes were open—bleary and confused but also very beautiful.  He looked down at me, his confusion running faster now that it was hand-clasped with fear.

 

“An…octop…”

 

I wanted to hear more words, but I couldn’t waste the opportunity.  I shot forward several of my arms, jamming them into the back corners of his jaws and flexing them there, wedging his mouth open as I shot forward  onto his tongue and pushed myself down his throat.  He was choking and trying to scream by then, but it was too late.  I was tearing through his esophagus, working my way with expert speed through his wet inner darkness until I was wrapped around his heart.  I allowed myself a small bite while it was still beating, and then I crushed it to pulp. 

 

When I emerged, I saw that Mom was finished with his wife—five stab wounds to the chest and a slit throat.  She removed the sofa pillows we’d brought upstairs from their spot along the crack at the bottom of the door and took them with us to the next bedroom.  Few got a chance to make too much noise, but it always paid to be careful.

 

We dealt with the younger couple next, and then the grandchildren.  When we were done, Mom taped all the bedroom doors shut.  I told her it was just so we didn’t have to smell the smell, but that was only part of it.  Dying could give the body over, after all, and I wanted the extra warning if it did.

 

But we’d be long gone by then.  And tonight was Christmas Eve.  So after she was done, we went back down to the living room and plugged in the Christmas tree.  She ate some cookies and we cuddled under a blanket watching movies for hours until she fell asleep again.

 

Looking at her snoring, I remembered her asking me a few weeks earlier if she was real.  When I asked her what she meant, she said that she didn’t remember having me, of having a life before me, of anything except what she was now.  She said at first, she’d thought maybe she had dreamed me, or imagined me into being.  I was so strange and wonderful—her special little Snowflake.

 

Her face had sagged a little as she went on.  But then she realized that all she knew was me, and that seemed strange too.  That maybe she was just a figment of my imagination that I’d wished real.  Then she started to cry.

 

I’d hugged her then, as I hugged her tonight before settling in to write this all down in my peculiar but precise way.  I told her that it didn’t matter who came first, or even how long it might last.  That the world could be a cold and lonely place.

 

But that there was a lot of good in the world too.  Warmth and companionship and love.  And when you found that, you had to treasure it.  Treasure it and hold on [tight](https://www.reddit.com/r/Verastahl/).
