The last time anyone saw my sister was nearly a month ago. This is completely out of character for her because out of the two of us, I am the fuck up and she is the responsible one. However one day her idiot friends decided to drag her along to go camping on the other side of the state. Why they chose to go there as their destination, I haven't a clue. While the town offered an escape from the world, it didn't have much else going for it. 

If you want to know what the town was like, the first thing I saw when I arrived was a child dragging a tin can with a leash as if it were a dog. The rest of the town was very much the same. Somewhere in the void between weird, surreal and worrying. 

When my sister didn't call after a few days, everyone grew worried and did all we could think of to find her. We drove all the way over there to hang up flyers and knock on doors, but no one had seen her or her friends. 

The police were no help. Every time they saw my car, they would pull me over to tell me that there was no reason for me to worry, or that she was most likely on a romantic getaway with her boyfriend and that I should just return home. 

It took all the patience I had to play nice when they said this. If they knew her, they would know that disappearing like that was impossible. Something must have happened and I was determined to get to the bottom of it. 

The last time I went out to that cursed and isolated town, I packed enough for an extended stay and checked into the hotel. I only stayed there once due to the poor condition of the room. I thought I was going to have to stay in my car and this was fine, I was willing to do it if that meant finding my sister. 

It was nearly two in the afternoon when I felt just how hungry I was and decided to go into the local diner. There, I overheard someone talking about a BnB that had just opened up and even though it wasn't advertised online, it was ready to be rented out. 

Figuring I might as well check it out, I asked about it and set off to find the owner so I could rent a room for my stay. On the way out of the diner I couldn't help but to notice that the flier I had set up in the window on my last visit a few days before was taken down. 

The owners, a married couple in their early sixties, were happy to have someone stay at their beach house and after everything was in order they gave me the key code so I could get the key and enter the house. 

The house had to have been a fifteen minute walk to the closest neighbor, but finding it wasn't hard. The building screamed old money and reminded me of a plantation. The surrounding yard was large, manicured to perfection and surrounded by a white fence. In the front yard there was a large tree with a tire swing.

Inside wasn't as nice as the outside. The lightbulbs looked ancient and gave off a sickly yellow glow to everything the light touched. As far as the electronics in the rest of the house went there was no television, or for that matter, an outlet to charge my phone.

I called the Keele’s to ask them about this and they told me that the house was considered an historical landmark, so no renovations could be done. 

After settling in, I figured to take some time exploring the place during the day since I wasn't planning on being there unless I was sleeping. There was a library, a dumbwaiter and everything else one might expect in a place that grand.

The view out the bedroom window revealed a lake and a dock through the branches of a bunch of weeping willows. There wasn't a ripple in sight. If I was there for any other reason than finding my sister, I would have taken that opportunity to swim.  

As I walked down the hallways, after unpacking my things, I thought I heard crying. I tried searching for the source of it, but whenever I was certain that it would be around the next corner, there was nothing. 

At the time I just figured the noise was because the house was so old. Or that the noise was all in my head because of the stress of my sister missing, or because I didn't sleep well the night before. 

Ignoring what I assumed I heard, I traveled back into town to ask people if they saw my sister or her friends as well as to hang up fliers. I must have walked a few miles by nightfall and figured that I deserved a nightcap so I went into the liquor store and bought myself a bottle of whiskey to drink when I reached the BnB. 

I am not much of a drinker and have a low tolerance, a fact that I am proud of, but I wasn't too drunk to have imagined the ursine howl I heard after brushing my teeth before bed. 

That howl... it stuck in my head for a while as I tried to figure out what could make a sound like that.  Finally, with the whiskey's help, sleep overcame me.

I woke up feeling refreshed, but that feeling did not last long.  As I got out of bed, I froze.

My suitcase had been moved.

Right before I went to sleep, I put the case in front of the closet door. I always did this when I slept in an unfamiliar place... it was a force of habit.  This morning, the case was NEXT to the door, not in front of it!

Someone had been in my room as I slept!
I quickly threw the closet open, but there was nothing out of the ordinary that I could see.  I did a cursory search of the room, and again, nothing seemed to be missing.

I had almost convinced myself that I must have been mistaken, that I had drunkenly forgot to put the case in front of the door, even though I distinctly remembered doing it, when I saw the folded paper sticking out of the pile of missing person flyers I had on the dresser.

My hand was shaking as I grabbed the note, unfolded it and read the single word written on it.


"LAKE"

That's it. Just the word "lake".

I fell onto the bed. My mind was racing with possibilities here. Did my sister drown in the lake? Did people cover it up? If so, WHY? None of it made any sense!

I grabbed a stack of fliers, snatched up the note and headed to town. I needed answers!
My first stop was the Police. When They saw me come in, they all seemed to tense up.
I explained about the break in, and they did not believe me.  Until I handed them the note.
The officer seemed shocked... he looked like someone just punched him in the gut. He waved the sergeant over and handed him the note.  The Sergeant also seemed stunned. They looked at each other in silence for a few seconds, then both turned and looked at me.

"I am sure this was a prank." the Sergeant said. "If I were you, i would leave town, head home and i am sure your sister will turn up.”

Furious, I yelled "Yeah? And what about the note?"
Looking dead in my eyes, the Sergeant crumpled the paper in his hand and said "What note?"

I was stunned. What the hell was going on here?  I backed slowly away, and left the police station. I glanced back, and saw the officer and Sergeant had followed me outside, where they were staring at me as I walked down the street.

Right as I turned the corner, I saw the Sergeant, while still staring at me, pull out his cell phone and make a call. His eyes never wavered from me, not even for a second.

I was unnerved. I was starting to get a little scared. there was something going on here, and my sister seemed to have been caught up in it.  As I thought about my sister, the feelings turned from fright to anger.  She was still missing, and no podunk Barney Fife police force was going to stop me from finding out where she is!

I headed for the Diner, the last place my sister's credit card was used.  Once again, I noticed the flyer I had taped up earlier was missing.  I went right back to where I had put it the first time, and with the cook and waitress watching me, I taped Two flyers up, right next to each other.  The cook shot the waitress a nervous glance, and went back to his griddle.  I sat at an empty booth and waited.

The Waitress did everything she could to avoid coming over, but I just sat there smiling at her, watching everything she was doing.  She kept darting glances at the cook, where he would shake his head almost imperceptibly.  Finally, she had no other choice but to come and take my order.
"What would you like?" she asked. She seemed so nervous she was almost shaking.

"I would like two things…" I replied, smiling. "A coffee.... and..."
She stood there, her pencil above the notepad waiting for the rest of my order.
"And information on why everyone in this town is pretending not to have seen my sister, you included,"
The waitress's eyes grew wide.. she looked over at the cook who was shaking his head no, not even trying to be subtle about it anymore.
"please..." she almost whimpered... "You need to just..." and right then, the Officer from the Police Station walked in, pointed at me, and motioned for me to go outside.

"What a surprise…" I mumbled to the waitress as i stood up. I was a little taken aback when i saw tears in her eyes. I was not sure if they were tears of fright, compassion or relief, but she was obviously shaken to her core.

I followed the Officer outside, where he turned to me and said "You need to leave. Now. Not tomorrow, not later. Now."

"No,” I snapped back. 
The officer got upset. "What do you mean no? I will arrest you for hassling these good people!"

"Then arrest me! Do it!" I yelled back. "It will be the first time I saw any cop in this town do anything he was supposed to do!"
The cop stared at me. He seemed to deflate a little bit. "listen... " he said quietly. "You need to go. That's all I am going to say. I ain't threatening you... I'm trying to protect you…" and having said that, he turned on his heel and left.

To say that I was confused is an understatement.  I needed to regroup, I needed to try and get my head around this.  I headed back to the BNB and my room, taking my food to go.
And that was when I started to get some answers....

 I sat down to eat the food I had taken from the diner, when I noticed there was something written up in the napkin. “Look on the bottom.” It said. 

I bumped the bottom of the bag as I did this, and felt the corner of a manila envelope sticking out from beneath. I surreptitiously pulled it out. “Don't open in public” was written on the top. The handwriting seemed to match that on the napkin. I opened the envelope on the bed and inside were just three short articles from the local newspaper.

**Body Found, Dam To be Drained – Wednesday, October 12**

>The Keele Dam, named after it's founder and local conservationist Jared Keele, will be drained to allow officials to search through the lake. On October 10th, Monday morning, a tourist was hiking when he came across the body of Deana Smith, who had previously been declared dead last August after she had been missing for a decade.

>The body's identity was confirmed through forensic testing, and evidence of foul play was found during autopsy. Local authorities have reopened the case of Deana Smith as a murder investigation, there are currently no leads. They intend to drain the lake starting at 12:00 pm on October 15 and ending at 7:00 pm on October 16.

>Authorities urge you to go be seen by your doctor if you have drank directly from the lake or swam in it with open wounds. We were unable to reach Jared Keele for comment, but sources say that he is devastated with the news and hopes for a speedy investigation.

**Old Island to Remain Uncovered, New BnB to Open – Wednesday, September 14**

>While local officials drained the Keele lake in search of bodies, an old nearly forgotten island was uncovered. An employee at our town library immediately started a petition to keep the island exposed for the pleasant view. During the hearing on September 8, many locals were able to express their concerns. A volunteer group was then formed to clear off the island and maintain it in order to appease citizens that believed the island a source of danger.

>Son of the recently deceased Jared Keele spoke of how his father wanted the island to remain covered, but agreed with the petitioner that the island improves the view. He plans to turn his father's place into a Bed and Breakfast by the spring, and feels the two could attract tourists. “His house had an excellent view of the lake, and now it will have an excellent view of the island,” he was quoted as saying.

**Night Lights on Keele Island – Wednesday, August 16**

>On August 12, there were multiple reports called into local authorities of suspicious flames moving about on the island at night. An officer was dispatched to the area and reported to have found no suspicious activity. After a brief investigation, it is believed to simply be one of those phenomenons that occur from time to time. Local businesses are excited to hear this, as the lights will help bring in tourists that enjoy viewing them. Mr. Keele has updated his listing on Airbnb to include a footnote about the phenomenon.

I looked up from the last article, it felt as though my veins were full of ice as I stared through the window at the island. August 12 was the last I had heard from my sister. First the note, then the envelope of articles. the way the town has been acting.. my answers laid on that island. I just knew it. Did these lights have something to do with her disappearance?

I had one more night left, I would wait till after dark then find a way to the island. I was a pretty decent swimmer, but the weather had turned a bit chilly recently. The article said something about a volunteer maintenance crew for the island, they must have a means of getting there. Perhaps a boat somewhere along the lake shore I could borrow for the night without anybody being the wiser.

It was about this time that somebody began pounding on my door. I crept to the door and peaked out, but didn't recognize them. They weren't the owners, and since they didn't have on a police uniform I could ignore them. “You've overstayed your welcome! Getch'er ass out here, or we'll help you find a reason to leave!” The larger of the two yelled.

How about no? I thought as I crept around and left out the back door. I had grabbed my belongings on the way out in case the rednecks decided to bust in and now I kept my eyes peeled for a good place to stash them.

Unfortunately there was no time. I heard the locals right behind me, and dropped my stuff in some bushes to distract them as I ran toward the lakeshore.

Luck didn’t seem on my side at first as I scanned the sands amid twilight, but then I saw the faint silhouette of a canoe. I immediately jumped in and paddled as I heard my pursuers shouting from the tall grass.

Before long their cries were muffled out by my paddle strokes and I was alone on the lake. The moon hung above like a glistening Pearl, it’s gleam causing the tiny island to glow. Were these the lights I’d read about? As I got closer I realized it was a variety of gemstones that poked out near the rocks, there were so many I was astounded that the townsfolk weren’t using these to make the town rich.

I knew as soon as I stepped foot on the island that something was off. The air felt cold and rigid, and no wind blew. There wasn’t even green grass. It was just a dark void in the night, with rocks jutting aimlessly toward the center.

Then I heard that howl, the same one that has plagued me since I arrived. It was right up ahead. It was loud and visceral, it made me think about leaving immediately. But I had to see if I could find my sister. I’ve made it this far.

I moved toward the noise, the stones blocking my view and making me feel like I was in a maze. It seemed to be coming from all directions. This howl was both terrifying and disturbing because it sounded like a creature in pain. Desperate for death to swallow it up.

Finally I reached a clearing and saw a large monolithic boulder with chains tied around it. The noises were coming from the other side.

As I drew closer, I realized the stone was made of pure silver, the largest I’d ever seen. And on the other side, I found the source of the growl, a beast straight from my night terrors. It was large and covered in dark fur, with fangs and claws the size of my head. I thought at first it was a werewolf but a closer look revealed gills and a fish hook tail. It was the strangest beastie I’d ever seen, and yet as I kept staring I realized that it was in pain and not a threat at all. Someone had captured it and left it here to die, I realized.

Then as the beast thrashed about I saw something familiar dangle around its neck. My sister’s locket, there was no mistaking it.

My mouth felt dry as I looked at the monster. Was this… thing, what was left of my sister?

I tried to reach for her but the creature only reacted in violence. She was angry, frustrated and confused by what was happening.

Then behind me I heard voices and immediately I hid. To my surprise I saw the bnb owners walking along arm in arm, cheerfully conversing as if there wasn’t a nine foot monster chained in front of them.

The husband was carrying a large wooden stake.

“Well, well. The offering is a good one this time…. Our boy Jared done good,” he mumbled as he used his weapon to poke at the monster playfully.

“Gonna eat good tonight,” she agreed. That name they mentioned sounded familiar but nothing was piecing together until I saw with my own eyes what they did.

As the moon reached its apex in the sky, the husband staked the wolf creature straight in the heart and I heard the mixture of my sister’s screams with the howl of the monster. It took all my strength to not stop them. The wife took out two goblets from her purse and they used them to pour blood from the wound into and then both drank greedily.

The older couple jerked and started to convulse, their bodies suddenly swollen and reverting to an earlier age. Before I knew what was happening, they looked even more youthful than I. And it was then I recognized their faces. The same ones I had seen in the article when referring to the Keele’s. But they were supposed to be long dead…

This monster, this ritual, was keeping them alive.

They laughed to themselves as they finished their bloody work and left my sister to bleed out.

My own blood boiled as I heard them talking about their next victim near the shore. Me.

“We need to find that boy who came to the cabin. You know these things run in packs. If we can turn him into his monster form and chain him up too we will have another century to ourselves,” the wife chuckled.

“Why should we do the work? The damn townsfolk have tried to betray us and send him away. I say we make those yokels do our dirty work. Or it will be their skin we grind up! Ha!”

They sailed away as I shook away my desperation and frustration and turned toward my sister.

They used you like cattle, and they’ll do the same to me, I realized fearfully.

I tried to recall the old legends of how someone could turn into a werewolf, a dream of revenge springing into my mind. Using my sister’s large claws, I cut myself straight across the face. Deep enough for the venom in her to deep into my blood.

As soon as I felt it, my body convulsed and I shook in pain. Except I knew I wasn’t going to be gaining any youth from this.

My goal would be to find the Keele’s and destroy them, make them suffer for what they’d done. I took the canoe back to the bnb and locked myself in as the transformation begins.

Unfortunately I think this means I will lose all sense of my sanity, of my humanity. I am fearful of when this moment comes, but also I know I will have to embrace it.

I must pray the locals can hunt me down and end this cruel life,

With both me and the Keele family dead, maybe this lake could finally be a proper tourist trap.

It’s a hopeful thought to hold on to as I slip away from sanity and join the animal kingdom. I leave all this in the journals here, to be found by their next visitor I suppose.

If you’re reading this, it likely means the Keele’s are still alive and I have failed.

Beware the lake. Beware the island and most of all beware of the howls.

For I can not control what I shall do next.
