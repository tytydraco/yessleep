For context, my grandma lives in a small village that me, my sister, and my cousin visit every summer. It has roughly 600 people. Most of them are elderly or middle-aged. There are hardly any kids, and the kids who do live there are either wannabe gangsters who ride motorcycles and smoke weed, or a bunch of 8-year-olds who are iPad kids and never touch grass. So there aren't many options for making friends or having fun.

That's why I decided I was bored of scrolling on my phone all day and wanted my summer to be full of adventure. That morning, I took my bike and went to explore the village's abandoned houses, hoping I could convince my sister and cousin to visit them with me that night. I found an abandoned house about five minutes away from my grandma’s place, and it was the perfect abandoned house—two stories, a big garden, and not many neighboring houses.

I didn’t go in because I was a chicken. I went back home and managed to convince both my sister and cousin to visit the house the following night. My grandma was scared. She advised us not to. I should have listened to her. But I didn’t.

The plan was to go in at 22:00 and spend at most an hour there. I was excited—finally, I would have some creepy stories to tell my friends.

Then came 21:30. Me (let’s call me Layla), my sister (let’s call her Liz), and my cousin (let’s call him Bob) were getting ready to go explore the abandoned house. We brought five flashlights (just in case), a camera (we wanted to record everything), some water bottles, hand sanitizer, wipes, our phones, and a knife (again, just in case).

I remember that moment so clearly. I was heading to the door when Liz stopped me and said, “Hey Layla, are you sure about this?”

I should’ve said no. I should’ve stayed home. I should’ve told Liz and Bob that going into that house would make us never want to step foot in that village again. But I didn’t. Because I was stupid. Instead, naive old me said, “Yes. Now come on, and don’t be a coward,” or something along those lines.

When we finally arrived at the house, Liz was hesitant. Despite being two years older than me, she wasn’t as brave as I was. Or used to be.

I told her we’d just go in for a few minutes, and if she got scared, we’d leave. That seemed to convince her, and we went inside.

The first thing I noticed was a big treasure chest in the center of the room. I wanted to explore the rest of the house first, then come back to it. I went upstairs only to find that the rooms were completely empty. Disappointment flooded me, but my mind was still on that treasure chest downstairs. Bob was still upstairs, desperately trying to find a secret passage or something, anything. Liz was starting to tear up.

“I have a bad feeling, Layla. Please, let’s just go,” she said.

I hated seeing my sister cry, so I called Bob from upstairs to wait outside with her and told them to give me a minute. But my sister—the overprotective big sis she is—told me to just hurry up and check the chest so we could leave.

As I opened the chest, hands trembling, heart pounding like a drum, I saw only one thing.

The photos.

And not just any photos—my family photos. And not just my family’s photos.

I grabbed them, ran out of the house, and rode my bike back home. I didn’t look at all of them. I wanted to be at the house, calm and safe, before going through them with Liz and Bob.

When we got back, my grandma was awake and hugged us tightly when she saw us. She said she’d been worried and told us never to do that again. We didn’t tell her about the photos—we didn’t want to worry her. We told her to go to sleep, and once she did, the three of us gathered in the living room to look at the photos.

We would never be the same after that.

The first photo was a family photo of our own. Nothing strange—except for the blue circles drawn around every family member. Circles that were obviously done with a pen. The only thing written on the photo: “Safe.”

The next photo made us stop.

It was a photo of a different family—a family I didn’t recognize. This time, a red circle was drawn around a man, maybe in his late forties. The other family members were circled in blue. The only thing written on the man? “Next.”

Liz was terrified at this point. She cried so hard she woke up my grandma. We quickly hid the rest of the photos but showed her the one with the red circle, carefully covering the text. We asked her who the man was, and she simply said that he had died a few years ago. When we asked how, she said"He was murdered,poor man,he was a nice guy"

That single sentence sent shivers down my spine. Liz, Bob, and I eventually decided to burn the photos. All of them. Even though we had only looked at two.

Grandma later told us that a priest used to live in that house—but he had died two years ago. We were never going to tell her what we had found. The only people who knew were me, Liz, and Bob. And we swore never to step foot in that house—or that village—again.

You know what? We did return—but now we prefer to spend our summers in the city instead of staying three whole months in that village. We only visit for one week now.

Grandma thinks we just grew up and don’t want to visit her anymore. That’s not true.

I wonder what that man had done to the priest so as to have a red circle drawn around him.

I wonder if the priest’s newlywed son who moved into the abandoned house knew about those photos—or if he would continue his father’s legacy.
