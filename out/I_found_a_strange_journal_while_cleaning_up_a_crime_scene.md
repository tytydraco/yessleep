   I've been working as a crime scene cleaner for almost 15 year now, last week I was hired to clean up what seemed to have been an apparent suicide, a man, reportedly 30 years old had carved a hole into a door by repeatedly hitting with a plank which he had ripped off of his bed and then slammed his eye onto a sharp spike or a stake that was created by the door, his body was not discovered until over a month later when his landlord sent a wellness check to his house after he had not paid his rent for over a week, (his payments were always on time) and he had also failed to respond to any of the landlords texts or phone calls, poor guy didn't have any family or friends who could check up on him, which I guess is another fact that points towards what happened to him being a suicide,

   The job itself was not too bad, well at least it was not as bad as most cases like this are. Thankfully, the door was already removed, and the man's corpse had been sent off for an autopsy, just in case of a possible homicide. While there weren't any signs of a forced entry, the man's bedroom, which he was found in, had been totally trashed. A desk had been flipped onto its side with a few books, a laptop, and a cup of coffee laying on the floor beside it. The coffee that was spilled from the cup stained a small circular off-white rug that lay in the middle of the room. The color of the stain matched the color of the rotting bodily fluids that flowed from the man's final resting place to the rug. The man's bed, too, had been flipped upside down and had one of its legs removed, which, as I previously mentioned, was used to carve a hole into the bedroom door.

   The room itself did not have any windows, which further increased the speed and severity of his decomposition. The bodily fluids and pus, which ranged in color from dark brown to yellow, had leaked from his bloated corpse and had spread around the room in a shape that somewhat resembled a spiderweb. At the end of one of these tiny rivers of gore was a single small notebook. Most of the notebook was untouched by the rotting human remains, except for the bottom right corner of the last few pages.

   The journal was started a few days before the presumed date of the man's death and did not have anything of substance written in it, at least up until around 5 pages in.

**ENTRY 1**  
*I started hearing the knocking like an hour ago at this pint. At first, the knocks were so distant from one another that I thought it was my mind playing tricks on me, but now it's constant; whoever's on the other side has been knocking nonstop without even a few second breaks for half an hour now, and it sounds like the interval between knocks is getting shorter.*  


   At this point, I think I have to intervene for a few seconds to mention that the autopsy results did not show any signs of drug use, and an entry early in the journal mentioned that the only mental illness he had was OCD, caused by childhood trauma that was caused by a break-in that led to the death of his mother. I also apologize for repeatedly referring to the man as "the man," but for privacy reasons, I cannot give his name.  


**ENTRY 2**

*It's been 5 minutes now, and the knocking still has not stopped yet; in fact, it has gotten worse, not just the speed but also the strength at which the door is being hit. At any point now, I think they'll break the door, and I don't have anywhere to hide. Thank god my paranoid ass installed that lock.*

**ENTRY 3**

*It's been another hour, at least I think. My computers completely stopped working a few minutes after the knocking began. The knocking has been getting even worse; the door is shaking so much that I'm impressed it has not fully fallen out of its hinges yet.*

**ENTRY 4**

*FUCK IT I'm opening the door. I've been in this fucking room listening to the knocking for god knows how long. It feels like it's been hours since I last wrote in here.*

**ENTRY 5**

*I can't open the door. First, I called out to whoever's on the other side, hoping that I could bargain with them, but I didn't get a response. I unlocked the door and tried to pull it open, but it wouldn't budge. I pulled on the doorknob with as much power as I could muster, but still, it wouldn't budge.*

**ENTRY 6**

*I didn't think that the knocking could get worse, but somehow it did. Now instead of distinct banging sounds that came right after each other, the knocks have turned into a single nonstop hum.*

**ENTRY 7**

*I can't keep doing this. I think a whole day has passed. I'm breaking the door down.*

**ENTRY 8**

*There's another door. At first, I tried to break the door down just by running into it and punching it with no success. Then, I tried to break off a leg off of my desk once again with no success, but finally, I tipped my bed over and broke off a leg. I repeatedly slammed the leg into the door, slowly chipping off small chunks of wood. Before I got through the door and saw what lay on the other side, I took a deep breath. Looking through the small lightning-shaped hole I had created, I saw the door to my bedroom just mere inches from the one I had broken through.*

**ENTRY 9**

*There's more of them. I carved the hole I created in the first door into the circle and then started working on the second door. Once I broke through that one, I was once again met with the same white door with the brownish gold colored doorknob. None of the doorknobs work, neither for the inside nor the outside; the knocking has not sopped yet.*

**ENTRY 10**

*I'm 5 doors in at this point and have to contort my body and slightly climb into the tunnel I have created to continue digging. I don't understand what is happening, and I try not to think about it. If I think about it, I'll get too scared to keep going, and this is something I don't want to abandon. I think I'll get the answers on the other side.*

**ENTRY 11**

*I think I'm on door 25 at this point, and I'm slowly running out of energy to crawl back. The next time that I go in there will be my last, and I'll either die of starvation exhaustion or reach the other side. No matter what, I don't think things going back to normal is possible now. goodbye.*

   That's the last of his entries. I don't know what to make of any of this, so I thought that I'd post about it here in an attempt to get an answer or at least some guidance to what the fuck could have happened to him. Any information that you might have will be appreciated. I might not be able to respond to comments for the next few hours or so. Because I'm going out on a date with my girlfriend, I just heard her knock on my door.
