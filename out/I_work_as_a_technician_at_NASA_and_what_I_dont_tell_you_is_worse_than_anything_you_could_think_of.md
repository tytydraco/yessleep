Let me start this post by saying I'm already breaking the law by just mentioning this. If this never comes out, or if it gets deleted, you'll know why. It won't be for any reason you might justify it as. I'm tired as shit while writing this, and I plan on running away to anywhere that will take me.

If you aren't aware already, all NASA launch sites, engineering headquarters, whatever, have a room that only a few select people can access. I was one of them, and our job was simple. We just needed to decode morse code. I was kind of confused at first at why I had to do it. We had computers in the same room, ones that could run a ridiculous amount of calculations. I kind of assumed it was some sort of human work that computers weren't strong enough to do yet? But that was kind of stupid too. They dropped a bit of a bombshell though. We were NEVER to mention our job, and when asked, say we were just technicians. I assumed it was classified, like military work or something, but I can't really question it that much, especially considering I just got a job as a "technician" at NASA. When I started translating the code, it felt almost like it just naturally came to me. Like I already knew how to solve it, what cipher it was encoded under. I was a bit stumped, but I felt like I needed to continue. I had a job to do after all. Thinking about would get in my way. I scribbled away, solving each letter easily.

I kind of just assumed this was my entire job. But as I solved each piece of morse code, it just got more confusing. They didn't seem like actual words, or anything that could be deciphered into a word. I had done all the typical ciphers in my head... it wasn't encrypted. You couldn't make a single word with any of the letters. Out of curiosity, I headed to my break. I suddenly felt an urge to type scramble the letters together of multiple of the translated codes with a cipher I can't name. I put them together, and I suddenly remembered the jumbled up letters I had found, the ones I couldn't make into a word. I used them as a decryption key.

I almost wish I stopped there, because then I would've left this up to the guys at the top to deal with. I decoded it again and again, in different ways. Right as I was about to give up, thinking it was just nonsensical translation data, I accidentally bumped my keyboard and added a simple 1 to the decryption key. It went from a nonsensical jumble of letters to a simple message. At first, I thought I had just made a mistake. It read "I'm still alive. Bring me back. This message is encrypted. I'm getting closer-" before it cut off abruptly. I felt shocked. The static jumble at the end was incomprehensible nonsense again, so I didn't look into it.

I realized then that I was an idiot. They were gonna kill me, whether they found out by tracing my activity on the internet, or by finding the paper. I grabbed my paper and scrunched it up. I'm glad I scribbled out my name first. All the things I had ignored out of pride, all the concerns I had that were shut down by the "classified staff members" were entirely valid. I grabbed my belongings and walked out at the end of the day.

I haven't come back since. I don't know exactly what that message was saying, but tracing the signal just led me to light years away. I'm glad I logged where it came from, but I can't disclose it. All you need to know is that it wasn't far enough away for me to not worry about it, close enough to where our best rockets, or at least the ones I know about, could reach there in tens of millions of years. 

Whatever I found out there, whether it be aliens or some cosmic entity, is lurking behind me, watching me at all times. I promise I'm not lying but I can't prove anything. If anyone can read this, I want you to know I didn't kill myself and that I never will. They're going to try to silence me. I know that. But I feel guilty sleeping with the burden that there's something coming closer and closer to us everyday.

Whether we like it or not, there's something that's looking out for us. Whether it be alien guests visiting their favorite zoo, or some sort of eldritch entity watching in the shadows. And whatever it is:

It doesn't like that I know.
