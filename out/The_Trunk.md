Years ago, he confined something to a trunk. He did not do so with courage or conviction, but with that frantic, graceless recoil of someone who cannot bear to look too long at a mistake steeped in shame. He fastened it with padlocks, as if iron could restrain what slips beyond language itself, and dragged it to the most remote corner he could find. He wishes he could say he forgot it. But forgetting is a privilege reserved for the unblemished.

Sometimes the trunk would tremble. It released faint sounds, like the murmurs of a creature unfamiliar with life yet stubbornly unwilling to surrender to death. From a distance, he heard it—its agitation echoing his own. He approached, compelled by the perverse curiosity of a condemned man who leans over the void even as the void leans back. But he never opened it. Not then.

A few years ago, he yielded to an impulse he still cannot decipher. He lifted the lid the slightest amount, and what he saw inside repudiated him outright. It unmade him. It was the living denial of the lies he recited to himself each day. It was dying, yes, but with that solemn, deliberate slowness known only to things that once mattered too deeply, as though its protracted agony sought to remind the world of the gravity of what had been lost. Its suffering immobilized him, reducing him to a futile spectator of his own unraveling. He slammed the lid shut, as if the violence of that gesture could crush the terror within. He added more locks, more bars, more layers of self-deceit. And he hid it in a place he prayed he would never stumble upon again.

Time passed, and the trunk emitted no sound. No movement—only a grave, immaculate stillness. Yet that stillness was its cruelest method of lingering. It did not pursue him; it regarded him. It allowed him to advance, to study, to feign stability… all the while knowing that any semblance of growth was a structure raised atop a corpse. Whenever a memory threatened to stir it, he inverted it—turning it into denial, contradiction, refusal. It is easy to flee when one believes that what one flees is already dead.

There were those who urged him to open it. They spoke with the serene confidence of people who have never held an abyss in their hands. He ascribed to them malice, naïveté, or a cruelty disguised as benevolence. Yet the voices multiplied. They were not driven by resentment, nor by a desire to witness his collapse. They simply did not understand. Or perhaps they understood with intolerable clarity.

He approached the trunk again. This time it did not stir. He thought: if it no longer lives, what harm could there be in opening it a little further? What threat can emerge from something devoid of breath?

The voices persisted: there is no evil inside. It was tempting to believe them. Evil, after all, rarely resides where it is most conveniently expected. He opened the trunk. What lay inside had long been dead, yet its corpse exhaled a revulsion that emanated not from its decay, but from the rot within himself. It was as though its decomposition pointed silently toward all the corruption he had cultivated outside.

At times, buoyed by those external assurances, he could endure its presence for a fleeting moment, like someone acclimating to the stale odor of a sealed room. But a single unguarded blink was enough for vertigo to seize him: his stomach knotted, his vision darkened, his body recoiled, and any peace—if it had ever existed—drained from him like cold, deliberate blood.

He understood then that what lay in the trunk was the incontrovertible proof of the decay of something that had once defined him. An incomplete being, unable to die because it had never been permitted to be born. Its condition was not accidental, but carefully, cruelly engineered. Its disintegration spoke of what might have been: a life lived without guilt’s oppressive weight, without fear’s constant surveillance. A life mundane, perhaps, or at least one less conscious of its own fragility. But nothing remained intact now, and the mind—stubborn in its compulsive need to comprehend—only deepened the wound. 

What is one to do when one looks inward and finds that the part meant to be saved perished long ago?

Live beside the corpse in the trunk, allowing it to consume what remains of identity?

Shut the trunk again, condemning it to a silence that offers no salvation?

Expose it, knowing no one truly wishes to bear a horror that is not their own?

What answer is there?

He does not know.

And he fears that the absence of an answer is, in itself, the final verdict.
