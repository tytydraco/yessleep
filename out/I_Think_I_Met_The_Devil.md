My name is Celeste Ambrose. My hair is curly, brown with red highlights. My green eyes are wide and rimmed with a viscous mixture of makeup and tears as I take in the almost glowing image of the tall, bespectacled and redheaded man before me. I could barely hear above my heartbeat as his smooth, tenor voice politely asked, “Miss? Are you alright?”

The concern in the man's voice set in like dry ice in my gut. His glow disappeared almost immediately as I fell against the wall. I hadn't noticed how weak my knees were. The man repeated himself a couple times before I raised my hand and waved it off. In a dry rasp, I replied, “I'm sorry, yes. I'm fine. I don't…”

The stranger finished my sentence as if he'd heard it a million times before, “You don't know what happened, right?”

Leaning down, the man looped his arms under mine. Lifting me to my feet effortlessly, he continued speaking, “It'd be best to give your legs a bit to rest. Come, sit.”

I didn't protest, still scanning the man's face through a sort of mental haze as he carried me. It felt as if we'd met a long time ago, but I knew I'd only just met him. The man sat down with me on a bench across the hall from the apartments’ elevators. The man removed his hand from around me, straightening out his suit's jacket. As he did this, I took in a deep breath and exhaled slowly to compose myself. Looking at him out of the corner of my eye, I kept trying to figure out where I'd seen him before. Someone famous wouldn't have been in my cheap apartment complex. His eyes caught mine, and I immediately averted my gaze. I felt a wave of heat grow on my cheeks as he chuckled and said, “My name's Sam. I'm not from around here, just meeting up with an old friend. You live here?”

I nodded my head, clearing my throat and wiping my eyes before cautiously speaking, “I'm Celeste. Nice to meet you, I think?”

The stranger's eyebrow raised as he asked, “Have we met before?”

With a shrug, I replied, “I have no fucking clue. Maybe. What school did you go to?”

The man hummed under his breath as he thought to himself. It took him a long while before he spoke in an almost unsure tone, “Crowley High School, then UCLA. You?”

The mention of Crowley sent shivers down my spine. My eyes immediately snapped to the man's face, scanning it further. Freckles across his cheeks and nose, vibrant, emerald green eyes, pale skin, and glasses. I squinted before the man's face became grim, his eyes finding the floor as he said, “Ah…you must have gone to the same High School as I did. By the look you're giving me, I think you may have heard of me.”

My blood ran cold as I let his image set in. The man I was fawning over finally had a fuller identity to me. My lips opened slowly, the tension in my body telling me to run as I asked, “Sam Thompson, right? Is what they said happened true?”

Sam's lips pursed as his eyes closed. He gave a long sigh, nodding as he slowly admitted, “Some parts. Crowley, as a town, had it out for my family from the start. I'll admit to burning the school down, but…”

A look of pain crossed his somber face before he stood. Sam adjusted his sleeves as he simply stated, “I'll have to go. I have no doubts that I'm late as it is. I’m sorry for earlier, I hope you feel better soon.”

I just sat there, blinking away the confusion. I hadn't been trying to drive him away. Somewhere from that deep, eternal aether inside, part of me screamed for me to reach out. To say something, anything, but the rest of my being denied the demands. He simply moved into the elevator and gave me a kind smile and nod as the doors shut. Placing a hand above my heart, I stood strode into the lobby of my apartment building. Practically shoving my way through the front doors, I tried to calm myself. I wondered about what had happened back when I first saw him. It felt like love at first sight, but replayed in my mind's eye like an intense infatuation with him. It had felt like the entire world centered on him for that moment, like nothing else mattered. I remember the sensation of falling, but I hadn't truly felt it.

I continued on with my day as usual. I had been visiting the usual suspects on my half-hour break from the relatively cushy office job I'd managed to score for myself. It had just so happened that I was stopping by my plug's house. I'd been self-medicating with opioids for years, so it wasn't really a special visit. As I knocked on the door, I felt a pair of eyes on me. Giving a quick glance around, my right hand began to make its way into my purse. Just as my fingers wrapped around the handle of a knife I'd kept stashed within, the door opened. Josiah welcomed me in, his right hand finding my left shoulder as he said in a soft and warm baritone voice, “Hey, Celeste. I assume you want the usual?”

With a meek nod, I let go of the knife's handle and stepped into his apartment. He passed me a blunt from a table near the door, giving a kind smile as I took it with my right hand. I took a long breath, letting the smoke fill my lungs. Of course, I followed the normal ritual of holding my breath. Usually, I shot for about 15 seconds. This time, I'd only managed twelve before the smoke forced its way out of my lungs in a rough, wheezing cough. My lungs lit ablaze as I sat on his couch. It was soft, the woven fabric feeling almost plush beneath my skin as I staggered my breaths to avoid a coughing fit. I held the blunt in my fingers, my left hand grabbing my wallet. Unclasping it, I pulled out precisely $150 that I had separated from the rest of my wallet's contents. I looked around for Josiah, taking another hit off the blunt. After transferring the folded bills, I held both the money and the blunt in the air while resting my elbow on the couch's arm.

From behind me, I heard a soft thump behind the rock music that played over the speakers. It didn't register just what was going on. Figuring Josiah was just taking a moment, I leaned back and just continued waiting. After a few minutes passed, I stood and called out, “I'ma leave with this if you don't come get it, man!”

My voice went unanswered. The feeling in the house slowly turned, the previously-comforting room gained an air of dread to it. I slowly stepped back, hearing a few more thumps. Placing the blunt in my lips, I retrieved the knife from my bag. Holding it in front of me, the steel blade of my bowie knife glinting harshly in comparison to the rest of the smoky home. I called out, “Come out before I call the cops! I'm not stupid, a drug charge is better than dying!”

The response that came next froze me in place. “Hello, again, Miss Celeste,” the suited man said as he stepped through the hall bedroom's door. He straightened his tie, asking, “Do you truly want to do that? I may look neat, but I can give you a fight if you truly want it.”

I shook my head, the knife lowering about a foot as my mind failed to understand how this was happening. There he was again. Sam Thompson, in the flesh, complete with a dapper maroon suit and sunny disposition. He stepped closer as my lips opened. They failed to produce any words. A deep feeling of horror filled my body from the feet up as he pulled the knife from my grasp. With a nod, he asked, “What did Josiah owe you, if I may ask? I could fill the order for you.”

With that one sentence, my dread became drenched in confusion. Even as I stood there, picking out the slightest pinpoint spots of blood on his hands, I couldn't help but wonder what the hell was even happening. I pulled the folded bills from my pocket and held them out to him. Before I could say, he held up a hand and firmly stated, “Consider it on the house.”

Frozen there once again, my voice slowly squeaked out, “Two bottles of perc 30s and an ounce of weed.”

Sam smirked, raising an eyebrow and pausing mid-turn as he asked, “That it, huh?”

His voice dipped into a low chuckle, but one second of sound sent my fear levels through the roof. Below his voice, I swore I could hear a bassy rumble. It almost sounded like growling. Deep, dark and almost hateful, like a beast hidden nearby. Sam simply nodded, turning as he stated, “How about I just give you what he has left of both, huh? Wouldn't want you to go without on my behalf.”

I stood there, dumbstruck while glued to the floor. I didn't understand what Sam would be doing here. The world slowly, repetitively turned on either side of me. Bile rose up my throat, creeping its acidic fingers up the back of my tongue. Leaning on my right hand on the wall, I forced myself to stay upright. My eyes were locked on Sam as he left the bedroom with a pillowcase full of drugs. He was immediately in front of me.

“Come, now. I'll stay here with you until you're nice and sobered up,” Sam said as he weaved his arm underneath mine. His smooth tone continued with a polite, “I won't let you drive out of here if this is what weed does to you.”

The blunt's cherry burned against my lips as if on cue. I spat it forward, hissing under my breath as Sam guided me back to the couch. I took the pillowcase and looked up at him. I finally managed to stammer out, “What are you doing here?”

Sam looked down at me, thinking with that same hum. This time, however, I swore I saw his eyes flash a vibrant orange as he answered in a smooth chuckle, “I'm here for business. Not dissimilar to what you're doing.”

The pause that followed stretched into infinity before I gave a soft giggle. It felt like a joke to me. Sam was a surprisingly straight-edge person when I knew him as a kid. He never gave people with habits any grief, either. If anything, he stayed in the circle of addicts and wannabe-musicians by choice. It was an odd contrast between him and the man I was watching walk into the bedroom once more. I looked down at my purse, fishing out my pack of cigarettes as I took the moment just to breathe. Running my palms along the couch's fabric, I found the tip of my cigarette suddenly lit. Instinct took over and I took a drag. Letting the smoke flow from between my lips, I inspected the curious sight. I shook my head, looking around and calling out, “Hey, did you just light my cigarette?”

Sam called out to me from near the back door now, “I did, yes. Why do you ask?”

“Oh, uhh…I must've forgotten,” was what came from my lips. How much of a lie those words were, I had no idea. At this point, I felt like Josiah decided to lace his blunt from what was happening. It didn't make any sense. From the strangeness of his eyes lighting up to the fact that he'd given me the entire stash in a pillowcase, none of it lined up. So I stood, only moderately unsteady as I walked toward the back door. Sam turned to me from the doorway, asking with a raised eyebrow, “Are you feeling well?”

I shrugged, looking him up and down. I reached out a hand, asking, “You'd tell me if you weren't real, right?”

The hint of concern in his face turned to a more puzzled expression as he replied frankly, “Of course. however, if you're having doubts, I'll tell you a secret about me.”

Sam looked outsidd, shutting the door as he stated, “I'm not allowed to lie. So just ask me.”

Without a moment's hesitation, I asked in a strange soup of word-vomit, “Tell me what's outside that door!”

Sam's eyes widened in shock as his expression fell. He squinted before slowly replying, “The rest of the world. Should something specific be there?”

The vagueness of his answer elicited a smile across my face. I felt my confidence rise, vindication filling me for a moment. Then, beyond the joy-burst from the high, I felt a cold pit form in my stomach. The next words rolled out of my mouth in a vaguely-questioning tone, “Josiah, maybe?”

Sam's cool expression fell. He let out a sigh, pushing the door open. Josiah sat outside, his mouth taped shut with his hands and ankles bound by zip-ties. My eyes locked with his, then with Sam's. His eyes were burning orange from the moment I looked into them. I trembled in place as he asked in an annoyed tone accompanied by the same growling tone as before, “What are we gonna do about this, Celeste?”

There were no words that could have come close to the bewilderment that I felt in that microsecond. My stomach's contents flowed up into my mouth. Forcing it back down with a shudder, I open my lips and say nothing. Only a confused grunt came as I backed up. I grabbed the wall, following it to the couch and grabbing the pillowcase. Holding it up, I stated, “I'll take these and go, you clearly have this handled and I'm not helpinIn an instant, I bolted through the front door. As my feet cleared the doorway, I lost my balance and fell forward. I felt my forehead collide with the ground, my sight becoming a burst of white before settling into an intense, dark vignette. I had to have lost consciousness because, when my eyes opened, I was sitting in the parking lot of my apartment in the front seat of my car. Between my feet sat a pillowcase of what seemed to be pills and weed. Retrieving the parcel, I opened it to inspect the insides. As expected, there were pills and weed in two neat, separate packages. Alongside them was an orange sticky note stuck to the top. It read, ‘Be well. My number is enclosed, should you feel the need to reach out. - Samael Thompson.’ I blinked in confusion, not even registering that what had once been a bright and sunny day had turned to night. There was still so much that I wanted to know as I sat there. My fingers clutched the bag shut tightly, pulling it to my chest as I opened the door of my car. Stepping out, I made my way into the stairwell entrance in pursuit of my apartment.

This is where I stand. My name is Celeste Ambrose, I am 24 years old, and I think I witnessed my long-term drug dealer's murder. I think that the same boy who once burned down an entire high school campus six years ago in Crowley, a town nobody I've ever met has heard of, is responsible. I think I'm going to follow up on the feeling in my gut. Even if it ends poorly, I don't feel right leaving it alone. I need so many answers, but one rings loudest above all the rest: Who the hell is Samael Thompson?
