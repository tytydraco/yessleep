There is something I haven't told anyone in my life. I don't know who to share it with, so I feel doing it here might help. This might be slightly long, so please bear with me. 


I belong to a small city in India. The incident I am going to talk about, happened 17 years ago in 2006. Before I talk about the incident, I have to give a little background to the paternal side of my family. 


My grandfather was a police officer. He worked all over the state and finally decided to settle in a small village located in one of the northern districts of the state. My father has 4 brothers (two elder and two younger) and 4 sisters (one elder and three younger). They were a pretty big family, but after the daughters got married, the sons decided to leave the village to start their life somewhere else, except the second son. He along with his wife and son decided to stay back in the village and live with my grandparents. 


Our village had a college, which was a popular educational institute for the area, including the nearby districts. Now my uncle's sister in law, Deepa, got admitted into this college in 2004 and started living with them. I guess the duration of the course was 3 years. She was a bright student and did well in college too. Our whole family used to get together in our village during the months of October-November, to celebrate the festival of Durga Puja. We had met her too and we were fond of her. She was shy yet really nice to talk to. She used to play with us and also tell us stories from her childhood. 


Early 2006 is when tragedy struck. Deepa suffered from high fever one night. The doctor in the village told them to take her to a bigger hospital because it looked serious. Turns out she was suffering from brain malaria. By the time they reached the hospital, the doctor said it was now beyond their control. She passed away in the hospital within a couple of days. It was a shock because she was really young and it does feel sad when someone you've interacted and bonded with passes away. 


October came, and it was time for our family get-together. Now let me tell you the layout of our village house. It was a pretty big house in the shape of a square. On one corner was an entry passageway, the corner diagonally opposite to that was the exit to the huge backyard that we had. On the other two corners, there were two big bedrooms. Now everyone was in the house. One night after dinner, most of us were in one of the corner bedrooms chilling, some had gone to sleep, the other bedroom at the corner was empty. Suddenly my cousin, who was around 5 years old then came into the room and asked "where will she sleep?" 

The elders were confused. They enquired. He said "that aunty in the other room"

All of us went to the room to check. No one. 

He was asked what she looked like. He was unable to describe her properly but said that she was wearing a floral nightgown. I could see the faces of the elders freeze. He had somewhat described what Deepa was wearing on her last day here. No one slept that night (or at least I think so because I slept off). The next morning everyone left. That night my cousin suffered from very high fever and he was almost on the verge of passing out. The medicines were not working. Everyone was extremely worried. 


A couple of days later, his fever started to go down a little. My aunt went to give him some medicines and she saw him play with what looked like a gold ring. She asked him how did he get it and he said "the blue nightgown aunty gave me" 

He said, that night when he met her, she had given him the ring. He had hidden it in his pocket thinking he would be scolded then. 


Now all of us went back to the village, this had become an emergency meeting of sorts. My aunt i.e Deepa's elder sister admitted that she had stored some of her belongings in a small bag and placed it in a storage space that is at the top of that corner room where she was seen. It was impossible for a full grown adult to reach the space without a ladder, so a 6 year old reaching that spot was out of the question. 


A priest was consulted. He conducted a few rituals, where at the end he put the ring back in the back, tied it down with a black thread and placed it in a burning pyre. He said that her spirit has gone away now. All of us were convinced about it. 


This is why I am sharing this story. Now everyone knows about my cousin getting the ring, but what they don't know is that the night before that, a kid had woken up in the middle of the night to go to the washroom and he saw Deepa standing at the backdoor. Deepa gave him a silver locket and then went through the door to the backyard. The kid looked out through the window but could only see a blanket of darkness outside. The kid was scared out of his wits but was also excited. He decided to not tell about it to anyone. You must have already guessed who the kid is, isn't it?


Now I thought I would tell my mother back then, but I thought she might be harmed, so I kept this like my little secret and I always kept the locket with me. About 17 years have passed since the incident and I have moved to one of the biggest cities of the country. Recently, I started hearing voices and my sleep paralysis attacks have increased in frequency. I had them regularly since I was a kid, but now it happens almost everyday. Whenever I am alone in the house, I do get a feeling that there is someone else in the room. I haven't exactly experienced anything, but something feels wrong in my gut. 


What should I do? Should I tell my family or should I talk to some priest and try to see what can be done?
