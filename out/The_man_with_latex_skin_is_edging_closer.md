I don’t know where it came from. The first night I saw it I woke up in the middle of the night. My throat screamed for water and my sheets were wet with sweat. I blamed it on a nightmare that faded before I was conscious. I wasn’t awake enough to distinguish thought from action, so it took a few minutes of imagining getting water before I finally got out of bed. The cold wood helped clear my mind, but it still felt like an eternity from my bedroom, down the stairs, into the kitchen and finally the fridge. 

The house was quiet, only a low rumble from the AC, running hard in the middle of summer. I was grabbing the disposable water bottle out of the fridge when a creak, loud enough for me to turn around.  Just the kitchen, messy, smelling faintly like potatoes. The only light poured out from the refrigerator and in its cold light nothing stirred. I figured it was the house settling, that’s something people say right? I closed the door and brought my water upstairs—creak. This time right behind me. 

Do you know that feeling of being chased up your dark stairwell at night? I felt that like never before. My heart nearly burst from my ribs as I moved up the flight faster than I dreamed I could move. It turned out it was faster than I could move because I clipped my foot on the top step and fell face first into the wall at the top of the stairs. For the first time I was glad I lived alone. The pain and embarrassment eased my fears. It shouldn’t have. Once the bright pain faded I sat facing down the stairs. It was dark but I saw enough. Too much. 

A round, bulbous head sat atop an impossibly thin neck. Where its face should have been there were only  yawning holes, blacker than the surrounding night. The skin caught the minuscule amount of light and shined like latex. The body was thin vaguely human. I don’t know if it was the darkness that made my mind fill in details but there seemed to be zippers running down the front of the thing. 

I screamed, tearing my throat apart with the effort. The shriek echoed down the stairwell. The thing took an awkward step forward. It couldn’t have been real, but my body told me to run, and I did. I locked myself in my bedroom. Pulled my dresser down to block the doorway and curled up in the closet. Waiting to die. 

The morning came and I peeled my eyes apart. I had fallen asleep waiting for that thing to come barging into my closet and destroy me. My head ached and my muscles resisted movement. Clothes and dresser drawers covered the floor. It wasn’t a nightmare but I discounted the experience as a hypnogogic hallucination, like sleep paralysis. It was what I needed to continue to function for the next few weeks. 

Today I saw it again. I work at a tobacco processing  facility; sweeping the long corridors between the dryers. My days consist of walking up and down the open areas, wearing a respirator to save my lungs from the tobacco dust. I was doing my job as I always do, headphones in and wishing I was anywhere else. Over the sound of my music I heard what I assumed were screams from the rotating two-story grinder next to me. I rushed up the ladder to get a look and help. 

Down inside the machine, there was almost no light, and I strained to make out any details. With my headphones out I heard nothing but the churning machines but deep in the rotating gears and teeth I saw that reflective, almost slick latex skin—Then the open abysses for eyes. As clear as I heard my music earlier I heard a voice, right behind my ear, “you were supposed to be inside with me.”

I can’t think of anything else, or what I should I do. It’s not a hallucination and I don’t know what it wants with me. Please help me.
