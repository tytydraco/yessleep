Me,Eddie,Martin and Jayden quickly made our way to the facility, making sure to be quiet, I avoided the leaves that littered the forest floor. We were a couple feet away from the main entrance now, hiding behind a couple of trees when we decided to put our plan into action. I quickly walked up to the  guards and acted confused and hurt. They immediately pulled their guns out from their holsters  and pointed them at me.

"H-Hey, I'm lost, do you guys know where a local hotel is"? I asked nervously.

The guards looked confused and one of them spoke up.

"State your name and identification". The first guard demanded.

"U-Uhm, I'm lost. I am a local hiker and I need to get back to civilization". I said.

"You're pretty far from civilization. Let me just check to see you're  not on "the list". He said, annoyed.

I stood there nervously as they searched through a list and photos. I was wearing different clothing and my hair was hidden with a hat I put on right before talking to them.

The guards kept glancing at me and one picture and I knew Eddie and Martin had to act fast. I suddenly watched as Eddie and Martin came from behind and injected the guards in their necks with some liquid.

"What did you do to them"?! I asked.

"Just some tranquilizers, should keep em knocked out atleast a couple hours". Martin said.

I watched as Eddie and Martin quickly stole the guards uniforms and took out some handcuffs.

"Wait what if we get separated "? Jayden protested as Eddie placed the cuffs on his wrists.

"You will have the keys to your own cuffs". Eddie said and handed Jayden and I keys to our handcuffs.

We walked inside with little to no difficulty. As we continued through the corridors, not many people questioned us as we quickly made our way to the directors office. 

As we reached the directors office, Eddie handed one of the guards a key card and they grunted in approval. We walked inside and the door slammed shut.

"Why are you all here". A familiar voice said.

"We have found 2 people trying to sneak in-" Martin went to say but was cut off.

"We are not stupid, Martin." Someone else said from the corner of the room.

We watched in shock as Inspector Harrison walked out of the shadows and stood next to Rebecca.

"You knew"?! Eddie asked, somewhat shocked but mostly annoyed.

"It was really obvious, and we saw the whole scenario play out on the cameras. You never were great at plans, were you Eddie? You just brought yourself to us and now we can finish you off along with....Wait, wheres that kids pesky friends"? Harrison ranted.

I stayed silent despite his cold eyes demanding an answer. During this brief moment, Jayden took out his gun and went to shoot Rebecca but was stopped by Inspector Harrison taking out his gun and pointing it at Martin.

"You really are an annoying bunch. I'm surprised you managed to even sneak in". Rebecca said and stood up, revealing 2 pistols that were aimed at Eddie the entire time.

I quickly took out Bryson's desert eagle while everyone was distracted and shot Inspector Harrison in his chest. Harrison went to shoot but missed and Rebecca quickly managed to pull off a single shot before Jayden shot her in her side. We thought we were ok but we heard a third thump as Eddie fell to the ground, wheezing.

"Shit, is there any medical supplies here"?! Martin asked frantically.

I looked around but there didn't seem to be anything useful. I was suddenly grabbed by my leg and I looked down to see Harrison angrily glaring at me.

"IF I'm not making it out alive, neither are you, Kid". He loudly whispered and aimed his gun directly at my head.

I closed my eyes and waited for it all to end when 2 shots rang out. I opened my eyes to see Jayden shooting Inspector Harrison repeatedly until he stopped breathing.

"T-Thanks...". I said.

Jayden didn't respond and quickly ran to help out Eddie.

I rushed over to see a large pool of blood under Eddie as I saw the life in his eyes flickering.

"Eddie..." Martin mumbled.

"Hey, kid....Look..." Eddie said, taking long breaths in between words.

"I...I know that i....put you through... a lot..." He said, coughing out blood.

"But....don't worry....." He loudly whispered as he took a piece of paper out of his pocket and handed it to me with his shaking, white hands.

"I....kept.....my...." He said, now barely audible.

"promise......". He said and took one last breath before closing his eyes.

"He's not breathing. HE'S NOT BREATHING"! Martin said frantically.

I quickly barricaded the door after someone had knocked, followed by banging.

"What do we do"?! I asked.

Martin and Jayden looked at me and then to the door. We quickly made a plan and hoped it would work...

The guards broke the door to see the scene in front of them.I stood over the bodies of the 3 Dead bodies and Martin and Jayden pretending to be hurt in the corner of the room. They quickly detained Me as Martin got to his feet and said he would take me to a cell. Jayden also got up and went with Martin to "Make sure the prisoner didn't escape".

The guards didn't object as they had to call more guards to the scene and deal with the crisis.

We quickly made our way to the reception area. We had to abort our first plan because Eddie was now KIA and our only hope was to contact the government through the reception area. We quickly got to the reception area and we encountered a problem. None of us knew the government's call number. I frantically read through the paper Eddie gave me for any info that could help when on the back of the page I saw a code: "1787". 

We called that number on one of the government's computers and Martin sent them the following message:

"Facility 14 has been overrun, we have killed the leaders of the rebellion but we need more assistance to retake control. As you know, facility 14 has been offline for the past XX amount of days and has been unresponsive due to such rebellion".

Martin sent the message and a couple seconds later, we were swarmed by guards.

"Damn it, they realized it was a trick"! Martin yelled to the rest of us as we were separated. I thought this was the end for us but then to everyone's shock, Rebecca walked towards us, holding her side which was now bandaged.

"You really think you three can escape this place alive after what you did? We will sacrifice you to the pilgrim and he will praise us". She ranted.

"Wait...What"?! Jayden asked, shocked. "We killed the Pilgrim, it's dead"! He continued.

"You cannot simply kill a God". Rebecca stated.

"Why are you even worshiping the pilgrim, he will KILL all of you"! I said frantically.

"Don't lie, he only kills those who do not worship him". She said, now annoyed.

"Wait, your telling me the whole reason the facility had a rebellion is because some of you worship some supposed "God" that we were sent to kill?! You're all CRAZY"!! Martin yelled.

"IT doesn't even matter anymore, we killed it"! I said, reinforcing what Jayden said.

"You fools...". Rebecca started. "You cannot kill the Pilgrim. He will re-manifest in those who have killed him and he will raise from the ashes to rule this world"! She said.

"She's unhinged". Jayden whispered to me and pointed towards my gun with his free hand.

While the guard holding me was busy staring at Rebecca I grabbed my gun and pointed it towards Rebecca.

"I don't care about your stupid cult. I don't care about whatever god you worship and I certainly don't care about whatever "prophecy" you made up"! I said loudly and Pulled the trigger at Rebecca.

I looked in shock to see a guard had dived into the way and took the bullet for Rebecca. I quickly went to pull off another shot when the wall next to Rebecca was smashed forward. The dust clouded my vision  and I shot off another bullet in her direction, hoping I hit her. As the dust cleared I looked in Horror to see Darius standing in front of Rebecca, with a single gunshot in his chest.

"D-Darius"?! I asked, shocked.

He didn't respond and I looked closer to see that he didn't have pupils.

"What the f-" Martin went to say but Darius slammed his fist into Martin, sending him and the guard restraining him, to the nearby wall.

All the guards started running but Rebecca just stood there calmly, smiling at me.

I quickly grabbed Jayden and started running away from the scene.

"W-What about Martin"!!? Jayden screamed at me.

I didn't respond and kept running, dragging him with me. We made it to the medical bay and I barricaded the doors.

"Was that...Darius"? Jayden asked.

"I don't know". I said.

"But he looked almost exactly the same-" He went to say but I cut him off.

"I DON"T KNOW, OK?!! I CAN'T DO THIS RIGHT NOW JAYDEN! I.. I need to think". I said and went to the computer and started typing this out.

I don't know what to do. I don't know what's happening. I can't think with so many questions zooming through my mind. IF anyone knows anything, ANYTHING that can help...I really need it. Please...

I'll try to keep in touch... I...I promise.
