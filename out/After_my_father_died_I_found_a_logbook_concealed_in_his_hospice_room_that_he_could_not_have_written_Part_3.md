Never in my life have I experienced such a relentless case of insomnia as I did after reading the details of John’s “second translocation”.

My left eye was identical to Atlas’ left eye. Both eyes bore a striking resemblance to the[ sigil](https://imgur.com/a/symbol-above-every-entry-Rb2VbHP), which was omnipresent but completely unaddressed in all of John’s entries.

It felt like all the residual thoughts and questions surrounding the contents of the deathbed logbook had begun to occupy actual physical space - every time I repositioned my head on my pillow I could feel the weight of those ruminations slosh around in my skull, the partially coagulated thoughtform taking a few moments to settle out like the fluid in a magic eight ball. Eventually, I gave up on sleep entirely. I resigned myself to reviewing the events described in John’s logbook, trying to inspect each piece from every possible angle in order to glean an epiphany, as if that epiphany would act as some sort of figurative Ambien. Unfortunately, it became clear that I was still missing some crucial components to this narrative, and I could divine nothing additional from the information I already had absorbed that would pacify my ragged psyche. I needed more. 

Cup of coffee in hand, I reluctantly sat back down at my office desk. I glanced over at the clock - 330 AM. After taking a few deep, meditative breaths, I did what I could to brace myself and I flipped over another menu. 

For the next several logs I read that night, I don’t believe there will be any utility to me reproducing them here in their entirety. First and foremost, there is a certain amount of redundancy to some of the entries that may only serve to cast a fog over the through-line of the events described. Maybe more critically, however, is my fear of incompletion. My health has again worsened since the last time I uploaded a post. I am anxious to put a pin in this, so I will use the space below to synthesize those entries to keep things moving at a reasonable pace. Before I begin, I do feel like I need to address how I scarred my left eye. 

Death marches indifferently towards all of us from the moment we are born - sometimes gradually, sometimes swiftly. If you had asked me a year ago which was preferable, assuming you were forced to make a selection, I would say a swift death, without a single shred of hesitation in my response. Bearing witness to the stepwise loss of my dad’s identity over the last five years has been indescribably tortuous. And to clarify, I really do mean that it has been indescribable. I genuinely don’t know the appropriate words to describe the abject horrors of dementia. God knows I’ve tried to find them. It’s like watching someone’s soul rot. Each passing day, a small piece of your loved one is involuntarily divested, dissolving into the atmosphere like steam. But, unlike with my fiancé, I had ample time and space to say my goodbyes, I suppose. 

With no creativity whatsoever, my response to John’s disease was to bottle up my emotions and turn to liquor as a means to dull my senses. Tale as old as time. Wren, my fiancé, tried to help me. But I was ritually intoxicated, forlorn and distracted, and when it mattered most, I did not see the stop sign. In complete contrast to John, I lost her instantaneously. I, on the other hand, only sustained a deep laceration to my left eye and a few fractured ribs.

Wren knew I loved her, thankfully. I had taken the time to let her know how much she meant to me, telling her she was my kaleidoscope. Looking through her, the world could appear vibrant and worthwhile, and I made sure she knew that.

In another twist of the knife that almost feels poetic, John didn’t have the wherewithal to talk me through how he processed the guilt of his crash (having endangered his life and the life of others by ignoring the fact that he wasn’t supposed to be driving himself to work with a newly diagnosed seizure disorder). He couldn’t tell me how he coped with suffocating regret. My father was just too far gone by the time Wren died.

Two dimming stars in the moonless night that had nearly crossed paths - John and I were following similar trajectories, but we were just a little too distant from each other to communicate.

I need to move on from this topic, otherwise I’ll never complete this. Just know that after the events of the last year, I don’t have such a clear-cut answer for which death is worse.

Not anymore. 

Selected excerpt 1: April, 2005

“\[...\] *One thing I have noticed upon reflection is that some of my memories in the past few years do not feel entirely my own. I have spent months recovering from my crash (seizure and translocation free, thankfully), which has allowed me the opportunity to review my cache of recollections in full. From at least the year 2000 and on, I feel like I have only the imprints of my memories - they are just files stored on a biological hard-drive. I can access them, open and close them, but I do not feel like I myself experienced them.*

*Lucy attributes this all to the stress of my position at CellCept, with a resulting depression draining those more recent memories of their inherent technicolor. I have considered this, but I am not so sure. Although I have taken the time to confirm these abnormally textured memories are not false, i.e. confirmed with others that they did actually happen as I can recollect them, I just do not feel I was there when they were made. But I clearly was* \[...\]”

An important insight. I will come back to it soon. 

Most of the entries pre and post-crash are very introspective and well put together. After explaining his theorem regarding why sound disappears with the arrival of Atlas in his translocations and how that could represent the “inverse of a memory” (see the end of post 2), he picks up where he left off in trying to prove the existence and scientific underpinnings of his translocations. To save you all the trouble, I have omitted most of the entries dedicated to mathematically proving his translocations. Personally, I have grappled with the “noise canceling headphones” metaphor for quite a while before I felt like I had the gist of it. Little did I know that this was the equivalent of kindergarten arts and crafts when compared to his subsequently described theorems. If you have a PhD in calculus, biophysics and electromagnetism, feel free to message me privately and I’ll send over some pictures. For us laypeople, it’s best to skip ahead to this next piece: 

Selected excerpt 2: July, 2005

“\[...\] *the biophysical motion as calculated does seem mathematically sound. However, to complete my postulates, I will need to perform an experiment in spacial relativity. To do this, I will need to adopt a sort of metaphysical vigilance. At some point, I expect I will begin translocating again. When I do, I will need to somehow recognize that my consciousness is out of its expected position before Atlas makes its presence known.*

*To this end, and to Lucy’s chagrin (relating to a lack of spousal consultation), I went out and got my first tattoo this morning. Specifically, one of The Smashing Pumpkins’ logos - the heart that has the letters “SP” within it. It covers most of my right forearm and currently stings like some fresh hell.*

*My reasoning is this: if my consciousness is receding into a memory, I think I should recall what was and not what currently is. Therefore, it stands to reason that if I’m mid-translocation, lost within in a memory, I will NOT have this tattoo on my forearm. Hopefully, this will enable me to realize I’m translocating before Atlas finds me.*

*There are a few caveats here: first and foremost, it is possible that I will simply merge how I am now with how I was in my memory, resulting in me visualizing myself with the tattoo on my arm even though it would not have happened yet. If the countless studies on the unreliability of courtroom eyewitness misidentification are any indication, our memories are very fallible and subject to external forces. Second, if in the future I am translocating to a memory that occurs AFTER I got my tattoo, this will obviously not be very helpful. Lastly, even if it does work, I do not know for sure that the evidence I am looking for will even be perceptible to me. If this works, however, and I can appreciate that I am translocating before Atlas arrives, I hope that I can find my tether* \[...\]”

There are no entries dated between July 2005 and the end of 2007. In early 2008, they resumed, but they just start over with describing his initial translocation, with some notable differences. The first appreciable difference is the time stamp. The second and more disturbing difference is how they rapidly fracture and devolve. 

Excerpt from March 2008:

*First translocation.*

*The morning of the first translocation was like any other. I awoke around 9AM. Lucy was already out of bed and probably had been for some time. Peter and Lily had really become a handful over the last few years, and Lucy would need help giving Lily her medications.* 

*Wearily, I stood at the top of our banister, surveying the beautiful disaster that was raising young children -*(immediate, harsh scribbles directly after the world “children”)

*John put NLRP77 in SC484. John, put NLRP77 in SC484. John, put NLRP77 in SC484. John, put NLRP77 in SC484. John, put NLRP77 in SC484. John, put NLRP77 in SC484. John, put NLRP77 in SC484.

*I then began to appreciate the figure before me. He stood at least 10 feet tall. His arms and legs were the same proportions, which gave his upper extremities an unnatural length. which gave his upper extremities an unnatural length.*

*His skin was taught and tented and taught and tented and taught and tented on both of his wrists, tired flesh rising about a foot symmetrically above each hand. Dried blood streaks led up to a center point of the stretched skin, where a fountain of mercurial silver erupted upwards. Following the silver with my eyesFollowing the silver with my eyesFollowing the silver with my eyesFollowing the silver with my eyesFollowing the silver with my eyesFollowing the silver with my eyes*\[...\]”

It continues like that for a while, then cuts off into more scribbles. Of note, the scribbles were inter-cut with sketches of the sigil ([see here for reference](https://imgur.com/a/symbol-above-every-entry-Rb2VbHP)).

There are a lot of entries like this, with the only new dialogue being “John, put NLRP77 in SC484”. None of those numbers meant anything to me the first time I read them. 

When I looked up from my desk, dawn had arrived. With about ten entries left to go, I decided to stop. I had obligations to attend to, involving Lucy, my mother.

I knew I had to ask her about the deathbed logbook, but I dreaded it deeply. Not because I was afraid of her reaction or her emotional state after reading it, or that I was under the impression she would not know anything. Very much the opposite - I was afraid of what she might know. 

I carried my sleep deprived body over to the house I had grown up in. After John’s passing, my mom had planned on taking the time to declutter and downsize their belongings, intending on moving in with Greg and his family. She answered the door with a very on-brand cherry disposition, but her mood shifted to one of concern when she saw my bloodshot eyes. 

I think John fell in love with my mother for the same reasons he was jealous of Greg. Lucy took life in stride, and this made her ineffably resilient to change and strife. Despite this, my father’s dementia had undeniably sapped her of some of her effervescence. You could tell that her cherry disposition rang slightly hollow nowadays. That being said, Lucy’s ability to still conjure and maintain that disposition, even if slightly hollow, is perhaps the utmost attestation to her resilience. 

After assisting her with various tasks that morning, we sat down at the kitchen table for lunch, and I finally manifested the courage to show her some of the logs. I only brought bits and pieces for review, not wanting to disconcert her with the more violent imagery. John never mentioned anything about a 10-foot tall man that visited him in his memories, she remarked with a characteristic chortle. Credit where credit is due, the abruptness and absurdity of that question is objectively funny, and it was comforting to know that Lucy was still able to find humor in these darker days.  

“Honestly honey, I think it’s all just remnants of his mind having a bit of a last hoorah.” She said after completing her review. “I know this has cut you so deeply, especially since you were busy with your residency training the last few years. You have enough on your plate with what happened to Wren. Try not to overburden yourself.”

“You don’t think it’s odd that dad was able to write this, in secret, while on hospice? With us needing to help him with everything like we did?”

Lucy had to take a moment to determine her impression of that statement. Eventually, she replied:

“I think dad spent his last few years in a power struggle with his dementia, whether he appreciated it or not. I know you weren’t around to see this, but some days were great. He was almost himself.” She paused and decided to rephrase the last statement: “Well no, that’s not quite right, he was always himself, to his last moments here. On his good days, though, he had *the ability* to act like himself. This would include writing, as you well know.”

“You never saw him writing anything while visiting him at hospice?” I replied sharply, trying to swallow a bout of rising sorrow that was building in my throat as I did. I needed to stay on task.

Lucy put her hand over mine.

“No, Pete, nothing. But that doesn’t mean he couldn’t or that he didn’t. Also, you know how overworked the aides are in the memory unit - just because they didn’t see or don’t remember seeing him write, doesn’t mean it did not happen”.

We were silent for a while after that, cooling down from the emotionally taxing exchange. 

“It reminds me a lot of the way he would write his research, actually. I wish we could ask Majorie,” she remarked solemnly.

This is the turning point. 

“Wait, that’s a great idea. Why can’t we ask her?”

Majorie, as a reminder, was dad’s co-researcher at CellCept. They had met in graduate school and were fast friends despite the large, fifteen-year age gap. As you might imagine, there were not a lot of options for academic kinship when my dad was earning his PhD - cellular topography is a niche avenue of investigation now, to my understanding, let alone back in the 80s (see post 1 for a more complete description of the job). Lucy and Majorie had also gotten along very well, but in a flash of realization, I now appreciated that I had not seen them together since I graduated middle school. 

When Lucy saw my confused expression, she put her hand to her mouth, coming to terms with the fact that she had let something slip.

“Well, shoot. We didn’t want to tell you when you were a kid, love. It was right after dad’s crash - you were still very shaken-up about death and dying.”

It took me a moment to register what she was implying.

“Majorie…is dead?”

From here, Lucy filled in a few critical gaps in the story. After John’s crash, Marjorie took over as the sole researcher on the project they had both recently been promoted to. CellCept was a pharmaceutical company interested in developing medications targeted at improving human longevity at the cellular level. They had both been working there since grad school (so at least a decade) without a sizable increase in their pay before this new project.

The goal was this: another branch of the company had found a line of uniquely immortal stem cells, and it became John and Marjorie’s job to determine on a cellular level why that was the case (Lucy thinks these cells were discovered incidentally at an autopsy of someone who had donated their body to science, but that is all she can remember of their origin). My mom thinks that the promotion occurred in early 2004, predating the first entry in John’s logbook by a few months.

After the crash incapacitated John, Marjorie’s workload doubled as she mapped the interior of that infinitely dividing cell line without a partner. In the overwhelming chaos of the crash, and in caring for John’s extensive health needs after he was released from the hospital, Lucy had lost touch with Majorie. She explained to me that her assumption was that Marjorie was consumed with work, now that she was the only one on the project, and that’s why she saw little of her in those months after the accident.

There was a point in time while my dad recovered that he considered not returning to CellCept - per Lucy, “he had felt more alive in that recovery time then he did since he accepted the job”. Maybe he would become a stay-at-home dad, John thought. Lily, my sister, still had health issues after her childhood cancer that would always benefit from increased supervision. 

One night in May 2004, however, John received an unexpected call from Marjorie’s wife. Over the previous few months, she had developed rapid onset neurologic symptoms and was unlikely to live for more than another week. Doctors had diagnosed her with “sporadic CJD,” also known as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

CJD is a wildly progressive and incredibly rare entity, estimated to affect approximately one American in a million per year. Essentially, the pathophysiology involves “prions” - self-propagating proteins that proliferate in brain matter, causing injury and subsequent degradation of neurons. This disease remains poorly understood because it’s the only disease I know of where proteins alone act as an infection.

Proteins are the molecules that allow all cells to function - fundamental building blocks to human cells, bacterial cells, viral cells, so on and so on. Canonically, though, they are not really considered to be “alive” - simply parts that create a larger whole. In the same way that if you cut off your hand and you were somehow able to keep the tissue from decaying, you probably wouldn’t consider that phantom appendage to be “alive” in the same way you are.

And yet, the proteins implicated in CJD are able to “infect” a human host if infested tissues are consumed - an ability thought to be reserved for living things (there are cases in Papua New Guinea of aboriginal tribespeople developing a subset of this disease due to ritualistic cannibalism of human brain tissue).

There is no treatment, and diagnosis of the disease is usually presumed in patients who have all the cardinal findings of CJD as well as MRI and lab findings that are in support of the diagnosis. However, it is important to note that the only way to definitively make this diagnosis is through a brain biopsy, which is seldom performed due to the risk of spreading the infectious, deadly protein. Most patients die within one year of symptom onset.

The punchline of all of this is that the symptoms of CJD are, broadly speaking, the same symptoms as Alzheimer’s Dementia, John’s diagnosis - they just occur and progress much quicker. When I asked Lucy if she had any seizures, she said Marjorie did. I would later exhaustively research CJD, only to find that seizures are incredibly uncommon in CJD, a disease that is already a one in a million diagnosis (The National Institutes of Health quotes that less than 3% of cases of CJD are accompanied by seizures).

She passed two days after my dad got that phone call. No brain biopsy was ever performed on Marjorie. Because CellCept wanted the project to continue, they threatened John’s potential severance package and reputation in the field if he did not come back to work. Under that coercion, he returned to CellCept in September 2005. 

These revelations staggered me. I could tell, with an unexplainable extrasensory insight, that all of this was relevant, I just didn’t initially know *why* it was relevant. It appeared that John experienced all the same symptoms that Marjorie did, she just succumbed to her disease much quicker than him. Yet, something was amiss here. John certainly did not develop CJD - he would have never lasted so long with that diagnosis. If you look at it from the opposing perspective, Majorie developed all the same symptoms that John did, including seizures, which do not fit with the diagnosis of CJD, or are at least an exceptionally rare manifestation of an already exceptionally rare disease. 

Knowing that digesting this new information would take time, I put it on the backburner and resumed helping Lucy pack. In doing so, I ended up being tasked with taking apart the bedframe in John’s old room. I say John’s room, because they had been sleeping in different bedrooms for at least a decade before his death. This was not the sign of a dissolving marriage, rather, John was an incredibly light sleeper and Lucy was diagnosed with sleep apnea in 2001, requiring her to start wearing a CPAP machine overnight. If you’re not familiar with how CPAP machines looked in the early 2000s, it is worth a google - they were loud, heavy machines in their infancy. John would have better luck sleeping in the same room as a practicing mariachi band.

As if the last twenty-four hours had not already been dizzying enough, in the process of dismantling the wooden bedframe I discovered something hidden in the exact same part of the bed that I had found his logbook. In his hospice room, I found the logs under the mattress in the top left-hand corner. In his old bedroom, I found a singular key taped to the underside of the frame in the same, top left-hand corner. Engraved on the key were the numbers “484”.

As much as I want to finish this, I need to rest.

To introduce what is coming in the next post (which may be the penultimate or ultimate post, depending on my energy levels in the coming few days), the SC484 in the phrase “John, put NLRP77 in SC484” referred to a storage container numbered 484 at a warehouse half an hour from my childhood home. When questioned, Lucy did not know of its existence. No one did. 

Days later, I would develop the prerequisite bravery to find and unlock that abhorrent vault. Inside an eight hundred square foot container laid thousands of moth-eaten marble notebooks, stacked in unorganized, schizophrenic piles, as well as the final grim piece to understanding [the sigil](https://imgur.com/a/symbol-above-every-entry-Rb2VbHP). John was correct when he said he knew the sigil wasn’t depicting an eye. Or, more accurately, it wasn’t *only* the depiction of an eye. 

Something more devastating was concealed within it.
