I'm writing this as a way to reflect on the horrific tragedies I witnessed as a freshman in college. I'm trying to move on from the things I've seen, but I can't unless I speak my mind on it. 

It was right around move-in day when the incidents first started.  For some reason, the air conditioner would randomly turn off during the day, and no matter what we tried, we couldn't get it to start back up. I go to a school in Northeast Alabama. The temperatures here get extreme and air conditioning is a borderline necessity. Eventually, the air conditioner would turn itself back on, but this was normally well into the night. My roomate and I didn't really think much of it. We just called the repairmen and got it repaired. 

That afternoon, we got some of the worst news we've ever heard. A good friend of mine on our floor passed away. They ruled his death as a suicide. When I went to comfort his family, I noticed there was a strange collection of papers on the floor. It looked like someone dropped a notebook and just didn't bother to pick them up. That night, I noticed more paper. This time, it was on the outside of his room. I just figured that those were kicked up by his family and I threw them away. They were blank so I figured they were trash. 

The temperatures were still scortching. We couldn't escape the heat if we tried. We just resorted to using ice from the freezer to cool ourselves down. We tried a work order again, but they just scolded us both for "wasting his time since the unit was working just fine". That night, the whole building slept cool. Except for one of us. 

We got the news of his passing the next morning. His was stranger than the last. The newer death was found completely naked in a nearby stream unresponsive. To us, this seemed like homicide, but yet again, it was deemed intentional suicide. Yet again, there were a collection of blank pages in front of his door. It was around this time that some idiot decided to tear the universities flag and replace it with a disturbing banner with 2 eyes in the center and some text in a language we didn't understand. The flag was displayed for about an hour before being promptly taken down. front of our building. The person who did it was never caught, but my roomate and I took it very seriously. 

The next week, the same thing happened. Tried to get the AC fixed and got screamed at because "it worked fine". This time, we got barred from using our work order service again. Yet again, we got forced to endure the summer heat of the South without any sort of remedy. As I went to bed that night, I was awoken to the sound of 2 people fighting brutally.

 I got up to go check up on the noise and as I arrived, one of them pins the other and stabs him directly through his eye. I watch in horror as the man fires a round into the attacker and himself. Yet again, there were these fucking pages in front of his room and the air conditioner was working.

 However, there was this weird, gas smell emindating from the room. It smelled like rotton eggs and it made me feel like I was motion sick. After the police finished investigating, they deemed our building unsafe and gave us all 90 days to find a new place to live. 

Those 90 days were chaotic. People were leaving whenever they could, but we couldn't. We couldn't find anywhere else to go. We just had to tough it out and pray nothing happened to us.   A small chance, but hopefully we get to see the other side. 

The 90 days went pretty uneventful. We eventually found a place to live. On the day before we were supposed to move, we're sleeping comfortably, as this will be the last time sleeping in this terrible shit hole. I wake up, sweating from the heat. The time is 12:52 AM. I try to go back to sleep, but can't. I eventually go outside and as I'm leaving my room, the air conditioner flips right on. I look down, the entire floor is covered in blank paper.  I sprint out of the building like my life depended on it. That gas smell was pouring out of every ceviche that building had. The fire alarm blares as I make it through the emergency exits. I make it around 2 blocks when the entire building erupts in flames.

Unfortunately, nobody made it out of the building, except me. I mourn the loss of my roommate with his family and I'm planning on visiting his family since the anniversary is coming up. He was my best friend and someone who I looked up to. I still miss him every day. The other day, I stepped on another piece of blank paper. My heart dropped to my knees when I picked it up, and turned it over. To my dismay, this paper wasn't blank. In big, bold letters, the text "KEEP ON RUNNING" was written in sloppy handwriting. It doesn't appear that this incident is over. Rest in peace to those who passed in this horrible tragedy. Your thoughts and prayers are with us all.
