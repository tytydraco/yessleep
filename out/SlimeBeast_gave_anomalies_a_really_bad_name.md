Most entertainment centers have anomalies; you don’t have to be afraid of them  
  
So, before I start this I want to clear up what I mean by “entertainment centers”; by now most of you should know at least a little bit about what Disney likes to call “corruptus”. I hate that term for several reasons, but mainly because it’s terrifying. Most of these anomalies are harmless, despite what SlimeBeast or whatever his name was said in his posts. But back to what “entertainment centers” are. Basically, they’re any themed establishment intended for purposes of amusement. Yes, this includes Universal, Disney, Six Flags, all those places. Yes, Six Flags is included, despite their seeming lack of thematic elements and deeply-rooted lore. In this post I’ll be talking about these anomalies in two different locations, my family’s own Family Entertainment Center in Texas and my experience working at Six Flags America in Maryland back in 2017.

  
So, my dad’s FEC. After Mom died he wanted something to….I don’t know, actually. Make him feel like a kid again? Obviously he couldn’t just walk into a job being an imaginer at Disney, so he decided to use his entire savings to buy out a local Chuck E. Cheese branch. I have no idea how he did it since at the time CEC was doing really well, at the height of the themed entertainment craze of the mid to late 90s. And that’s the beginning of a story about how my dad started his own FEC, ran it into the ground twice, and introduced me into the world of the paranormal.

  
To compete with Chuck E. Cheese and the myriad of other toddler havens of the era,  my dad needed animatronics. However, because my dad didn’t have Nolan Bushnell levels of money (or common sense) he had to go through some sketchy business run out of a warehouse down in San Antonio. I have no idea how animatronics are usually made, but I’m pretty sure they aren’t supposed to smell like liquid ass mixed with dead body, which is what these things smelled like, constantly. My dad tried everything he could think of, but to this day I’m sure those things stink like Satan’s unwashed butthole. I can’t be sure of that because they vanished one day a few years back, and nobody knows where they went. My dad opened a “weird museum” that same year and I thought he might have moved them over from the FEC to his latest scheme to indulge in his own weird fantasies but he has no idea where they went. It’s a shame, because despite his smell and the fact that he tried to eat me, I liked Benny. He was cool.

  
So, those anomalies. They aren’t some “when you wish upon a star” crap like Slime said in his last post, they just….exist. Like, everywhere. Imagine if you were a formless entity that needed a body to interact with the world around you, but you weren’t born with the gift of a tangible body and you had to use your own energy to create one. It’s a hell of a lot easier to “create” something you can see around you, like Mickey Mouse or Chuck E.., than it is to pull one out of your ass, so that’s why they take those forms we’re all so familiar with. Only, sometimes they get stuff wrong. An eye goes in the wrong place, or the colors are off, or they lose their sanity over the years until there’s nothing left but anger and rage….but that’s rare. Like, really rare. And that’s how you end up with our old friend “photo-negative Mickey” and the Poop Rat.

  
I guess this is a decent introduction, maybe. All I’m trying to do is get rid of this fear everyone has of the “anomalies”, because honestly they don’t deserve all the hate they get. But I’m falling asleep writing this, so I’ll leave it here for now. I’ll be back later with stories about the weirdest arcade game I’ve eve played and invisible kids…..oh, and the Poop Rat. I can’t forget that….thing, and believe me, I’ve tried. So, until I write again, stay safe, and try not to get stuck in a temporal time slip inside of a bathroom if you’re anywhere near a crappy old entertainment center in Arlington, Texas. Just don’t.
