Paige and I had been dating for almost a year when I caught her sneaking my bloody Kleenex out of the bathroom trash.

“What are you doing?” I asked as her eyes went wide, realizing she’d been spotted.

“Just taking out the trash,” she said, a little too fast.

I might have let it go, but now that I was on the lookout I noticed other strange behavior. A week later, I let her cut my hair and found the trimmings in a large plastic bag hidden way up in the closet.

And another time, when she didn’t think I was looking, I saw her take a trimmed piece of my toenail and pop it into her mouth like a Skittle.

I started thinking about our whole history together. The way she always gushed about the way I smelled after sex. Or how she loved to playfully bite my lip.

Then one day, I came home from work early and found one of my used bandaids in a cup of boiling water. 

“What the fuck?” I shouted. “Is that my blood?”

“It’s not what you think,” she said. She’d been chopping onions, and she walked toward me, knife in hand. “I would never hurt you. I just… have this thing. This thing where I want to eat people. I know it’s something we have to work through, but it’s just the way I am.”

I felt like I wanted to throw up. I couldn’t take my eyes off the knife in her hand. I took a step back, forgetting about the staircase to the basement. Then I felt myself falling and everything went black.

I woke in the hospital. It could have been a night later or a week. All I knew was that I could barely move my arms and everything felt hazy.

“You’re up,” said a familiar voice, and I looked across the room to see a blurry figure approaching. “Good. There’s been something I need to do.”

Then she pulled a razor from her pocket and started walking toward me.

“I’m so sorry you had to find out this way,” she said. “I’m so ashamed. I guess I was worried that if you ever found out, you’d stop loving me.”

I tried to speak, but all that came out was a raspy hissing sound, like the last belch of a deflating balloon. 

“You still love me, right?” she asked. “Just nod if you still love me.”

My heart rate monitor was beeping like crazy as the razor in her hand caught the blinking lights of the equipment. I tried to move my arm, but it was like I was wearing a lead suit. I probably would have pissed myself, but I had a catheter in.

I nodded, trying to gurgle out a “yessss.”

She headed to the sink, letting steaming water run into a metal bowl. She wetted a warm washcloth and laid it on my face, letting the heat loosen my skin. Then she removed a small bottle of shaving cream from her purse and rubbed it over my cheeks.

“You never could pull off a beard,” she said, and I realized I must have been stuck in that hospital for even longer than I realized.

Slowly, carefully, Paige began to shave me. With each swipe of the razor, I wondered if she’d slash me open. I imagined her pressing her lips to my bleeding wound, drinking her fill, her eyes rolling back in pleasure. I imagined her slicing off my ears and fingers, crunching them like crudites.

“Hold still,” she said, cutting downward, and I closed my eyes, ready for the final cut.

But it never came. 

After a few minutes, I was totally clean shaven.

“You’d better marry that one,” said Dr. Kingston the next day when he arrived a few hours later. He gestured at Paige, who was sleeping peacefully in a chair near the foot of my bed. “Dropped everything to be here with you all month. Even quit her job on the spot when they denied her PTO. Doubt my wife would do that for me.”

“Am I going to be okay?” I asked.

“In a while… yeah,” he said. “Don’t worry. I’m sure she’ll take care of you.”

The day we got home, I was feeling tired, so I headed straight to bed. I walked into the bedroom to find clean sheets and a massive “Welcome Home” banner. Bags of all my favorite snacks we laid out on a side table.

“Thanks,” I said, not quite knowing what to say. “That’s really nice.”

“I found the ring,” she said after a few seconds. “The one in your dresser drawer. I wasn’t snooping or anything. I was just trying to get you clothes.”

“Paige–”

“And I want you to know, I really would be the best wife. I’d love you hard every day. And yeah, maybe every once in a while I’d eat something I shouldn’t, but maybe that’s not so bad, you know? And I hope… I hope we get old and die on the same day, the same second. But the one thing you should know before we go a second further, is that if you *do* die first, I would eat you. I wouldn’t waste a scrap. I’d boil your skin and bones, I’d fry up your organs. I’d savor the taste of your ribs and muscles. And I need you to know that. To be okay with that. I need you to know.”

I could tell she was close to bursting into tears. Slowly, I crossed the room and wrapped my arms around her.

“Okay,” I said quietly.

“Okay?”
