*Snow falling outside my window, and I confess.*

I am, perhaps, what one might call a typical student of abnormal psychology: driven by a boundless curiosity and an unyielding desire to explore the darker recesses of the human mind. My days are spent in the relative comfort of academic routine—endless lectures, coursework, and hours hunched over case studies, chasing the elusive understanding of the disorders that plague the human psyche. My professors might call me "the most dedicated in my cohort," but they would never use such words aloud. The admiration is implicit, of course, in the way they nod when I answer questions with a bit more precision than most, offering the occasional 'well done' that feels earned. It’s here, within the predictable structure of my graduate studies, that I find solace—methodical, logical, and clear.

*Snowing peacefully towards my gaze - up into the gray cloud, silent, becoming the bed of ice.*

I’ve always felt at home in the realm of scientific inquiry, where ambiguity is dissected under the sharp light of reason. The human mind, with its intricate web of disorders, defense mechanisms, and cognitive peculiarities, has long been an object of both my study and fascination. My academic life, while grueling at times, never felt foreign. It was my haven. It is only when I think too long on it that the unsettling realization hits me: the very mind I so eagerly seek to understand has been responsible for horrors far beyond the reaches of rational thought.

*Always snowing now, always winter.*

There are moments when I find myself drawn to those disturbing corners of my textbooks—the chapters on culture-bound syndromes. Wendigo psychosis, for instance, is one such condition that always provokes my interest, yet stirs something dark within me. Descriptions vary, but one cannot ignore the consistent thread of human cannibalism, spiritual possession, and an insatiable hunger that transcends mere survival instincts. To me, Wendigo psychosis isn't just another case of cultural superstition; it represents an attempt, albeit an unscientific one, to understand something beyond the capacity of conventional psychology. I sometimes wonder if we, as modern academics, do a disservice to the mysteries of the mind by dismissing such phenomena.

*It makes me laugh, to realize as I child I understood that there are two medicines, one for the mind and one for the spirit. Who was I, when I forgot that? I know who I am now, as I remember the truth.*

My life, as it were, took an unexpected turn when I was contacted by a rather peculiar mental health facility. Bison Lake Recovery Institute, they called it, tucked far away from any major city, isolated amidst the desolate stretches of northern Canada. The institution was shrouded in mystery, spoken of in hushed tones by my professors, its methods rumored to be, at best, unconventional—and at worst, a mockery of clinical science. Yet, something about it intrigued me, compelling me to pursue a possible internship, albeit reluctantly.

*Leaving the familiar, the forests passing me while I sit, the journey is one into the past, and somehow, the past is more familiar.*

Upon arriving at the facility, the first thing I noticed was the overwhelming silence—unnerving in its depth. There were no bustling corridors, no frantic footsteps of nurses or orderlies. Instead, the staff seemed as though they had been trained to move through the halls without making a sound, as if afraid to disturb the delicate calm of the patients' minds. The air was thick with the scent of antiseptic and something more—a subtle but unmistakable fear, though not one easily named. A sense of wrongness permeated every corner of the building, as though the very architecture itself was trying to contain something dark, something untamed.

As I settled into my new role—observing, taking notes, assisting in basic treatments—I began hearing whispers. The patients spoke in hushed, fearful tones, wary of one another. In particular, one patient, a man named Sani, whose violent outbursts had earned him a reputation even among the hardened staff, was a subject of great curiosity. He was rumored to be suffering from a condition described as Wendigo psychosis—a diagnosis that had intrigued me for years. I overheard fragments of conversations in the hallways: "He's not like the others," one orderly had said. "It's the hunger... you can see it in his eyes." The rumors suggested that Sani’s actions mirrored the very behaviors associated with the Wendigo myth—a creature of insatiable hunger, said to be driven mad by the need to consume human flesh.

As I delved deeper into my research and began speaking with the staff about Sani, I couldn’t shake a rising unease. I had always prided myself on my ability to separate my academic detachment from my emotional responses, yet something about this case—about him—was different. It reminded me of the stories I had heard growing up, tales of the Wendigo, passed down through generations in my family, whispered by elders as warnings. It seemed foolish now, to think of those stories as anything more than folklore. But the feeling, the palpable fear in the eyes of the staff when they spoke of Sani, had an uncanny way of reopening old wounds—wounds from my childhood, when I had witnessed the inexplicable behavior of a distant relative.

My uncle, a man of stoic character and strength, had shown strange behavior after a long, bitter winter. He became reclusive, his appetite insatiable, devouring anything in sight, even the bitterest scraps. I remember the way he looked at me once, his eyes darkened by something I couldn’t name, as though he saw me not as his niece, but as... food. There had been no rational explanation for his actions. He was eventually found near the woods, emaciated and delirious, muttering incoherently about a creature lurking just beyond the reach of the trees. He died soon after. I was just a child, and though I had always assumed it was simply madness brought on by isolation, I couldn’t help but recall that unsettling look in his eyes. Could it have been Wendigo psychosis?

*In terror, I climbed out that open window, and took off running across the snow with nothing on my feet.*

As I now found myself ensnared in the same web of fear surrounding Sani, I could no longer ignore the nagging question: Was it possible that this condition, this Wendigo psychosis, was more than just a cultural anomaly? What if it was something deeper, something that defied rational explanation, something that no amount of clinical research could cure?

The more I learned about Sani and his case, the more I found myself caught between two forces: the relentless pull of academic curiosity, and a fear, buried deep within me, that this would be the case that tested the very limits of what I believed about the human mind.

The Wendigo is not a creature easily contained by the pages of a textbook or confined to the neat, sterile diagrams of my lectures. No, it is far older, a part of the fabric of the land and the cultures of the indigenous peoples of North America, especially among the Algonquian-speaking tribes. I first encountered the Wendigo in my studies of culture-bound syndromes. The myths tell of a tall, gaunt figure—so emaciated that its skin clings to its bones like the tattered remnants of a forgotten soul. Its hunger, insatiable and all-consuming, leads it to devour not only human flesh but the very essence of its prey, stealing their spirit and leaving nothing but a hollow shell behind.

What fascinates me—and terrifies me—is not merely the creature's grotesque physicality but the psychological terror it embodies. The Wendigo is said to possess those who succumb to the primal urges of cannibalism during harsh winters, turning them into ravenous beasts incapable of control. The afflicted, in their madness, lose their humanity, driven by an unquenchable thirst for human flesh. They are no longer themselves—transformed into something inhuman, as if the very act of consumption has stripped them of their soul. I have read about the symptoms of Wendigo psychosis—the paranoia, the obsession with hunger, the eventual descent into madness and violence—but something in me cannot help but wonder if there’s more to it, something hidden beneath the layers of folklore and superstition.

*What you remember, who you think you are, these are mere choices for the ancient demon, and yet you become the claws it uses to make gestures.*

As I spent more time in the Bison Lake Recovery Institute, I began to piece together the fragments of information scattered through hushed conversations and nervous glances exchanged by staff. They spoke of Sani with an unease that was palpable, though their words were never direct. When I asked one of the nurses, a woman named Linda, about Sani's condition, she hesitated for a long moment before answering.

"He's... different," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "He’s not like the others. He’s... hungry in a way that’s hard to describe. Not just for food, but for something more. There’s something dark about him."

Her words struck me in a way I couldn’t explain. I pushed her further, asking if she thought it was a case of Wendigo psychosis. She visibly recoiled at the term, as though even speaking it aloud might summon something unseen.

"Sometimes," she murmured, "we hear him at night. Scratching, like... like he's trying to dig his way out of the walls. And then there are the sounds. Laughter. But it’s not human laughter. It’s... unsettling."

Later, another staff member—an orderly who had worked at the facility for over a decade—pulled me aside, looking over his shoulder as though ensuring no one overheard.

“You should leave that one alone,” he said, his voice low and gravelly. “There are things in these woods you can’t understand. Sani... he’s not the first. We’ve had others like him, you know. People who disappear, who are found later... changed. But no one wants to talk about that.”

The more I pressed for details, the more fragmented the accounts became. One patient, a woman in her late fifties who had been at the hospital for many years, seemed to know more than she let on. Her name was Lana, and she had been one of the few to speak openly about the creatures she had encountered in her youth. During one of our sessions, she started to speak in broken, disjointed sentences.

“I saw it once,” she said, her eyes wide with something akin to terror. “In the woods, when I was a girl. A tall thing, with eyes like frozen lakes. It didn’t walk—it moved like it was floating above the ground. And it called to me. Not with words... but in my head. You think it’s just a story. But it’s real. The Wendigo is real.”

She then went silent for the remainder of the session, her eyes darting nervously, as though expecting the creature to appear at any moment. I tried to press her for more details, but she simply clammed up, her lips trembling.

*I looked at the blood on my hands, and on the crumbled snow I had tried to use to clean them.*

As I continued my research into Sani’s case, I began to notice strange occurrences around the hospital. Lights flickered, casting long, unnatural shadows in the hallways. There were whispers—soft, unintelligible murmurs that seemed to emanate from nowhere in particular.

What unsettles me most, more than the stories or the whispers, is the feeling that something is watching. Not just in a psychological sense, as though the building itself might be haunted, but something tangible, something aware of my every movement. The Wendigo, if it exists, is not bound by the limitations of the human mind. It is elusive, a shadow that flickers in the corner of your vision, but never quite in full view. And this is what makes it so terrifying—its presence is not marked by loud screams or savage growls. It is silent. Invisible. It leaves only the faintest trace of its existence—a broken twig, the fleeting scent of something rotting in the air, a distant, unplaceable sound in the night.

*I hear something following me in the snow, as I walk barefoot. I turn and look, and it is my own shadow, in the shape of a hung deer carcass, with no meat left on it, and the antlers reach the top of the fresh snow as the rope creaks, and the tips of the horns draw those sacred circles.*

As I walk through the hallways of the Bison Lake Recovery Institute, I can’t shake the feeling that something is following me. Watching me. It’s not just Sani who is possessed by this hunger, but the very institution itself—the walls, the rooms, the ground beneath our feet—are saturated with it. The deeper I go into my research, the closer I come to a terrifying realization: the Wendigo is not just a legend. It is a force, a presence, that is very much alive, waiting to consume those who venture too far into its domain.

The question is no longer whether the Wendigo exists. It’s whether it will let me leave before it consumes me, too.

The more I dug into the accounts and research surrounding Wendigo psychosis, the clearer it became: the creature, the affliction, was not just a psychological condition, but a looming presence that could not be reasoned with. Its hunger was a primal force, an insatiable abyss that consumed everything in its path, not only devouring flesh but also the soul of its victims. I could sense this truth creeping into the edges of my rationality, as if the walls of the Bison Lake Recovery Institute were closing in around me. There was no escape from the shadows of the Wendigo.

What frightened me the most, as I gathered information, was how the Wendigo did not simply feed—it hunted. And it hunted with purpose, in ways that transcended the natural world. I thought back to the readings I’d conducted, specifically John R. Colombo’s Canadian Folklore, where he references countless historical accounts of the Wendigo’s predatory behavior. "The Wendigo’s influence is always present where hunger is born of desperation," he wrote, a line that chilled me when I considered its relevance to what was happening here. The Wendigo is not drawn to mere hunger—it is summoned by the depths of isolation, the darkness that overtakes those left without help, without humanity.

*The smell of sage draws my spirit up, and lets it slowly settle into a peaceful way of sitting. The smoke drifts in circles, and in a circle the pipe is passed, using tobacco in a sacred way.*

As I spoke with more patients, one pattern became unmistakable: the Wendigo appeared when its victims were isolated, vulnerable—often pushed to the brink of starvation. It was no coincidence that the patients suffering from Wendigo psychosis had been cut off from their communities, exiled to this bleak facility. It thrives on desperation, on a deep, gnawing hunger that nothing else can satisfy.

The terror of this discovery was unlike any other fear I had experienced. As I absorbed this knowledge, I began to see the world through a new lens. Every flickering light, every shadow cast by the trees outside, seemed to take on an otherworldly quality. The walls of the hospital were no longer mere bricks and mortar; they felt like barriers, thinly veiling something much darker, something far more ancient than I had ever anticipated. I had walked into this place thinking I was investigating a mental condition—something measurable, scientific. But the more I uncovered, the more I realized: I was dealing with something that didn’t adhere to any logic or understanding I had.

Lana, the elderly patient, was the first to break the veil of silence surrounding the Wendigo’s presence. I had asked her to describe any patterns she’d noticed in the creature’s behavior, and she responded with quiet urgency.

“It's drawn to weakness, child. Fear makes it stronger,” she said. Her voice was trembling, her hands twisted tightly in her lap. “You think it’s just hunger, but it’s more than that. It’s hunting. It knows when you're close to breaking. It knows when you’re alone.”

I wasn’t sure if she meant Sani or the Wendigo, or perhaps both. But I could see the fear in her eyes—fear not just of the creature, but of the fact that it was stalking all of us. We were all connected to it now. It could be anyone, anywhere.

Then there was the orderlies' stories. One of them, a younger man named Ryan, confessed during a late-night shift that he’d heard strange noises near the woods behind the hospital. He said that on one occasion, he had gone out to investigate, only to see the silhouette of something tall—too tall for any human figure—drifting just beyond the tree line. He thought it was one of the patients, or a prank, until the figure turned its head towards him. And the eyes… they were hollow. Black holes, empty voids, like the creature had no soul left at all. It wasn’t human, and it was aware of him.

“I swear, something’s out there,” Ryan said, his voice raw, but firm. “You don’t get it. We’re being watched. And we’re not alone.”

*I looked down at his body, his red ribs darkened by the bitter cold that howled with biting ferocity. I looked up, and thought I saw the yellow eyes of wolves all around, but I realized I was only seeing my own reflection in the darkness.*

I couldn’t stop myself from continuing to investigate, even as the terror grew stronger. The more I learned about the Wendigo, the more I understood that its presence followed certain patterns—patterns that might give us a chance to defend ourselves if we could only recognize them in time. But each realization I had brought with it a deeper, darker realization: there was no sure way to escape it.

In her notes, Dr. Anne Gavigan, in Hunger, Horses, and Government Men, discusses the connection between the Wendigo and starvation, particularly in the northern regions of Canada where food is scarce, and winters are brutal. The Wendigo is tied to deprivation—not just of food, but of hope. It feeds on the isolation of its victims, drawing them into its grasp when they are at their weakest, when they can no longer trust their own minds.

I saw that same fear reflected in the behavior of patients here. Those who had been isolated the longest—those who had no contact with family or the outside world—were the ones who spoke of strange noises at night, of seeing shadowy figures outside their windows. Their symptoms mirrored the descriptions in the folklore: paranoia, a growing obsession with hunger, and a loss of self-control. But it wasn’t just the patients. Staff members who worked too closely with these cases also began to show signs of something… off. Linda had mentioned the scratching sounds in the walls, but I began to hear them, too. At night, they were faint but persistent, as though something was trying to claw its way into the building.

As the days passed, I started to see signs that the Wendigo was closing in on me, too. I found myself thinking about hunger constantly—not just for food, but for something else. A gnawing feeling at the back of my mind that grew worse as I spent more time researching. The Wendigo does not just feed on the body, but on the mind. The more I focused on it, the more it seemed to invade my thoughts, creeping in like a dark fog. The line between scientific curiosity and fear began to blur, until I wasn’t sure if I was researching Wendigo psychosis or slowly becoming consumed by it myself.

At night, I heard the laughter too. It was low, echoing through the halls. I told myself it was only the wind. It had to be. But deep down, I knew better. The Wendigo was here. And it was coming for all of us.

*Sometimes the laughter was my own. Sometimes I ask who I was, at that facility.*

I couldn't stop myself. The more I read, the more I had to know. The Wendigo had become a fixation, an all-consuming obsession that blurred the lines between academic pursuit and an existential dread I could no longer escape. I had always prided myself on rationality, on my ability to dissect human behavior through the lens of abnormal psychology. But this—this was something beyond even my most vivid nightmares. It was as though I were standing on the precipice of something ancient and malevolent, a force so primal that it defied reason.

I started reading everything I could find on Wendigo psychosis, its historical records, and folklore. "Wendigo psychosis," as defined by researchers such as Shelley Gavigan, was a mental illness linked to intense, overwhelming feelings of hunger that led its victims to engage in cannibalism. But it was more than just an eating disorder; it was a transformation, an evolution of the human mind into something monstrous. Those afflicted would experience delusions of starvation and consume human flesh, believing it was the only means to stave off death. But the horror didn’t end there—the psychosis was known to twist the individual’s mind, filling them with a maddening desire to become the Wendigo itself.

I began to draw connections between the ancient legends and modern psychological theories, each piece of information fueling my determination to understand this terrifying condition. As I referenced John R. Colombo’s Canadian Folklore again, I found myself haunted by one line in particular: "The Wendigo does not simply consume the body; it feeds on the soul, dragging its victims into a shadowed world where their very existence is questioned."

I wondered if this was what was happening here—if the patients in this hospital weren’t just physically ill, but psychically consumed by the Wendigo’s presence. Was there a deeper connection between the affliction and the legends that had been passed down through generations? Could the psychosis be a modern manifestation of something much older? I felt as though I were unraveling a mystery that had no clear answer—only more questions.

But I couldn’t stop. I had to know. There was only one way to understand this madness fully, to explore the truth behind the terrifying tales of the Wendigo: I had to speak to the cannibal patient.

Sani—the patient who had been described in hushed tones by staff and other patients alike. The one who had murdered and eaten his family in a fit of insanity. The one who had reportedly been found covered in blood, muttering to himself about “the hunger” that gnawed at him from the inside. His case had been the catalyst for my research—his existence the focal point of my academic pursuit. And now, he was my only opportunity to uncover the truth.

I began preparing myself. Dr. Anne Gavigan’s Hunger, Horses, and Government Men had made it clear that these types of individuals were not to be underestimated. The transformation into the Wendigo wasn’t just psychological—it was physical. It altered the very essence of a person. The human mind, starved and tortured, would shatter under the weight of its own primal urges, distorting reality. If I were to sit across from someone like that, I would have to steel myself against more than just his words.

The hospital staff cautioned me against the interview. I had overheard whispers among the orderlies about Sani’s behavior—how he had become more violent recently, even aggressive at times. But I was too far gone. I couldn’t back away now. I had to learn, to understand, even if it meant putting myself at risk.

The night before the interview, the paranoia settled in. I couldn’t sleep. Every shadow in my room seemed to move, every creak of the building sending my heart into overdrive. I kept seeing things at the corner of my vision—shapes that seemed to vanish the moment I turned to face them. I blamed it on the stress. But deep down, I knew better.

I thought back to the words of the orderlies. Linda had told me, "The longer you stay here, the harder it is to tell what's real anymore. The isolation gets to you."

It was as though she had seen through me, pinpointing the very fear I had been trying to ignore. I had spent days researching, hours poring over pages of psychological case studies and folklore, but I hadn’t realized how much the isolation was eating away at me. It was only now, in the dead of night, that I understood. The Wendigo didn’t need to physically hunt you—it could drive you into madness long before it sank its teeth into your flesh.

I thought back to Dr. Richard T. Jabbar’s Mental Disorders in Specific Cultures, where he had discussed the cultural influence of isolation and starvation on the human psyche. There was a theory he’d referenced that had stuck with me: "Psychological stressors, when coupled with environmental deprivation, can lead to conditions where the individual loses their grip on reality. What follows is a breakdown of the boundary between the self and the other—a complete surrender to the mind's most primal fears."

The more I read, the more I wondered if the Wendigo wasn’t just a cultural manifestation of this. Could it be that the isolation in this facility was warping my mind, twisting my perception of what was happening around me? Was the hunger I felt for knowledge starting to take on a new, darker meaning?

I felt it then—the creeping, gnawing sensation at the back of my mind, like something was waiting to devour me.

I wasn’t sure what was real anymore.

*If I sing to you, will you know the truth?*

I couldn’t focus. Every time I tried to sit down and make sense of the information I’d gathered, the shadows seemed to creep closer. There was something suffocating about this place—something oppressive, a heaviness that weighed on my chest, making it harder to think clearly. It wasn’t just the isolation, though that certainly didn’t help. It was as if the walls themselves were alive, pulsating with a dark energy that lured me deeper into the abyss of my own thoughts.

I had always prided myself on being grounded in rationality, on using logic and facts to dissect human behavior. But the further I delved into the history of Wendigo psychosis, the more I began to doubt myself. Was this condition real, or was it simply a construct of folklore—a way to explain the unexplainable?

I poured over Memory of Nature in Aboriginal Canadian and American Contexts, looking for any clue that might bring me closer to understanding the root of Wendigo psychosis. There were references to indigenous exorcisms and healing practices that I found troubling. The book spoke of rituals, deeply rooted in tradition, where shamanic figures would attempt to exorcise the Wendigo spirit from those afflicted. I had read about the medicine men who would perform these rites, chanting and using sacred objects, but something about these accounts unsettled me. The power of the rituals seemed undeniable, yet they were described with such fervor that it was impossible not to question if the accounts were exaggerated—mystical tales woven by centuries of cultural lore.

*It is here I shall begin my confession, and for that, I must sing.*

In the middle of my research, I had another unsettling experience. I woke in the dead of night to a sound that almost seemed like it was calling to me. It was a voice, but not one I recognized. At first, I thought it was just a dream, but the voice persisted, faint but clear: "Come. See me. Find out."

I jumped out of bed, my heart racing. The voice had come from the shadows, and I knew it had come from somewhere deep within this facility. The madness of the place seemed to twist my perception, bending reality until I could no longer tell if I was hearing voices or if my mind was breaking.

What was happening to me? Was I becoming like them? Like Sani?

*The sacred act of confession, the sacred act of eating the eucharist. The body of the human, a portal to the world beyond, outside the silent winter, where the key is to enter, to devour, and be free from the weight of powerlessness and death.*

The fear that had been growing inside of me began to bloom into full paranoia. The night had become suffocating, and the isolation felt like a physical presence that pressed against me from all sides. I couldn't escape it, couldn't outrun the darkness that had begun to creep into my thoughts. Every part of me, every cell, every instinct screamed that I should leave, but something kept me rooted to this place. The truth was just within reach.

I began reading the psychological papers again. This time, I turned to Dr. Richard T. Jabbar's Mental Disorders in Specific Cultures and reread the sections on culture-bound syndromes, particularly those related to cannibalism-induced psychosis. Jabbar discussed how the individual’s belief in the Wendigo spirit could overpower any therapeutic attempts. The mind of the patient—once consumed—became locked in a world of starvation and insatiable hunger. There was no cure, no treatment. In the end, it was only through the intervention of the spiritual world that the afflicted might find peace.

The parallels between the research and my own experiences were becoming too much to ignore. I wasn’t just studying a psychological condition anymore. I was being pulled into it. My thoughts turned darker, more fragmented, as I wondered: Had I, too, been infected by the Wendigo?

*In the eyes, a kind of fire that consumes not with heat and light, but with cold and darkness.*

In my desperation, I turned back to the indigenous traditions. I needed something, anything, to guide me through this madness. That’s when I found the passage in Hunger, Horses, and Government Men that described an exorcism—a ritual performed by a medicine man to rid a person of the Wendigo spirit. The ritual was chillingly detailed. A sacred fire would be started, and the afflicted individual would be surrounded by a circle of medicine men. The chanting would begin, slow and deliberate, as they called upon the spirits of the ancestors. A key part of the ritual was the use of sage—to purify the air—and cedar, to cleanse the spirit. But perhaps the most unsettling part of the ritual was the final step: the patient would be forced to confess their sins, to speak the hunger aloud, to accept the Wendigo inside them and then expel it.

I found myself shivering as I read, my mind reeling with the implications. Was I supposed to undergo such a ritual? Was that the key? The cold dread of my own involvement in this ancient practice felt suffocating. The more I thought about it, the more I couldn’t escape the feeling that I was on the verge of something terrible.

The door to Sani’s room had been left open just a crack, and I could see a shadow moving within. A low muttering filtered out into the hall—he was speaking to himself. But it wasn’t in any language I recognized. It sounded like the guttural tones of someone lost in the depths of their own mind.

I stood frozen at the threshold of his door, fighting the urge to run, knowing that if I didn’t confront this—didn’t confront him—I would be no better than the rest of them. The ones who had succumbed to the hunger.

*Ravenous for the spirit, ravaged by what cannot be. It is between this life, the shedding of our bodies, our spirits into birds.*

With trembling hands, I reached for the handle. The darkness inside seemed to reach out to me, pulling me in.

The door creaked as I stepped into Sani’s room. The air was thick, a mixture of antiseptic and something else—something ancient and raw, like the scent of decay. Sani was sitting in the corner, hunched over, his back turned to me. I could hear the faint sound of mumbling, too soft to catch the words at first.

I cleared my throat. “Sani?”

He didn’t respond at first. His head tilted slightly, as if listening to something only he could hear.

Then, in a low rasp, he spoke. “Come closer. You want to know, don’t you?”

His voice was strange, distorted, as if there was another presence behind it. I hesitated, but the pull was undeniable. Slowly, I stepped into the room, the sound of my footsteps loud in the silence. Sani turned to face me. His eyes were wide, unblinking, but there was something off about them. The whites of his eyes seemed unnaturally bright, almost glowing, and his pupils were dilated, swirling with an unsettling hunger.

“You’ve been reading about me, haven’t you?” he whispered, his voice dripping with something dark and knowing. “About the Wendigo. About the hunger. About the thing that’s waiting inside.”

I shuddered. My heart thudded in my chest, but I forced myself to remain calm. This was what I’d come for, what I’d been preparing for.

“Yes,” I managed to say, trying to steady my voice. “I’ve been trying to understand. What is it, Sani? What’s happening to you?”

He tilted his head to the side, and for a moment, I saw a flicker of something in his expression—something that almost resembled a smile. But it was twisted, grotesque, like it didn’t belong to him at all.

*I'd know the hideous thought, I'd put it into words, to make my memory fade. I will confess what my thoughts know. You will understand, or it will consume you.* 

“You think it’s just a sickness, don’t you?” he murmured. “A simple psychosis. But it’s not. It’s... it’s a calling. The hunger is a voice, a hunger that eats away at your soul. It doesn’t just consume your flesh. It consumes your very essence.”

He reached up, his hand trembling as he brushed his lips with his fingers. “It’s calling you, too. I can see it in your eyes. You’re just like me. You want to feel it. To understand it. You think knowledge will keep you safe.”

I felt my pulse quicken. “That’s not true. I just need to know what’s happening to you.”

*What I am, you are too. Whatever I know, you have forgotten, and when I die, we shall reverse our role. That is why I must be kind to you, and you must be kind to the next, for they are we, and we all suffer what we inflict.*

Sani’s lips parted in a slow, unsettling grin. “What’s happening to me?” he repeated. “Oh, I’m not the one you should be worried about. The Wendigo, it’s inside of you now. Can’t you feel it? That gnawing, that need?”

I flinched. He was right. I had been feeling it, the gnawing hunger, but I hadn’t dared acknowledge it. I had thought it was just fear, the fear of what I was uncovering. But now... now it felt different. Something dark and insidious was growing inside me.

“You don’t understand.” I tried to keep my voice steady, but I could hear the tremor beneath the words. “I’m not like you. I’m not one of them.”

Sani’s eyes narrowed, his gaze sharpening with a predatory gleam. “Oh, you’re much like me. You feel it, don’t you? The hunger is the same for everyone. Whether it’s for flesh... or for truth. It’s the same thing. The more you seek, the more it calls you.”

*Whatever I can remember, I do not remember the taste of human flesh.*

His voice dropped to a whisper, and for a moment, I thought I heard something else—something deeper, more guttural. “And when you finally give in, when you let it take you, there’s no turning back. You’ll become like me... like the others. You’ll hunger for the flesh, for the life... for the power.”

A sudden wave of dizziness washed over me. My mind reeled, as if the very air was becoming thick with something foul, something that didn’t belong. I wanted to back away, but I couldn’t move.

He reached out, his fingers curling like claws, and I felt my body freeze in place. The hunger... it was like a wave crashing over me, rising up from some deep, primal place I didn’t want to acknowledge.

*In isolation, human depravity. The family stares at him, shaking, with his back to them. They look helpless, their mouths slightly open in muted terror.*

“I’ve seen it,” Sani whispered, his voice now low and velvety, like a serpent coaxing its prey. “The Wendigo is not a spirit. It’s a beast—a thing that can take over your mind, your body, your very soul. It waits until you are weak. Until you’ve starved yourself, not just of food, but of humanity.”

I swallowed hard, the words cutting through me. “How... how do I stop it?”

*Winter approaches: the dreaded season of death. White silence, when the song of creation is forgotten, and the darkness glows as the moon knows the snow is white.*

Sani’s grin grew wider, his teeth sharp and inhuman. “You can’t stop it. You’re already too far gone. But you can embrace it. Become it. Just... let go.”

*In the darkness, shivering. It is cold night; the forest is ready to consume me. The forest consumes all. Nothing leaves the forest.*

I felt my pulse pounding in my ears, the dizziness threatening to pull me under. The room was spinning, and for a moment, I thought I saw something moving behind Sani—something shadowy, like a dark shape that loomed in the corners of my vision. But when I blinked, it was gone.

*In the name of God, most holy, I cast thee out, demon.*

“You’ll understand, eventually,” Sani whispered, his voice becoming a low growl. “The hunger will take you, like it took me. And you’ll never be alone again.”

*I am Living Woman, and I've never seen snow, where I live. My people are as old as yours, and I am the sister of your shaman. I know it is my responsibility to bring my strong medicine.*

I couldn’t breathe. My mind was a whirlwind of panic and despair, but something—some twisted instinct—drove me to act. I stepped back, my feet moving on their own as I scrambled for the door.

*As a child, I place my bare feet in the snow, and I laugh.*

I heard Sani’s voice calling after me, a mocking, guttural laugh that echoed in the room, sinking deep into my bones. “Run. Run, but you can’t escape the hunger. It’s already inside of you.”

*My name was like a howl in the night, and I could not escape the call. I was running across the snow, across the ice, and my feet burned and I ran faster and faster, and it was as though a bird of prey gripped me in its claws, and lifted me for distances as I ran, as though I would become airborne.*

I left the room, the door slamming shut behind me. My body was trembling, every part of me alive with an electric fear that felt like it was crawling under my skin.

*The ancient demon takes a piece of you, and replaces it with a piece of itself. It does this again, and again, until you are not you anymore. I must ask for help, I must ask the man I know who is Sings-Like-Wind. He will help me if I tell him I will confess, in the darkness, under open skies, while the sacred fire burns.*

I stumbled down the hallway, barely able to focus on anything other than the sound of my own breath, shallow and frantic. The fear gnawed at me, but it was more than fear—it was hunger. I felt it deep inside, something dark and primal stirring, wanting to break free.

*I'll beg for help from the neighbor, a shaman, whose sister has arrived from a distant land. Two exorcists, Sings-Like-Wind and Living Woman, they say I can be cured, before a sacred fire, with a confession.*

I couldn’t escape the memory of Sani’s eyes, those glowing, predatory eyes. The words he had spoke rang in my mind, like a curse that wouldn’t let go.

*Where was I, when they found me, wandering near my childhood home? How could I have walked barefoot through the snow?*

I could feel it inside me now. The hunger. The thing I had been studying for months, had written papers about, researched obsessively... it had consumed me. And there was no turning back.

*Sings-Like-Wind and Living Woman stopped dancing and placed both pieces of the broken cedar staff across each other in front of me.*

The darkness had taken hold, and I wasn’t sure if I could fight it anymore.

*I stared into the flames, knowing this fire from early childhood. I confessed in song, all that I had done. From me, my spirit lifted, and I became whole again.*
