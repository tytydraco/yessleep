Working at a fast-food restaurant was never my dream job. I recently divorced my wife. Things were bitter, and unfortunately, I had been forced to hand over 75% of my assets by the order of a judge. My now ex-wife used our savings account to hire an expensive lawyer who managed to direct all our problems at myself. It was mostly bull, but what was I to do? I argued the case and how she used OUR money to buy HERSELF a lawyer. But if you know anything about divorce courts, they’re usually hell.

So, I moved my few remaining items out of the house and went to find a new place to live. I eventually found a mediocre apartment complex and settled down there. The next few weeks were terrible. I couldn’t focus and was eventually fired from my desk job due to ‘inefficient production’. My apartment was in a bad spot of town but was cheap enough for me to maintain my rent payments for a few months.

Finding a job was, as you’d expect, difficult for someone who was fired. I went through several interviews but was always left with the same ‘we found a candidate that better fit our needs’ blah blah blah. I hated that. So damn much. They didn’t give a shit about me or anyone else they rejected.

After scrounging the web for weeks, I finally surrendered myself to lower-level jobs. I found a notice that the fast-food restaurant Checkers was hiring night staff. I decided to apply, as it gave me more time during the day to search for another 9-5 job.

Long story short, the interview went well, and I got the job. I was introduced to the night crew and they trained me quickly. It was an easy enough job; practically no one ever came in. Maintaining the grill and helping the crew clean at the end of each shift was decent enough. However, one night, things were different.

It was a cool night in March 2023. I arrived early to find that there was a mad rush of people. We usually had like 10-15 people each night, but there must’ve been at least 25 people at the restaurant. I hurried to the back where I saw three of my coworkers frantically getting things together.

The cashier was named Tyler and looked super relieved to see me. He told me how there was this sudden influx of customers and only 3 workers. It wasn’t working out well and people were starting to get impatient. Jasmine was the second worker, who helped get shakes and fries prepared. She smiled and waved to me. Waving back, I turned then to Joe (my boss), who was flipping burgers on the grill. He looked at me and grumbled, “well come on we ain’t got all day, get on the grill!”.

I quickly adjusted my nametag and got to work. Joe went back to his office as I took over on the grill. Things were stressful, and my shift had just begun. It was almost like the whole town was getting food at once. Thankfully, the 3 of us made a good team and were able to get through the mad rush in about 15 minutes. I sighed in relief and smiled at my coworkers when Joe emerged from his office. “Tyler, Albert, my office now!”.

Yeah, I forgot to introduce myself, my name is Albert and I’m 32 years old. That’s good enough. Anyway, in his office Joe instructed us that we would be doing some side projects that night when it was quiet. He said he’d like us to start searching the inside and outside of the restaurant for any damage that should be reported to the higher ups. Then he wants us to refill everything in the dining room (napkins, condiments, etc.). And then finally he said we needed to get an inventory together of our food. Tyler and I nodded and went back to the front. We rolled our eyes at each other and began planning.

We checked all around the inside of the restaurant and everything looked good. We then filled the napkin dispensers, salt & pepper shakers, ketchup bottles, etc. Then we cleaned off the tables the best we could.

By the time we finished all of that, it was about a quarter past 2AM. I was due for my break in the next hour, so I decided to spend some time getting inventory together in the fridge. Tyler suddenly remembered that we didn’t check the outside of the restaurant for damage, so he went outside and began investigating. I began at the beginning of the fridge and worked my way to the back. I knew we had to do the freezer still, so I tried to prepare myself for the immense cold that I thought would soon follow.

Going through each box, I had most of the numbers written down. Food, condiments, etc. I went towards the last set of boxes in the corner when something caught my eye. I thought I saw a faint purple glow coming from behind the boxes. Moving them aside, I noticed there was a chunk of wall that looked damaged. However, before I could write a note for Joe, I paused. The chunk, which was probably about 3 feet wide, looked like it was rippling. I shook my head and looked back. The wall moved again. I thought I was starting to get very tired and was hallucinating. I got on my knees and reached forward towards the chunk. When my hand contacted the wall, I was immediately thrusted forward hard, and everything went dark.

I woke up on the floor of the fridge. My head was aching. I slowly sat up and looked around. The boxes in front of me were still cleanly organized. I turned back to the wall and saw the damaged chunk was still there, but the ripple and purple glow weren’t. I sighed thinking that I really must’ve been hallucinating. I slowly got to my feet and headed out of the fridge. I saw Tyler and Joe talking in the middle of the dining room. Approaching them, they turned to me.

“Oh, thank heavens, THERE you are!” Joe said. “Where in the world were you? We’ve been looking for ten minutes.”

“I was getting inventory taken care of in the fridge”, I mumbled.

“Hmm, looks to me like you tried to get some shuteye too Al.” Joe said raising an eyebrow.

“Um, you see, I don’t know. I might’ve knocked my head on something and blacked out.” I said rubbing my forehead.

“Oh”, Joe said frowning. “Are you okay Al?”

“Yeah, I think so.”

“Well go get some water and take a break. Don’t worry Tyler will finish inventory” Joe said with a smile on his face.

“Yeah, don’t worry about it man, I’ve got this”, Tyler said patting my shoulder and smiling.

“Thanks guys” I said. I got water and sat down, wiped my eyes, and took deep breaths. A bit later I began to feel better, so I got up and went back to the freezer, where Tyler was counting. He said he was almost finished in the freezer, so I was good to go relax in the kitchen. I obliged and found Jasmine. She saw me and asked, “hey you doing alright?”

“Yes, much better thank you.” I replied with a smile.

I was used to Tyler and Jasmine being nice to me, but Joe smiling at me was a first. I thought that maybe he was just relieved I was okay, but it unsettled me. For the rest of my shift, the restaurant stayed quiet. There were a few orders, but I must’ve been in the zone because getting the burgers made felt so much easier than before.

Once the restaurant closed at 4AM, Joe called a brief meeting with us and gave us all pats on the shoulder for a great shift. He said we could go home early; the morning crew could finish cleaning everything. We thanked him and all went our separate ways.

Once I got to my car, I took a few moments to try and understand what happened in that fridge. In the car I looked in the mirror and saw I had a big bruise on my forehead. Just my luck. Before driving, I checked myself for a concussion, which I hadn’t considered before. A part of me was concerned that my mental state wasn’t quite ‘right’ since things felt like they went ‘too well’ at the end of my shift. But, I seemed fine. I took deep breaths and slowly began the drive home. The drive went noticeably better than usual. The worse part of town usually had scattered debris, drug dealers in the alleys, and potholes. That time though, things were basically spotless. Like the community had finally gotten its shit together.

Getting back to my apartment building, I wasn’t met with the same aura as before. I know it sounds strange, but I’ve run into neighbors before who were jerks. And the halls sometimes reeked of weed. Nothing this time. Once I was inside my apartment, I was met with the same familiar site from before, which helped ease my mind a bit. I quickly ate, showered, and went to bed. I didn’t look further into anything that night; I just needed sleep.

I woke up around 2PM like normal. I felt clear in the head again. Going to the bathroom, I checked the mirror and saw my bruise was already starting to fade. Like before, my pupils were fine, and my balance was normal. I avoided serious injury and was relieved. I spent more time applying for jobs online. Wouldn’t you believe it, but that same day, I received calls from companies asking for interviews. I was ecstatic. This had never happened in all the years I had been applying for jobs. It put me in such a good mood for work that night.

On the way to Checkers, I once again noticed the route was much more peaceful than it had been before. The roads were clean and a group of guys noticed me and waved with big smiles. I was confused but returned a smile and wave too. It felt almost fantastic, I had dealt with so many jerks on the road that the simple gesture made me feel overjoyed!

At Checkers, I was fortunate to see that there were only a couple customers scattered around the place. Tyler and Jasmine were finishing up the two orders when I went back into the kitchen. They both greeted me. I clocked in and immediately got to work prepping patties for future orders. I realized that there weren’t any customers in line at the time and things were just peaceful; the place looked cleaner than usual too. I asked my coworkers if they cleaned the dining room recently.

“Ah, no we’ve just been lucky today!” Tyler said with a grin.

Moments later, Joe came out of his office and approached the counter.

“Hey, Al. Since the place is calm, I have a job for you. We’ve had some issues with the drive-thru speaker. Could you go outside and see if you can figure out what the problem is? We have a small breaker behind the menu that you can check. I hadn’t gotten a chance to check it out yet.”

I told him that I wasn’t too familiar with that type of work, but he assured me that I only needed to see if anything seemed damaged or unplugged. I made my way outside. I went behind the drive thru menu and found the panel I needed. Opening it, I was met with dozens of wires, all with different colors and ports. I was baffled but started examining. I was probably out there for half an hour. I went through all the ports. Nothing was unplugged. I went through the wires. All of them were good. As I closed the breaker door, I heard something strange.

It sounded like a gurgle. I approached the other side of the drive thru board and noticed the speaker. The first sound I heard from the speaker all shift... and it was that. I backed up and listened around to make sure it wasn't something else. Sure enough, it was the speaker. I found myself walking slowly towards it. When I was close enough, I then began hearing something else. It almost sounded like a whisper. “I’m readyyy. I’m readyyy…” It was barely audible, but I picked it up. “I’m readyyy… I’m readyyy…”. I began to mouth the phrase, trying to figure out what it meant. Was one of my coworkers playing a prank on me? No, that couldn’t be… how would they know if the speaker was working? Suddenly without warning, the speaker hissed out a loud “I’M READY!”, causing me to fall on my butt. The speaker then stopped. Without any hesitation, I got up and ran back into the restaurant.

I slammed through the front doors and made my way to the counter. Tyler and Jasmine’s eyes widened as they asked if I was okay. I panted, hands on my knees, before looking up. “Yeah, nice prank guys, you got me good.” As Joe came out of his office, Tyler and Jasmine looked at each other confused.

“What prank?” Jasmine said.

“The one with the speaker outside? The hissing and gurgling sounds?” I claimed.

Jasmine and Tyler had blank looks on their faces. “Neither of us did anything, Al…” Jasmine said.

“What’s going on here?” asked Joe.

I told them about what happened outside at the speaker. Joe then asked me to go through what I had done. After doing so, he asked if I could show him outside what exactly happened. I did, but of course nothing happened that time. Joe shrugged it off, and that was about all we mentioned about it for the rest of the shift. One good thing about this Checker’s was that we had a period before the end of our shift where customers rarely came through, so we could all take short breaks. The break that day was relaxing. It definitely took my mind off that damn speaker. The rest of my shift went by smoothly. Joe even said we could take burgers home for us if we wanted, on him.

The next day, I did my usual routine. I was greeted with another phone call from an employer wishing to schedule an interview, which made me happy again. When it was time to get to Checker’s, I took the bus to shake things up. On the way, it was peaceful and quiet like the day before. But there was one extra thing that caught my attention. There is an alleyway that’s particularly known for its violence and drug dealing… what I saw in there was a strange red substance next to a dumpster. It didn't look like blood, but I couldn’t figure out what it was. Things seemed to be getting stranger following my accident in the freezer. I started to wonder if I did have a concussion after all. I told myself I’d get checked out by a doctor in the morning.

At work, things were normal until our break. Joe said we could take the whole hour. Tyler and Jasmine asked if I wanted to go to an all-night ethnic café down the street. I was delighted, as I was in the mood to try a new place. It was a very nice night. I almost forgot how great it was just relaxing at night with friends, without worrying about work or gangs.

We got to the restaurant; it looked nice inside and there were quite a few people there considering the time. Our hostess greeted us with a huge smile and showed us to our seats. Tyler said he’s been there several times and loved it. He just told me to keep an open mind. Our waitress welcomed us with a smile and our menus. Tyler was certainly right, as none of the names made any sense. I ended up getting what I was told was a stew.

Tyler and Jasmine said they really enjoyed working with me and wanted to show their appreciation with a gift. They then presented me with a blue sweater that Tyler had somehow kept hidden. I was amazed and thanked them. After some more lighthearted conversations, the waitress came back with our food.

My mood dropped immediately. The stew was a brown mixture of what looked like slimy meat and mushy rice. Tyler and Jasmine’s dishes also looked awful. Tyler got a sandwich with a sickly green bread and greasy red meat. Jasmine got a salad with brown lettuce and a big blob of a black, shiny liquid in the middle. I looked to both of them uncertain. Tyler laughed and reassured me this was normal. I shakily grabbed my spoon and scooped up a bit of the stew. The smell was rancid, but with a deep breath I quickly ate it. It wasn’t as bad as it looked, but it was sour. I didn’t want to be rude though, so I kept eating. Tyler and Jasmine both ate normally and looked like they were really enjoying their food. I shuddered as I kept eating more and more of that brown stuff. After Tyler reached the middle of the sandwich, I heard a sickly popping noise. The meat popped and a puddle of red goo dripped onto his plate. I nearly barfed but kept it down. Tyler laughed and said, ‘oops I forgot about that part!’.

After an agonizing meal, we left and headed back to the restaurant. I felt like crap but managed to eat the whole bowl. On the way back, I had to duck into an alleyway and retch. Tyler rested a hand on my shoulder and said “ah, well I guess that place isn’t for everyone. You good Al?”. Nodding, he helped me back to the street and to the restaurant.

Once we were back on, Joe had me start cleaning the tables. He noticed I looked bad and knew keeping me away from food would probably be a smart move. As I approached the final hour of my shift, I was finally feeling better. I finished cleaning and refilling condiments in the dining room. That’s when I looked up and noticed no one was manning the counter.

I called out for my coworkers but got no response. I went behind the counter. No one was there, but the grill was still on. A single burger was getting overcooked, so I took it off and chucked it. I then saw a bit of light coming out of Joe’s office. I began slowly walking towards the door, when I heard a whispering sound coming from the other side. I crept over as much as I could and began listening. Joe, Tyler, and Jasmine were in there having a discussion…

\*‘I told you we don’t need to rush this. We have him. We must be patient. Why the hell did you take him to that damn restaurant?’ ‘I wanted to earn his trust more… and I was hungry.’ ‘Oh yeah that must’ve worked well, huh? Anyway, trust me, we won’t be waiting much longer. Once the process is complete, we will be good until the next one comes along.’ ‘I wish The One knew how hungry we truly are... I'm getting sick of this slop.’ ‘By all means, go tell him yourself then. Just be grateful we have a fresh one here; this is what we've been waiting for.’\*

I was frozen with confusion and fear. What the hell was going on? Were they talking about me? Unsure what was happening, I crept back behind the counter. A few minutes later, Joe’s door opened. All three of them came out and walked towards me.

“Ok guys listen, we’re doing very well so far but I think as I’ve told you two already, we need to find new ways to bring in more customers. I got a call from headquarters and they- Al you okay?!?”

I stuttered out a yes and smiled. My armpits were sweaty, and I could tell it was noticeable. Deep down I knew I had to get out of there. I just needed to.

“Al, I can see you’re still not feeling well. I get it, food can be very hit or miss. Come here, let’s get you a glass of water.” Keeping suspicions low, I agreed. Sitting down at a dining room table, I took a few sips of water as Joe finished talking about bringing in new customers.

When that was over, I quickly got up. It must’ve been too quick, because Joe and Tyler looked at me suddenly. I stuttered saying I needed to use the bathroom. Joe nodded with a smile. I slowly backed up and turned around. Right before I needed to make a left to get to the bathroom, I turned right and bolted for the front door. When I was a few steps away, I felt something hard hit the back of my head. I fell to my knee and a chloroform rag was shoved in my face. I passed out…

I eventually woke up in a strange place. It was very dark, but I managed to see the outlines of a couple dozen people standing a few feet away. I was sitting on a stool with my ankles and wrists tied together. Once my eyes adjusted, I saw the outlines of Joe, Tyler, and Jasmine approach. They had robes on, hoods over their heads. Joe then said:

“Al. You saw what type of slop we have to eat here. We are all starving for something better. Something more. I'm happy to say you have been selected. You should feel honored, being the next chosen one for our lord. We all appreciate your cooperation and will make sure you are rewarded. But now, we begin.”

Suddenly, all of the figures looked up as they started chanting. Their eyes began to glow a shade of yellow. They kept repeating the same chant. Something I couldn’t understand. Then Joe’s booming voice started reciting:

“O HOLY ONE. YOUR LOYALISTS PRESENT TO THEE A NEW SPIRIT FOR US TO FEAST. A FRESH SOUL FOR US ALL. IN THE HOPES WE WILL BE NOURISHED AGAIN!”

The room around me started to rumble. I then saw a bright yellow glow emerge behind me. I jumped from the stool, falling to the ground as I saw what was happening. An altar was set up with a dozen red candles and a large gap was forming in the ground in front of it; the yellow glow was spilling out of it, before I saw a giant, hideously deformed hand fly out of it, slamming the ground. Its fingers abnormally long and gray, with long black fingernails, began clawing the floor. The other hand flew out, slamming onto the altar, crushing it. All the candles faded out.

I struggled with the rope. The knot was double tied. Its body then emerged… it was a strange shadowy figure. Small ripples flew off its figure, like a fire. I saw the outline of a face in the figure. Mouth wide open, sockets empty.

I began thrusting my wrists around, trying to slip my hands out. As the creature finished emerging, the glow disappeared, and the loyalists suddenly took a knee. The creature I could tell was staring right into my soul… as I began sweating hard, I was almost relieved to feel the rope moving down my right hand. Then, the people chanted the same thing: “The holy creature always has the first bite, we are grateful. We are grateful.”

Suddenly the creature began to glow red. The room shook again. I was able to yank my hand out of the rope. The loyalists were on one knee, heads lowered towards the ground. I untied my other hand. The creature’s figure began stretching out, the light continuing to glow; red streams started to circle it. I fumbled with the knot around my ankles. As I miraculously got it off, I stumbled to my feet, right as the creature screeched.

I bolted. I leapt over the loyalists and slammed through the door in the back of the room. I was back on the street. I recognized it. I was close to Checkers… those fools only took me down the road. I knew what I needed to do… this place was not my own. I wasn’t dreaming. I was in a different reality, a different dimension. There WAS a portal in the fridge. And I failed to recognize the signs. The uncomfortably clean streets, the friendly people, my “coworkers” being super nice, and that damn food I ate. They lured me there. They tried to keep me happy and unaware. They wanted me to stay. They wanted to devour my soul... but they slipped and took me to that repulsive cafe. I had to get the hell out of there.

As I started sprinting down the road, I heard the screams of the creature echoing through the building. After I ran about a block, the creature flew out of the building. It started using its disgusting hands to propel forward towards me. The loyalists following next to it; their eyes glowing a bright yellow color, full of fury and hunger.

The environment around me began changing. The sky went completely black. The buildings began turning an eerie shade of red. The grass, where it used to grow, turned into red sand, like what I saw next to the dumpster. Black puddles also began forming in the road.

As I kept running, the world around me kept breaking apart. More red sand appeared, and the buildings beside me began almost melting. The creature was gaining on me. I had to start leaping over black puddles to avoid them. Jumping over the last, I ended up dropping my apartment keys. I cursed as they fell into the puddle. As they fell in, I saw black goopy hands begin viciously tearing them apart. Too late to salvage them.

Breaking through Checkers’ front door, I made my way to the fridge. The creature slammed through the door as well, about 3 steps behind me. In the fridge, I pushed aside boxes and dove for the corner. I could see the ripple in the wall again, the creature behind me leapt. I felt myself lurch forward. Everything then went black again.

I woke up on the floor of the Checkers fridge. My head was throbbing. Boxes laid all around me. I heard Joe’s voice as he entered the fridge: “What the devil are you doing in here? What happened?” He came over and knelt as I began sitting up. “Well?” Joe said.

“I… I think I tried to move these boxes out of the way at once. They must’ve fallen on my head and knocked me out. Oh God…”

Joe, eyeing me down, then sighed. “You should get some water, son.” He guided me to a table. Tyler and Jasmine were behind the counter, staring at me.

“Good lord Al, your head’s bleeding, what happened?” Jasmine cried.

“Boxes fell on his head” Joe said as he sat me down. “Albert, your pupil’s dilated, and your forehead is bloody. I’m getting you an ambulance.”

Once at the hospital, a doctor diagnosed me with a concussion and told me I had to stay the night so they could monitor me. The next day I was cleared to leave and went home. Traumatized from Checkers, I began searching for more jobs. I ended up applying to a dozen. Over the next week, I got much better and had a few interviews scheduled for later.

Returning to Checkers, I found myself frantically checking the fridge. No portal seemed to be there. No ripples.

Over the next two months, things seemed much better. I ended up getting a new job for a firm across town. I left Checkers and moved into a house. I even called my ex-wife one night; during the two-hour call, we slowly began repairing our relationship. We swore we’d try to become friends again. She even apologized for divorce court and wanted to give me back some of the things she ‘won over me’.

Then one day, I was out in my backyard. I had just shared a quick conversation with my friendly neighbor and began planting some flowers. On the third flower, I dug and felt something tough. Removing the dirt, I saw... dark red sand. I froze. I rubbed my eyes. Dark red sand. I looked all around me. Everything had appeared normal, but the sand was still there in front of me. The realization hit me like a ton of bricks… I had not escaped. I was still there.

I tried to act cool. I went to my garage and grabbed my bike. I knew where I needed to go. Cars drove through normally, people on the sidewalk were chatting amongst each other. No one acknowledged me with that weird ‘friendly’ attitude. I had a plan. I’d casually go back into Checkers and say I forgot something when I quit. Then hope for the best… it was all I could think of.

Once there, I entered. I did not see Joe, Tyler, or Jasmine. Expected, since this was in the middle of the afternoon. The restaurant had no customers. Two employees were behind the counter. I didn’t recognize either of them. Walking up, the cashier greeted me. “Hello sir, what can I get for you today?”

I then explained to them how I was a former worker who quit the night shift. I had only just remembered that I forgot to take something with me. I was being annoyed by my one coworker and decided to hide it in the fridge.

The cashier’s eyebrow raised. “Fridge? Why would you hide something in a fridge?”

Quickly I responded “well, a few months ago, I remember there being a lot of inventory in the fridge. To keep it away from my coworker, I hid it on the bottom shelf. It was supposed to be a birthday present for my sister, but I forgot about it until just today. I only hid it to prevent my coworker from possibly breaking it.”

The other employee then asked why I needed it ‘so urgently’.

I hesitated: “I, um, well just wanted to get it out of your way… and I want to grab it if it’s still here. I could make it a Christmas gift instead.”

The cashier asked what the gift was. I responded that it was a locket that she had wanted for years. I had finally found it and was going to surprise her with it … the cashier suddenly lowered his eyebrows: “Hold on, if she was desperately looking for one for years, and you miraculously found one, how did you suddenly just ‘forget’ it?”

I didn’t expect that. “I don’t know honestly.”

He continued: “and how did you not realize on her birthday that you forgot it? You certainly implied that your sister’s birthday passed since you wanted to give it to her for Christmas instead.”

He got me. “Well… I guess I’m just a bad brother.”

The cashier saw through it. “Wait here sir, I’m getting my manager.”

A few moments later, another man came out. “Sir, I’ve been told about your issue. We just had the fridge cleared out two weeks ago. It’s certainly gone by now. And it doesn’t seem like you are being very truthful with us. Former employee or not, you are not allowed behind the counter unless you still work here. I’m going to have to ask you to leave now.”

I couldn’t do anything other than just nod and walk out slowly. I could hear the three of them mumbling behind me. I couldn’t tell what they were saying, but I had a hunch.

Exiting Checkers, I began to think about my next steps. I started slowly walking down the road with my bike when I saw the sky. The bright afternoon sky began to slowly darken. I then began to hear sirens blaring everywhere. The fresh green grass began to morph into that dark red sand again. In the distance, I could see dozens, if not hundreds, of yellow lights and some feint yelling.

As I began to back up, I jumped when I heard someone suddenly say “well, well, well. Albert.” Quickly turning, I saw the three employees, eyes wide open and bloodshot. Smiles were abnormally wide. “You made our lord very angry when you tried to escape before. Thankfully, its planning skills are better than all. It commanded us to trick you once more. The waiting game for a guaranteed prize was worth the cause. Ah here we go!”

I heard the screech from behind me. I looked. Hundreds of loyalists were running right towards me. Eyes filled with more fury and hatred than before. And behind them emerged the creature. It was NOT happy.

I froze. I didn’t expect what happened next. The creature was so upset that it began mowing down its own loyalists. Dozens of wails and screams, as their figures vaporized inside the creature. They tried to get out of its way, but there were too many of them.

It was time. I was suddenly grabbed by two of the employees; “WE HAVE HIM YOUR HOLY ONE” the third said, as he ran forward and took a knee. I struggled, the grips of the loyalists tight around my biceps. I flexed, wriggled, tried everything. Then, in an act of desperation, I jumped up and propelled my legs into both loyalists as hard as I could. That act was enough for them to loosen their grip as they stumbled backwards and fell. I hit the ground hard, right near a bubbling black puddle. I rolled out of the way right as a goopy hand launched towards me. Getting to my feet, the creature was now a block away from me and the loyalists were just getting up. The third, still kneeling, turned and saw me as I ran into Checkers.

“YOU FOOLS! GET HIM! HE’S GETTING AW-AAAHH!” The loyalist I could tell was vaporized. The two others scrambled to chase me down. Entering Checkers, I made for the fridge. As I went past the counter, I saw the two other loyalists shoving their way into the doorway… and right as they made it through, I heard the creature roar. Two other agonizing screams faded, as I knew they were gone. Entering the fridge doors, I heard the creature charge through the dining room. I shoved numerous boxes out of my way. I found the portal again. It was rippling again. The door swung off its hinges as the creature roared once more. I went for the portal. It went for my leg. It touched me. I had a searing pain, worse than pins and needles, fly up my left leg. I screamed right as I found myself being sucked into the portal.

I emerged on the other side. I did not black out. I was back in a fridge again. Turning back, I heard a quiet roar as the portal rippled like crazy. I could tell the creature was trying to claw its way through. Without thinking, I grabbed the heaviest box I could find and slammed it as hard as I could into the portal. It worked. The portal shattered. Glass fragments flew everywhere. The furious screech of the creature faded as the bond between our two worlds was broken.

Moving the box over, I noticed nothing unusual. No fragments of glass, no odd feeling in my leg, no ripples in the wall. Against my better judgement, I slowly reached for the wall. I stopped centimeters away. I was not pulled in. Then without thinking, I slammed my hand into the wall. Nothing happened. It was just a normal wall again. I began giggling, like I was losing my mind. I looked around the fridge. Everything was as I had remembered before. But I still wasn’t convinced. Moments later, a very angry Joe stormed into the fridge. “Albert what in the world do you think you’re doing?!? I’m not paying you to sit on your butt and throw boxes around like you’re in 1st grade!”

I smiled for a moment, but then got up, pissed. “Hey, stay the hell away from me. Who are you?!?”

Joe scoffed “it’s obviously me, Joe. Who else would I be??”

After a moment of silence, Joe’s eyes widened for a moment before returning to normal. He told me I needed to talk with him in his office immediately. I obliged, keeping a close eye on him.

Tyler tried to come over to see what happened, but I shot him a dirty look and he backed off. I didn’t trust anything.

In his office, Joe tried to calm me down. He was a bit arrogant, but his attitude helped me think I was back in the real world. I eventually explained what I thought happened, in which Joe gave me a baffling look. He said that was ridiculous, asked if I was okay, and offered to call an ambulance for me. Everything I said, he shook off as a hallucination or dream, as those events were ‘impossible’. I could see a glimmer in his eye, like he was lying to me. But what could I do at that point?

He asked if I wanted an ambulance again, but I just shook my head and quit on the spot. Joe asked I reconsider and offered me a raise, but I declined. He wished me the best and said I was welcome back whenever.

Since that moment, I’ve had episodes of paranoia and nightmares. However, I’ve been able to fully convince myself that I’m back in the real world. And I’ve since began rebuilding my relationship with my ex-wife too... for real this time. We’re friends again and she’s been very supportive of me and my mental health struggles. While things have slowly gotten better, I couldn’t get Checkers out of my mind. Something fishy was going on. I wasn’t sure what the hell it was, but I knew something was wrong… but I got away, and I’m never going back to that Checkers again. Please everyone, stay safe out there. I’m okay now. I just hope the rest of you will be too.
