Honestly, I never even believed in haunted places before this happened. I like horror movies, sure—but ghosts? Spirits? Nah. I used to roll my eyes at that stuff. But then again, I’d never been to Chillingham Castle before. And more importantly, I’d never *stayed overnight* there.

I know it’s open to the public now—barely. You can do guided tours in the daytime, visit the gift shop, pose for pictures outside the iron gates. But what most people don’t realize is that not everything’s *still open*. There are sections now—whole wings—cut off with velvet ropes and locked doors. Rooms that no longer show up on the tour map. Places that used to be part of the overnight stays, but aren't anymore.

And yeah, I was one of the first. Me and my friend Tilda—we were just teenagers back then—and we were thrilled when we found out Chillingham was finally letting guests stay overnight for the first time in years. We thought it was going to be one of those “quirky” haunted castle experiences—nothing more than drafty halls, staged creaks, maybe an actor in period dress lurking in a corner.

But that’s not what we got.

And if you’re reading this thinking I’m full of it, that’s fine. I would’ve thought the same. But I need to write this down. I need someone to know what happened inside those walls.

We should’ve never come to this place. I knew it even before the gates closed behind us with a moan like rusted bones. The light was falling fast over the Northumberland hills, spilling gold into grey. A storm threatened far off, the sky bruised above the trees, and Chillingham Castle rose before us like something out of a nightmare—more fortress than fairytale, its battlements jagged against the clouds.

“I love it,” said Tilda, of course—Tilda who never feared anything, not even the thought of sleeping in the same halls where men were bled dry on racks and women gave birth in windowless cells.

She was nineteen, fearless, and had driven us in her battered Morris Minor all the way from Alnwick for a weekend away. "A laugh," she called it. “Just a cheeky little haunted stay.”

But I felt it the moment we crossed the threshold—an atmosphere not just heavy but *watchful*.

The courtyard was slick with recent rain, echoing with the shriek of a distant peacock. No one greeted us. No welcome, no innkeeper. Only a printed sign on a crooked stand:  
**“Visitors Please Proceed to the Great Hall. Rooms Assigned at Check-In.”**

Tilda smirked. “Very posh.”

Inside, the air was still—*wrongly* still. Not the hush of peace, but a stifled silence, as if the walls themselves held breath. Shadows clung to the corners, thicker than they ought to be, and every floorboard seemed to groan in protest as we walked. The scent of stone and mildew was thick, threaded with something older—like soot and iron and rot long-scrubbed but never quite gone.

The tapestries were the worst. They hung stiff and rotting on the walls, faded faces of saints and sinners, their eyes stitched in ancient thread, their mouths half open in silent horror.

“Looks like they’ve kept the original décor,” I murmured.

Tilda laughed softly and spun on her heel. “Bet you ten quid there’s a ghost in the loo.”

We made our way toward the Great Hall, though the corridor seemed to stretch farther than it should, the portraits watching us with cold disdain.

When we reached the hall, the hearth sat cold and dark, its stone belly yawning wide beneath the soot-stained mantel. No flames, no embers—just a pile of brittle ash that looked long undisturbed. The silence in the room was heavy, unbroken even by the wind pressing against the windows. A guestbook lay open on a side table, its pages stained with watermarks and filled in a spidery, inconsistent hand. The most recent entry was dated three nights ago. Just beneath the signature—illegible, a scrawl of slanted letters—someone had written in smaller, darker ink: *Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.*  
No other names had been added since.

A thick iron key lay beside the book. Tied to it was a tag, handwritten:  
**“East Wing – Room of the Rose.”**

I wanted to leave, to ask if perhaps we should turn back, but my voice had begun to stick in my throat.

As we climbed the east staircase, the castle grew colder, though the radiators hissed and clanked like they lived. Our footsteps sounded wrong—delayed, echoed too long. Once, I turned to glance behind us and thought I saw a figure retreat around the corner. I called out, “Hello?”—but received only silence in reply, thick and pressing as velvet.

When we reached the door marked “Room of the Rose,” I noticed the wallpaper had peeled into the shape of a face. It wasn’t intentional—I don’t *think* it was. But the eyes in that pattern stared out through water stains and cracks like it had been watching a very long time.

Tilda unlocked the door.

Inside, the room was dim and dusty. A single bed stood beneath a canopy of cobwebs, its quilt sagging in the middle like something had once lain there too long. A dressing table crouched beside it, draped in an antique cloth stained with age and time, the lace edges curling like dried petals. But the worst thing was the mirror. It covered nearly the entire wall opposite the bed—and it was shrouded by a heavy curtain, the velvet sagging in the middle as if something behind it were breathing.

I reached for it instinctively. Tilda grabbed my wrist.

“Don’t,” she whispered, her accent suddenly very small. “It’s colder in there than it ought to be.”

She was right. And for the first time since I’d known her, Tilda was afraid.

And so was I.

Tilda let go of my wrist slowly, the warmth of her hand lingering like a caution, and we stood in the doorway of the Room of the Rose without stepping in. Something about the silence inside made me feel as though the room had *just* been vacated, as though someone—or something—had been waiting, poised just beyond the veil of time.

“Well,” Tilda said at last, forcing a chuckle. “It’s only for a night. Let’s not be daft.”

Her voice rang false in the stale air, the cheerfulness too thin, too rehearsed.

We set down our rucksacks beside the dresser, its drawers already half open as if rifled through in haste. The air in the room felt… *wrong.* There was no other word for it. It pressed on my chest—not cold exactly, but dense. Unnatural. Like the space had been hollowed out and filled with something else entirely.

The mirror across the room, still shrouded in that heavy red velvet curtain, tugged at my attention. I could *feel* it behind the fabric—its weight, its silence. It felt… aware.

Tilda threw herself onto the bed and sighed dramatically. “Lovely. I feel like I’m staying in a crypt.”

I didn’t answer. I had wandered to the window. Outside, the light was dying fast, leaving behind only the purpling hush of dusk. The gardens below, long overgrown, twisted with bramble and blackened rosebushes, swayed in a wind I could not hear.

Then, something scraped across the ceiling above us.

It was sudden. Sharp. A dragging noise, like something heavy being pulled across the floor directly overhead.

Tilda sat up, eyes wide. “Did you hear—?”

Another scrape, slower this time. Longer. Then silence.

“Maybe someone’s staying upstairs,” she said quickly. “Caretaker, or… maybe there’s another guest.”

“In the attic?” I whispered.

She didn’t answer.

I opened the door and stepped into the corridor. The light in the nearest sconce buzzed faintly, then dimmed to a dull orange. The hallway stretched away on either side—empty.

I turned back and froze.

Then, from inside the walls—*inside the bloody walls*—came a sound like whispering. Not loud. Not clear. But definitely there. A soft, slithering murmur, like breath forced through lips that hadn’t spoken in decades.

We both heard it.

Tilda tried to laugh again, but it cracked halfway and fell into silence. “It’s an old building,” she said, voice thinner than before. “Loads of drafty pipes… walls settling… that sort of thing.”

“Then why does it sound like it’s *right here?*” I whispered.

My eyes darted to the corners of the room—the shadows pooled thickly there, unmoving, unnatural. There was no echo, no distance to the sound. It wasn’t behind the walls or above us or drifting from the corridor outside. It was *here*, in the room, breathing the same air we were.

Tilda didn’t answer. Her face had gone pale beneath the yellowed light, the cocky smirk she always wore now crumbling at the edges. Her silence scared me more than anything. If even Tilda, *fearless* Tilda, couldn’t joke her way through this…

I tried to reason with myself—tried to *explain it away*, like she had.  
*Old pipes. Floorboards. A rat in the wall. Wind through a vent.*  
But every explanation tasted false in my mouth. That wasn’t the sound of something *settling.* It was the sound of something *awake.*

My heart thumped hard enough to rattle my ribs. I wrapped my arms around myself, pressing my hands to my elbows, grounding myself with the pressure. The castle was cold, but I was sweating. A sheen of it slicked the back of my neck, beading at my hairline, trickling down my spine in slow, icy threads.

We stood in that room for what felt like forever, the failing light outside casting elongated shadows on the floor, the sound of the wind now replaced with that too-loud silence that always comes just before something breaks.

And something *did*.

It began not with a bang, but with a voice. A long, slow voice—not from either of us—but from around us. It seeped out of the walls, the floorboards, the very air, low and quivering. I couldn’t make out the words—just the *shape* of them, warped and distant, as if the castle itself had finally decided to speak.

I froze. Every hair on my arms stood on end. My heart stuttered, then began to pound so violently I could hear it in my ears, a thudding drumbeat of panic. Cold sweat burst across my skin, but the air in the room remained frigid. I couldn’t breathe properly. My chest felt too tight, like something heavy sat on it.

“Did you—” I whispered, but my voice cracked before I could finish.

Tilda’s hand found mine, and her fingers were ice-cold and shaking.

Then it spoke again, slower this time—“Let me out.”

My knees buckled. I had to grab the corner of the bed to stay upright. My whole body trembled, not with cold, but with that primal terror that lives deep in the animal part of the brain—**run, run, run**—but I couldn’t move.

Tilda backed toward the door, dragging me by the hand. “It’s in the room,” she said. Her voice had gone flat and strange. “It’s in our bloody *room*, Kaylee—don’t *look.* Don’t listen!”

“I’m not looking!” But I was. I couldn’t help it.

Then came a knock—*from inside* the wall-sized mirror.

Three slow, deliberate raps that rattled the glass.

We both screamed. It wasn’t theatrical. It wasn’t cute. It was raw, panicked, and animalistic. I couldn’t breathe. I felt dizzy. I could taste fear in my throat.

Tilda shrieked, threw open the door, and yanked me after her.

The hallway was dark—*darker* than it had been. The sconce outside our room sputtered and died as we passed beneath it. The corridor stretched in both directions like a tunnel carved through hell.

And then we ran.

Ran like hunted things, down that cursed corridor, the walls leaning in, the floor tilting beneath us, the silence crashing over us like waves.

We didn’t stop.

We didn’t look back.

We *couldn’t.*

We didn’t speak as we ran—couldn’t. Our breath came ragged, shallow, sharp with panic. The castle seemed to shift around us, as though the very corridors were conspiring to trap us, to fold in and twist, confusing the path we thought we knew. The hallways stretched and narrowed, the sconces flickering violently above like weak stars in a suffocating sky. The carpet underfoot seemed to grip at my shoes, thick and damp, as though we were running through something *alive*.

Tilda was ahead of me now—just a few paces—but her form began to blur, swallowed by the shadows that crowded the hall. Her blonde ponytail swung wildly as she turned a corner, and I pushed myself faster, heart thudding so hard I feared it would burst. I couldn’t feel my arms anymore. My throat burned. The cold had vanished; I was soaked in sweat, yet the air felt too thick, too dense to breathe. The castle reeked of old dust, stone, *and something sweet*, like rotting flowers left too long in a crypt.

“Tilda—wait!” I gasped. My voice came out high and cracked, swallowed instantly by the dark.

She didn’t answer.

I reached the corner she’d turned down and skidded to a halt.

It was a T-junction—two identical corridors stretching in opposite directions, dim and endless, each lined with closed doors that looked exactly the same. But Tilda wasn’t there. Her footsteps had stopped.

My stomach dropped. “Tilda?” I said, louder now.

A single lightbulb flickered overhead, buzzing. The left hallway lay in shadow, thick and almost unnatural, like smoke that had substance. The right hallway held only silence and an oppressive weight that pushed down on my shoulders. My own breath sounded too loud in my ears.

“Tilda, this isn’t funny,” I whispered. “Come back.”

We were separated.

My hand trembled as I pulled the mobile from the pocket of my jeans, my breath rattling in my throat like wind through broken glass. I didn’t even remember taking it with me, but there it was—familiar, scratched, absurdly normal in my shaking fingers. The glowing screen stung my eyes in the gloom.

No signal.

Then, suddenly, one flickering bar.

I thumbed Tilda’s name with frozen hands, my fingers slick with sweat despite the castle’s biting cold. The phone rang. Once. Twice. My pulse thumped with every ring. I paced in a small, frantic circle in the corridor, the shadows seeming to press closer with each step.

The call connected.

Static exploded into my ear—loud and jarring, like a wasp’s nest had burst inside my skull. I jerked the phone back, heart sinking in my chest.

Then—

A whisper.

At first, so faint I thought it was the echo of my own breathing. Then it came again, hissing through the crackle.

*"H-help… me…"*

I froze.

My skin went cold. My jaw clenched. The voice had Tilda’s accent, her tone… but something was wrong.

“*Tilda?*” I whispered, breathless. My voice caught halfway up my throat. “Where are you? Say something again.”

A pause.

Then it came once more.

*"Help… me… come get me…"*

Something inside me twisted violently.

It couldn’t be her.

“Tilda, what’s the name of your cat?” I whispered. “Say his name.”

Static.

I sat on the floor, back pressed against the wall. The hallway was silent now, but not still. It *watched*. I could feel it, a prickle at the base of my spine, the way animals know they’re not alone in the woods. My heart hadn’t slowed. My hands still trembled.

And then I noticed the time on my phone. I stared at it blankly at first, not registering what I saw. But when I did, my chest clenched tight.

**1:37 AM.**

*That couldn’t be right.*

We’d only arrived a few hours ago. Had it been that long? I’d lost all track of time. Time *didn’t* work properly in places like this. I could’ve been in the hallway for five minutes… or fifty years.

A sudden *crack* outside made me jump to my feet.

*Thunder.*

The windowpane rattled. I turned toward the thick curtains and reached out, hesitant, fingers brushing the heavy velvet. I tugged it back—and the sky lit up with a jagged silver bolt.

Then came the roar.

The storm had arrived.

The courtyard below was swallowed in darkness, the castle’s outer grounds lit only in brief, violent flashes. The trees whipped violently in the wind, their skeletal branches clawing at the sky. Rain pelted the glass like thrown pebbles, hard and relentless.

I leaned close to the window, pressing my forehead to the cool glass. The car. It was parked just beneath the gatehouse arch, near the cracked stone fountain. I could just make out its shape in the flashes—Tilda’s dented Morris Minor, sagging slightly to the left like always.

My voice trembled. “Maybe she made it out.”

It was the first hope I’d felt in hours.

I squinted harder through the rain.

Was someone sitting in the driver’s seat?

Lightning lit the world again, and in that split-second stutter of light, I *thought* I saw her—head tilted forward, hands on the wheel. Still. Too still.

The light vanished.

Darkness again.

“Tilda…” I whispered.

And that whisper stirred something deep inside me—because if she *was* in the car… why hadn’t she come back? Why leave me in here?

Unless—

Unless it *wasn’t* her.

A loud *bang* somewhere in the castle made me jump back. It could’ve been a shutter, a door, a window—hard to say in this place where every sound echoed wrong. But the idea of Tilda out there alone—or trapped, or worse—was stronger than my fear.

But I had to know.

I had to see if she was in that car.

The corridor felt endless as I crept toward the stairwell, the storm pressing hard against the ancient windows, rattling them in their frames like teeth chattering in fear. Each flash of lightning carved grotesque shadows along the walls—the mounted portraits leered as if they might step down from their hooks. My heart thumped in time with the thunder. The castle’s breath was everywhere: groaning beams, sighing doors, the low hum of something alive beneath the stone.

The lobby was empty. My footsteps echoed off the checkered tile floor as I slipped out through the heavy oak doors into the courtyard. The wind slapped my face with rain, cold needles biting through my clothes. The car sat beneath the gatehouse archway exactly where I’d seen it from the window.

I stumbled toward it, shoes splashing in puddles, shouting over the storm. “Tilda! Tilda, are you out here?”  
No answer. Just the wind.

When I reached the car, I could see her silhouette behind the fogged glass—motionless, head bent forward. My relief came all at once, choking me.

Before I could knock on the glass, the door *clicked* and opened.

Tilda stepped out.

For the briefest moment, something like relief surged up through my chest. But it shattered the second I saw her properly.

She was soaked but didn’t seem to care. Her hair clung to her face in strings, her eyes wide—far too wide—and her mouth was stretched into a grotesque, unnatural grin, open so wide it looked painful, as though her skin might split.

I froze. My pulse thumped once. Twice. Then began to race.

“I—Tilda,” I stammered, rage and confusion colliding in my throat. “What the *hell*, Tilda? This is getting really old!”

My voice cracked like a whip in the air, but she didn’t flinch.

“All for what?” I snapped. “Some joke? You think this is *funny*? I nearly *died* in there! If this is some kind of twisted prank—”

I waited for her to say something. To call me a jerk. To laugh, even.

Instead, there was silence.

Then—barely audible beneath the storm—a *faint laugh*. A breathy, rasping wheeze, like a rusted pipe trying to exhale.

It might not have even been real.

Her shoulders began to tremble.

And that smile didn’t falter.

Her lips were pulled so taut I could see her gums. Her hands were clasped tightly to her chest, fingers twitching. Her body shivered—not from cold, but from *delight*, like something inside her could barely be contained.

One moment she was trembling with that grotesque, lipless grin, and the next, she *lunged*—a blur of limbs and storm-wet hair. Her hands hit my shoulders with bone-cracking force, sending me sprawling backward into the mud beside the car. My elbow slammed into a jagged stone, pain shooting up my arm like fire.

“*Tilda—!*” I shrieked, but she was already on top of me, knees digging into my ribs, her face inches from mine.

 “Tilda, stop!” I shrieked, struggling beneath her. “Please—*what’s wrong with you?!*”

Then she bit me.

Her teeth sank into my shoulder like a trap springing shut. The pain was *blinding*. I screamed—loud and raw—and thrashed beneath her, but she only bit harder, shaking her head like a dog tasting fresh meat.

I grabbed a handful of her hair and yanked, but she didn’t flinch. Her nails dug into my chest as she laughed—with pleasure.

Red clouded my vision.

I slammed the car door into her face. Once. *Twice.* The second hit cracked her nose—or what had *looked* like her nose.

I staggered to my feet.

Tilda screeched—high and choked, a sound that didn’t belong in any human throat—and leapt again.

I ducked. Grabbed the rusty tire iron from the back seat where it’d been since the drive over. My hand was slick with rain and blood, but I gripped it tight and swung *hard*.I didn’t hesitate.

The iron connected with her side. She screamed—shrill, sharp, *wrong*. Her weight shifted and I rolled out from under her, scrambling to my feet. The rain fell harder, washing blood from my shoulder, my vision blurring from pain and panic.

She came at me again.

I swung the tire iron again, this time catching her across the forearm with a sickening *crack*. Her arm dangled unnaturally, but she kept coming, giggling through clenched, red-streaked teeth.

“*Stay down!*” I shouted, backing toward the stone lion fountain.

She lunged again, and I dodged left. She slipped, fell to one knee, and I didn’t wait.

I brought the tire iron down on her shoulder—once. Twice.

*Three times.*

With the final blow, she collapsed face-first into the mud. Her body twitched once. Then lay still.

I stood there, heaving, every muscle shaking, the rain turning the courtyard into a glistening pit. My blouse clung to me like a second skin, soaked through with water and blood.

The tire iron slipped from my fingers.

I stared at her motionless form, panting, heart thundering, pain roaring through my shoulder.

“Well…” I panted, rain washing down my face, “*that’s* the last time I agree to a girls’ night out.”
