I wasn’t a doctor.  
I wasn’t a nurse.  
I wasn’t even someone who made decisions.

I was an IT technician.

At least, that’s what they told me when I started.

The psychiatric facility was remote, several kilometers from any town. Not a place you stumbled upon. The concrete complex looked like a relic from another era: wide, gray buildings, few windows, all angular, all functional. High fences with cameras, guards at the entrances. Anyone who worked there knew not to speak about it.

During my onboarding, I was told it was a facility for extreme cases. People with severe mental disorders. Violent, unpredictable, untreatable in the traditional sense. Rehabilitation, they said. Research, they said as well. I received an ID badge, a key card, and a brief tour.

I first saw the patients only from a distance. Some walked under supervision in the yard, others were escorted in groups. Many appeared absent. Some screamed. Others simply stared into nothing. And there were those who looked completely normal. Too normal.

My workstation was underground. The technical area. Server rooms, surveillance stations, nodes for cameras and sensors. I monitored systems, checked connections, repaired outages. My daily life consisted of screens.

Dozens of monitors displayed hallways, cells, common rooms. Black-and-white. Time-stamped. No names, only numbers. Motion sensors reported activity. Door logs showed who went where and when. Microphones recorded audio, though mostly muted.

I quickly developed routines.  
Morning system check.  
Camera calibration.  
Server temperature check.  
Addressing error messages.

Staring at screens long enough, you become numb. Screams become background noise. Violence becomes motion on a monitor. I told myself I was just handling the technology. That what happened there wasn’t my responsibility.

What unsettled me early on were the floor plans.

Officially, there were floors from ground level down to –3. Basement, technical, storage. These floors appeared on every map. Yet in the system logs, there were repeated accesses to –4, –5, and –6. No plans. No labels. No camera feeds I could access. Just logs. Time stamps. Access permissions.

I once asked an older colleague about it.

“You don’t hear about it,” he said curtly.  
“But the logs—”  
“Don’t. Hear. About. It,” he repeated.

Sometimes I saw on a camera in –2 patients or staff enter an elevator. The display showed no destination. No arrow pointing up. The doors closed. And the elevator never returned. At least, not visibly.

I started to watch more closely.

During breaks, I spoke with other technicians. Most didn’t want to know. Some made jokes. One said to me, “As long as the paycheck is good, I don’t care what happens underneath us.”

That summed it up.

I stayed because I needed the money. The job paid better than anything I’d done before. No clients, no overtime, clear tasks. And as long as I didn’t ask, no one questioned me.

After about a year, I was summoned to the director’s office.

His office was above ground, bright, almost inviting. Large windows, wooden desk, coffee machine. No concrete, no gray. He asked me to sit and studied me for a moment.

“You’re reliable,” he finally said. “Discreet. And you have access to systems others shouldn’t see.”

I said nothing.

“We want to promote you,” he continued. “New position. More responsibility. Internal security.”

He explained that I would no longer only be responsible for the technical systems but also for surveillance, access control, and analysis of sensitive data. I would see what others were not supposed to see.

“Why me?” I asked.

He smiled slightly.  
“Because you don’t ask.”

I accepted.

Before the transfer, I had to sign multiple documents. Confidentiality. No sharing of information. No discussions outside the facility. Violations would have consequences. Nothing was explained further.

From that day, everything changed.

The new floors were different. No clinic atmosphere. No attempt at normalcy. Concrete, metal, heavy doors. Armed security patrolled the hallways. No ordinary staff, only personnel with nameless IDs.

I gained access to new cameras.

And I saw experiments.

Sleep experiments. Patients kept awake for days. Lights never off. Sounds constantly shifting. If someone collapsed, they were awakened. Some began to hallucinate. Others screamed continuously. Some simply stopped responding.

Sensory tests. Rooms without orientation. Heat, cold, absolute silence, then sudden noise. People lost their sense of space and time. Some attacked themselves.

Physical endurance tests. Medication. Injections. Substances I didn’t recognize. Convulsions. Shortness of breath. Cardiac arrest. When someone died, the body was removed. The cameras kept recording.

I saw mutilations. People whose bodies no longer functioned. Bones broken, muscles destroyed. Others lost their speech. Or their personality.

And always, one term appeared: ARES.

ARES-7 unstable.  
ARES-14 aggressive.  
ARES-22 rejected.

One doctor told me, “We try to push people beyond their natural limits.”

“And if it doesn’t work?” I asked.

He shrugged. “Then it’s a failure.”

I saw cannibalism. People attacking each other, driven by hunger, fear, and isolation. Others sat apathetic in corners. Halfway normal, but internally broken.

I saw everything.  
And I looked away.

Then night came.

I was in a tech room, checking cables, when suddenly everything went dark. No flicker, no warning. Absolute darkness. For a moment, I heard only my own breath, then even the low hum of the servers stopped.

Seconds later, the emergency lights kicked in. Deep red. They bathed the room in a color that offered no comfort, more like a permanent state of alarm.

Then the alarms began.

Not a single signal, but multiple at once. Evacuation. Security alert. Emergency protocol. The speakers overlapped; announcements cut off, restarted, sometimes contradicted each other.

Over the radio, voices suddenly appeared. Panicked. Confused.

“Central to all units, we have a breach—”  
“—Test Subject A is free! I repeat, Test Subject A is free!”  
“Sector C lost!”  
“Damn it, they’re coming out of the cells—”

Then screams.

Not over the speakers. Real screams. From the hallways. Shortly after, gunfire. At first sporadic, then in rapid succession, so close the walls seemed to shake.

“Red security alert!”  
“All available units to the lower levels!”

A pause, then another voice, louder, distorted from stress:

“Multiple test subjects are loose! Repeat: multiple subjects are free!”

The radio was filled with screams, frantic orders, broken sentences. I stood frozen, the red light above me, cables still in my hands as if I had forgotten their purpose.

Then one word repeated over the radio, from multiple voices:

“Help.”

At that moment, I knew:

The patients were no longer contained.

The alarm grew louder the further I moved from the tech room. No steady wailing anymore, but overlapping signals, warnings, announcements interrupting themselves. The red emergency lights made the hallways pulse, as if the building were breathing.

I ran.

My steps echoed on the concrete floor, too loud. Behind me, metal crashed somewhere—doors forced open or ripped from hinges. I didn’t dare look back.

Turning a corner, I saw the first bodies. Two doctors lay in the hallway, white coats darkened, blood splattered on the walls. One’s eyes were open. I recognized him. He had explained to me weeks earlier why sleep deprivation was “necessary.”

I ran on.

At the stairwell to the next level, armed security waited. Three men in dark gear, assault rifles at the ready. One shouted orders I barely understood. Then gunfire.

A patient stumbled up the stairs. Barefoot. Half-naked. His face twisted, not with rage, but with fear. He raised his hands, trying to speak.

The soldiers fired.

His body tumbled down the stairs. Motionless. No one checked. They fired further down.

“Don’t stop!” one yelled as he saw me. “Keep going!”

I ran past, two steps at a time. My heart raced so violently I felt dizzy. From the lower levels came screams, shots, the dull thud of heavy doors being broken.

On the next floor, chaos.

Patients ran aimlessly through hallways. Some blood-covered, some blank-eyed. One man slammed his head repeatedly against the wall until he collapsed. Two others beat a third already on the ground. No one intervened.

I saw a security officer trying to lock a door. Something pressed against it from the other side. He screamed, slipped, fell. The door gave way. Only his screaming remained.

I forced myself forward.

Stairs. Always stairs. Up. Away from –4, –5, –6.

In another stairwell, soldiers fired down a corridor as multiple patients approached. Some ran straight into the line of fire, as if unaware. Others dodged, screamed, attacked.

I ducked as a bullet whizzed past, sparks flying off the wall.

“Down!” someone yelled.

I stumbled, barely catching the railing. My hands shook. My legs felt like lead.

Eventually, I heard my name.

A colleague. IT. Pale, bloodied. I couldn’t tell if it was his blood.

“Come with me!” he shouted. “The north wing is blocked!”

We ran together. Wrong turns. Dead ends. Locked doors whose card readers were dead. At one point, we had to go through a room of overturned beds. A patient crawled across the floor, stared at us, said nothing.

I stepped over him.

The building felt endless. Each floor the same. Each corridor longer than the last. My breath came in gasps. My lungs burned. My legs barely held me.

Finally, we reached an exit. Cold night air hit us. Gunfire still echoed behind.

We ran on. Away from the building. Away from the screams.

The facility burned behind us.

Later, they said it was a technical malfunction.  
An unfortunate incident.  
No survivors among the patients.

I quit.

Now I work at another IT company. Normal servers. Normal clients.

But sometimes I see logs. New systems. New buildings.

And the same codes.

ARES.

And then I understand.

It wasn’t a breach.  
It was a test run....
