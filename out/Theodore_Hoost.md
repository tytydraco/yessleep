We were bored. That’s the real reason we did it.
Me, Jay, Connor, and Lacey—just four media students with cheap cameras and too much time. We’d grown up on creepypasta, spent years laughing at the old urban legends. “The Host” was one of those names you whispered at sleepovers, like Bloody Mary or Slender Man.
Say his name wrong and he’ll kill you through the screen.
He hates being recorded.
Don’t watch the tape.
We wanted views. We wanted something freaky for our channel. So we grabbed our gear and headed out to the old broadcast building on the edge of town. It used to be a TV station, but after the power plant explosion that killed Theodore Hoost on live air, it was abandoned.
Jay was all hype, swinging his DSLR around.
“Yo, we’re actually doing it, guys! We’re meeting Mr. Static himself!”
“Don’t call him that,” Lacey teased, but she said it with a grin.
Connor, ever the skeptic, shook his head. “Urban legends are just BS. Let’s film our intro, get some b-roll, and bounce.”

The place was a wreck—dust-covered consoles, dead monitors, ceiling tiles sagging. We set up three cameras:
• One on a tripod pointed at the main control room TV.
• One handheld with Jay.
• One body cam on me.
We powered up a portable generator to bring life to the old screens. They flickered on, weak and fuzzy, spitting out dead channels and white noise.
Connor laughed.
“Spooky, huh? Guys, this is a joke.”
Jay moved closer to the big screen, narrating like some wannabe host.
“Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Channel Zero. Tonight’s guest—”
The screen twitched. Just a ripple of static, but enough to shut him up.

Lacey frowned.
“Did you see that?”
The TV hissed louder. A low hum filled the room, like power lines vibrating overhead. The cameras’ audio bars spiked though no one spoke.
Then—a shadow flickered in the static.
A man’s outline. Crisp suit. Broad shoulders. Standing just behind the snow.
Connor scoffed. “Okay, cool effect. Who’s doing that?”
No one answered. Jay edged closer.
“Mr. Static? You here to do an interview?”
The screen buzzed sharply, like a mic too close to a speaker. The shadow shifted. A hand, long-fingered, pale, pressed against the inside of the glass.

The audio in the room warped, and then we heard it—
A voice. Stuttering, broken, like an old 1950s broadcast played on a chewed-up tape:
“G-g-g—good… ev—ening… f-f-f-folks…”
We froze.
The hand pushed farther. Fingers slid out of the screen, coated in static sparks. Another hand followed, clawing its way into our world. The cameras whined, their lenses glitching.
“…you’re… live… with… Th-Th-Th… Theodore… Hoost…”
His head emerged—slicked hair, face glitching between smiles and open-mouthed screams in single frames. His suit shimmered, clean one second, burned the next.
Jay whispered, “Holy shit…”
Connor raised his camera, shaking.
“Look at this! Look at—”
“…not… Mr. Static…” the voice crackled.
“…not… that… name…”
Connor laughed nervously. “What are you gonna do, huh? Kill me through the—”
“…don’t… call… me… that…”

Connor stepped closer, trying to sound tough, like we weren’t all terrified.
“You’re just some old story, man. You’re a criminal. A fraud. You’re a terrible host.”
Everything stopped.
The hum died. The static froze mid-flicker.
Then Theodore moved—fast, impossible-fast—lunging from the screen fully into the room, his body flickering like frames skipping. His hand clamped onto Connor’s shoulder.
Connor screamed, dropping his camera, which spun on the floor and caught it all:
• Theodore’s dress shoes scraping the tiles.
• Connor kicking wildly, heels knocking over tripods.
• Theodore’s face inches from his, voice stuttering and layering like overlapping tapes:
“I… WAS… THEODORE… H-H-HOOST…”
“…NOT… MR. STATIC… NOT… TERRIBLE… HOST…”
Connor shrieked, “Let me go!” but his voice drowned in white noise.
The TV behind them blared pure static, growing brighter, brighter, until it was the only light in the room. Then a sickening snap—his jaw—Connor’s eyes rolled back, pupils crawling with static. His body jerked and went still, hanging in Theodore’s grip like a puppet before crumpling to the floor.

Jay and Lacey bolted. I couldn’t move. I just kept filming, shaking, breathing hard.
Theodore turned toward me. His eyes—rolling bars of static—locked on mine. He tilted his head.
“…say… my… name…”
I choked out, “T… Theodore Hoost…”
He twitched. His whole frame jittered like bad reception.
Then—he smiled. A sad, broken smile.
“…thank… you…”
He stepped back into the TV like wading into water, one flickering frame at a time. The static died. The room went dark.

Jay and Lacey made it out of the building. They didn’t make it far.
Jay’s car radio turned to white noise on the drive home. Lacey’s apartment lights flickered until midnight.
I heard the news the next day:
• Jay was found slumped over his steering wheel, mouth twisted, eyes static-white.
• Lacey was discovered in her living room, TV on static, neck broken, toes barely brushing the carpet.
I’m the only one left.

I haven’t slept. Every screen in my apartment is unplugged, every cable cut.
But at night, I still hear it—a faint, warbling voice through the dark:
“G-g-g-good… evening… folks…”
“…say… my… name…”
I whisper it back every night.
Theodore Hoost.
Because I know if I ever call him anything else…
he’ll step through my screen, and I’ll end up just like Connor, like Jay, like Lacey.
And the last thing anyone will hear is the sound of applause and a screen filling with static.
