I was happy at one point in my life casually browsing Reddit and posting to a few subs, one day took my by surprise I had received a message from someone regarding my post and they had a similar experience, so we began talking, Days led into months and so on.

About 6 months in I was really digging this girl, Stacy seemed like a really cool down to earth person at first, we had similar interests and everything we talked about seemed to be online with each other's thoughts, it was a great time.

After another 6 months Stacy messaged me and asked if I'd be willing to meet her in person I was shocked at first, a girl asking my lonely ass to meet, I thought there's something not right about it but I put it to the back of my mind because I was so desperately lonely I decided to throw caution to the wind.

We had shared pics and had a few video calls at this point and she was definitely my type of girl, so we decided to meet at a local coffee shop, I won't lie I was incredibly nervous but also excited to finally meet the girl of my dreams.

It hit about 13:05 when the door to the coffee shop opened and there she stood but there was a big change in her appearance, dressed in all black gothic style clothing, her hair sat gracefully on her shoulders and listened in the light, as she swept a hand through her hair, her face became clearer, a little bit of black eyeliner and lipstick with the same piercings I'd seen before, now this appearance to some is off putting but I honestly thought she was beautiful.

She walked through the shop turning a few heads to say the least, partly judgemental and partly in awe, because she rocked the look, she sat down and I asked her what she wanted, a hot chocolate with cream and marshmallows with all the trimming, I ordered her drink and we sat and began talking.

We talked for hours, I mean hours, all the way up until the shop had to usher us out the door, we both left laughing and then she turned to me and said I want you to stay at mine tonight, now usually I'd be a little wary of this situation but all caution being thrown to the wind I decided to say yes.

I couldn't help but think about how lucky I was, random beautiful goth girl taking me of all people back to her place, I was over excited about this situation, after a little walk, we stood outside her place and she stopped me before walking inside.

She smiled at me and said "My place is a little odd compared to most places, so please don't be shocked" I said "You haven't scared me off yet" thinking back to certain topics of conversations that should have been a big red flag, I let them flicker through my mind without processing them properly.

She opened the door and this place was off the chain, she had animal skulls, human skulls and various other occult items all over the place, the walls were painted black and there was a large pentagram on the floor but none of this really bothered me, it should have but it didn't at all, I walked inside and just said "wow  this place looks amazing"

She brushed past my arm and I could see the smile on her face, as she walked towards the sofa and patted it lightly with her hand, which disarmed any bad thoughts I had about her and for further hours we sat and talked, not one of us even looked at our phones, which I thought was great, especially in this day and age.

After a little bit she offered me a drink and something to eat, I gratefully accepted the meal and drink without a second thought, I honestly was beginning to fall hard for this amazing girl who only a year ago was a simple message in my DMs.

After finishing what was an amazing meal, she sat there just staring at me, "Do you love me?" She asked, I pondered the response for a few minutes and it just came out "Yes". She smiled and a grin struck her face in a different almost evil way "Good" and that's when it happened I became instantly sleepy to the point I realised I'd been drugged with something, I stood up to leave and as I did I fell to the ground hard, crashing into her coffee table and rolling over to see her stood over me, I passed out.

When I finally woke, my hands and were bound and I was sat there naked, I could see my clothing piled up,folded neatly to one side and Stacy sat in a chair in front of what I can only say was some sort of vigil, I called out "Stacy! What the hell is going on!" Only her head turned and with an almost devilish grin "You are mine now, you said it yourself, 'You love me and I, I love you"

I tried to free my hands but she had actually done a good job on making sure that I couldn't. It was at that point she stood up and began singing to me, I couldn't tell you the song but it mesmerized me until about half way through she began ripping her clothes off, as she stood there naked she wretched forwards and backwards still singing until her hands became sort of like eagle claws and her back split open to reveal wings, her teeth grew to fangs and a little blood trickled down from where they split her lip.

She suddenly stopped and stared at me, she began moving closer but slowly at this point the full panic of what was happening set in, stupidly I wasted my energy trying to get out of the makeshift restraints, I felt her claw snip my hands free, I fell forwards and quickly turned around "What are you!?" She smiled and simply said "I am a siren and you said you love me so now I'm going to make you stay with me forever"

As she spoke I managed to get the restraints off my ankles, I started darting around in full flight mode trying to figure a way out of there to no avail, I began to think about giving up each turn I took she was standing right there, waiting for me to embrace her, I didn't know what else to do at this point, I decided to just give up, I walked over to her and she extended her arms out quickly grabbing me and pulling me in, her teeth felt cold as she rested her head against me.

"Oh it's true, it's true, you do love me" she whispered, I asked her what would happen now, she said nothing and we just embraced each other for a while as the day grew darker, I asked her if it was ok if I just went to the shop, she said "I'm not kidnapping you, you can do as you please as long as you return" she laughed "I will my love" I laughed back with a crooked grin.

As I walked down the stairs I almost broke down, the sight of her after the transformation  in reality was horrific to me, the sounds of her bones crunching and redeveloping and the sound of her skin ripping open, the way her jaw disconnected almost like a snakes but each thing you could hear the bones grinding and clicking together.

As the fresh air hit me I felt relieved the panic had subsided and the adrenaline had worn off, now I thought what do I do, do I run or should I return. I ran, that day I ran and I haven't stopped, I'm still looking over my should even now, she's still out there but I didn't think going to the police would help, the story was so far fetched I mean she did drug me so what if it was a hallucinogenic or something, the police would never help regardless.

If I'm still here in a few weeks, I'll post again but hopefully she'll never find me, posting this here may cause her to find me I'm not sure, but I'll post if I can.
