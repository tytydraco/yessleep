It started at a thrift store. The moment I put the jacket on, I knew I couldn’t take it off. Even now, it feels like it’s tightening around me. Maybe someone can help me? Maybe one of you can explain what this is? It hugged my torso like cling wrap — suffocating, yet oddly calming. It feels heavy. I feel heavy. Like drowning. I feel warm. Peaceful. Painless. *What the fuck am I saying—* 

So when I first put it on, the lady who owns the thrift store was staring at me. Her eyes locked on me. “Cool jacket,” she said, her voice carried over the empty thrift store. And I agreed with her, I wish I hadn’t but I felt drawn to the jacket.

I turned and admired myself in the mirror. It’s big on me, green and slightly puffed military jacket, scuffed in all the right places. “I look cute as shit in this, Brad is going to go crazy.” I thought. It smelled. Cigars and something sharp... booze, I thought. Scotch maybe... I sniffed the sleeve and I remember thinking “Didn’t they wash this?” 

And then it was like… Time *slooooooowwwwweeed...*

“Yeah... this was made for me, ” I thought.  “That was made for you.” The owner's voice cut through and that snapped me out of it. 

And I realized at that moment that I hadn’t really been aware of what had just happened or that time felt infinite. I just knew that I had a thought and she had said it out loud and it felt weird. I stared at her and an awkward silence stretched between us. She smiled, like she was proud of me and I said 

“Did you just say that? Or did I say that out loud?” 

She kept staring, her expression didn’t change. “That it was made for you?” she said. “It’s a saying.” she explained “It was made for you. Like, it looks so good on you it must be made for you.” And I realized I sounded crazy. “Yeah. Yeah I know. I know the saying” I said. She chuckled like I was silly. She laughed, and I laughed along, I was just trying to deflect the tension. We ended up laughing together, but it was  uncomfortable.

So I asked how much the jacket was, bought it, and left. But as I was leaving… she kept smiling. The same exact smile she had when she was staring at me before. It didn’t move. Didn’t change. Like her face was stuck. I kept looking back at her as I pushed the door open. She was still smiling when I walked out. 

Later at home Brad and I had Sweet Home Alabama on — he had never seen it. I realized Brad kind of looked like Josh Lucas.  Brad — “You think I look like him?”  I sat up and said “That’s so weird”. “What is?” He asked. Then I explained what happened earlier that day. That the lady from the thrift store basically said out loud what I had thought at the same time. I could tell Brad wasn’t really following.  And I explained “Like just now I thought you look like the actor in this. And then you asked me if you looked like him as I thought it”.  Brad made a good point, which is that he does look like him, so it’s not that weird.  But something felt wrong, he was just staring at me and I don’t know if it was me overthinking—

*Shit—* I think the jacket just got a little tighter. Brad was sleeping next to me last night and he isn’t here now. I tried calling him— I’m just gonna to get to he point—

So later that night, last night, after Brad said the thing about looking like Josh Lucas, I wanted to move past it, so I leaned in and kissed him. Which Brad is not hard to turn on, so he kissed me back and we went up to my room. We kept making out on my bed and I told him I had a surprise for him.  He became *very* curious. I hopped off the bed and told him to close his eyes “Hands over your eyes, please.” I said. 

I went into my closet and slipped on the jacket. I felt good in it. It was like a warm, heavy, blanket. I sauntered to the foot of the bed. I remember thinking I liked the power I have over him “You can open ‘em”.  Brad’s eyes opened. “Huh...it’s uh, not exactly what I was expecting. But you do look great in it.” He said. I crawled onto the bed quickly, like a lioness after her prey. I pinned him down. I put my mouth to his. We kissed, we were making out and it felt like I wasn’t exactly in my body, or like I was in another place, weightless, like I was in space, floating, it’s hard to explain the feeling fully.

Then suddenly I yelled “Get off me fruit-bitch!” The words flew out of my mouth right before I punched Brad in the cheek.  His mouth was hanging open. Shocked. I jumped off the bed, realizing what I had done but not understanding why.  I apologized. I was shocked.  “Did you call me fruit-bitch?” He asked. I stood there, frozen, terrified. He stayed still, very confused.

Then **BLACK.** 

My room was drenched in sudden darkness. It was like I was looking into the depths of the ocean. “Did the power go out?” I yelled.  I called for Brad. Nothing. Then I heard faint breathing...  Then a long slow exhale. “Brad…?”  The breathing turned to wheezing, almost a moan. “Brad? Who is that?!” 

Then I saw it. The red glow of a lit cigar. I could hear the crackle of the flame chewing up the tobacco as the embers climbed up the body of the cigar.  The red embers shed just enough light for me to make out a face, distorted and ugly. It was awful.  I felt a cold chill all over my body. My skin was crawling and all I could do was say “What do you want from me? What do you want from me?!”—

And the lights were suddenly back on.

Brad was staring at me, dumbfounded. “I want to know why you hit me?” he said. I was at a loss for words. I felt— I feel crazy. He was upset, which made sense. He shook his head and said “whatever” and moved for the door, “call me when you want to talk,”he said.

Then all of a sudden it felt like someone was tickling my brain—the way I imagine a fingernail scratching the inside of my skull would feel like.

“Stop, stop, stop stop!”

My hands flew up to my ears. It sounded like a saw cutting through wood.  Brad ran over took me by the shoulders. I don’t even remember what he said, I couldn’t hear him because the noise in my head was so loud

“STOP!” I screamed and it did.

“Em, what’s happening?” Brad was worried. “I don’t know. I don’t know what’s going on. Help me.”  Then he led me to my bed laid me down and did what he could to comfort me. I closed my eyes. I started taking deep breaths in and out, in and out, in and out. 

And then my eyes opened and it was dark. The street lights from outside illuminated my room just enough for me to see. I must’ve fallen asleep. Brad’s arm was draped around me. I grabbed my phone to check the time. It was 3:15 AM.  I couldn’t make sense of everything that had happened. Was I drugged, did I eat something bad? It’s so fucking scary and weird. I had to pee, right? I scanned my room, looking for the red glow of a cigar. 

I noticed my closet was open a slit. My anxiety was still spiking but I had to pee so bad so screw it. I worked up the courage and headed for the bathroom.  Inside the bathroom, I washed my hands and I caught a whiff of something, like sulfur. It was pungent. Putrid. It smelled like rotting meat. I smelled the water — that wasn’t it. I glanced up and saw a reflection in the mirror. 

It was a man, he was old, bald, his body riddled with gooey sores. I can only describe what he looked like as decomposing.I screamed but no sound came out. I was shaking. I still am. I don’t know if it’s because the jacket just got tighter again or the fucking terrifying memory.But I couldn’t move. I was frozen. It felt like I didn’t have a choice, like I was being forced to look at him. The Old Man stared at me through the mirror and opened his mouth to speak and smoke floated out. His teeth were jagged and stained yellow brown— “I want your meat sack.” He whispered to me. He reached out and his gnarled bloated hand grabbed me— 

That’s when I woke up. In bed. Soaked in my own sweat.The morning light flooding my room.Beads of sweat on my forehead. I had to catch my breath.

Jesus Christ, it was just a nightmare, I told myself.

But then the jacket was on me. I don’t remember putting it back on. Why is it back on? And that’s when I turned to look for Brad and he wasn’t there. I called him. Straight to voicemail. 

Oh my god! I just had a sharp pain on my arm, pulled up my sleeve and there’s a gooey rotting sore on it, like the Old Man’s! I don’t know what to do.

I just dialed 911 and my phone connected to the thrift store instead! The lady who owns it picked up and said, “Hello Dear, how’s the jacket fitting”.

I hung up and called 911 again and called the thrift store again! Someone help me!

The jacket just got tighter around me. It’s hugging me. Someone please—

It feels heavy. I feel heavy. Like drowning. I feel warm.

Peaceful. 

Painless. 

Sleeeeeeeeeeeee—
