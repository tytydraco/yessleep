I used to love silence.

Real silence is rare. Most people don’t notice the background noise — refrigerator hum, air conditioning, distant traffic. But I do. I have to. I’m a freelance audio engineer. I build sound the way some people build furniture: slowly, precisely, obsessed with balance and structure.

My studio is the quietest place I know. Double-insulated walls. Floating floors. Acoustic foam dense enough to kill the echo of a whisper. It’s where I’ve spent most of the past ten years. Mixing, mastering, isolating. Listening.

Lately, though, I’ve stopped trusting what I hear.

It started about six weeks ago. I’d been sleeping poorly — up till 3 or 4 most nights, not from stress exactly, but from this weird edge of alertness. I’d lie in bed and *wait* for something. No idea what. My doctor called it “hypervigilant insomnia,” whatever that means. I called it annoying.

During one of those sleepless stretches, I decided to knock out some backlog. A podcast client had sent over three raw episodes of interviews for cleanup. True crime stuff. Badly recorded but decent content. I figured I’d get ahead before sunrise.

I was halfway through the second episode when I noticed something.

A click.

Not from the speakers or headphones. Not in the room. *In the track.*

I thought it was a mic bump at first. Common enough — elbow hits the boom arm, client doesn’t notice. But this was different. It didn’t sound like impact. It was more like… tapping. Fast and faint. Five quick ticks. Then silence.

I zoomed in. Nothing visible. No spike in the waveform, no digital artifact. I isolated the channel and soloed it. Played it back a few times. Still there. Still soft. But too structured to be random. I checked the room tone from the file. The click wasn’t present anywhere else.

So I shrugged it off. Probably my ears playing tricks after too little sleep.

But it came back.

Three days later, on a completely different episode, I heard it again.

Same pattern. Five taps. Then silence.

This time I turned everything off. Power strip, monitors, even my interface. Still heard it. Faintly, like a phantom limb of sound. Just in memory. But it stuck with me, enough that I jotted it down in a notebook:  
**“3:14 a.m. — 5 taps — right channel only.”**

That notebook would fill up fast.

Within two weeks, the sounds became a regular part of my night.

Sometimes it was clicks. Sometimes short, breathy hisses. Not quite static, not human either. A few times, I thought I heard something like *whispers* — but too low to understand. I ran noise reduction filters, EQ isolations, reverb splits. Nothing made sense. No plugin could explain it.

At first, I assumed I was dealing with interference. Maybe a neighbor’s Wi-Fi bleeding into the signal chain. But the more I listened, the more convinced I became…

These sounds weren’t interference.  
They were *intentional*.

I started keeping backups. Labeled the files in code so I wouldn’t confuse them with client work. Played them at half-speed. Reversed them. Ran them through a spectral analyzer. One night, I froze at what I saw.

The waveform had symmetry. *Actual mirrored symmetry.* Natural audio doesn’t do that. Not unless it’s been programmed. But this wasn’t computer-generated either. It was messy. Organic. Wrong.

That’s when I noticed it breathing.

Not me. Not the mic. The **track**.

It rose and fell like lungs. Inhale. Exhale. Over and over. Sometimes syncing with me. Sometimes not. And once… once I swear I heard it mimic my own breath — just a half-second behind.

I stopped submitting client work. I told them I had COVID. One of them offered to send soup. I thanked them and didn’t reply again.

I started sleeping in the living room. Couldn't bring myself to enter the studio at night anymore. But I kept listening. Headphones only. Volume low. Watching that waveform breathe, tap, *wait*.

It was waiting.

Last week, everything changed.

I was working on a test mix, just trying to distract myself. I left my headphones on the interface and stepped away for a moment. When I came back, the screen had glitched — all tracks muted but one. My studio mic.

I wasn’t recording. No signal was supposed to be live.

But there it was.

Sound.

Clearer than anything I’d heard yet.

It wasn’t clicks anymore. It was slithering. Wet, dragging textures, like something crawling across tile. I leaned closer, heart pounding. And then I heard breathing. Not mine. Not human. Something guttural, rattling. It was right *next* to the mic.

I didn’t move. My eyes were locked on the levels.

And then I heard my name.

Spoken in my own voice. Or something trying to *use* my voice. The pitch was wrong. Like a field recording of someone trying to speak underwater.

I took off the headphones.

Silence.

No hum. No room tone. Not even the faint buzz of my monitors. My studio was never that silent. Not ever.

And I realized something was behind me.

I didn’t turn around. I just walked. Slowly. Left the studio door open behind me and didn’t go back.

It’s been six days. I haven’t touched a pair of headphones since.

I tried uploading one of the files — just to see if anyone else could hear it — but Reddit flagged it, and when I tried to convert it, the file corrupted. I don’t know if that was coincidence. Or if it didn’t *want* to be heard.

Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I still hear those five taps.  
Not in my ears.  
Inside my chest.  
Like something knocking from deep inside my own body, waiting for me to press record again.
