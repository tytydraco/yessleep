I don’t want to go to Grandma and Grandpa’s apartment. Ever.
It’s not just the smoke, even though that’s bad—thick, yellowish, and choking. Grandpa’s cigarettes stink like something burning slow and wrong. The smell never leaves. It’s in the couch. The carpet. The curtains. Your hair. Your clothes. Your skin.
But that’s not why I hate it.

It’s the silence.

 The darkness.

 The hallway.

Even when I was little, I could feel it. The apartment… knows things. It holds its breath when you walk in. Like it’s waiting. I don’t know what for.
I never see anything. Nothing jumps out. No monsters in the closet.

But it’s there.

Something is always there.
Grandpa never leaves his bedroom. I don’t even know if he’s still alive sometimes. Maybe he just sank into the mattress one day and nobody noticed.
I only ever go between the kitchen and the living room. But to get from one to the other, you have to pass through the hallway.

That hallway.

It’s always dark. Not “turned off” dark. Not “nightlight” dark. Dead dark. The lightbulb overhead has been broken for years. No one changes it. No one even tries.
The walls are this pale, peeling beige that makes me feel sick. Like old bones or something scraped clean. When I walk down it, the air gets thicker. My breath feels like it’s being chewed up. My skin turns clammy. My heart bangs in my ears. I hold my breath, even though I know that won’t help.
That night starts like so many others.
We’re outside. Barefoot on the pavement. The neighbors are watching from behind curtains.

My dad is screaming.

My brothers are screaming back.

My mom is crying, grabbing, trying to keep us from tearing apart.

I just stand there. Twelve years old. Too small. Too quiet.

“You think I wanted this life?” my dad shouts. “He’s nothing but a leech!”
“He’s your son!” my mom screams. “Maybe he gave up because of you!”
“You treat us like garbage,” my brother says. “You wonder why we act like it?”

I’m the only one Dad had with Mom. The others came before. But I never thought of them as half-anything. They’re mine. All of them.
When Dad starts swinging, I know what to do.
I wrap my hands around his arm. “Daddy, please,” I whisper. “Let’s go. Please.”

He freezes.
Then he shoves everyone back.
“I’m going to my mother’s.”
That’s supposed to be good. It usually means quiet. 

A break.

But then the car pulls up.
“Come on, sweetheart. Let’s go.”
I blink. “What?”
“Now.”
He grabs me. I don’t move fast enough. My mom grabs my other arm. My brothers are yelling. Everyone’s pulling me at once.
It feels like my arms are going to rip off.
I can’t breathe.
I can’t scream.
Then—he yanks me free.
I slam into the car door. There’s a crack, like something snapping inside me.
I cry. I hold my nose.
It hurts.
“Why are you holding your nose?” he says.
“It hurts,” I whisper. “It hurts so much.”
He turns on the dome light and stares at me like he’s seeing me for the first time, my nose huge and purple.
“Jesus… I didn’t mean to. Grandma’ll fix it, okay?”
I nod. I don’t believe him.
We drive in silence. I fall asleep.
I wake up on the couch. Everything smells like smoke and something else—wet and old, like the inside of a locked basement.
Grandma stands over me. “I put something on your nose,” she says. “Here. Eat these.”
She hands me a small bag of chips. I take it but don’t eat.
My dad’s outside, smoking again. I hear his cough—deep and rattling, like it’s crawling up from his bones.
When he comes back, he smiles like none of it happened.
“Let’s go to bed. Tomorrow we’ll go to IHOP. Just you and me. Strawberry pancakes.”
That sounds nice. We don’t go out much since there’s a lot of us.
We lie on the couch. He takes the side near the door. I take the side facing the hallway.
The lights are off.
The hallway feels different tonight. Like it’s breathing.

I shut my eyes.

CREEEEEEAK.

I open them. Moonlight slices across the floor like silver knives.
Everything’s still.
Dad is snoring softly.
I close my eyes again.

CREEEEEEAK.

I open them.
She’s there.
At the far end of the hallway. 

A woman.

She’s standing completely still.
Her hair is long and black and dripping wet, hanging down like seaweed. It sticks to her face so I can’t see her eyes. Her dress is white at the top, dark and ragged near the bottom like it’s been dragged through the dirt.
Her skin is pale. Almost bluish. Like something pulled from a lake.
Her arms dangle at her sides. Her fingers are too long. They don't move.
 She doesn’t blink.
 She doesn’t breathe.
She knows I see her.

“Daddy,” I whisper, barely touching him. “There’s someone in the hallway.”
He sits up, looks.
Nothing.
“There’s nothing there, sweetheart. Go to sleep.”
I turn back.
She’s still there.
She hasn’t moved.
But I know she’s closer.
My whole body goes cold. My teeth chatter. I shut my eyes tight.
And then—I hear it.

Crying.

Not mine.
Hers.
A soft, broken sob. Like someone trying not to be heard. But it gets louder. And louder. And louder.

Closer.

I feel her before I hear her steps. The room bends around her. The air thickens, like she’s pulling everything into her.
I don’t want to turn.
But I do.
The crying stops.
She’s back in the hallway.
Exactly where she was.
But now I know she moved.
She’s playing with me.
I stare at her.
I try not to blink.

I blink.

The crying starts again.
This time, she’s halfway down the hall.
Closer.
I feel her breath on the back of my neck.
It smells like wet dirt and rot and something else… something that used to be alive.
I turn.
She’s at the end of the hallway again.
But I know she’s not really there.
She’s everywhere.
I don’t move.
I don’t sleep.
I just watch.
She stays until the sun rises.
When the light touches the floor, she fades into the shadows like smoke melting into water.
Dad wakes up hours later. Smiling.
“You ready for pancakes?”
I nod. We get in the car, “I don’t want to sleep at Grandma’s anymore.”
“Why not?”
“I just don’t.”
