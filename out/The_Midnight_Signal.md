# The Midnight Signal

It was a small, nondescript town, nestled in a valley where the mountains cradled its residents in their shadows. Life moved slowly here; news from the outside world was a distant echo. People went about their daily routines, trusting the rhythm of their lives to the tick of the clock and the turning of the seasons. That is, until the broadcasts began.

It started on a warm summer evening. The old TV in the living room flickered, crackling with static. At first, it was dismissed as a glitch—just another quirk of living in a place where technology lagged behind. But then, the static gave way to a low, droning hum, almost imperceptible at first, but growing steadily louder. The screen resolved into a grainy, black-and-white image.

It was a face. Distorted and barely recognizable, but unmistakably human. Its eyes were hollow pits of darkness, and its mouth moved slowly, forming words that were lost to the droning noise. The face stared directly into the camera, as if it could see through the screen and into the living rooms of everyone watching. Then, just as suddenly as it had appeared, the image cut out, replaced once more by the regular evening news.

People talked about the strange occurrence the next day, but the memory of it faded quickly in the light of day. Until it happened again. And again. Each night, the same face appeared, its hollow eyes piercing through the static. The hum grew louder, more insistent, and a voice began to emerge from the noise—a whisper at first, then clearer, though the words were garbled and impossible to understand.

The townspeople grew restless. Some stopped watching TV altogether, but it didn't help. The face found its way into their dreams, into their thoughts, always watching, always whispering. Radios picked up the signal too, a constant droning hum that no amount of tuning could erase.

It was Mrs. Caldwell, the town's librarian, who first deciphered the message. She had always been good with puzzles, and this was no different. Late one night, with the hum resonating through her old transistor radio, she heard the words clearly for the first time: "Join us in the dark. Join us where the shadows lie."

The next morning, Mrs. Caldwell was gone. Her house was undisturbed, her belongings untouched, but she was nowhere to be found. Panic began to spread through the town. More people vanished, each one leaving behind the same clue—a hastily scribbled note, repeating the same phrase: "Join us in the dark."

Sheriff Thompson tried to keep order, but even he couldn't shake the feeling of dread that had settled over the town. One by one, the townspeople disappeared, drawn by the irresistible pull of the midnight signal. Homes were left empty, streets silent, until only a handful of residents remained.

Sheriff Thompson was among the last. Determined to understand what was happening, he set up a camera in his living room, hoping to capture the source of the broadcast. That night, the face appeared again, its eyes boring into the lens of the camera. The hum was louder than ever, a deafening roar that seemed to vibrate through his very bones.

"Join us in the dark," the voice intoned, clear and commanding.

The camera recorded everything—the face, the hum, the voice. But as the signal grew stronger, Sheriff Thompson felt an overwhelming compulsion to obey. The camera fell to the floor, recording only the empty room as he walked out into the night, leaving the town behind.

The tape was found months later by a group of hikers passing through the deserted town. They took it to the nearest city, where it quickly became an object of fascination. Experts analyzed it, but no one could explain the phenomenon. The face, the hum, the command to join in the dark—it remained a mystery.

But the signal wasn't confined to the small town anymore. It had spread, traveling through the airwaves, reaching into homes and minds far beyond the valley. And as it did, people everywhere began to disappear, drawn into the darkness by the irresistible call of the midnight signal.

The world was left to wonder, to fear, and to wait. For the face in the static, for the hum that grew louder with each passing night, for the whispered words that promised only one thing: the darkness was coming for them all.
