We’ve been married for almost fifteen years now. Or is it thirteen? Maria would be upset if she knew I couldn’t remember.

I usually stay up an hour later than her. She goes through her whole routine: washing her face, laying out clothes, the things women do, all while I read on the living room chair.

We keep the lights off except for a small clip-on lamp I bought on Amazon. It’s enough to read by. 

Barely enough to see anything else.

We live in a small town. The kind where the silence is heavy enough to hear your own breathing.

So the first time I heard her talking, it annoyed me more than it scared me.

It was maybe two weeks ago. A half-conversation muffled through the bedroom door. 

Words I couldn't quite make out, then silence, then more words. Like she was on the phone.

"You talking to me?" I called out.

Nothing. She just stopped.

Probably her sister, I figured. They talk constantly, about nothing. Though it was late for that. I let it slide.

The next night, same thing. Except this time it was lower. A whisper. I tilted my head toward the bedroom, straining to hear, but I couldn't make out the words. Just the rhythm.

*Question. Pause. Answer.* *Question. Pause. Answer.*

"Babe, did you call me?"

"What? No." Blunt. Annoyed.

It occurred to me later—she must be praying. I’ve been openly agnostic since we met, but things have been hard lately. People turn to fairy tales when life gets difficult.

And life *had* gotten difficult.

I lost my job three months ago. The photo printing shop downtown—outdated business model, incompetent management. 

My boss was an idiot who didn't recognize what he had in me. 

Maria took it harder than I expected. She’s been to the hospital three times in the past month alone. 

*Fatigue*, she says. 

I told her what any reasonable person would: eat more, drink more water, get some rest. But she insisted on seeing a specialist. Eighty dollars a consultation, and you know what he told her? Eat more.

I didn't say "I told you so." I’m not that kind of husband.

But the visits kept happening. And the pills started. Vitamins, supplements, something for anxiety—I stopped keeping track. I told her the caffeine was probably making things worse, but she just looked at me with those wide, glassy eyes.

The praying continued. Got longer. Louder.

One night I heard her laugh. Soft. It wasn't a happy sound. It sounded like something snapping.

Another night, I heard her crying during one of the conversations. Then the crying stopped abruptly, mid-sob, and she said *"Yes"* very clearly. 

Then nothing.

During the day, Maria started watching me. 

I’d be on the couch, job listings open on my laptop—though nothing in this town pays what I'm worth—and I’d feel it. 

I’d look up and she’d be standing in the kitchen doorway.

Just staring. Head tilted slightly.

"What's wrong?" I'd ask.

She wouldn't answer. She wouldn't even blink. She’d just turn and walk away, her bare feet silent on the floorboards.

Then, two nights ago.

I was in my chair, lamp on, listening. 

The whispering had been going for twenty minutes. It was different. Faster. More urgent. 

I heard my name (I’m almost sure I heard my name) and then: *Silence*.

Then laughter. Not Maria’s. Deeper. It sounded like rocks grinding together inside a throat.

I sat frozen, telling myself I’d imagined it. The mind plays tricks when you’re tired. When your wife is sick and your savings are draining and nothing is going the way it should.

I slept on the couch that night. I told myself it was because I didn't want to wake her.

We barely spoke anymore, and when we did, it was sharp. Transactional.

Last night.

I was reading. Or pretending to.

**BANG. BANG. BANG.**

Three hits. Hard. Deliberate. From the bedroom.

I launched out of my chair, heart slamming against my ribs. The bedroom door was closed—it was always closed now.

I stood motionless for what it felt like an hour.

*"Are you okay?"* I finally asked, my voice came out cracked.

Silence.

*"Maria?"*

And then I heard it. Not her voice. Something wearing her voice.

***"She sleeps now."***

It came from everywhere. The walls. The floor. Inside my own skull.

My chest seized. I watched the air under the door disturb the dust. I smelled it then, rotten meat? I dismissed the scent because of how scared I was.

I don't know how long I stood there. Eventually, my legs started moving. Each step felt impossibly loud. The door handle was cold. Colder than ice. It burned my palm.

I opened the door.

The moonlight was bright—bright enough to see everything. I wish it hadn’t been.

Maria was on the bed. Half on it. Her legs were still tangled in the sheets, but her torso hung backward off the edge, spine bent at an angle that shouldn't be possible. Her head was nearly touching the floor.

Her arms were stretched out, rigid.

Her eyes were open. Her mouth was open.

**She was smiling.**

I slammed the door and ran. I panicked. I ran toward the living room, toward my chair, toward the light.

But the lamp was off. I don't remember turning it off.

Everything is dark now. The kind of dark where you feel heavy. I’m using my phone to type this. 

Six percent battery.

A moment ago I held the screen up toward the hallway.

There were no eyes. No monster. Just a shape. A silhouette standing in the hallway, impossibly tall. Its head was scraping the ceiling.

It wasn't walking. It was *unfolding.*

I dropped the phone. When I raised it again, the hall was empty.

But I can hear breathing now. Not mine. And Maria’s voice, right against my ear, wet and hot, even though nothing is there:

***"They say you'll do nicely"***

Four percent.
