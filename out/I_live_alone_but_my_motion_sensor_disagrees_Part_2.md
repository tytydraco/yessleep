I don’t remember consciously deciding to leave the apartment. The next thing I knew, I was in the hallway outside my door, breathing hard, still clutching the phone with that damned image on the screen. I’d grabbed my keys and slipped my feet into the untied sneakers by the door out of some automatic survival impulse.

It was only after the heavy fire door closed behind me, locking me out of my own unit, that I paused to think. The corridor was empty and quiet, lit by dim sconces. It was nearly 3:30 a.m. by now. Where could I go? I couldn’t exactly bang on a neighbor’s door. I felt a pang of embarrassment even considering it – “Hi, I’m your new neighbor, I’m convinced an invisible something is in my apartment, can I crash on your couch?” Not happening.

The adrenaline was wearing off, and I sank to sit on the hallway floor, my back against the wall. I needed to think. The logical part of my brain was unraveling, outmatched by the visceral terror I’d just experienced. That image... I looked at it again, wanting to be sure I hadn't imagined it. No, it was there, in grainy black and gray: an elongated blur looming over me.

I realized something else then: the blur’s shape, even though unclear, it reminded me of me. Not just human, but vaguely *similar to my own outline*. The way it stood, the height compared to the chair... Could it have been imitating me sitting there? Or perhaps it was coincidence. My mind was likely in overdrive trying to find patterns. Yet the notion crawled under my skin – was it copying me?

An uncanny memory surfaced: earlier that day I found my bathroom door closed when I swore I left it open. And a few days ago I could have *sworn* I left a kitchen cabinet ajar only to find it shut tight. Little things I’d brushed off. But what if it had been inside, watching me, learning how I lived? My routines, my habits...

I sat in that hallway for a long time, too scared to go back inside, too drained to go anywhere else. In the end, I went down to the lobby. The security guard – Alan – startled when I emerged from the elevator in my disheveled state. I must have looked wild-eyed and pale. I told him a half-truth: that I thought someone had broken in, that I had evidence on camera. He took me seriously then, calling the police immediately.

Two officers arrived within fifteen minutes. I was embarrassed as I led them to my apartment, recounting that I'd gotten motion alerts and saw an intruder on camera. I deliberately didn’t mention invisible figures or any of the more unbelievable details. I just said someone had been inside and I fled.

The police searched my apartment thoroughly. They found no one, of course. What they did find were a few odd signs that made them radio for a crime scene unit: The chain on the door had been ripped clean off – the screws tore out of the wood as if forced from inside. I hadn’t even noticed that in my panicked exit. One officer asked if I had done that; I stammered no, it was latched and I had to undo it to leave, so I had no idea how it got pulled out. He frowned as though I was lying or confused.

Also, my laptop was smashed on the floor – the entire screen shattered as if something very heavy had stomped on it. Bits of glass and plastic strewn about. That definitely hadn’t happened when I left; I remember just the phone falling. The rest of the living room was disheveled too: the coffee table was knocked over, the book and wine glass on the floor (wine soaked into the rug like blood), the floor lamp toppled. It looked like a struggle had taken place.

I could see the cops exchanging looks. I knew what it looked like – like a fight or some rampage had occurred. “Maybe you interrupted a burglary,” one officer suggested kindly. “Though it’s odd – nothing appears stolen.” My TV, laptop, other electronics were still present (if broken).

I mumbled something about how maybe they ran when I screamed. I couldn't bring myself to contradict with the fact that the intruder, if it existed, had not entered through the door or windows at all.

I did show them the photo captured by my security app. They examined it with perplexity. To my relief, they didn’t dismiss it outright. It did show *something*. One of them asked if I had a robe or coat hanging there (which could look like a person). I pointed to the coat rack which was across the room, not behind the chair. They had to admit the image did look like a person, even if blurry. “Could be a malfunction,” one said, but not in a convincing tone.

They took a copy of the image and my statement, advising me to stay somewhere else for the rest of the night and get that door chain fixed. They were polite, but I could tell they didn’t know what to do with this. No sign of forced entry (from outside at least), no suspect, just my story and a weird picture.

After they left, I packed a quick overnight bag and took the most important things (laptop was useless now, but phone and charger, wallet, a change of clothes). I wasn't staying here either way. As I was about to exit, I hesitated, a gnawing feeling drawing me back in. I realized I wanted one thing – the little thermal camera attachment under the coffee table. The cops had missed it. I snatched it up and pocketed it.

I spent the rest of the night at a 24-hour diner, then dozed in my car as morning slowly brightened the sky. I must have looked like a wreck—unshaven, eyes bloodshot, jumping at every little sound.

By daylight, with people bustling around on the streets, things felt slightly more normal. I told myself maybe this whatever-it-was would be gone now. Maybe it only haunted me at 3:17 a.m. specifically, like some bizarre temporal fluke. Part of me even wondered if I had a peculiar sleep disorder or stress-induced delusion—except I had physical evidence that something happened. The photo, the broken chain, the wrecked furniture... Those were very real.

I contacted a handyman service and by afternoon had the door chain repaired and a new deadbolt installed, one with an electronic keypad so I could monitor any entries via an app. It sounds crazy, but I needed to feel I could keep *something* out, even if I wasn’t sure what I was barring.

When Brian came by that weekend as promised, I finally confided in him about the full strangeness. I half expected him to laugh or call me nuts, but he grew quiet as I laid out everything. We sat at the kitchen table in the midday sun, the motion sensors still armed (they didn’t trigger in daylight at least). I showed him the thermal device and even re-created how I saw the shape. He kept shaking his head in disbelief.

“You’re sure you weren’t hallucinating? Like, were you fully awake?” he asked gently.

“I was wide awake. And I got this image. Something set off the sensor – multiple times. You saw the living room, Brian. You saw my door.” I gestured to the repaired chain. He couldn’t deny it.

He proposed an experiment: we’d stay up that night together, cameras ready, and see if it appeared when there were two of us. Safety in numbers, maybe. Honestly, I was relieved at the idea. I did not want to face another 3:17 alone.

We passed the evening with takeout and an ironic choice of horror movie to lighten the mood. I was jumpy, and every so often Brian would reassure me with a chuckle, "If Casper shows up, we'll bust him." But I could tell he was uneasy too, despite the bravado.

As the clock crept toward three, we sat in the brightly lit living room with an array of devices: my phone with the thermal camera, his high-end DSLR on a tripod set to record video, and every light on (though I doubted brightness would deter it if it had already come out in the light before). We spoke little as the time approached, an unspoken tension drawing us both taut.

3:10...3:15... We both fell silent, eyes darting between the clocks and the room. The air felt still, heavy like before a storm. I realized I was holding the thermal viewer with sweaty palms, pointing it toward the hallway and kitchen, the direction the shape came from last time.

At 3:17, Brian’s DSLR, set to motion detect as well, emitted a little beep and started recording. He stiffened, looking around. I saw nothing with my eyes. But on my thermal screen—there it was. Emerging just at the edge, near the front door this time, as if it had been right by us all along. A swath of heat, taller now, more defined.

I tried to speak, to tell Brian, but my voice caught in panic. The shape drifted forward, heading not for me this time, but toward Brian. He was looking in the wrong direction, squinting toward the kitchen, and didn't see it.

"Bri—behind you!" I managed to shout.

He whipped around, and for one awful second he and the shape intersected on my thermal view—the orange of his body overlapping with the ghostly orange figure. Brian staggered, as if hit by a wave of dizziness. Later he told me he felt an intense heat at his back that scared him senseless.

He stumbled away, nearly tripping over the coffee table. I saw the shape continue moving, slowly and with what I can only describe as *purpose*. Now it was headed to the armchair, to where I had been sitting the night it attacked.

Without warning, every light in the apartment went out. We were plunged into darkness—except my phone's screen, which glowed with the thermal image. I heard Brian curse, and the scrape of him grabbing something—maybe the flashlight.

The figure on screen turned its head side to side, as if confused or searching. In the sudden dark, I realized, maybe it couldn’t see us clearly. Could it rely on darkness somehow? Or had it killed the lights intentionally?

"Get out!" I hissed at Brian. I fumbled toward him, knocking into the couch. The emergency lighting from the hallway glowed faintly under the door; that was our target. I didn't care about evidence anymore—I wanted to live.

Brian was ahead of me, feeling along the wall. The thermal showed the shape near the center of the room, not rushing, but following. It moved in fits and starts – a jerky motion, almost glitching from point to point. And every few feet, it looked more solid on the camera, as if feeding off something.

We made it to the door. I shoved Brian through first. He fumbled with the handle but thankfully I'd left the new deadbolt unlocked expecting our flight. We burst into the hallway, nearly falling over each other. Behind us, from the dark apartment, I swear I heard a creak of the floor.

We slammed the door. My hands shook violently as I jammed the key into the lock to manually seal the deadbolt. Once it clicked, we backed away, panting.

Brian was pale as death, shining his flashlight at the closed door. "What the hell was that?" he whispered.

I could only shake my head, heart too busy trying to climb into my throat. In my hand, the thermal image still danced on the phone. The figure had moved right up to the inside of my front door. It stood there, as if staring through, a bright splotch against the door’s outline. Then it slowly faded, its heat dispersing until the screen showed just the cooling door.

We didn't stay after that. We retreated to the lobby, where the night security guard looked at us like we were insane. We must have babbled something about a gas leak or electrical problem—I don't even remember. We left, driving to Brian’s place across town at 4 a.m. in silence.

By tacit agreement, we didn't discuss details until daylight. When we finally did, sitting in his kitchen with untouched mugs of coffee, it took me showing him the thermal footage (yes, his DSLR and my phone both had caught glimpses) for him to fully accept it. "I thought I was having a stroke or something when that heat hit me," he admitted, voice trembling. "But... I saw it on your phone. Jesus, it was right behind me."

I told him my theory: it was learning. Each night it got bolder, more defined. And possibly, mimicking me. Now maybe mimicking him too. The way it moved, where it lingered—the armchair, then trying to approach him from behind, like it had done with me. It was copying tactics? Or just curious? Either way, it was intelligent. And perhaps even more disturbing, it was confined to my apartment. When we left, it didn’t chase us out. It stayed, almost like it had claimed that space.

"Maybe it's bound there," Brian suggested. He was grasping for any logic. "Like a ghost haunting a place."

"Or it's bound to me," I said, shuddering. "I mean, it only appears when I'm there. But... if it were bound to me, it would follow, right?"

We debated possibilities in circles, nothing making perfect sense. All I knew was I could not go back there alone. Not tonight, maybe not ever.

Later that day I got a call from the building manager – apparently, the tenant below me had water leaking from their ceiling, and maintenance entered my apartment (with my permission via phone) to find my bathroom faucet running, sink overflowing. I hadn't been in that bathroom at all that night. Thankfully minimal damage, but it was as if someone had turned it on deliberately.

That chilled me. Was the entity messing with things when I wasn't home? Or had it been doing that while I was there and I just hadn’t noticed? Little unexplained things clicked into place: the closed door, the moved items. It had been active beyond just tripping sensors.

I decided then I had to confront this somehow, or permanently break my lease and flee. But if I ran, who knows if it might attach anyway? I needed more information.

Research became my life over the next two days. I contacted the device manufacturer and grilled them, but aside from confirming my logs of motion and the weird image, they had nothing. I scoured paranormal forums (feeling ridiculous, but desperate) for any mention of entities triggered by motion sensors or showing up on thermal. There were stories, plenty of them, but each had their own lore and none quite matched mine.

One idea came from an old thread: using something like a fine powder or flour on the floor to see footprints. It sounded like a movie trick, but I resolved to try if I dared to re-enter the apartment. After all, the thing had clearly physical effects (it moved objects, touched Brian, etc.).

Brian agreed to come with me one last time, in daylight, to gather my important belongings and also set a kind of trap for evidence. He insisted I not stay another night, and I didn’t argue.

We went in the afternoon, bright sun streaming through the windows as we cautiously opened the door. The place felt stale, a slight odor like hot wires or burnt dust. Inside, more things were amiss: my dining chairs were all pulled out from the table, one knocked over. My bookshelf had books strewn on the floor. It looked like a drunken poltergeist had rampaged.

We tiptoed in, calling out a shaky “hello?” as if expecting it to answer. Silence. The sensor was disarmed now (I had left it off after the last event, not wanting alarms without me there).

We worked quickly. I packed clothes, personal documents, my work laptop, essentials. Meanwhile, Brian, both skeptical and fascinated, sprinkled a bag of flour in a wide circle on the living room hardwood floor. We covered a good portion of the floor between the hall and the front door, as well as a patch by the sofa where it often stood. It was messy, but if something stepped there, we’d know.

As we were finishing up, Brian asked me to grab the last of the cameras. I realized I left the small USB security cam plugged in by the entryway (I’d added it hoping to capture more). I went to yank it out of the outlet, and as I did, I felt... odd. A prickling on the back of my neck.

It was 3:15 in the afternoon, broad daylight, but I felt suddenly like it was night again and I was being watched. I froze, then slowly turned. Nothing visible, of course. But the sense of presence was unmistakable.

Brian was across the room, zipping my duffel bag. He looked up at me, noticing my posture. “You okay?”

Before I could answer, we both heard it: a soft *click* from the hallway. The sound of my bedroom door gently closing on its own. We had left it open; I was sure of it.

Brian stared at me, eyes wide. I mustered a whisper: “Time to leave. Now.”

As we made a fast exit, I glanced down at the flour on the floor. Something was happening – a disturbance in the powder. Footprints started to form, one after another, striding toward us. Yet nothing visible made them. They were human-shaped prints, the size of mine perhaps, appearing one by one, the flour indenting under unseen weight.

I wish I could say we stayed to see more, but we didn't. Survival instinct kicked in and we bolted, slamming the door behind us and not stopping until we were outside, breathing the fresh air like escapees from a mine shaft.

That was yesterday. We’re at Brian’s now, camped in his living room like kids afraid of the dark. I don’t know what to do next. The thing in my apartment – it knows we know. And it’s not just some passive haunt; it’s active, intelligent, and intent on... something. On me.

I fear that it has been studying me, adopting my patterns. Those footprints were exactly my shoe size, I realized. It wasn’t just mimicking a human – it was mimicking *this* human. My gait, my shape. The image on the camera looking like me, the way it lingered where I'd been sitting. Piece by piece, it’s learning to become me.

As I write this, using Brian’s laptop, my thoughts keep circling a terrible idea: what if its endgame is to replace me? Could it steal my face, my voice, my life? Maybe it already started. It knew how to unlock my doors, how to move like me in my space. What if that night the door chain was ripped out not because it couldn’t get in, but because it didn’t need doors? Or because it was already inside and I was trying to keep it from leaving, from going out into the world wearing my skin?

I know how crazy this sounds. But I can’t shake the image of those empty footprints stalking toward me in my own home. I can’t unsee that blurred figure standing over my shoulder, as if posing to take my place in that one captured frame.

We’ve decided not to go back. I’ll break my lease, leave most of the furniture, whatever. But deep down, I’m terrified it might not matter. If it can leave that apartment now that it’s taken on my form – where will it go? Will it follow me? Is it already ahead of me somehow, living my life where I’m not?

I haven’t checked the motion alerts since yesterday. I’m too afraid. But just now, as I sit here typing this, my phone buzzed. A notification from the security app – the one I hadn't deleted yet. My blood turned to ice as I read it:

“Front Door opened.”

A second later: “Front Door closed.”

In the app’s log, it shows those events, time-stamped 3:17 a.m. I stared at the notification, a sick realization dawning. I’m not at the apartment. Brian is here next to me, and no one else should be in that unit. But something just opened and closed my front door at the witching minute, as casually as a tenant leaving for a late-night walk.

I don’t know where it’s going at this hour, or if it will come here next. All I know is that I’m shaking as I show Brian the alert. He reads it and we lock eyes. Neither of us says what we’re both thinking:

It’s learned enough to leave.

And if it can leave, it can be anywhere. It could be anyone. It could even be standing right behind me as I finish writing this, watching with unseen eyes as I document our last moments of safety. I’m afraid to turn around.
