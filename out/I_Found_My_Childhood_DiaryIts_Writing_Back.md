I found my childhood diary today. It was buried in a box of old clothes and forgotten toys, tucked away in the attic like it had been waiting for me. The cover was faded pink, the edges curled from time, and my name was still there in glittery gel pen, half rubbed off but unmistakably mine.

I hadn’t seen it in over fifteen years.

Sitting cross-legged on the attic floor, I flipped through the pages, smiling at the messy handwriting, the pointless childhood drama, the secrets I thought were so important back then. It was like reading a letter from a past version of myself—until I reached the last page I remembered writing.

And saw there was more.

A new entry. Written in **someone else’s** handwriting.

*"Hello again, Alice."*

I froze.

The ink looked fresh. The date at the top was today.

My stomach knotted. I flipped back through the previous pages, trying to make sense of it. Maybe I had written it and forgotten? Maybe my mom or a friend had found the diary and thought it’d be funny to mess with me? But no one had been up here. I was sure of it.

Still, I closed the diary and laughed to myself. I was just being ridiculous. It was probably an old note I’d written in a different pen, and my brain was playing tricks on me. I set the book aside and started sorting through the rest of the box.

Then, just to prove to myself how stupid I was being, I flipped the diary open again.

Another new line had appeared.

*"You shouldn’t have done that."*

My breath caught in my throat. I hadn’t imagined it. The ink was still drying.

I stared at the words, heartbeat hammering against my ribs. My hands shook as I turned the page.

*"You remember me, don’t you?"*

I didn’t. But the moment I read the words, something **shifted** in the back of my mind. Like a door unlocking.

Flashes of memory hit me—sitting on my bed, pen in hand, whispering as I wrote in this very book. Asking questions. Waiting for responses. I remembered… something answering.

I had forgotten. Or maybe, I had been made to forget.

Pages flipped under my fingers, frantic, past old memories, past childish scrawl, past the place where I should have stopped writing. Until I reached the **final page**.

I sucked in a breath.

The ink was **still forming**.

*"I’m coming up the stairs."*

The house was silent.

Then I heard it.

A single creak.

A footstep on the stairs.

Slow. Heavy. Close.

I wanted to believe it was just the house settling. I wanted to believe it so badly. But the diary was still in my lap, and when I looked down, another line of ink had appeared.

*"Don’t turn around."*

And then—warm breath against my ear.

A whisper.

**"You found me."**

I couldn’t move. Every muscle in my body locked as the words sank in, as I felt the breath on my neck. It was real. **Someone was behind me.**

No. Not someone. *Something.*

The diary trembled in my hands. My breath came in quick, panicked bursts, my skin crawling with the unbearable awareness that I wasn’t alone. I squeezed my eyes shut, willing myself not to turn around, not to look, not to acknowledge it. Because somehow, deep inside, I knew that if I did… it would mean something far worse than just seeing it.

I could hear it now. **Breathing.** Slow, deliberate, right against my ear, like it was waiting for me to react. Like it was *enjoying* this.

The diary warmed in my lap, the pages rustling as if a breeze had passed through the attic. **Another line appeared.**

*“You used to talk to me. Why did you stop?”*

Tears burned my eyes. I wanted to scream, to run, to bolt for the attic door and never look back—but my body wouldn’t listen. I remembered now, pieces coming back in jagged fragments.

I had written to someone in this diary. A friend. An invisible friend, or at least that’s what I thought back then. I used to write questions, and it would answer. It knew things—things I couldn’t have known. **Things no one could have known.**

And then, one night, I wrote something I wasn’t supposed to.

The memory surfaced like a corpse breaking through ice.

*“Can I see you?”*

And it had answered.

I slammed the diary shut, sucking in a breath like I’d just resurfaced from drowning. The attic was suffocating, the air thick, *wrong*. The presence behind me hadn’t moved. I could still feel it there, still hear that slow, steady breathing. My fingers clenched the diary like a lifeline, my mind screaming at me to *run*. But I knew. **The moment I stood up, it would act.**

The pages of the diary fluttered open again. **The ink was forming on its own.**

*“You shouldn’t have left me alone.”*

A single tear slipped down my cheek. I was shaking, heart pounding so hard I thought it would burst. Then, another line appeared, the words stretching across the page, more frantic now, as if whatever was writing was growing impatient.

*“Look at me.”*

No. **No.**

I clenched my teeth, squeezed my eyes shut tighter. It was so close now, I could feel something brushing my hair, the weight of its presence pressing against my back. It *wanted* me to turn around. It needed me to acknowledge it.

Another line appeared, hurried, almost desperate.

*“You can’t ignore me forever.”*

I thought of my childhood self, scribbling away in this diary, laughing at the strange answers that appeared. I thought of how excited I’d been to have a “friend” no one else could see. And I thought of the night I had stopped writing, when I had woken to find **words appearing on their own**, without me asking. Telling me things. Warning me.

**Begging me not to stop.**

And I had ignored it.

Something moved behind me. A shift in the air, a whisper of fabric. And then—**a hand pressed against my shoulder.**

Cold. Too long. **Wrong.**

I broke.

With a ragged scream, I flung the diary away, bolted to my feet, and **ran**. I didn’t look back. I didn’t stop. I hurled myself down the attic steps, nearly tripping as I hit the hallway, yanking the door shut behind me. The second it clicked into place, the air changed. The presence was gone.

Or at least, I thought it was.

Then, from the other side of the attic door, I heard it.

A single, quiet *scratch*.

Then another.

And then—a whisper.

**“Don’t leave me again.”**
