I always despised flying. It wasn’t really a fear, more like a hatred. I’ve only flown once before and I hated it. This time, it was my second and last time flying. 

This was my first time flying alone. The other time, i had flown with my parents. Usually, I go on road trips or boats. But, a road trip would not be able to cover my one way to Japan. I love the US but i really can’t deal with my parents. So, I decided to run away. 

As I stepped out of the car, the bright lights of the airport overwhelmed me. There was something peculiar about this though, something that put me off. 

At the entrance of the airport, stood a worried looking woman. Her skin was a sickly pale and her eye-bags were deep into her skin. She was clutching a piece of paper. The expression on her face suggested she was waiting for someone. As she looked around, nervously scanning the area, her face lit up when she saw me. Without uttering a word, she handed me a list. I gratefully accepted it, assuming it was a sort of voucher. I looked down skimming over the paper.

Upon closer inspection, i realised this was a handwritten note. The handwriting seemed rushed and was shaky. I looked up asking,”maam, what is thi-“ To my complete shock, she was gone. A lump formed in my throat as i sat myself onto a wooden box near the entrance of the airport. I began reading he list she had given me.

Rules for surviving at the airport.

1. Do not talk to the man in the yellow hat. No matter how much he tries to talk to you , completely ignore him. He may hit you or threaten you but pain is nothing compared to the fate you will suffer if you talk to him.

1a) If he begins to follow you, scream as loud as you can. If it was loud enough, he should be gone. If it wasn’t, i wish you the best of luck.
1b) If he leaves you alone, refer to rule 5

2. Do not go to the bathroom during the first 10 minutes you are at the airport.They are waiting for you.

3. The airport should be busy when you enter.

3a) If it is busy, try to avoid talking to anyone. You never know if it is them.
3b) If it is empty, hide, run, do anything to avoid them but under no circumstances board your flight or leave the airport.

4. If at any point the outside is just a black void, close your eyes and count to 66. Do not open your eyes unless you want to experience a fate worse than death.

5. Board your flight as quickly as you can. It’s really not worth the wait. 

Remember, as soon as you go in, you cannot go out unless you have flown. The flight attendant should hand you another list of rules regarding the flight.

“What the actual fuck?” I blurted out. 

“Is there a problem?” I looked up to see a man in a yellow hat..
