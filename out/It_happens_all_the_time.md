This story isn't mine to tell, it was told to me by my best friend. Derek probably wouldn't even want me to tell this story, but I feel that it needs to be told. I got a call from Derek late one night from the hospital. "I have something I have to tell you." He sounded desperate, frantic even. 

Derek hit an all-time low point in his life a while before this. This is the kind of trauma that manifests itself in the form of self-destructive tendencies. Being plowed into by a drunk driver shortly after getting married can do that to a man. He lived, she didn't. Needless to say, it drove him into a level of despair that can't be described in words. 

When I arrived at his room he was staring off into space with a blank, distant expression. As he turned to me I realized just how bad he looked. His eyes were bloodshot with bags under them. After a few moments his numb, emotionless demeanor changed into frantic sobs, Without saying a word I wrapped him in a hug and tried to console him. He eventually calmed down enough for me to sit and talk. "What happened man?" I asked, as delicately as possible.

He looked at me once again, a pained expression on his face. When he spoke his voice sounded shaky. This is the story he told me.

I guess you could say it all started when she died. I kind of lost motivation to continue the same routine I was used to. I started missing work, shut out my family, and started drinking heavily. After a month or so of the same routine, I subsequently lost my job. Things only got worse. Pills, then eventually heavier drugs took hold. And then this...

My first memory of this experience was being in a stupor one night, the kind that makes you forget where you are momentarily. The room was cold, not uncommon for a seedy motel. I heard a knock at the door, I stood to turn the light on, the dull yellow bulb casting a glow that reminded me of an old sepia-type movie, but as I went to look through the peephole I saw nothing. I opened the door, scanning the breezeway... Nobody was there. 

Shaking my head I shut the door and I walked my way over the cold floor to the bathroom. I had a very strange feeling, like the room around me felt lifeless.

I flipped the switch on the wall, immediately I saw that the bathroom took on the same eerie tone. My reflection stared back at me, making me realize just how exhausted I looked. I took a moment to splash water on my face to clear my thoughts. Suddenly I thought I'd heard something. I stood stock still. I could've sworn I'd heard the shuffling of feet. The bathroom light suddenly turned off.

I was becoming Ill with fear. The light from under the door began to flicker with a strange buzzing sound. I cautiously peeked around the door, like a child with an overactive imagination. 

I had barely peeked around the door when suddenly the light turned off, and now both lights were out, plunging the room into darkness. Just before the light went out I thought I saw a figure in the corner of the room. Creeping cautiously toward the light chain, I fumbled for it in the darkness. I pulled on it and to my unease, nothing happened. I stood motionless, completely freaked out. 

I jumped with a start when the white noise and grey glow of the TV came blaring on again. Then I thought I'd heard something else. Beneath the white noise was a different sound. I stopped and listened. 

The sound was mostly drowned out but it was there. Holding my breath I inched closer to the screen, and as I did so the sound became clearer. Fading in and out was… some sort of screaming. It seemed as though there were dozens of them wailing. I stood there, hand outstretched toward the power button, the sound of agonizing screams rose and fell within the white noise.

Just as I was about to unplug the tv, it turned off on its own. The screen went black. It was too quiet. It seemed as though the silence was even more unnerving than the noise. I slowly inched back toward the light chain. I didn't take my eyes off the TV even though it was pitch black. I was shaking but doing my best to convince myself it was just a faulty tv.

"Piece of shit."  The sounds of screaming were most likely a horror movie on a channel with a bad signal. I reached for the chain still shaking slightly, praying it would work this time. I sighed with relief as the light came to life. Just as I turned towards the bed, I was met with the breath of something inches from my face.

His complexion was sickly pale, almost matching his gray hair. the face was sunken and emotionless. It was a brief first encounter but I'll remember that face for eternity. At that moment I felt like I was staring death in the face “Don't worry, that happens all the time.” he said. I looked down, in his right hand was a knife, covered in blood. 

Just then the tv came blaring with those awful screams. I can only describe the man in front of me as being a shell of a human, an unbelievably ancient-looking man whose grey hair was long and stringy.

I stood paralyzed as I looked into the black pit where his eyes should be. Suddenly I was aware of another sound, the heavy footsteps of something large could be heard somewhere beyond the door, accompanied by an inhuman wail. Just as soon as I was aware of it, I bolted upright in bed, almost falling off of it… I was at home… 

My heart racing as well as my breathing. My jaw hurt as if I'd been grinding my teeth. It was clearly a nightmare. 

The feeling, though, even now that I was awake in my own home, seemed to linger. I was no stranger to bad dreams, but as far as I can remember, before she died I had never had nightmares such as these.

I swallowed hard realizing my mouth was dry and went downstairs for a glass of water. I racked my brain for any memory that involved the motel In the dream. It felt familiar in a way couldn't grasp as I walked back to my room. 
 
I lay awake thinking about the nightmare,  I couldn't stop thinking about the eyes of the man, or the lack thereof. Other thoughts crept into my mind and eventually drifted toward abstract thoughts as sleep took over. Suddenly the sound of something invaded my eardrums, and for the second time I found myself back in the motel room.

I was immediately aware of the fact that I could only move my eyes as I looked toward the direction of the sound, whatever it was seemed to be coming up the stairs. I could hear several thumps reverberating from the metal stairs. I listened, paralyzed and terrified as I heard the sound growing in volume as it made its way up the stairs, sounding as if it were crawling, accompanied by what could only be described as the cracking and popping of bones. 

As it got closer I could hear the sound of deep gurgling and wheezing, like that of a sickly and choking creature. It stopped just a few feet before the window as I still couldn't see any shadow beyond the curtain, and the light outside my door started to flicker. I heard the sound of a door handle turning, I lay paralyzed in fear,  but as I heard a door creak open I realized that it was coming from the direction of the neighboring room. I still could only move my eyes as I stared toward the flickering light. 

My ears were met by the muffled sound of moaning and confused shouts from the voice of a man through the wall behind me. The shouts evolved into terrified shrieks. I could still hear the thing breathing, only seeming to get more excited. My heart pounded as I could do nothing but listen as the terrified cries turning to muffled screaming, and then gurgled choking accompanied by cracking and wet crunching. 

All sound went quiet aside from the heavy breathing of the thing as I lay in silence still struggling to move. Once again I heard the footsteps of the thing as it seemed to leave the room. I prayed silently that it wouldn't come my way. 

My eyes were shut tight for what seemed like an eternity until I realized that everything was silent. Opening my eyes I looked first toward the window, still unable to move my body, the light was no longer flickering beyond the curtain. 

I looked to the edge of the bed, and to my horror, there stood the old man, illuminated only by the light from the breezeway. "Don't worry, that happens all the time." That's when I heard a tapping, slowly looked in the direction of the window and saw a silhouette that was unlike anything I'd seen, humanoid in shape, yet it was anything but human, it looked as though it was standing, only with its back hunched over. It was standing at an angle where I could see an unnaturally long neck with it's head seemingly facing toward me.

Something smashed against the window with a crunch, leaving a dark splatter on the other side. I would have screamed if only I had the ability. With another sickening splat, I could make out the form of what was being slammed into thwindow… The shape of a human head was being held by the hair. "Please stop" I prayed silently. 

Almost as if the thing reacted to my thoughts, it immediately stopped. In a raspy, distorted voice, the thing spoke "you couldn't imagine the things he will do to you." Dropping the mangled head, it moved away from the window, and towards the door to my room. I laid paralyzed as the handle twisted. 

I was awake almost immediately, woken by the sound of thunder. I reached over to turn on the bedside lamp, to realize that it wouldn't turn on. "Of course" I'd said aloud. The storm had knocked out the power. All was silent except for the sound of rain and thunder. I looked at my phone to find that it was 3 a.m.

I rubbed my eyes trying to shake the residual sense of unease. Sitting in the darkness wasn't helping at all, so I decided to go downstairs and to the front porch to see if the other houses had lost power. 

I sat on the porch and watched the rain as it poured, all other houses were dark. What struck me as odd was that all of the houses seemed vacant, no cars in the driveways. And then I looked down the street towards the end of the block. I noticed the vague form of something in the road. 
The sky was a dark with storm clouds, the only illumination was that of the moon behind the thick clouds, casting an eerie glow upon them. With a flash of lightning I caught a glimpse of a figure standing at the end of the block in the middle of the road. I squinted to try and make out any details. It looked to be the figure of a very tall man. 

After a few moments of squinting into the dark wall of rain I began to turn back towards the door, but just as I did a flash once again illuminated the figure in the road, only much closer. It seemed like the only way for him to be that much closer was as if he was sprinting down the road toward me. 

I took a few steps back, my hand finding the door knob, still staring in the direction of the figure. My eyes were trained on the spot I'd last seen the figure, and as another flash lit the sky I saw nothing. I turned the knob and went inside, locking the door behind me. 

I wiped the rain from my face with a sigh, feeling the weight of exhaustion. I sat on the couch and laid my head back, staring through the darkness. I thought of my wife, and the last time I'd seen her face. I didn't like the darkness, nor the quiet, for fear of being left with my thoughts. I felt like I had to keep moving, at least until the power came back. Maybe I was afraid of the nightmares to creep their way back in.

I don't know how long I'd paced until I decided to call the electric company. It rang a few times before being forwarded to a message, "if you're experiencing a power outage, please be patient, we're in the process of fixing the issue." Just as I took the phone from my ear I thought I'd heard something. "Don't worry, it happens all the time". I put the phone back to my ear "Power outages are common during this weather, we will have your electricity restored as soon as possible."

As eerie as it was to hear those words, I had to chalk it up to a coincidence. I sat down on the couch in the dark, with only the flashing of lightning illuminating my surroundings. My eyes were heavy. Thoughts began to blur together as sleep took me despite my attempts to prevent it. 

I found myself walking down a road, on either side were nothing but tall trees. The woods were thick and rarely were there any breaks to seeing you much of anything beyond the treeline. The road stretched on and on with no end in sight. Looking to my right I realized my wife and I were holding hands. 

She gazed straight ahead smiling, I couldn't take my eyes off her. It was lightly raining, reminding me of the walks we used to take. Suddenly she stopped walking and her smile faded, her expression turning serious. “You need  to wake up.” I followed her gaze. 

Down the road about a football field away I saw a figure. It looked familiar, like the one I'd seen on the lightning-lit road. Freakishly tall and emaciated, its arms were longer than any human, as were the legs. As terrifying as it was, I didn't want to leave. “I don't want to wake up.” I said a bit choked up. “No I mean really... wake up.” She said. 

Looking ahead again I was startled by the fact that the thing was noticeably closer. Its head cocked to one side and its torso contorted at an inhuman angle. “I don't…” I trailed off. Looking left, I found that the trees were gone, and in their place was the familiar motel building from my previous nightmare.

There was only one building and had only twelve rooms for each of the two floors, rusted metal stairs led up to the second floor. The only other building was the dilapidated office. 

My attention was caught by the windows of the eerie place. The curtains were drawn to reveal the darkness,  but I could see the faint silhouettes of someone or something. It seemed as though they occupied every window of the building. 

A flicker of yellow light flashed from within a room on the second floor, the faint flash illuminated the same man from my dream. His eyeless gaze focused directly on me, as I looked forward again, the creature was maybe 50 yards away now. I stood terrified as it emitted an inhuman wail. It seemed like a blanket of darkness followed it. I looked back at my wife, suddenly her mouth opened, emitting a loud sound of white noise. My eyes snapped open. 

The sound of my phone ringing woke me. It was my brother. I hesitated, I wanted to talk to someone, to anyone, but how do you explain to someone that you may or may not be insane?

After a few moments, the ringing stopped and I sighed. I stared at my phone, contemplating whether or not I should call back. Just as I reached for the phone it rang once more, making me jump.

"hey bro what's going on?" I said. "Oh same shit different day, just thought I'd call and see if you were still alive." Something about what he said made me feel uneasy. "Yeah um… yeah I'm ok, just taking it day by day," I responded. "You sound tired, are you sure everything is ok?" He asked. "Yeah, just a bit annoyed, the power is out and I've been waiting for it to come back on." He chuckled at that one. "Don't worry, that happens all the time." He said. My blood went cold. "What did you say?". "Awe what's the matter, are you scared of the dark?" His voice was warped. 

I dropped my phone as the sounds of white noise and the familiar screams filled the air. I jumped up and ran up the stairs as the sounds seemed to follow me. I slammed the door and huddled in the corner with my eyes shut tight and my hands covering my ears, I could feel the floor shake as if something monstrous was coming up the stairs. Then after several seconds passed I realized that they were gone. I dared not move, worried that somehow I might once again hear the horrible noises that filled my ears only moments before. Several minutes passed, and I finally managed to stand, still shaken. 

The way things were going, the nightmares, the noises, the whole experience seemed impossible to comprehend in any sane manner. 

I headed down the stairs and into the kitchen, opening the fridge I squinted, and spotted the six-pack on the top shelf in the dark, as I closed the refrigerator door I stopped, something was odd. Opening it I was met with the odor of spoiled meat.  "What the fu-" I trailed off. How was it that the contents of the fridge had already gone bad? How long has it been without power? 

Had it been long enough for it to spoil everything? Ultimately I tried to convince myself that it must have been acting up before the power outage. I sighed, practically dragging my feet over to the couch. 

The rain was still coming down heavily, not letting up for an instant. The lightning was still the only source of light, I just stared at nothing. The events of the night were weighing heavily on my mental state, even if it was just my sleep-addled brain causing these things they were nevertheless bothering me. I finished my beer and went to grab another. 

After doing so I suddenly remembered dropping my phone, so I walked over to where I was standing and squinted through the darkness. I felt along the floor for a minute or so to no avail. Upon standing back up I happened to glimpse something on the coffee table. It was my phone. 

I considered calling the electric company again but decided that nothing I could say would make any difference. Not to mention I was paranoid of what I might hear. I went to grab another beer. I felt a bit cooped up so I went to sit on the porch.watching the rain as it poured endlessly. Even though it knocked out the power, I loved thunderstorms, and despite everything, I started to relax a bit. 

Ever so often I'd still get the eerie feeling that I'd once again see the figure in the street, but thankfully I saw nothing save for the torrents of rain and lightning. 

Still staring in the direction of where I'd seen the figure I saw what seemed to be the flickering of a street light.

I stood to my feet. In hope that this may be a sign that the power was being restored, I turned around and stepped into the house to see if they worked. I was immediately met with confusion, I was back in the motel room. I turned to find that the door wouldn't budge. 

I could hear some conversation coming from beyond the wall behind the bedpost. Someone was talking in the next room over. The muffled exchanges sounded like the mundane conversation of two friends. 

As I crept closer the verbal exchanges became strange, gradually morphing into something else entirely.
  
I was slightly able to hear bits and pieces of the conversation, though jumbled together as if they were both speaking at once. Then everything went silent for a moment as I stood still. "He doesn't think we know he's listening." They both spoke at once, their voices warped into one inhuman tone. "And he doesn't know he's coming, very soon." 

I stood frozen as I heard movement from the other room, I felt sick. The two voices whispered incomprehensibly, both giggling in their warped voices. Then strangely the two voices started humming. Some haunting melody that was made all the more creepy by the inhuman voices. 

I noticed that the humming was moving closer, and soon I heard scratching on the other side of the wall, only a couple of feet away. The voices abruptly stopped… tap….tap...tap. then “why not invite us in?” I then heard scratching again. Only this time it scraped along the wall, moving toward the conjoining door. 

I instinctively scrambled to the closet in the room. I prayed silently that the door to the conjoined room was locked. To my horror, I heard the knob turn slowly. The old door creaked open loudly.  Bare feet were heard slapping against the floor as the creature crept toward the closet door, stopping just feet from it.

I could hear ragged breathing as the thing stood at the door. My blood froze in my veins as I heard the knob slowly turn and the closet door creaked open.

A flash of lightning illuminated the room, and standing just inches from me was something almost indescribable. A naked and mutated monstrosity. I could see the thin form of some ungodly creature, it's spine exposed and arched unnaturally where the spine meets the ribcage, its legs arched backward like that of an animal, and an outstretched hand with too many fingers. 

Two bald heads outstretched from long necks, their jaws hung loosely and were too long, both smiling, with needle-like teeth. Two large white eyes extruded from each face as if there were no sockets at all. All I could do was shut my eyes, too scared to move for an eternity.

I opened my eyes to find myself back in my room, huddled in the corner. I stood, still shaking. I couldn't tell what was real anymore. At this point, I wanted nothing more than for the power to return so that I wouldn't be in the dark. I paced back and forth across the bedroom floor, trying to keep moving.

Snapping me out of my daze I heard knocking from downstairs. I waited a few moments until I once again heard the knocking. Once I got to the bottom I heard a woman's voice from the other side of the door. "Hello? Please can you help me?" I paused. "What do you need?" I demanded, sounding a bit shaky. "I was wondering if you had any batteries for a flashlight." I paused once more. Then she knocked again. "Please, my kids are afraid of the dark." I sighed. "Ok," I said. 

It seemed to be the most harmless encounter of the entire night, only just as I turned I realized something that stopped me in my tracks. Why had the knocking sounded like it came from the bottom of the door? I slowly crouched down to peek under the door. I immediately regretted it. I was met with a deformed, vaguely human head, missing its bottom jaw, the top part of the jaw extended out, teeth jutted out at various angles, and grew in various places. There was a gaping hole where the eyes and nose should be, and the cavity was filled with maggots. Before I could react, a long black tongue snaked out of its mouth and underneath the door, making contact with my face, the smell was indescribably awful. 

Just as I tried to move away I fell. Cautiously peeking under the door I saw nothing, and the knocking had seized. I was confused, exhausted and terrified. 

I decided then and there that I was too sleep deprived and there was nothing I could do to prevent these things to manifest themselves in countless and horrific ways. I sluggishly moved to the nightstand where there sat a picture, the only one I had. My wife and I embraced one another. 

I pulled out my phone so that the light from it illuminated her face. Tears filled my eyes. Just before I was about to shut off the phone I saw something that caught my attention, the time on the phone read 3 a.m. just as it had some time ago. 

I suddenly realized I didn't know how long it had been since the power went out but I knew it should be daylight out, however, the darkness and the storm raged on with no sign of any light behind the thick clouds, aside from the faint glow of the moon. I couldn't take any more, I was way too far down the rabbit hole. I crawled into bed and shut my eyes. I'd soon find that it was a mistake. I found myself on the road again, standing in front of the motel. Only without my wife, and the darkness that followed the creature in the previous dream enveloped everything as far as the eye could see. 

Lightning flashed constantly making it possible for me to see the curtains of the rooms were drawn open, save for one. Only one door was open, the one with the flickering light. I felt I had to approach. As I walked towards the stairs I heard a familiar giggle to my right. I gazed in the direction of the sound I caught a glimpse of two familiar heads peeking around the corner of the building. 

They continued to chuckle in the same distorted voice as if they were holding in a secret. I turned and continued towards the stairs.I didn't know what I expected to find but carried on anyways. The fear grew stronger as I passed by every room, seeing horrible things through their windows with every flash. Blood painted the walls, dismembered body parts were strewn about the floor. Walking past a window a few rooms down from the open door, terror filled my heart as I witnessed an inhuman creature ripping flesh from the writhing body of a man. His limbs were removed, and his eyes were gouged out, yet he was alive, and screaming. I could do nothing more than continue on. 

I stopped at the window of the conjoined room, looking at dismembered corpse of a man. Looking in front of me I saw something that made me want to vomit. A human head lay on the floor of the breezeway, the face of the man was obliterated and broken to unrecognition. Teeth were scattered around the head in a pool of blood and brain matter.

I heard a giggle that made me turn around, the two headed monstrosity stood at the end by the stairs, watching me. I turned and once again continued to the next room. My heart raced faster than ever as I approached the open door. I peered through, my eyes darting around. I reluctantly crept into the room.

To my immediate horror, the door behind me shut, plunging the room into darkness. I heard a noise, it sounded like breathing, coming from the direction of the bed. I slowly backed away toward the door reaching for the handle. As I did so the sound of breathing stopped, for a moment the room was silent.

The TV came on, emitting the familiar white noise. Laying on the bed I sawthe body of a man, it didn't take long before I recognized the face… it was me, laying on my back, eyes rolled to the back of my head, completely still. Standing beside my body was something so unimaginable that my mind couldn't comprehend it. It's eyes alone were enough to destroy the soul of anyone. They were pitch black and very large. 

I recognized the form of the being, it was the creature that approached me from the dream of my wife. It was freakishly tall with long thin arms and legs that were inverted. The creature's eyes bore into my very being, The expression on it's face was one of cold indifference, though still somehow pure evil. It's features were indescribably horrific. if the old man with no eyes resembled death, this…. thing's eyes resembled hell. It slowly approached. 

I felt as though I was looking into the deepest depths of hell. I couldn't scream… my voice failed me. It stopped in front of me, tilting it's head to the side. The mouth of the thing slowly opened unnaturally wide, deafening sounds of agonizing screams filled my ears as it reached for me with it's black claws. At that moment I knew I was going to be consumed down to my very soul, and again, I could do nothing to stop it. So I closed my eyes and covered my face, anticipating  whatever fate awaited me. Then everything went silent. 

I opened my eyes, confused. I soon realized I was I was sprawled out on the floor at home next to my bed, a light shone throughout my bedroom. 

I slowly climbed to my feet. Looking toward the window and saw sunlight trickling in through the curtain. I reached for my phone. I breathed a sigh of relief. It was 9:46 a.m.

I felt a little rested, though still groggy. My mind wandered for a while before I finally stood up to go downstairs. As I reached the bottom steps I flipped the switch to the living room. The electricity was restored. I took a deep breath in relief. Satisfied, I moved toward the door and opened it…. My stomach dropped. I stepped out. I realized I was looking over the rail of the motel's breezeway. The scenery before me was the most terrifying thing I've ever seen in my life. One glimpse of what I saw was enough to destroy anyone to their core. 

Countless bodies, as far as the eye could see were writhing and screaming far below me in an endless river. Waves of lava tossed bodies in every direction,  faces were melted, eyes were missing, feeling every inch of their bodies being broiled. The sky was a swirling vortex of blackness and fire and rained more bodies into the vast river of magma that stretched as far as the eyes could see.

Some were trying to climb onto other people to escape the torture, only to once again sink into the melted rock again, and again. On either side of the pit were rock formations and low mountains. As I gazed at them I could make out the forms of countless grotesque creatures doing unspeakable things to countless people. Some were being held over blazing fires by their feet, some were being dismembered, their skin being peeled away slowly. Some were sewn to one another with various other limbs attached in the wrong places, some were being eaten, or forced to eat themselves. Blood and body parts were strewn about the cliffs.


A familiar voice behind me interrupted my catatonic state. "If hell wants you, no matter how much you run, hell finds you. It happens all the time." I turned to see the old man, he had a blank look on his face. He raised a hand, pointing somewhere behind me, I once again turned to look as a massive tidal wave of fire and lava was approaching, the floor began to quake violently as the walls of the building started to crack and crumble, the structure beneath me was about to give way. As I looked down, to my horror I saw charred black hands with exposed glistening bone reaching for me as they climbed the railing. At the last moment I heard another familiar voice. "Wake up!!!" 

All was quiet. I slowly opened my eyes, my vision was too blurry to see anything in detail, though I could make out vague silhouettes of people. I could feel something helping me breathe. After a few moments I drifted off again

When I awoke next I almost immediately started to panic. I bolted upright, finding wires and tubes and shit connected to me. Then I heard a new voice  "Calm down, you're ok, you're in a hospital, you suffered heart failure and we had to resuscitate you. 

They explained to me that I had been stabbed, 4 times by someone in a motel room. I dialed 911 just moments before I lost consciousness and my heart stopped. Luckily there was an ambulance nearby. I was dead for around 3 or 4 minutes, that's where they found me.

That was the conclusion of Derek's story. He said nothing more. He begged me to believe him as I embraced him. He insisted that regardless of who had stabbed him, and even admitting that it could have been a drug deal gone wrong even though he had no memory of it, the experience he had in death was very real. 

A few weeks later I got a call from Derek. He'd left his wallet in the room, and there was no way he was going back there. So of course I opted to retrieve it for him. This motel was indeed in the middle of nowhere. 

When I arrived I was uneasy. The place was damn near dilapidated to begin with, but reimagining the details of his experience made it all the more unsettling. The lot was almost empty. 

As I entered the office the smell of mold invaded my nose, the lights were dim and gave off an eerie sort of tone. "Can I help you?" The scratchy voice of an older woman spoke. "Yes ma'am, a friend of mine rented a room here, he had been stabbed and had to call an ambulance, anyways he received a call from here regarding his wallet being-" I was cut off by the woman tossing something to me. I opened it to see that it was indeed his wallet. She had no emotion. 

After I got back in my car I was about to leave, but hesitated. I noticed the other rooms had no light outside their doors besides this one. Curiosity got the best of me as I got out and walked towards the stairs. 

I climbed the stairs, making my way across the breezeway until I reached the room. I don't know what I expected to find but I peeked through the edges of the curtains. It was pitch black. The aura of the place felt lifeless, just as Derek had described.
"Got a light?" I almost leaped out of my skin. 

Standing in the blanket of darkness to my right was the silhouette of a man, hidden in shadow, his shape only illuminated by the pale moonlight. "Y….yeah.". I reached into my pocket to retrieve my lighter. I lit his cigarette for him, straining to see any details of the stranger, but saw nothing. 

A buzzing sound interrupted my thoughts. I turned to gaze at the yellow bulb next to the door as it flickered. The whole situation made me uneasy. "Don't worry, that happens all the time." I quickly turned my head towards the man, but he was gone. At my feet I noticed something that turned my veins to ice... a bloody knife, and a lit cigarette. I never returned to the place again. As for Derek, I don't think he recovered from his experience, I don't think he ever will.
