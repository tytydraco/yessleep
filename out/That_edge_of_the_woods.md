The alarm went off. I turned in my bed and and stretched a long much needed stretch. Peering at the window through half asleep eyes, I seen it was still dark outside. As it should be. After a few seconds I got up, stretched again, then made my way to the other side of my bedroom to turn off my phone alarm. 

"Jeez, if only this room had an outlet next to my bed!" I thought. 

I always felt rushed to turn it off, as the alarm just annoyed me, not a big deal though, it's just doing it's job. 

After grabbing my phone and switching the loud alarm off, I slowly walked back to my bed and grabbed the big glass of water on my nightstand. There's nothing like a glass of water to start the day I thought, while downing it quickly, a little water trickled down my cheeks and onto my chest. 

After I again slowly waltzed to the light switch by the door and flipped it on. The light greeted me hastily, and my eyes didn't appreciate it. After sitting down in my chair next to the door for a few minutes, waiting for my mind to awake, I finally got up to start a morning of fishing.


I didn't take me long to get around, my fishing gear was set, all I had to do was get dressed, brush my teeth, and prepare some food and water. Which was easy, my parents made some tuna salad for sandwiches last night. So I slapped that on some bread and grabbed a couple water bottles. After that that, I was ready to go. 

Nobody was awake when I left. Stepping outside the air was cool. There was a small breeze that blew sparsely, as I walked onto the sidewalk I seen a cat across the street. He just stood there and stared at me. There was always neighborhood cats around but this one was new. A rough looking cat, with orange fur. He looked pretty sick sitting there with the street light illuminating him. 


The walk to the creek on the edge of town took about 5 minutes. It existed at the end of a park that held two soccer fields, and two baseball fields, parallel to one another, the creek entrance was behind the soccer fields, at the edge of the woods. 

When I arrived it was still pretty dark, no lights were on, but you can see a faint glow on the horizon as the sun was beginning to greet my fair town. 

Walking up the path that split the fields, I had to walk past the small playground first. It had a pavilion near it and I could have sworn I seen someone sitting at the end of one of the picnic benches, in the far corner. 

"A bit early early for someone to be here."
I muttered to myself.

Once I got past the playground and arrived at the fields, a big sign greeted me.

"Thompson field"

Looking back at the playground my eyes were better adjusted. The person I saw sitting at the table, was gone. This took me back for a second while I stared hard to see better, then eventually looking around for the mysterious person. But I seen No one. 


It was very dark out in the deep field I had to cross to access the fishing spot. Even the concession stand in the center of the field, had no lights on. So I simply made my way to the edge of woods. 

As I continued, I saw something. It was rather tall and stood next to the path. I stopped in my tracks. 
"Is that a deer?"
Suddenly, the figure ran across the soccer field, at lightning speed, once it reached the treeline that led out of town, it stopped.
It started slowly walking down the treeline, in my direction. Until it turned toward the trees and ran up the 60Â° angle hill. All the wile being as silent as a mouse. 

I froze. My heart was thumping and my mind was confused. How could a deer run that fast? Why was is so tall? Why didn't it make any sound!? 

Feeling creeped out, I stood there for a awhile, to scared to even move. Looking back at the playground, it was vacant. Then looking back towards the fields, I seen nothing. The sun was rising and light started to emerge through the trees. After 10 minutes, the light was more prominent. And I felt safe enough to finally walk the path to the creek. 



Once I got there, I placed my fishing bag down on the metal picnic table and immediately grabbed a water bottle out of it. While taking a big drink, I looked around. It was still slightly dark but each second the sun kept brighting up the land. After drinking, I grabbed my phone out of my pocket and turned on "Art Bell" 

I downloaded plenty of his programs to my phone, it made fishing a little less boring for me. 

After going through and playing one of his "open lines" shows, I shoved the phone and my back pocket and started fishing. It was about time. 




About 2 hours passed, the sun was strongly shining now and the art bell show was nearing it's end. As for fishing, sure I caught a few fish, only bait fish though, like creek chub and shiners. There were talks about pike being in this creek, but I never seen one.

"Once this show ends, I think I'm going to call it and head back."
I never even touched my sandwich. Wasn't hungry. After this morning's little strange incident, I just wasn't in the mood to eat. 
Another 10 minutes went by and I kept fishing.
No bites.
Deciding to try one more different lure, I reeled my line in and changed it up, while doing so I seen a family way down at the playground. They looked happy as they used the playground. My eyes then shifted, to the pavilion. And I seen someone sitting in the same spot from this morning. Head down and back turned to the joyful sounds protruding from the family.


"Who's that?" 
I wondered while snipping my line to exchange lures.
I then realised it can't be the dad on the playground as well with his family. It's a stranger just sitting there.

I didn't really pay much mind to it as kept adjusting my line. After tying a jerkbait on I looked back up and he was gone, while testing my knot I kept a good eye on that direction, eventually I seen the same person leaning against the edge of the concession stand. His back towards me. 

Once the rig was set up, I continued fishing. The art bell show had someone on there talking about some scary story that he experienced. The show was near it's end as I checked it. Another 20 minutes. Once the show ends I'm going home. It's been pretty fun but I don't wanna be out here much longer, it just didn't feel right even in broad daylight.


Looking back, he was gone from the concession stand, looking at the path No one was walked it. I turned my head towards the creek again to focus on fishing, until the man walked up on my right side. 

He just stood there, didn't say a word. He looked older than me, around 25.
Time went by quickly and he never spoke. So I broke the silence.

"Hey, how are you?"
He looked over at me and started inching closer.
"Yo" is all replied with.
"How's it going?"
"Alright."

Okaaay, this was weird. Maybe I should just pack up and leave. This guy is acting strange. I mean who just creeps up on somebody fishing and just stands there?

After a few seconds of awkward silence, the art bell show came back from commercial. The bumper music caught his attention. 

"I love this song."
It was "Africa" by toto. 

"Yeah, me too."
I replied while casting my line out into the cold creek water again.
"Whats your name man?"
"Elijah" He responded 

"Hey man, I'm lee."
I walked over to him and we shook hands.

After the whole name exchange. Art bell started speaking again from my phone.

"So, you catch anything?"
While reeling in I told him i caught a few little bait fish. But that's it. 

"I've been here since the morning, but I'm about to head out, you wanna take my spot? Are you trying to fish as well?"
No words.

"Hey did you want to try fishing here?"
Its only enough room for 1 fisherman in this location.

"No, I'm just chilling." 

"Oh, well okay."

Awkward silence again. The program was ending, art bell was doing the outro, and right when I casted for one last time and worked on my retrieve, he said,

"Would you believe me if I said I lived out here in these woods?"



My blood ran cold. My hands started shaking slightly, and my retrieve was altered. 

I looked behind me and saw that the family was gone. And Nobody else but us occupied the park. Once I turned to him to respond, I got slammed on my line. 

"Whoa!"
The pole tip bent while I set the hook.
"What is this?" I exclaimed.
Before I could talk again, Elijah ran down the bank and started enoucourging me on to land the fish.
"Tighten that drag, this is a good one."
I took his advice and tightened my drag, he was right this fish was nice!"
"Keep your rod tip up, steer him to me, I'll grab him for you."
Continuing to take his advice, I eventually got the fish to the bank. It flailed and splashed while Elijah cheered me on more.

Finally after a small battle, I landed the fish. And Elijah grabbed it by the gills.
Why is he not lipping it I thought?
And then I realised, it must be a pike! Wow! I caught the elusive sharp toothed fish that people said resided here! Then to my ease my anxiety, elijah did indeed hold up a nice medium sized pike. My heart raced yet again. I gotta get a picture of me with this fish!

"Nice man! Thanks on helping me land it."
"Here grab my hand, I'll pull you up."

He didn't respond again

The next thing that happened is he grabbed my line. Then ripped the fished head the opposite way. Breaking my line and hurting the poor fish in the process.

"What the fuck are you doing man?"
"Why did you do that?"

He ignored me again and flung the fish over his shoulder, his arm had blood all over it and the suffering fish flopped on his back while splashing his own blood everywhere.

"Elijah, hellooo?!!" "Get back here man!"
He just started walking into the water.
A big amount of blood entered the creek as he delved in.

He swam away while holding the fish as they went under. He eventually popped up 50 or so feet until he Resurfaced. I stood there with my broken line still dangling, phone in my hand, and confusion consumed me. Looking up, He then got out of the water, slung the flopping fish over his shoulder again, and walked into the woods. 

Feeling defeated, I walked back home.

My parents were gone, and the house was quiet. I put all my fishing gear away and decided to take a shower. After the shower I would eat? Maybe. I couldn't believe that homeless guy stole my fish! He ruined everything! What an asshole I thought. It was alot to let seep in. And extremely tiring. I thought about this during my shower. He was homeless, but that's no excuse for what he did! If he needed food or money, i would have helped him! I skipped food again. Still wasn't hungry. So I went to my room.

Looking at the clock it said 9:35 am.
"Its still so early but I'm exhausted."
Checking my phone it wouldn't turn on. I thought it broke when I dropped it but when I plugged it in, it showed the charging symbol. 

Being tired like I was, I dropped my curtains, and turned my fan on. It's time to sleep again. I don't care when I wake up I have no way to use my alarm anyways so I just layed down and closed my eyes.

I forgot to close my window and while I was about to drift off into sleep, I heard a terryfing thing. It sounded like a bump right outside my door. my head twisted towards it. While staring that way another sound to my left absolutely froze me to my core. It came from my open window, It was a voice and it said,

"Goodnight lee"
