**>FILE STATUS - CLASSIFIED**

If you’re reading this, I would advise you to go and search for [my first entry](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zemw80/your_introduction_to_the_leftfield_files/) of my time with Project Leftfield. It serves as a good introduction to the information that I’m about to talk about. I’ve spent the past few nights going over what case would be best to talk about next, and I think I know just the one.

The first thing that you always have to ask yourself when you deal with anything paranormal is how intelligent they seem to be. You’ll get some creatures that aren’t much smarter than a damn fish, biting at whatever is the first thing that crosses their eyes. Most I’d say are about as smart as a wolf or a bear. They’re predators alright, but it’s a sort of animalistic drive behind their intelligence, eat or be eaten. They don’t have any morals, any values, nor any capacity to think about them either. I don’t blame beings like that for wanting to eat me. Even if they’ll put the fear of the devil right into my bones, I don’t blame them. The ones I blame are the few that are actually smart. If you're able to think as a man, by God I'll judge you as a man. I've made a lotta friends with those types, but even more enemies.

My first encounter with one in the wild was in New York City, January, 1967. I’d been with the Project for a couple of years at this point, seen my fair share of deaths and horrible scenes, but nothing like what I was about to walk into. My partner was a bit more of a veteran than myself, a Russian-American man named John. He looks just as you might imagine him, strong jaw, short blond hair, light eyes. Very stereotypical Russian, kinda like they lab grew him or something. When I was first introduced to him, I was surprised that they let someone like him on the force to be completely honest, but if not for him I’d have been dead several times over. John was just about the best shot we had on the force, I swear he could have hit the wings off of a fly from twenty yards away. Anyways, it was snowing in the city, and John looked right at home in it. Not like my southern ass, and as we stepped out of the vehicle and into the cold I quickly made my way into the building of the most recent murder victim of our creature.

Project Leftfield had been made aware of a string of strange murders that had taken place in the city, going back to about a week before Christmas. After thirteen very similar ‘occultly’ murders over the course of about a month, we were finally brought in by a police sergeant working in the precinct. We have men in many precincts around the nation, they never knew enough to piece together the picture of what the Project really was, but they were kept enough in the loop to be helpful. Whenever something came their way that was simply too strange or outlandish for them to be able to handle, we would be called in to clear it up. A few forms later, sometimes an ‘interview’ or two, and we would be out of their hair. It was a symbiotic relationship of the highest kind: one between two people who wanted absolutely nothing to do with each other. Past their work, that is. I’ve talked to quite a few of them over the years, trying to see what they thought of the whole thing. From what I can tell, they want little to do with it, as if they were just telling the garbage men to go take out the trash. It also seemed that they tended to pick up reputations within their own departments as well, being the officers who were always called out to the ‘weirder’ cases, and very few of them were any too happy about that. Back to the point.

The pattern of the murders was always as follows - A spouse would go to some big party, somewhere public, where they’d be easily seen by at least one or two other people. Then, they’d mysteriously appear back at home much earlier than they should have been back. They’d murder their spouse, and do some rather heinous things to the body. The pictures of the more recent cases that the local policeman had sent the Project were rather disturbing. The first three murders were rather simple, two asphyxiations and a stabbing. After that, it devolved into an increasingly disturbing scene with each subsequent murder. 

The fourth one had the wife laying in a pool of her own blood, on her back. Her neck had been bisected vertically, starting at her chin and ending at the top of her sternum. The skin had been, rather roughly, pulled away from the neck, seemingly as if by hand due to the torn nature of the wound. There, several cuts had been made by a kitchen knife, and a piece of bone had been torn out. There were body parts missing from each of the following murders, though from what the case files that had been sent to us prior had shown, there didn’t seem to be much of a pattern to the missing parts. The only thing that I had noticed was that the placement of the bodies started becoming more and more elaborate with each passing murder.

As John and I made our way into the building, several officers there stopped us before we presented our badges. They looked at eachother, and after some quiet disagreement between the two of them, let us in, handing both of us white masks. They looked queasy, not something that I can blame them for, considering what we would soon witness. As we stepped towards the apartment, the hall was lined with officers. Some were hunched over, some were trying not to vomit. Most were just as far away from the room as they could find themselves, and some others were smoking to try and block the smell. Lincoln, the man who had brought us to the case in the first place, approached us and stopped me, whispering “Glad to see you boys. It is bad in there, I’m not going to lie to you.”

John looked over, replying firmly “That’s why we’re here,” before continuing his walk into the apartment. I gave Officer Lincoln an apologetic look, and a supportive “Thanks for the heads up,” before continuing into the apartment myself.

The first thing that I noticed in the room were the flies. Bugs had stopped bothering me at some point between then and my previously mentioned case, but the sheer quantity of them still was something that disturbed me, irregardless of my self-proclaimed recovery. There were thousands of dead ones, piled onto the floor in the corners where they had been swept into. Hundreds more still tried to lazily buzz around, fat and gorged on our most recently discovered victim. 

Unfortunately for John and I, his body had been partially decomposed, the source of the terrible smell that we had scented down the hall. Only two officers were forced to stand in the room with us, looking resigned to their positions in life. One tried to make a passing greeting to John, and after he was blown off as well, no attempt was made for myself. I quickly followed behind my partner, taking stock of what remained of the body. 

His face was completely unrecognizable, having been bashed in. There was blood coating several objects around the room as well, leaving the impression that when he went down, it likely wasn’t a quick death. There seemed to be little ritualistic parts of this death, simply just a brutal, horrible beating and murder. Several bones that were exposed looked broken as well. At first glance, we couldn’t tell which part of him had been the one taken, his body being too decomposed and consumed by the many maggots and flies which now called this man “Home”. 

I knelt down to try and get a better look at the neck of the man, having slipped on my gloves, and touched his neck. As I did so, the flesh caved in under my touch, revealing more nastiness inside. The bugs that crawled out of the abrasion that I had created wriggled violently, disturbed by my intrusion. I had pulled my hand away and stood as quickly as possible, shaking slightly.

In the background, I could hear John stifling a laugh despite the scene. He knew the story behind my last case and thought it absolutely hilarious. I shook my head after calming myself, and asked “You want to be the one knuckle deep in the corpse?” 

Despite his confidence and standoffishness, he didn’t much like touching dead bodies, and as such simply motioned for me to continue, trying his best to not cause a scene. Kneeling back down into the filth that surrounded the body, I touched around the top of his head before I quickly realized what piece of meat was the one missing: there was a large crack in part of his skull, allowing us to see into his head. It looked sterile, as though not a single maggot had wanted to find themselves within the cavern that held the remains of the rotting brain. I peered into the skull to try and figure out why there weren’t any bugs in there, and I realized that around half of the poor man's brain was missing.

I stood up and looked over at John, who looked considerably more confused than myself. “I don’t care what your pamphlet said, you and I both know the living dead don’t eat the brains of their victims,” he whispered to me, removing his hand from his service weapon. I wondered when he had felt the need to grab at it. I shrugged and gestured down at the body that was between us.

“I know, I know. Besides, the other bodies weren’t missing this piece anyways.” We left that building with very few answers, mainly just more questions to go solve. We had decided to head into the police precinct to check what other information that they might be privy to that we hadn’t seen in just the photographs that were sent. 

As we entered the building, John looked around and made the decision for me what our roles would be. “I’ll look at the rest of the photographs and case files that they have. Go and talk to Lincoln about talking to the suspects and witnesses,” he commanded, much in a tone that left little to discuss.

“Right away, commie. Shall you dictate my next meal too?” I retorted, noting his expression of exasperation as I turned to find our man. Lincoln seemed ready to help out in any way that he could, and many of the other officers were very happy to give us the space we needed to talk to each other quietly.

“We don’t have the location of the most recent victim’s wife,” he told me, looking a little uncomfortable with the short distance between the two of us “If you must talk to some of the other suspects, I might be able to arrange that. I think we still have two in custody from the most recent murders.”

I nodded, adding “That’d be great. A moment alone with them-”

He cut me off “Alone? Listen, I know you’ve gotta do your thing, but I need to keep my job,” his voice squeaking out, seeming nervous to even bring up an objection to my plan. I felt bad for the man and raised my hand in a placating manner.

“Alright, that’s fair. If you need to be in the room with us, I get it,” I replied, smiling gently as I spoke. “I’m just not sure how much you want to know about what sort of stuff we're dealing with.”

Lincoln considered his options and agreed that I could have a few moments alone with the two that they had in custody. I mentioned how grateful I was and eagerly took the opportunity. The first was of little help, as I came into the room they refused to speak without a lawyer, despite my mention that I was attempting to prove them innocent. An understandable play from a desperate man, but not one that I had time to humor. The second, a middle aged man, was much more willing to listen to my questions once I explained that I wasn’t officially part of the police.

As I sat down in the interrogation room that had been offered to me, I quickly began my questioning. \[REDACTED\] was slow to answer, feeling troubled by my haste, but eventually fell into step after several more minutes of me promising that I wasn’t trying to find a loophole in his statements. “And so I ask again, how were the weeks leading up to the murder of your wife, Mr. \[REDACTED\]?”

“Well, normal, really. Just about as normal as things are when you’re looking back on them after someone's dead,” he began to slump slightly in his chair. \[REDACTED\] was a slightly portly man, balding, but still trying to cover his head with what strands of hair he had left. He had crooked teeth, and sunken eyes. He looked like he was just about ready to give up, to be honest.

I continued to pry regardless. “Really? No strange events? Nothing that was even remotely out of the ordinary?”

“Well, there was a break in, a few days before,” he mumbled, holding himself up on the table. I had to mentally prepare myself in case he was about to cry. I’d never been great with criers.

“Go back to that night, describe it to me,” I spoke in a more gentle tone, trying to calm him down somewhat. “Any detail might help find your wifes real killer.” 

“Sure, sure. Thinking about it, I guess it was kinda weird all things considered. My wife and I usually go to bed around ten or so each night. I had just finished cleaning up the dishes and was looking over at her from the kitchen as she was folding laundry at the kitchen table. We were talking about…” He trailed off for a moment, trying to remember before continuing. “Well, anyways, we were talking. We started to get into an argument. Kinda heated, I don’t remember how it started, but I do remember the yelling. We don’t usually get into arguments, I swear. But she stormed through the house for a few minutes before grabbing some of her stuff and leaving. She slammed the front door on the way out.” I sat there for a few moments as \[REDACTED\] stared down at the table, collecting himself.

After a moment of silence, “And…?” I prompted him to continue.

“And, not even four or five minutes later, I hear her call my name. I… I thought I heard her call my name, at least. It came from the bedroom. I wasn't sure how she had managed it, I had been next to the front door the entire time, and I was so certain it was her voice. I replied to her… and she just called out my name again, but this time, it sounded much more strained. As if she was crying, like she had to choke it out.” He paused to breathe in a rasping breath. “I took a few steps towards the bedroom and I heard someone sit down on the bed. I was… I just about reached the door when I heard the front door open. I turned around to see my wife enter back in, having simply walked down the hall before coming back. She apologized to me as I stood there in shock. By the time I opened the door, whoever was in there had already left. They had taken her jewelry box, maybe a few of her clothes, so the police just reported it as a robbery, and told me that I probably was just being lured over so that I could be knocked out and they could rob the rest of the apartment. I… I really didn’t think anything of it.”

We sat there in silence for a few moments as we let the story settle in. “Did you hear them enter or exit your apartment?” I asked, though I was pretty sure I knew what we were dealing with.

“Well, no. We also live on the third story. I have always just… assumed they climbed, or something?” He sounded more like a little kid, desperate for their parents to believe his wild stories.

I stood up after a moment, patting my knees to break the silence, and I think the man just about jumped out of his own skin at the sound. “Thank you, \[REDACTED\]. That was much more helpful than you could know,” I told him, nodding and offering my hand to the man. After he hesitantly shook it, I exited, and found Lincoln standing near the one way glass. I just about passed him on my way out of the dimly lit hallway before he stopped me with a question.

“Did- was he helpful?” His voice sounded hesitant, and I figured he just wanted a placating answer, so I simply nodded and said “Absolutely.”

“Good, good. I take it that you know what you're dealing with?” He continued, immediately as I closed my mouth. I smiled at his nervousness and shrugged.

Trying to exit the awkward conversation, “At this point, I've got a few ideas knocking around up here. Gotta go talk with my partner,” I told him, and turned from Lincoln and started making my way back to the main portion of the precinct. He didn't follow.

I found John sitting in an office chair in a currently unoccupied portion of the precinct. Mind you, from the piles of papers around him, it seemed as if he had simply stolen one of the desks of an officer and no one had been brave enough to approach my partner since.

“You find anything?” I started, “Because man oh man, do I have something to share.” John looked up at me as he held up a yellow folder filled with enough files to be almost a foot thick. I just shook my head. Officially, we weren't supposed to take evidence from the police, but honestly they didn't care. As I said earlier, most would rather pretend that things that went bump in the night were cats, dogs, or criminals. Those things, at least, they could bully.

As we took our leave from the precinct, I could feel everyone's eyes on our backs. John turned around, and I was about to stop him from saying anything before I felt it too. Instinct is a thing you can train, it's something that our ancestors utilized to hunt, and avoid being hunted. Something in that room wanted us dead, that much I was sure of. As John scanned the room, most diverted their eyes. No one stepped forward or looked aggressively towards us, and so after a moment, I put my hand on his shoulder and told him that we should leave. He shrugged me off and walked to the car, jumping into the driver's seat. As we pulled out, Lincoln stepped outside and gave us a solitary wave, one which I replicated.

We spent the rest of that night eating Chinese food and looking over the case files in our motel room. The Project certainly had money to spend, but spend it did not on travel expenses. I told John about what I had heard from \[REDACTED\], and he came to the same conclusion that I had. An Imposter. Interesting creatures, one of the few that you were actually likely to find in a city like this. They could imitate things, almost perfectly. There was always something you could point towards as them being off. Face shape, bad walk, nonsensical sentences, you get the gist. What neither of us could understand was why they were actually taking pieces from their victims. So far as we understand Imposters, they don’t like to eat like you or me. They can sustain themselves on our food, but far and beyond their favorite meal is the fear of their victims. They crave it, the moment when they’re looking into the eyes of someone who thinks they know them when they’re really something else. There’s been cases of an Imposter impersonating someone for weeks, slowly trying to drive their victim insane. They tend to go for more simple attacks though, impersonating someone you know and using that to generate more emotion in your last moments.

As John was looking over the cases again, I was just staring at the gruesome pictures of the victims. It seemed to me desecration of the bodies changed course after the third victim, and seemed to become more ritualistic than anything. There was a weird gap between the third and fourth victims that I kept going back to - It seemed that for no reason at all our Imposter had suddenly taken a massive interest in the anatomy of people. The first three were very normal Imposter murders: The victim is killed in the slowest way that they can muster with its own physical body. Strangulation. As I stared at the photos, two things finally hit me: the portions of the bodies were different every single time, and that they weren’t in order. The most recently discovered body made little sense when it comes to the timeline. 

Why did the creature suddenly return back to their brutish ways, but instead what if it had been the inciting incident to change their course? The body portions though, that was the part that scared me. Why had they been looking at different portions of human flesh? What did they find so intriguing about the way that our meat connected to our bones? I stared at the pictures for a little while longer before a horrifying idea came to my mind. Were they attempting to perfect their imitation?

Thoughts raced through my head. Were they back at the precinct with us? Obviously, I doubt that a police officer suddenly had been planning on killing the two of us. They had been watching the cases, that’s the only reasonable explanation I can think of. Whatever they discovered when they cracked open that poor man's skull open intrigued the Imposter enough to change their pattern. Who had they been in there? Lincoln? No, he had spoken to me normally enough. They must’ve simply been one of the dozens of other officers in the room. Realistically, there was no way to tell without inspecting every man in that building. I looked over at John at that point, about to open my mouth to speak my thoughts, but paused, looking at my partner. 

We had been separated for… how long? I didn’t have an exact time. Five minutes? Ten? His eyes flashed across the files as my internal debate roared. Finally, he looked up at me, having noticed that I was staring bullets through his skull. 

“What?” He asked, putting down the files and taking another bite of the takeout.

“Say, you remember our first case together?” I asked him, trying to be as subtle as possible. From the shift in his demeanor, I had failed horribly. He sat up, having had his feet kicked up onto the desk but now planted solidly on the floor. His hands were laced together as he arched an eyebrow towards me. I put down the pictures and turned my back towards him so he couldn’t see my eyes. I couldn’t give away any hints. What if they had figured out a way to remove their one weakness? Was that why they had been studying the bodies? A perfect Imposter. The thought chilled me to the bone. 

I spoke again, “Just… humor me. Please.”

My partner sighed as I could hear him drumming his fingers on the desk. “We’re coming up with a code word after this,” He said lamely, apparently buying time as he tried to recall the case facts that I was prying him for. After a time, he spoke again, his voice wavering just a little, uncertain of the information that it carried. “It was a ghost. A lynching down in the south, the thing was haunting the people who had killed it.” Imposters couldn’t gain memories from their chosen bodies, and though I believed at the time that this one was evolving, I had little choice but to trust John. 

I nodded and turned back towards him, sitting on my bed. “Fairs fair, ask me one.” I wracked my hands, and his eyes betrayed nothing, though neither of his hands were visible, and I knew what that meant. I didn’t have my gun on me, I didn’t like carrying it around the room with me, opting to leave it by the nightstand instead. John, however, never so much as pissed without the damn thing.

“What’s your daughter's name?” He questioned, his eyes searching my face for any slip of a possible mask. 

I, in turn, snorted and muttered a simple, “Don’t have one.”

He sighed and leaned back in his chair, his hand off of his gun. “Code word is ‘Red Sox’, got it?”

I shared what I suspected with John that night, and he had little to contradict what I proposed. He praised me for trying to rule him out as a suspect, though admonished me for not grabbing my gun first. We returned to the precinct the next morning, claiming it was to return the case files that he had ‘accidentally’ taken with us for the evening. As John was going through the process of bureaucratic bullshit, I was walking around the room, looking at everyone who was there. I took note of the cops that I could remember who were at the scene the previous night and asked them if any of the others there had been acting oddly, but I came away with nothing. The two of us were looking for a needle in the world's largest haystack.

John suggested our next breakthrough a few days later. We were meeting with two agents on their way to go deal with some sort of ghost boat in Maine. I’m still not entirely sure what was going on with that, but at some point near the end of our chat, John turned to look at me with a look that screamed, “I’m a damn genius!” He rushed the rest of the conversation and chugged his coffee, rushing me to finish my own as well and hastily walked towards the car to have the conversation in private.

“We don’t need to look through every single person in the city. We just need to look for people with lovers, or others who live with them,” He hurriedly said, pulling out of the cafe. 

I considered his idea for a moment before objecting, “That’s still hundreds of thousands of people, John.” But to this he already had a counter.

“That would be true, if we didn’t already have a sample size of about a hundred souls.” I knew the roads he was taking. Back to the police precinct.

I stared at the road for a moment, considering how we were going to go about this. Most likely, there was already a dead officer, and the Imposter had been coming in for them for some time now. After a moment, I spoke. “We’ll have to ask Lincoln about who has partners. They’re not allowed to officially keep that sort of information. Probably for their addresses too.” I knew Lincoln wasn’t going to like the idea, but he might be more helpful if he believed that one of his men might be replaced.

“Don’t ask him first,” John said after a moment. I was silent, but knew he was right, and I didn’t want to think about it. The man that I had spoken to seemed like too much of a human being to be what we were hunting, but at this stage of the investigation, we couldn’t afford any slips in the net that we were attempting to cast. “We’ll follow him home, and after we can assure that he’s not our bastard, we can take the next step,” John continued, pulling into the parking lot of the large building. 

Inside of there, there was a monster who was killing people in the most terrifying way he knew. He could be any one of them. My mind flashed to the faces that I had inspected a few days prior. He had been listening to our conversations, possibly had been within a few feet of us. How easy it could have been for them to follow us out of the building and find our motel, sneak in while we were sleeping, and replace one of us then. I shivered at the thought, and felt pity for the poor soul who had probably gone through something akin to that in their last moments who we were now attempting to avenge.

John, for his part, was ecstatic at having come to his conclusion before I had. He was only ever excited when he felt like he was close to finishing a hunt. He once told me that he could taste it when he was ahead of a creature. Like blood in the water, he said. It scared me then, it scares me now. His foot was eagerly bumping up and down, thumping quietly against the floor of the car as he stared in anticipation towards the doors, waiting for the time of the next stage of our hunt to begin. We had arrived in the middle of the day, and waited there for the rest of it, yet his anticipation of the hunt never waned.

Eventually, Officer Lincoln excited the building. He was one of the first, not particularly surprising to me, as sergeants tended to be able to choose what days they were going to leave early. We had moved out of the direct parking lot at my suggestion, instead sitting around the corner as we watched the doors from afar. The man looked around as he entered his car. John followed at a respectable distance, and we eventually arrived at Lincoln’s apartment building. We watched him enter, ourselves not far behind, and then later watched his door for a long while before feeling confident that he was not our creature. The neighbors claimed that Lincoln was a single man, having never married nor taken a partner that they could recall. Can always trust old lady gossip, and we told everyone to just stay inside if they heard something tonight. 

I knocked on his door, and John stood not far behind me. When Lincoln failed to open the door, or respond after a second knock, John pushed me aside and kicked in the door with a single motion. The Project gives us certain protection when it comes to the law, mainly that no one had any fucking clue what we were and so tended to pretend like any transgressions that we may have committed simply didn't happen.

The inside of Lincoln's apartment looked quiet and still, as though forgotten by the world. We both drew our weapons and began to inspect the place. There was a layer of dust coating the entirety of the first room, which contained a couch and a small table with coffee stains. Silently, John motioned that he would inspect the hallway leading towards the bedroom, and that I would examine the kitchen and dining room. The moonlight streamed in through the windows, illuminating the appliances and dishes that had been left in the sink. The fridge was off, and I could smell the rancid smell of rotting food from within. As I stepped into the dining room, I could see Lincoln sitting at the table, the moonlight upon him like a spotlight. I felt the hair on the back of my neck raise, and immediately knew the man was dead. His head was lowered and his hands together as if in a final reverie. 

I stepped into the room, and immediately felt something shift to my left, causing my instincts screamed at me to move. Sliding my foot forward, I almost managed to slip the punch thrown at my head by ‘Officer Lincoln’. His eyes were wild and eager, and he had an insane man’s grin on his face. 

“John!” I hollered for my partners help as the third and fourth punches flew towards me. His fists were blindingly fast, my head was already throbbing from the first punch. He knocked the gun from my hands, but I managed to grab onto his arm and throw the two of us to the ground. 

We landed with a wet slap, his body distorting. He seemed less amused as I managed to throw a punch in return, straddling his hips. I was tossed off of him with ease. Slamming into the wall, I gasped for breath, doubled over. As I recovered, he started to change further.

His face, once the squat and strong jawed face of Lincoln, stretched. The smile remained. Bones and cartilage under the skin popped and broke, blood flowed freely from his nose. His hair pulled itself back into his skull, black hair replaced it. His eyes melted from his head as new ones took form. He fell to the ground as his arms and legs shook and began to reform, the sounds of wet snapping and meat tearing all too audible from across the room. Ligaments and bones broke and twisted, his police uniform absorbing into his body as a black suit - my suit - was pushed into place. I looked back at myself as John entered the room, his gun sweeping back and forth between me and the Imposter.

“Well?! Shoot it!” the Imposter croaked out in my voice, frantic and convincingly injured. John looked at me, and before I even had the chance to say the code word, he turned his gun to the creature on the floor and shot him four times. He didn't stir. I stared at John in shock as he holstered his gun, the silence and two dead bodies in the room being our only companions. 

We stood like that for what must've been half a minute or more before I finally pushed myself off the wall. “Red Sox…” I muttered, walking over to where my gun had been knocked and put it back in its place. John just grunted and walked over to the Imposter, kicking him to make sure he was dead. I checked on the body of Lincoln, and sure enough, his throat had been cut open with surgical precision. I turned back to John as he looked up at me, a triumphant smile on his face. 

I almost said something, but suddenly there was a sound like a log of wood being split and he was against the wall with a long, pale, dripping limb around his throat. John clawed at the appendage with one hand, and reached for his gun with the other. The Imposter stood, the new arm having broken through his, my, ribcage.

His head had become that of a wolf, snarling at the two of us as his body creaked and broke, changing further. New limbs tore themselves free from his flesh as hands grabbed at me and John. I shot the arm that had him by his neck and it recoiled in pain momentarily, dropping my partner onto the ground. Immediately, John shot the Imposter in the face three more times, each subsequent bullet seeming to do nothing but anger it further. 

We retreated from the room as the Imposter tried growing legs to support the hulking mass of arms, fingers, and bones that now protruded from his form. As we entered the kitchen, dozens of arms and claws followed after us, each squelching with whatever juice coated the Imposter’s newly created limbs. John shot him again, and I had an idea.

“Just keep running!” I shouted at him. We crashed into the living room and began pulling towards the door. The Imposter lugged himself into the room on legs of rats, men, and birds. He had grown wings in a desperate attempt to lighten his load. In the seconds after he burst into the room, he didn’t stop changing. One moment, he had fur, the next scales, then flesh again. New arms grew and disappeared back into his body just as quickly, each one creating a new sound of fleshy tearing. 

As we ran into the hall, the amalgamation followed, growing longer arms and more hands to try and grab at us. John kicked in the stairwell door, we sprinted down the stairs as fast as our legs would carry us. The Imposter simply kept growing and growing. He didn't even bother with skin anymore as muscle and bone was all he needed to hurt us. He simply focused on expanding further and further, new flesh torn from the body in bursts.We reached the ground floor and almost crashed into the doors, which for some reason were locked. I turned back towards the Imposter and prepared to try and say something as John shot him another few times. 

He had reached the ground floor and had stopped his expansion, more wormlike than any recognizable creature as arms, legs, and other unidentifiable limbs poked out of his wet body in every direction. His head, half wolf and half pink flesh, opened and laughed at our defeat. The sound echoed through his body, reverberating up the stairs as he stretched towards us one final time. Then, a sound filled the air, like thousands of voices screaming out in pain at once as a wet squelch tore through the Imposter, as he stretched himself just an inch too far, and he tore himself open. 

John and I were coated in blood and God knows what else, as was the stairwell and the hallway. There was another moment of silence before he laughed triumphantly and swatted my back. I stared at the larger remains of the Imposter, but they evaporated quickly. “I think that's a first for an Imposter. I wonder if he even was one, or something else.” I muttered, running my hand down my arm and wiping the red gore off of me.

“Don't care. That's for the egg heads to figure out.” John responded, already fiddling with the door. Turned out it just had a latch we needed to pop up, one that we had missed in the adrenaline of the moment. We took a few breaths of fresh air before returning back to the apartment building, but the body of the Imposter was completely gone. The only remains were the new coating of red paint and putrid smell that infused the hallway. We left back to the motel to wash off. Surprisingly, it cleaned up much easier than blood does. John’s smile was present the rest of the night.

I didn't ask the rest of the residents on that floor what they heard, only tipped off the police what they'd find at Lincoln's apartment. The two of us had coffee one more time in the city, deciding to stall as much as we could before leaving to go back to HQ to fill out the necessary paperwork. Don't ask, it's more annoying than you might assume. I still felt dirty and coated with the gore of the Imposter, but it’s honestly not the worst thing that I’ve been submerged in, and so I tried to just ignore the feeling.

“I’m surprised that bullets didn’t kill it.” John spoke in a conspiratorial tone, and examined one of the recovered rounds that he had dug out of the wall. I gave it a quick glance, but simply shrugged.

I couldn’t get the memory of my body lying on the floor, dead, and bleeding out from gunshot wounds in my head, and so I asked the only question that I hoped could solve my problem. “How did you know?”

“You never dehumanize the damn things.” He took a sip of his coffee and turned to face me. “You’d have never called it an ‘it’. Just connected that in the moment.” 

I could tell he was judging me for this, but I was proud that he noticed. I put a lot of effort into not becoming little more than an executioner of the paranormal.

Nodding, I broke eye contact and ordered some pie from the waitress. “Just… next time, wait until I actually confirm the code.” The burden on my back felt lifted slightly, though I couldn’t tell why. Perhaps it was because I didn’t feel like my partner had taken a 50/50 chance on my life.

“You got it. Though, next time, try to not get beaten to the punch when asking for me to shoot.” He chuckled and stole a bite of my pie. 

I miss that stupid bastard.

That makes for two of these that I’ve recorded. Keep an eye out for the strange and listen to your body. It knows the signs of these creatures better than you do. The Project is still out there, keeping things under wraps. As new technology becomes more popular, it's a wonder that they’ve been as successful as they have been. I wonder if \[REDACTED INFORMATION\].

**>ADDITIONAL NOTES -**

It took me a long time to find more of Fletcher’s files, but I finally did. They used a lot of these as training material, just blotted out some of his personal notes. Imposters have become more coordinated in the past few years, and interactions similar to Fletcher’s are becoming more common. I think something is teaching them how to recreate these types of results. Another thing of concern was the fact that it was likely the Imposter who had contacted the Project in the first place. Was it intending on trying to infiltrate us?
