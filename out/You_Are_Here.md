It started out as a normal shopping trip, nothing out of the ordinary had happened, and I was almost about finished for the day. I only had one store left that I needed to visit before I could say I was done. I honestly don’t remember which store it was—it’s not important—but I wasn’t entirely sure of where it was. I didn’t really feel like walking around aimlessly looking for it, and I could see one of those store-maps near me—you know the ones. I walked over to it and found the red star marked “YOU ARE HERE”, and started looking for whatever store it was that I needed.

As I scanned the map, I noticed something… strange. Somewhere on the map, the other floor, it looked like, was a red dot, similar to the star labeling the location of this map, but this one was labeled: “HE IS HERE”.

I was, confused, to say the least, but, I don’t know—what was I supposed to do about it? I was tired, and just wanted to be done, so I found the store I was looking for and started making my way over. I was fairly confident that I knew where I was going, so I didn’t feel the need to check the maps again until I reached the end of the mall without seeing it. I walked back down, thinking that I must have missed it but…

I don’t know how to describe it. The mall seemed to be… changing. I began to see less people and, not knowing what else to do, I checked the map again. The layout was definitely different, and even worse… the red dot that had been marked “HE IS HERE” was now in a different spot and seemed… closer. Almost as if “He” had moved…

At this point I was definitely freaked out, and my errands weren’t so important that I couldn’t wait, so I decided to just leave. I was feeling increasingly uneasy, and figured that it had to be getting dark out by now, so I started trying to make my way back to the escalator, as I had originally entered on the first floor and gone up to the second. But… as I wandered around, seeing less and less people, there *were* no escalators. None.

I started to panic a bit, and decided that I would simply take the first exit I found, even if I had to walk all the way around the building to get to my car. Maybe you can guess where this is going by now but… the exits were gone. All of them. The longer I walked, the less the building I was in resembled a mall, and the more it resembled a very large industrial… something. Plant? Factory? I’m not sure what to call it but as I wandered it, I noticed the maps again. I found the dot. HE IS HERE—even closer now. He was definitely moving.

I didn’t know who “He” was or why the maps were tracking him, but I sure as heck didn’t want to stick around to find out. I began to walk faster, now on a mission to just get out as fast as possible. I couldn’t help but check every map I passed. He was definitely following me.

I made my way down a dark maze of long concrete hallways, occasionally finding rooms of various sizes, all of which I made a point to search, but never for long—one look at the map was enough to make me wrap up my search and keep moving. He was gaining on me.

It’s worth noting—He wasn’t taking my exact route, in fact, the way he was moving around made it feel as if He was tracking me the same way that I was tracking Him; By the maps. Still—I got the feeling that He was familiar with the ever-changing layout of the building, either that, or he was just running quickly and using the maps as a guide to catch up to my location. I’m not sure which thought would be more terrifying.

At one point, I found a large set of double doors. *Wooden* doors. I’m not sure why that fact bothered me. Everything else had become industrial—metal and concrete—so the fact that these large doors were made of wood sent a strange chill of unease down my spine. Still, I pushed them open, and heard a painfully loud creak as I did. I was worried that He would hear me and would be able to find me as a result. I think that’s why I didn’t run. I didn’t want to be heard.

Behind those strange wooden doors, I saw… shipping crates? I was now standing in a large warehouse type area that was filled with crates of all kinds; from the large shipping crates that you would find on oversea cargo ships to small wooden crates that were shorter than I was. Most of them were marked with number codes, bar codes, or other text that strangely… wasn’t in English. As I looked around at the cargo around me, I didn’t see a word of English. In fact, most of the words I saw were in languages that I didn’t recognize at all. I mean, it was definitely *language*, and there were at least a few crates per language so I could make out patterns and order enough to determine that they were definitely coherent, but I had never seen any of it before.

I suppose it didn’t really matter that much if I recognized them or not—I couldn’t speak anything besides English anyway—I just found it odd, but I didn’t have time to dwell on it if I wanted to. There was another map in the center of the room. I crossed over to it.

HE IS HERE—right outside the door.

I have never felt more raw fear in my life I swear to you I could *feel* the pure malevolent aura of… *HIM*. I don’t know who He is, I never saw Him. But He was there. He was in that room with me.

I couldn’t go back out the same doors I came in through since He was there, so I moved as quickly and soundlessly as I could further into the warehouse.

Just as the mall had before, the warehouse seemed to change. The ceiling got taller, the walls became wider, until soon I could not see either. It wasn’t…foggy, exactly, but there was a strange haze around everything. I suppose that could’ve been part of the reason that I could no longer see the walls or the ceiling, but I swear that the room had become endless. Just a void filled with crates and maps.

The maps started to get a little more frequent, which worried me. The easier it was for me to see His location, the easier it was for Him to see mine.

I stopped again to look at a map, and my blood ran cold.

HE IS HERE—Just on the other side of the large crate that I was standing next to. I’ve never panicked so much in my life, I just ran—sprinted—as fast and quietly as I could in the other direction. I couldn’t hear Him but I could feel Him. I could feel His presence behind me. I tried to duck and swerve around crates, trying to lose him. I glanced at every map that I passed. HE IS HERE. Closer. HE IS HERE. In front of me. HE IS HERE. To my left.

I don’t know how long this went on for. I don’t know how long I ran. All I know is at some point, I had to stop. I had to catch my breath and when I did, I looked at the nearest map.

YOU ARE HERE.

But… where is He?

I scanned the map over and over again. I couldn’t find Him. Was He gone? No. No, he wasn’t. He couldn’t be—I could still feel Him. So where was He? At first I thought that I couldn’t catch my breath because of how I’d been running. Then I realized that I was hyperventilating. For some reason, the fact that I couldn’t find Him was more terrifying than being chased by him. At least then I had known where he was. Now…

I turned away from the map and scanned the area around me. There was nothing. So why was I shaking so bad?

I turned back to the map.

HE IS HERE—wait… wasn’t He supposed to be the dot? I thought I was supposed to be the st—
