I need to document this while I still can. While the walls of my apartment still maintain their proper dimensions. While I can still trust that when I turn around, the door will be where I left it.

Let me be clear. I am **not** mentally ill. I have never experienced hallucinations or delusions. I've never taken psychedelics or any other mind-altering substances. What I'm about to describe actually happened, and it continues to happen, and I'm afraid it will never stop happening.

[I discovered a path in my apartment that shouldn't exist.]{.smallcaps}

---

It started three weeks ago. I had just moved into a new apartment building on Ash Street. One of those renovated industrial spaces with exposed brick and ductwork. Nothing special, not particularly old or historic. Built in the 90s according to the realtor.

The layout was simple: living room connected to kitchen, small hallway leading to bedroom and bathroom. Approximately 780 square feet according to the floor plan[^1].

[^1]: Though I've since measured it myself, and it's actually 767.3 square feet. This discrepancy seemed insignificant at the time.

I noticed it first when I was unpacking boxes in the bedroom. A thing in my peripheral vision, like a doorway where there shouldn't be one. But when I turned to look, nothing. Just the plain white wall beside my closet.

Three days later, it happened again. This time while I was brushing my teeth. I could have sworn there was a doorway reflected in the bathroom mirror, just over my shoulder. But when I spun around, nothing.

On the seventh night, I woke at exactly 3:17 AM. The digital clock on my nightstand cast a red glow across the room, illuminating what appeared to be

~~a doorway~~

~~an opening~~

~~an absence~~

a *negation* in the wall where there had been only solid surface before.

I sat up in bed, fully awake now. The opening was roughly door-sized, though its edges seemed to waver slightly, as if I were viewing it through heat distortion. Beyond it was darkness. Not the darkness of an unlit room, but a darkness that seemed to swallow light.

I reached for my phone to use as a flashlight, but when I looked back, the wall was solid again.

---

I told no one. What would I say? "Excuse me, but there's an impossible doorway appearing in my apartment at night"? Even I didn't believe it was real, not then. I blamed it on the stress of moving, on the unfamiliarity of a new space playing tricks on my mind.

But it kept happening. And it began to change.

The next time I saw it was two nights later, again at 3:17 AM exactly. This time, it wasn't just an opening, it was a *hallway*. A hallway that stretched far beyond what the physical dimensions of my building should allow[^2].

[^2]: I later checked the building plans at the city records office. The wall where I kept seeing the hallway borders directly on my neighbor's apartment. There's no space for anything between our units.

I got out of bed. Approached it slowly.

The hallway was narrow. Perhaps three feet wide with walls, floor, and ceiling all the same matte black material that seemed to absorb light rather than reflect it. My phone's flashlight beam penetrated only a few feet before dissipating into the darkness.

I took one step inside.

Then another.

The air was cold and oddly still. No sound except my breathing, which seemed too loud in that quiet space.

A third step.

And then I heard it. A soft scraping sound, like something heavy being dragged across the floor. It was coming from deep within the hallway, from the darkness beyond my light's reach.

I backed out immediately. As soon as I crossed the threshold back into my bedroom, the hallway folded in on itself, collapsing like a piece of paper being crumpled, and disappeared.

The wall was solid once more.

---

I didn't sleep that night. Or the next. I considered moving out, but my lease was for twelve months and the penalty for breaking it was severe. Besides, where would I go? How could I explain to a new landlord why I was leaving so soon after moving in?

So I stayed. And I began to document.

I set up cameras in my bedroom, facing the wall where the hallway appeared. I measured the dimensions of my apartment obsessively, multiple times a day. I researched the history of the building, the land it was built on, previous tenants.

Nothing unusual. Nothing that explained what I was experiencing.

The cameras showed nothing. Just a solid wall all night long. Yet I continued to see the hallway, always at 3:17 AM, always in the same place.

And I continued to explore it.

Each night, I ventured a little farther down the hallway. Five steps. Ten. Twenty. The hallway seemed to go on indefinitely, always straight ahead, never turning or branching.

Until last night.

---

Last night, I walked for what felt like hours[^3], though when I returned, only minutes had passed according to my phone. The darkness of the hallway seemed to deepen the farther I went, until my flashlight was barely cutting through it at all.

[^3]: I've begun to suspect that time moves differently within the hallway. My watch stopped working as soon as I stepped inside, and my phone's clock freezes at 3:17 AM until I exit.

And then the hallway ended.

Not in a wall or door, but in a vast, open space. A room so large that my light couldn't illuminate the ceiling or the far walls. The floor was the same matte black material as the hallway, but it wasn't flat. It seemed to undulate slightly, as if it were breathing.

In the center of this room was a staircase. It spiraled downward, each step the same featureless black as everything else. I couldn't see the bottom.

I approached the edge and shined my light down. The stairs descended far beyond what should be possible given the height of my building from ground level.

That scraping sound came again. Louder now, and accompanied by something else. A rhythmic thumping, like heartbeats, but too slow to be human. And voices. Distant, muffled, speaking in what might have been whispers or might have been screams.

They were coming from below.

I didn't take the stairs. Not last night. But I think I will tonight.

Because here's the thing that terrifies me most: *my apartment is changing*.

---

The measurements don't match anymore. Each day, the total square footage is slightly less than the day before. Walls that were once parallel now meet at subtle angles. Corners that were once 90 degrees are now slightly acute or obtuse.

My apartment is folding in on itself, collapsing inward like the hallway did that first night, but in slow motion. And as it shrinks, the hallway grows. It's appearing earlier each night. 3:16, then 3:15. Soon, I think it will be there all the time.

I believe the hallway has always been there. Not just in my apartment, but in everyone's. In every space. We just don't see it because we're not looking for it. We've trained ourselves to see only what makes sense, what fits within our understanding of spatial geometry.

But once you see it, you can't unsee it. And it begins to see you too.

Last night, when I returned from the edge of the stairs and the hallway disappeared behind me, I noticed something on my bedroom wall where the hallway had been.

Words, written in what looked like black ink, though they seemed to shimmer slightly as if still wet

**YOU'RE NEXT**

{^UPDATE - 7:42 PM}

I'm writing this from my phone at a motel about fifty miles from my apartment. I couldn't stay there any longer, not after what happened this afternoon.

I decided to take the stairs tonight. I've set an alarm for 3:10 AM. I don't know if I'll be able to post again after that.

But I need to document what happened today, in case... in case someone else starts seeing the hallway too.

After posting this morning, I tried to distract myself. I went to work (I'm a graphic designer, I work remotely), tried to focus on a client project. But I couldn't stop thinking about the hallway, about the stairs, about what might be at the bottom.

Around 2 PM, I heard a noise from my bedroom. A soft scraping sound. The same sound I'd heard from deep within the hallway.

I approached my bedroom slowly. The door was open just a crack, though I was certain I'd left it fully open earlier. Through the narrow opening, I could see that my bedroom was dark, despite the afternoon sun that should have been streaming through the windows.

When I pushed the door open, what I saw wasn't my bedroom at all.

It was the vast room with the spiral staircase.

But it wasn't night anymore. Somehow, there was illumination, though I couldn't identify the source. And I could see now that the walls of this impossible space weren't blank as I'd initially thought. They were covered in thousands, maybe millions, of symbols, etched or carved into what looked like black stone.

The symbols seemed to shift and change whenever I tried to focus on them directly, but from my peripheral vision, they almost resembled[^4]:

[^4]: I've attempted to sketch them in my journal, but they change each time I look away.

1. ⊗⊕⊙∰⚙
2. ⟿⟴⟳⟲⥀⥁
3. ⌬⏣⏥⏢⌌⌍

And standing at the edge of the staircase was a figure.

It was tall, at least seven feet, and thin to the point of emaciation. Its limbs were too long, joints bent at unnatural angles. It wasn't facing me, but I could tell it was aware of my presence.

Slowly, agonizingly, it began to turn. I didn't wait to see its face. I slammed the door shut and ran.

By the time I reached my front door, I heard my bedroom door opening behind me. I didn't look back. I just ran.

I've been driving ever since, stopping only for gas and to check into this motel.

But here's the thing. 

The motel room has the same layout as my apartment. Same placement of doors, same dimensions^[2].

[2]: ^I've measured it. 767.3 square feet, exactly.^

And the wall beside the closet... it's developing a slight curve, as if being pushed from the other side.

It's 7:58 PM now. Over seven hours until 3:17 AM. I don't think I can wait that long.

I think I'm going to see if the hallway will appear earlier if I look for it. If I *want* it to appear.

After all, I believe that's how it works. It's always been there. We just don't see it because we're not looking for it.

I'm looking for it now.

---

{^FINAL UPDATE - 9:15 PM}

I found it. Or it found me.

The hallway is here, in my motel room. The door appeared as soon as I started searching for it. Not in the wall, but in the floor, like a trapdoor that was always there beneath the worn carpet.

I'm going down the stairs now. I can hear something moving below, coming up to meet me.

If you're reading this, if you start seeing odd angles in your home, if things begin to linger where they shouldn't, if you feel like there's a space that shouldn't exist—

Don't look for it.

But I think it's too late for that warning, isn't it? Because now that I've told you about it, you'll start to notice. You'll see the places where your walls don't quite meet at right angles. You'll feel the slight difference in the air pressure when you enter certain rooms.

You'll know it's there, waiting.

I'm sorry.

I hear footsteps on the stairs now, coming up.

They're not mine.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
