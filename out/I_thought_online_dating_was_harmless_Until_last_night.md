I’m a trucker, driving at night across endless highways, lit only by my truck’s headlights and empty rest stops. Most of the time I listen to music or podcasts, sometimes I nod off at the wheel, sometimes I think about nothing at all. But I have this app on my phone. A little distraction on long stretches of road, no big expectations.

Then she showed up. “Mara.” Profile picture: smiling, dark hair, eyes that seemed to hold secrets you’d rather not know. I swiped right. She did too. We started messaging. At first, harmless: “Where are you?” “Rest stop on the interstate.” Short messages, a little flirting.

Then the messages got more intense.

“I love it when men drive at night.”  
“Alone?”  
“Not always. But alone is more fun.”

I laughed at her messages, a little nervous, but not worried. I was sure she was somewhere in town, probably just a little crazy. Cool. Exciting.

We set up a meeting. I have no idea why. She insisted it had to be spontaneous. I kept driving down the interstate, lights like stars on asphalt. My truck rumbled, the night was quiet. I checked my phone again. She wrote:

“I see you.”

I laughed. “Huh?”  
“From the window. I see your light.”

I shook my head. Probably a bad joke. But then I got a photo. And it was my truck, taken from outside. Headlights on, license plate visible. I was driving alone on the highway. No one around. No rest areas, no buildings.

“Where are you?” I typed, panicked.

“Not far. I’m coming to get you.”

I laughed nervously. “No, no. I’m not meeting anyone on the road.”

She didn’t reply for hours. Then a picture. The photo showed the back of my truck, just a few feet behind me, in the rearview mirror. A shadow of a person. No one else on the road. I stopped briefly, turned around. Nothing. Just darkness.

I drove on. My heart was racing. I had deleted the app, turned off my phone. But her name popped up on my screen again: Mara. Message:

“Why are you running?”

I floored it. Tank full, interstate empty, night so black I could barely see the road. I tried to think, stay rational. Maybe a stalker? Maybe a prank? Maybe someone driving the same route—sure, that made sense.

But then she showed up again. In the curves, in the distance, sometimes just a light following my truck. I thought I was imagining things. I’m tired, the night drags on, my eyes burn. But her light stayed. Always behind me. Always keeping pace.

I tried to avoid rest stops. Every station, every gas stop—she was there. I didn’t see her directly, just her car, always parked, always off to the side. She sent messages:

“Why aren’t you stopping?”  
“I want to see you.”  
“I want you to see me.”

My pulse raced. I was alone on the highway, mile after mile, and the little car followed me, perfectly timed to the night. I couldn’t call anyone, no signal out here. I couldn’t take an exit. She knew where I was going.

Then I stopped. Just like that. Engine off, headlights off. Everything silent. My heart pounding so loud I thought she could hear it. Minutes passed. I didn’t dare get out of the truck. And then I heard footsteps. On the asphalt, close. Someone coming toward me. I couldn’t see who. Just a whisper:

“Finally.”

I started the engine, tore off. She never showed up. But on my phone—the app open, a new message:

“Fun game. We’ll continue if you want.”

And now I’m sitting here, at a rest stop somewhere along endless highways, night, trucker life. I’m writing this because I know she’ll find me. I don’t know how. I don’t want to know how. But something in her is thrilled that I’m driving. That I’m out here at night.

And I know I’ll be driving again tomorrow night.
