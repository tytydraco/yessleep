Jesus, can my dad hurry up and find this goddamn hot glue gun? I muttered, standing shivering in the dimly lit hallway. January oppressed me with its chill, and each gust held the heating captive. The sound of the wind overpowered the rummaging in the garage, he was taking his sweet time. I pointed my foot like a ballerina, nudged the front door to leave only a small crack, and kept my hands firmly crossed in the warmth of my arms. I jumped as a howl of wind swung the door open, knocking dozens of coats from the rack, and shoving the pitch-black nothingness into my vision. Strange. I guess I hadn’t realized the wind was so bad, it must have picked up since my usual walk earlier that day. 

"What the hell happened out here?” he grunted as he stepped over the pile, holding the decades-old arts box in his hand.

 “The wind slammed the door shut, is there a storm coming or something?” I replied.

 He served a look of confusion and shook his head.

  “You’ve felt how calm it is today. If you knocked it over it's fine, but you don’t need to lie about it”

 He chuckled in amusement and went off to the kitchen. When he’d left, I outstretched my hand into the air surrounding the house, it was deadly still. I gazed into the darkness and listened for even a swirl of wind in my ear, but there was nothing.

The dreams started that night; their vivid darkness haunted me into the daytime. Each dream was the same, it was me, shivering and cold, then, a forceful gust would force me forward. I'd scream, but the air muffled me, and the echoes ricocheted only in my head. I was helpless. Trying to walk was like drowning in quicksand, I’m pretty sure I was in Hell, surrounding me was a four-dimensional firey haze, I tiptoed on air, and the air walked over me. After what felt like a century of torturous struggle, I'd fall into a pine tree. It was calm there, I could hear my breath in the springtime breeze, and I could move with autonomy. My pain would leak out of me in a thick red gloop and be absorbed by the plants beneath me. The setting was the woods I cut through each day on my morning walks, it was peaceful there, but I couldn’t understand my subconscious brain's desire to paint it as a holy grail.

My struggle expanded from the comfort of an unactual dream to the realness of my physical world. It only happened when I was alone, so I felt crazy, I was trapped and unable to tell anyone that the wind was mocking me. It started with just a slight pressure against my body, leaving me working against the wind to move. It was just like in my dream. It got worse with each passing day. If I opened a window at home, I'd come to find the entire room struck by some insane earthquake, the floor unrecognisable as everything would fall from its place. If I was near a tree, my face would be grazed by sharp thorns. Bins fell into my path making me trip over, foul odours always seemed to graze by me. It was like the wind had some desire for petty crime, and I was the target. Most of that stuff was innocent, the thing that shook me was what happened by the road. There's a windy path near my house with an insanely high speed-limit, given how low visibility the corner is. I was approaching the bend when a gust of wind knocked the air from me, and I landed on the road. The car horn deafened me, as the mini swerved past me, barely missing. I sat on the roadside and wept, my heart still racing, I couldn’t grasp what was happening to me.

After letting the tears dry from my face, I returned home. As I took my shoes off, I watched a young boy slip a flyer for a local talk through my door, running away when he saw me. It was for some guy who had traveled the world, studying anemology and natural landscapes, he was coming to my village tomorrow night. The coincidence was strange, but I felt in my gut that it was my only chance to understand what was happening. I desperately wanted to believe that he would explain the occurrences surrounding me. That way, my rigid understanding of the world wouldn’t need to be altered.  

There must have been a hundred people inside the church, faces I'd seen come and go my whole life. The room was dimly lit with the same candles used for Sunday service, like some strange ritual. The woman lighting the candles kept looking at me with a piercing gaze, I'd never seen her before. I guessed she was intrigued that there was youth in a church. I tried to look away from her. The constant hum of conversation was comforting and filled me with optimism. Voices started to quieten, and I saw a blur in my peripheral vision. someone took the seat next to me at the back, I didn’t turn to greet them and looked at the confident middle-aged man who’d begun introducing himself. Whoever was sat next to me filled the air with the scent of pine and smoke, it distracted me from the hum of speech. It was already complex enough and required effort to sustain concentration in my sleep-deprived state, so I was thrown off. Heaps of time had passed, and still, nothing he said gave me an explanation, I was pretty much relying on him to take questions at the end. Another unidentifiably long period, and then.

“I'm sure you guys have questions; the world is a fascinating place”

 He stood scanning the room for a hand, some passionate dweller. Most people asked about his travels, or his book, or for his autograph. I was the first to ask about the wind. I trembled as I put my hand up, and anxiety consumed me.

“Does wind work as a unanimous force, or can it... branch out on its own?” I trembled.

 The room burst out in laughter, and the walls shrunk around me. He gave me a wordy explanation about how an upwind and downwind start, on gusts of winds and their connection to the sea. He told me nothing I wanted to hear. I slumped down into my seat and felt the same burning gaze from before. Then something nudged my ribcage. I turned to the woman next to me, her mouth didn’t move but a whisper in the air told me,

“Don’t listen to him, the wind can have a mind of its own, you know”

The woman’s eyes were a piercing amber hue, small and round. She had very few eyelashes or eyebrows, and her skin was a milky white. Her hair ran past her ragged clothes and down to the fabric bags she wore as shoes, her sharp and grotesque toenails pointed out from within. By the time I had processed what had or hadn't been said and the spectacle before me, she was gone. I wondered if she was even there at all and left the church in defeat. On the walk home, I could swear I felt her gaze in the air as if she surrounded me. The wind was gentle that night, but it watched me with warning.

 Upon sleeping, my mind awoke, but my body was trapped in its sleeping state. The wind grew loud in my ears and howled me a warning, in an ungodly voice words began to overlap, first “the forest” then stacked on top was “calling” The words were relaying, until screams and cries wailed over the top of it, piercing my ears. I tried to escape but the nightmare was within me, and I couldn’t get out. Images of the woods flashed with a piercing and powerful light and promised to stop if I paid them a visit. threat was thick in the air when I awoke, and it stuck to me like sticky ferns.

Carnation blooms were spread around the grass surrounding the forest, I'd been there for several minutes swallowing down my fear, it wasn’t just that, though. It was the possibility of disappointment, of a life of torment that I couldn’t share with others. I closed my eyes and prayed to the god of luck that he may be on my side. Then, I made the step that would change my life.

It was just like my dream. The same woods that had been local to me since birth now had a new tinge of otherness and richness that changed their demeanour.  I tried to avoid the crunching of leaves as I roamed, I feared offending them. As soon as I stepped into the treeline, the air grew deadly still. There were no chirping birds in the branches, or scuttling bugs on the soil, it felt like it was just me and the woods. Now and then a tree with an odd scripture carved into it would grab my attention, some were in Latin, and others in what looked to be a made-up language. From my reading of “Brighton Rock” in school the words memento Moris stuck out like a sore thumb, and it made me shiver to think what the other languages could be saying. After a while of walking about an uneasiness grew within me, I felt like the trees, or something, were watching me. It was so silent that I was sure I would hear anyone else in the woods, but I didn’t.

 A gust of wind slipped behind my ear and hushed” Turn around” chills engulfed me as I crept sideways to see the same woman from the church yesterday. She stood hovering and goddess-like, with her eyes closed and her long straggly hair flowing with the wind that kept her floating. She approached forwards all ghostlike, moving like some butterfly on a spring day. I was so mesmerised by the impossibility that lay before me that I barely realised the treeline was moving forwards, and I wasn’t touching the ground. She had made us symbiotic, as she moved forwards, as did I, backwards. I could do nothing but stare helplessly, as a melodic hum began to fill the air. Suddenly the treeline disappeared, and a wooden shack flew forward into my vision. I slammed into the back of the building and slid to the ground in agony.  

Pounding. My head was pounding, my mouth was dry, and fear was flowing through my veins. I was still on the floor, only the woman was nowhere to be seen. The first thing I noticed about the hut was its stifling heat, I felt my brain being slowly turned to stew. On the walls were foreign symbols marked in bubbling and rancid blood, brown from the oxygenation. On loosely hung shelves were jars of pickled meats, some had toes or eyes and were all labelled in the same strange language. I gagged and vomited over myself at the sight of it. The smell of the place was putrid, it was like a butcher coming back from vacation when a heatwave had occurred back home. Piercing ringing in my ears. I dropped in and out of consciousness. When I awoke, slightly more sentient, the panic hit in full force. I had no idea where she was but If I waited any longer, I was going to die. Groaning, I forced my body upright, gripping the wooden panes to not pass out. I ran like a mutated dog to the gaps of brightness in the treelines that I could see. The agony writhed and I dropped to a crawl after a while, blood gushing from my head and my stomach groaning. I felt like a moth drawn to the light that would kill me. I didn’t know if she knew I was gone, or if she was after me, a million thoughts raced in my mind until I finally reached the treeline. Everything was still, I took a breath and let my racing mind and vision return, the pure bliss of a spring's day filled me, I was alive. Smiling ignorantly, I launched my hand forward into the air and out of that place, trying to make the last crawl.

Confusion struck me as my fist hit an invisible barrier of air. I tried again. Air. I couldn’t move. I let out a cry of frustration as I swung my body against it, ricocheting backward and into the mouth of the forest. Its branchy teeth crunched on me, and I lay, crying. A bony hand soon gripped my scalp and dragged me by my inches of hair. I didn’t dare fight back, and let fate have its way with me.  

The things I endured and witnessed in those days that she made me her puppet, I have blocked out in my mind. I think my morality has been shredded, and I've forgotten what it's like to be human. She beat my mind black and blue and fed me herbs that gave me dreams far worse than you can imagine. I watched babies be dismembered, heard their cries, and smelt the fumes. I cried and threw up until I was empty inside, fed only what also would hurt me. I do not know how much time passed, but I began to understand her strange language. When she offered me the chance to leave her hut I gave in to her conditions and commands, freedom would be the greatest luxury I could have. She conjured a battered red football and with her long straggly nails flicked it to the corner I was slumped in. I understood her and I limped into the treeline.

The invisible barrier was gone, and I breathed in the freshest air that burnt my throat after so long without it. I stood weakly, and I waited. I thought about the same boy who put the flyer through my door and the pickled jars, and I wept dryly at the thought of what she would do to me. A gush of rebellion seeped into me, rehydrating my mind. I started to limp as far from the treeline as I could get. The atmosphere was blurring as I ran free, I breathed rapidly, not watching where I was going. I turned a corner and came into a park with a group of young children playing football. A gush of wind slapped me across the face, and I tumbled into the middle of them.

I knew what I had to do. Maybe if I brought them all, shed spare me.

“Me and my friends are playing in the forest; do you want to join?”

I revealed the red ball from under my arm. I wanted them to run off, to notice my bruising, and to run for help.

 “Looks like it's been a good match” one of the boys laughed “Sure! We’ll come”

I felt guilt for the fate I was about to bring them into.

 “Just one question though, how did you manage to tumble over so badly?”

I chuckled. “I guess the wind has something against me”
