I don’t know why It happened but I did. 

It was the morning of Tuesday.

I woke up around 6 made some coffee then.

A hour later it happened Alaska has fallen.

Confused idk what happened was this a prank 

Did they get hacked idk it was all a blur to me.

I turn on the news and see that these things. 

Have taken over Alaska and now are coming

 for Florida they travel because of flying 

I don’t know it’s werid the government said 

Stay put but idk do I stay do I run 

I call my family and check if there ok 

They say yes and have seen what happened
 
Is it a invasion they ask, I don’t know maybe 

Sounds crazy 2 hours later Florida has been

 overrun what huh how this is all happening to 

fast i don’t know what to do I don’t know why

 but I can’t trust anyone anymore these things

 monsters I don’t know what they are not

 in California so hearing All this I have a feeling

 I’m next I don’t know the government comes 

back online “ attention people of the United

 States it has come to our attention they we are

 under attack do not panic our military has this

 under control” just then it shuts off fast and

 suddenly wha what happened I think did the

 made It out, just then the tv comes on and the

 president starts speaking it looks like ai, ladies
