The chirpy ringtone and bright blue light of my cell phone woke me up from a deep sleep. I rubbed my eyes and answered. “Hey”, said my brother, “the roads are turning to shit. It’s nothing but ice and snow out here so I’m just just gonna crash at Dave’s. “If mom asks I’m asleep okay?”. I knew the drill. Josh would buy me food if I lied to mom about his whereabouts. I checked my banking app and noticed he hadn’t sent me the money yet. “When are you gonna send me the money for dinner? I want to order something before it gets worse outside”. “I already ordered it for you since you said you wanted pizza. It should be there in about an hour”. “Okay, where’d you get it from?”, I asked, starting to get hungry. “Well most of the chain stores closed early for the weather but there’s some mom and pop shop across town called Al’s Pizza that was still open. I figured I couldn’t be picky with such limited options so I let him know this was fine and he told me he would come home first thing in the morning. 



I turned on my gaming console to pass the time. None of my friends were online which was unusual. Abruptly the lights and TV powered off. “Shit!”, I yelled in frustration. I looked outside. Everything was covered in a thick blanket of snow and it continued to come down. I sighed and turned on my flashlight, heading to the basement to flip the breaker box. No use. I called the recorded line for the electric company and it confirmed there was an outage and it was unknown when this would be resolved. My mom called soon after to check in and I told her everything was okay and Josh was asleep in his room. The last thing mom needed was more stress. She was out of town for a few days taking care of our great aunt. The power being off was annoying but I was safe at home. My stomach rumbled and I remembered the pizza. I had my doubts about it still being on the way from the look of the roads. I tried calling Josh but he didn’t answer. I decided to shrug it off and headed over to the kitchen to find something I could eat with no prep. I eventually settled on some crackers and baby carrots. Not very appetizing but it would do. There wasn’t much to do without the internet and the house was creepily quiet aside from occasional howl of the wind outside. I figured maybe it would be best to go to sleep early so I headed up to my room.



 Just as I was about to lay down for the night, I heard a faint knock. I froze. My heart began pounding until I remembered the pizza. Of course! I walked over to the front door but stopped when I heard another knock. Josh always instructed them to just leave the food there so I didn’t have to answer the door while I was home alone. This is a small pizza shop though, not a big corporation with online ordering, I reminded myself. I opened the door. With the porch light off it was very dark aside from the glow of the snow in the moonlight. The delivery man was tall and slim. I couldn’t see him very well but what I could make out of his face was… unsettling. I know that might sound mean on my part. This man is just trying to do his job and here I am internally critiquing his facial features. But it wasn’t his lack of conventional attractiveness that I noticed. Something about him just felt off-putting. His eyes were wide, almost bulging and his smile was sort of creepy. He had an unnaturally wide grin from the moment I opened the door that never moved. His shoulder length hair was stringy and oily. I tried to act as natural as possible. “Thanks”, I said, reaching for the box. His expression never changed. He barely moved as I took the box. It was almost like his movements were delayed by a few seconds. “Thanks”, he said. I stepped back and shut the door. Chills ran down my spine. That dude was creepy as hell. I shrugged it off and tried to look on the bright side. At least I still got my pizza. 



I had just started eating when there was another knock at the door. My heart sank. I looked out the peephole and could see the man standing there. What the hell did he want? I know my brother already paid him. Maybe he didn’t tip. I waited a few minutes to see if he would go away but he stood almost completely still. I signed and grabbed a few dollars out of my safekeeping box and opened the door. To my surprise he was gone. I signed with relief and stepped back into the warmth of the house. 



After finishing my food I was actually starting to feel tired. I laid down and closed my eyes. It was harder getting to sleep than usual because it was getting colder without heat and I didn’t have any music or podcasts to listen to. I was someone who didn’t enjoy the quiet. Still, I closed my eyes and tried to relax. That's when I heard what I can only describe as a skittering noise. It sounded like multiple sets of legs crawling in unison. I sat up and listened. It was coming from the hallway. I tried to stay as quiet as possible even slowing my breathing. The sound got closer until it sounded like it was right outside my bedroom door then stopped. I was frozen with fear. The logical thing to do probably would’ve been to start looking for something I could use as a weapon if need be but I couldn’t bring myself to move a muscle. The skittering sound returned but went further down the hallway. I heard the door to Dave’s room creak open then close. I quietly looked around my room for something- anything to use to protect myself. I found my pocketknife and a baseball bat. I hesitantly opened the door, trying to be as quiet as possible. I could see traces of snow in the hallway. I considered walking over to Dave’s room and opening the door but decided against it. I crept down the stairs and tried to call Dave. The call wouldn’t go through no matter how many times I tried. “Damn it”, I said under my breath. 



I heard a faint tap at the door which made me jump. I tried my best to keep calm as I approached the peep hole. The tall, slender, strange looking delivery driver was standing there. I sighed. What could he want now? I thought maybe his car was stuck in the snow or there was some kind of emergency. I made sure my pocket knife was easily accessible and placed the baseball bat aside but still within reach and opened the door. It was difficult to get the door opened, even partially because of the snow accumulation. “Can I help you?”, I asked through the gap of the door. “Can I come in?”, he asked. My car’s stuck and the storm’s getting worse”. 



Something about his voice and inflection stood out to me. It was void of emotion or urgency. It almost sounded rehearsed. I stood in silence for a moment debating what to do. Maybe it would be safer to have someone else at the house given what I heard upstairs. I forced the door open and allowed him in. As he stepped off the snow covered porch, I noticed the space where he was standing was covered in snow aside from where his feet stood. It must have been snowing around him and he hadn’t moved for quite a while.

“My phone’s not working, do you have a cell phone on you by chance?” I asked hopefully. The man shook his head. Seeing his features in the candlelight wasn’t reassuring. If he had looked odd outside in the darkness it was amplified by the light. Right now I was wishing I had neighbors and didn’t live so far out of town. “Where’s your car?”, I asked. The man said nothing but pointed in the direction of the car. I put on my snowboots and asked if he’d seen anyone else nearby. He didn’t verbalize anything but shook his head no. I started to get a feeling deep in my gut that I’d made the wrong decision of letting him in. I stepped outside and trudged down the road a bit, the snow was knee deep now. I shined my flashlight and didn’t see the car. That’s when it hit me I didn’t see tire tracks either. I stood there in silence for a few moments, contemplating what to do next. I tried in vain to get reception again but was unable to. I cursed the weather. My hands and feet were becoming numb and I had no choice to head back home unless I wanted to risk frostbite. 



When I stepped back into the living room the delivery man was gone. “H-hello?”, I called out. There were no footprints besides mine outside. I crept around the house. I stepped in some partially melted snow leading to the kitchen. I followed it and it led to the basement door. What in the hell could this complete stranger want with the basement? If his goal was to rob me he would’ve had time to do that while I was gone. I grabbed my baseball bat and crept down the basement stairs. “I know you’re down here and the police and my brother are on their way!”I bluffed, hoping he would believe it. I searched the basement with no luck. Although I couldn’t find him, I had this odd feeling of being watched. But there was nothing he could hide behind. We kept the basement virtually empty due to it flooding during heavy rain and generally being covered in cobwebs. I froze as I thought I heard something. Breathing. I glanced around. Where the hell was he? Then I looked up. The man was contorted around the vents on the ceiling in the most unnatural way. I screamed, dropping my phone, and ran up the stairs. I fell after a few steps and did some kind of frantic crawl to get the rest of the way up. I could hear the strange skittering noise close behind me. Whatever that was, it was not a human. I refused to turn around and look, afraid that I would never be able to recover from seeing what was really behind me. I stepped into my boots and bolted out the door. I cursed and trudged through the snow as quickly as I could manage with the sheer volume of snow limiting my movements. My face was red with windburn and stung but my body was sweating from the exertion. I finally stopped due to exhaustion and tried to catch my breath. I felt lightheaded and everything went dark. 



I opened my eyes and winced at the bright lights. “He’s awake”, I heard an unfamiliar voice say. I sat up and rubbed my eyes. I was in the hospital. A police officer sat on a chair next to me. “Take it easy son, you’ve got some pretty severe frostbite and a concussion”, said the officer. I frantically tried explaining what had happened. The officer stopped me. “Did you say Al’s Pizza?” he asked. I nodded. “That place hasn’t been around in years. It was really big back in the 70’s but it closed right after the blizzard of ‘78”. “Why?”, I asked. “Well the owner came under some fire after he decided to stay open further into the storm than most area businesses and one of his delivery drivers didn’t come back. They never did find him…”. The officer’s explanation was interrupted by Josh and my mom hurrying into the room and hugging me. I quickly assured them I was okay. “I’m so sorry for falling asleep”, I can’t believe I did that”, said Josh. “It’s okay”, I reassured him. But hey, what was the name of that place you ordered the pizza from?”, I asked. Josh looked confused. “I never ordered a pizza”.
