Me, a 43-year-old experienced scientist with my small team of 2 people, Tony and Jack in Antarctica. I have been around unique, scary and beautiful parts of the world since I graduated from college which took me over 5 years, five years of tears, lack of sleep and studying just to be called a scientist.

As I mentioned before, I have been all around the world for research and job, but it's my first time in Antarctica. We've been here for over 4 days. Our base is a big-sized Russian tent from the previous researchers who didn't make it home in the middle of nothing except ice. None of them, none of them made it home. They all went missing and we are here just to replace and finish the job they began. Hopefully, the tent is big enough to keep the advanced equipment we require to full fill our mission, which is to gain samples and later match them with samples from Siberia or other places. Our second priority is to see any changes in the weather and temperature here, this is to keep a record of it and try to prevent global warming by adjusting the procedures used to stop it. The media may not tell you, but the earth's situation is worse than you may think.

We're wandering daily around the desert of ice to collect samples which are ice with some bacteria on them. One day, we decided to expand our journey and go further when the winds calm down a bit. Winds are so strong that they can easily knock you down if you try to walk during them, that's why we don't want to risk anything, our supervisors who are sitting in a warm, cozy place are prohibiting us from doing it too. Back to the trip, we ignored found bacteria and other things to have test tubes for what we could find further there. As we walked on, Tony shouted at us and said that he saw a small lake or water point which is really unique for the ice desert, no, it wasn't the artic ocean or other big seas, we are in the middle of Antarctica. 

We came closer to the water just to see that it isn't frozen, it is my first time in Antarctica but I know that it is impossible in that temperatures, I want to remind you that the average temperature here is minus 25Â°C and we also can not stay for too long outside, our suits aren't capable for it. The water seemed blue, we couldn't see anything in it. The first thing we did was to take some samples inside the test tubes, we were witnessing something truly scary and amazing! By the time when Tony put the test tube inside the water, it just broke completely. Such a thing shouldn't happen, even if the water is really cold, the test tubes were too tough to shatter. Tony put another test tube and again, it broke. We saw no point in doing that, so we tried to at least take the temperature of the water. I reached for the thermometer when suddenly, a huge wind knocked us to the ground. The sky began to be gray along with the wind, it was so strong that we could see it. We ran back as fast as we could, leaving some of the equipment behind, I believe it was a metal detector and something else.

We barely could make it to the tent. Upon our arrival, I couldn't feel anything, not a part of my body. We took off the suits, shoes and helmets to check if anything isn't frostbitten. Hopefully, nothing was black meaning we could keep our fingers without getting them amputated. Each of us got to stage 2 frostbite which can be healed if you stay warm.

I headed to my bed exhausted and scared of what happened right before. I sat on it trying to process what just happened over and over again, when I heard Jack's voice, he called me for a second. I came to them and I froze for a second. The compass.... it was showing the direction of the West. I took the compass and tried to shake, hit it or anything to see it move. No, it was still showing West. Compasses do not work in Antarctica, they are being affected too much by the magnetic pole and simply spin around. We tried to discuss how did it work or think of any logical explanation, but we couldn't.

Seeing the storm outside, I knew we would be trapped here for another day. I noticed that we haven't really explored this tent, since our arrival we were too busy unpacking and trying to boost the operations that we had no time to do it. In a small closet that was meant to be used for the suits, I found a notebook. The cover was plain black, I picked it up, opened it and found out that it was a diary of I believe the previous crew of this station. The pages and book itself were in perfect condition. I sat down by my bed and started flipping pages, it was a total of 17 days. The diary was written in Russian, but I could read it with ease, the college helped at least in one thing. It changed everything, things I found written there freaked me out so much that I was scared to go outside. I am going to quote the most disturbing days I found in this diary. 


Day 1 
Me and my crew arrived, we have now unpacked and we're preparing for tomorrow to go explore

Day 4
We still didn't get a chance to go out due to extremal winds, I believe they shouldn't last this long...

Day 7
We found something like a virus, it's surprising that it can survive in such temperatures. We came to the base and tried to do anything with it. The DNA wasn't matching with any specie known on earth, did we discover something new?

Day 10
I am losing my mind, we found a lake nearly 10 kilometers from the base. My assistant put his hand in the water and it was... amputated. Just like it was acid?? We're sending an emergency call.

Day 12
He's dead. Not because of the blood loss. Something wanted him dead. I didn't mention it, but we keep hearing strange noises from the outside. The body begins to rot, we are about to throw it outside to the storm.

Day 15
Why are they not here yet? We disrupted someone's peace. It's another day when we are locked in the tent due to the storm. It's peeking from the window.

Day 16
I am not schizophrenic!!! We can see something from the window!!! PLEASE, WE WANT TO CANCEL THIS STUPID MISSION

Day 17
He, he went outside to check on the body. He was dragged by the creature to the lake's direction? I don't know. I lost sense of orientation. I can not keep this any longer. I must go outside for my friend.



I didn't sleep all night. My only goal was to check if it was not a joke. The next day, I took everything along with my team and went outside to check back on that water source. We arrived and found the metal detector, or its pieces by the water. I throw my goggles in the water, but, nothing happened? I took them back without my hand being amputated or something. We all took samples of the water and went back to the base.

I took the diary again to make sure I was conscious and sober while reading it yesterday, I saw the whole story again unchanged. 

After like 25 days, our mission has successfully finished. We prepared to come back home and celebrate our survival. We sent a message on the radio. Waiting for the familiar voice to respond, we caught the news channel by accident, I don't know how is it possible, the radio is programmed to catch a signal from the government. We heard something that left us traumatized. The news reporter was saying that the US, government has fallen due to terror from something unknown. Everyone in North America was killed from what we heard the next day. We kept trying to contact the Danish government to take us back from this place, but the only thing we heard was that the terror bas began in Eastern Europe, for the same reason. The final thing we heard was the news reporter's voice, which said to hide and avoid a 20 meter tall black creature, from his voice we could say that countries are planning a nuclear attack on that thing. We also heard mentions of European countries and their government being terminated by it, most of Europe has fallen victim to it.


Is this the end? Are we going to die here? Is it just an illusion? What continent is next? Is mankind heading to... the end?
