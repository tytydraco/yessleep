This happened to me the other night. It gave me quite the fright. First it came for me in my dreams then grabbed my throat in reality. It all happened just a few nights ago and I am still freaked out.


The night started of normally. I brushed my teeth. Then went and found my fat orange cat. I put him on the bed and started up my nighttime thunderstorm noises. It wasnt long before sleep overcame me. My cat Kream purring between my feet. 


I am blind just so you know. Though in my dreams I can see. I dream in color you see, and sometimes I can even read. 


I was sitting in my dream house. When I became aware and looked around with staring eyes. Trying to take in everything I could see. Lucid dreaming is rare for me, but when it happens it gives me a chance to see. 


Before I could decide what to do with this dream. There came a knocking at my front door. The house fell still. My stomach twisted as if I were ill. 


When lucid dreaming I never fear the unknown. After all, it is my dream I have control. Right? 


So it didnt take me long to go to the door. To find out what all the knocking was for. The knob twisted in my hand and the door began to open.



I had a smile of greeting on my face before it was laid to waste. What pushed it's way inside was terrible and made me want to hide. 


I felt my insides shrivel as my oakwood hall was consumed by lack of light. Something beyond darkness and it was filled with hate. 


The feeling of it's gaze made me quake and shiver. My eyes were drawn to the center of the lack of light where a silhouette of something could barely be bleemed. It was the dark eyes that ensnared me.


I felt it then a pressure of malice. It forced it's way in me filling my mind with thoughts of loss and giving up. It wanted me to defeat myself. 


I was lucid though and I tried to will it away. That didnt work and I could see the white gleam of a pointty toothed smile. In that center of lightlessness. 


I am a person with many tools and if the screwdriver doesnt work. Just meant it was time for the hammer. I am a spiritual person, many call me a beacon. In my life attacks have happened before. On my finger rests a ring of sacred geometry made of silver. 



First the thoughts of defeat had to go so I thought of victories and love to offset the negative thoughts. It took alot to accomplish but once I could think clear planning could occur. The thing had made most of it's way inside. Stopping and rejecting it was the goal. 


My arm felt like it was pushing against a full force waterfall as I raised my fist to the monster. I remember quite well a preacher from a book about a vampire. 


He raised a cross to the undead and it broke the cross. Telling the preacher that the symbol ment nothing without faith. That would not be me so I poured my faith of my God into my ring. Then I felt a need to say the name.



I tried in vain. My mouth opened but no sound could escape my throat. A pressure built and my built up fait flickered. In my dream it was seen as a blue-white intense light that had built upon my fist. 


The word could not be resisted. Once thought it wanted to be spoken. The name of my God almost climbed it's way out with my voice. The first syllable stuttered twice but finally it was said and it felt nice. 


The smile turned to rage as the monster screamed. Then something was drawn from me into my ring and projected forth. It caught the invader and flung it from my home. The door slammed and I awoke covered in sweat and needed to pee. 


First thing I noticed was that Kream was gone. I got out of bed with a sigh, the worst part of lucid dreaming for me is waking back to a world where I am blind. I memorized my route to the bathroom long ago. I washed my hands and headed back to bed. 


In my doorway I stopped with dread in my heart. The presence from my dream was standing in front of me. Mates, if I hadn't just gone pee I would have right there. I have faced spirits and I have faced nightmares but never both at the same time. Nothing had ever come out of a nightmare to aproach me in reality. 


The only thing my tired mind could think to do was what I just had done in the dream. I made a fist and once again tried to raise it. The force pushed against me stronger than the dream. It had managed to piss me off though, i am not a mourning person. So with thoughts of 'screw this effin thing' running through my head I raised my arm. The faith built again but this time, I felt a grip on my throat.



It squeezed and the first syllable of the name failed to speak. I forced everything I had into saying a name that seemed to really upset it. I forced the name through my lips. It was soft spoken at first then when the pressure lifted it was screamed. Then I went further 


I commanded that in the name it leaves and put all of my intent to either see it gone or dead into my voice. With the faith and the name beside me, I had become the predator. It fled then and I felt it leave my home. 


I crawled back into bed and went to sleep. To tired from the effort to stay awake and hoped I would sleep peacefully. I did. The next day I had almost forgotten about it when my housemate asked me about the brusing on my throat. He thought I had just run into something and since he isnt a believer I didn't feel like telling him. 


Now I am here posting because I am curious. What do you think it was? My money is on demon but it could have been something else. Never before have I had my dreams invaded like that. Makes me feel kinda icky inside knowing that thing was trying to break in. How long had it been there before it made itself known? I am not sure but I am sure I dont want to know the answer to that question. Let me know mates and remember dont go to bed without protection.
