Alright this was awhile ago. I grew up fully Catholic, my mother and father were devout Catholics. I wasn't so much as devout as them. We were at our vacation house in Colorado. One of the kids had to sleep on the couch due to not enough room. It was my turn that night. I was bored at the time not being able to sleep so I went outside. I believe it was around 11 pm, I'm not sure. 

On our property we had a good amount of land. I enjoyed being outside quite often so I was familiar with the space. We had an old shed that looked like a miniature barn. I went inside of it and sat there for awhile. I'm up and ready to go back inside and I hear grass crunching. Like somebody is walking on it. At my age at the time I was supposed to be 'tough' so I circle this shed a few times trying to figure out what it was. I was convinced it was one my siblings pulling a nasty trick on me. Well I stop to listen. It starts up again and it's getting louder, and closer. I put my back flat on the wall of the shed hoping it was a nasty trick. 

It wasn't. My back is to the house and I'm getting ready to sprint to the house. I creep around the corner and I see it. To describe it with words is difficult. It was a figure. It was tall and a bit lanky, but no details around it. Just like a dark and black. Like a mass of nothingness. It didn't speak but it moved. Skip forward a bit and it moved to the middle of the yard. I followed it from a distance. I watched it bend into a shape that wasn't supposed to. Like there were joints it wasn't supposed to have to bend that way. At this point in time I panicked and my eldest brother came out. I turned and looked at my brother and I turned back to look at the thing. It moved closer and just stopped. 

I didn't move I just. stared at in horror. My brother stopped coming closer and threw a ball at it. The ball missed completely but it didn't stop me from breaking my staring at it. I looked at my brother then back at where it was. It wasn't there. Wasn't there anymore. It just vanished.  
Skip forward to the end of the week and I'm packing up ready to go home. I'm packing up my duffel bag and I feel the feeling that someone's watching me. I glance out the window and it was outside. On the other side of the fence standing there under some trees. I ran to my mother and spent the rest of the day with her until we left. I haven't ever seen something like that again.  
To this day I have no idea what it was. If somebody has got an answer I would love to hear it.
