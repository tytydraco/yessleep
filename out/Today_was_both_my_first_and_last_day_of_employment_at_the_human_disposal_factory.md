A few months ago, I got laid off from my job. I had fantasized about being let go for months, so when Alan called me into his office that fateful day, I was honestly pretty ecstatic about it.  


  
Without getting too much into it, the guy was a complete dick. The kind of boss where everything is urgent, until it's not. And everything is a fire drill, until he doesn't care about it anymore. Rendering my job, pretty much pointless. Which is sometimes, all it takes to want out.  


  
So when he started to say, "Mike, it's not you, it's us-"  


  
I simply interrupted, "No offense taken!"  


  
And got the fuck out of that place.  


  
But looking back on it now, I would have done anything... begged, bargained, or even bribed, to stay there. Looking back on it, I actually had it so easy. All I had to do was just clock in, bite my tongue, and clock out, but my pride, my ego, got the best of me.  


  
'Cause when you're out of a job, and the bills start piling up, you get desperate. Desperate enough to apply for whatever jobs are available, which... can be slim pickings.  


  
Jobs like "Undisclosed Company Seeks Workers For Upstate Factory."  


  
But like I said, I was desperate, so I applied.  


  
Sure enough, a week later, a woman emailed me...  


  
...Sure enough, a week later, I interviewed with her remotely...  


  
...And, sure enough, a week later, she hired me.  


  
It all happened so quickly, in fact, that I remember standing there, in the woods, as I removed my blindfold, and walked into the lobby of the factory on my first day, wondering, *Wait, why did I need to be blindfolded on my way here? What is this place? What will I be doing? And why did you hire me of all people?*  


  
But after a few months of being unemployed, I was willing to forgo a little context, for a steady paycheck. Or in this case, cash in hand, no questions asked.  


  
The office area was pretty sparse, containing just a few desks, of which only one had a computer. It was where she sat. The nondescript woman who had emailed me, who I had interviewed with, and who was now sitting across from me.  


  
"Just sign there on the dotted line, Mr. Harris." She said with a smile, pointing to the nearly forty-page at-will employment contract that sat in front of me.  


  
I scrolled through it, and quickly realized that there was no way I was going to ever read all of it, let alone understand all of it. Like when you turn on a brand new phone and just click "I agree" and "Next" a hundred times, until you get to the home screen. 'Cause, what choice do you really have? You need the phone.  


  
And, well... I needed the job. So I signed it.  


  
"Splendid! Welcome to the team!" The woman said, holding out her hand.  


  
I shook it.  


  
She then led me out of the office area, down a long hallway, around a couple corners, and to a very large door, which presumably led to a... factory? That was the only thing I really knew about the job.  


  
"Oh, and remember, because we blindfold you on the way in, and the way out, you have no proof that this place exists." The woman added, with a smile.  


  
*What are they, fucking cows in there?* I wondered, before she noticed that I was laughing to myself.  


  
"Mr. Harris?"  


  
I wiped the smile off of my face, straightened my posture, and replied, "Yes, of course. My lips are sealed!"  


  
But the woman ignored the joke, and simply opened the door.  


  
At first, all I could see was a divider made up of those clear plastic flaps, that hang down from the ceiling, that you walk through sometimes, to get from one room to another, for reasons I don't know... backlit by a bright light.  


  
*Fuck it.* I said to myself, as I stepped through them, and onto the other side, as the woman closed the door behind me...  


  
SLAM.  


  
It took a moment for my eyes to adjust, before everything came into focus.  


  
There before me, was a massive factory, separated into three stations that included…  


  
...A conveyor belt on the left side of the room...  


  
...An enclosed room in the center of the room...  


  
...And an enormous dumpster on the right side of the room.   


  
On the opposite end of the room, I could see a couple doors, that led into what looked like long hallways.  


  
Having never worked in a factory before, I didn't think much of the setup at the time, and was much more concerned with the lack of other co-workers.  


  
That is, until they all came pouring in, out of the hallways and through the doors, dressed in rubber hazmat-like suits, their faces enclosed by translucent helmets. At first, they all scurried about, back and forth like ants, before splitting up, each co-worker reporting to one of the three stations. That is, all but one, who made his way over to where I was standing, and greeted me with a smile, through his foggy helmet.  


  
"Mike, right?" He asked.  


  
"Yes, sir. That's me." I replied.  


  
"Welcome to your first day! I'm Mark, the foreman. I’ll be training you for your first couple days. Now, before we begin, do you have any questions?"  


  
I thought about asking, “Yeah, what is it exactly that goes on here?” But I didn't want to rock the boat, and just went along with it.  


  
"Uh... nope." I replied.  


  
"Perfect, put this on."  


  
Mark handed me a suit of my own. It was heavier than I expected, but with a little help from him, I was able to throw it on and snap my helmet into place.  


  
"Perfect. Now, let me take you to your station." He continued, walking me over to the conveyor belt, which I now saw entered the factory through the left wall, and led into the enclosed room.  


  
Several co-workers had now lined up alongside the conveyor belt. Following Mark's lead, I lined up next to them as well, the last in the line, and closest to the room.  


  
"Now, your job is pretty straightforward..." he began.  


  
*Finally!* I thought to myself.  


  
"...In a few minutes, the conveyor belt is gonna turn on, and the product is gonna come flowing down it..."  


  
*Ok. Conveyor belt. Product. Easy enough.*  


  
"...Now when they come out, some of them are gonna be better restrained than others. But some... some will undoubtedly be wriggling and writhing all around, trying to get off the belt."  


  
*Huh? What kind of product could this be?*  


  
"All you gotta do is... keep ‘em on it. No matter how hard they try to get off of it. So they end up going into that room right there."  


  
Mark pointed to the enclosed room, that I was standing right next to.  


  
"And what goes on in there?" I asked.  


  
"Great question! See, that's the best thing about working here. We each focus on just one station, so none of us need to worry about what goes on at the others. What happens in the room in the center of the factory... is none of our business. Ignorance is bliss, Mike."  


  
I was pretty confused.  


  
"Oh, and to make your job even easier. Take this!"  


  
He then handed me a cattle prod.  


  
*Huh?*  


  
Suddenly, a sign on the wall with the words "On" lit up, and the conveyor belt began to move.   


  
"Product moving!" Called out the foreman.  


  
I looked over and saw that all my other co-workers in line also had a cattle prod, each now poised by the conveyor belt in anticipation, ready to use it.  


  
And that's when... the "product" started rolling out.  


  
The first was a brunette male, maybe in his fifties? It was hard to tell with all of the duct tape wrapped around his mouth and face, his terrified eyes peering out behind a mask of silver.  


  
He was lying on his side, his hands bound behind his back, and his legs tied at his ankles.  


  
*What the fuck? No... it can't be.*  


  
"Oh, and one more thing. If you let them escape, the boss will kill you too." Mark added, before laughing menacingly.  


  
"Too?" I asked, confused.  


  
"Oh no, I spoiled it. I usually tell new employees on day two, but I've never been much for surprises. The people that come in on the belt. They get killed in the room. Then we toss 'em into the dumpster."  


  
I didn't respond. I was too distracted by the man rolling past me on the conveyor belt, his eyes growing wide, as if to say, "Help," his screams muffled by the duct tape.  


  
"Go for it. Give him a little tap with the cattle prod." Mark suggested, but I found myself unable to move, as the bound man drifted by me and into the room.  


  
"No worries, you'll get the hang of it." He reassured me.  


  
A minute or so later... screams could be heard coming from the room, followed by... silence.   


  
And then...   


  
SLAM.  


  
...The sound of a body dropping into the dumpster.  


  
This went on about nine more times.  


  
On a few occasions, some of the "products," as they called them, attempted to flee from the conveyor belt, but were met with prodding by my co-workers, and then guided into the enclosed room.  


  
Being the new guy, Mark watched my every move very closely, to see how I would handle an escape attempt, but by the time each “product” passed by my post, they were each much too exhausted from the cattle prods to put up a fight.  


  
Watching the tenth "product" drift into the room, I was suddenly startled by the sound of a bell tolling...  


  
DING!  


  
…And the foreman yelling...  


  
"Lunch break!"  


  
...As the conveyor belt rolled to a stop.  


  
Lunch was pretty normal. A co-worker went around and took each of our orders using a delivery app, apparently from a place close by with a 4.8 star rating.  


  
I then followed Mark down one of the adjacent hallways, and into a cafeteria, where all of the employees were sitting and chatting casually.  


  
"Where you from?" He asked me nonchalantly.  


  
But I was too disturbed by what had just happened to answer his question. "Um, so.... Would it be too forward to ask, who those people are?"  


  
"What people?" Mark replied.  


  
"Um, the tied up ones. That are being fed into the room by a conveyor belt, killed, and dropped into a dumpster?"  


  
"Oh, right, them. Honestly? No one really knows. Some think that they might just be innocent civilians. Others think that they may owe somebody money. I like to think that they're criminals, that really, really deserve it. Helps me sleep better at night. But at the end of the day, we’re not sure who they are, or who hires us, so we’ll never know."  


  
I didn't know what to think... about any of it.  


  
When the food showed up, I was much too sick to my stomach to eat. I just pretended to, as to not tip anyone off to the fact that, I was freaking the fuck out on the inside.  


  
But before I knew it, the bell tolled again...  


  
DING!  


  
And the foreman yelled...  


  
"Back to work!"  


  
...As the conveyor belt began moving again.  


  
*Only ten more and I can get the fuck out of this place.* I thought to myself.  


  
But this batch of "product," was... particularly squirmy.  


  
You see, when the next individual came rolling down the conveyor belt, wiggling and writhing, kept only on course by the constant prodding of my fellow linesmen, it became clear that there was no way I was getting out of my service this time.  


  
But when he finally rolled past me, kicking and screaming, in an attempt to roll off of the conveyor belt, I froze again, haunted by the fear in his eyes, and unintentionally allowed him to escape.  


  
He didn't make it far. In a matter of minutes, my colleagues had picked him up and thrown him back onto the belt, a one way ticket to his inevitable demise in the enclosed room.  


  
That's when they all turned and looked at me, and the foreman yelled, "Insubordinate! Throw him onto the conveyor belt too!"   


  
Mark pointed top me, then to the conveyor belt, before they all charged at me. About five of them hoisted me up onto the belt, and tried jamming me into the enclosed room.  


  
I was terrified. I began screaming and crying, pleading for my life, and trying to break free, but they kept pushing me closer and closer to the room.  


  
"Ahhhhhhhh!" I screamed again, this time at the top of my lungs, when I suddenly realized I was just standing there on the motionless conveyor belt, everyone having already let go of me, and now huddled together, laughing hysterically.  


  
"Oh, come on, Mike. You thought we were really gonna kill you?" Mark called out.  


  
"Uh..." I mumbled.  


  
"Don't be silly. We only kill the product!"  


  
All of my co-workers burst out laughing again, before the foreman walked over and patted me on the shoulder. "Now, why don't you go ahead and leave early today. I know the first day on any job can be a lot."  


  
I was then escorted out of the factory, back through the plastic flaps, back through the door that led into the factory, back through the office, past the woman sitting at the computer, out the front entrance, and over to a car, where someone was holding a blindfold, ready to escort me back.  


  
And so, when I got home, I did what anyone else would do in my position. I sat down at my computer and wrote a resignation letter, careful not to mention any of the horrors that I had seen.  


  
"It is with both disappointment, and excitement, that I received another, more fitting opportunity elsewhere, and so I must unfortunately terminate my employment. I greatly appreciate the opportunity, and wish you all the best. Sincerely, -Mike."  


  
I was lying, of course, but I thought it might soften the blow. As my old boss Mike would have said, "It's not you, it's me-"  


  
And like that... I hit send...  


  
CLICK.  


  
...Before sitting back and hoping. Hoping that they'll reply amicably.  


  
That was ten minutes ago, and today... was both my first and last day of employment at the human disposal factory.
