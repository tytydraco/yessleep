I hope someone is reading this. It is my strong suspicion that humanity ended about a week ago. If that is the case, I am posting this in the hopes that I am not the last survivor. Please send help, I have no idea how much longer I’ll hold out.

I should mention that I was born without my sight. It’s been a challenge for me. The world we’ve built is one dominated by the ability to see. Education, roads, even most forms of entertainment are predominantly experienced through the eyes. 

People have often asked me what it’s like to be blind, but that’s difficult for me to describe. It’s just how I am. I like to think that it has allowed me to experience the world in a way that few others do. I can appreciate my other senses to a degree that makes life just as beautiful for me as for anyone else. Or as terrifying.

Believe it or not, I work as an author. My setup allows me to use speech to text and even reads my work back to me so I can correct it. I truly enjoy writing. It lets me paint pictures that I can experience the beauty of. 

That being said, it is a very lonely life. I don’t really have too many friends, save the cleaning lady who gives my apartment a one-over every month. It’s to my shame that I admit, I’ve gone for months without leaving my apartment before. I didn’t really see any need for me to.

I get all the fresh air I need when I drink my coffee on the balcony, and it’s not like natural beauty does anything for me. But I do so love the sounds. The birds singing, the wind blowing through leaves, even the sound of traffic. It makes me appreciate that life is happening all around me. I often felt like the Hunchback of Notre Dame - stuck in my tower while the world goes on below me. Only I chose my prison. 

As a result, I’ve given myself an unofficial mandate that I must go outside at least once every day for a short walk. I think it keeps me not just sane, but also it helps me be happier. 

Another way I avoid depression is a routine. Even if it is a loose one, I find it helps keep my life structured. 

I wake up at 7am and eat breakfast on my balcony. It’s one of my favorite parts of the day. I soak in the world around me - the wind brushing over my skin, the birds chirping back and forth to each other in their busy escapades, the smell of the bakery from the street below - it’s when I feel most alive. 

After that, I shower, get dressed and begin work at 8:30. I spend the rest of my morning wrestling with writer's block or brainstorming for my next chapters, and then take a break around noon to have a small lunch and go on that walk I mentioned earlier. Then, it’s back to writing at 1:30. I usually continue on until around 5, which is when I make myself dinner. After dinner I unwind by listening to audiobooks or podcasts. That, or sometimes I’ll put a movie on. 

As you may have gathered, I experience this world differently than most. For example, I can’t just look at the sky and see a storm. I feel when the clouds are ready to pour down rain on the earth, I smell the weight of it in the air, and I hear the subtle change in the wind's voice, the way it hushes like the sky is holding its breath. 

I’ve always lived my life this way, and I wouldn’t change it. But recently something has been off.

I noticed it 13 days ago when I was eating my breakfast. It was a sunny day, and the wind blew gently through my hair. But the smell of it was odd. It had a hint of almost a medical smell. Like formaldehyde. I didn’t have time to dwell on it before a melody of chirps sprung out closer to me than usual. A robin was singing its flute-like song for me. I smiled - it was truly a special way to start my day.

My walk that day was also a bit odd, only in the sense that cars seemed more aggressive than normal. The sound of engines revving and horns beeping seemed more common. I could hear people talking too. Someone walked by me, asking their partner about dinner on the phone. Another pair was standing not far away, talking about the weather. Yet another was discussing some meeting they had at work. All perfectly mundane and normal things.

What bothered me at this point was the smell. It was not the usual smell of the lake and the trees. Everything was tainted with a chemical smell. And something else - something masked by it. Like if you were to microwave raw chicken until it was just hot enough to produce an aroma. 

I showered after I got home, trying to scrub the stench off of me. But I didn’t let it bother me, the rest of my day went as it normally does. 

As did my morning the next day. I woke up and prepared my breakfast, dusting off the chair on the balcony. The wind was just a bit rougher today. Yet, dry. It was not unpleasant enough for me to go inside. I couldn’t smell the bakery that morning, but I was able to enjoy the sounds I usually do. Cars rushed by, people chattered below, and the robin even sang his song for me again.

I worked, I ate, I went for a walk. But I almost considered cutting it short. The smell was getting worse, its mask was slipping off. I could make out the faint scent of burnt hair now too. 

Up until now, I was not particularly bothered. The following is what sent me into my steep slide into paranoia:

The conversations I heard. Someone asked their partner about dinner. Someone was discussing the weather. Someone was complaining about a meeting. The same voices, the same tones, the same cadences. 

I stopped to listen, but the conversations all sounded normal to me. A car jolted me back to my senses - 3 quick beeps from the road ahead. I smirked to myself - everyone was always in such a hurry. 

I talked myself down on the way home - these were all normal conversations. Very common and not unreasonable that people discussed them. After all, I didn;t memorize anyone's voice. Who’s to say it was the same people.

And yet the next day - the robin with his same tune, dinner, weather, work, 3 beeps. 

The next day, the day after, and the day after.

I even changed my routine. I ate dinner inside, but I could still hear the bird clear as day from my window. 

I walked another path, yet I heard the same voices, the same mundane conversations. 

Five days ago, I tried something else. I left the house at 4 am, before dawn. No breakfast. No routine. Just a coat, my cane, and silence.

I walked through streets I hadn’t stepped on in years - quiet side roads, fenced-off alleys, industrial zones. And still I heard it.

The robin singing. Not distant. Close.

“What’s for dinner?” a woman asked, passing behind me. Calm, casual.

“This fog is terrible,” a man replied on my right. “Supposed to clear by noon.”

Yet another, “My boss is riding me about that meeting again.”

The voices never overlapped. Each one waited their turn like actors in a scene. The pauses between them - identical every time.

Then 3 honks just ahead of me.

I ran home and locked my doors and windows, but it didn't change anything. I still hear the robin everyday like clockwork. I can even hear the 3 honks on the street below when their time comes.

I haven’t left my apartment yet. 

But yesterday, I was fumbling around the living room and knocked something off the shelf - my old radio. It hasn’t worked in years. It fell, cracked, and let out a brief burst of static.

Then the robin stopped singing. 
The traffic fell silent.
The busy chattering from pedestrians vanished without a trace. 

And in their place, new noises.

Wind - not gentle, but howling, pushing and scraping against the building like claws.

Distant crackling - like fire chewing through dry wood, or the brittle remains of something once alive.

And beneath it all, a deep rumble. Not mechanical - geological.

The city groaned.

Not with life, but with pressure. As if its bones were shifting under the weight of their own collapse.

I heard something metal fall - far off, a sign or streetlamp, maybe. It struck the ground and didn’t stop ringing.

There were no footsteps. No laughter. No voices.

Only the wind, and the ruins left for it to gnaw on.

It lasted only seconds, but it was enough for me to take it all in. The picture these sounds painted sickened me to my core. 

Then, like a machine sputtering back to life, the robin returned. Then the cars and the conversations - drowning out the sounds of emptiness in a deafening juxtaposition. 

All of it came back, just like before. Perfect. Polished. Rehearsed.

But what they couldn’t keep from me is the smell. Warm, rancid flesh and sour, acidic chemicals hidden behind the smell of pastries and fresh bread.

Now I sit here, on the balcony, coffee in hand, pretending the world is still alive.

The robin sings on cue.

The conversations start in order.

The smells drift up from a bakery I’m sure no longer stands.

But I know now.

Whatever’s out there wants me to believe.

To follow my routine.

And most days, I do.

Because I’m afraid of what happens if I don’t.
