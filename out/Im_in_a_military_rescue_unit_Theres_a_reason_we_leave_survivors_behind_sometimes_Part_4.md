***************

“Where the fuck is he?” I repeated. The table where his lifeless corpse had laid was now empty save for a circle of blood at one end. 

Everyone went back on high alert as the lab was searched but no trace of his body was found. Then Sheaf pointed to a thin, almost invisible trail of blood leading from the table to the door of the lab. 

“Those things took him.” It wasn’t a question. 

“They took him while we were figuring out the controls,” Connors muttered. “Jesus.” 

“Fuck,” I grunted, then hissed when Larson peeled away my fatigues to reveal a long laceration down my right bicep. “Fuck you too.”

“Hey now,” he leveled his spectacles at me like a disappointed father. “No cursing out your doctor.”

I watched as his nimble fingers began probing my flesh around the various cuts I’d received from the creature. Two on my right arm, one down my jaw along the neck and collarbone, and two more over my sternum. None were too deep, but they did burn like a motherfucker. Larson had to pour a stinging chemical over all of them which led to another round of curses. Then he closed them with a binding agent that would allow the wounds to stretch and flex without too much risk of splitting open. 

As he worked on me, Keys, Sikes, and Sheaf all stood vigil over Bronson. They cleaned the blood from his neck and face, cut away any residual filth from his clothes, and closed his eyes. Keys looked guilty when she ordered his non-personals to be rationed out. His tags and personal effects were zipped away to be returned to his family when we got out of here. 

After what felt like an appropriate amount of time, Keys had Connors drape a large sheet over his body. 

“I know how hard this is for all of you,” she said slowly. “We’re not a combat unit, we’re a rescue team. But sometimes shit goes sideways and we have to adapt. Bronson was an excellent member of our team. We’re going to get the fuck out of here no matter what happens, okay?”

The rest of us nodded, even as the bigger question lingers above our heads like a mounting storm. 

Did our message make it out? 

In the meantime, Keys assumed the role of the delegator. She had us strip ourselves of our MREs, weapons, tools, and medical supplies. The point of this, she said, was to get an idea of how long we might last down here if rescue took a while to come. 

Judging by our rations and water, we could stretch things for three days. Perhaps four. 

Weapons-wise, we still had most of our ammo save for the clip Bronson sprayed when he got grabbed. 

Larson kept himself busy by tending to my wounds more often than necessary, but I let him do whatever he needed because I think taking care of someone kept his mind off Bronson and, to some extent, Ketterman. Evil as the man was, Larson had still taken a vow to care for everyone to the best of his ability. 

Personally, I felt for him. But also knew killing the scientist had been the right thing. I felt similarly about crushing the skull of that creature. In the heat of the moment, it felt so incredibly vindicating to slaughter Bronson’s killer. But now I could only imagine the mother and son from that experiment. They didn’t ask for any of this. The gas corrupted them beyond all human recognition, destabilizing their minds until they were only driven by the most primal urges. They were forced to skitter through the facility as cannibalistic byproducts of our newest weapon. To either subside on the gutted flesh of those they’d once been or to suffer death by devolving into a living husk of their former selves. 

Not much of a choice.

I watched as Larson’s hands swept over the angry ridges in my flesh. 

“It’s a fucked situation,” I said quietly. 

He grunted. In the harsh light, his coppery hair looked like blood.

“Thank you for fixing me up. I wish… I wish I’d been quicker to get to Bronson. I could’ve done more.” A hollow chord caught in my throat.

Larson stopped massaging my wounds and looked me square in the eye. Then he pinched one of my cuts. 

I gasped from the pain. “The fuck are you doing, asshole?”

He smiled and released. “Just making sure you aren’t turning into a self-pitying twat. Bronson was not your fault and you did more than anyone else to try and save him. So every time you say something stupid, I’m going to pinch one of your cuts.”

“I was trying to be heartfelt!”

“You were trying to wallow in your grief. Cut it out.”

I glared at him. “You are one miserable fucking bastard, you know that?”

Larson straightened himself up proudly. “I do as a matter of fact.”

“Fine.” Despite my best efforts, I couldn’t help smiling. “I hope we get out of here.”

“If you keep moaning on and on, probably not.”

“You know what? I think the creature nicked one of the arteries high up on my thigh. Why don’t I pull down my pants so you can get on your knees and kiss my hairy, white a-”

“Everyone?” Keys’ voice cut through the lab. “Could you gather around?”

She got us all circled around the table that held our weapons, food, and other supplies. 

“From here on out, we’re going to be going on half-rations. Obviously it’s not ideal, but what we have will only be good for three to four days. In the interim, we’ll keep an ear out for that door and for the creatures. There’s really not much else to do. Keep yourselves fit, play card games, talk, sleep, everything you’ve been taught to do to avoid letting your mind wander. Any questions?”

No one said anything for a moment. Then Sikes raised her hand. “What happens if we hit that three to four-day mark and no one’s come?”

Keys lifted one of the pistols lying on the table. “Then we armor up and raid the canteen.” 

********

The next several days proved difficult to put it mildly. With no natural light to mark the passage of time, we depended mostly on our watches and internal clocks. But adrenaline, fear, and the admittedly unpleasant aroma of Bronson’s corpse beginning to rot made it hard. 

We employed every trick in the book to alleviate our boredom. Slept, played cards, tried mind games, discussed our pasts and plans for the future, taught one another knife tricks, and exchanged advice about working in the field. My wounds closed nicely, the flesh beginning to bind into neat lines. There would always be scars, but Larson said there were no signs of infection.

But in the end, no one could ignore the edge of anxiety creeping into the lab, weaving its way into every conversation, game, and thought we attempted to distract ourselves with. We were trapped somewhere cold, dangerous, and remote. Creatures stronger than us prowled the darkness, waiting us out. The days ticked by on my watch, slow as molasses and far too quickly at the same time. Our rations dwindled and thinned, we lost valuable weight, and Keys finally called it on the morning of the fourth day. 

“We haven’t heard anything,” she said. “I’m not going to draw this out with some grandiose speech. This is survival and those things out there can get fucked. We need food and water.” She pointed at Larson and me to come with her. Sheaf, Connors, and Sikes would stay back to watch over Bronson’s body and to also ensure none of the creatures snuck in for another ambush. 

No one argued. 

This time I armed myself with my pistol and knife and left the rifles to Larson and Keys. I figured they’d serve me better in close quarters given how fast those bastards were. 

We took a moment to gear up. Then, after giving the others a brief nod, we slid back out into the sprawling tunnels of the Tantalus Site. 

I kept my ears pricked and my pistol in front of me. Keys and Larson took point and rear. I came up the middle. Crusted blood and dried entrails crunched softly underfoot as we entered the murky gloom of the devastated center. I tried not to look at the blood staining the window of the comms station. 

Keys led the way to the canteen which sat thirty feet from the tunnel entrance. She ducked into a long tent lined with low wooden benches. A metal table near the front marked where food would be served and she immediately swept around it toward the kitchen in the back. Within the confines of the tent, Keys risked a little light to illuminate the tiny area.

“Jackpot,” she whispered as her beam fell upon shelf after shelf of nonperishable goods - cans, dried meats, sacks of sugar and flour, powdered milk. She grinned at us. “We’ll fill our packs with as much as we can carry then hightail it back, got it?”

We all nodded. 

Keys was reaching up to grab a can when she looked over my shoulder and went pale. 

“Down!” The word was a rushed whisper as she grabbed me and Larson and yanked us to the ground. We all went prone in the shadows of the serving tables. 

The scent of putrid, rotting meat invaded my nose and all the hairs stiffened along my neck.

One of the humanoids appeared at the entrance of the canteen. Its withered body glistened wetly in the dim light. The thing was swiveling its head around from side to side, teeth chattering as it searched. Flecks of mucus bubbled from the pits around its nose as it tested the air. 

I realized then that these things were blind. What tactical advantages that afforded me at the moment I didn’t know. I could only focus on the way the thing crawled and swayed around like a giant spider, sensing its surroundings and clutching the table beneath it with impossibly long fingers. It remained crouched where it was for a minute. 

My gaze drifted down to Larson, who stared back at me, full of dread. He held my gaze for a long moment then looked down at something beneath us. I looked down and my heart skipped. 

One of the cans we’d stuffed in our packs teetered precariously, threatening to drop onto the ground. 

I slowly reached down, moving as carefully as I could manage. The can trembled and the creature leaped from the table to the ground mere feet from us. Its feet dug into the stone floor. Gooey tar-like saliva slipped from its mouth and landed inches from Larson’s face. 

He flinched and the can tumbled onto the floor with a clang. 

The creature squealed with rage and lunged at him. I raised my pistol and fired.

My first bullet caught it square in the jaw, splintering its teeth like rotted planks. The second came a moment later and struck it in the neck, where a fountain of thick blood oozed out. But the monster still managed to land a powerful swipe that dug deep into Larson’s shoulders and sliced down his spine. The man screamed while Keys scrambled to her feet and fired more shots at the creature until it went down in a jerking heap. 

Larson bucked and gargled blood, but we had no time to help him as three more humanoids crashed their way through the roof of the canteen tent and launched themselves at us.  

One went for Keys, two at me and Larson. Just my fucking luck. I fired indiscriminately at the closest one, cutting through its slimy organs with satisfying THWOCKS. One shattered its shoulder blade and it spun off balance, but it still landed a brutal swipe to my side. Fortunately, it only caught me with its forearm rather than its claws or else my guts would’ve been splashing over a still-bucking Larson. 

The other creature came at me full force and rammed its spindly shoulder square into my sternum, launching me across the kitchen into the wall of food. 

I groaned and slid to the floor as cans rained down around me. 

Keys screamed bloody murder as she tore at her attacker with her knife. She raked her blade over its skull, throat, and back like a deranged leopard, opening up deep, seeping gashes everywhere. I almost felt sorry for the creature until I saw it hiss and sink its claws into her shoulder, puncturing her upper arm. She called it a “cave-dwelling rock fucker” and stuck her knife into its ear, all the way up to the hilt. 

The humanoid released her just in time for me to refocus on the one who’d rammed me into the pantry. It approached slowly and sniffed around. I realized the clanging of the cans had obscured my specific whereabouts. It took another step forward and found Larson. In a flash, it had its claws in his back, peeling his uniform and flesh away to reveal the stark nakedness of his muscles and ribs. 

Larson screamed again and the creature bared its teeth, giving me time to palm a can of Chef Boyardee’s and hurl it with as much force as I could muster. 

CLANG. 

Metal on bone rang through the tent. A large gouge opened in the creature’s face, its nose and teeth pulping into a mash of slimy tissue. The creature wailed and stumbled back, clutching its face. I rose and hurled another can at it. Then another and another. Each one punched into its emaciated body like meteors stabbing into a new planet. They tore craters in its guts, face, and chest. I took one final bloodied can and brought it crashing down on the thing’s head, parting its brains with a sickening squelch. The thing flopped on the ground and lay silent. 

Wheeling around, I caught a quick glimpse of the one Keys had stabbed through the ear making swipes at her. She grabbed its ear and the hilt of her knife and rammed her knee into the point of its chin. Its face exploded like a rotting pumpkin. 

We stared panting at each other, caught in the overwhelming fervor of the brief, but bloody battle.

A dark shape moved in the corner of my eye and I whirled around to see the one I’d shot lunging toward me, injured but still very much alive. 

WHOCK! 

Larson’s knife punched into its neck in a perfectly timed throw. He swooned from his position on his knees. The creature collapsed wailing on the ground where it thrashed until Keys’ boot found its head. 

As she ensured the others were all well and truly dead, I knelt over Larson to look at his wounds. It was painfully evident he wouldn’t be making it, but he didn’t need to know. Instead, I simply held him and muttered thank you for everything he’d done until he drifted away. 

Eventually, Keys put her hand on my shoulder and began to say something, but a scream ripped through the cavern from the direction of the lab. 

A heartbeat later, we were sprinting down the tunnel. We heard footsteps coming toward us from the direction of the creatures’ lair and raised our guns, but it was only Connors. He looked wild. Part of his scalp hung bleeding against the side of his face and his fatigues were stained in blood and slime. I was relieved that he wasn’t seriously injured, but the expression on his face stopped me cold. 

“Sikes,” he panted. “They dragged Sikes into that fucking hole.” 

“Fuck! Where’s Sheaf?” Keys demanded, trying to get things in order as best she could. The question might have seemed callous, but it was the only way we could figure things out without wasting time. 

Connors managed to grow even paler. “He’s… I don’t know man… he’s in a bad way.” Without another word, he led us to the lab where Sheaf sat at one of the tables. 

At first, I thought he was dead. His barrel-shaped chest had been bisected diagonally by a creature and his guts spilled out into his lap. A giant purpling bruise colored the flesh around his temple and his body was lacerated with deep, agonizing lacerations. Around his feet lay the pulverized remains of at least three more creatures. 

Then he sucked a breath in through his nose and lifted his head toward us. I could see his lungs expand and contract through his ragged fatigues. 

“K-....eeeeys.” His voice was nothing more than a whisper. 

Keys knelt beside him. She didn’t bother with bandages or reassurances. He was gone and she saved his last moments for his final words. 

As he passed her his personal things, Connors told me what had happened in brief shaky breaths. A couple of minutes after we were ambushed out in the canteen, someone started pounding on the door to the lab. There were cries to be let in and Sikes thought it had to be one of us since the creatures couldn’t talk. But when she opened the door she found Ketterman. 

“He was this… this thing, man. Naked like the others, but not as rotten. His face was peeled off and he was laughing. Things were wriggling in his skin. He had this awful smirk when Sikes opened the door and smacked her aside. Another one of those fuckers knocked the shit out of me and I was out for like a minute. When I woke back up, three of these things were dead, Sikes wrestling with the other one, and Sheaf was fighting with that Ketterman thing.” He shook his head. “Then Ketterman swiped his hand across Sheaf’s chest and opened him up from hip to shoulder like it was nothing. He grabbed Sikes by the hair and dragged her out of here. I tried to run after them, but one of those fucks tackled me and gave him enough time to take her back in that fucking place.”

Connors was close to hyperventilating at this point. I pulled him into a bear hug. “Larson’s gone too.” 

“Fuck.” 

“Yeah.” 

We let go of each other just as Sheaf released a sigh. He tilted to one side and slumped across the bench. 

Keys added his possessions to Larson’s. 

Her jaw was set in a hard line, and the muscles along her neck flexed with fury. 

Lifting Sheaf’s rifle in her hands, she looked back at us. “I’m going after Sikes.”

We both nodded without hesitation. We didn’t know if rescue would come or not. Just that we might be able to rescue our friend and grind Ketterman into a bloody pulp. That was enough.

When we arrived at the hole at the end of the tunnel, I no longer found it terrifying. The rusted bars bent inward like jagged teeth, exhaling a rotting stench that I didn’t even register anymore. 

Flicking on our flashlights and headlamps, Keys stepped into the darkness first. Then Connors. Then me. 

Darkness consumed us as we slid into the den of monsters.
