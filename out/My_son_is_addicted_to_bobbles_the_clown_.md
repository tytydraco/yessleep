I’m writing this now that it is all over.it all started almost a year ago I was watching the news it was talking about how a child who murdered her family and killed her self and this is only one of the many events like this that have been happening for a little while.after I watched it I was thinking of what I should write but I couldn’t think of anything

 .after a few hours I went to get some food when I went into the kitchen (our kitchen is right next to the living room) I saw my son watching tv I never saw him watching that show so I asked him what he was watching he said I’m watching bobbles the clown. I said oh then I eat my food

.nothing big happened for a few weeks so now he was starting school again so I told him to stop watching tv and get ready then he yelled at me I’m finishing the episode first you bitch . 

I was pretty mad I told him to get ready or he won’t be allowed to watch tv for a week he got ready after that.over the next few weeks his behavior got worse and worse I decided to take him to a child psychiatrist dr.Jeff Jefferson

 I took him there he was pissed they talked for an hour in the meanwhile I saw on the news a other child who murdered their parents and themselves.when they were done Jefferson asked me if he was watching bobbles the clown I replied yes he said of course and then said that he has a theory that bobbles some how connects to the children’s bad behavior he said most of the children he talks to watch that show I have watched the first episode I haven’t noticed anything weird but I still think something is wrong with it. 

I asked well can you just say to their parents for them to stop watching it he replied I have already tried but they just go back to watching it. I said weird maybe we should watch a few episodes together.later that day I came to his house and we put on an episode the intro was very childish I thought 


my son is way too old for this next thing I know I fell asleep a few hours later I woke up to see the tv off and Jefferson asleep I woke him up and asked him what he saw then he 


said I fell asleep right after the intro I replied I did to.the next day we tried again this time with coffee but we both fell asleep before the intro finished weirded out I posted on social media has anyone seen more than one episode of bobbles the clown.most 


people said no and ones who said yes looked to be children.a few days later me and dr.Jefferson got a bunch of caffeine pills we watched the show and took a pill every 30 seconds we were able to make it past the first episode but after the intro to 


the next episode we fell asleep.both of us didn’t remember the episode but Jefferson was keeping notes his notes said that the clown was breaking the fourth wall and was telling us to stop watching and to just stop 


doing anything with the show.
We were about to talk about what to do next when all the caffeine pill gave us both heat attacks they were pretty bad so we called 


an ambulance and were taking to the hospital were we spent the rest of the night we decided that we have to stop this madness and we will go to the place where bobbles the clown was filmed.the next day 


we researched bobbles the clown we found that the show is directed written produced and staring Charlie walker we also found that walker lives in San Francisco we quickly 


booked out fight while I was packing I was attacked by my son he had a knife he nearly stabbed me I heard him coming so I jumped out of the way I quickly grabbed his arm and held him to the wall then I called Jefferson 


and asked him what to do he said to just stay there he arrived about 20 minutes later with a shot (I didn’t know what was in it)my son quickly fell asleep and then we tied him to his bed.in the morning I hired a 


babysitter(I felt bad about her having to watch my son) and then we went to the airport and on the plane .later we arrived in San Francisco we were able to find walker’s address but he had a large wall and 


cameras so we sat in our rental car until he left and went to the beach we eventually walked up to him and said hi were massive fans of bobbles the clown can we give you a quick interview.he looked quite confused but 


said yes we asked him why he does the show he replied to help entertain children and make their life better .right after he said that dr.Jefferson was pissed and yelled at him talking about how he’s making children 


kill their families and themselves then walker replied saying he doesn’t know what you’re talking about and that he’s done with the interview his bodyguards watched us while he left the bodyguards looked lifeless.i 


told Jefferson why did you do that then he said he a lied we have to stop him.that night we found the building that bobbles the clown was filmed in we chose that tomorrow night we will break in .the next night came and we were ready we had some equipment 


masks and we both had a gun just in case we broke through the bathroom window we went in the hallway and found the workers still working (it was 11:41 pm btw) we keep secretly going until we found Charlie 
walker’s office we tried going in but the door 


was locked I told Jefferson to move out of the way and I ran into the door in broke down and we entered the office in there was walker dressed up in his clown costume he 


pointed a pistol at us and asked what we are doing here Jefferson told him to lower his gun but he did as expected I said we’re here to stop you from killing any more 


people then walker said I know who you are no one knows your in this building so if I kill you and just clean up no one would ever know.right while he said that Jefferson quickly pulled out his gun and shot but 


walker also shot him both of them now on the ground I quickly went to Jefferson he said to stop walker meanwhile walker was getting up I quickly shot him three times in 


the chest he died almost immediately I called an ambulance and then started searching for evidence I found a form of sleep gas that if anyone over the age of 14 


looks at they would fall asleep I also found scripts of the show .the ambulance and police arrived shortly but it wasn’t fast enough dr.Jefferson died then I should the 


evidence but I still had to go to court.after the show was canceled my son’s behavior went back to normal Jefferson’s name will always be remembered as he responsible for saving thousands of lives.one year later 


the court case was finally over I wasn’t found guilty but you new that being you are reading this there is one more thing that the gas did disappear and walker’s wife is still alive.
