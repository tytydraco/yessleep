The dust in the air looked almost like snow as it floated through the air of the sparsely populated pub. There were only a few people here tonight, besides myself and the bartender. The usuals, mainly-- my father, who drug me here most nights rather than leave me home alone, a few field hands, desperate for a drink after a long day of hard work, and Mr. Vogel. Of course, others would trickle in throughout the night, as they always did, but not many patrons gathered here before the sun went down. Though Mr. Vogel never really left. He sat in the corner booth, night after night, day after day, rubbing the grain on the wooden table shiny and smooth with the pressure of his elbows.

He never interacted with the other customers, or anyone in town for that matter. He was a recluse, though not entirely by his own choice. They whispered about him, spread rumors, blamed him, hated him, even, ever since those kids went missing. The bartender was his only friend, and even that was more of a business arrangement than anything else. My chest panged with sympathy as I watched him sip his warm beer in the loneliest corner of a dirty small town pub, eyes fixed steadfastly on the wall in front of him. His wrinkled face drooped slightly, giving him a rather crestfallen appearance that seemed befitting of his emotional state. Most nights, he sat so still and so silent, he might well not be there at all. Tonight was not most nights.

“The bus!” he shouted, abruptly standing to punctuate his proclamation. “The bus came for them. It took them away,” he bellowed, waving his arms back and forth with every word. His outburst rung out like the crack of a whip in the monotonous din of the bar. “One by one they boarded the bus, one by one, stop by stop.” Beer sloshed down the side of his glass and onto the laminate floor as he jerked his thin arms about his sickly frame, adding to the generally sticky atmosphere around him. He continued. “The wrong bus, the wrong driver, the wrong—”

“Shut the hell up, old man,” My father yelled from the bar, throwing a cigarette butt towards Mr. Vogel. It bounced off of his temple and landed on the floor beside the wadded up napkins and half-eaten french fries thrown simultaneously by the other bar patrons.

“Yeah, no one wants to hear that crap this week, Vogel” added the bartender, as he popped the top off another Miller Lite and handed it to my father, who most certainly did not need another. Mr. Vogel returned to his seat in the booth and slowly sipped on the ounce or two of foamy beer that remained in his glass. The tears on his cheek shimmered ever so slightly in the dim light of the neon sign behind him. The empty look in his eyes made my stomach churn. The continuous jeering in his direction sent pity coursing through my veins like a poison. My father always demanded that I stay away from him. It was a lesson handed down from all parents to every child in town for at least the last three decades, probably longer.

“He’s not all there, you know, up here” he’d say, pointing a calloused finger at his head. “We don’t know what happened to those kids but ain’t no bus just took them, you hear? Vogel gone and did something what got him all messed up. Best keep a wide berth.” I’d nod and agree. A wide berth. Of course. No problem. But the truth is, I was always curious about the old man in the corner booth. More curious about him than I ever was about the missing kids.

I glanced at my father, who had his arm around a leathery woman, unsteadily slow dancing to a Conway Twitty song by the pool table on the far side of the smokey room. I grabbed the soggy cardboard container holding the greasy hot dog my father bought me from the bar, smearing the palm of my hand with brown ketchup in the process, and walked slowly toward Mr. Vogel. I stopped a few steps in front of the corner booth and shifted uncomfortably from one foot to another while I mustered up the courage to speak. He didn’t seem to register my approach.

“How did you know?” I finally asked, slicing through the silence between us. He slowly moved his eyes, and only his eyes, to meet mine. “Th-that it wasn’t the real bus,” I added, in case he wasn’t sure what I was asking. He slid his empty beer across the table and tilted his head ever so slightly toward the bar, indicating, I suppose, that he needed another drink. I obliged, bringing his empty glass to the counter and placing it beside a heaping pile of cigarette ash. The bartender accepted my crinkled five-dollar bill with a raised eyebrow.

“It’s for Mr. Vogel,” I explained, pointing toward the old man as though he needed the specification. He sighed, but dutifully filled the glass with bubbling yellow beer once again. I held the glass with both hands on my walk back to the corner booth, trying my hardest not to spill a single drop for fear of disrupting the slight progress I’d made with Mr. Vogel. Upon my return, he took a long, slow sip of his drink and stared straight ahead at the wall opposite his seat, fully ignoring my presence. I waited patiently. My father had just put four dollars in the juke box so I knew I had plenty of time before he’d decide it was time to leave.

“It just weren’t right,” Mr. Vogel finally said, three Willie Nelson songs later. His voice had all the gravel of a dirt road and none of the charm. He moved his eyes to meet mine once again. The tears on his cheek had dried by now but his light blue eyes still looked watery, as though another drop might form any second.

When he finally spoke again, it was a slow and steady stream of thoughts, littered with heavy pauses. “It was the wrong yellow… too bright, too perfect, and the driver... he weren’t right either.” With that, his gaze broke from mine and returned to its usual position, affixed to the wall in front of him. I lingered by the booth for a moment, hoping for an explanation he probably wasn’t even capable of providing. The jukebox clicked off, indicating that the money had run out and my father would be looking to collect me any minute. “Well… goodnight, Mr. Vogel,” I said, wanting to be polite.

Before I’d taken more than a few steps toward my father, I heard a soft voice behind me. “I told them not to get on,” he whispered. A chill ran down my spine like sweat on a hot day. “I did tell them,” he repeated, but he wasn't talking to me anymore.

The following day, I sat groggily at my desk, having not slept a wink for thoughts of my unsettling conversation with Mr. Vogel. Gripping my black ink pen with one hand, and propping my head up with the other, I pretended to work diligently on the worksheet Mrs. Anderson had handed out.

“Hey, Jimmy! *ppssttt* Jimmy,” I heard, as a rubbery eraser bounced off the side of my head.

“What?” I whispered.

“Do you know what day it is tomorrow?” asked Andrew, a second eraser ready in his hand, should I take too long to respond.

“Uh, Thursday?” I responded, confused as to this line of questioning.

“No,” chimed Suzie, from the seat beside mine. Her curly blonde hair was pulled up into a messy pony tail. It looked nice. She always looked nice. “It’ll be fifty years tomorrow. You know, since all those kids went missing.”

“Since they were murdered,” Andrew clarified.

Suzie shot him a look. “We don’t know that, Andrew. They could still be alive. Somewhere. Far away from here.” She glanced back down at her worksheet with sad eyes. Her grandaddy’s sister is one of the missing. Not that Suzie ever knew her.

“Well, my daddy says Vogel killed each and all of ‘em with his bare hands,” Andrew stated, thrusting his hands out in front of him, causing Suzie to flinch. Keaton, from the seat beside Andrew, shook his head in disbelief. “Please,” he said, waving his hand in front of him, “that ain’t what happened. My daddy’s field hand says that his wife's cousin thinks those kids were murdered by someone else but that Vogel saw it and that’s what got him all messed up the way he is. Maybe they even tried to kill him too.”

Andrew nodded his head and furrowed his brow like he was really considering this perspective. “Could be, could be,” he finally offered. “Look, Suzie, all I’m saying is there just ain’t no way thirteen kids get on the wrong bus and disappear without a trace the way he says. Just ain’t no way.” Suzie pulled her hood up over her head and doodled aimlessly in the margin of her worksheet. "Come on, Suzie,” Keaton prodded, poking her aggressively in the shoulder.

“Hey, leave her alone, okay?” I whispered, trying my hardest to sound as serious as I felt. It wasn’t fair, them taunting her like that. I wanted to comfort her in some way. To tell her that her great aunt could still be alive. Somewhere. Far away from here. I’m not sure I really believe that, but I suppose it could be true. After all, Andrew is right that no one ever found a single trace of those thirteen kids. Not a drop of blood, not a strand of hair. Nothing besides time to suggest that they really were dead. Who knows, maybe Mr. Vogel has been telling the unbelievable truth for nearly fifty years. Maybe there is a bus somewhere out there that steals children. A bus with a driver that just ain’t right.

“Do you kids have something you’d like to share with the rest of the class?” asked Mrs. Anderson, one hand resting on her broad hip.

“No, Mrs. Anderson,” we responded, almost in unison.

The next morning, it was raining—not hard enough that I needed a jacket but hard enough that I wanted one. We waited in the rain, half asleep and entirely silent, next to the stop sign at the end of the dirt road that served as our bus stop. Suzie was wearing denim overalls with a short sleeve shirt underneath. She looked nice. The cool, wet air caused goosebumps to form on her arms. If I’d remembered to bring a jacket, I would have offered it to her.

“It’s cold,” Andrew complained. Suzie and I nodded in agreement.

“Do you think it was cold the day those kids got took?” Andrew asked.

“Why don’t you go ask Mr. Vogel?” Suzie responded in a harsh voice. Andrew rolled his eyes.

I wish I knew what to say to her. I wanted to let her know that I was sorry about her great aunt. That I know today is hard for her family. That I’m here if she ever wanted or needed to talk but the most I could muster was a pathetic uhm before we heard the sound of the bus turning the corner.

“Thank God” Andrew exclaimed, rubbing his upper arms with his hands to mimic warmth.

The bus lumbered slowly up the street, driving well below the speed limit. Mrs. Sarah usually had to speed because she tends to run late but this morning she arrived five minutes early.  The bus stopped directly in front of us, as usual. We all grabbed our bags off the ground and slung them over our shoulders as the doors opened.

"Good morning, Mrs. Sarah," Suzie called out from behind me as the bottom of my shoe kissed the first step. There was no response. I paused, glancing up at Mrs. Sarah, usually bright and animated despite waking up at the ass crack of dawn Monday through Friday. She stared straight ahead, unblinking, both hands on the steering wheel in front of her.

"Mrs. Sarah? Are you okay?" I asked, standing still at the bottom of the small staircase. Mrs. Sarah slowly turned her head towards me, her body fixed in its current position, and she smiled, if you could call it that. Her lips spread steadily, revealing the kind of smile that surpassed its purpose as a formality and teetered on the edge of malice. My breath caught in my throat as I stepped quickly off the bus, pushing my friends backwards as I fled. Something wasn't right.

"Will you go?" Andrew asked, shoving my backpack forward, clearly annoyed by my hesitation. "What is wrong with you? It's freezing out here." He pushed past me and bounded confidently up the steps and into the belly of the bus before I could even attempt to respond. Glancing at the bumper to the left of the door I noticed smooth lemon yellow paint where dented and scratched goldenrod paint should be. Dean had thrown a rock at Millie a few years back but, thankfully, he missed and struck the bumper behind her instead. Mrs. Sarah had given him an earful for that and when he got home from school that evening his mom had given him an earful too. I gasped. *It just weren't right.*

"No, wait," I stammered, turning towards Suzie, who was now stepping around me to join Andrew. "Wait, please, it's, the scratch!" I pointed to the smooth bumper but Suzie ignored my desperate gestures and looked into my eyes, her forehead wrinkled with worry. "Jimmy, come on. We're going to be late," she stated, in a soft, quiet voice that made me feel ashamed. She looked away and stepped forward onto the stairs. I grabbed the strap of her overalls and yanked her back towards me, perhaps a bit more violently than I intended. She wiggled and smacked my hand, trying to free herself from my grasp.

"Suzie, please. This isn't right. It's the wrong bus. It's the wrong color. The scratch is gone," I pleaded, once again pointing towards the crisp yellow bumper. "And that is not Mrs. Sarah!" I yelled, waving my free hand toward the suspiciously quiet imposter who was, once again, staring straight ahead into the empty road, seemingly oblivious to the wrestling match occurring beside her. "Jimmy, stop," Suzie whispered, "You're scaring me." Her sweet voice pierced my heart. Scaring her. The last thing I ever wanted to do. My hand involuntarily released her overalls. She boarded the bus as I stood by the stop sign, watching through the windows as she walked down the aisle and took a seat next to Andrew on the bench seat in the back.

"Get on the bus, Jimmy," demanded the driver, in a raspy, monotone voice that sent alarm bells ringing in my ears. I shook my head, unable to speak. Without protest, the driver closed the door and began to drive slowly away, exactly the speed limit. Suzie looked out the window at me. She seemed disappointed somehow, like she expected better of me. Though I wasn't entirely sure what I'd done wrong. I only wanted to protect her.

No sooner had the bus rounded the corner at the end of the street than I began to feel embarrassed about my outburst. Surely Mrs. Sarah was just sick and her voice was raspy because she'd been up all night coughing and sneezing. Maybe she had been temporarily assigned a new bus while our usual bus was in the shop. School buses need maintenance, too, right? My cheeks flushed red as I anticipated the jokes and jeers Andrew and Suzie would hurl in my direction when I saw them the next day. They were probably huddled together on the bench seat in the back of the bus right now, brainstorming some cheesy nickname that I wouldn't escape until at least college, if ever.

I let out and audible groan at the thought, quickly followed by a heavy sigh as I lamented my own stupidity. And, ugh, Suzie. She probably thought I was making fun of her. Mocking the loss of her great aunt in some twisted joke. *You're scaring me*. I heard her soft, sweet voice and hung my head in shame. Surely she would never speak to me again. I kicked a rock as hard as I could down the dirt road before me and began my short walk home, where I planned to fake a terrible illness to avoid showing my face at school for at least a week. I’d only taken three steps before I heard the unmistakable sound of large tires rounding the corner behind me.

Bumps rose to the surface of my skin as a large vehicle came to a stop beside me. I kept my eyes glued to my feet, not brave enough to look at the vehicle whose shadow now loomed over me, threatening my sanity. If I don't look and don't breathe, it will go away, I thought. I heard the sizzling release of pressure as the driver pulled the lever to open the door. My eyes involuntarily squeezed shut in response as I silently begged the driver to close the door and drive away.

"All alone today, Sweetie?" came the sickly sweet and unmistakable voice of Mrs. Sarah. The real Mrs. Sarah. The Mrs. Sarah that had sat me on her lap while driving when I was scared on my first day of kindergarten. The Mrs. Sarah that had bandaged my knee after Andrew pushed me to the ground before school in the third grade. She was right on time, ten minutes late. "Jimmy? You okay. baby?" she called. Her voice, usually calming and serene, now twisted my intestines into knots. My chest tightened and my skin felt crumpled and brittle, like a strong gust of wind might blow me to bits and send me swirling through the humid air between rain drops. I fought the urge to puke. Peeking through a gap in the fingers held over my eyes, I slowly turned to face the bus. My gaze landed immediately on the dented goldenrod yellow paint before traveling to the pale, freckled face of Mrs. Sarah. Her eyebrows were pressed together in concern and a smoking cigarette hung loosely from her frowning lips. The bus was perfectly imperfect, just as it should be. It made me sick.

"No, no. Please," I cried, as big, fat tears cascaded down my face, landing on the dirt road beside my feet. Mrs. Sarah called out to me again but I couldn't understand her words over the sound of my sobbing. Heaving gasps and whimpers escaped my lips as I slowly backed away from Mrs. Sarah and the perfectly imperfect, scratched and dented, goldenrod yellow bus. My heart was pounding in my chest with such force that my sternum began to ache. My shoulders shook violently, causing my backpack to slip off and land with a thud on the ground.

Thoughts of Suzie and Andrew on the lemon yellow bus flooded my mind like the aftermath of a burst pipe. It wasn't right. I knew it wasn't right. I should have held tight to her overalls, refused to let go even when she begged. Even when she said I was scaring her. I should have screamed and fought and demanded that we all walk to school, that we warn Millie and Dean who were unknowingly awaiting a trap on the next street over. Oh god, Millie and Dean. Bile rose from my stomach, burning the back of my throat. I hadn't even thought of them before now. I'm sure they've already taken their seats next to Suzie and Andrew on the pristine bench seat, completely oblivious to the obvious danger around them.

The thought was too much. A scream erupted from my throat in much the same way and a mushroom cloud rises above the site of an atomic bomb, letting bystanders know that something terrible has happened here. I kicked my backpack as hard as I could. Then I kicked it again and again and again until my toes were sore and the crumbled bag was ground into the dusty road, half unzipped. Mrs. Sarah was yelling my name, begging me to tell her what was happening. *Let me help you, baby.* She was too sweet. Too caring. So unlike the cold, lifeless monster driving the lemon yellow bus. How could I have let that thing fool me for even one moment, for long enough to let go. Why did I let go?

I backed away quicker now, turning to run atop the uneven gravel road, stumbling and tripping over rocks and into muddy puddles. The cold rain stung my face as I raced toward the only person in town who might understand. I ran down narrow alleys and through overgrown backyards. Through corn fields and rows of soy beans. I didn't stop running until I reached the trash filled parking lot of the pub. A scatter of cigarette butts marked my arrival. They'd barely been open for ten minutes when I threw the front door to the side and marched unsteadily toward the already occupied corner booth. Mr. Vogel sat in the booth with a beer in his hand. Right where he always was, where I knew he would be.

My breath was rapid and uneven as my body struggled to wrestle oxygen into my depleted lungs. I opened my mouth to speak, to yell, to beg for help, but the only sound I could manage was a single pathetic whimper before tears began flowing down my cheeks once again. Mr. Vogel looked up at me. His eyes met mine and a cool, blue sadness reflected back at me. No words were exchanged but no words were necessary for me to know he understood. He let out a resigned sigh and patted his hand on the seat next to his own, inviting me to join him in his booth and in his misery. Once I was seated, he slid his half empty beer toward me.

"Here, kid," he muttered, nodding to the glass, "it will help." I took a slow sip of the bitter liquid, wondering how this could ever help anything at all.

“I tried to tell them,” I said.  “I know you did,” he replied.

"Where do you think the bus will take them?" I finally asked, afraid of what his answer might be, or that he would have no answer at all.

He thought for a moment before responding. "Far away from here."
