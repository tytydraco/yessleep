Last year, my parents got into a huge fight. I later learned that my father had been unfaithful. He told my mother that when he frequently visited and stayed for long periods in his old hometown he was just visiting his sick parents and helping with their newly purchased farm. In reality, she learned, I don’t know how, that he was seeing someone else there.

During my Christmas vacation, my mother, who is an accountant, got permission from her former boss to take three weeks' leave from work. We arrived unannounced at my grandparents' house and all my father's lies were revealed. Neither of my grandparents was critically ill and there was no "newly purchased" farm. My grandparents were military veterans and were doing fine on their pensions and on savings from their years of service. They thought that the reason for his frequent and longer visits was because my mother was constantly stressing him out. 

My good for nothing father arrived at midnight, far too late because my mother already knew the truth and far too late to claim he had just gone “just outside to enjoy nature. My grandparents grabbed their "toys" and gave one to my mother, then chased my unfaithful father through the small town. I was just as furious as they were, but I am a medical student and do not want a moral turpitude violation to keep me from getting my license. 

The following day, my mother and I returned to our apartment to pack our things. She had decided to leave him for good. As she shouted, cried, cursed and whipped violently at my father’s thick leather to anything at her sight downstairs, I took refuge in my bedroom upstairs. 

It was raining heavily that night, quite common in our area. I opened the window so the cold breeze came in, and its icy touch made me drowsy. I think I fell asleep while listening to a voice recording of my boyfriend singing.

I don’t know how to describe this in a way you can relate to, but an ominous feeling woke me up. It felt as if a pool of negative energy were suffocating me or pressing on my chest. I sat up immediately and began breathing heavily. My bedroom was already dark. The streetlight’s dim glow seeped through the open window and pooled on the floor tiles. After calming myself down, I checked my phone. It was thirty minutes past midnight. 

I flicked the switch beside me, but the power was out. I got out of bed to reach for my emergency lamp. After two or three steps I heard a loud thud by the window. I froze, wide-eyed, and held my breath, staring at the window. I waited a minute for any movement, then tiptoed to my drawer to get the flashlight and the knife my boyfriend had given me. I aimed the flashlight’s intense white beam at the window and held the knife out as I crept toward it. In my mind I thought it was an intruder, which is common in our area.

When I reached the window I hurriedly closed and locked it. Then I sighed and relaxed. I even laughed at myself, thinking I had been jumpy these past few weeks.

After regaining my composure, I walked to the bathroom, pointing my flashlight forward and with the knife of my other hand. When I opened the white plastic door, what greeted me were two lower legs hanging from above. They were long, pale-white, and long black toe nails. I didn’t dare to look up - I slammed the door shut. 

Then I heard tapping behind me and spun around. Though I could see only the streetlight’s dim glow through the glass window, I could discern that someone or something was hiding in the shadows beyond it.

“Who-who’s there?” My voice was trembling, so did I. 

There was no answer. I repeated my question. 

“I want to talk with you,” a soft and clear female voice answered back. But the chill it sent through me buckled my knees and I hit the floor.

“I apologize that we meet like this.” I heard a rustling in my bedsheet, and then two red lights gleamed, staring at me.

“But, please leave Rick alone.” She continued.

“Why do you want to destroy my family?”. 

Although I was terrified, I blurted out the question I’d been holding back. My father was a loser - his stupid smile had irritated me since childhood, he used to sing me lullabies even though he was hopelessly out of tune, he won’t fight back to my mother, he was always late in picking me up from school, and now, him cheating sealed the deal that he will be the forever loser. 

“I saw the scars on his back,” the voice said. The two red glows drifted aside, their light lingering as if the thing behind them were thinking.

“He said it was just an accident. But alas, he is sweet but a terrible liar. I recognized the straight cut wounds.”

I didn’t respond. 

“She’s brave but not a good kind of being brave.” The red glows stared back at me. 

“So, please listen to me -”

Then, out of the shadows, two hands emerged into the dim light. They were thin and pale, with long, black, pointed nails. They moved slowly as they came closer to me. I could do nothing but cry and scream -  horror overtook me, and I couldn’t stand, let alone run.

Out of desperation, I gripped the knife hard and stabbed at them, but one hand caught my wrist, the pale, bony fingers gripping so hard it hurt. The other slipped under my dress. I tried to twist and kick, but more hands shot out of the shadows, grabbed both my legs, and pulled them apart. She then placed her warm hands on my belly. My abdominal muscles tightened - not painful, but deeply uncomfortable.

“This is all I could do for you and the one inside of you.” She said, 

“You are Rick’s blood, but also his most loved. I do this to ease his worry.” Her hands retreated to the shadows. 

“Now, if you want to protect yourself and the one inside of you -” She continued

I heard loud thuds going up the stairs. 

“Run or fight”

I heard the door knob twist and swung open. My mother’s glaring eyes meet mine. I saw a butcher knife in her hand. 

“Why didn't you sleep, sweetie? I was about to send a very special gift to your stupid cheating father.”

Those were my mother’s last words before she... I’m sorry. I can’t bring myself to write the horrible things she did or failed to do to me. All I can say is that I was fortunate to escape - by crashing through the window, jumping from the third floor, and landing barefoot on the concrete. I had no cuts, bruises, or broken bones - it was morbidly amazing.

I went to the police station immediately, but when they heard my mother’s name the officers were spooked and sent me away. That’s because my mother is the beloved daughter of the patriarch of the most powerful political dynasty in our province. That is why you won’t see any news articles or social media posts about this. I tried posting about it on many forums and platforms, but my posts were brushed off immediately. I wouldn’t be surprised if this, too, is erased.

Right now I am with my boyfriend and our baby. I won’t disclose where, but the three of us live a relatively quiet life. However, there is still a looming fear that my mother might find us and do something harmful to my family.

Still, I find comfort in the fact that my father’s sidechick saved me and my baby that night, and I know she would do it again if necessary. I hate her, but she’s one hell of a sidechick.
