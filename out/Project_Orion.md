Part one.

I don't remember much from before we got here. I remember my family, my friends, my dog whom I love very much, and I remember why I came here. But for some reason, I can't remember too many details about my past. Every time I try to think about it too hard my head starts pounding and there's this piercing, almost bloody hissing coming from everywhere. I'd rather not think about it. So instead, I've resorted to the comfort of writing down what little I can piece together, from my scattered thoughts. I guess I should start from the beginning.



There was a book written in 1757, titled Aranei Svecici, that became the first foundational text for modern spider nomenclature. This was the first organized and published text that described 67 species of arachnids in Sweden. Today there are over 50,000 discovered species of arachnids all over the world. In such a small time we've discovered just how little we know about our own world. I've spent my whole life studying spiders of all kinds, they always captivated me with how alien-like they are. Despite being such a small creature, they instill a fear like no other, in even the biggest of men. They asked me to come here, hoping I would have some insight as to what that *thing* outside is. Well, they were wrong, I don't know anything about it. I mean, I know some things about it, I know it's clearly an arachnid.



When the object first came into view, lighting up the world's radar screens, and sending a white hot panic through the hearts of the world's leaders, the world changed overnight as fast as a flash boil. In an instant, the world was coming together to understand its place in all of this. It came through what seemed to be a gravity door, a slit in space that was completely invisible to the naked eye. First appearing around Jupiter, it began hurtling in the direction of Earth as soon as it revealed itself. The smartest minds in the world, all coming together, all belching their own theories and conclusions, still couldn't seem to decipher how this object appeared from seemingly nothing, already barrelling toward us as if it had been thrown at us like a giant cosmic baseball. Not long after it was detected, scientists were able to calculate its trajectory, not toward Earth, but directly into the sun. I was watching news coverage, and they had invited a well-respected arachnologist and professor on to talk about it. In fact, he was my professor when I was at university, at least I think he was. There goes that hiss again.

I was honed in on the TV screen, watching intently when I received a call from an emergency number.



Project Orion was initially an ambitious attempt to push a massive spaceship to light speed, using small, concentrated nuclear detonations. It was deemed impossible, but due to a ban on testing nuclear weapons, it wouldn't have worked anyway. 4 months ago it was picked out of a cabinet full of files and adapted to fit the world's needs. A group consisting of 10 astronauts, and 5 researchers was sent up to set up an orbital station around the object, which by now we already knew was a big fucking spider. I was a part of that team. Boy, do I wish we had never come here. 



The craft used to reach the orbit of the object was named the Raft mk 1. It ferried us safely into orbit and sustained us while we built the Orion Orbital Research Facility. We just took to calling it the ORF. It was a major success, and within 4 months we had a fully operational space station orbiting this thing. With only 6 years until this thing is swallowed by our sun, we worked pretty fast. Each of us worked tirelessly, only stopping now and then to tend to our basic needs, sleep, and occasionally gawk at the creature. Sometimes I felt like it was gawking right back at me. Throughout the entire process, you could say we got a pretty good look at it. 



It was a giant fucking spider alright, but it wasn't as big as they say. Sorry, I should say it isn't as big as they say. Sometimes I forget I'm here. Wherever here is. No I am here, I'm in the ORF. People were going crazy already about 2 months in but we all did a good job of hiding it. That thing was speaking to us, to me. Or at least I think it was. It still is.



We took the raft on our first expedition to the creature. The closer we got, the smaller I felt. It was like looking at a giant ball of fur, its surface having ridges and barbs protruding from its legs that flowed over its head like a drape. It was a very large, very dead spider, roughly the size of a building, curled up into a ball.

Six of us went on that expedition, two researchers and four astronauts. Only one of us made it back to the ORF.

I'll spare you the details, either because I can't remember, or because it doesn't really matter. Four of us went inside this thing, it was like walking through tunnels and hallways. There were giant incisions down its carapace, which we could float through like tunnels. It looked like it had been dissected. What the hell could have done this to a creature like this? We floated along through this thing's body, our tethers hanging in the still of space behind us. We eventually reached an opening and what we found inside was the worst thing I've ever seen. A room full of eggs, very big slimy eggs. They looked rotten, certainly smelled that way. They were huge. I could hear her calling to me from within. She says “They do not want to die, they want to be found. They cannot bear the distance.” I remember standing too close to the egg, and suddenly I was looking into the darkest eyes. I fell into them, falling into an endless, heavy darkness that enveloped me like dark silk threads pulling and tugging on every limb, threatening to snap them. The hissing was so loud it pierced into my ears and my eyes, going even further until I felt it.

 I felt it. Everywhere.

Suddenly I wasn't there anymore. And I was back in the cave, whispering to myself, “We shouldn't have come here we shouldn't have come here.” To my right, I heard a shriek of pain and I turned calmly, still in a daze and I saw her being eaten alive by them. I don't remember her name. She screamed and writhed, smashing her fist into her own body, but the more of them she crushed, the more replaced until she was engulfed in a blanket of pitch black spiders, cutting through her suit with their razor-sharp pincers. She slammed her head into the egg in front of her, grasping for air that wouldn't arrive, and with a horrible pained yell that I've never heard anything like, she fell silent. Now gently floating upward, the sound of her being devoured only came through her comms headset. The hissing, the skittering. The sound of flesh being torn and ripped from bone. And then more silence. The deafening silence of the void of space. I snapped out of it and got the hell out of there, and I didn't even bother to turn around to see the others getting that same treatment.

End of part one.
