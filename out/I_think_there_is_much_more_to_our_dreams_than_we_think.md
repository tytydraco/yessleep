I was twenty, old enough to know the difference between curiosity and stupidity, but some doors choose you the way mirrors choose what to reflect. No sign. No Do Not Enter. A few weeks ago I ended up in a building I didn’t recognize after a hard day at work. I must have entered somehow into the wrong building instead of my apartment complex. It smelled faintly of dust and warm wiring. 

I should say: I was sure it was not a dream I was having in a subway train home. I was not drunk. I had not taken any drugs. I do truly hope that I don’t have a mental illness I am not aware of.

After finding myself in that strange corridor beyond the door to a warm summer night, I did hesitate to explore further in the unfamiliar space, at least at first, but curiosity often overpowers my better judgment.
Cold air brushed my face and tasted like paper. On the far wall opposite, a fluorescent light flickered once, then steadied. The corridor took a sharp right then almost warped on itself before opening to a rather large room. The smell of bleach had a sweet edge, like somebody had tried to perfume it. There was a chair in the middle of the room, and a table, and on the table was a stack of thin blankets in once vivid colors; purples and citrus yellows and hopeful blues that had seen too many wash cycles. I’m talking about those cheap felt store bought comforters. A projector sat on a rolling cart, nose aimed at a pull-down screen that wasn’t down.

 I told myself: the maintenance people use this for breaks, maybe it was an office building ? I told myself a lot of things so I could step inside.

The clock on the wall read 12:16. The second hand crept and, at the forty-seven second tick, stopped. I kept looking at it because if you stare long enough at a thing that’s wrong, the rest of the room either corrects itself or reveals the way it has been wrong all along.

No windows. Just a door and the second opening I came through. A single vent whispered above me. The hum in the ceiling felt like it vibrated in my bones, both almost silent and almost too loud.

"Late for our meeting," a voice said.

I turned, already knowing. I knew the taste of the next moment before I arrived in it. Like déjà vu except it reached out and brushed my skin.

He stood by the door I hadn’t heard open. Clean-shaven jaw. Dark hair brushed into obedience. His eyes were that difficult color you can’t name without lying. Gray that wanted to be blue, blue that remembered it had been gray. He wasn’t on the older side, just more defined, like when you increase definition of a photo you took.

"Hello," he said in a familiar even tone.

"You," I said. The word landed with too many memories attached, like keys I hadn’t labeled. The person seemed so known to me, but I couldn’t recall any memories with him. Babysitter, my mind offered, and then crossed it out. 

My mind stumbled upon scraps of memories I didn’t know I had. His voice felt like the voice of my consciousness when I was chatting with myself. I do sound sort of crazy while writing this.

"You’re not supposed to be here," I said, and realized that wasn’t true.

He smiled with just enough teeth. "You found the way here yourself." He glanced down "You all do at some point"

"Who’s all of us?" I asked.

He ignored the question gently. "How are the dreams?" he asked, as if picking up a conversation we’d paused yesterday.

"Fine," I said automatically, because that word fits everywhere, and then: "Why is the clock broken?"

"Because you noticed," he said, as if that were both joke and answer. "Sit, if you like."

"I don’t," I said. I sat anyway. The chair was harder than it looked, metal disguised as comfort. The blankets on the table watched me, folded and ready to be unfolded. 

He came closer but not too close. He smelled like nothing: the clean absence of scent, the careful removal of evidence.

"Twenty," he said, and let the number sit with me. "This is an age most people come for that final time"

He glanced toward the projector; the lens caught a sliver of light and threw it across his shirt, a small artificial sun. He folded his hands. It looked deliberate, like a ritual; maybe he did that to keep his fingers from pointing where he wanted me to go. "We monitored. "We modeled" he said. "We gave you that sense of privacy you craved and the connections you wanted"

"But why" I asked. "Why us as you previously mentioned?"

"Us," he repeated softly, savoring the pronoun. "We gave you doors. We gave you an opportunities."

"Then you must have wanted something in return ?"

His eyes flicked to the stopped second hand. "Let’s not ruin the afternoon," he said,

The vent above us breathed. The light hummed. In the humming, I heard children running down hallways that weren’t there. I smelled chalk and glue and the metal tang of old blood. I told myself none of those things were present. The body argues with logic when it wants to.

"Do you want to remember more before you forget ?" he asked, so gently I moved before I decided to, before thinking the question through. Before I forget what?

He nodded, as if I’d passed a test I didn’t know I was taking. "Then do it," he said producing a tissue from his pocket. With a pen, he drew a door, then added a peephole, tiny and exact. He placed it in my hand without touching my fingers.

It felt ridiculous to hold a door made of paper. It somehow did feel right however.

"Close your eyes," he suggested. "If you want. It helps."

I don’t know why I listened. I closed them and the room’s orange light moved through my lids and made a small false sun. The hum sank. Against the inside of my skull, something unlatched with a click so small I almost missed it.

The old house arrived with that rug that made my bare feet itch. My mother at the sink, staring through the window as if it had a show on so interesting she couldn’t look away. My father at the table with his thumb pressed to his lip like he could keep a sentence from escaping. Me in a chair too big for me, swinging my feet. And him—this man sitting opposite, saying, Can we try something? in a hushed reassuring voice people use to speak to a child.

We. He loved that pronoun.

I opened my eyes in the white room. My palm had sweated through the napkin. The door he’d drawn was smudged. The clock still showed forty-seven.

"You look tired," he said, not unkindly.

"You were always there," I said.

"Was, am and will be," he said. "Time behaves."

I wanted to ask so many questions, but couldn’t seem to find a way to move my tongue to speak them. 

"Why hide, in… whatever this is? A room that isn’t on any floor plan." I asked instead of a more logical question like ‘ What’s the point of all of this?’ or ‘Why scrub your existence from my memories?’ or ‘You said others, like other people?’

He smiled when I asked my question, the way people smile when a child repeats a swear word they were never supposed to hear.

"This isn’t hiding," he said, adjusting the collar of his shirt. "This is where we watch."

"We?" My voice scraped the inside of my mouth.

He didn’t answer. Instead, he walked toward the projector cart, his footsteps silent on the linoleum. The projector light blinked, weak at first, then brightened flickering through a reel of images: faces, hundreds, thousands. People laughing, crying, standing in classrooms, grocery aisles, laying in beds. One face repeated more often than the rest — mine, younger, smaller, eyes too wide for the skull that held them.

"What is this?" I whispered.

"Observation," he said. "People have always fascinated us. You live in patterns, you repeat your mistakes as if trying to perfect them. You feel so loud." He touched the side of the projector with the tenderness of a priest touching an altar. "Without us there wouldn’t be you."

"People?" I said. The words came out thick. 

He smiled again, not cruelly, not kindly, but with the detached amusement of someone studying a bird that just learned it was in a cage. "Most humans only see one room. One hour. One body. But some…" He stepped closer. The air between us bent, faintly. "Some are built differently. The walls between your worlds are thinner for you. You call it sensitivity. Your doctors give it names.

"I’m not …" I started, then stopped. Because I had always known I wasn’t quite built for the noise of other people. I heard moods before people spoke them. Sometimes I finished strangers’ sentences.

And I had always dreamed of rooms like this one.

"You slipped through," he said, "because you remember how. You’ve done it before, when you were small. We told you not to come back until you were ready."

"What are you?" I asked.

He looked up ,not at me, but through me as if my question had opened a skylight. "A question you’ve been asking since you learned to name things. You call us watchers, angels, gods, scientists." His eyes darkened, shifting shades of storm and sky. "We were here long before your words learned to walk."

The projector clicked again. One of the images froze. My face at seven, eyes wide, mouth half-open. The child-me was looking past the camera, up, at something unseen.

He turned to me, and I realized his pupils weren’t round. They dilated vertically, like a cat’s, or something trying to imitate one.

"You studied us," I said, my voice shaking. "All this time. Through… what? Dreams?"

He nodded. "Dreams are the only doors you still leave unlocked."

"And the others?" I asked. "The ones who found you before me?"

"They forgot," he said. "Most don’t remember crossing. They wake and tell themselves it was imagination. That’s how we keep the balance."

"And me?"

His expression softened. "You never forget entirely. Even when you try. That’s what makes you interesting."

Something moved behind him — a flicker at the edge of the projector’s light. I thought it was shadow until it blinked. A shape, tall, narrow, wrong. It folded in on itself like light bending around gravity. The air smelled of dust, salt, and ozone.

The clock on the wall began to move again. But the hand didn’t tick - it screeched, dragging itself around the face, grinding metal on metal. The sound made my teeth ache. The blankets on the table stirred, as if something beneath them had exhaled. The room’s light deepened into an underwater green.

"What’s happening?" I whispered.

He stepped closer, close enough that the heat from him , if it was heat, pressed against my skin. "This place exists because you people believes in hidden rooms. You built it. We only occupy the space you make."

The room tilted. My vision doubled. The light warped until he looked like two men standing on the same line, both slightly transparent. Behind him, the shadow folded again taller now, its edges dripping upward like reversed rain.

"I want to go home," I said, and hated how childish I sounded.

"You are home," he said softly. "You always have been. You just live on the other side of this room."

He reached for my wrist. His hand stopped a fraction of an inch from my skin  not touching, but I felt it anyway. My pulse skipped. The air thickened. I realized, with quiet horror, that his hand wasn’t quite solid. The outline blurred at the edges, like something rendered badly on an old screen.

"You feel it, don’t you?" he said. "How thin it’s become. How easy it is for you to step through."

"What happens if I do?"

His mouth curved, not into a smile but into the idea of one. "Then you won’t have to wake up anymore."

He leaned close enough that his voice sounded inside my skull. "Close your eyes," he said. "Or open them wider. It’s the same thing here."

I fell backward. The chair clattered against the floor. The paper door tore in half in my hand, and the room folded. The light exploded, or maybe it was me.

When I opened my eyes, I was standing in the lobby of my apartment building. The familiar scent of detergent and cheap tile polish filled my nose. My keys were in my hand. The clock by the elevators said 12:16.

I was shaking so hard I nearly dropped everything.

I took the stairs. Every landing looked identical, every corner too dark. When I reached my floor, the hallway felt narrower than usual. My door waited. I fumbled with the lock, shoved it open, and stumbled inside.

My apartment was empty.

Then, softly, from inside the room that wasn’t there, I heard him say:

"Time behaves, we make sure you do too."
