[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jieakc/i_heard_my_mom_whispering_to_herself_one_night/)

I stayed away from my parents the entire day. I wandered the woods behind our house, trying to muster up whatever strength was left in me. I went through everything. The whispers, my mom’s strange and hostile behavior, Hol’s apparition, grandma’s warnings, memories of joyful childhood innocence broken into pieces. The confusion rose within me like a storm of muddled feelings, thoughts, and memories all blending together. I knew something was drawing closer, I knew it wouldn’t be long.

The beginning of the end happened later that night. I heard my mom’s voice calling from her bedroom.

“Julian, I need you here. Now.”

She sounded slightly commanding. I felt almost hypnotized, and my legs started walking toward the bedroom door, even though a voice in the back of my mind told me not to go.

Was this really her? How could I be sure anymore?

I opened the door. Darkness greeted me. I shuddered and instantly reached for the light switch. The room was empty. Unease and dread filled me as I closed the door.

I got halfway down the stairs when I heard her calling out again.

“Julian! Get in here! You and I need to talk!”

The voice now sounded much sterner than it had before, like a mom scolding a young child. Yet I wasn’t a child anymore, and that voice surely couldn’t belong to my mom.

I continued down the stairs when the voice yelled out so loud, it rattled the very bones of the house.

“JULIAN!! DON’T THINK YOU CAN GET AWAY, YOUNG MAN!! YOU ARE IN BIG TROUBLE!”

I darted down the stairs as fast as I could.

I searched for my mom around the empty, haunted rooms of my childhood home. I felt an intense need for her at that moment. My real mom, not whatever, had screamed at me from the bedroom or whispered about me in the middle of the night.

She was nowhere to be found. Then it dawned on me. I hadn’t checked the small storage room in the back of the bedroom.

I dreaded thinking of why she would be sitting there, yelling for me to join her. She wasn’t well. This wasn’t her. It couldn’t be. That thing had possessed her.

Then I remembered my grandma’s words.

“You have to confront it. There is no escape.’’

I went upstairs and into my mom’s bedroom once again.

There’s no escape. I couldn’t let it tear me apart… tear my family apart without at least putting up a fight.

I looked at the small door to the storage room. Hol and I had spent so much time in there. Our favorite hiding spot. We’d decorate the place with the Christmas ornaments my mom stored there. “Christmas in July!” We’d laugh and giggle until our stomachs hurt. My mom wasn’t a fan of the mess we’d sometimes make, but we loved it.

The door now seemed like a gateway into my childhood. Beckoning me home. I didn’t expect to find any cheerful laughter or Christmas decorations adorning the place, but I had to confront it.

I patted my pocket. The Polaroid and the crumbled old drawings were still in there. With a heavy sigh, I slowly opened the door, ready to put an end to this once and for all. Ready to find the truth. Whatever it was.

The light in the storage space hasn’t worked properly for some time now. Only the middle section was lit up by a weak bulb that didn’t provide much light. It left the far end in total darkness.

I gathered myself and called out.

“I don’t know what you are. Maybe some kind of demon… But I…”

A low, hissing voice slithered out from the darkness, a twisted mix of my mom's cold tone, Hol’s childish plea, and something darker beneath. The words oozed like poison, each syllable warped, unnatural.

“A demon, Julian? Such little imagination! When I’m done with you, you’ll wish I was a demon.”

The voice fractured, cracking like glass, but I heard them all—Mom’s reprimand, Hol’s laugh, Dad’s distant hum, his indifference—blending into one monstrous entity.

I felt something primal rise within me. Despite my fear, another feeling now took over. Anger. Anger because I had no idea what I had ever done to deserve this.

I called out again.

“I’m done running from you whatever you are!”

A chill went through every fiber of my being. The face emerging from the crawlspace, dimly lit, was that grotesque, horrifying insult to everything I remembered about Hol.

Her eyes had been blue, but not this blue. Not this unnaturally bright, icy blue, so bright they were almost white. Not these eyes, so full of all-consuming hatred, malice and pain. Her skin was pale, her lips red. But not this pale, not this red. Like blood in the snow. Her mouth looked like it had been placed upside down, distended, and warped into a silent scream. Then came that malignant smile. A mocking imitation of the small and crooked smile I remembered.

“How do I look? Not too bad, right?” the voice hissed and growled. “I guess I could’ve looked better if I wasn’t dead.”

A horrible cackling laughter filled the small storage space. It took me all the strength in the world not to run away instantly.

“You are not my sister.” My voice was shaking with uncertainty.

She slowly approached, sat down, and began rummaging through the Christmas decorations.

“You remember when we used to decorate this place, don’t you? Remember when you stepped on a glass ornament? It shattered, and you cried. I was there to comfort you, wasn’t I?”

‘’How could I know these things if I wasn’t your sister? Where were you, Julian? When I cried out in pain?’

I shook my head. “I was there… Hol. I…"

My grandma’s words echoed in my head.

“It knows you. It will turn everything you love into something ugly.”

I forced myself to face her.

“No. You liar! I remember. In the garden. I remember how we used to play and laugh. I remember how close we were.”

She laughed.

“Do you really!?”

She threw a glass ornament at me and hissed. It shattered on the wall behind me.

“Remember when I hid in Grandma’s house and you left me all alone?” She cried out. My entire body shook.

“No, that’s… It’s not what happened. You accidentally locked yourself in the playhouse... You… I remember…”

She slowly crawled towards me, her broken limbs making sick crackling noises as she slithered closer.

“LIES!!”

Tears of blood streamed down her pale face.

“And what about the time you hurt Leo? I loved that toy, Julian! You couldn’t take that, could you!?”

I started scooting away from her.

“I… apologized, didn’t I? I…”

She moved in for the kill.

“You couldn’t take that mom, and dad loved me more than they EVER loved you! They were afraid of you too! Did you know that?!”

Her broken limbs continued cracking as she moved closer. Her monstrously pale face inched ever closer to mine. Bloody tears dripped down on the carpet below.

“You pushed me when we played in the forest behind our house. Pushed me down that steep hill. I lay there for so long and you just stood and watched me!’’

She emitted a bone-piercing shriek, half a cry, half an angry outburst.

“IT HURT!! JULIAN! IT HURT SO BADLY!!!”

She was close enough for me to feel the coldness radiating from her dead frame.

The words left my lips in uncertain, doubting sobs. “No, Hol, I couldn’t have… that’s… that’s not me... It was an accident… That can’t be who I am!”

Her angry cries became louder.

I was about to admit how much I had failed her. I was ready to apologize—to her, to it, to Mom, Dad, and anyone who would listen. Ready for her to pass the final judgment and tear me apart. I just wanted it all to be over.

Just when I felt I couldn’t take it any longer, something in my pocket started burning. I took out the Polaroid. It trembled in my hands as I clutched it like a lifeline. It was all I had left of her—the real her. Not the pale, twisted thing that haunted me now, but the little girl who’d seen magic in every corner of the world. My fellow explorer. My Hol.

I pressed the photo to my chest as if I could anchor myself to those moments, to her laughter, to who we used to be. Hol and I, in the garden, smiles on our faces, standing shoulder to shoulder beneath the tall sunflowers, chasing rainbows, running wild like tigers.

It seemed to take notice, slowing its approach.

I took out the crumbled drawings I had made for her too.

I held all of it in front of me as a protective shield, screaming at the top of my lungs.

"I LOVED MY SISTER! SHE LOVED ME!!! YOU ARE NOT HER!!"

I kept repeating those words again and again. Each time, more self-assured, less doubtful.

It retreated slowly toward the darkness at the back of the storage space. Its loud cries slowed down into hurt whimpers, no longer as monstrous, no longer as threatening, now much more like a pitiful wailing. Amidst the chaos I heard a distant familiar voice call out, moving closer. Zeroing in on me as the monstrous apparition continued its retreat.

The door to the storage space opened. I heard my mom yell out.

"Julian?! What’s happening here!?"

I just sat there, unable to move. Unable to do much of anything but cry my eyes out. What must she think of me now? I thought. Sitting alone in a dark room, screaming and crying out into the void.

But then I felt her touch. Her embrace. A closeness I hadn’t felt from her for what seemed like ages.

"Julian, please, you have to talk to me. This can’t go on. Something is hurting you."

Her voice now seemed different. No malice, no blame, no accusations. Just concern and tenderness.

"We don’t talk much in this family." The words left my lips like a shaky whimper.

She gently took my face in her hands and looked at me. "Sweetheart, YOU don’t talk. I tried many times. Both your dad and I could sense there were things you wanted to say, but it seemed like the words always escaped you, like you just had no way of telling us how you felt. We’d get into arguments about the way you were acting out, but it would always go nowhere. Don’t you remember?"

Tears welled up in her eyes. "Then time passed, and… God forgive me, I guess we gave up. We never should have, but we did. We accepted that you didn’t want to or didn’t know how to talk about the things you were going through. You withdrew. It seemed to me you had eventually moved on, although I guess, in my heart, I knew better. I wish you had. But you got accustomed to the burden you were carrying silently, didn’t you? Until it became too much, and it all just came crashing down on you."

I shook my head, tears streaming down my face. "But you whispered things about me… you… It was my fault. What happened to Hol, I heard your whispers…"

She shook her head and wrapped her arms around me tighter.

"Sometimes, we hear and see the things we think we deserve. It’s true, I sometimes whisper to myself. That is my way of coping, but I would never blame you. How could I? It wasn’t your fault; you were just a child. It was an accident. You two were playing around, and she fell… I should’ve sensed it... The guilt you were carrying around. I should’ve done more to get you to open up.’’

The softness of her voice seeped through the slowly appearing cracks in the wall that had surrounded me. ‘’Jules… angel… I’m so, so sorry."

I held her tightly. I had no more fight left in me, no more will to resist what I had been keeping inside for so long. I tried to put into words what I never had been able to. "There are so many voices… So many whispers… I’m… I don’t know what to believe anymore."

She rubbed my back slowly, tenderly. "When there are too many voices, all of them surrounding you, wanting your attention… listen to the ones who speak with kindness."

Her soothing voice seemed to echo through the corners of the dark storage space, driving away the last remaining whispers.

We sat there for a while… In blissful silence, among the neatly packed up and dusty Christmas decorations, the old-time-weathered remains of my childhood sanctuary.

As I looked over my mom’s shoulder, trying to grasp everything that had happened, Hol’s pale and horrifying apparition was gone. In its place, I saw my 10-year-old self, staring back at me. So small, so fragile, so hurt, slowly withering away, leaving behind only a fading memory of tigers, rainbows, and sunflowers.
