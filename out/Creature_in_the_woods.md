The footsteps in the snow stuck out like a sore thumb. The snow blew through the trees, making it hard to stand on his own two feet. He was alone. No one came to my rescue. No critters lurking around outside his  field of vision, looking to aid him in his time of need. 

A growl came from a few yards away. It didn’t come from an indigenous animal that was known to harbor these woods. It was subtle but not inaudible. His  ears could not hear anything over the snow. 

His  heart rate began to go up. The hairs in his  body stood up. He felt like he was being watched. He didn't know who or what  it was, but only that he was being watched.

A second sound came and went. It was hard to hear.  It was definitely a growl of something, that much is true. 

He looked around and saw it. The glowing bloodshot eyes delved into his  eyes, reaching for his  soul. Its eyes wanted to feast on his flesh.

He ditched his  gear and ran to his cabin. The coldness of the snow blowing past me was the equivalent of ice shards scraping his  face.

The light of the candle in the cabin illuminated the darkness around. There was hope that he’d  get to live till the next sunrise, but it wasn’t over yet. He’d   still heard the growling, except now, they were getting more intense. He looked back for a second to see what was chasing me, and a saber tooth tiger came into view.

 Its arms were shredded. Parts of its legs were missing. Its footsteps didn’t make any coherent noise. 

The tiger tried to take a bite at him, but it barely missed by just a few inches. Its teeth could probably rip him apart.

He barely made it to his cabin. The door, to his surprise, was actually unlocked. 

The door rattled. It struggled to hold back the beast from breaking through the barrier. The wood from the door started to crack, gradually getting more and more  degraded until it was completely destroyed. 

The door roared when the tiger broke down the door. Its claws created cracks in the floor as it walked. 

He knew he’d  die. Unless a miracle happened which was highly unlikely.

The tiger bit at his hand. Human bones, ligaments, and flesh began to tear off. The sounds of his  hand collapsing under the pressure were loud sirens that echoed through the dark forest. He screamed in agony as his hand detached from his hand, causing blood to skewer out like a water sprinkler.

Once his hand was gone, it went for hislegs. It targeted his knees. It crushed the bones in seconds. The bones crunched intensely. The blood dripped throughout the floor. 

The screams abruptly stopped, and the man died. 

The tiger finished ripping the man’s limbs apart and disappeared into the cold, dark forest. The cabin was left completely exposed, leaving anything in the cabin, especially the expired body, vulnerable to the elements.
