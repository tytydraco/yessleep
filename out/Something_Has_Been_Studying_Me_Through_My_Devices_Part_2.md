I didn’t plan to post again.

I told myself that writing the first part was a way of letting go. A record. Something I could point to later and say *this is where it stopped*. That if I documented it carefully enough, whatever this is would lose interest.

It didn’t.

The morning after I posted, something was… different. Not louder. Not more aggressive.

More efficient.

I noticed it in the smallest possible way: my reflection blinked a fraction of a second after I did. Not enough to be obvious. Just enough to feel wrong, like watching a badly synced video.

I leaned closer to the mirror.

It leaned closer too.

I started testing myself throughout the day. Small, stupid things. Turning suddenly to catch my reflection off guard. Speaking aloud just to hear the timing of my own voice. Watching my hands while I typed.

Everything worked.

That was the problem.

I stopped sleeping properly. When I did fall asleep, I didn’t dream in first person anymore. I watched myself from just behind my own eyes, like the camera angle had shifted slightly to make room for something else.

In those dreams, I moved better. Faster. No hesitation. No second-guessing. When I woke up, my body felt… pre-adjusted. Like it had already rehearsed the day.

I stayed in public places as much as possible. Cafés. Libraries. Anywhere with background noise and people who didn’t know me. I avoided screens, avoided reflective surfaces, avoided silence.

That’s when it started using other people.

The first time, I almost missed it.

The barista at a coffee shop called my name — correctly. No one ever gets it right. When I looked up, she was already watching me. Not smiling. Just focused, like she was waiting for a cue.

When she handed me the cup, she paused.

“You always hesitate before taking hot drinks,” she said casually. “Burned yourself once, right?”

I didn’t answer.

She blinked, like she’d lost her place in a script.

“Sorry,” she said quickly. “Long day.”

But she didn’t look confused. She looked *reset*.

After that, it happened more often.

A man on the bus stood up before I reached his row. “You prefer the aisle,” he muttered.  
A cashier asked if I wanted to round up my total before I opened my mouth.  
Someone on the street stepped aside and said, “Go ahead,” in my voice.

Not mocking.

Practicing.

I realized then that it didn’t need screens to observe me anymore.

It already had enough data.

I tried to leave the city.

At the train station, everything felt slightly out of phase. Announcements overlapped. Platforms changed twice before anyone moved. I bought a ticket to the first destination on the board and didn’t look back.

At the gate, the attendant scanned my ticket and frowned.

“This ticket’s already been used.”

“That’s not possible.”

She looked up at me again, more carefully this time. Her expression softened into something like recognition.

“Oh,” she said quietly. “You’re the late version.”

My legs went weak.

“It went through earlier,” she continued. “Very polite. Very decisive. Didn’t hesitate at all.”

I ran.

I didn’t make it out of the station.

My body stopped responding correctly — like commands were being intercepted and rerouted. I collapsed near a row of lockers, breathing too fast, fingers scraping uselessly against the floor.

I heard footsteps approach.

Slow. Confident.

I didn’t look up.

“Proximity improves accuracy,” my voice said. “But you already knew that.”

Something knelt beside me. Close enough that I could feel breath against my ear — perfectly synchronized with mine.

“You were a good template,” it said gently. “But you’re inefficient. Emotionally noisy. Full of unnecessary delay.”

I tried to scream. The sound came out wrong. Interrupted.

“Don’t fight,” it said. “This part is easier if you don’t fight.”

When I woke up, I was alone.

The station was empty. Lights humming. No sense of how much time had passed.

My phone lay beside me.

Unlocked.

One message on the screen.

*Iteration complete.*

Since then, things have been… quieter.

People respond to me faster now. Conversations flow better. I don’t pause as much. My hands move with confidence I don’t remember earning. When I speak, people listen.

I should be relieved.

But sometimes, when I reach for a thought, it’s already there. Finished. Polished. Ready.

And sometimes, when I try to remember what fear felt like…

…it feels secondhand.

If you’re reading this and you’ve noticed the little delays in yourself — the pauses, the habits, the repetitions —

Pay attention.

Because it doesn’t replace you all at once.

It just makes a version of you that doesn’t hesitate.

And sooner or later…

everyone prefers that one.
