It’s Josiah again, hope everyone’s doing good. I’m certainly not. I was sent home from work today because I was distracted from last nights nightmare. People just don’t understand. Madison understands and I’m glad to have her but she’s at work so I’m here alone at home. Home in this shitty apartment. I’m going to try and get some sleep.

“Now it’s time to join your friends.”

It was the same dream again but it started where it had left off. Madison was still on the cross and the stench of rot surrounded me. I look at Traum and nut punch him. Traum cries out in pain and says.

“You little shit.”

Then falls to the ground in pain. I run out of the Church. It’s still foggy and pouring rain. But I know I can hurt him so I got something to cling onto.

I make my way down the street and see a street sign that says 5th ave SE then realized it’s near my families old house. I make my way down the street and see it. A sign of familiarity in this hell I find myself in. I run up to the steps and enter.

The first thing i notice is the smell. It was rot. I look around the corner into the living room and see more corpses. The people who bought the house were collected around the room watching tv. On the tv was a freeze frame of the Paradise City Art Studio.

On the tv stand was a note. 

“To the west of here we heard a lot of commotion a couple days back. I think it was at the Rose Residence.”

I put the note into my pocket and began to make my way to the Rose Residence. I walked to the door of the house I am  currently in and there was no sign of Traum. But I had the feeling of being watched. I know it’s better to ignore the obvious signs of go to this location and possibly die but I don’t have much choice. I looked in the garage and saw nothing. No tools to defend myself. If I was going to be forced to fight I would have to do it with fist.

I make my way over to the Rose Residence and on my way there I can’t help but look around and take in the sights. Nice suburbs of non identical houses. A true wonder to those who love house design. 

I am now in front of the Rose house. It does not look good. The glass is stained red. And there’s a hint of a metallic smell likely from the bloodied glass. Traum wants me to investigate his works. 

“Would you like a tour.”

It was Traum. But for some reason I wasn’t threatened. No fear or anything. I felt like a sheep being guided to my pen. And I felt compelled to say

“Yeah sure why not”

“Splendid. Right this way friend”

The sight when I got through that door was hellish. The floors stained in blood, the furniture was made of human skin. The walls covered with a blood splatter design. There was a tv made of human bones and on the screen was a freeze frame of the Paradise City Art Studio. 

“So this here is the living room. And if you are wondering. Yes the furniture is alive.”

“You say what now!?”

Simultaneously alarmed and confused on how the furniture could be alive.

“Yes the furniture is alive. That couch over there, that’s Jim Rose. Say hi Jim”

“Hi Joe it’s good to see you.”

“Jim what the hell Happened.”

“Long story come back some other time. You’re on tour of the lovely Rose Residence!”

“This way Josiah. Come see the kitchen.”

The kitchen was behind a wall past the living room. At first glance the kitchen was normal. If you disregard the oven.

“This here is Rosaline Rose. I made her into an oven because it’s where she spent most of her time.”

“That’s a little 1950’s of you to say Traum.”

Traum continues on into the bathroom. Immediately I realize there’s nothing special here. 

“Why am I in here Traum.” 

“Did you check the shower.”

I turn the shower on and yeah it was blood. 

“Onto the bedrooms!”

Past the living room was a hallway with 4 small bedrooms connected. To continue this forward a little quicker we got 3 beds. 1 in each room. The beds are made of human skin and bone from the people of the family. No children because they had all moved out.

“I couldn’t find the Rose Residence family children so I used the neighbors for the beds. Come lay down it’s quite comfy.”

“No im good Traum. I should get going.”

“You haven’t see. The last room boy.”

“Please call me Joe. I don’t like being called boy.”

“I can call you what I like you little shit.”

“Bye Traum”

As im walking out Traum says something to catch my attention.

“You still have your family left. I can always kill them if you don’t play along.”

“Traum your just a nightmare. You can’t hurt me!”

“Have you checked Madison’s hands. Next time you see her, look closely.”

I make my way into the living room and the radio turns on. It was playing screams of the people Traum had killed. I walked a little quicker but slipped on the blood soaked floor.

Then I woke up. Madison had just gotten home and i immediately got out of bed.

“Madi! Welcome home beautiful!”

“Hi joe.”

“Madi I had the dream again but it continued.” 

“Oh Josiah what happened?” 

We both sit on the couch and she signals me to
Lay next to her. I tell her the nightmare and was getting to the end of the story when I remembered what Traum had said.

“Next time you see her, look at her hands.”

That’s when I looked at her left hand and noticed a scar in the shape of a nail being stabbed into it.

Goodnight y’all. Sleep well tonight.
