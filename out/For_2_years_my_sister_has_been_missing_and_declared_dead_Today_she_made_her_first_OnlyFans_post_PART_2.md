“New video, account seems to have changed again:

Punta Cana Vlog! Ft. Craig, Kiara and Theo~”

My stomach did somersaults as I shot out of bed, wanting to throw my phone out the window yet also click the link so hard my screen cracked. I wrapped my arms around myself as I paced across my room, my head booming with viciously conflicting thoughts.

I can’t do this anymore… Something’s gotta give.

Against my better judgment, I caved and called my Mom.

“Hello? Aubrey?”

For a moment, I’d almost forgotten how to speak. “… Yeah. Hi… Hi.”

“Hi,” she echoed flatly.

Real productive.

“I, uh… I was just calling to see—”

“See what? What information you can pry from us?”

My brows furrowed as a knot fastened in my throat. “I… Wh— What?”

“Your sister is dead…” Her voice began to crack. “So stop posting about her online! Especially on these— these… forums full of sick people!”

Every muscle from head to toe stiffened. “Ma, I— I can explain—”

“No,” she interjected, her voice rising. “That’s the goddamn problem… You don’t know when to quit… ! You never did.”

Tears welling in my eyes, I struggled to form a sentence. “Mom, please… Just—”

“Aubrey… you need to stop calling the house until you get over it. Get over her… so we can, too.”

“Mom— !”

The phone buzzed like a flatline as she hung up.

“FUCK!” I raged, chucking my phone across the room before dragging my hands down my face.

I can’t be here… I can’t stand this fucking house anymore.

My heart ramming against my ribs, I drove to a local bar and sank into a stool, downing a shot of whiskey every time the memory of her and the videos came across my mind; the burn against my throat always shooed it away, but like a boomerang, it came right back. 

In about twenty minutes, I was plastered, laying my head against the wooden countertop as I painted water streaks with my fingertip from the beer glasses condensation. Sometimes when someone dies, people prefer to use the word “gone.” But they’re not gone, they’re dead. Few people understood what it was like to grieve someone that was just gone; an entire person, physically and spiritually, vanished to never return.

I couldn’t cry at a coffin, I can’t cradle her ashes. Being asked to “get over it” felt like I was being asked to draw blood from a rock.

“You alright there… ?” The bartender asked with a raised brow.

“Yeah…” I mumbled.

She slowly dragged my glass away. “I think you’ve had enough for tonight.”

“Whatever,” I gargled out a drunken scoff before sliding off the stool and stumbling toward the bathroom.

The concoction of alcohol in my gut sizzled and stirred as the bathrooms flickering yellow light strained my eyes. With my forehead against the toilet seat, I leaned my shoulder against the stall wall.

Get over it… Get over it… Three minutes… Get over it…

Repeated gulps of saliva poured down my throat, my mouth filling from the burgeoning urge to vomit.

Dead or alive… I just wanna see her… Is that so much to ask… ?

Then, I could feel it crawling up my throat. I lifted my heavy head before kneeling over the bowl, my stomach somersaulting with nausea. As my gag reflex triggered, I could feel my throat muscles tighten around something; there was more than just liquid running up.

Gripping the graffitied wall, I dry heaved as I desperately attempted to dislodge whatever was stuck. Once it reached the back of my tongue, I lowered my jaw farther and crammed a hand inside to fish for the end of it. Gagging with half my fist in my mouth, my fingertips hooked onto the end of it; it felt thin and slimy.

When I pulled, I could feel its length slithering against my skin as it resisted. Pinching it tighter, I groaned as I slowly tugged it out of my throat, spit dripping from my lips. As it passed my lips, I looked down to see what it was before bulging in disbelief. It was a film reel, perfectly intact and containing still frames that captured Kiara, Craig, Theo, and Bianca.

Tears welled in my eyes as I continued yanking it out, the roll practically never-ending. Paralleled by palm trees, the reel depicted them galavanting around Punta Cana, pointing at bright blue waters and curvy cocktail glasses. Drool spilled across the toilet seat, I was begging for it to end as the roll reached a foot in length.

The final frames showed them gathered at a bar made of straw, their faces warmly lit by torches. As their glasses inched closer and closer to clink, I’d finally removed the reel, gasps for air sucking into my lungs as I hacked up coughed. With the sticky roll dangling in my palm, I’d realized there was one last frame at the end of its tail.

From afar, it appeared pitch black, as if the shot were an accident or failed to develop correctly. But once I raised it closer to my eyes, I realized there was a faint silhouette amongst the darkness. It was Theo, standing with his back turned to the camera.

What the fuck… ? What the fuck is happening to me? Where is this footage even from? The cops never found her phone, they said it was most likely on her when she vanished.

… Most likely.

My heart drumming in my ears, I stared at the frame of Theo with a drowning sense of unease.

He was her boyfriend… and the last person to ever see her. Where the hell is he?

After cramming the film reel into my pocket, I stumbled out of the bathroom, slammed a twenty onto the bar counter, and decided my car was a tomorrow problem before ordering an Uber home. Once I returned to my bedroom, intoxication swirling in my head, I posted the other two OnlyFans videos to Reddit, along with the Theo frame. “I’m starting to think this isn’t a joke. Anybody know what this stuff means or where it’s even coming from? And where’s Theo now?”

“I’ve got a buddy that’s been IP hacking for years but he’s vacationing right now.”

“Is this some kind of horror ARG?”

“Where did you get the reel? You open to selling? I’m willing to negotiate.”

I gnawed at the skin around my thumb as I scrolled through the dozens of comments that swarmed in. Then, my computer dinged from a DM notification. I navigated to my inbox to find a message from a user named “JustFishing304.”

“You’re looking for Theodore McCormick?”

My hands shook over the keyboard as I froze on how to respond. “Did you know him personally?”

Typing…

“I asked a question first but I’ll take that as a yes.”

“Are you asking because you know how to help?”

“You’re full of inquiries.”

I rolled my eyes and huffed. “I don’t have time for this mysterious act. Do you have something to offer or not?”

Typing…

…

My teeth peeled a strip of skin from my pointer finger as I anxiously awaited their response.

“Send $1000 to @JustFishing304 on PayPal. You have 45 seconds, or the offer is closed and this conversation is over.”

My eyes darted around the screen in a panic as I attempted to process the hefty number that spiked my pulse. An imaginary clock ticked with descent in the forefront of my mind as I nearly fumbled my phone to the ground while opening the PayPal app.

41… 40… 39…

I cursed to myself as my Face ID login initially failed, requiring a second scan to access my account. When I logged in, my gut sank at the sight of my balance— let’s just say, it wasn’t even two digits, mind four.

34… 33… 32…

Fuck… ! What the fuck am I gonna do?!

Then, an imaginary lightbulb sparked above my head once I remembered I’d still had access to my parents account when they were funding my college tuition. Hurriedly digging through the passwords saved to my phone, I finally found their login before inputting it and breaching the account.

28… 27… 26…

Without a second thought, I selected the first checking account I saw, typed in “$1000,” and sent it to the stranger's address before haphazardly dropping my phone next to my computer and returning to the DM.

“I sent the full payment.”

Sweat beaded across my forehead as my shaking breaths echoed in my ears as if they were two empty caves.

C’mon, c’mon, c’mon…

Then, I practically jumped out of my skin once I saw they were typing a response.

“Theodore Maxwell McCormick. Age 24. 5 '10”, 158lb’s. Brown hair, green eyes. 48 Hollin Road, Castine, ME. You have ten seconds. This conversation never happened.”

I grabbed my phone, opened the camera and snapped a picture of the details before the conversation closed and deleted itself before my eyes. Attempting to slow my breaths, I stared intensely at the image before searching the address.

Through Google Maps, I found an image of his home; a quiet, dainty one-floor home surrounded by overgrown grass. After retrieving my car from the bar, I began my impromptu road trip to Maine. “What the hell am I doing?” I repeatedly asked myself with no incentive to turn back. After the nearly five hour drive, I unraveled from the car seat, my joints popping as I stretched my muscles in front of the tiny blue house.

When I approached his front door, my fingertip zapped with static upon buzzing the doorbell. Wrapping my hands around myself, I anxiously waited for a response. After minutes passed, I was mistaking my own thrumming heartbeat for footsteps before realizing nobody was coming to the door.

A black 4x4 sat in the driveway; I knew someone was home, so I rang the bell again.

“Hello?” I shouted softly.

No answer. Then, I looked at the doorknob.

Fuck it… I’ve come this far.

Expecting resistance, I was surprised to find the door unlocked. Creaking open like a burglar alarm, I slithered inside before gently closing the door behind me.

“Hell—“

My hand flew to my mouth as a putrid, pungent stench invaded my nostrils; it smelt like sunbaked roadkill. With my nose plugged, I cautiously entered a disheveled living room. The couch had one cushion more sunken in than the other, the TV smashed to a web of shards, and empty beer bottles littering the coffee table and the crummy carpet.

Jesus Christ…

Passing through the living room, I slowly turned the corner to enter the kitchen as the stench grew stronger. Then, I stopped at the foot of the dinner table, balling my fists as my blood boiled at the sight of Theo hunched in a chair, a ring of crusted blood around a bullet hole in his head, and a revolver in his loose grip. A maggot burrowed through the jelly of his eye, yet my stomach remained unturned; I wasn’t sick, I was furious.

Fucking coward. What the fuck did you do to her?

After a few minutes of cursing under my breath and punching my own forehead, I curled up on the front porch and called the cops, telling them I went to check on a friend and found him dead. I had to stay and assist in filing a report, before beginning a dead silent ride home, the air in the car as thick as tree sap.

Humiliation draped over me like a heavy coat; if I had any friends to tell what I was doing, they’d think I was psychotic. Once I got home, I belly-flopped onto my bed and cried into the sheets. My body felt like nothing more than a machine to produce pain in every form— tears, thoughts, nightmares.

My eyes red and puffy, I opened my phone's contact list and scrolled to Bianca’s number, my thumb gently grazing the screen as if it were her face. Then, I began ringing the number, holding it to my ear as more tears streamed down my face.

“Hi, you've reached Bianca. I can’t get to the phone right now, so… you get the gist. See ya!”

It was hard not to crack a smile upon hearing her voice. When the line beeped, I hung up and rang again just to hear it. Again, and again, and again.

On my sixth ring, it stopped midway through.

“Hello?” A voice answered.

My body stiffened and my blood ran cold.

I still pay for this number… it can’t have been reassigned.

“Hellooo… ?” The soft, familiar voice echoed.

No fucking way.

“Bi… Bianca… ?” I asked breathlessly; I couldn’t believe the name was even leaving my mouth.

“Yes? Who is this?” She responded impatiently.

I raised a hand to my aching heart. “It’s… It’s Aubrey.”

Silence.

“… Did we go to high school together or something?”

Taken aback, I stammered on my words. “Bianca, it’s Aubrey. Your sister.”

There was a beat of static before she chuckled under her breath. “Scam calls only work on old people… I’m an only child. I’ve got things to do, thank you!”

As my lips parted to respond, the call ended. I stared aimlessly with my phone remaining frozen to my ear, my eyes wide and breaths shallow and slow.

Am I going fucking crazy… ?

Tremoring from head to toe, I deleted all of my Reddit posts along with my account entirely. Next, I deleted every personal copy of the OnlyFans videos and burned the film reel with a lighter. I thought I’d wanted answers, but the closer I got, the more grief and dissatisfaction inflicted me. Lies and truths are a lose-lose game.

Two weeks passed— I’d returned to work in person, kept myself busy with my head buried in cubicle tasks, even made some new girl friends and had been swapping flirty glances with a new hire. Time heals wounds, but it doesn’t pull all the weight; you gotta put one foot after the other, too.

I was still plagued by sleepless nights from what’d happened, but it was better to cycle between suffering and trucking on instead of just wallowing. Nothing lasts forever, neither good nor bad; Bianca didn’t, but the unbearable agony of her loss won’t either. My fear of change morphed to gratefulness— nothing mattered, and it was incredible.

After walking in from an unexpectedly extended work night, I’d tossed my keys into their designated bowl before dragging my feet to my living room and limply flopping onto the couch. My cheek smushed against the cushion as I stared with one fluttering eye, I was jolted away by the vibration of my phone in my pocket.

With weak hands, I fished it out and raised the screen to my face. It was an unknown number, so I declined, crammed my phone into the sofa’s crevice and closed my eyes. Seconds later, I could feel it ringing again beneath me. With a groan, I dug it out and answered the call.

“Yes? Hello?” I grumbled.

“This is… Aubrey, right? Bianca’s sister?”

My muscles stiffened; it had almost finally been off my mind for the first time in over two years.

“Uh… yeah. Why, who is this? If you’re looking for some podcast interview, I’m not—“

“No, no— It’s Kiara.”

Goosebumps blossomed from head to toe before my skin grew numb entirely.

“I… Um… I’m— I’m sorry, I didn’t recognize your voice.”

“No worries, it’s been… a while.”

“Yeah, it, uh… yeah.” I gulped, my saliva barely squeezing past the knot in my throat. “Could I, uh… Why are you calling… ?”

My question struck her to silence.

“… It’s about Theo.”

I sighed with some relief. “I already know… I’m the one who found the poor sonofabitch.”

“No, Aubrey… It’s not that. He’s… He’s not dead.”

My brows furrowed with confusion as I snorted. “Uh, my two eyes say otherwise? Nature was already taking its course… his skin was like wet wallpaper. Look— I’ve already had a shit month, so if you’re just looking to wake sleeping dogs, I’m not dealing with it. Besides, why should I trust you? Do you know how much time you killed before reporting her missing? Your so-called best friend?”

“Aubrey, listen! We… We didn’t report her because we didn’t want her to be found!”

My puzzlement only deepened, my blood on fire and my heart revving.

“… What the fuck are you saying? What did you guys do to her out there?”

“You’re getting it wrong… it’s what she did to us. If you can even call that thing a ‘she’… !”

My expression curdled into a snarl. “That’s my sister you’re talking about—“

“Aubrey…” She cut me off insistently. “There’s so much you don’t know… and I’m sorry I didn’t tell you at the time. I couldn’t risk the consequences.”

“Wha— What consequences? What happened in Punta Cana? And what do you mean Theo’s alive?”

“He’s… not. He just… Fuck, there’s too much to explain and I don’t know how much time I have, I never know. She… She could be anywhere, anything. I can’t eat, I can’t sleep…”

My eyes darted aimlessly with anxiety. “Please… just tell me what happened!”

“I was never sure of which one it was, it was impossible to tell… but Theo’s ‘suicide’… He never came home on that plane.”

My brain was cramping; had she been going just as insane as me?

“I… I don’t understand. I’ve seen the security footage, his witness testimony— the stench of his flesh is still in my nose!”

“That’s what’s terrifying… The illusion isn’t cheap. It’s the kind of rabbit out of a hat that makes you wonder what else can happen. I didn’t know who was missing from that table… but I knew she was there.”

“Are you saying the footage is— is doctored?”

Her head-shake was palpable. “Nope, no. I knew that was the last time I’d ever see these people, I couldn’t even trust my own boyfriend.”

“Kiara… What did she do?”

“It was the night before we had to catch our flight, we all crashed in Craig’s basement to make carpooling easier… Around 3am I had to pee, but when I went to the bathroom, Bianca was in there… through the crack of the door, I… I could see her grabbing bunches of her hair and ripping them out without a flinch.”

“So, she… she was sick? She was sick and you guys wanted her gone?”

“Aubrey… I watched her hair grow back in seconds, right before my eyes. It was California blonde.”

I was speechless, the dense air clenching my throat. “Kiara… What are you saying?”

“I’m saying I saw something I wasn’t supposed to and I haven’t felt safe since— Theo definitely wasn’t.”

I almost laughed at the insanity. “Are— Are you saying she’s some kind of sh—

The call abruptly ended. “CALL FAILED,” was etched in bold on my screen, before seconds later, it chirped with a notification.

“New video, new channel— you get the deal:

Sexy Barbie Is Anything You Want Her To Be — NSFW”

I thought I…

The lapse in logic didn’t deter my curiosity that instantly magnetized. As if I’d entered fight or flight, I stared with wide eyes at the notification before tapping it as it began to slide away.  Fully sucked back into the rabbit hole, I tapped the link, prompting it to transfer me to the new account. “@VelvetBiancaXXX” was the handle,  accompanied by a profile picture of Bianca with blonde pigtails, crossing her eyes and sticking out her tongue. 

“What’s your fantasy? Come make it a reality with me. I can be your mistress, your stepmom, your slave— my pleasure is limitless.”

This time, the subscription was free, but once I accepted the generous offer, I was met with a paywall guarding the video, with a price tag of $304.

I need to get off this merry-go-round… and I will… just after…

With almost a strange sense of withdrawal, I eagerly clicked the button to purchase. Once the money had been deducted, I was provided access. The thumbnail entailed Bianca with bombshell blonde hair and diamond blue eyes, her provocatively posed body accentuated by a tight black-and-white striped one-piece bathing suit.

My heart practically echoing throughout the room, it skipped a beat as I pressed play. The video began with Bianca laying on her side across a satin, champagne pink bed with princess curtains, and a hand on her curved hip as she ogled the camera with a sensual daze. Her pigtails were curtaining her cleavage, which she quickly solved with one slick swipe.

“Is this everything you hoped for?” She asked, her voice buttery.

Then, she giggled to herself as her hand began slowly gliding down her side.

“No? Well… what’s your poison, big boy? You like… a gal on the thicker end?”

As her fingers delicately grazed over her hip bone, she detached her palm and angled it upward, the shape of her body morphing with it till her waist and thighs were meatier. Then, she sat up and rested on her knees, which were exaggeratively bruised to the point of appearing gangrenous.

“Not tickling your fancy either? Hm…” She pouted and tapped her cheek as she pondered.

Soon enough, her eyes widened with clarity. “I know… You like brunettes.”

Maintaining a sultry, red-lipped smirk, she raised a clawed hand to her hairline before digging her nails into her skin and hooking them into her scalp. Without budging, she began ripping the skin off her skull, stringy bits stretching like gum off the bottom of a table before wetly severing.

Blood poured like a waterfall down her face as peeled her hair off like it was a cheap wig. Once it’d detached, she tossed it to the side and grinned, blood droplets curving around her smile lines.

“You don’t need to see this part…” She swiped her hand across the camera lens, and once her palm unshielded its view, her face was spotless and her hair was now brown and tied.

“How’s this?” She paused after asking, as if she could hear the response.

Then, she frowned. “Not this either? Maybe it’s… my eyes? More of an emerald guy?”

With her coffin-shaped, black painted nails, she began burrowing around her eyeballs and into their sockets before locking her fingertips around the gelatinous organs before yanking them out with a swift, squelchy snap. Each moment whiplashed me harder than the last as I watched what looked like two white balloons inflating in her ocular cavities.

As they grew bigger, veins began to spread across them like roots, crystal green irises swirling in the center before the new pair of eyeballs filled her head. Rolling them around in her head to test them out like a new car, she then locked eyes with the camera.

“You like what you see?”

I was paralyzed with terror, yet overwhelmed with infatuation. It was like passing a pileup on the highway— you couldn’t look away.

Once again, her expression deflated.

“What… What else can I do?” She wondered defeatedly as she raised her pointer finger to her teeth before biting on the tip of her nail and tearing it off.

The wrinkly scarlet flesh under her fingernail was replaced by a white painted nail that erected at rapid speed.

“You prefer that? How- How about…”

Mania stirring in her eyes, she moved onto her middle finger, blood trickling down her finger as she ravaged the nail before spitting it onto the floor; a dark purple nail appeared in its place.

“This? Is this… Do you like it? Are you full?”

Then, with a third finger clenched between her teeth, her stare abruptly shifted to a haunted sense of recognition, her hand slowly retracting from her mouth. My expression like horror trapped in stone, I’d almost wanted to back away from the screen as it felt like she had suddenly been able to see that someone was looking back.

“… Aubrey?” She mumbled.

The world around me went quiet as tears welled in my eyes. “Bianca… ?”

She blinked rapidly as she inched closer to the camera, the silk sheets wrinkling beneath her touch. “You… You found me. You found me.”

Smiles stretched on our faces as a tear streamed down my cheek.

“Bia… How are you… Is this really you?”

Her smile faltered at the question. “… Do you want it to be?”

“Bia- Bia it’s me. You can talk to me… ! What the hell has been going on? Kiara called me and said—“

“Kiara knows nothing about nothing… she never did. None of them did.” Her face stiffened with stoicism. “Theo only fucked me with the lights off and then put in headphones when I cried myself to sleep. First night in Punta Cana, I caught Craig hammered with his face buried under another girl's sundress. When I told Kiara, she called me a jealous slut and that I needed to worry about fixing my own relationship first.”

As she spoke, the walls around her began melting, the curtains turning into a waterfall of pink sap.

“I have been told who I am, who I’m not, who I’m supposed to be… And I’m to blame for actually being able to change now?”

As the room around her disintegrated, it accumulated into a pile of mush that slithered toward Bianca and, once mixed together, diluted its color till it matched her skin tone.

“I can be the sob story, the mad villain, the unlucky hero… I can be me… I can be you.”

I trapped a gasp in my cheeks as she swiped her palm over the lens again, reappearing as an identical clone of me; while the peachy mush began merging into her body, revealing the true exterior underneath the faux walls, which were made of splintery wood from floor to ceiling.

“I can be… a mysterious web surfer. A mysterious suicide. But… I’m getting a little bored of mystery, aren’t you?”

My voice box jammed by the knot in my throat, the phone shook in my fragile hands as I stared back silently. Once the illusionary room had deconstructed itself and returned to her body, I was able to observe her surroundings in its entirety. Next to her on the dusty floorboards were cardboard boxes stacked on and next to each other, big and small with writing etched across some of them.

“You’ve been on a pretty wild goose chase… I hope we’ve both had some fun. It’s okay if you don’t like the ending… I can always make a new one.”

Then, my blood curdled as I read one of the labeled boxes next to her foot, the scribbles instantly recognizable as my mothers handwriting. “Bianca’s Stuff,” it said, with a box of tangled Christmas lights resting above it.

As the video came to an end, I jolted from my paralysis, tears streaming from my bulging eyes as I slowly arched my head toward the ceiling.

“Bianca… ?”

Silence followed, until something thudded against the attic floor.
