**Part 3**

The demon is only several feet above me now. I’m tucked as narrowly as possible into the deep groove of a tree, praying that I’m concealed enough for her not to notice me. Her crimson serpentine tongue is lowered so close in front of me that I can reach out and touch it. It draws even closer to me, sensing me… then its mouth unlatches like a ravenous, feral Venus flytrap, but whose edges are rimmed with jagged, knife-like teeth. It is hellishly worse than Jean described. I continue to hold my breath but can’t close my eyes. And as I gaze into the mouth of the demon’s tongue… I see it is salivating blood.  
   
Then in the distance, about forty paces away: a rustling in the brush. The mouth, the tongue, retract at breakneck speed and the demon dives off in the direction of the noise. I make a break for the deer carcass, lift up the three-hundred-and-fifty-pound body, and compress myself underneath it making sure no part of me is exposed.  
   
The winged beast darts back to the tree I ran from and encircles the small area. The deer corpse is now crushing me. It has been dead for a while now and its putrid rot is making me gag. I hold it in. Maggots crawl over me near my mouth, nose, and eyes. I let out a stifled gag and the demon swoops directly above the deer.  After a minute of dense, unraveling fear… she flies away.  
   
I endure a few more minutes of bone-flattening constriction and a few maggots up my nostrils before I get out from under the hulking carcass. I needed to be sure she’s really gone. Then I vomit. From fear, or the rancid taste that has crept into my mouth, or the maggots, or all of the above.  
   
I don’t take a minute to compose myself. I don’t have a minute. I run through the massive orchard in strategic long zig-zags in pursuit of the demon’s lower-half. I have to mark the soil at the base of trees to make sure I’m not passing the same ones over and over. After a few hours and combing through some sharp undergrowth, I get to a large pond deep into the far end of the orchard. At the shore of the pond, I find a neat stack of clothes, a coat, jeans, a sweater, and her bra. A few steps down are her legs and lower abdomen.  
   
I am clutching the salt. The time has come to end this once and for all. I made it here. I’m ready to actually sleep knowing that Jean and the baby are safe. Ready for when the sun comes up and I can finally live in a world without Elisa. At least then I’ll have a fighting chance at moving on. I can have a real life. I’m still young, maybe I can find love again. Even one day have a family. And I won’t always have to be looking over my shoulder making sure me and all the people I love aren’t in danger. All I have to do is pour the bag of salt in my hands over the sinewy pile of organs atop her lower-half right in front of me.  
   
But as I stare at her privates scantily outfitted with satin panties, her mesmerizing legs (all the same except for the ghost-like pallor)… I’m taken further and further into the caverns of my mind; I am becoming paralyzed. Living beings have the most intricate ways of protecting themselves, in fact most of their body parts are fashioned toward survival. The sea cucumber, for instance, pushes its digestive (and poisonous) organs from its anus toward predators so that it might see another day. The hybrid human-demon that is Elisa is no different. Her legs and her crotch are *hypnotizing* me as a last line of defense. Her body parts protect her by sowing doubt into my mind and by reflecting back to me the times in my life that bring me shame; they are a mirror, but a funhouse mirror that magnifies only my shadows.  
   
All of a sudden, I am forced to watch an inescapable movie: the time I snuck a five from my father’s wallet as a boy and he looked all over for it… on the playground where I stood back as another child was pounded on for being a pansy… cheating on an exam in college because I knew I didn’t have what it took… So many moments where I was downright despicable. More recent memories too: early in my career when I laughed at one of Jimmy’s lewd comments about a hot secretary… my quick dismissal of Elisa the day we broke up… how I listlessly stared at Jean being sedated and, although I knew that she was right, I. Did. Nothing.  
   
This kaleidoscope of shameful scenes has an effect which weakens my faith in myself as it shows me my spinelessness. When this is over, I can’t trust my judgement at all and I question why I am here. Then I fold into a ball and weep. My cries quickly turn to heavy, harrowing sobs. The last year and change have broken me. Falling in love, finding out my love is a demon, the demon attacking my sister, and now this mission to kill the demon. Elisa. I have raged against what has happened, I have denied its existence, taken the blame for all of it, and now— finally—I’m fighting it (or at least trying). But never once, not even for a second, have I mourned it… until now. That’s what comes up with my tears: the loss of love, of my sanity, of a baby, of an innocent world where monsters don’t exist. I cry harder for having held this all back all this time, hell, my entire life. The dam has broken and, although I am in imminent danger, there is a safety in being vulnerable beside this pond in the wee hours of the night.  
   
In this rawness I come to complete truth. As particles of sun rays lighten the darkness, I understand what has sustained me all year. Within the maze of my mind and heart, I am shown the only thing that has kept me going. And as the terrorizing form of the demon—the pallor of death itself, with its haunting face and soulless eyes—slashes the air as she makes her way toward me— to rejoin the half she’s left behind… I surrender to the current of life. Or death.  
   
As she nears, I drop the bag of salt. The demon agilely floats her upper-half to meet her lower half. And I see what I saw that night in the corn field, *but in reverse*. The halves, the organs, the intestines, fuse together. The wings slowly retract into the scapulae. Her gray, dead skin takes on the warmth and glow of vitality. Finally, her face mutates: the sharp angles soften, the lips and cheeks turn from an ashen hue to soft and supple blush, and the black holes that were her eyes shrink down to recognizable pupils surrounded by umber irises, held in milk-white mandorlas. I haven’t seen her face in so long and finally… I am home.  
   
She is as raw as I am: naked with blood smeared over her mouth and chest. For both of us, there is no more hiding. No one talks; it’s not the time. Instead, she steps into the pond and I do what I have done since she entered my life. I follow her. The pond is much warmer than I anticipated and it provides a relief from the crisp autumn air.  
   
In the water we bathe each other. I wash the blood off of her and she gently scrubs the tears, the dirt, and blood from the deer that encrusts my body. I have forgotten how being close to her completely relaxes me and—after the release of so many intensely-held emotions—in the water… I finally start to *feel* myself again.  
   
Back at the shore, we change back into our clothes and walk across the orchard. For the first time since knowing her, we talk in full honesty. Because of the rollercoaster of emotions and physicality of the deranged evening, the first question I ask her is,  
   
“Was any of it true? Did you love me?” I have to know.  
   
“I loved you very much. It was all true. I mean, except for the lies to keep you from finding this all out.”  
   
Hearing that she loved me gives me a world of peace. I need to know more. “Did you kill Jimmy?”  
   
“Yes,” she answers. “He was a rapist and a murderer and his family went to great lengths to make sure he would never get caught.”  
   
I’m completely thrown by this. “I thought he was just your run-of-the-mill asshole.”  
   
“He was that too. And a lousy trader, but that’s not why I took his life,” she replies.  
   
“What about Old Fashioned?”  
   
“Well after I overheard that conversation in the bathroom, my instinct told me to look further into it.” She pauses. “I’m happy what I told you helped you with your job…” Then she takes a breath. She’s not trying to find her words; she’s battling with her feelings.

“There are wars that have killed fewer people than that guy. The chemicals he’s released into the water… the people who live by the factories, the lucky ones die quickly. And the children…”  
   
Although I’m taken by this unexpected moral justice theory for her kills, her last three words orient me back to the reason I drove out here in the first place. I bring myself to ask the question, aware that there is no going back from the answer.  
   
“What about Jean? What did she possibly do to deserve— What did her baby do?”  
   
Elisa lets out a long sigh. I’m truly afraid of what she will say and what happens next.  
   
“Nothing. She didn’t deserve what happened to her. And for that, I am truly sorry.”  
   
Her words hang in the misty air for a while. Tired and overwhelmed, I take a seat at the base of a tree. Elisa follows.  
   
“As much as I can, I try and do the right thing, but the night we broke up, I let my anger get the better of me and I did something barbaric. I attacked Jean as a monster, but going out to Tuxedo Park and targeting her… I was human when I made that decision. I don’t expect you to forgive me. I don’t deserve forgiveness.”  
   
At that moment, I don’t forgive her. And almost forty years later, I still don’t forgive Elisa for what she did to Jean.  
   
It takes me a good while to speak again. “Do you… learn things about people through their blood?”  
   
She nods. “Everything they know, I come to know.”  
   
This piece of information is so much to absorb. My mind races wanting to know everything she’s ever learned, but I understand this isn’t the time. Something inside me is driving my questioning, only ascertaining what I need to know to move forward. We get up and walk now.  
   
“Were you born like this?” I ask. I need to understand her as much as I can and maybe her answers will help me.  
   
“No. I was born… normal,” she says smiling. “In 1602.”  
   
She lightly laughs. I let my shock settle before I find the humor in her impeccable comedic timing. She goes on,  
   
“My family served one of the Filipino generals who worked with the Spaniards. My mother was the seamstress for his family and my father tended to his farm. While the general was key in abetting Spanish rule—building churches and maintaining control of the people who belonged to the land—his wife, Josefina, held deep contempt for the colonizers and grew resentful of her husband. All the children, me and my brothers and sisters and the children of the general, were none the wiser to the politics of the times. I grew especially close to Fernando, the general’s eldest. He was my last young love.”  
   
“Your last?” I question, slightly bruised.  
   
“Yes, my last *young* love. What would happen after we fell in love would weather and harden my heart. My appearance may not reflect the years and tragedy I have endured… but my heart remembers.”  
   
I am enthralled by Elisa’s words artfully depicting the situations and feelings she experienced four hundred years ago. “What happened?”  
   
“The Spanish generals in my town started to fall ill and die… one by one. Their wives couldn’t carry babies to term. They called it an influenza that only seemed to affect them because of their divine Spanish blood. But I remember my *Lola* (\*grandmother in Tagalog) would tell me it was the Manananggal, but back then, I thought that was a backcountry legend.  
   
When I was 18, I became pregnant and since Fernando knew his parents would never approve, he arranged for the priest to marry us in secret. Our plan was to run away to Manilla and start a new life together. But as much as I tried to hide the pregnancy… Josefina somehow found out. At the time… I was so hopeful and excited, I didn’t catch that she knew our secret…”  
   
“Oh God…” I reflexively respond. My defensiveness of Elisa already percolating. She continues,  
   
“I remember coming home from the market with Fernando’s favorite snack… warm bibinka… but he’s not there. My brothers tell me that there was a chance for Fernando to get passage to Spain and go to school there, and because the general has been so worried about people in the town dying… Fernando boarded the ship early this morning. My brothers explain that he was forced on the ship, dragged from the house… fought with all his might to stay here. They don’t understand why Fernando acted like that. Spain is described to all of us like some cosmopolitan paradise… who wouldn’t want to go?”  
   
“He wanted to stay with you and the baby…” I remark. I know this sounds insane, but I understand Fernando in that moment. She keeps going,  
   
“I don’t know what I am going to do. I am a woman with very few options. Soon I will start to show and once the general’s family finds out, I’m not sure what will happen to me. I go to the docks and find out that Fernando’s boat is headed to Seville. And there is another boat headed to Seville **tomorrow**. The first mate comes out and tells me the cook on the boat has just fallen ill, so if I can make meals for the crew, they can offer me free passage.  
   
Back then, I didn’t compute what might happen to me or the baby on the long journey from the Philippines to Spain. I just needed to follow Fernando. And this passage, it seemed like…a sign from God.”  
   
I see Elisa reflecting back on her life long ago, many lifetimes ago, through the prism of her mind now. I am starting to comprehend that while my thoughts are linear, at best two-dimensional, hers are a galaxy. The span of experiences she must contain, the history lived through, feelings felt, it seems infinitely endless. I feel honored to be the recipient of her story. I’m sure not many have been in my shoes. She continues,  
   
“I go home and pack a bag with the little I had of value and hide it under my bed. I include a small knife to protect myself from whatever might happen on a boat where I will be the only woman. I tell my mom and dad, my brothers and sisters that I love them. They think I am acting really funny.” She warms up reminiscing.  
   
“Then after I say my prayers and fall asleep… I dream that the baby and I are attacked by the Manananggal… but I fight back. I reach under my mattress, get the knife from my sack, and stab the tongue of the Manananggal. It draws back up to the roof. Somehow… in the dream I can sense the Manananggal is Josefina.  
   
I wake up the next morning, and I can feel in my bones that the baby is safe. But when I find blood on the knife under my bed and I see Josefina through the window of the big house, holding a compress to her mouth… I register that Lola’s stories weren’t old wives’ tales.  
   
Before I leave for the docks, I kiss every sleeping member of my family goodbye and leave a sack of salt by each of their mattresses. Salt is quite valuable then, but I know each of them will understand what this means and do what needs to be done.”  
   
At this point in the story, Elisa and I have walked over to a Japanese style farm house on the property. She opens the door inside. I grow worried.  
   
“We can’t break in Elisa-” I meekly warn-  
   
“It’s my house, Will,” she says chuckling.  
   
Inside are tatami floors, a simple stone kitchen, and minimalistic rooms. Amidst 80’s decadence, this level of streamlining and simplicity is revolutionary. But then again, so is Elisa.  
   
She has a glass of water. So do I. Then we have tea. Although this might seem like a trivial detail to include, it’s what happened. As she recounts to me the story of how she became a demon, after I witnessed her transform from a demon, these small habitudes, the things most couples do every day, reaffirm her humanity to me. I’m reminded of how we once were. Of the life we had, not the romantically cinematic scenes that speckled our time together, but the existence made of the non-momentous: coffees, waters, good mornings, and goodnights said while the sun was up.  
   
She slices me an apple as I call out of work from her house phone. Looking back, it’s crazy to think that in the middle of the origin story of a four-hundred-year-old demon, I take the time to call out of work. But that’s reality; our entire world can change but life goes on. There’s something very comforting in that for me. When her thirst is quenched and she has recovered from a night of hunting, she goes back to her story: what happened on the ship.  
   
“It was pure hell. I was having morning sickness every day on an ancient ship sailing through tropical storms. The very men who called my people savages lived in ways so vile, it makes me sick just thinking about it.  
   
At the end, my little knife couldn’t stop the men. I don’t remember much except… several of them held me down. When they were done, I screamed for help but no one came. They tried to shut me up and when they couldn’t… they took out their own knives, much bigger ones, and stabbed me until I was quiet. Then they had to get rid of the body.”  
   
I feel sick at this point, but I understand where the story is going. “They chopped you in half…” I guess accurately.  
   
“And put me in a chest that they sank to the bottom of the ocean,” she finishes.  
   
“How did you get out? When?” I push.  
   
“I don’t know how I got out or came to life as what I am now. But I believe it must have happened when Josefina died… when my brother killed her.”  
   
I have no words when Elisa wraps up this part of the story. I reach toward her and embrace her. I do this for so long that it becomes me holding her and her letting herself be held. When she removes herself from my embrace, it’s her turn to ask the questions.  
   
“Why didn’t you kill me?”  
   
“I couldn’t,” I admit. I take my time choosing my next words. Lord knows I haven’t done so before and it’s bitten me in the ass. “I wanted to, but when it came to it, I just couldn’t bring myself to. The night you attacked Jean and her baby, I saw you transform.”  
   
She’s startled at this information but nods, urging me to continue.  
   
“Well since then, safe to say I’ve lost it in about every way a man can lose it. Tonight, I realized that there is something so much worse than everything I’ve learned… and been through.”  
   
“Dying?” she suggests.  
   
“No,” I return. “Living. I’ve tried to do it without you, but tonight I understood that whatever I’ve been doing while we’ve been apart isn’t living… it’s something else. The only thing I’ve ever known about life is being… in your presence.”  
   
She furrows her brow. She can’t believe where I’m going with all this. I barely believe it myself, but right now I need to get out what is on my heart:  
   
“I didn’t understand what kept me going all this time, but now I understand that it’s you. Nothing about anything makes sense except when I surrender to loving you… all of you… that makes sense.”  
   
She smiles and I can feel myself come alive again.  
   
“So now you know all my secrets… Well, the ones that you need to know,” she offers.  
   
“Whatever happens now, at least there are no more lies.” I respond. This is part of the surrender I told you about. I didn’t think she would harm me, but I accepted my faith when I dropped the bag of salt.  
   
“A little earlier I told you a lie,” she confesses.  
   
*I deflate. Dreamed too big. I was foolish to believe she would consider having me in her life again…* Then,  
   
“When I told you I loved you very much, that wasn’t true…”  
   
*Damn. Is this woman trying to kill me?!*  
   
“The past-tense part. Will, I ***still*** love you. With all my heart,” she confesses. Her timing is a work of art.  
   
Now I collapse and let her embrace me, which lingers into letting her hold me. When she is done, I run to my car to get something important: the ring from my briefcase. I knew there was a reason I never let it go. Everything makes sense now.  
   
When I get back, I beg her to make me whole, to make me the happiest and of course, luckiest man alive. And for reasons far beyond my limited comprehension, she says yes. Next October, in a private ceremony, we get married on this orchard. Only our families attend—well, Jean, Doug, and their baby girl excluded.  
   
Though many may not understand it, marrying Elisa has far and away been the most magnificent and meaningful decision of my life. As I have grown old (and she’s seemed to remain frozen in time), I have been able to live a life past my very wildest dreams. But I won’t spend this valuable time bragging.  
   
I don’t have much time left, and as the sun sets on my life, it sets outside on our porch. The nurses and all the family members of our great house have wheeled me out to be with Elisa for my final breaths. So, allow me to return to where I began, the warning of how to stay alive if you are to come across a Manananggal.  
   
First off: know your weakness. Physically, mentally, spiritually, and emotionally. Don’t fight what is greater than you, instead surrender to it. We, and I’m talking to the men reading this (although it can pertain to any person), spend too much time trying to prove to everyone else that we are better than we are. And frankly, that is a waste. Lean in to knowing you are up against an entity older, wiser, stronger, and more evolved than you will ever be. If you try to fight her, **you will die.**  
   
This brings us to number two: surrender to death. Knowing death lurks around every corner has allowed me to actually take a gamble on truly living. I’m talking about dancing to no music, writing your beloved letters declaring your affection, letting the fuck go of what people may think of you, and unapologetically pursuing what you are on this earth to do. Knowing that death is around every corner will propel you to live.  
   
Remember we are all monsters. Yes. I said it. Elisa is just a raw embodiment of our collective and individual very human behavior. In a way, this makes her way of living more honest. But we all harm people. Directly or indirectly, we engage in practices that kill innocents. We call others monsters to deflect from recognizing our own reflection, the monster within ourselves. Once we begin to accept our own darkness, we are not as hasty or eager to judge. Like I said, I have not forgotten nor forgiven Elisa for what she did to Jean. Since the birth of my niece, Jean and I have loosely been in each other’s lives but nothing has ever been the same. As I have reflected back at everything through the years I see that, although Elisa is the easiest to blame, I had a major part in what happened. I could have believed Jean at the family lunch, could have called sooner, in the looney bin I could have told her she was right. And I haven’t forgotten or forgiven all my “could have’s but didn’t”s. The damning things I’ve done are about the only ways I consider myself somewhat equal to my wife. And the only way through has been to look past my own monstrosity and into my humanity. This mentality will not only save you from the Manananggal, but perhaps it might even save you from yourself.  
   
And finally, if you are seeking to live a long life, hell, to be immortal… love the woman and the demon with every fiber of your being.   
   
I used to think that immortality was achieved through children and grandchildren—and yes, I have plenty of those: Ronaldo, Ate Bing Bing, and the many people who help us in the house are our family and their children and grandchildren have become ours—but love… what I feel for Elisa and what she feels for me… will live as long as she lives. This might not be forever, but it is pretty damn close.  
   
I type this at my last sunset, before my final honor of telling Elisa I love her, and the great privilege of hearing it back… before I watch her majestically transform. After a lifetime of living for the sun and precious hours with my beloved, I welcome the night.
