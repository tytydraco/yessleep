I got into a car accident a few weeks ago.

One moment I was tapping a finger along to Boston's *more than a feeling* on my morning commute to work, the next, I was in a hospital gown in an unfamiliar white room.

A doctor told me a semi had blown through a red light and t-boned me on the drivers side of my car, the end result was having my left leg amputated below the knee.

I may have walked...well, begrudgingly *wheeled* away with my life, but the driver of the semi wasn't so lucky. He flew through the windshield of his truck and slid twenty some odd feet down main street, leaving a trail of blood and organs behind him like a meat crayon.

I was extremely bitter after my accident, I began picking up the bottle more often than not, and friends began distancing themselves from me, leaving me isolated in my new handi-capable apartment.

Sometime last week, I woke up and noticed the whiskey glass on my nightstand was almost empty so I hoisted myself into the wheelchair beside my bed and rolled into the kitchen to freshen it up. That's when I heard a slow *clomp, clomp, clomp* coming down the hallway, like somebody was playing hopscotch.

I immediately spun around *WHO THE FUCK IS THERE!? I MAY BE IN A CHAIR BUT IT WONT STOP ME FROM PUTTING A HOLE INTO YOU* I screamed as I reached for the small handgun I had holstered to the right arm of my chair.

*clomp, clomp, clomp*

*IM WARNING YOU! IM NOT FUCKIN AROUND.*

I was sweating profusely and my thumb almost slid off the hammer of my pistol as I tried to cock it.

*clomp, clomp, clomp*

I took aim at where I thought the intruders midsection would be as I waited for him to turn the corner, and I found myself face to face with... a leg. Well, most of a leg anyway, a leg that was severed just below the knee.

I didn't know what to do, I just stared at the thing and it seemed to stare back at me. Then it began hopping towards me and I freaked out and took a few shots at the thing. The first two missed but the third caught it and sent it sailing off somewhere down the hallway. I was met with a burning white pain where my own leg once was and I passed out.

I woke up sometime later to loud knocking and somebody yelling at my door *SIR, THIS IS THE POLICE, IS EVERYTHING OK IN THERE? WE HAD A REPORT OF SHOTS FIRED.*

Disoriented, I weakly rolled over to the door to answer it, my head was pounding like an elephant on a bass drum as I unlatched the lock to let the officer in.

The cop looked down at me and frowned pitifully. I must have looked like a wreck, I hadn't showered in a couple days and reeked of booze, that's when I realized I spilled the remnants of my drink into my lap when I passed out, making it look like I pissed myself.

*Yeah, uhh... somebody broke in, but I scared them off I guess*

The officer raised an eyebrow and told me he would have to make a report of this. He didn't seem to want to stick around too long, something I was getting used too. My new disability combined with my disheveled appearance seemed to make a lot of people uncomfortable.

I locked the door back up and began to wheel myself towards the kitchen to get back to business when I froze up. The fucking leg was standing beside my open living room window.

I saw the calf muscle tense up like a runner about to take off. *WAIT* I yelled, but it was too late, the leg went flying out of the window. I sped over as fast as I could and peered out just in time to see it smack to the ground, 8 stories below.

I had experienced phantom sensations before where my leg used to be, like an itch that's now impossible to scratch. But I had not yet known phantom pain. When the leg hit the ground, I felt an explosion of agony, like a hydraulic press had come down onto my shin, I felt bones that were no longer there cracking and breaking.

I don't know what to do, I'm being haunted by my leg, maybe I'm going insane but the thing keeps fucking with me. Last night I woke up to a sharp pain and found the foot merrily hopping around in thumb tacks.

I don't know why this is happening, but I'm starting to think that... maybe it cant pass on without the rest of me. Some nights I wake up and see it in my wheelchair flicking at my gun with its big toe, it wants me to join it, and at this point, I'm really starting to see that an option.

Have any of you ever heard of something like this? This thing is wearing me out and I'm at a loss for what to do so please drop me a line, any advice at all, thanks.
