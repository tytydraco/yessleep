Have you ever had those nights where you just couldn't sleep, no matter how hard you tried?

Yeah, well, one night, that was me.

I was about 5, laying in my room and staring at the wall out of boredom. My long brown hair resting on the pillow, my dark brown eyes reflecting off the light in the corner of my eye.

I got up after a bit, it was midnight, and I was bored.

I walked outside of the room and peered down the hallway, my eyes couldn't quite focus right, but I saw something. I was confused at that, I could feel it staring at me, though..my mom, maybe?

So I called out to it.

"Mom? Mama?" I spoke, scared to walk closer to the figure in the hallway that just stood there idly. I could see the light illuminating it..somewhat. I couldn't see it, but it resembled that of my mother.

I didn't want to go back into my room, it was too hot, but I didn't want to stay out here. I turned around to go back to my room and I felt something cold press up behind me.

"Mama?" I spoke again, my voice shaking. Whatever was behind me disappeared when I turned around, shocked as I was, I almost began crying. The idle figure that was there a moment ago was gone and I was left there. Alone.

1:00.

I ran back to my room and locked the door, sitting my back against the coldness, and avoiding locking my gaze with the window, for fear I would see the figure.

I didn't see it.

I laid back down in bed, but couldn't sleep.

The wind that blew so eerily, the sound of my own breathing, the sound of what I felt like was that of somebody else breathing, the sound of a tree branch scratching at my window, the ominous whispering I could heard, but might've just been my imagination.

As the wind kept blowing, I could feel someone's..or something's eyes on me.

The coldness or the malice of their gaze, I could feel.

My own breath now beginning to feel like it was theirs.

How I could feel as if they were right outside, their eyes on me the whole time.

I didn't do anything, I didn't move, I didn't speak.

I laid there in bed and sighed, hoping it was just my imagination.

I wasn't completely sure, though. My 5 year old brain wasn't able to comprehend exactly what had just happened. All I knew was I saw Mama, or so I thought, but there wasn't Mama.

I was scared and cold and I wanted to cry. Wanted to scream. Wanted to say that it wasn't my Mama. Wanted my Mama, but my Mama was asleep, and I was scared to wake her up. Why would I, anyway? That's so dumb, I thought. I was a tough kid now.

But was it really my imagination? Fake? Well,

Guess I'll never know.
