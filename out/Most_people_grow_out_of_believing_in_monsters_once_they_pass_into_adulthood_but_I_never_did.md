My life has been defined by a fear which is not only irrational, but totally ludicrous and juvenile. I knew then, as I know now, that it is totally ridiculous and shameful to believe in monsters as an adult. Perhaps I could have been cured of this fear if I had chosen a therapist other than Dr. Ward, or maybe not, but now I know that this fear will never leave me for as long as I live.

My fear can be traced to a singular incident in my early adolescence, when I was shown the movie “The Twilight Zone” from 1983. That horrible, damnable opening scene is what did me in for good. The idea that someone you called a friend, someone you had known for years, could suddenly reveal themselves to be a horrible monstrous creature and attack you was too much for my small mind to bear. From that point on, after having watched that fateful scene, I became suspicious of everyone that I was close to.

I lived in constant fright, always nervous that my loved ones would cast away their facade of humanity and expose the monster that they really were. I could not stand to spend extended periods of time with anyone I knew well, and especially not alone. I avoided one-on-one interactions with my father, mother, grandparents, cousins, and school friends like the plague. All I could think about when I was forced into socialization was that my supposed friends or family would turn into a demonic creature right in front of my eyes and kill me in some terrible way.

The friends and family that I had at that young age I pushed away, and I continued to self-ostracize all throughout my school years. I would occasionally attempt some small talk when in a group, but I would never let anyone truly get to know me. If I let down my guard, they could lull me into a false sense of security, get me alone, and then tear me apart. As I grew older I became increasingly aware that this fear was totally irrational and contrary to reality, yet I could not shake it. I led a lonely and solitary existence of constant paranoia, and often contemplated simply ending it. What was the point of living if I could let no one near me without fear that they were a horror that would destroy me?

I graduated high school and left home as soon as I could, and though they did not say it I could sense that my parents were glad to see me go. How could I blame them? I was a miserable mess, a wretch that sucked the life out of their house. I was sad to be apart from them, but relieved that I could have solace from my fears in true isolation. I rented a cheap apartment and worked menial jobs to get by. If my coworkers started to get too comfortable with me, I moved on. Dating was utterly out of the question. I was unhappy, of course, but that was how I survived.

It was two months ago when the nightmares became unbearable. Ever since I had seen that scene as a child I had suffered from them, though they were always sporadic until very recently. In the dreams I’m alone with someone I was close with, and we’re talking casually and pleasantly. Then, out of nowhere, the mood changes. The person I’m speaking with suddenly becomes hostile in their speech and I become intolerably uncomfortable. When I try to end the conversation or leave, the unthinkable happens. The person I was speaking to peels off their face like a mask, revealing a monstrous face beneath with bulging yellow eyes, sickly bluish skin, and menacing sharpened teeth. I scream in terror as the thing then peels the human skin from its hands like gloves and I see the bloody inhuman claws where hands once were. The thing leaps at me, takes hold of my neck, and thrusts its fangs toward my throat. Right before the bite occurs, I awake hyperventilating and in a cold sweat. These dreams used to only come once every two weeks or so, but two months ago they began to come every night, and sometimes multiple times a night.

I couldn’t take it anymore. The isolation and the fear I could endure, but the constant nightmares threatened to finally tear the last vestiges of sanity from my mind. I recalled the advice that my mother had given me on how to deal with my eccentricities, and concluded that it would be the only thing that could help my fragile mental state: I would seek the help of a therapist.

Dr. Ward appeared to be perfectly normal the first time that I met with him. I was horribly nervous to be alone with someone, naturally, but his casual appearance and gentle voice actually soothed me. I could hardly stand to be with him in the small office we held our sessions in, but my fear of my therapist transforming spontaneously into a monster was trumped by my desire to rid myself of my horrible dreams. I told him nothing of the nightmares at first, and very gradually doled out information about my peculiar fear. To my surprise, he was not condescending in the slightest, and he tried his best to understand me and my condition. I found that talking through my issues with the kind doctor actually did help to alleviate my mental strain, and I began to come to grips with the fact that all of my isolation and social aversion were truly for naught. After a few months of fruitful sessions, the dreams also began to slowly but surely subside.

Before my last session I had not had a nightmare in three weeks, and I was ecstatic! I wanted to share with Dr. Ward how his guidance and exercises had relieved me of my nighttime terrors, but I would have to confide in him about my nightmares to do so. I resolved to do it, to finally tell him the whole truth, and in doing so totally unshackle myself from the irrational fears that had crippled me for so long.

I arrived in his office that final time as I had so many times before, took a seat on his couch across from his chair, and prepared myself mentally for what I had to do. We exchanged the usual greetings and pleasantries, then got down to business.

“I want to thank you,” I said with a quiver of apprehension, “for all that you’ve done for me during our sessions. I have not had a nightmare for three weeks now.”

Dr. Ward looked at me through his large circular glasses, a puzzled expression on his face. He stroked his thin pointed beard for a moment, then responded: “Nightmares? We’ve never discussed nightmares before.”

“I was afraid to, doctor. You know how I have trouble letting people in and sharing personal details because of my fear. I’ve done my best to share as much as I can with you, but I left out the nightmares. Now that we’ve made so much progress, I feel comfortable speaking about them.”

Dr. Ward smiled. He crossed his legs and put his hands on his knee.

“Tell me about them! How long have you had them for?”

I told him about how I had been experiencing them since I was a child, but the sudden increase in their frequency led me to seeking out the help of a therapist.

“I see. Well, it’s good that you found me then! And what is it that happens in these dreams that makes them so unbearable?”

I told him about the horrible dreams, the people who would reveal the terrible truth of their monstrous form after peeling off their face and hands before coming for my throat. When I was finished, he looked very displeased. He uncrossed his legs and folded his arms. I felt a drop in my stomach, and wondered if I had revealed too much after all.

“Let’s really get down to the bottom of this. Obviously my treatment has not been as effective as I thought,” Dr. Ward said with what I sensed was a hint of passive-aggressiveness.

“What do you mean? I feel a lot better than I had before,” I insisted, “and the nightmares have totally subsided.”

“Why is it that you’re so scared of people you know being monsters? Why is it, really?” he said with a degree of sternness that I had not heard from him before.

I shrank back into the couch. I felt very threatened and uneasy, and my mind was racing to find an excuse to get out of the room.

“What do you mean, doctor? I’ve explained it all to you.”

“No, you haven’t. We’ve discussed your fear of monsters but we’ve never gotten to the root of the issue.”

“We haven’t?”

“No.”

We sat and just stared at each other for a long minute. The look on his face was now one of hatefulness and malice, but why? What had I done to offend him?

“What makes you so much better than everyone else?” he inquired, shattering the tense silence.

“I’m sorry?”

“What makes you so much better than everyone else, that everyone else is a monster and you’re not?”

“I don’t understand what you’re saying, doctor, please—”

“You’re right, you don’t understand. You don’t understand that you’re the same as us. You’re afraid of yourself.”

“Afraid of myself?”

“Yes, afraid of yourself. Here, let me show you.”

I shudder to think of what came next, and would rather abandon this manuscript entirely than record it, but I will force myself to go on. My nightmares came true before my waking eyes. Dr. Ward reached his hands to his face, tore off the flesh as if it was a mask, and revealed what I had seen so many times before in horrors at night: that terrible blue face, yellow eyes, and sharpened teeth. The creature that I had believed to be Dr. Ward grinned at me with unfathomable menace, and I felt myself began to faint at the sight of it.

“No! Look! Look, you fool!” the monster screamed at me, snapping me back into the waking world and depriving me of the oblivion of unconsciousness.

He lept out of his chair and stood towering above me on the couch. I wanted to run, I wanted to scream, but I was utterly paralyzed with fear. He took the flesh off of his hands like gloves, revealing the claws that I knew would be there. All of my fears were confirmed, and I could do nothing to escape.

“Do you see? Do you see now that you were right?” the monstrous doctor hissed at me.

I wanted to respond, but I could force no sound out of my throat. He reached into his pocket with his claws and pulled out a small hand mirror, then crouched down and thrusted it in front of my face. I saw myself petrified with terror and marveled at how I had managed to maintain consciousness through this ordeal.

“You still do not understand. You won’t understand unless you see it for yourself. Take it off.”

Take what off? I wanted to ask, I wanted to push the mirror away from my horrified face, but I could still not make even the slightest movement.

“You’re useless. Pathetic! I’ll do it myself.”

The creature reached forth with his other claw and grabbed my face. I watched in the mirror as he tore my flesh away to reveal— no! It couldn’t be true. I could not have really seen what I saw in the reflection, it was impossible, it was inconceivable! Yet I did see it, it was true, despite its impossibility: beneath my face was the face of a monster. Blue skin, bulging yellow eyes, sharpened teeth, the same as the doctor.

“Do you see now? Do you understand? Look!” he screamed with malicious joy.

I finally lost consciousness then, and received the oblivion I so desperately desired. Just as quickly as my boon arrived, however, I was snatched back to consciousness by Dr. Ward’s voice.

“Wake up, son!”

I jolted awake, soaked in perspiration and gasping for air. I found myself able to move once again, and I jumped up from the couch with a start. I saw Dr. Ward sitting in his chair just as he had when I first entered the room, with his regular human face and hands.

“What happened?” I demanded of him.

“You fell asleep! We were discussing nightmares and you passed out. Have you been sleeping?” he replied calmly.

I still felt extremely disoriented, and could not shake my overwhelming desire to leave that room at once.

“I think I need to go, doctor.” I said firmly.

“Very well. I’ll see you next week then?”

“I don’t think so.”

“No? Do you think that we’re done here?”

A chill ran down my spine. I wasn’t sure, but I thought that I sensed some malice in his voice.

“I do, doctor. I’m alright now. I won’t be coming back.”

“Very good. I wish you well then.”

Dr. Ward extended a hand toward me. Cautiously, I extended mine as well and we shook hands. It would have been a perfectly amicable departure, if I had not felt the skin of his hand slipping off like a glove. My eyes darted downward, and just for a moment I saw a hint of the claw at his wrist before the skin slid back into place. I looked back up at Dr. Ward, and the twisted smile that crept across his knowing face sent me running from the room at once.

What I had seen was no dream. The fears that had destroyed my life were confirmed to be completely correct, but how could that be in a sane and rational world? It simply could not be that everyone was a monster beneath their skin, including myself, the idea is utter madness! Am I insane, or has reality itself lost its mind? What is the difference?

How can I go on, knowing what I know? Either everyone is an evil creature under the surface, or I am completely crazy and have been for a long time. If I am insane, how is it that I recognize the insanity of it all? I say again, either way, what is the difference? I simply cannot go on. Insane or not, I am trapped within a nightmare from which there is no escape. That is to say, no escape besides the obvious way in which a man can escape the horror of his reality.  I know that none of you will believe that what I experienced was real, but I am unbothered by that fact. It is enough for me to know it, God forbid that anyone else should believe it!
