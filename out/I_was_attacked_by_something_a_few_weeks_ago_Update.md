In case you haven't seen it, you should probably [start at the beginning](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/15rcc8e/i_was_attacked_by_something_a_few_weeks_ago/).  


So my last post I told you guys I woke up in a dark room and couldn't contact anyone. That's still true. I've been in here for two days now and they haven't fed me or given me any water. The strange thing is I still feel like I'm getting energy. My stomach feels full and I don't feel dehydrated at all. Every night so far I've been able to fall asleep very easily, which isn't like me. I can never sleep in a friend's house, let alone someplace completely unknown.  


I'm not alone here either. Well, I'm alone in my room but there have been these other people who have whispered to me under the door. They've even managed to pass notes. The weird thing to me is it seems like these notes are written on construction paper, like the colorful kind your kindergarten teacher would give you for projects. I don't know why they're able to move around freely and I'm not. I also don't understand what these notes mean.   


"Don't let them know." I've gotten multiple notes like this with different handwritings. The people that talk to me have just tried to get information about me. Who am I? What happened to me? Do I remember anything? Am I starving? Will anyone miss me? That last one horrifies me to think about. I don't answer them. For some reason, I feel like I should trust the notes, even though I don't know who they're talking about yet.   


I still have random pains that shoot through my entire body like someone's doing surgery on me without any anesthesia. I would know, I woke up while I was getting an appendectomy and the doctors didn't notice. This is way worse though. It also stops after a rather short amount of time. I know that there's a camera watching me. I can hear it moving whenever I walk around the room. I try to make sure it can't see my notes.  


Today was also the first day I've seen someone else in person. I assume he was a doctor or something because he was wearing a lab coat. He came into my room and stared at me. He just smirked and turned around then walked out. I'm kind of creeped out by that. OH, I almost forgot to mention that I've been getting really angry sometimes. I'll be dead asleep then out of nowhere I'm literally growling at the empty space in front of me. I even attacked the door. I would say I just punched it, but it was like a feral attack. Like I needed to escape.

One of the comments in the last post asked if I knew if it was the full moon or not when the attack happened. I was able to look that up and the full moon was the day after. I think they're asking if it's a werewolf, but the thing that attacked me had no fur. At least none that I could see. Another comment mentioned there might be more of those things in the area and now I'm terrified for my friend's safety. I still can't contact her but I'm hoping she's safe.

I don't have any moreÂ updates for now but I can hear someone whispering under the door.. "Did you feel that?" over and over... What the fuck? It feels like someone's drilling a hole into my head. I.. I need to lie down. I'll update you guys when I'm able to.
