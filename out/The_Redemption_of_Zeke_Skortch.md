My father growing up always had a knack of coming up with the wildest stories, even if they were fake or not! One of these stories was of an old farmer named Zeke Skortch! From how my dads story goes is this man was very mean to everyone and he lived over 150yrs ago on a farm not far from my dads warehouse!

I'm an adult now and have kiddos of my own! My father still tells this story to my kids and they love it! One day, that story turned true for my son when he was staying the night with my parents! I'll never forget the fear in his eyes when he told me this story!

My parents have two warehouses. One in town that they live in and one in the southern hills. Its very secluded and quiet with a creek running through the land and my dad built a cabin for the grandkids to stay in when they are with them! The kids do have the choice of staying in the main house or going down to the cabin, which they always elect to stay in the main building. The hills are extremely haunted, as they are gold hunting ground!

My kids get home the morning after and I notice my son is being a little standofish. I asked him

"Whats wrong with you kiddo?"

"I just had a weird experience down at Bountiful." He tells me

Bountiful is what my father calls his place in the southern hills.

"Well, when you want to talk about it, you know where to find me!" I told him, knowing he'll come to me once he gets his mind straight! You just never know what will come out of the mind of a 10yr old.

Just a few hours later, he comes to me and tells me this story that not only blew my mind, but really got me wondering if this is a real supernatural occurance. I'll try to go into best detail I can but its going to be tough.



My dad told him the story that night before they went to bed and my son fell asleep, and my daughter stayed up for a little while longer with a book before turning in! They sleep in separate rooms but they are next door to eachother! My daughter is about to turn her light off when she hears walking up the carpet stars and she thinks its her granfather! The next thing she sees is this HUGE man with a cowboy hat, an axe and glowing red eyes! My son is dead asleep and he's awoken by her screaming, runs into her room and comforts her, asking her what happened!

"Whats wrong?" He asks

"I saw him, he was in the doorway! I felt like he was coming to get me!" she tells him

He agrees to sleep next to her to comfort her and thats when it got bad! They were both awaken by a loud bang. They both sit up and see this HUGE man in front of them and he's got this menacing grin, knowing what he wants! He disappears into thin air, and then my kids fall back asleep, with the most horrific nightmare!

In this nightmare, they see unspeakable things! People dying, blood being shed, visera everywhere! That leads me to this story and the truth is, even if Ive wrote this, I still cant get it out of my mind! Im beginning to think this whole story from my dad is real and I need to warn him as well!

The year is 1890, in the middle of nowhere in midwestern US, on a farm that has chickens, goats, cattle, you name it! The owners of this farm is Zeke and Ida Skortch, who take very good care of this place! They have over 10,000 acres of prime farm land, from which you can name it, they probably grow it! One day, Ida goes missing after running to check on the eggs in the chicken coop! Zeke rides to the sheriff and asks for his help.

"Ida's gone missing sheriff! I need your help" He says in a deep, southern gravely voice

"Tell me what's the problem Zeke? Have you checked the whole farm for her?" the sheriff answers

"Yes, I've rode the whole property! Checked the barn, checked the stalls, and the chicken coop! I really need you to come with me and help me search!" Zeke retorts

"Alright, let me grab my coat and ill meet you out there!" Says the sheriff looking at Zeke with a questionable look!


Zeke is sitting on his porch when the sheriff shows up with a posse to help search for Zeke's missing wife, but what they dont know is this is the last day they'll ever see alive!

"Zeke, Ive brought a clan with me to look. We will start now, we will let you know if we've found anything!" The sheriff yells

"Alright sheriff! Have your fun!" Zeke says with a murderous look on his face

The sheriff and the clan go their separate ways, searching the whole property, not knowing the hell they were about to walk into!

The first victim is Daniel Harms, a local clerk known for his bright mind and charming demeanor! As he's searching, he walks into the barn and with a look, starts looking at every inch of the structure for any clue! Just then, he hears a noise behind him! He turns around, just as a large hook impales him in the head, killing him instantly! 

"Hahahaha such a pathetic sucker for the sheriff! Now to hoist you up and let you dry out for skinning later!" Zeke laughs as he raises Daniels body up to the rafters

The second victim is Grant Pullman, a well known banker! Known for his immense strength and tall stature, you knew to stay away from him if you crossed him! As he's searching around the yard, he notices a large object that doesnt quite fit the whole farm! As he walks over, he notices it a large circular saw used in timber production!

Just then, Grant hears running coming from behind him! He spins around thinking its one of the searchers! As he spins, he's hit broadside by a wooden object that knocks him out cold!

He wakes up and notices hes on the platform thats used for the saw! He notices hes tied down and then looks up and sees Zeke with this hand on the lever!

"You'll never get away with this Zeke! The townsfolk will have you lynched when they hear of this!" Grant shouts

"No one will know, because I've already killed the mayor! The sheriff is next, after I split you like a log!" Zeke laughs

Zeke throws the lever! The saw starts up and Grant starts to inch toward the saw! Within a minute, Grant is split from groin to head, blood and visera spilling over everything!


The last person to suffer Zekes wrath is Clancey Davis, the sheriff! 

Clancey is searching the coop when he spots Ida, hanging from a small hook in the back of the building! He runs over and checks to see if shes alive but stops dead in his tracks, as he notices the hook potruding out of the front of her skull like a large bull horn!

"HOLY SHIT! Ive got to warn the others of this!" He says in a panic

Unbeknownst to him, he's next on the hit list! As he runs out of the coop, he's met with the intimidating figure of Zeke Skortch holding a pitch fork!

"So you found my wife did ya? Do you like how I mounted her like a prize bull?" He says with a laugh!

"You madman! You better come with me and we can settle this in town!" says the sheriff

"No can do sheriff! What happens at the farm, stays at the farm!" Zeke Growls

Just then, the pitch fork is driven into Clanceys abdomen! Clancey grabs his gun and fires a shot, hitting Zeke in the chest, but the damage is done! Clancey starts fading, just as an axe is driven into his head!

"Sorry sheriff, the good ones die a horrible death!" Zeke says as he pulls the pitch fork out of Clancey's abdomen!




So thats the nightmare my son gave me! I warned my dad a few weeks ago, and to my shock, he knows this story! I asked him how, and he answered me with a few short words!

"Zeke was my great-great-grandfather!" He smiled

So now I know this story is real, not a made up one! 

My father has three pitch forks in his tool shed, and I'm not going to ask him which one was used in the murders!!!
