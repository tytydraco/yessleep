It was a stunning West Australian afternoon as I cruised through the hills, about an hour’s drive south from Perth. An hour before sunset, the gold and green leaves of the eucalyptus trees glittered against the pale blue sky as my small hatchback tore up the windy road. I pushed my little shitbox as fast as it could go, only slowing down when the dash lights flickered after a particularly nasty pothole. I turned down the music as I approached my destination; I had to maintain professional appearances.

I pulled up to the heavy automated gate. The keypad was choked with spiderwebs, but the cameras recognized my plate and the gate groaned open. The property was lined with wire fencing and trees, but inside, the land was open and mostly flat. The house stood in the centre, raised on a white limestone base in stark contrast to the red and grey rocky earth and surrounded by a metal fence as tall as a man. It looked like a surreal fortress against a sky that was quickly taking on a burnt orange tone. I pulled up, opened the outer gate with a key, and punched the code into the front door. It was a distinct six-note melody, five numbers and a hash, followed by the heavy click of the electronic lock. I didn't bother with the old metal deadbolt on the inside of the door for now.

I opened the door and heard heavy footfalls rushing toward me from the back of the house, accompanied by humming. I stopped and waited as the frantic footsteps approached with sickening speed. I braced for impact. As my pursuer reached his destination, I smiled. Elijah hurtled into me, enveloping most of my body in a hug, still humming, though the sound was broken by short laughs. I hugged him back; Elijah replicated the melody of the keypad including the whir of the electronic lock with his mouth as I waddled us into the kitchen with him standing on top of my feet.

“How has Mr. Elijah been today?” I asked my coworker Julie, who was finishing up the dishes.

“He has been very good. We tried some new foods today, but he wasn’t having it. Otherwise, he's been mostly calm, asking for you a lot, of course,” she smiled.

I looked down at Elijah. He was ten years old, around five feet tall, with brown eyes and hair. He was a cute kid with a sweet smile, diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder Level 3—put simply, as autistic as it gets. He was mostly non-verbal, but spoke in strings of singular words; right now he looked up at me and said, “Pink, Smiths, Please.”

I knew he wanted a Smiths branded bag of Salt and Vinegar chips.

“No, you’ve already had dinner, mate,” I said, looking at Julie for confirmation.

“Yes, he’s had two pieces of toast with hummus and one mouthful of soup—which he started gagging on,” she laughed.

Elijah shuffled away to the table. I was his only male support worker, and we’d made a good connection, which is why I often took his overnight shifts. Being twenty-one, I could outpace most of the older staff. We had a lot of fun doing activities other carers didn’t usually bother with. I was more like a fun big brother than a parent, which suited me perfectly.

“Hey Matt, is it alright if I head off early? I’ve cleaned, Elijah has showered and eaten, and I’m meeting my parents,” Julie said.

“I won’t tell anyone,” I replied. Julie gathered her things and left. When prompted to say goodbye, Elijah said, “Say goodbye,” without looking up from his crayons. Once her car pulled out and the gate shut, Elijah stopped pretending to draw. He cocked his head, waiting.

“Ford, please,” he stated.

“Oh, fine let’s do it. Go get your shoes on,” I said as I tickled him behind the ear before he bounded off to get ready, bouncing off the walls in excitement.

We did our usual lap around the property perimeter in my car while "The Wheels on the Bus" played on repeat. The headlights flickered again as we hit a bump, a reminder that the car was on borrowed time. It was dark now, and after the house lights, the darkness outside was impenetrable. The hills weren't dangerous if you didn’t stick your hand under rocks, but the silence that night was strange. Usually, the headlights caught the glowing eyes of kangaroos, but the bush was still. No crunching leaves, no movement.

We finished our lap, Elijah only ever wanted one, as it was the length of the song and headed back inside. As I followed him in, I finally heard a distant crunching far behind me. I turned expecting to see a family of kangaroos grazing by the fence line, but I saw no silhouettes in the moonlight. I frowned and locked the door with the keypad and that heavy deadbolt.

Elijah fell asleep quickly. I cleaned up and headed to bed in the room next to his, setting my alarm for 5:00 AM.

I woke to darkness. It wasn't 5:00 AM yet. I strained my ears, hearing the wind belting the trees, but then I heard something else. Slow. In. Out. Breathing.

I didn't move. I looked around the room, dimly lit by the moon through the window behind my head. Then, I heard it… a slow, almost indulgent breath in, as if someone were smelling flowers, followed by a delayed, excited breath out.

The door was slowly opening. I’m not one for indecision; I stood up and threw it open. Elijah’s unbothered face looked up at me.

“Elijah, toilet, light on!” he sang.

I breathed a sigh of relief. He was sometimes too scared to leave his room at night. I waited while he used the bathroom, then tucked him back in. He fell right back to sleep. I returned to my room and turned on the light to find my water bottle. As I drank, I saw a smudge on the window, right behind where my head had been resting. It was two fading plumes of condensation from someone breathing heavily against the glass. Someone had been watching me, breathing just inches away from my head; for a long moment I was frozen. Even now it was barely visible, slowly fading away, but it was real.

My stomach dropped. I did a walkthrough in the dark, checking every door and the deadbolt, choosing to keep the lights off as I moved through the house. Given the open nature of the property at night, if you had the lights on it would be very easy to be watched by someone hidden in the darkness. The thought made goosebumps cover my body. Everything was locked. I checked the cameras, which, although they were crappy, did have a low-resolution night vision. They covered the perimeter of the property but seeing something that close to the walls wasn’t possible and I saw nothing else amiss.

I chose to sleep on a spare mattress in Elijah’s room and lay there awake until dawn.

I got Elijah ready for school that morning, choosing not to worry him, although the severity of the situation would probably have been lost on him. After I saw Elijah off on the school bus with his school carers, socks pulled high, hair combed, my mind returned to the night. I rounded the back of the house to my bedroom window. There were two clear depressions in the soft dirt that lined the house, hidden between the decorative flowers exactly where someone would have to stand to breathe on that glass. And more disturbingly, even though his blinds had been drawn all night, there were two more depressions in the dirt outside Elijah’s window.

And sitting right there on the ledge, as if it were a gift, was a small, unopened bag of Pink Smiths chips.

I checked the cameras again. They didn't cover the spots under the windows, but someone would have had to know the precise blind spots to get there. They would have had to climb two fences without a sound. It was highly unlikely, yet nothing showed up on the feeds.

I’m posting this here because I want to document it and this seems like the right place. The lack of any real evidence is what’s stopping me from telling my managers or law enforcement. It’s essentially impossible to avoid the perimeter cameras, I didn't think I could do it even after watching the feeds night after night. If anyone has advice it would be welcome; feel free to leave it below. Hopefully I don’t have an update.
