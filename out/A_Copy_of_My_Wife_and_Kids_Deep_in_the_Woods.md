It all started last-last weekend. I had parked just shy of the forestry gate, where the gravel thinned out, and the trees began thickening. From here, it was a few hours on foot - just enough time and distance to let the peacefulness settle in. That was all I really wanted - a little quiet. No reception, no chatter; just the trail ahead, and whatever passed for clarity in this day and age.

I left my phone in the glovebox. Not to make a statement as such - I just didn’t want to feel it buzzing in my pocket, needing, reminding.

The air smelled clean. Pine, crisp northern winds, and something familiar and damp, like the memory of water that had long since sunk into the ground. I slung my pack over one shoulder, and started walking, letting the rhythm pull me listlessly forward. There was just something calming about walking alone - neither too fast, nor too slow - exactly my own pace - that made me feel like I had a little more control over my life again.

The trees weren’t especially tall, leaning just slightly inward, as if they had something to confide in me - an innocent little secret between myself and the forest. The path wound forward, without promise or urgency. Late afternoon light filtered through the canopy like little threads of gold; slow dissolves, like a weary, introverted sun who had enough of being directly seen.

Time stretched ever forward, like a lazy cat, greeting its owner after a long, grueling day at work. After a while, I stopped walking in minutes, and began walking in distances-between-thoughts. 

I wasn’t exactly looking for anything. I wasn’t really running from anything either.

I told them I’d be back the next morning. Maybe a touch later. Just needed a breather, I said. They nodded - not dismissively, perhaps just- tired in their own ways. Maybe they were happy to have the house to themselves for a change.

It wasn’t always like this. We used to move like parts of the same body - not exactly perfect, but - close enough to feel whole. There was a sort of rhythm in the way we bickered, laughed, touched elbows at the dinner table.

And then came the camping trip, last month. What was meant to be a long weekend away in the mountains - a break from all the screens and internet. It happened suddenly. I went ahead to look for firewood, and they took a wrong turn trying to follow.

I found them again, a full week later.

They’d turned up some fifty miles north, by a reservoir I’d driven past some hundreds of times during my search. No injuries, no scratches, barely a clear story. Just tears and hugs and confused explanations. Something about getting turned around, following odd trails. 

It didn’t matter anymore, though. I had found them again.

But something had changed, subtly, after that. They were a touch quieter, somehow. Or maybe it was me. Maybe I’d stared at that empty tent for too long, whispering their names into the dark. Maybe I’d come too close to accepting the idea that they were gone forever.

We never really broached the subject. After the initial joy wore off, we just drifted back into routine. Work. School. House-chores. But somehow, things never quite clicked back into place. The pieces all looked the same - they still laughed at the same shows, still left dishes half-done in the sink, but - it still didn’t quite feel the same.

My son and daughter, Alex and Ellie, stopped asking me to read before bed. My wife, Lauren, started waking up before me, and taking long walks alone. Sometimes, I’d find them all together, sitting in the living room, discussing something that went quiet as soon as I entered. Not secretive - just… separate.

I never resented them for it. Nor did I feel especially left out. Mostly, it just felt like the threads that had tied us together had loosened, just a little. They were still mine, as far as I was concerned. Still loved me. But sometimes, when they laughed too hard at nothing I could hear - when they exchanged glances I couldn’t decipher, I’d catch myself thinking: these are the versions that came back.

And wondering if that was enough for me.

I must have walked for hours.

Not with purpose. Not really. Just following one trail after another, watching the way the sun filtered through the leaves, letting it all pull me deeper into the woods. A part of me was hoping I’d get tired. That I’d sit down somewhere and clear my head.

But I didn’t. I kept walking.

Past old logging stumps, crooked stone outcroppings, and mossy bridges, I kept thinking about home - how the house might feel right now. Quiet. Stretched thin. I imagined Lauren sitting at the kitchen table, flicking through her phone. Ellie and Alex squabbling in the other room, half-bored, half-wired from screen time. The little life we’d built together still buzzing along without me.

The sun kept sinking. The woods turned golden, then bronze, then something colder - all gray tree trunks and long blue shadows. I found myself on a ridge I didn’t recognize. The trail had thinned to little more than deer path.

I stood still for a while, watching the sun brush its last warmth across the trees.

The light had gone syrupy - thick and golden, oozing between the trunks like it was reluctant to leave. Shadows stretched long and crooked, flickering softly as the wind stirred the upper branches. A pair of birds darted overhead, trailing a thread of sound behind them that frayed and vanished into the stillness.

Everything felt paused, like the forest was holding its breath, waiting to see what I’d do.

I sighed. Adjusted the strap of my pack. And turned around.

Time to man up. Go back. Face the noise, the mess, the tight little world that waited for me.

I took the same path, weaving through underbrush in the reverse of my own trail. Branches snagged less this time. The air felt cooler. Quieter, too. Not dead, but subdued. The way it sometimes got before the evening birds started their songs.

Up ahead, I could just make out the turnoff that led toward the trailhead, toward the gravel lot where my truck waited. I pictured the climb down, the way the headlights would cut through the blue dusk. Maybe I’d stop somewhere on the drive back. Get Lauren’s favorite milk. Try to do something right. I stepped forward-

A voice. Low. Close.

“Daniel?”

I froze.

“Daniel — is that you?”

*Lauren?*

I turned.

The trees swayed gently.

“Please. I’m scared. I don’t know where I am.”

I stood at the edge of the trail, breath sharp in my throat.

“Daniel, please.”

Her voice again. Almost whimpering.

“I think I’m hurt.”

My mouth went dry. A strange urge to run. But it was her voice. Not just the sound — the cadence. That soft, uncertain rise she used to have when trying not to cry.

The one I hadn’t heard in years.

“Dad?”

Another voice. Higher. Cracking at the edges.

“Dad, where are you?”

Alex.

Then — barely a beat later:

“Daddy? I’m scared. Where are you?”

Ellie.

Her voice shook — the exact pitch she’d used when the power went out, when she was six and couldn’t find her nightlight.

My hands trembled.

Because I’d heard these voices before. But not like this. Not since before the camping trip.

Before they came home colder. Distant.

Smiling too tightly. Hugging too briefly.

Back when they still looked at me like I was theirs.

“Daniel?”

Lauren again. Just over the ridge.

“I’m here.”

The words escaped before I could stop them.

Then - the dry crunch of leaves underfoot. A rhythm. Getting closer.

I turned.

Three figures emerged from the brush - clothes torn, faces streaked with soot and dirt.

Lauren stumbled toward me. Then the kids. Ellie clinging to Alex’s arm, eyes wide with a desperate, aching kind of hope.

“Daniel,” Lauren whispered, voice cracking. “Oh my god - Daniel!”

She threw her arms around me. I caught her on reflex. Felt her weight, the tension in her limbs. She smelled like pine and smoke and sweat.

She smelled real.

The kids were next. Alex burying his face in my coat, Ellie’s arms locking tight around my ribs.

“We- we didn’t know where you went,” Lauren said. “Everything was strange. The trees… they kept changing. We thought…”

She pulled back. Studied my face.

“Are you okay?”

I wanted to say yes.

They felt solid. Familiar.

They clung to me like people who’d survived something unspeakable.

And for one trembling second, I almost believed.

But then, like a crack through glass:

*Weren’t they supposed to be home?*

I didn’t say it aloud, but I must have felt something was wrong. That subtle stiffness in my shoulders. The way my eyes kept flicking around without thought. The way I stayed one step behind them as we walked.

I told myself the only explanation that made sense - that they’d come out looking for me in the dead of night and gotten lost. The woods could twist and turn you without warning. Maybe they’d just wandered too far. Long enough to lose their bearings. Long enough to feel scared.

But something deeper disagreed. A quiet wrongness that wouldn’t settle.

Like stepping into a familiar room where everything’s been moved half an inch.

Your body notices, even if your mind can’t say why.

I couldn’t bring myself to ask. I was scared of their answer - scared of what it might mean. So I said nothing. Just led them toward the road.

We didn’t talk much on the way. They were exhausted. Ellie tripped twice, and I carried her for a while. Lauren kept glancing at me like she was afraid I’d vanish again if she looked away. I smiled each time, told her we’d figure everything out soon.

…

We reached the truck just before dusk. Lauren laughed, soft and dazed, when she saw it.

“You still drive this old thing?”

I nodded - not responding in words, unlocking the door.

Ellie fell asleep leaning against the window as soon as we pulled onto the road. Lauren held her hand. I kept both eyes on the stretching lines of the highway, stealing glances at my family every so often - just to make sure I wasn’t dreaming it all.

…

But of course, reality had to eventually come crashing down.

We pulled into the driveway just as the porch light came on. I killed the engine. The truck was filled with silence - the kind that comes right at the precipice of the irreversible.

For a second, I just sat there. One hand rested on the wheel. My reflection in the windshield betraying my apprehension back to me. Lauren stirred beside me. Ellie and Alex yawned in the back seat, stretching and blinking themselves awake.

Then the front door creaked open.

And Lauren - the other Lauren - stepped out onto the porch. My Lauren. At least, the Lauren that I’d kissed goodbye that morning. Her hair was still tied up from cooking, and she was wiping her hands off with a dish towel.

She smiled when she saw the truck. Familiar. Unbothered.

“You’re back early - do you want sup-”

Then she saw them. 

Her voice cut mid-syllable.

The dish towel fluttered down onto the gravel at her feet.

I could barely breathe - my hand on the cab door - stuck half open.

The other Lauren - the one in the car with me - had gone ghostly pale. Her eyes locked on the woman standing on the porch. Her mouth moved - once, twice - without any sound.

Ellie gripped my sleeve, whispering.

“Daddy?”

I didn’t answer. All I could see was Lauren looking at Lauren. My eyes filled with something beyond fear. The one question I'd dreaded the possibility of having to ask.

*If she’s here, at home… then who did I bring back?*

Porch-Lauren took a step back. Her eyes were locked on the woman beside me - the same face, the same eyes, the same trembling lips.

“Daniel…” she said, barely an audible whisper. “What is this?”

I glanced at her, and back at the Lauren next to me. Her hand rested, faintly, against the passenger-side door. She looked like she was on the edge of collapsing inward.

The words turned to ash in my mouth.

Porch-Lauren stood there, not crying, but tears streaming down her face nonetheless.

Porch-Alex’s hand had flown up to cover his mouth, and porch-Ellie held her head in her hands, whispering *no no no* to herself, backing toward the house like she could undo it all by stepping out of frame.

The ones beside me?

Frozen.

Staring.

Mouths agape.

As if struggling to comprehend the crushing weight of truth that had fallen onto them.

For a moment, I felt nothing. No fear, no anger - just a kind of supernatural stillness. The shapes beside me… they fit in all the ways they were supposed to. Like the way they did before the camping trip. Like in the way Lauren leaned slightly toward the sound of my breath. Like the way Alex always stood behind Ellie, comforting her in distressing situations. And yet, something about the symmetry - the doubling - made it all feel like a lie told too well. I didn’t know - I couldn’t know - which direction the truth was facing.

I looked back up at porch-Lauren, who had begun to take on the essence of something colder and sharper in her expression. Her gaze shifted between me and her counterpart, then to the kids standing behind her - and then to the kids in the car.

She didn’t scream. She didn’t run. She just stood there, hands shaking, resolutely against the impossibility, and said:

“They’re not coming inside.”

The other Lauren flinched. I felt it - the sharp, anxious breath she took through her teeth. Ellie gripped my sleeve tighter.

“Lauren…” I started, voice straining as the words felt like ash in my mouth. “I don’t know what’s happening. I don’t think - I don’t know if they’re copies. Or.. or if something else happened. If they got lost-”

She shook her head.

Hard. Once.

That was all.

No words. No outburst. Just that one, solid refusal - and I understood what she meant. Some truths can’t be stretched. Some lines you just don’t cross, even if the world’s split clean down the middle.

The silence held - taught as a wire - until I spoke again.

“The guesthouse. They can stay there. Just for now. Until we figure this out.”

Porch-Lauren’s jaw tightened. She didn’t look at me. Her eyes stayed locked on her - the mirror version, now standing ten feet away in the flickering porch light.

“No,” she said, quietly.

“Lauren,” I said, softer still, pleading. “They can’t go back out there, in the forest. The kids - look at them. They’re just scared. Confused. Maybe we all are.”

She still didn’t look at me. But I saw her blink, considering my words. Then she stepped back into the doorway, her voice as brittle as glass.

“Fine. But they’re not coming in this house.”

She turned away and disappeared into the hallway, the screen door slapping shut behind her.

I stood in the gravel, heart thudding.

Behind me, Lauren - the other Lauren - let out a shaky breath. Ellie was still pressed against me. Alex said nothing at all.

“Come on,” I said, “It’s this way.”

We moved past the main house in silence, feet crunching over the gravel. I felt the presence of my other family still lingering behind the windows - watching. Or hiding. Maybe both.

The guesthouse sat at the back of the property, on the other side of our garden, half-covered in vines, paint peeling in the corners. It hadn’t been used in months.

I unlocked the door with the key hidden under the planter, and stepped inside, turning on the single ceiling bulb. The air was stale, and dust floated like soft static in the light rays.

“It’s not much,” I said, voice thin. “But at least you’ll have a roof over your head, while we figure things out.”

Lauren nodded, numb.

Alex sat down, heavily, on the couch and put his head in his hands. Ellie curled up next to him.

I stood there, hand still on the doorknob, not knowing which direction to turn.

*If they’re not real… then why does it feel like I’m abandoning them again?*

…

After much hesitation, I slept in the main house that night.

Lauren didn’t say anything when I came in. She was already in bed, facing the window, sheets pulled up over her shoulders. The room smelled of lavender and eucalyptus - the same diffuser as we’ve always used.

I didn’t bother showering. I just peeled off my clothes, and climbed in beside her. The mattress shifted under my weight. She didn’t move. Not an inch.

Her back was warm against my shoulder, her breathing steady.

I lay there in the dark, staring at the ceiling. I listened to her breaths.

*Inhale.*

*Pause.*

*Exhale.*

*Pause.*

*Repeat.*

They were perfect. Almost… too perfect. Rhythmic in a way that felt practiced - subtly stiff. Like she knew I was listening.

I tried to convince myself that was ridiculous, but I couldn’t stop.

I kept thinking about the other Lauren - curled up on the guesthouse couch, with a blanket wrapped around her knees, exhausted- but in a real way that I couldn’t quite put my finger on. The tremble in her voice. The weight of her hand on my shoulders.

And here, beside me, was a woman who knew all our inside jokes, our favorite recipes, the shape of my back, the ache in my knee from that old ladder fall.

But suddenly, I couldn’t remember the last time she had looked at me in the way guesthouse-Lauren had.

Not really, anyway.

Her breath hitched - just once. Maybe she felt me watching. Maybe she was just shifting in her sleep.

I closed my eyes and tried to match her rhythm. But it wasn’t until I started counting backward, that I realized I’d been holding my breath this whole time.

…

That night, I dreamt of the guesthouse.

It was warm.

Light spilled forth from every lamp, like poured amber. The air buzzed faintly with music - some old folk song, hazy and half-remembered, spilling from a radio that no longer worked. The walls were a different color, a sunny eggshell I didn’t recognize. The kind of color that made you feel safe.

Lauren brought out a platter of waffles and bacon, smiling wide. Ellie set the table, her cheeks pink with laughter. Alex leaned back in his chair mid-sentence, recounting some old story from school, with way too many detours. Everything shimmered with just the right kind of joy.

I ate without thinking.

I laughed when they laughed.

The windows were fogged from the heat, but the glass door - the one facing the main house - stayed clear. And at some point, without realizing when, I began to feel them.

Eyes on me.

Three figures.

Standing inside the house.

Watching.

I didn’t move. Didn’t speak.

But something made me glance up from my plate.

The lights in the main house were off.

In the hazy glow of indirect sunlight, by the window stood Lauren. Ellie. Alex.

Still. Expressionless. Perfectly visible through the window, as if they’d been there the whole time.

They didn’t wave. Didn’t knock. Just stared, faces flat and unreadable, like portraits hung behind glass.

Ellie’s hand was against the pane. Not pressed - just resting. Her breath left no fog.

Inside the guesthouse, laughter swelled again - Alex laughing too hard at a joke no-one told. Lauren refilling my glass, despite it being full to the brim. Ellie brushing crumbs onto my shirt with practiced, doting hands.

But I kept looking at the house.

At the three shapes inside it.

The guesthouse grew hotter, brighter. The air began to buzz louder, and that looping, familiar tune warped out of recognition.

I woke up with a start. No gasping. No sweat. Just the peculiar feeling - like something had been added to me while I slept.

Lauren was still beside me. Breathing steady. The same pattern as before.

But then I began to notice a hum, soft, almost below the threshold of sound. 

*Had it been there the whole time?*

…

I told myself I needed air. That was all. Just space. Just a few minutes away from the stiff, awkward silence of my bedroom.

I wandered down the steps to the guesthouse. The door was slightly open.

Inside: warmth.

It smelled like butter. Like browning toast and something just familiar enough to sting. Light spilled through the blinds in thin, golden slats, catching dust in the air like snow.

Lauren stood at the stove, barefoot. Humming something tuneless, but very much her own. Her hair was tied up in a loose bun - the way it used to be when the kids were still little. She didn’t look up.

“Didn’t think you’d be up yet,” she said.

“Didn’t sleep very well.”

She smiled, just faintly. “Felt like cooking.”

I stepped inside and saw the pan. Scrambled eggs. Bright yellow, just the way she used to make them. A half-handful of cheddar. Chives. No milk. She always said milk made them rubbery.

House-Lauren had been making them differently lately. A bit harder than I remember. A bit denser. Like she’d somehow forgotten the rhythm of it.

I sat. I ate.

They tasted right.

Everything felt just right.

I looked around. The guesthouse felt softer, somehow - as if the overnight presence of Lauren and the kids had made its spirit whole. The old mugs, which used to sit untouched on the shelf like forgotten props, now looked lived-in - well-loved. Ellie’s blanket, tucked gently under her chin as she slept curled on the couch, no longer looked like something we’d thrown in the guesthouse ‘just in case; - it looked like it had always belonged to her - smelling faintly of childhood and weekend morning cartoons.

Hesitantly, begrudgingly, I took slow steps, returning back to the main house. Alex had held my hand, asking me to stay longer, and I rustled his hair, promising I’d come back. 

The house felt colder. House-Lauren was just coming down the stairs as I slipped through the door, dressed and alert, but with that sort of washed-out look - like a painting left out in the sun for too long.

“You’re up early,” I said.

She glanced at me, then away. “Couldn’t sleep.”

“You hungry?” she asked, already halfway through the kitchen. “I could make eggs.”

I hesitated - way too long. There was a picture in my mind I couldn’t shake: the steam wafting off the plate in the guesthouse . The smell of browning butter. The way guesthouse-Lauren had sprinkled on extra chives just-so.

“I ate,” I said.

She paused. Her hand hovered just a moment too long on the fridge handle, before letting it fall.

“Right,” she said, softly. “Of course.”

She began cooking. Just with three fewer eggs than usual. One fewer slice of toast than usual.

From the hallway, I could hear Alex shifting in the living room, his chair creaking like an hold hinge. Not speaking. Just listening.

I lingered in the hall longer than I meant to.

The kettle clicked off behind her, but Lauren - House-Lauren - didn’t move right away. She was moving through the rhythm of breakfast - reaching for plates, twisting the burner on - but something about it felt unfamiliar. Just in the way a childhood song sounds when someone else hums it.

I kept my eyes on the floor, the table, the faint streaks of morning light that filtered in through the blinds. But I could feel her watching me in pieces. Never directly - glances from the corner of her eye as she moved.

I didn’t say anything.

And neither did she.

I moved to the living room, and switched on the desktop computer in the corner. I wasn’t even sure what I planned to do - any kind of work to make the hours pass.

House-Alex was curled at the far end of the couch, knees pulled up, a book open in his lap. But his eyes weren’t on the pages. They stayed fixed on the window - or maybe on the glass itself, where my reflection flickered with every shift and keystroke.

Each tap of my keyboard sounded too loud in the quiet room. Sharp. I could feel him listening to every press. I didn’t look at him, but I could feel his attention. Not accusing, just… watchful. And I thought of guesthouse-Alex. How easily he’d folded himself to my side, hand in mine. Of the way he’d smiled when I promised I’d be back.

Here, house-Alex just sat still. Like a photograph I wasn’t meant to touch.

…

Lunch was sandwiches. Soggy in the middle. Too much mayo.

We ate in silence. Alex listlessly scrolled his phone under the table. Ellie took hers apart bite by bite, crust first. Lauren barely touched hers.

I sat at the living room coffee table after, handling some bills and doing some accounting. Trying to work - or at least pretending to. My fingers stayed on the same lines of print for hours. The light shifted across the floor in slow bands, but never moved.

From where I was, I could see the guesthouse through the window. Just a sliver of it between the hedges. Nothing specific - just a corner of white siding, and the glint of sunlight off the glass.

I kept glancing at it. Unconsciously at first. Then with intention. The way you look at a shut door, when you’re waiting for someone to knock.

House-Lauren noticed. Of course she did.

By the thrd time she caught me looking, her hands slowed as she peeled carrots over the sink. She didn’t say anything.

By the fifth, she set her peeler down.

Dinner was almost ready when she finally spoke. Her back still to me.

“If you want to eat with them,” she said, voice even, “go. I don’t really care.”

I opened my mouth to protest. To explain. But there was nothing I could’ve said that didn’t sound like a complete lie. She wiped her hands on a dishtowel. Turned back to the stove.

“I’m not going to beg you to stay.”

…

I didn’t say anything when I left. House-Lauren kept cooking. House-Ellie locked herself up in her room. House-Alex stayed curled up on that couch, his eyes tracking my position as I tracked through the living room, and out into the garden.

The door to the guesthouse opened before I could knock.

Lauren was already setting the table - four plates, cloth napkins, charming old silverware. Like we used to do when the kids were little, and everything still felt worth the effort. The food was simple. Warm. steaming.

Alex and Ellie were already seated, talking softly about something. Not their day - nothing present-tense. It was a conversation pulled from some half-remembered Saturday, the kind that ends in laughter over nothing at all.

It didn’t feel like a trick.

It felt like being remembered.

I sat down. Ate. The way I hadn’t in weeks.

But at some point - between bites, between laughter - I glanced out the window. Toward the house.

They were there.

Lauren. Alex. Ellie.

Standing at the sliding door, backlit by the kitchen lights, not moving. Not speaking. Just watching. Their faces unreadable. Unmoving. 

For a long, flickering second, the air tasted like salt again.

No one at the guesthouse table noticed.

…

I told myself I’d just lie down for a minute after dinner. Just a moment, to clear my head. The couch still smelled like us — like the fabric softener she used, the cheap one we could never agree on.

I closed my eyes.

When I woke, it was light.

Too light.

I sat up, disoriented, throat dry.

The house across the lawn was still. No lights. No movement. I checked my phone.

8:42 a.m.

I walked up the path slow, stomach twisted. The front door was unlocked.

Inside, it was quiet.

Too quiet.

House-Ellie and house-Alex were still asleep, curled together on the couch like they’d drifted off watching TV.

But house-Lauren was gone.

On the desk by the hallway, something waited.

Two notes. 

The first was folded neatly into thirds. I opened it. It was in Lauren’s handwriting:

*"Alex,*

*I’ve gone to bring your father home.*

*Your real one.*

*Do not let the one here into the house.*

*Keep Ellie close.*

*Mom"*

Just like that. Not a goodbye. Not an explanation.

My chest felt tight, like something had been carved out without me noticing, and I was only now discovering the hollow. A metallic taste crept into my mouth.

And then I looked down again and saw it.

A second slip of paper, tucked beneath a cup.

It was creased. Worn. As if it had been carried around in someone’s pocket. Reread more than once.

The handwriting was mine.

My handwriting.

But I didn’t remember writing it.

And before I could stop myself, I was reading.

*"Lauren,*

*I’ve been watching the house from the treeline.*

*I see someone who looks like me inside.*

*He’s with you. With the kids. Living my life.*

*I don’t know who he is, or how this happened, but I remember everything. I remember Ellie’s birthmark behind her left knee. The way Alex used to cry when the radiator clicked on at night. I remember the night you lost your voice and still hummed to calm them both. He won’t get those right.*

*I’m scared that if I try anything, he’ll hurt you.*

*Please, if you believe me - meet me at the booth in the back of the coffee shop where we first met. I’ll be waiting.*

*Don’t let him in.*

*Don’t let him see this.*

*I love you.*

*Daniel"*

I stared at the letter, fingers cold around the edges.

My mind raced, but nothing landed. Thoughts skidded across the surface like stones on ice, never sinking deep enough to mean anything.

Suddenly -

Gravel crunched outside. A car door slammed.

The door swung open and she stood there, wind-tossed and flushed. A cold line of sweat down her temple. And behind her stood… him, hanging just a step back in the shade like a shadow pretending to wait its turn.

I stood from the little kitchen table.

“I knew it,” I said. “You were never real.”

Her mouth parted, brow creasing. “Daniel…”

“No. Don’t. Don’t use my name like you have any right to it.” My voice cracked and kept going. “I should’ve known. You’ve been different since the woods. Distant. Cold.”

The man behind her tilted his head.

“And now you’ve brought him?” I stepped forward, hands out, like I could physically keep them from entering. “What, is this a trade? Your real husband?”

Her face twisted. “You think I wanted this?”

“You brought him here!”

“Because I thought you weren’t real!” she snapped.

Silence.

Even he stilled.

Her voice dropped. “I waited. I waited for you. But something’s been wrong. I kept thinking… what if they got you instead? What if he was still out there, trying to get back?”

I shook my head.

“You really believe that?” I asked. “You really think I’d come back and… what? Forget how you like your coffee? Forget how Ellie always sleeps with one sock on? Just get it close enough?”

“You think I don’t see it?” she said. “You’ve been looking at them! Out there! In the guesthouse! Like they’re your real family… Like I’m the replacement.”

We stared at each other.

And then we both turned, slowly. To look at him.

He smiled, just a little.

And said nothing.

Then suddenly - the feeling of Ellie, pressing up against me.

I didn’t look down at first. Just let her cling to my side, small and trembling. Maybe she didn’t want to see us fight, I thought. Maybe it all scared her. Of course it would have.

I placed a hand on her back, gently.

“It’s okay,” I murmured, voice raw. “It’s gonna be okay.”

That’s when I felt it.

A sting, sharp and sudden, down near my thigh, like a needle slipping in sideways. I flinched, eyes darting down, and for a split second, I didn’t understand what I was looking at.

And then, something else.

A flicker.

Her shirt; it wasn’t the same one.

Not the faded cartoon one she’d been wearing on the couch. Not the one I’d carefully tucked the blanket around just that morning.

This was the other one.

The one guesthouse-Ellie had been wearing.

The cold came next. Blooming outward from the puncture.

I looked at her face. Sweet. Unblinking.

“I missed you, Daddy,” she said. 

But she wasn’t saying it to me.

And then everything started to tilt. The ceiling slid away like paper.

The last thing I saw before it all folded was house-Lauren, her eyes wide. Not with anger anymore, but horror. Recognition.

As we fell, she met my eyes.

My Lauren.

And then the dark came down, gentle and complete.

…

I woke to the low hum of the basement furnace.

Dim light filtered through the small slit of a ground-level window, dust dancing in the beam like ash suspended in amber. My leg pulsed dully in a distant ache. My back pressed against cool concrete, and beside me, warmth.

Lauren.

Her head rested against my shoulder, one hand curled lightly near my chest, as if she’d fallen asleep mid-reach.

Just beyond her, tucked beneath an old wool blanket, were Alex and Ellie. Curled together on a pile of stored winter coats, pale and still.

They hadn’t stirred.

I didn’t move at first. Just listened. The silence wasn’t total. Pipes creaked overhead, and somewhere far above, something akin to footsteps shifted. But down here, it was still.

Lauren stirred. Blinked.

Then looked at me.

“You’re still here,” she whispered, voice hoarse from sleep.

I nodded. “Didn’t have anywhere else to go.”

She sat up slowly, her eyes flicking past me toward the children. “They’re still out?”

“Whatever they gave us… it’ll wear off,” I said. “Eventually.”

She let out a breath - long and unsteady. “I thought I’d lost you again.”

“I thought I was the one being replaced,” I said quietly.

“We both did,” she murmured. “We were both so scared of being wrong.”

For a moment, neither of us spoke, as if allowing the squeaky pipes above to weigh in on our conversation.

Then she said:

“Looking back… the way Alex stared at you so intently - I think he knew. In his heart of hearts, I think he recognized you. Even when I couldn’t.”

I followed her gaze. Alex’s arm had fallen across Ellie protectively, fingers twitching now and then.

“I didn’t spend enough time with him,” I said. “Always focused on Ellie. She needed more help. Or maybe I just… didn’t know how to talk to a boy that age without screwing it up.”

“He never took it that way,” she said. “He looks up to you, Daniel. Even when he was scared, he watched you like he was waiting for something.”

“I thought he was just afraid.”

“He was,” she replied. “But not of you.”

I swallowed hard. My throat burned.

“I wanted to believe it wasn’t you,” she said. “Because if it was, then I’d have to admit I almost gave you up.”

“I wanted to believe you weren’t real,” I said. “Because if you were, then I’d have to admit I couldn’t tell. That I failed.”

“We were both fools.”

“Yeah,” I said. “But we’re still here.”

We sat in silence, the weight of everything unspoken thick around us. Just the four of us now; one family, stunned and quiet and still alive, as morning crept across the world above.

Just then, I heard a small, sharp inhale.

Alex stirred among the winter coats, face scrunching up as if trying to push the sleep out from behind his eyes.

“Dad?” he whispered.

I nodded. “Yeah, buddy?”

He looked to Lauren. Then to Ellie, who shifted in his arms a second later, rubbing her eyes and curling instinctively toward the sound of our voices.

Her voice was even smaller. “Are we home?”

I didn’t know how to answer that. But Lauren did.

“We’re together,” she said. “That’s what matters.”

Alex sat up. “They’re still here, aren’t they? The other ones?”

Lauren nodded grimly. “We’re not safe yet. But we will be.”

There was no grand declaration. No rousing speech. Just the quiet resolve that passes between people who have nothing left to lose.

We began to plan.

…

It was our seventh day down in the basement.  The bruises had faded. The cuts had scabbed. But the house was still wrong. Still watching.

Down in the basement, we ran through the routine one last time. Bags packed. Paths memorized.

Lauren adjusted the strap on Ellie’s backpack, her hands steady.

Alex looked to me. “We ready?”

I looked at all of them.

And nodded.

“Let’s go.”

The lock on the basement door gave a soft click, almost imperceptible, as the paperclip - one we managed to scrounge up among the basement clutter - twisted in Lauren’s shaking hands.

She let out the barest breath. Relief. Fear.

I pushed the door open an inch at a time, listening.

No footsteps.

We'd studied them for days - the rhythms above us, their routines. Their lives. We knew when the kitchen floor would creak, when they paused in the hallway to murmur just out of earshot.

Up the stairs. One by one.

We held our bags tight. Left the heavier things behind. One chance.

The hallway yawned ahead, quiet and dim.

We crept past the coat rack. Past the shoe mat. Every breath loud in my chest.

The front door waited, barely ten feet away.

I reached out.

Fingers touched the knob.

Turned.

I turned, just long enough to find Lauren’s hand behind me.

And then I felt it.

A sting. Low, sharp, buried near the hip.

Another.

Her breath caught - a thin gasp.

I spun.

Ellie stood behind me. And Alex. Pale. Wide-eyed. But wrong.

The way Alex’s shoulders sat. The way Ellie’s hair curled too neatly at the ends.

“Why?” I breathed. The cold was already spreading. "Why would you-"

They said nothing.

Then, from the living room down the hall, a sound. Struggling. Wet cloth against duct tape.

And I saw them through the doorframe. Tied. Gagged. The real Alex. The real Ellie. Eyes wide. Desperate. Locked on mine.

Behind me, the others stood quietly.

And smiled.

I stumbled backward, eyes locked on the children — no, not children — things wearing my children’s faces. My legs felt hollow. Cold bloomed outward from the punctures like frost through old pipes.

And then he stepped into view.

From the living room. From behind the real children.

Me.

Or something wearing me just right.

Faux-Daniel's smile was gentle. Familiar. Off by half a second.

"Going somewhere?" he asked.

Lauren moved before I could stop her.

She slammed her shoulder into me, drove me backward toward the door. I tried to catch her, but my limbs wouldn’t cooperate.

The door swung open behind me.

Light. Air. Cold and real.

“Run!” she screamed. Her voice cracked - desperate and raw - and she shoved again, hard.

I stumbled out onto the porch. The world tilted. My feet found gravel, then grass, then pavement.

Behind me, the door swung shut.

Just before it closed, I looked back.

He was there.

My double. Standing in the doorway, framed by the house light.

And Lauren. My Lauren - no longer screaming, no longer fighting - caught between them.

Then the latch clicked.

And I was alone.

Standing in the middle of the road, breath like fog in the night air, legs shaking.

…

I ran. Or tried to.

The cold in my limbs made everything feel distant, rubbery. I stumbled down the road, shoes slapping the wet pavement. Houses passed by like memories — flickering porch lights, curtains shifting.

I must’ve walked for hours.

Or minutes. Time bent strangely around me, refusing to settle.

Eventually, someone found me. An older man, maybe, or a teenager - I can’t remember exactly. They helped me into their truck, asked questions I couldn’t answer, dropped me off outside a 24-hour diner with a motel next door.

Now I’m here. In some dingy motel room, the walls thin enough to hear the neighbors arguing two doors down.

I haven’t slept.

I keep picturing Lauren’s face in that doorway. Her eyes when she pushed me. The look she gave me — not just desperate. Trusting. Like she believed I could fix this.

So I will.

Because if I don’t - if I leave them there, living out some mimicry of our life, with those things wearing our faces, then no one else ever will.

Because I saw the fear in Alex’s eyes. I heard Ellie’s muffled cries.

Because she chose me.

Because I’m still me.

I had once thought about driving straight to the sheriff’s office. Telling someone what had happened. But the more I played it out in my head, the clearer it became.

They weren’t hiding.

They were living. Shopping at the same grocery store. Answering the same phone. Taking the kids to school in my car, waving at the neighbors.

They had proof. Alibis. A full week of surveillance footage if anyone bothered to check.

I didn’t have anything. No wounds. No evidence of a struggle. Just a story that sounded like a breakdown.

And what if I did tell someone? What if the cops did come knocking?

What would stop them from opening the basement door… and finding it empty?

From smiling and saying, “There’s no one else here.”

From killing them and burying them in the time it took me to get a search warrant.

*How can they be dead*, they’d ask, smiling, *if they’re right here?*
