Hey guys, Midnight Rose here, it’s my first time posting. I finally got the courage to share something I’ve been dealing with that’s steadily growing worse yet I’m not sure how to grapple with it because it’s a unique situation with lots of emotional ties for me. Maybe telling you will help me.



I don’t know what to say or how to explain it. I keep having these dreams where either bugs are invading my house- millipedes, spiders, the works. I hate bugs. I hate creepy crawly things that wriggle into my vision at the last moment right before I might step on them. I mean, it’s pretty normal for someone with years of a fertile imagination growing within them. At least I tell myself this. I think quite a few of you can relate to that sentiment, but hold on because it gets way weirder. I’ll say if you’re squeamish and don’t like gross body stuff then you might wanna click off now or go for it, it’s up to you! I’m the kind of writer who seeds both viscera and elegance into a death rattle that blooms like waltzing rot in your throat. 



I digress, so let’s get into some background first:



It started with an old, decaying house with pea-green, stained carpet that squelched underfoot. I remember wearing socks in these dreams, so the murk soaked into these socks. The roof was open with splintered wood swaying like broken bones held in loose bags of skin and sinew. Bugs like centipedes and millipedes would crawl up from beneath the rancid shag carpeting and swarm, only to herd themselves out of a nearby window -or what was left of one- towards the forest that looked like it was the painted backdrop of an old videogame like the original Playstation.



And then the dream would end with my gaze rooted at the forest.



But now, and I’m not sure if I’m lucid dreaming or not, but in these dreams I can will myself to move forward. Maybe it’s something goading me, and it feels like a breeze nudging the backs of my knees and the backs of my pupils. Forward.



Last night, I made landfall. I took off my soggy socks that had begun growing little mushrooms along the toes that looked like little eyes or holes that stank of earthen decay. The bugs from the house were following me in droves. As I dragged my feet through the bog, I noticed what looked like tree people pushing crude wooden wheelbarrows. I can’t tell you how horrifying the screams that were coming from within these wheelbarrows. Babies that were both in a rotting state but were crying with bark protruding from different parts of their bodies, their blood sticky, and gluing them to the bottom where roots growing from their belly buttons, snaking around and searching for the nutrients from an earthen womb. Sprigs were blistering out from underneath their fingernails, one from a thumb had begun to grow bark.



But I would not be dissuaded from such a horror, I had to find MY tree, and I knew it to be somewhere in that forest.



And after what felt like years of carrying my leaden weight through the bog, I found her, and she was beautiful. She told me her name was Catalpa and that she knew me in the world outside of dreams. Catalpa of Thundering Repose spoke into my mind and told me how she had died by lightning in my world, and I remembered that time Mom sat me down at the dinner table to tell me my favorite tree had been struck during the storm and might not make it. Tears rained down my cheeks and it felt like droplets on desert sand. At least she was here in my dreams, though she was encircled in painful transformation and death and life and then more death and more life.



I stepped towards her, I was ready for my transformation. Touching her gnarls in her thick, leaning trunk, I could feel something that began itching just under my fingernails. It was followed by little sprigs that began pulling up each fingernail as the skin grazing Catalpa’s bark began stitching itself to it. I wanted all of me to be her. It wasn’t even painful. I dragged my feet closer and fell against her and soon my skin began to age, my stomach feeling tight as an enormous pressure behind my bellybutton erupted into roots. My flesh flew open with not blood but pollen and sap. These roots snaked around into the ground to meet with Catalpa as I laid on the ground beside her, slumped over with tears, and pus, and roots and and no more fingernails. I had wanted to get a tattoo to etch my memory of her forever onto my body. But this was better, this was my ideal death. Or is it death but something far more grand?



And then I woke up.



I woke up and thought I had cut my thumb just under my fingernail and put a Band-Aid on it. It started itching and itching, soon all of my fingernails felt off.



Now, it’s been two days and the cut under my thumbnail just isn’t healing. I’ve been to Urgent Care, and then it struck me: this is just like what had happened in my dream. It’s getting worse, and I don’t know how to feel about it. Guys, do you think it’s actually happening or am I being super paranoid and maybe some fucked up part of me WANTS this.



Catalpa is so comforting, she’s been the only thing that brings me any respite from the pain now. Though she died 20+ years ago, she calls out to me when I shutter my too-open eyes and drift into the night or daydreams.



The thumbnail on my right hand feels like it’s going to explode, I can see a little, tough blister forming, and it’s all I can do to write this. Maybe it’s all for nothing, today I went back to Urgent Care and they don’t know what to say.



So, maybe I’ll just take a drive across the country and see that slight mound where she used to stand at the old house made from magic and nostalgia. I had sworn I’d never step on it until my ashes blanketed it in my final repose.



I think I’ve lived a pretty full life until this point, I’ll bandage my fingers so I can make the drive.



When I get there, it’ll either get better or I’ll meet my Catalpa in a final pilgrimage. I’ll pack a few things tonight and leave tomorrow morning. 



Please keep me company on the long drive as I wheel myself to her.
