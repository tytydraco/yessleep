I should start off by saying that I’m no stranger to aspects of the occult. It doesn’t mean what most people think it does. When someone says the word “occult” the first thing that tends to pop into people’s head is folks clad in black robes standing around a pentagram, sacrificing goats and praying to the devil. That’s not my understanding of the occult. I simply see it as anything that deals with spirits or the energy surrounding them. That is what I was taught to see it as anyway, having grown up in a witchy household. I never dove into the darker corners of such practices. I’ve mostly stuck to tarot readings, warding, a little bit of pendulum stuff and things like that. And though I’ve grown up and adopted more modern practices, my interest in the occult never really faded which is why I still dip my toes into the proverbial pond from time to time.

Like many others in this day and age, one of the more modern interests I’ve picked up is surfing the internet. Still having an interest in the occult my algorithm has incorporated such topics, leading me to playing videos on the subject to listen to as background noise as I go about my adult life. I recently started a series of videos about King Solomon, the kind of stuff that he supposedly got up to, and his codex. That inevitably led me to the contents of his codex; specifically Paimon, the 9th prince of hell.

I’ve never had any interest in demons; if they even exist. I alway’s figured they were just dark entities best left on read and uninvited, but this one kind of intrigued me. Supposedly the 9th prince of hell, Paimon represents knowledge, the sciences, intellect and precision; everything that is the opposite of what I hate about myself. You see, I’ve always been pretty dumb. Like special education dumb. Nothing has ever come easy to me and I’ve always envied those who are quicker on the take than I, which is pretty much everyone. Apparently this demon prince is all about the opposite of what I am. What I wish I was. The entity also supposedly *chose* to descend in spite of its high status in the other direction. Why would such a being of such status *choose* to fall? I’ve never wanted to ask the question so badly. Especially to one that may know the answer. That’s when I got to thinking… if any of this is even real… and that’s what this entity is all about… then what’s the harm in trying?

I admit I put a lot more effort into studying the matter of summoning Paimon than I should have before finally giving myself a dope smack. “Nothing good could come of that” I thought to myself before proceeding with the unending slew of chores that is married life with two kids. It’s hard work, but it is fulfilling so I don’t mind. That is unless my chronic pain that has plagued my entire adult life decides to flair up, which it did that day for seemingly no reason. I had no medicine for the pain, but I did have alcohol. That did the trick well enough. The pain was staved off effectively enough to get everything and everyone situated for the evening. But as I did so something weird happened. The pain had gotten worse than it ever has, seemingly unprovoked, and no amount of “medicine” could quell it. In agony, but with everything and everyone taken care of, I laid down on the floor. And I passed out. But I remember thinking “wouldn’t it be nice to know what Paimon knows”right before I slipped into a deep sleep and dreamt many dreams. 

I’ve had lucid dreams before, but I’ve never had several in a row without first waking up. I dream’t of hanging out with friends around a coffee table; of Blue skies in grassy meadows; of walking down a pleasantly lit street on a starry night. Nothing out of the ordinary… but these dreams were **vivid**. The smell of the coffee, the feel of the breeze, the ambient sounds, the light of the stars… I sensed everything, and in astonishing detail. And I had full control. But every time I tried acting against the dream by making my own reality I would be swept off to the next one. This cycle repeated for what felt like hours, but the dreams were rather pleasant so I didn’t mind. That is until I wasn’t pleasantly swept off to the next one, but rather instantly blinked into a space that I could not fully comprehend. 

I found myself in an enclosed area and it was as if my senses had just instantly been switched off. There was no sound, no smell or taste; I couldn’t even feel the ground underneath my own feet. But I could see. I saw endless perfectly symmetrical shapes floating about the space, each one different in shape but polished and brilliantly reflecting light from an unseen source that emanated both everywhere and nowhere. It was brilliant, but stagnant. The entirety of the space filled me with an overpowering feeling of blankness that permeated even my most basic emotions. It felt like nothingness. Then my own voice spoke to me from some unseen source. 

“What time is it?” it asked.

“It’s almost 5” I softly droned in my numbness; my words echoing about the space. “It’s time to wake up.”

“**Not. Yet.**” Spoke my own voice again, this time in a devious tone.

I was still lucid. I was aware that I was dreaming and figured that I could hence wake myself up.  But I couldn’t. This dream was persistent. It would not allow me to alter its reality; it *was* reality, and it would not let me go. There was no escape. No exit. I felt as if I were gripped in the clutches of an unseen force. My mind began racing; telling itself anything and everything that might bring this borderline nightmare to an end. That’s when I was spoken to again, except this time the voice was not my own. It was like a very high-pitched, Monty Python-esque, little boys cockney accent paired equally and symmetrically with a vicious and low gutteral tremor of a sound that may have been a voice in and of itself, but would’ve been incomprehensible were not paired with the other voice. I did not catch what it said at first given my frantic state, but then it demanded my attention. “May you see and won’t you feel when the horse dies three days after when?” it both sang and growled.

My eyes opened. I was once again on the floor. I looked outside the window. The first thing I noticed was how different the telephone line looked through the security tinted window. How close it looks compared to the other half that was visible through plain screen. I found it fascinating. My back pain was… gone. It was actually straight and I was not leaning anymore. I’ve felt great ever since that night, but I have noticed some strange things ever since. Things like shadowy figures always dancing just on the outskirts of my sight, doors opening and closing on their own, and I seem to have developed a newfound fascination with shapes and lines. I can’t help but appreciate them, sometimes for longer than I probably should. And the question has lingered in my head… when the horse dies three days after when… I can hear it still in my head. And in the same voice.

But aside from that, I feel good. My pain is gone and I’ve not felt so well in many years. I don’t know if it had anything to do with those dreams, or even why I had them. I have heard of some energy workers utilizing alcohol to “thin” the veil during their rituals, but I myself have never attempted it. Not on purpose anyway. I can’t help but wonder if that’s exactly what I accidentally did. But feeling so well after that I can’t help but wonder… whether it’s real or not, if this feeling is what such a ritual has to offer, or if it’s merely coincidental, then what’s the harm in trying? I’ve never wanted to ask the question so badly. Especially to one who may know the answer. Or so speaks the translucent shadow peering over my shoulder.
