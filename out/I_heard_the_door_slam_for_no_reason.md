My parents bought an old house from my great-grandma that went into the retirement home last year. They decided to renovate the inside. 

A quick backstory (you can skip this part):
So when I was still in primary school i went to visit my great-grandma with my brother and grandparents quite frequintly. Great-g was living alone, because her husband died when me and my brother were born so she needed my grandpa to help her with basic chores around the house. The house is huge and whenever i had to go alone past the garage, basement and some rooms along the way to get to the center of the living basis i hurried cause i got this sense of dread. The house also has an unfinished attic which could potentionally serve as an apartment itself, cause of its layering and bigness but they never really payed much attention to it. 

Now that my parents own the house I visit the house even more frequintly. It serves as a weekend house since they rarely go there (its like 2hour car drive to get there). But they are very determined with the renovation and are holding big plans with it for their retirement. 

I still get this sense of dread whenever im in the lower half of the 3-story house like when i was younger but I brush it off like Its only my paranoia or my "wokeness" from all of the true crime and paranormal activites i have read or watched.

Recently i have been getting a strange feeling about the upper part of the house- attic. I started to feel the same sense of dread like from the basement and im not stepping a foot there alone ever.

Today we went to visit the house again, cause im planning to spend my new year there with a couple of my friends since we wanted someplace private, but not gonna lie i feel scared.

Our visit started normal, pulled up to the driveway, unlocked the house and went in. When im passing the rooms with my parents i feel at ease. 
Then it started. My mom is a perfectionist and she knows where she leaves things. To her word some things werent in their right place and the keys to the main living quarters were on the wrong side of the door. I could see it spooked them a bit but they Just brushed it off. The rest of the day went normal and we went home at about 6pm. Its winter time so its already dark. My mom instructed me to take her coffe mug cause her hands were full but i forgot to take it since i left it on the table as i was putting my shoes on. When she remembered me as we were already outside i quickly went in with my flaslight on the phone to go get it. It went smooth, a bit spooky but nothing unusual untill i heard it. 
As i was approaching the door to the garage, where my dad was standing i heard a big door slam in the upper part of the house. 
Spooked the shit outta me.
I ran so fast outside and started to tell them about it but they dismissed it and didnt even believe me one bit.

Now i am convinced there are probably some squatters living in our weekend house or some ghosts just coexisting there.

Either way im going with my friends there in a couple of days And im not planning to share this with them.
Is there any possible explanation for this occurence?
