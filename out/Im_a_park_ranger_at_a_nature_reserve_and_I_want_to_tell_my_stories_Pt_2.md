Hey y'all! I was trying to remember some good stories for y'all, a lot of the best ones are still under investigation, and remembered the first time I encountered a mimic. Nasty fuckers that, imo, should be wiped of the face of the earth.

It was my second or third year at the reservation so I had a little bit of experience under my belt. It was a particularly cold winter that year, and I remember most of the guys had gone home for the holidays. I decided to stay on the trail to get some overtime. (The pay is incredible with overtime and holiday pay) I went on a standard circuit and was almost finished with it when I heard what sounded like a woman crying. I, as most of us, always heard the stories about people being lured away into the woods by what sounds like an injured woman, just to be jumped by a demon thing. However, my job was to go out looking for people and helping them get back to safety if they needed help. So I started off towards the direction of the sound.

I followed the sound for probably 300 yards off the circuit. I was very very much considering just saying "Fuck this shit, I'm out" and hightailing it back to the circuit and finishing up for the day, but my curiosity and the pain I heard in the woman's voice drew me further into the woods. This part of the reservation is very thick with trees. These ancient oak and walnut trees that are much larger than most would think these species could get to. Turns out when you leave a forest to grow for a couple centuries without harvesting a single tree, these things get massive. The largest tree on the reserve is a truly colossal oak that, from what the scientist on the reserve can tell, is over 700 years old. All this to say, it was dark and very wooded.

The cold didn't help the feeling that this was a horrible idea. Like I said it was an extremely cold winter around the middle of December. Ice cycles hung from the branches of the ancient trees, occasionally falling and shattering, as I went through the woods. Mind you, they weren't falling near me. (most of them) I could hear them crashing into the snow or lower branches off in the distance. My assumption at the time was that they had just gotten too heavy for the branches to hold them, but now I know better.

I finally came up to a camp site that was NOT on our maps as one of the usual sites that trespasses you. This isn't uncommon. Dumb teenagers from around the area or tourists will make new camp sites in random places in the woods. Standard procedure for finding one of them is to mark them on your map and report to higher command. Of course telling whoever made the site to kick rocks. This site looked to be recently abandoned. There was no sign of anyone there, and the crying had ceased; the last time I heard it was about 10 yards before I found the clearing with the site. It appeared that a fire had been lit, but it was going out now. There were two tents set up near enough to the fire that they'd be warmed by it, but not near enough that it would be a fire hazard. I looked in and around the tents; strangely there was no sign that either of them had been used. No blankets, bags, electronics, or any personal items. It was as if someone had come out to the middle of the woods, set up a camp site, lit a fire and vanished into the woods again.

I noticed there was what looked to be a trail leading away from the camp site. I saw footprints in the snow following the trail. They were small footprints of someone who was barefoot. Cautiously I followed the trail to the mouth of a small cave on the side of the hill. It looked like the cave had been dug out of the hill by hand. I don't mean by hand held tools. It looked like someone had painstakingly dug out a hole in the side of the hill with their bare hands. There were little trail marks in the sides that looked like fingernails had scraped them out. Inside the cave I saw what looked like four or five short, pale humanoid creatures. They didn't look human, however. Their limbs were misshapen, and it looked like they were shifting lengths as I watched them.

After I'd taken a good look at the creatures, I decided to get the hell out of there. I tried to sneak away as carefully and quietly as I could back to the camp site, and from there retrace my steps back to where I'd left off on my circuit. About half way back to my circuit something fell on me from a tree branch. I fell to the ground and scrambled to throw whatever it was off me. I was a wrestler in high school so I knew how to get someone off my back, and the thing that had dropped on me was much smaller than I was at the time. I was able to get it off of me and pinned it to the ground with my knee on its chest. I saw a misshapen, small humanoid just like the ones in the cave. It was squirming trying to get me off of it, but I had probably 100 lb on it. Its face was gaunt, skin hanging off its skull like clothing rather than skin. As I watched, its face shifted and morphed disgustingly into something that resembled my face. It wasn't a perfect match, far from it, but it was close enough I could tell what it was trying to do. I decided that I wasn't going to give this thing another chance to get the jump on me. I pulled out my knife to slit its throat. It knew what I was trying to do and fought even harder to get me off of it. It ended up getting a few good scratches on my face and neck, but nothing to be too concerned about before I drove the knife into its throat, yanking it back and forth, sawing through it.

Once I was satisfied the thing was dead, I got up and sprinted back to where I'd left off on my circuit. I didn't think about trying to complete it. I just made my way through the woods in the straightest path possible to the office. When I got to the door of the office, I slammed it open, hurried inside and slammed it shut, holding it shut with my body. "Why the hell did no one tell me we have fucking mimics on the reservation!?!?" I shouted into the room at no one in particular.

"Mimics?" Anderson said confused.

González looked up from the book he'd been reading, "Mimics? As in something that can turn into something else?" His tone was concerned.

"Yes! Fucking mimics, I was attacked by one in the woods!"

"Fuck I though we'd wiped their nest out..." González muttered. "Alright Anderson, I'm going to go out with Warren to the area that he was attacked by the mimics and we're going to attempt to wipe out any nests they made."

"Hold the fuck on. Mimics... we have mimics in the woods" Anderson seemed shocked and confused, a fair reaction. Seemed he didn't know about this either even though he'd been at the reservation for three years before I'd joined on.

"Yes, mimics. They're nasty fuckers and we need to wipe them out before they spread too far."

I, as you could imagine, was pretty pissed off that I wasn't told about these things before, but that's kinda how things worked on the reservation. You found out about creatures from experiencing them. For the majority of the creatures on the reserve, you'd find out about them during your first year there, when you always went out with a more experienced ranger.

I grabbed a shotgun from one of the gun lockers, a Mossberg 590 12 gauge 20" barrel. González grabbed one as well, and we headed back up my circuit the opposite direction that I'd come from to reach the point that I'd found the camp site. It was a silent walk back. The only sound, the snow crunching under foot. We came to the point where I went into the woods to find the woman. "Oh shit I never found her..."

González looked at me confused. "Found who?"

"There was a woman crying in the woods. That's what drew me off the circuit."

"Kid that was probably one of the mimics. They were trying to pull you further into the woods so they could kill you and learn your form." González said. Putting a hand on my shoulder. "Now lets find these things and end them."

We went down the same way I'd gone before, coming across the body of the one I'd already killed. González nodded at me approvingly, and we continued into the woods. We snuck upon the camp site, trying to be as quiet as possible. It was exactly how I'd left it before. The only difference being the fire was completely out now. I showed González the small trail that led to the mouth of the makeshift cave. We crept to the entrance of the cave. "Alright son, let's do this quick so we can get out of the cold. These things aren't hard to kill, but if they get too abundant they'll become a problem. How many did you see?" González said in a whisper.

"I saw four or five." I replied as quietly as possible.

González nodded. He held up one hand counting down from 3, 2, 1. When he finished the count we rounded the corner and faced the entrance of the cave. There were four mimics in the cave, crouching around two bodies that were half eaten. 12 gauge buck shot rips through a deer extremely well. It's rips through humans even better than that. For the mimics, it practically turned the parts of their bodies that got hit into red sludge. These ones were extremely frail and small. It only took one shot from one of us to dispatch them.

Once we were satisfied that they were dead, we walked into the cave. It wasn't too dark, but we both turned on the flashlights that were hooked up to our shotguns, still aware that more could be in here. Once we'd swept the entire cave, it was pretty small. We looked over the bodies that the mimics had dragged in here. We found ID's on both of them. I'm not going to put who they were for obvious reasons, but they weren't locals. It appeared they'd come in from out of state. González burned the bodies of the mimics in the cave. He asked me to carry the one I'd stabbed in the woods in there as well to make sure they could be taken care of all at once.

We managed to find the belongings of the two people a little bit into the woods from the opposite direction that we'd come. We used the sleeping bags to wrap the bodies and drag them back to the office so they could be collected by the proper authorities. Once that was handled, González explained to me and Anderson that he and a few of the other older rangers had cleared out a mimic nest about a decade back. Clearly they'd missed one or two of them, and that's how we got to this situation. Anderson and I knew better than to ask too many questions about the previous incident. If you needed to know something you'd be told, but most of the things about the reservation are things that you'd prefer not to know if you didn't have to. I know it's ironic to say that since I'm documenting the events that took place here, but I'm pretty sure y'all have read or experienced worse.

Anyway, I hope everyone has a wonderful day. I've got to get back the paper work I was neglecting by writing this down. Newbies this year are finding more and more idiots out in the woods so I have to do more paper work to document it all for our records.
