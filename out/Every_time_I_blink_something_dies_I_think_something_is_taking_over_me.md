\*WARNING: Insects and gore. Go ahead otherwise\*

You always hear the craziest things that happened to someone. Rumours of someone being cursed by their dead-ex. Gossip that a scumbag was six-timing and yet his fiance/girlfriends/friend-with-benefit still wanted to be with him.

And then that crazy thing happens to you, just in a split-second. Like a blink.

There was nothing wrong with the way the light sliced through the faded curtains and onto my face. Nothing wrong as my hand groggily slapped the alarm shut, twisting out of warm blankets, toes snugging into the plush carpet, yawning as my feet carried me across warm floorboards to the window. Nothing wrong as I tied up the curtains, hand stifling a yawn, basking in daylight.

I took a look at my Monsterra pot and it started to shrivel.

Lush green turned yellow in an instant, browning, and then a husk of a plant. Just a dried up stalk and crispy leaves clinging to the hollow shell.

An itch began across my left wrist, and I absently clutched it even as I blinked, uncomprehending, at my plant.

Dead, just one amidst the little garden that I had cultivated on my tiny windowsill. A patch of brown, among the green, blues and whites.

I almost felt sick, but swallowed it down as I looked at my wrist. 'I', red and raw and still itchy.

It was only until day 'VI' that I realised how it worked. Until then, I had woken up, and quietly watched as my little garden winked out, leaving just an aloe vera and snakeplant among the browned shrivelled husks. I thought it was a blight, a disease, some bug. Nothing. Just me staring at them made them shrivel and die.

Day 'VI' begun with a buzzing. A bug, pounding at the window, warmed up and ready to fight the morning in full resplendour. If it could get past the invisible barrier.

Unamused, I sat up, glaring at its fat body as it gathered its strength to collide into the window. And in that instance, just as it pulled back, it froze, thumping towards the floorboards. I tentatively approached, prodded it with a book. Dead. Not the playing dead kind.

So I experimented. It's what a summer break is for, after all. To check why things kept dying around you in the morning as if you were some kind of deadly weapon.

It's tedious to explain every single things I did. But the gist of what I found can be summed up into 5 rules:

1. The moment I woke up on a new day, at any time of the day, looked at a living creature and blinked, it would die.
2. For something to die, I must specifically lock eyes with it - even a glance - and after I blink, it is dead.
3. Every time I wake up, the number on my left wrist increases, indicating the number of things that die when I look at them and blink.
4. Nothing happens when I look at myself in the mirror
5. Living creatures that have died to the blink: plants, animals, ~~(human?)~~

You might be wondering about rule 5. Here's what went down in this sorry state of things.

I started gathering things. Plants, first. I had to have a backup plan (in case things went south and...you'll read about it soon) especially as the numbers went up. And as I was blanking out, watching the ants start to crawl about the countless fly corpses in my bin, I had an idea.

Call it animal abuse. Call it a massacre. I'd rather it than lock eyes with a stranger passing by outside the street and watch them freeze, topple, hit the ground, leaking on to the pavement something red...it plagued my nightmares. So instead, I cultivated a kind of ant farm, coldly watching as tens of them halted and collapsed. Every day. I could nearly numb myself to it.

But the nightmares were a reminder that it wasn't enough. In my dreams I could see once more the corpse of the blackbird that alighted on my windowsill one morning, and with its chirp I was drawn to the way its glossy black feathers lurched towards the floorboards, a crack of hollow bird bones, and those glazed over eyes that once held curiosity. Only in my dream could I feel as if I was a hundred different scruttering things, legs marching in unison, maws open and hungry, clamping down on that warm warm flesh, slurping that warm warm blood. And then, lazily going back in single-file, towards my prone figure, with the last thing I see is my face, eyes wide open and inviting.

I woke up sweating buckets. Went to an eye doctor. Went to a psychologist. Nothing wrong. Stressed perhaps? Drink more water, sleep 7-8 hours, eat healthy. To hell with that.

I tried to figure out what was in my eye. What was my eye. Because as the days go on and the numbers on my wrist steadily reach the hundreds, I feel as if my eye itches. In a blink, my world fractures into hundreds of iridescent lens, the hues are shaded in yellow and the sun is almost muted and a husk of its blazing glory. Instead, the reds are shimmering and alluring, like fresh strawberry off the stem, aged wine down the throat. My eyes are squirming, almost like the way bees surround their queen, wings buzzing and quivering, a mass of tension and energy concentrated until its as if they're a single entity.

And my vision returns to a single pair of eyes, staring back at myself in the mirror. Scared out of my mind. Desperate.

I blindfolded myself that day. I hadn't looked at anything but the mirror. I was sick of the stench of death that seemed to linger around me, that sweet and unnatural stink.

I recorded it as day 'CCLXVII'. It was unremarkable, at first. When I calmed down, I thought it as brilliant. Maybe when I went to sleep and woke up, I won't have to watch my flailing ant colony, hundreds reduced to a scrawny tens. Nor wince at my floundering garden, a graveyard of browns, with a fresh batch set to arrive tomorrow. Nor let my eyes rove over the little bottle caps of nectar, bees and fruit flies, floating on the liquid gold. Or the little sparrows that had unfortunately come by the other day and landed on an inconveniently placed ledge beside my windowsill, unreachable and rotting away in the humid heat of summer.

I slept the entire day. And dreamt strangely.

Thousands of chittering, mandibles clicking. Clambouring across silk, down the bedframe, heading to the nearest signs of life. Leaves were torn to shreds, shovelled down throats. Stems stripped to their roots.

Across the floorboards now, cracking open the ant farm enclosure like a can of cold beer. Resistance was futile. The queen crumbled, maws gulping pieces of her strewn across the dirt, and the rest of the pathetic colony.

*"Not like our colony"* something thought.

Unsatisfied, venturing into the night, feasting on the carrion of the sparrows. Still greedy, latching onto the neighbouring shrubs, chewing til the roots. Then to the curious and suspicious cat, uncollared and scarred. A great battle was fought and won, and the trophy tonight was the fresh sleek splurt of red as maws clamped down and chewed. Chewed.

Lizards. Cockroaches. Centipedes. Devoured. Nearly satiated, just one more.

A rat scurried across the boot of a passer-by. A pause, almost contemplative, at the puny rodent and the hulking figure of so much meat.

The bones were gnawed thoroughly, glistening white in the moonlight as the thousands of legs now headed back. Up the walls. Past the windowsill. And now gazing into the black iris of a gaping eye.

The blindfold was still on me even as I woke, stuttering and stammering. I tore it off. Plants vanished, but for their roots. Ants gone, an unclosed enclosure case its only witness. It wasn't a nightmare. Rather, a living nightmare.

So I sit in my bathroom, fists clenched white. After the usual itch, my left wrist reads 'CCLXVIII', almost proudly pink.

It's been some time since morning. My abandoned blindfold lies on my bed. Ever since fleeing to the bathroom, I haven't left it once. My parents have banged at the door, and through the gap I can hear them discuss on getting the key. "Might have fainted in the bathroom or something" was the consensus.

My fears tick closer to becoming real, every passing second. A living nightmare. I wasn't lying when I said that in my nightmares, I saw a man die. Perhaps two hours ago, I stumbled across the room, searching and desperate. My phone ringtone buzzed til my frantic hand smashed it silent, as my eyes searched for anything non-living, anything living. A part of me whispered that I should have lied to my parents the former weekend and disappeared into some remote location, away from civilisation and the danger I was becoming, the danger it was growing into.

Robotically I scanned the rows of empty pots, to that ledge now absent of the sparrow carrion. Three bees and a fruit fly that sat, bloated near the honey water bottlecaps, froze and tumbled. That was when I made my first mistake. Coughing aloud.

My throat was dry from the hours of sleep and the rapid fire manner that the insects collapsed into their final meal didn't help. A hacking spittle came out my mouth. I clenched the windowsill, but the rattling from my shaking body only dislodged the bottlecaps of honey and dead bees. I heard a splatter, a muffled curse and swatting noises. Then silence.

I made my second mistake then, inching to the corner where I thought the victim would not be looking and briefly peering down. I was wrong. We locked eyes.

His accusatory glare stiffened, the brief glimmer of shock flashed by and then he hit the ground. I heard the quiet crack of rock on skull, the red that leaks but I knew that wasn't the reason for his soul leaving this world. Already I know that if I live past tonight, I will see him again, coffin or not, his post-partem pallour framed in iridescent hues, that yellow shirt of his a brilliant gold, and know that the excited chittering will end up in a frenzied chaos of flesh, gristle and sweet sweet meat.

Even as I hear footsteps approach the bathroom, I know I need to make a choice. One hand grasps the edge of my sink, while the other quavers, gripping the silver sheen of scissors. I aim the sharp point at my eye, again and again, as my courage lapses and rises like the tides. I can almost hear the chittering, feel the mass of energy and tension within my eye.

Almost at the brink of some sort of despair and desperation, I ask a question to myself, "Will gorging my eyes out end this?"

The iridescence of a hundred eyes flash in the mirror. My world breaks into one of yellow blooming across the cracks of tiles and the red that bleeds from my clenched fist. Something asks back, "*Meat?*"
