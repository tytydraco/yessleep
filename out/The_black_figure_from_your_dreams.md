I've always been able to sense things, a few years back i started to see what appeared to be a black silhouette. The black silhouette only appeared when i was asleep, it woke me up usually because i felt being watched, like waking up from a nightmare, and someone would be in the same room as you. It was weired because i sleep in a apartment building, was living only with my aunt at that time, i was in my roon, she was in her room. 

I remember that i woke up, because i felt someone staring at me, and i was too afraid to open my eyes, but i could feel his presence, his hand moving from my feet towards my face, i was too afraid to move, not knowing what would happen, but i didn't want to wait until his hands were near my face so i turn around, but there was nobody there. 

I had this experience a few times, and one time i wasn't even in my house. I had to leave town, for a job, i had to pass an exame, i wasn't alone, i was with a friend and we were staying at a hotel. 

I was at a hotel with another friend, we had separate beds, i remember that i woke up because i felt like someone was watching me, it was the same black figure. 
But this time it wasn't near my bed, but it was siting on my friends bed, just staying on the side of the bed and watching, i don't know how to explain it, because i didn't see it, but at the same time i could see it and feel it. 
At first i thought it was my friend, sitting there and watching me, but when i turned around she was alseep, lying down the bed and of course no sign of the black figure, only the presence of it. 
On both occasions  i was with by back turned around from it. These are the only ones that i remember  more vividly, but i do recall having similar experiences but not as clear as these two. 

I remember that i told my aunt about this, and she also mentioned about a similar figure, black, with big claws, she also mentioned that she was sleeping, but in her case it was under the bed, and it grabbed her leg. It sounded more scary than in my case, in my case i felt unease because i was asleep and felt like someone was watching me, but i didn't feel like it wanted to hurt me, but rather it was interested in me, if it makes any sense. He/it desired me. 

But my aunt wasn't the only one that saw this black figure, another friend mentioned that she had a similar experience, but unfortunately i do not remember the details of her story. 

It has been awhile since i saw it, and in my recent years i haven't felt it, but was curious if anyone else experienced this type of situation, if someone else has seen it or know what it is. 

I asked around and aparently i am not the only one who has seen or felt this black figure. 

Did you see it? Felt it? Do you know what it might be? Do you know what it wants? What it desires?
