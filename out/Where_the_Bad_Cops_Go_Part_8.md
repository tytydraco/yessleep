It’s difficult to adjust to having something change the way you do or see ordinary things. Like brushing your teeth. After getting stuck with SORE, I got a lot more conscious about my teeth and mouth. It took some time getting used to the feeling of having something in my throat ready to shoot out like a coiled snake.

Or having breakfast, knowing there was something lurking in my stomach, resenting me – wishing to take the reins. It was still there, but after my run-in with the lady in the blue kaftan, it’s as if I knew for a certain that it wouldn’t kill me. That, and it wouldn’t be an infection risk to others. That didn’t mean it was gone though.

 

Getting back on patrol with Nick, he was the first to notice I was behaving differently. We’d stopped for our bi-weekly gas station hot dog, and I got myself a pre-packaged sushi instead. There was something about less processed, and more raw food, that just made my stomach rumble with delight. Nick made the observation, acknowledged it, and let it go. He trusted me enough to tell him if something was up.

We were having a proper Minnesota summer, meaning rain when you least need it. The DUC had pulled back on their resources, leaving Tomskog PD to focus on setting up a more permanent station. According to Nick, there’d been talks about the Yearwalker getting himself killed or leaving the state, which meant peace and quiet – and the potential for something worse down the line. The whole reason for keeping the Yearwalker from getting killed was strictly because of a devil-you-know kinda deal. Someone else taking up that mantle could mean trouble.

But in our everyday life, Yearwalkers and the DUC were the farthest thing from our minds. Instead we picked up drunk teenagers, stopped speeding cars, or scolded shoplifters. Nick and I were even invited to speak about being in law enforcement at a local school. It surprised me how much Nick changed when he had an audience of kids; he blossomed up there. He was smiling ear to ear, engaging with the audience, and there was a sort of enthusiasm there that I hadn’t seen before.

Asking him about it, he had no idea what I was talking about. He shrugged it off as just getting along well with children.

 

One day, we checked the northwest trail around Frog Lake. It was an on-foot kinda path, so we used it as an excuse to take a longer walk. Nick wasn’t happy about it, but it was better than being cooked alive in a poorly-ventilated patrol vehicle. It was probably the hottest day of the year.

We were coming around the bend where the northern road curved back south. The left-hand side of the road, past the lake, was covered in pine trees. Walking past it, something stirred in me. Just a twitch. I stopped to look around.

Off in the distance, between the trees, I could see a man. He was about 6’5, bald, and dressed from top to bottom in a pitch-black trench coat. It looked so out of place that I couldn’t believe what I was seeing at first. I poked Nick and pointed the man out.

“Yeah, no, that ain’t right,” Nick said. “Should I shoot him?”

“We can’t just shoot people, Nick.”

“Then why the hell do I carry this badge around?”

He took couple of steps forward and whistled to get the man’s attention. There was no reaction. We gave each other a questioning look as we spread out a little, covering two angles.

 

Without turning away from us, the man backed off. Going further into the woods, there was a short section where we couldn’t see him. I hurried forward, yelling at him to stop, but once we got a bit closer he was already gone. But that stirring feeling in my stomach, that was still there. Nick caught up with me.

“We oughta’ tell the sheriff about this one,” Nick huffed. “Guy looked like a pervert.”

“He was something alright,” I agreed. “But I don’t know what.”

“Why are you saying ‘what’ and not ‘who’?”

“I dunno,” I shrugged. “Feels like a ‘what’.”

 

Getting back to our makeshift station at the old fire department building, we went upstairs to have a chat with sheriff Mason. He was already talking to someone, but they weren’t overtly secretive, so we figured it was fine to approach.

The sheriff turned to us with a plastered smile. His guest didn’t make an effort to step away, giving me the impression that this was someone in-the-know. It was a man in his early 50’s. He had a faded blue shirt, a black tie, and black jeans. But I think what stood out to me the most was his pocket protector. People still used those?

“Hank, these are two of my patrolling officers,” the sheriff said.

“Hank Dudley,” said the man, offering a hand to us. “Hatchet Pharmaceuticals.”

“I think I’m wearing socks from you guys,” Nick said with a grin. “Nice to meet you.”

We took turns shaking hands.

“You had something to discuss?” the sheriff asked.

“Yeah, we just wanted to bring something up,” I said. “But, uh…”

“Don’t mind Hank, he’s good people,” the sheriff said. “Let’s hear it.”

 

I told them about our patrol around the lake, and the man with the trench coat. And how he, seemingly, disappeared.

“Just gave me a bad feeling,” I admitted. “I dunno why.”

Hank gave me a curious look, as if making a mental note. The sheriff pondered his options for a bit, leaving the floor open for others to chime in.

“I think I know what that is,” Hank smiled. “And if it is what I think it is, we really need to be on the lookout. Sheriff?”

“Agreed,” sheriff Mason said. “Oughta’ make sure we’re all vigilant. I’ve heard of this thing, but it usually sticks to its home.”

 

As the sheriff walked away, and Nick went to get a coffee, I was left alone with Hank for a bit. He adjusted his tie and square-shaped glasses.

“Miss, what did you feel when you first saw this man?”

“Like a… general worry, I guess. Nothing out of the ordinary.”

“You feel that way a lot?”

“Not really, no.”

He quieted down, giving a once-over to make sure no one was close enough to listen in.

“Did you by any chance know Adam Salinger?”

I was going to deny it, but my reaction had already given away my honest answer. I sort of half-gasped, and turned it into a smile.

“Yeah, Adam,” I nodded. “Didn’t know his last name.”

 

Hank nodded as Nick returned with a coffee. There was something about Hank’s look that just screamed at me to run for the hills. We were law enforcement, yes, but this was one of the Hatchetmen – and in corporate America, people like him make the laws.

“If you see that trench coat man again, I suggest you call it in,” Hank said. “I don’t think it’d be a good idea to confront him.”

“We’ll keep that in mind,” said Nick. “There’s coffee in the break room, if you want.”

I shook my head. That stuff tasted like a tire fire.

 

The sheriff made an official order later. If we saw the strange man again, he was to be taken in for questioning. Patrols were actively encouraged to seek him out, and upon encountering him, call for backup and await further instruction. We were given a couple of recommendations. One was to not be stingy with tasers, and another to not engage even if the suspect looked unconscious. There was also a mention that a strong spearmint spray could be used as a repellant.

Yeah, that last one gave me pause too. Clearly they knew more than they were letting on, but it was useless to push for more. The sheriff was still seen walking around with Hank at his side, and the two of them seemed to have come to some sort of understanding. And they weren’t letting anyone in on their secrets.

 

Over the weeks that followed, there was this sort of cat-and-mouse deal with the trench coat man. Patrols would report seeing him around the high school at night, and there were people calling in saying they’d seen him standing on rooftops. This wasn’t just a one-time thing, it was recurring, and in proximity to ordinary people. But no one had been hurt – yet.

We saw him a couple of times too, but only in the distance. Once when cruising down the highway. It was just in passing, but he was there. When we stopped and doubled back, he was already gone.

Another time was when we came out of a pub downtown. We were taking in a woman for public intox and disorderly conduct when I saw the trench coat man on a roof across the street. As soon as he saw that we’d noticed him, he fled.

But what bothered me the most was my unease. Every time he was near, something stirred in me. A tickle of something unpleasant. And sometimes I’d feel it even when I didn’t see him, as if he was close by – but just out of sight.

 

It was late July when I got a call from Nick. I’d been at home for about two hours, relaxing after work, so I’d already kicked my shoes off and had dinner.

“He’s here,” Nick said.

No hello, no anything. Just that. I sprung out of my couch.

“Right now?” I asked.

“Right now,” he answered. “He’s right outside. I think he’s looking for a way in.”

 

I rushed to my car, grabbing only my gun and tool belt. Nick called down to the station while I rushed over. It was one thing for this stranger to stalk us from a distance, but we weren’t taking chances when it came to home intrusion. If someone had watched us for this long, they knew we were armed and dangerous. If they still wanted to pursue us, something was wrong.

By the time I got to Nick’s, I saw someone circling the right side of the building, peeking through the windows. I slammed my foot on the breaks, put the car in park, and got out with my gun drawn.

“Police, hands on your head!” I screamed. “Get on your knees, now!”

 

I was about 30 feet away, but I got a good eye. That uneasy stir in my stomach was going haywire, and I had to bite down not to have anything escape my throat. The man in the trench coat turned away from me and unfurled his jacket.

Except it wasn’t a jacket. It looked almost organic.

It started to vibrate, like the wings of a cockroach. Seconds later, he was gone – flown off into the night. My brain couldn’t register what’d happened fast enough. I could still hear the buzzing in the distance.

Then, I heard it again – this time from the other side of the building. There were two of them.

 

By the time I got to Nick, they were gone. He had locked himself in the bathroom – the only room without a window. I assured him that they were gone, and Nick got out with this pallid gray color on his face, like he’d seen a ghost.

“Those… those weren’t people,” he wheezed. “That… I don’t know what-“

“Yeah, yeah,” I nodded. “Me neither, Nick.”

“You see the size of that thing?!”

He was still clutching his gun as he ran his fingers over his balding head. I put a hand on his shoulder, getting him to lower the gun. He snapped to attention, turned the safety back on, and holstered it.

“What the hell did they want?” he asked.

I didn’t have an answer. But I could still feel something was wrong, and that couldn’t mean anything good.

 

June had rolled into July at this point. More people were passing through Tomskog on a weekly basis as vacations begun. Tomskog wasn’t the kind of place for people to come visit, but a lot of folks passed through on their way south from St. Cloud. At the very least they stopped for gas.

That meant we were getting more traffic than usual, and with traffic came traffic trouble. Instead of having a couple of stops a week, we went to having a couple of stops per day. We were also getting a lot more calls. People fishing without a license, underage drinking… all kinds of stuff. But through it all, I could see Nick deteriorate. He was clearly worried, and he often told me how he thought he might’ve seen or heard something. Whatever was out there was clearly not leaving him alone.

 

One morning, Nick didn’t show up for work. I was asked to go check on him. Coming to his house, I could see there was a good reason to be worried.

The front door had been broken, and there were smashed windows. I called it in to dispatch and requested another patrol. I approached and called out to him, but I got no answer. The kitchen was a mess. The fridge was wide open and beeping incessantly.

I eventually found Nick curled up in a closet – the one place no one had looked. I thought he was gonna shoot me when I opened those doors, but he kept his cool. I helped him up, feeling a shiver coming down his arm. He leaned back against the wall as he caught his breath and wiped his forehead.

“There’re way more than two,” he said. “Way more.”

 

That day, we were in out in full force. Patrols were knocking on doors, asking people if they’d seen anything. Officers were posted on rooftops. Charlie and Reggie on dispatch were keeping a map of the town at the station, marking the spot of every collective sighting. We were trying to find a pattern – something we could use to get a location.

We ended up with four possible sites to investigate further. The high school, an old scrap yard, a small house by the walking trail, and a house on the outskirts of town. All sites were to be investigated. Nick and I were to check out the lone house outside of town.

We drove out there just after lunch. Nick was still shaken up about the whole thing, but he was handling it well enough. He wasn’t his usual sarcastic self though.

 

It was a two-story house. Abandoned by the looks of it. All the windows were broken, and the paint was peeling off the walls. There was a messy yard with all kinds of scrap and broken tools scattered. A couple of empty planters lined the walkway to the front door. You could see the edge of an old greenhouse in the back yard. It must’ve been abandoned for some time, as the plastic that covered it had been suntanned by now. If you looked close enough, you could see a handful of dry blue sunflowers struggling along the treeline.

“Someone lives here?” I asked.

“Locals think it’s haunted,” Nick said. “And not like… fun haunted. But a people-go-missing kinda haunted.”

“People gone missing out here?”

“Long ago, yeah.”

“Ought to tear it down then.”

“We can’t even fill in potholes. This thing will be here for a century.”

 

We walked around the premises, checking the house from every angle. There was that tingle in my stomach again – a warning. I got the feeling that there was something there. I didn’t know how to tell Nick, so I just asked him to keep his eyes open.

Coming back around the front, I stepped up to the door. There was a strange smell to the place, like a combination of sulfur and ammonia. There were blue footprints on the wooden floor. I stopped to listen – noticing a clicking noise in the distance.

There was a long corridor leading through the house. There was a sharp turn to the right about halfway through the corridor leading into the cellar. There was something moving down there.

 

Walking through the corridor, I suddenly stopped. There was a vibration in my stomach, like something telling me to wait. Seconds later, I heard something.

“…*please leave*.”

It sounded like two people speaking at once in the exact same cadence, but different voices. It was coming from the cellar.

“Are you the owner of the property?” I asked.

“…*no, my mother was*.”

“We are here investigating a reported disturbance.”

“…*this does not concern me*.”

 

Nick pushed past me, knocking his hand on the wall.

“Alright, you need to come out,” he said. “We need to have a conversation.”

“…*I would much rather we did not*.”

“I’m giving you a lawful order,” Nick said. “You are not the owner of the property, you are trespassing. That and refusing a lawful order would be two charges.”

There was a short pause. Nick kept his hand on his taser, just in case.

“…*one moment*.”

 

A couple of seconds passed before we heard footsteps coming up from the cellar. Stepping out was the shape of a towering man. Tall enough to scrape the top of his head against the ceiling. He’d wrapped himself in blankets, showing only part of his feet. He had these strange black leather shoes with three pointed ends. I’d never seen that kind before.

He was absolutely massive. Nick took his hand off the taser, instead touching his handgun.

“Do you have any identification?” Nick asked.

“…*no*.”

“Do you have a name we could run?”

“…*Evan*.”

Nick looked back at me with a raised eyebrow. I shrugged back at him. There was nothing illegal about being a large and strange man, but I couldn’t shake this feeling that there was more to him.

 

As Nick looked around the decrepit kitchen and living room, I was left alone with the large man, Evan. I didn’t want to say anything, but he seemed curious about me.

“…*are you ill*?” he asked.

“Me?”

“…*yes*.”

I didn’t answer him. I just shook my head, waiting for Nick to finish checking the property.

“…*what are you looking for*?”

“A strange man in a trench coat,” I said. “He’s been spotted around this area.”

“…*they are not here*.”

“They?” I asked.

“…*they*,” Evan said. “*They are not strange men*.”

“You seem to know a lot about this.”

“…*yes*.”

 

Nick joined me in the hallway. The large man adjusted his blankets, hiding his strange shoes. He asked us to join him in the living room.

He sat down on an old moldy couch, almost folding himself in half. I’d never seen a man sit like that before. The couch groaned and complained as the springs struggled to support his weight. As he made himself comfortable, Nick decided to address the elephant in the room.

“Why are you wrapped up like that?”

“…*molting*,” Evan said.

“I’m sorry, did you say ‘molting’?” Nick asked. “Is that the word you used?”

“…*yes, officer*.”

Evan let out a hand from his pile of blankets. A thin stick-like arm, black as tar, with four fingers. It could be misconstrued as a strange glove, but it was much too thin for a man of his stature. He asked to borrow a phone, and Nick handed over his. He never told Evan the password, but he still managed to unlock it.

 

A couple of confident taps later, and Evan brought up a map. He pointed to an area next to the highway outside of town.

“…*they are looking for my friend*,” he said. “*They gather here. High ground*.”

“You know how many there are? What they are?”

“…*about a dozen. They are Hiders*.”

“Hiders?”

“…*they are stuck and can not go home. So they hide. And hunt*.”

A long stick-like finger tapped at the screen.

“…*they will leave. My friend is not here*.”

 

We didn’t get a lot more out of him. Evan wandered off back into the cellar, and we didn’t want to push our luck. I was getting chills just being near him, and Nick had been uncharacteristically quiet for some time. The moment the large man retreated downstairs, we got back to our patrol vehicle. Nick was breathing heavily.

“You okay?” I asked.

“It’s… dumb,” he said. “I’m fine.”

“What is it?”

Nick rolled his eyes, pointing back at the old house.

“He smells like ‘em.”

 

Going back to the station, we told the sheriff about the guy we’d met and the conversation we’d had. It seemed to make sense to him, and the rest of the search was called off. Nick was to sleep at the station for now. If these things hunted him for food, or whatever they were doing, there was no safer place to be.

Then we just had to wait, and hope, that they’d leave willingly.

 

A couple of days would pass. During an evening shift, we got a call about a serious car crash. The details were gruesome. One man was not only dead, but decapitated. One child, seemingly unharmed, was to be taken in by the CPS. We only got the information third hand and weren’t the first responders on-site. We could tell it was important though, even the sheriff was up in arms about it. The kid was apparently named Fred.

Patrols were asked to check the nearby area to make sure there was no one else hurt. The road was just covered with woodland in all directions, so if someone else had survived the crash they could be anywhere.

Nick and I checked the adjoining southern roads; old dirt paths leading westward. They were rarely used, but if someone had run south from the crash site, that’s where they’d end up.

 

Driving out there, as the sun was setting, I felt this constant sense of unease. My stomach was flaring up over and over, to the point where I was digging my fingers into the steering wheel. Nick must’ve noticed my white-knuckle driving and turned down the radio.

“What’s up?” he asked.

“I don’t know,” I said. “I just… it feels off.”

“Alright,” he said, adjusting his sunglasses. “Got any idea why?”

“It’s like… it feels like a warning. Like something’s up.”

“I don’t see anything,” Nick said, looking out the window. “But I trust you.”

“You do?”

“I mean, yeah,” he shrugged. “Don’t see a reason not to.”

 

Nick shone a light out the passenger side window as we slowly cruised down the dirt path. Suddenly, he tapped me on the shoulder.

“Stopstopstop!” he said “Right there!”

I stepped on the brakes, and he was out in a second. Putting the car in park, I rushed after him. We jogged a couple of seconds, only to see a man passed out in a ditch. He must’ve taken a tumble down a nearby hill, scratching himself in the underbrush.

Getting a closer look, Nick gasped. It was the younger Digman kid, Perry.

 

He was in his 20’s, but had the face of a teenager. But as we saw him, he might as well have been 50. He looked awful. It was clear he’d been in an accident, and he was bleeding from various cuts and bruises. His breathing was steady, but his shortness of breath told another story. He must’ve collapsed from exhaustion and blood loss.

We did a couple of basic checks. There was no need for CPR, so we figured we’d just call it in. But as soon as Nick put his hand on his radio, I stopped him. It wasn’t a conscious decision, but that second of silence saved us.

“What are you-“

“Listen.”

 

There were movements in the trees around us. Clicking. Buzzing. A strange barking noise, like a large, excited dog – only *wrong* somehow.

“Don’t make a sound,” I whispered. “Not. A sound.”

Nick clicked off his radio. We turned off our flashlights. We looked at the treeline, listening for movement.

Something jumped from one pine tree to another. Something buzzed overhead. Then, something collapsed on top of our patrol vehicle.

 

The thing must’ve weighed over 600 pounds. Over 7 feet tall, this thing was a whirlwind of elongated limbs, tendrils, and exoskeleton. It bent the roof of the patrol vehicle inward as a long arm reached inside. My first thought was that it could smell us.

Another joined it. They literally tore our car apart, flipping it on its side. The passenger seat was tossed across the road like it was a wet paper napkin. With strength like that, they could rip a human arm out of its socket in a heartbeat.

We barely saw them in the dark. In the shadow of the patrol vehicle, they were just silhouettes – like moths crawling on a dying light bulb.

 

With the car demolished, they spread out. The barking noise was some kind of thing they used to smell. I figured it was only a matter of time before they found us, but there was nothing we could do. Running would be useless, these things could fly.

“We can split up,” Nick suggested with a whisper. “Trick ‘em.”

“And leave the kid?” I whispered back.

“Fuck.”

Something brushed against a tree, no more than 20 feet away. A twig snapped.

“I’ve seen these,” Nick whispered. “Back in Juniper. But… smaller.”

I hushed him. He hushed me back.

“Listen,” he said. “They could smell SORE. The thing you got. It’s like fucking catnip.”

“So?”

“So that’s… that’s it,” he said. “We spend time together. I smell like you. So they follow us.”

 

It made sense. I’d lived with Nick during the time we stayed up for 72 hours. If they were drawn to SORE-infected people, they’d tear that place apart looking for him and me. It also explained my regular unease – they’d been spying on my place too. They must’ve noticed that harassing Nick caused me to come out to check on him, allowing them to spy on the both of us at the same time. They were clever.

“So it’s me,” I whispered.

“Probably.”

“You sure?”

“No.”

It was good enough for me.

 

I got out of the ditch and turned on my flashlight. I turned my radio back on, turned off the safety of my handgun, and took aim.

“Dispatch, I found a victim of the single-vehicle collision off 24^(th). We’re on-“

Nick tucked his arms under the unconscious Digman kid, dragging him away. The shadows gathered around me. Leather-like skin reflected off my flashlight as they ducked and weaved to surround me. I took a shot at one of them, causing it to buzz away with enormous force – kicking up a dust cloud, as gravel spattered across the hood of our broken car.

“-a dirt road south, westbound, heading towards the old scrap yard. We require immediate medical assistance and additional units, over!”

Releasing the radio, I spun around. Things in every direction. It felt like trying to push away water while standing in a lake.

 

Something shot out in front of me. A tendril, wrapping itself around my neck, as a pink beak-like mouth opened in front of me like a blossoming flower. Rows of teeth intermingled with black dot-like eyes, with numerous tendril-like tongues eagerly twitching my way.

A claw raked my arm, ripping away my handgun. I gasped as the pain registered, and as I did, white strands shot out of my mouth. They burned the tendril, forcing it to let me go.

I spat at the ground, taking my flashlight in my mouth as I picked up my gun with my left hand. This wasn’t over. Not yet.

 

They clicked, and buzzed, and barked. They were excited. My smell was exhilarating to them. In the distance, I could see Nick leaving the Digman kid on the road, and doubling back to help me. I spat out my flashlight.

“Stay back!” I yelled at Nick. “Go!”

Of course, Nick didn’t listen. He unloaded an entire mag on these things. They were taking some real damage, leaping away from me – but there were just too many. As our ammunition ran dry, the circle closed around me. A couple of them broke away to deal with Nick.

I remember throwing my handgun at them. I wasn’t going down without a fight, no matter how much it hurt.

 

I felt so helpless. Limbs reaching out of the dark to pull me away. A hulking monstrosity looming over my friend Nick, just further down the road. They’d all get what they were looking for, and there was nothing I could do. Predator and prey – the most primal, instinctive fear. The dawning realization that you are outmatched, and that the tools you’ve been given were not meant for fighting, but for fleeing.

A talon grabbed my neck, pushing me to the ground. Scratches against my back, as if trying to understand if my clothes were skin or shell. Barking, as hot air tickled my bleeding arm; they sniffed me.

Something big bent down, and seconds later there was this immense pain coming from the back of my head. It tore out a thumb-sized chunk of my hair; eating it. Savoring it.

 

Then, they stopped. Maybe they just listened, but they stopped. There was a whistling noise, then another click. Movement. Fast movement.

One of them was right in front of me.

In less than a second, it was flung into the air, brought down, and had its head torn from its shoulders.

 

They immediately scattered, but not fast enough. Something large, dressed in what looked like a sun-tanned plastic cover, like a makeshift raincoat, tore through them like a rabid animal. It was like watching a hornet take on a colony of termites. It was fast, brutal, and absolutely visceral. These things screamed like stuck pigs as wings were torn, mandibles broken, thoraxes caved in, and viscera spilled. I saw one of them trying to crawl, only to be cut into two pieces and kicked off the road.

Then, as soon as it’d begun, it stopped. My flashlight had been crushed in the struggle, so I only saw the vague outline of a multi-limbed thing leaning over me. There was a flash of something metallic; perhaps a machete, or a spade. Maybe several.

“…*up*.”

It was a strange, but familiar voice. Evan. I got up, feeling my scalp burn.

“…*get him out*,” Evan said. “*I will hunt*.”

“What the… what the *fuck?!*”

I could barely form a coherent thought. Something wet patted me on the shoulder, leaving a viscera-stained mark.

“…*good luck*.”

 

And with that, he was gone. Every now and then I’d hear screaming out in the wilds, but it was distant and far-between. By the time I joined Nick. The kid was waking up. Nick forced me to sit down and take it easy; reinforcements would be there momentarily. He checked the kid out.

“You know your name?” he asked. “Your date of birth?”

The kid couldn’t focus. His head kept rolling back and forth. It was hard to tell if he was concussed, anemic, or dehydrated. Maybe all three.

“I’m… I’m Perry,” he finally said.

“Alright, good, good, we’re getting somewhere. You know what happened tonight?”

“I’m walking,” he muttered. “I’m… walking all… all year.”

 

It didn’t take long for more patrol vehicles to arrive. EMTs took the kid in. We were expected to debrief with the sheriff, but only Nick was asked to go. I had to stay behind, watching the many flashing lights fill the road. It took four guys to flip our car back, and when they did, it collapsed. Two doors fell off, and one of the wheels. Those things had mangled it beyond recognition.

“I got it from here.”

Hank Dudley was the last person I expected to see there. Hatchet Pharmaceuticals had nothing to do out here, but there he was. He’d put on a white jacket with a blue sunflower logo, and kneeled down in front of me.

“You had a really, really rough night, huh?”

“Yeah,” I said. “I did.”

“I’m gonna have the EMTs check you out, but then you’re coming with me.”

“Excuse me?”

“It’s not a question, miss. It’s what’s gonna happen.”

 

I just looked at him, baffled. He said it so matter-of-factly, like it was the most obvious thing in the world. He gave me a comforting smile.

“Miss, we’ve had your house, phone, car, wallet, and radio bugged for weeks. You don’t think we know what’s going on?”

“You… what?”

“You got a somehow stable SORE infection. You got it from Adam Salinger. That’s very important to us.”

“I’m not working with you. I’m an officer of the law.”

“No, you’re expendable,” Hank said. “And it’s already settled.”

 

He leaned in closer, looking me in the eye. His smile faded.

“You really thought you could hide this from us?” he asked. “Was that your plan?”

“You can’t do shit,” I said.

“Miss, I already have. It’s done. And you’re going away.”

He put a hand on my shoulder, but I shrugged it off. So instead, he grabbed the collar of my shirt.

“I could shoot you and have you dissected,” he continued. “But I much prefer to hear you cry.”

 

I slapped him. Didn’t matter that I was bleeding from my arm, I slapped him anyway. He got up and backed away, laughing at the top of his lungs.

“I’ll give you that one!” he laughed. “Sorry, I got cocky.”

He looked to his sides. Men with white shirts, black ties, and blue sunflower logos.

“Take her in.”

 

I got a black hood wrapped over my head. Zip strips across my wrists. I kicked and squirmed, but it was useless. Somewhere off in the background I could hear Nick screaming frantically at them to let me go, but it was too late. I was dragged off and put into a sound-proof vehicle.

And I’d be gone for a long time.
