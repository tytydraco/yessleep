Are you sure you want to read this? It's just a story, but it might change the way you think about technology forever.

It all started when me and a group of friends who are all studying web development decided to explore the dark web. We clicked links on the hidden wiki that took us further and further down the dark web until we stumbled upon a website we had never seen before that things started to get really scary. The website was dark and foreboding, filled with cryptic messages and ominous warnings. Despite our better judgment, we decided to investigate further.

As we delved deeper into the website, we uncovered a series of clues that led us to a hidden portal on the dark web. With trembling hands, we clicked the link and were transported to a sinister site we could never have imagined.

The title of the dark webpage was called “gateway www”. Most of the rest of the website was really cryptic we couldn’t really make out what most of it meant but what we could make out of it was that computers aren't just machines. They're actually gateways to demonic dimensions, and a lot of computer terminology is actually demonic codes, curses, and spells. Terminology like "demon," "summon," "internet gateways," and "portals" are all part of the dark language used to communicate with the other side.

You see, when you use a computer, you're not just tapping away at a keyboard or scrolling through your feed. You're actually opening a portal to the unknown, a gateway to the demonic realm. And every app or brand you use online is actually a sigil used to summon web servers that are really demons communicating with you through the computer screen.

Have you ever wondered why there are so many logos that seem to be just a little too clever or too complicated for their own good? It's because they're actually sigils, carefully designed to summon the web servers that are really demons.

But that's not the worst part. The worst part is that the computer screen or phone screen you're staring at isn't just a screen. It's a black mirror, a tool used by witches and warlocks for centuries to communicate with the dead and used for scrying. A practice where the black mirror allows you to see what is on the other side.

And when you look into that screen, you're not just looking at pixels and code. You're looking at the reflection of the demonic realm, a dark and twisted world filled with unspeakable horrors and unspeakable power.

We all laughed this off as we though this was a joke by some random computer nerd, or potentially a conservative religious person that truly believes technology is demonic.

But at the end of the website was a link, we decided to click on it. 

As soon as we clicked on the link, the website disappeared, and the screen went black. At first, we thought it was just a glitch, but then we noticed something strange happening on the screen.

Words began to appear, but they weren't like any language we had ever seen before. They were twisted, dark, and filled with symbols we couldn't understand. We watched in horror as the words began to swirl and dance across the screen, taking on a life of their own.

Suddenly, we heard a voice coming from the computer, a voice that was not human. It was deep and guttural, and it seemed to be coming from the depths of hell itself.

"You have been marked," the voice hissed, "And now you belong to us. We have been watching."

As the voice spoke, the computer began to shake, and the computer screen flickered with an strange light. We could feel a cold breeze blowing through the room, even though all the windows were closed.

We tried to turn off the computer, but it wouldn't respond. It was as if something was holding it captive, something we couldn't see.

And then, just as suddenly as it had begun, the shaking stopped, and the screen went black. We sat there, staring at the computer, too terrified to speak.
 
After a few minutes, we finally mustered the courage to turn it back on. To our relief, everything seemed normal. The website was gone, and the computer was working fine.

We all laughed nervously, trying to convince ourselves that it had just been a prank or a glitch. But deep down, we knew that something had happened, something that we couldn't explain.

From that day on, we never spoke of the incident again. But every time we looked at the computer, we couldn't help but wonder what else was lurking in the dark corners of the internet, waiting to be unleashed.

So be careful when you use your computer. Be careful what you type, what you click, and what you download. Because every time you do, you're opening a gateway to the unknown, and you never know what might come through.
