**The night is black without you**

**\[Sent: 3:28 am\]**

My cursor quivers over the link. It glows an electric, cancerous blue; a bruise on the screen. My laptop had begun to whirr when I received the email but now, with it open in front of me, it’s fallen still. I’m engulfed in silence, severed only by my own ragged breaths. It’s agonising.

As a high school dropout with nothing to do, I’d taken to deep-sea diving: delving to the depths of the cybersea, seeing how far I could dive, how far I could take it, losing myself in the darkest waters of the deep web. I poked at the sharks, I provoked them- I’d go in naked, without a VPN or an oxygen mask, foaming with a sick thrill whenever someone fed back my address, my age, my full name. Sometimes it even felt like I had been underwater- I’d break the surface, gasping, grinning at my reflection as my screen faded black and the threat receded like a retreating tide.

Last month I came across a shipwreck. Trawling a now defunct Japanese imageboard, I unearthed fossilised chunks of code, the decomposing skeleton of a long-lost password. But I wasn’t the first- turns out there was a whole community of us, divers fishing for information, paleontologists piecing together the bones of something ancient. 17 years isn’t that old, in reality; but online - where the tide turns like a carousel and the rip currents can drag you to the darkest depths with a single click- this was something prehistoric. It felt like it had been waiting for us.

We found a webpage, found the username, used the password and it worked; we found a trove of hidden audio files, sifted through them, found nothing but the sound of waterlogged silence; we thought we found the creator, but then we found that he’d thrown himself in front of a train in 2010. We tracked him across the clearnet and the deep-web and all the air pockets in between, until we finally found his account on an ancient music-streaming service, existing transiently in archived pages across the Internet- nomoon on Clearvoice. jp, account description- an email address. The same one blinking up at me now.

When we all received the same email, the others labelled it a scam, spyware, a trojan horse. A few people said they were going to click it- but nobody’s posted any screenshots yet. I think they’re all scared, waiting for someone else to take the first plunge. They’re lucky, because tonight I feel like swimming.

I click the link.

My screen goes black- glows white- my laptop screams like a harpooned fish, the CD port ejecting with the violence of a dislocated bone. Red floods my screen- my vision swims with gaping wounds, like my laptop’s been slashed by a butcher’s knife. But no, these are pictures- digital recreations of desperation, a grid of skin, each centimetre sliced with the same bloody symbol drawn with a knife. A semicircle, crossed through with an X, repeated a hundred times across metres of flesh.

Text wells up on the screen.

**\[Tickets are free for the worthy\]**

I stare at my screen; at the webcam, blinking at me with its red eye, awakened. Then I look over at my chest of drawers. I think about my stash of used razor blades. I stand up.

5 minutes later, I’m holding a wafer-thin slice of sharpened metal over my wrist and searching for skin. Techno blared from my phone, the tinny scrape of an electronic beat blinding me, soothing me, sandpapering the sharp edges of reality, and the blade. Are my forearms too obvious? Or does it need to be visible? I look up at my webcam for help, but it just stares back, unwavering.

I decide on my right hip, the silvery-pale skin stretched taut over the jutting bone. I hover the blunt blade over my body, trying to ignore the blueish strand of vein, pulsing like a hyperlink, barely beneath the skin. Trying to ignore the trembling of my fingers, as if reflected in a rippling pool of water. A semicircle and a cross, a semicircle and a cross… I turn the music up, hold my breath, and plunge the blade into my skin.

Rancid pain erupts instantly- I howl out between chewed knuckles. Panting, I dig the razorblade deeper into my flesh, puncturing layers of skin as the music pierces my eardrums like a vaccine. I grit my teeth and turn it up louder, dragging the blade in a jagged semicircle. The blood is pouring now: it’s on the blade, smeared up and down my stomach, on my fingertips, I can even taste it on my tongue, a pulpy mess, bitten through. I’m almost hyperventilating as I carve out those final lines. Cross, cross. X marks the spot.

Beneath my playlist and my heaving breaths, I hear the isolated thump if a single beat boom out from my laptop. I hear the sound of something fleshy and ripe rip, tearing into 2 pieces, the slow growl of severed meat- then a beam of bone-white light slices through my eyelids and my head erupts with a hummin bassline of pain. With one hand over my eyes and the other plastered over my wound, I crawl towards my laptop; the screen is burning with a blazing white, seeping out like lava. But that’s just a border, I realise- in the centre of the screen there’s a video playing, an aerial view of a festival field, people flitting across the midnight screen like small, shrunken moths. The resolution is so clear I can almost smell the scene, the scent of bodies and smoke, the sweet blossom of the dew-damp grass. I reach out, reverently, to push back the screen, soak it all in- and my hand phases through the screen like it’s an open window.

I leap backwards, swearing, scrabbling over the carpet, smearing my blood across the floor. My screen is pulsing, pouring out lights and aromas as heavy as liquid; come and see me, that’s what it said, but I’d assumed it meant hopping from island to island, just a swift paddle across the cybersea- but now I’m sitting here, in a sweat-stained t-shirt and bloody tracksuit bottoms, in front of a portal.

I can’t remember exactly when I started deep-sea diving- was it after I got pushed down the science block stairs, or the day I came home with a broken nose? A swimming pool in my pocket, accessing the ocean from the comfort of my bedroom, enough music and media to submerge yourself entirely, uninhibited, to view reality- mum’s head in her hands in the headteacher’s office, a yearbook missing a name, new school shoes glinting on my bed, after the last 3 pairs were stolen- from behind the lens of a gently rippling layers of translucent water. Maybe I’ve always wanted to drown. *The night is black without you.*

**The night is black without you.**

I stand up. I push my laptop screen as far back as it will go. I wipe the gore from my palms, run a hand through my hair. I scrawl out a text to my mum- gone nightswimming, might be a while- close my eyes, lift one foot over the gaping hole in reality, and plunge.

When I open my eyes again I’m splayed out on a bed of grass. Breathing thinly, I’m battered, a beached boat, churned up and dazed.

I drag myself to my feet, drinking in my surroundings. Although there’s grass beneath my feet and a swooping midnight sky above my head, I could easily be standing on the seabed: the field stretches out endlessly on every side, no barriers or buildings in sight, and the sapphire sky soaks everything in a wash of navy, even the grass, now the colour of whale-skin.

The field is flooded with people: men and girls, women and boys, those old enough to recall the Internet’s invasion into everyday life alongside those who have never been out of reach of a bluetooth device, dressed in miniskirts or pajamas or suits. I search for the symbol, find it on some- mainly on forearms, exposed thighs and stomachs, but I even see it carved into people’s hands, their knees; one woman even has it chiseled into her forehead, and she stumbles forward blindly, blinking droplets of blood out of her eyes as casually as a slipped contact lens.

There’s people chatting as they walk, clumped in small shoals or in pairs, flitting between the stalls that float across the grass, simple wooden structures setting out the trail, hemming us in, carving up the crowd like sharks slicing up quivering masses of fish. Most of them are abandoned, but behind a few there are empty-eyes men and dazed-looking women, their stagnant bodies draped in faded school uniforms. I watch as a woman in a nightdress asks one of them for some water, then retreats at his dead-eyed stare and saliva-slick jaw.

I crane my neck back to snatch a glance at him, but already I can feel the rip current dragging me along, the crowd heaving ahead, towards the sole source of light illuminating the field- the stage, a booming beacon of electrical light, blaring out a savage techno bassline like a mating call.

It’s a mile away at least- I haven’t walked that far in years, but instantly, I’m drawn to it, just another crab in the bucket. Come and see me… with waves of sound scouring through me, I join the crowd’s staggering march, chasing the high of the music.

I’ve only stumbled a few steps forward when I see her, her dark mass of curls tangling itself in the tepid breeze. As she scrapes it back from her face, the fin-like peaks of her cheekbones surface as if emerging from a pool of water, the contours of her skull visible beneath the scaled layers of skin and concealer. The eyes that track the crowd from the edge of the path are wide, rimmed with thick, spiked lashes, her pupils eroded into pinpricks, by some secreted poison scorching her blood. Something wild swirls in her irises, and I’m reminded of bioluminescent sea creatures, shimmering sequins whorling just beneath the surface. She has marionette’s arms- sharp jolts of bone, twists of pale knuckle, ankles and wrists straining from the flesh like shackles. She’s not skeletal- there are ropey deposits of unravelled muscle at her arms and stomach- but it’s as if her bones have simply outgrown her body, her skin left scrambling to shear the vulgar thrust of her pelvis, the careless lurch of her collarbones. She sports a low denim skirt and a purple blouse, revealing a white slice of sunken breast and the knot of her ribcage. And on her left hip, bleeding freely and carved out in a haphazard slash, I spot the exact same symbol that’s etched onto my right.

When I glance back at her face I realise she’s grinning at me, waving me over to her side of the trail. When she lifts her arms I notice the 2 scars scoured down the softest part of her inner arm, from wrist to elbow, the healed tissue glinting like shattered shards of pearl in the half-light.

“The tattoo.” She whispers as soon as I’m beside her. She speaks softly, quickly, her words warped by her white-rapid grin. “You’ve seen it before?” She spits the syllables out like chips of driftwood, with the candied jubilance of cherry pips.

My reply lodges in my throat- I was never very good at speaking to girls, and beneath her churning gaze my throat seems to have shrunken to the size of a paper straw.

“Never.” I manage to choke out, and she nods eagerly. “Are you here from clearvoice?” I manage to ask, expecting another twitching nod, but instead her smile swirls into a circle of teeth and she echoes back,

“Clearvoice?”

There’s no way she wouldn’t remember the name- we searched for that website for days.

“You know- the email.”

“The email?”

Again, my words are reflected, luke sea water crashing back from the shore.

“You didn’t get it?” I ask, and she shakes her head, smiling distantly, smoothing back her curls with an arm decorated by death.

“Everyone’s here from the album, aren’t they?”

Her smile uncurls something dark inside my stomach. Across all of those hours, across all of those webpages, I never heard anything, anything at all, about an album.

I suppose that was the first time I thought about how vast the Internet truly is, the colossal size of all of those interconnected threads that never touch, how 2 scuba divers may submerge themselves at the same time and never see another soul on their side of the ocean.

Before I can ask what she’s talking about, she’s already exposed to me a pale prism of skin as she cranes her neck up to stare at the sky, to observe the sprawling inverted ocean with her strangled pupils.

“I wonder if they were lying.” She murmurs.

“About what?”

“No Moon.” She points up at the Heavens, the desolate stretch of sapphire foaming with a sealskin scum of clouds. The pulsating surge of light pouring from the stage pollutes the sky, so that the moon, let alone the flickering whisper of the stars, is indecipherable, a sunken body in the cosmic sea, just another shipwreck. “It’s impossible to tell, so we’ll never know if that song was a lie, after all.”

She lets her hand tumble like a sinking star and turns to smile at me, but it’s brittle, like a shard of broken porcelain. I can picture her flashing this same smile across bars and raves and concert crowds, the flashing lights concealing the cracks in her grin and the desperate push of her bones from her skin, trawling the depths for her next high, allowing anyone to escape into herself on her rush to escape herself, and all I want to do is forget I ever met her, this distorted mirror of my own desire to drown.

“Are you a lunatic as well?” She asks me, but the truth lodges itself in my throat and I can no longer speak.

We rejoin the crowd, slipping back into the shoal. She whispers her name in my ear as we swim through the twilight- June- but by the time I tell her mine I’m forced to shout over the pounding techno beat. We’ll be reaching the stage in minutes, and already the music has peeled apart my ribcage and is pulsating inside of me like a parasitic heart, the flood-lights soaking our bodies in a gnashing white foam. More and more stalls have sprung up on the grass, closer and closer, creating a bottleneck, and June clamps my hand in hers as she cleaves through the crowd, through the mass of bodies on every side. It’s a sweat drenched scramble of knees, fists and elbows, as we dodge the glasses of lurid green liquid thrust into the throng by the anemic hands of the stall workers. Reanimated from their stupor, now they’re fixated on feeding us as many reeking cocktails as they can.

A voice attached to a hand grasping a tumbler of bleach-scented liquid hooks my attention- I look up and come face to face with the past.

“Wait- Eric, is that-”

“Micheal!” Eric’s narrow face erupts into a jagged grin above me. It’s a sharpened, stretched version of the smile I used to see, in flashes, on his face during our lessons together in high school: warped, like a twisted curl of driftwood.

“Eric, what are you doing here?” I yell over the music. He just laughs, a bark of rough sound that becomes just another bubble in the drowning wave of sound around us.

“It’s amazing, isn’t it?” He crows. His voice is thinner than I remember, wavering, as if his vocal chords have been pulled taut. “The music just envelops you and you can’t think of anything else!”

“But, Eric-” I try to interrupt him, but there’s a blind sheen to his eyes and his tongue keeps twitching, side to side, like an insect trapped in the cage of his jaw. “You’re not supposed to be here-”

“Why would I miss out on this?” He yelps back. “Working at the biggest show of all time!”

He rakes a hand through his hair, but to me it’s as disembodied as a flesh-coloured mosquito, a spasming insect fat with memories, of those lunches we spent together, our desperate band of castaways in the ICT room, marooned by our peers.

“No… you shouldn’t be here, can’t you remember what happened?” I bellow, but it’s as if I’m swimming against a churning current of madness. I watch his eyes glazing, glazing over, as he takes a swig from some sort of poured poison clamped in a glass in his fist.

“Why don’t you have a drink? And we can forget all that stuff in the past… hey, what about your friend? Want a drink?” He flings the drink at June and she knocks it back before I can stop her. She glances at me with a guilt smile, her pupils pulsing slightly.

“Listen to me.” I snap. It’s becoming harder and harder to hear myself over the din- is it getting louder? Or is that blood, pounding in my ears? “You can’t be here.”

“Why?” There’s a flash of foreign fury in his snarl, darkening the starved whites of his eyes; I can’t remember Eric ever getting angry, even after what happened in that last PE lesson together. “Because I wasn’t popular in high school?” He babbles. “ Because I got laughed at? Because I got pushed around? Because nobody liked us-”

“No,” I scream. “You shouldn’t be here because you killed yourself 3 years ago!”

I watch as Eric’s face collapses into itself. June retches beside me- I feel a splatter of something hot on my shoulder. There’s blood on her hands.

For a moment, Eric’s there, standing in front of me, the agony of reality etched into his face- but then I blink and he’s gone, just a blank patch of night, an individual eroded. As simple as closing a tab or refreshing a page- sucked underwater again by the rip current. There’s a lurch in my brain and already I can feel my memory slipping- which class was I in when I found out, was I even in school- did I go to the funeral? How did he do it? Did I try-

“Mike, what happened? What’s wrong?” June asks but I turn away, unable to face her gaze. Unwillingly to dive beneath the surface of myself, even for a moment. I focus on the music, let it drill into my skull, anaesthetise me.

And then we’re swimming again, aligned with the shoal, sinking deeper and deeper and deeper into the music. The beat is pounding now, I can feel its throbbing pulse within my bones, inside my brain, like I’m balancing on the artery of some colossal beast. And the light- it’s inescapable, it comes crashing over us like a tsunami and drenches us in a blinding, radioactive white, that stains our hands and eye socket the colour of frozen skin. There’s people everywhere, the horizon clogged by pushing, pulsating bodies; the skyscraper stage is looming, looming, and we’re cascading towards it.

I’m waiting for a crescendo that never comes, gasping for air, crushed between bodies, there’s congealing blood between my teeth and- June shoves my head up and I see it. I see the stage in all its glory. Finally, I can see who’s performing there.

It’s a mermaid. A mermaid made of wires.

Like a crystal or chemical, she’s a living refraction of light, a beaming tower of silver, the image of salvation, an angel. The light pours out from her eyes, her gaping mouth, she embodies its brilliance- the pearl scales of her tail and wired hair aglow with stolen moonlight. Music spills from her glowing hands, she’s suspended in an ocean of sound, the thrum of a thousand shimmering tails. I can feel myself reaching for her, straining to sink into her light, I want to drown in her melody, I want to submerge myself forever in her shimmering gears.

Beside me, June’s eyes are blind with wonder.

“There’s so much… enough for an eternity…” She whispers. Tears stream down her face, and when I look into her eyes I see a very different type of joy reflected there. Not my mermaid, but instead gleaming heaps of the heaven she finds in little plastic bags.

And then I stare into the eyes of those around me, at the different escapes reflected in each.

And then I look not at what’s on the stage but at what’s beneath it, the clashing jaws concealed by the music, the red wave already soaking my feet.

And then I turn to June, her eyes flooded with a tsunami of artificial light, grab her scarred arms and turn her towards the sky behind us.

“Look, June- they were lying. It’s still there.”

Somehow, the sky has cleared and the Moon has returned, a dull sphere of the night emerging from the sapphire. June spins to face me and I watch her eyes drain of the poisonous light, her astounded face as reality hits.

*The night is black without you.*

Then the Moon falls from the sky and flies towards us, I’m enveloped in gold and then I’m back in my room, gasping for air.

I’m typing this all from my phone, before I fall asleep. It’s almost morning now and the sunrise is already here, just behind my curtain. I’m exhausted, but I don’t want to forget anything. I won’t let myself escape my memories this time around.

I keep thinking of June, her face before the Moon caved in. Perhaps I’ll be able to find her some day, online or in real life. I’m praying that we’re from the same universe, to whatever God can remember her face.

My laptop was fried on the way up. Right now it’s slumped in the corner of my room, beside the razor blades and my clothes from last night, ready for the bin. I won’t lie and say I’m upset. All I know is that I don’t think I’ll be going diving again anytime soon.
