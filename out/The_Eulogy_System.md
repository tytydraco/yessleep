 “Well, this is a nifty bit of kit Ted, this is going to help a fair few people, well done chap!” Mr Long ruffled my hair as he walked back to dressing the body for that afternoon’s funeral at the crematorium. I was used to being his right hand man with these jobs but I had fallen into a bit of luck. I now work for myself , aspiring to go further in tech and research further into Ai systems so thought I’d make a bit of money before going back to university , hence I invented this programme , the eulogy system. During my days of working here, whenever I would talk to families of lost loved ones some people would say they struggle to put their grief and remembrance in a summary while others simply couldn’t find the words. So I thought, hey, if I can relieve that stress of such a difficult time for some families then I believe I am bringing something good into this world. By using some simple prompts and direction, maybe throwing in an odd memory or feeling alongside some simple information about the deceased, the system was able to formulate a sensible, meaningful passage which caught the attention of my old boss Mr Long. Which brings me to here, we now offered a service alongside the funeral cost at no extra charge, but it means I’m getting 10% of the funeral cost afterwards as part of my commission if it is used and with prices today I turn a tidy profit.

However , I think the system is starting to , well , I don’t really know but I don’t know how to stop it , anyway I digress let me explain. Also, to protect the Identities of our deceased clients I shall only be using first names and nothing more, despite the circumstances it doesn’t feel right exposing them.

I had spent 2 months here, rocked up to work like any other day. The funeral home was situated inside an old butchers shop with wide open windows no longer displaying selections of meat but a selection of coffins and flowers. Yellow sand brick faded over time leaving behind a sickly brown colour in need of a power wash that will never come. An oak door gave way into our reception area, the smell of cheap air freshener and formaldehyde hit you like a freight train as soon as you came through the door. Furniture either taken straight from a nursing home or modern enough to think it was from some stylist boutique, a confusing clash of time indeed. The lad who was doing my old job sat behind the desk, Errol, was scrolling through reels without a care as the volume was just a touch too loud. Something about listening to “Top ten Horror movie actors who suspiciously died in real life” or another urban exploring haunted locations didn’t sit right with me in this setting and found it somewhat inappropriate but Eh, Errol seemed nice enough.

“Morning Errol lad, you okay?”

“Shit” Errol threw his phone onto the desk and snapped to attention, indicating to me that he may have got a blocking of Mr Long for being on his phone already. “Morning Ted lad how are you mate? See the footy last night?”

 

“Yeah was a surprising draw to be fair, been a decent season for us so far but I know it’ll turn to shite next week as we usually do”

We both chuckled as I carried on into the back while Errol picked up his phone as unsubtly as possible. We never had loads to talk about but I seemed to find the only other Toffees fan in this town so at least we somewhat bonded over that.

I plonked myself down in my little makeshift office, not disturbing Mr Long as he was on a call to clients but did give me a delicate wave as I went past and opened my laptop. I whacked in the password and opened the programme to what I was expecting the blank prompt screen, however I was met with a fully written eulogy that had already been sent through to print. Odd. Very Odd. Must have been a Glitch in its system so I picked the paper out of the printer with a bit of a tug as it was an old crappy printer to read this:

“Alex was an odd bloke

Died doing what he loved, swimming

Such a shame the electrics system above fried and broke

As it fell in the water leaving nothing but smoke.”

 

What the hell? Don’t get me wrong it’s quite the rhyme but I never put this prompt in, nor had we had any Alex’s on our client list. What was even stranger it listed his death as today? Its highly unusual we would have something written up for the deceased that soon so I just put it down to a system fault and restarted the programme , thought little of it and chucked the paper in the bin. Low and behold the original blank screen was presented to me I was able to start inputting some info for the days funerals along with trying to figure out if this morning’s quip was a bug or glitch. The morning flew by and it was eventually time for lunch and kicked my legs up onto the desk and got out my phone to browse socials. I very quickly lost my appetite shortly after opening up Facebook and reading a news bulletin from our local council’s page.

Leisure centre forced to close today following very unfortunate accident in pool area today – more details will be released my police in coming hours

Additionally power in business area linked with leisure centre is down awaiting maintenance, apologise from croft cuts, Pemberton logistics centre and the Bear trap café.

 

My heart sank, surely this is just a massive coincidence. Yes. Had to be. Two unrelated articles with nothing to do with each other, an ounce of doubt still sat heavy in my mind as I closed social media and got on with the day. A slow day none the less which was unfortunate for me as it allowed me to dwell on the incident at the pool, I thought about going over to the bin a few times to get out the crumpled bit of paper but I couldn’t, instead I threw it into the incinerator in the crematorium next door and thought nothing more of it.

The next day rolled round and I walked to work as my car had decided to give up and die in my drive, leaving me to walk the mile and a half to work in the beautiful British weather we know as rain. I wish it was a light drizzle but it was the type of thin drizzle that soaked you to the bone and hit your face like tiny knives leaving microscopic slices behind. I came in through the door to the lobby to be met by Errol loudly playing some sort of shooting game on his phone.

Without looking up “Morning Ted you alright mate , raining outside today so I’d avoid walking out if your grabbing lunch from Tesco later”

“Yeah thanks for the heads up, much appreciated” I sarcastically replied and all I got from Errol was a quick thumbs up as his gaze did not divert from the screen. I put my things down in the office once more, tapped in the password and I was reluctant to open the programme at first, but as soon as I did a hand placed firmly on my shoulder. I can’t lie this did take me by surprise so I jolted in my seat in panic and spun round to meet Mr Long.

“Morning Ted hope your-“ he removed his hand from my shoulder examining it and continuing “Christ Ted your soaking , have a seat in the Incinerator room in a sec , its warm in there so you should dry quickly” . I nodded as he sighed and said in more of a whispered tone “listen Ted , we have a delicate case coming in soon and the family seem reluctant to cooperate with much as their grief is too heavy so you might have to work your magic with the system to come up with something tangible”

“Sure thing, I can try my best but it may not work as well with limited information but as I said I can only try”

“Brill, thank you Ted, guys names Alex, avid swimmer and family man, bit of an introvert, collected different cricket balls from….” Mr Long’s words became distorted and muffled as the colour began to drain from my face and I began to physically shake. Mr Long waved his hand in front of my face questioning “Hello? Ted you in there? You look a bit peaky lad, go get warm and I can provide your old uniform to wear for today” he handed me over a bundled collection of a white dress shirt, black suit and long deep blue tie, I was about to leave when the printer made a horrendous churning and grunting sound as it squeezed out another bit of paper, I took it out and with me to the crematorium and sat opposite the incinerator, a warm hug of heat tried to comfort me as I read:

 

Soph was quiet, never caused trouble of fuss

She was quite dull but my god could she bake

Till one day she went out and was hit by a bus

And now she’s as flat as a pancake

 

Once more I Panicked and realised the time was stamped as well as todays date and the time indicated was in half hour. Instantly I threw the paper into the fire and tried to block it out. Surprisingly I was most concerned at how jovial these glitches seemed, no compassion or care but as if someone found it funny like some sick joke. After a moment of contemplation I whipped out my phone and started looking for bus times, maybe this wasn’t a glitch and maybe I could stop it? I scrolled through different times and bus routes trying to find one that met the half hour space I had. I must have been looking much longer than I thought as I heard I violent screech and commotion from outside. I smartened up quickly slotting the wrong buttons into the wrong holes and throwing my tie on messily as I ran. Outside was a sight so grizzly I shuffled back and was sick in the large flower pot just outside the Crematorium, a beautiful rainbow of colour now turned a sandy beige with pops of carrot and sweetcorn. I am reluctant to go into the detail of what happened but I can assure you nothing about it resembled a pancake. The side of the green bus now pebble dashed with red. I was too late.

The street was blocked off and luckily all funerals that day were transferred to our sister location about 5 miles away so I was glad these families were not put out. Mr Long sent myself and Errol home and I’m happy he did or I would have had to have taken sick leave. I sat at home that night feeling responsible for something too grand and consistent to just be coincidence. In the panic I’d left my laptop at work so was unable to do anything now to stop it so I just sat up and waited for the next day to roll round so I could shut it down. I sat in my armchair for what seemed like hours watching as the deep blue sky leaked into purple, pink, orange until my alarm went off. I was still fully dressed and sleep deprived so made a black coffee in my travel mug to go. I rocked up outside and saw the nothing left but the tire marks from yesterday , everything else was back to normal and if you hadn’t of known would of thought someone had just been a bit heavy on the breaks. I walked in and must have been early as Errol was nowhere to be seen and Mr Long was in his office eating a bowl of cornflakes without a shirt on. I knew things were bad at home and just hope he hadn’t been kicked out and was sleeping here , I felt to awkward to ask and he would have been too ashamed if he had noticed me so thought it’d be wise not to bring attention. I paused as I entered the office to see that several had been printed out all with times already passed which I began to get frustrated by knowing that it was my fault, I shouldn’t have been so careless leaving it all hooked up still. However the last one made me pause for a moment:

We a gathered here to remember Mary

She was good and kind hearted every day and all night

However what happened to her was quite scary

When she was hit by bricks from great height   

 

Time stamped for 45 minutes time.

I racked my brain thinking of what I could do to save her as there was a chance, slim but a definite chance. It glared at me like a sick riddle till an idea popped into my head. They were renovating the Isaiah Hotel on the other side of town after the roof caved in following a storm. It was about a 30 minute run so I dropped the pile of paper and ran. I was wearing my brown slip on brogues so I just knew it was going to leave some blisters but the pain of those would not surpass the pain I would inevitably feel if I was responsible for yet another travesty. I ran faster than I thought my legs were able to carry me. I’m a portly gentleman so the fact I was able to run like this was a minor miracle, I had to stop every five minutes or so to take a strained puff of my inhaler before starting again. I felt the reverberations shoot up my legs into the rest of my body which made me feel painfully unwell. I reached the hotel and looked up to see it was enrobed with scaffolding and people either standing around sipping cans of monster or hurling bricks around , precariously near the top I saw a pile of bricks organised like a tiny red pyramid. It looks like I had arrived in the nick of time as walking below I saw a younger woman , headphones in without a care in the world walking directly below.

“MARY! LOOK OUT!” I started to run across the road to her, soon as she clocked on to me she looked in disgust as this big stranger hurtled towards her shouting her name.

“Aww get away from me you bloody weirdo!” she ran off in the other direction. Not the response I thought I’d get after saving her life, not that she knew what was planned. Behind me I heard the bricks fall followed by an “Ash Greg you fucking idiot, what have I said about leaving them there, someone could have been killed!”

 

I made my way back to the funeral parlour, sweating and panting as I Tumbled through the door. Still no sign of Errol. I must admit I felt smug, I found out a way to beat the system and now it was time to shut it down till I could find what was wrong with it. My smugness quickly depleted when I saw my screen up with the programme on, it simply read:

“You shouldn’t have done that, Ted”

An Ice cold shiver ran up my spine after reading those words, I didn’t have too much time to dwell in the fear though as the printer slipped out another bit of paper:

 

Errol was complicated, like a game of chess

He was destined for greatness, we would have raised a cup

Till stupid Ted stepped in and made a great mess

His surgery didn’t go to plan today, so he’ll never wake up

 

I froze. My stomach turned and sank. My heart followed too. What have I done?

 

The phone began to ring from Mr Long’s office, confirming the news I had just read. I sat at my desk and sobbed. This was all my fault, I’ve created this mess and I needed to stop it. Through tears I went back on my laptop and tried tirelessly to shut it down but, I couldn’t. I was met with obstacles and barriers of which I’d never seen , code which I hadn’t written and hope that was slowly grinded down to nothing by the end of the day , I failed , I just disconnected it and stuck it in my bag , at least now it wasn’t connected to the printer.

 

Some time had passed and even today Mr Long asks when the system would be back up and running, to which I tell him that I was still experiencing bugs with it, and with Errol’s absence I found myself slipping into my old role anyway so didn’t have time to tinker with it, not that I wanted to, to be honest. It was surreal seeing Errol in the place our clients would lie on that table, dressed in a beautiful pressed suit and football scarf I gifted to him to take with him to the next place. His family would come in too from time to time just to be with him. We wouldn’t normally let families come in as much as they did but we made an exception. I visited their home from time to time bringing flowers or just to keep his parents a bit of company which I think they appreciated. The new hire had started today and was using my makeshift office as they were doing more admin work for us too. A sweet young woman straight from college, Lyra. She was completely new to any of this but seemed to be quite on it with wanting to learn and get involved. However, as I write this I wish she wasn’t so enthusiastic.  She approached me near the end of shift –

“Hey Ted , fab day thank you so much for being so helpful I really appreciate it ! Random one I know, I found a laptop in there and thought ‘score!’ so I hooked it up and well… Well come have a quick look”

My vision went blurry and I could feel sick begin to bubble up from my stomach knowing exactly what she found. Open on the screen was the programme I tried so hard to destroy. I had a small fleeting feeling of relief when there was nothing on the screen, this feeling did not last long though as I saw there was a printed piece of paper, on the floor that had fallen from the printed tray. With shaky clammy hands I picked it up and held it up so I was able to see. Through welled up shaky vision I saw the words:

 

Tick Tock Ted.
