There was a man in the lobby I’d never expected to be there. He wore a fancy, expensive looking suit, smoked a large looking cigar, and typed something into a phone halfheartedly.

The reason he surprised me was a congressman. Jim Algore Millisk. A staunch supporter of human rights, activist against global warming, and a great speaker on peace.

This guy was the opposite of what you’d call controversial. And I’m a literal criminal, so I’d never expected to see him in *my* lobby.

My name is Quentin Lorreno. I’m somewhat of a middleman in the criminal underworld. I mediate the crime families, I arrange diplomatic marriages, I keep things civil.

But above all I host auctions. Art is a tastefully wonderful medium of laundering money, and hosting both underworld- and legal auctions is kind of my speciality.

And I also recover and sell cursed artifacts.

So when a congressman, a widely uncontroversial one, walked into my lobby I was both concerned, confused, and bewildered. But business, even in the artifact black market, was business, so I’d deal with him either way.

I concluded my meeting with my client and stepped out to greet the man waiting in the lobby.

“Hello, I’m Quentin Lorreno,” I introduced, extendenting a hand. He shook it, and gave me his trademarked ‘freedom smile’. “What brings you to the Lorreno Auction House?”

He tensely looked around then, eyeing my coworkers- my assistant Steven, my two security agents (Matt and Aster), and then back at me. “I have something,” he picked up a large looking briefcase covered in leather from the floor, “you may be interested in.”

I sighed, “I’ve got no time for political brochures or data papers here. This place isn’t exactly what you’d call, *legal, but you didn’t hear that from me.*” I really emphasized the last part. “You are, Jim Millisk, yes?”

“This is true,” he informed. “Can we talk in your office? I think this would really concern you.”

Now things were getting interesting. He was no ordinary congressman, I could see that now. There was a certain air of confidence by the way he spoke, something old fashioned, and it seemed too old for his age.

I beckoned for him to follow, entered my little office, and took a seat. “Sit, please,” I gestured to the sofa.

“Ah, not now,” he replied. “But let me show you what I have to offer.”

With that he opened his mouth, lifted a hand and plunged in inside his throat, searching around for something.

Now, in my line of work, I was used to seeing the intense and bizarre, but the spontaneity of the action happened so fast I could barely process it. But after ten seconds or so he produced a key, practically stabbed it into the briefcase, and opened it.

Laid in plush velvet reds and encased in glass was a rib. “What’s this?”

“The rib of St. Paul,” Jim informed, smiling a smile a bit too wide for my liking. “I hear a client of yours has been collecting them.”

This was a misinterpretation. “Saint Paul the Apostle?” I asked, confused. I had a very rich client who was indeed collecting the ribs of a saint named Paul. “You misunderstand- my client is interred in the bones of St. Paul the Oracle.”

Paul the Oracle was a completely different guy. Completely different storyline I don’t have time to explain. “This is the bones of the Oracle,” Congressman Jim insisted. “You can even have your *Canary* inspect it, if you have one.”

Canary- those able to sense and validate sources of mysticism, power, and oddity. “I have one,” I answered. I cracked the door open and called for Aster.

She entered the office soon after, bewildered. “Is that Congressman Millisk?” The congressman nodded and shrugged.

I asked her if the Oracle bone was legitimate. She reached out and touched it. Her eyes went fiery for a second, and she nodded, confirming. “*Dr. Gilmore’s* going to pay a fortune for this.”

“Aster, no names, come on!” I reminded. I turned to the client. “So what’s your price?”

“Do not panic,” he began, “but to understand, I must remove my clothes.” And before we could say another word, Jim Millisk of the U.S Congress tore at his chest and- *removed his skin.*

His stretchy skin, hair and face moved rapidly, and he threw it over his head as simple as one might pull off a T-Shirt, and by then end of it we were left face to face staring at a scaly, reddish-brown beast with a frilled, chameleon-like head.

Our mouths both gaped open. In essence he was a-

“*Lizardman?!*” Aster gasped.

“I am a *Stetski,*” he corrected, gesturing around wildly, as if he had expected us to already know. “You know, some consider Lizardman to be a slur.” Two tongues leaped from his jaws, and he breathed in air, relieved. “You do not know how hot skinsuits can get!”

I had heard tales of the Stetski Peoples. They, on Earth were few in number, but their cunning wit and penchant for science gave them great power. I’d only encountered a few, but found that were not to be trifled with.

Especially Stetski Crime Families. Now that was one thing I wouldn’t miss.

“So what do you want, and this better be good,” I decided. “Last time I messed with a Stetski I lost three crates worth of artifacts.”

“I don’t come from a Stetski Gang- by the way, my name isn’t Jim, it's Ta’a’Ka’Ni’. Actually, call me Jim.” He laughed at that, shrill and piercing. It wasn’t that funny. “No, I’m actually a Prior in the Stetski Confederacy. There’s a fracking site I need destroyed, and you people seem excellent for the job.”

“You want us to destroy a fracking site?” I inquired, confused. Fracking, the use of pumping poisonous chemicals into the Earth to create cracks in the ground and used to quickly extract oil was not one I’d ever imagine getting into. “Why?”

Jim extracted a map from his throat, and pointed to somewhere in the middle of Texas. “A *Natum* sleeps there, underground.”

Now, I understood.

Natum’s were the hive colonies of the Stetski. Their people evolved and gained civilization more than 12,000 years ago- but the Ice Age forced them into hibernation. Only a few Stetski had been awoken, and when they found human society, they opted to merely wait us out and reclaim the earth when, as they claimed, “Global Warming forced us out”.

Global Warming would also trigger the Stetski’s Natum chambers into awakening, so the time of Stetski-Human coexistence was growing near.

There would be conflict, and as a result, the Stetski in human government uncharacteristically opposed Global Warming.

Now, the fracking site, if it remained, would no doubt discover the Natum, and as Jim explained, would poison the Natum, massacring over a hundred thousand Stetski.

And no doubt, this would lead to war.

“I understand,” I murmured, extending a hand. “I accept this offer.” I asked why he couldn’t do it. Jim explained that the Stetski were undergoing a massive political upheaval, and the site had barely been noticed.

And so we shook on it, stood, and Jim started to put his suit back on.

This is when Matt, my other security agent charged into my office, gun in hand, slamming Jim across the face and pinning him against the wall. A lamp knocked over, nearly breaking, and so did a number of good-luck charms that would certainly be ruined.

Matt had this look of rage on his face. “Are we working with a *Lizardman,* sir?!” he snapped, looking at me and tightened his chokehold on Jim.

Jim hissed. “Okay, first of all, that’s literally a slur.” Aster shushed him.

“Lizardmen killed my brother,” Matt growled. “They’re all violent freaks, the lot of them. Or do you forget our last few encounters with the *Stetka’i Family?*”

The choke hold was clearly having no effect on Jim. “Okay, first of all, that’s a hasty generalization- don’t be a bigot. Not all of us are violent, you know.” Jim looked around for help, but I didn’t know what to do. “Most of us play pretty passive roles in the scientific community, and most of us really enjoy art. I personally have even switched to an all-vegetarian diet.”

This only seemed to enrage Matt more. “Lies. I’m sure you Lizardmen government impersonators want to destroy us all.”

I decided to act. “Matt, put him down,” I ordered. I looked sharply into his eyes, and he did. “If you haven’t seen the news- Jim’s actually *against* climate change. And for God’s Sakes, stop being racist.”

“We are *Stetski,*” Jim reminded. “Great Keon, Coolidge was nicer than you and he lived in the 1920s.”

Matt looked at Aster next. “You agree with this? Are we really gonna be working for a Liz- er, Stetski?”

Aster shrugged. “I dated a Stetski once, you know. Very artful people, very potent.”

“Exactly!” Jim cheered. “I’ll be leaving now.” And Jim put his fleshy skin back on and walked out.

“Aster, Matt, we’re doing this,” I announced. “I’ll have Steven book us tickets and the four of us will leave tomorrow. And Matt- despite what you think, the Stetski aren’t all bad.”

“If…” he mumbled something I couldn’t decipher, “if you say so.”

I sighed as I dismissed them. I called Steven over, and sent him off to deal with tickets and a spell to get us through airport security. I had other things to manage, and I decided on contacting the client who wanted the rib.

We settled on a more than fair price, and that was the moment I truly decided on the mission.

Steven frolicked in an hour later, showing the tickets and handing me our luggage, then casting his spells on it. I always made it a point to actually witness the spellcast since my last caster betrayed me and left me in the middle of the Paris Catacombs.

The day passed, I went to sleep, and the next morning found myself on a plane with the team, each of us studying the maps and what photographs were available.

By a quarter to noon we were in the middle of Nowhere, Texas, hidden among a brush of trees, binoculars looking at the site from a distance.

Whatever company responsible had only begun construction. There were a few security guards, but the majority were construction workers and a half a dozen geologists.

“Steven, what’s the plan,” I asked.

“I’ll cast *Veil* on us, and then we sneak in.” He took a few squares of something and handed it. “This is Ecto-Bomb. Highly dangerous, but I’ve enchanted it not to damage the living- we stick it all over, leave, and watch it go boom.”

I nodded. Steven always got things done. I turned to Aster next. “Can you verify the Natum?”

She reached out into the ether and goosebumps emerged. “Yeah, thousands, more- I can feel their minds, dreaming, sleeping.” We hadn’t been tricked- we were there.

I was about to tell Steven to cast and move when Matt raised a hand. “Wait,” he pointed, and I looked through my binoculars. There was a Stetski, flanked by two guards being moved from tent to trailer. “You think he’s captured?”

“Yeah,” I nodded. “Edit the plan- me and Aster will free the Stetski- Matt, Steven, you know what to do.”

Steven cast the spell, and a feeling of nausea and euphoria washed over me. We could see one another, but the site wouldn’t be able to.

The journey down was painless, and very soon we were in the midst, walking past unsuspecting workers and employees. We split soon, I and Aster planted our explosives, and-

“There-” I pointed to the trailer the Serpenthead (oddly, not a slur) had been taken to.

We entered, only to see the beast in the center, sitting cross legged in a chair, sipping a glass of wine. He certainly didn’t look captured.

I yelped as a pain shot through my head and suddenly I saw myself in the reflection of a mirror on the opposite side of the room. “What the-”

The Stetski threw the glass down, shattering it. Soldiers entered the room, more than I’d seen before.

“I knew *ssssssomeone* would come to intervene,” the Stetski bemoaned. “Who *ssssssent* you?!”

“You are really embodying the *sssss*stereotype,” I noted. The guards behind us forced us on our knees, our weapons tossed aside. “We won’t tell you.”

“And why the hell are you fracking here?!” Aster continued. “You’ll be killing your own people.”

The Stetski rose from his seat, colors changing from a soft green to a darker red. “Too long have the SSSSSSStetski waited for humanity to die. The confederacy is weak. I,” he hissed for effect, “alone must do what must be done.”

I turned to the guards. “Why are y’all helping him?” They shrugged and pointed out he had offered them safe haven and money.

“Now,” he kneeled in front of us, still taller than our bodies, “who ssssent you?”

“Noone,” I replied, smiling. “And we’re about to stop this whole operation- got bombs in every corner.”

He looked into my eyes and smiled. “Wrong!” he snapped his three clawed fingers and Matt was dragged into the room. Where was Steven?

“Screw you, lizardhead!” Matt snapped, eyeing the beast. “I told you, we should have never trusted Jim.”

“Ta’a’Ka’Ni’ sent you?” the beast snapped. “Of course he did.”

“And who exactly are you?” Aster protested.

“I am Amreta’Khan’Sok’Tal,” he hissed. “But you may call me…” he thought for an agonizingly long moment. “Bob.”

What was with the one syllable monikers? And where the hell was Steven?

“It is time for the Stetski to rise once again,” Bob reiterated. “Our time should be now! When the Stetski realize a human operation has massacred a Natum, they will reveal themselves to prevent chaos- and then I will rise amongst inevitable chaos to lead our people into glorious revolution!”

I rolled my eyes. “Okay.” I also noted the lack of hissing in the speech.

“Tell me, Agentsssssssss of Ta’a’Ka’Ni’, have you ever seen the inside of a Natum?” I shook my head. “Let me sssssssshow you.”

And then we were off, soon finding ourselves walking deep into a pit, which soon became a cave, and then a structure.

Organic, breathing, dripping pods lined the walls, and pulses of something connected each pod like neurons and nerves in the body. The statue of an ancient, massive Stetski lifted a gold spear up into the air.

All the Stetski slept within the pods, eyes eerily open, dreaming open dreams.

“Matt,” I whispered, “where the hell is Steven?”

Bob’s head turned, and his jaws clashed, revealed thousands of sharp, pointed teeth. “Who issss Sssssssteven?”

And then, as if fate befell us the earth shook and rocks came tumbling down. The organic, living lights of the Natum flashed brightly, and then darkened, confusing our opponents.

That’s when I struck out, striking the first guard in the head, then seizing his weapon. I fired blindly, hoping not to massacre my friends.

They did the same, but we were vastly outnumbered. Until Steven appeared like mist to an early morning day. And not just *one* Steven, but dozens marched forwards, an army of old librarian-esque men.

“That’s Steven,” I informed.

“Whaaaat the hhhhhHhhHHHhhelll?!” Bob snarled. I fired my weapon while he was distracted, hitting him several times in the chest.

The army of old men picked up rocks and threw them, and a volley of stones fell upon the men- though keen eyed magic immunified us. The guards fled the scene, breaking through the army of Stevens and out the Natum.

Bob snarled and charged towards me, arms open, claws out. He hissed and snarled and was quickly met by several rounds of the machine gun Matt had equipped himself with.

“SSSSSsSSSSsScrew you,” Bob snipped, before falling to the floor, dead.

Aster reached out and felt him. “Yeah, definitely dead all right.”

The army of old men collapsed into one. “Steven!” I shouted. “You saved us.”

“That was Plan B,” he pointed out.

“It should have been Plan A,” Matt joked. We all laughed at that.

And so the day was done. We dragged the corpse of Bob, destroyed the fracking site, and enchanted our way through airport security. And before the day was done we were back, I was in my office with Matt and Aster (god knows where Steven went), meeting a very satisfied Jim.

“Thank you, thank you,” he bluntly announced, reaching in for a hug. I took it. He walked over and hugged Aster, who confusedly took it. Matt opted for a handshake. “And your prize!”

He handed me the rib of St. Paul the Oracle. “Dr. Gilmore’s going to pay a lot for this one,” Aster snickered.

“Aster, we can’t give away the names of our clients,” I reprimanded. I turned to Jim. “What are you going to do about-” I gestured to the dead Bob on the floor.

“We will probably put him on trial as an example against rebellion,” Jim informed. “And then eat him. Probably.” We looked at him in confusion. “That was a joke.”

Matt spoke next, surprising us all. “Hey, man, Jim, I’m really sorry about earlier,” he patted Jim on the shoulder. “You really helped us- and the world with the fracking site. I guess not all liza- er, Stetski are bad. I’m going to be open minded from now on.”

“Open minded enough to go to the Festival of Xa’Phon?” he hopefully asked.

Aster cut off Matt’s confirmation. “Don’t go the Festival of Xa’Phon. It’s a mess. Every year.”

“This is true,” Jim agreed. “Now I must go back to being Jim the U.S Congressman and fight Climate Change. Perhaps I see you again, perhaps not. You have fallen into the favor of the house of Stet’hok!”

And Jim put his human flesh back on like clothing and we were incredibly disgusted. And out he went, without a care in the world. I dismissed my team, and settled down, inspecting the rib with a well trained Aster.

“You know Paul the Oracle was a Stetski, right?” Aster inquired, handling and turning the rib. There was text on it, ancient, one I would need Steven to translate. I nodded; I had Steven read up on Paul. “I wonder what someone like Dr. Gilmore would want with a Saint of the Stetski?”

I shrugged. “We’re just the middlemen, Aster.” That was how things went. “It’s not our business to know why people want a certain thing. But I do hope, that one day man and Stetski may live together in peace, without the prejudices of the old. Matt’s really restored my faith in that, truly.”

Aster only nodded to that, feeling the holy power of the rib in her hands. Perhaps, truly one day there would be a world of freedom, of equality and justice, one where even the serpentine peoples and fiery ancients of old and us may unite, as one.

But today was not that day. Today was just another day as the middleman. Such were things in the House of Lorreno.
