When I was younger, I had this friend named Bats.

I met her at a janky little carnival that was only in town for one weekend. At the time, I’d been in the police academy for two weeks, and another cadet had taken me there on a date.

There was nothing wrong with the guy, especially compared to my last boyfriend. But it felt wrong. As the date stretched on and night fell, I realized I didn’t want to be there with him. I didn’t want to be there at all. I wasn’t ready. Not for the date, or the way he kept leaning in, and definitely not for the way he kept looking at me.

And that’s because of Jason.

Jason was my last boyfriend. One night, about two years prior to that evening at the janky carnival, we went to bed. In the morning, I woke up.

Jason didn’t.

He was a side sleeper. When he died, that side of his face folded into rills, almost like a curtain rolling upward. It froze that way. That was bad. The emptiness of him was worse.

Under the best of circumstances, there’s this quality, a hollow, asymmetrical slackness that's unique to death. The morning I woke up and he didn’t, that’s how he looked. Hollow, asymmetrical, and slack.

That’s how I remember him, no matter how hard I try to change it.

So fast forward a few years to that rundown carnival.

As night fell, I started losing it. By the time the stars came out, I couldn’t look at my date without seeing his face as though he were dead: slack and hollow, with cold skin rilled up like a curtain call.

He didn’t notice because he was fixated on a game booth. Among the array of prizes was this gigantic stuffed dragon that he was hellbent on winning for me. I should have been flattered. I should have been having fun.

But I couldn’t have fun, not with the way his face kept going slack. Not with the way his eyes kept clouding up. Not with the way the side of his face kept rolling up like a flesh curtain.

Watching him play this shitty carnival game for that shitty stuffed animal under the blazing lights was too much. Too much light, too much noise, too much greasy funnel cake smell coating my throat every time I breathed in, too much him, and far, far too much me.

Just  as he finally won that stuffed dragon, I started crying.

It was the worst kind of crying too, the kind where tears come before you even know you’re sad.

And even though it makes no sense, I panicked. I didn’t want him to see me cry. Couldn’t stand for him to see. That was the only thought in my head:

*I can’t let him see.* 

So I spun around as tears fell and the lights broke open and flooded the world the way things do when you cry, and stumbled away.

Of course, he came after me. Why wouldn't he?

I started running.

Three seconds later I collided with someone so hard I actually ricocheted a little, and I burst into tears.

The next thing I knew, the lady I’d run into was holding me tight and telling my poor date to fuck off before she called the cops.

“I am the cops,” he said.

That made me laugh, but I was crying so hard it sounded like a sob. That sent my savior into overdrive. Every cop-related slur on this earth erupted out of her, so loud she drew a crowd. Or maybe the funnel cake stand was drawing the crowd with its sticky sweet grease smell, and she was just the entertainment.

She screamed until my date finally left.

It was impressive. It was also embarrassing when, about two minutes later, I felt the need to tearfully confess that I was also a cop.

She patted my back, bracelets jangling as they caught the lights. “All cops are bastards, including you. But bastards need friends too, especially little ones who still have time to grow and shed their bastard skins.”

“What?” I asked nervously.

She pinched the sleeve of my jacket and pulled upward. Her face lit up so brightly that I was sure she was mocking me. “Look! Your bastardness isn’t even a skin yet. It’s still a coat, which means there’s plenty of time to fix you. I bet the mirror would prove it.”

“What mirror?”

“The mirror in my favorite place in the world, which is a shitty little night club. It and the mirror are magic. It shows you who you really are on the inside. Want to come see?”

“No."

“Good, because you’re not ready, and when you’re not ready, the mirror drives you insane. I’ve seen it. We’ve got to fix you first. So let’s get fixing.”

And that’s how I met Bats.

So as a kid, I always felt like I’d been born with a moat around me.

In my mind’s eye, this moat was huge and deep, full of jagged rocks waiting to kill you if you tried to dive, and circling sharks ready to eat you if you tried to swim. It felt like the water was lapping closer every day, threatening to wash the ground out from under my feet and carry me out to the sharks and the rocks. I felt like I either had to wait to drown, or take a running leap and pray I’d jumped high enough to clear the moat and reach the solid ground on the other side.

And I did exactly that...but barely.

In my imagination, I was pinwheeling for balance on the edge of the moat while soft ground crumbled under my feet, threatening to spill me into the water.

I still feel like I’m pinwheeling.

Anyway, I think Bats had been born with that same moat, but she didn’t try to jump across. Somehow she just danced on the water, dodging rocks and sharks like it was nothing.

 I don't even know what I'm trying to express here, except to say that Bats was everything I wanted to be, which is everything I’ll never be.

Bats was lanky and somehow withered even though she wasn’t much older than me. She had dark hair and eyes that were almost yellow. In low light, they were bright as molten gold. She wore stacks of antique bracelets and billowing bright scarves that contrasted with her clothes, which were mostly black and generally outrageous. Her voice carried the telltale rasp of someone who’s played a little too often with substances, and her laugh was grating but wonderful. She worked the dish pit at a chain restaurant and lived two blocks from me.

Her apartment was a cluttered riot of color and light. She hated lamps, so string lights in every shape and color crisscrossed the ceiling and the walls like giant spiderwebs.

Her place wasn’t just cluttered with light and junk. It was cluttered with people, too. Young, old, wealthy, homeless, whole, broken — people of every kind, whose only commonality was that they belonged to Bats somehow.

I became one of them.

When Bats decided you were hers, she never let you go. Some people love you by putting you at peace. Others love you by breaking you open.

Bats broke me open.

She was the first person to notice I had an eating disorder. She didn’t shame me for it or romanticize or fetishize it, either. What she did was ask what my favorite cookies were.

“Oatmeal,” I said.

“Fucking gross,” she answered.

Instead of oatmeal cookies, she baked a giant batch of *her* favorite: double chocolate chili cookies, and made me eat.

It worked. It shouldn’t have. It wouldn’t have if Bats hadn’t made them. But she did.

So it worked.

Don’t get me wrong. Bats was far from perfect.

People who collect human problems always have problems of their own. Bats was no exception. One of the ways her problems manifested was by treating some of the people she broke open like they were pets.

She treated me like a pet she wanted to train. It’s probably not a surprise, but her training methods were weird as hell. Most of them focused on what she called my “bastard coat.”

“Bastard coats are the outsides we put on to disguise our insides,” she told me. “But the problem with bastard coats is they eventually replace your insides. We have to teach you how to shed your bastard coat and wear your insides out before you become a bastard forever.”

Weirdly, she kept dangling the promise of her favorite club —the one with the supposed magic mirror — over me like a reward.

“Once you shed your bastard coat, I’ll take you to the club to see who you really are in the mirror. I promise.”

But see, I didn’t care.

Only Bats could think standing in front of an antique mirror at a crappy club was a reward. For that matter, only Bats would think of survival — because that’s what the police academy was for me, survival — as a bastard coat.

And only Bats would make it her mission to change someone like me into someone like her solely through the power of love.

I’ll be honest:

I used her.

The care that she showed me — the love she gave as freely as breathing — was something I’d literally never experienced. It was like a drug. It *was* a drug.

I became a junkie.

I had no intention of doing any of the things she wanted me to do. Breaking myself down and putting myself back together. Changing my life path, leaving the academy. Shedding my bastard coat and wearing my insides out. I literally didn’t even know what she meant when she said these things.

But pretending was the price of her adoration, so I pretended.

I shouldn’t have, and not just for her sake. For mine, too. The way she treated me reminded me of Jason. Like him, she was always pushing me to be something I wasn’t. Pressing me to be what she thought I was, instead of learning who I was.

But I didn’t care.

Not when she baked entire batches of chocolate chili cookies for me to graze on through the day. Not when she rearranged her shifts to pick me up after work so I wouldn’t have to walk home alone. Not when she told me that underneath my bastard coat, I was the sweetest person alive. Not when she told me there was nothing I could do to make her let go of me. Not even when she exerted every bit of power she had over me to make me to stay in her dark, bright, cluttered apartment with her other problem people.

Soon I spent more nights at her apartment than mine, curled up in a blanket nest on her bedroom floor under a web of purple string lights.

I wasn’t the only one. At any given time, there were several other people crashing on her couch or her floor. She was closer to all of them than to me.

Just as an example, she took these other friends out every night. They always went to the club with the magic mirror that supposedly reflected who you really are inside. The mirror I wasn’t ready for.

And I wouldn’t even have been able to go. I had to be up at six every morning for the academy, and six is about the time Bats finally stumbled home after her nights out.

But that’s not what mattered. What mattered was she was the person I was closest to, but *I* wasn’t the person *she* was closest to.

Bats was the only person I’d ever been able to spill my heart to, but she was the kind of person who spilled her heart to everyone. So she was special to me. I wasn’t as special to her, though.

We all eventually learn that we don’t mean everything to someone who means everything to us. I’m pretty sure most people learn that as kids. But this was my first time, so I kind of hated Bats for connecting with everyone the way she connected with me.

Still, there wasn’t enough hatred in the world to make me give up the love she gave.

So I contented myself with the role of her little pet.

Here’s the good thing about that: People don’t want anything from pets except good behavior. Up until that point, everyone I’d ever been close to had wanted something from me, whether I knew it or not. But all Bats wanted was good behavior. At the end of the day, good behavior is a performance. It’s just pretend.

I pretended, and got the kind of love no one else ever gave me in return.

That didn’t stop the jealousy.

And I was so jealous.

I was jealous of the other people Bats loved, of course. But mostly I was jealous of Bats because in every way that mattered, she was who I wanted to be.

I told her that once.

She laughed and threw her arms around me. “Underneath your bastard coat, you’re exactly like me, stupid. Why do you think I put up with your bastardness? It’s because I know who you really are.”

“Sure.”

“It’s true! You can’t spell ‘bastard’ without ‘bats,’ you know. You just have to pull out the extra letters and rearrange what’s left.” She smiled and drew me in for a hug. “Just like you have to shed your bastard coat and rearrange what’s underneath. Outside you’re definitely a bastard. But inside, you’re definitely a bat. You’ll see once I turn you inside out.”

None of that makes sense now, but it made sense to me back then.

What also made sense was my fear.

Maybe I *was* a bat inside, but I was more than my insides. I was my outsides, too. We all are. And I *needed* every last one of those extra letters that grew *bat* into *bastard*. I *needed* my bastard coat. What I knew — and what I could never tell her without risking her love — was that the world is safe for bastards. It isn’t safe for bats.

And more than anything, I wanted to be safe. That’s why I loved Bats so much: Because she made me feel safe.

Except when she talked about her favorite club and its creepy mirror.

I don’t know why it bothered me so much, but it did. It even got to the point where any talk of that club kind of scared the shit out of me.

According to Bats, this club was only for people who’d accepted who they really were. The bouncers were good at figuring that out (“Creepy good,” Bats told me, “and trust me, I know because one of them loves me”).

But just to make sure, they brought every new patron to the Mirror Room first. The mirror in the Mirror Room was magic, and it reflected who you really were. If your reflection matched your outsides, you were good. But if you didn’t know who you were, the reflection came out wrong.

And when that happened, it drove you crazy.

It sounds like a particularly stupid urban legend, but Bats swore up and down that it was true. “It’ll drive you crazy. I’ve seen it. That’s why I can’t bring you to the club yet. I can have a bastard in my house, but I can’t have a *crazy* bastard. So you have to wait until you can wear your insides out.”

I know this all sounds insane.

But it all starts to make more sense when you understand that Bats had a chronic substance abuse problem. She functioned pretty well, but you could always tell when she was high. One of her tells was that she wouldn’t shut up about this mirror.

Finally I got sick of it, and one night on her way out to the mirror club with her friends she was actually close to - the friends who were actually her friends, not her pets - asked to come along.

She told me no. “It’s a place for people who have accepted who they are. And you, my little bastard, are nowhere close.”

Then she kissed the top of my head while her friends who were friends and not pets tittered. Then they all trouped out in a cloud of scarves and body glitter and shimmering eyeshadow.

No matter what I said, I wanted to go with them.

But I couldn't.

The biggest problem I had - the real problem - is that people like Bats ruin the lives of people like me.

I grew up as a trailer trash foster kid with no past and no future. Just another dead end kid trapped  in the center of a deadly moat. A kid who had to decide whether to drown, or take a running leap and pray to God I cleared the water.

I’d taken the leap.

I’d cleared the water, but barely.

Just barely.

My heels are still stuck in the bank, and it's crumbling beneath my feet while I pinwheel for balance.

Bats, meanwhile, was dancing on the water behind me, calling for me because she thought I was like her, that I was born to dance on the water too. But she only thought that because I pretended so well. Because I wore good behavior as surely as I wore my bastard coat.

That was the real problem, the true problem:

No matter what Bats thought, I was nothing like her.

And as I watched her and her friends who weren’t pets vanish into the night, I knew it.

They were bats, fragile and unsafe, winging through the night. I was a bastard, safe and warm and armored in my coat.

Or at least that’s what I told myself as I microwaved dinner and went to bed.

I dreamed of her club that night.

In the dream, tall shadows with blue eyes like stars stalked a bottomless pit that echoed with atonal music and the low, awful laughter that has, for my entire life, suffused my nightmares.

I woke as Bats stumbled into the apartment, smiling and glittering and smeared with makeup, her outfit pasted to her skin with sweat. A cloud of perfume trailed behind her, settling over me as she stepped over my blanket bed.

I watched her, feeling like a particularly stupid, ugly little girl.

She saw me watching. Bats always saw me, even when I didn’t want her to.

Finally she dropped down beside me, a glittering phantom, and stroked my hair.

“It was an amazing night,” she said. “I wish you’d been there. And you will be soon. You’re so close to shedding your bastard coat. Then I can turn you inside out, and you can finally be you.”

She was wrong.

Weeks bled into each other. I grew more confident. My academy graduation drew closer. I made friends with other people who had taken the running leap to clear their moats. People who encouraged me, people who liked me. The ground beneath my feet stopped crumbling quite so fast.

And my bastard coat got heavier by the day.

Sometimes in my nightmares, I actually saw that coat. It always melted into my skin and settled over my bones. Instead of me wearing my insides out, my coat was wearing its way inside.

One day after work, my sergeant walked me out to my car. She saw Bats waiting for me and said, “Take it from me: People like her will ruin your career.”

That made me angry. It was so unfair. So untrue.

Except maybe it was true.

Maybe I knew it.

And maybe that’s why I clung to Bats — because I wanted her to dance up and pull me off the crumbling bank and into the shark-infested moat.

Except I didn’t want that. I didn’t.

So I began the process of un-clinging.

Only Bats didn’t allow it.

I’m not saying that’s healthy. I’m just saying that’s how she was.

And I lapped it up, like always.

I couldn’t help it. I felt at peace when I was with her. I felt loved. I felt like I was home.

I wasn’t, and I *knew* I wasn’t. But I pretended. Sometimes pretending is all we get.

So I pretended Bats was my family. Actually, that’s not completely true. She *was* my family, or at least the closest thing I had. But I pretended I was her family, too. And that really was pretend. Bats loved me, but she didn’t love me like family. She didn't love me best. She just loved me like she loved everyone else.

But that was more than I’d ever had, and I took it without giving anything back except fake good behavior.

A few weeks later, I graduated my academy. Bats refused to come to the ceremony on principle — “that’s too many bastards in one place for me, the smell alone would kill me —” but she took me to mini golf after.

She was high and the sky was a blazing, hazy, smoggy riot of color so beautiful it could’ve come out of a nightmare. Everything was hot as hell and miserable until the sun went down, at which point it turned hot as hell and perfectly pleasant. Like the air was a warm bath.

After our game, we bought the biggest drinks we could at the 7-11 and wandered to the park, where we laughed and yelled and danced like we were drunk. We weren’t, not at all. Except we were.

Once we slurped the last of our soda and crunched the last pieces of sugar-stained ice, we plopped down on the grass and looked up at the sky. There were no stars because of light pollution, but we pretended.

She said, “I’m taking you to the club tonight.”

“Why?”

“Because right this very minute, your bastard coat is slipping off and your insides are shining through. You have to see for yourself. Then you’ll shed your coat for good.”

She pulled me to my feet and led me home, where she issued instructions: “Dress however you want. But leave your bastard coat open so everyone can see who you really are underneath.”

I don’t remember what I wore, only that the night was so oppressively hot that I sweated through them immediately. But not in a way that made me feel disgusting.

In a way that made me feel like I was sparkling.

When we reached the club, there was a line winding down the sidewalk. Music inside echoed. It didn’t sound like club music, which was a relief, somehow.

The line inched forward with aching slowness because the bouncer took so much time inspecting everyone. He raised their coats, patted them down, made them turn around and around. Normally this would have gotten my hackles way, way up, but this wasn’t normal. Somehow, there was something completely, primally right about what he was doing. For some reason, that sense of utter rightness unsettled me as much as if he actually had been predatory.

“I’m glad it’s him tonight,” Bats said happily. “He’s the one who loves me.”

To pass the time, I studied the people in line. With unease, I noticed a few faces I’d seen on my recent rounds in the county jail. My mentor’s words wound through my mind like a poisoned current: *People like her will ruin your career*.

Finally we reached the bouncer.

Bats swept forward. The way he looked at her proved her right: He adored her.

He checked her over and waved her in with a smile that enchanted even me. Bats crossed the threshold and spun around, smiling at me from her cloud of glitter and shadows.

Then the door swung shut, and it was my turn.

As the bouncer’s eyes turned to me, I suddenly felt heavy. So weighed down, and terribly, terribly hot. Like I was wearing the biggest, heaviest coat on earth.

He swept my hair back, turned my head this way and that, tugged the strap of my dress.

He had no smile for me.

Finally he said, “You can’t come in. Your bastard coat has become your skin.”

The world kind of stopped.

I felt so stupid. So embarrassed. So I did what I always did when I was upset, which was laugh.

Then I spun around and marched home. To my home, not hers.

That night I dreamed of the club again. Of its wide-smiled doorman marching me to the magic mirror. The glass swirled with darkness and blinding light and dozens of eyes, each and every one locking onto me. Terror drowned me, followed by panic. I twisted and flailed against the bouncer, who flung me in front of the mirror.

I knew, deep in my heart, that I couldn’t look at my reflection. That I couldn’t inflict whatever waited there on the world or myself.

So I closed my eyes.

Then I woke up and got ready for work.

Bats was waiting for me when my shift ended. I tried to avoid her, but Bats didn’t know how to be avoided.

And I didn’t know how to stay away from someone who loved me.

So I got in her car and she drove us back to her apartment. Back home.

Back when I was in foster care, I always dreamed of coming home. In reality, going home only ever felt sad. But in my dreams, stepping across the threshold into my parents’ home felt like a relief so profound it was heartbreaking.

Stepping into Bats’ apartment felt like that. It always felt like that. That’s why I couldn’t ever stay away from it, or her.

I know it wasn’t fair. I’d never been fair to Bats. From the very beginning, I always took more than I gave.

But something about my experience at the club — about the bouncer’s face when he told me my bastard coat had become my skin — made me take even more from her.

And the more I took, the more she seemed to love me.

So I kept taking without giving.

And I wasn’t the only one. Just look at who stayed in her home, who she spent her time with, who she sought out, who she protected. Bats loved people who needed her, and she gave everything to people who took everything.

So that’s what I did. I thought it would be okay. Well, no. That’s not true. I just never thought about it.

She did, though.

One day while making another batch of those chili cookies, she said, “I think you only love me because I give what no one else ever has. And I’m glad because that means you’ll never let me go.”

Then she hugged me, in the process powdering me with flour and cocoa and cayenne pepper.

I felt the weight of my bastard coat sinking into my skin. Sinking deep. Turning my insides into itself.

“I’d never let you go anyway,” I lied.

She didn’t answer. When Bats didn’t answer you, it meant she didn’t believe you.

And honestly, that pissed me off.

So I decided to do something about it.

That night, like most nights, she took off with her friends who weren’t pets to go to their magic mirror club. I stayed behind. As I got ready for bed, I put my pajamas on inside out.

When Bats stumbled in at five in the morning, she didn’t notice.

When I got up for the day, I put my shirt and my pants on inside out and made breakfast.

She staggered into her tiny kitchen a little later, bleary eyed and so smeary with makeup she looked more like an impressionist painting than a person.

It took her fifteen minutes to notice my clothes were on inside out, and when she did she laughed until she hiccuped. “You’ll shed that bastard coat soon, don’t worry.”

The thing is, I think I could have shed my bastard coat right then and there. I could actually feel it, heavy on my shoulders, off-center and slowly sliding off.

Almost without realizing, I shrugged my shoulders up, just like you do to keep an actual, real, oversized coat in place.

Nothing important happened for a while after that.

More work, a couple of magical outings with Bats sprinkled between dozens of outings with my new work friends, more nightmares about the club with its mirror.

And like any junkie presented with an endless fix, I kept taking more from Bats than I gave.

This sounds crazy too, but taking from her made me feel stronger. More stable. More *me.* Like the ground was no longer crumbling beneath my feet.

Bats, meanwhile, seemed to shrink. She diminished, somehow. And she was always so cold. Even when she came home from the club, she was no longer a furnace giving off sweat-damp heat. She was cool and clammy. Like she was sick. Or like something was eating her.

Knowing what I know now, I think something was.

And I think that something was me.

She came to the same conclusion because she woke me up one night, drunk and staggering. 

“I’m sorry I’m drunk,” she slurred. “I know you hate it, but I had to get drunk because that’s the only way I can say this to you. I don’t want to say it, but I need to. You know how that feels, don’t you? When you need to do something even though it’s the very last thing you want?”

“Yeah,” I said cautiously.

She gave me a broken smile as her eyes misted with tears. “Your bastard coat’s trying to shed, but you keep putting it back on. And you keep using me to help. I can’t do that. You need to be who you want to be, whoever that is. But if you want to be that — if you’re fighting to turn into that — you need to do it somewhere else, with someone you’re not using.”

The bottom fell out of my world. Anger immediately welled up like blood in a wound, buoying me.

“Other than my sister,” Bats said, “there’s no one I’d rather be around than you. You’re my favorite. I’m your favorite too. But you’re my favorite because I love you. I’m your favorite because you use me.”

That was the end.

Even though she could barely walk in a straight line, she insisted on escorting me back to my apartment. I was selfish, so I let her.

On her way back home, she got hit by a drunk driver and died. The guy is still in jail. I know because I check every year.

My world shuddered on its axis and collapsed, leaving me to cling to the rim of reality. To the soft wet edge of that moat as the ground crumbled beneath my fingers.

The weeks following were half hazy living nightmare, half starkly boring monotony. Everything was far too real even though nothing was real enough.

For some reason, I started running.

Before work, after work, all day on my days off. Sometimes I’d wake up in the middle of the night and just go out for a run. Flying blindly through the night in darkness thick and warm as syrup.

I don’t even remember it. I remember that I *did* it, but don’t have any actual memories. Just a dreamy, endless impression of my feet on sunbleached concrete and ribbons of buckled asphalt and tired yellow grass in the park.

Hour after hour, night after night, I ran. Almost like I was looking for her. I think I was. I think part of me was trying to catch her, somehow, before she got hit by that car. Hoping I could turn back time or change the future, or maybe just slide into a world where she was still alive. Maybe the very same world where crossing my parents’ threshold was a joyful homecoming instead of the latest step in our dysfunctional dance of separation and reunion.

I was running through a living nightmare of my own making to chase down a dream.

And one night — just as the weather began to turn, still warm but with the taste of in the air  — I woke up.

Reality rushed back in, brightly lit and dark-skied and irretrievably broken, and I found myself in front of Bats’ club.

The line wound around the block, full of people coated in multicolored lights.

I went to the back of the line and joined them, snaking forward step by maddeningly slow step until I was finally face to face with the bouncer, bathed in every hue of neon.

It was the bouncer who’d turned me away before. The one who loved Bats. I expected him to denounce my bastard coat and send me on my way.

Instead he waved me in.

The inside of the club reminded me of Bats’ apartment: Dark walls draped with color and tangled webs of string lights. The cramped floor was dotted with mismatched tables. There were only two doorways: The one I’d just entered, and a wildly ornate door with a wooden sign that said *Mirror Thru Here.* At the back was a stage so tiny I couldn’t figure out how the band fit on it.

Their music filled the place. It wasn’t club music. I couldn’t tell you what genre it was. It was soothing and unsoothing, happy and heartbreaking, home and somewhere faraway all blended together into invisible smoke.

I took a seat at one of the mismatched tables — one that reminded me of the nicked, scratched, paint-splattered folding table my grandma kept in her old house — and watched the band.

When the set ended, I stood up just as someone touched my hand.

I looked up and saw the bouncer. He looked back with resignation.

Then he slid into the seat beside me. “She told me you were just like her,” he said.

I didn’t need to ask who he meant.

“Can I see if that’s true?”

I nodded because I didn’t know what else to do. He gave me a smile — a small, pained one, nothing like the magic one he reserved for Bats — then pulled me to my feet and across the floor.

I felt like I was in a dream. Not just any dream, but the dream where Bats was fine, where I’d never hurt her, where going home to my mother felt like joy instead of another disaster. A dream where the ground no longer crumbled beneath my feet.

The bouncer led me through the ornate door.

Bats was there.

Bats, laying on a table, motionless and slack and asymmetrical, bruised and broken, torn into pieces in the special way vehicles break human beings into pieces.

  
Terror drowned me, the strongest, deepest fear I've ever known, flooding the bounds of my moat and threatening to pull me back into the current.

But it receded, slowly.

And once receded, I approached the table.

Bats was dead, but not dull. Her skin shone dimly and unevenly, like a guttering flame. In places where her flesh had been ravaged and road-rashed into nonexistence, her insides glittered through like powdered glass.

Around her was a shimmering, multicolored storm of activity.

People surrounded the table. A few I recognized from the shining, smiling pack that drifted in and out of her apartment. People who were her friends, not her pets. People who danced on the water with her while I watched bitterly from my crumbling shore. Most I didn’t recognize at all, although a few felt familiar in ways I can’t explain.

Two of those were angling a large mirror over her body. They were built strangely — thin, spidery, almost spindly, and terribly graceful. They weren’t frightening or ugly, but looking at them too long made my stomach flip flop and clench the way it does when I see a horrific injury.

Their mirror caught and magnified Bats' chest, then turned sideways so that the bouncer and I could see. My breath caught:

Where her heart should have been was a ragged, gaping hole.

“We’ve been trying to wake her up since she got here,” the bouncer told me. Every word wound through my head, gentle and hypnotic. “But she’s missing something. You can give it back.”

I looked at Bats' reflection, at the way different colors rose and fell and danced across her skin, like light on dying embers. At the empty cavern where her heart should be.

I understood what the bouncer was asking.

And in that moment, I was dying to give it.

I grabbed my own chest, expecting my fingers to sink into my skin the way my bastard coat did in nightmares, or maybe for everything to already be cut open. It's insane, but somehow I really thought I’d be able to reach into my own chest cavity to pull out my heart and put it in her chest. I wanted to. I was ready to.

The bouncer took my hand again. “It’s not that easy. First, we have to make absolutely sure you’re just like her.”

Then he turned me around to face another, much smaller door across the room. It was half open. Darkness bled out. Etched into it were the words *Mirror Room*.

Bats’ magic mirror.

The mirror that shows what you really are. That proves you’re who you really are, or drives you insane.

The thing, I realized, that I feared more than anything.

The bouncer took me by the arms like an insolently graceful dance partner and led me to the door.

Unlike my nightmares, I didn’t fight or flail, and he didn’t fling me down. He only pushed me inside gently, then shut the door.

The darkness was absolute and my terror overwhelming for one endless second.

Then the lights snapped on, heavy as syrup, hot as the sun, illuminating swirling storms of dust and the massive mirror across from me.

I caught a glimpse of my reflection. Just a glimpse. It was enough to make me panic.

I covered my eyes and stayed that way for a long time, sweating under the lights with my hands pressed to my face.

At some point, I realized I was shaking.

That opened the door for other perceptions, each more painful than the last. The heat. The sweat cutting rivulets down my painfully hot skin. My clothes clinging to me like oily film.

And over it all, thick and heavy and maddeningly itchy, was a coat.

The heaviest, itchiest, most awful coat I could have ever dreamed of.

My bastard coat somehow brought into reality.

It wasn’t just itchy, it was painful. I felt like it was sinking past my sweat-soaked clothes and straight to my skin where it just kept sinking. I could feel the individual fibers, a thousand white-hot filaments, cooking their way into my body.

My outside, eating its way in.

I finally parted my fingers to bare one eye. I kept it squinted, ready to snap it shut at the first hint of insanity, and glanced at the mirror.

All I saw was me.

I covered my face again and took a deep breath. I steeled my spine, squared my shoulders. Then I dropped my hands to my sides, and opened my eyes.

My reflection was only me.

Only me in a ragged, sweat-drenched coat with a funny motley pattern. It hung wide open, so huge it threw most of my body into shadow. My skin glimmered strangely underneath, not with sweat but something else. Not anything beautiful. Something eerie and upsetting, the visual equivalent of the bone-chilling music I always hear in nightmares. But it wasn’t a nightmare. It was me.

Just me in a big ugly coat.

Relief crushed upward like a reverse avalanche, and burst out of me in peals of laughter.

My knees went so weak that I lowered myself to the floor amid the storm of swirling dust. The coat tented over me as the syrupy hot lights dimmed. The room was still oppressively, terribly hot, but softly so. Like the mini golf course after dark. Suffocating but pleasant, like a hot bath.

The door creaked open.

Soft footsteps approached. Someone knelt beside me and slid their hands under my coat. I tensed up as a dozen ugly memories of even uglier touches threatened to crash over me, but those hands only went under my arms to raise me gently to my feet.

It was the bouncer, apologetic and gentle and so, so sad.

“You’re not a match for her,” he said.

Another reverse avalanche crushed upward, this time exiting in the form of sobs. I’d failed her. I’d used her until it killed her, then failed her.

He put his arms around my shoulders the way Bats used to do. “Don’t be sad. She’d want it this way. You’re not the last person she wants to take from, but you’re close. This is better. I promise.”

He led me into the room where Bats lay slack and asymmetrical on her table. As we passed, I took her hand one last time, focusing on the feel of her broad palm and long fingers while people I couldn’t bring myself to look at angled the mirror over her missing heart.

But I caught a glimpse of her face in the mirror. Her reflection at least didn’t look slack or asymmetrical. She was horrifyingly beautiful and monstrously lovely, the worst yet most welcome thing I’ve ever seen.

The bouncer walked me out, past the mismatched tables and the band and the glittering, shimmering people in the shadows, and all the way back onto the street, where he straightened my coat and smoothed my hair back. I noticed, for the first time, that he was wearing a coat, too. It was a different color and pattern — stripes, not motley — but cut exactly the same. Unlike mine, his fit perfectly. Beyond perfectly.

Like a second skin.

“It’s okay to wear a bastard coat,” he said. “You don’t have to wear your insides out, just as long as your outsides don’t wear in. She didn’t understand that.” He gave me a sad and enchanting half smile. “I’m glad you’re not a match. It would have hurt me to take you apart.”

Then he sent me on my way, with my bastard coat dragging on the ground behind me.

I staggered home just like Bats used to, stumbling through my apartment in a haze of shimmering sweat. I collapsed on my bed as the room spun gently.

As I fell asleep, I noticed I couldn’t see my coat anymore. I could *feel* it, heavy as ever on my shoulders. But I couldn’t see it.

I haven’t seen it since.

I know it’s there. I feel it sometimes when I focus, but it’s not heavy or too big. It just feels like a second skin.

Anyway, I didn’t learn anything from that.

I didn’t become a better person. I didn’t change my ways or have some kind of stoner-ass Ebenezer Scrooge awakening.

I just woke up the next morning, standing on the edge of my moat while the ground crumbled under my heels, and missed her.

I don't know what else to say, except I'd give a lot to go back and change it.

Or at least to give her a fraction of what she [gave me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NorthAmericanPantheon/comments/1mngy3f/story_master_list/)
