She let out a shriek—a piercing, bone-rattling sound that seemed to come from everywhere at once.

For a moment, none of us moved, frozen in the grip of pure terror.

We turned around to head back.

The retreat back to the gorge was hurried, the weight of what we’d seen hanging over all of us. Mama Webster’s monstrous form, the sight of her descending from the cliffs, had left an indelible mark on every one of us. Her grotesque presence, even for just a moment, was a reminder of what we were truly up against.

“This isn’t the way forward,” I said, my voice sharp as we approached the bridge. The soldiers lingered just ahead, their eyes darting nervously at every shadow. “We can’t get an army through here. It’s too dangerous. We need another way.”

Gregory turned, his expression grim. “Agreed. This path is suicide. Let’s regroup and come up with something else.”

Tianna was already scanning the cliffs above, her bow drawn and ready. “Move fast. She’s still out there.”

The bridge came into view, swaying gently in the faint breeze. It felt different now—less a route forward and more a fragile, fleeting link to safety. Every creak of the wood sent a fresh wave of anxiety through me.

“Go,” Gregory said, waving the soldiers forward. “One at a time. Don’t rush it.”

The soldiers began crossing, their movements careful and deliberate, the ropes groaning faintly under their weight. Gregory and Tianna stayed at my sides, their weapons drawn.

The stillness of the gorge was deafening, the faint rustling of the wind barely audible.

And then the clicking began.

It started faintly, like before—a sound so soft it could have been a trick of the mind. But as it grew louder, faster, and closer, the sense of dread returned with full force.

“She’s here,” Tianna said, her voice tight.

The clicking echoed from above and around us, impossible to track. The soldiers on the bridge froze, their eyes wide as the sound reverberated through the gorge.

“Move!” I shouted, waving them forward.

They scrambled to obey, their boots clattering against the wooden planks as the bridge swayed dangerously. Tianna loosed an arrow into the shadows above, but it was impossible to tell if it hit anything.

Then she appeared.

Mama Webster surged over the cliffs, her massive form blotting out the light. Her legs moved with impossible speed, their sharp tips slamming into the stone path as she scuttled toward us. Her body glistened with oil-like fur, and her many eyes gleamed with a cold, predatory hunger.

She let out a piercing shriek that seemed to shake the air itself, the sound rattling my teeth and sending a jolt of terror through me.

“Run!” Gregory shouted, grabbing my arm and shoving me toward the bridge.

I stumbled onto the planks, the structure swaying violently beneath my feet. The soldiers were nearly across, their frantic movements setting the ropes creaking. Tianna turned, firing arrow after arrow at the monstrous creature, but they barely slowed her down.

Mama Webster’s legs struck the bridge as she lunged, her weight causing the planks to groan and splinter. I reached the middle, Gregory and Tianna close behind, but I could feel her closing in.

One of her legs slammed down inches from me, the force sending me sprawling onto the planks. I scrambled to my feet, but she was already upon us, her massive form blocking the path ahead.

She lunged, her mandibles snapping inches from my face. I raised my weapon, but her leg struck me hard, knocking me onto my back.

I stared up at her, my chest heaving as I struggled to move. Her eyes—dozens of them—locked onto mine, cold and calculating. Her mandibles clicked, and for a moment, I thought I saw something in her movements, something eerily human.

Was she like me? The thought came unbidden, sending a chill through me.

Had Mama Webster once been a player, someone like me who had died in this world and been rewoven into one of Naamah’s monstrous creations? The idea made my stomach churn, but there was no time to dwell on it.

She reared back, her massive legs pinning me down as she prepared to strike.

And then Gregory moved.

With a roar, he leapt onto her back, his sword slashing into the thick fur of her thorax. She shrieked, twisting violently, but he held on, his weight throwing her balance off.

“Gregory!” Tianna screamed, her voice filled with panic.

He didn’t hesitate. With a final, desperate movement, he drove his blade deeper and pulled with all his strength, dragging her weight toward the edge of the bridge.

Mama Webster screeched, her legs flailing as she scrabbled for purchase. The ropes creaked and groaned under her immense weight, but Gregory didn’t stop.

With one last, tremendous heave, he pulled her over the edge.

There was no time for words, no final goodbyes. Gregory and Mama Webster disappeared into the darkness below, their forms swallowed by the abyss.

The sound of their fall echoed faintly, then silence.

I lay there, staring at the edge of the bridge, my chest tight and my breath shallow. Tianna stood frozen, her bow slack in her hands, tears streaking down her cheeks.

“Glenn,” she said finally, her voice trembling. “We have to move.”

I nodded numbly, forcing myself to my feet. We crossed the bridge in silence, the creaking planks beneath my boots a cruel reminder of what had just happened.

When we reached the other side, I turned back, staring into the void where Gregory had fallen.

I didn’t say anything. There were no words. Just a hollow, gnawing ache that I knew I’d carry with me for the rest of this journey.

We pressed on, because there was nothing else we could do.

The days following our retreat from the gorge blurred together, an endless stretch of exhaustion, grief, and grim determination. With no way forward through the gorge and Gregory gone, we had no choice but to loop back to the army and search for another path.

It took weeks to navigate the winding trails and treacherous terrain that led us around the gorge. The terrain seemed to grow more twisted and foreboding with each passing day, as if the land itself conspired to keep us from our goal. The soldiers, now bound to a deeper purpose by the tune of my pipes, marched with a resilience that bordered on eerie. Tianna and I kept to ourselves, our shared grief over Gregory’s sacrifice hanging between us like a shadow.

The nights were the hardest. The campfires brought little comfort, the flickering flames casting shadows that danced too much like monsters. Every gust of wind, every crack of a branch sent our nerves spiraling. I couldn’t shake the feeling that Naamah was watching, her unseen presence weighing heavy on my mind.

But we pressed on, because there was no other choice.

Eventually, the land began to change again. The jagged cliffs gave way to smoother plains, and the oppressive canopy of the forest thinned, letting in faint streams of light. The air was different here, heavier with a strange, cloying sweetness that clung to every breath.

And then, one morning, we saw it.

Naamah’s palace.

It loomed on the horizon like a dark crown, its towering spires piercing the sky. The gates were immense, wrought from black iron and adorned with intricate carvings of writhing figures, their twisted forms both beautiful and grotesque. The walls shimmered faintly, as though they were made of liquid shadow, and the air around the palace seemed to hum with an otherworldly energy.

The army stopped in their tracks, the soldiers murmuring uneasily as they took in the sight. Even Tianna, who had been so composed, seemed shaken by the sheer presence of the palace.

“It’s… massive,” she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

I nodded, my jaw tightening as I stared up at the gates. “This is it,” I said, more to myself than anyone else.

The weight of Gregory’s absence hit me again as I stood there, his sacrifice fresh in my mind. He had given everything to get us here, and now it was up to us to finish what we’d started.

Tianna stepped closer, her expression hardening as she placed a hand on my shoulder. “He wouldn’t want us to stop now,” she said, as if reading my thoughts.

I took a deep breath, the pipes in my hand feeling heavier than ever.

“No,” I said quietly. “He wouldn’t.”

I turned to the soldiers, their eyes fixed on me, waiting for their next command.

“Prepare yourselves,” I said, my voice steady despite the unease twisting in my gut. “This isn’t just a palace. It’s her domain. And she won’t let us in without a fight.”

The army moved into formation, their discipline unnerving in its precision. Tianna and I exchanged a glance, a silent acknowledgment of the battle ahead.

As the gates of Naamah’s palace loomed closer, the oppressive hum in the air grew louder, resonating deep in my chest.

The assault began at dawn.

The soldiers moved as one, their polished armor glinting in the faint light of the rising sun. The air was heavy with tension, thick with the unspoken understanding that this battle would be unlike anything we had ever faced. Tianna stood beside me, her bow drawn, her sharp gaze fixed on the towering gates of Naamah’s palace.

As we approached, the oppressive hum in the air intensified, vibrating deep in my chest. The walls of the palace seemed to shimmer with a dark, liquid energy, their surface alive with faint, writhing shapes that defied understanding.

The army reached the gates, and the first wave of soldiers surged forward, carrying a massive battering ram. The crash of wood against iron echoed through the courtyard, each strike reverberating like a thunderclap.

Monsters poured out of the shadows.

They came in waves, grotesque and twisted, their forms defying logic. Some were massive, towering beasts with limbs that bent unnaturally, their flesh covered in pulsating, black veins. Others were smaller, faster, their razor-sharp claws and jagged teeth gleaming in the dim light.

The soldiers held their ground, their movements precise and unrelenting as they engaged the horde. For every monster they struck down, two more seemed to take its place. The air was filled with the clash of steel, the guttural roars of the creatures, and the cries of men fighting for their lives.

Tianna loosed arrow after arrow, each shot finding its mark. I stayed close, my blade cutting through the chaos as we pushed forward, step by bloody step.

And then, with a deafening crack, the gates shattered.

The soldiers surged through, spilling into the courtyard beyond. For a moment, it seemed like we had the upper hand. The monsters faltered, their ranks thinning as we pushed them back toward the palace walls.

But it was a trap.

The walls shimmered, the shadows twisting and stretching until they burst forth with a new wave of horrors. These were different—more deliberate, more calculated. Their grotesque forms moved with an intelligence that sent a chill down my spine.

The ambush hit the army hard. Soldiers were dragged into the shadows, their screams cutting short as the monsters overwhelmed them. The courtyard became a bloodbath, the once-coordinated ranks of my army breaking apart under the relentless assault.

“Keep moving!” Tianna shouted, grabbing my arm and pulling me forward.

We fought through the chaos, the pipes heavy at my side as I slashed and ducked, every step closer to the main entry of the palace. The air was suffocating now, thick with the acrid stench of blood and decay.

As we neared the massive doors that led into the palace itself, the battle seemed to fade into the background. The noise dulled, replaced by an oppressive silence that pressed down on my chest.

And then they dropped.

Three figures descended from the walls above, landing with a thunderous crash that shook the ground beneath us.

The first was a hulking monstrosity, its body a grotesque blend of muscle and metal, its face twisted into a mockery of humanity. Its eyes gleamed with a cold, unfeeling light, and its movements were deliberate, almost purposeful.

Henry.

I froze, my mind struggling to reconcile the monstrous form before me with the man I had once known. His features were warped, his body reshaped into something unrecognizable, but there was no mistaking the presence that radiated from him.

The second was smaller, its grotesque frame twitching with an unnatural energy. Its skin was pale and sickly, its limbs elongated and ending in razor-sharp claws. Its face was a twisted parody of youth, its mouth stretched into a jagged grin that didn’t reach its cold, lifeless eyes.

Skibidi.

A sickening realization churned in my stomach as I remembered his childish bravado, his insistence on being a warlord. Now, he was a nightmare given form, a mockery of the boy he once was.

The third monster stepped forward, and my breath caught in my throat.

It was massive, its lower body a grotesque, spider-like form that clattered on the stone with a horrifying rhythm. Its upper body was humanoid, but only barely—its arms were long and segmented, ending in jagged, chitinous blades. Its face…

“Gregory,” I whispered, my voice trembling.

The monstrous form before me had his eyes, or at least what was left of them. They glinted with a cruel intelligence, the twisted remains of the man who had sacrificed himself for us now standing as Naamah’s weapon.

Tianna gasped, her bow faltering as she took a step back. “No,” she breathed, her voice filled with disbelief.

The three horrors stood in silence for a moment, their presence suffocating. Then, as one, they moved.

Henry charged forward, his massive frame barreling toward us like a living battering ram. Skibidi scuttled along the walls, his claws scraping against the stone with an ear-piercing screech. Gregory circled, his spider legs clattering as he closed in with deliberate menace.

“Glenn!” Tianna shouted, snapping me out of my stupor.

I raised my blade, the weight of the moment crashing down on me. These weren’t just monsters—they were ghosts, twisted remnants of the people I had failed to save.

And now, they were coming for me.

The fight began with a fury that felt doomed from the start.

Henry roared, his massive form charging forward with terrifying speed. Tianna loosed arrow after arrow, each one striking true but barely slowing him down. I met his charge head-on, my blade clashing against the grotesque, metallic monstrosity of his limbs.

Each strike sent vibrations through my arms, the sheer power of his attacks overwhelming.
"Glenn, move!" Tianna shouted as Skibidi leapt from the wall, his claws slashing down at me. I barely ducked in time, the air hissing as his claws tore through the space where my head had been.

Gregory's spider-like form clattered toward Tianna, his long, segmented legs moving with horrifying precision. She dodged one strike, then another, her movements frantic as she tried to find an opening to shoot.

"They're too fast!" she yelled, her voice strained.

I slashed at Henry, but his thick, grotesque armor absorbed the blow. He swung at me with a fist the size of a boulder, and I barely managed to roll out of the way as the ground where l'd been standing cracked under the impact.

Skibidi skittered around me, his movements erratic and unnerving. He lunged, his claws catching the edge of my armor and dragging me off balance. I stumbled, falling to one knee, and felt the cold rush of air as Gregory's bladed arm came down toward me.

"Glenn!" Tianna screamed, tackling me out of the way. The blade struck the ground with a deafening clang, sending shards of stone flying.

I scrambled to my feet, my chest heaving as I tried to keep up with their relentless assault.
My mind raced, searching for any strategy, any hope of turning the tide. But they were faster, stronger, and terrifyingly coordinated.

Henry swung his massive arm, and this time, it connected. The blow sent me flying, my back slamming into the stone wall of the courtyard. Stars exploded in my vision as pain shot through me, my weapon slipping from my grasp.

I blinked, trying to focus, and saw them closing in. Henry advancing with his hulking frame, Skibidi scuttling with twitching anticipation, Gregory towering above them all with an eerie, deliberate grace.

Tianna was struggling too, her arrows running low as she dodged and weaved, trying to keep them at bay.

It was hopeless.

But then, in the chaos, I saw it—a gap between the horrors, a narrow path that led to the palace doors. The thought hit me like a bolt of lightning: If I can just make it inside...

"Tianna!" I shouted, pushing myself to my feet. 

"Cover me!"

"What are you-"

"Just do it!"

She hesitated for only a second before turning her focus to the monsters. With a shout, she fired an arrow that struck Henry square in the chest, drawing his attention away from me.
I ran.

My legs felt like lead, every step a battle against the pain coursing through my body.
The monsters reacted immediately-Skibidi shrieked, his claws scraping against the stone as he lunged toward me. Gregory shifted, his spider legs clattering as he moved to block my path.

But Tianna was there, her arrows flying in rapid succession, each one finding its mark.
It wasn't enough to stop them, but it was enough to slow them down.

I reached the doors, my breath ragged as I slammed into the massive, ornate surface.
They creaked under my weight but didn't budge.

"Come on!" I growled, throwing all my strength into it.

Behind me, I heard Tianna cry out—a sharp, desperate sound that made my stomach drop.
"Glenn!" she shouted, her voice filled with panic.
I glanced over my shoulder and saw her on the ground, her bow broken, Henry towering over her. Gregory was advancing, his bladed arms raised, and Skibidi was already closing the distance to me.

Panic surged through me as I turned back to the doors, shoving against them with everything I had.

With a groan, they gave way, swinging open just enough for me to slip through.

I stumbled inside, the heavy doors slamming shut behind me with a deafening thud.
