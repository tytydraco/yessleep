It started with my friend sending a text message in the group chat asking if someone would like to hang out. As noone could except for me I told her I could. We called each other and made a simple plan. We were going to a forest, more specifically a bunker in the forest i had found. It was on a lot of maps so basically everyone could find it basically. The bunker was located near the city jail, and the neighborhood around there wants really the safest, so we decided to bring knives just if something were to happen.

Once there, we went over some fences and jumped over some trenches. We tried to keep quiet because there was a lot of empty bottles of alcohol and some suspicious needles on the ground.

We went to something that looked like a chimney or a simple ventilation thingy, sticking out of the ground. My friend put her ear to it and tried to listen after some sounds. Nothing to special.

We went in the bunker and we both got surprised. All over the walls were satanic crosses and on the ground one massive satanic star.

My friend didn't think much of it but I started feeling like something was off. After some time we heard some weird sounds and ran out of the bunker trying to find somewhere to hide. Although we heard weird noises, there wasn't actually someone there.

We quickly went on our bikes, although it felt like our bike tires were somewhat deflated, but we quickly forgot about it.

I remembered there being an old viking sacrifising place or whatever you call it nearby (don't blame me I'm Swedish and my English sucks), and we tried to go there but soon realised it was too dark to even go a few meters in the forest, and no to mention, I had a strong feeling of something being off, really off, but I decided to not tell her as she wouldnt believed me

We thought about going back home now, since it was too dark, and some quick talking we decided to go back. 

We went back on our bikes and started biking, although now the feeling off something off got even stronger. I felt like someone was watching me, so I looked back. 

A few meters to my right I could clearly see two nuns seemingly pray, one on her knees. I panicked and told my friend to fucking speed up.

After biking for about two or three minutes, my friend told me she was really tired in her legs, so we settled for a pause

I finally told her about the nuns I saw, but she refused to believe me, although she said that she had a really tense feeling of being watched, which I agreed upon

I looked around, just to make sure noone else than us two were around, although I didn't see anyone, I was sure as hell there was more than just us two.

After the pause, we started biking and we came to a tunnel, a really dark one. And since the sun had gone down, it was dark. 

Something about that tunnel also felt off. I tried to brush the feeling off me but it kept staying. Something was clearly off about that tunnel, as we had passed it before, while it was sunny. The tunnel appeared to be really long, like longer than usual, as I had passed that tunnel a few times before.

We kept on biking and eventually we went throught the tunnel. It felt like several minutes passed while we were in the tunnel, but at the same time it took us just two seconds.

After that I don't really remember that much, except for us going home.

When we were home, she told me about the tunnel. She told me she had experienced the exact thing as I did.

Later that night I had dreams about being lost in that forest and that an old woman talked to me about something.

Do whatever you want with this story. I know it sound clich√© or whatever, but I just want someone to believe me. I swear this has happened.

If anyone want the location about the forest, feel free to ask
