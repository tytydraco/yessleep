There's no way that anybody could beileve me or even wrap their heads around what im about to say without a backstory, I'll start there. My earliest memories with my father consisted of doing experiments in a man-made lab in his basement. Most people would describe my father as a strange man, he was introverted, akward, stubborn and absoulutely obssesed with science.Well 30 years ago I watched him become slowly infactuated with the idea of a new  species being made by man, my mother had always warned him not to play the role of God but as I said before my father was a stubborn man and he wasnt too hot on listening either. To me though my father was a sweet and kind man, when one day he told me we were finally done with the experiments he gave me a matching necklace to his and ive never taken it off even to this day.

Fast forward to today, I moved far away from my parents house in Iowa to pursue an acting carrer in california. One day I had got the news from the police that he was now presumed dead after many long months of being missing. I caught a plane to Iowa to go and get anything valuable out of my childhood home. When I walked in I had noticed just how isolated my father had truly become. The cord to the house phone was cut and thrown away, pictures were stripped off the wall and there were a large amount of locks on every door but especially the one to the basement. Luckily the keys to every door were left on the kitchen counter and I was able to check out every room, He didnt keep anything very valuable, atleast not monetarily.

I decided to check the basement after years and years of vacancy, and after getting through all the locks I was hit with a putrid smell. The basement had been scratched up, torn, and clawed through, it looked like an absoulute mess. What was worse though was the sound I kept hearing, A high pitched screech that sounded like it was coming from inside the walls, The basement had been sound-proofed and it had held up well for all those years but the screech was way too late to ignore. I was looking around for the screeching when it caught my eye, the trapdoor that had been uncovered by whatever had nearly destroyed the basement. When I opened and took a peep into the hidden room I saw it. At first I thought it was a creature, but when it turned its head to face me it looked far more like a monster, and it was eating something. I got startled and jumped back quickly but it had surely seen me. "Mother?" It said to me, confused I asked it how it knew how to speak.

 It told me that my father had been raising it for 30 years, I was confused on how that was possible. Thinking back on the experiments I did with my father shocked me, It mostly consisted of my spit swabs, samples of hair, etc... thats when it hit me. This thing I was looking at was created using MY DNA, but it had been altered greatly. I entered the room with it and there were notes on the wall, I read the first to myself. "If your reading this be cautious, He has a taste for flesh" I felt my stomach drop. I tried to stay on one side of the room as he was on the opposite side covering whatever was giving off that smell up. I continued to read the next note "If your seeing him right now your witnessing an absolute miracle, Ive decided to name him Barbatos!" I go on reading the next " It seems that as Barbatos gets older, he seems to need exponentially more food to keep him going, this could be an issue."

&#x200B;

On to another note " Barbatos is smarter than he let's on he's learned to be decitful, he's learned to manipulate." Before I could read anything else, Barbatos stood up, he was tall over 8 feet tall, He was long, skinny, pale and he only had eyes and a mouth, no nose on his face. He towered over me, "Thats enough" he said. "Why dont you come over here, I wanna show you something." I reluctantly approached the other corning with whatever he had been guarding and what I saw next shocked me.

There was a decomposing pile of bones was piled in the corner and hanging off of one I could see my fathers matching necklace he had given me. He tried to grab me but I darted for the trap door. His long limbs chased me but he was too low on energy to catch up with me. I slammed the basement door closed and locked as many locks as I could then I got in my car and drove. I drove for hours and hours just trying to get as far away from that house and possible. I caught a plane back to California and Ive decided to never tell anyone close to me what I saw. I'm never going back to Iowa, however at night I hear clawing on my doors and windows, I had to end up replacing the glass at one point. Im not sure where that thing is now, but clearly something is trying to get to me.
