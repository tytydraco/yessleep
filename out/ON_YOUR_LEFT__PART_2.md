Thank you to the people who commented on the first part. I just got off of work, but I've been thinking a lot throughout the day, and essentially I've decided to keep the laptop for now, go through it, and then if there’s anything suspicious on it, or if I feel like I need to show someone else, that I should bring it in to the sheriff. I don’t condone withholding information from law enforcement WHATSOEVER, but I’m willing to accept the consequences. What I found on the laptop, even just on my first look through, was so… powerful? I guess? It felt like reading Ross’s biography or something. He never struck me as the type of guy to write a book about his life, but that’s pretty much what I’m finding so far. 

Getting into the laptop was no problem. I guess he either never bothered to set a password, or removed it when he put the computer in the safe. It unlocked right away, and I looked through it for a couple of hours. His inbox had nothing noteworthy, there were no pictures on the laptop, and there were very few downloads and files. It looked like he pretty much used it for emails and writing, which he did in the computer’s notes app. It was divided up into sections, so I’m planning on posting one section per post. I’m also going to read them section by section because as much as I hate to admit it, after seeing all the crazy shit he wrote in his “suicide note”, I’m scared to see what he has written on here, and I want the comfort and validation of digital strangers as I go.  I won’t make you wait anymore.  Here’s section 1 of what I found on the laptop.

*I was born in New York, but I moved to New Jersey when I was 4 years old. I don’t remember much about my parents, but I do know they never bothered to take care of me. Apparently, they would leave toddler me in their filthy, needle-filled apartment for hours on end until my screams of distress and hunger got so loud, a neighbor finally took pity on me and called family services. When they came and got me, they told me that I would be living with my grandfather, my dad’s dad, an old man who I had never met or even heard of. He lived in a pre-civil war log cabin that his great-great something had built way back when the United States was just an idea, and when pilgrims roamed the land. He had modernized it some, but when I stepped inside for the first time as a wide-eyed, terrified four year old, I truly thought I was going to live with Davy Crockett. However, when he placed a plate full of steaming hot chocolate chip cookies in front of me that night at dinner, I decided that this was better than any wild frontier. That being said, growing up, life was wild.* 

*Grandpa Charles had a kind face, a white beard, and blue eyes as bright as sapphires. He was an outdoorsman in every sense of the word, always out hunting or fishing or chopping down trees, building things, living off his hunted food and homegrown vegetables, and most importantly, teaching me to do the same. When I asked, “Why can’t we just go to the store?” or “Why can’t we ask a neighbor to help?” I was always met with the same response. “If you can’t do something yourself, you may as well be surrendering.” I had no* I *dea what that meant. All I knew, my grandpa made great food, let me stay up as late as I wanted, and taught me how to shoot a gun. For a little boy, it was paradise. I remember one fall day, he was showing me how to bait a fish hook when he suddenly stopped and said.*

*“If I dropped dead tomorrow and left you here all alone, would you be able to survive?”*

*The question frightened me. At just 8 years old, I didn’t want to think about grandpa dying, or leaving me alone like my parents had done, but his eyes were blazing into mine, and I knew he wanted a serious answer.*

*“Yeah,” I said, slowly. “I might not be able to do everything, but I could.”*

*“What couldn’t you do?”*

*I considered that. “Bake cookies,” I decided. “I’m too little to use the stove.”*

*Grandpa laughed at his own words floating up from my mouth. He stood. “Let’s go. I’ll show you how.”* 

*That’s how my childhood went. If I didn’t know something, I sat down, and was taught how, each part explained and pointed out until I could do it myself with my eyes closed.*

*Most would consider Charles McPherson an oddball, a hermit, a peculiar old man who refused to get with the times or adapt. I considered him a hero, and I could never get enough of everything both he and the woods had to offer.*  

*One day, he dragged me out of bed at the crack of dawn and we took a hike through Lakecrest Forest Preserve, which was no more than a quarter mile walk from the house. I wasn’t happy to be up so early by any means, but it made my grandpa happy, and the rising sun looked radiant through the pine trees. The orangey-pink rays of light couldn’t quite push through the branches all the way, so the forest floor resembled a kaleidoscope, shimmery and shifting. It was beautiful.  I asked him where we were going, why we had to go out so early, and if his old age was finally getting to him, but I got no response besides a stern look over his shoulder at the last one. We wound through pine trees and oak trees and thick brush, until after a few minutes of walking, we reached a break in the forest. It was a small clearing, no more than 6 feet in width. There was nothing noticeable special about it, just some mossy earth and a pile of rocks sitting on one side. I looked at my grandpa, waiting for him to say something.*

*When he didn’t, I ven*T *ured, “Is there a reason we’re here?”*

*“Isn’t there a reason for everything I teach you, boy?” He huffed, squinting his brilliant blue eyes at me. “Just enjoy the beauty of nature, God’s creation.”*

*I made a show of looking left, right, up, and down. “Where’s the beauty, grandpa? All that’s here are trees. Why don’t we go back to the other place to watch the sun come up?”*

*“My ancestors built our house, you know.” said grandpa, completely ignoring what I said.*

*“Yes I know. You’ve told me a million times.”*

*“And they built that well over there.”* 

*I saw no well in the clearing, and it took me a minute before I realized he was talking about a pile of moss-eaten, crumbling stones sitting on the opposite end of the clearing.* 

*“That was a well?”*

*“A poorly made one,” he grumbled. “The new well by the house is much better, but that one didn’t collapse because of a bad construction job.”*

*“What the hell are you talking about?”*

*“Language. The old well fell a long time ago. That’s what happens when uou go against nature.” Without another word, grandpa turned back the way we came and started marching down the trail.* 

*Glancing at the stone pile, I jogged after him. I had absolutely no idea what he was talking about, if his words meant anything or if they were just the ramblings of an old man, slowly losing his mind.*

Sorry for the shorter post, but that’s the first section. I just checked to see how long section 2 is, but it turns out it’s locked, and so are all the other sections too. I figure he must have left a password somewhere on the laptop, but I pretty much scoured it earlier so I have no idea. If anyone has a guess, I’d love to know what you think.  Thanks.
