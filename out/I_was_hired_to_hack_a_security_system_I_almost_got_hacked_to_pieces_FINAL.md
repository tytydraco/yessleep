When we finally made it, I could see that our target wasn’t an ordinary building. Ten stories at least, with a big sign outside that said AVARICE CORP.

Motherfucker…

”Nobody told me these bastards would be here, too.” I mumbled, looking at the huge, heavy glass doors with no telling what was beyond. 

“They’ve got their hands in everything, no matter what universe you’re in.” Beard mentioned, moving up to the doors and testing them. To our surprise they gave almost immediately. No locks, no blockade… nothing. 

“Seems a little convenient.” I mumbled. “So where do we need to go in here?”

”Sub-level three.” Scar mentioned, moving in first, gun raised at the ready for anything that may be waiting. “You gonna be able to get us in?”

I nodded, “Depending on what’s guarding it, shouldn’t be an issue.”

”Good. Let’s move.” Beard said. Simmons let me into the building before following up the rear, keeping his gun up for anything that may come our way. At the other side of the lobby was a wall of elevators. Though if they were running was a different question. A light flickered somewhere off to the right, leading down another hallway with a sign marking stairs somewhere along the way.

We pushed the button on the elevators, but no light came on. After waiting a moment, we realized we were going to have to take the long way. 

“Goddamn I hate stairs.” Simmons grunted as we went along. The stairwell was curved and narrow, ensuring we had to go one at a time, single file, to descend. It was going to be cramped, and if something attacked in here we were more likely to hit each other with friendly fire than we were to hit whatever might be attacking.

”Run, don’t fight.” Beard nodded as we went down. Footsteps echoed loud on the smooth concrete as we descended, blinking red lights the only thing to illuminate our way. Somewhere far off, I could hear a scream from one of the creatures. Whether it was one singular like we found first upon arrival or one of the amalgamations though… I don’t know. I hope it’s the former.

After a few minutes of walking we finally made it to a door marked S-3, our destination. When we entered we could sense that there was something amiss. Glass was broken on the floor, with a red emergency light blinking in time with a blaring alarm somewhere deeper in. The main door was ripped from the hinges, a keypad next to it rendered useless.

”Guess I won’t need to get us in…” I muttered, somewhat relieved. I could hack systems back home but god knows if they were going to be the same in this.. universe? Reality? Now that I think of it, I was sent in here with no guarantee that any of my knowledge would transfer over. Kind of shit planning on their part.

We head through the door, lights shining off all-white walls interrupted by the occasional glare of red from emergency lights on the ceiling. I started to grow uneasy when we passed by the unhinged door lying on the ground. There’s no way something human could have done that. Even a damn truck wouldn’t t be able to tear that thing off and get it this far away from where it was supposed to be. Whatever it was, I’m hoping we don’t end up running into it…

Hallways twisted and turned as we followed them, trying to find the right door. Occasional windows into labs showed scenes of disarray, with test tubes and tables flipped and scattered all over the place. Every so often there was a spray of blood dried on the wall, or a congealed puddle on the floor, but nothing in sight that could have caused it.

”In here.” Scar grunted, leading us into a small, non-windowed room a little ways past the last lab. We went through what was once an airlock, moving into a small storage room full of freezers. As Beard rummaged through, looking through the various freezers for whatever we were after, I swear I heard a scream come from somewhere else in the building. Scar must have heard it too, because he moved back towards the door, motioning for SImmons to follow as they raised their guns, looking back at Beard, “Be quick, alright?”

”Way ahead of you.” He grunted back, pulling a vial from the back of one of the freezers. He set it down on the table, grabbing something out of his pack, a small case to put it in. As the vial snapped into the container, a loud roar echoed through the empty halls of the facility. “Ah hell.”

”What the fuck was that?” Simmons whispered. The roar came again. This one didn’t sound like the others, the screams of the creature back in the supermarket… this sounded like a beast. A creature made to prey, announcing that we were officially in its hunting grounds. 

“Whatever it is, this is probably where it was made…” I muttered, moving past the others towards the door. “Not sure about you fellas, but it’s not something I want to run into. Especially if it’s worse than what we’ve already seen.”

”Amen to that, brother.” Beard said, putting the vial container back into his bag before following me out the door, hefting his own gun at his shoulder now. “Let’s get the hell home, boys.” 

We all started down the hallway, making our way back towards the stairs. The trip out of the facility was… quiet. I honestly thought we were going to make it out without any issue, go down to the extraction point and be home free… I’ve got to stop assuming these kinds of things. 

Scar was on point leading us up the stairs when the thing attacked. I don’t even know how far away it was or… well, what the hell it was. All I know is that Scar was there one second, light shining forward and gun at the ready. The next moment, he’s being hoisted up over us with huge tendrils of red piercing through him, lifting him up forcefully as they tore through his body. 

“Get out of here!” Scar shouted at us as we gawked at him. I felt Beard shove me from behind, moving me closer to the door. Whatever was holding onto Scar, it was further up on the stairs above. He desperately tried lifting his gun to fire at it, but before he could get a shot off, the tendrils looped back around, stabbing through his torso again before tearing him clean in half at the midsection. It tossed him down the middle of the stairwell as we ran past, the life draining form his eyes as he fell.

We ran out of the stairwell and slammed the door shut behind, dropping over whatever we could find in front of it to block this thing from coming after us. Rushing to the front doors, we threw them open and walked out into the street only to find that the sky above had opened up, pouring down rain that was now flooding the streets. 

“That’s not helpful at all…” Simmons asked, looking both ways up and down the street. Our extraction point was a few buildings down to our left right across the road. It doesn’t look like we’re going to able to get there while staying dry though. Lightning suddenly flashed, illuminating the dark city around through the rain, with a loud boom of thunder following only seconds after.

”Might work to our advantage.” I said, noticing the smell of rot was much less intense now that the rain was covering it. With any luck, this could cover our movement. Maybe those things didn’t like being out in the rain. Wishful thinking, anyway. I pulled the pistol from my waistband, preparing for what may be ahead of us.

”Alright, it’s a yellow building we’re looking for. It’s an electronics store. Our extraction point is the door leading into their inventory room, they’re going to open the portal there.” Beard said, staring Simmons and I both down. “Head straight in. Hopefully portal is already open but if not we use that as base camp until it does. Whatever we do, we make it back home, dammit.”

We nodded in return, though I could tell Simmons was on the same hopeless wavelength I was. Either way, we had to do what we could. Rain pounding the pavement around us, we headed out to the street, ready to make the run to safety.

Talk about bad timing with this storm… the wind was howling, more lightning and thunder coming along with it. I was drenched to the bone within seconds after we stepped out, barely making it through the doorway before wind blew heavy rain right inside at us. Water flowed into the sewer grates all around us, already starting to flood the pipes below.

Thunder struck at the same time as the window above us broke, glass shattering everywhere and falling around us mingled with the rain. We kept running, barely taking a second to look back as something dropped to the street behind us, letting out a massive, angry roar. 

I was unfortunate enough to look back right as lightning flashed. This thing was huge, at least ten feet tall, and perched on all fours on the street as rain fell all around it. 

The thing was… well, I think it was human at one time. The features on the face appeared human-like, with a clear eyes, nose, and… I can’t necessarily say mouth because there were no lips of any kind. It looked like the skin just split, showing off hundreds of needle-like teeth lined and smiling. It was long and lithe, pale flesh shining as the rain dripped from it, totally bald with no clothes on, either. It was on all fours, long, lithe fingers holding it up while what appeared to be a tail with a huge stinger at the end curled up at the ready above it. I couldn’t tell very well in the brief light that I had, but it’s eyes appeared a clear blue, and I could swear it was sniffing us out as the rain fell around us. 

I turned away, just willing my feet to pump harder against the pavement as I ran, desperate to get the hell away from whatever this damned thing was. Unfortunately it seemed most of our luck had begun to run out. The thing behind us let out another roar, and from nearly every building all around, the undead began to pour out, not a care given to where they were jumping to, falling from windows and running out of doors with loud crashes that made the thunder seem like a murmur. 

“Oh hell…” I mumbled, desperately breathing to keep the oxygen flowing in my veins. Sitting in a cell for years now had me out of shape at this point, opting to rather read and sleep than work out in the prison yard. I was never much for exercise in the first place anyway. Now I was regretting that though, my lungs screaming as we ran. 

I could hear this thing behind us, and looked back against my better judgement. I thought the hordes of zombies falling to the street around us would keep it from getting too close too quickly, but it had the same idea. Instead of walking on the street, it was jumping over the tops of cars and onto the sides of buildings, sticking to them like a spider as it came closer to us. I was doing all I could just to dodge any of the undead now baring their teeth at us, barely able to keep up with what was happening as is. Before I knew what was happening, Simmons had shoved me out of the way as the big creature came down, the stinger tearing through his abdomen, where I had been only moments before.

”Shit!” He shouted as blood gushed from his mouth. He held a hand over the wound, using his other to spray the creature with bullets. It pulled the stinger back, leaving a gaping hole in Simmons midsection, before suddenly sprouting dozens of tendrils from its back. Simmons looked to me, mouthing for me to run as the tendrils stabbed into him, draining him of his life force. The creature gave another shriek, seemingly pleased with what it had done. I ran, putting my head down and staring at Beard’s feet as we went, desperate to make it out of this fucking nightmare.

Bodies splattered around us as we continued to run, almost to our destination. As the rain picked up once more, I looked to the nearby buildings, trying to see if we had made it. A yellow building, huge sign reading CIRCUIT TOWN on the side, was right there, glass doors with a sign that said “Come in, we’re open!” Hanging down inviting us in. We desperately threw ourselves against it;, forcing the door open the wrong way and breaking through the glass. 

We didn’t have time to feel safe yet, as zombies began to stand and give chase, running after us through the broken door.Beard and I both popped shots off at them, desperate to get some distance before they were able to get their own bites in at us. Finally, Beard and I both scrambled to our feet, desperate to find some way to block them coming in. At this point they were forcing past each other to get through, squeezing each other through the small space to get in here after us. We each grabbed the end of a shelf unit nearby, dragging it over to block off what we could and keep a barrier between us and the outside. It only lasted a moment before the zombies were the least of our problems again though, with the massive creature pushing through to come after us once more.

Beard shrugged his pack off, tossing it over to me. I could only look at him as he hefted his gun towards the shelf that was keeping us safe.

”The hell you doing, man?” I asked, stepping back, looking around desperately for the door. 

“You’re going through first, kid. Just in case I don’t make it, you can get the objective back home.” He said, steeling himself and putting a finger on the trigger. He popped off two shots, dropping two of the zombies that were climbing over the barrier with well placed shots to the forehead. “Now move!”

I nodded, turning to look around. I headed towards the back of the store, past aisles of DVD players, televisions, radios, and printers, searching for anything that could lead us back home. I finally saw it, a door set into the back wall. Just in time as I heard the shelves guarding the front door suddenly go flying into the side wall, pushed aside by the creature as it started ducking through the broken doorway.

”It’s here,. I see it!” I shouted to Beard. He popped more shots off, hitting the creature right in the forehead but doing nothing to it. It absorbed the bullets like they were nothing. Not a good sign…

As I neared the door I sensed something wasn’t right. It looked plain, and as I pushed on it, swinging the metal in on double sided hinges, nothing happened. I didn’t feel that electric charge, didn’t emerge in my own dimension, nothing. We were still here, in the electronics store surrounded by the undead and whatever this damn thing was. I turned, shouting again, “No good! Portal isn’t open!”

”Bastards…” I heard Beard mutter under his breath before popping more shots off. He was doing everything to try and keep this thing at bay, realizing headshots wouldn’t work. He tried to take it out at the kneecaps to no avail, it just kept inching towards us on all fours, like a giant cat stalking prey as it walked ever closer. The stinger over its back began to curl, brushing the rough tile on the ceiling as it bobbed, getting ready to make the stab at whichever of us looked easier.

”Any backup ideas?” I asked.

”Just hold out till they open that damn door.” Beard grunted back. He fired again, center mass this time, but to no avail still. 

He pulled something off his belt, and it took me until he raised it to his mouth, biting off a pin to realize it was a grenade. He tossed it at the thing, pushing me backwards and slinging the door closed behind him. I barely had time to think before the boom rocked both of us, sending the door flying inward and knocking us both backwards. The thing roared, angry at the pain it must have caused. Despite the explosion though, i could still hear it coming closer as even more zombies poured in through the door behind it. 

“Come on, open the damn door!” He shouted, punching the air and struggling back to his feet. My ears were ringing from. the blast, but I struggled to mine as well. I felt woozy, uneasy as the smell of rot began to pervade this place again. When the hell are they going to open up that door? We got what we came for, but we can’t get it back home if they don’t bring us back! Son of a bitch, I really don’t want to die here.

Suddenly a purple light began to pulse from behind us, the other side of the small inventory room. Did we have the wrong door? Did they have to make a last minute change? Either way, Beard and I shared a look, understanding that our extraction point had changed by at least a few feet, but there was our way our, finally. We both started to run as the creature burst through the door behind us, 

I dove through first, landing almost face first on the ground on the other side. The pack landed beside me, clanking as the vial container inside rustled around. The smell of rot was finally gone though, instead the building was filled with the smell of dust and maybe some mold, though I was honestly thankful for it. 

“We fuckin’ made it.” I laughed, pushing myself up off the ground and looking behind me. Beard was standing in front of the door, still looking back with his gun raised at it. 

“Shut it! Now!” He shouted to the men around us. One moved over to a small console that was set up nearby, inputting commands that transmitted to small bars placed around the door. The deep purple electricity in the opening began to dim, growing faint as the transporter mechanism started to shut down. Beard began to lower his gun, a sigh escaping as we were nearly home free.

The stinger of the creature darted right through the closing portal, stabbing right into Beard’s chest as the portal fully shut down, severing it. Instead of dropping to the ground though, it hung limp from the soldier, one side severed and hanging while the other dangled out of his back. He gave a slight laugh at the ridiculousness of the situation, “Son of a bitch…”

He collapsed, blood beginning to pool on the floor around him as his eyes closed.

I started to get up but could only fall back, looking at the dead body now in front of me. It must have hit a vital organ, because he wasn’t even breathing anymore, the last hint of life just a long, drawn out rasp as the last air escaped his lungs. 

“Jesus Christ…” I said, only staring at the body. I realized a moment later that I was still holding my pistol. As I began to stand up, getting ready to holster it and get the hell out of here, his body began to twitch again. 

Before I knew what was happening he seized, body arching up, almost breaking his back in half as he gasped in as much air as he could. It was raspy, and coming out in short bursts. His face contorted in pain, a scream ripping from his lungs now as his lower jaw began to force itself apart at the midpoint of his chin,.It split, leaving long sinew and teeth with no place to go as it continued down his neck, opening his entire upper body wide as it descended. The bones of his rib cage began to crack and distort, piercing through his skin as they turned to long,, hooked teeth ready to devour any of us if he could only reach.

I don’t know if it was exhaustion or respect for the man who got me through this nightmare ordeal, but I decided that it needed to be fast. Raising the pistol, I popped two shots in his head to be sure. Within moments, his body ceased seizing, falling back limp on the ground as the pool of blood began to grow, seeping further out on the smooth concrete floor.

The agents with us didn’t say anything, only offering to take my gun as one guided me through the doors, back towards a waiting car that would take me back to their headquarters.

Once I get there they’ll probably debrief me, ask me what happened to the rest of the team sent. I’ll tell them about all of it. not much sense in keeping a secret about any of this, anyway.

Whatever is in this bag, whatever they sent us in there after… I hope it was worth it. I’m going to get my freedom now, but I don’t think I’m ever going to be free of what happened over there. Whatever Avarice is doing here… well, I’m glad it didn’t turn into that. I must have barely scratched the surface when I blew the whistle.

Guess it’s time to start thinking about where I want to disappear to. Definitely not a big city, not after all of that. Maybe the countryside. Maybe the mountains. Yeah, the mountains sound [nice](https://www.reddit.com/u/googlyeyes93/s/IAr9AMPCeg)…
