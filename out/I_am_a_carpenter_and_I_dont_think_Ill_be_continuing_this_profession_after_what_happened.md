I am a carpenter, and I don’t think I’ll be continuing this profession after what happened. I’ve been a carpenter for five years, and I’m 25. It runs in my family—my dad and his dad were both carpenters as well. It’s a pretty boring occupation, but I’ve always felt proud that I was carrying on a legacy.

You may be asking yourself: *what could possibly happen that would make someone stop a family legacy?* I didn’t think anything could either… until it happened.

Let me back up.

When everything started, I was at my one-bedroom apartment. It was a gloomy yet beautiful day—you know, when the fog is out, making everything more gray but cozy, and all you want to do is crawl into bed and watch a movie. Well, that’s exactly what I was doing until I got a call from a man named Glenn Peterson.

I knew of him because I’d seen his billboards all over town. I think he’s a lawyer, but I never paid close attention to the billboards to know for sure. Anyway, I picked up the phone, and he very quickly started telling me about a wine spill on his wood floor and how he needed someone to replace it. He sounded frantic, like he was running from something while calling me.

I said I could do it. “When would you like to schedule this?” I asked—*deep down hoping he wouldn’t say today.*

He said, “Tonight would be perfect.”

I rolled my eyes and said, “Okay, what time?”

“10 p.m.,” he replied.

I told him, “Why can’t I just come now?” But he insisted that I come at 10, promising a hefty tip. I was short on money, so I figured this would be a good opportunity.

I was horribly wrong.

At 9:30, I packed my gear for the job and walked outside. It was very dark, almost like the moon had disappeared, and I couldn’t see any stars. I chalked it up to the fog I’d seen earlier and got into my car. The drive was about 25 minutes, so I started driving.

As I got closer to his house, it seemed like all signs of civilization had simply vanished. This creeped me out a bit, but I needed the money, so I kept going until I arrived.

I pulled up to the house, and upon closer examination, it was huge. It looked gray, pretty modern honestly. I furthered my gaze to the front door, and I could already see Glenn waving at me. I hopped out of my car with my gear and approached him.

As I was walking up to him, I instinctively looked at his pockets for any weapons. I’ve always been a very anxious guy who tries to see the bad in everything—it’s only to protect myself, though.

When I got about three feet away from him, he stuck out his hand for me to shake. I firmly grabbed it and looked him in the eyes. His eyes looked dead, like he was sleepwalking. I thought it was weird, but I just shrugged it off as him being tired.

I asked him where the spill was, and he showed me inside.

As I walked in, it felt like I stepped into a time machine. Everything in the house looked very old—as if someone had taken an abandoned house and only fixed up the outside. It was weird. I already felt out of place, but I kept walking behind him.

When we got to the area with the spill, he just walked up to it, pointed, and then walked away without saying a single word.

Now, this really freaked me out, because before I could say anything, he was already out the door to the room, and I was completely alone.

I turned on the light and saw the red stain. I pulled out my gear and told myself, *“Okay, fix it quickly, then get the fuck out of here.”* I wasn’t trying to stay long.

But before I started, I decided to take a quick look around the room. The walls—what used to be white—were now yellowed. There were a couple of paintings on the walls, and that was about it, besides some old chairs.

I started working, cutting the carpet as fast as I could, when I got this cold shiver of dread down my spine. It made me stop and slowly check my surroundings, inspecting everything carefully. I gripped my box cutter knife—just in case.

That’s when I started to hear floorboards creaking, like someone was carefully sneaking toward the door. I decided to peek my head out to see what was happening.

I creaked the door open, and what was once a well-lit hallway was now pitch black. It took my eyes a second to adjust, but that’s when I saw it.

It was a man—I couldn’t tell who—but he was in yellowed, stained underwear, crouched in a weird position, like one of those old cartoon characters trying to sneak around. He didn’t seem fazed at all that I saw him. In fact, I think he *smiled*.

Before I could say anything, he started running at me—on all fours—like a fucking animal.

That snapped me out of my shock. I made a dash the other way. I could hear his galloping, crawling form behind me, and it only gave me more adrenaline to run faster. I felt pure *terror* in that moment.

I made it to the stairs and saw the front door. I could hear him closing in on me. I knew this was my one chance. I ran down the stairs, skipping three steps with every stride. I made it to the door and felt the cold metal of the knob in my hand.

I used all my energy to fling it open and sprint to my car like never before.

I made it to my car and opened the door as fast as possible. The entire time, I never looked back—in fear of seeing whatever was behind me. But when I got into the car and slammed the door, I looked back at the front of the house.

Glenn was standing there. Waving. Exactly like he had been when I first arrived.
