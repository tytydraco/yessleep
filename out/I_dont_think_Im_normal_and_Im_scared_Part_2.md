I didn’t know what to say. I didn’t know what to *think* even.

*Emily knows my biological mom?*

“Why didn’t you tell me before?” I asked.

Emily’s smile was as thin as ice. “I didn’t think you were ready. Now you are.”

“Ready for what?”

“You’ll know soon enough. Sleep tight, Skye. You have to go to school tomorrow.”

I couldn’t sleep. All I saw, in my nightmares and painted on the ceiling, was Alfie’s face. He whispered my name while I dreamed and wriggled into my happiest memories. I woke up screaming as his body twisted and swelled.

*We will meet again.* Alfie hissed through a series of clicks.

It was too quiet when I woke up the next morning. I was used to Emily yelling for me to wake up for school or my dad rushing to get dressed for work and brushing his teeth or the smell of burned bacon and pancakes and eggs down from the kitchen. Or at the very least Alfie ringing my ears off to tell me he was waiting too long outside.

But the silence whispered through the halls, sneaking into my room and tickling my heart. I rubbed my eyes and sat with my knees tucked against my chest, watching the sun rise. The sky was lit in gold as the darkness slithered away, but it was as if dawn had never arrived at all.

I got dressed and headed downstairs. At that point I realised exactly *why* the house was so quiet and my heart stopped cold.

Most of the stuff we owned was packed up into boxes; and anything that was too big was covered by translucent tarps. Emily and my dad were huddled together in the kitchen. They looked so lost, so hollow, like they’d just come back from Alfie’s funeral and had not stopped crying since.

“Hey morning,” I said tersely. 

“Morning,” Emily said. She still wasn’t looking at me. “Did you sleep well or do you still look like a panda bear?”

“Ha ha.” I made myself some coffee. It tasted like muddy water.

Emily looked at the clock. “You better hurry up or you’ll be late for school, Sleepy Skye.”

“But—” The night before was still spinning in my mind. Questions bubbled to the back of my throat, dying on my lips.

Emily placed a hand on my shoulder.

“Don’t worry, Skye. I’ll explain more later when the time is right.”

School felt like forever. All of my classes passed in a blur. Everyone avoided me like the plague, and whispered behind their hands when I walked past. I didn’t really care. I rested my head on my hands and wished Alfie was here. Whispering that everything would be okay.

*Creak*

When the last bell rang I plodded through the halls. The chatter around me had blended into a monotonous stream of nothing. I looked around me and saw Alfie’s face around me, in the couples making out near the lockers, in the teenagers huddled together like penguins.

My heart ached again.

*Alfie…*

My dad’s van was waiting for me at the school entrance, coughing up smoke like an old, retired dragon. It was jammed full of boxes and things wrapped in bubble paper. I was surprised it could even move a *centimetre* without something breaking inside.

“Hop in Skye,” said my dad, poking his head out of one window.

“Um, where are we going?”

“To my old place,” Emily explained, poking her head out of the other window. “I—*we*—thought it would be good for you, for…for the both of us.”

“After…after…y’know.”

*Alfie died.*

The wind was still once more, as if mourning over him in its deep grief too. I crumbled against the side of the van, letting hot tears stream down my cheeks.

*Alfie…*

Without a word more I climbed into the van and my dad sped off immediately. I gazed outside the window, watching country roads blend into billboards and highways, and let the van rock me into a soothing sleep.

“We’re here. Wake up, Sleepy Skye.”

Emily’s house, as it turned out, was a two-storey monster tucked away from the heart of the city. The paint was peeling away and the bricks underneath were slick with slime. Mold crawled between the bricks and stayed there, dying the house green. I turned away and nearly threw up.

“This way,” Emily said, climbing a set of stairs. It was really dark, and everything was covered in shadow. The only source of light was a small Gothic window that shone through the gloom in a weak white arm. Set at the side of the stairwell was a black iron door. I started towards it, but Emily glared at me, so I abandoned the door and followed her.

The second floor was surprisingly well-kept. The floors were swept and the walls clean of dust. Picture frames depicting bugs and scarabs hung onto the wall, polished until it shone. There was even a pot of tea on the table.

“Knock yourself out,” Emily said as she collapsed onto the couch. She closed her eyes.

“Make yourself at home.”

“It stinks,” I observed, wrinkling my nose.

In fact it was the worst stink I had ever smelled in my life. It tore through the walls and floors like it was made of paper and I gagged. I sprinted to the window, stuck my head out and breathed in relief.

Emily raised an eyebrow.

“There’s some…*construction* going on downstairs,” she explained. “We just got here, so bear with it a little longer, okay Skye?”

“Yeah,” I choked. My eyes were watering. If I could see the smell it would be a big black cloud hovering in the air, howling and shaking in its stinky fury.

“Can I explore the city? I need some fresh air.”

“Go ahead,” Emily said, turning away. “Just be back for dinner.”

I nodded. I had never sprinted out of my old house so fast in my life, rubbing my smarting eyes. Even at the distance I could smell it, and once again I felt like throwing up.

After some time I slowed to a walk and really started to look around. It wasn’t much of a city—and it also wasn’t much of a town—but somewhere in between. It was getting quite late in the day with the sun streaming slowly in from the west, but the town felt…*alive* in a way. Shopkeepers hollered their wares from the inside of their ornate walls, and people were strolling on the streets, their arms interlocked laughing and whistling.

I tried not to think of Alfie.

A couple of blocks away I saw a large diner, its neon sign beckoning me inside. Getting closer I could smell heaven: char-grilled meats, fresh cakes and cookies, and something else in a fryer or oven.

My stomach growled. I wiped off my drool with my sleeves.

Pushing the door open, I went in.

The diner was abuzz with chatter and laughter; people were toasting each other with glasses of beer and ale. Yet everything died the moment I came in. Time stood still; heads swiveled to look at me and a collective gasp rose from the frozen crowd. I felt like an animal in a zoo as I navigated through the chaos and found a table to sit.

“Don’t mind ‘em.”

The speaker was a living Popeye, with a big, floppy nose and bigger arms that bulged with muscles and fat and a tattoo of a beetle instead of an anchor. He was wearing a greasy, bloody apron and a cap that was too small for a nest of blonde hair. 

“It’s been a while since we had anyone new around here. Thirteen years, in fact. Also, hold on…”

He squinted hard at me, his eyes moving from my head down to my legs.

“Are you Skye?”

Goosebumps pricked my skin once more. I looked outside and realised the wind had once again stood still.

“Yes! How do you know?”

The man opposite me thought for a moment, then shouted something to the kitchens. Then he sat down opposite me and grinned, revealing yellowed teeth.

“Your stepmom talks about you a lot. She adores you, you know.”

He cupped my head in his hands and brushed a lock of hair off my head. Tears welled in his eyes.

“You look a lot like your mom. Same face, same eyes.”

He knocked on my face like it was a piece of wood.

*Click clock*

“Rock solid too.”

My hair stood up on my skin as I stared straight into the eyes of this man who I just met.

“Y-you know my biological mom too?”

The man’s smile grew even wider. “Let’s just say…kind of.”

He extended his hand. “I’m sorry I haven’t introduced myself earlier. Call me Mr Lancaster. I’m the owner here.”

“I’m pleased to meet you too,” I replied, shaking his hand.

“Boss? Everything is ready.”

One of the waiters skidded to a halt near our table. He was a handsome youth—freckles and curly red hair. He held out a huge plastic bag to me.

Mr Lancaster smiled at me in a way that made my heart melt.

“Fish and chips. And I threw in some strawberry milkshakes as well. It’s one of our best dishes on the menu. Emily is always going on and on about how crazy you are for ‘em.”

“Wow! Thank you Mr Lancaster!”

“It’s on the house too. A welcome gift from me. Tell your stepmom she doesn’t have to pay back a single cent.”

He glanced out at the darkening sky, sweat mopping his brow.

“You better be going now. It’s getting late. See you soon, Skye. You’re always welcome here.”

And with that, he practically shoved me out of the door.

The bell tinkled as I stumbled onto the street, nearly tripping over the food. It was really heavy, mind you. Like a thousand dumb-bells made out of solid gold. By the time I reached my flat my arms ached.

I dropped the takeaway on the floor and sat down on one of the stairs to rest. The sun had completely set at this point; long, thin shadows crawled across the wall to the corners. Soon I was plunged in darkness. I could barely see my hand in front of my face.

My vision suddenly cleared, and I realised I could see. Somehow. Dark shapes shifted and twisted before my eyes, but I could still make out details of every brick, every scratch on the stairs and wall. The takeaway sat untouched before me.

It was like looking through an extremely grainy CCTV.

**BANG BANG BANG!**

As the bangs echoed throughout the hallway I froze, the excitement of my discovery gone.

**BANG BANG BANG!**

**SKYYYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEE!**

My name was shouted with great abandon, the call tinged with sorrow and pain. I inched closer and realised that it was coming from the iron door.

**SKYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEE!**

Whoever was calling me was thrashing against the door, making the hinges shake. I backed away, my heart in my throat. All the hair on my skin was standing up straight.

**BANG BANG BANG!**

The stink slapped me in the face, making my nose itch. My eyes didn’t leave the door as I scrambled up the stairs to the main apartment, leaving everything in the dust.

It was only when I slammed the door behind me and sprinted down the hallway to my bedroom did I realise I forgot the takeaway still sitting at the bottom of the stairs.

*Oh well* I told myself, trying to calm my shaking heart. *I can go back in a few minutes.*

*I’m sure Emily and Dad won’t mind.*

The city had fallen asleep. The hustle and bustle seemed to have vanished with the last of the sun. The streets were illuminated faintly with lamps that shone like a halo. My room looked like it belonged in a horror movie.

I lay on my bed for a while, squeezing my eyes shut and listening to my heart beat. The screams had long died down, but I somehow heard them long and clear in my mind, as if blasted by an invisible loudspeaker.

**SKYEEEEEEE!**

Low and loud, like a foghorn from a ship lost at sea.

**SKYEEEEEEEEE!**

“Shut up!” I screamed, my eyes welling with tears. I curled up in a ball and squeezed my head with my pillow. Even then the screams rammed against the sides of my head, over and over again, and I was dizzy from the pain.

Eventually I got out of bed and wandered throughout the house, hoping for something to distract myself from the eternal noise. The apartment was shaded in the same grainy darkness, except for the dining-room, which was glowing invitingly like a crackling campfire. Something clanged and tinkled. Cutlery probably. Either Emily or my dad setting the table. My stomach grumbled. The smell from the diner was making me hungry.

I started towards the dining room but then I heard it. A strange chitter-chatter. Like crickets, even though we lived so far from nature.

It was coming from the pictures hanging on the wall. 

I hadn’t paid much attention to them when I first came in, but now it was drawing me closer like a moth to a flame. The bugs chittered again, and their legs twisted and struggled, almost like it was *dancing*. Looking closer, I realised that all the pictures depicted the same figure. A woman in various poses with the head of a bug with too-large eyes. She was wearing a dress that shone like fire and was glaring at the camera.

“Mom?”

I clapped my hand over my mouth. I didn’t *know* where that came from. I looked nothing like her. I didn’t know her. It was my first time seeing her.

*But Alfie…*

No, no, no! I’m mad! I must be going mad! It’s the screams, I thought, the screams were driving me cuckoo! Making me think crazy thoughts!

I forced myself to look away and shove those thoughts out of my mind. I didn’t know what to believe anymore.

“Skye? Dinner time!”

Emily’s calls broke through the confusing mess in my head. I was grateful that she came to my rescue. Glancing back at the photo of my mum (no, she isn’t! How can I be related to…*that?*), I scurried down the hallway and into the dining room.

***
Emily had saved the takeaway.

It sat between us on the newly-dusted table. Emily pulled out foil containers and set one each before me and my dad. 

“Mr Lancaster called about the fish and chips,” she explained. “He was delighted to have met you, Skye.”

She ruffled my hair, and chuckled as she handed me a strawberry milkshake. “But it looked like his little delivery girl got cold feet on her first order, eh?”

“Emily!” I groaned. I took a long sip and licked my lips. The milkshake was delicious. Rich, creamy and filled with enough sugar to make my insulin go straight into overdrive.

“Hey,” I noted, sitting down after a while. The pure *sweetness* of that drink was enough to make my head spin. “Mr Lancaster made some extra fish and chips.”

And it stank too. Almost as much as whatever is behind that iron door. 

“Oh, that’s nothing,” Emily said quickly, sweeping the bag off the table and rushing it to the kitchen. “Mr Lancaster always makes me extra. He knows I’m always hungry after midnight!”

I chuckled nervously, feeling the weight of my worries lift off my shoulders. Emily *did* eat a lot after midnight. A couple of times I had spotted her sneaking to the living room with the television on and a bag of chips.

Yet this particular container stuck out like a sore thumb. Not just the smell, or how big it was compared to the others, but…but, was it me or was it *glowing?*

I buried that thought into the deepest recesses of my mind. **No.** I had enough wild and crazy thoughts and visions for one night.

Succumbing to them was not what Alfie would have wanted.

That was not what any of us would have wanted.

Once we had finished dinner, I helped to clear the table and wash the cutlery. Emily turned to me and said:

“I’ve got some things to do tonight. Take care, Skye, and take care of your dad.”

“He does not look well.”

Sick actually. Dad looked like he was going to throw up. He staggered to the couch and passed out on the leather. I couldn’t help but pity him. Fifty-six years old, and all that oil into the fish and chips was not doing his heart any good.

“I’ll look after him,” I promised.

“Good girl.” Emily gave me another thin smile. She pulled on a jacket—a black jacket with a golden rim—and gave me a kiss on my forehead.

“I won’t be long.”

Emily strode out of the house, taking the last box of fish and chips with her. There was something clinking in her pocket, like suits or armor banging together. And *just* as she stepped out of the front door, she pulled out that something from her pocket. I only saw it for a brief second, but it was enough to make my heart race.

It was a key. But not just any key.

This one was black. Like evil. Like ash. Like the iron door.

It smirked at me as it hid back in her pocket. A shiver ran up my spine.

“Emily, wait!”

“Is there a problem, Skye?”

“Yeah. I wanna ask you something.”

I took a deep, shaky breath. There was a lump in my throat and my heart was beating way too fast.

“The iron door on the first floor…what’s behind it?”

“It’s nothing, Skye,” Emily said. Her eyes darted to somewhere behind me and fixed on one of the bug women. “Just some of my old stuff, y’know? From before I met your dad?”

“Right…”

“Now I have to go. I’ll be late otherwise. I’ll see you later, okay Skye?”

I swallowed as I watched her leave. Uncertainty still sat tight in my stomach, wound up like a spring, and wouldn’t let go.

“Dad? You okay?”

No response. My dad was out like a light. 

Then his eyes shot open.

I gulped.

They got bigger and bigger. I saw each individual vein popping out and weaving into each other like mini spider webs.

Then it bulged and swelled. His head enlarged to accommodate it.

Chills shot down my spine as I realised *exactly* what was going on.

“Dad?”

*Click click click.*

His lips split and burst into mandibles. I scrambled over and held his hand.

“Don’t do this to me. Don’t be like Alfie.”

I was crying. I was shaking. Oh god, I was shaking so bad it felt like I was in an earthquake.

*Click click click*

I scrambled over and held his hand. It only seemed to make it worse, however. I watched as it shrank and turned black and folded into itself.

“Dad! Fight it!”

He hunched over and coughed out so much more blood. 

*Ack ack ack*

“DAD!”

His spine was curving over and hardening into a black shell. I dropped his hand and backed away into a corner, my face white.

*Ack ack ack.*

The floor was blooming. Grass spread thin like a carpet and tall trees grew. I saw red flowers explode onto new branches, like a bundle of fireworks.

My dad clicked and clacked, as if *enjoying* the new scenery.

*No…*

My skin was crawling. Literally. I looked down and saw bumps pulsing beneath the folds, marching along to my heartbeat. Then it broke and a cockroach *popped* out. It took a deep breath, bowed, clicked and clacked in the same rhythm as my dad’s—slow and steady, a *pulse*—

And…

And I SWEAR I heard the cockroach say:

“Your Highness.”

I screamed. It bounced off new grass and fresh flora.

*I’m really going mad now.*

I pinched myself, wondering if I was living in some kind of nightmare. But I wasn’t. It was as real as the still lights from the street lamps shining in through the window.

*Click clack.*

More cockroaches were spilling out from my skin like a dam left unchecked. My dad looked at me inquisitively. Cement was quickly turning into dirt.

*Click clack*

My thoughts were clambering over each other as I squatted, paralysed in my corner, watching the cockroaches with my mouth open. My dad—no longer human—crawled into the walls and towards me. Staring at the roaches and slowly reaching out to them. They squeaked and climbed over him.

This was too much. I did the only thing I could think of. 

My phone was butter in my hands. My vision blurred and I kept on punching in the wrong numbers.

Thankfully, Emily answered the phone on the first ring.

I took a deep breath and screamed into the receiver. My voice was shaking so bad I was surprised I could say anything at all.
