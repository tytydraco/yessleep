My family is not what anyone would call interesting but, as all families do, we have our quirks. One of my uncles is an avid taxidermy collector, a cousin hasn’t worn shoes in at least seven years, and I am obsessed with recording every small aspect of our heritage. 

As an avid genealogist I have collected document after document of what most would consider mind-numbingly dull information. Primarily family trees, letters, and newspaper articles, but if you ask me, they’re as valuable as any keepsake. Anytime a family member discovers a new fragment of history in a storage container or attic, it makes its way to me.

I assumed that was how a particularly strange series of papers were left on my doorstep. This morning, when I opened my door to head to my local coffee shop I nearly broke my neck tripping over a line of boxes. 

At first, I assumed that some moron had decided to deliver something overnight and didn’t consider the fact that I might not look down when stepping out of my house. It wasn’t until, in a contained rage, I inspected them that I noticed the lack of shipping labels. My curiosity piqued, I carried them inside one by one. My plans for coffee abandoned, I broke into them, ecstatic to discover stacks of folders inside. Each was unlabeled, and only after reading a few did I realize they were handwritten or typed accounts. At this point I made the assumption that one of my uncles had stumbled on a treasure trove of family documents and been kind enough to leave them for me. 

I wasted no time picking out a folder and plopping down to read. At this point I’m in too deep. I don’t know what I have found here, but I’ve finished a few folders, and I’m starting to wonder. At this point, I just want to make sure I’m not alone in this. I need someone else to read what I have. To share the experience so that it might seem a little more mundane.

This particular writing was, from what I can tell, typed by my great uncle Johnathan Click. I was vaguely familiar with him prior to this, but only as a well-decorated detective with a number of New England police departments. He died of a heart attack in 1924. He was found on a barely driven road outside of a small port town called Drearsport. His brother had reported that Johnathan had gone to the town at his request to seek out his wayward son Jacob. Jacob was never found, but we all assumed he had simply gone on to live his life outside of the family. I’m starting to wonder.

These sheets smell awful. I’m not sure where they were stored but it was not dry enough. They are yellowed with age and reek of mildew and something like rotting fruit. Some of the words are hard to discern and many are mistyped but I did my best to translate them here. For the love of god, I hope this is fiction. 



The hammering of my typewriter is incessant as it clicks at an unstoppable pace, punctuated by brief periods of panicked sobs when my composure shatters. Each time I fail to maintain my silence I can not help but flash my eyes toward the window and then to the door as if the sound of typing is not as loud as the evidence of my dread. I stop only for brief moments, trembling hands snatching the filled sheet of paper from the guide and slamming it on top of the precariously leaning pile I have accrued in the previous hours. At least, I think it has been hours. The sound has come again; the footsteps outside my window. I am a flurry of vibrating hands and blank paper. I must keep typing even if my fingers move in a blur, which all but guarantees more mistakes in the resulting note than not. I pray to no particular god, just one that might listen and end the horror of the night I have found myself in. As if responding to my silent pleas, the footsteps have grown louder. Closer. They are nearly at the boards that had been hastily nailed over the only window in the small inn room. I will not scream. I must keep typing. 

I was not sure how long ago I had come to this pocket of hell they called Drearsport, though I began to fear I would never see the sun again. I hadn’t expected I would have ever left the confines of my retirement in Muncie but my curiosity always did cause more grief than it was worth. As a detective, before my senses caught me unaware and led me by the hand into the life of a civilian, it was a fine-edged razor with which I carved apart the minds of the rabble that inhabited New England in those times. Now there was only myself left to cut and cut myself I did. 

The Indiana seasons had been a welcome change from the harsh winters of New England but here I was again. Maine had not changed since 1894. The people still watched me with cold eyes and short words but were kind enough. Only the cities had evolved in the past three decades, though I didn’t plan on seeing much of those. I only meant to spend the minimal time required to reach Drearsport and find my nephew. 

The boy, Jacob, had not so much stumbled into the rebellious age of 19 as he had fallen straight down a mile-deep pit. His father seemed to write me every month or so with the latest update on the nonsense he had managed to tangle himself in. It began when he witnessed Jacob among a group of rather unsavory boys. An academic sort, if my brother is to be believed, adorning themselves with bizarre amulets and rings marked with an alien glyph of presumably blasphemous origin. The final letter had come only a week before I departed for the northeast in the fog of questions surrounding Jacob’s latest disappearance. 

“Johnathan,” the letter had been addressed, “I know I do not often write you in an optimistic fashion and I’m afraid now is no different. As I explained in my last letter, Jacob has decided it best to deepen his connection to those heathen occultists, which causes me great concern. Your nephew has spent the previous month collecting tomes and journals of all manners of strange. The latest that I saw sported a leather binding decorated with a queer depiction I can not quite translate to you. Suffice it to say it was the likeness of a peculiar man, or perhaps a woman, wrought in a pose much like that of Christ. I assure you, though, this was no Christian writing. A day or so after he had brought that book into my house he simply vanished, leaving only a brief note explaining he had decided it best to abscond to Maine, to a town called Drearsport, in order to further expand his blasphemous collection. Jonathan, you know I am not a superstitious man but I swear to you on mother and the good book, I have dreamt every night since of that damnable book. I haven’t had a proper night’s sleep in some days. I do not wish to disturb your well-earned retirement, but I know for a certainty that my boy has found himself in a situation that is detrimental to him. I am begging you. If I had conducted myself as a detective as you had I would go myself, but I fear carpenters make for poor investigators.” 

In truth, I didn’t have any interest in pursuing Jacob to Maine. I had an appointment with Mitchell Walsh that next week to do a bit of fishing and I intended to see myself suitably relaxed during it. Against my will, I found, I too was unable to find proper sleep. It was not thanks to some possessed book or demonic figure haunting my dreams. Instead, I found myself plagued with unbidden thoughts of a faraway home of the damned. After three nights of this, I set myself to a late-night rummage of the aged case notes I kept in my attic. Even now, I could not say what force it was that moved me to associate the documents in those forgotten boxes with a town I had never visited but I still ascended the ancient ladder motivated to pursue this end. 

I had not entered that cramped space since two summers prior when I was of a mind to uproot an old stump. It remained, since that time, a cityscape of forgotten boxes and gardening equipment. After three boxes of unrelated kidnappings, murders, and robberies, I found a thin yellow folder labeled “2219 Alice Lars.” The name was not familiar to me, but inside I found only two sheets of yellowing paper. The first listed the details of the woman before she had apparently gone missing in ‘91. The second was a handwritten note found in her room the night after her vanishing. “Drearsport,” it said, “I’m bound for the Ochre Sea.” My hands shook, producing the sound of rustling leaves, as I read the words again. It was nonsense when we had seen it all that time ago, I was sure, but at that moment, it was enough to ignite the flame of wonder I had extinguished years ago.

The next morning I had two bags packed and secured a train ticket to take me to Maine. From there, I intended to secure transport to wherever Drearsport could be found. I had spent all my life in Maine until the day I sold my childhood home and made my way to the Midwest with the purpose of slowly vanishing. As I sat, speeding back there, my gut clenched like a spasming fist remembering the words in that woman’s letter, “Drearsport, I’m bound for the Ochre Sea.” The queer nature of it made me wonder just what sort of town was this that I hurtled toward?

After a short hour into the journey, a man settled himself down next to me. I was of a mind to request he relocate himself into one of the many empty seats in our car or perhaps excuse myself to one such seat, but with my mind as flooded with puzzling and maze-like contemplations as it was, I neglected to do so. 

My nose wrinkled slightly at his presence. He wore a simple suit that had once been grey, or perhaps a light blue. Now, its surface was thick with a parchment-colored grime. Perhaps he had been traveling with such consistency that he never found the time to replace or wash the article, or his mind had simply left him to his basest means of thought. In either case, his scent was that of a stagnant pond having drowned some small animal. The thought of ridding myself of this character fled as I felt his eyes rest on me. His unblinking stare set my hair on end and my pulse racing away. The most I could manage was to turn my head to watch out the window at the blurring landscape. There was not much to see, but it was preferable to the sight of his slightly jaundiced eyes. I maintained this casual posture for only a minute before I felt the cold flesh of his hand brush the back of my neck. The grease thereupon clinging to my skin like the sap of a tree on the palm. I leapt in my skin at the sensation, turning in alarm. My hand shot to wipe away the vile film, and my mouth opened in the preparation of a tirade directed at this deplorable man, but I saw only the back of him fleeing to the next car. I counted myself blessed, for I was vilely shaken by the incident. After securing a rag from a passing attendant, I cleaned my neck and hand, which had inherited the mess from my instinctual wiping, and settled myself into an even closer position to the window. I intended to lay my bags atop the seat beside me to discourage any further oddities from strangers but saw, to my horror, that it too shone with a slight oily sheen. The faint scent of the man lingered there from and I was forced to pull my shirt over my nose to fend off the intrusive smell.

Despite all of this, I drifted off through my hours-long journey. In my sleep, though, I was plagued with images of drowning in muddy, urine-colored waters, a figure standing over me, just above the surface. There was malice in the way the water rocked my body. Then, I began to slowly rot away. The oozing waters licked at my flesh until it softened and pulled away in chunks, streaming deeply black blood as they floated out of sight and into the mire. I believe I screamed, though I do not recall. I do remember the laughter. I can not tell you if it was mine, though. As my body sloughed from me and into the murk, I saw a presence. There is no other word for it. It was simply there. I saw no defined shape but I knew that what I was looking upon was not simply the water that held my quickly dwindling body. It was something else. Something that felt and thought, and it wanted me.

I woke with a shriek that startled the attendant, who was unfortunate enough to be passing me at that very moment, to drop a full tray of drinks. Under normal circumstances, I would have assisted her in the cleaning of the mess but I was so troubled with the thoughts of my dream that I hardly noticed. For the remainder of the ride, I stared vacantly out of my window at the wooded terrain.

When I arrived in Brunswick I was hesitant to continue on with my plan. The visions I had seen, and by this time I had half convinced myself they were visions, and the encounter with that strange man troubled me enough to consider purchasing a return ticket on the spot. Instead, I steeled my resolve and pressed on. The grocery, just a few minutes walk from the train, was owned by a kind enough couple called the Morrisons who I got talking after only a bit of prodding. They didn’t seem too keen on talking about Drearsport as the notion that it was a backward hovel filled with fishermen and atheists of all the worst stock. “They’s got this church up there,” Mr.Morrison told me, “ain’t nothin’ no good Christian would build. Made all up of this yellowish marble what was taken up from the bay there. Ain’t never gone myself and never do plan to but,” he leaned in close to me then, his voice barely audible, “my neighbor’s boy gone through there few years back and come back strange.” He sat back, shuddering. I attempted to probe further, but the man seemed to have lost the courage required to speak on such a wretched place. “Dreams,” is all he would say, “he had terrible dreams.” The couple’s discomfort was plain after that, so I purchased a box of crackers, a pack of ginger cookies, and two bottles of water before making my way to an ancient bus stop Mrs.Morrison had been kind enough to direct me to. 

It was there that I witnessed the unprecedented shambling of that old bus as it made its way up the road. The thing was more rust than not and it made a concerning rattling as it came to a stop in front of me. The man in the driver’s seat sneered through the smudged windows. His bald head gleamed in a way that made it apparent any hand that touched it would come away coated in grime. His frame was emaciated to the point of a near-skeletal visage. The skin on his arms and face pulled taut against his bones, striking harsh angles in his silhouette. I imagined that were it not for the oversized shirt that rested like a draped sheet on his body I would be able to count his ribs. He watched me with eyes set deep in his face as I cautiously stepped inside the vehicle. I explained briefly that I was visiting family out in Drearsport and intended to spend a day or two there. The driver didn’t seem to care one way or another about my half-true story; he simply took my fare and closed the door behind me. 

I sat alone on a worn seat and began contemplating the purpose of a bus that didn’t seem to provide service to anyone going one direction or the other. The smell of the vehicle’s interior was unpleasant to be kind. It was as if mold had drowned in a lavender cologne. The driver didn’t seem to notice it, simply working in tense silence. As we shuddered down the old New England road, I felt a strange pressure build behind my eyes, as if cotton had sprung up there and was doing its best to press out through my tear ducts. I squeezed my eyes shut against the pain, wishing I had some tonic to chase it away. I was not prone to headaches, but as any man, I found myself in possession of one from time to time. This, however, was far and away the worst I had ever experienced. 

I lost time as I fought back the urge to beat my head against the floor until the pain stopped. It couldn’t have been more than a few minutes, but when I finally pried my eyelids apart, I found the driver watching me in the rearview mirror, which was so coated in dust and residue that I could only make out the vague movement of the man’s head as he looked away. The pain did not return for the remainder of the brief trip.

It must have been three hours when I found myself in the place that may very well be my grave. The main street was flanked by the remains of what at one time had been houses. All that remained of them now were the hollowed-out shells. Wooden beams and brick walls stood vulnerable to the open breeze, and none but a few had the remains of a roof. What caught my attention, though, was the spire that peaked above the other buildings. A strange yellow-white stone made it up, and I was certain this must be the steeple of that temple Mr. Morrison had seemed so off-put by. As we continued along the main road, the ruins were joined by a few poorly-kept abodes in which movement could be glimpsed but I only paid enough mind to note them as I tried to keep sight of that towering structure.

The bus stopped in front of the best-kept building I had seen since entering Drearsport. The Drearsport Rest was not a well-built structure, but the door was whole, and the yellow paint was only partially chipping on the outside so I decided it would likely be preferable to sleeping in the grass. The lobby was vacant of furnishings; the rough wooden floors and unpainted desk were all there was to see. The man standing behind the desk was short with his words. I attempted to ask after any other visitors he may have seen in the past month, but he simply handed me a key to a room on the second floor without even payment. 

I left a five-dollar bill on the counter, as that seemed an appropriate fee, then made my way to my room. It was simple accommodations. A twin-sized mattress, a writing desk, a nightstand, and a single window overlooking the bay for which the town was named. I inspected my new accommodation but found nothing strange until I opened the drawer on the nightstand. Inside was a King James Bible, leather-bound and seemingly well cared for. I opened it, leafing through the pages, finding nothing out of the ordinary. As I let the pages come to rest, I found myself faced with a peculiar sight. It was an inked image of what was almost the figure of Christ. I could not tell who it was depicting being crucified, though it was neither man nor woman. I quickly shut the book, replaced it in the drawer, and made my way out of that dreadful place. I shuddered slightly, realizing the people here truly must be of deplorably heathen stock. Beyond the inn, I found the town was nearly like any other port village in Maine. Wooden buildings and unpleasant looks. 

I spent that first day milling about, attempting to converse with the natives. The town and people within it were possessed of a strange scent I likened to that of the old bus that had carried me here. Likewise, many of the residents shared the strange greasy appearance of the driver and the odd man from the train. I made certain not to touch anything I did not have to and certainly avoided shaking hands with the rare person who was willing to speak to me. 

Even the streets, which were spotted with puddles from a previous day’s rain, were plagued by the bizarre filth of the place. The water there carried a film, thicker than that of any oil slick. It floated above the water’s surface, viscus and yellow-hued as if some giant pimple had burst and its contents had come to settle here. I can not deny that my attempt at conversation was simply a distraction. 

My true desire lay toward the center of this damned place, looming above like a chapel wrought by the hands of the damned. I found my interest in it overwhelming, and so tried to my best effort to avert myself from the view of it. Even as I wandered the streets, deliberately avoiding the paths that would take me closer to it, I found my eyes drawn to the sky above the rooftops where the spike stood. I put the urge aside as long as I could manage but as the sun dipped and my watch indicated it nearing evening, I found my feet trudging, unbidden, in the direction of the damnable church.

It was as Mr. Morrison had described. The Gothic structure loomed as a titan from Greece. It stood apart from the rest of the town as if its presence repulsed even these forsaken buildings. A circle of paved stones spanning near 50 feet made it an island surrounded by detritus and hollow silence. Its spire stabbed toward the sky, not so much reaching as threatening to pierce the bulbous clouds. I shuddered as I pictured it, the white masses tearing as the yellow spikes ripped sadistically into their substance. The thought was not my own, I am sure, but I wondered if the resulting wound would produce rain or the same puss-like liquid that I had seen corrupting the puddles of this grotesque place. I did find that the shopkeeper had been incorrect in one aspect. The stone was not quite yellow. It was nearly yellow, but the color itself was only adjacent to anything that could be described with a sane man’s tongue. I could feel my eyes crossing, and the nerves there in felt as if a fuzzy mold had sprouted from them. With effort, I jerked my vision away. Still, I saw it. The image of the arched wooden doors, gilded with what seemed to be raw, pitted iron. The bizarre swirling of the stone, spinning in on itself until it seemed to devour the physical space in front of it. I felt it drawing me, not so much begging as demanding I see it. Ordering me to witness the beauty and terror that no human hand could have conceived of.

As my sanity battled against the will of that blasphemous stone, I heard a sound that, even now, even in my present situation, haunts my immortal soul. The door to the church was opening. The sound of rough, unlubricated iron rending against ancient wood broke me from my internal conflict. The urge to stay vanished as quickly, though my legs seemed not to realize the decision to leave my brain had made. It was as if something was inside of me, holding me still by my very soul. A thing I had at the time identified as a man shuddered from the place. Now, I can not trust such an identifier to have been correct. Even then, I knew what called to me in a voice wrapped in muddy bile was no man.

“Do you swim,” it spurted, the words leaking from it like urine through cloth. The body of the thing was wrapped in what must have once been linen. It was draped wholly, covering its body in such a way as to appear nearly amorphis. The color of the cloth was yellowish, like so much of this place. It dripped a thick, clumpy liquid from the hem of the garment. As it moved the sound of muffled squishing came with each step. 

Even decades of experience with the lowest of humanity had not prepared me for the fear I felt surging through me in that moment. I was paralyzed with it but, as the thing grew close enough for me to spot a single yellowish eye through the cloth that draped its face, a jittering energy filled me. I am not ashamed to admit this, but I ran as a child runs from the threat of encroaching darkness. From the horrific terror of what could be behind them. I ran with all the strength I had ever possessed and fled that place with a haste.

I did not stop my retreat until I was certain I would crumple from the exhaustion. The memory of that thing’s smell, like ancient urine and rotting fruit, fueling me. It was admittedly not more than a mile from the church but the panic and the ravages of time had taken any stamina I had. I came to rest at the mouth of an alley, leaning against the filthy stone, uncaring of the dark stains it left on my clothing and skin. As I caught my breath, wheezing in a worrying rattle, I lifted my head to inspect my surroundings. That is when the form of a young man leaning against a wall in the alley came to my attention. I noticed his hair was grown in unwashed clumps that sat heavy on his head. He wrung his oily hands in front of himself as he muttered something. The words were distant and drowned out by the rushing blood in my ears but the face of this man was familiar to me, even in his current condition. 

Despite the grotesque amount of weight he had seemed to of lost Jacob still looked much the same as when I last saw him. Wire-framed spectacles sat on a hawkish nose, though now the lenses were smeared in grease. His once beautiful black hair fanned around his head in filth-caked strands. I forced myself into the alley with a new energy, though my quick pace must have startled him. His wild eyes shot to mine at my approach and there was no recognition in them. He had the appearance of a feral beast and the whites had gone to a similar yellow as that of the man on the train. With a shriek that must have originated in the core of his being he bolted off, deeper into the alley. I knew I did not have it in me to run again but I shuffled as quickly as I could manage after him. I found him huddled behind an overflowing dumpster that seemed to leak a yellow fluid. I knelt down next to him, my breath coming in gasps as my side screamed in pain. He spoke frantically to himself. I leaned in to hear his ramblings clearer and wished desperately I had left Jacob to wallow in his own misery. He was speaking quickly, repeating himself over and over again with a wild look in his eyes, “I know where I am and it is not here. The sea. The ochre Sea. I drown drown drown. Can not breathe. Why did I come? God help me. Ulegmaket help me. God of the puss-filled oceans and rivers of rotting bile. I’m drowning. I’m drowning.” I stood and backed away in shock from what had once been my nephew. The grime of his face was smeared with tears that seemed to cascade from his wide, hollow eyes. I looked about in a frantic effort to locate any help but we were alone. When I looked back to him he was gone. 

I stumbled back to my room, realizing that this was not the situation I had thought I would be arriving to. There was something wrong in this place and I intended to leave Jacob to it, though I know it would have tormented me to do so. I resigned myself to sleeping there that night but returning to Brunswick in the morning as soon as the bus arrived. The thought of encountering the figure from the church in the dark vibrated my bones and I knew there was no chance I would be on that dark road that night. I stopped at the general store on my way, catching the shopkeeper as he was preparing to close for the evening. I purchased a rusty hammer and a few passable nails, though the man seemed to give me a look of pity as he handed them to me. Perhaps he knew what I had seen that day, or even knew what awaited me in the dark of that night. Either way, I would sleep here but I would not do so without securing the door to my room. I retrieved a few wooden boards from a pile near an abandoned house and the attendant did not question my possession of them when I finally made my way up the stairs to my room. I wasted no time nailing the door shut with a sturdy plank before pushing the nightstand in front of it. I retrieved my typewriter from its case and began writing up a report more out of habit than need. I worked for a few hours after dark before settling in on top of the bed sheets fully clothed. 

I had only just drifted off when I first heard it. I was unsure if it was footsteps or splashing at first but as I sat quietly listening I realized it was perhaps both. It was almost as if someone was trudging through knee-deep water just outside my window. I was frozen with a fear that was overwhelming and seemingly unfounded. I mustered myself and made my way to the window. Pulling back the blinds my scream was uncontrolled and primal, like the scream a squirrel would make upon seeing a fox only inches away. The night was infected with the light of a pale, yellow moon, casting a flaxen glow over the whole town. The sky had begun to leak from black into a diseased yellow, as had the bay. I’m not sure it truly was a bay any longer, the water was not only changing color but its movement would have suggested a thickening to the fluid. The mutation of the environment was disturbing but the thing I saw outside of my window was more so. It was as if mucus, entrails, fungus, and all manner of writhing things had been formed into a parody of a human before shuttering off for a walk in the night air. It walked with a strange gate as one limp would surge forward pulling the whole mass behind it. The thing even attempted to swing what may have been arms in a walking fashion though the event was worsened by its constant rotation of what appendage was a leg and what an arm. I fell back from the window and began to sob, laugh, and gurgle out nonsensical words in an unintelligible unity.With haste, I secured my remaining boards over the window and set about typing. 

I do not know how long I will be forced to remain in this place. The smell has become worse and I believe there is something standing outside my door. It is leaking underneath. Puddling at my feet. Watching me without eyes. I dared a glance through the cracks in the boards. Only the briefest of moments but I saw enough. It still stands there, if what it does could be called standing. Even with my quick look, I caught sight of a dull glint from the beast. Pressed into what could have been a face was a set of grease-smeared spectacles. God Jacob, I pray the thing simply ended your wrecked suffering, more for my own sake than yours. I believe I am doomed. I am bound for the Ochre Sea. And I have no choice but to swim.
