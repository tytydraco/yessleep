I've always been a vivid dreamer, since I could remember I always had been fascinated by the immersive worlds I was dreaming. My parents thought that I was being a normal creative child when I told them about my dreams, which was pretty much proven to them after I just stopped dreaming around 7th grade. I'm now in my Sophomore year of high school, and one night the dreams came back. This dream, however, presented itself in a form that was different from my dreams I had as a younger child, it was scarily accurate. 

I dreamt that I would injure my ankle playing soccer for my school, as I had a game coming up the following day. I got the ball in the box via a pass from Asher, our Center Mid, I ended up dribbling past a defender and straight into the keeper, and I could see myself stumbling and landing on my ankle awkwardly. My brother, Josh ended my dream abruptly by waking me up. "Jake we gotta go, we have a game today" he said in a jittery tone. "The team needs you, you know I can't play up top!" We both had a laugh and I got out of bed to get ready. Everything was normal until about the 78th minute, we were down 0-1 and Asher delivered a pass to me in the box, all of a sudden I had no control over what I did. I dribbled past their last defender and was wiped out by their keeper who made a clean challenge but sent me stumbling which rolled my ankle. I opened my eyes, still grimacing in pain grasping my pulsing angle to see Josh standing above me. "Josh you good? We got a whole season ahead of us bro, c'mon." He was pushed aside by our school's trainer, who helped me up on my feet where he and Josh helped me walk to the training room. While I hopped on one foot thinking about my dream and how perfectly everything was predicted. I fell asleep thinking nothing of the dream, I was more worried about my ankle anyways.

That night I had another dream, it was a weird one but still felt real. Someone had slammed their car into the back of mine while I was in it at a red light. Because of this, I was a little nervous to drive, but my dad insisted I drove him to his work in my car. Sure enough, my dream became a reality. I realized that this wasn't a coincidence and that my dreams were predictions of the future. I thought of what I should do. If I tell a doctor or someone like that they wouldn't believe me, and if they did and I proved it I would spend the rest of my life as a dream interpreter. Plus the things that I predicted are really only relevant to me. "What if I'm crazy? No, crazy people can't predict the future. But what if this isn't reality? What if this is all a dream?" At this point I was afraid I would drive myself crazy so I stopped thinking like this. 

That night I decided I would keep track of my dreams in a notebook, this way I could be prepared for what was coming, or so I thought. That night's dream I was in my room on a dark rainy night, I looked out my window to see a shadowy figure looking at me, then on the flash of lightning it was gone. But I felt something behind me and as I turned, a giant hand was beginning to grab me before I woke up. I was drenched in sweat by this nightmare and I nervously wrote down every detail in the notebook. I spent the day paranoid and as the rain picked up at around 9 PM, I looked out the window, frozen. I couldn't take my eyes off the outline of a figure no matter how hard I tried. And all of a sudden a flash of lightning unfroze me, as I turned around I saw the hand and braced. Opening my eyes I saw nothing. I went to the bathroom and vomited multiple times before going to bed again, this was my biggest mistake yet. 

This dream was in my room as well, but it was during daytime. I looked outside and saw the figure in broad daylight. It was about 8 feet tall with broad shoulders and long arms. Its fingers were freakishly long and it was pretty much skin and bone. Yes it had a penis but I'm not gonna describe that, I took a better look at it's face and saw a thin jawline, with baggy, pupil-less eyes and thick locks of hair. Although there were parts of it that screamed not human, it looked like one, or something that used to be human. In a blink of an eye it was now directly in front of me, disemboweling me and eating me alive bare handed. I could feel the pain until everything went dark for what felt like forever. I woke up drenched in sweat looking at my body to check for any signs of damage; nothing. 

I'm writing this at 6:30 AM, the sun is beginning to rise and my time is running out. I'm not sure if the fact that I woke up is a good sign or not, but I'm fully ready to see what happens. I'll keep you guys updated if I survive, and if I don't, we'll you know what happened.
