My legs trembled as I saw what was taking place. That horrible figure... It still clouds my mind at night.

For context, I study at a normal highschool in CA. It's a pretty normal experience, although some fights and, interesting, events can sometimes be seen throughout the day. Like most highschools, we had, you guessed it, clubs!

There was the reading club, anime club, the football club, etc. I didn't join any of these as I found them boring or just not my type of thing. However, one day it changed.

I had a friend called Mary, who was a very nice girl. She was always so enthusiastic, but, at times, quiet and reserved. There was a time, where I barely saw her. She said she was going to "hang out with other friends".

I believed her, and clearly, I was mad. I mean, we had been friends for quite a while, and she just replaces me with some other friends? I didn't speak to her, however, one day, she came to my desk.

"Hey Caesar, I'm sorry for lying to you"
I was visibly confused
"What do you mean?"
"I'll let you in on some more details at lunch, someone might hear us here"

I was very confused on why this information was only between us, but I followed, and waited for her at lunch.

-"Hey Caesar, so, let me tell you the truth. So, a while back, I heard that there was this... Club of, well, black magic, spirits, all that shit. I joined it, and that's why I couldn't talk to you. I lied to you about hanging out with friends because I thought you would reveal it to EVERYONE in the school. Sorry. "

-"No, it's fine, I understand. In fact, can I join the club?"

I was very excited to join this club. My grandmother was always a person experienced with this kind of stuff, however, she passed away before I could learn further.

"Oh uh, I'll asked the leader of the club later this evening. See ya!"

I waited patiently, hoping that I would be accepted into the club. A couple hours later, I got a message from Mary.

"Yes! Shaw accepted you into the club! Welcome!"

I was really excited, jumping of happiness and even singing a song out of my enthusiasm. The next day, I arrived at my highschool, still happy about being accepted into the club. Mary presented me to the members of the club:

Shaw: The leader of the club, a pretty chill but brilliant guy.

Thomas: Shaw's best friend. He was mostly the guy to get confused on everything and just do what the rest did.

Oscar: Mary's Bf. I was jealous of that guy, as I... Sort of... Liked Mary. He was generally a dick to me, overprotecting Mary and acting like she was his posession. Im convinced she only is his girlfriend because hes quite hot.

Either way, Mary and the rest explained to me stuff about the club, saying that we would reunite at Shaw's house that night. He was home alone, so it was the perfect opportunity...

However, that night, things would go VERY wrong...
