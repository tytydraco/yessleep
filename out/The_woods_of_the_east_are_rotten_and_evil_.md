My mother would sit in between my grandmother and I, and I would lay my head down across them so that it fell just between their legs. Then both of them would pet my hair and my back, and I would stare at the cinderblock-shaped TV with its curved fuzzy screen and feel the warmth and static that got soaked up off it’s pictures into the air and feel the long nails and wedding bands on my mom and Grandma’s hands and I would fall asleep. I’d wake up back home the next morning under a comforter with monkeys and palmtrees on it and I’d try to remember the car ride home, grateful that I got to skip feeling that terror in my stomach that took over each time we drove down a backroad at night. And stuck in between a couple of my back teeth I’d get a small crumb of brownie, and I would wrap myself in my monkey-covered comforter and squeeze my eyes shut with force and feel loved, truly, in a way I’ve held on to for the rest of my life’s 

She had used to have a husband, so I used to have a grandfather, but never when I knew her. “He was beautiful,” she’d say about him and she would smile and it was clear she missed him everyday. She lived alone in a house in a random patch of low-slung hills in the east, surrounded by forests that I loved in the day time but that always made me want to cry when I looked at them for  too long at night . Moonlight threw evil onto the woods, turning everything into Hardwood trees with razorsharp bark and swollen herds of uneaten deer, who’s white-tails are clouded grey like cataracts  and who’s antlers get scraped and bloody-fleshlike on the oaks and hickories, leaving red dried to brown stains thrown about like snot stains. Dotted throughout there were warped, stunted Chestnuts rotting into a syrupy-orange nothingness, which grandma said used to be as tall as skyscrapers when her own mother was born but now were born into rot, the air now poisoned by a fungus from China that’d waste them into nothing before they could drop a single fruit.

Still, I loved to visit her. Because in the day, I remember it as eden, smelling like dirt in the best way.. Just across the gravelly road from her little red house there was a marshland where rain water collected itself to feed some fat cattails, and when I was smaller it felt like a place you could disappear. The water was black and brown and oily and lumpy and misshapen from the clumps of translucent frog eggs that would appear early in the spring. When the sunlight stuck them right the black holes in the center of the frogspawn would light up and it would look like a million eyes fused together into a single monstrous tumor, staring up at me from a shallow puddle that felt like it went to the center of the earth. 

Beyond the little marsh was the hillside, mostly forest but with a little prairie cut into it to make room for the gargantuan power lines, standing proud with their eight arms paralyzed beside them, marching in a straight line over the hills and onto the next and over those and on to the next all the way to the Pacific Ocean. One day in February, I walked up the hill and sat beneath them, waiting for the too-near too-heavy greyed clouds in the sky to let the snow I thought they must have fall loose over the valley. I wore my dead grandpa’s gloves and jacket and my own hat and boots, and I sat criss-cross applesauce on the frozen cardboard-colored grass, and I listened to the crackles and shocks that peeled off the massive coils above me and somehow fell apart into the cold air before the reached the ground. Somewhere in the distance, I could hear the engine of a car, too commonplace for me to pick it out and label it inside my head.  I imagined how the thunderous footsteps of the sleeping sentinel would sound, how it would hit the earth with such force that even the electricity would give it a breath of peace after wards, buffeted away like the dirt of a creekbed tossed up by my feet when I waded in the summertime and hoped to see salamanders. 

Bright little snowflakes began to fall, too light to sink straight to the ground, and I stared at how white they were against the elephant-skin clouds. I noticed then that the car I had heard earlier had grown closer, and had in fact stopped beside my little marshland and rolled it’s windows down. Through the electrical fields and the rustling yellowed grass I could hear the man inside calling towards me, his voice getting a little louder each time I pretended not to hear. I stared up at the coils and wished he’d go away but my eyes couldn’t stop glancing at him to see if he was still there. Each time I’d curse at myself and my coward’s eyes, my rabbit-like bitch eyes that couldn’t stay still. The man’s voice was getting angrier and I was trying to be smaller. Finally I heard the car door slamming and footsteps set toward me, louder than the power tower’s steps in my head, louder than anything I’d ever heard. I locked my neck starring up and froze my body while I heard my heart beat start to drown things out a little more than it had before. 

“You the one who’s been driving on my drive way?” 

“Oh, I can’t drive,” I said back. “I’m 12.” 

The man was tall (like all men to a child) and wore reflective sunglasses and blue jeans and a brown jacket. On his hip he had a gun. He had stubble and teeth so yellow they were almost brown. His face seemed to cave in on itself and his jaw was crooked, so his mouth never totally closed and his heavy breath filled up the air between us. He lurched a bit and his voice was raw from screaming at me moments before. His hands were pale and covered in birth marks and protruding veins, and on his finger there was a wedding band he clearly hadn’t taken off in years and probably couldn’t anymore. 

“Someone’s been driving down into my drive way and driving fast in circles and messing up the gravel. I paid for that gravel myself.” 

“I’m sorry, I can’t drive. It wasn’t me.” 

He stared at me and I stared at myself in his sunglasses. There was snow in his throat, I could hear it. 

“What are you doing here? Do you live on this road? This is a private road.” 

“I stay with my grandma sometimes.” I pointed at her house. A dog began to bark from the man’s car. He stared at me again, letting his dog tire himself out as he caught his breath, the screaming catching up with his lungs as his adrenaline faded away.

“You never fucking ignore me again. Never in your fucking life. Okay?”  He was panting now. He reached out and grabbed a fistful of my hair, and then held up his gun like he was going to smack me across the face with it. Without thinking my arms swung out at him while I wished for him to be far away from me, eyes closed. They hit his sunken chest and I felt him wince. He shoved me down and my half-open mouth collided with the dirt and rocks beneath me, filling my cheeks with pebbles and soil and tearing my lip open. I cried as he let out something like a roar into the forest around us, wet with phlegm and rage and something that made me shiver, and then he walked away, lurching even more than before. I balled myself up and waited until I heard his car pull around the bend, then sprinted home. 

That evening, I got to watch tv because of what had happened, like I did when I was sick. I was wearing sky blue pajamas that I was too big for now, which i hadn’t worn in a couple years. One of my lips was misshapen and lumpy, big fat and purple, with a white gash in a beetroot red circle that slowli bleed into a sickly, almost black/ish purple. I sat there and I sucked on that lump like a jolly rancher, wincing each time my teeth touched it and set off a scream of pain that jumped through my jaw. We had a skylight, and the the skies above were a lovely cotton-candy pink and blue, until this  got drowned out by wretched flashes of red and blue and wailing sirens. First one car, then two more, then more. I went to bed and the next day, I learn what happened. My mom had called the cops on him, and when they knocked on his door he killed himself and his two dogs. Or, he refused to come out, and they called for more and they set up a perimeter, and then he killed himself and his two dogs. He was old and his wife had died, my grandma told me.  She didn’t say, but she didn’t think we should have done that. I could tell by how she pet my hair from then on—every once in awhile she would pull on my scalp just a little too rough, and for a second I could feel the sadness she held in the palm of her hands. 

He was buried next to his wife just down the road and his house left to rest, inherited by a son who had gotten married and had kids in a city someplace. When I was 15, I went with a tall brown-haired girl to look through it’s windows, intent on impressing her. I had told her of my fight, (even the little kids pajamas afterwards) to make her like me more, and it worked, and now I hoped to kiss her at the dead man’s cabin. It was April and the sky was blue as could be, but snow had fallen the week before and hadn’t yet melted away, so she wore black snow pants and a pink jacket and white snow boots. I thought she looked gorgeous, and I was embarrassed about how I wore normal shoes to seem strong to her and now she could tell I was miserable and my socks were soaked. Either way, though, we held hands on the way over. Without gloves on, our hands went numb in the early spring air, and melting snow would occasionally fall in a fat plop from a tree branch straight onto the backs of our hands. The slush melted immediately and ran in between our interlocked fingers, finding the cavern we made between our palms and evaporating into the pores of our palms. We talked about school and I could not have been happier. 

As we walked down the drive way to the dead man’s house, I realized it was painted a nice light green, with white shutters and a white porch. I thought it would be black. It was one story with a pointed roof, upon which a rusted red metal star was nailed in place facing straight up the driveway to the road. I’d seen this through the trees before as I drove by, wondering what it meant. The girl I liked walked right up the three steps and knocked on the door. I knew no one would answer, but still, I felt my throat close and my heart quicken. The girl I liked opened the door and walked in. 

The walls were wood and the floor was carpeted, until the counter that marked where the kitchen started. There the floor was linoleum, faded yellow like dandelions starting to wilt. Lit only by the sunlight that managed to squeeze between the shut blinds, colors here all looked like shades of grey. The cabinets were dark brown and the stove and fridge a beaten white. A wheelchair with lime-green arm rests sat in the corner, and a pile of blue metal canes with black rubber handles sat by the door. Nearly lined on the counter were plastic pill bottles, dulled by the dark into a sickly shade like bloody orange juice. I had just reached out to touch one when the dull end of a pistol comes whipping towards me. My stomach muscles twitch as my torso draws itself in on itself, my back folding in half to protect the soft young guts inside while a scream bursts out of my chest. My arms launched themselves up to defend myself, to move whoever wants to hurt me away, to help me survive another day. 

Instead they grip the sleeves of a pink waterproof jacket hurl push the girl I like into the fridge, where she let herself fall to the ground.. Slowly, with care, she unzipped her pink jacket and pulls down one shoulder, then pulled up the sleeve of the shirt she was  wearing (from our school’s soccer team). A blackish-forest green is already rising out of the depths of her arm, as thousands of broken blood vessels began pouring blood into her soft nice-smelling white skin. She began to cry, I began to cry, and I said “I’m sorry.” 

“Why did you do that?” she screamed back at me. 

She ran out, I followed. She jumped down the steps in one go and almost slips when she lands, and I could hear her gasp. By then she was really crying, and with the cold air now too she’d become the brightest angiest red. She turned around and the fear in her eyes made me stop in my tracks. I made the fear, I made the bruise. I am strong, I can hurt. 

“Please, just let me go home. I’m supposed to watch my little sister.” 

I tried to apologize, to explain, but she walked away, and I’m left. 

For days afterwards, I waited to be pulled aside in class, for the cops to bust down my door. Eventually, I realized it wasn’t going to happen. But until we graduated together, that girl was scared of me. Together, her and I watched myself grow every year, watched my muscles growing larger, thicker, fatter, watched my skin stretching to take up more and more of my mirror each day, watched my skeleton recede into the depths of what became an adult man. As it horrified her, it horrified me. 

I started spending the night more at my grandma’s in these years, without my mom accompanying me. I liked the freedom and the quiet. The year I was 17 I stayed there almost every weekend. Grandma was older, and in between those knick-knacks that had always been there, those same bloody-orange pill bottles and bright blue canes with rubber handles had begun to sprout up. Older now and no longer so afraid of the woods, my need for fear took on a new focus, where I swear I could feel illness, or aging, or death hear the call of the medicine. It would squirm its way up in between the cracks in the floor before pooling like acid rain and leaking slowly, constantly, as deep as it can go through the seven layers of skin we have right down to the raw-meat marrow tunnels that ran through our cores. I could see it, almost feel it happening, see the wormy tendrils stretching themselves to nothing, like when heavy summer rain storms hit the pitch black dirt and the water goes down searching for seeds somewhere in the center of the earth. But in the morning, I’d wake up, and she’d be making coffee with a black plastic coffee machine and there’d be pre-cut fruit from the supermarket, and me and her would sit happily for hours talking about nothing. 

We’d go for walks afterwards, because she didn’t need the cane until the afternoon, and we’d walk down her driveway and down her dirt road to where it became paved. We’d look for birds together. My favorites were the bluebirds with the orange chests that liked to hang out and fly around all together. I’d watch them dart around a grove of trees like a school of fish and imagine the tangled web they’d leave behind if their paths could be held. My grandma’s favorite were the yellow birds with black and white wings that ate at our neighbor’s birdfeeder. She always smiled in the spring time when we’d see two of them moving together as a couple, flying together to the feeder to eat a seed or two and then flying back to a nearby branch to let others have their turn. But the best days were when we’d see a heron in the little marshland across from her house.

 Massive, delicate, the color of a storm-cloud, wings that beat the air down so loud we could hear it from down the road. We’d watch it for hours, perched upon one leg, and if we were lucky we were close online to see into it’s eye (always just one eye visible at a time), staring back without flinching, never squinting, never shying away. These eyes were a flared-up hateful yellow, neon jaundice, constantly casting searchlights through the scum of the roadside swampland in hope that those same pathetic black-brown newts I loved when I was kid may stupidly slip out of it’s sanctuary of mud and dead leaves, at which point the heron’s neck would twitch and it’s second leg would descend from the down feathers on the bird’s underside and enter the water without creating a single ripple. Every muscle in the birds body was now being moved by hunger, hundreds of millions of cells working together in quiet desperation, absolutely focus, to bring a killing to the heron’s beak. Hunger so total, so deep, it looked like apathy, like instinct. The neck coiled like a snake and the chest fell closer to the little pond’s scummy surface, and me and my grandma would hold our breath, and then without a sound the head disappeared under water and came back up with a squirming little creature whose toes and tail would stand-out backlit by the morning sun for just about one second before being swallowed in their entirety to thereby be an  eaten thing forever. 

My mom had loved listening to me talk about newt toes when I was a kid, how cute it was that there were five of them just like us but on little slimey mitten-paws, when I told her that story, she didn’t smile. “That water is dirty,” she said. “When it rains the streets sewage comes up.” She didn’t come to visit grandma anymore, but always gave her big hugs when she came to pick me up, and never let me forget to say “I love you.” I knew it was because of that man who had died. I assumed it would heal with time, fading like my own fear of him had begun to. 

That’s not totally true. I may have thought about him less, but sometimes at night I’d get scared at, right as I began to drift off, I would hear his voice in the dark, in the room, just beyond where the light from the window ended. Clearly, confidently, with a strength he didn’t have when was alive, he would say my name, so crisp in the quiet room I felt like I could feel it in my jawbone. I would pretend not to hear and turn over, shaking under my blankets. My eyes shut like I was asleep, I would listen to my grandma’s uneven breath in the other room, thinking of pistol whips and spittle and deep-growths of death, until finally I managed to pass out. 

There was another boy from my school who lived at the other end of grandma’s road, and sometimes when I stayed over he’d come over late and night or noon on Sundays and we’d sit on her porch or in her basement and hangout. I liked him a lot, and grandma found it charming how polite he was. He’d always hug her and ask her how she was doing and offer to do her favors on weekdays if I wasn’t around, and it made her smile. When she wasn’t around, he’d ask me about what happened with the guy. I’d tell him about the pistol and the drive way and how I wouldn’t stop staring at the power lines and he’d laugh and tell me about how the man used to mess with him too. 

“I used to ride a little dirt bike up and down all the road, like a kid’s bike I got when I was like 7. That motherfucker would scream his head off, spitting everywhere, totally unintelligible. He’d try to chase me but his leg was fucked, because of like a blood clot he had. Honestly, I’d yell back. I’d taunt him. I was kind of a little prick. But anyways, so one day me and my mom and my brother were sitting on our porch, and he comes down our driveway and gets out with his hat in his hand, real polite. And he starts talking to my mom about how I ran over his foot on his bad leg, and my bike is dangerous to everyone on the street, and would she please control me. She’s polite, even though she knows he’s fucking crazy. Because she’s seen him doing his thing, she didn’t let me ride around unsupervised. I had to wear a bike helmet and wrist guards and shit, for Christ’s sake. So while this is happening, me and my brother are running around, and I look in the bed of his pick up truck and there’s like this purplish balloon kinda of thing in there. I climb on the tire to see what this is while he’s talking, and suddenly I see that the whole bed of his pick up truck is covered in deer guts. My dad said he had gotten in trouble for field dressing deer and leaving the guts in the middle of the woods, and so I think this was him trying to do the right thing. But I don’t know, they looked fucked up and old. I think maybe he had forgotten about them, because the rest of the deer wasn’t in there. The balloon was a stomach, and then there were these intestines that looked like these fat white eels, and just half-dried blood everywhere. 

And his truck was dirty, so the blood was like a slurry that was mixing with the dirt and his fucking trash, and I think maybe he wasn’t good at gutting deer with his fucked up old man hands so there were little flecks of fur in there. And I let out a little kid scream when I realize what I’m seeing, and he sees me on his truck and rushes over and grabs the back of my neck screaming to my mom about ‘see what I mean?’  And she starts screaming back to let me go and get off our property and he turns around all pissed but before he goes he grabs a fucking handful of guts from the back of his truck and throws them at me and my mom, and it gets in her mouth. And for like a week after, she got so sick. She couldn’t keep any food down, and she said there were pains in her chest and in her thighs. My dad wanted to sue them, but his wife and kid came over and I don’t know what they said but we didn’t. I think they gave us some money, honestly. But yeah man, it isn’t your fault at all. He was just a psycho.” 

He’d laugh when he told me the story sometimes, sometimes he’d look sad. The story confused him, I think. It confused me too. Then once, taking a walk in the woods behind grandma’s, I saw those same fat white eels he was talking about sitting on the forest’s floor of wet brown leaves, bright and shiny in the sun. Someone had gutted a deer back here. Excited, I ran over and got him. Together we circled it in silence, maybe play-acting scientists, maybe play-acting coyotes. He broke the silence. 

“Yeah. This is exactly what it looked like.” He knelt down and found a stick to poke in with. “God. Have you ever hunted?”

“Never, man. I don’t think I need to.” There was more grey and white than I had expected. “Someone told me if you shoot the stomach the guts explode inside the deer and spoil all the meat.”

My friend laughed. “That’s fucking disgusting.” We walked home laughing, happy together.

The next weekend I stayed at grandma’s, my friend showed up looking pale. He kissed my grandma on the cheek and complimented her haircut, but quickly slipped out to sit on the porch, waiting for me. I followed, and as my knees had just begun to bend he spoke. 

“Can we bury the deer?” His voice was shaky, like a kid’s after throwing a tantrum. Surprised, I looked over and saw him staring at me, his eyes wet with tears. “Please?” I didn’t ask any questions. I wanted to be the hero. 

“Of course.” 

We grabbed shovels from the shed behind grandma’s house and set off for the gut pile. As we walked he told me about the nightmares he’d been having of standing in the woods and bashing his own head into the trees until his brain leaks out and drips down on the front of his shirt. While he smashes his head into the bark again and again, he starts to laugh, but it’s the man’s laugh voice, and then he begins to say my name, but with the man’s voice. Then he walks home, one side of his head completely caved in, one eyeball down next to his lips, and instead of his own mom he sees the man’s wife waiting for him, and she kisses him and slips her tongue into his mouth. He stared at the ground as he told me this, clearly ashamed, with quick glances up to scan my face for disgust. I smiled back at him and said it must be hard, gladly covering my face with a kindness to hide the nausea I couldn’t help but feel growing in my stomach. For the first time, I told him about the girl, about how I saw the pistol-whip coming for my head and how she was just there. He doesn’t say much in return. 

“You shouldn’t have broken in. But it’s okay. It’s normal. It’s just kid stuff.” 

Finally, we get to the guts. They’re barely there,  eaten away by vultures and stray cats and the week that had passed since we’d last visited. I don’t know how my friend even knew. But if you looked close, there were still specks of red and pink and gristle scattered around, and we set to digging a little grave for them. The ground was hard— what wasn’t frozen was rock or tree root. It was on a steep and  uneven little patch of forest too, and we were slipping on the leaves as we dug like they were iced over even though it hadn’t snowed yet that year. My friend tried to stomp on his shovel to drive it into the ground with a little more force and he slipped backwards, falling flat on his ass. I let out a little laugh and before I can ask if he’s okay he swings his like a pickaxe and smacks my hip, hard. I almost fell but caught myself with my hands, and on almost all fours I saw him, knelt down on one knee and crying so hard that snot bubbled out his nose, and I felt insane. I felt like my bones were thrumming and I could feel it through my whole body. I wanted to hurt him back

With something like glee I jumped on my friend and began beating his chest with two closed fists, swinging them up and down like hammers. When I stopped to swing back and punch in his nose, his torso shot up and he wrapped his arm around my neck, my Adam’s Apple perfectly lodged in the crook of his elbow. He rolled on top of me and as I struggled, I realized my stomach was grinding itself into the flecks of deer meat left on ground. I remember how the sound of my own struggling, wheezing, screaming, crying, roaring all at once. Finally I threw my head back into his nose and he lets go, and I grabbed my shovel and swung it straight at his head. It mostly missed, but one of its sharp edges cut his forehead and then he’s bleeding but he still won’t stop. 

He staggered to his feet and grabbed his shovel and swung at me again, too tired and blinded by his own blood to pose a serious threat anymore. His kill shot made a wretched clanging sound as it hit a rock in the ground, making us both wince. The thrumming-in-my-bones feeling left me, replaced by a headache starting somewhere behind my eyes. The woods were dark by then. Staring at the earth we’d churned, I suddenly wondered if he had meant to dig a grave. If he’d meant to make me dig my own grave. If he’d wanted to bury me with rotten deer bits flecked across my chest. I stared at him, breathing too heavily to speak. He stared back, no longer sobbing, his face smeared with dirt and blood and snot, his eyes totally dead. He moved slow now, like he was made of wood, hauling himself up to his feet with visible pain in his every movement. “I fucking hate you,” he said. “This is all your fault.” 

“You’re pathetic,” I shot back. He walked away without another word. I sat and listened to the way his limp shuffled up the leaves of the forest floor.  When I couldn’t hear anymore I followed, dragging the two shovels behind me, unthinking until I stumbled through the back door of my grandma’s house and collapsed into bed. Comfortably cold, I laid on my back and tucked my arms across my chest, squishing my hands into my armpits to keep them warm. Then, like a silver-black frozen lake dissolving back into water, I felt the forest creep into the room with me. The darkness around me became bigger as the walls fell back behind marching pines and hardwoods creeping closer to my bedside. The flat plane of my old mattress began to wrinkle into an uneven patch of ground, though my body was still so wretched it felt fine. I stared as the ceiling peeled itself apart, revealing a web of dark branches through which could see some faint lace-like stars beginning to appear. 

Their soft white-grey light gave the deep blue sky a  welcoming feeling, like they were beckoning me to join them up there, and even though I knew I shouldn’t, I closed my eyes to rest for a second. A light barely-there mist began to fall, first felt on my eyelashes, lips, and the tip of my nose, then my cheekbones, my eyelids, and the base of my neck. The blood in my face still felt so warm from the fight that I imagined the mist may evaporate, even as I tightened my arms and clenched my fists to beat back the dropping temperature. I coughed up some dirt, forcing me to open up my eyes. Standing above me was the man, wrinkled and naked, staring into my eyes with the same hatred I’d just beaten my friend with, hatred like the heron’s hunger, so matter-of-fact it’s almost instinct. I could hear his wet breath, phlegm in his chest catching in his throat. Time stopped, the woods fell back and it came to me that I will never be rid of him. I realized this with true, true despair, a new feeling for me. Not fear or sadness or hate but total abject hopelessness, steadfast and absolute and born fully-formed. Now I knew that when I was a child and I’d panic staring into the  trees at night, it was him waiting there. Now I knew I was right to be so afraid. At the foot of my bed, he squatted down on one knee and laid his head on the side of my bed right by my feet. He stared at me, unblinking, and I stared into space, begging for sleep. 

I woke up half-way home in my mom’s car, with vague memories of her helping me stumble down the front porch steps, trailed by my hobbling grandma, gasping for air to keep up with us . The two of them were half-whispering and half-shouting at each other. I begged to watch TV. On my body the blood and the dirt had seemed one and the same, but on my bedding the stains they left were sharply different. In the passenger seat, I began to cry, so viciously that I was gasping for air and breathing in tears, choking on my own salt. My mom put her hand on my knee. We didn’t say a word. 

I didn’t stay at grandma’s anymore after that. She blamed my mom, and I never corrected her. She began to call our house more and more. If I answered we’d talk like nothing had happened, and I’d hang up smiling. When she got my mom, I’d hear her bellowing through the phone until her vocal cords gave out and she’d whisper hoarsely that she missed me and could I please come visit and that she was sorry I’d gotten hurt. I couldn’t hear this without feeling a small pain in my chest. I knew her sisters were dead. Her husband was dead. She’d had friends once, to laugh with. They were dead too. But gripped by fear, I’d say nothing, pretending not to know what was happening. My mom’s voice would get quiet here too, like she was talking to a little kid. “I’m sorry, mom,” she’d say “it’s too much. Too many things. It isn’t good for him.” Right before I turned 18, she died in her sleep. I had talked to her the night she died and told her I loved her. Still, she wasn’t found for six days, when a man went over to fix her sink. It was winter, and the family of sweet grey deer mice who had built a little nest in her walls to keep warm had set about eating her fingertips and eyelids and a bit of her nose.
