You and I are the same. We're both so bloodthirsty.

In fact, if you asked my departed mother, you are so much worse. You, human, do not like blood as we do. Vampires sip the blood of man and beast for sustenance. My mother said you draw the blood of every creature because it excites you.

My mother said, that even those who faint at the sight of blood are hard-wired to love it, your desire just overcomes you. My mother said, you all will be the last species left on this planet because you are the cruelest. My mother said, across the millennia, it has not been good enough for us to bow to you, but we must be buried beneath you. 

I cannot even find peace in this cave.

My mother said, you have slain the Neanderthal, the Jinn, the Denisovans, the Paranthropus, Homo erectus, and even the vampire. 

That is what I was told for the first one hundred years of my life and I still don't know what to believe.

To be honest, I didn't care about any of that at the time. My mother lost my focus as she spoke as soon as she said both she and I would be dead soon. I had lived as a home-schooled child in in a small cave not knowing anything about the world for 100 years. She said she was on her last leg of life and I only had 40 or so years left despite my teenage look. She died that month.

Soon ( in vampire terms) I was going to be dead but before that, I wanted to live. I wanted to party. I've never tasted human blood and I would never be interested in it. 

There were songs to dance to and women to love. Why were we sitting in caves whining? I flew to the closest city and started my adventure. Then after failing in that city because I did not understand it (I was homeschooled remember) I went to a different city where things were much better.

I learned to trust humans along the way, all thanks to my best friends Kathleen and Barri. I want to tell you I became their friends over mutual interest, or something noble but that's a lie and I will not lie on my deathbed.

I met the girls when I was on a tear, going to a club or bar every night and waking up beside something pretty every morning. The hookups weren't important, just bodies for lust, adoration, romance, and memories for a couple of hours and then a bill for Uber in the morning. The night I ran into the girls something was different.

Kathleen sipped a blue drink and saw me coming. She tapped Barri, a girl who never understood subtlety, and Barri stared at my approach like a child does a new adult. Drunk and horny I sat beside Kath. Embarrassed easily, her face went red almost the same color as her pink dress.

"Hey," I said.

"Hey," Kathleen said.

And then I vomited everything I had drunk in the last hour. The rainbow mix exhausted me and I almost fell out of my chair. Kathleen grabbed me before I could and Barri helped steady me.

Everything went blurry. I was blackout by this point so this is just what I was told.

"Oh, no," Barri said. "Are you okay?"

"Ah, man," a bouncer came by and grabbed me by the shoulder. "I'll get this guy out of here. Sorry, he's bothering you."

"No, actually he's our friend!" Kathleen interjected.

Now, why would this girl lie to protect a stranger? She said she felt bad for me but after getting to know her better I know that isn't the whole truth.

Kathleen was a girl desperate to find Mr. Right. This was her greatest ambition. Now when I vomited on her shoes she knew I was not Mr. Right but the thing is Kathleen had vomited on a shoe or two herself, she didn't even drink, she was that nervous.

Growing up fat, with a stutter, and bad skin, guys weren't the nicest to Kathleen. 

Extreme diet and exercise, speech therapy, and puberty changed who she was on the outside but the years of rejection and bullying did a number on her. She was a nervous wreck around men she liked. Her constant failures only made her want true love more. Like Harvard graduates lusted for political power, Kathleen lusted for love. 

Her lust for love caused her to be a nervous wreck when the opportunity approached. Her stutter returned, and she would tell jokes that weren't funny and she brought an air of anxiety to the interaction. So, when she saw a boy stumble over trying to introduce himself she saw a little of me in her.

Kathleen and Barri brought me over to a couch. They sat me down and Kathleen went to get me some water. So, it was just Barri and I. Now, this is the part where I start remembering again because I thought Barri's question was so strange it almost sobered me.

"Did you mean to do that?" Barri asked with genuine sincerity.

"What... no?"

Now, one thing you should know about Barri is that she might not have any idea about what's going on at any given time. It's interesting because she wasn't dumb either. She was accepted to an Ivy League school but turned it down to go to a school closer to her family. 

Barri just had gaps in her wide array of knowledge. I was homeschooled in a cave, I could relate.

"Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry,” she said. “I just know guys have like um, pick-up lines and stuff. You guys can be real tricky." She said tricky in what I'm sure she felt was a funny accent. It was cringy.

I didn't say anything. My head was spinning.

"Oh, no, sorry I didn't mean to imply that you were tricky." She patted my back twice. "I'm sure you're a nice guy."

I looked at her and was greeted by the most unorthodox, unpracticed, and genuine smile I had ever seen in a club or anywhere in my life.

Now one thing you should know about Barri is that because she had trouble not offending people and understanding people what she really wanted was to be understood and to be good. She was a part of about five different volunteer teams, a consistent church attendee, and was a big sister in one of those at-risk youth programs. As for being understood, she was a constant over-explainer.

They were flawed, silly people and I loved them for it.

For the first time since I walked into the human world, I realized I had found some humans I wanted to be friends with. And that's how our yearlong friendship began—a rainbow of impulse and chasing after what we want. 

I traded sex for friendship that night and never regretted it. It was easy. The girls were a lot like me all they wanted was to have a good time before their first year of college. So, there was no sex but secrets shared, the only thing naked between us was the truth, and we were bound by trust, not fuzzy handcuffs. And I wouldn't take back that experience for the world.

There was another who did not like it though.

Perhaps, we all are slaves to our genetics... Do you know elephants hate lions and will chase a lion down to ruin its day? The same goes for whales and orcas.

There was something from the ancient world that was a proud slave to its genes.

We clubbed every weekend night and songs steered our summer.

In July we were singing our hearts out to Chapel Ronan's best song, not Pink Pony Club, not Good Luck Babe but Feminomen

Hit-like-rom-

Pom-Pom-Pom

Get it hot like

Papa John

As soon as we entered a club we went straight to the dance floor and earned our drinks through sweat and laughs. After that, we headed to the bar to grab drinks and then decided who would wing for who in the search for love. That night Barri and I left Kathleen at the bar so Barri could wingwoman for me.

While we were away an old man came up to Kathleen. Much to her chagrin, she always attracted men outside her age range. 

I don't remember what the girl I liked was wearing but Barri wore a bright yellow dress and had just re-dyed her hair to be blonde.

"Oh, you like movies," Barri said to my target for the night after awkward introduction and conversations. "Vlad really really likes movies," Barri said again without a hint of subtlety. In truth, she wasn't a good wingwoman at all but that was the fun of it. That's what made all of us laugh.

"Oh," the woman said, probably surprised by Barri's abrasive approach.

"Do you have a favorite director?" I asked.

"I don't know. I like horror," she was nervous. Her drink swayed ever-so-slightly in her hand. "Oh, I saw Get Out recently it's my favorite movie so I guess Peele."

"You like Get Out better than Peele's other one... US?" I asked.

"Yeah."

"Pretty eyes and that little smile you do and blessed with good movie taste. I didn't know God played favorites," I mocked and flashed my smile and thanks to thousands of years of vampire genetics I'm told it is quite good.

She rolled her eyes but she did do that little smile I liked. My heart raced because I knew what this could lead to.

Behind us, the old man still chatted with Kathleen. He was out of place for the EDM club we were in. He wore a plaid suit and loafers. The room glowed under the lights of the dance floor. 

Neon, orange, yellow, and pink painted the club. Dresses, tank tops, and white sneakers flowed throughout the room. This was a place for drugs, dancing, and laughter. *What did this old man want?*

I am protective of my friends but Kathleen knew how to get rid of him. She was just taking longer than normal.

"Whatever," the nameless girl in front of me said. "What about you? Who do you like?"

"The only one better than Peele right now: Robert Eggers."

"Oooh he is good," Barri chimed in.

"Better than Peele? Lie again." She mocked.

"You think I'm wrong?" I pretended to be aghast and put my hand to my chest in protest.

"I know you're wrong."

"Jordan Peele didn't make The Witch," I countered.

"Well, he didn't," she said and fingered my chest. "You're right about God playing favorites because he definitely made you cute but gave you bad taste." Her touch and her teasing sent me into boyish ecstasy and she knew it. My toes curled and I fought back a larger smile that wanted to greet her.

"Oh," she said. "It looks like you have a cute little smile too."

That would have sent me over the moon until Barri chimed in.

"I liked The Witch," Barri added not understanding at all that I was doing quite fine without her there.

We both stared at her. She took two big sips of her fruity drink without a care in the world.

"Shall we dance," I asked the trio.

"Eeek, let's go!" Barri squealed

My film buff flirt shrugged and motioned for me to lead her. I did and looked back one more time at Kathleen and considered breaking it up.

The last time I did she got mad at me because she said he was offering to be her sugar daddy and she was toying with the idea if she should get one. Maybe, she finally decided on it.

Regardless, we got to the dance floor. I am not a good dancer but more importantly, I am a free man. I'm not afraid to be off-beat or a fool. I will do what my body tells me to do or jump and sing the lyrics. On the third song since we were on the dance floor that's what I was doing. I jumped, screamed, and sang in front of my girl's face and she did it right back.

Gimme Gimme Gimme

A man after midnight

Won't somebody come chase the shadow away

Yes, it was effeminate. Yes, it was corny but like I said I was free. I was having a great time.

The girl I flirted with wiggled her finger at me to come closer.

I pulled my new friend close to me for her to whisper something in my ear, purely for intimacy.

"That's not your girlfriend right?" She asked.

"Why? Jealous." I asked. It was my turn to mock.

"Maybe, I just wanted to give you a little film education at my place y'know because I have such good taste."

"Why, yes I would like a taste."

She gave me a playful smack on the cheek and pushed me off.

"That is not what I said."

"Sorry, the music is just so loud. It's difficult to hear can you say it again?" I said and stared at her lips, unashamed and making it clear what I wanted to do.

She bit her lip and glanced at me.

"Come here again and I'll show you."

She puckered up. I touched the small of her back and pulled her in. She put her two fingers on each side of my belt buckle and returned my embrace.

Out of the corner of my eye, I saw the old man in plaid grab Kathleen's wrist and pull her out of the chair. Kathleen and I made eye contact across the bar. Her eyes bulged and puffed with fear and tears.

That I would not stand for. I brushed my date aside and moved with the speed and strength that vampiric blood allowed me. Men dropped as I went through them. The floor of flashing lights and colorful shirts parted like the Red Sea and soon I placed my hand on the back of the man in plaid.

A mighty push would be enough. He would fly across the room, crash against the wall, and receive a broken body as punishment.

That's what should have happened.

Instead, he received the brunt of my power and only stumbled a few feet. He turned to me, his little head full of joy.

"Oh, you are from the old world too! I smell the old blood on you," his voice was curling, it was like every word was yanked uphill going higher in pitch at the end.

I was stunned into silence. I helped Kathleen up but didn't take my eye off the plaid man. He frightened me. No one should be this strong.

"Oh, she belongs to you! If I had known oh, if I had known. I have much gold and a few souls. I will buy her. Name your price."

"Not for sale," I said. I had never met another nonhuman who wasn't a vampire before and I was not enjoying the experience.

"Oh, everything is."

"Not her."

Barri came behind me and added "Yeah, not her," then gave Kathleen a long list of eternal sorrows for leaving her.

"Yes, her.” the strange man said. “Yes her indeed and the pitiful one as well."

"I said, no."

"My dear son of the Count, do you know I am dying? Do you know what you do to me? You saying no... your resistance... your protection. It only makes me want them more. Are you aware because I have lived 1,000 years I have had everything I want? All that is left is what you want. Now name your price because everything has one."

A bouncer came from around the corner and tapped the odd man on the shoulder.

"Sir, you need to leave."

He eyed the bouncer, all four foot of him eyed the six-foot-plus giant.

“No,” he said. “I’m negotiating. Don’t interrupt an elf as he negotiates.”

“Okay, let me walk you out,” the bouncer said.

With speed, much faster than me, the elf grasped the leg of the bouncer buried his hand in there, and yanked out dripping red bone.

The bouncer screamed and collapsed to the floor.

“How will you do that with no legs?” the elf asked and the turned to me. He wiggled the bone in his hand and said. “Now, we were negotiating…”

He had to see it in my face. He had to see the fear. That was a lot of strength. To much strength. I tried to reply back but my throat went dry. He could talk though he was unmoved as everyone in the club ran out screaming upon seeing the bouncer’s crawling body trying to make it to an exit.

I somehow found words and mumbled my reply.

“Is that a number? Go on speak up.”

“They aren’t mine to sell," I said scared like a child trying to get an adult to leave him alone.

“What do you mean, Son of the Count? Have you not made them your slaves?”

“No… they’re my friends.”

“Then I will take them.”

His eyes gleamed with a sickening delight as he tossed the bloody bone aside. I never heard it clatter to the floor. Screams, the bouncer’s gurgling, and the bass of the speakers drowned it out. Fear didn't let me move from my place. The elf’s eyes gleamed with a primal hunger, and his body shook with wanting. He stopped looking at me and eyed Barri and Kathleen.

Kathleen trembled behind me, her fingers clutched my arm,  her nails dug into my skin. Barri stood frozen, her eyes wide with shock. For once she had nothing to say. If It was just my life on the line I would have left. I am not a fighter. I'm a lover. Unfortunately, it was not just my life on the line. Despite my fear, shaking, and doubt, I dove forward.

I leaped to him with a punch that could shatter bones, but the elf merely staggered, a twisted smile still plastered on his face. He moved with a fluidity that was both mesmerizing and terrifying, his every step calculated, predatory.

Without warning, he lunged at me, faster than I could react. I barely had time to raise my arms in defense before he was upon me, his strength overwhelmed me. We crashed into the dance floor, the impact shattered it. My back burned.  My head bounced against the floor. Neon lights flickered and flashed above us to match the quick, violent tempo of the song. I really thought I was going to die.

His hands wrapped around my throat, squeezing with the force of a vice. I thrashed beneath him, clawing at his arms, but it was like trying to move a mountain. 

“Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.” he said. “I am your brother here. You cannot befriend them you must rule them or they will betray you. I beg you. Yield.” 

“No,” I spat back.

“Then you will be made to yield,” he said and grabbed my thigh with one hand and pulled out a bone.

I howled. I cried. I was confused. And I was so angry.

“It’s for your own good, Son of the Count. These girls…” he stopped his speech as both Barri and Kathleen crashed bottles against his head. They did not affect him. He swatted them away.

I managed to free one hand. I unsheathed my nails and slashed them across his face. It loosened his grip. I broke free.

“I guess I deserve that.” the elf said unamused. “We can be done with this boy. Again, I just ask you for your women?.” he rose and extended his arm to me.

Something snapped inside me. With a primal scream, I launched myself at the elf, sinking my fangs into his face. He howled in pain and I chewed. I chewed like a mad dog and ripped out every piece of humanity from his flesh. The taste of his blood was foul, like poison, but I didn’t care. I bit down harder, my anger gave me strength. The elf tried to shake me off, but I held on and tore at his flesh with all the fury I could muster.

Eventually, I got off of him and stood above him on my one working leg. He crawled away on his back, like a worm. His nose was gone, I had swallowed an eye and his face was more bone than meat. I felt a gross satisfaction with myself.

“You… you..” he stuttered and sputtered his words, he only had one lip to speak with now and part of his tongue was torn. “ You would do this to another elder species for them? You have stolen an elf’s face for what? Do you know what they are?”

“They are friends,” I said. Both Kathleen and Barri helped me up.

“Oh, this... this… you betray your blood for humanity. They will betray you y’know? You see me as an enemy but one day you will look at me as a friend. Wait until you meet my friends.”

And with that, he ran away.
