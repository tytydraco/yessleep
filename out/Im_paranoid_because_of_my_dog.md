I got a pet dog right after I moved out of my parents house when I was 20, I named him Gus, Gus is a fully black Rottweiler. Gus usually sleeps with me at night, but sometimes he decides to sleep in his dog bed, when Gus doesn't sleep with me I feel paranoid, as if somethings watching me but I've never looked to deep into it since I'm probably just getting used to living alone.

 But last night when Gus was asleep in his dog bed I felt like something was behind me, watching me as I tried to fall asleep. I turned over to see Gus just laying on his bed. I laughed at the small confusion, I must be paranoid there's no one there. I told myself.

 I turned back and tried to go back to sleep when I felt something grab onto me, but all over me not like a hand but like a blanket, going over me, only this felt more like it was trying to grab me, I turned back, Gus was still asleep and my room looked normal. 
  
 I grabbed my phone from my bedside and turned on the flashlight, and then I saw Gus's bed. It was empty. Gus wasn't in his bed. I looked around my bed and he wasn't there. I stood up and walked around looking for the glowing pair of eyes from my big dog, but there was none. 
   
 Then I heard something behind me, I quickly turned to see two bright circles staring at me, I ran to Gus but when I got close enough for my flashlight to be able to see his pitch black fur it wasnt fur it was skin, just pitch black skin. With two big glowing eyes. I screamed and ran to my light switch, flipping it on. 

 And there Gus was, laying in his bed, looking at me. I must have woken him up when I screamed. I took a deep breath and realized how crazy I was, I walked to my bed and sat down, leaving the light on as I went back to sleep.
 
  In the morning when I woke up, the lights were off and Gus was in my bed, I had a normal day. I went to work, went to the store, etcetera. I was watching the TV when Gus came and layed next to me, his head on my lap. I pet him and I felt that thing again. The bare skin, I pulled my hand back and looked down at Gus. Nothing was wrong, it was just Gus. I was a bit freaked out but I assumed I was paranoid again, I pet Gus while looking at him and he felt normal so I just wrapped it up to being paranoid and continued watching the TV.  
  
 When night came I took a shower, washed my hands and face and then made sure everything in my house was in order. I walked to my bedroom and got in bed, I pat my legs and called Gus who ran in and sat on my bed, I assumed he'd be sleeping with me tonight so I walked to the light switch and turned off my light. I got back into bed and cuddled next to Gus. 
  
 I woke up in the middle of the night and instead of feeling Gus's prickly black fur I felt that skin. I pulled my hand back and tried not to freak out. I shook Gus and tried to wake him, but when he turned back I saw three bright glowing eyes, and a wide toothy grin. I tried to scream but my voice wouldn't go. I tried leaning back and fell off my bed, hitting my head and I grabbed my phone.
 
 I ran out of my room and quickly called my mom, switching on every light I could find. My mom answered and I told her everything. But she didn't say anything, all I could hear was static. And then my lights started to turn off, like a shadow swallowing them. Then I saw that smile, then the eyes.
