The apartment building I was born and grew up in was torn down when I was twenty-two, why the fuck was it still here? I reached out to touch it, and it was real. The rough, patchy feel of the old bricks as I ran my fingers along them was familiar. The curse-words my little brother and I used to carve into the bricks by the stoop of the building were still there.

How the fuck was this possible? This had to be a trick, I was on a train just a second ago. Where the fuck am I? 

As I kept looking at old features that kept confirming this was my childhood apartment building, I decided to step inside. The familiar smells of cigarette smoke and sounds of feet stomping up and down the steps made me dizzy. How could this be?

“Hey, Carlo, what’s up man?” said a voice. I turned around and it was my childhood friend Leo Berletti. Leo died at the age of thirty-seven in a car accident. Him and I were the same age, and he’s supposed to be dead, so how the fuck was he standing in front of me? I fell back, almost fainting. “Carlo, what the hell man? You alright?” 

“I’m alright, I’m alright!” I replied. Leo reached out to help me up, grabbing my arm. I winced in pain as his fingers pressed against the stitches in my arms. 

“S-sorry, Carlo. I didn’t see those. How did you get them? Did your mom do this?”

I shook my head “no”. I didn’t want to say it because I didn’t know where the monster was. 

“Anyway, I hope to see you tonight. My dad got the three of us tickets to the Knicks Game tonight.” 

As we waved to each other and Leo ran off, I got a familiar feeling. What’s it called? Déjà vu, I think. Anyway, I get that feeling, but I don’t know how. I ran upstairs to my apartment on the fifth floor and stopped in front of the door. The scratches and patterns of paint chipping a were exactly how I remembered it as a kid. I pushed on the door and it slowly creaked open. I walked in and saw my parents asleep on the couch with multiple open bottles of whiskey on the floor. 

Then I heard a familiar noise, a loud thump over the muffled music of Joan Jett and the Blackhearts coming from my sister Theresa’s room. I tiptoed over to her room and pushed the door open. Inside was Theresa, an innocent thirteen year old girl, hanging from the ceiling, one of our chairs from the dining room tipped over under her. As her body slowly swayed and spun, I dropped to my knees. Then everything froze, but me. Slowly slithering out from under Theresa’s bed was a grey snake with the head of the monster’s human disguise. I jumped back as he stood up and fully took his human form. 

“There’s so much death in your life, Carlo. So much of it was avoidable. Wouldn’t it have been nice if your parents could’ve just cared more about their children instead of their addictions? Wouldn’t it be nice if you could’ve helped your sister out? But you were too young and scared. Reliving this moment suck! This moment, the moment of finding her dangling here, piss and shit filling her pants after her neck snapped and her body gave out. After she gave out, Carlo. She couldn’t take it anymore!” 

I turned around and wound up to punch the monster, but my arms couldn’t move. “What the fuck are you doing to me!?” I grunted. 

“I’m in total control here, Carlo. This is my domain.” 

The monster picked me up again as if I was a bug, and dropped me in his mouth. Again I felt like I was falling for days. Then I woke up   again in what seemed to be a funeral home. My brother Rocco helped me up, and I winced as he squeezed my stitched-up arm. Why the fuck did they keep touching that? 

“Carlo, you look a little rough. S’okay, I get it.  Lenny looks so peaceful, though. The way they did his makeup makes him look alive again.” Rocco began to cry and pulled me over to the casket. Inside the casket was my brother Lenny, the one who died of the overdose. His skin was no longer the sickly, pale color he had for the last four years. He didn’t look super skinny, or gaunt as the doctors said before he died. He looked full, happy, and as if he had lived a normal life. 
The scars and needle tracks he had given himself all over his limbs were hidden by a suit. 

As I reached out to touch my brother’s face, a hand touched my shoulder. I turned around and it was one of my friends, Rocco DiBenedetto. Him and I rose through the ranks of This Thing of Ours and got made around the same time. I thought he was my friend. He was the one who figured out I had a wire. He was the one who made me choke up about it and pushed me around, said I was acting “squirrelly”. 

“Hey, Carlo. Beautiful service. Your brother looks beautiful. You’re really a family man, payin’ for this beautiful send-off.” He hugged me and patted my back, hitting against my fucking stitches over and over again, then he backed away and sat down. Soon, a swarm of people poured in and sat down in the seats of the parlor. A priest walked in and shook my hand, and as he shook my hand his face began to slough off, revealing the decomposing, sickly gray face of the monster. 

“It’s an honor to do the service for your brother Lenny. I wouldn’t want it any other way.” The Monster slapped my back and went next to the casket, beginning a sermon. I stood there, frozen. What the hell has he been putting me through? These are my experiences but not how I remember them at all! 

“Brothers and sisters, let us pray for the passing of our brother, Lenny Cremonesi. This junkie bastard died of a heroin overdose because his mommy and daddy beat and neglected him! So he beat and neglected his own body!” The group of people began to laugh, and the combined laughter was fucking deafening. I covered my ears and fell to the floor, trembling. 

“But this is a celebration of Lenny’s life! Why should I and all of you do the talking here? Let’s hear from Lenny himself!” As the monster turned his head to Lenny, he rose out of the coffin and took a deep breath. Lenny’s corpse then stepped out, stiff and unbalanced. He looked at the people, then at me, and tried speaking. “Oh, right, the jaw sutures!” said the monster as he unwound my brother’s mouth. 

Lenny looked at me and uttered one word: “Rat”. Then the whole group of people stood up again and kept loudly chanting rat, pointing at me. As I shook on the floor, I looked up at Lenny who was pointing at me. The monster was on Lenny’s back, his arms wrapped around his chest and legs wrapped around Lenny’s thighs. From behind, the monster started taking bites out of Lenny, chuckling after each gulp. I started vomiting, and all of a sudden the chanting stopped. 

As I was on the floor with my hands over my ears and my eyes squeezed shut, the monster took one of the vases and smashed it over me, knocking me out. When I woke up again, I was in my previous home. The one I had left after making a deal with the feds. I looked up at the blood-red sky. Not a fucking cloud in sight. Maybe Mars was eclipsing the moon. I don’t know, I’ve heard about blood moons and shit but this was different. 

All the goddamned plants and shrubs and special grass I had put in my front yard was dead. All the dried branches had neither leaves nor flower petals, and the grass was brown. 

I walked inside the home and looked around. Immediately I knew when this was. This bastard was making me re-live shit, but how? I didn’t know what to do, so I ran out of the house and sat on the dead grass. As I looked around the neighborhood, I realized everyone’s plants were dead. Everyone’s homes also looked destroyed, but that couldn’t be. It was a lovely neighborhood, one that was full of active and prideful people who up-kept their homes. 

“I’m not going in!” I blurted out. The monster appeared next to me in his human form. His suit was pure white this time. He looked upset. “You can sit there and fuckin’ pout at me all you want, I’m not going in.” 

“Carlo, really don’t know where you are, do you?” 

“I’m in front of my house. My neighborhood. But it’s not really mine, is it?” 

The monster sat down next to me and wrapped his arm around my shoulder. “You’ll find out sooner or later where I’ve taken you. For now, get the fuck inside the house before I open up your stitching, bitch!” The Monster picked me up my my shirt and carried me into the house. He pushed me into the den and shut the door behind me. 

As I walked and looked around, I saw glass and clothing strewn about. This was the big, final fight between my wife and I. We hit and cursed at each other, destroying the expensive things we built up in our life. And then, as I stepped into the master bedroom, I saw her. The silk bathrobe I had gotten her loosely dangled off her hanging body. I went close to touch her but I couldn’t. Her head was leaning over to the right, and blood poured out of her nose. A puddle of urine was under her. 

As I stepped back, the door to our bedroom flew open, and in walked her brother, Bobby. He had the gunshot wound in his forehead that I had put there. As he walked past me, the exit wound was still there in the back of his head, with dried brain matter and blood caked around it. Behind him walked the monster, his sickly, gray face and beady black eyes in the open, and he was dressed in brown robes, like a monk. The monster handed Bobby what looked like a zipper head, and he opened up my wife’s robe. 

“What the fuck are you doing?” Bobby ignored me and rubbed my wife’s stomach. The monk put a finger up to his lips to tell me to be quiet. 

Bobby placed the zipper head under belly button then pulled upwards, opening up my wife’s abdomen and revealing a fetus. I fell back, getting dizzy yet again. Bobby pulled the baby out of my wife and placed it on the floor, then the monster came and used surgical scissors to cut the umbilical cord. The fetus stood up and walked over to me. I couldn’t crawl back, I was frozen. 

A whimpering sound came out of me as I shook. The fetus put its bloody, slimy hand on mine and smiled. “I could’ve been a beautiful baby, Daddy!” it said. The fetus then began wailing, its cry was deafening. Then the monster knelt down next to me. 

“So much death, Carlo. So much death in your life.” Then more people walked into the room. Some with bullet holes in their heads, some with missing limbs. I recognized them. These were the people I killed during my time as a hit man. They circled around me and moaned in pain. “So much death, Carlo” said the monster. 

I woke up on the platform of the station. A paramedic and an EMT were there. How the fuck did they get me out of the train if  the bastard welded the exits? I heard them mutter something, but I got up and ran way. Two officers started chasing me. As I kept running and was above ground, I pulled my phone out and saw the day: Tuesday. I knew where the boss would be, and I was going there and getting my fucking questions answered. 

I called an Uber and went down to Dyker Heights in Brooklyn, down the block of the Renegade Lounge, a bar the boss owned and stayed at some days. The car he was always driven around in, a 2022 Cadillac Escalade, was parked in the front of the bar.  I got out of the Uber and started walking down the block.
