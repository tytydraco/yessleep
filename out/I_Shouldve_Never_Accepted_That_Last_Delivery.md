I used to deliver for a small pizza place outside of Breneville. It was late one Saturday night, around 2:00 AM, when I got an order that seemed routine , two large pepperoni pizzas, cash on delivery.

The address took me deep into the mountains, where the GPS cut out and the roads turned to gravel.

I almost turned back. But I needed the tips.

Eventually, I reached a long dirt lane that twisted through the woods. No streetlights. No neighbors. Just trees pressing in tight.

At the end of the lane, a cabin sat in the dark. The porch light flicked on just as I pulled up. I carried the pizzas up the steps and. Door was open so I looked inside.

Three men sitting there playing cards and drinking. They looked like friends in their mid-20s. Laughing. Whispering to each other.

“You guys ordered?” I asked.

“Yeah,” one of them grinned. “Bring it inside.”

I hesitated. Normally, I’d never step in. But one of them held out a hundred-dollar bill. That was more than double the cost.

“Come on, man,” he said. “At least join us for a drink.”

The cabin smelled of smoke, meat, and something sharp I couldn’t place. I set the boxes on a table. That’s when I noticed the walls.

Mounted on wooden boards were…. bones. Small animal skulls. Antlers. A taxidermy fox with its mouth stretched wide.

“Hunters?” I asked.

They all looked at each other and laughed. “Yeah,” one said. “You could call it that.”

The man who paid me asked if I wanted to see their trophy room.

Something about the way he said “trophy” made my stomach knot. I backed toward the door.

“Thanks, but I should leave,”

Then I heard it. A click. My car alarm blaring outside.

I ran out. both my back tires sagged flat, rubber shredded.

“Guess you’re not going anywhere,” one of them called from the porch, holding a hunting knife still dripping with rubber.

The others raised weapons. One carried a crossbow. The other slung a hunting rifle over his shoulder.

Then they start shooting. The first arrow hissed past me, thudding into my car door.

The second clattered off the gravel near my feet. Then a deafening crack split the night , a rifle shot, dirt exploding inches from where I stood.

I dove into my car, heart hammering, turned the ignition, and floored it. The car lurched forward, tires shredded, wobbling uncontrollably.

Headlights barely cut through the trees as I barrelled off the dirt road into the forest. Branches scraped metal, the steering wheel fought against me, but I didn’t stop.

Another arrow smacked against the rear window. A gunshot shattered my side mirror.

I didn’t care. I kept driving until the car bucked, skidded sideways, and slammed headlong into a cabin.

The airbags punched my chest, knocking the breath from me. The impact echoed through the woods. Doors flew open in nearby cabins , there were three, maybe four more along this mountain corridor.

An older couple rushed out first, followed by neighbors, flashlights cutting through the dark. They yanked my door open, pulling me from the wreck. My words tumbled out in gasps, the three men, the weapons, the skulls, the trap.

Shock spread across their faces. The old man muttered, “Lord… you ran right into them.” They called the police immediately.

Later, I heard what the officers found.

The cabin did have a “trophy room.” But it wasn’t full of animal remains. Not only, anyway.

There were bones. Too large to belong to deer. Skulls. Human skulls. Sawed and cleaned like hunting prizes.

The three men were gone. Vanished into the woods before the cops arrived.

I quit my delivery job after that but I never stop thinking about what those three would have done if I hadn’t run in time.

Because I wasn’t their first.

And I sure as hell wouldn’t have been their last.
