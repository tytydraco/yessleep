I was 10 years old when I realized everything I knew about Santa Claus was wrong.

Before that, Christmas was something I tried not to hope for too much. My mom worked long hours, sometimes two jobs at once, and came home smelling like bleach and coffee grounds. She always decorated the apartment anyway. A crooked tree from the discount lot. Lights that flickered if you breathed on them too hard.

The presents had been getting smaller every year. Socks. A paperback book. One year, a toothbrush wrapped like it was a joke. My mom always apologized, her eyes shiny, saying things would get better.

I told her it was okay. But I knew why it was happening.

Santa had decided I was not good enough.

That changed when Travis Murchison told me the truth behind the bike racks after school.

“Santa is not real the way they say,” he whispered. “He is the devil.”

I laughed at first. Travis was the kind of kid who liked scaring people. But he leaned closer. “Think about it. Bad kids always get the best stuff. My cousin lit a mailbox on fire and got a dirt bike that year. Nice kids get skipped. Why would the devil reward goodness.”

I did not sleep much that night. I kept replaying the last few Christmases. Every time I tried to be polite. Every time I helped my mom without complaining. All that goodness had earned me nothing.

If Santa rewarded bad kids, then I had made a mistake.

So I started fixing it.

I stole candy from the corner store. I pushed a kid down the stairs at school and told the teacher he slipped. I broke a neighbor’s window and blamed it on older kids. Each time, my chest buzzed with something close to hope.

My mom noticed. Of course she did.

She grounded me. She cried. One night she grabbed my shoulders and said, “Please tell me what is wrong. I do not recognize you anymore.”

I almost told her. But Christmas was too close.

On Christmas Eve, she fell asleep on the couch still wearing her work uniform. I lay in bed listening to the building creak. Around midnight, something heavy moved on the roof. Not footsteps exactly. More like dragging weight.

Then the living room glowed red. Red like something alive.

I crept into the hallway.

A figure stood by the tree. Tall. Bent over. Wrapped in dark fur that looked burned instead of dyed. The air smelled like smoke and cold metal. I saw horns, not antlers and not decorations, curling beneath its hood.

It dropped a sack at the base of the tree. The sound was wet.

I shut my eyes. When I opened them again, the room was dark.

In the morning, the presents were real. A game system. New clothes. Toys I had only seen in commercials.

My mom sobbed. She told me she had been working nights for months, hiding the money, saving every dollar so I would not feel forgotten.

I hugged her. I told her she was the best mom in the world.

I never told her what I saw.

Now that I’m older, I know better. There is no Santa Claus. There is no devil sneaking down chimneys.

There is only each one of us, choosing day by day who we’re going to be… good, bad, or something in between.

Still… on certain winter nights, when the wind scrapes the shingles, my mind flashes on the image of what I saw that night. 

And every so often, I get the instinctive urge to do something unspeakable.
