In the quiet village of Radovish, nestled among the rolling hills and fertile valleys of North Macedonia, I lived a relatively peaceful life. My name is Marko, a curious boy with a heart full of dreams and an imagination that soared to the highest peaks of the nearby mountains. My room was my sanctuary, adorned with handcrafted toys and drawings that reflected the beauty of our Macedonian landscape. But there was one aspect of my nights that set them apart from any other child's in the village – every night, a man watched over my bed.



As the moon ascended in the Macedonian sky, this figure emerged from the veil of night, slipping As the moon ascended in the Macedonian sky, this figure emerged from the veil of night, slipping stealthily into my room through the cracked shutters. His form, shrouded in darkness, seemed to merge seamlessly with the shadows that danced upon the walls. At first, his presence was but a whisper in the night, a faint stirring of the air that sent shivers down my spine. But with each passing night, his visits grew more tangible, his silhouette looming larger against the moonlit backdrop.



I could not discern the identity of this nocturnal intruder, this mysterious man who haunted my dreams. His presence filled me with an inexplicable sense of dread, a gnawing fear that gripped my heart in its icy embrace. Yet, despite my apprehension, I found myself drawn to him, my curiosity piqued by the enigmatic aura that surrounded him.



As the days turned into weeks, I became consumed by thoughts of the shadowy figure who invaded my sleep. Who was he, and what did he want from me? These questions tormented my mind, haunting me with their elusive answers.



In the light of day, however, my family provided solace and sanctuary. My father, a sturdy man with weathered hands and a gentle smile, worked the fields with unwavering dedication, his love for our land evident in every furrow he plowed. My mother, a woman of grace and warmth, filled our home with laughter and song, her voice a melody that echoed through the corridors of our humble abode. And my younger sister, Ana, with her bright eyes and infectious laughter, brought joy to our lives with her boundless energy and playful antics.



But as the nights wore on, the shadowy figure's presence grew more ominous, his visits marked by an air of malevolence that hung heavy in the air. One night, as I lay in bed feigning sleep, he finally spoke.



"Marko," his voice was a cold whisper, chilling me to the bone, "You cannot escape me. I have chosen you."



"What do you want?" I managed to ask, my voice trembling.



"I want your mind, your soul," he replied. "You belong to me now."



From that night onward, his influence over me grew stronger. I began to lose control over my thoughts and actions, his voice a constant presence in my mind. He manipulated my dreams, turning them into nightmares filled with terror and darkness. My once peaceful existence in Radovish was overshadowed by this sinister force.



Days turned into weeks, and I became a mere puppet, my strings pulled by this malevolent figure. My family noticed the change in me – the distant look in my eyes, the strange behavior, the sleepless nights. They tried to help, but they couldn't see the true enemy lurking in the shadows of my mind.



One fateful night, the man took full control. I felt his cold grip on my consciousness as he whispered commands in my ear. My body moved against my will, and I found myself standing over my parents' bed, a knife in my trembling hand.



"Do it," he hissed, his voice echoing in my head. "End them."



Tears streamed down my face as I fought to regain control, but his grip was too strong. With a swift motion, I plunged the knife into my father, then my mother. Their eyes widened in shock and pain, and they tried to speak, but no words came out. The life drained from their bodies, and they lay motionless, lifeless.



As I stood there, covered in their blood, the man emerged from the shadows, his eyes gleaming with satisfaction. "Well done, Marko," he said, patting my shoulder. "You are truly mine now."



My sister, Ana, had witnessed the horror from the doorway. Her scream pierced the night, but before she could run, the man silenced her with a single, brutal motion. She crumpled to the floor, her bright eyes now empty.



In that moment, I knew that my life in Radovish had been irreversibly shattered. The man had taken everything from me – my family, my innocence, my soul. I was left alone in the darkness, a pawn in his twisted game, forever haunted by the nightmare that had become my reality.
