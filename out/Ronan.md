"Uh well. Kinda I suppose."

He shifted a bit

"What does that mean?"

"Well there ARE other stores. It's just that there is no real way of controlling which on you go to. And well ....there are people in some of them. They can be hostile at times. So I just like staying in one place for the most part."

"What do you mean you can't control which store you go to?"

"Once you close the door on a place it randomly generates a store behind it. You can tell which store it is if you memorise the doors but I haven't been to many to be fully honest."

I sighed. Even if he had given up on leaving, I was still going to try. But this dude looked traumatised. I didn't want to leave him alone and he seemed to know more about this place.

"Okay then...Ronan was it? I guess we can stay here for a bit. Where are you from? You don't sound like your from \[REDACTED\]"

He laughs a bit. He finds everything I say funny it seems.

"Oh yeah, I'm not. I was born in Wales. My dad's from Ireland though. Mum's British."

"How'd you end up here?"

"Same as you and everyone else. Went shopping and got trapped."

We kept talking and moved to another area of the department store that seemed to be just as infinite as the grocery store. There were some songs playing in the background. Surprisingly, I recognised a Maroon 5 song. Crazy.

I stopped to look at the new setting and Ronan spoke.

"So, Jack-"

"It's Jackson"

"Sorry, Jackson, why don't you tell me a bit about yourself? We are going to be here a while anyway."

I turned to look at him and realised he had the most beautiful, sad eyes I had ever seen, a shade of blue-green I didn't know how to describe.

"Uh, well we just met and all. I'll tell you things with time. Let's focus on getting out of here man."

He looked a bit offended but smiled anyway.

"You say dude and man an awful lot."

"Sorry I guess? But like, escaping?"

"No, no, you're good mate. And I told you, as far as I know, we can NOT get out of here."

I frowned. He seemed very adamant on that point but I wasn't ready to give up just yet. I had finally built a new life for myself and I wasn't going to forget about it without a fight.

This move...I was starting over.

Looking around, I noticed the same pattern. Screens with bold text with a similar message and items with goofy made up names. The ceiling were higher here though and the air here was a bit different, as if that makes any sense.

Only one thing was missing

"Are there no staff here?"

Ronan stiffened a bit. Weird.

"No...not right now. I haven't seen...them in a while."

"What ARE they exactly?"

He shuffled even more uncomfortably.

"I'll tell you but follow me first."

I looked at him funny. If he thought I was following him ANYWHERE he had to be crazy.

I guess my face betrayed my emotions because he sighed dramatically.

"Look mate, you either trust me or you don't and I suggest you do for now."

I considered it and decided he was right. I had no where else to go.

"Where are you taking me?"

"To find a new door and a weapon."

"Why? I thought YOU didn't want to move?"

Ronan rolled his eyes and sighed.

Rude much?

"We don't talk about them much here....they can hear you. If I'm going to tell you anything, I'm doing it with escape within reach and armed."

"Who's we?"

"Other people stuck here. I'll tell you if you want but not here."

I glared at him a bit but decided the information was most likely worth it.

"Well lead the way I guess R-dawg"

He scrunched up his nose a bit. He had freckles and was pale. I guess that's normal since he probably hadn't seen the sun in a while.

"Don't call me that. And follow me."

As we moved past racks of clothing it became apparent this dude had little to no idea as to where he was going. All he was doing was scanning for a possible door and a weapon which, I don't know what junk in here was going to help us defend us against those things.

There were racks and racks of coats, shirts, dresses, you name it they had it. Kinda. Unfortunately, the products weren't exactly wearable. The designs were messed up, with extra holes or a lack there of. When we passed by a display for gloves, each pair had a random amount of fingers, none of which made any sense. I thought about it and was happy I didn't eat any of the stuff from the store..

The only things that seemed to be done correctly were the shoes.

I stayed quite for the most part and tried soaking up the place.

The lights were harsh and cold unlike the warmer ones from the grocery store. There was also the mild scent of chlorine that seemed to just hang in the air. Guess that's what was different.

Being here was making my head hurt. I never liked those lights and the scent was bringing me back to summers in the local pool.

There wasn't much else to note of. It was for all appearances a normal department store, albeit this one went on forever. From what I could somewhat gather, we seemed to be slowly heading towards the register.

Ronan came to a sudden halt and handed me a bat.

"Woah, where'd you get this from?"

"While you were looking at the ceiling I led us back to my temporary little camp. I have some weapons I keep. I got this from a sporting store."

His "base" which was really just a few items very close to the register. Made sense since it seemed to be a constant.

I tested the bat out a bit, swinging it around.

"Ohhh yeah, this bad boy will break some knees for sure."

"Glad to hear that but fair warning, those weapons are more or less to stall. You can't fully kill those things. Just hold them off until you get to a door."

"Won't they just follow you through?"

"I told you, once a door closes it randomises what's behind it. Besides, those things seem not to care all that much about killing you and are busy building new stores to lure more people in. Now shut up about them, let's find a door."

"Whatever you say ol' chap"

He glared at me and frowned.

"Real mature mate. Shouldn't you be more panicked right now?"

I shrugged and followed him, slinging the bat over my shoulder.

"I grew up in a less than ideal environment. It's important to stay calm and there isn't anything bad actively happening right now anyway."

"Well worry more. Look for a door and let me know if you spot one."

He was trying his best to sound annoyed but he seemed happy to have me around. A win's a win. I had a friend.

I glanced behind me at  the self opening doors near the check out and saw that the sky was a vomit green, cars a neon orange and the grass a pale blue.

"Does...does the outside change from store to store?"

"Keep walking and I think so. It's always some impossible colour scheme. I've stopped looking at it."

"Okay I guess. How long have you been here anyway?"

"Long enough."

"You said that before and that's not a time period."

"I don't know. I've been here a while though."

He trudged forward, seemingly not wanting to talk about it further. I felt a twinge of regret and sped up to walk by him which wasn't hard. He was a few good inches shorter than me.

"Sorry. Nice shoes by the way."

"Oh. Thanks, I took them from one of those show displays."

"They look like converse. I'd take a pair myself."

He looked a little confused.

"Like what? And don't, you wanted answers so I'm going to give them to you so we need to find a door. Besides, I get the feeling that this place isn't going to be safe for long."

I glanced at him. Who hasn't heard of converse in this day and age?

"Don't worry about it. And one pair wouldn't-"

A door. This one was a pale purple. Maybe I'd call it lavender if I was an art student. Sadly, the world of chemistry seduced me before I could think of pursuing the arts.

I tapped Ronan on the shoulder.

"Does that door count?"
