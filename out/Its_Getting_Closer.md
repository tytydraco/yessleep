For some context I'm a 14 (m) and I train swimming and I love the water so I usually stay extra time just to swim 

Well it started of as the usually 14 laps swimming as a warm up and my coach Alex then asked me to get something from the storage room of the pool so I did

Well let's just say that the place was so creepy it was far away so you couldn't hear anything and the silence was loud and it was rotting on the walls and some of the supplies I go in and get the thing but as I get out I see something 

It was one of those women in scary TV shows you know white gown with black and blood on it and a messy hair covering her eye 

I saw her at the corner of my eye and when I went back to check if she is there she wasn't and I brushed it off and go back to training 

But on my 4th lap of warm up I swear I saw her around the middle of the pool barely visible because of the deep pool but I'm sure I saw her and there was one thing weird she was holding her hand a bit higher

But I brushed it off and said I was being paranoid because my coach is very strict and wouldn't believe me and I didn't want trouble and so I continued and also I have a really close friend named Jake in the training that I told about this entity that I was seeing 

He told me I'm probably insane and that I should stop freaking him out I understood though cuz he hates paranormal stuff 

But then the 7th lap came and I saw it same place but not same shape again her hand was a bit higher and this time holding a Knife and not a small one but a butchers Knife and if I told you I sped up   I would be lying cause I swear I was flying through the pool 

Well then on 12th lap I saw it again even higher hand and it was like she paused time cuz she wasn't on the ground but just above it and again I sped the hell up like there was no tomorrow and again she disappeared but this time for the rest of the training even after the warm up she didn't appear 

But when I was showering I heard knocking on my door so I knocked back at the knocker hoping he would leave but I swear to God a Knife came falling at me thank goodness I dodged it and then picked it up muttering "sick prank" but then a shiver run down my spine bcuz there was a note attached saying "I'm still here and I'm coming closer" with a photo of me 2 days ago sleeping so I hurried and wore my clothes and I run the flip out 

And I took a taxi home but I swear I saw her in the rear view holding her hand even closer to me and I know that it will take 2-3 more appearances for her to kill me and I'm scared 

I'm currently writing this to let you know and that also I saw her another time and now I see her in every corner I don't know what's real and what isn't and now I'm writing this wait oh no I just saw her in the screen reflection she had the knife around my neck so 1 more appearance
