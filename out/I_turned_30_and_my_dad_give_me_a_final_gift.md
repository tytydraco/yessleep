I grew up without a mother. Or at least, that is the story everyone told me.


She died in childbirth, they said. There were no photos of her. No framed smiles on mantels. No mementos in drawers. No slips of memory from relatives. It was as if she had been erased, like a file deleted from a computer.


My father never mentioned her and I learned quickly not to ask.


Instead, I inherited his stories. My grandfather, a man who brought back the art of discipline from Japan after the war, opened the first chain of gyms in the States. He modeled them after the dojos he had seen overseas, replacing tatami mats with hardwood floors and neon signage.


Then my father, brilliant and pragmatic, opened one of the very first warehouse club stores. Back when the idea of buying toilet paper in thirty six roll packs was considered insane. He saw the future before it arrived and he made it pay.


That was my family’s legacy. Not warmth, not closeness. Just a ledger of profits, a trail of bank statements carved into the American dream.


On my 30th birthday my father insisted on making me dinner. That alone was strange. He rarely cooked. He was a man of takeout bags and catered luncheons. But that night he stood in the kitchen, sleeves rolled up, working over pots and pans with the focus of a surgeon.


I had just landed a deal for my own company. We were rolling out AI driven shopping carts, machines that would follow customers through the aisles scanning items automatically. It was sleek, efficient, ruthlessly scalable. I was happy in a way I had not been in years. I wanted to celebrate with him, for once.


When we sat down at the table, the smell of roasted meat and herbs filling the air, he poured me a glass of wine.


“To us,” he said. His smile did not quite reach his eyes.


The wine tasted wrong. Not bad, just thin, with a faint metallic edge, like the memory of blood after biting your tongue. I told myself it was an expensive bottle I didn’t understand.


We ate. The meat was tender to the point of softness, almost too easy to cut. My father watched me closely, not like a man sharing a meal, but like an accountant waiting for numbers to settle.


I remember thinking, maybe this was it. Maybe my father and I had finally found something like peace.


Then, as the meal settled warm and heavy in my stomach, I noticed his hand brushing mine on the table. The way his eyes lingered, measuring. The words he spoke next were soft, reverent.


“You have done well,” he said. “Better than I could have hoped.”


I tried to smile but my throat tightened.


“You are me,” he continued. “You always have been. Every success proves it.”


The room tilted. My chest burned. The edges of the table blurred as if I were sinking beneath glass.


I looked up at him and saw not my father, but a reflection. A mirror behind the wrinkles and sagging skin.


“You think you are the son,” he whispered, his face sharpening as my vision failed. “But you are not. You never were. You are the vessel.”
And in that moment, I understood.


Every generation. My grandfather. My father. Me. There had never been a mother. Never been a wife. Just a single asset transferred forward, a continuity plan written in flesh.


I woke in his body, heavy with age, lungs tight, hands spotted and trembling. Across the table sat a younger man, my face, my posture, my future, staring back in dawning horror.


I stood up. I wiped the wine from my lips. My lips. I felt the familiar calm settle in, the relief of balance restored.


Then I walked away.


And I sat there, trapped in a dying frame, tasting the last meal of a man I would never stop becoming.


All at once, a vision. No, a memory. Not mine. Fading.


I see my grandfather at a table with his own father. Plates between them. A quiet meal. He is talking about the gyms he has opened, the discipline he brought back from the war, the future he is building.


Across from him, his father listens. Smiles. Waits.
The same dinner. The same ritual. A different decade.


Immortality is not a gift. It is a prison.


And the warden never leaves.
