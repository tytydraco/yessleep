If she’d known that, she wouldn’t have let me watch it.

She certainly wouldn’t have watched it herself.

Emilia and I were close. There are—*were* only two years between us. My little sister was close to turning 20 when it happened. I sometimes forget that it only happened five weeks ago.

I don’t know how long I have until it happens to me.

Now, Emilia and I were like *this*—just picture my index and middle finger coiling around one another. I know siblings are supposed to fight at some point—even close ones who claim to be best friends. But we never did, and it had nothing to do with us being special in some way.

We didn’t fight because we needed each other.

We were always that way. It didn’t come down to any one thing. Our deadbeat dad definitely drew us closer together, but our codependency continued after we moved out of his house two years ago. And our mother died during childbirth, so we were always blamed by our family members for her passing.

I’m skirting around the truth, in all honesty. The *key* reason for our tight bond was more wretched and disturbing than all of those terrible factors combined. For that matter, I don’t know whether those factors had *anything* to do with our condition.

Essentially, starting in our childhood, Emilia and I had issues with food.

Whether driven by genetics or environment, I don’t know. The cause is blurry, but the result is all that matters in the end, isn’t it?

We were never formally diagnosed with anything; Dad didn’t believe in head-doctors. But I blame myself. Always have. Being the older sister, I must’ve influenced Emilia, and I’ll never forgive myself for that. I did try to stop her from copying me, but I suppose she wouldn’t have been able to understand why I told her to keep eating, only to do exactly the opposite myself.

With adulthood came independence. Too much independence, perhaps. Emilia joined the same university as me, and we start living together. We had two flatmates—lovely girls who were vaguely aware of our eating issues. And last February, I came home from a lecture to find my younger sister giddily bounding around her room.

Emilia said that she’d finally found a way to kill ‘that craving’.

I remember only fragments of what she said. I was too focused on her alarmingly bloodshot eyes, though I told myself that the daylight must’ve been playing tricks on me; over the years, in my battle against inner demons, I’ve learnt not to trust my eyes. And that would be, throughout the unholy circumstances to follow, my undoing.

After all of this time, the only thing that really persists is a memory of her face; it wasn’t just the eyes, but the mouth. Her laughter was so slight, verging on silence. And her lips trembled, suggesting that, behind her breathy giggles, she might be teetering on the precipice of tears.

I do, however, remember Emilia telling me about the TikTok video responsible for her newfound ‘glow’. A video posted by some new-age influencer—one whose account I didn’t find when I searched for it.

And I, ever a tetchy elder in a young woman’s body, nagged my sister for using that harmful app—lectured her about how it was worsening our shared mental health problem. After all, for months, we’d promised each other that we were going to get better. Countless times, of course, as it’s never that easy.

“You don’t understand, Flora,” said Emilia. “I… I haven’t used TikTok since this morning. And I won’t use it ever again.”

I snorted. “Well done! Still, as much as I admire your five-hour break, let’s not brand you ‘an off-grid girlie’ just yet.”

“Listen, I haven’t been on my phone since this morning,” Emilia continued in a whisper.

This piqued my interest. “Well, *that’s* slightly more impressive… I’ve forgotten the last time you took a break that long—I reckon you still use it during your sleep.”

“Exactly, and I’m telling you that it all comes down to this video. I feel different, Flora,” my sister insisted, nodding at her computer’s monitor. “She told us all to put down our phones and follow a website link. So, I visited the address, and that’s how I found this downloadable file.”

Emilia sighed contentedly. “It could help you too, Flora. I only watch this video whenever I feel a craving for food, and that urge just goes away.”

Then, finally, came my frown. “Goes away?”

My sister’s hand hovered over her mouse, and she said, “Let me show you.”

But my own hand shot outwards, and I seized Emilia’s wrist, stopping her from opening the video. I wasn’t even sure why I had such a dramatic reaction; I was basing my worry on only her odd demeanour and what I assumed to be a Trojan-laden video file. Still, something felt off, so I told my sister I didn’t want to watch the video.

“And I don’t want you to watch it again either,” I said. “In fact, I want you to delete it.”

I should’ve made sure that she did so. I might’ve been able to end all of it before the obsession grew.

That evening, during dinner, I managed to eat half of my soup—not bad for me. Emilia didn’t even attempt her plate, on the other hand; yet, my stomach was the only one growling.

“Emilia? Are you okay?” I asked.

As she had been for hours, my sister was still releasing a series of breathy chuckles through her marginally ajar lips; tears, somewhere between joyous and tortured, stained her cheeks. And then, without responding to me or even looking in my direction, Emilia took her plate of untouched food to the kitchen, then she went up to her room.

She didn’t emerge all night.

Strangely, however, when I went to the toilet around 3am, I noticed a blue glow slipping underneath Emilia’s door. Something I found a little concerning, given that Emilia—in spite of her mental struggles—has always been one for early nights and early starts.

Over the following weeks, Emilia took steps backwards, not forwards. Before that wretched video entered her life, I’d managed to get the two of us to, at the very least, eat a little something at breakfast and dinnertime. But that had gone out of the window. My sister became noticeably frail.

Meanwhile, I was eating *more.* I forced myself to, at the very least, eat a full bowl of cereal each morning, as I felt that we couldn’t both spiral at the same time. In addition, I hoped to be a role model for Emilia—hoped she would copy me again.

But her daily ritual of watching that video continued, and she was watching it more than once a day. She was barely leaving her room. And the girl who entered wasn’t the same one who left.

There was always less of her afterwards.

In September, after I’d finished my course, Emilia moved into a new house. I returned home, hoping our father might be able to help me knock some sense into her. That was a tall order from him. Let’s just leave it at that.

Anyway, I eventually decided to pay my sister an impromptu visit.

She really had, as promised, stopped using social media, choosing to communicate with me via text messages—but those had become too sporadic by December. After a week without hearing from my sister, I decided that turning up at her house unannounced was the only thing left to do.

Emilia’s housemates wore strangely pale faces, which only exacerbated my anxiety whilst I asked questions about my sister’s welfare. One girl said she didn’t know much, as she spent most nights at her boyfriend’s place. The other said that she hadn’t seen Emilia since the Tuesday before—*9 days earlier*.

The only indication of Emilia’s presence was that blue, ever-persistent light below her door.

I ran up the stairs, despite protests from the gaggle of housemates huddling in the lobby. They didn’t follow me, however. Didn’t try to stop me. And now, looking back, I think they were scared to do so. There’s a lot that comes to mind in retrospect. Their shuddering faces. Their stammering answers.

Surely, something as banal as an unsociable housemate wouldn’t have been enough to fill their eyes with such fear; one girl’s eyes were pooling with tears.

I think there were things they didn’t tell me.

Stumbling across the unlit landing, a blue glow guided me towards Emilia’s room; it spilt through the crack below the entrance. But I didn’t shout for my sister. Didn’t knock. I rammed the handle downwards and shoulder-rammed the door—but it was unlocked, and I tripped through to the other side.

I found myself in a room with drawn drapes. A dark room—darkness somehow barely scratched by the blinding blue light of Emilia’s lit monitor. The only thing the screen illuminated, save for the carpet leading towards the door, was Emilia’s chair.

My sister sat in it, head resting on her desk.

My withered sister.

My unmoving sister.

My ears were ringing, but I must’ve screamed, mustn’t I? Must’ve screamed at the body, no more than threadbare flesh clinging to a frail skeleton. And, worst of all, this wasn’t the thing which terrified me. No, what terrified me was that my sister’s lower face—the top had decomposed to reveal her skull’s eye sockets—remained mostly intact. It revealed her lips.

She died with a smile on her face.

Perhaps I would’ve been haunted by that sight for longer, had it not been for a weightier terror drawing my eyes—the terror that prompted me to write this post in the first place.

A video was looping on Emilia’s screen.

I know you want to know what I saw. I'd like to tell you. But it wouldn't mean a thing to you. It has to be seen to be understood. It's more than a video. More than a tapestry of black and blue pixels, arranged in just the right way to put a wide smile on my face. To take the weight from my body.

I don't know who or what made it, but the video is not natural. Not of this world.

I tried to look away, but I found that I couldn’t, or wouldn’t. I became detached from the world. Detached from my senses. Detached from the screams of Emilia’s housemates. Detached from the conversations with paramedics who tore me away from my sister’s body.

Not detached from fear; I felt plenty of that. I still feel plenty of that, no matter how widely I smile at my wasting body in the mirror. Much like my late sister, I wear that awful smile on my face—still release that breathy laugh. That’s why I’m so afraid. I don’t know what’s inside me.

I’m detached, above all else, from hunger.

I watch the video, and it fills [me](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle).
