Hi, my name is… Drake? That sounds about right. Sorry, my brain is a bit foggy at the moment. In any case, what I want to tell you about bega… Must have been about a month ago now? And before you ask why I never left in that time, like come on. This was not exactly the natural assumption to what was going on.

Anyways, the first signs I saw started at work. The first thing that happened was some people just started falling asleep at their desks. I mean, weird but not that unusual. After all, we all know how draining the grind can be. They’d probably been given too much OT and just weren’t able to cope. I can’t exactly blame them.

I tried to wake them up at first, but they would just grumble And ignore me for the most part. Only one person actually gave me a straight answer. My best friend, Dave, actually looked up for a few minutes to have a coherent conversation. “Dude, you need to wake up, your going to get fired if they catch you sleeping on the job”

Both of us were well aware he couldn’t afford to be fired, nobody would be here if they could posssibly afford not to be. “I fell asleep? That’s weird, I just had like 5 cups of coffee.”

Sure enough, the evidence sat around him. An empty mug he probably brought from home, a Starbucks cup, and no less than 3 cups clearly made from the machine here at work. Anyone desperate enough to drink three of those really must have been exhausted. “I know the workload is hard, it’s getting to me too. Just, I recommend you drop personal stuff first, or if not start getting your resume together.”

Dave looked at me with a glassy eyed stare. “Yeah. No you’re right. It just feels like all I do these days is sleep, and work.” Almost before he finished speaking, he collapsed again. I tried to wake him up again, but it was no use. I had to give up, I’d love to help him, but I didn’t know how, and I had to do my job or risk being fired myself.

That was just the beginning though. This got progressively worse for the next two weeks. Soon enough, everyone at work took a nap or two during the day at least. Very few people were fired, I think the managers were all too busy sleeping themselves to get the paperwork through. Dave, however, was among them. Without his job, and with rent due soon. He decided to pack up to go stay with family while he sent out one applications. At first I felt bad for him, now I envy him.

It was after those first two week, things started to get worse. Car accidents skyrocketed, with people just falling asleep behind the wheel. A city wide ordinance to stop driving was put into place. I’m amazed they managed to get it through, but I guess everyone was just too tired to argue.

It was the third work, things really took a turn for the worse. People started falling into such deep comas, that they wouldn’t even wake up to eat or drink. The first death seemed like a fluke, scary, but not something that would personally effect me. The second death, at least that I heard about, was two days ago. Since then I made up my mind that I need to get out of this place.

Ive spent that time gathering the things I needed, plotting out where I would go, and writing this. As I write I’m completely ready as soon as I finished writing. The plan was to drive off as soon as I finished, but it probably wouldn’t be safe to drive while I’m like this. Maybe I could take a quick nap first?

I feel like that’s a bad idea for some reason, I’m just too tired to think it through all the way. Eh, screw it, who cares if I’m late for something. Since Dave is away I probably didn’t care about whatever it was that much. In any case, I’m really not sure that I could. I’m just-

I’m just so tired.
