So this didn’t happen to me personally, but to my cousin who lives in Toronto. He told me the whole thing over voice chat, and I honestly had chills. I asked if I could post it and he said fine, as long as I don’t drop names or specifics.

He was just standing in his house, looking out the front window. It’s one of those privacy-glass setups like a mirror from the outside, totally normal. He’s used to people walking by without a clue he's there.

But then this little girl walks by. Stops. And stares right at him. He figured she was just zoning out or maybe looking at something else, but for some reason, he waved.

She waved back.

That’s when it got weird. He started doing random gestures like peace sign, holding up fingers, etc. She mimicked every single one. Perfectly. Then he backed up from the window and she just… walked off, skipping like nothing happened.

He brushed it off until a few hours later, when the girl showed up at his door with her mom. They had apparently just moved in next door. The mom introduced herself, all smiles, and said something like:

 “She told me you played with her yesterday. Thank you, she doesn’t open up to many people.”

But he didn’t. They never even met. The only interaction was through the window, and technically, she shouldn't have even been able to see him.

Anyway, they handed him this handmade card the girl drew. Cute at first glance drawings, a black cat with white spots (weirdly just like the one he owns but currently at his mom’s place). Inside, there were chocolates and some super faded writing in pencil. Spanish. He had to rub over it with more pencil just to read it.

Here’s what it said, bit by bit:

"Estoy tocando la puerta" – I’m knocking at the door

"Quédate contra la pared, deja que te consuman" – Stay against the wall, let them consume you

"Si te sonrío, no sonrías de vuelta jejeje" – If I smile at you, don’t smile back hehe

"Clava tu pie al suelo y reza al Señor, ¿vale? Rabbit" – Nail your foot to the floor and pray to the Lord, okay? Rabbit

(“Rabbit” was his childhood nickname. No one uses it anymore, and it’s definitely not something a stranger kid would know.)

And the last one:

"Para romper el ______ mira El Chavo Animado con palomitas jajaja" – To break the ______ watch El Chavo Animated with popcorn haha

And finally, a little note:
"I learning english"

He said the whole interaction felt off. The girl didn’t talk at all except to say "bye," kept giggling, throwing hand signs, and oddly... she and the mom never even looked at each other the whole time they were at the door.

Could be a weird kid, or maybe she watches horror stuff and mimics it. But the fact she somehow knew things she shouldn’t? Yeah, he’s been a little paranoid since.

He’s hoping it’s just some weird joke or kid imagination running wild. But honestly, he told me he’s avoiding their house completely.
