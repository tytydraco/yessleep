March 5, 2033: It's strange, going to sleep, having a pleasant dream, but then the dream turns into a nightmare and you realize the nightmare is reality - that you spent weeks, waiting to wake up only to find that what was - for a fleeting moment - a brief respite from reality, was indeed reality itself, and nothing has changed.

April 17, 2033: This morning they served us beef stew. Such a relief from the over-preserved, salty food they normally serve. The beef was fresh and melty, the corn and carrots tender and hearty. I took one bite and almost vomited. Visions of the decayed corpses of my fellow soldiers flashed before my eyes, their bodies strewn about beside those of my kin who's flesh had been torn from bone. An eyeball rolls in my stew, staring at me, accusing me. Look at what you've done. Look at what you chose! I claw at my head, trying to suppress the intruder. Kill, consume!
 A gentle hand grabs my wrist, not threatening, but firm. Flesh torn from flesh, I rage and tear, blood coating my gullet in the neverending cycle to kill, consume. Black lighting courses through my head, violently it shakes my soul. My soul, locked in a battle to remain chained to my being, waxes and wanes, as if caught in a tug-of-war between a god and a devil.
 
April 22, 2033: Boots hit the ground as superheated metals fly to and fro amongst a future field, which would be known for the tale that will be told by our grandchildrenâ€™s grandchildren, when our faces are forgotten and our names but a whisper. It soon shall pass. So too shall I. My friends are trapped in a row of trees and my fight or flight has chosen a third option. Stand in utter stillness, deciding simply not to do anything. Crimson streaks the trees and banshees wail in the stagnant air. Kill, consume. A young soldier stares me down, speaking a language which eludes me. There is no soldier, and I'm not home. Nails scrape skin from muscles, thirst is quenched and a tale comes to its end. This one soul has made it's flight, and the dark tendrils have been sated. But the question still is. Am I still myself? I know my name and where I come from, but that no longer matters to me. I am born to kill, consume. 

September 1, 2035: The shattered remnants of my leg scrape and drag as I carry myself forward, prone in the smokey street. I am still myself. Somehow, I remain. Kill, consume. The others join me, a grand parade of flesh and bone, progressing through the desolate streets, a celebration of what was. Distant thunder cracks, and the others turn. Kill, consume. I struggle, but with resolve, to turn my batter form and follow. I am now but a servant, but still I remain. Thunder cracks. Bone shatters, flesh evaporates. Fire envelopes overhead, yet I crawl - driven by a needless desire to kill, consume. A boot pushes my head to the ground, my hands clamber to remove it, but my strength is failing me. Kill, consume! 
 A friendly face gleams down from above, a slight reminder of who I was, and who I am. It's me! My soul cries. I remain! A shower of lead courses through my head, and the darkness ends. A light remains, shinning through the darkness as boots tread forward, driven by the forces of balance. Survive, rebuild, they chant. And all is, as it should be.
