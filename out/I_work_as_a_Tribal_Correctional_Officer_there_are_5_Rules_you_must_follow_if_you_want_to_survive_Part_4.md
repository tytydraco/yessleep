I still have gaps in my memory from when I fell asleep to when I woke up two weeks later. All these years later and I’ve tried everything from deep meditation to hypnotherapy. Hell, my wife even got me in to see a neurologist that specializes in dementia. I’ve regained a decent amount but there are still gaps. I’ll do my best to try and recount what happened. Where there’s still gaps, I’ll do my best to try and fill them in.



I asked Will if he experienced the same thing. He said he did, but something never sat right with me. Whenever I asked him about what happened after we fell asleep, he always said he didn’t remember with a casual look on his face. The first few times I asked, I didn’t notice it. About two years after ‘the incident’ (what we ended up calling that night), Will and I were in my backyard drinking. About halfway through a bottle of whiskey, I asked him if he remembered anything. Now, it could have been the whiskey that lowered his usually stoic demeanor, either that or I wasn’t as drunk as I thought. “You’re sure you don’t remember?” I asked.



“Fucking hell, Jay. The only thing I remember is falling asleep in the car and then waking up.” Will said. His face stayed the same it always did, but when I looked in his eyes, I noticed something I’ve seen in the eyes of many people before, hell even my own, but never him. Will was afraid of something.



The look in his eyes kept me up at night for a while. I had only ever seen Will show two emotions on his face, anger and happiness. Even then, these were rare occurrences when they did happen, Will’s eyes always reflected how he was feeling. When he was angry, the green color in his eyes darkened. When he was happy, they would be a shade lighter than normal. What kept me up was that when I saw the fear in his eyes, they had these swirls of black. Almost like his pupils were bleeding their nothingness into his iris. It was the first time I saw this in his eyes, I only ever saw it again one more time.



I woke up in my room, two weeks after ‘the incident’. After explaining everything to my wife, Mary, she didn’t believe me. I couldn’t blame her. Who disappears for two weeks and just shows up saying “Hey, I saw some really weird unexplainable shit and was taken away by Homeland Security but I don’t remember anything that happened the last two weeks. How are you doing?” I sounded like I lost it. She made me go to counseling for a few months and it did help with some things but I still didn’t have any memory of those two weeks. She was a lot more distant after I came back and we went through a rough patch. After some couples counseling, she suggested we try some ‘alternative’ medicine to get my memory back.



There was this feeling inside that remembering was not the solution. When I tried guided meditation, I heard a voice in one of my sessions that caused me to snap out of the meditation when it spoke. “Jay. Will. Return.” It was the same voice from the recording.



I told Mary about the voice and where I recognized it from. After that, she filmed the next meditation session. Apparently I was muttering to myself throughout the session. I heard the voice again and, again, snapped out of the meditation. Mary was frozen, her face was white and she was crying. “What happened?” I asked. “Mary, what’s wrong?”



“Just listen.” She handed me her phone.



I hit play and watched myself sit in this empty room. I was facing away from Mary and there was silence, until about five minutes into the video. “Mary, Mary, Mary.” A female voice spoke.



I paused the video and looked back at Mary. “Who is that? Did someone walk in?” I asked.



Mary shook her head and pointed to the phone. I looked back down and continued watching. The voice spoke again, “Ryan was the message. D was the payment.” I felt my blood run cold as I watched me turn around. My mouth was open but not moving, like the voice was being projected out of me. “Jay. Will. Return.” The video ended.



“What the fuck is happening Jay?” Mary sobbed.



“I have no clue, but I need to know what the fuck happened during those two weeks.” I said. “There just has to be an answer there and I need to know.” Mary nodded and buried her face in my shoulder.



We agreed that meditation wasn’t working for regaining memory and did more to scare us than help. She convinced me to go to a neurologist that specializes in TBI, Dementia, and Amnesia. They ran some tests but I came back as normal and said they couldn’t help me.



After that she got me in to see a hypnotherapist. I was skeptical but desperate enough to try anything. The thing that’s cool about hypnotherapy (at least the one I went to) is that they have this whole professional video recording set up and you get the option to keep a copy of the recording of your sessions. Of course I opted to get a copy of all the recordings. They also come with professional transcriptions of the recordings.



The following is the transcription of my first session:



Carrie: It is June, 2018. My name is S. Carrie Clinical Hypnotherapist. Licensed in Hypnotherapy in \[redacted\] state. License number \[redacted\]. State your name for the record please.



Jay: Hi, my name is H. Jay.



Carrie: Okay, now that we have the introductions out of the way, what’s been going on?



Jay: I went through a pretty traumatic event about six months ago. I was gone for two weeks and I don’t remember anything that happened during that time.



C: So the goal is to remember what happened in those two weeks?



J: Yes.



C: I think I can help. Although, I do have to let you know that I cannot guarantee anything.



J: Understood.



C: Are you ready to get started?



J: Yes I am.



C: Good. Today we are going to start with what's called Regression Hypnotherapy. This should help with revisiting those two weeks and hopefully bring back some memories.



J: Sounds good.



C: Go ahead and get comfortable. You can lie down or remain seated. Whatever puts you in a more relaxed state.



\[Jay lies down then sits back up\]



J: Okay I’m ready.



C: Good. Now I want you to lay your head back and focus on the ceiling tile.



J: Okay?



\[Jay lays his head back\]



J: Like this?



C: Yes. Now, take a deep breath and hold it. While you breathe in, I want you to think back on a time when you were most relaxed. And breathe out slowly through your mouth. While you breathe out I want you to relax your body. Breathe in and hold. Now I want you to close your eyes and picture that time when you were most relaxed. And breathe out slowly, feel yourself sinking into the couch.



\[Jay has let his arms drop to his sides\]



C: Good. I’m going to count backwards from ten now. Breathe in and hold. Ten. Breathe out slowly, relaxing deeper into the couch. Nine. Breathe in and hold. Eight. Breathe out slowly, feel yourself falling into a deep sleep. Seven. Breathe in and hold. Breathe out slowly. Six. Breathe in and hold. Five. In and hold. Four. And out. I want you to picture the last thing you remember before the missing two weeks. Three. Now when I get to one, you will put yourself back to that memory. Two. In. And out. One.



C: Can you tell me where you are?



J: I’m in the back seat of this blacked out SUV, staring at the stars through the window.



C: Good. Now take me to the end of that drive. Where are you now?



J: I’m in a concrete room sitting at a table.



C: Is there anyone in the room with you?



J: No, I’m alone. Looking around there’s a pane of glass on the wall to the right of me. I can hear the hum of a speaker system but no voices, just breathing.



C: Are you able to move around?



J: I think so. Fuck!



C: What’s happening now?



J: I heard the door handle, I think someone’s coming in.



\[Jay is now looking at the door to the office\]



J: Who are you?



\[Jay is turning his head as if he’s watching somebody walk from the door to in front of him.\]



J: What do you want from me? Where’s Will? And more importantly, where the fuck am I?



C: Who are you speaking with?



J: That doesn’t tell me shit. Who the fuck are y—



\[Jay blankly stares at Carrie\]



C: Jay?



J: Jay must re–mem–ber. Jay. Will. Return.



\[It has been noted as important, by the Hypnotherapist, to specify that Jay’s mouth was unnaturally wide open while a voice spoke through him.\]



C: What the fuck are you?



J: \[unintelligible screaming\]



\[End of Session One\]



The footage abruptly ended after I screamed and I don’t remember any of this. I think Carrie just wanted me out of the office because when I came to, she was shaking and wouldn’t answer any questions I had.



After a few weeks of avoiding my calls and always being ‘out of office’ when I went in-person to the office, Carrie called me. All she said when I answered the phone was, “Tomorrow, two o’clock. Get rest and plan to be out of work for a couple days.”



I called the jail and let them know I was going to be out sick for a couple days. Mary drove me to Carrie’s office and we walked inside. “Hi, checking in for my appointment. Last name Jay.” I said to the woman at the front desk.



Carrie sat up from the chair and looked at me and Mary. Her eyes were bloodshot and her hair was disheveled. She looked rough, “You are the only appointment I have for the next week. I’ve been reviewing the recording from your first session over and over again. I spoke with my mentor and sent it for review to multiple different experts.”



Mary and I shared a look of confusion. “Carrie, what are you talking about? I don’t remember anything from that appointment.”



“Mary heard the same voice I did. Same message I got too. There was an addition this time.” Carrie said.



“What was it?” Mary asked.



“Jay must remember.” Carrie replied, “Followed by: Jay. Will. Return.”



Mary grabbed my arm and sat down. “I said that?” I asked.



“No, well yes but no. It was just like the meditation video that Mary showed me.” Carrie said. “You opened your mouth but something spoke through you.”



“Well what now?” Mary asked.



“Right.” Carrie said, “Well, like I said, I spoke with a lot of people since the last appointment. We are going to try something different.”



“I’ll try anything at this point.” I said.



“We are going to do what my mentor referred to as a ‘marathon session’. Normally sessions are only supposed to last about an hour, maybe two.” Carrie said while digging through notes scattered on the desk in front of her. “This is going to be multiple four hour sessions. Essentially, we aren’t going to stop until we get to the end of those two weeks.”



“Let’s get started. I’m ready now.” I said.



Mary gave me a hug and kiss before leaving, “Just call me when you’re done.” She wanted to stay, but Carrie insisted she go.



After she left, Carrie led me into her office and we got started. Only took four sessions, but now I remember mostly everything.



After waking up in the interrogation room, a man in a suit walked in. “Officer Jay. Glad to see you’re awake.”



“What do you want from me? Where’s Will? And more importantly, where the fuck am I?” I asked.



The man sat down in the chair across the table, “I’m nobody. Your friend is fine, probably having a nice nap. All you need to know is that you are safe.” He put a folder on the table in front of me and pulled out a notepad. “I have a few questions for you. How you answer them depends on how quickly we can move on with our investigation and you can just forget about all of this.”



When I looked at his face, he was expressionless until he said I could forget. As he said that, I could see a slight smirk and look of amusement on his face. “That doesn’t tell me shit. Who the fuck are you?!” I yelled.



Just then he nodded to the window beside us. “There’s no need for that, Jay.”



The door to my left opened and a man in a lab coat walked in. “Who is th—” I said. I was trying to stand up when I felt hands on my shoulders forcing me back down into the hair. When I looked around, I saw two men in full riot gear. “What the fuck? I haven’t done anything wrong.”



The man in the lab coat pulled a vial of clear liquid and a syringe from a box he sat on the table. “This will help you calm down and give us answers,” the man in the suit said.



“You haven’t even asked me any questions!” I yelled.



The suit looked annoyed. He sat back in his chair and nodded to the man in the lab coat, “Look, I’ve done this a lot over the years. Whenever anyone starts the way you have, we end up going to this method eventually. I’m trying to save time and get some straight answers, not some bullshit.” I felt the needle go into my arm. “It takes about thirty seconds to take effect.”



Once completed with the injection, the three other men in the room with us left. After a minute, there was a warm feeling that poured over my body. It felt like putting on clothes fresh out of the dryer. “What do you want to know?” I asked.



“Walk me through what happened last night.” He said.



I took him through everything that happened; the first perimeter check with Val, finding Ryan, and walking for what felt like miles to the clearing. I stopped when I got to the part of being swarmed by the footsteps. “We stood there with our backs to the sapling. I could hear the footsteps all around us and they were getting closer and closer. Then everything went black.”



The man in the suit, who had been writing notes while I spoke, sat back and looked at me curiously, “What happened right before it went black?”



“I felt a sharp pain in my head.” I said.



“Think back to the pain, describe it.” He said.



“You know that feeling when you hear a sharp whistle? Like that really sharp pain in your head?” I asked.



“I do,” he said. “Is that all you remember?”



I thought hard about that moment. Suddenly, I was able to see it, “Whoah, what was in that cocktail you guys shot me up with? It’s like I can see everything playing in front of me, just slowed down.” I said.



The suit continued writing notes, “Nevermind that, focus. Is there anything new you notice?”



“I do,” I said. I felt my heart drop when I saw it, “Corporal D is whistling.”



“And you didn’t know that before?” He asked.



“No, like I said, I just remember the pain and then everything going black.” I said.



“Why is Corporal D whistling significant?” he asked.



When he asked this, I got the feeling that he was looking for a specific answer. “I never said it was significant, just that it was something I didn’t notice before.”



He pulled a paper out of the folder and slid it to me. “Where do you think the rules came from?” he asked. “Rule number one: Don’t whistle at night.”



I picked up the paper and immediately saw the unmistakable title: ‘5 Rules Every Officer MUST Follow to Survive Graveyard.’ This one was old, the page was stained by the oil of years worth of fingers touching it. “This is the original isn’t it?” I asked.



The suit nodded, “Look closely at it.’ He said. “Notice anything different about the copy you were given?”



I looked it over carefully. All the rules were there. The wording wasn’t any different than what I saw before, that was until I got to the very bottom of the page. “Created by Agent Smith, J. 1975,” I read. When I looked up, I saw the suit was watching me. I looked closely at him and noticed his hair was white and his face wore the wrinkles of years of stress. “You’re Agent Smith, aren’t you?”



Agent Smith smiled with amusement and chuckled softly. “Yes, that’s me.”



“Do you know what the woman wants with us?” I asked.



His face dropped, “No–”



He was cut off by the sound of wet footsteps approaching the door. “Wrap it up Smith,” a voice said over the speaker.



The footsteps stopped. I looked at Smith, he looked terrified. The room fell silent. After a minute there was a high pitched laugh, “Hehehehehehe.” Immediately after there were two loud smacks on the wall by the door. “Jay. Will. Return.” the voice spoke again.



Smith looked at the window, “Fuck, get us out of here!”



The lights went out. In the room there was only the faint red glow of the security lights pouring through the door frame. “Smith, what the fuck is going on?” I asked.



“I don’t have time to explain right now, we need to leave, let’s go.” Smith motioned to the window.



“How are we–” I was cut off by the sounds of screaming coming from the other side of the door.



“Jay. Will. Return.” the voice continued.



That’s when we saw the shadow of the legs standing at the door. There was a loud ‘bang’ on the door. To our horror, when I looked at the door, there was the bulge of a dent in metal. Another loud ‘bang’ and the door shook. I looked at Smith who was desperately trying to break the glass. Through the darkness I could see figures on the other side doing the same. “I don’t think we have much time, Smith. That door can’t take much more.” I said, panicking.



Another ‘bang’, the door bowed at the top and I could see the ceiling tiles just outside were coated in blood. “Jay. Will. Return.” it spoke again.



I grabbed the chair I was sitting in and began smashing the window with it. There was another loud ‘bang’ on the door. I looked back to see the damage and noticed the door was almost open. Smith grabbed the other chair and looked at me, “On the count of three. Ready?”



I nodded. “One” I said.



“Two,” Smith said while holding the chair up.



We both yelled “Three,” swinging the chairs with everything in us. The window shattered. Bits of tempered glass covered the floor. Just as we put the chairs down, the air was filled with the sound of blood curdling screams pouring through the door.



As we climbed through the window, Smith pointed to a slot in the window frame that housed a thick metal door. “Get clear of the window.” He yelled, I could barely hear him over the screams.



I jumped to my feet in time to turn around and see the door fly open. As the metal door slid into place where the window was, I saw what broke the door down. It was the woman from the woods. “Jay. Will. Return.” she yelled as she bolted to the window. The speed she traveled at was unnatural, quicker than I could process, she was already at the window.



Smith grabbed me as the metal slammed shut. “Let’s go,” he said. I turned around and ran with him and a group of people through the door behind us.



“Jay. Will. Return.” the woman shouted.



I looked over my shoulder to see her standing in the room we just came from. “Wha–” I stammered, “How?” When I looked back ahead, I saw everyone else had stopped. Before I could react, I ran right into Smith. He didn’t even budge an inch, it felt like running into a wall. “Shit,” I spat. “Why did you stop running?”



Everyone was standing in the middle of the hallway. I looked around and counted four people, three men and a woman, all in suits. They all were frozen and shaking in fear. “Jay, don’t run.” The woman in the suit said.



I looked straight ahead and saw that the woman was standing ten feet in front of us. Something felt off. When I looked past the woman in front of us, I saw what caused the two thuds on the wall earlier. “Oh my god.” I said.



The two men in riot gear that held me down earlier were pinned to the wall on either side of the door. The woman had taken their batons and driven it through their chest and into the wall holding them up about two feet off the ground. They were cut up to the point of almost being unrecognizable. On the wall above the door, written in their blood, was, “Jay. Will. Return.”



“What do you want from me?” I yelled.



Immediately after, every light flickered and went out. One, by one until it was pitch black. “Where’s the emergency lights?” one man asked.



There was a deafening scream followed by the sounds of footsteps. It was the same footsteps I heard in the clearing. “Jay. Will. Return.”



The lights came back on with a loud click. The woman was gone. “Who’s still breathing?” Smith asked.



“I am.” I answered. When I looked around, however, it was just me and Smith. “Where’s everyone else?”



The two bodies were still on the wall in front of us, but there was no sign of the group we were just with. “No clue.” Smith said. “There’s not even a trace of anyone else.”



We walked around the corner and heard coughing. “You hear that too right?” I asked.



Smith nodded and opened the door to his left. “Hey, you okay?”



The room was dark and I couldn’t see who Smith was talking to. “Who is it?” I asked.



Just then I saw Will walk through the doorway. “Holy shit, you’re alive?” Will asked.



“Why would you think otherwise?” I asked.



“The woman broke down your door.” Will said. “All I could hear after that was screaming. When I finally got out of the room, she had just finished with the two standing guard. I closed the door and tried to hide. Next thing I knew, Smith here opened the door.”



“Great reunion, but we need to fucking go.” Smith said.



We followed Smith through the maze of hallways and doors. We finally arrived at a big red roll door. “Is this the way out?” I asked.



“Yeah,” Smith said. He walked over to a panel on the side of the door and pressed a button. “Let’s hope it’s not on lockdown.”



A siren alarmed and the door began to open. When the door opened enough to see outside, my stomach dropped. There was a dirt trail leading from the door into a dense forest. “What fresh hell is this?” Will asked.



The light from the room we stood in lit up the trail and revealed a trail of blood that started at the door and led off the trail and into the woods. I heard a voice in my head, “Jay. Will. Return.” I looked at Will and could tell by the look he gave me, we received the same message.



As we stepped through the door, I woke up in Carrie’s office. “Holy shit.” I said.



“That was pretty intense.” Carrie said. She was shutting off the camera. “You were under for about three hours.”



“Why didn’t we go the full four?” I asked.



“Give me one second, I need to pull up the footage and see if the camera picked it up.” She said.



“Okay?” I said.



She pulled up the last ten minutes of the recording. All was normal, I was talking about what I was seeing. “Jay. Will. Return.” The woman’s voice whispered. It was faint but clear.



Unlike last time, there was no evidence it came from me and the camera covered basically the whole room, including Carrie. It was clear she didn’t say anything. “That wasn’t you was it?” I asked.



“Of course not!” Carrie said.



Just as she put the camera back, we heard the voice again. “Jay must remember.”



We froze and looked at eachother. The room went dark and I could hear the faint sound of drumming coming from somewhere inside the room. It went on for what felt like eternity, but in reality was only ten minutes. The lights came back on and I saw Will standing in the doorway of the office. His eyes were rolled back only exposing the whites of eyes, his mouth hung open and he walked with unnatural and jerky movements into the room. “Jay. Will. Return.” It wasn’t the woman’s voice this time, it was Will’s.



“What the fuck Will.” I yelled. “What’s wrong with you?”



The lights went out and I heard a hollow thud on the ground. When the lights turned back on, Will was gone. I looked at Carrie and fell onto the couch. Carrie sat on the ground against the wall. We agreed to take a short rest before starting the next session.
