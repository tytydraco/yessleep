I won't live to be 16. I've been stuck at this hospital bed for half a year, and at the start, the Make a Wish people showed up.

It wasn't one of my worst days, but I couldn't stand the way she looked at me. I was dead already; she wasn't seeing me, she was seeing a ghost.

Then she kept asking if I was sure, making me repeat myself. I was too tired to be mad but needed her to stop. So I said it.

I want you to cure my cancer.

I should feel bad, I guess. She left my room crying, but no one came back. Later, I can't remember what day, a nurse showed up with this laptop. It's easier to use than the tablet, and it's helped a little, when I can focus.

Another nurse showed, or maybe the same one, it's hard to tell sometimes because of my eyes, and she asked me what I wanted Santa to bring me. I said I was too old to believe in Him, but what I imagined myself saying was:

I want him to kill me.

I managed not to cry until she left; crying made me so tired I fell asleep. Everything went hazy, but I kept thinking about it. In my dreams. I don't want to live like this anymore.

I'm so tired. I'm tired all the time. I hurt, they drug me, I get confused, I start hurting again.

It wasn’t too awful, when there weren’t too many tubes. Now you’d trip on them if you walked into my room.

I started waking up late at night. When it’s just the noise of the machines and me breathing like a dying horse. He was just there, one of those nights, close to the door, dressed in red.

“Nurse?” But he didn’t answer when I asked him. I just noticed some red clothes; it was too dark and my eyes too bad. I could see the little dots where his face should be, and a bit of white. I fell asleep, I’m sure of it. I was holding Tabby, petting her white fur. Cats can be scary, when you wake up and one is just staring at you.

I need to finish this. I don’t want to fall asleep again with the laptop on.

I knew who He was when he got closer. He got closer every night. I could see enough last night. It was Santa. He’s big, all dressed in red, and smells like piss and dirt. I could see his face. I could see his face because he was so close. I think he tried to tell me something.

One of us was crying but I couldn't tell which. I was too tired to feel surprised when I woke up this morning, still alive. But I think tonight. It has to be soon, right?

My parents came around, but I couldn’t keep my eyes open for long. I hope they don’t come back; they make me want to cry, when they look at me, when they try to talk to me. There’s a little tree and a box all wrapped up in shiny paper. It’s red like Him.

I hope it’s tonight.
