I found my step daughters body on a Friday morning, exactly one week before her sixteenth birthday. I’d been calling her for breakfast, receiving no reply, so I went upstairs to check she wasn't sick.

A make-up counter had been pushed against the bedroom door, and through the narrow gap I could make out a pair of legs trailing over the edge of the bed. Barging my way inside took five minutes.

Melanie lay sprawled across the mattress, her left cheek covered with dried saliva. She’d swallowed a hanful of pills and slipped away peacefully during the night.

In the final weeks of her life, Mel and I had been taking these long walks on the beach. We’d march along the coast until the sand turned to jagged rocks, then we’d do an about-face and come straight home. The two of us talked about every subject under the sun: school, her artwork, my life before I met her father. Everything *except* the reason I kept hearing cries coming from her room late at night. My husband, Michael, was up to his eyeballs with work, so the task of unravelling this mystery fell on me. Unfortunately, there’s no instruction manual for getting moody teenagers to open up.

Nobody could put their finger on why she did it. Although, behind my back, those blessed with clairvoyance insisted ‘warning signs had been missed’. What’s that saying, after the war, everybody’s a general? Well, after the funeral, everybody suddenly has a PhD in child psychology—they simply didn’t feel like lending their services until it was already too late.

After Melanie passed on, the days were difficult, but the nights became impossible. Michael would stumble around the house, rummaging through the wooden cupboards for alcohol, hurling empty bottles against the wall. Now and again, he’d shake me awake and unload a barrage of questions about Mel, his foul whiskey breath blasting me in the face. He wanted to know about things she said, things she *didn’t* say, hints she might’ve dropped. All in an attempt at piecing together her mental state during her final moments.

Two weeks ago, out of the blue, he decided the blame lay squarely on Mel’s maths teacher and waited for the poor guy outside her former school. A circle of students recorded him knocking out the poor bastard’s front teeth while screaming, “Give *my* daughter a C+ will you?”

Good thing he could afford to fork out for a very expensive lawyer.

Afterwards, I told Michael the drinking needed to end—that pointing fingers wouldn’t bring anybody back.

He shoved me. Hard. Hard enough to bruise my arm. I was too shocked to say anything. My mind immediately flicked through the classic excuses like a rolodex: he was exhausted. And stressed. And processing a mountain of grief.

I fooled myself into believing the situation wouldn’t escalate. But then I arrived home late one night and found a teal journal on the lounge table. Michael sat there with his fingers steepled beneath his scraggly beard. While rearranging Mel’s bedroom furniture he’d discovered a hidden recess behind the wardrobe. Hidden inside, there was a secret diary.

I hovered in the doorway trying to work out whether he’d read the damn thing already. He hadn’t.

We couldn’t agree on what to do. I said intruding on his daughter’s innermost thoughts insulted her memory. His eyes whipped between me and the little book, and then his face twisted.

I kept saying, “Once you read it, there’ll be no *un*reading it,” until he agreed to take a walk so he could chew on what I said. On his way out of the room he kicked over a waste bin.

Alone in the house, I contemplated how to make him see sense. Mounted against the side wall was a younger picture of Mel with her face painted like SpongeBob SquarePants. She loved to draw and had ambitions of becoming an animator, so all this might’ve been over a collection of silly doodles. Still, she'd hidden it for a reason.

Mike barged through the door sooner than expected, a fresh bottle of whiskey in hand. He pulled a chair up to the table and sat on it backwards.

“I’m reading the fucking thing, and *you* can’t stop me,” he said after an uncomfortable pause.

When we first met, he’d been a soft-spoken nerd juggling the position of CEO at one of WIRED magazine’s ‘Top 5 most exciting tech start-ups’ with raising a moody thirteen-year-old daughter, alone. Around the time our relationship began, some Silicon Valley tech bros floated the idea of acquiring his company and, under my guidance, Mike traded in the wolf-print t-shirts for fancy suits. I coached him through the fancy gala dinners and cocktail parties, quickly redirecting the subject whenever he stumbled into another social faux pas.

With love, encouragement, and endless support, I’d moulded him into a success. And call me crazy, but I’d continued to love and support him despite the fact our marriage had gone up in smoke. I wasn’t ready to give up on him yet.

I slid the diary away from his grasp. “I’ve had some time to get my thoughts straight, and I want you to hear them out. Five minutes is all I’m asking for. Then you’re free to do whatever you like.”

“Whatever her majesty pleases.”

Now and again, he savoured another swig from the bottle without spilling too much. He hadn’t acted this animated since before the funeral.

My hands shook as I grabbed a zippo lighter from my pocket and lit a cigarette. Six months in close quarters with my emotional tinderbox of a husband left me shakier than a soldier in a foxhole.

I said, “Now Michael, I loved Mel—”

Hot air snorted through his nostrils.

“I *loved* her,” I continued, “just like I love you. And not only that, but I was a teenage girl once, and when *I* was having trouble with my father—”

“Your *foster* father.”

My hands balled into fists. I took great pride in my patience and understanding, but we all have limits. “If I’d ever caught him reading my diary, it would’ve been a permanent black mark on our relationship.”

“Black marks are the least of my fucking worries right now.” His voice came out strained. I reached out to lace our fingers across the table, but his hand reeled away.

I sighed and said, “What are you hoping to get out of this?”

He leaned forward. “Nobody could tell me *why*, Ruth. Not you, not any of Mel’s classmates, nobody. At the funeral, everyone kept saying that they couldn’t believe it. Then they all gave me this look like they were expecting me to fill in the blanks, and all I could do is fucking shrug. I know my daughter. And what she did, she wouldn’t have done without a really, *really* good fucking reason. I want to know what that was. And this,”—he stabbed the diary with his forefinger—“might have it.”

I said, “Michael, you were a great dad. World class even. But the past year, with the whole acquisition thing, it created this…*distance*.”

His fingers tighten around the bottle. “I called home every day.”

“But half the time you weren’t even listening. The other half you grumbled about legal mumbo jumbo.”

“And I suppose you and Mel were besties? What, were you going on spa weekends together? Painting each other’s toenails?”

“I am not, nor have I ever, implied we were besties. But whether you wanna believe it or not, we did have *a* relationship, and anybody could have seen how blue she was in those last few months.”

“Then why didn’t she say anything?”

“Probably because she didn’t want to give you another problem to worry about.”

“Yeah fucking right. It’s awfully convenient that you never mentioned this before.”

“Don’t you dare gaslight me. Why don’t we go through all our messages over the past year and see whether I mentioned it? We can tally up how many times you replied ‘the sale should only take another few weeks’.”

“I was doing it for *her*,” he snapped. The white-hot fury in his voice made me flinch. “I wanted to get the fucking sale done so we could—”

“You’re missing the point. No matter how good your intentions, you missed stuff. Mel’s started doing worse at school. She was skipping meals. She stopped hanging out with friends. Now can you at least admit the possibility that if she was struggling, she might not have mentioned it to her dad who was already on anxiety medication?”

“Of course you’d throw *that* in my face.”

Now there was something in the air between us. An implied threat. I needed to tread carefully.

Softening my voice, I said, “Michael, I am not *throwing it in your face*. I’m just saying you’re grasping for an explanation that isn’t there. I remember one day, Mel came home from school all gloomy. I asked if she wanted to get some ice cream, but she insisted she was fine and kept asking when you were gonna call. And when you finally did, you were worked up about some executive meeting, so she just kept her thoughts bottled up.”

“Okay. Fine. You’re right. I’m a selfish piece of shit who neglected his daughter. But the good news is that means I can’t fuck things up any worse by reading her diary.”

“Stop putting words in my mouth.”

“I’ll tell you what Ruth, sure, I probably missed some things. But guess what, all those things? They’re gonna be right in here.”

As he waved the diary in midair, my anxiety cranked up a notch. “So you’ve really got no problem pissing on her memory?”

“None at all. You ready to throw in the towel yet?”

I stubbed out my cigarette in the ashtray. Time to bring out the big guns. “What if she wrote about you? What if you get near the end and there’s a passage—”

He was on his feet in a flash. In his anger, Michael filled the entire room. “You know, you’re so desperate for me to *not* read this fucking thing, it’s almost like *you’ve* got something to hide.”

My heartbeat forced its way up into my temples. All the grief and alcohol fuelled Michael’s paranoia. Or maybe it gave him the courage to say what he really thought all along. Either way, he’d made his decision. I rushed in the direction of the door but without warning he flipped over the table. The bottle and the ashtray spun onto the carpeted floor.

My husband stepped in so close his foul breath made something sour regurgitate up my throat. His arm shot out, creating a barrier against the wall. “I think you know something. I reckon without me here to play peacemaker, this place was like a fucking minefield.”

“Michael…please,” I said, craning my head sideways. “You’re not thinking straight.”

“I think some shit went down between you and Mel and you’re afraid she put it into words. She told me about the arguments you two kept getting in. How she needed to take these long walks to get away from you.”

“You’ve been mixing the pills with alcohol.”

“I bet you sent me away so you could cover your ass.” He held the diary inches away from my face while his bulging eyes crawled all over my body as if searching for a confession. “What’s the matter, did I get back too soon and fuck up your plan?”

“Call Dr. Mercer. Please. Tell him—”

“A lot of shits starting to make sense now Ruth. Your whole life you’ve been a bit of a bad luck magnet, haven’t you?”

“…What?”

“Like that ex-boyfriend of yours, what was his name? Simon? Sam? Stabbed him in the liver, didn’t you? You cried self-defence, but he said you caught him texting his secretary and flipped out.”

“Lashing out at me isn’t gonna bring back—”

“Or how about your foster mom. You were fourteen when she had her accident right? I remember Peter said she took that tumble right after they got the rubber stamp to adopt a second child. What’s the matter, did widdle Wuthie not wike the idea of sharing her pawents?”

Deep in the pit of my stomach, the rage cranked up a notch. “You’re sick.”

“Am I? Mel’s death sure was awfully convenient timing, what with the buyout. That deal was worth a fuckton of cash. What would’ve happened if Mel dropped a bombshell about you acting like a giant bitch before we got all the details ironed out? A dilemma like that, all that money on the line, it could drive a person to do something crazy. Like say ground up some pills and slip them in somebodies’ food.”

On pure instinct, I slapped him clean across the face. Michael reeled for a moment, touched his left cheek, and then his fingers clamped shut around my windpipe, tight. My palm crawled all over his face, hamming his nose, scraping his eye, until he slammed my head against the wall. The world and everything in it blurred. I woke up in a staggered heap on the carpeted floor. I’d bit my tongue so hard blood was running down my chin.

Towering over me, two versions of Mike orbited one another, defiling his daughter’s memory by nosing through her most intimate thoughts. Who even knew what she wrote in the stupid thing? It could have been very good or extremely bad. If it was bad—like say a fictional creative writing piece about her wicked stepmother—this would only fuel Michael’s psychosis, and thanks to the expensive lawyer, there wasn’t much he couldn’t get away with…

But how did I escape with him blocking the door? Almost blind, I crawled across the floor on my hands and knees until my fingers landed on the whiskey bottle. Amber liquid swirled around the bottom. I blinked away most of the double vision and glanced about the room. Up ahead the bin sat against the wall. Bingo.

I crawled over there, cradled the bin against my chest, and doused the contents in flammable spirits.

“What the fuck is this?” Michael shouted. Jaw clenched, he spun toward me, journal in hand. Towards the back, triangular scraps of paper poked out from the spine, almost like a section got ripped out in a hurry.

I’ve no idea what happened to that diary section. Maybe Mel wrote something she regretted afterwards. Or maybe she spilt Pepsi over them. Either way, Michael looked ready to explode.

“Where the FUCK are the missing pages?"

I grabbed the lighter from my pocket, ignited it with a roll across my leg, and held it above the bin. “Right in here darling.”

A mountain of letters and bills lay inside. No ‘missing diary entries’, but the crazy bastard didn’t know this. Not too shabby for a plan I improvised on the fly…

We faced each other in silence. A standoff. Then, Michael’s hands slowly rose. “Honey…”

The lighter dropped into the bin. Thanks to the alcohol, the papers ignited quickly.

He blitzed toward me and swiped the BBQ out of my hands, which caused it to vomit flaming papers across the floor. He went crazy stamping out what—he believed—to be his daughters’ final thoughts.

Still dazed, I hoisted myself up using the wall. A smoke alarm started wailing in the downstairs landing.

The diary pages blackened, curling along the edges. As Michael stamped the flames, repeatedly stumbling over in his drunken state, the carpet caught fire in a dozen or so places, and embers spiralled into the air. As flames spread across his legs, racing up his torso, he rolled around the floor, screaming, shrieking, thrashing, spreading the blaze even further. A stench of roasted meat engulfed the oven of a room as the skin on Michael’s face dissolved, dripping from his skull in steady streams.

Eyes squinted against the rising smoke, I staggered toward the hall and made a desperate break for the front door. Then outside, I took a long, nourishing gulp of cold air.

Behind me, windows throughout the ground floor glowed bright orange. The ugly house seemed to examine me. Judge me. Mock me about the dirty little secrets tucked away inside. A crowd of neighbours quickly gathered to watch the inferno.

I didn’t cry the night I found Mel’s lifeless body spread out across her bed, her face a ghostly pale white, and my eyes stayed bone dry at the wake while our closest family and friends offered their condolences one after another. But watching those brave firefighters fail to keep my marital home alive, it was impossible to keep my emotions buttoned down.

Was I a perfect mother-in-law? Hardly. And could I have done more to help Michael process his grief? Possibly. But I had nothing to do with Mel’s death and I’ve got zero clue where those missing pages disappeared to.

At the end of the day, however, none of this matters. Because my former self, along with all her mistakes, they burned along with that miserable old [house](https://new.reddit.com/r/thoughtindustry/comments/te0fum/welcome_i_hope_you_enjoy_your_stay/).
