\[[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1cz55up/the_mortheimer_house_part_1_through_the_window/)\] Two weeks. I had two weeks before Jason Mortheimer’s party. Two weeks before my parents, ignorant of both my fascination with other people’s lives and the state of the other guests in the Mortheimer house, went to whatever dreadful “party” this freak had in mind. School would be out in one week, and that would leave a window of uninterrupted time to plan, to figure something out.

I barely passed those finals. It’s impossible to focus when you have the rictus faces of the dead haunting your nightmares. Some nights, in my dreams, I would hear that raspy voice calling out to me, the sound which ill fit in the throats of the dead. 

Now I know you’re screaming “why the hell don’t you tell them?” What could I have even said? Would anyone have believed me? Short of exhuming Rollie Wood’s grave and proving the body had been stolen, why would anyone believe me? Even I wasn’t certain what I’d seen. All I knew was that the Mortheimer party would be disastrous.

I resolved to end the problem myself, and thus I put my skills to use again. I returned to the Mortheimer house, and if Jason had adjusted his security in any way, it clearly wasn’t enough.

I slipped past the corpse room; it was more populated now, even more exhumed bodies standing in semiformal attire, awaiting a purpose I couldn’t understand. But down I went, into the lightless depths of that house, deeper and deeper. 

My head smashed into something metal and I stumbled back, dropping my flashlight. As I picked it back up, I spotted the rusty copper pipe that I’d hit my head on. It dripped and rumbled with water, and with a start I realized I was looking at part of the city’s water main. Cables sheathed in iron and insulated ran alongside it, and I was grateful I had hit the water main and not one of the power lines. I sat there for a moment, dumbstruck. The construction teams had simply dug around key city infrastructure, something which even I knew was illegal. Looking back, I can’t imagine why its illegality shocked me, when I’d seen exhumed corpses in a previous room. Before long, I carried on, ducking my head beneath the beam of cables and pipes.

It was like being buried alive. The earth seemed to press in at those depths, and the sounds of movement and running water echoed in stereo. Try as I might to spot the source, there was only the black stone staircase and the featureless gray concrete as I descended. Yet down, down, down I went, and the pressure felt as though the whole building rested its weight upon my chest. I had to stop to catch my breath, gulping down stale air as I sat on those cold stone steps. If I’d continued to descend, I had no doubt I would find the center of the earth. 

Finally, after another few landings, I reached the bottom. The floor became warmer, and the air became moist and rancid. I covered my mouth with my hand as I searched for the source, and my foot sunk onto something soft. I expected the worst, but I couldn’t have predicted the sight before me.

It was pink, long, and creased with lines. A warm liquid trickled over it from a sopping moist carpet behind it, and to my disbelief I saw veins swimming just beneath the murky pink floor. Looking up, I saw the pink roll thinned around the middle of the room, and then thickened above me. It took a moment, but I recognized what I was looking at.

Lips. Giant, gaping lips. And the interior of a mouth. As if to confirm my suspicion, a gust of foul air billowed forth like a soft sigh, and droplets of what I now felt comfortable calling spittle spattered my jacket. I wanted to run, to turn my back on whatever primordial aberration I had trespassed into, but I didn’t dare. Tentatively I stepped over the lips and into the mouth-tunnel, gagging as my foot sunk ever so slightly into the warm meat. My shoe came away thick with mucus, and I trudged on, slipping and struggling to maintain my balance as I crossed the fleshy expanse. 

A noise from ahead made me stop. It wasn’t a sound I recognized. It sounded like someone typing really fast on a mechanical keyboard. But it could be, could it? No, that’d be too normal for this alien house. 

The room ahead of me was slightly yellow, and the walls shifted and clattered in a sea of activity, looking for all the world like a churning ocean of corn kernels. As I set my saliva-slick shoe on the shuddering floor, I realized that these could only be teeth. I laughed then, the sound drowned out by the sea of shivering enamel. I just couldn’t accept it. Teeth? Teeth on the walls, the ceiling, the floor? All rattling and clattering and shaking? I pictured one of those wind-up dentures and I laughed all the harder. It had to be a joke, right? I was so convinced by the corpses and the lip-room, and I hadn’t considered that this could all have been staged.

I reached down into the teeth and gripped a molar, expecting to feel a mechanism operating it. It was the size, shape, and texture of one of my own, but I dug my fingers in and yanked up, hoping to hear metal squeal in protest, or plastic snap. Something. With a vicious jerk, I pulled forth my prize and stared at it.

A long, curved, bloody root. Nerve endings still attached. Blood squirted from the exposed gum tissue and stained the teeth to its sides pink. I expected for the room to react in some way, the wiggling teeth to stop or to bear down on me, or to hear a distant sound as whatever creature whose mouth I trespassed in reacted to the pain. But nothing changed. Blood ran between the yellowing teeth and nothing else changed.

It was hard to walk on the bumpy, uneven, shifting floor. My laughter had died when the tooth had come up and now the sound of the chattering teeth was deafening. I had long since lost sight of the shore behind me as I inched across the shifting mass, terrified to lose my footing. It felt like hours before I saw the smooth stone of the floor that had preceded the lip room, and I all but dove for it, relieved to stand on solid ground once more. Yet as I studied it, I saw that it wasn’t a clear cut. Minute fractures radiated from the shore of the tooth-lake, and in pockmarks in the stone I could see the ground down stumps of enamel scraping against the stone. Even down there they wiggled. 

For an hour I sat on the shore of that lake, trying to make sense of what I saw. But it defied understanding. Perhaps if the teeth had been to-scale with the lips, I could wrap my head around it. But they were human-sized teeth. 

When I could stomach the contemplation of the teeth no longer, I turned and continued on into the moist cave. The walls deviated from stone into great root-like structures, covered on all sides by tiny cilia that fluttered in the cavernous breath. As they became more numerous, they bifurcated onto the roof and floor, leaving the walls bare of their structures. At the point where they all converged, there sat a creature.

It resembled a kidney bean, a meter tall and half as wide. Bony, translucent stubs of limbs stretched and scrabbled against an envelope of rubbery flesh. At the top of the bean-shape, veins and fluids converged to form a pale, swollen bump. A band of color, hazel-brown, encircled it like the hair of a monk, and the lump moved to align with me. I stared at the color-ringed lump and realized that what I saw was supposed to be an eye.

The creature made no sound, save the swollen sides of it heaving and contracting arrythmatically. It produced no air, but it resembled lungs. I have no doubt it could not truly see me, for the filmy skin-sack that covered its limbs also stretched over its proto-eye.

I reared up and kicked the thing in the top of its structure. Brownish juice spattered out from it, and it deflated somewhat. Again and again I kicked it, and screams drowned out the wet squelches as I pulverized the monster. I realize now it had no mouth; my own screams were the ones which echoed around the chamber. I kept stomping until I was panting and red-faced, and the creature was unrecognizable slurry on the ground. At that point, I collapsed, landing heavily in the ruined goopy remains of the creature, and the darkness of the tunnels I’d endured finally bled into my reality and I lost consciousness. 

When I awoke, I was in the Mortheimer house. It was as it had been before it had been called such. There a gambler had died years ago, leaving the place bereft. I stood and dust billowed around the room. The wind whistled through a shattered window. There was no downstairs floor, just a flat faded hardwood passage that led towards the master bedroom. There, beside the moth-eaten sheets, stood a picture in a frame. I knew it to be the owner of the house then, and I recognized it as Jason Mortheimer now. He looked more vigorous in this picture, smiling beside a woman whom I could only assume was his wife. Whatever Mortheimer had been, this thing had worn his face like a suit. I slipped out into the dusk of the neighborhood and headed for home. 

When I entered, I sat down at the dining room table. My folks were home, but they didn’t come out to see me. I ran my fingers through my hair and reclined. It must have been a dream.

I thought that, until my hand touched something hard and wet in my pocket.

A tooth. A molar, with trailing nerves, still wet with blood.

My parents weren’t home. And they never were again.
