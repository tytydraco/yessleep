My name is Adam, What I’m about to tell you has made me afraid of this…blue dog.

Kids may view her as a kind, loving, and understanding kid but…not after what I’m about to tell you.
I’m gonna try to be serious and composed as possible when I tell you my story.

I lived alone in my own house, and I usually like living alone. I’m not an outdoors kinda guy…i mostly just stay at home playing video games like legend of Zelda and Pokemon.

I also love horror movies and cartoons like looney tunes, Friday the 13th, the pokemon anime, underdog, Texas chainsaw massacre, and Tom and Jerry. I usually watch some old kids programs like Sesame Street to remember my childhood and how it was. Man those were the days…

Around this time I was at work at my closest McDonald’s…I know but, I have to make money somehow and it gave me a lot of money to pay my bills and taxes. I was still in awe of how much they gave me. Anyways I’m getting off topic but the McDonald’s is actually important. I was working one day and a buddy of mine Joffrey, told me about the “best kids show he’s ever seen”.

I smirked and I asked:

Adam: let me guess, Sesame Street? That show is-

Joffrey: hell no! It’s an Australian show! It’s called Bluey! One about a blue dog and her family. The family is INCREDIBLE. 
At first i didn’t know what he was talking about, but I start to remember thumbnails on YouTube about a blue dog in a cute and comfortable art style.

I then asked as I show a photo of the blue dog on my phone:

Adam: this one?

Joffrey: yea! That’s the one! Seen it already?

Adam: um, no I haven’t-

Then Joffrey held the side of my arms like a crazy person, asking for his first meal and he told me:

Joffrey: watch. It. It’s REALLY good. I promise you.

I look at him as I was weirded out. I then told him:

Adam: ok ok! (Nervous chuckle) can you let go of me now? 
He let go of me as he blushes from embarrassment.

Joffrey: sorry, it’s just so good. Like I wish I had this show in MY childhood.

We pause for a second as I asked: 

Adam: it’s THAT good?

He nodded as he smiles with a warm expression.

I was skeptical, as I never heard of a show THAT good. I knew of Joffrey’s love of kid shows but It’s almost like Joffrey is telling me bluey is like the second coming of Jesus Christ. I then went back to work and try to earn my pay.

That night I got half of what I was supposed to get. Probably because I accidentally spilled some fryer juice all over the floor…don’t ask I’m not telling you how that happened.

I then go home in my Porsche 911 1963. The car was a birthday present 4 years ago by my dad. The car belonged to him as I loved riding in it when I was a kid, the Porsche was kinda like the member of the family to me. 

I then go in my house as I unlocked the old door handle. It’s a miracle this handle hasn’t fallen off the door yet.

The house is what you would call a normal house. It’s roomy, not too big and has a nice kitchen next to the living room. I sleep in a room that’s connected the other side of the living room, has no door or wall, just like a border of sorts around the sides. 
I start cooking my food which is a Mac and cheese pepperoni pizza food bowl. Which literally is the best.

I ate it as I look up a show to watch as I was bored from working all day, I still had some energy in me to watch something as I eat my food bowl. I look to see what’s new on the services I bought.

What I saw wasn’t interesting in the slightest. I start thinking about what Joffrey said. I try to look up the show. I then said to myself:

Adam: what was that show called again? Bluer?
Blueberry? No! Bluey that was it. 

I saw the show on Disney Plus. Of course it is. I quickly see there are 3 seasons of this show which surprised me abit as usually when i watched Netflix i usually see shows that ends at 2 seasons…to see Disney plus give a show 3 seasons is new to me. Of course this IS an Australian show so maybe it wasn’t owned by Disney at the start or something. I look at the first episode which was titled “Magic Xylophone” I watched it and it was nice but I would call it the best.

But then I was started to watch it more as I grew to like it…I try to watch it all the best I could but I fell asleep…funny enough on the episode “sleepytime”.

I was tired as I went to work the next day as I drove there. I should’ve feel drowsy but I felt…alive. I was excited about bluey and can’t wait to watch more when I got back home.

I was working and was gonna talk to Joffrey when I got to work about Bluey. But to my surprise he was absent…not seen the whole day. Which kinda sucks meaning I have to do his shift. I know of Joffrey usually being sick sometimes as he has a very weak immune system. But usually he would call me to tell me he’s sick in the mornings and it sometimes wakes me up. So it kinda made me kinda paranoid he didn’t call me today. I shrugged it off as i thought he probably forgot or he’s so sick he couldn’t tell me. I wish i thought otherwise…

I go back home after my shift (including Joffrey’s), made some food, and try to finish bluey that night. “The sign” was the best episode hands down. After that I turned off the tv, cleaned up my mess, and  I immediately went asleep. 
I was then woken up by the sound of knocking. 

I immediately got up and was shaken. I was so tired I rubbed my barely open eyes and got up, I walked slowly to the door and checked though the peephole…it was the police.

I open the door immediately and see 2 police officers in front of me. One female and one male.

They start the conversation:

Female officer: excuse me sir, do you have a minute?

I then reply:

Adam: sure, what’s up ma’am?

Female officer: are you Adam Conners? 
Adam: yes, ma’am.

Female officer: do you know of the man Joffrey Mitchell? 
Adam: yes miss, he’s one of my best friends. Why? Did something happen?

Male officer: he’s…dead sir.

My heart sank, like if it was drowning in my body.

Adam: h…how? What happened? 

They see I start to lose it and was on the verge of crying.

Male officer: we’re trying to figure that out sir. When was the last time you were with the victim? 
I compose myself as i explain to them:

Adam: I was with him yesterday at work, after that he didn’t come in. I assumed he was sick or something but I never thought-

Female officer: that’s all we need. 
I then asked them:

Adam: did…did he die peacefully? 
The officers then gave me a face that wasn’t assuring, Like they seen a dead body mangled.

Male officer: it was something out of a horror movie.

(Then the female officer jabbed his side…she thought that was disrespectful)

Female officer: there was something else too, a package addressed to you.

I was confused as she gave me the package…a small box. Not like those big cardboard boxes for moving but one that was like…handmade, taped together and covered in paper-mâché

Adam: what is that???

Female officer: we don’t know, it has your name on it and we didn’t wanna invade your privacy. 
I was given the package as the officers were about to walk away.

Male Officer: if you hear anything strange or unusual just call us!

I wave to the officers as I then go back in the house…I cried my eyes out as I was tormented that night about Joffrey. I couldn’t believe he was gone. I didn’t get any sleep that night.

Next day I didn’t go to work as I called out to be absent…telling them I wasn’t feeling well. I hung up the phone as I was depressed about Joffrey’s fate.

I made some coffee and a bagel to cheer me up… didn’t do anything that much. 
I try to put on something else then bluey as I didn’t want to think about it right now as it’ll just make me think of Joffrey. 
I put on Netflix’s Castlevania as I really liked the artwork of the show and it was amazing. Probably wasn’t the best show to choose but that was all I could think about.

I try drinking my coffee and having my bagel to cheer up, but I couldn’t.

I saw the package that was given to me by the officers as i studied it…it has my name written on the back as it was in black marker. But the writing was wild and erratic…as if someone was in a hurry to put this out.

I open the package and see…a tape.

I thought it was strange that a TAPE was sent to me…there was a note attached to it…I read it:

“Adam,

I didn’t know who to send this to. If your given this tape by anyone else that means that I am dead. My curiosity got the best of me. I just wanted to see more episodes of bluey. I found this tape online…I shouldn’t have got it! Please destroy this tape. DON’T WATCH IT. It’ll bring her to you. Please in the name of all that is holy destroy this tape. I’m sorry we didn’t hang out more. You will always be my best friend. Even if I die. 
-Joffrey”

I was freaked out abit.

Her? Who’s her? And destroy the tape? Why? What the hell is on this tape that made him so afraid of it? 
I go to the tape and it said:

“Not Bluey”

The “Not” on the tape was small and was written in red while the “Bluey” was in black sharpie.

This is weird.

Why would he send me a tape involving bluey? Well, NOT bluey. He told me to destroy it which weirded me out more.

Why destroy a tape???

The note said he got it online as he wanted to watch more bluey episodes. I thought maybe he got some sick bootleg copy of bluey, or a heavily edited bluey episode. I was curious to see what’s on the tape.

I promised myself then:

Adam: maybe i can destroy it after i watch it. I’ll just do that.

So that’s what I decided to do. After I watch the tape I’ll destroy it.

I got an old VHS player and plug it in the tv, and pushed the VHS in the player. At that moment I realized, why the hell is bluey on VHS? Because the show can be on streaming services and websites. It’s a new show, So how the hell is bluey on a tape? I shake my head as I thought maybe someone was feeling nostalgic and wanted to put it on a VHS or couldn’t put it on DVD as the maker didn’t have any, and had to settle with a VHS tape.

I sit and watch this tape.

I was expecting some edited intro of bluey or whatever to roll my eyes.

But what I saw wasn’t that.

There was a small text that said “Bluey” in a black background

It was now an empty hallway in the dark, like as if the center was a black void. Water droplets can be heard in the background of this scene.

I was staring at it probably for a minute until it changed the scene. It was now the moon, a black sky sped up, with a whistling noise in the background…probably the wind being sped up. it was just clouds and the moon. No buildings. no additional light.

I was confused on what I’m seeing and was a bit creeped out but not too creeped out as I’ve seen a lot of horror movies and I was guessing this is some sort of indie film.

The scene changes to something horrific. I was in shock.

The scene then showed a tall furry creature eating a man alive by their head and torso. The Gnawing of bones and Flesh is heard as the creature ate the unfortunate man.

It almost reminded me of a painting I saw on an old field trip…”Saturn Devouring His Son” by Francisco Goya. Except this was no painting. It looked so real like I’m looking at it outside of a window and there was some differences. 
The creature was the same blue color as bluey was but dirty. It had the same fur pattern but, the art style wasn’t associated to the creature.

The creature had a lot of dirty fur, long arms and legs, had a wolf’s head, the chest was bulky but skinny, had old and long fingers, and long feet. The creature looked like it hadn’t eaten in months…giving it a decaying look, The most striking feature was its eyes. It had no pupils…the eyes were pure white. 
I was dumbfounded. I stopped there and paused the tape as I needed a minute to figure out what the hell I was watching. I thought the creature’s design was pretty cool as I was a horror movie fan but…I was still weirded out about the scene itself.

I then took a drink of water and proceeded the strange tape.

After a minute of seeing the creature devour the victim…disgustingly. The scene changes to a lamppost with blood and flesh on it…like it was stretched out to fit the post. The sky was so dark and red it felt like you were at low health in a video game.

I was kinda disgusted with this one. I almost puked but I was resilient as I try to look to see anything.

I saw a white text for a split second. I reverse the tape and slowed it abit and saw the text read:

“This is heaven”

Wasn’t nothing much but still made me creeped out. 
Then the next scene, was a giant beautiful flower bed with a dead body hanging like a scarecrow…dripping with blood and its organs hang from his exposed stomach. I heard faint screams in the background and it was kinda horrifying.

I then puked just abit…not a lot.

Who the fuck made this tape?! There must be some psycho that likes bluey and just made a dark parody of bluey. Well I think it’s disgusting. 

I was about to end the tape there and I WISH I did.

Then in the last scene. I see bluey in her art style but not the background as it was like…she was recording something…kinda like if she was in Roger rabbit, But something about this scene made me go full on red alert and confused. 
She was standing at my house.

At my door.

Then she said:

“Wanna play with me, Adam?”

I fell on my couch as I was horrified.

Not because of her saying my name… 

But her saying that on tape also sound like…

It was also at my door…in a different dark voice.

I look at the tape and she just grins evily in her art style and laughs on the tape.

But outside the tape, at my door, the sounded more evil and corrupt.

I realize this is probably why Joffrey wanted me to destroy the tape.

I need to destroy it.

I then immediately take out the tape, and got a hammer…but then the door was bursted open…I heard the creature’s voice which send a shiver down my spine.

“Not gonna let me in? Well I’ll just invite myself in” I heard it laugh in a sinister tone.

We look at each other for a minute.

I look at the unholy abomination in front of me. It was the creature from the tape…the one eating the dead body.

The creature grabs me…it was tightening its grip. I begin to scream in pain and grab the nearest kitchen utensil I can find. I grabbed a fork and stab its hand 4 times…It roars in pain as I grab the tape. 
I was still confused why joffrey wanted me to destroy the tape. But I try my best to appease my friends request.

“GIVE ME THAT!”

I didn’t know why IT wanted it but it must be important. All the more reason to destroy it.

I run to the bathroom which is the safest room in the house as it was the only one with the door in the house.

It grabs my leg as it tries to slam me on the other side of the house. I thought it was the end for me as this creature can probably kill me by just breaking my spine no problem. But then I had a quick idea. I then took off my pants I had on, slipped out of its grip, and ran like hell to the bathroom!

I heard the creature shriek in anger as it comes after me. 
It scratches me in the back as I fell in the bathroom.

I then got up immediately, close the door and lock all the locks on the door as it had 3 old locks.
It tries to take the door down as it was almost in.

I was so afraid and shaking I get the hammer shaking it violently from fear and destroy the tape as best I could. I hit it and heard a shriek of pain. 
I stop as I saw through the hole the creature had white glowing cracks around its body. At that moment I had a theory. I hit the tape again and it got more cracks. I realized the creature is tied to the tape…then one last time I hit the tape with the hammer and the tape shatters everywhere…and a flash of white light emitted from my busted up door and…the creature was gone. 
I said something stupid as I felt proud at the moment:

Adam: This episode is called: YOU GETTING FUCKED.

I then blacked out that night.

The police came that night to see I was alright. I told them i defended myself from a bear as there was bears here in Colorado.

The police were skeptical but they left me be as they had other duties. 
The next day I go to work and try to get that night out of my mind. That night made me afraid of that blue dog. and I’ll never forget it.
Now this is where my story should end…but it’s not over.

I try to figure out one thing that day. 
Where did joffrey get that tape?

I go to his house as I needed to figure it out from there…as he’s the one that got the tape from a website. Meaning there can be some info on his computer. 

His house was all police taped up and the inside…it stinks of rot and blood. The male officer was right. It was something out of a horror movie. That didn’t matter…I go to his room and try to find something on his computer that can help me figure this out…I couldn’t get that question out of my head. I needed to know.

I go on his computer and put down the password.

It was “Doomguydoom” 

I knew because usually I would come over his house sometimes, I wanted to play with him and he lets me use his computer as he uses his personal laptop.

I look to see his internet history and saw a lot of entries saying “new Bluey episodes”, “lost Bluey episodes” and “rare bluey episodes”. I then saw something that was recent. 

“Bluey on Tape”

I go to the page.

And I saw something that made me gasp in fear.

I saw a page…full of tapes. Not just tapes.

But ones that said “Bluey”.
