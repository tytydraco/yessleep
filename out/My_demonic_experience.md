I have decided to share my demonic experience. I am not a writer what so ever…. So bear with me. I’ve never shared this story, let alone written it down so let me do my best. 

I lived in a very broken home. My mom was married to a man that was a very violent alcoholic. He had two sons that he loved, but me as the step daughter I got the brunt of his anger and drunken rages. I believe when a certain darkness happens in a home, it brings in more darkness energy. When I was little I had a few experiences that solidified my belief in demons. It all started with a dream. A dream I do not think I will ever get out of my head. A dream I had when I was 9. 

My dream : 
I was in my bedroom when a knock came to the door, when I opened the door my home outside was different. It was a big white room with a little family table in the corner. No windows, no doors, just a big open space. At the table was my family eating, but just staring at their plates in silence not moving. In front of my door was a hallway to the left of the big white open space. A dark hallway. At the end of the hallway stood a creature. 
The creature was a dull grey color. Its torso was elongated, legs and arms bent like a cricket but were large and skinny. And its head was a long shape with a very long mouth and jaw. Teeth were jagged and long, almost broken looking. Eyes were dark as night. And its face was wrinkled, but not like an aging old man. Like a decomposing body. 
It ran after me and pulled my foot out from under me. It dragged me to the center of the big white room and started ripping off my toenails with its teeth, in front of my family. Still, they sat starting at their plates almost in a comatose state. I as screaming for help but their faces unwavering. Symbolical? Maybe.. as my mother didn’t save me from the abuse I suffered at the hands of her husband. But we’ll just skip past that… back to the dream. 
When I woke up I felt like I couldn’t get out of bed. Something was pushing me against the mattress and I felt stuck. I laid their for a few minutes until I was able to lift my body and go to my moms room. I never told her what happened in my dream. 

Months later. I was laying in bed and I was playing on my tamagotchi. I had a shelf above my head, over my bed with trinkets and things. All the sudden every item on my shelf was thrown across the room. The shelf was still level and attached, but all items were thrown. I was scared but decided to shrug it off at the time. 

Months later I was again, laying in bed. Laying on my back (I think I was in trouble at the time) while my step father was in another drunken rage. I felt something was looking at me. Just got that eerie feeling I wasn’t alone. I looked down at my feet and standing at the base of my bed… was the creature. The same one from my dream. It stood low so I couldn’t see its body. But I saw its face and hands reaching up above the bed just standing there. I screamed and ran out, my mom asked what happened but I couldn’t tell her. Just told her I had a nightmare which was an often occurrence for me. 

Let’s fast forward a couple years. I was now 11 or 12. I hadn’t seen its face in a while , I thought I had just been dreaming the last couple times I did. That is until I went to sleep that night. No bad dreams, no dreams to remember at all. But when I awoke, I again saw the creature (demon if you will) standing at the base of my bed. I was terrified. It came back. 
My step dad was on a buisness trip so I decided to finally tell my mom. I went to her bedroom and told her everything. The dream, the trinkets thrown from the shelf, and the thing standing at my bed. My mom gave me a long face and was quiet for a while. Eventually she said she has seen something in her room too. Keep in mind, I still had not told her what it looked like. I didn’t want to, I wanted to forget it. I thought if I sat and explained every detail, I would not get it out of my head. 
She told me she had seen something in her room a couple times, I asked her what it looked like…… and said it was a long face… black eyes, and large mouth. Then we started comparing. The creature I saw, was identical to what she was seeing. 
I knew I couldn’t have been crazy. We’re both seeing it. For years…. It was attached to this house. Or that man. 

A year later she finally got out of that marriage, we moved. And I never saw it again. But it will always stick with me. I will never get that long grey face and black eyes out of my head.
