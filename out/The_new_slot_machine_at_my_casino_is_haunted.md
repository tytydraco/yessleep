Part 1 


So I hate to type this because it makes it feel so much more real, but I need to get this out before I do what I'm about to do. I work in a casino in the middle of Colorado. I'm a cashier, so I get to look at the slot machines all day, 5 days a week. Pretty consistently, there is a switchout of machines; the ones that don't make as much money get swapped out for new, more popular machines. 

Last month, near the bathrooms, they swapped out a single machine in the center of a bank. That almost never happens; it's usually in groups of 2-6, but I didn't really think much of it; maybe it was busted. The new machine was some odd knight in heavy steal armor that had a few different idol animations and a jackpot set at $5,000 once turned on. 

Well, ever since the machine has been turned on, that fucking knight refuses to break eye contact with me whenever I walk by. At first I thought it was a coincidence while I was walking by, but no. Every single time, no matter what random movements I make, he is staring directly at me, blank expression, not a single bit of emotion, just staring at me. I even tried to peek around a corner to look at him while someone was playing it, but the second my eyes found him, he was already looking at me.

I don't know why he only looks at me or why nobody else seems to notice his odd behaviour. I mentioned it to one of my coworkers, but we talk about horror stories all the time, and she thought I was just making up a story to try to scare her. I realised after talking to her that if I mentioned it to anyone else, and they didn't see him acting weird, they would think I was crazy. So now I'm stuck; I don't really know what to do. 

I can't ignore him. Walking past him and trying not to look fills my body with such an anxious and gross feeling that I don't know how to fully describe. Staring at him is so much worse; he seems to grow more expressive as I stare longer. His mouth slowly frowns, his eyes seem to fall deeper into his skull, and his eyebrows slowly angle themselves in such a scolding way. I haven't been able to see how bad it gets because of the grip on my heart that staring at him makes me feel, forcing me to look away. 

It has gotten so bad that I have been pissing behind the casino in the one blind spot that I can think of. The only problem is the construction workers at the building behind the casino are giving me weird looks, and I can't really pop a squat in public without risk of legal action being held against me. I want to understand what he wants. Why me? Why, out of the thousands of people that walk by him every week, has he chosen me to torment? 

The only thing that I can possibly think of doing is quitting my job just so I can play this stupid game. Maybe I need to press the bet button to see if that's what he has been staring at me for, to get my attention. But why? Why does that matter? What is he trying to do? I don't care about losing my money; I'm more scared of what he will do to me if I give in. I don't know what kind of "powers" he has, but this thing obviously isn't a normal machine. 

I think I have to... I think I'm going to quit my job. This will be the dumbest decision of my life. I'll let you know if anything happens. Please, if you have any advice, let me know.. I'm lost. And don't say "quit your job and don't look back" he has gotten into my dreams. 

Every single night.
