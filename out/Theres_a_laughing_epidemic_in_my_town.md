It all began with Rodney tittering at the back of the pharmacy.

The grey-haired man’s titter grew to a giggle, which drew my gaze, but I immediately regretted turning around. Rodney’s lips, oozing a trickle of drool, had only a centimetre-tall gap between them; his mouth was a letterbox spitting out a skinny parcel of sound. It was, without a doubt, the most horrendous smile I had ever seen—gummy, and not at all happy.

Brenda and Tommy sat on either side of the chuckling pensioner. The two sandwiching customers had shuffled their rears to the outer edges of their seats in a bid to escape from the disconcerting laugher, who was twitching excitably. Rodney had always been the town curmudgeon, but that wasn’t what made him so unsettling today. I’d seen the grumpy man laugh before—only once or twice, but it *had* happened. This was different.

Something was wrong.

All I knew was that I felt relieved to be queuing at the cash register, far from the strange giggler. Mrs Nealand, the pharmacist, was so distracted by Rodney’s odd behaviour that she almost let me walk away without paying.

“How much?” I asked nasally, preferring to focus on the medicine in my hand rather than the disquieting man behind me.

Mrs Nealand snapped her eyes back to mine, and she seemed equally glad for the distraction. “Sorry, Maria. That’ll be seven pounds ninety-nine.”

Rodney released a guffaw, but I ignored him and focused on unsteadily swiping my debit card across the scanner.

“What’s so funny, Rodney?” Brenda asked timidly.

The old man didn’t respond. He just kept laughing.

I watched and waited; then came an acceptance message on the screen.

“Thanks, Maria,” Mrs Nealand said, passing a receipt to me. “Hope that cold goes away soon.”

All bunged up, I sniffled and nodded gratefully. Then I beelined towards the front door, mistakenly making eye contact with Rodney—the man whose laughter was loudening by the second, though his lips remained just as marginally open. As I looked at those three waiting customers on the chairs by the door, I noticed that Tommy’s frown had faded; in fact, he had started to smile too. Only Brenda seemed to share my discomfort.

And as I was partway out of the door, bell still chiming above my head, there sounded a second chuckle from that row of seats.

I’d barely made it halfway up the road, thirty seconds later, when another chime sounded.

With a gulp, I twisted to see three people emerging from the pharmacy: Rodney, Brenda, and Tommy. Now, all *three* were laughing. More horrifyingly than that, all three were laughing in the same way and wearing that awful, awful smile—lips barely parted and revealing only upper gums.

“What the fuck…?” I muttered to myself, wondering whether I’d missed a humorous occurrence in the pharmacy.

But I hadn’t. I knew I hadn’t. There came no chuckle from my own throat—only burgeoning fear. Something terrible was approaching.

The trio of giggling friends started to walk up the pavement towards me, and my dread only worsened. Clutching the cold medicine tightly in one hand, and clutching thin air in the other, I started to feel immense unease. I knew, as those teary-eyed and haunting-smiled husks took quick paces towards me, that I had to get as far away from them as possible.

With my own heartbeat rolling off my tongue, I dashed into the road, and there came the deafening noises of a car horn, then scorching rubber. Arms shaking reflexively over my face, I peeked through my quaking limbs to see a car only a couple of feet in front of me.

“I’m so sorry!” I blubbered as the driver, who had narrowly avoided colliding with me, angrily climbed out of his still-running vehicle.

“*I nearly killed you!*” he yelled furiously. “Watch where you’re…”

The flustered man, leaning against the open door of his car, trailed off as the group of now-cackling pharmacy customers walked into the road, heading towards us.

“What’s wrong with you?” the driver asked, directing his fury towards them. “There’s nothing funny about—”

Then Brenda, who only two minutes earlier had been reeling in terror from a chuckling Rodney, clamped a hand firmly over the driver’s lips. She shoved him against the side of his still-running car, then continued to laugh with eyes tearful and a mouth barely open; all the while, the frightened driver, wide-eyed and powerless, struggled to speak. His voice was muffled by Brenda’s obstructive fingers.

Then came front doors opening up and down the street as residents caught wind of the commotion. I watched in confusion, pleading with my eyes for somebody to step forwards and help. However, as townsfolk converged on the scene, I started to feel the strong urge to tell them to turn around.

“*What are you doing?”* screamed the driver audibly through Brenda’s hand.

I watched in horror as Brenda, far too slight to overpower such a tall man, managed to clamp down impossibly firmly on his lips. As she did, the little woman snorted with laughter, transmitting a powerful contagion into the air. I covered my own lips with one hand and eyed members of the crowd, but it was too late.

I saw it spread across faces. One by one, the onlookers’ expressions of fear and anger softened, then hardened into something more horrifying: Rodney’s smirking expression. It was a look which conveyed not happiness, but a sadistic, parasitic hysteria. And I wanted so desperately to tell Brenda to let the driver go, but I quickly began to feel outnumbered as giggles, and chuckles, and downright *brays* of laughter started to fill the street.

There was no mirth. No humanity.

Not even when Brenda tore.

I screamed behind my clasped lips as the woman, with inhuman strength, plucked a chunk of the man’s flesh and lips away from his face. There came a piercing shriek of agony and a fountain of red, as if she’d turned on a faucet of blood. Then the driver stumbled on weak legs towards the open door of his vehicle, but he didn’t get far. Tommy and Rodney didn’t *let* him get far.

The two men pulled the driver out of the door, and he fell flat onto the road; then the laughing attackers dragged the stranger by his legs into the centre of the crowd.

I tried to back onto the pavement but met a wall of people behind me—gigglers whose wet eyes saw not me, but the spectacle ahead. It was a sight that they found so hauntingly amusing. Worst of all, their laughter only built as Rodney, Patient Zero, began to tear claw-like nails into the driver’s face, scooping away clumps of flesh for a giddy audience.

I finally removed my covering hand and opened my lips to speak, but I was stopped. Stopped, and petrified, by the sudden synchronised silence of the crowd—by the synchronised swivelling of heads towards me.

Every set of eyes fell upon me. Every wide, drooling smile. The laughter had stopped, but those gummy maws remained, releasing only heavy pants. The infected were baiting me. Pleading for me to yell at them in much the same way as the driver.

I understood.

Expressing sincerity—expressing anything other than delirious amusement—would have fated me to the same end as that stranger being mutilated in the road; so I closed my lips, twisted sharply on the spot, and broke through two members of the crowd.

I expected to be manhandled and thrust back into the fray, but I wasn’t. I somehow succeeded in fleeing up the road, away from the maniacal chortles which had resumed; then continued the driver’s screeches of agony and the scratching sounds of his flesh coming away under Rodney’s nails.

That was five hours ago.

I’ve been hiding in my one-person flat, curtains shut and lights out. Out in the streets, hearty cackles of delirium rule. There are still some cries of fury, fear, and mere bewilderment at what is happening—the sound of poor souls trying to escape from those spreading the virus.

Many of the screams die as victims, like the driver, meet twisted ends. However, I find it most haunting when a scream simply changes into something else.
