[Part Six](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/T7neCL667g)

It’s been nearly a week since my first day on the job, and somehow I’m still sore in places I didn’t know existed. The slash across my shoulder hasn’t healed. Not really. There’s a crawling pull under the skin, like the wound remembers the thing that made it.

Sometimes when the building settles, the ache answers back.

A pull. A flinch. A quiet, private shiver that feels like the injury is listening for something.

I try not to think about it. I mostly fail.

My arm hangs closer to my side than it should. Instinct, not choice. But even with the ache chewing at me, I keep smiling. I stepped in when it mattered. The hit wasn’t for nothing.

That has to count, right?

We still have to use regular walkie-talkies.

If I remember right, he told me:

> “You shouldn’t pour too much blood into one glass. I’m sure you can stretch what you’ve got.”



He talks like someone who’s watched a lot of people bleed out and took the wrong lesson from it.

Earlier today I tried to reassure the team.

“I’m proud of all of you,” I told them. “Sorry, I’ve been stuck in here instead of helping.”

My good hand curled tight. The moment replayed over and over — the shove, the impact, the concrete tilting up toward me — and each time I saw the same thing:

I slowed them down.

What kind of captain needs saving?


---

Ace reached me first, the floor tightening beneath his weight before he even came into view. His hand landed on my shoulder. Warm. Heavy. More kindness than I deserved.

“Don’t beat yourself up, captain!” he said, all booming confidence. “You did what you had to!”

His grin flashed sharply.

Gillette drifted over, colors trembling through him like anxious thoughts trying not to be heard. He brushed my arm with cold fingers.

“Relax, dude,” he said. “You’ve kept us from blowing up stuff so many times.”

Viper moved like a shadow permitted to shape itself. Her tail curved behind her, slow and controlled.

“You exceeded expectations,” she said. “At the very least, you prevented Gillette from destroying a second building.”

“The building moved,” Gillette muttered.

Ace snorted. Viper didn’t bother responding.

I laughed — I don’t know why — but the motion burned my shoulder like hot metal being pressed into my skin.

“I’m glad I get to work with all of you,” I told them. “You’re weird… but you’re good people.”

Something settled inside me then. Not comfort. More like resignation. And it scared me far more than the pain.

That’s when the alarm started.


---

The sound didn’t ring — it tore through the air. A shriek of metal and electricity snapping together.

A camera feed flicked on.

Something enormous filled the hallway frame.
Breathing in long, dragging pulls.
Fur matted into ropes.
Horns scraping the ceiling tiles like it wasn’t built for this world.

A minotaur.
Not Ace.
Not anything that should belong in a place built by human hands.

“We need to stay sharp,” I said. “Do NOT let it hit you.”

Ace thumped his chest.
Gillette’s colors tightened to a hard, brittle glow.
Viper’s tail rose like a drawn blade.

They took off before I could stop them.


---

The fight on the monitors wasn’t a fight — it was a violent blur.
Shadows slammed past the camera.
Light burst, white and chemical, sharp enough to sting my eyes even through a screen.
The sound… God.
Wet impacts.
Splintering drywall.
A roar deep enough to bend the audio into static.

Something slammed the camera so hard the feed jumped sideways, half-dead and hissing.

Then a body hit the ground and didn’t move.

For a moment, I couldn’t breathe.

I ran. Instinct, again. There’s a cramped supply corridor behind the training hall — barely wide enough for Ace’s shoulders — but I took it anyway, my pulse drumming in my injured arm like a fist knocking from the inside.

When I reached the open floor:

The creature was down.

But the room looked wrong.
Dust hung suspended midair, as if the building wasn’t sure the violence had stopped.
Ace was kneeling beside Viper, shaking so hard his fingers left tremors in the floor.
Gillette’s colors dimmed into a sick, deathbed gray.

And Viper—

Viper lay curled on her side.
Her tail — the thing she takes such pride in, the thing she moves with more precision than most people move their hands — hung limp.

Completely limp.

She tried to lift the lower coils. They twitched once, then collapsed, dragging like dead weight.

Her breath hitched. She covered her mouth like she didn’t want any of us to hear it.

“We need help,” Ace said. His voice didn’t boom this time. It barely held together.


---

I grabbed the walkie with my good hand.

“Doc. Now. Please.”

Static.
Then a soft crackle, like leaves brushed by a slow wind.

Footsteps approached — measured, purposeful — like someone walking toward a thing they already knew was broken.

The doctor stepped into the room, in robes the color of deep forest shadows. I don’t know how he always finds us. Maybe he hears things the rest of us can’t — the pressure change of pain, the way damage vibrates through halls.

He knelt beside Viper. His fingers hovered over the break in her movement. Faint green light pulsed under his hands — weak and reluctant, like it hated being pulled into the world.

Viper shuddered hard.

Ace bowed his head.
Gillette turned away.
I held her hand because I had nothing else to offer.

After a long, fragile moment, the doctor said:

“She will live.”

My knees almost buckled.

Then:

“But her strength has been taken. She will not move her tail the same again.”

The silence that followed felt worse than the alarm.

Viper opened her eyes. And in them I saw something I’ve never seen in her — not fear… something colder:

Recognition.

“Can you… fix what you can?” she whispered.

“I will,” the doctor said. “But the rest you must learn.”

He wrapped her tail in living vines — pale, tense things that twitched like they resented being disturbed. Her breathing smoothed out, but the movement didn’t return.

Ace wiped his face roughly, ashamed to be seen.
Gillette’s glow dimmed so small I barely saw it.
Viper tried to sit up — and failed. The sound she made was small, strangled, and immediately swallowed.

“This wasn’t one mistake,” she said. “It was all of us.”

She was right.
God help me, she was right.

The doctor stood. Leaves rustled against each other, a sound like disappointment.

“Care for her,” he said quietly.

Then he left — and the silence he carried with him filled the whole room.

Viper took a slow breath and tried once more to move her tail.
A twitch.
A flicker.

Then stillness.

Our strongest member was alive.
Forever changed.

And the worst part?

The guilt in that room moved heavily than the monster’s body.
And none of us knew what that meant for next time.

Or if any of us would survive it.
