It feels like a lot has happened since [this started](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1o1hfpi/i_am_a_banisher_and_the_snails_followed_me_home_i/), and I've been thinking a lot since [yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1o42adf/i_am_no_longer_a_banisher_i_decided_to_become_a/), y'know, while I’ve been doing my counting and dumping and counting and counting. Mostly about old cases.

I had a commission once in a bigger city in Denmark. I never finished the report, and to this day I don’t know how I would go about it.

The reporter was a lady in her late seventies. She lived on the third floor of a pretty large apartment complex, in what I can only describe as a… well, really shifty area. 

It was quiet when I arrived, but not devoid of people. On the contrary, there were a lot of people. Everywhere, wherever you looked. Collection of older, eh, *gentlemen* around a park bench, dark and dank coats that stunk of cigar smoke and piss, beer cans in hand. Young people with *giant* pants on the stairs, smoking cigarettes or vaping and whispering angrily amongst each other. The entire neighbourhood felt devoid of colour and life, apart from a small pink child-sized bicycle resting against a wall. In comparison to everything surrounding it, including the wall, it was pretty much pristine. The colour still stark, the coat shiny. The tassels attached to the handlebars looked combed, intermixed with strings of glitter. Someone had meticulously attached a handful of plastic stars to the spokes of both wheels. They shivered softly in the wind.

Inside the building, everything shifted from grey to yellow-brown. Years of nicotine and exhaust emissions that had found their way in through the half-rotten door, left open in any weather I guess, affected both the visuals around me as well as the dankness of the space. 

There was no elevator. Just a creaky spiral staircase that felt a little too soft when you stepped on it. 

The door to her apartment sat on the end of a thin corridor, nestled between abandoned apartments. A small laminated note above the mail slot bore a name that confirmed it was the right one. 

The woman opened the door before I could knock, with a friendly smile on her face. Her entire being just radiated that *warmth* that some grandmas have. I decided I liked her immediately.

She was skinny and tall, with a *giant* handmade cardigan over her shoulders, and her white, translucent hair tied back into a knot at the back of her head.

“Finally,” she said, voice smooth as butter. “You’re here! Can I get you a spot of tea? Just wait till you hear it! I am so glad you’ve arrived! How was your journey? Was it good? Do you understand me okay?”

My hand was still hovering mid-air. I let it down, awkwardly. It wasn’t impossible to understand her, but it was hard. Danish and Swedish are pretty similar, but I am from the north. The diphthongs and the, well, *speed* at which she spoke made half of it just sound like gurgles to me. I smiled politely, though, reflectively put my hands in what I’d like to think was a friendly yet  defensive manoeuvre.

“Uh, yeah. Can I—”

This lady was stronger than she looked. She pulled me by my jacket inside, still chattering excitedly as she led me to the couch. I let her. What could be the harm? With her back turned, she was even harder to understand. Maybe she was mumbling a little, too. I am not sure all the words that came out of her were necessarily for me. It felt more like it was something she had wanted to release for a long time, and finally there was someone there to listen.   

The apartment itself was small and orderly. She had a *lot* of, just, little clutter. Most of it ducks and cats and ladies in hats, both in paintings and little figurines neatly placed on every conceivable surface atop little white doilies. 

She pushed me gently into the red satin couch, then sat facing me in a little armchair. The fabric was old and a little stained, but not dirty. Just used. 

She leaned forward, knees together, hands folded. Picked up one of the steaming tea cups that had already been placed on the table between us. I don’t know how she timed any of it.

“It’s *that woman,*” she spat. “Downstairs! Yes! She *copies* me!”

I thought I’d misheard, computed for a few seconds. I felt my eyebrows rise involuntarily. 

“Sorry, she… eh, *copies* you?” 

“Yes! Everything! *Everything!* If I make tea, she makes tea. I can hear her darn kettle! If I clean, *she cleans*. Always right after me. You can *hear* it! If I go to the bathroom, she—”

“Alright, alright.” I frowned, gave my head a little shake. Disappointment was creeping in, and a feeling I couldn’t quite put my finger on. “She… Okay. Did you… try to talk to her about it?”

She leaned forward, eyes wide, with her head tilted a little. As if she was listening. 

“No. I can’t. I had surgery on my hip, you see. Yes. The hip. So, I can’t go downstairs. But if I move a chair, *she* moves a chair. I can hear it scrape! Yes. And I can tell she *does it better* than me.”

I pulled out my notebook from my pocket, mostly to be polite. I felt at a loss, a little bit. 

“So, how long has this been, eh, going on… for?”

While she had been talking, I had been trying to attune. I felt nothing out of the ordinary at all. The apartment smelled like, well, old lady apartment, you know? Not a bad smell, but it’s very distinct. A little like dust, maybe. Rubber. Dry wood. I don’t know. The temperature was warm and pleasant, the air just the right amount of humid. 

She leaned back and huffed. “Months! Months and *months and months*! But it’s getting worse. Yes, worse and worse. I can’t use the mirror, anymore.” She gestured towards a tall object covered with a white sheet. “It’s not *my* kitchen. No. No it’s not. It’s *her* kitchen.” 

My eyes followed her gesture, inspected the shape. Looked like a mirror, indeed. A curved frame poked around the edge of the sheet, inviting me to take a look.

“Mind if I inspect it?” I offered, softly. 

She nodded, leaned back. Looked more relaxed.

“Yes. Fantastic. I think you’re just what I need, to sort this out. To help me, finally.”

A lot of jobs are not… well, jobs? Not in the classic sense. A lot of the time, it’s nothing. There are no tethers or anchors or supernatural shit, just people that are scared. To them it’s real, I guess. Part of the job is solving that, too. Not like it’s in the official job description, but it feels better to do that. To help, if you can. 

I wasn’t feeling this job at all. It all just felt a little, well, sad. She seemed so nice, too. Just an old lonely lady, stuck in an apartment she couldn’t leave. 

I walked over to the suspicious rectangle, pulled the sheet off. A small cloud of dust stirred up, catching the yellow light from the ceiling. It was… an ordinary mirror. Bit of tarnish around the frame, the glass clean but scratched from years of use. Along its bottom, someone had at some point drawn a couple of small hearts in red crayon, uneven and lumpy. Children or grandchildren, maybe.

Looking at it, it showed me exactly what it should. Nothing spooky or out of the ordinary, just myself. I looked like shit, but I always do. Not like that’s the mirror’s fault. I could see her legs peeking out in the corner of the reflection, knees crossed, hands in her lap. I turned around, slowly.

“Seems fine,” I said, half-smiling. “I think—”

“*No.*” Her face tightened, darkened. “*No*, it doesn’t. You just can’t see it because she’s *pretending*. She *knows* you are here!”

Her tone was harsher than before, so I threw my hands up. Kept the smile on, just a soft shadow. “Alright. Alright. Here’s what I’ll do. Okay? I will go downstairs, and I will do a sweep. I will talk to her, if possible, and then I will come back. Does that sound okay?”

She nodded again, visibly relaxed.

“Yes. Please, dearie. Please do. Tell her to *stop*.”

I contemplated just, taking a walk. Not bothering a neighbour for possible just existing in their own home. I think it’s generally not a good idea to involve people in stuff, either. You could inadvertently create a belief anchor that way, even if it’s unlikely. Especially if this was older people. Don’t think they tend to be the *creators* of urban legends, most of the time.

I ended up following through, though. The lady reminded me of my mum, a little, and I have some layers of unresolved guilt surrounding that. The pictures in the lady’s hallway of what I think was family members definitely didn’t help. 

So, I went down a flight. I walked down the corridor to the left. I wasn’t really paying attention to anything, at this point. There was a sense of *responsibility* that was further conflicting me. 

I found the correct door immediately due to two reasons.

The first? The door was fucking *pristine*. The wood was dark and looked freshly oiled, its frame and board the only thing in any vicinity that wasn’t covered in a layer of yellow grime or a thin layer of brownish dust.

As for the second, it was not closed. Not entirely open, either: the latch was resting on the frame, shiny and grey. I tapped on the slab, softly.

“Hello?” I called. “Anyone home? Sorry to disturb you, but I think the lady—”

I softly nudged the door open, and stopped in my tracks. *What the actual f—*

The interior was unlit, but *pristine*. There wasn’t a single fragment of dust circling in the light that made its way through the main window, at the back. It also carried that smell of (unmistakably old) lady, but more pleasant. Small whiff of fancy perfume from an even fancier atomiser, wood polish, floor cleaner. Echo of freshly baked buns and Sunday roast. The smell of *love* and *care.* 

It looked identical to the apartment upstairs. And no, not in a “it’s the same floor plan!” Type way because *of course* it was the same floor plan. No.

The empty frames to my left looked exactly the same as the one’s that the lady upstairs had put her family inside. The red satin couch, the soft-patterned arm chair with tassels and wooden feet. The kettle next to the shiny stove. The two empty teacups on the table, set down carefully on cork protectors. The little duck on a side table, facing a friendly black and white cat that was playing with a ball of yarn. Both on the *same* fucking doilies, the porcelain shiny and unscratched. Turned *just so* to ensure it looked organic.

The air on my arms stood on end, and I grasped for my charm. I took another step, over the threshold. My footsteps sounded louder than I expected, the air inside warmer than it should be.

“Hello?” I tried again, softer against my will. Nothing.

I took a few careful steps toward the kitchen. My reflection followed in the hallway mirror, just a slow movement in my periphery. The only movement.

The kettle gleamed, polished to perfection. I reached my hand out and stroked it, leaving a small mark on its side. My face looked bulbous and wrong in the reflection. It was warm. Not hot, not like it had just been used to make tea, but *warm*. 

Every instinct in me wanted to leave. I still couldn’t *feel* anything off except for the entire situation being creepy, though, so I continued. Unsure. If there *was* a neighbour, then it at least needed to be ruled out. People can do some real odd things.

The bed was also perfectly made, two pillows in crocheted pillowcases, karate-chopped at the tops to make them bend ever so slightly. One side of the bed was a little creased, a cardigan —*the* cardigan*—* neatly laid out on top.

“Alright,” I muttered, mostly to break the silence. “Copycat interior design demon or whatever. Cool. Coolcoolcool.”

On my way out, I noticed a small streak on the mirror in the hallway. Like a handprint someone had quickly tried to wipe off.  I leaned in closer. My reflection didn’t. I held my breath, counted. Waited for it to catch up. It didn’t.

I left the apartment, mostly feeling confused. I leaned against the stained wall outside for a moment, quickly jotted down a note: *No resident found. Unit below seems uninhabited. Reflection delay?* 

I made it back upstairs, my legs heavier than before. My mind was racing with possibilities, trying to think of what I could do. I had some stuff with me, of course, but I felt that this probably needed some research. It didn’t seem to be… malicious. Just off. Nothing that I had any knowledge about, at least, and it didn’t seem like I needed to be in a hurry. Nothing was *hurting* the lady, after all. Not really scaring her either, just pissing her off. 

I knocked on the door. No answer.

It wasn’t locked, though. It had only been maybe ten minutes or something, so I figured I’d just go inside and… well. Tell her… something. That we’d look into it. Maybe even lie, for now, if that was to keep her calm and not further feed… whatever that was, inside the apartment below. 

That’s when the smell hit me.

I couldn’t place it, not at first. Then my brain clicked. *Rot*. Thick and heavy.

I froze in the doorway, hand still on the handle. The curtains were still open in the back, the afternoon light trickling in and colouring everything a warm shade of orange. The apartment looked exactly the same as before, teacups still neatly placed on the table. No steam was rising from them. The armchair was slightly angled towards the uncovered mirror, though. Had it always been?

“Ma’am?” I tried, but I knew no response would come. My throat felt tight. 

I walked inside, slow and deliberate. Careful. The wooden boards creaked under my feet. Had it been so *dusty* in here before?

She was on the bed, the cardigan pulled around her shoulders to try and stay warm. Her eyes were open, and her mouth slightly ajar. She looked doll-like, skin as if it was made of wax. Yellow and blue yet pale. The white of the bed was stained in an uncomfortable rainbow below her.

I stood there for a bit, just watching. What do you even do?

The kettle from downstairs came to mind. Warm, not hot. 

I backed out of the room, phone already at the ready.

Gave the report, the address, said what I thought I had to. My handler asked if I wanted to stay until dispatch arrived, but I said no. 

As I stepped into the hallway, just for a split second, I could swear I could see her reflection in the mirror. Standing in the kitchen, making tea or whatever. Just in my periphery. When my gaze turned, she was gone. For some reason it felt as if she was happy though.

I didn’t look at the family portraits on the way out. Didn’t want to. 

And, yes. I checked the apartment below on my way down. The door was locked, now, and covered in the same grime as everything else in that building. 

They did ask me for clarification, weeks afterward. Some kind of addendum to the report. I never finished it, so I assume they just called it. Nothing weird going on at all, not for our division. Just an old lady, alone in her apartment.

I don’t know why I thought about her, specifically. The case and the smell and the visuals have been haunting me, today. While I’ve been finishing my mission. I think I am approaching some very uncomfortable thoughts, and they are scaring me more than the snails.

I have, well, no one. If I were to disappear today, get eaten by the snails or whatever, and they leave no trace. Would anyone even know? Where would *I* go?

The snails are down to sub-400. I only had to do two dumps to reach that number, so it’s… faster than it was. I should be happy, shouldn’t I? *Progress*. I like progress, or I should. Maybe. I had to find a new dumping ground, even further away. Was starting to be… suspicious. I don’t want anyone to get involved, not really. I was just at a loss, you know? Even more now, I think.

The wallpaper in my hallway is starting to look really weird. When the evening hits, and the artificial light from my ceiling lamp hits it just right, you know that way where the shadows are soft and golden and dark and damp and grey I can swear it bulges a little. Just a little. It looks wet, but the wet looks old. Like one of those stains you get behind your bed, if you don’t have a headboard. Fatty and I don’t even know, as if it has always been there. As if that’s where it *lives*.

I’ll do another collection round tonight, just to be sure. I think it might be my last.

I am scared.
