Just like any other day, I woke up because of the screaming kids at the daycare playground. You’d think the 100 yards and double-paned window between us would muffle their screams at least a little bit, but of course, I can’t have the luxury of waking up when my body decides it’s time. I picked up my phone, “7:02 AM”. This was my first day off in 2 weeks. Working in a convenience store during the day, and a bartender during the nights. I wasn’t one of those cool and flashy bartenders who do flamboyant tricks while flaunting their seemingly infinite charisma, all I did was pour drinks and listen to people vent about their mid-life crisis. The convenience store job was just as fun as you’d expect it to be, packing up products and putting them on shelves was about 90% of my job. It was a small, local store but they still had 8 employees, to this day I don’t know why.



The reason for me having the day off was because it was my birthday. I didn’t really feel excited, I’d thought that hitting “the big twenty” would be fun and exciting. But when I woke up, the first thing I could think of (apart from the screaming toddlers) was how much I didn’t want to work the day after. I was miserable, this had been my life for about a year and a half now. Just work, eat, sleep and repeat. That would’ve been fine if I actually gained more than just barely surviving. “Well hey, life’s hard” - they say.



Once I’d gotten up and made myself as presentable as possible, I sat down in my black leather couch I had bought from my local second hand store for $300 a year prior; probably the best purchase I’ve made since becoming an adult. I turned on the TV and checked what the news had to say, unsurprisingly, it was about war and catastrophes, maybe another pandemic or political turmoil. Before I could mutter a comment about the world going to shit, a familiar sound rang out into the living room from my pocket.



I pulled out my phone to see a text message from my mother. “Are you ready? Don’t forget! It’s your birthday and you promised to come visit us today! We’re all waiting here. Love, Mom.” I texted her back saying I was indeed ready and would start my journey home at around 11 AM.



I lived about an hour or so away from my hometown where my parents lived, so I didn’t wanna leave too early and make it awkward by barging in there before they even had a chance to get ready. I didn’t really feel appreciated by my parents growing up, I always felt like my little sister was the favorite child. My dad is a little more honest about it since we pretty much never talk unless my mom forces us to, she still acts like nothing ever happened though.



Anyway, I still had two hours left to spend, so I decided to take a walk around town and get some fresh air… and to get away from the hollering little demons. As I walked out of my apartment building, I took a deep breath. I always thought that was the best part of winter, the *cold*, *fresh* air. As soon as I started walking, I almost slipped on a frozen puddle of water hidden under a thin blanket of snow. So far, everything was going just as expected with my luck. Anyway, I kept it pushing and walked around the small town that I now called home for an hour or so. 



It was strangely quiet downtown, I only saw a couple of people. To be fair, it was a particularly cold day today, about 16 degrees fahrenheit. But still, it felt eerily empty. On my way home, I noticed a crow sitting on a branch of a dead oak tree. I’d always appreciated nature and animals when I was younger, but now I didn’t have time for even that. I think that’s the biggest reason why I was so miserable. I was so focused on work that I didn’t have time to appreciate the little things in life.



As I got back home, I packed all the things I’d need in case of an emergency since I was planning on going back home to my apartment the same day. After packing and warming up for a bit, I checked my phone for any notifications, as expected, there were no “happy birthday” texts from any of my childhood friends. “10:56 AM”.



“I might as well get going.” - I said out loud to myself. I once again put my jacket and boots on and made my way outside. I unlocked my E110 Corolla, started the engine and pulled out my window scraper. Once I was done scraping, the engine had warmed up a little so I was good to go. I pulled out of the parking lot and began my journey home to my parents, for the first time in over a year.



On the ride home, I couldn’t help but feel a little anxious. Would everything be as it used to? Sure, it wasn’t great back then either, but it sure as hell was better than it is now. Would it be awkward? Would my sister and father even acknowledge me? I had a lot of questions impossible to give myself answers to. I tried just focusing on the road ahead. Luckily it wasn’t snowing that day so the asphalt road was clear of any ice and snow thanks to all the other cars on the road.



\*\*\*



“Heyyy! You’re back!” - My mother greeted me with an awkward hug as I entered my childhood home.



“How’s it going bud? You doin’ good at work?” - My father asked with one eyebrow raised and a slight smile on his lips.



“Oh don’t start interrogating him about work now! It’s his birthday.” - My mother argued before I could give an answer.



And as for my sister, all she had to offer was a measly “hey”, and I don’t blame her to be honest. It’d been more than a year since we last saw each other and the 7 year age gap between us had always made it a little hard for us to bond. 



After saying hello and making all the usual small talk, I sat down on the couch where I had always sat to watch a movie.



“Ooh, looks like you took Oogway’s spot there bud.”



“What? Who’s Oogway?”



“Our new dog? Your mother didn’t tell you about that?”



“Uh no… she didn’t.”



“Well, he- oh! There he is!”



My father knelt down to pet the old german shepherd. It haid gray hairs near its snout and chest. After greeting my father it came over to me, he was very friendly despite being intimidatingly big for a german shepherd. I scooted over to leave some room for Oogway. I did feel a little bit betrayed, I feel like getting a dog would be a pretty big thing, something you’d want to tell your only son about; especially since we’d never had any pets. 



A few minutes went by before my mother came over to sit down on the couch. I asked her why she’d never told me about the dog. Basically all she had to say was that it simply never crossed her mind since I “didn’t like dogs”. That sentence served as the second dagger in my heart since coming here. I distinctly remember begging my parents to get a dog all throughout my childhood.



I thought to myself that I should stop being a wuss and have fun, it *was* my birthday after all. That fun wouldn’t last long however.



\*\*\*



It was around 7PM now, we hadn’t done much during the day other than watch movies and catch up at this point and my little sister hadn’t come downstairs even once. But soon, it was time for dinner. That’s probably what I’ve missed the most since moving out, the food. I feel horrible saying it but at least it’s a compliment to my mother, even if it’s a backhanded one. My mother had always been an amazing cook, she could cook anything and even had a whole notebook of recipes she came up with on her own.



Being my birthday, the dinner being served tonight was my favorite. Rotisserie chicken with roasted potatoes and some coleslaw. Might sound like somewhat of a weird mix, but don’t judge until you try.



As I helped my father set the table, my mother went upstairs to call my sister down for dinner. Following behind my mother, my sister yawned and rubbed her eyes as she descended the stairs.



“You didn’t go to school today?” - I tried to strike up a conversation with my sister.



“Nah, some dudes in suits came by the school yesterday, gathered us all up in the auditorium and told us school was out for the rest of the week. Even the teachers seemed confused but I’m not complaining.”



“Oh, alright. Don’t you think that’s weird?”



“I mean yeah, but I can’t stand that place anyway.”



Before I could ask any further questions, my father interrupted bluntly and said:



“Your sister’s being bullied.”



I didn’t know what to answer, I was kinda shocked by the sudden statement. I was bullied all throughout middle school but it was mostly mild stuff like getting called names and stuff like that. Although judging from the tone of her voice, it seemed like it was a lot worse for her. She sat staring down in her lap, obviously feeling embarrassed. Even though we weren’t that close, a part of me felt extremely upset about it. I couldn’t say or do much to help her, so I kept quiet.



My mother had definitely overheard our conversation, but chose to ignore it, as always. She let out a sigh of relief as she announced that dinner was ready. I helped her bring over the numerous plates of food and side dishes to the table.



\*\*\*



“Whaddya’ say kids? Ready to chow down on some mucho fine cuisine?”



“Dad…” - My sister said with one eyebrow raised, letting the silence speak for itself.



“Oh come on now! Just trying to lighten the mood a little, jeez.” - He replied as he threw his hands up.



We all burst out laughing. I felt happy for the first time in years at this point. My family life wasn’t the best, but it did have its moments.



Just as we were about to dig in however, I heard a faint sound coming from above. It was like the sound of an old, creaky door mixed with the growling of a wild animal.



“Did you guys hear that?”



“Hear what?” - My father responded.



“That weird growling noise from upstairs, is there another dog you haven’t told me about?” - I asked jokingly.



“Might just be the house settling.” - My father said as he shrugged.



“Sure, after living here for 23 years, definitely the house settling.” - My mother laughed.



And at that, I shrugged it off too, even though every single instinctual alarm in me was blaring. I couldn’t help but feel that something horrible was about to happen. I had lost my appetite and had begun sweating, I just sat there awkwardly as adrenaline began pumping in my veins while the others enjoyed their food. Was I having some sort of schizo-episode? Just as the thought popped up in my head, my fear was confirmed.



A loud crash erupted from above, before we could even react, the room filled with dust from the collapsed ceiling above us. From the newly created hole in the ceiling, about a foot or so in diameter, a long, sickly gray arm extended down towards my sister; too quickly to react to. The arm was covered in oozing, black blisters from which an acidic black liquid was squirting out. The room was filled with an intensely foul odor, I couldn’t help but to cover my nose with my shirt and close my eyes. It felt like my eyes would melt if I opened them even a little. My skin was burning, so many thoughts were racing through my head, I couldn’t make any sense of what was going on.



As I heard my sister cry out in pain, I snapped out of it and opened my eyes. My father stood beside my sister who was still sitting in the chair, he had grabbed a hold of the disgusting, malformed, 10 feet long arm. He looked over to me with frantic, panicked eyes and screamed at me to help, and as soon as he did, I ran as fast as I could to the kitchen and grabbed the biggest knife I could find. The big butcher knife my father had always used to butcher the animals he hunted caught my eyes. I grabbed it in a panic and ran back to the dining room. My father’s back was towards me, but I could still see him struggling against the impossible monster. I looked down at the butcher knife in my hand, realizing that I had no idea how I would hurt that thing with just a knife.



“Johnathan! Hurry!”



That was all I needed to stop doubting. I ran over and began hacking at the monstrous arm. Just after the first swing, all other sounds in the room instantly cut out. I could see Oogway barking furiously in the corner of my eye, but I couldn’t hear him, all I heard was my own heartbeat. As I penetrated its hard, gray skin, the same acidic liquid splashed all over me, instantly melting through my clothes. I ignored the pain and kept swinging my knife at it, all the while both my sister and father were screaming out in pain as their skin sizzled. After what could be 10 seconds, or 10 minutes for all I know, the arm was nearly severed just below the elbow. A few black and gray strands of seemingly rotted flesh was all that was holding it together, yet the arm still had the strength to hold my sister's arm with an iron grip.



I put all the might I had left into a single, last swing. As the arm was severed, a bone-chilling screech echoed all throughout the house, it sounded like it was coming from everywhere within the house all at once. The long, bony fingers released their grip of my sister’s arm and plopped down onto the floor. I immediately collapsed, I was dizzy and out of breath, I felt like my consciousness would be ripped from me at any second.



Just as I was about to black out, I felt a gentle pair of hands wrap around my shoulders, it was my mother. She helped me up to my feet and told me to breathe. Little by little, my vision cleared and my heart slowed down. I looked over to my sister and father, several layers of skin had melted away from my sister’s left forearm; and the same for my father’s palms.



What was this thing? Why did this happen to us? Am I cursed? Did this happen because of me? I had too many questions and I feared no one in the world could have the answers to them. As I stood looking at my injured father and sister, I suddenly felt a stabbing pain in my stomach. Without having time to check what it was, everything went black and I crashed down onto the floor, hitting my head against the table on my way down.



“At least I get to die around my family.” - Was the last thought I remembered.
