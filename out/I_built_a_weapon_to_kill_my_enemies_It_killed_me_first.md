My name is James Lansor. I'm a geneticist who has dedicated his life to science. Now, I've been recruited by High Command to take charge of an experiment designated A-01. The objective is clear: to create a being with superior strength, resilience, and intelligence, capable of confronting the group of killers who have plagued the world with their brutality and mercilessness. A test subject has been chosen: an eight-year-old boy named Clinton Grimm. He is scheduled to arrive in moments, and I must prepare for his reception.

Half an hour passed. I heard the sound of a door opening. I turned my head and saw a masked soldier in black armor holding a child with neat brown hair and a white-and-green striped shirt. I adjusted my posture, becoming more formal. I approached the soldier, greeted him, and then looked at the small child, who was flustered, looking around in fear, trembling.

An unsettling feeling began to creep into my chest. Was it pity? Empathy? I tried to push those thoughts from my mind. If High Command knew I felt even the slightest form of pity, the consequences would be severe.

My gaze hardened. I ordered the soldier to transfer the boy, Clinton, to his room until the first experiment was ready.

I watched the soldier take Clinton to his private holding cell. Then, the sound of a communicator chimed. I walked over to it, pressed the button to open the channel, and began to speak.

"Hello, who is this?"

A gruff, cold voice answered, making my eyes narrow. "Hello. This is Civil Defense Commander Jack Krook. I'm inquiring about Asset A-01. Has it arrived as stated in the reports?"

I answered with a composed tone that hid my unease. "Yes, Commander Jack. Asset A-01 has arrived and has been transferred to room F-167."

Jack replied, his voice slightly pleased. "Good. And remember, any attempt at empathy or freeing the asset will be met with severe punishment. You will regret it for the rest of your life. We went to great lengths to find such a good specimen. Is that understood?"

I replied submissively. "Yes, sir. Understood. I will not show any empathy."

The line went dead. I let out a heavy sigh, hoping the coming days would pass smoothly.

The next day arrived. I tried my best to calm myself. My heart was pounding. This was my first time experimenting on a child, on a human being. But my life was being threatened by that commander. *I'm sorry, little one, for what is about to happen to you today, and for what comes after.*

I entered the operating room and found the boy, Clinton, nearly naked and bound with leather straps to an examination table. I could see the terror in his eyes. He was trembling, trembling violently, and a single tear rolled down his cheek.

I ignored his frightened gaze and began to prepare the tools for the first experiment.

I picked up the experiment file and examined it closely.

**Experiment Number:** 1
**Experiment Name:** Regeneration Serum
**Lead Scientist:** James Lansor
**Subject:** Clinton Grimm
**Time of Completion:** [blank]
**Result:** [blank]
**Procedure:**
A syringe filled with a fluid composed of parasitic cells that significantly increase human recovery rates is to be used. It must be injected specifically into the median cubital vein. The injection must be administered slowly to avoid complications. A cotton swab should be placed next to the needle before removal. The needle should be withdrawn slowly, and the injection site covered with the cotton swab, applying gentle pressure for one to two minutes. Afterward, the syringe must be placed in a plastic container and disposed of in a secure location to prevent any potential contamination of the scientists. After these procedures, the injection site must be checked for bleeding. Once confirmed, another cotton swab should be applied and wrapped with gauze. Wait for a maximum of 30 minutes. Then, test the serum's effect by severing a part of the subject's body and waiting to see if it regenerates. **Important: Do not anesthetize the subject, as anesthesia will halt the regeneration process, making it impossible to determine if the procedure is successful.**

The file ended there. I understood exactly what I had to do. First, take the syringe.

Looking over, I saw it on the table beside me. I picked it up, examined it closely, and stared at the red liquid inside.

Then came the next step: injecting it into Clinton's body, specifically into the median cubital vein. Alright, then.

I looked at the operating chair. The boy was still trembling, though it had subsided slightly.

I approached him and took his left hand. I brought the syringe closer to the vein and began to insert it slowly. I could feel Clinton's hand shaking intensely, and I sensed his fear of the needle, but I completely ignored his feelings.

I injected the fluid with complete calm, simultaneously focusing on Clinton's body for any signs of adverse reactions that could lead to severe injury.

But Clinton began to scream loudly, trying to push the needle away. I tightened my grip to hold him steady, and other assistants came to restrain him.

This continued for about seven minutes until the syringe was completely empty of the fluid. No threatening symptoms were detected in the boy. I placed a cotton swab next to the needle, removed the syringe, and covered the site with the swab. I applied pressure and held it until two minutes had passed. I lifted a small part of the cotton and saw that the bleeding had indeed stopped.

I placed the syringe in a plastic container, sealed it tightly, and ordered one of the nurses beside me to take it and dispose of it in a secure location. Then, I began to wait for the thirty-minute period to end. As I looked at the boy, who was panting from so much screaming, a pain bloomed in my heart, and a wave of guilt washed over me. I began to question myself.

*"Is this really the best way to confront the killers scattered everywhere? Why not just call the police or deploy the army? Is this really worth the childhood and life of an innocent boy like Clinton? Is what I'm doing right? Is trying to create a monster to be used as a weapon for the government right? I don't know. And I don't want to know. The very idea is enough to make me break down mentally. And I can't do anything, even if I wanted to. My life is also on the line with this experiment. I am so, so sorry, Clinton. I am truly sorry."*

The 30 minutes ended, and nothing had happened to Clinton's body. After confirming that he was stable, the final stage of the procedure began. I picked up the scalpel beside me, sterilized and cleaned it meticulously, and went to the boy's body. When he caught sight of the scalpel in my hand, he began to pant heavily, his eyes wide with fear. He tried to pull away, but the restraints prevented his escape.

I gripped his right hand tightly. Clinton was begging me, pleading in every way he could for me to let him go, but I did my best to ignore his pleas. I placed the scalpel on his index finger and began to cut, quickly, just to get it over with. The hand holding the boy's was trembling, my heart hammering in my chest. *I want this to be over. I just want it to be over.*

A minute passed. I had severed the front part of the finger. I picked it up and placed it on an examination tray. Now came the decisive moment. The severed part had to regenerate. Now.

I sat down on a chair and waited. The minutes passed like hours. I was waiting for even a hint that the experiment was a success, but all I could see was Clinton, his finger bleeding profusely, his body writhing in the straps as he wept with burning pain.

Despair washed over me. Time passed, and nothing happened. I picked up the report file, ready to write down the experiment's result as a failure, when I noticed the nurse beside me. She had a look of shock on her face, her eyes fixed on Clinton. I looked at the boy and saw it: tissues were slowly growing from his severed finger. Minutes passed, and the tissues grew more and more, forming the shape of the missing finger.

My eyes widened in disbelief. I stood up and walked towards Clinton, looking at his finger up close. It was growing back. Another ten minutes passed, and the finger was whole again, as it was before.

The experiment had succeeded. Unexpectedly, completely. I took the report and began to write.

**Experiment Number:** 1
**Experiment Name:** Regeneration Serum

**Time of Completion:** 1 hour, 15 minutes
**Result:** Success

I stamped the report and ordered the guards to transfer Clinton to his room and ensure he was comfortable, to allow him to recover fully from the experiment.

I left the operating room and returned to my office. Just then, the communicator chimed. I pressed the button and said, "Hello, who is this?"

Laughter came from the caller, a cheerful yet gravelly voice that was familiar to me. "Hahaha! Well, well, Dr. Lansor. It seems the first experiment was a success, wasn't it?"

I remained silent, staring at the device. I recognized him. It was Jack. I cleared my throat and spoke with a firm voice. "Yes, the first experiment was successful. But I have several questions."

Jack's laughter stopped. "Questions? Oh, yes. Ask away. No problem at all."

"First, how did you know the experiment was a success when I haven't submitted the report yet? Second, do we really have to do this? I mean, must we perform such horrific experiments on a child just to stop a group of killers? Why not call the police, or at most, the army? Is this truly necessary?"

The line went quiet for a moment. Then, Jack answered, his voice cold as ice.

"So, those are your questions. Fine. Since you are the head of this department, I suppose I should fill you in on what this operation represents. Regarding your first question, I can control and view all the surveillance cameras in this building whenever I wish. As for your second question, your words are logical on the surface, but you know nothing about these killers. They are not ordinary people, as you seem to think. If they were, why would I spend millions of dollars and so much time on a project like this? This is out of our hands, and the army would be useless. He is our only hope against them. So, do your job well, and don't ask such sensitive questions again. I've answered you. If I see any doubt in you next time, there will be... problems."

The connection was suddenly cut. I stared at the communicator, my blood running cold. What did he mean, they weren't ordinary people? Was he joking? What was going on? I literally had more questions now than answers. I grabbed the remote and watched Clinton's room on the TV screen in front of me. I just stared at him.

He was broken. Sitting in a corner, curled in on himself, shaking violently. I remembered the Commander's words—that this trembling child was our only hope. Hope against what, I didn't know. But I had to act as they wanted. If this was our only hope, then I had to believe, even just a little, that this was our only hope.

Five days later.

**Experiment Number:** 2
**Experiment Name:** Parasitic Hand
**Procedure:** In this experiment, I severed Asset A-01's right hand and replaced it with parasitic tentacles. I attached them, and slowly, they began to interact with the body until they formed the shape of his old hand. It was now a pale green color, with strange lines running through it. But that is unimportant.
**Result:** Success.

Three weeks later.

**Experiment Number:** 13
**Experiment Name:** Cursed Body
**Procedure:** A so-called "Curse Mage" was brought in. I didn't trust the idea, considering it mere nonsense. But when the mage began his work, I saw with my own eyes as Asset A-01's body changed. The left side of his face began to contort, putting immense pressure on the eye tissue, causing it to fly out of his body. It landed in front of me as I stood there, unable to believe what I was seeing. The left side of his face was now twisted, while the right side remained unharmed, though it had become completely pale. I asked the mage about the result, and he informed me that, strangely, not all the curses had taken hold, and only some had succeeded.
**Result:** Partial Success.

One year later.

**Experiment Number:** 25
**Experiment Name:** Beast Hand
**Procedure:** I was given DNA samples from a strange beast I did not recognize and was ordered to merge them with Asset A-01. I didn't say much. I performed the operation, maintaining maximum concentration. And indeed, after hours of work, the procedure was complete. I had successfully merged the samples with his left hand, resulting in a red-colored hand with fingers that could transform into sharp, hard claws capable of cutting through anything. I was overjoyed. This was the first success after a long series of failed experiments.
**Result:** Success.

Two years later.

**Experiment Number:** 37
**Experiment Name:** Steel Body
**Procedure:** We placed Asset A-01 in a glass capsule filled with a green liquid intended to transform his body from a natural one into a steel-like form, impervious to damage. We tried our best to make the procedure succeed, but that was not the case. The previously attached parts were incompatible with the liquid, and the body began to react violently against itself. We immediately removed him from the capsule. Upon examination, we discovered that his body had become extremely sensitive to pain. Any wound, no matter how minor, now caused pain at a level of 200 out of 100.
**Result:** Failure.

One year later.

I was examining the operation logs. Forty-three operations had been performed on him. Thirteen of them were successful, and thirty were failures.

The reports showed the complete failure we had achieved in creating a monster that should never have been created. On top of it all, Jack had ordered his termination, because he had become more of a burden than an asset to the government. Damn it. Damn it, damn it. What was I supposed to do now? Did I really have to terminate this creature, or should I let it escape? What should I choose?

I looked at the TV screen showing Asset A-01. He was destroyed. His body was mutilated, everything innocent had been stripped away from him. No body, no features, nothing. Just a monstrosity, deemed a failed experiment that must now be terminated. But... what was happening to him? Why was he raising his hand upwards in that strange way? Had he truly gone mad? And that smile... what the hell was happening?

The TV screen went black. In that moment, I felt a sense of danger. An unsettling feeling in my chest heralding a coming threat. I stood up from my desk, left the office, and immediately ordered the guards to check room F-167. The guards headed there directly, and I was with them. One of the guards moved to open the door, but it was blasted outwards with immense force, smashing him against the wall and crushing his body.

Asset A-01 emerged from the room, his face cold and emotionless. His right hand had transformed into tentacles, and he began to wave them, killing anyone in his path. The blood froze in my veins as I watched the massacre unfold before me.

I tried to speak, but A-01 gave me no chance. He began to attack me. I backed away, retreating, and ran at full speed. I entered my office with A-01 chasing me. I slammed the door shut, put my body against it, and began to speak, my voice filled with desperation.

"Clinton, listen to me. I know you're angry. I know you're broken. But please, just listen before you decide my fate. I'm sorry. I'm truly sorry. Yes, I destroyed you completely. I disfigured your body, destroyed your innocence, buried your childhood. But know that it wasn't in my hands. I didn't want to do it, believe me. I was forced. I was threatened. Just understand me, even a little."

In that moment, a blow struck the door, throwing it open with such force that it sent me to the floor. The door landed beside me. Clinton advanced, his disfigured face showing rage and hatred. The irises of his eyes had turned a deep red, and his piercing gaze paralyzed my body. I could only stare at him as he began to speak.

"Sorry? Do you really think your apology will change anything? I am broken. Destroyed. An apology will do nothing for me. Every day, I feel pain because of you. I always saw you. You were the one who cut off my finger. You were the one who replaced my hand. You were the one who disfigured my face. All of this is because of you. You are the one who made me a monster. And you think I will forget that? No. No. Impossible. Impossible. You must die. You must die in the most gruesome way. I will not have mercy on you. I will not forgive you. What I want is your mangled, torn-apart corpse. That is what I want."

I listened to him. His voice was hollow and raspy, and it made me remember every operation I had performed, every time I had cut a piece of his body and replaced it with another. It was then that I fully realized that this was my fault. I was weak. I was a coward. I chose my own life over the life of the child in front of me. I had trampled on my principles, trampled on what a true scientist is supposed to be. I don't deserve his forgiveness. I deserve death. Yes, I am too despicable to ask for life.

I stood before Clinton, looking at him with a gaze of pure regret. I began to speak to myself.

*"If you want this body, take it. Unleash your anger on me. Kill me. Tear me apart. This is what I deserve for what I've done."*

And in an instant, I felt nothing. A tentacle pierced my abdomen, and in the next moment, I saw only darkness.

Clinton tore James's body to pieces. Nothing remained but blood and scattered remains. He then turned to the rest of the scientists and guards to complete his massacre.
