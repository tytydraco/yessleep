Most car radios are only built for FM and AM radio stations, but for some older models, there is a third option. 



I only now know as much as I do about Shortwave radio stations because of all the research I have done, all the forums I’ve looked through, all the people I’ve talked to, maybe in some sort of bid to protect the only family I have, my little daughter. Shortwave radio is a mostly out of date format to broadcast radio internationally, country to country - it was mostly used during the cold war as a way for the soviets to communicate to soldiers overseas. Many of you have probably heard of the mysterious Russian number station, that was a shortwave station, nowadays shortwave is mostly used by amateur radioists….. But this is not that. I am writing this as sort of a warning to anyone out there, please just stay away from shortwave radio, at least for now, something bad is going on, that even I’m not sure of. 



We were driving. That was all.



I’m a single father to my daughter, Lisa, she’s 8 and she's everything to me. We were driving on a stretch of forested highway on the way to my mothers house, not much signal out there, so we were listening to the radio. I remember murmuring to myself about a missing page of stamps that I didn’t know what happened too, as Lisa was reaching forward from the back seat playing with the radio tuner. I was pretty zoned out, getting hypnotized by the long windy highway roads, until Lisa snapped me out of it. She must have switched the tuning from FM to Shortwave; didn’t even know she knew how to do that.



 “Look dad! Listen to this!”



I blinked quickly, being snapped out of my daze, and I heard static at first, but then \*click\* sound started coming through, there was still static, but there was now sound coming through. It was circus music, cheap sounding circus music if that make sense, and then a jolly voice came through 



“Well hello kids. It’s Marvelous Mervo here…… I have another fun story for you today! This one’s about Billy…”



The voice was somewhat low quality, but he had some sort of accent that I couldn’t put my finger on. “Mervo” continued on about some story about Billy, and how Billy didn’t pray before bed, and got in trouble with his parents. Religious Children Programming? On Shortwave? I was a little freaked out, but more confused. After a long-winded story, he signed off.



“He-he children, it's very sad for me to say but that's all the time we have today…… Before I go, let's celebrate some of our great adult followers from around the world! Follower 25, Follower 144, Follower 95…..”



I clicked the station off before he could finish, and switched it back to the classic hits FM station I was listening to earlier 

“Hey! Turn it back on dad…” Lisa yelled at me from the back 



“I’m sorry honey, dad wants to listen to some of his music...” I said calmly back



What I didn’t let on to Lisa was how absolutely spooked I was, something didn’t feel right about that station, it sounded like it came straight out of a horror movie. I made a mental note to come back to it later.



Soon we reached my mother's house. Me and Lisa were planning on staying there for a week or so, to spend some time with my mother, who we don’t see too much. By the time we got there, it was already late afternoon, so after having dinner with my mother, I went to tuck my daughter into bed in the guest room. As she laid down, I noticed a small portable radio sitting in the corner of the guestroom, which made that weird feeling come back from earlier- I decided to say something about it to Lisa before I kissed her good night.



“Hey listen honey….. That station you were listening to earlier, I don’t want you listening to that again…. Ok?” 



“But why dad?..”  she said softly back to me



“I just… don’t want you too alright? I will be very mad if you do.” I said sternly 



“Alright...” Lisa said in a sad tone, not looking me in the eyes as she said so.



Later that night I sat in the living room thinking about that radio station. My mother tried to calm my nerves by giving me a smoke, but it did not work. Soon I found myself walking back out to the car to try and tune to that station that we stumbled upon earlier. The thing about Shortwave Stations is that they don’t have exact call signs like FM, so I was sitting in my car, dead of night, searching through shortwave stations, making myself feel like I was going crazy, until I found it again. It seems like I caught old Mervo mid-sentence, as the familiar circus music and jolly voice of unknown origin filled the car. 



  “-- You know kids, many people question our beliefs… They are false prophets, that's all they are… Many of your parents are false prophets, but they don’t understand that the gods came down and told us what he wanted, and what they needed to live….” 



Then there was a pause, he then quieted down and spoke more seriously.



“Remember Children, Tune in every night, that's what God wants…… Follower 34, stay on alert for messages from him.” 



I quickly turned off the radio. That last sentence, it sounded like a threat. Needless to say, I wanted answers, I wanted to call the police, I didn’t though, because what if i was just going crazy, maybe this was just a normal Christian station, but all this talk of followers made me think otherwise. I decided to do my own research. I laid on my mattress later that night and typed away on my computer. I ended up on a forum: The HF Collective, it seemed to be a forum for shortwave hobbyists and amateur operators to catalog frequencies or oddities. I made a post there, describing the station and the frequencies I found it at, and asked for any help. Hours later I got a response.



 “You just found 5H-K1DZ. Nobody’s heard anything from it since 2005. Probably shouldn’t go messing around with it.”  
  


The user, gh0stQL, attached a low-quality screen cap of an old HF Collective newsletter dated August 9th, 2005. It had a tiny write up



 *“Strange unlicensed intercept: 5H-K1DZ heard broadcasting odd religious material. Possibly a prankster or an actual cult. Any operators who hear anything concerning. Should report to the FCC immediately. It has no traceable source.”*  



I asked if anyone knew where it broadcasted from, another user answered, his response chilled me 



 “I think the transmitter moves. It seemed to be spotted all over the place, last I heard some user traced it back to some city in Russia - We stopped looking into it though, we didn’t want to stick our heads where they didn’t belong” 



In contrast to the people of this forum, I most definitely did want to stick my head where it didn’t belong, I still couldn’t itch the feeling that there was something bad behind this that involved children. 



The next day Me, Lisa, and My Mom went to a local park and spent the day there. While Lisa was playing with some other kids, me and my mom spoke,



“You know, Lisa has been talkin’ bout some new bedtime friend she has… must be an imaginary buddy or something.” My mother said to me 



I snapped back “It better not be that damn shortwave station again; I told her not to listen to that again… mom take that radio out of the guest room.”



She obliged.



Later that night, I reminded Lisa to just not listen to the radio at all. I went back out to the living room and then out the door to my car again, and on to the radio, then I found what I was looking for - the station chimed on around the same time that I caught it the previous night... But it was not the same jolly voice that I had heard the previous nights, this time he was angry, and the audio was more distorted  and there was a child there with him.



“Child Mervo told you many times…. Sometimes God gets hungry, and God needs children's sacrifices. You would do anything for him wouldn’t you?”



The child snapped back



“Please Mervo…… Let me go home….”



The child's voice was distant, as if they were across the room from wherever Mervo was speaking.



“Why you little-” 



Mervo yelled this, then there were shuffling noises…. Then there was radio silence. This silenced only lasted a few seconds, then the distorted circus music and jolly voice came back on



“I’m sorry about that children, I thought I told you children that obedience is key….”



What did I just hear? I quickly picked up my phone to call 911, but just as I was about to, I heard the one thing I didn’t want to hear.



“In good news! One of our new friends, Lisa, is about to get a warm visit from follower 34!”



I dropped my phone. 



“Oh no god… t-this can’t be happening” 



There were a million thoughts rushing through my head, but I got up and ran into the house. I reached her room and slammed open the door, and there was Lisa, awake, sitting calmly by that damn radio, listening to that station. I snatched the radio and threw it against the wall. 



“Lisa, didn't I tell you not to listen to the radio!” 



Lisa ignored what I said and yelled back, looking at the now broken radio on the ground 



“Hey! I was listening to that! That was my favorite show!” she said 



I said back



“Favorite show? You just started listening to it a few days ago!”



Lisa looked at me and then looked down



“I’ve been listening to Mervo at home since before I showed you while we were in the car, I didn’t tell you because you didn’t seem to like it.”

I stood there, speechless. I said calmly 



“..... Why was he talking about you on the radio...”:



“Well…. He told us to send him a letter introducing ourselves, and where we lived, so I took some of your stamps and mailed to the address he gave...”



We didn’t stay in grandma's house long. We all rushed down to the nearest police station and filed a report on what happened. I come to find out later while an investigator is talking to me that the night Mervo mentioned Lisa getting a visit, neighbors reported a guy breaking into our house through the back window back home. He said they arrested the man, but couldn’t ID him, he had no papers, just a big 34 tattoo on his left arm. They said the police have reason to believe that the man was planning on kidnapping Lisa, because of some tools found on him.



The station is now under FBI investigation, and hopefully they placed us in a safe location where those people can’t find us. I still can’t wrap my head around what happened, and I fear that this could be something bigger than we could imagine. These “Followers” around the world, kidnapping children and bringing them to god knows where. For my safety I’m no longer looking into this and leaving it to the cops, I’m even using a proxy to post this, just in case. I beg whoever is reading this to please not to tune to any shortwave station, and don’t let your kids anywhere near it. Just stick to FM.
