 A colorless apathetic sky accompanied the blackbird’s singing as I, drowsily, began waking up to a rhythmic knocking at my door, and I hurriedly brushed my eyes with my fists and, half-alive half-dead, said “Hello?”, My father’s maid in a hushed voice said ominously “I have something to show you”.   

 

“Be right there”

 

The wind was particularly loud this morning, like it was pleading something. As I opened the front gate the rusty rattle made me grimace and my teeth shudder. I live in a sizable house, and I'd say Jane’s upkeep is more than enough to keep a shine on even the oldest decorum, but it always bothered her, that gate’s never-ending high-pitched yelp. 

As she led me down the stone steps to the beach, I felt an odd eeriness in the air, the wind slowed down to a halt and went unnaturally quiet.  

 

I despise the sand. I know, that’s a strong opinion for sand. It's just the texture that makes me uncomfortable, and the taste, though I haven’t tried that yet. On purpose. “It’s here... somewhere.” Jane said while biting into her gum inquisitively. Truth is I haven’t been living here long, since my father passed by... his own volition, I felt guilty. I never made an effort to be there for him, he lived far away, and we never really talked much after... my birth. He was the chairman of a big ocean cruise liner, he made good money, but he never chose to live in the city which he could undoubtedly have afforded. He chose to live here, on the coast of Belfast, the house is luxurious, and the view of the cerulean ocean is vast if not a little isolating. After I graduated, I moved down to this home, that was a couple months ago now, I met Jane while she was cleaning the porch, my father had been gone for a while by then, I wondered why she bothered keeping up the house even though my father wasn’t paying her anymore, she claimed she “had nothing else to do”, and “was the least she could do”. Whatever that means. I moved here to try and understand my father, and what he did.  

 

“I got it!”, she half-laughingly yelled. Whatever it was it was pushed into the sand buried deep by the wave’s unabashed crashes. “Here”. 

I grabbed the object and examined it closely. It was covered in seaweed and sand and various minerals, but I could make out the situationally odd shape of a doll. For a second I could swear the Toy blinked at me and got freaked out and dropped it back in the sand and the wind picked up again. 

 

2 weeks later, 2 more children’s Toys had amassed on the shore, every Sunday. A pattern emerges, and me and Jane try to theorize on what’s causing this. I feel crazy thinking about the possibilities, because each one is sillier and less realistic than the last. Until we got to a “Santa Claus Crash” and the absurdity was almost beautiful.

 This whole situation got me and the near sexagenarian Jane closer than we’ve ever been in the last few months, for a while she just felt like an empty spirit trapped to serve my father’s orders whilst I sat around and watched the free labor go ahead, now it felt like we were friends, she’d tell me stories of my father and the type of man he was, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist. Yes, I did realize she was describing Tony Stark after a few days, but apparently these attributes fitted my father, although that was before she met him, before he turned into a “husk”, funny, I thought she was the aimless ghost, but it turns out my father seemed like an apparition.

 I asked her what happened, and she seemed dismissive, like I didn’t want to know, like I shouldn’t. I complained that it was the whole reason I moved here, left my “life” behind. Honestly, I didn’t have much of a life to go back to, but I liked it here, the howling wind was somewhat soothing for some reason, though sometimes it feels like it doesn’t want to relax me. 

 The following Sunday something new arrived on the shore, we figured out at exactly 2:20am every morning a new Toy arrived, each more disfigured than the last, unsurprisingly, as if they were all from the same source, some of these Toys must’ve been drifting along for weeks now. Me and Jane did our new weekly ritual of walking down the stone steps at 8am, searching for 20 minutes, and whoever found the Toy won. This time something was different, the waves crashed in a way I’ve never felt before, the winds blew like a wolf against bricks, the cold bitter and biting my skin. Something was off. 

 

“Ha, Ha! Got it-” Jane began screaming. Jane yelled expletives, named every person in the bible thrice, and fell to the ground in a sweaty panic. My eyes widened, I wanted to help Jane, but I felt the air push against me, drag me to the dug up “Toy”, or maybe that was my curiosity, or a mix of both.

 The smell from the figure was rancid, like opening a bin of multi-cultured food with rotten fruit that had been festering for days, weeks. I assumed it was ocean smells. The doll this time had been bigger. What was once a barbie is now football sized but shaped oddly. My mouth brought up a filling of saliva as I slowly and carefully picked up the Toy, I could hear Jane gagging behind me.

 I softly wiped off the sand and seaweed, darkened skin revealed itself, not from melanocytes, but from decomposition. As my legs and hands nearly gave up, every other part of my body did. My eyes were burning. I had them open for so long. The blanket in which the corpse was held fell to the ground as did one of the limbs attached. I heard a soft whisper coming from the ocean as my hands held tightly on the child’s body. “You see now? Do you understand?” I made out a couple more words, in jumbled order, subsequently: “Caused”, “This”, “Monster”, I stared blankly at the ocean. I felt vomit reach my mouth. I couldn’t let it out. I couldn’t open my mouth. I couldn’t swallow it either. I felt it swish around my teeth, gums, tongue. 

The wind was screaming. The clouds began to thunder. A final hiss from the ocean caused me to break this almost sleep paralysis state as I gently placed down the child. Jane was beside me now, down on her knees, face in her chest, hands clasped together, begging “Please. Please God. Please. I’m sorry”. Sorry? 

 

Before long the final coda of wind blew past, and the storm subsided. Jane couldn’t stop crying. I didn’t see her at the house the next day. Or the next day. Or the next. Then Sunday arrived. I was awoken by a Raven almost artificially cawing over and over like it had no purpose but to wake me. I then, in the quiet of the dark morning, heard a guttural yelp like a dog stepping in a bear trap, it was Jane. I slept in my clothes the night before, I was piling on uncultivated facial hair, and I could feel my eye bags sagging my face, yet this had been the most alert I think I've ever been. I rushed down the stone steps in shorts and a pajama top, the air bristled with anticipation, the clouds devoid of any color, the sand murkier than a bog. I saw Jane standing out in the ocean, not too far, but far enough to where the waves should be throwing her around. There was a dedicated area of pure thrashing, I thought if I went around it, I would get to Jane with no trouble. “Wait! I’ll be right there!”. I yelled, with no response. Jane simply looked out into the ocean lifelessly. “Jane?” I took off my shoes and ran into the water. “Stop!” she yelled. “What?” I responded. “Go straight, it’s quicker, and I need to get away right now!” this sounded off. Like it was an imitation of Jane, she lost her charm and was left with the stripped essentials of her tone. “Oh, Okay”. I was worried that the last “Toy” had freaked Jane out so much she had become numb, she must’ve been, the water was freezing.  

 

As I dragged my feet against the water, becoming more enveloped under the shore’s tide, my vision started becoming shaky, sporadic and unruly. Suddenly, everything went calm, Jane was gone, and the wind had calmed down, all that was left was the calm ocean breeze and my heavy panting. I froze. I took a deep breath and before I could move anywhere something touched my leg. Then 4 more, fingers, a hand. It dragged me down, have you ever felt that? Being dragged into the water against your will? I kept going down, the water wasn’t this deep, it was barely above my knee, I thought, but I kept going down, until the surface of the water was a distant dream. Then I stopped. It was dark with a light of blue shading the sky of the sea. I was completely underwater, I felt my lungs open back up, I could breathe and open my eyes. Then the worst thing could’ve happened, I started realizing where I was.  

 

The deepest I’ve ever been, the water was completely clear, I didn’t even produce any bubbles, I felt my legs gently sway as my body couldn’t move, all I could do was stare into the blank abyss ahead of me. Nothing, clear silence. Unnatural silence, like an awkward comment or accident, this wasn’t happening, this wasn’t meant to be happening. Something approached me. Gigantic. I couldn’t make it out. It felt as if I was a child staring up from the knees of something much bigger than me. A hauntingly loud boat horn echoed throughout the blue void. My ears felt full of water, the sound it makes when fully diving underneath, just that, forever. I couldn’t speak; I couldn’t do anything. I was trapped. The galactic entity moved closer to me, I was about to cry from fear, everything hurt, things I didn’t even realize that could be painful were, in excruciating depth. The cartilage of my ear, the inner part of my kneecap, the skin under my fingernails. I floated for so long. Stuck here in this cold, dark, wet prison. “I asked you, do you understand?”, I nodded my head yes to the ungendered omnipotent voice out of fear of repercussions for any other answer or non-answer. “Do you think you’ve suffered enough?” Before I could nod my head again the voice spoke once more. “Because I don’t”. “Every Sunday you will return here, like your father, and visit me, or I’ll take something from you”. I felt a chill through chills, what does that mean? “Like I took Jane”. I tried screaming, telling this monster “I have nothing!”. But I couldn’t, yet it reacted like it still heard me. “Then I will take you”. Why? “1,507” What? “1,507 Sundays”.  

 

I woke up covered, I thrashed my way up out of the sand on the shore, my mouth was filled with the stuff, I even swallowed some. It was pitch black. The wind was howling, this time differently, like it was laughing. I walked up the stone steps to the house and heard sirens, I checked the date and saw that it was next week, next Sunday. I was down there for a week. The clock read 2:25, I went to my room, I felt more alone than I’d ever felt before, and on my bedside locker was a doll. Pristine. On it was a note that read, “Coward”.
