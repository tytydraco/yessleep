Since I was little, I tried to understand why these terrible creatures visited my room every day. Once, while talking to my mom, still a child, I tried to explain what happened to me every single night. I told her that everything always started right after I fell asleep. I would suddenly wake up but couldn’t move anywhere, while a weight on my chest pressed me against the bed. Even though I was paralyzed, some of my senses worked better than normal, while others seemed to stop existing. I could see, hear, and feel everything perfectly, but there was that feeling of vulnerability, as if something was stopping me from speaking, screaming, or doing anything besides observing, hearing, feeling, and waiting.

The more I tried to escape that state, the harder I was pushed against my bed. The weight on my chest grew stronger, and deafening noises invaded my ears. So, there I was, always losing track of time, just running my eyes around every corner of my sight to be sure I was really in my room and that it wasn’t just a terrible dream.

Then, breaking the silence or the noises with his heavy steps, a man in a suit and top hat would enter my room. His face was unrecognizable, shrouded in a dreadful darkness. His body was similar to that of any slender person, but bigger in every way.

This man always arrived with his heavy steps, pulled up my chair, and sat as if it were made just for him. Then, he would start watching me. His eyes weren’t visible, but I could feel a perverse, inhuman gaze that never looked away from me.

He never said anything, and the longer I stared, the more frightened I became. After seeing this night after night, no one could convince me it was just a recurring nightmare. After a while, it becomes easy to tell dreams from reality.

After I shared this experience, my mom, thinking it was just a repetitive nightmare, just joked:

— It’s just a tired man borrowing your chair for a while, don’t be rude.

And, well, in a way, she was right. There was a time when my anxiety attacks got worse. I also couldn’t sleep well during the nights. I stayed hyperactive, thinking about a billion different things, or sad, and likewise, thinking about a billion different things. And that’s when the Tired Man began to show up. First on days when I didn’t sleep well. Then on days when I could only fall asleep very late because my racing mind wouldn’t let me rest. Sometimes when I lost all motivation and decided to lie down. Until it started happening every day. He was always there while I remained in that "trance." And with each appearance of the Tired Man, I saw him grow stronger while I felt weaker, more tired, and powerless. It was like a parasite draining all my energy, waiting for the right moment to steal my life.

When I grew tired of just accepting all this, I started trying to stay awake for as long as possible. Four days passed, and I feel like I’ve reached my limit. I’m dying, inside and out, while struggling to write these words. I’m scared because I have no more energy left. I’ve already removed all the chairs from my room and filled it with enough stuff that there’s no room left for anyone, standing or otherwise.

Well, I really hope this works. I pray for all those who, like me, are being visited by the Tired Man. I hope with all my heart that you manage to rid yourselves of this curse as soon as possible because when you think the Tired Man will only satisfy himself with your vital energy, your body will become the feast.
