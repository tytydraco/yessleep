Day1:It was just 8:33 a.m. on your usual saturday morning until the news channel suddenly changed to static,and a few seconds later a recorded voice started playing along with messages showing instructions:

"Emergency alert,this is not a drill,i repeat,this is not a drill,turn off all the lights and close all windows and doors,do anything to make sure any source of light is not visible from the outside,make sure to stay inside and only leave if absolutely necessary,if you hear voices calling from the outside do not be fooled by them, and again this is not a drill,be aware of what hides where you can't see. Follow all instructions until the next message appears."

Then it changed to static once again,me and my roommate just stood there in shock and looking at each other with confused glares:

"Bro,what even was that?! That can't be real,we never had emergencies like this!" -I said while being a little scared.
"I don't know,but if it is that serious to the point of sending such message on all channels then it must not be a joke." -He told me while trying to calm me down.

Eventually we decide to do as told and started closing every window and door possible,leaving only the kitchen's lights on which barely reach the living room,let alone the outside areas of the house,we also applied some dirty blankets to make sure light wasnt slipping through narrrow spots on doors.

The only thing that let us know what was going on outside was a small window on the attic which didn't even have lamps so it was somewhat safe to look. Surely it was a bit chaotic,some people tried to unload their cars in a hurry while some desperatly tried to get inside theirs home and close everything,after seeing all of that we both were sure it was not a good idea to step outside.

The first 2 hours were very boring since we couldn't do much besides walking around and calculating the food rationing,we were lucky that we always did a lot of grocery shopping so we had a lot of biscuits,juice and other snacks stored. Eventually we decided to cool off and just started a drawing competition,after a bit we got tired and decided to play some board games.

Day3:After some time we decided to check the attic window once again due to curiosity since the screams of people outside had stopped. Now the streets were eerily empty,not even pigeons or stray animals were passing by,and not too long after a fog started to form and while it wasn't that heavy,it still was enough to reduce our field of vision by a few yards:

"Man,they didn't tell us about this,should we be worried about this as much as the lights?" -I asked,trembling and pretty much already expecting an yes.
"Of course dude,if they couldn't tell us about this then it's pretty obvious we have to be worried about this." -He said on a rough tone.

Day6:A few days passed and nothing seemed out of ordinary at the morning of day 6 until we were eating lunch and started hearing loud noises onthe roof,it was like something big was quickly walking on all fours,to make it easier to understand imagine a cat walking on your roof but twice as loud along with some inhuman like chattering. We froze in fear,we already weren't aware of an incoming fog on the first day,let alone those sounds made by whatever God knows what.

Day8:We were starting to get paranoid,the sounds continued and when we thought whatever was outside went away,something else seemed to come in it's place and haunted us as well and we didn't even have any idea of what it was. Suddenly the static on the Tv stopped and the second message played on the same style as the first:

"Emergency alert,regarding the previous message,it is advised to not go outside anymore until further notice,if you hear anything outside turn off all lights,even if it doesn't reach outside just turn them off,if the sounds start to fade away wait until they cannot be heard anymore and after a few minutes you are safe to turn the lights again,last reminder of the message,be aware of what hides where you can't see."

That just added nightmare fuel on us,we had no idea of what was outside nor we knew how to properly deal with it. Eventually we decided to ration food again even if our stock wasn't running out soon,the boredom plus the fact we could not do anything against the hell spawns that lurked just out of the doors was just killing us.

Day 9:Since we haven't checked the attic window in a while we decided to do it since we had nothing else to do. After a bit of watching we saw nothing out of ordinary on the wrecked street of abandoned cars and broken down mail boxes,that is,until we looked up on the window just as something huge flew above the block,it looked like a bird but so skinny that it seemed to be just a flying skeletal avian.

That was more than enough for us to quickly crawl back away from the window,scared for our dear lives and contemplating what even was that thing on the sky. After trying to calm ourselves for a while we went back to the kitchen,we weren't the religious types but it just went across our minds to at least this time on this seemingly endless hell to pray.

Just as we finished we weren't really expecting to instantly be saved or that it would all end at that very moment,so we decided to sleep earlier and wish that the best happened the next day.

Day 11:Much hasn't changed except the fact that our stock was running out a bit quicker than we previously expected,it was extremelly risky but he decided to go to the house next to ours and sneak inside to find any food to add to our stock,altough it seemed only a few seconds,he came running very fast but i was so distracted by boredom that almost didn't close the door in time,however before we closed the door we heard something walking on the backyard behind him.

We threw a glowstick to not risk using a flashlight,and just as it got brighter a long thin arm snatched it away and from the sounds it was probably chewing on it,that was more than enough to shut the door and put some long fabrics to cover it all,it seems like it's worse than we thought and our hope was barely standing.

Day 15:we checked the window again,we saw a man wandering in the street only to be caught by something big that passed by flying low...

Day 17:...my roommate has lost hope,he keeps weeping near his bed,crying,i'm afraid i'll be in that state as well.

Day 20:my roommate is gone,he just dissappeared this morning and all i found in his room was the open window...i don't know where he went or if he even is alive but i honeslty won't be able to know. Those things are getting close again and the hunger is starting to get the best of me,well,i'll be turning all the lights now until coast is clear.
