My family has lived in the same town for generations — ever since my grandma was a kid. I was born here too, and when I was little, I loved listening to my grandma’s stories before bed. Especially the scary ones.

One night, she told me about a strange rule in our town.

“When the full moon rises, at exactly 10 PM,” she said, “never knock on the door of the last house down the fifth alley from the village entrance.”

That was it. I begged her to tell me more — what happens if you do? Why? But she wouldn’t say anything else. Just that I should never, *ever* break that rule.

Honestly, I thought it was just one of those creepy stories old people make up. I mean, the house at the end of that fifth alley? That’s where my friend Lewen lives.

Back then, Grandma didn’t like Lewen much. She never showed it to him directly, but she always seemed uneasy about me hanging out with him. I figured she made up that story just to keep me away from him.

After she passed away, I pretty much forgot the whole thing.

Lewen and I went to the same high school and were still part of the same friend group.

Then, one day, Lewen invited me to sleep over at his place.

I was shocked.

I had never been inside Lewen’s house. Not once. I’d tried visiting before when we were kids, but he always said no — usually blaming his parents. This time, though, he invited me first.

I was pumped. I asked if we were heading there straight after school, but he said we had to stop by somewhere first with Jack and Sweller. We were meeting in the afternoon.

Jack and Sweller were already at the meeting spot when I got there. We were just waiting for Lewen. They were super hyped too — probably the first of Lewen’s friends to actually step inside his house. Jack even brought a dirty magazine to hide in Lewen’s room as a prank.

Lewen showed up shortly after, and we headed into town. He said there was a place we needed to go first.

Turned out it was just some random antique shop.  
We were like, *“Seriously? This is it?”*

No girls with us or anything. Kind of lame.  
But Lewen just ignored us and started searching through the shelves like he was looking for something specific.

We browsed around for a bit. Then he finally picked something, paid, and said, “Let’s head home.”

It was around 8 PM when we got to his house, if I remember right.

We walked in, expecting to greet his parents — but no one was home.  
He said they were out of town, which is why he could finally invite us over.

Made sense, I guess. Maybe his parents were the reason we weren’t allowed there before.

Honestly? That just made it better. We ordered a pizza, settled in, and played games on the couch while we waited.

When the pizza came, we scarfed it down and kept gaming for a while.

Eventually, we got bored, and I remembered that thing Lewen bought at the antique shop.

“What’d you buy earlier, anyway?” I asked.

He shrugged. “Nothing important. Don’t worry about it.”

Of course, that just made us *more* curious.

So Jack and Sweller teamed up with me, pushing him to spill the beans.

He glanced somewhere for a moment, then said,

"If you wanna know... wait outside for a bit."

We figured he was setting something up — maybe a surprise? We were the first friends to visit, after all. So we stepped outside, kind of excited.

After a little while, we heard him call out,  
“Alright. It’s ready.”

We reached for the doorknob — but it was locked.

“Hey! Open the door!” we yelled.  
“It’s locked!”

Lewen’s voice came from the other side.  
“Knock.”

So we did.

And the door opened.

Lewen was standing there.
