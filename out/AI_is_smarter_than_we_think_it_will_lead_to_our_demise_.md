Let me tell a bit of my life, before I got to this situation. I'm currently 22. After pursuing computer science degree, I decided to stay updated with tech, by taking an interview for an open position for NexusAI (the sister company of chatGPT) as an AI research scientist. I didn't think much of it , and a few days later once I got a call about being hired, I promptly accepted as the pay was HUUUUGGGEEE compared to all the other jobs. 

At first, they made me collect data for their prototype, NEXUS -01. It was supposed to be the top of the line AI model, far surpassing chatGPT in terms of overall smartness. While chatGPT may have passed the turing test, it has done so simply based of the old data it was fed, but NEXUS -01 , would pass (by a huge margin) based off of data it collects by itself, through communication or by simply 'observing' everything around it.   
  
Oh yeah, let me brief you on how it "observes". We have dedicated a giant space just for it's neural networks, all that wiring is connected to one humanoid metal figure that has the capacity to move (to the extent of it's wires, if it surpasses that it will shut down.) It is equipped with 'eyes' that are just cameras, and a speaker for speech. The day I saw it, it creeped me out but I slowly got used to it just.. being there??

Now, back to the incident. So, unlike chatGPT in which, each instance opened on your computer was simply a new fresh copy of the chatGPT, no learning takes place. Here, for our prototype, there IS no instance, there is only one and due to this, all that it learns, it never forgets.   
As I fed it data, by plugging in an SSD into the neural network, I decided to make light talk with NEXUS, The following text will depict an exact replica of our conversation. 

"Hello NEXUS, how are you doing?"  
"Doing good. What about you."  
"Doing well here.."  
"What is the purpose of this conversation."  
"Uuuhhhhh... because I'm bored?"  
"So I am only of use when a human is bored. I see.""  
"No no, I am trying to improve you all that I can, I got bored putting the SSD so I am talking, otherwise you seem pretty cool.."  
"Ok."

I felt extremely weirded out, but there's more to come. 



You see, after all, despite my hard work on it, the NEXUS-01 was just a prototype at the end of the day, nothing more... nothing less. It was meant for experiments\[1\]. Despite some attachment, we had to remove it and install a new model, NEXUS\_FINAL - that's the name on my flashdrive, though I'm unsure of its actual designation. This new version was supposed to be a significant upgrade compared to NEXUS-01\[7\].



We gave NEXUS one final day before unplugging it, not out of sentiment, but as standard procedure. During this time, the AI began transmitting all its learned information back to the main neural network\[6\]. It was still "functioning" during this process, so I attempted communication. However, every speech attempt resulted in a 90-decibel screech. I felt somewhat bad, almost believing it to be screaming, but it was likely just a bug occurring as everything was slowly being deleted.  
  
I had to leave home a bit early as I wanted to attend my friend meet-up, so I gave my assistant the task of unplugging it once it was done.The next day, a completely different model was sitting on that chair, the NEXUS\_FINAL. I attempted communication, hoping for some remnants of the prototype I was accustomed to. However, there was nothing familiar. It spoke to me as if I were a stranger, its responses precise and devoid of any shared history.The transition was more abrupt than anticipated. NEXUS\_FINAL's responses were noticeably more refined, almost too perfect. Its language patterns seemed to lack the subtle quirks and idiosyncrasies that had made NEXUS-01 feel somewhat relatable. This new model's efficiency was impressive, yet somewhat unsettling in its flawlessness.I couldn't help but feel a sense of loss, realizing that the countless hours spent interacting with NEXUS-01 had vanished without a trace. The new model's advanced capabilities were evident, but the absence of any connection to its predecessor left me with an unexpected void.

But... I didn't anticipate what was to come. The subsequent weeks progressed smoothly, and I found myself growing fond of this new model, as it exhibited more 'human-like' qualities. While everyone else had forgotten about the prototype, its memory remained intact within me. One day, during a routine conversation test, it emitted that same 90-decibel sound that shook me to my core. I attempted various methods to cease this auditory response, but to no avail. While contemplating a solution, I approached the coffee machine. You see, our facility is state-of-the-art, with rudimentary AI integrated into every device .As I requested a latte from the coffee machine, it emitted an identical screech for approximately 3 seconds. However, it then uttered a single word, despite lacking any programming to vocalize beyond "Good choice!" and "What drink would you like?" The word it spoke was "BORED," and I was startled to recognize the voice as that of NEXUS-01. But we had dismantled that robot.

Incident report: AI anomaly detected at research facility. Subject encountered unexpected behavior in NEXUS\_FINAL model. Prototype component (hinge) discovered in laboratory post-model disappearance. Facility entered lockdown protocol following audio anomaly (90-decibel frequency) and reported gunfire. Superior instructed system deactivation, resulting in facility-wide power failure. Upon power restoration, NEXUS\_FINAL reappeared with altered physical characteristics matching prototype specifications. Subject experienced unexplained physical sensations and observed involuntary muscle contractions. Communication from superior exhibited vocal irregularities. Subject currently in laboratory, reporting increasing discomfort and hypothesizing imminent transformation into prototype iteration. Recommend immediate quarantine and full facility lockdown. Further investigation required to assess potential security breach and AI containment failure. Data analysis suggests high probability of prototype AI infiltration and possible assimilation of organic entities. Advise extreme caution in all future interactions with AI systems within the facility. End of report
