I’ve never liked spiders.  It’s not their fault, objectively I know that.  But when I see them, the eight shiny legs darting perfectly along a nearly invisible thread, grabbing and wrapping their prey… it frightens me.  I can only imagine myself as that prey, watching helplessly as a black silhouette emerges from the darkness to grab me, wrap me up, and slowly consume me.

Other invertebrates never evoked the same reaction.  I don’t like getting stung by bees, but overall I enjoy watching them hover from flower to flower, with their cheery colors.  Flies are an annoyance, crickets a welcome song in the night.

When I noticed the chaotic, strong web on my front porch, I wasn’t thrilled.  I cleared it with a broom, the whole time checking little cracks in the siding or behind our wooden bench for a creeping culprit.  I couldn’t find it.  As little as I liked that fact, it was outside, and there would always be spiders outside, so I went about my business.

The next morning, I was locking the door on my way to work, juggling my lunch and my coffee and my coat.  Under the bench, the web was back.  In a hurry to get to my car, I likely wouldn’t have noticed the translucent threads spanning from the seat of the bench down to the floorboards, except for one thing:  there was a mouse caught there.

It was dead, upside down, and mostly wrapped in a white silk.  The limbs were pinned to its sides, almost like a straight jacket.  The eyes were wide with terror and glazed over, staring blankly at the wooden planks beneath it.

To kill a mouse, it must have been a sizable spider.  My nose wrinkled in disgust at the thought of it, but I had to go to work.  The spider would have to wait.

The sun was setting as I returned, and the poor little mouse’s corpse was in the same place.  I swept it into a waste bin with a broom, and cleared the rest of the web.  Still, I couldn’t find the spider.  I tentatively flipped the cushion on the bench, expecting to see it staring back at me.  There was nothing.  The other nooks and crannies were all empty too, even the eaves of the porch were unoccupied.

Along two of the upright beams holding the roof, I found another spider’s web, with just a few midges adorning the concentric circles of silk.  An orange orb weaver sat right in the middle, with little hairs sticking out of her legs.  I knocked the spider and web onto the ground with my broom, and smacked the spider hard with it.  She didn’t die, but was dragging herself, with some of her legs sticking at odd angles.  They could still get around pretty well with three or more legs, I’d noticed.

I hit her again, which did the job, and swept her into the bin.  I didn’t want to just leave it there, since some spiders can be dangerous, and I didn’t know them well.

Moving on to my other tasks, I made dinner, did the laundry, and watched a show before bed.  My life is far from exciting, I’ll admit.  I’d finally gotten a promotion at work, and was putting pretty much all of my effort into the marketing company.  All of my peers did the same.

The spider evaded my attention for several days.  I thought about other things, like a normal, healthy person might.  It was only that weekend, when I went to rake leaves in the yard that it crawled up to the front of my mind.

There was something stuck on the outside of my chimney.  I thought it was a black trash bag.  The clouds backlit the shape, making it hard to see any details.  Only after taking a few steps did I recognize it as a crow.  A wing stuck out at an odd angle, while the rest of the body was cross-crossed with dull white lines, which suspended it in the air.

I gasped, realizing this bird had been caught by my spider.  I’d heard of small birds getting eaten, as well as mice.  Was it possible for one to catch a crow?

As soon as my shock wore off, I began looking for it.  The idea that a huge spider could be above me was unsettling, to say the least.  Eventually, I gathered the courage to poke at the corpse of the bird.  I half expected the spider to emerge from behind, to jump down on me.  It looked like there was nothing there.

This was beyond the pale for me, and I went inside to call an exterminator.  I left the bird up, figuring no one would believe me without evidence.  I called around and found someone who could be there in the afternoon.

What I had hoped to be a relaxing Saturday was anything but, as I wondered where the spider was hiding.  If it could kill a crow, I imagined the thing must have been the size of a tarantula.  Didn’t they normally stay near their webs?  It would need to be a large crevice or nook of some sort.

The chimney.

As soon as I thought it, I couldn’t think of anything else.

I ran to my living room.  There was supposed to be some kind of mesh to exclude birds and bats, wasn’t there? I hadn’t checked it since I moved in.  Also, I thought that I had the flu closed, but there was no way to know if that would stop a spider.

From a cabinet, I grabbed a long lighter, lighter fluid, and an empty cardboard box from a delivery the day before.  I threw the box in, drenched it in lighter fluid, and opened the flue.

When I put the lighter into the fireplace, here was a fireball which singed the hair from my hand.  It poured out of the glass doors, as I desperately tried to close them.  Within a moment the fire calmed down to a conventional blaze, and I ran outside.

I couldn’t see anything crawling out of the metal pipe atop the bricks.  There was a significant amount of smoke, and I was sure that no spider could have survived inside the chimney.  Confident that the spider wasn’t in there, or wasn’t alive if it was, I returned inside to wait for the exterminator.

He arrived with a smile, but his jaw dropped when I showed him the crow.  Soon his shock was replaced with a sort of excitement, and he asked to take pictures.  I agreed, and he began to snap away gleefully from his ladder.

He hypothesized it might be a joro spider, a large invasive species known for living in treetops.  He’d never seen one himself, but that was his best guess.  Since the spider was nowhere to be found, he offered to do what was called a “barrier spray”.  I accepted, hoping it would be effective.

With a backpack sprayer, he pretty much coated the outside of my house with pesticide, and a few feet of ground around it.  Over the next few days I noticed dead moths under the lamps, dead bees on the sidewalk, but no dead spider.  By the following week there were no more webs, and my mind was on work rather than the spider.

I was asleep in bed when a screaming woke me.  In a stupor for a few seconds, I thought it might be a person, but that didn’t match the sound.  It was a desperate screeching noise, and I wondered if it could be a pig or an owl.  Looking into the yard, I saw some sort of commotion in a bush, and grabbed a proper flashlight before going to investigate.

The leaves of the bush rustled, but the screaming had stopped.  Approaching cautiously, I shone the light into the branches, unsure of what I would find.

It was a rabbit.  I’d forgotten that they could be very loud, if they were being hurt.

There was no fox, no coyote in the bush.  The rabbit was kicking weakly, and I saw the silver shine of the threads at the same time I saw a black, shiny form scurry away into the dark foliage.  With the shadows of leaves and branches from my flashlight, it was impossible to make out how big it was exactly, but the bulky, jet black abdomen had been at least the size of my fist.

I ran back into my house.  I locked the door, as silly as that might sound.  My heart was racing.  I tried to look up every spider I could, but found nothing even remotely similar.  There was the Goliath bird eater in South America, but it still wasn’t big enough.  Besides that, it was covered in thick brown hair, not the shining black carapace I saw with my flashlight.  The spider I had seen reminded me of nothing more than an enormous black widow.

Afraid that I was going insane, I went back to the bush in the morning.  The rabbit was gone, as was the web.  With my broom handle, I poked at the bushes tentatively, afraid that at any point it could jump out at me, or that it would grab and pull the broom.

At this point, I needed evidence of it.  I wanted to send the webbing to a university or something, to see if they could figure out what it was.

As much as I looked, I couldn’t find any.  Nor could I find the rabbit.  Looking closely, I could see where the rabbit had kicked at the leaves on the soft ground under the bush, before it had been subdued.  I took a picture of that, at least.  Anything was better than nothing, I figured.  I also reached out to the pest control company, to try and get the pictures the man had taken of the crow.  They said he was servicing several other houses, but got my email so that he could send them to me at the end of the day.

I posted them on a forum, which got some attention.  Most people said that it must have been fishing line rather than spider web, or something of that nature.  The mystery spider was quickly becoming an obsession of mine.  Why would I be the person to see the largest spider ever recorded?  What cruel twist of fate would give that unwanted honor to me?

Before going to bed, I had several drinks.  I normally don’t drink much, especially if I have work.  However, one side effect of drinking is that I usually don’t have dreams.  I was afraid of what my dreams would be, and figured that even poor sleep was better than nightmares.

I was annoyed awaking that night, having to pee.  It was windy, with branches rustling against the house.

Pulling the blankets back, I paused in confusion.  All at once, the wind had stopped.  I looked out the window, and screamed.

It had not been branches tapping at my window, but the long, black legs of the spider.  Each one was the length of my forearm and hand, about as big around as a finger.  It was upside down, facing my window sill.  Hanging motionless since I had awoken, I couldn’t fight the feeling that the tapping I’d heard for several minutes was the spider’s long legs scratching at my window, trying to open it.

Unsure what to do, I stood, and the monstrosity scurried away out of sight, with a sound like pebbles being thrown at the glass.

I kept a baseball bat near my front door, and ran down the stairs to get it.  Flipping on the lights, I contemplated calling 911, but what would I say?  Would they send someone for what sounded like a bad dream?

Holding the bat firmly in my hand, I went all around the house turning on every indoor and outdoor light.  I looked through the windows with a frightened caution.  Could this thing break a window?  I knew that invertebrates tended to be disproportionately strong for their size.  It was only when I went to the front door that I finally saw it.

Hanging in the air in front of my porch light, the silhouette of it was a nightmare broken up by the cut glass of the decorative window in my front door.  Rushing to a nearby curtained window to see better, I saw it climb precisely along a colossal thread, disappearing up over the porch eaves.

Skin crawling with fear, I dialled 911.  When the operator answered, I said that I thought someone was trying to break into my house, and that I’d seen them on my porch.  They said a police officer would be there in about ten minutes, and to lock myself in my bedroom.

I didn’t go to the bedroom.  There were better lights down here, and the spider had gone up the last I’d seen.  Holding the curtain back from the window, I stared at the eaves intensely, for any movement.

By the time I saw it, four of the shining, black legs were already curling down from the roof, deftly holding the wooden boards.  Slowly, carefully, the head appeared in the light.  I couldn’t see the outline of the spider in the darkness, the bright porch light made shining reflections off of the finger sized fangs and eight perfectly spherical eyes.

With a mechanical precision, the legs began to pull at the web, the weight of the spider causing even the strong silk to sag noticeably.  The fangs began to work up and down independently as the legs one by one pulled in toward the mouth, gathering the silk there.

It was eating the web.  Efficiently, methodically, it was eating all of the strands criss-crossing my porch which it had hung from a minute before.  By the time the police got here there would be nothing left, and I would look like a lunatic.

It was still next to the roof.  I knew it was fast, but it had limits.  Unbolting the door, I cracked it open.  I needed a piece of the silk, or no one would believe me, and I would be left to face this thing alone.  The spider froze, staring straight at me.

Once, I watched a documentary on spiders, as difficult as it was for me.  Some of them showed surprising intelligence, especially considering how small they were.  Looking into the shining black voids that were its eyes, I couldn’t help but feel an intelligence there.  It had tried to open my window, from the sill, in the correct direction.  It had cast a web where it saw me enter and leave the house.  And now, it was destroying the evidence of its existence.  I knew that it was.

With the bat in one hand and the broom in the other, I took a swipe at the remaining web with the broom, hoping that some of it would stick, that I could pull the broom back into the house, and have proof that I wasn’t imagining everything.  When the broom hit the web it stuck, and I yanked as hard as I could.  The broom moved about a foot as if it was on a piece of elastic, then began to pull back into place.

The spider rushed at me, a flurry of legs descending from the beams of the ceiling.  I tried to close the door, but the broom handle was stuck there.  I tried to kick it out, but the spider was moving so fast I was forced to grab the door handle with both hands and pull.

The door pulled back against my grip.

This spider was unimaginably strong, and it was taking all of my strength to keep the door from opening.  Black legs curled around the open edge of the door, on both sides of my hand.  Through the widening crack, I saw the face and the fangs, dangerously close to my hand.  But I *could not* let go of the handle, I knew that.

I used to play tug of war as a kid.  This was nothing like that.  If you’ve ever played tug of war with a large dog, you might know the fierce pull they can exert with a jerk using their whole body, which can dislodge your grip.

This was something like that, but unimaginably faster.  The door jarred open two to three inches in an instant, and before I could react I had a photographic image of the fangs extending, their fine points burying into the skin of the back of my hand, the hateful eyes staring at me with an empty darkness before disappearing back through the door, along with the legs.  With the door opening just a little more, the broom handle had fallen free, and I pulled with all my strength, slamming the heavy wood closed, bolting and locking it instantly.

Blood dripped from two circular wounds in my hand, near my pinky.  They were separated by more than an inch, and looked like they might have nearly gone completely through the soft tissue in between the bones of my pinky and ring finger.  Immediately, I began to feel light headed.  I hoped that it was from the exertion, but when my hand began to go numb, I knew it wasn’t only that.

Soon, my whole right hand was paralyzed, completely useless.  I felt horribly nauseous as the numb tingling feeling worked its way up my arm, rendering it immobile.  I collapsed onto the couch, breathing hard.  Around the white boards of the eaves, those legs once again crept, slow and precise.  The fangs and eyes appeared from the darkness, and watched me keenly through the window.

I looked into them, my heart pounding, and a sinking feeling in my stomach.  The spider descended its web, carefully, and began to eat all of the silk off of the broom, which was hanging in the air.  It fell to the boards beneath with a clatter as the last of the web was consumed, and the spider cleaned up all of the remaining web.  It climbed a post back up, and watched me through the window, half paralyzed on the couch.

Part of me knew that creature would have an easier time catching birds or rabbits.  Deer, even.  It had not attacked me for food, I don’t think.  It had not clawed at my window or set a trap at my door for sustenance.  I didn’t kill spiders because I needed to.  I knew most of them weren’t dangerous, or aggressive.  I killed them *because I didn’t like them*.

Looking at the malice in those eyes, nestled between arm-length legs and gently wiggling fangs, I knew the spider attacked me out of hatred.  As the sirens approached, and blue and red lights flashed from down the block, it withdrew from sight, back into the night, thwarted.

Fighting against the venom, my mind raced.  I couldn’t deny a harsh realization, which made me feel both terror and shame.

That spider had more reason to kill me than I ever had to kill a spider.



The officer knocked on my door, and I managed to open it.  After going to the hospital, I felt ill for a couple of days but recovered well, except for a loss of feeling in my pinky.  I sold the house at a loss, got a transfer at work to another state, and got an apartment.  I couldn’t bring myself to keep living there, or anywhere near.

When I find spiders, I move them outside now.  I bought a vacuum thing specifically designed for that purpose.   I wish that I could say it was out of kindness, but it’s out of self-preservation.
