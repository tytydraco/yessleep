The moment we stepped into B Wing, it hit me like smog in the lungs—thick, stale, and clinging. Collin gave us a final glance, then slipped back into the elevator without a word. The doors closed with a dull chime, and we were alone.

We turned down the hallway and walked toward the steel collapsible gate that sealed off the locked corridor, scratched, rusting, with a heavy chain coiled through its bars like a warning more than a lock. We opened it and went in.

The sound it made—metal dragging against metal—echoed down the empty hall.

The air was… dense. Like walking into a sealed coffin. Thick with dust, but also something sour, something sharp. It smelled like wet wood and rot, and beneath it, faintly, the sweet stench of cheap air freshener.

The hallway was straight out of *The Shining*. Long and narrow, wallpaper peeling at the edges, overhead bulbs flickering. The carpets were wine red and sticky underfoot, as if something had spilled decades ago and never dried.

Each room looked the same: faded bedspreads, cracked mirrors, small televisions bolted into cabinets. The windows were sealed shut, though some still had the curtains drawn, like someone might still be living there.

But nothing moved. No breeze. No hum of pipes. No distant elevator ding.

Just… nothing.

We turned the cameras on anyway.

Filmed ourselves doing dumb commentary, opening closets, pretending to summon ghosts. Nothing happened for the first hour. We had just come out of Room 712.

We’d filmed a dumb bit in there, pretending we were trapped inside, clawing at the door. Just another fake panic sequence for the video. Nothing weird had happened… officially.

But I’d be lying if I said I didn’t feel it.

For one flickering second, while we were inside, I caught a shadow move across the crack under the door. Which made no sense. We’d locked the corridor gate behind us. No one else was up here. No reason for the shadow.

Still, I kept it to myself.

We came out of the room laughing, kinda hyped about how the footage turned out. Jack was scrolling through the playback on his camera, mumbling about sound design, when Jim stopped walking.

“Hey… that clock’s stuck,” he said, pointing to a dusty old wall clock at the far end of the hallway.

He walked up and tapped the glass. “Says 2:37. Weird—it was working when we walked in, right?”

Jack glanced at his phone. “Hold up… let me check.”

His smile flickered.

“…Mine says 2:37 too.”

I pulled my wrist up. Watch: 2:37. Seconds frozen. No ticking. No movement.

Lee didn’t say anything. Just opened the nearest door—Room 710, I think—and stepped inside. We heard the rustle of drawers, then his voice:

“Guys… the digital clock in here? It’s frozen too. 2:37 AM. Mid-blink.”

Everything had stopped.

Time.

Movement.

Rhythm.

Everything—

Except for us.

I tried to cut through the rising tension with a nervous laugh.

“Okay, so… is this, like, some elaborate prank by Collin? Or are we finally tapping into something real here—like actual *spooky* spooky?”

The laugh that followed was mine, but it came out dry. Hollow. Even I didn’t believe it.

Lee was still standing by the drawer, holding the frozen digital clock like he was waiting for it to start ticking again. He hadn’t moved in a while. Like the silence was pressing too hard on him.

That’s when Jack’s voice cut through the quiet.

“Uh… guys?”

We all turned.

He was staring at the window.

It was supposed to overlook the street below—give us a view of empty asphalt and flickering streetlamps. But now?

It reflected the room.

Perfectly.

Only it wasn’t a normal reflection. Not like a mirror. More like… a live feed. A camera turned back on us. The layout was wrong—the bed was on the left in our room, but in the window, it was on the right. Our positions were flipped. The image didn’t *mirror*—it mimicked.

And that wasn’t the worst part.

The versions of us in the window weren’t facing us.

They had their backs turned. Four figures, four backs. All staring into the room from the same spot we were in, just standing there. Still.

A sudden *clack* came from behind me. I spun around.

Lee had dropped the clock. And in that exact moment, *my* reflection in the window turned around. Jack and Jim gasped. I caught their eyes, wide and horrified, as they looked back toward the glass.

“What?” I asked. “What did you see?”

Neither answered. But Jim stepped back slowly. And Jack moved forward.

“What the actual fuck is this…” I muttered, heart racing. “Are we… seeing into some kind of parallel room?”

Jack didn’t answer. He stepped forward, reached for the latch, and slid the window open.

On the other side—just a narrow, dust-choked balcony. No second room. No mirror dimension. Just concrete and rusted railing.

Jack stepped through, scanned the space, then came back inside. Closed the window.

The moment it shut, the reflection returned to normal.

This time, it mirrored us correctly. Four shaken faces staring back. Paler. Sweat-slicked.

We stood there, staring at our own face. And we decided we weren’t waiting until 4. We needed to leave. Right then.

We tried. Leaving. But the building didn’t let us.

The steel collapsible gate was gone. Erased. In its place were new paths—hallways that branched off at unnatural angles, stairwells that shouldn’t have been there, and an elevator that showed up where the wall had been. Somehow every hallway folded back into itself. Walk five doors down, make a turn—same goddamn stretch. Same four doors. Same peeling wallpaper curling at the corners like dried skin. Same scorched lamp at the bend, flickering like it was short-circuiting in slow motion.

At some point, we split up. Just to test it. Lee went left, Jim went right, Jack kept walking straight, and I doubled back. Five minutes later, we all ended up in the same place.

The lobby now wasn’t just a rectangle. It curved. Bent in on itself like a snake coiling into a loop. We were trapped in a Möbius strip. Even the elevator, no matter what floor we pressed, opened up to the same hallway.

Every. Fucking. Time.

I panicked. Took the stairs. Ran down six floors, feet slamming against the cold concrete, breath ragged in my throat. I hit the door for the ground level. Opened it.

Seventh floor. Same hallway. Same flickering light. And down the corridor, maybe ten feet ahead of me… I saw myself.

Walking away.

Not a reflection. Not a trick of the light. Me. From behind. I stood frozen. My stomach flipped, hard. Nausea crawled up my throat. I staggered backward.

Lee was sitting on the floor now, hugging his knees, face drained and twitching. Jim was crouched beside him, whispering something, voice cracking.

Then the walls moved. Actually moved. The lobby shuddered—like the whole floor had inhaled sharply. The corners bent, stretched, twisted like melting wax. The red carpet slithered beneath my feet, pulsing. Shifting. It was *moving*.

And that smell—God, the smell—hit us like a punch to the lungs.

Burnt flesh. Oily, wet meat. Something *wrong* on fire. I couldn’t breathe. We had to hide. Something was coming. Jack reached out and yanked open the nearest door. I didn’t even check the number. We shoved Lee inside, followed fast, and slammed the door shut behind us. But just before I turned the handle—

I looked back. The elevator had opened. And from it, shadowy figures stepped out. Not walking but *Sliding*. No faces. Just outlines. And they were heading our way.
