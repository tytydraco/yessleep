Yesterday was my 15th birthday. Since my mom allowed me to stay home, I was excited for the day that was ahead of me. My Father would've also been a month sober yesterday. It isn't an incredibly long time, but we were so proud of him for quitting cold turkey. We don't like Father when he's drunk. He gets cruel. 

To commemorate these two events, we all planned to go to dinner last night at a nice restaurant; Mom, Father, Cora and I. Everything was going amazingly, but when I woke up in the morning, I found a strange note on my bedside table. Wiping the sleep from my groggy eyes, I blithely peeled the note from the table and got to reading.

"Happy birthday, Lia. I'm so sorry that you have to spend your special day like this, but I have to cut straight to the chase. You're not safe. At least, you're not safe while you're in the house. You must listen VERY carefully to what's written here. PLEASE I BEG OF YOU.

Your Father got laid off of his job yesterday. He wouldn't tell me how or why. But, he started drinking, very, VERY heavily because of it. You know how he gets when he's drunk. You're not safe while you're in the same house of him. You have to get out before he gets to you. Please heed these rules. It's the only way you'll make it out unharmed.

1. Don't look for me. By the time you're reading this note, I'm already gone. I'm sorry that I didn't have the chance to get you and Cora, but there was no other choice.

2. As you know, Cora will come home at 14:50. No matter what, don't try to save her. It sounds cruel, but there's nothing you can do to help her, you'll only get hurt along with her. She'll scream out for you, but don't respond. Wait until the thrashing and squealing stops before proceeding.

3. DON'T MAKE ANY NOISE. If you do make noise, your Father will walk up the stairs and come into your room. You don't want him in your room.

3a. In the case you do, for whatever reason, make a noise, HIDE UNDER YOUR BED IMMEDIATELY. He won't be able to reach you under there. Don't come out until you hear him walk back down the stairs. DON'T TRY TO ATTACK HIM. Cora's a fighter, so your Father will be disoriented, but don't think that you can overpower him. You can't. 

3b. If you're unable to hide underneath your bed in time, I'm so sorry, baby. It'll be extremely painful, but it'll be over before you know it.

4. Don't jump out your window. You'll be right in front of the screen door when you fall, and your Father will see you. It'll be hard to run with twisted ankles.

4a. If your window is closed, do not open your window for any reason. Refer to rule 9a.

5. Don't go downstairs for ANY REASON. Your Father's threats are completely empty. He won't be able to harm you if you don't follow his voice.

6. Don't use your phone to make any calls unless you've successfully escaped. If you use your phone in the house, refer to 3a.

7. Your Father should be on the TV watching a sports game. You have a higher chance of escaping when he's distracted by it. If the TV is on any other channel, don't move. He's listening for your movement.

7a. If he's paused the TV entirely, he's looking for you. Refer to rules 3 and 3a.

8. Keeping all of the previous rules in mind, slowly and silently head to me and your Father's room. Close the door and lock it behind you. It'll buy you a few seconds if you're too loud. However, you must be very careful once you're here. You will not be able to hide in time.

9. The window in the bedroom should already be open. If it's not, DO NOT OPEN IT. Refer to rule 9b.

9a. All of the openings in our house are alarmed. Always remember that.

9b. Go to the upstairs bathroom, close the door and pray. I'm so sorry, but there's nothing I can do for you. If he leaves the house, you're safe to go. If he finds you, don't resist. It'll only make it worse.

10. If the window is open, there should be a latter right outside of it. This is how I escaped. VERY CAREFULLY, AS TO NOT MAKE A SOUND, climb down the latter. Once you're down, run. Only then can you call the police. Your Father will be on the other side of the house, so he won't hear you.

10a. You may see Cora's body on the yard while you're running. She may look alive, but she's already dead. DO NOT GO NEAR HER.

11. Go straight to the neighbor's house and tell them your predicament. They will immediately let you in and keep you safe.

I am so, so sorry Lia. I'm sorry for all of this. Cora's in a much better place now, and I will find you, no matter what it takes. Your Father will not harm us anymore. I love you so, so, so, so much. Happy 15th birthday."
