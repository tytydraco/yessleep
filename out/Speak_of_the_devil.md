I woke up, slowly trying to open my eyes. They were shut closed from the blood drying up on my face. My head was hurting, I slowly started remembering the nightmare I was in.  My hands were tied behind my back. Whatever they were tied with was itchy and felt like needles sticking in my wrists every time I tried to loosen my hands free.  It smelled like burnt hair and plastic, and I could hear that I wasn't alone. 

I was able to unglue one of my eyes slightly open. The sweat from my forehead dripped down enough to re-moisten the dry blood that had my eyes glued shut.  The saltiness of my sweat burning my face from what felt like a bunch of open wounds. The burning hair and burnt plastic smoke I was inhaling was staring to burn my throat everytime I inhaled.

 I would hear loud hollow thuds and what I can only describe as something sobbing but out of breath. It ⁰⁰was getting louder as the sobbing grew quieter and muffled. Then I heard a demented laughter in approval of itself. The cackling laughter sounded like a guttural hyena laughing through its cancerous throat. Hacking up its vile mucus after each overdrawn hackle. I gasped loudly when I was able to make out that I had been in this dungeon like prison before. 

The vile creature must have heard my gasp as it slowly approached where I was sitting. It walked around the support beam  I was bound to. As it crawled up on all fours, just inches away from my face.  It took deep breaths, smelling at my head wound as I felt it licking at my deep gash just over my forehead. Licking at my wound it grew desperate as he reopened up my injury. 

The warm blood started dripping down my face again. The beast now stepping back as if it was  angry that I once again bled crawled back behind me to whatever had its attention before. Then I heard it rip through what was no longer wailing in pain.  The sound of flesh tearing, bones snapping and breaking as its hyena like cackling now turned into a low guttural moan. I was finally able to open both eyes as the bloody sweat again remoisturized the blood that had my eyes glued shut. 

The  sounds wet chunks of flesh hitting the ground in a hellish crescendo. Finally able to pull my hands free I slowly crawled to where the entrance to this prison stood. I pulled myself closer and closer to the way out of this hell feeling confident as I heard the beast busy with the destruction of its prey. I tried to get up. 

Slowly and painfully I was able to stand on my own feet. Hobbling to the exit I heard the creatures footsteps running up. I tried to run but was unsuccessful and I ended up falling back to the floor. I heard the beasts mournful cries as I slowly turned to face whatever was now standing over me.  It dropped what was once a human head in front of me. Nudging it closer to me with its head.  As if it was showing me. It seemed to be seeking approval. 

 It's shallow breathing grew slower and quieter until it was a light steady  wheezing. I looked at its face. It's sad eyes looked human, but the bloody bandages covering most of its head showed otherwise. It stood before me prideful, as it stepped on the human head it brought before me. Then it all came back to me. This prison wasn't a prison. It was the celler underneath my home. I had been overpowered by one of the captives who had managed to undo his restraints. Beating me over the head and bringing me down to the cellar tieing me to one of the beams used to support the floor up above.

  He would of killed me.  As he has witnessed my rage and brutal outbursts. I have done things that God will not forgive me for. I have killed many in front of him since his arrival here.  I was going to destroy him eventually but he got free  over powered me and tied me down in the cellar. He made one mistake. In the cellar is the reason why I have to keep picking up unsuspecting strangers. Because in the cellar is where I keep and feed my familiar.
