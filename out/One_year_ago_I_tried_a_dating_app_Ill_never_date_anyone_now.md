One year ago, when I just turned 18, I decided to download a dating app.

I have been single my entire life, and thought the only way for me to meet the man of my dreams would be throught an app like that, cause I don't get oustide of my house a lot. The only times I do, its for school, and I'm pretty sure if you'd ask about me to one of my classmates, they'd say ''who?''. So I gave myself a pretty nice profil, and that's when I got my first match; Ethan.

6'2, 29, big blue eyes, dark brown hair, pretty fit, cute face: the man of my dreams.

He texted me first, and after a few chats, I knew he was the one. Apparently never had a girlfriend and he had an awesome personality.

We went on our first date at this fine food place, and we had a really good time. He made me laugh, smile, complimented me... The perfect first date. As he was driving me back home, he told me that he had a tendency to rush things, and that if he seemed too foward, I should tell him right away. It got a bit quiet, so I turned on the radio.

*'' Another woman was recently found dead in the neighborhoods forest. Her throat had been brutally mutilated and her feet to her ankles were not found on her corpse. The suspect has yet to be identified. Any who would have a lead on him is deman-''*

That's when he turned it off. ''A bit depressing'', he said.

After the first date was a second one, then a third, then a fourth. That's when he asked me to go to his place. I accepted, of course. He had his own apartment, unlike me still living at my parents place, so it was just the both us of.

It started off great. Squeezed in his arms, rubbing my feet, with a bucket of popcorn on our laps and a good movie playing on the TV. He then grabbed my face and pulled it towards his. I stopped his lips from touching mine by blocking it with my hand. I apologized, and told him he was being a bit quick for me.

He screamed. Throwed the bucket of popcorn in my face. Smashed the TV remote on the floor. And fell on the ground.

Silence.

He starts crying.

''I messed it up. Again! Now you think I raped you, you'll make a complaint, I'll get caught-''

I stop him and tell him none of it is true.

We're back in his car, driving me back home. I watched the few stars showing in the sky, without giving him directions. He knew the way by heart now. Still, he turned at the wrong intersection.

I whispered it.

''What'd'you say now?''

I repeated a bit louder.

''...''

Silence.

''Oh, you're right. There's a dead-end street a bit further. I'll turned back there.''

He turned right. Left. Srtaight. Right. Stopped.

Around us were only trees now. I asked him why he stopped.

''No gas left. Shit. I'll get the gas in my strunk. Stay still.''

He unlocked his door and got out. I looked at my phone; 23h35. I texted my mom, telling her I'll be getting back later than I was supposed to. ''Not delivered''. I had no wifi-signal. He's not getting back in the car. I thought about calling a roadside assistance, but I didn't know the number and couldn't look online. So I called 911.

''*Hello 911, what's your emergency*?''

I explained to the responder.

'*'I have your localisation*.''

Silence.

''*Miss, lock the doors of the car your in right now*.''

So I did.

''*Do not let the man you're with get inside the car, am I clear?*''

I understood. I did even more when I looked at the drivers side. The tank was full.

Ethan knocked on my side. Smilling. But not like he usually did. He tried to open the locked door. The smile vanished.

''*Police will soon be with you miss.*''

He looked at my phone, and stared in my eyes. He walked away, in that forest. With a knife and rope along with him. The dark of the trees soon made him unable to perceive.

He was found later that night. He cut his own throat with the knife he held.

I wonder what I would be right now if I knew the roadside assistance number.
