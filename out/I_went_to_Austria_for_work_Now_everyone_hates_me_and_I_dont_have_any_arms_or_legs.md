The doctor tells me I don’t have long to live. Without any arms or legs, it’s just a matter of time before my body completely shuts down. To be honest, I’m barely even listening. My eyes are closed, too, but from just the sound of his voice I can tell – he’s one of *them*. I try to distract myself, think happier thoughts, but I can’t get it out of my head – he’s one of *them*, he’s one of *them*, he’s one of *them*!!

My mouth starts to quiver. “W-w-w-w-w…”

*This is it,* I think to myself, but I manage to hold on just long enough. The doctor finally leaves. I can open my eyes now.

I guess I should explain how I ended up in this situation. I work in the mannequin repair business. Well, maybe “work” isn’t the right word, I’d only been doing it for a few months when my boss came to me with this really great idea. If you know anything about mannequins, you probably know that they’re named after Pierre Mannequin, a French-African inventor and master of games who moved to Austria to set up a workshop where he could create and sell life-sized dolls. These days, the town where he’d settled – it’s called something like Gotenburg or Gratinberg – is where basically all the world’s mannequins are produced. If you go to a Sears over in the States and see a mannequin dressed in people clothes, there’s a very high chance that mannequin came from Austria. Is Sears even still around? I’m not sure, but hopefully you get the idea.

For anybody involved in the world of mannequin repair, Grotenburg is essentially their Mecca. My boss told me that if I was really serious about learning the trade, he would send me over there to work as an apprentice for a guy he knew. I’d spend a year learning everything there is to know about mannequins, and when I returned to the States I would be ready to handle any problem that came my way. Hell, if I really wanted to I’d probably even be able to make mannequins of my own. It seemed like the perfect way for a youngster like me to get their foot in the door of the mannequin world, so naturally I agreed to go to Austria. I’d never left the States before, so I was obviously a little nervous. Well, unless you count Canada, but nobody really counts Canada. I’d learned a little German in high school but I’d cheated on all my exams, so from a practical standpoint I didn’t actually know any German. My boss told me that the man I’d be working with was fluent in both English and German and that he would be able to help me sort out any problems I ran into. Did that make me feel better? Not really, if we’re going to be honest. Still, I’d already set my heart on going to Austria, and where the heart goes the body must follow.

I spent my first few days in Grotleborg getting used to the new locale. I won’t lie, it really wasn’t that different from where I lived back in the States, which makes me wonder why Euros and Americans always get into such huge fights online. The buildings were older and there were fewer McDonald’s, but otherwise the two places were pretty much the same. I guess there was another difference – everyone was really civil towards each other, way more so than in the States. In the States, well, you’ve got your rowdies that like to cause trouble, and you’re always kind of afraid that if you get into an argument with some random guy on the street they’ll pull a gun and shoot you. No, nothing like that in Groveburg. I suppose it was a little strange, really. From browsing sites like Reddit you really get the idea that Europeans are huge xenophobes. Any time the Romani people are mentioned they fire off into these racial tirades about how awful they are and how it’s okay to discriminate against them and blah blah blah. I just don’t understand how you can say such hateful things about other people. For what it’s worth, I watched Snatch when I was a kid and thought it was really funny. Anyway, my point is that I was expecting everything to be sort of segregated but it wasn’t like that at all. The Austrians intermingled with the Romani, who were friends with the Africans, who went to church with the one Korean in town, and everyone always had a big smile on their face. It was beautiful if you ask me.

While we’re on the subject of things you don’t see in the States, there were also the mannequins. They were everywhere, dressed in all sorts of fanciful outfits and posed in equally fanciful ways. You could really tell how much the townspeople freakin’ loved mannequins. At any café or restaurant you went to there would be a table set aside just for the mannequins, they were on the streets, they were in the stores browsing the wares, there was even one in my apartment sitting in the corner. It was there when I moved in and it felt a little rude to disturb it, so I just left it like that.

My work was engaging in a way I’d never experienced before. I worked for a man named Gustavo who had renounced his last name when he’d moved to Austria. While he wasn’t quite at the level of the Old Masters, he knew far more about mannequins than anybody in the States probably did. Every day, broken mannequins from across the country would arrive at his workshop and he would repair them. Arm replacements, leg replacements, head replacements, all of these were trivial to him. He could do a full-limb replacement in under ten minutes without leaving any scratches or scorch marks. When he wasn’t doing repairs, he was building mannequins of his own. This was where I really got a chance to see something special. You might think that making a mannequin is a pretty simple process, but if you thought that you would be completely wrong. You would be so wrong that it would be a little embarrassing. Constructing the molds, mixing the resin, implanting the pig heart, securing the joints, Gustavo did all of these things on his own and the end result was truly beautiful. The final step was always the consecration. Gustavo had a jar filled with ashes taken from Pierre Mannequin’s body, and after building each mannequin he sprinkled some of the ashes onto its face. This was something that all the mannequin crafters in Grotenberg did – partially out of respect for the man, but also because it had been something he’d specifically requested in his will. Pierre had been a big guy, so there were plenty of ashes to go around. Once they’d been consecrated, I could swear there was a little smile on each mannequin’s face.

So, that was the way things continued for a while. One thing I just couldn’t get used to was the food. Austrian food is a lot like German food, which is to say that it’s fine to eat once every few months but if it’s what you’re eating every day you’ll probably want to kill yourself. It’s way too heavy and it all starts to taste the same a lot sooner than you’d think. Here’s one kind of sausage, here’s another kind of sausage, here’s a third kind of sausage. Here are potatoes, here are potatoes prepared a different way, here are potatoes prepared another different way. Some days you don’t want to eat sausage and potatoes, I’m sorry but that’s just the truth. Gratleberg isn’t exactly a large town, so I didn’t really have any other options. I started to feel really bloated all the time, so I cut my meals down to one a day, then to once every two days. That mostly solved the issue. Really, that was the only problem I was having those first couple of months. Other than that, everything was going great. I thought I had a bright future in the world of mannequin repair.

Then, I began to see them. I’m talking, of course, about the Italians. As you may or may not know, Austria shares a border with Italy, so it’s no surprise that there’s some movement between the two countries. I, however, did not know that. I mean, I knew Austria was in Europe, but I thought it was, like, close to Finland. The first time was about three months into my stay. I’d been telling Gustavo about my food troubles and in response he’d offered to take me to a restaurant in town that didn’t serve Austrian food. He wouldn’t tell me any other details – I guess he wanted it to be a surprise – but I didn’t think too much of it since I was just excited to eat something other than sausage and potatoes. The next day rolled around and off we went to a part of town I hadn’t seen before. The roads were dark and winding, and a distinct scent hung in the air. It wasn’t until the following day that I realized what that smell was – olive oil. On that day, however, I was still oblivious, still convinced that I was strolling through a quaint Austrian town.

Then, we arrived at the restaurant. The place looked like a cave from the outside. I saw no door, no windows, no signs, just a hole in the wall that seemed to beckon the two of us inside. Gustavo led, and I followed. Down we went through who knows how many flights of stairs, until we finally entered a large, round room lit only by mannequins holding candles. A new smell hit my nose, and this one I recognized immediately. I began to shiver and shake, and I seriously considered just turning around and running the hell out of there. No, I needed to explain the situation to Gustavo, otherwise he’d think there was something wrong with me. I turned towards him but he wasn’t there, rather, he was being escorted to our table by a waiter. The world started to spin as I became totally certain that there was no way I was going to make my way any further into the restaurant. The scent of pizza had become overwhelming, crowding my nose holes and filling my mind with horrible memories of death and destruction. I’d have to explain everything to Gustavo later, but in that moment, for my own mental health, I needed to leave that place. So that’s what I did. I ran up the stairs, pushing through the mannequins, and once I was back on the street I ran some more. I didn’t know where I was going but that didn’t really matter, all I cared about was creating as much distance between myself and that restaurant as I physically could. Gradually the roads began to widen and the smog cleared and at last I found myself standing in front of my apartment. That night, I reluctantly ate a meal of sausage and potatoes.

I want to make it clear that I don’t have anything against Italians. My dad really liked The Godfather and made me watch it with him all the time when I was a kid. I’m told there are three parts to it, but the only one we ever watched was the first one. Still, that one part was enough to implant the seed of total fear within my brain, of Italians killing and breaking and slaughtering anything that gets in their way. It sounds like a joke, to be so afraid of Italians that the mere mention of spaghetti makes you dizzy, but that’s been my reality for the last twenty-odd years. My parents never took it seriously, either, thought it was all some kind of act. It’s gotten worse in the last few years, I’ve developed a nervous tic. When I’m face to face with an Italian I just sort of start *saying things*, uncontrollably, the sorts of things you should never say to an Italian. I promise that I don’t mean any of it, the fear kind of just overwhelms me and, well, that’s what happens. Hopefully you can understand why I reacted the way I did to that pizza place.

Anyway, that’s what I explained to Gustavo. I left out the part about calling Italians hurtful things to their faces because even with context that sounds bad, but I told him everything else. I’m not sure if he really understood it, but he at least seemed sympathetic and apologized for taking me to the restaurant the day before. Still, with that encounter any sense of safety I felt in Gradyberg was already crumbling away. Italians could be anywhere. Well, from what Gustavo told me it sounded like they mostly stayed in the part of town we’d been in earlier, but I knew there was always a chance that I would run into one outside of that awful place. I told myself that I just needed to treat things here like I did in the States. I needed to stay aware of my surroundings and always have an escape route in mind. Yeah, that’s right, because Italians could be anywhere. I couldn’t get the thought out of my head. Italians could be anywhere. Italians could be anywhere! *Italians* could be *anywhere*!

And so, that’s how I lived my life for a while. I was able to find solace in the mannequins, but that specter was always hovering above me, waiting to strike when I would least expect it. There were close calls, for sure. I was out at the market, buying eggs at a reasonable price, when I saw one perusing the wares a few stalls down. I thought there was enough distance between us to be safe, but the next time I looked over in the Italian’s direction he was approaching the egg stall with what I suppose you would call an “Italian stare” plastered across his face. I returned the eggs I’d been looking at and started moving in the opposite direction, but the security guy that was posted there stopped me and started asking questions in German. I must have looked totally tweaked out but I showed him my pockets and opened my bag to show that I wasn’t trying to steal anything. That seemed to convince him and he let me through. I didn’t look back.

Then, one day, Gustavo asked me to make a delivery run to one of his clients. She was an old woman who’d requested a mannequin modeled after her husband, who had died in the war. I wasn’t told which war he’d died in and I felt that it would have been rude to ask, so I didn’t. Instead, I took the mannequin and went off on my way. It was a sunny day and the weather was nice, so I didn’t really mind the walk. It felt good to breathe in the hot summer air. There were no flowers in town, so the pollen allergy that had made my life in the States a living hell was nothing more than a distant memory in Grossenberg. When I reached the client’s house, she greeted me and invited me inside for some tea and sausage. Truth be told I was a little sweaty at that point, so I agreed to her offer. I set the mannequin down at the entryway, then followed the lady to the kitchen, which was at the back of the house. We chatted about nothing in particular as she prepared the tea and boiled the sausage. After I’d finally eaten the sausage I was feeling a little bloated and decided that it would be better if I took a short rest before heading back to Gustavo’s workshop. The woman told me that I was free to stay as long as I wanted because, after all, she enjoyed having company around. I was about to thank her for being so nice to someone like me when there was a sudden knock at the door and she disappeared to answer it. I looked around the kitchen, which was covered with mannequins. They all looked similar to the one Gustavo had made for her. I guess she really liked her husband.

A few minutes later she appeared with a man who looked like he was around my age. No, that’s not what was important. Even just thinking back on it, I…

Through the haze I could hear her introducing him. “This young man is a friend of my son! His name is Flavio.”

I wanted to get out of that chair and run far away, but I couldn’t. The sausage had left me too bloated to move, and all I could do was sit there and stare at Flavio with sweat dripping down my face and body. I tried to say something, a “Nice to meet you!” or something like that, but I couldn’t force it out. No, something else came out. I tried to hold it back, I did, but I couldn’t. The sounds began to leak out.

“W-w-w-w-w-w…”

And then, I said it. The most horrible word you can say to any Italian, I said it. I’m talking about the one that rhymes with “mop”. I said it, and then I blinked, and then suddenly I was somewhere else entirely. I don’t mean that in a mental sense – I physically wasn’t in the old lady’s house anymore. All around me I could hear the sound of crackling fire, but it was completely dark save for a faint light up ahead. I began to make my way forward, yet no matter how far I walked that light never seemed to get any closer.

Then, I nearly tripped over something, and as I did the area was suddenly illuminated. I looked down and saw a goat and immediately felt kind of bad. I’ve always liked goats and I totally hadn’t run into this one on purpose. I was startled, then, as the goat began to speak in a loud, booming voice. I had committed a grave crime, it said, and as punishment I would have to play a game. Before I could respond, the goat’s body began to twist and turn as it stood up on its hind legs and assumed a vaguely human form. It was still a goat with fur and hooves and horns, but it had human proportions, is what I’m trying to say.

The goat spoke again. “DO YOU KNOW THE RULES OF ‘TWISTER’?”

Twister? I looked down at the ground and realized that we were standing on a vast polka-dotted mat that seemed to extend, forever, into the darkness that surrounded us. All I could think to do was nod my head.

“VERY WELL. IF YOU WIN, YOU ARE FREE TO LEAVE THIS PLACE. IF I WIN, I WILL TAKE A LIMB.”

To tell you the truth, I just felt confused. A minute ago I’d been sitting in that old lady’s house, and now I was, uh, here. I wondered if I’d had an aneurysm or passed out or something like that. Of course, the fact that I was thinking that basically meant it wasn’t a dream. You never *actually* think “Hmm, this might be a dream” when you’re in a dream. That’s only something you do when you’re awake. Maybe I’d ingested some type of powder or something.

There was a loud gong and a wheel appeared above our heads. My feet, it seemed, were already at the proper positions. The goat made a sound like a scream or a groan, and then the wheel spun. Around and around it went, slowing gradually as wheels tend to do, and then it stopped. Left foot red, simple enough. I shifted my foot over. When I looked up to see what the goat was doing, he appeared to be about ten paces closer to me. It was, I suppose, a strange thing to see.

The goat screamed again, and again spun the wheel. This time it was right hand green. I had a few options here. This wasn’t your typical Twister board where all the reds are in a line, all the yellows are in a line, and so on. No, the colors were just all over the place. I settled on a green just to my right. I looked up at the goat again. He seemed to be even closer than before, his arms and legs stretched to what had to be their limits.

Next up was right foot yellow. I moved my foot backwards a little. The goat was now just five or six feet in front of me. I briefly wondered what would happen if it reached me.

Left foot yellow. I looked around for a place to move to, but the only two yellows within reach brought me closer to the goat. I didn’t have much of a choice, so I picked the closer of the two. This time, the goat didn’t seem to have moved too much. It looked like it was pretty much anchored in place by its right hand. Right hoof. As long as a right hand didn’t get rolled, I’d have time to create some distance between the two of us.

Left hand red. I managed to move my hand backwards and pivot my body away from the goat. I could hear it breathing, heavily.

Left foot green. Right foot green. Left hand blue. Left foot red. Now I was anchored by my right hand, too, but I’d made about as much distance as I could between myself and the goat.

Right hand blue. I moved my hand as far forward as I possibly could. I wasn’t really in a position to look behind me, but it sounded like the goat was closer than before. The reality was that my limbs were about half the length of the goat’s. All I could do was pray that it fell over before it reached me.

Left foot yellow. Right foot red. Right hand green. Right hand blue. Left hand green. Right foot red. I was crawling away at a glacial pace and I knew the goat was just behind me. It was practically huffing and puffing in my ear, and every time it screamed I felt like I was about to pop an ear drum.

Left foot blue. Left foot green. Left hand yellow. Right hand yellow. Right foot blue. Left foot blue. Left hand green. Right hand green. I could feel the goat’s body heat. It must have been just above me, then. In the periphery of my vision I could see its hooves flanking either side of my body.

Left foot red. Left hand red. Right hand yellow. Right foot blue. The goat had me in its grips at that point. Its body was directly on top of me and I could feel its breath on the back of my neck. Its arms and legs were positioned around me as though they were a cage, completely halting my movement.

Left hand green. The goat shifted its body slightly, easily reaching another green. I, on the other hand, was not so fortunate. There was a green up ahead, but it was just out of reach. All I could do at that point was try. I stretched forward as far as I could, closer, closer, and fell flat on my stomach.

There was a flash, and then I was floating in the air, limbs splayed out like I was some kind of frog. From out of the darkness stepped the goat, carrying a very large pair of scissors. I tried to close my eyes but couldn’t. Something was holding them open. The goat lunged forward as I felt a searing pain in my left arm. Then, I was back in the old lady’s house. The lady in question was still standing there, staring at me, and next to her was that damn Italian. They stared for a moment, and then the two of them burst out into laughter. They kept laughing and laughing, and I could swear the mannequins were laughing too. Everyone was laughing at me. I got out of the chair and pushed my way back to the door, realizing as I did so that my left arm was missing. Once I was out the door I kept running, all the way back to Gustavo’s workshop. Gustavo was out when I arrived, so I took the time to inspect what used to be my left arm. There was no wound, no scar – it was as if there had never even been an arm there. I suppose I wasn’t as shocked as most people would have been. I’m right-handed, so not having a left arm just wasn’t something that bothered me that much. So, sorry if I’m kind of glossing over the fact that I lost an arm.

When Gustavo returned, he didn’t even seem to notice my missing arm. No, he must have noticed it, he just didn’t acknowledge it for some reason. When he asked me how the delivery went I described the whole incident with the goat and the Twister game, but he just stood there nodding his head without saying a word. He stopped asking me to help with deliveries after that. Well, he stopped asking me to help with much of anything. I wondered if this was the subtle form of ableism that the disabled have to experience, or if I was just imagining things. That started to happen a lot around that time. When I went to the market, people stared. At least, I think they did. When I tried to buy something, I got upcharged. At least, I think I did. When I went to a restaurant, they spit in my food. At least, I think they did. You get the idea. It felt like the mannequins were discriminating against me, too. Like, I’d be walking down the street, turn a corner, and run right into a mannequin that hadn’t been at that position a week ago. I figured I was just being paranoid and I was still learning a lot, anyway, so I wasn’t keen on the idea of leaving Austria early. More than the possibility of encountering that goat again, it was the Italians that worried me. I remained vigilant.

I was at the market one day, buying an egg, when out of the corner of my eye I saw something scuttling about in the shadows. I returned the egg I was inspecting to its rightful place and went over to investigate. As I approached, though, the figure fled down an alley, forcing me to give chase. They weren’t very fast and I was quickly able to catch up to them. I initiated a flying tackle, something I’d practiced a lot in high school, and easily brought the mysterious person down to the ground. It was a man, one without any arms. He was carrying a piece of bread in his mouth and was making muffled noises that sounded like someone trying to talk with a piece of bread in their mouth. It was the first time I’d seen someone else who was missing a limb in Grotleberg, so my mind immediately drifted to the goat and that awful game of Twister. I wondered if he’d seen the same things I had. I had the guy pinned down, so I grabbed the bread out of his mouth and started asking questions. He either didn’t understand English or was pretending not to understand it, so I pointed at the places where his arms should have been, then at my missing left arm. The man looked angry, pissed even, but seemed to get what I was trying to say. He started talking very quickly, although I couldn’t understand any of what he was saying. I caught that name a few times, though – Pierre Mannequin. The man’s eyes and tongue were pointing in all different directions, too, like he was trying to convey something. I looked in the direction his tongue was pointing and saw a mannequin dressed in baby clothes hanging from a balcony. I followed his eyes, too, first his left and then his right, and spotted a mannequin sitting in the direction of each. All of them seemed to be staring straight at us.

Somewhat unnerved, I accidentally relaxed my pin on the man, and he took that opportunity to bite me on the leg really hard. I leapt backward in shock, dropping the bread as I did so. The man snatched the bread out of the air and then disappeared down the alley before I could regain my bearings. I supposed that, in a way, it was comforting to know that there were other people who had gone through the same things I had. At least, I assumed he’d gone through the same things I had. Like I said, I didn’t actually understand anything he’d said. Anyway, the man’s mentions of Pierre Mannequin had piqued my interest, so when I returned to my apartment I decided to do a little research. I mean, I knew the basics like anyone else in the mannequin repair business, but something was nagging me, something deeper than just the basic facts.

My laptop was open and on and I was just getting ready to start Googling “Pierre Mannequin” when I realized that I was all out of coins to put in the router. In Gradensborg, internet access works on a sort of pay-to-use system. Routers all have coin slots in them, and if you put a one-euro coin in the slot you get fifteen minutes of internet access, or thirty clicks. They might use a similar system in the rest of Europe, I’m not really sure. Europeans are generally missing a lot of freedoms that us in the States take for granted, and one of those freedoms is being able to use the internet without having to constantly carry around coins to put in the router. I cursed my luck and decided that I would need to go to the bank to exchange my euro bills for coins.

I walked to the bank and was surprised to find that there was a long line of people inside who I can only assume were waiting to do bank-related things like withdrawing money and cashing checks. I was dead set on learning more about Pierre Mannequin, so I got in line and waited. The reason the line was so long, it seemed, was that only one of the service counters had a teller behind it. The rest were all staffed by mannequins in suits, all smiling, and, I assume, all happy to be there. The hours passed by and slowly, slowly the line moved forward. Every once in a while I’d touch the egg that was still in my pocket, the one I’d bought at the market, and that managed to keep me calm.

There were exactly six people ahead of me in line when I heard a loud commotion coming from the entrance of the bank. I had to stand on my tiptoes to see what was going on, but from what I could tell there were maybe three or four guys in balaclavas waving assault rifles around and yelling in… Well, maybe it was English. I couldn’t really tell from that far away. Then, another three guys in balaclavas showed up behind them, and then three more. My first thought was that these people probably hadn’t come to withdraw money. All but two of the guys started to make their way forward and as they did I could see the other people in the bank getting down on their hands and knees. Once they’d gotten a bit closer I was finally able to make out what they were yelling, something about getting down if you wanted to live. The English was a little broken, for sure, but that accent… What was that accent?

Realization hit my stomach like a sack of beans. That was an *Italian* accent. I was overcome with a great weakness and fell to my knees, the egg making an audible *crack* and making a huge mess all over my pants. My eyes were glued shut and I was facing the floor but I could hear the voice getting closer, closer, closer. And then it was right behind me, and then it stopped. No, it didn’t stop, it changed, changed to Italian. The man seemed to be calling out to his friends, and then I felt something hard and cold poking at the nape of my neck.

“Get up, you!” said the Italian.

I didn’t want to but I knew that I didn’t really have a choice since the thing poking at me was most likely the barrel of the guy’s assault rifle. So I got up. There were five men in balaclavas in front of me. The one in the middle was using his gun to point at my pocket, where all the egg was leaking out. The men started to laugh, and from their laughs I realized that *all* of them were Italian. I took a few steps back, praying that I’d somehow be able to run away from that place, but two of them immediately pointed their guns at me, still laughing like Italian banshees. Standing there, getting laughed at by a bunch of Italians, unable to move because they had guns, I could feel it boiling inside me once again. It was like a massive gas bubble in my stomach, the kind you get after eating a lot of shrimp. I tried to force it down but I couldn’t, and it burst out of my mouth like a big load of vomit. Yes, that’s right, I said that awful word again.

Now I was back in that horrible dark place. The goat was there, too, and when I approached him he gave me the same spiel as the last time. We would be playing Twister again, it seemed, and if I lost the punishment would be the same. The goat slowly morphed back into that strange, humanlike form, only his left arm was missing. And then, we played the game. This time, all the left arm spaces had been removed from the spinner. I was having balance issues from the start since I hadn’t been armless for long. The goat didn’t even have to catch up to me that time, I just fell over on my own after a particularly brutal left foot green. And so, that’s how I lost my left leg.

When I returned to the bank I fell over, unable to balance on just one leg. One of the Italians suddenly burst into a rage and pointed his gun at me in a very threatening manner.

“What the *fuck* did you just call me, bro?”

I really thought he was going to shoot me, but I didn’t care. I only had one leg, so why did anything matter? Two of the guy’s pals stepped in and physically restrained him. They were saying something in Italian, who knows what. It didn’t matter. I was lying on the floor there, staring up at the Italians, wondering what the hell was even going on. I suppose my guard slipped there. No, it was going to happen again, as long as I was stuck in that bank with all those Italians it was going to happen again. This time, though, I said it so casually, like I wasn’t even trying to hold it in.

I shouldn’t even have to explain what happened after that. I saw the goat, I played Twister, and I lost. This time it was my other leg. I was legless. Once I was back in the bank I lasted less than a minute before I said it again. Perhaps I’d come to accept the futility of it all. There was no escape from this horrible situation, not without legs. Why had they singled me out? It was all because of that damn egg. If it wasn’t for that damn egg, maybe I could have just gotten down and stared at the floor until the Italians were gone. Maybe. Maybe…

Needless to say, I lost Twister with only one arm. I no longer had any limbs. I was a bug. Some kind of disgusting bug that has to inch its way across the floor. What would happen to me if I met the goat again? A chill ran through what was left of my body. I knew that word was coming, just a few moments more and it would come. The Italian who had gotten mad at me had calmed down, and they were once more laughing at me. Ha, ha, ha, what a riot! Look at this pathetic bug-person with egg all over their pants! Yeah, I bet I looked pathetic. I bet I would have laughed, too, if I was one of those Italians. I glanced over at the teller booths. The mannequins looked like they were staring at me, with those big goofy smiles they always have. Yeah, laugh at me, I know you want to. That’s essentially what was running through my mind in that moment.

Suddenly, there was a series of loud cracks coming from the direction of the bank entrance as, one by one, the heads of the Italians exploded into a mess of gore and balaclava pieces. Some of them turned and tried to return fire, but none were fast enough. It was all over in mere seconds. My urge to say that evil word suddenly disappeared, and just as quickly I was filled with another urge that was telling me to keep on living. A squad of people in heavy military gear stormed the bank, conducting what I have to assume was some sort of sweep of the place for leftover Italians. One of them saw me and called over a medic. He started speaking to me in German but I made loud sounds to let him know that I didn’t understand him. He called one of his buddies over, who explained to me that they had a medic with them who would take me to the nearest hospital. I told him that I was an American and that I didn’t have health insurance, but he assured me that I had nothing to worry about because, well, I wasn’t in America anymore – I could go to the hospital for free, no strings attached. My eyes filled with tears. I couldn’t believe I was going to make it out of this whole thing alive.

In the ambulance, the medic explained to me that he was with the Austrian special forces, the Jagdkommando. They’d been tracking mafia activity around that part of Austria and had an idea that something was going to go down in Grotzenberg, just not where or when. At the mention of the word “mafia” I instinctively shriveled back like a bug.

The hospital was at the northern end of town on top of a tall, tall hill. The medic carried me in there like I was a ham on a plate, but I didn’t think there was any use in complaining so I didn’t. The medic and the receptionist talked for a while, but it was all in German. Neither of them sounded very happy, though, but maybe that’s just how German sounds. Eventually the medic pulled out some kind of badge and the receptionist seemed to acquiesce to whatever he was trying to get her to do. As we sat in the waiting area, he told me that the receptionist had refused to let me see a doctor and hadn’t explained why. When the medic threatened to unleash the Jagdkommando on her, she finally gave in and, well, told us to wait for a doctor.

I suppose I’ve gone on long enough by now, so I’ll skip through most of the rest. The doctor came and took me to a room, hooked me up to a couple of machines, and said he’d run some tests on me. That was where I parted ways with the medic. It’s been a few days, now, since I first got here. I feel like I’ve been through every test in the book, but none of the doctors that have inspected me seem to know what’s wrong. To be honest I feel perfectly fine, except for the part where I don’t have any arms or legs. The only close call was a little while ago, with the… Well, with the Italian doctor. The last few doctors that have been through have told me that all they’re really sure of is that I’ll be dying soon. I’m not sure how I feel about that. Like I said, I don’t *feel* like I’m going to die. I don’t even feel sick. I told them to contact Gustavo so he’d know where I am, but he hasn’t come to visit a single time. The only real company I have is the mannequin sitting in the corner. After they changed me into a hospital gown, the nurses put my clothes on the mannequin. So, when I talk to the mannequin I can sort of pretend I’m talking to myself.

Hmmm, what else can I really say? The food here’s no good. It’s sausage and potatoes – big surprise. For dessert I get a jell-o cup. It tastes a little more bitter than the jell-o I’m used to in the States, but I’ll take anything I can get that isn’t sausage and potatoes. Sorry for the anticlimactic ending. As you can guess, I’ve sort of just been laying in this bed writing up everything that’s happened to me. Typing on a phone keyboard with your chin is a lot harder than you might expect. At first I was just writing it for myself, basically just to kill time, but then I found a coin under my pillow which means I can just post the damn thing online. I never got to become a big shot in the mannequin repair industry, but at least I’ll be able to leave something behind after I’m gone. At this point I think I’m just starting to ramble so I guess I should cut it short. After all the bizarre shit that’s happened to me, I still have to say that my opinion of Austria is pretty positive. Just make sure to bring some snacks with you.
