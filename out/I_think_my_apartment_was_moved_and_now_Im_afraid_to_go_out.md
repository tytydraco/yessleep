About a month ago, I was told that the owners of my previous apartment were going through a family tragedy. A dead or lost relative or something. They were planning to sell the apartment soon. Knowing how tough the rental market can be, I started looking for a new place straight away.

After a few weeks of searching - checking online, in the papers, driving about town, anything I could think of – I found a place. I couldn’t believe my luck. Some of my friends had recently spent *months*, if not much longer, trying to find housing.

The ad described a one bedroom, one bathroom, one parking spot, unfurnished apartment in a relatively new building complex. The rent was a slight bump from what I was previously paying, but as I had no desire to find myself homeless, I quickly messaged the agent to organize an inspection.

The agent got back to me straight away and so the next day during my lunch break I went to check out what I hoped would be my future sanctum. The apartment was bigger than I expected, with plenty of good light, a cozy bedroom, and a smart, spacious kitchen.

I wouldn’t go so far as to say it was my *dream* apartment. The view from the balcony was rather bland and generic, offering only a glimpse at other buildings in the complex, and the bathroom was dull and somehow older-looking than the rest of the place. I figured I could jazz it up, though, and it wasn’t anything that diminished my overall enthusiasm in the slightest.

I told the property manager (the agent I had spoken with was held up at another appointment) that I was happy with it, and, getting ahead of myself, asked when I could move in. He laughed and said that whilst he would obviously have to check with the owners, he was confident that based on my rental history and the fact I have no kids, no pets, a stable job, it would almost be a certainty that they would accept.

I was ecstatic. The property manager was all smiles as well - an easy win for him too, I suppose. As we were leaving, he introduced me to the complex’s caretaker, which I took as another good sign. The caretaker, a blunt and cold-eyed man, mentioned that phone reception in some of the buildings was spotty at times, which made the property manager bristle and repeatedly reassure me that it wasn’t really an issue, that a new cell tower was soon to be installed nearby. I didn’t care – I’m on my phone enough for work, and if people occasionally can’t reach me after hours when I’m relaxing, that’s too bad.

The caretaker asked where I was moving from, and I said the other side of town. He told me there is a particular moving company that he prefers new residents use, because it is a somewhat finicky location with several security entrances. As their fee was about a third of what I was expecting, I asked him to write down their name and number. Once again, I couldn’t believe my good fortune.

A few days later the agent called and said my application had been approved. Amazing! I left work early and signed all the papers that afternoon. We shook hands, thanks for your help, call me if you have any questions etc. It had all been so smooth. 

I moved in last week. The moving company was punctual and efficient, no-frills. Just one guy and a big van. I think he was foreign, he had an accent, and wore a facemask the whole time, only saying a few gruff words to me. But he clearly knew the drill, as all my stuff was picked up and brought to my new apartment within a couple of hours.

Home sweet home. Not that my old place had been awful, but as it happens with many changes of circumstance, I felt like I had started the next chapter of my life. I settled in for a few days, finding no issues or hidden oddities, before I had to go across country for a work conference (which I had known about for ages, and I wanted to be secure before I went).

The conference was lackluster – it was work, after all – but it was good to catch up with colleagues who worked in different parts of the country. But nothing spectacular. I was looking forward to getting back.

My morning flight was delayed, typical, so I was already a little sulky when I arrived back in town. I took an Uber to my new apartment and lugged my bags up to my floor. I dug into my coat, pulled out my keys, and went to unlock the front door.

But it wouldn’t unlock.

I tried again. Locked. I double-checked to make sure I was using the right key, as I had been given a few. One for the front door, one for the main security entrance to the whole complex, one for my parking spot/garage. I tried all three. Locked. I tried *every* key on my keychain. Locked.

Grumpy from rising early yet getting back later than intended, I decided this wasn’t going to be solely my problem. I picked up my bags and left the building, down to the caretaker’s office.

I explained my situation. The caretaker looked at my key, said it didn’t look misshapen or damaged in any way. He ducked out to a back room and came back with my spare key (or a master key for the whole complex, I’m not sure as we didn’t end up needing it).

I was heading towards the ground floor entrance to my building when I noticed that the caretaker was continuing ahead. He turned back and frowned.  

“You’re Apartment 115, aren’t you?”

“Yes.”

“Next one. Look.”

He pointed towards an A4 sign that was right in front of me, next to the key-fob swipe.

*Apartments 61-80*.

This threw me. Had I been so exhausted that I went into the wrong building? No, I saw ‘115’ on the door – *my* door – that I tried to unlock. I distinctly remember that. Or did I? I had been in a hotel for the last few nights. Maybe I had gone to whatever my hotel’s room number had been. In fact, what *was* the number of the room that I stayed in? I had only checked out this morning, but I couldn’t recall it.

Feeling like a bit of an idiot, I followed the caretaker along to the next building. He pointed again to an equally tacky sign. *Apartments 101-120.*

Right.

He held the entrance door open for me, thank you very much, probably thinks I’m mental, and we went up to my floor. Outside my door – ‘115’ – he handed me back my key. I slid it in and turned.

The door unlocked and swung open.

I went into my apartment. Everything was as I had left it. It needed a bit of tidying up and decorating to make it homely, sure, but I had only moved in last week. Any mess was forgivable. Still, as I was already feeling quite a schmuck, I mumbled that I had probably just gone into the wrong building, thanked the caretaker for his help, he said no worries and left.

I walked around for a few minutes. Nothing was out of place. Good. Just a simple mix-up, bound to happen, no drama. I was just tired. In fact, I decided it wasn’t too late to take a nap.

When I awoke, I found things weren’t *exactly* as I had left them.

Nothing major. Nothing astonishing or immediately bone-chilling, in any case.

The first was the view from my balcony. Opening the blinds, I found it just looked… different. A slight change of angle. The opposite building looked odd. Had my neighbors always had a boxing bag hanging on their balcony? Or that one. Did that one have so many pot plants when I last saw it?

I didn’t ponder too much about this. After all, I have only spent a few days here, and am not one to snoop too closely on fellow tenants. As long as they’re clean and quiet, I really don’t care.

The second relates to a slight neuroticism of mine. Forgive me if it sounds pedantic, but I know we all do these little things in some way or another. When I put toilet roll on the holder, I always make sure it is turned so the hanging strip is *away* from the wall, not next to it. Until living with roommates, I thought everyone did this. Fussy, perhaps, but it just makes sense – why would I want my knuckles rapping against the wall when I pull the strip? 

Well, when I went to the bathroom after my nap, I noticed the roll was facing the other way, *towards* the wall. Now, this isn’t exactly sinister, I admit. But it is not something I would ever intentionally do. I tried to remember how many times I had used the bathroom since I moved in (and quickly gave up on this). Maybe, because of the stress of unpacking and in my eagerness to set everything up, I had put it on the wrong way. No big deal.

The third thing was much more conspicuous. It was evening by now and starting to get cold, so I went to my bedroom to get some socks. Opening my sock drawer, I found…

Pants.

*My* pants, yes. All exactly as I had left them. However, my pants don’t go in the top drawer. My socks go in the top drawer.

Always.

Opening the drawer below it, I found my socks, and pulled out a pair. This was most egregious. The balcony view, the toilet roll – those could both be easily excused as a lapse of concentration.

But not my sock drawer.

Of course, I had had to pack up all my clothes during the move, put them in bags, take out the drawers, put them back in one-by-one. It was not impossible – or even unlikely – that in the rush of re-assembling all my furniture that something ended up out of place.

However, it *is* impossible that I wouldn’t have noticed this by now. Like everyone, I’m sure, I have a very particular morning routine. The order my clothes go on is part of that routine. I spent several days at my apartment before going to the conference. New apartment, sure, but same dressing procedure. There’s no question in my mind that I would have realized my error and swapped the drawers back to their correct positions.

Something didn’t feel right. Had I indeed gone into the wrong building when I came back? I thought so. But how would that make sense? Even if I had, it still didn’t explain why something felt off with *this* apartment.

I decided to call the agent. I wanted to ask which building we had gone into during the viewing. I had thought it was the *third* building on the right – the one I must have accidentally gone into earlier today - not the fourth building that I am currently in.

I was scrolling through my phone when I remembered that the agent hadn’t been with me that day. It was his associate, the property manager, and I didn’t have his number.

Checking the time, I saw it was now well after business hours, but I was still feeling perturbed. I would have to call him tomorrow. I could try to find his number at least. What was his name?

I Googled the real estate agency. It’s a nationwide agency, so that obviously didn’t help. I narrowed down my search by typing “\[*agency name*\] + \[*town name*\]”.

The results were alarming.

The local site for the agency was the top link, but it was impossible to miss the many other articles that detailed a much grimmer subject. I read several of them, all with the same general content. I’ve copy-pasted one of the shorter ones here, with some of the information edited, as I am now feeling quite exposed and vulnerable.

***‘Family members of missing real estate agent still hoping for her safe return’***

 *The family of missing real estate agent, Jacqueline \[redacted\], 27, are still maintaining hope that she could be found safe and unharmed.*

*“It’s been three months, and we know how these sorts of cases usually go,” said Jacqueline’s father in a statement. “But she’s a tough young lady. Whatever is going on with her, she’s doing her best and I know she’s still out there.”*

*“We’re all still so confused and in shock,” said Jacqueline’s mother. “She’s such a sensible woman, she would never get up and disappear like that.”*

*“Jackie gets along with everyone, she’s so kind, so beautiful. We can’t imagine that anyone would ever want to hurt her.”*

*A police investigation has cleared her family and boyfriend \[redacted\] of any involvement in Jacqueline’s disappearance, with officials stating that they are treating it as “suspicious” and are “concerned for \[her\] well-being”.* 

*Ms. \[redacted\] was last seen at her workplace of \[xxxx Realty Group\] on April 17th. She told colleagues she was going out to provide a viewing of a rental apartment in \[suburb\]. But according to the prospective tenant, she never showed up, and she did not return to her office that day.*

*No-one has seen or heard from Jacqueline since.*

*Police urge anyone with information regarding Jacqueline’s whereabouts to contact…*

A missing woman. Who was about my age. Who worked for my real estate agent. Who disappeared going to an appointment in my suburb. There are only a few apartment complexes around here. So, there’s a good chance that it was this one.

Deeply upsetting.

But… it was not explicitly related to my current predicament. Spooky, for sure. Sad, yes. For me, well, I was just remembering a few things wrong. Mixing them up. Understandable. After all, how much attention do you *really* pay to every little thing in your life, when you do every little thing every single day?

I clicked onto the agency site and found the property manager’s number. I would call him tomorrow, if I could be bothered. Probably not.

Even though I hadn’t done much today, I usually had a shower before bed, and additionally, wanted to thoroughly rid myself of any hotel room filth still clinging to my body. Also, showers are a good reset, good to take your mind off things. As I got in, something in the bathtub caught my eye.

The plughole in the bath was much more worn than I had previously noticed. It wasn’t dirty or grimy exactly, but it did have an odd color to it. It looked faded, almost corroded, as if it had been exposed to something for some time.

When I finished showering, I inspected the plughole closer. Definitely pallid and washed-out. Looking around the tub, I saw that whilst sparkly-white, it was a bit dusty. I would have to give it a once-over tomorrow. But not tonight, not after a shower. Cleaning comes before showers.

I thought I would get out some cleaning products and leave them on the counter to remind me in the morning. I couldn’t remember which ones I had brought with me in the move and which ones I had just chucked out. I thought I better have a look and see what I might need to pick up from the store.

Checking the cabinet under my kitchen sink I took out all the usual suspects. Good. I wasn’t lacking anything.

Then I saw it.

Towards the back. To the right. Behind the pipes. I could easily have missed it, it was so dark, so hidden.

A bag.

I pulled it out. A black satchel, a tote of some sorts. It wasn’t solid, clearly there were a few things inside.

I opened it up and tipped out its contents.

Rope. Long, bundled rope.

Duct tape. Thick, heavy-duty duct tape.

Plastic bottles. Unlabeled, cryptic liquids swilling within three plastic bottles.

Terrifying.

This was truly messed up. I couldn’t wait until tomorrow, not after finding this. I had to do something. Call someone.

I remembered the agent telling me that the apartment complex has all-hours security. How do I get in contact with them? What was the number?

I ran out of the kitchen, to the living room, where I still had most of the new rental documents scattered upon my table. Frantically I flipped through them, looking for the right words, the right number.

There it was. ‘Security/Caretaker’.

I punched the number into my phone.

As I hit call, I saw that that the number I dialed had changed to a saved contact in my phone.

*EZ-Shifters (new apt)*.

The line connected, only for a split-second, then dropped out. I stared at my phone.

What?

I went back to the table, frenziedly flicking through all the forms and folders until I found it. The scrap of paper with the name and number of the moving company. I checked it against ‘Security/Caretaker’ on the building information sheet.

It was the same number.

How? Had the caretaker accidentally written his own number down? That didn’t add up. I had called the moving company. The number worked. The guy came, he got my stuff, it was the right number. Wait. The guy…

Panic took over. I opened my browser and began searching. EZ-Shifters, EZ-Movers, Eazy Shifters, Easy Movers, easy moving company, removals in town, moving company town, help moving town. 

EZ-Shifters did not appear once.

I wasn’t expecting a glamorous Instagram or anything. Or even an updated website. Just the words. The name. The number. A shitty review. Anything. But it was as if it didn’t exist. I could not find a single trace of it.

Nothing.

And now someone is knocking on my front door.
