I woke up on a bench that was in a town with no name that I had no memory of. 

The metal was cold through my shirt. Damp, maybe from rain or maybe from me. I didn’t know how long I’d been there. I didn’t know anything at all.

No name. No memories. Just a headache that pulsed like a heartbeat behind my eyes and the sense that I’d lost something important. Or maybe someone important? There’s no way to know with a headache like this.

The street around me was quiet, too quiet for a place with lights still flickering in the windows and shadows cast on the walls. A small diner blinked its neon sign: “OPEN 24 HOURS” The glow buzzed faintly, a mosquito whine under my skin. It was the only sound besides my own breathing.

I checked my pockets. No wallet. No phone. Just a crumpled piece of paper, damp from the air. God was it always so humid in this town?

There was a note scrawled across it in shaky handwriting.

**“Jasper Lane”**

And underneath it: **“Find the red door”**

I didn’t know what it meant. But the second I read those words, my legs moved. My body knew something I didn’t. Muscle memory dragging my mind behind it like a stubborn dog.

I followed empty sidewalks past stores that hadn’t opened in what looked like years. Their mannequins stood behind shattered glass like frozen people, watching me. The street names were familiar in the way dreams felt wrong but still right. I passed a school I didn’t remember attending, a rusting jungle gym I could almost picture my feet dangling from.

By the time I found Jasper Lane, my fingers were trembling. My hair wet and my breath ragged. As if I had ran here but my legs didn’t ache from use, they ached because they wanted to keep moving.

The houses here leaned in too close, like they’d been whispering secrets to each other before I arrived. Red paint flaked off one door like scabs, barely visible behind thick vines that grew from nowhere and wrapped the porch like veins.

I stepped up. The wood groaned under my foot. The door wasn’t locked.

Inside smelled like burnt paper and wet dog. A single hallway stretched forward, lined with photos and cheap overhead lights. My eyes locked onto a particular picture.

It was a picture of a boy. Hair slicked back with gel. Eyes too wide. Smile too forced. A mans hand gripped his shoulder just a little too tightly.

I stared at it for a long time, something tightening in my chest.

Then the boy blinked.

And the hallway lights shut off, one by one.

I didn’t remember walking down the hallway, but I must have. The floorboards under my shoes were warped, each step sounding more distant than the last—as if I were walking away from myself.

The boy in the photo never blinked again.  I didn’t take my eyes off him. Just to be sure. 

Not while I passed.

Not while I opened the door at the end of the hall.

The next place wasn’t a room. It was a parking lot. Fog rolled across broken pavement under a flickering streetlight. There were no cars. No buildings. Just yellowed lines painted onto asphalt that stretched out in every direction, like it belonged to a mall that had died a decade ago but hadn’t been buried.

And in the middle of it all: a door. Freestanding. Red, but clean this time. Fresh. New.

My feet didn’t hesitate.

The second I touched the handle, I heard… laughter. High-pitched. Children. Dozens of them. For a moment I thought I was back in the school I’d passed earlier—until the door swung open and I stepped into a classroom that smelled like mildew and copper.

The desks were small. The chalkboard was clean. Every chair had a backpack hanging from it, but the seats were empty. 

The lights cut out and then back on. 

A teacher stood at the front of the room, back turned, scribbling equations in frantic, looping chalk. They didn’t stop when I walked backwards slowly. 

I didn’t speak. I didn’t need to.

The teacher turned slowly, face calm, eyes wide and hollow. They had no pupils—just white, like candle wax. Their mouth opened, but the words came from behind me.

“You forgot to raise your hand.”

I looked around.

Every desk was full now. Children sat motionless, each with their head twisted just slightly to the side. Their eyes locked on me. Unblinking. 

A certain look in their eyes. Something familiar. Was it— hostility or maybe more like… malice?

“You forgot your name,” the teacher said. “You forgot your promises.”

I stumbled back, but the door was gone. The walls stretched taller, the ceiling turned black, and all I could hear was a pen scratching paper over and over and over. This headache, how do I make this headache stop. 

Then—

A bell rang.

The room disappeared.

I was on a sidewalk again. Street lamps humming overhead. Somewhere far off, a dog howled. Or maybe screamed.

My knuckles were scraped, and I didn’t remember why. My mouth tasted like dirt. Dry, earthy with a grit that crunched between my molars. 

There was another note in my hand now. Same handwriting.

**“Try the house next. The one with the fence.”**

I didn’t question how it got there. I didn’t have room left in my head for new questions. I didn’t think there was any room in my head for anything with this buzzing in my head. 

I could feel old questions tugging at my mind. 

And they were getting louder. 

The house looked familiar in the way scars do. You can run your fingers over them and almost feel the pain again. 

White siding warped by time. A chain-link fence that sagged like it had given up trying to keep anything out—or in. The lawn was dead, but the weeds were alive. They reached up, yellow and brittle, crackling like paper in the wind.

I didn’t knock.

Inside, everything smelled like warm milk and pennies. The kind of air that clings to the back of your throat. The furniture was wrong—not old, not broken, just… wrong. Stiff. Arranged like a stage play, like someone had built a memory from secondhand parts. It lacked life. 

I saw pictures on the mantle. Faces stained by water damage, or maybe that was just my eyes again. This headache won’t relent the whole front of my face was almost vibrating from the pain. 

I couldn’t tell if the people in the photos were family or strangers. It didn’t matter.

Someone was sitting at the kitchen table.

A woman. Pale arms. Long dark hair that looked greasy and stuck to her head. She didn’t look up when I entered, but her voice cut through the silence like it had been waiting years.

“You said you’d come back for me.”

My throat closed.

“I—I don’t know who you are.”

She turned her head slightly. Just enough to let me see the corner of her face. Her mouth was trembling—but not in grief.

In rage.

“You never listened. You never helped. You let it happen.”

She stood. Her chair didn’t scrape the floor. It didn’t make a sound at all.

I backed into the hallway, heart hammering in my ears. The walls there were too close. Lined with photos again, but this time the faces were blacked out with marker. Every frame. Except one.

Mine.

I was a child. Crying. Shirt torn. A thin trickle of blood ran from one nostril. And behind me, a shadow with no face. Just hands. So many hands.

I turned—but the hallway wasn’t empty anymore.

A boy stood there.

He couldn’t have been more than six. Mud on his clothes. Wide eyes that never blinked. He looked like he wanted to speak, but couldn’t.

He reached up—slowly—and pointed at me.

Then the lights shattered.

I don’t remember leaving the house.

I remember the sound of glass breaking, and then the sound of my own breathing—too fast, too loud, like someone else had taken over my lungs and legs and carried me away.

Then I was somewhere else.

A hallway in a hospital? No. Hospitals felt clean and safe, I could sense something different. Something fake and familiar. Fear. 

The floor was linoleum. The walls were a dank yellow, stained from neglect and they curved inward like a throat. Fluorescent lights blinked overhead, too bright to be real and they blinked in irregular increments, never in sync. My shoes squeaked on the tile, but only every other step. The silence between them felt louder than the squeaks themselves. 

I turned a corner and found a door. No label. A puddle forming underneath. 

When I pushed it open, it was raining inside.

Rain from a ceiling. Rain on carpet. Rain on a birthday cake, candles still lit somehow. Balloons sagged in the corners. Streamers dangled like nooses. A child’s voice echoed somewhere in the room—no words, just muffled sobs behind a closet door.

I opened it.

Nothing inside.

Just coats.

Just shadows.

Just—

Whispers.

They slid along the walls like oil, low and mean, and so very familiar. Not in the words but in the tone.

**Disappointment.**

**Shame.**

**Why can’t you just be normal?**

Stains left on the walls the will never be washed away, no matter how much it rains. Oil on water, just waiting for an open flame. 

I ran.

Another hallway. This one was lined with hospital beds, each one occupied by… me. Sleeping. Dying. Screaming. Eyes stitched shut. Mouth frozen mid-prayer. I passed one where I was holding my own hand, telling myself it would be okay.

I lied.

The world tipped sideways. My knees hit the floor but gravity was wrong it pulled me forward, dragging my body through a tunnel of voices, lights and smells that changed every second.

A heartbeat pounded overhead, as loud as thunder. The buzzing made my head feel like it was going to explode. 

The heartbeat wasn’t mine.

It wasn’t anyone’s.

It belonged to no one. 

I saw a figure ahead. In the static. Through the flashing lights, colors and noise. 

He looked like me.

Older. Or younger. Maybe not quite finished.

He spoke, but his mouth didn’t move.

“You’re not supposed to be here yet.”

I reached for him, and— 

Everything stopped.

I was in a bed. White room. Restraints around my wrists. A faint beeping in the distance. Clean antiseptic air. The hum of machines.

A woman sat across from me, clipboard in her lap.

She looked tired but kind. Thoughtful and possibly— Familiar?

“Do you know where you are?” she asked gently.

I tried to open my mouth.

Nothing came out.

I tried to answer.

Pain bloomed immediately. My jaw didn’t move—couldn’t move. Something deep in my face cracked with heat, sharp and electric, like nerve endings screaming through cotton. My throat made a noise I didn’t recognize.

She raised a hand gently. Not alarmed. Expecting it.

She motioned to a whiteboard next to my bed. 

“It’s okay,” she said. “You can’t speak but I’m guessing you don’t remember that.”

Her voice had weight. Gentle but grounded. Like a tether to somewhere safer than here.

“I’m Dr. Winslow. We’ve talked before. Many times.”

She flipped through her clipboard. I didn’t try to read it. My eyes felt too slow to keep up with the turning pages. 

Then she handed me something. A marker with the cap already off.

My fingers moved on their own. Awkward. Shaky. Not quite mine.

I wrote:

**“Did I die?”**

She glanced up at me, then back at the board. Her expression didn’t change.

“No,” she said. “You survived.”

A pause.

“But you’ve been very, very… sick. Sometimes getting close to death but never all the way there.”

I let the marker rest on my chest for a moment.

Then I wrote:

**“Why can’t I talk?”**

She didn’t flinch. Just breathed out slowly through her nose, like she’d rehearsed this a hundred times in her mind. 

“You hurt yourself,” she said. “But not all of you wanted to die. That part of you kept breathing. Kept fighting.”

Then I remembered.

Images flashed through my mind. The bench. The diner. The hallway. The boy in the photo. The teacher. The woman at the table. The cake. The static.

And then, somewhere underneath it all. Under my chin. The muzzle of the gun. The shaking hand. The cold metal against skin.

The noise.

God, the noise.

She reached over and touched my hand. Her skin was warm. Real. Too real.

“There’s still time,” she said. “But you need to rest now.”

I looked down. The restraints were gone. I hadn’t felt them come off.

She didn’t let go of my hand.

“You’re safe,” she said. “Just rest. Everything’s going to be okay.”

I wanted to believe her. Wanted to let myself believe that this was a hospital room. That she was a doctor. That I was getting better.

But somewhere in the corner of the room, something buzzed. A light? A fly? A voice I’d heard in a dream?

I couldn’t tell.

I closed my eyes anyway.

And for the first time in a long time… I wasn’t afraid to sleep, I wanted to wake up.
