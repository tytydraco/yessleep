We always walk home together after school. Me, Kyle, and Jenny. Our neighborhood's close enough that we don’t need to take the bus. It's usually the best part of my day. We stop by the park to mess around and sometimes head over to the train tracks next to the woods to see if we can find any railroad spikes. Kyle’s got a bunch in his room, and I’ve got a few myself. We think they’re cool, like trophies or something. 

Today was different. Today, when we went to the tracks, we saw something weird.

It was hot out, so we were all sweating by the time we reached the park. Kyle had his backpack slung over one shoulder, like always, and Jenny was already ahead of us, hopping over the cracks in the sidewalk. She was always so fast, like a little squirrel or something. We got to the park, and I could hear the train rumbling in the distance. We decided to head over to the tracks to look for spikes, just like we usually do.

But then we saw him.

There was a man standing by the tracks. Not on them, but close. He was in the woods, just standing there, staring at us. His clothes were dirty, like he’d been wearing them forever. His hair was long and tangled, and his face was hidden behind a scruffy beard. He didn’t move. He just stood there, watching us with these dark eyes.

“Hey, do you see that?” I asked Kyle and Jenny. I pointed, but I tried not to make it obvious. I didn’t want the man to know we were talking about him. 

Kyle squinted. “Yeah. I see him. Who do you think he is?”

Jenny shrugged. “Maybe he’s the homeless guy people talk about.”

Everyone at school had heard the stories. There was supposed to be some homeless guy living in the woods by the tracks. Kids said he was crazy, that he’d chase you if he caught you alone. But nobody had ever actually seen him before. It was just one of those things people said.

Until now.

“We should leave,” I said. I don’t know why I said it. The guy wasn’t doing anything. He was just standing there. But the way he stared at us made me feel sick, like I’d eaten too much candy on Halloween.

Kyle, of course, thought it was a great idea to go talk to him. “What if he knows where to find more spikes?” he said. “Maybe he’s got a whole stash of them.”

“No way,” I said. “What if he’s dangerous?”

Kyle just laughed. “He’s just some homeless dude. What’s he gonna do, throw his shoe at us?”

Before I could stop him, Kyle walked toward the man. Jenny and I stood back, frozen. My heart was pounding in my ears, and I could feel my hands shaking. Kyle was getting closer to the man, and the man was just standing there, staring at him with those dark eyes. 

“Kyle, come back!” I called, but he ignored me. He was almost right in front of the man now. I held my breath, waiting to see what would happen.

Kyle stopped just a few feet away from the man and grinned back at us like he thought this was all some big joke. “Hey, dude, you got any spikes?” he called out.

That’s when it happened.

The man moved so fast, I barely saw it. One second, he was just standing there, and the next, he had grabbed Kyle by the arm. Kyle’s grin disappeared, and he started to scream. A high, panicked scream that didn’t sound like him at all.

“Help! Let me go!” Kyle yelled, but the man didn’t let go. Instead, he started dragging Kyle into the woods. Kyle was kicking and thrashing, but it didn’t matter. The man was too strong. 

Jenny and I just stood there, too shocked to move. Kyle’s screams were getting fainter as the man pulled him deeper into the trees. “Help! Please!” Kyle’s voice cracked, and then there was nothing but the rustling of leaves.

“What do we do?” Jenny whispered, her eyes wide with fear.

I didn’t know what to say. My brain felt like it had stopped working. All I could think about was Kyle’s scream, the look on his face when the man grabbed him. I wanted to run after him, to help him, but my feet felt like they were glued to the ground.

Then, without thinking, we turned and ran. We sprinted back to the park, past the swings and the slide, and didn’t stop until we were back in our neighborhood. We ran straight to my house, where my mom was in the kitchen, making dinner.

We told her everything. The man by the tracks, how he grabbed Kyle, how he dragged him into the woods. My mom’s face went pale, and she grabbed the phone to call the police. Within an hour, there were search parties in the woods, police cars everywhere, and people shouting Kyle’s name.

They searched for three days. They brought dogs, flashlights, everything. But they never found Kyle. Not a single trace of him. It was like he had just disappeared. 

That was over a year ago. They said it was a kidnapping, that Kyle was probably long gone by now. But I know what I saw. I know that man took him. 

Jenny and I never went back to that park or those tracks again. I still have nightmares about it, though. I can still hear Kyle’s scream, see the look on his face. And sometimes, when I’m alone in my room, I think I can hear footsteps outside my window.

Waiting.
