To whom it may concern,

Attached below you will find the personal record of Mr. Thomas P. Howard.

February 11th, 2025:

9:30 am:
I’m about to hit the road. Rick asked us all to be in Nashville no later than 6. He wants to do a few practice runs before the show tonight. Looks like I’ll be a little bit late, but whatever. He’s the one who recommended I get my strings replaced at the joint 3 hours away from the airport. I feel tired, and not just physically. I think the late nights are catching up to me. Damn, am I getting old already? Weather is shit. It’s been nothing but thunder and rain for the past week. I’m starting to forget what the sun looks like.

12:00 pm:
I’m behind the wheel right now. I’m sure Dr. Allison wouldn’t approve but it’s not like it matters anyway. Traffic hasn’t budged in like an hour. And this is supposed to help with my mental health after all. Still makes me feel like an idiot, though. Writing down my feelings like some middle schooler. I’m annoyed- I should be half way there by now, but they’ll have to start without me. The way the roads are right now, I won’t be there until way after dark. 

3:00 pm:
The guys are pissed at me, saying we might have to cancel the show. What do they want from me? If I could make the trip go by faster, I would. At least the traffic cleared up. That's more than I can say for the weather, though; it’s pouring. I can barely see 10 feet in front of me. Hey, they say look at the bright side, right? Free car wash. 

7:30 pm:
I give up. Destiny did not intend for this show to happen, because some higher power has it out for me today. Traffic, storms, now my tire. Either I’m the unluckiest man alive or I’m just not supposed to be in Nashville tonight. It’s getting dark. I think I’ll pull off the highway and look for a motel or something. It’s barren out here, though. Not sure if I’ll have any luck. I do not want to sleep in my car again, it gets way too cold. 

8:50 pm:
Found a spot! Big one, too. None of this ‘Motel 6’ bs. Place is called the Graystone Hotel. I have no idea what it’s doing all the way out here, it looks like it should be on the Vegas strip. The thing's so tall I damn near couldn’t see the top from outside. But sadly, size does not equal quality in this case. Graystone is a good name- the place is like a tombstone. Everything is stuffy and outdated. I feel like I’m in the 50’s. Even the air is dry. 

The lady at the counter was hot, but the weird bellhop kept staring at me with his bulgy eyes. There’s something off about that one, I can tell. He’s all hunched over and twitchy. When he talks to me, his sentences start off as a mumble and then kind of crescendo at the end. He’s got bad manners too, very pushy. He kept mumbling to me about ringing a bell. I tried to tip him but he didn’t seem interested. 

The walk up to my room was cool, other than that. This place is even bigger on the inside. I literally couldn’t see the end of my hallway, it just kept going. I didn’t time it, obviously, but the elevator ride felt like hours. 

But again, I wish they'd do some redecorating. It’s all red colors with these incredibly tacky patterns on the wallpaper and carpets. I’m amazed at how many guests they must have, though. Every room I heard from on our walk up here was banging, bumping, or screaming. It’s not even that late yet, way too early to be getting busy- night’s still young.

I just got to my room. I’m gonna shower. I’ll do my nightly ‘before bed update’ that Dr Allison always nags me about before I sleep.

11:30 pm:
I settled into the room. Now that I’ve had a look around, I have to admit I’m shocked at the state of things. It isn’t great- everything feels fake. The materials feel like someone tried to make a room out of plastic. It’s like I’m a Ken doll in a toy house. I’ve noticed some other oddities while I was snooping, too. There’s a door on the east wall that’s locked. I’m guessing it’s in case there's a family that wants to connect 2 rooms. It sounds occupied though. I keep hearing these weird noises from behind that door- like toilet plungers. Maybe they're having plumbing issues. Must be, because a big section of that wall is gooey. I’m not sure how else to describe it. Something is bleeding through it from the other side, like runny snot. Pretty gross, but the bed seems clean at least, even if the blankets are scratchy and uncomfortable. Oh, that and there’s this little bell above my headboard. Must be what the bellhop was mumbling about.

1:00 am:
I can’t sleep, the noises are so much louder now that my mind is quiet. I’m starting to think I was wrong earlier. I can still hear screaming and it doesn’t sound like the fun kind. The door on my wall is rattling too. There’s this sick, squelching noise coming from the edges of it. To hell with this, I’m checking out.

It’s locked. The door’s locked. I didn’t notice it before, but it must lock from the outside. I’m really freaking out here. I’m in the corner, holding my guitar like it’s a damn sword. I can hear more noises from the other rooms. Strange sounds, more than the screaming and banging from earlier. It’s indescribable, and different every time I hear it. Every room has new noises. Skittering, crashing, groaning, hissing. I swear I heard a goat in one of them. But the one sound that’s the same no matter where I hear it from are the bells. Every single time, right before I hear some weird shit, there's a little bell that goes off first.

I’ll keep looking for a way out. It’s way too high up for windows to be an option, but maybe I can break the door down.

It went off. My bell rang. I don’t know what to do. The door, I heard it across the room. It opened. The smell, it’s like acid and rot. I shouldn't have come here. It’s not for us- this place, this room, this hotel- it’s not for people. These other rooms, I think they’re for the real guests.

Whatever is in there is moving. I can hear slow, wet slithering from the other side. It’s too dark to see for sure, but I can see something huge, flat and wide in there. And it’s moving. It’s creeping into my room, slowly but surely. If I can get by it, maybe that room will have a way out. It’s my only shot. 

This concludes Mr. Howard's account.
