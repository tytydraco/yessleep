I’ve got 2% battery and one flickering bar of signal. I can’t make calls, but if I leave this here, maybe someone will find it. Maybe someone will listen.

If you're thinking of doing a Himalayan trek — solo, remote, soul-cleansing — *do it.* But if someone like my friend Josh insists on tagging along? *Don't let them.* I don’t care if you’ve known them since uni. I don’t care if they say things like *“it’ll be my healing era.”* Some people shouldn't come to places like this. *Some things don't want to be seen.* Or filmed.

And now something is out there. It already took Josh. It took another man before him. And now it's pacing outside the hut I'm hiding in, dragging something heavy through the snow.

I’ll explain. Just… don’t scroll past. I don’t know how long I have.

———

I came here alone.

That was the plan anyway. Ten days through rugged mountain passes, a trek up into thin air and silence. I wanted time to think, to escape. But then Josh found out.

Josh, who somehow manages to be both shredded *and* insufferable. He’s one of those guys who isn’t *technically* an influencer, but has 3,500 followers and a highlight reel called *“SoulFood.”* He lives for attention, speaks in hashtags, and treats every moment like a TikTok audition. His idea of *“roughing it”* is staying somewhere without oat milk.

When I told him where I was going, he lit up.

*“Dude, that’s perfect. I’ve been craving altitude vibes. Can we sync calendars?”*

I tried to say it wasn’t that kind of trip. That it wasn’t about content. But he wore me down. Said he needed a *“reset.”* Brought a drone. *And a ring light.* Yes, really.

By day two, I was considering pushing him off a cliff.

He kept stopping to film. Shirtless boomerangs on a ridge. Selfie videos with dramatic exhale captions. At one point he recorded himself fake-sobbing in front of a mountain range. I asked if he was okay. He said he was practicing for a reel called *“letting go.”*

Then came the bridge.

It was long, swaying, and strung high above a roaring glacial river. Yaks were lined up behind us with Sherpas guiding them, bells clinking. The path was narrow — one person at a time. And Josh, of course, decided *this* was the perfect place for content.

He stopped mid-bridge. Took off his jacket. Pulled out the tripod. *Unfolded the ring light — I shit you not.* Balanced it on the bridge cables. Traffic backed up behind us: trekkers, porters, yaks breathing heavily. Josh held up a peace sign.

*“Just a sec!”* he called back. *“Need the good light!”*

The yak closest to us snorted, stamping its hoof.

That’s when the man behind us stepped forward.

He was tall. Wire-thin. Wore a tattered jacket and a threadbare scarf. His skin looked windburnt, and his eyes — Jesus — they were sunken and flat, like he hadn’t blinked since base camp.

He didn’t say anything. Just stared at Josh.

*“Uh, we’ll move in a sec, bro,”* Josh offered, waving. *“Just need a sec for the grid.”*

The man didn’t move.

Josh turned back to pose.

Then the man shoved past.

The ring light tipped.

It hit the cable. Slid. Bounced. And then tumbled — down, down, into the freezing white rapids below.

Josh lost it.

*“DUDE! That was a gift from my ex’s manager! What the actual—”*

The man turned. Slowly. Deliberately.

His head tilted a few degrees too far. His mouth stayed closed. But his eyes — they were wide. Hungry. *Dead.*

Josh went quiet.

The man said nothing. Just stared. And then stepped off the bridge and vanished into the forest.

I should’ve known then. That was no normal stare. *That was a warning.*

———

We didn’t see him again that day.

Josh sulked, mumbling about *“toxic people”* and *“jealous energy.”* But as dusk fell, even he stopped talking.

The woods around us got strange. Too quiet. Trees shifted in ways they shouldn't. We heard things: cracking branches, soft clicks like antlers against bark. Once, I swore I heard *breathing* — not ours.

Josh laughed it off. *“It’s probably a yak.”*

*“Yaks don’t climb trees,”* I said.

We picked up pace, hoping to reach the next village, but it got dark fast. The trail vanished under cloud cover. Then, out of nowhere — a handful of wooden huts, perched on a slope like they’d grown out of the rock.

One man was outside. Older. Worn. A Sherpa, sitting by a stove.

*“All guesthouse full,”* he said.

We begged.

Finally, he led us into a small hut he said belonged to his cousin. There was one cot. A stove. A curtain for a door. Josh griped about the lack of Wi-Fi, but I was just glad to have walls.

Until the tapping started.

Three soft knocks on the window.

We froze.

There was no light outside. Just the wind.

Josh whispered, *“Was that—?”*

I pulled the curtain aside a crack.

A figure stood there. Just beyond the glass.

I saw the scarf first. Then the outline of that face. *The man from the bridge.*

He didn’t move. Didn’t blink.

I gasped.

Josh looked.

Then the figure *dropped out of view* like a puppet with its strings cut.

I ran to the door. Bolted it. My heart was jackhammering.

The Sherpa said, *“He will go. Don’t let him in.”*

*“What the hell is out there?”* I asked.

He didn’t answer.

———

We were both still shaken from the tapping at the window. Josh had stopped pacing and sat in the corner, scrolling through his photos. He kept the volume off — for once.

“I’m deleting all this shit when we get back,” he muttered. “Not worth it.”

Then he stopped.

“Wait…”

He zoomed in on one of the shots from earlier — from the bridge.

It was a wide angle. Mostly just him shirtless, grinning, holding a peace sign with yaks and the mountains behind him. But in the treeline — far back, almost buried in shadow — was a shape. It could’ve been a rock. A tree. Or a hunched figure, tall and wrong, with what looked like a head too small for its body and one long arm against the bark.

Josh went still.

He swiped to another photo — one I didn’t remember him taking.

Same setting. Different pose.

And there it was again.

Closer this time. Still half-hidden, but undeniably there. The face… if you could call it that… was blank. Not blurry — *blank.* Like a featureless mask had been stretched over it. No nose. Just a slit where the mouth should be.

“Dude,” Josh whispered. “What the fuck is that?”

I felt something shift in the air.

Like the mountains had stopped breathing.

He turned his phone off.

We sat in silence.

———

Later that night, we were still awake. Josh was pacing, saying it must’ve been a prank. Then we heard it again — a shuffle at the window.

He yanked the curtain aside.

*The man was back.*

His face was pressed to the glass.

But something was wrong.

He wasn’t moving. His mouth hung slightly open, but not breathing. His eyes looked *dried out.*

Then we saw it.

**Fingers.**

*Huge, cracked fingers — wrapped around the top of his skull.*

*Holding him up.*

The body wasn’t standing.

*The body was gone.*

And behind it... something crouched.

It filled the edges of the frame — fur, matted with blood. Shoulders hunched like a beast that had learned how to *mimic* human posture but not well. Hooves scraped the earth. The stench hit us — wet fur and rot.

And then it *slammed the head into the window.*

Glass cracked. Josh screamed.

I pulled him back as the Sherpa rushed in with a burning log. He shoved it into the firepit and muttered something low and desperate in a language I didn’t know.

We didn’t sleep.

———

At some point near dawn, Josh snapped.

*“I’m not dying in a mud hut,”* he hissed. *“This is insane.”*

He grabbed his phone light and left.

I begged him not to.

Ten minutes later, the screaming started.

And stopped.

Now there’s something circling the hut.

I looked out once.

*Saw hooves.*

And then — Josh.

Or what was left.

**It was holding his head, the flesh scraped clean off his skull.**

*Wearing his skin like a carnival mask.*

The beast looked straight at me, through the slit in the curtain. Through what was left of Josh’s face. 

It grinned. The teeth were sharp and jagged. The mouth was too wide with crooked lips.

*It knows I’m in here.*

The Sherpa’s gone. No idea when he left.

I’m alone now.

I can hear it breathing.

If this posts, tell someone. Or no one. Just don’t come here.

Don’t film the sacred. Don’t turn everything into content.

*Something out here hates to be seen.*

*And it’s wearing the faces of those that disturb it.*
