He is coming. I don’t know when, I don’t know where, or how close he is, but I know that he is coming. I can only run so far before he catches up to me and I have no clue how he’s doing it. I’ve gotten rid of my social medias, my cell phone, computer, everything, but he always finds me. I took a huge risk just coming to the library to type this out. I don’t know how long I have, but I do know that I want to get my story out there so that way when I do turn up somewhere, someone will know where to find me, well whatever is left of me. More importantly, I hope you find him.

 

November 21^(st), 2006

 

I sat at my desk in my warm office typing up the morning reports to send off to my manager. I loved winter way more than I loved summer, but sometimes I just wanted to stay home bundled up in a sweater. It was a quiet morning so far; no customers had signed in and there were no appointments scheduled until later that afternoon and I have to say I was looking forward to catching up on some unfinished work.

Out of habit, I checked our lobby que and saw that there was a man signed in. Of course, as soon as I think that I’m going to get a break. I peeked out into the lobby to get a glimpse of him. Dark brown hair, green eyes, tailored suit. It was like his outfit was made just for him. Mark Schelling was his name, it sounded sophisticated enough in addition to his good looks. No one else was jumping out of their seats to help him so I figured why not bring the handsome guy into my office. I locked my computer and walked out into the lobby to greet him.

“Mark? Hi, I’m Jamie, come on in I’ll be helping you out today.”

He nodded and followed me to my office. I didn’t notice until he stood up, but he was tall, at least 6’2. He walked with a kind of confidence and grace that scared me a little, but man he was far from an eyesore.

“You’re welcome to have a seat Mark, what can I do for you today?”

“Well, I could think of a couple of things that a girl like you could help me with, but I came here today to apply for a car loan.” The way he spoke made butterflies float around in my stomach.

“I’m flattered and I’m glad to help Mark, what kind of car were you looking at?”

“Nothing too fancy, 2006 Aston Martin DB9. Only about $165,000.00”

“Sounds fancy to me.” I giggled.

“Are you laughing at me because you think that I can’t afford it?”

“No not at all, it’s just not your standard car, don’t see too many of those around here. So, let’s get started with the application, are you buying a new or used vehicle?”

“New.” His voice was short and impatient now.

 

After about 30 minutes of inputting information and talking with Mark, I realized how much of a light switch this guy was. He was either completely on, or off and I don’t know if that terrified me or drew me in more. We finally finished up and I gave him my card and my business e-mail in case he had any other questions. I said my goodbyes and promised that I would follow up with him as soon as I heard back with a response from my loan department.

The rest of the day was pretty slow, and I was happy about that. I was actually able to get caught up on that big stack of paper work that had been sitting on my desk for a while. Normally I don’t mix personal tasks with work, but I decided to pop into my e-mail and see if my package had arrived yet. I had just ordered some new shoes and they were supposed to be delivered today.

There was an e-mail from amazon saying that my package was left at the front door, I couldn’t wait to get home and try them on. I was just about to log out when I saw a notification pop up,

**Mark Schelling sent you a new message.**

“What in the world…” I said out loud. I could have sworn that I gave him my business e-mail and not my personal. Well crazier things have happened, maybe I wrote down the wrong one. Some people say that I’m too trusting, but we have to trust in something right? It had only been a couple of hours since he left, and I gave him a 4-business day time frame. I decided to just open it and see what he said.

 

**Jamie –**

**I really enjoyed our meeting this morning, I know that we will have one again soon. I have some other business to take care of in the near future, I will be thinking of you until then.**

 

**With care,**

**m.s**

 

I didn’t reply to Mark. I know that at the time, I wasn’t looking into this as much as I should have, I know I should be more careful, and I know that I should have contacted the police. At the time he didn’t seem like a threat, just a lonely 24-year-old man looking for some excitement in his life, but I wish I would have told someone before now.

 

It seemed like it took way too long for 6PM to come, but it did. I was off of work for the day and walking up the steps to my third-floor apartment. I was getting pretty tired of eating frozen dinners every night, but I was also too lazy to go shopping.

I popped the mac and cheese into the microwave and sat down on the couch, kicking off my heels. Netflix had been calling my name all day and I was ecstatic that I finally could sit down and relax. It was taking forever to load; my internet wasn’t the best so that happened pretty frequently.

In between the silence, I heard my phone chime. When I swiped down to see the notification, it gave me chills.

 

*E-mail notification*

**Mark Schelling sent you a new message.**

 

**J –**

**I like J better than Jamie. You’ll be my J from now on. I can’t stop thinking about how grateful I am for having the chance to work with you. I know you’re thinking about the same thing.**

**With care,**

**m.s**

The crazy thing is, I wasn’t even creeped out at this point. I figured once again, give the guy a break he’s just lonely. God, I am so stupid.

Finally Netflix loaded and I started watching my favorite show The Office. The microwave beeped and I got up to get my food. I scooped my mac n cheese into a bowl, I hadn’t even sat down yet when I heard my phone chime again.

 

**Mark Schelling sent you a new message.**

 

**J –**

 **I can see that you’re opening my messages, are you so busy you can’t reply?**

**With care,**

**m.s**

I know that I’m an idiot, but once again I cracked this up to thinking that maybe his phone showed him when someone opened his message. I continued on with my night and went to sleep.

 

November 27^(th), 2006

I walked into my office and started up my computer. It had been a long weekend and I was ready to just get this Monday over with. I sipped my coffee and logged into my work e-mail. As I was going through my messages, I noticed quite a few from Mark. These were different though. Mark sounded really professional in these and was only inquiring about the loan. Today was the fourth business day and I needed to call him to let him know the result.

I opened up my loan program so I could look into Mark’s file and I wasn’t surprised, his loan was denied due to his debt to income ratio. We had discussed this throughout our conversation, but he just kept telling me that he knew it wouldn’t be a problem. He was unemployed and had been for quite a few years now. I dialed the number on Mark’s profile and waited for an answer. He picked up right away.

 

“Hello J.” His voice was cold and dry.

“Mark, hi this is Jamie. I was calling to speak with you about your loan.”

“Oh wonderful, when can I stop by to fill out the paper work?”

“Actually, Mark, the loan was denied by our back office due to your debt to income ratio being a bit high. I’m sorry that this didn’t work out.”

“J, I have thousands of dollars with you and I’ve been a customer for quite a bit. I think we both know that you can help me out here.”

“I wish that I could, but it’s out of my hands, we can always wait a few months and if something changes maybe we can try again.”

“I am very disappointed in you J. I thought that you were different from the others.”

“Mark, I apologize that we weren’t able to give you the loan, hopefully we’ll see you around again soon.”

“You will see me around again soon J, sooner than you think.”

 

I cannot stress enough how badly I wished that I would have taken him more seriously when I still had a chance, but I didn’t, and it is what it is.

I went about my days as usual, but things seemed off, I guess you could say I felt extremely uncomfortable no matter what I did or where I went. It finally started to get quiet again when something terrifying happened.

 

December 10^(th), 2006

Nights had been cold lately, but this one seemed to be way colder than all of the others. Snow covered the outside of my window, the sky dark and gloomy. I had fallen asleep early, around 8pm which was unusual for me, I hadn’t been getting much sleep at all lately, but I was excited that I had finally seemed to be able to rest. 

A soft knocking noise woke me up around 4:25am, at first I figured it was just a tree branch hitting the window, but then I remembered that I live in an apartment on the third floor. I lied there for a few minutes trying to close my eyes and fall back asleep but at this point it was useless, I was up.

I walked into the kitchen and started a pot of coffee before I turned on the TV. Normally when I can’t sleep I watch Netflix or something to calm my mind, but tonight something was drawing me to the quiet. I plopped back down on my bed and unlocked my phone to scroll through Instagram when I heard something that made me wish I was dreaming. My phone chimed.

 

**Mark Schelling sent you a new message.**

 

**Attached file 62485jpg.**

 

As much as I didn’t want to, I opened the file. It was a video of what looked like a man running through mud in the grass, sloshing and making heavy breathing noises. You could see the snow turn into mush beneath him and mix with the brown earth and his feet slammed on the ground. Something that stood out to me as odd though was that his shoes looked brand new, high end, I couldn’t tell what kind they were though.

The video went on like this for 2 minutes and then cut to black. I didn’t understand why he would send me this video, or what this even meant but all I wanted to do was curl up in my bed and go back to sleep so I could pretend it never happened.

I pulled the covers back up over my body and lied there with my heart beating faster than a speeding bullet. I couldn’t fall back asleep, not after what just happened, but at least I was safe in my bed. I rolled over onto my side facing the window and that’s when I saw him. There was a man peeking his head through the window just starring in at me. I know that there’s no way this was real, how could someone be standing in my window watching me when I’m three stories up? He pulled his phone out of his pocket and began to move his fingers around. When he stopped he looked straight at me.

DING!

 

**Mark Schelling sent you a new message.**

 

**J, you forgot about the coffee.**

 

That was enough to make me thrown on shoes, grab my keys, and drive to my mom’s. I had to be seeing things and maybe being alone was making me feel even more uneasy. The drive seemed longer than normal, it was so hard for me to focus on the road when I kept seeing him out of the corner of my eye. I called my mom to let her know that I was coming and she opened the door for me when I finally arrived. I slept with my mom that night and I was more comfortable then I had been in months.

 

December 20^(th), 2006

 

**Mark Schelling sent you a new message.**

 

**J, I am so excited to give you the Christmas present I got you. I can’t wait to see what you have for me.**

**With care,**

**m.s**

 

That night I had to work late, paper work had piled up at the office again and my boss made it a point that I needed to finish it. We were already closed thankfully, but that just meant the quiet was bound to come after my supervisor Amanda left.

“Jamie are you sure you’ll be alright by yourself?”

“Yes, Amanda I promise I’m fine, just get home to your kids.”

  
“You seem a little off lately, is there something going on?”

“I promise you, everything is great, now go home.”

“Okay, well if you need anything you have my number just be sure to lock up okay?”

“Bye Amanda.”

 

Then the quiet came. I decided that since it was just me I would get out my phone and play some music. I had been really addicted to anything country the past few weeks, so I put on the Garth Brook’s radio station. The first song that played was my favorite, “The Dance.”

After I finally started feeling little relaxed I took a sip of my coffee and started sifting through the mountain of paper work on my desk. Loan applications, new account documents, real estate papers, these were all supposed to be scanned in and e-mailed out. I wasn’t surprised though that someone left it for me to do.

I rolled my eyes and sat back just to hear that same soft knock that I had heard at my window that night. When I looked over to the door way, Mark was standing right in front of me.

“Hey, J.”

“Mark, how did you get in here?”

“I don’t think that’s important, you should be happy to see me.”

“What did you do to Amanda?”

“The same thing that I did to your mom.” He laughed out loud

“Mark what are you talking about?” I yelled as I backed up against the wall

“I have your present dear, I just wanted to see those pretty eyes. Honey listen,” he walked closer and put his hand on my cheek, “all of these people just don’t want us to be together. Your friend tried to call the cops on me, and your mom locked me out. I had to get rid of them, it’s better this way.”  
  
“You’re crazy, get away from me.”

“I’m only crazy over you, J. I always get what I want.”

As he grabbed my arm I used my opposite hand to hit him in the head with the flower vase on my side table. I threw my computer chair at him and ran past to the door way grabbing my keys on the way out. Outside was Amanda, lying in a pool of her own blood, her blonde hair matted and stained. I cried and ran straight to my car and started the ignition. Mark was standing in front of me, smiling.

 

I drove as far as I could, but I still get texts to this day saying how he’ll always find me. He’s gotten close a few times, but now I’m cornered and have now where else to go. If no one else finds me before he does, at least I’ll be able to get this message out there. I know he’s almost here, thank you for listening to my story.

He keeps saying he has a Christmas present for me, he said if I do what he tells me to that I can see my mom and Amanda again.

Please don’t be as trusting as me, please always be careful and aware of your surroundings. I’m an idiot and I lost the two people I loved most in the world, I’m next but at least I’ll get to hug my mom soon.

I have to go, my phone just chimed again.

 

**Mark Schelling sent you a new message.**



**I’m here, J.**
