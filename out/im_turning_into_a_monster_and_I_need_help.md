  

About 5 days ago I found a canaster with something in it that almost looks like the las plagas from re4. For background I found it at this old Wearhouse from the late 40’s to 50’s and apparently “aliens go and do experiments and anal probes on people, the stories the nutjobs tell. Well me, my cousin and my girlfriend and her friend (which is a girl) went to the Wearhouse to get high and while we were stoned off our asses were honestly having a good time telling stories, well if they were stories. Then we see these 4 long skinny black figures almost like Slenderman but just black and a matt type of material we hid in this create but my cousin hid in a barrel the aliens I assumed well what else are they not monkey’s that’s for damn sure. I closed my eyes and covered my girlfriend's mouth, but her friend was gone after what felt like a century then we just hear this loud wind or just an unnatural sounds and noises her we couldn’t find her we just assumed the worse my girlfriend’s parents picked her up and my cousin and I went looking for her couldn’t find her we can’t call the police and say aliens got my friend officer they’ll think were crazy and I found this canaster on the floor I didn’t think much I thought I could clean it up and use it as a drinking bottle.

 I went home and went to sleep the next day rolled around I kept thinking about last night about the 4 slender aliens only an hour until school starts and the canaster is just well it looks weird to me I then got my Chinese kendo knife forged out of a meteorite anyway I tried opening the canaster open nothing, I shake it but see this thing in it. It looks like the las plagas from resident evil I left alone for now probably knowing what it is, but my curiosity got the best of me and well I cracked the glass “holy” I said I got a took the tip out and some liquid sprayed at my face I let out a little scream it was disgusting I got it in my mouth and I nearly vomited I freaked out I put the canister in my drawer and got ready for class.

God almost the whole day I felt sick my girlfriend didn’t come to school she went on a family vacation she said she’ll be back in a week and said her friend is in the hospital apparently, she got hit by a car running away she's probably going to jail from the drugs she took. After school my cousin acted like everything was normal apparently, he didn’t remember that was complete BS I thought. But carried on, back at my house I felt a pain like I never felt, God it hurt so much I drank water, but it burned my tongue what the hell I said. The water stung the crap out of my mouth even when I touch it, I didn’t know what's going on I was so confused I just thought I was just sick or its hot I got the canaster and I kept breaking the little crack I made, and I completely broke open the canaster a little liquid sprayed on me but didn’t hit my face then I heard a sizzle my kendo knife has almost melted well the top part then the liquid popped and it was all over me and my set up, a huge mess to clean up forgetting my water problem.

Its night now it's time for dinner after a nice clean up I got my food and ready to eat when I went to grab some soda in a glass cup but when I went to grab it, I couldn’t believe it only my thumb pointer and middle finger moved normally but my pinky and ring finger didn’t useless basically, didn’t want to cause a since I played it off. When I lifted the glass, I SHATTERED the cup. I was stunned, I cleaned it up and finished my food and went to my room and sat in bed.

 I felt like I needed to throw up I ran and went to the restroom and threw up, but it wasn’t food nor blood, it was this black water with chunks of something. Then I vomited some blood, then my pinky and ring finger were bleeding and wrapped it up with Goz and went to bed. the next day rolled around... and I uh well during math I ask for the nurse after some unfortunate events he let me go and the nurse saw my finger and examined it and what she said scared me to death she said, “hon your fingers feels like there's no bone in it and not to mention they fell like they’ve been detached from your hand”. Once the nurse unwrapped the Goz my pinky falls and onto the hard cold floor, I knew it was cold because well.... I can still feel my fingers. The nurse screamed and called 911, I was sent to the hospital to have these tests on me well on my fingers. The doctors had nothing to tell my mother, I was on my bed after the checkup, and I took a pill that took me right to sleep.

 After what felt like hours of pain, I opened my eyes and stood up to get something. I felt taller and weaker, my head almost touched the ceiling, I couldn't jump. I looked at the mirror and I nearly screamed; my whole body was this weird human-like creature like the aliens in district 9 just their rough skin. I ran out of the house and waved at Mrs. Templeton but see just stared at me didn’t return a wave back everyone stared at me actually and I just ran in the other direction, and someone yelled ALIEN I freaked out and kept running away I dropped my backpack, and I heard what sounded like a gunshot and I just ran faster. I then found this little manhole and went inside and closed it shut I can see in the dark I found radio and its where I'm currently staying right now, I have 78 percent battery typing this. My body changed so much I'm all over the media I'm going to stay here until everything dies down, I don’t know if I'll die in here.

 

Update it’s been 2 months and I’m still the hot news I’ve became global. I only use my phone for news updates, my body changed so much I can’t say. If there’s anyone there someone, please help me. I need to fix THIS, what’s happening to me. There are soldiers are all over in the woods near me as well I don’t know if I’ll-
