I awake to the wet, frantic pulsing of my collection of hearts, each trapped in its iron cage. Veins swell, arteries throb, and blood oozes between the bars like living ink. “Good morning, my loves,” I whisper.

They slam themselves against the cages, screaming without words, leaking devotion and need. Their pulses are frantic, almost unbearable—a symphony of longing and pain. I scowl. I give them scraps, rotting fruit, my leftovers, and expect their worship.

The mirror reveals my reflection. Lumps twist and swell across my flesh, grotesque mountains of uneven meat, rising on my chest, abdomen, arms. I stare, disgust coiling inside me, yet force a brittle smile. “I’m handsome,” I mutter. “Everyone loves me.” A lie spat into the glass.

I move to my pantry, where my fruit glows like jewels. Apples, oranges, exotic berries, and long-skinned melons. I bite. Juice floods my mouth, sticky and sweet. Seeds crush between my teeth. I savor the flavor of beauty that is not mine, consuming pieces of the world as if I can hold it inside me forever.

The fruit nourishes me, but never enough. I scrounge up the scraps I didn’t finish—my crumbs—and return to the cages.

“I brought you food, my loves,” I announce.

The hearts shudder violently, blood dripping from mangled veins. They slam themselves against their bars, grinding teeth and pulsing furiously. I pour the rotting fruit into the cages. Maggots writhe in the juice. The smell of decay clings to my fingers, my skin. They feast, tearing through the pulp with teeth and claws, veins quivering, eyes desperate. I watch, both disgusted and proud. I am their savior and their tormentor.

I dress, layering fabric to hide my lumps, my deformities. Armor against their eyes. Armor against the world. Armor against myself.

The city waits outside, a battlefield of desolation. Streets glimmer with neon like veins, blood-colored and slick with grime. People surge through them, hollow-eyed, lashing out. Loneliness breeds violence here. Fists break flesh, teeth split lips. Screams shatter glass and echo against brick, concrete, steel.

Some claw at one another, desperate for acknowledgment, desperate for proof they exist. Some huddle in packs, laughing too loudly, trembling in terror that their connection is nothing but smoke. Others vanish into screens, faces slack, pupils dilated, corpses masquerading as life. And everywhere, ghosts shuffle, faces down, terrified of touch, terrified of attention, terrified of themselves.

All of it—the fighting, the shouting, the clawing—is born of emptiness. Loneliness spills outward, becomes chaos, becomes war. And I walk among them, untouched, a predator of devotion, yet aching in my chest for someone to crave me as I crave their adoration.

And then I see her.

In a rose garden, a small oasis of color amid the gray rot of the city, she crouches among the blooms. Her hair is fire and frost, glimmering, impossibly bright against the decay. Her skin is etched with scars—pale ribbons of past pain—but her glowing healing hand reaches for a rose.

She pricks herself. Blood blossoms across her fingers. She winces, recoiling, then reaches again. Thorns pierce her flesh a second, a third time. Her wrists drip crimson, yet she does not stop.

I step forward, my heart thrumming, rage and fascination tangling into a single coil. I grab her wrist too hard.

“Ow!”

“You’re hurting yourself,” I snap. Anger spikes, volcanic and raw. My chest pounds. Why feel pain when I have given you care? Why falter when I am trying to keep you alive? Her trembling, her sorrow—it rips me in half. Confusion surges into fury.

Her eyes meet mine. Wide, trembling, full of sorrow. “Why won’t they accept me?”

“They don’t like people like us,” I mutter, kneeling. Tweezers in hand, I begin to pull thorns from her wrists, her blood slicking my fingers, sticky and warm. My frustration flares. Her neediness, her vulnerability, enrages me. How can someone feel this much and still look at me as if I am the answer?

I feel it—a spark of empathy, hot and sudden, like acid in my chest—but only because my anger burns too brightly to contain. I work with precision, pulling each thorn, my fingers coated in her blood, the smell of iron thick and sweet. I am careful. Reluctant. Detached. Yet somehow, in the storm of my own rage, I care.

She looks at me, wide-eyed, trembling. “No one has ever done this for me,” she whispers. “You healed me. “

Confusion fractures into pride, then into a hollow relief that almost shames me. Finally. Someone sees me. Someone craves what I give, even if it is scraps, even if it is only pieces of fruit and thorns pulled from her skin.

I reach into my pocket, offering one of my ripest fruits. She hesitates, trembling. Hunger betrays her. She bites. Juice floods her mouth, bright as blood, sweet and sticky. She devours it. I watch, and my chest twists, a knot of frustration and longing.

“What?” I snap, voice rough and ragged. Rage blooms again. Confusion. Her trembling. Her vulnerability. It enrages me, and yet pierces me, a blade through my ribs.

“It’s just… no one has ever done anything like that for me,” she whispers. Tears streak her cheeks. “You fixed my wounds. You fed me.”

I collapse briefly into pride and hollow relief. Finally, someone sees me. Someone desires what I hoard.

I embrace her. Her tears soak into my chest. My own heart pounds in chaotic rhythm, echoing the caged ones at home, the ones I feed scraps to and ignore.

“I have more fruit at home,” I murmur, lowering my voice so the world around us cannot overhear. “Would you like to come by?”

She freezes, as though caught between terror and longing. Then she looks up at me, her lips trembling into something like a smile.

“I would be honored,” she says.

We walk together to my home. Her scars glimmer under the streetlights like silver threads, stitched across flesh. She walks with quiet resolve, her eyes full of sorrow but also… recognition. She sees me. She shouldn’t, but she does.

At the door, I stop her. “Wait. I must clean up.”

Her brow furrows, confusion soft in her expression. But I do not explain. I slip inside, leaving her on the doorstep.

My house breathes like a rotting lung. The stench hits me immediately—blood, mold, the damp sweetness of fruit left too long to fester. My ears fill with the frantic hammering of my caged hearts. They pound against iron, raw muscle slamming, veins bursting, blood spraying through cracks. The cages rattle like the bones of starving animals.

I grunt in frustration, pressing my palms to my ears. “Didn’t I just feed you? How much more do you want?”

The hearts answer with convulsions. Arteries split open, spraying the floor. Teeth sprout along their veins, gnashing, desperate for anything I will not give. Their need sickens me. Their devotion sickens me. Their very existence sickens me. Yet I cannot let them go. I cover the cages with a blanket, muffling their screams. “Quiet. You’ll ruin everything.”

I return to her, my disgust hidden behind a smile. She waits patiently, as if used to being abandoned, as if loneliness is her constant companion. When I open the door, she gives me a small smile. It pierces me deeper than any thorn.

Inside, I show her my fruit. Bouquets piled high, gleaming like severed organs polished to perfection. Apples split open, glistening like exposed lungs. Grapes burst like clusters of eyes. Melons bleed when sliced. Beauty, grotesque and shimmering.

We feast. Juice runs down our chins, stains our hands, drips down to our elbows. We laugh, though our laughter sounds like coughing up blood. We gorge ourselves until the room reeks of sweetness, sickly, unbearable, intoxicating.

For a moment, I think: I could live like this forever. Feeding her. Being seen by her. Drowning in this communion of rot and sweetness.

Then her gaze lingers. Too long. Too deep.

The sleeve of my shirt slips. A lump juts from my arm, a twisted tumor of flesh, a mountain of grotesque muscle and skin. I snatch the fabric up, face burning with shame.

“I know already,” she says softly.

My breath stops.

She reaches, pulls the sleeve down herself, staring at the lump with no fear, no disgust. Her eyes are calm, almost mournful. Then, slowly, she bends her head and presses her lips against it.

Kisses it.

Once. Twice. Again.

Each touch burns through me, my skin aflame where her mouth lingers. My chest tightens. No one has ever kissed my deformities. No one has ever touched the parts of me I loathe. My heart, deep within me, begins to thrash, pounding against my ribs like it wants out.

She looks up at me, tears clinging to her lashes. “You don’t have to hide.”

My throat closes. For a moment, I cannot breathe.

And then—her hand moves to my chest. Her glowing healing hand. It presses hard, harder, until it breaks through skin. My flesh splits, ribs crack, bones crunch. She pushes deeper, deeper, until her hand is inside me. Blood gushes hot, my scream choking in my throat.

But I don’t care. For the first time, I don’t care.

She touches my heart. Rubs it, tender, gentle. It thrashes against her palm like a terrified animal, but she soothes it, whispers to it without words. For the first time in forever, I let someone in.

And then—her grip tightens.

My ribs creak and snap as she clenches my heart, nails digging into its slick flesh. A scream rips from my throat, guttural and raw, but she only laughs—a sound too wide, too jagged, splitting the air like broken glass.

I thrash, choking on blood, yet my legs buckle beneath me. I am caught, tethered to her hand buried in my chest. My vision flickers with black stars as I gasp, “Please… don’t…”

Her smile is feral now. Her face stretches, jaw unhinging too far, her teeth like thorns, like shards of bone. “You let me in,” she whispers, voice sweet as poison. “Now you can’t take it back.”

With one violent jerk, she yanks my heart from my chest.

It comes free in a flood of gore, tearing veins like snapped ropes, ripping arteries that spray the walls in crimson arcs. My body convulses, collapsing to the floor, ribs protruding through torn skin, my chest cavity an open, steaming wound.

She holds my heart high, still pulsing, veins dangling like roots ripped from the earth. It beats frantically in her grip, as if it knows it has been stolen. Blood spatters her face, her glowing hand drenched in me.

I crawl forward, teeth grinding, fingers clawing at the floorboards. My voice is broken, hoarse. “Wait… please…”

She steps back, her eyes gleaming with something inhuman. Then, slowly, she turns. My heart still thrashes in her fist.

The cages rattle.

The covered hearts inside sense her, sense the fresh meat she holds. Their pounding grows deafening, like war drums. The blanket slips, revealing their twisted forms. Each cage is slick with blood and bile. Hearts sprout teeth, gnash with hunger. Veins twist into claws that scrape the iron. They shriek without mouths, a chorus of endless craving.

“No…” I croak, dragging myself toward her, smearing blood behind me. “Not them… not with them…”

But it’s too late.

She presses my heart against the cage, and the imprisoned ones surge, wrapping veins around it like chains. They yank it inside, tearing through the bars to drag it into their grotesque prison. My heart shrieks as their teeth sink in, blood spraying. They devour it, cage rattling, veins thrashing, until it is one of them—another captive in my collection.

She turns to me then, lips curling into a smirk. “Now you’re mine. Forever. You can never leave.”

My body convulses, blood pouring from my mouth. My vision dims, black encroaching. The last thing I see is her silhouette standing before the cage, my stolen heart pulsing inside, shackled among the others.

And then I collapse. My body leaks its last blood, twitching, until nothing remains but a husk.

Darkness swallows me whole.
