Three years ago, a man moved into the apartment next to mine. Unit 304.

He never came out.

No packages, no visitors, no noise. Just the occasional flicker of light under his door and the faint smell of burnt plastic that seeped through the thin walls every now and then.

I live in a rundown building downtown. You hear everything here—arguments, coughing fits, people dragging furniture at 3 a.m. But from 304? Silence. Total silence. The kind that makes your skin itch.

For the first year, I figured he was just some recluse. Maybe working from home. Maybe paranoid. I even tried knocking once, just to say hi. No answer.

Then, two years in, things got weird.

Sometimes I’d wake up to see my hallway light on. I never leave it on. Once, I found the deadbolt on my door unlocked. Another time, my TV had switched to static in the middle of the night—and stayed that way until I unplugged it.

I joked with my friend Jenna that maybe 304 was haunted. She laughed and said, “More like your neighbor’s got a screw loose.”

But last week, Jenna went missing.

She was supposed to come over to watch a movie. She texted me from the lobby: “Here.” I buzzed her in.

She never made it upstairs.

Security checked the cameras. She walked into the building… and then nothing. No footage of her leaving. No trace.

Just gone.

⸻

I didn’t sleep that night. I kept staring at my wall. The one that separates my bedroom from 304.

At 3:17 a.m., I heard it.

A knock.

Not from the door.

From inside the wall.

Three sharp knocks.

Then a pause.

Then three more.

I sat there frozen, holding my breath. My pulse loud in my ears.

I knocked back.

One. Two. Three.

Nothing.

Then suddenly—

KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK.

Faster. Harder. Like fists slamming against the drywall.

I jumped out of bed and turned on every light. Pressed my ear against the wall.

Silence again.

But I swear I heard breathing. Heavy. Ragged.

Coming from inside.

⸻

The next morning, I went to the front desk. Asked about 304.

The clerk, an old man who’s worked here forever, gave me a strange look.

“304’s been empty for years,” he said.

“No one’s lived there since that guy died.”

I stared at him. “What guy?”

He looked uncomfortable. “Young guy. Techy type. Moved in a few years ago. Complained about weird signals or something. They found him dead in the shower. Heart attack, they said.”

“But someone’s in there now,” I insisted.

He shook his head. “Nope. We sealed it after the cleanup. No one’s rented it since.”

I walked away feeling like I’d swallowed ice.

⸻

That night, I sat in the dark with a flashlight and my phone camera. I pointed it at the wall. I recorded. I waited.

And at exactly 3:17 a.m., it happened again.

KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK.

This time, I was ready. I pressed record. Whispered into the mic, “Are you in there?”

A pause.

Then—faint, but clear—came the reply:

“Help.”

I froze. My phone slipped from my hand onto the mattress.

“Who are you?” I whispered.

No answer.

I stood, heart pounding, and gently pressed my palm against the wall.

It was warm.

Too warm.

Like something was breathing on the other side.

The next morning, I tried again to talk to the front desk. But the old man wasn’t there. A younger woman was on shift. I asked her about unit 304.

She typed something into her computer, frowned, then shook her head.

“There is no 304,” she said.

I blinked. “What?”

“Building ends at 303. See?” She turned the monitor toward me. A list of units popped up. 301, 302, 303… then 305. No 304 in between.

I was stunned. I pulled out my phone and showed her a photo I had taken last month—the hallway, my door, and right next to it, 304.

She frowned. “That’s not on file. Maybe old numbering before the renovation.”

But I’d lived here four years. There was never a renovation.

Something was wrong.

⸻

That night, I couldn’t sleep again.

3:17 a.m.

The knock came. Three times.

Then the voice again.

“Help me. Please.”

This time I didn’t hesitate.

I grabbed a hammer from under my sink. Walked to the wall.

And I started hitting it.

Over and over, punching through drywall. Dust filled the air. My hands shook. I tore through the insulation, wires, until finally—

A hollow space.

I pointed my flashlight in.

A narrow crawlspace stretched between the walls.

And at the end of it… something moved.

I squeezed inside, dragging myself over splintered wood and metal. My flashlight flickered.

The space got tighter. I had to crawl on my stomach. The air smelled of mold and something worse—rot.

Then I saw her.

Jenna.

Huddled against the corner, shaking, eyes wide. She looked thin, pale, like she hadn’t seen sunlight in days.

“Jenna!” I whispered.

She reached for me, tears in her eyes.

“Shhh,” she mouthed. “He’s still here.”

Behind me, something moved.

A low, wet scraping sound.

I turned.

And I saw him.

Or what was left of him.

The man from 304. His face… wasn’t a face anymore. Skin melted, twisted, lips stitched together crudely. Eyes wide open, bloodshot. His body dragged itself forward like a broken puppet.

I screamed.

⸻

Jenna pushed me forward. “Go! Go!”

We scrambled back through the tunnel. I could hear him behind us. Crawling, growling. My flashlight flickered and died.

We burst out through the hole I’d made and collapsed on my floor. I kicked drywall back into place, breathing hard.

Silence.

No more knocking.

Just silence.

⸻

I didn’t sleep for the next two nights.

Neither did Jenna. She stayed with me, refusing to go to the police, insisting they wouldn’t believe us. I couldn’t argue. Hell, I barely believed it myself.

We both tried to pretend it was over.

But the wall disagreed.

On the third night, the knocks returned.

But they weren’t from inside 304.

They came from my closet.

Three knocks.

I opened the door slowly, heart in my throat. Empty. Just clothes. Boxes. Dust.

Then I looked up.

A vent I’d never noticed before.

It was open.

I climbed onto a chair and peered in. A small tunnel. Metal-lined. Big enough for someone thin to crawl through.

A whisper floated out.

“You didn’t finish it.”

I staggered back.

Jenna ran to me. “What did it say?”

I didn’t answer. I couldn’t.

That night, we packed bags. We planned to leave, get as far from the building as we could. But when we opened the front door—

The hallway was gone.

In its place: a long corridor, dimly lit, with dozens of identical doors. Each numbered 304.

Endless.

I slammed the door shut.

We were trapped.

⸻

We tried the window. Outside, the city looked… wrong.

Like a photograph of the city, slightly blurred and warped. No cars moved. No people. Just flickering lights and buildings too tall to be real.

“Is this still our world?” Jenna whispered.

I didn’t know what to say.

Then came the voice again.

From every wall.

“Iteration failed. Restarting.”

Everything went dark.

⸻

When I woke up, I was in my bed.

Alone.

Back in my room. Regular hallway. My real building.

No Jenna.

No holes in the wall.

I ran to the front desk. The old man was there again.

I asked him about Jenna.

“No one by that name in this building,” he said.

I showed him pictures.

He looked confused. “Who is that?”

Her number was gone from my phone.

Our messages—gone.

All evidence of her… deleted.

Like she never existed.

⸻

But I remember her.

I remember the knock.

I remember the tunnel.

And every night since, at exactly 3:17 a.m., I hear it again.

Three knocks.

Always three.

No one believes me. I tried posting online. My posts disappear. I tried moving out—lease denied. Tried quitting my job—HR says I was never employed.

Something is keeping me here.

Something is rewriting my reality.

And I think I know why.

⸻

Just now, I found a file on my computer called “Iteration_035.txt.”

I didn’t create it.

Inside was a log. Every word I’ve written here. Word for word.

At the bottom, a line in red:

“Subject is beginning to suspect. Prepare reset.”

If I don’t post this now, I may forget again.

If you’re reading this—

Listen closely.

If you ever hear knocking in the walls at 3:17 a.m.…

Do not answer.

Do not reply.

And whatever you do—

Don’t remember.
