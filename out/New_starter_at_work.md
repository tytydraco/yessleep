So for context, I (M25) was a Duty Manager at a golf and leisure club here in Oxfordshire, England. 
My early shifts start at 5:30, though I always arrive at 5:00 as it’s much easier to get everything done. 

I am the first onsite. I am the key holder and only one with an alarm code on these shifts until other departmental managers start arriving throughout the morning. 

I arrive at work, ready to turn immediately left to turn the alarm panel off after getting through both doors. There was no need this day. The alarms hadn’t been set on the night before. The cleaners are responsible for this, and left a note outlining that it had been broken, or I assume it was them. 

As I am reading this note I hear something from the reception seating area behind me. I don’t look at first, there would be no point anyway, it’s pitch black before I turn the lights on, I simply say, fairly tired still, say loudly to what I reasonably believed to be an empty room (
“if you’re here to kill me, you better hope you do it quickly, today is not the f*cking day.” 

After a couple of seconds someone steps into the light and says “wouldn’t be good to kill the person who’s training me would it?” 

I laughed with him at first before thinking, how the hell did he get in?

Now, working in this building, I know many points are so easy to get into from the outside there is no use locking them (I’m often having to close the doors after a windy night by the indoor pool) but there is no reason he would know that, and also no reason to arrive 30 mins early when he knew from our comms I may not even arrive at the building until 5:15 if it’s a quiet day ahead, but there he was, now visible from the moonlight. 

I didn’t let it shake me for long and went about showing him our opening procedures as he would be working in the same job role as me. Throughout the day he would let slip bits of information about me nobody should know, and then use the excuse that he knew a few close friends and I “shouldn’t be so trusting.” That much was becoming clear. 

As I introduced him to his new coworkers, he knew their names before I’d even managed to say them, and we don’t wear badges, so it’s just bizarre. 

This thing about spilling secrets wasn’t just reserved to me, but to everyone on my team. 

It was starting to get very worrying. 

A few mornings later he was fully trained and so the next morning he would take on his own, and I would work the closing shift from 14:00-22:30. He left at 14:15 and I went about my normal shift. 

As I was closing down, I finish off with the pool area, as is the order of things. There in the darkness stands a silhouette of a 5’10 ish male, and it’s him again. He makes me jump, but I walk over, open the door and let him in, he smiles, clearly trying to be disarming but it just makes me tense. He says he left something in his locker but couldn’t get in as I had locked the door. I remind him he now has his own key, and also managed to get in somehow just a few days before without one. I will point out I clearly came off as pretty annoyed. He stumbled through an excuse and moved on through the building to his locker. 

As I leave he appears again, offering a lift home, I wrongfully provide him with the words “oh it’s alright, but thank you. I only live next door” and next door is the collection of large detached houses, one of the 5 is mine, where I live with my family. Just minutes after I arrive home, a car parks at the end of my street, I am at the other end, a dead end. 

He shouts up to my bedroom “sorry to creep you out mate” and I go downstairs, angrily, and visibly armed with my own golf club, demanding that he leave and speak no more of my life, nor show up at my house. He gets in his car silently and goes. 

Two hours later, he appears again, with a ladder, peering through my bedroom window. This time I open the window, and push him off. Wrong to do, I get arrested he gets hospitalised but refuses to press charges, so I do too. 

He gets fired and I handed in my notice after being headhunted by a large Manor House hotel further into the Cotswolds. 

One night I stayed over, and he photographed my partner, and my young baby. What was shocking, is that it appeared to be from inside the house. I phone home and receive no answer, so run to my car and race home, to find my wife, and baby safe, seemingly. As I walk to see their faces and talk to them, I see he has taken my partners face, or my now late partner I should add, and replaced his own with it. With his old face, he makes a mask for baby, saying how “he’s always wanted a family like this. Look at the baby, he looks just like me doesn’t he” I feel violently sick, I couldn’t move to kill him but my god I wish I had. He walks over to me, kisses me with my wife’s face, and holds me as I throw up. I don’t know what to do. I feel trapped here. He comes with me to work daily. I’m terrified.
