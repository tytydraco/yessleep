Today, I'm on a flight flying from Dallas, Texas, to Albuquerque, New Mexico. The weather isn't the best, but I need to visit my father who is in the hospital, fighting for his life. I was contacted by his medical team saying that his health had declined overnight and might not see his upcoming birthday. Devastating, I know. Cancer sucks. 

But I don't know if I'll be able to reach him on time. You see, the passenger beside me is dead. Not as in dead asleep, but actually, dead. I thought he had just fallen asleep and rested his head on my shoulder, but there was no warmth to him. Talk about a cold shoulder.

And this guy isn't even old enough to pass away—so suddenly. He appears to be in his thirties, like me, and handsome. Several flight attendants had glanced at us before, but not in a way that they looked at everyone else. I don't know if it was something the gentleman was served or anything, but whatever the cause of his death is will have to be investigated.

“Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. We're twenty minutes out from Albuquerque, New Mexico, but we're going to experience some brief turbulence. Please fasten your seat belts.” 

The sign above our heads turns on, and people start fastening their seat belts. Naturally, I began panicking because the guy beside me had no seatbelt on. 

Should I fasten it for him? How bad will the turbulence be? These thoughts begin to prick my mind the tighter I adjust my seat belt. The worst-case scenario is that people discover that the passenger is dead, and we have an emergency landing where I'm taken into custody. Or, we do the emergency landing, and I have to be held up at the airport before I can catch another flight to see my father. 

Either way, I'm completely screwed. Everyone will look to me first as the culprit when I'm just as confused and clueless as everyone else. But I have a plan to avoid all of this. 

When we land, I'll be the first off the plan. I'm hoping to be out of the airport before they even discover the dead body. It's not like I'm the Flash but I was good in track and field back in high school, then again, I'd look guilty if I left so abruptly. 

The aircraft shakes with low momentum, and the weight on my shoulder drops into my lap. Well, shit. Now I have an audience from the people sitting in the row across from us. A family of three. Father, mother, and teenage boy.

They're the first to witness this dead body being thrown around like a rag doll aside from me. But they won't know he's dead if I just play it off. 

I mouth the word ‘sorry’, and try to help the man sit upright before fastening the seat belt around his waist.

The family of three continues to watch me try my best to play off this whole fiasco, meanwhile, I'm sweating bullets—losing my patience with this dead weight. But in the end, when the turbulence had halted, they didn't say anything to me. Instead, they called over one of the flight attendants and they all looked at me—cautiously. Then I knew I was in deep shit.

Once we landed in Albuquerque, the captain announced for everyone to remain seated. It'd been fifteen minutes since he said so, and my heartbeat was continuously thumping so loud in my ears that I could barely remember what I had for breakfast. Knowing that it was possibly the last tasty meal I'd eaten before going to jail.

“Mr. Holten?” The flight attendant from before comes up to me, followed by two police officers. 

I burst into a fit of tears, hysterical at this point. Begging for them not to take me away, pleading my innocence. I don't care if people were staring, or recording, but I wouldn’t want this all to end in some false accusations.

“Oh, please don't take me away! I swear I don't know how he died, you have to believe me! He must’ve taken something from you! You're the one who poisoned him!” I pointed my finger like a child.

“Mr Holten!” She raises her voice at me. “Do you know where you are right now?”

I look around and see people watching. “Yes, we're in Albuquerque, New Mexico.” I start to calm myself. “I'm here to visit my father. He's sick in hospital, I can't go to jail, lady.”

“Very good. I understand your situation so would you kindly follow the police so you may be escorted off the flight?” The flight attendant gestures towards the two policemen.

I shook my head. “I can't go to jail. I have to see my father.”

The people watching start to murmur amongst themselves. So I turn to the people behind me. “You believe me, right?! I didn't kill him! I didn't kill this man!”

The people cowered as I spoke. And the last thing I knew, I was being detained and walked off the plane in handcuffs. “No! You can't take me away! I'm innocent! Daddy, I want to see you! I want to see my daddy!” I wail.

Seated in the row across from Mr Holten, the teenage boy looks down at his cell phone staring at the missing person's notice. Posted just a few hours before take off.
