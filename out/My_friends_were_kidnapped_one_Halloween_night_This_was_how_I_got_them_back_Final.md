It just stood in the field, about 10 or 12 feet away from me, staring me down with two crimson beads. Funny enough, I could somehow feel its rage toward me, feeling the heat from its glare alone. I don’t understand, even now, but it’s true, that’s exactly how it felt!  
I swung my head around to look behind and saw three others, all standing about 50 or so feet in the distance, all glaring at me like the one in front of me was. My grip around the rake tightened, causing it to tremble in my hands. I didn’t know what to do, whether to move, just make a break for it, or stay put and see what they’d do.  
I didn’t have to wait long to figure this out, though, as the former became apparent when I saw them all mysteriously vanish. How they did it or where exactly they went, I couldn’t tell you, and I sure as hell didn’t care enough, either. All I knew was, as long as I hauled ass back to the car, I could still get out of there alive.  
The next 3 seconds were a blur, with me finding myself at the car a lot quicker than I thought I would be. I remember, though, that out of the corner of my left eye, I could see one of the figures rushing towards me, and I could swear I heard someone or something hissing the word “Harvessssttt”.  
Again, I couldn’t be sure, especially with the way the wind had picked up, but that’s what I’m pretty sure I heard, and I knew it came from their direction. Regardless, I made it back to the car and hopped right in the driver’s seat. Fortunately, in his panic, Norman hadn’t taken his keys out of the ignition, allowing me to just turn the engine over and gun it out of there. Both adrenaline, and a bit of the lingering booze from earlier, made my usually impeccable driving much more hectic. I was swerving and swaying all over the fuckin’ place, which made me thank God that A, no one else seemed to be out that morning, and B, that that also included cops.  
I was speeding all the way up until I saw the sign entering uptown, where I finally got myself to slow the fuck down again. By the time I made it back home, I could see the light already starting to bleach the formerly pitch dark sky. I ran straight inside, locked my doors, turned on all my lights, and pulled a chair up to the door, looking out of the front window with my Louisville Slugger and the book in hand.  
There, I began flipping through the book, darting my eyes back and forth between it and the window. Most of the contents were just more of the same weird-ass drawings from the farmhouse, though looking at them a little more carefully, I recognized a few of the symbols as being some of those “Runes” that my cousin always talked about with me on the holidays. She runs a metaphysical shop somewhere here in the uptown area here in Ol’ Willow, so of course she’d know all about that sort of thing.  
Of course, that didn’t mean I knew a damn bit of what they meant. Along with all of this, though, were weird messages that looked like whoever wrote them did so in a hurry, so much so that more than half the shit was illegible. Just about the only thing I could make out was the following phrase, repeated over and over and over again:  
“One for the harvests.”  
With each of these messages was one of two drawings, either the plant lady I mentioned see earlier in the farmhouse, or a picture of one of the figures, a tall, dark, hooded looking figure that looked a lot to me like someone was trying to draw the Nazgul from Lord of the Rings. Aside from the other phrase I was talking about, I also remember reading things to the effect of “The Harvest Mother provides, and must be provided for in return.”  
They didn’t all say that, not exactly anyways, but close enough, and each one of them kept making mention of this “Harvest Mother”, who it didn’t take me long to realize was the plant lady drawn on the pages. It was honestly starting to freak me out, all the shit that was written about in this journal, dedicated solely to the “Harvest Mother”. Whoever wrote this book was obsessed with her, worshipped her, sacrificing live animals to and even sacrificing her own fucking life to her when she apparently couldn’t provide an offering to her.  
Understand this, okay? I grew up in a conservative Christian home. Church every Sunday morning, fellowship every Wednesday night, and even family-sanctioned bible studies on Fridays. My cousin, in fact, was the only one of us who wasn’t a believer, which was why I only talked to her on holidays, having been ostracized by the rest of the family. Now, since my youth, I slowly drifted away from my faith myself, but not that far, not to anything like this degree of occultism.  
Being, though, that she was the only one I figured would actually have any idea about any of this shit, and therefore the only one who might be able to help me get both answers and my friends back, if they were even alive. Setting the book aside and continuing to keep my eyes on the window, I dialed up my cousin.  
\-- “Hello?”  
\-- “Hey, Valerie, it’s me, Brad.”  
\-- “Oh hey, what’s up?”  
\-- “Listen, I hate that I’m having to call you this late, but how quick can you get over here?”  
\-- “Um… I don’t know, like, 10 minutes, why?”  
\-- “Look, there’s been a situation and I need your help. It’s something I think only you could help me with.”  
\-- “You need another fortune reading again?”  
\-- “No, but it’s something along those lines. I can explain when you get here.”  
\-- “Um, yeah, okay. I’m coming now.”  
\-- “Thank you so much!”  
\-- “Yeah, see you in five.”  
We hung up after that, where I just sat, staring out the window with my bat raised. Obviously the paranoia was fucking with my head, but I could’ve almost sworn, several times, that I saw two or three of them, standing across the street, staring me down through the window. Funny enough, I guess, I damn near jumped up and sprang out the door, swinging the bat, when I saw two red lights coming right for the house, when I calmed down and realized it was just my cousin.  
I hastily let her in and bolted the door shut again. “Yo, Brad, what’s going on?” she asked after I essentially jerked her in the house. I looked at her, no doubt with the expression of a deranged lunatic plastered all across my face. “You look awful, what happened?”  
“Val…” I began, trailing off, picking up the book. “It’s my friends, they… they took them.”  
“They?” She frowned. “Who’s ‘They’?”  
I opened my mouth, but for a second, my lower jaw just hung there, trying, it seemed, to just fall right off my face altogether. My tongue was at least 150 lbs in my mouth. It took me a second to realize, but I wasn’t even breathing. My mind had managed to hold it all together for so long, that it just couldn’t go on any longer. My head felt light.  
I began to sway a bit. Valerie moved to catch me right as I was about to collapse. She caught me and dragged me to the couch. She laid me down and ran to the kitchen, bringing back a glass of water. “Here, drink this and breathe.”  
I did as she said and slowly, my breathing and my wits both returned to normal. “Feel better?” she asked.  
“Sure,” I replied, unconvinced.  
“Now, what’s going on?”  
I proceeded then to tell her everything I’m telling here: the party, Ethan’s idea, and of course, the figures in the farmland. It was when I started bringing up the last part that she frowned in an alarming way at me, her eyes 2 seconds from shooting out like bullets at me. I pointed at the book and told her how I’d found it in the farmhouse. She picked it up and started skimming through it.  
“There’s this thing apparently called “The Harvest Mother”, who the author worshiped. Is this one of those Gods you know about?”  
“‘Harvest Mother’? No, I don’t think so. I don’t remember anyone like that, but I’d need to look again to be sure.” She closed the book and looked at me again. “So exactly what is it you want me to do here?”  
“Well…” I pointed again at the book. “I remember those symbols, you told me, were used in Witchcraft practices, so I thought, you know, you’d be able to tell me what any of that meant and who or what these guys were.”  
“I could take a closer look at it at my place, sure, but it wouldn’t be tonight.”  
“How come?”  
“Well, besides the fact that it’s damn near 3 in the morning now, already a bad time for shit like this, I’d need to talk to some of the others in my circle about this, and see what they think as well.”  
“Okay, so how long do you think it’d be before you’d be able to look at it?”  
“It’d probably be a week or two, depending on how easy it is for me to contact them.”  
I sighed and she shrugged. “Alright,” I conceded. “Just try to make it as soon as possible, okay? It wouldn’t be so bad, but there’s lives who might hang in the balance here, okay?”  
She held up her hands and said “Okay, okay, like I said, let me take this,” she picked up the book and headed toward the door, “and I’ll see what I can come up with.”  
“Thanks so much, Val. I’ll owe you one.” She laughed at this and said she’ll hold me to that promise, before leaving. I was alone then.  
The next few days were spent, more or less, in a constant flop-sweat. Every night, I kept having the same nightmare, where all three of them were screaming at me to save them. I’d always see them in the middle of this black void, surrounded by a bunch of plants. I’d watch the plants swallow them whole just before waking up.  
It got so bad, I ended up having to call out of work for at least two days, just so I could sleep in during the day to make up for it all. I was seriously about to consider picking up some heavy sleep meds on that Friday when I finally got the call from Valerie.  
\-- “Hey so, I was able to get a few of the others in the circle to look at this book here and, uh… Well, all I can say is, you’ve really gotten yourself in it this time, haven’t you?”  
\-- “Okay, so, what, you find something, didn’t find anything, what’s the deal?”  
\-- “Oh, we found something alright. You and your little pals apparently seemed to piss off an ancient Goddess.”  
\-- “What so you mean?”  
\-- “You and your buds chose the worst time to try and go fuckin’ around that place. See,”The Harvest Mother” demands sacrifices each day to sustain the earth, right?”  
\-- “Um, sure, whatever.”  
\-- “Well, on nights like Samhain or Walpurgisnacht, her demand for fresh offerings is essentially increased, due to the nature of the energy needed for her to keep the soil healthy through the winter months for the next spring. Increased demands mean anyone that treads there is fair game at nighttime.”-- “Hold on, okay, so you’re telling me my friends were sacrificed to this thing, this Goddess or whatever?”  
\-- “Yes.”  
\-- “So, what, there’s no way to get them back?”  
\-- “Not really, unless…”  
\-- “Unless what?”  
The line went silent for a good ten to 15 seconds before she came back.  
\-- “Unless you’re willing to provide your own offering.”-- “‘My own offering’? What do you mean, like a sacrifice or something?”  
\-- “Yes.”  
\-- “Okay, so, what, I have to find a stray cat or something and bring it over to the farm and say “Here, take this and let me have my friends back’?”  
\-- “Close, but if you’re trying to get your friends back, a cat won’t do you a whole lot of good. It’s essentially an equal exchange type of deal here.”  
\-- “I don’t understand.”  
\-- “They took human lives, which are more potent to her than animals, and so if you’re wanting to bargain for their lives, then you’ll have to make an offer with--”  
\-- “Wait a minute, you’re telling me I have to sacrifice other people?! What the fuck?!”  
\-- “It’s the only way, Brad, I’m sorry.”  
\-- “Are you sure? Maybe there’s some way to force her to give them back or something? Maybe I could trick her, you know, maybe use a--”  
\-- “Brad, we’re talking about an ancient Goddess, a literal force for nature, dude. How exactly do you plan to “force” or “trick” the Harvest Mother?”  
\-- “So I have to become a murderer? You’re telling me to become a murderer?”  
\-- “I’m going to be honest here, Brad. The only reason I’m trying to tell you any of this is because I know you care about your friends. Honestly, I’d personally tell you to chalk them up as good as gone, for more than one reason.”  
\-- “Like what?”  
\-- “Well, to start, you’re not of the craft, which is what got you in this sitch in the first place, fuckin’ around with shit you never understood. Second, because, with as much time that’s passed, yeah, I can’t guarantee even doing this much would do you any good.”  
\-- “So… I mean, what am I supposed to do here?”  
\-- “Like I just said, the only real shot you got here at this is to make an offering to the “Harvest Mother’.”  
\-- “How do I do that? I mean, I can’t just--”  
\-- “I’m sorry Brad, I have to go. Look um… I’m gonna try and send some energy to you to help you, but as far as this goes, I’ve told you all I know to do. I’m sorry, but that really is all I’ve got.”  
\-- “O-Okay…”  
\-- “Good luck, take care of yourself.”  
\-- “Yeah, you too. Bye.”  
After we hung up, I just sat there, shaking more violently than I ever had in my entire life. That was it, I was screwed!  
I had to either sacrifice another innocent person, or I had to live with my friends being sacrificed themselves, and that was just if they hadn’t already been. And Valerie was right, it was my fault, not knowing what it was we were dealing with. Sure, Ethan came up with the idea, and both me and Norman had tried to talk him out of it, but I… I don’t know, I guess I should’ve been able to do more, you know? Not to mention, none of that would’ve happened at all, if I’d just planned out another Dorm party like I always had.  
I loved my friends, but…  
But how could I become a murderer for them?  
This question alone damn near had me having to check myself into the hospital for a couple of days. If I thought the night terrors I mentioned before were bad, they were nothing compared to the ones I was experiencing this time around. It was on one particularly bad, sleepless night, that I finally came up with a plan.  
The next morning, I made a post on F.B. that, more or less, told the events of that night, highlighting the fact that my three friends were missing, and that I needed someone, anyone, who was willing to help me find them. To be perfectly honest, I didn’t expect really anything to come out of this effort. I expected a lot of people to either tell me I was full of shit, tell me to check the next town over, or to just call the cops, and sure, there were one or two that did tell me to try that, there were actually two or three who said they’d do it.  
Please, before I say anything further, understand that this was not at all an easy thing to do for me. The whole time these next events played out, I felt absolutely sick to my stomach; and I mean physically! If you only knew how much it’s taking me to even type all of this out without throwing up.  
That next night, after spending about two or three hours coordinating this “Search party” with the others who signed up, I headed down to the farmstead. I wasn’t sure if it’d work, but I also stopped by the Party City along the way and grabbed one of their druid costumes that hung on the clearance aisle. I figured, if nothing else, my face wouldn’t be the last thing any of these poor bastards saw before I basically screwed them.  
When I arrived, I found that I was the first one to do so, and so I got out and began making my way over to the gate.  
\*\*\*  
I froze just outside the gate. I could feel both of the figures, “The Harvesters”, standing at both sides of me. I could hear something akin to deep, raspy breathing coming from the left side of me, while my own essentially stopped.  
Neither of them made any motion, but I could feel their gazes beat upon the top of my head. They weren’t going to take me. The disguise must be working after all, I figured.  
Looking down at my phone, I saw that there was only about three minutes left until it was time to rendezvous with them all. I thought of trying to text them, make sure they were still coming, but decided against it. These “Harvesters” were possibly many things, and from what I’d seen thus far, stupid wasn’t one of those things. No, I just had to hold my breath and silently fucking pray that they showed up on time. If they didn’t, I was as good as gone.  
Sure enough, just a minute and a half before that time struck, I heard someone approaching from behind. It struck me then that, if they saw the “Harvesters” by the time they got there, they’d probably run screaming. When I looked, though, they were gone already. I heard the guy, and a woman with him, call out to me.  
“Hey, you here for the search party?”  
I turned slightly toward him, not enough to reveal my face, and saw them through the hood before turning and fleeing into the fields. I heard them call out “Wait”, followed by running behind me. They were taking the bait.  
Now I just have to get their--  
Before I could even allow that thought to finish in my head, I could see two of them in the distance, staring straight at me. Just as they were at the gates, I could see them standing still as a statue. I kept running towards them, hoping they’d take the hint and swoop in for their catch.  
They didn’t move an inch, though.  
I ended up running right in between them and onward. By that time, though, about a foot or two past, I realized I couldn’t hear the couple chasing me anymore. I stopped and turned around.There, right where they’d been standing, the two figures had the couple on their knees, arms pinned behind their backs. A third one had also appeared and had his arms raised in the air. Around them, I could see a violet ring of light form in the ground. The couple were writhing and screaming for help, and I have to admit, that made my heart snap in half.  
I started in the direction of the figures as the ring began to glow brighter and brighter. From the “Harvester” in the center, I could hear a death-rattle-like voice hiss like a snake into the air;"One for the Harvesssstsss!"  
The ring was almost blinding to look at now, and now the couple were all but curtained behind it. I picked up the pace to running and leaped into it just before a massive flash of light blinded me.Whatever that light did, it more or less concussed me, because I can remember waking up and finding myself surrounded by dirt. Above me, around me, all of it, nothing but layers of soil. I was about to start freaking the hell out when I realized there was this sort of walkway directly in front of me. I started forward and walked for what almost felt like forever, before finding this massive space, all of it, just empty dirt. In this area, I found the “Harvesters” all gathered in a circle, with the couple on their knees like before.  
They were both still crying and begging to be let go. The “Harvesters” did nothing. The damn things might as well have been tone deaf, with as loud as those two were bawling. I watched the one from before reach down for the guy’s face, which was where I interjected. “WAAAAIIIIIIT!” I bellowed in as raspy and rattley a voice as I could manage. I didn’t expect it, but sure enough, they actually stopped and acknowledged me.  
“Dooon’t!” It was all I could think to say. I was stuck after this, though. I hadn’t honestly expected to get this far. The “Harvester” continued staring at me, clearly expecting some sort of follow-up, some sort of purpose or reasoning, perhaps.  
I don’t know how or exactly why, but I blurted out one word then, the only one that seemed appropriate for this occasion: “Baaaarrrrgaaainnn!”  
The one looking at me cocked his head to the side while the others now turned to look at me. The couple also had their attentions focused on me. Thinking fast, I pulled out my phone and pulled up the picture of my friends from a group picture we did about three months before, and said “Reeeeleeeassse theeem!”  
“Reeeeleeeaassse,” muttered the “Harvester”. It was less of a question in the way it said it, but more so a sort of acceptance. He turned to his companions and down at the couple before returning its gaze back to me.  
It said it again, “Reeeeleeeaaassseee.” The other two then let go of the couple and went over to a dark space in the area which I couldn’t see. When they emerged, it was with the unconscious bodies of Ethan, Norman, and Kathy-Ann. They were damn-near lifeless, but I could still see their chests heaving, indicating that they were indeed still at least alive.  
I reached out my hand, insinuating for them to give them to me. They were hesitant for a moment, but eventually, they caved and threw them at me. They landed a few feet away from me and I ran to drag them away. As I pulled them away into the darkness, the ring of light from before started forming around us. The last thing I remembered was hearing the couple scream one last time before a flash of light engulfed us and we were topside again.  
Long story short here, I struggled, but managed to drag them back to the car and drove away from that horrible place. I took them all back to my place, where they ended up sleeping all the way until the next afternoon, where they all woke up panicked, wondering what the hell happened. Ethan and Norman both claimed that all they could remember was “some dark cloud” passing over them before they just passed out. Kathy-Ann was the only one that could actually remember the “Harvesters”.  
When they asked me how I got them back home, I made up some excuse about us all being drunk and lost, and how they’d passed out, so I had to get us out of the farmstead and back home. I knew Kathy-Ann wasn’t buying that story, but I could also see that she got the idea, to not call me out here. After that, they split and we honestly more or less lost touch after that.  
It wasn’t because of anything personal, and at first at least, it wasn’t because of a lack of trying on their part. There had been occasions where Ethan and Norman would try to invite me out somewhere and I’d just tell them no. I couldn’t help but feel wrong, and for a while, I was honestly scared to leave my house. Another aspect of why I cut them out of my life was because I felt like they deserved a better friend than me, someone who A, could’ve done better to keep them out of a mess like this, and B, could’ve at least had the fuckin’ balls to tell them the truth.  
That, I think, is what’s gotten to me the most. I’m a murderer. Oh sure, I had to do it to save my friends’ lives, but still, that doesn’t negate the fact that I caused an innocent couple to die because of it. It’s been hard to sleep because of that, but over time, it’s slowly been getting easier and easier, if only because of the medications.  
That’s why I’m writing this now, though. I’ve heard that talking about this, “clearing your conscience”, so to speak, can help in that regard. Since I clearly don’t have it in me to tell anybody, even a shrink-- if even they would believe me-- I figured I could at least let you all know here, on the internet, where I can keep my name and face hidden.  
Just like I did, when I made that [bargain](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/179mqam/my_friends_were_kidnapped_one_halloween_night/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)[.](https://www.corpsechildssanctuary.com/blog)
