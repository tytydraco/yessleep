 As a student of Portuguese and Spanish, I often found myself searching for new materials to read and improve my language skills. That's how I stumbled upon the e-book "O Legítimo Diário de May" and thought it would be a harmless way to pass the time. Little did I know that it would be the biggest mistake of my life.

It was said that anyone who read it would be haunted by the book's main character, a vengeful spirit named Mau, but I never believed in curses, ghosts or supernatural entities.

As I started reading the book, I felt a presence behind me, watching my every move. I tried to ignore it, but the feeling only grew stronger as I read deeper into the pages. It was as if someone was breathing down my neck, waiting for me to make a mistake.

I soon discovered that the book was realy cursed, and the presence I felt was the vengeful spirit of May, a young woman who had been wronged in life and was seeking revenge on those who had crossed her.

May's haunting presence was inescapable. I see her face everywhere i went, in reflections and shadows. She was always there, watching and waiting.She would appear in my dreams, whispering her twisted promises of vengeance. Her voice grew louder every night, and her grip on my mind grew stronger.

I tried to get rid of the cursed book by giving it away, but nobody wanted it. It was as if they all knew the horrors that lay within its digital pages.

One night, I woke up to find May standing at the foot of my bed, her twisted smile sending chills down my spine. I tried to scream, but I was paralyzed with fear. I reached out to touch her, and she disappeared into thin air.

But the nightmare was far from over. May's presence became more pronounced, and I knew that I was running out of time. I had to find a way to break the curse before it consumed me entirely.

I searched for answers, hoping to find a way to rid myself of the cursed book and May's haunting presence. That was when I heard the other stories - the ones about the man who disappeared without a trace, leaving only his computer and the cursed e-book behind.

I realized then that I was next. May had claimed another victim, and I was next in line.

In a moment of desperation, I took ALL my e-reader, smartphone, computer, laptop and threw it into the river, hoping to be rid of it once and for all. But as I turned to leave, I saw May standing at the water's edge, her twisted smile now turned into a look of rage.

I ran for my life, not looking back until I was safe at home. But even then, I knew that the curse of "O Legítimo Diário de May" was far from over. May's haunting presence would stay with me forever, a constant reminder of the horrors that lay within that cursed e-book.
