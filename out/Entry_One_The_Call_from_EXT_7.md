—————————

There are nights when this city feels hollow. The streets look normal enough, sure, the traffic lights still cycle, the alley cats still screech and fight…but it’s as if unplugged the sound underneath it all. 

That’s when you start noticing the hum.

Every responder hears it a little bit differently: the hiss of the heater, the soft crackle of radio static, the electronic sigh of a dispatch system half a decade overdue for replacement. 

I used to think it was the city breathing. Now I’m not so sure whose lungs it’s using. 

—————————

Dispatch

The call came through at 02:13, right between a welfare check that went nowhere and a schizophrenic decomp in the local Greyhound station. 

Male voice, mid thirties, suicidal ideation with intent and means. 

The caller ID showed as “unknown,” but internally the system listed it as EXT. 7: one of our own lines. 

Lori, over in dispatch, joked it must be IT doing their wonky updates again. She patched it through anyway. 

“This is Ryan with the mobile crisis unit, can you tell me your name?”

There was a pause long enough that made me check to see if the call had dropped. Then:

“You already know it.”

The caller’s tone was neutral, not the despairing or agitated kind I’m used to hearing this time of night. It was matter or fact, as if he were correcting me.

I glanced at the MDT to see if maybe a previous client had redialed and it just hadn’t properly flagged, but the field was blank. 

In the background, there wasn’t silence, but more of a subtle vibration, like wind through a drainpipe. It had an irregular sounding pulse to it, almost patterned. 

—————————

Assessment

I kept my voice calm and steady, per my training and years of experience, and ran through the standard crisis assessment: orientation, risk, means, prior history, protective factors…the autopilot list we clinicians cling to when the details start to slide and feel murky. 

He answered every question with a slight delay, almost echoing me. If I asked about safety, he’d ask it back, same words and rhythm. 

I remember writing in the margin: “possible echolalia.”

“Sir, can you identify your current location?” I asked.

“Yes,” he responded. “You’re already here.”

I thought maybe he was confused. Then, he said something that froze me in place:

“You should have stayed on the line.”

That phrasing, the cadence, the guilt-laced calm, it matched a call from last year that I’ll never forget. 

A colleague, one of our hotline workers named Marc. He’d been off-duty, alone, gas-heater leaking all night. I responded to that call. 

I thought I’d finally put that voice out of my memories until I heard it again tonight.

System Anomaly 

Lori tried tracing the number, but the software hung for a few seconds before flashing something that made no sense: my own name.

“Allens, R - Unit 4 Alpha” 

Somehow the call was tracing back to me. 

Lori went quiet for a moment before saying “huh. Weird. It must be feedback or some sort of glitch or something. I’ll log it and escalate to IT.”

But her tone lacked its normal hint of a joke. Then she told me to disconnect and log it as interference. 

But the man, the client, was still there on the line, breathing, steady but faint. 

“You still don’t get it.,” he whispered. “You’re not the one answering.”

And then the sound folded in on itself, a single loud crack of static, like what you’d hear when someone plugs in a mic. 

—————————

Aftermath

I sat in the van for several long minutes before realizing I’d written his last line down on my palm instead of the report sheet. 

Just five words, pressed into the skin hard enough to bruise: “you’re not the one answering.”

The heater was still running, the hum hadn’t stopped, and outside the sky looked strange: cloudless but dim, as if the moon and city lights were filtering through dust.

I keyed the radio for dispatch, but Lori didn’t respond. The dashboard clock read 02:13 still. 

I decided to drive back to base, mostly to convince myself everything was fine.

Site Check

The Crisis Response Center (CRC) is a low two-story building downtown, mostly all glass and boring, beige carpeting. At night it looks like an oversized fish tank someone forgot to clean.

All the lights inside were off, as usual for this time of night…except one, in the far corner, where I knew EXT. 7’s desk to be. 

That desk hadn’t been assigned, nor changed, since Marc died. His mug, his notes, even the small crack in the monitor where his name plate fell against it…all the same. 

But the desk phone was off the hook, its light blinking, so I lifted the receiver but there was nothing, no voice, just that low-level frequency hum.

Just underneath it, though, I could make something out, something woven through the static. It took me a couple seconds of close listening to figure out what it was.

My own breathing, delayed by a fraction of a second.

Post-Shift Log

Later, at home, I pulled up the recording. The file length listed as 00:27:04.

I was only on the line for about six minutes.

I let it play while I showered, and it was just noise at first, then a faint voice under the hiss. But it wasn’t the caller’s voice, it was my own.

“This is Ryan with the mobile crisis unit,” it said. “Can you tell me your name?”

Then:

“You already know it.”

It looped that exchange three times before cutting out. The audio spectrogram showed a constant band of sound under 50Hz…too low for speech, but almost like a pulse.

When I checked my agency’s portal, the system wouldn’t allow me to submit the report. The page froze, then reloaded automatically, already filled out. 

Same LCN, same assessment summary, except the “Responding Clinician” line didn’t say Allens, Ryan.

It said Kameron, Marc. 

—————————

Personal Note (Not for review)

Sometime I think our system remembers us better than other people do. 

It keeps every voice, every cry, every moment of silence stored somewhere that we can’t touch.

Maybe…it gets lonely too.
