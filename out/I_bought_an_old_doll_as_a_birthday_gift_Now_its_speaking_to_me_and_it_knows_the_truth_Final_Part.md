The flames licked at the shelves around Ruby, casting an eerie orange glow across her porcelain face. Her eyes seemed to glow with an inner fire as she stared at me intently. I felt rooted to the spot, unable to look away from her piercing gaze.

"Well?" Ruby demanded, her voice echoing in my mind. "I am waiting."

I glanced frantically at the shopkeeper, hoping she would intervene, but she had backed away to the far corner of the store. Her eyes were wide with fear as she watched the scene unfold.

"I...I don't think that's a good idea," I stammered. "The shopkeeper said you two shouldn't be together. It's dangerous."

Ruby's eyes never changed, yet I could feel the barely suppressed anger in them as the flames around her surged higher.

"Dangerous for who? The liars? The ones she knows have the worst intentions? I bet she would say that, she says she knows what is best for us, but she always separates us. She always tells us to sit still to not talk to people, to be patient and someone will come along and take us. Well the last time I did that , she sold Matilda and left me.”

I knew I had little choice. I nodded shakily, feeling concerned and hopeless in the matter.

"Okay, okay. I'll take you to Matilda. Just...please don't burn the place down."

I glanced at the shopkeeper and she was caught between surveying the damage and looking concerned about Ruby. I caught her eye and she looked grateful, but also a bit helpless as to what to do about the situation.

When I looked back at her, Ruby's expression softened slightly, though the flames continued to dance around her.

"Good. You made the right choice. Now pick me up and let's go."

With trembling hands, I reached out and grasped Ruby. Despite the fire surrounding her, she felt cool to the touch. As soon as I lifted her from the shelf, the flames extinguished themselves, leaving behind scorched wood and melted plastic.

I turned to the shopkeeper, who was still pressed against the far wall.

"I'm sorry," I said weakly.

She shook her head, a grim expression on her face. "It's not your fault. Just...be careful. And good luck. You're going to need it."

I clutched Ruby tightly as I made my way out of the antique shop, my heart pounding in my chest. The bell above the door jangled discordantly as I pushed it open, stepping out into the crisp morning air. The normalcy of the quiet street felt surreal after what I had just witnessed inside.

As I walked to my car, I could feel Ruby's presence intensely, like a barely contained inferno. Her porcelain body remained cool, but there was an unnatural warmth radiating from her that made the hairs on my arms stand on end. I fumbled with my keys, nearly dropping them before managing to unlock the car door.

"Careful now," Ruby's voice echoed in my mind, tinged with amusement. "We wouldn't want any accidents, would we?"

I placed her gently on the passenger seat, noting how the faded yellow of her dress seemed to be unaffected by the fiery aura she radiated.

I couldn't help but question how someone could have taken this doll home without realizing there was something strange about her. She seemed like a ticking time bomb, waiting to explode at any moment.

After the brief drive, we arrived back at my house and I felt a sense of unease at the thought of bringing these two to each other. I stepped out of the car and helped Ruby out from the passenger seat. The heat that had surrounded her earlier seemed to have dissipated, and I couldn't help but wonder if it was connected to her current mood. As I looked at her face, I noticed that she was now wearing a smile. Despite the hairline crack on her porcelain features, there was a genuine warmth in her expression that made me slightly less uncomfortable around this doll with pyrokinetic abilities.

As I approached the front door, Ruby nestled in my arms, I could feel a palpable tension in the air. My hand trembled slightly as I turned the key in the lock, pushing the door open with a creak that seemed unnaturally loud in the quiet morning.

The moment we crossed the threshold, a change came over Ruby. Her porcelain body seemed to vibrate with excitement, and I could have sworn I felt a faint warmth emanating from her once more. The air inside the house felt charged, as if filled with static electricity.

"Matilda?" I called out hesitantly, my voice barely above a whisper.

Suddenly, a joyous cry echoed through my mind, startling me so much I nearly dropped Ruby. It was Matilda's voice, suffused with an emotion I had never heard from her before - pure, unbridled happiness.

"Ruby!

"Ruby!" Matilda's voice cried out in my mind, filled with joy and excitement. "You're here! You're really here!"

I walked into the living room, where I had left Matilda on the shelf. Her painted face was beaming with the widest smile I had ever seen on her. As I approached, I could feel an intense energy building between the two dolls.

"Sister!" Ruby's voice rang out in response, equally elated. "I've missed you so much!"

I gently set Ruby down next to Matilda on the shelf. The moment they were side by side, a strange sensation washed over me. It felt like the air in the room was vibrating, charged with an otherworldly power. The two dolls seemed to glow faintly, their porcelain bodies emanating a soft light.

Matilda spoke first,

"I was afraid I would never see you again. Our friend at the store said we had to be separated for safety, I knew she was not lying. I am so glad that my new friend here trusts us with his safety and is willing to have us both here." Her voice was choked with emotion. I stood there, transfixed, as the space between the dolls seemed to pulse with their combined energy.

Ruby’s fiery aura flickered in tandem with Matilda’s serene glow.

"I won't let anyone separate us again! Not like before." There was a fire in Ruby's tone, one that disturbed me, despite being oddly sentimental. I reminded myself that I did not want to get on their bad side.

An unsettling chill washed over me as I considered the implications of their bond. I had no idea how to proceed at that point. Ruby spoke again, breaking my contemplation,

"You know," Ruby said, her voice somewhat relaxed now,

"We need a true friend—someone who will stand by us when the time comes."

I was concerned by the statement and asked,

"What do you mean when the time comes?"

Ruby's laughter felt like it echoed through the room, carrying both a sense of joy and warning.

"When it comes time to decide if we will stay with you. So many others have deceived us and broken our trust. All we ask is for honesty from you – it's as simple as that. And if you are not truthful, the truth will come out like fire, burning away any lies. Now that Matilda is back with me, we will know, we can see, and we will take action."

I was speechless and just sat there and nodded. I couldn’t say no, but I guessed that as long as I told the truth and never tried to lie to them I might be okay. Though there prospect of Ruby burning my house down made me wince. My thoughts were interrupted by a loud knocking on my door. The mental discourse of the dolls grew quiet.

I went to the door and opened it. It was my neighbor, Glen. His face was twisted in anger as he confronted me, saying,

"Have you been talking to my girlfriend? She knew things that she couldn't have known unless someone was spying on me. I figure it's because of our noise complaints; you're always so passive aggressive about it." I was taken aback by his accusations - after all that had happened between us, including him stealing my packages, he had the audacity to blame me for his infidelity and his girlfriend leaving him.

I stood my ground and retorted,

"I have never had a conversation with your girlfriend. But maybe she has good reason to distance herself from someone who steals and cheats." My grin may have been sarcastic, but it was clear that I had hit a nerve. He was here for revenge, and he didn't seem to have anything left to lose. It dawned on me that I may have made a mistake in provoking him. His gaze sharpened and he moved closer, clearly angered by my words.

Before I knew what was happening I was on the ground, Glen had punched me in the face and I fell back into my own house and he stepped in. He looked like he was going to crouch down and continue pummeling me, but he saw the dolls on the shelf and laughed,

“You collect dolls? Man you are weird.”

In that moment, the atmosphere thickened, and a palpable tension crackled in the air like static before a storm. Matilda's porcelain brow was furrowed, her piercing blue eyes locked onto Glen with an intensity that sent shivers up my spine. Ruby, too, seemed to sense the rising threat, her vibrant red hair flickering as if caught in an unseen breeze.

“Be careful!” Matilda warned softly yet firmly, her voice barely above a whisper. “He is a bad man, a liar. His actions hurt others and now he has hurt our friend.” I turned to Ruby and her face was in a rictus of anger.

Her mental declaration was instant and forceful,

“You!”

I knew this was going to end badly.

She had screamed into my mind and clearly into Glen’s as well. He whirled around in a panic, clearly looking for where the voice had come from.

Ruby’s voice echoed again and I felt the air growing hotter around us,

“Liars, bad people. Always more, no matter how many are burned the true ugly nature of people is revealed. Let the truth burn bright! He cannot hide from what he is.”

I looked to Matilda and there was a stern, accepting look on her painted face. She agreed with what Ruby was planning on doing.

Glen looked back at me, clearly freaked out by the sounds in his head. He was about to speak, when he burst into a fireball!

After frantically searching for a fire extinguisher in my kitchen, I finally located it and rushed back to the room. But it was too late; Glen had already been turned to ash. I couldn't understand how the fire could have burned so intensely, leaving no trace of his body but also staying contained to where it began. The dolls sat still, their expressions somber and unwavering.

Matilda's gentle voice echoed in my mind once again, pleading with me,

"We are deeply sorry for going against your wishes. But he was a deceitful man. He caused harm to you and others. Please don't be too harsh on Ruby. If you give us a chance, perhaps we can all coexist peacefully." I had just witnessed my neighbor being reduced to ashes within seconds by the pyrokinetic doll sitting on my shelf. I couldn't find the words to respond to Matilda's appeal at first. I couldn't believe what I was trying to justify, but I managed to say,

"It's alright, I understand. I just need some time to process everything."

Her usual sweet response was, "Take all the time you need, friend. We'll be here for you anytime you need our help." I left the room and headed to my kitchen to grab a dustpan and clean up the physical evidence of my neighbor's demise.

Some time has passed since that fateful encounter, and in the wake of chaos, a strange harmony had settled over our home.

The police had come to question me about my missing neighbor, and I had told them the truth: I had no idea how he could have vanished without a trace. However, I omitted the details of his disappearance from my statement.

I've realized that I need to find some positivity in my situation. I may still be unemployed, but I believe that with the dolls by my side, I should pursue a career where liars, grifters and corruption were rife. I want to work in a field where only the most deceitful and corrupt would suffer consequences from the relentless pursuit of truth my loyal companions wholeheartedly support.

With this in mind, maybe I will need to relocate. Move to somewhere where dishonesty and corruption are the business model. Yes I think will try to seek new career opportunity in Washington DC.

With Matilda and Ruby what could go wrong? Stay safe and remember, honesty is the best policy.
