In February 1987, animal control officers in Tarrant County, Texas responded to a report of an injured bobcat inside an abandoned parking structure. 



While the animal was alert and active, its body appeared to be in a state of active decomposition. Unusually, its fur and eyes were a light silvery color, which potentially indicated further issues with the animal’s health.



The officers cornered the animal in a utility office. Inside, they found a second, much smaller bobcat displaying the same decomposition and unusual coloring as the first.



They also discovered a young woman.



She was in a poor poor state, appearing feverish and unwashed. Like the bobcats, her eyes were an unusual silver hue. Her left hand was badly swollen and discolored. 



One officer approached. The larger bobcat immediately attacked, biting with such force that the officer lost two fingers.



The girl then launched herself at the second officer, hitting him with sufficient strength to break his collarbone. 



The officers retreated and contacted dispatch for law enforcement assistance. 



By the time they arrived, there was no sign of the girl or the diseased animals.



Within six hours, the officer who had been bitten was hospitalized with a severe fever. The bite was immensely swollen. The speed and severity of the inflammation split the flesh from his palm to his wrist.



His fever spiked to a high of 106.7 degrees Fahrenheit. He passed away shortly thereafter. Prior to death, his eyes lightened to the same unusual silver of the bobcat’s eyes. 



A few days later, a second individual called dispatch to request an ambulance for a severely ill young woman. She was delirious with fever, and her hand was swollen to twice its normal size.  



The girl was not cooperative. She bit the EMT before departing the scene.



The EMT spiked a fever and died within eight hours, but not before his eyes took on a silver hue.



The incidents caused local panic. News reports suggested a terrifying new strain of fast-acting rabies carried by diseased bobcats.



The furor briefly made national news. Based on the symptoms, location, and description of the animals and the associated deaths, the Agency of Helping Hands sent its biohazard containment team. 



The “bobcats” were in fact disease-carrying organisms known to the agency. In fact, personnel had attempted to destroy the larger organism earlier that year. Both targets were taken into custody with no incident.



The girl was another matter.



It was clear that she had been infected with the target’s unique pathogen. Per protocol, personnel attempted to terminate her onsite, only to find that their weapons could not penetrate her skin.



With no way to address her in the field, personnel transported her to the nearest field office for further evaluation.



When it became clear that the field office was not equipped to handle her, she was transported to AHH-NASCU for termination.



It should be noted that this individual was not terminated.



Despite the unfortunate circumstances of her initial detainment and the devastating start of her relationship with the organization, this individual has in fact distinguished herself as one of the Agency’s most valuable assets.



Camila J. is inarguably AHH-NASCU’s greatest success story. When first discovered by the Agency, she was an unhoused youth who had recently extracted herself from a human trafficking situation. To complicate matters, she was suffering immensely following exposure to the pathogen carried by Inmate 111 (Ward 3, “The Mandagot”). 



With the direct support of now-Director Eric W., Camila ascended from critically ill termination target to valuable T-Class Agent.



Camila’s most striking ability is her total imperviousness to outside damage. While this was not the case early in her relationship with the agency, Camila is currently impervious to physical pain. This has made her an invaluable field asset.



It should be noted that the only known way to inflict physical damage onto Camila is by utilizing her own teeth or claws. 



Camila’s second ability is to project what is best described as a “psychological glamor” in which she is able to convince anyone to whom she is speaking that she is (for lack of a better term) “on their side.” Simply put, she is capable of mirroring to a remarkable extent. This ability combined with her relative indestructibility has made her an ideal candidate for the execution of many Agency directives.



Camila’s current diagnoses include complex post-traumatic stress disorder and unspecified dissociative disorder. Past diagnoses include depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and substance abuse disorder. All of Camila’s symptoms are well-managed at this time.



Camila’s appearance is nothing short extraordinary. She is recognizably humanoid, but markedly animalistic. She is exceptionally powerful and very large in stature, with thick fur.



This coat is her defining feature. Thick and pale tawny in color, it gives the impression of luminosity because it possesses the same light-refracting properties as the coat of Akhal-Teke horses. Her eyes remain the same silver hue as when she was initially discovered.



It should be noted that when Camila came into the Agency’s custody, her appearance was typical and unremarkable. Records indicate that she was approximately 18-22 years old, underweight, and 5’2” tall with black hair and pale eyes.



The transformation into her current state occurred via a Khthonic process following a highly unfortunate incident involving T-Class Agent Christophe W.  



Thanks to Camila’s exceptional understanding, the incident did not affect the working relationship between her and Christophe.



Due to the possibility that Camila has been manipulated by Inmate 17 (Ward 1, “The Harlequin”), she is currently barred from fieldwork and confined to her cell pending further investigation.



It should be noted that Camila is fully cooperative and has expressed full understanding of the Agency’s position.



The interviewer feels the need to clarify that the content of Camila’s interview may be distressing. While it is not standard protocol to assign trigger warnings to official reports, please note that Camila either touches upon or openly discusses disturbing subject matter including violent physical assault, and human trafficking.

**Interview Date: 1/10/25**





What I’m about to share is the least important part of me. I’m telling it only because I want to help you.



Please make sure you listen.



Growing up, I really loved cats.



I loved them all, from housecats to cougars to Siberian tigers. Lions were my favorite because the Lions were my dad’s football team. I thought it would make him treat me a little better.



It never did.



I wasn’t allowed to have pets, but I made friends with a stray cat. She had the most beautiful tawny fur, just like a lion. I named her Nem. Nem lived in a crumbling parking garage a couple blocks away. She was my best friend until I ran away.



I named her after the Nemean lion. If you don’t know, it’s a myth about a lion who was so powerful nothing could kill him. Not spears, not swords, not fire, not anything but a god. And even that god couldn’t do it without the lion’s own claws. 



I liked the idea of being impervious to everything but myself.



That’s because I was the definition of pervious. I was weak. I was the kid everyone used up and threw away. That’s a privilege the powerful have over the weak: 



Using up, throwing away.



That’s also the story of my life. I get used up and thrown away.



I will spare you the details on what that entailed in childhood. Let’s skip ahead. I’m fifteen years old, in a home with batshit fundie foster parents, and newly pregnant.



As soon as the test came back positive, my boyfriend fucked off. And why not? He used me right up, so it was time to throw me away.



I expected my foster parents to kick me out. Instead, they turned into the most gentle, considerate, caring people who ever lived. I thought it was because they loved me. Turns out they just wanted my baby.



And they got him. 



Once they got him, they shipped me back to the crisis center. 



Used up, thrown away. The privilege of the powerful over the powerless.



In ancient Rome, they used lions in the Coliseum. One of the lion-centric entertainments was dropping cubs into the arena from great big heights to see if the mother lions could catch them before they hit the ground.



After I gave my baby to those people, I had nightmares where I was a lion in a dusty arena watching as my foster mother dropped my baby from on high. In those dreams, I never caught him.



I was sixteen, and I’ll level with you: No one cares about teenagers in the system. They pretend, but sixteen is right about when they stop pretending. Because sixteen-year-olds are noted for their maturity, right?



Anyway, I wound up on the street doing what I had to do to survive. It wasn’t a world of hurt. It was, simply, hurt.



That was nothing new. I was used to being hurt. 



But I was so tired of it.



Tired of hurting. Tired of being used up. Tired of being thrown away.



I learned how to keep giving and giving and giving long after I had nothing left. I thought that as long as I was giving, no one would throw me away.



So I made sure I always had something someone could use.



That was exactly the skill I needed to succeed where I ended up, which was a place where I was used constantly.



That situation taught me not to care. When you don’t care, you can’t hurt. Soon, nothing hurt me anymore. I could still pretend to be hurt — which some clients really liked —  but I wasn’t actually hurting.



The fact that I wasn’t actually hurting made other clients feel better about themselves. I was glad. When clients don’t feel good about themselves, they make it your problem. They make it so *you* have to comfort *them* about the shame they feel for abusing you.



That’s almost sicker than the rest of it combined.



Anyway, the Nemean Lion helped with all that. Nothing could hurt the Nemean Lion, so I became the Nemean Lioness. Not on the outside. That was impossible. On the outside I was just a ruined girl.



But on the inside I could be whatever I wanted, so I was the Lioness.



The lies we tell ourselves to survive.



I worked out of a motel for a man who insisted he was my manager. I had one friend, a guy named Cody. He helped watch the girls and keep us in line. I didn’t blame him for it. He was doing what he had to to survive, just like me.



A couple of years into that, cops raided the place and I ran away with Cody. 



Compared to the other men, Cody seemed great. Within that hierarchy, where he was low on the totem pole, he *was* great. But after the old totem pole burned down, Cody decided to build his own totem pole where he was at the top and I was at the bottom.



It didn’t matter because I was the goddamn Nemean lioness. No one could hurt me, especially not men. Not even Cody.



That is the privilege of the powerless over the powerful: Refusing to let their power hurt you.



Cody and I ended up in an encampment. It was hell in more ways than one. I was used in more ways than one. But I stayed because Cody never even dreamed of throwing me away.



Sometimes he felt bad about what he did and what he made me do. That was harder than if he’d just been an asshole, because it put me in the position of having to comfort him. I had to put aside the pain and fear *he* inflicted to make *him* feel better.



I hate that. 



Cops eventually swept the encampment. Cody and I didn’t have much, but what we did have, we lost. That ruined Cody. Turned him from a shitty man into a monster. Some of the worst monsters I’ve ever met are men who feel powerless.



That’s what happened to Cody.



He turned into something angry and starving and stinking. Something that wanted to use up every last bit of me just throw me away. Being able to throw someone away is a form of power. After losing everything, he wanted to feel like he still had power over something. He wanted to feel the privilege of the powerful over the powerless.



I was tired of being under his power, so I ran from him. 



I took refuge in the same crumbling parking garage where my stray cat lived so long ago. I hoped Nem would be there, but of course she was long gone.



I fell asleep, dreamed my Coliseum, dream and woke up crying. Through my tears, I saw a feline shadow and heard padding footsteps. 



My heart jumped to my throat. Could it be?



The padding footsteps grew louder, and the shadow swelled. 



But the thing that turned the corner wasn’t a cat.



It was a horror.



A melting, blistered monster whose flesh dripped and reformed before my eyes. It was the worst thing I’ve ever seen, and that’s saying a lot.



It shoved its head against my hand. Its skin was sticky and so, so cold. Then it sank its teeth into the webbing between my thumb and forefinger.



Pain for an instant, followed by a pulse. Like an electrical current combined with Morse code, something that scorched words directly into my brain:



*Please help me*



Its eyes shone like lamps. Its ruined skin dripped and regrew. Constant growth, constant destruction.



I felt like I was still dreaming. In dreams, you’re whatever you want to be, and I was the Nemean Lioness. Nothing could hurt me, not even telepathic melting cat monsters.



“How?” I asked.



It leapt away and hurried deep into the parking structure.



I followed it down a filthy stairwell that crumbled under my feet. The last flight of stairs was nothing but rubble. I had to slide down.



The monster led me into a moldy office. In the corner was a second, much smaller and much sicker, monster. One of its eyes was gone. It shivered so terribly it seemed on the verge of convulsions.



The bigger monster looked at it with such sadness. 



“How do I help?” I asked.



*Keep us warm*.



So I put the little shivering monster on my chest, let the big one tuck itself against my hip, and wrapped us all in my coat.



I dreamed of the Coliseum again, golden and dusty, infected with terror as my cub came hurtling down.



I caught him.



When I woke, the little one wasn’t convulsing anymore and the big one was fast asleep.



I became the monster’s servant. I stole supplies — blankets, food, water, even dishes — and set up a little living space for the three of us. 



They were definitely controlling me, and I knew it. I didn’t care. I was used to being used. Unlike everyone else, these little monsters didn’t hurt me when they used me. I named the big one Melter and the little one Melty. 



I liked taking care of them.



I didn’t like being in the parking garage, though. I needed a flashlight at all times, and the crumbling concrete made me anxious. I asked if we could find another place. 



*No.*



“Why?”



*This is a good hiding place. We’re hiding*.



“From what?”



*Monsters. Big ones that play games with us*. 



I thought of lions in the Coliseum. Of cubs tumbling down into the blood-stained dust. 



That night, I dreamed about lions yet again while the little monster quivered and the big one burrowed inside my shirt, leaving strings of liquified flesh against my skin. Where it dried, I felt warm.



Two days after that dream, the big monsters caught us.



They were in uniforms, but not uniforms I recognized. 



Melter went feral. They caught her anyway. I tried to protect the little one, but the big monsters knocked me to my knees and took her too. I crawled after them. The rubble dragged my shirt up on one side, exposing the spidery web of Melter’s leftover flesh. 



When they saw that, they restrained me. When they saw Melter’s bite — puffy and swollen and pulsating with infection — they put me in the back of the truck, too.



I should have been scared, but I was just glad to be with Melter. 



We traveled for hours. They didn’t give me a single sip of water or a bite of food, but I barely noticed. I was too worried about Melter and her little one.



They took me to a laboratory where they ran a million tests, each weirder and more painful than the last, to see what Melter had done to me.



Then they put me in a holding cell from Hell.



I wasn’t the only one in there.



Nearby was a huge, cloudy tank filled with foul water. As I watched, the thing inside pressed an eerie, pearlescent face against the glass before flickering off again.



One one side of the tank was a woman covered in feathers. She had terrible, broken proportions. When she saw me, she started begging incomprehensibly. I wanted to help, but couldn’t understand what she was asking.



On the other end of the room was a monstrous chimera, equal parts puma, human, and coyote, with the wings of a condor. 



There was a little girl with a withered leg and mottled skin who kept screaming. The sound shot through my ear like a lance, or a steel bolt through the head of a calf in a slaughterhouse.



And directly across from me was a huge monster of a man with too many teeth and eyes that glowed like a cat’s in the night. 



But he wasn’t a cat. Not even close.



His face was wrong, stretched and terrible, almost wolfish. He was desperately ill, shaking and sweating, growling to himself like the crazy people I saw in the streets.



He filled me with revulsion. It made sense. I was a lioness. He was a wolf. Cats and dogs don’t get along. 



I made myself small, but he noticed me anyway. 



He calmed down, but not in a good way. In a predatory way. The way of a mad, starving dog who has stumbled on a chicken coop.



I’ve seen that look a thousand times, so I knew how to handle men who looked at me like I was something to use and throw away.



“What are you looking at?” I asked.



He snarled, “Something that smells like cat shit.”



That was the beginning of something incredibly unbeautiful.



His name was Wolf, which was the least surprising thing about him. He had a nice accent and he worked for the people who arrested me. “I’m their best worker,” he bragged. “But they don’t care anymore. That’s why I’m here.”



“Why don’t they care anymore?”



“I’m too dangerous. I need too much and too many to be worth their trouble now.”



“Too many what?”



He didn’t answer.



Maybe it was a leftover effect from Melter’s bite, but he didn’t really need to answer. Not with teeth like his.



“It’s their fault, not mine,” he said. “They wanted to make me even stronger than I am. I did not need to be stronger. I did not want to be stronger. But they made me stronger by giving me too much. And now I need much too much.”



He didn’t talk to me any more that day. I was glad. His voice sounded like how it felt to be thrown away.



Every day, the workers pulled me from the laboratory and ran more tests, each weirder and scarier than the last.



I’m not the smartest person in the world, but even I realized I’d changed. The biggest change was no matter what they did to me, they couldn’t break my skin.



Literally, they could not hurt me.



I asked Wolf about it.



That made him laugh. I hated his laugh. There was no humor in it, no joy. Just rage, despair, and wanting. “You’re a casualty.”



That was almost funny, only because I’ve been a casualty all my life.



“The rotten little cat bit you, yes? I can smell her in you.”



“What does she have to do with it?”



“She gave you cat scratch fever, but it is a special fever that makes you strong instead of weak. She was a titan project that failed.”



“What does that m—”



He ignored me and just kept going. “They kill the failures here. They have to. They thought they killed her. That’s why she’s rotten, because of what they did to make her die. But instead of dying, she lived and had her rotten little baby and came to you for help.” He laughed again. “You are a terrible helper.”



“Is that why I’m here?”



“No. You are here because they are going to throw you away. That’s what they do with most of us who end up here. They throw us away. After everything I have done and everything they have done to me, they are going to throw me away too.”



I could taste the fear in his words. Sheer, despairing terror buried under a suffocating layer of rage.



Over the following weeks, the other creatures in the holding cell cycled out. Some cycled back. Most didn’t.



Every day, workers pulled me for tests that grew increasingly painful as the weeks wore on. They finally figured out how to draw blood — turns out they had to extract a tooth or pull off a nail. Otherwise, my skin never broke or even bruised. I felt pain, though. The pain would have broken me if I’d been anything but the Nemean Lioness.



Nothing can hurt the Nemean Lioness, not even pain.



Nothing except myself. My own claws, my own teeth, my own memories. My baby being taken from me and dropped somewhere else like the cubs stolen from the lionesses in the arena. I had that nightmare every night.



But I didn’t tell anyone that. 



I kept going between the laboratory with its insane tests and the holding cell with its insane inmates. Eventually, every inmate cycled out except me and Wolf. 



He grew scarier and more scared. Most nights I woke up from my nightmares to hear him crying over his own.



Finally, they took him away and didn’t bring him back.



I was all alone for two days.



Then they came for me.



I wondered how they were going to kill me. I wondered if they knew about the Nemean Lion. If they were going to kill me with my own nails or teeth or memories.



Then a man came in. He was handsome and calm, with dark eyes and a bright smile that gave me the creeps. He introduced himself as Eric.



“I’m a manager here,” he said. “I’m sorry for what’s been done to you. Some of it was necessary. Most of it wasn’t. If I were in charge, you wouldn’t have been treated so poorly.”



I sat there waiting for the *but.* With these guys, there’s always the biggest, fattest but.



Sure enough:



“But I’m going to cut to the chase: My organization wants me to kill you.”



“Then why aren’t you?”



“Because I want something from you.”



What did I tell you? Story of my life. 



“You are the most resilient person I’ve ever met,” he said. “Emotionally, psychologically, and physically, you are untouchable. It’s spectacular. You’re spectacular.”



I’ve heard all of this before more times than I can count.



“There are lots of spectacular individuals here. You’ve met quite a few. In my opinion, the most spectacular of these individuals — besides you, that is — is Mr. Wolf. What do you know about him?”



“I know he’s afraid of being thrown away.”



“Due to unfortunate circumstances not wholly within his control, that’s the plan for him. It’s also the plan for you.”



“Why?”



“Because my organization believes you’re very dangerous. They’re right about that. They also believe you’re of no use to them.” He hesitated, but not for real. It was practiced. Rehearsed. Utterly false. I would know. I’ve been on the giving and receiving end of calculated pauses my whole life. “I believe they’re wrong about that. Do you know anything else about Mr. Wolf?”



I shook my head.



“I apologize in advance if I wax poetic. He’s very special to me on both a personal and professional level. He’s integral to operations here. Let’s just say ‘useful’ is a profound understatement. But his usefulness hinges on his abilities. Because of these abilities, he has very specialized needs.”



Another measured pause.



“What I’m about to tell you will be disturbing. I ask that you keep an open mind.”



Let’s just say d*isturbing* was a profound understatement.



What he said was insane. Basically that Wolf was a superhero — basically a god — but his superpowers came from being bad. Really, really fucking bad. The kind of bad that tortures and kills people. If Wolf stopped being bad, he lost his powers. He got weak.



He got useless.



It was the privilege of the strong over the weak writ larger and more literally than ever.



“Killing itself isn’t necessary, but violence is. The sheer scope of that violence combined with the fragility of the human body frequently results in death. Morality aside, it’s a logistical nightmare,” said Eric. “We have to source his victims regularly. After a recent mistake, it’s now impossible to meet his needs while staying under the radar. It doesn’t help that best outcomes result from a specific victim profile. The one positive thing I can say about it is there’s nothing sexual involved. I know that’s very cold comfort, but—”



“Cut the shit. What do you want from me?”



He laid out his proposal. Even I could hardly believe it.



“I understand that this is horrifying,” he finished. “But speaking frankly, it’s a matter of life and death for both you and Mr. Wolf. It’s only possible because of what you are.”



“And what am I, exactly?”



“Indestructible. We’ve run hundreds of tests and experiments. There’s no question. Wolf can be as brutal as he needs to be with you as often as necessary for as long as is necessary to recalibrate his needs. You’ll come out unscathed, saving many lives — including yours and his — in the process.”



“And your organization.”



He smiled.



I gave him my own measured pause. “What’s in it for me?”



“Your life.”



“No shit, you asshole. I want more than that.”



“What do you want, Camila?”



“Melter and her baby.”



“I’m sorry?”



I held up my hand, displaying the bite scar. 



“They’re alive,” he said carefully. “But they’re disease vectors. Besides, their existence…you’ve seen them. Humane euthanasia—”



“I want them.”



This time his pause wasn’t measured. It was helpless.



I liked that.



“Okay,” he finally said. “But only because you’re the strongest person I’ve ever met. Stronger than even Wolf can hope to be. I greatly value strength. Remember that.”



And that’s how I ended up in a long-term torture arrangement with the wolf man.



I will never forget the first encounter. Not how his eyes shone like rotten moons, not how every last one of my instincts screamed at me to run, not the transcendent horror I felt when he knocked me to the ground.



I felt everything he did, but that was okay because I was the Nemean Lioness. Nothing could hurt me, not even pain. Not even when he knocked out half my teeth.



When he was finally done, he wouldn’t even look at me. I was so used to men doing that that I didn’t even care.



When he was gone, I went around the room and collected my bloody teeth.



This went on for a while.



Every night, I was brutally murdered without actually dying. At the end he always walked off, panting and slick with sweat, without a word. 



Maybe two weeks in, he finished like always and trudged to the door without a backward glance.



And then he threw up.



He didn’t come back for days.



The next time I saw him, he was worse than ever. More brutal than even I could have imagined. 



The time after that, he started off even worse, but had a breakdown in the middle. 



He stayed away for a while. 



And when he came back, he was more violent than ever. But there was something in his face, something entirely broken, that made me feel pity. Pity is a crack that lets warmth in.



That crack got bigger when he threw up again after.



It got even bigger the next time after he shoved me away and collapsed in on himself, sobbing.



“Why?” I asked. “If you hate it so much?”



For the very first time, he looked at me. “Because if I don’t, I get weak.”



“And when you’re weak, they throw you away.”



He wiped his eyes, then left.



That night, I dreamed of Cody. Not of the stinking, starving thing he became at the end, but of who he was when I first met him. Just an anxious boy who guarded the girls.



When Wolf finally returned, his mouth was bleeding and his teeth were gone. “It’ll hurt less this way,” he said.



It did hurt less, but not enough to matter.



When he was done, he didn’t leave. He huddled up and cried. 



“It’s okay,” I lied. “You can’t really hurt me because I’m the Nemean Lioness.”



“What’s that?”



I told him the story. By the end, he was almost calm. 



Only then did I realize that I was yet again stuck in the position of comforting someone who was hurting me.



“I wish I was like you,” he said. “I wish I was the only one who could hurt me.”



Our arrangement kept on.



The brutality eventually hit critical mass. I wondered what, exactly, his duties and abilities entailed, and what kind of horrific work required a worker as terrible as him.



Wolf always threw up afterwards. Once, he even tried to stop my mouth bleeding after he knocked a few more of my teeth. The sight of my blood frightened him.



“I thought I couldn’t hurt you,” he kept saying. “They said I couldn’t really hurt you.”



After he left, I went around the room and gathered up my own teeth.



The next time he came, his own teeth were gone again.



I knew it made him feel better, so I pretended it made me feel better. How could it? I was making a monster.



It occurred to me that Eric’s organization had turned me into a perpetual motion machine. But instead of energy, I generated monstrosity.



For the first time in my life, I wanted to be thrown away



Not even because of my own pain, but because I was being used to perpetuate others’ pain. Wolf’s pain — although he was the least of my concerns — and the pain of everyone else he was able to hurt because hurting me made him powerful.



It was the exploitation to crown all exploitations, the abuse to top all abuse, a cycle more brutal than brutality itself. A perpetuation of horror that they accomplished with my body.



The more I thought about it, the more I wanted to be used up and thrown away for good.



But there was no way to use me up. That’s the whole point of a perpetual motion machine: You can’t use it up. I couldn’t even be killed.



And Wolf made everything so much harder. That’s the thing I hate most about all of this, what I’ve always hated most: That I’m forever forced to feel pity, even empathy, for my abuser. Trauma-bonding with someone whose only trauma is having to feel shame for what he does to me.



I don’t think I would have minded if Wolf wanted to be thrown away, too. But he didn’t. He doesn’t. He never will. He was, and is, and will always be too terrified to ever do the right thing.



He did the wrong things instead, and even though they didn’t kill me I felt every single one.



I was in so much pain one night that I couldn’t even dream of sleep, so I pulled out my pile of teeth and inspected them one by one.



I thought of the Nemean Lion. How the only thing that could kill him was a god, and how even the god needed the lion’s claws to do it.



That gave me an idea.



I used my fork to bore holes in the teeth. It took a few days, and several of them broke. But by the end, I had enough to thread along braided strips of fabric torn from the bloody shirt Wolf ruined when he first knocked my teeth out.



When I was done, it looked like a necklace.



When the worker came for me, I looped it around my wrist.



And when they brought Wolf in, I held it out. The teeth gleamed under the lights.



He looked at me, eyes burning, and took it.



Before I could blink, he drove me to my knees and pulled the cord impossibly tight around my throat. 



It was messy and inexpressibly painful and it felt *so* goddamned slow.



But in the end, he pulled so hard that my own teeth broke my skin. They cut down so deep I bled out.



I died.



I didn’t stay dead.



But when I came back, I was really, truly a lioness.



I wish there was a moral to this story, but there’s not.



Wolf and I still engage from time to time. Sometimes he can do what he needs to do. Sometimes he can’t. When he can’t, they find a girl no one will miss or an inmate awaiting termination and throw her to him. Sometimes he does what he needs to do. Sometimes he can’t.



I don’t hate him.



I think everyone would be better off if he was dead, including him.



But I still don’t hate him. He’s doing what he needs to do to survive. Making sure he can always be used so they don’t throw him away, just like me.



But that doesn’t excuse what he does. Never has, never will.



They don’t want me to tell you this. They didn’t want me to tell you any of this. All they wanted me to tell you is whether I’m working with our favorite theater aficionado. I don’t want to tell you about that.



Here’s what I want to tell you:



 I don’t want anyone to use you up or throw you away. That’s why I told you this story, to help you the only way I can.



You feel powerless. I know you do. In most ways, you are. 



But you have a great deal of power over someone.



Learn how to use it before they force him to use his on you.





\* \* \*





If you’re not familiar with my workplace drama, this next part won’t make sense.



This interview happened *after* what you’re about to read. If the interview had happened before, I wouldn’t have bothered doing any of this.



But it did happen after, so here goes.



I decided to break Christophe out of R&D a couple of days ago.



My plan was stymied by the fact that my key card would not work.



After several minutes of swiping, reswiping, and cursing, the agency director, Eric (the very same Eric referenced in the interview) caught me.



I kind of thought I was going to die.



“If it makes you feel better, I expected this,” he said. “And I expect you to try other ill-advised things in the future. With that said, it’s best if you know what you’re getting into before you make any additional plans. And for future reference, entrance to R&D requires two keycards, not one.”



That’s how my incredibly rushed tour of the Research and Development Unit began.



Each of the R&D cells had sizable observation windows. Through one, I saw an exhausted little girl on a table hooked up to what looked like a plasmapheresis machine.



In another, I saw a bony, malformed creature that resembled a bird without any eyes.



In yet another was a monstrously huge segmented worm with a human face. It was crying. 



In another cell I saw what I can only describe as a giant, deformed hyena. In another was a creature that resembled a horrific bobcat missing an eye. The other eye, however, was bright and silver as the moon. 



That made me breathe a little easier.



Beyond those glimpses, I had no time to take in my surroundings. The only thing I really absorbed was that the security was incredible. I could never have gotten down there by myself, let alone into a cell, let alone break someone out.



The director led me down another set of stairs and into a corridor.



I heard Christophe long before I saw him. I wondered how crying I’d never even heard before could sound so familiar.



The director stopped at the second cell on the right, indicating the observation window.



And there he was.



Huddled in the corner, shoulders heaving as he wept. His own violently extracted teeth were scattered around him. He was cuffed so tightly his wrists were scraped raw.



It took my breath away in the worst way. “What did you do to him?”



The cell door wheezed open.



“Ask him.” Before I could react, Eric shoved me into the cell.



The door hissed shut behind me.



Christophe abruptly fell silent.



Then he looked up.



I reared back.



He looked like himself, but barely. His face was a contorted, wide-eyed void wearing an empty smile. Bright eyes, opaque and inhuman, gleamed flatly over too many perfect shining teeth.



“You.”



He lurched to his feet. He was taller than I remembered. Much taller, and much wider. He’d always seemed too tall to me, but this was something else entirely. “You are not supposed to be here. They said you would not ever be here. They said. Do you want to be here?”



“No.”



He shuffled forward.



I took a step back, willing my heart to slow down in case he could hear it. He kept coming. There was nowhere for me to go. The cell was small, the door was locked, and I was afraid to turn my back on him.



“I don’t want you to be here.” The smile never left his face. He looked starving, heartless, empty. Empty eyes so bright and so dark. “But since you are. Since you are. You *are*.”



I held my hands up. “Christophe, plea—”



He grabbed me and pulled me in.



He was breathtakingly strong. I felt the bones in my arm grinding together, threatening to snap or splinter.



Suddenly the world split apart.



An electric surge shattered my consciousness and everything else. He let go but turned right back and fixated on me, redlining like a mad dog. I’ve never seen eyes like his, never seen anything like the expression on his face. I hope I never do again.



The cell door opened. I bolted through. It wheezed shut behind just as he lunged. 



“We’re at step two of the reward stage of his reconditioning cycle,” the director said calmly. “It’s when he’s at his worst.”



“What do you mean, reward stage?”



“Christophe’s rewards typically, though not exclusively, consist of victims with which he is permitted to do whatever he wants. He’s very…anticipatory at the moment, which brings out the worst in him. If it matters, the behavior he just displayed was very mild for him, I assume because he recognized you. In terms of your personal safety, that’s an exceptionally good sign.”



“He didn’t choose this,” I said. “He wouldn’t.”



“He would, and he did. It was a difficult decision for him, it it matters. But he made it of his own volition. *If* it matters, he made his decision on the condition that even after your scales come in, you will not be designated as a reward under any circumstances.”



“But other people will.”



“Other people will. Other people have. Other people are. He knows this. He chose this.”



A pause. A measured, deliberate pause.



“I hope this experience has clarified the situation and corrected your position.”



“Why did you throw me in there with him?”



“It was a final effort to see if he could kickstart your regrowth. You were never in any significant danger. It’s very late. A good night’s rest is in your best interest.”



I went to bed, but didn’t sleep. I seethed.



After interviewing Camila the next day, I seethed more.



I haven’t stopped.



I don’t think I can.



I don’t think I can care what happens to Christophe anymore, either.



Which is for the best. I'd do literally anything to get out of here, but I know I can't. That means the only person I can afford to care about is me.
