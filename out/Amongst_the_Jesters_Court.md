Have you ever wondered about the freedom of your decisions, and if you’re truly in control of your life?

As a psychologist, I occasionally pondered these questions, for they were a key concern of one of my patients, Jeremy. He was soft-spoken, never lost his temper, and always apologized in case he missed a meeting. Despite his huge build, however, the man was terribly afraid of the outside world, suffered from a serious anxiety disorder, frequent panic attacks, dissociation, and the aforementioned feeling of not being in control of his life.

During our weekly sessions, we often talked about the topic of dreams. Jeremy was often plagued by vivid nightmares, centered on loss, people leaving him behind, and not being able to do anything about it.

One day, however, he told me about a different dream.

I listened as Jeremy outlined a nightmare centered on the loss of a dear friend that had haunted him for years.

“Well Jeremy, that dream, like many others-” I started, but was promptly cut off.

“No, doc, that’s not what I want to talk about.”

I waited for him to continue, but he just sat there, eyes downcast, and his fidgety fingers scratched over the fabric of his jeans.

“It’s what comes after,” he eventually said, after taking a deep breath.

“Are you talking about how you feel after waking up? The guilt?”

Jeremy shook his head.

“No, it’s... how the dream ends. How all my dreams end these days.”

“How do they end, Jeremy?”

Once more he was quiet, and seemed to gather himself, unsure where to start. I wondered what had him so worked up and why he was so anxious.

“It doesn’t matter what my dreams are about, I always end up at a... different place. It’s a path through a wide plain, but it’s unlike anything I’ve seen before. I know you said dreams can be weird, doc, but this one’s different. It’s a path, but also not. I feel like I’m traveling through a place I can’t understand. I somehow know it’s a wide plain, but it’s also a tunnel. Everything’s upside down, but not. I feel like I’m moving in all directions at once, but also not moving at all.”

Jeremy continued to outlined his dream, or he tried to. I could see how hard he concentrated, could see the frustration on his face. His fingers seemed to dig into his legs, as he tried to describe colors and forms he’d never seen before, but couldn’t put them into words.

“It’s just... I don’t know, doc. It’s indescribable, outlandish. I don’t know what this-“

“Calm down, Jeremy, it’s all right. At times, our dreams might not make sense, but given what you told me-“

“It doesn’t end there, doc. I wish it would, but it doesn’t. Eventually, I arrive at some sort of structure. I know it’s a castle or a palace, but it’s all wrong. The dimensions make no sense, and the walls are moving in all directions. It’s like they are alive, growing from and falling into one another. I just... can’t describe it. After a while, I enter this grand hall, this court where a banquet is held. There’s all these... things, these creatures or beings. They, too, make absolutely no sense.”

Jeremy’s voice had grown erratic as he rambled on about twisted monstrosities, gaseous entities, angels and demons, but he said those were mere words, words his brain told him. Their shapes were too strange. Whenever he tried to think about them, his head hurt, because he never thought shapes like this could ever exist. For a moment, he tensed up, and I saw him rub his temples, as if to fight an emerging headache. I watched him, ready to cut him short at any moment, afraid he’d end up having a panic attack.

“These beings, they are consuming something. I know it’s rotten... I just know it. There’s one thing, though, doc, one thing I can always see clearly. At the end of the hall there’s a throne, and on it sits some sort of puppet, or marionette. This damned thing... It’s dressed up as a jester, grinning from ear to ear, staring right at me.”

“There are strings leading upward from it, countless strings, but they aren’t connected to it, not controlling it. Instead, the marionette is holding them in its hands, and uses them to control the court, to make them eat the disgusting, rotten banquet. No, not just eat, to gorge themselves. This... thing, I don’t even want to think about it, about its grin. My god, I don’t-“

“Jeremy, it’s all right. It’s just a dream. There’s no reason to-“

“Do you know what it does, doc? What it always does? Every single time, it gets up and dances towards me, half-floating, half-walking, giggling and laughing, and all the little bells on its outfit jingle and jingle and jingle. Once it reaches me, it pushes its face right in front of mine, its giant, grinning face. Its eyes are so wide, and they stare deep into mine. And then, I can feel them. I can feel these freaking strings all over my body. Right then, the damned thing says something to me, but before I can understand it, I wake up. Sometimes, even after waking up, I can still feel them, I can still feel those strings, and sometimes, sometimes, I...”

Jeremy was shaking, and out of it. For a moment, I thought he was hugging himself before I realized what he was doing. He was searching for strings connected to his body.

“Calm down Jeremy. It’s nothing but a dream, a reoccurring one, just like many others you had in the past. As I said many times before, dreams can be weird, surreal, even. There’s nothing special about it. This dream is most likely a combination of your fears of losing control, fueled by some piece of media. Do you recall anything you’ve-?”

“It’s not just a dream, doc. I know it’s not,” he cut me off, his voice high-pitched and close to cracking. “One day, I too, like all those things, will join the jester’s court, and just like them, I’ll lose control over myself.”

I spoke up again, trying to calm him down, but no matter what I said, my words didn’t seem to reach him. Instead, Jeremy just sat there, mumbling to himself about the jester and its strings.

Then, as suddenly as he’d started, he stopped and slouched down on the couch in misery. His huge body seemed to fall into itself, and in front of me, Jeremy folded himself into a much, much smaller man. When he finally looked back at me, he had tears in his eyes.

“What do I do, doc? What can I do?”

I reiterated what I’d said before, and assured him no strings were coming for him. This time, my words seemed to convince him. I advised him to get a prescription for anxiety medication, but I knew Jeremy wouldn’t take the advice. He had a strong aversion to any kind of medication or substances. After that, I told him to call me the moment something was wrong, or if he suffered from another one of his terrible panic attacks. I also suggested in-house care at the local hospital should the strange dream persist to haunt him. Jeremy gave me a miserable nod and assured me he’d think about it.

After he’d left, I slumped down in my chair. Jeremy was always one of my tougher patients, and his sessions could be quite exhausting. While his dreams were always strange, I had to admit, this newest one was a bit too strange, even for him.

\*\*\*

The following week, in the evening before our next schedule, I hit Jeremy up to remind him. He was notoriously bad with dates and had a track-record of missing sessions. When he didn’t answer, I was slightly worried, remembering the strange dream, and left a message on his answering machine.

The next morning he didn’t show up. My worries intensified, and I considered making a welfare call, but knowing Jeremy’s state of mind, and how he’d react to the police showing up unannounced, I discarded the idea. I reassured myself he’d get back to me eventually, and would apologize for the missed session like he’d done so many times before. If not, I could check in on him on the way home.

As it turned out, I didn’t have to. Just a few hours later, my assistant informed me that two police officers were here to inquire about one of my patients. My heart dropped, but I told her to send them in.

“Dr. Alfred, I presume,” one of them started.

I nodded, not able to speak, half-knowing what they were going to say, and half-praying I was wrong.

“We’re here regarding one of your patients, Jeremy Smith. Have there been any abnormalities in his behavior recently?”

“No,” I replied in a trembling voice. “Jeremy has been doing better for months now.”

I fell into my chair, crushed, my mind racing. I should’ve known something would happen.

When the officers told me what Jeremy had done, however, I could only stare at them in sheer and utter confusion.

“Last night, Jeremy Smith went to a petrol station near his home, most likely intent on robbing it. After killing the attending clerk, he was later shot by the police himself.”

“What? Jeremy... killed someone? That makes no sense. Jeremy wasn’t dangerous. In fact, he’d never hurt anyone in his entire life. Hell, if anything, he was afraid of other people hurting him.”

Yet I couldn’t help but wonder if I’d missed something. Were there any signs? The dream, I thought. That strange dream about a marionette, or as he’d called it, the jester. Could this have driven him to... do something like that?

The cops went on, undeterred.

“He’d been heavily intoxicated during the act, and was most likely on multiple stimulants.”

“Wait, that can’t be. You must’ve gotten the wrong guy. Jeremy would never take drugs or-“

I was cut off when one officer held up a picture that was unmistakably Jeremy, the same man who’d been here just a week ago. What the hell had happened to him over the course of a single week? I knew Jeremy didn’t drink, and he’d never taken drugs. He was afraid of losing control, and afraid of what substances would do to him. Alcohol, drugs, and even medications were a big no for him.

Then I thought about the dream once more. What if he’d taken all those substances to escape it, to not sleep, and they’d pushed him to have a mental breakdown?

“How did he act?” I asked. “Was he scared or afraid?”

“He was giddy with excitement, screaming and rambling on incessantly. Most of it was utter nonsense, just random words and sounds, but a witness remarked, hearing him talk about control.”

When I heard this, I finally disclosed the details of our last session and told them about the strange dream.

“Well, sounds like a freaking nutcase to me,” one of them eventually said.

I had to bite my tongue so as not to lash out at him.

“Seems our man got in a little too deep. Might have thought that puppet thing or whatever was coming for him and flipped.”

All I could do was nod, but I wondered if it really was that simple.

After they’d left, I sat in my office for a long while, cursing at myself. I’d done nothing and thought this was all just another goddamn dream. Now not only Jeremy, but also an innocent bystander, was dead. All because of my own goddamn negligence.

It was these thoughts, these realizations, that drove me on to learn more about Jeremy’s dream.

To my surprise, it didn’t take long.

Once every month, I attend a Zoom conference with other psychologists. During our next meeting, I shared Jeremy’s dream, confidentially, of course. While I lamented the headache it was giving me, one participant spoke up. He couldn’t give me any insight into the dream itself, but he mentioned he’d read something similar in a medical transcript. What I’d just described sounded exactly like what he’d read: a dream comprising inexplicable visuals, a court, a banquet, a marionette, and strings that were trying to get control over someone.

\*\*\*

A few days later, I got in contact with the author of the transcript. Dr. Meier was an older man, one who’d worked in the field much longer than I had.

We decided to meet at a small cafe in his hometown. He apologized for the hassle of having me come all the way there, but he wasn’t too well versed with the internet, and at his age, he couldn’t handle long drives too well anymore. I told him it was all right, and after we’d exchanged a few more pleasantries, we got right on topic: the dream of the jester.

I outlined my session with Jeremy, the dream, his behavior, his fears and worries, and, after a brief break to gather myself, what had happened a week later. The old man was visibly disturbed, but assured me, this sort of behavioral change was nothing that could’ve been predicted.

“Dr. Zimmerman mentioned one of your patients had a similar dream.”

“Not just similar, Dr. Alfred,” the man began, staring at me. “It was the same. Clara, she’s one of our indoor patients at the nearby psychiatric hospital. Her medical history’s a complex one, but dominated by her post-traumatic stress disorder. It’s a terrible story. A young woman confined in her own home for months... Even now, she’s suffering from dissociation, afraid of not being in control, and that all her decisions are being forced-“

“That’s just like Jeremy,” I cut in.

With that, I told Dr. Meier more about Jeremy’s condition, and that he suffered from the same fears. He listened intently and eventually nodded.

“So we’ve got two people here, both with a similar medical history, both afraid of not being in control of their life, who both had the same exact dream without ever having been in contact with one another. Tell me, Dr. Alfred, how’s that possible?”

I was quiet, staring at the man expectantly.

“It’s clear the dream represents their fear of not being in control,” he finally said.

“But where did it come from? Where did all this outlandish imagery come from? I mean, dreams about losing control are usually about not being able to move, being constricted or bound, or having to watch helplessly as things play out around you. Why’s this one-“

“So surreal. Exactly, Dr. Alfred. That’s what I’ve been wondering, too.”

“Well, there’s got to be some explanation. Maybe it’s from a book, or a story, or maybe a movie. God knows, there’s a lot of weird media out there. Maybe something resonated with their specific medical history?”

“I wish it was that easy, but you see, that might be true for your patient, Jeremy, was it, right? But Clara’s under strict surveillance, and has been for years, as is her media access. There’s no possibility she could’ve gotten her hand on surreal stories about losing control and marionette monsters.”

“What about other patients? What if one of them heard it and shared it with her?”

“There’s a possibility, but I highly doubt it. It also doesn’t explain the other elements of the dream, or them being the same. Even if both of them heard a story about a marionette monster, their versions would differ vastly.”

I sighed. The old man was right. Eventually, I opened my mouth, but it still took me a few moments to find my voice.

“What if something else’s going on here?”

“And what might that be?” Dr. Meier inquired.

“Guess that’s what we have to find out.”

The old man gave a bout of laughter.

“Not in all my years have I come upon something as crazy as this,” he finally said, shaking his head.

“Well, then we should be best equipped to handle it, shouldn’t we?”

We sat together in that small cafe for hours, discussing, throwing around ideas, and making up scenarios and theories. Yet none of them seemed right. No, they were all just tries to convince ourselves of something. We probed ideas of a sort of mass hysteria that had only manifested in two people, a reaction to an auditory phenomenon like the Hum, and even ventured into Jung’s theory of the collective unconscious.

Eventually, I set out on the long drive home, but I assured Dr. Meier I’d stay in contact and to continue my research. The old man said he’d do likewise.

While I busied myself on the internet, took part in virtual conferences, checked forums, and even image boards, Dr. Meier proceeded with a more traditional approach, that of phone calls, postal correspondences, and the study of medical papers and transcripts.

Before long, we learned it wasn’t just Jeremy and Clara who suffered from the dream. For both of us, independent from one another, learned of more cases. I discovered a post about the dream in some remote corner of the internet, while Dr. Meier read about it in a medical paper he was peer-reviewing. Over time, we stumbled upon more and more cases. The more of them we discovered, however, the more variables there were. While some people were patients such as Jeremy and Clara, others seemed to be normal internet users. It was nothing short of baffling.

Eventually, I decided on a different approach, one my colleagues might have called unscientific, ridiculous even. Given the dream’s focus on a marionette, or puppet, I looked into the meaning of puppets, and their mention in common culture, folklore, and literature.

The puppet, I learned, existed in almost all cultures, and was always used to project mankind’s image onto it. It was more than just an object, and was used to illustrate philosophical concepts, but also to explore the border between the living and nonliving. In this regard, the puppet always represents something that exists in reality, either on the concrete or the abstract level, which humans can relate to emotionally. Yet while the puppet is less concrete, and less relatable, people can find a deeper, more intimate connection with it. They are not molded after a specific person, and aren’t constricted by norm, ideology, or dynamic. Anyone can relate to it in one way or another.

The most interesting of all puppets, I learned, was the marionette. It’s a string puppet; its body light and ethereal. Its freedom of movement shows humanity’s dream of flying, of being freed from the laws of physics. At that moment, I thought about control. The marionette was not restricted by the laws of physics, or not controlled by them. Instead, it seemed to be the one who held sway over them, just as the jester held sway over the dream’s court.

After this more general approach, I studied myths and works of literature which specifically used puppets as motifs and characters. I read the myth of Pygmalion whose statue Galatea was given life, of Plato’s cave in which the world itself is nothing but a shadow play projected by puppets, of Carlo Collodi’s Pinocchio, and Gustave Meyrink’s golem.

It was Germanic literature, however, which first turned the puppet into a metaphor for the uncanny. Here it was associated with the double or the mask, and became a representation of the strange and bizarre. I couldn’t help but nod to myself when I read this. Many of my patients were afraid of puppets, and I had to admit, even I found them mildly unsettling.

I struck gold when I read the German Expressionists. Their works held the most promising metaphor for the puppet yet, that of using it to describe the human condition. Here, it was used as a representation of a human being denied its freedom by an uncaring, indomitable society. Thinking about my profession, I could easily find parallels to this idea. As human beings, we’re all governed by impulses, desires, and fears we can seldom control. At times, I thought, shivering, we’re all acting like puppets, puppets who are controlled by an invisible force.

Then I began to laugh, shaking my head. What the hell was I even doing?

Eventually, I gave up on this new approach. I had to, for no matter how deep I went down this particular rabbit hole, no matter how many books, myths, and interpretations of puppets I read, I found nothing that fit the rest of Jeremy’s dream. It was too strange, too surreal, and different. How could stories of puppets conjure up strange plains, ruined castles, and rulers being usurped? No, I had to admit, I was straying ever further from it.

In my next call with Dr. Meier, I finally told him about my research, lamenting the futility of my approach and the time I’d wasted.

“It’s unscientific,” I said. “To look at books and old myths... What was I even thinking?”

When I said this, the old man scoffed.

“There are no wrong approaches, no wrong questions, Dr. Alfred. You thought out of the box and tried an approach I didn’t even consider.”

“And after reading all those books, I found nothing.”

“Oh, but you did. While the dream is unique, and not related to any of the common depictions of puppets or marionettes, one can’t deny the dream’s ending is clearly related to the myth of the puppet, and is a representation of a human being denied its freedom, as you put it.”

“Well, but we already talked about the dream’s relation to Jeremy and Clara’s fear of not being in control, of being, you could say, puppets. Other than that, we’ve got nothing. We're back to square one, or still there.”

The old man couldn’t help but agree. While we’d made no progress, however, the dream of the jester continued to spread.

More than once, I was contacted by colleagues or acquaintances in the field, inquiring about the ‘strange puppet dream,’ for it seemed to have become a topic of curious discussion in certain circles.

For weeks, I got in contact with as many of them as I could, and outlined Jeremy’s dream and what had happened to him. I warned them to keep close watch over their patients, or better, admit them to stationary care. While a select few listened intently during these long recitations, and seemed to take my advice to heart, the majority laughed at it, and even ridiculed me. At these times, I grew angry, lashed out, sent them the police report about what Jeremy had done, and his medical information, only to be showered in even more ridicule about over-interpreting an unstable patient’s actions.

Then, one day, Dr. Meier contacted me again. His usual deep and well-measured voice was quiet, low, nothing but a whisper, but there was a feasible urgency to it.

“We got it right, Dr. Alfred, we got it right the first time. It’s all about control.”

“What are you talking about?”

For a moment, the old man was quiet. Then he began mumbling to himself in a barely audible voice. What I made out from it was nothing but nonsense, as if he was merely stringing words together.

“Dr. Meier?”

“I talked to Clara, and she...”

Once more, he didn’t continue, and seemed to be distracted again, unable to keep up with the conversation.

“Dr. Meier, what’s the matter? You said you talked to Clara. What did she say? Are you still there?”

My voice had grown erratic, and seemed to snap the old man out of whatever he’d been absorbed with.

“Clara, she... No, we’ve got to meet. It’s... not over the phone, I can’t. Tomorrow, the same cafe.”

With that, he hung up, and I was left dumbfounded at what had just happened. My head was heavy with thoughts about what Clara must’ve told him to cause him to behave like... this. I leaned back in my chair, rubbing my temples. Dear god, this was all becoming too much. Only a few minutes later, I called my assistant, and informed her I’d not be able to attend the clinic tomorrow, for I had urgent business coming up.

\*\*\*

When I stepped into the small cafe, I could already see Dr. Meier; a lonely solitary figure sitting alone in the back. His body seemed tense, and his hands were feverishly working on something. Every once in a while, he stopped as if to take in the table in front of him. When I’d half-crossed the cafe, the man suddenly got up. I raised my hand in greeting, opened my mouth, but he didn’t seem to see me, and was about to walk right past me. Only when I touched him did he turn towards me, but his eyes soon wandered away again. By now, I noticed the weary looks the few other patrons gave us, unnerved by the doctor’s behavior.

“Dr. Meier, is everything okay?”

For a few more moments, he just stared at me before recognition came over his face.

“Ah, Dr. Alfred, good to see you!” he greeted me.

His voice was euphoric, close to cracking, and he almost stumbled over his words as he formed this single short sentence. Now that I focused on him, I saw how different he looked. He seemed exhausted, powerless, spent, as if he hadn’t slept in days. His eyes, however, were more alive than ever before, glowing with an insane vigor.

When we reached the table and sat down, I finally saw what he must’ve been so busy with. In front of him lay more than a dozen pieces of paper, all covered in notes. These notes, they weren’t... normal. It looked as if all of them were covered in mad scribbles, symbols, and drawings. The longer I focused on them, the more my head hurt. There was so much to take in, so much to find: words, letters, numbers, and symbols, but also hieroglyphs, faces and animals, twisted creatures and stick figures, all coming together in a display of sheerest madness.

A handful of pens lay in front of the doctor, and the moment he’d sat down, he was already busy again, filling in an empty spot with an equation that combined numbers, letters, and nonsensical doodles. I just stared at him and watched the spectacle in front of me in stunned silence. Just what had happened to the man?

“You said you talked to Clara?”

Once again, he just stared at me before he realized we were still talking to one another. His eyes grew wide, and in a frenzy, he scanned the papers in front of him. Then he found the ones he’d been looking for and pushed them in my direction.

“The transcript of my last session with her,” he rambled on.

I looked at the pages in front of me. They were printouts, but all empty space had been covered in the same mad, nonsensical notes. When I tried to read the words, I found they comprised nothing but amalgamations of letters and numbers, words in different languages, and sentences that made no sense.

“Dr. Meier, what’s-?”

“Read it.”

“What?”

“Just read it, for Christ’s sake,” he snapped at me, a concentrated look contorting his face.

Then he went back to whatever he was working on.

As I looked over the transcript, Dr. Meier was as fidgety as before. One moment, he was scribbling on his pages, the next he jerked around, staring at a random object, or another of the cafe’s patrons. More than once, he got up and paced the room before he realized what he was doing and sat back down.

Yet I soon gave the old man no heed, and instead did what he’d told me to do, hoping it would somehow explain his behavior.

After the client’s initial agreement with being recorded, the doctor noted something peculiar about her.

***Psychologist’s note:*** *The patient’s demeanor was different. She acted and appeared like a different person. There was a strange energy and vitality to her. Her voice was energetic, and she rambled on incessantly, often talking about other things in-between sentences. These interruptions have been removed for brevity’s sake.*

For a moment, I looked up, staring at Dr. Meier, confused about him showing the exact same behavior. I skimmed the first few paragraphs center on mundane details before Clara began outlining the dream again.

***Clara:*** *I finally understood its meaning. The dream showcases history, or rather events that happened before there ever was a history. Our universe is deterministic, created by a higher power, and all events have been predetermined by this entity. It put everything into motion, and controlled everything, living and nonliving."*

***Psychologist’s note:*** *The patient was never a religious person.*

***Dr. Meier:*** *Are you talking about God?*

***Clara:*** *Words have no meaning here. They are useless when trying to describe this entity.*

***Dr. Meier:*** *What history does the dream show exactly?*

***Clara:*** *At the beginning, this entity created a place of power, a palace, and soon a court of vassals who had agency of their own. For their amusement, it created the very first being without free will, a being they held full control over. This being was nothing but a puppet, a marionette, dressed up as a jester. But beings of power always hold power of their own. Slowly, over the course of eons, the jester developed a life of its own. Eventually, it broke free from its control, slew its creator, usurped the throne, and enslaved the rest of the court, and bound them to the very strings that once bound it.*

***Psychologist’s note:*** *The patient grew euphoric.*

***Clara:*** *I had it all wrong! Everyone who’s ever been before the jester had it all wrong! I thought it was trying to control me with its strings, to enslave me as well. Instead, it revealed the existence of my very own strings, the control I was under, the deterministic forces of the universe. At that moment, I finally understood what it whispered to me. It asked me if I wanted to be free, if I wanted to have true agency over myself and my life, and if I wanted to know the meaning of true decision, of true freedom. I accepted instantly! All I ever wanted was to be the one to be in control, to be free!"*

***Psychologist’s note:*** *The patient’s face distorted into an expression of terror, and tears began streaming from her face.*

***Clara:*** *I shouldn’t have done it! I shouldn’t have!"*

***Dr. Meier:*** *Why?*

***Clara:*** *You wouldn’t understand, doctor. There’s no way anyone still bound could understand!*

***Psychologist’s note:*** *At this point, the patient began weeping, which soon turned into screaming, requiring sedation.*

I looked up once I was done, putting down the pages, confused, staring at Dr. Meier. Was this the reason he’d gone mad? Because of Clara’s ramblings? The doctor was still absorbed in his notes, but when I cleared my throat, he looked up, staring at me expectantly.

“I read it, but-“

“After the session was over, I disregarded it as nonsense, but then-“

“Oh, come on, Dr. Meier, you’re a man of science!” I snapped in a state of half-anger, half-ridicule. “You can’t tell me you trust in this weird story of God creating a deterministic universe, and some crazed marionette... I don’t know, taking over?!”

Dr. Meier stared at me. For a moment, he opened his mouth, and a strange sound escaped it before he closed it again. His face was distorted in an effort to find words, to speak.

By now, the rest of the patrons were staring at me, muttering to one another, surprised at my outrage. Even the owner sent yet another annoyed look in our direction. I quickly got up and apologized to the man, reassuring him everything was fine.

On the way back, I saw the doctor had plunged a syringe into his arm, and before I could say anything, he injected himself with whatever was inside. Medication, I told myself, it had to be some medication he needed. After a minute, however, he tensed up, was covered in sweat, and his face was distorted by what I could only assume to be pain.

“Dr. Meier, what the hell did you just-?”

I had my phone in my hand, ready to call an ambulance, but the man had already calmed down.

“I’m fine, Dr. Alfred.”

“But...”

“I need to be able to speak, to explain properly, if only for a bit.”

“Even if you tell me you’re fine, there’s no way-“

“Let me talk, Dr. Alfred,” he cut me off.

I opened my mouth, but closed it again when I noticed that the mad glow in his eyes was gone, and for the first time, his face seemed clear.

“No, I didn’t believe it. Of course I didn’t. It’s nonsense, nothing else. Clara’s own interpretation of the dream, that’s all. But I wondered about something else, about control, about decisions and freedom. You know the meaning of determinism, don’t you, Dr. Alfred?”

I looked up and nodded.

“It means free will doesn’t exist, and the world and all our interactions are predetermined, right? Just like Clara said.”

“Now what if I told you our world is indeed deterministic?”

“But that theory has been disproven countless times. You can’t seriously suggest that because of some strange dream-“

The man held up his hand to stop me from going any further.

“For days, I was obsessed with it. Not just control, decisions and freedom, but the dream itself. The marionette, the jester, the ghastly court, and how Clara described it, and then...”

“And then, what, Dr. Meier?”

“I was there. One night, I found myself amongst the jester’s court.”

“But you said it yourself. After your session with Clara, you pondered on it for days. Hell, we both bothered with it for weeks now, even months! You’ve heard it so many times, thought about its details, and eventually, your mind created its own version of it.”

“You wouldn’t understand, you... couldn’t. I felt them, those strings, my very own strings, or rather... I felt their absence, the absence of the control they held over me.”

“What?”

“Just like Clara, I heard the jester’s words, and I answered I wanted to be free. I mean, who wouldn’t? Who wouldn’t say yes? Upon waking up, I felt different, and for the first time, the very first time, Dr. Alfred, I understood what it meant to be truly free, to be able to make my own decisions.”

I stared at him, and waited for him to reveal he was joking, but his face showed not the slightest hint of humor. Had all this been too much for him? Had he snapped?

“This is nonsense, Dr. Meier. Get a grip! All we’re talking about is a silly dream.”

“Like I said, you can’t understand, Dr. Alfred,” he said once more. “It’s not up to you. It’s not your decision to even try to understand. How could you do something that’s impossible, and not part of your predetermined path?”

“Oh for fuck’s sake.”

“If all your actions, all your decisions, are predetermined, how could you ever think for yourself? How could you stray from it? How could you comprehend what freedom and decisions even are?”

I couldn’t help but laugh.

“So, what’s it like?” I humored him. “What’s it like to be truly free, Dr. Meier?”

Instantly, the man’s expression changed, and a dark look came over his face.

“It’s... terrifying, the most terrifying thing in the entire world. The crushing weight of decision, it’s so... overwhelming. The human brain isn’t made for it, it’s not in our capacity. Every second, every moment, thousands of different thoughts...”

The doctor’s face was nothing but a visage of purest despair. For a second, I shivered at his reaction, his face, and for the first time I thought about what he’d said, I truly thought about it. The crushing weight of decision, as he’d called it, and I remembered his behavior, the way he’d acted.

“Freedom is an illusion. I thought I’d escaped the cage, only to find myself in yet another one, one even more constricting than any other could be, even more tightly bound. No, freedom is a cage, the one true cage.”

Suddenly, his eyes grew wide, and he focused on me and only me.

“Who’s more free, Dr. Alfred? The one whose choices are made for him, or the one confronted with an unlimited number of possibilities?”

“All this because of a dream?” I asked, picking up his notes. “All this madness because of a silly dream?”

“And what if it’s just that, Dr. Alfred? Just a silly dream?”

I was starting to get confused. He’d been going on about nothing but the dream, what it did to him, and how it made him think and feel, and now...

“You said you felt them. Those strings, I mean. I thought you meant they were real, and the jester and his court, that all of it truly existed.”

To my surprise, the old man burst out laughing, and began shaking his head.

“Consider this, Dr. Alfred. What if this dream is not the cause, but a mere byproduct? What if something’s changing in the human brain, or the universe at large? Maybe the universe, and in consequence, our minds, too, are indeed deterministic, and driven by predetermined decisions. What would happen if that changed, and nature found a way to break these bonds? Could not this change cause the mind to conjure up this vision, this outlandish, surreal dream as a representation of the control we’re under, and give us a way, a means to break free, by metaphorically tearing apart the strings that bind us?”

“So, you’re saying people are having this dream because they realize they’re not in control, and questioning it? But then why’s the dream always the same? How’s every single person coming up with the same images? How’s that possible?”

“Is it the same, though?”

“What do you mean? That was the very first thing we ever talked about! That Jeremy and Clara’s dream was exactly the same!”

“Remember how they were describing it, Dr. Alfred, how everyone was describing it. What do all their descriptions have in common?”

“I don’t-“

“That it’s outlandish, indescribable, unique. It’s something that fits nothing they’ve ever seen. Images that defy understanding. Colors, forms, and creatures that shouldn’t exist, and have never been seen before. So how do we know it’s the same?”

“But the plain, the court, the jester, those are always the same.”

“How’d you describe a plain?”

I began detailing a wide, rich meadow against a backdrop of distant forests.

“Yes, but how’d someone describe it who lived in a different area, a different country, or climate, Alaska, for example? What the dream showed me was nothing but an outlandish mesh of colors and forms that made no sense, yet my brain somehow connected it to the word plain, because it was the closest to what I was seeing.”

“But the palace, the court,” I mumbled.

“Merely our brain finding words to describe what’s otherwise indescribable. A palace is a place of power, the residence of a ruler. What do rulers do? They control their subjects. The jester, the puppet, it’s a stand-in, a double, the representation of our fear of being bound, controlled, just like the German Expressionists said. But wresting control of a ruler is revolution, often by killing said ruler, enslaving his confidants, his court, and placing oneself on the throne. What if this dream is nothing but a representation of our mind breaking free? What if all these strange, indescribable images are nothing but our very first original thoughts while we acquire free will?”

My head was spinning. This was outrageous, insane even.

“So what you’re saying is it’s all just that, a dream, the result of our brains changing? Because we realize we’re not in control, question it, and thus...”

Dr. Meier nodded.

“But if that’s correct, and if it’s our questioning the control we’re under, wouldn’t it mean us going around talking about it...?”

Once more, he nodded.

“You can’t expect me to believe any of this, this is just...”

“Of course, I wouldn’t. It’s impossible for you after all.”

For another moment, the old man stared at me. Then he gathered up his papers and pens and got up.

“Wait, that’s it? You’re telling me this entire, ridiculous story, this stupid theory of yours, and now you’re just leaving?”

“There’s no freedom for us, Dr. Alfred. It doesn’t exist. Be happy about your own ignorance, be happy you’re not in control. If you truly want to be free, free of it all...”

With that, he turned around and headed for the door. I called after him, asked him to elaborate, but he didn’t react anymore. By now, and from his behavior, I could tell, he was back in his own world. I knew he didn’t hear me anymore, and I knew there was no way of stopping him.

I told myself, the old man must’ve snapped from thinking about this ridiculous dream for too long. That’s all there was to it.

Then I began thinking about my life, about my decisions. Why’d I become a psychologist in the first place? Why’d I attended university? Correlations, of course, because of correlations. My mother’s influence, grandpa’s lavish collection of books on psychology and the human mind, and all the things he’d taught me.

I wondered if any of my decisions had ever been my own. What if Dr. Meier was right, and all of them had been made for me, and were the result of all those influences around me? What if my life had indeed been predetermined? To do what? To bring me here and to listen to this crazy old man’s outlandish story?

I leaned back in my chair, laughing to myself. Yet for a moment, I couldn’t help but feel around, feel around for invisible strings that were controlling me.

And for the blink of an eye, I could almost feel them sliding through my fingers.
