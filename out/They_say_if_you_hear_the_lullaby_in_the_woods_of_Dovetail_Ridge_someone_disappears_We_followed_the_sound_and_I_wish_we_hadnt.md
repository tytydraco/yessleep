People always think the worst thing about growing up in a small town is that nothing ever happens.



They’re wrong.



The worst part is when something does happen, and no one ever talks about it again.



Dovetail Ridge isn’t on any real map. Not the kind anyone uses, anyway. If you asked someone from the city, they’d say it’s just a speck somewhere past Ridgefield, maybe forty minutes east of Kansas border. You'd drive right past it and never know. One blinking gas station, a grocery store that still smells like meat even in the cereal aisle, and a strip mall where the dentist also does shoe repairs. That kind of town.



But what makes Dovetail Ridge special, if you can call it that, is what you can’t see. The way some streets never got paved. The way some names are never said out loud. And how the trees surrounding the place don’t just grow, they watch. They’re older than the town. Older than the families that built it. And I think…they remember more than we do.



I’m Liam Whitlock. People used to call me quiet, but I think they just meant I didn’t lie well. I wasn’t the kind of kid who got in trouble. I did my homework, tucked my shirts in, made sure my shoelaces matched. I was the “smart one,” the “polite one,” the kid who always said “yes ma’am” even when I didn’t mean it. The kind of kid adults like because we don’t remind them of anything.



I lived on the south side of town, two blocks from the train yard, where the tracks screamed at night like something hurt. My mom worked late shifts at the diner, and my dad left when I was six. That’s really all there is to say about that.



But this story isn’t about me.



It’s about Nathan.



And the thing we found in the woods the summer we turned into something else.



Nathan Wilder lived up near Caraway Hill, in a house too big for the people still inside it. His dad had died in a construction accident when we were in second grade. Crushed under a steel beam, they said. After that, it was just Nathan, his mom, and Caleb, his uncle. Caleb wasn’t the type you could figure out easy. He fixed things. Stayed in the shed mostly. Smelled like motor oil and smoked through the filter. But he loved Nathan. You could tell. Even when he didn’t say it.



Nathan was nothing like me. Where I was careful, he was all elbows and speed. Where I waited, he ran. He was loud. Brave. Didn’t care what people thought. He used to say he wasn’t scared of anything, except for his mom, maybe. But that was only half a joke.



She wasn’t like my mom. My mom tried.



Nathan’s mom just kind of existed. Most days, she wouldn’t come out of her room until noon. Some days, not at all. There was always a bottle on the counter. Always a light off that should’ve been on. You learned not to ask questions in that house.



So when Nathan knocked on my window that night, I didn’t ask him why.



I already knew.



It was July, and the heat hadn’t broken in two weeks. The kind that makes your sheets stick to your back. I was lying on top of my blanket, thinking about nothing, and then tap tap tap, there he was, perched on the windowsill like it was the most natural thing in the world to show up at 9 PM.



‘You comin’ or what?’ he whispered.



‘Where?’



‘Out.’



That was all it took.



I slipped into my sneakers and climbed out, the screen already loose from all the other times. We didn’t talk for a while. Just walked. You could hear the cicadas, the hum of a streetlight that always flickered near Doyle Street, and the faint sound of some dog barking into the night like it knew something we didn’t.



‘You okay?’ I asked finally.



Nathan shrugged. ‘Fine.’



I didn’t push. That’s the thing about being someone’s best friend; you learn when to shut the hell up.



But I could tell something had happened. His hands were shaking just a little. And he was walking fast, like the night was chasing him.



So I changed the subject.



‘Wanna go find it?’



He stopped. Turned.



‘Find what?’



I grinned. ‘The Lullaby.’



The Lullaby was an old story kids told during sleepovers or behind the bleachers after practice. Some said it was a sound that came from the woods, a kind of humming that made you forget who you were. Others said it was music that only kids could hear, right before they disappeared.



It was dumb. And we loved it.



One version said if you heard The Lullaby and followed it, you’d never come back the same. Another said it wasn’t a sound at all. It was a person. A girl who died a long time ago and still sang to anyone dumb enough to listen.



There were a dozen versions. But all of them ended the same way: With silence.



Nathan raised an eyebrow. ‘That thing’s fake as hell.’



‘So prove it.’



‘You’re full of shit, Liam.’



I shrugged. ‘Scared?’



And that was it. He hated being called scared.



So we turned off Main, past the old greenhouse, and cut through Murphy’s lot where the chain-link fence was still down. The woods waited at the edge of town like a dare. Tall, dark, and too quiet. Everybody had been in them once, but only during the day. Going in at night? That was different.



And I knew.



I knew Nathan didn’t want to go home that night. So I gave him something else to do. Something stupid. Something better than listening to the walls creak and the bottle clink against glass.



I didn’t care about legends.



I just wanted to be the reason he smiled.



We slipped into the woods like we weren’t supposed to be there.



The kind of quiet that lives in the trees at night isn't like regular quiet. It's heavier. Thicker. Like the air forgets how to breathe.



Nathan had his flashlight, the shitty one with duct tape around the handle. I had my dad’s old Zippo, the one I wasn’t supposed to touch. It didn’t help much. Every branch looked like a shadow with claws. Every root felt like it was reaching out from under the dirt.



We didn’t talk.



It felt wrong to talk.



At some point, the path thinned into nothing, just cracked leaves and busted pinecones under our feet. I kept close to Nathan’s shoulder. We weren’t deep in, not really, but I already couldn’t see the lights of town. That’s how Dovetail’s woods work. You walk for five minutes, and the town forgets you.



Then we heard it.



Not all at once. Not like it came from a direction. It was just…there.



A low, humming sound. Soft, like a woman singing from behind a wall. No words. Just tune. Just breath.



I stopped walking.



Nathan did, too.



We didn’t look at each other. We just stood there like idiots, pretending it wasn’t real.



But it was.



It curled in our ears like steam. Familiar and wrong all at once. Like something you heard once in a dream and promised you’d forget. The kind of sound that makes your bones hurt.



‘I…what the fuck is that?’ I whispered.



Nathan didn’t answer.



He turned slowly, pointing the flashlight toward nothing. The beam flickered. Of course it flickered.



The humming got louder.



And then, just like that, it stopped.



Dead silence.



Even the cicadas shut up.



Nathan looked at me. His voice cracked when he finally spoke.



‘I don’t like this, man.’



‘No shit.’



‘You wanted to come here.’



‘I didn’t mean for this to…Jesus, I didn’t mean-’



‘You hear it, right? You heard it too?’



‘Yeah.’



Silence again.



Nathan’s lip trembled, and he bit it hard like he could chew the fear out of himself.



Then he said it.



‘Where the trees cry.’



Like it was a question.



No explanation. No context. Just that phrase every kid in Dovetail hears and repeats but never knows where it came from.



‘What?’



‘You ever think that’s a real place? Like, it’s not just something they say. Maybe that’s what we heard.’



‘Nate…’



He looked at me, not angry, just…hollow.



‘I don’t wanna go home, Liam.’



That was the truth, right there. Laid bare in five words. Not brave. Not curious. Just tired.



I didn’t say anything. Just nodded. So we kept walking. Because what the hell else were we supposed to do?



The flashlight sputtered again, then blinked out. Nathan smacked it with his palm. Nothing.



‘Great,’ he muttered.



‘Zippo’s dying too.’



‘Of course it is.’



We stepped deeper. And then we saw it.



It was lying in a patch of dirt like it had been placed there. Almost neat.



A fox.



Or what used to be one.



Its eyes were gone. Not scratched. Gone. Hollow sockets like someone had scooped them out. Teeth cracked, blood dried black around the jaw. Its mouth was still open in a scream that had ended too late. Legs stiff. Fur clumped in places.



Neither of us moved.



‘Jesus fucking Christ,’ Nathan shouted.



‘Don’t touch it,’ I said.



‘I’m not fucking–why would I touch it?!’



I didn’t answer. My stomach turned. The humming was gone, but now the woods sounded wrong in a new way. Like they were holding their breath.



Then a sharp voice cracked through the dark like a whip. ‘HEY!’



We both jumped.



A flashlight beam hit us full in the face.



‘Jesus, what the hell are you boys doing out here!?’



It was Sheriff Rick Delaney.



You didn’t mistake his voice. Or the dog, Rufus, barking beside him like he’d just caught a killer.



Rick Delaney was a big man with a face that looked like it had forgotten how to smile twenty years ago. He had a way of making you feel guilty even if you hadn’t done shit. And tonight, he looked pissed.



‘Jesus, it’s you two. What the hell were you thinking? You trying to get yourselves shot? Or eaten?’



‘We–we were just–’



‘Don’t even try,’ he snapped. ‘Goddamn kids. Out here in the middle of the goddamn night, screamin’ like you seen a ghost.’



He stepped forward, light flicking over the dead fox. He paused.



For just a second.



A flicker of something crossed his face. Then he shoved it back down.



‘Turn around. Now. I’m walking you both home. And if either of you so much as breathes too loud, I’ll call your mamas and tell them you were out here lookin’ for trouble.’



Nathan opened his mouth to speak.



Delaney cut him off.



‘Don’t. You hear me, Wilder? Not tonight.’



The walk back felt longer.



The trees didn’t say a word.



And neither did we.



But I looked over once, just once, and saw Nathan’s face in the half-light. Not scared. Not angry. Just thinking. And I knew, right then, we weren’t done.



Not even close.



Sheriff Delaney didn’t take us to my home.



He took us to Nathan’s.



The flashlight beam swung low as we walked. His boots crunching louder than ours, Rufus still growling under his breath like he didn’t trust the silence between the trees. Nathan kept his hands in his pockets. I walked a step behind them, afraid to look at the fox again. I didn’t even know if it was still there.



We reached the Wilder place in ten minutes, broken fence, porch light buzzing, one of the upstairs windows open, curtain billowing out like it was trying to leave.



‘Stay,’ Delaney told the dog, tying Rufus to a post. Then he knocked once on the side of the shed behind the house.



Once.



Twice.



And then he let himself in.



The shed was more like a workshop. Old tools hung from nails like bones. Sawdust floated in the flashlight’s beam like ash. I’d been there before, but never at night. And never like this.



Caleb was inside. Sharpening a blade.



I shit you not.



It wasn’t dramatic or anything. Just slow, steady strokes over the whetstone, like it calmed him. Like it gave his hands something to do while his brain chewed on whatever violence the world had served him that day.



‘They were in the woods,’ Delaney said.



That was all.



Caleb didn’t look up.



Just stopped sharpening. Exhaled.



Then he turned toward us, grease on his vest, one eye a little more tired than the other.



‘Jesus Christ, boys.’



Nathan winced.



‘I didn’t–’



‘Don’t.’



Caleb stood up.



The shed wasn’t big, but somehow he filled it. Not with size. With presence.



He didn’t yell.



Didn’t need to.



One look, and Nathan flinched like he’d already been hit.



‘You know better. Both of you.’



‘I’m sorry,’ I said, barely above a whisper.



‘You should be,’ he said, turning toward Nathan. ‘But not to me. To him.’



He nodded at Delaney.



‘He could’ve dragged your asses straight to your parents. He could’ve called in a search. You could’ve been fucking dead. You ever think about that?’



Nathan clenched his fists. ‘I just didn’t wanna be home.’



Caleb’s jaw twitched. He walked over and put a hand on the back of Nathan’s neck. Not soft, but not cruel either.



‘That ain’t a reason to go ghost-hunting in the goddamn dark.’



Nathan looked down. Didn’t speak again.



Caleb turned to me. His face softened just a little.



‘You’re stayin’ here tonight.’



My stomach dropped.



‘What about my mom?’



‘I’ll tell her. I won’t say nothin’ about the woods.’



‘You sure?’



Caleb sighed. Ran a hand through his hair.



‘Yeah. I know what she’d do if she found out, and you don’t deserve that.’



Back at Nathan’s house, the upstairs hallway smelled like old wood and lemon cleaner. The bedroom we slept in had two beds, but we always ended up in the same one, whispering into the dark like secrets were safer when they echoed off each other’s breath.



That night was different.



Neither of us could sleep.



I stared at the ceiling, arms over my chest, the blanket twisted around my legs like rope.



‘I keep hearing it,’ Nathan whispered.



‘The humming?’



‘Yeah.’



Me too.



We lay there in silence for a while.



Then he said it.



‘You think we’re gonna disappear?’



My throat closed up. I didn’t answer right away.



‘They say it happens after the lullaby. Like…the next night. Or the next week. You hear it, and then–poof.’



‘You actually believe that?’



‘I don’t know. I didn’t. But then–’



‘The fox.’



‘Yeah.’



We both stared at the dark ceiling like it might open up and tell us the truth.



‘What if it’s not a ghost?’ he said. ‘What if it’s something else?’



‘Like what?’



‘I dunno. Something old. Something we woke up.’



He sounded scared.



Worse than scared.



He sounded like someone who’d felt something touch him without being touched.



‘I’m not gonna disappear, right?’ he asked, voice small.



‘I won’t let you.’



It was a dumb thing to say. I was just a kid with a bad Zippo and a louder friend.



But I meant it.



We didn’t disappear.



Not that night.



Not the next one either.



But Gracie Redwell did.



It happened three days later. The whole school buzzed with it, how she was last seen at the gas station, how she must’ve run away, how her mom found her closet empty and her bedroom window open.



Everyone had a theory.



But Nathan went pale when we heard.



Not scared. Not shocked. Just quiet.



At lunch, he finally said it.



‘She told me something once. Couple weeks ago.’



‘What?’



‘She said…she’d seen “the girl with stitches.”’



‘The fuck does that mean?’



‘She said she saw her under the playground. Just once. And then she never talked about it again.’



We didn’t say anything after that.



What could we say?



That was the same summer everything changed.



The same summer Caleb died.



Or was killed.



Depends on who you ask.



Some days, I think about telling someone everything. Writing it all down. Maybe I already am. Some days, I wonder how much longer I have before this shit catches up to me. Before the trees remember my name. 



I’m not brave. I never was.



But I remember.



I remember the lullaby. I remember the fox. I remember what Gracie said to Nate before she vanished. And sometimes, I go back to that night in my head, not to torture myself. Not even to understand it. But to remind myself it was real. Because if it wasn’t, then I’m still in the woods. And I never came out.



Tonight, though?



Tonight I don’t want to remember.



Not what came next.



Not what we found when we went back.



Not how many others we lost.



Tonight, all I want is the lullaby again.



Because when I hear it, I know I’m still alive.



And maybe that means…there’s still time to forget.
