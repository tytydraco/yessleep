2 years ago, NASA confirmed the existence of multiple universes. Built under the guise of being a galaxy observation tool, the James Webb Space Telescope has been the primary source of information for this research. 2 days ago, it was detected that a nearby universe collapsed into itself. In the short moments preceding total catastrophe, NASA obtained an audio recording from the area of space that was eradicated.  
  
This is the transcript of the audio.

START OF TRANSMISSION  
  
Good evening, people of Fera.  
  
For the past 6 years, it has been a pleasure to have served as the president of our planet.  
  
I might not have lived up to some of your expectations, but I want you to know that my intentions have always been pure.  
  
Today marks 2 weeks since the Sun disappeared from our orbit.   
  
The Department of Cosmos has conducted an extensive investigation during this time. However, the limited resources at hand have made our efforts difficult, to say the least.  
  
Many of you will have noticed that the majority of our planet’s plant life has dissipated. This combined with the intense decline in surface temperature has meant that Fera’s situation has become far worse than initially predicted.  
  
I stand here today to be completely transparent.  
  
We don’t have a lot of time.  
  
The current forecast predicts mass population death within a month and total annihilation by mid-year.  
  
Despite our best efforts to quell panic, the riots within several major cities have only escalated.   
  
It was recommended to me that our military be dispatched to diminish the damage caused by these protests. Whether or not this would be the right decision is out of my hands as all defence staff and infantry have been sent home to be with their families.  
  
Although this may not be appropriate, I would like to take a moment to reflect on my legacy.  
  
I am extremely proud of the work I have done during my time in office.  
  
Poverty has dropped by 60% planet-wide and energy has become free to 80% of households.   
  
Despite my triumphs, I have failed you when it mattered most.  
  
The Department of Cosmos and I were unilaterally unable to develop a method for faster-than-light travel. Furthermore, the Universal Handshake Initiative received zero responses from nearby galaxies, leaving us alone in infinite space.  
  
Should these projects have been successful, we may have had a more instantaneous escape from our current situation.  
  
As I stated earlier, the survival of our species has seemed unlikely.  
  
Nonetheless, this morning I received a message from our team of scientists regarding an opportunity for Fera.  
  
Ever since the Sun vanished without cause, there have been a number of propositions created that could offer our planet some hope.  
  
While most of these proposals were proven insufficient, one avenue for survival will be our saving grace.  
  
Now, I must first communicate that this plan has an estimated 80% chance of success.   
  
As we swiftly face absolute decimation, I have already approved the proposal and it will be implemented in just under 1 minute and 30 seconds.  
  
Unfortunately, time is not on our side and so my decision to follow through with the proposition is final.  
  
The greatest minds that Fera has to offer have spent the last 2 weeks repurposing the World’s Eye Particle Collider.  
  
With their adjustments in place, the device now has the potential to create a replacement for our evaporated Sun.  
  
The Collider now sits in a satellite at the previous location of our departed yellow dwarf star.  
  
Should the plan fall within the likely 80% margin for success, our planet and its people will thrive for many centuries to come.  
  
However, if the unlikely 20% margin for failure were to occur, the Collider would trigger a chain reaction that may very well destroy everything in existence.  
  
Considering the possibility of disaster, I’m sure many of you will be thinking that I have made a selfish decision in the grand scheme of the universe.  
  
I disagree.   
  
Our destiny is set and my commitment is how we will reach a brighter tomorrow.  
  
Failure is not an option.  
  
When I stepped into office 6 years ago, I made a promise to protect the people of our planet. With my actions made today, I am finally fulfilling my purpose.  
  
Now, please pay attention to the 20-second countdown in the bottom corner of your screens.  
  
Once it reaches zero, the new Sun will enter our orbit and I will provide you with lengthy answers to all your questions.
