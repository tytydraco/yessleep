I work at a construction company and we are renovating this old monastery into a library. The last of the monks decided to sell the building for money and the state of Tennessee bought it to make it a heritage site. There is still going to be a library and in addition to adding a bunch of books they are keeping all the ones that were originally here. While renovating the building I found the journal of someone named Scott. After reading it I found this part particularly fascinating and wanted to share it.

My brother Sean was never the same after Deb locked him in the cellar for a week.He started to remind me of Dora. He started acting like her, imitating her in a bunch of strange ways. Sometimes he even sounded like her.

He started talking to himself saying "If you talk to yourself enough, things start talking back."

We lived in a house on a farm in rural Tennessee. Me and my strange family, Deb, Dale, Kyle  Sean and me. I was 14. It was 1847.

I went down the stairs one morning to find my father sitting there eating all my bacon and the last of my chocolate.

"This is delicious," he stated with a grin.

I felt like crying. This awful man always did stuff like this.

"How dare you, you awful man! always eating-" I yelled and was cut off by my mother, who came out of the shadows. She walked right into me, chest first and I felt disgusted.

"Is that anyway to speak to your father?" She protested and poked me with a fork.

I cried out and Kyle came out of the shadows.

"Is that any way to speak to your mother?" Kyle scolded.

I started yelling at Kyle and Sean came out of the shadows

.

"Is that any way to speak to your brother?" he scolded.

I was dumbfounded. I felt attacked and betrayed by my whole family. There was no allies in the room.

I stood there yelling with my entire immediate family staring back at me with scornful, blank stares.

I eventually got tired of yelling and sat down to eat the food I did have.

There was nothing I could do as I sat there eating eggs and toast, with no bacon.

The house had never felt less like a home to me. My brothers used to be my rocks, but now they had converted to whatever Deb was selling.

The rest of my family wasn't much better but I thought about asking Auntie Die and Uncle Mike if I could live with them. Both Christie and Jeff had moved out and their house and started families so it was basically empty.

As I did my chores that day, milking the cows, sheering the sheep and sweeping the henhouse I wondered why I had been so cursed as to receive such an awful family.

That night I was awoken by the tarantula hawk fairy. My leg blead as my mother stood there in the dark, holding a fork. In the moonlight I could see an evil grimace upon her face.

"Sometimes the fairy comes all on its own" she cooed.

I then saw some people in white robes come in and grab me. They took me down to the basement. When we were down there I saw all the mirrors and struggled with all my might. It was no use and they tied me to a beam, looking at a mirror.

Dora sat there looking back at me. She was a ways off and just watched me.

I lost all track of time in that basement. Dora always taking baby steps towards me, making weird monstrous noises.

One day after they spoon fed me I felt the ropes come a little loose.

I waited until I was alone with Dora and then struggled free.

I immediately went to the window I had installed last year and threw a large clock at it, breaking it.

I grabbed a ladder and climbed out running into the woods. I would head to auntie Die and Uncle Mike's they would alert the authorities and I would be safe I thought.

I then thought about going to old Carl’s instead and took the left right fork in the road.

When I got there I found the doors all locked and there didn’t seem to be anyone home.

I banged on the door hoping for some response but got none. I checked the fields but didn’t see him working.

After that I thought about heading to the Authorities directly. There was an office not too far and they had someone stationed there during the day.

I went back to the road and noted how I hadn’t seen anyone around.

I walked for what felt like a really long time and finally saw the office.

My heart sunk when I saw that it was clearly vacant, with no one around.

I walked around the field, looking for the usual grazing horse but saw no animals around.

I thought back to the white cloaked men who had imprisoned me and started wondering how many people were really under my mothers control.

I looked at the fields hoping to see a cow, a donkey, something but all seemed still.

After that it was back to plan A and I headed to Auntie Die’ and uncle Mike’s.

I had walked for hours on the road by this point, but didn't see anyone and got an eerie feeling. I was so tired by the time I got to their house and knocked on the door that I could hardly breath.

When the door opened my mother and auntie Die were standing there cackling. My mother clubbed me in the head and knocked me out.

I woke up in Auntie Die's basement. There are no windows in this one. All that's down here is a lantern with a journal and a bunch of mirrors. Dora is watching me and it really scares me.
