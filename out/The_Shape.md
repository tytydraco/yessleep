“Finally, we can relax” we finally finished moving into our new home, and I mean finished, all the boxes were unpacked, the furniture is where we want it, and the electronics are all hooked up. We moved in about a month ago, I know we should’ve been situated much sooner, or that’s how I feel at least. “Babe, do you want to just go out for dinner tonight,” said Lily.

“Yeah, sure what did you have in mind” Oh crap what did I just start.

“Hmmm I don’t know, what are you in the mood for.” This went on for a while, we finally decided on Indian, I could eat chicken masala anytime and it’s been a while since we’ve gone down the street and had the buffet, so I was excited about that, there weren’t many dishes that were available for the buffet, but chicken tikka masala was one and I was going to eat till I couldn’t eat another bite.

“Here, you drive” said Lucas “I’m going to pass out” but before I could toss Lily the keys, she was already running to the truck shouting “I call shotgun” I laughed, unlocked the doors, and helped her get up and in. I drove us back home which was only a few minutes away, and “Hey, didn’t I leave the living room light on,” I know I did I always do, I thought, “I’m sure you just forgot honey its ok, just don’t forget next time though or I’ll kick your ass” said Lily, I burst out laughing “What the heck, where did that come from?” “My Mouth, how do you speak?” “Smart ass” “Yeah, but you love me.”

“Yes, yes I do, now get out” We both started laughing again, I walked over and grabbed her hand and helped her down, we went inside and got ready for bed. I went downstairs to turn off all the lights, poured a glass of water, and crawled into bed, I know it was a small thing, but I thought about the light again before I fell asleep. I forget plenty of things of course, that wasn’t anything new, but I never forget to leave a light on when we go out at night, I’m thinking way too much about it I know, and with that I fell asleep.

I kept waking up during the night, or more like the noises I was hearing kept waking me up every time I fell asleep, it sounded almost like something was moving, it kept moving too, meaning the location of where the sound was coming from kept moving. It sounded like it was coming from above, in the ceiling, we have a little attic that we stored a few boxes in, it had our holiday decorations, some pictures, extra clothes and blankets, you know typical junk that I’m sure I’ll be going through sooner or later. Lily didn’t wake up at any point from this, I wouldn’t say she could sleep through anything, but she certainly wasn’t as light a sleeper as I am. When I woke up from the sun shining through the curtains, the noise had stopped, I wondered when it had stopped must’ve been a few hours ago, I felt like I actually got a few hours of undisturbed sleep. I suppose I’ll have to tell Lily sooner or later though, probably going to have to call an exterminator to get out here, there was a long sigh after Lucas had that thought, “Oh please don’t let there be family of racoons up there” Lucas said aloud.

Not realizing how loud he had said this, and that he and Lily were both still in bed, he woke Lily up, “Did I just hear you say we have raccoons in our home, please tell me that was a dream, Lucas.” Well crap I didn’t want to converse about this first thing this morning, “We might” said Lucas, “I’ll call an exterminator today to come out and look.”

“Can you go look” said Lily, “Hell no, if there’s a bunch of raccoons up there, I don’t want to get attacked” “Please babe” “No” I said firmly, not angry or mean, but I was not going up there if there was even a chance of some wild animal being up there, “Lil, you know I would do just about anything for you, but I’m sorry babe, having a wild animal potentially jump on my head is not one of them, especially when I can pay to have someone come out and do that… I mean check for critters, not get attacked” We both smiled at that, “Wanna go to breakfast” said Lily, “Sure, I think there’s a pretty good diner a couple minutes from here.”

We got dressed and left, when we got to the restaurant and ordered our food, we sat there and talked, “So why do think there’s raccoons anyway,” “I don’t, I’m not sure, it was just the first thing I thought of that I hope isn’t up there,” “Ok so why do you think that anything, is in our attic,” “Because I kept getting woken up last night by noises coming from the attic, why else,” “I don’t know, I didn’t hear anything last night, are you sure it was an animal, I mean, how much noise can a small animal make.” Hmm, I really hadn’t thought about that, I really don’t want to think about what I think she’s implying, “What, you think there’s a person up there,” “I hope not.” I saw the color drain from her a little then, “You have to look up there when we get back home babe please, or call the fire department or something,” I laughed at her, “Don’t you think that’s a little bit of an overreaction,” We both stared at each other for a moment, “I’ll go up there when we get back home, ok, I don’t want to, but I will for you.”

Our food came and we changed the subject while we ate, when we got back home, I grabbed a flashlight and looked around, “I don’t see anything up here,” I climbed back down and shut the door, “I’ll still call an exterminator, they’ll know what to look for, most importantly, I didn’t see a person or any signs of one, there’s not really anywhere a grown adult could be hiding so I think we’re safe baby,” I smiled at her, kissed her on the head, and called the exterminator. “Ok, they said they’d send someone out tomorrow,” the rest of our day was uneventful, we napped, cuddled on the couch, watched a movie, and got ready for bed, typical Sunday.

That night, I took two sleeping pills and had a glass of wine, I figured the noises would wake me up again, I was right, only tonight the noises were invading my dreams, I was lying in bed, I heard something metallic and then what sounded like a drawer being shut, I stared at my door as silent footsteps approached, I couldn’t move, I felt my mouth open but nothing but air would escape, I felt as though my mind was trapped between sleep and consciousness, like sleep paralysis.

A dark silhouette opened our door, looked at me and tip toed toward me, internally I was screaming, but my voice wouldn’t escape, the shape was inching closer and closer toward me, I thought I could hear faint breathing, “SCREAM DAMN YOU SCREAM, MOVE, DO ANYTHING.” I was shouting and wrestling with myself until finally, I could feel the hot breath from this thing on me, it pressed its cheek on mine I could feel it's eyelashes touching mine, we were staring directly into each other’s eye, and it spoke to me, “I see you” it began to cackle and laugh, my blood was ice, my face, and the top of my head had become numb, I felt as though my blood was being drained from my body, my heart was ready to burst from my chest and “AHHHHH AHHHHHH”

I began to scream in a high pitch that sounded like a man being tortured, I started thrashing and swinging my fists, Lily woke up immediately at my screams, I almost didn’t hear her at all, I calmed down enough to pull my covers off, I turned the light the on and looked down the hall, nothing, I pulled my body back in our room and grabbed my phone and sat in front of our door, I called the police and handed the phone to Lily, I told her to tell the operator we had an intruder and to send an officer to our house, she did so and sat in front of me, I was still shaking and trying to catch my breath, I finally realized that Lily had been trying to talk to me, I looked up at her, “Lucas? What happened.”
