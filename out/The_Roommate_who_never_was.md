I had a quiet similar story. When I first moved into my college apartment, it was an exciting but nerve-wracking experience. The place wasn’t anything special—just a small three-bedroom space in an old building that groaned and creaked like it was alive. I had two roommates, Sarah and Brian, both strangers I’d met through the campus housing system. Things started out normal enough, at least for the first few months.

And then there was Emma.

Emma was our fourth roommate.

Except, there wasn’t supposed to be a fourth roommate.

I didn’t notice her at first. None of us did. There were small things—like an extra pair of shoes by the door or a cereal box that emptied too quickly. Sarah assumed Brian was the culprit, and Brian assumed it was Sarah. I didn’t care much; I was buried in schoolwork and spent most of my time locked in my room.

Then one night, Sarah mentioned Emma in passing.

We were sitting on the couch watching some terrible rom-com when she casually said, “Emma’s been in the bathroom for, like, an hour. She better not use up all the hot water again.”

I paused, popcorn halfway to my mouth. “Who’s Emma?”

Sarah gave me a weird look. “Our other roommate? You’ve met her, right? Red hair, always wears those ratty socks with the sunflowers?”

I shook my head slowly. “We only have three bedrooms. It’s just the three of us.”

Sarah blinked, as if trying to process my words. Then she laughed nervously. “You’re kidding, right? She’s been here since we moved in.”

I didn’t press it that night, but something about the conversation left a knot in my stomach.

The next morning, I asked Brian about Emma. He just shrugged. “Yeah, she’s alright. Quiet. Always in and out of the kitchen, though. She must love tea or something—there are mugs everywhere.”

The mugs. I had noticed mugs all over the apartment. On bookshelves, the bathroom counter, even once on top of the fridge. I’d assumed they were Brian’s.

That night, I paid closer attention. As I lay in bed, I heard soft footsteps in the hallway, but when I peeked out, no one was there. The next morning, the shower was wet, but Sarah was still asleep, and Brian hadn’t left his room.

Over the next week, I became obsessed with finding out who Emma was. Every time I asked about her, Sarah and Brian gave vague descriptions—red hair, tall, kind of quiet. Yet, despite all their insistence that she existed, I realized I didn’t have a single memory of meeting her.

It wasn’t until I started looking through my photos that the unease turned into full-blown dread.

In every picture I’d taken in the apartment—group selfies, random snapshots—there was always a strange gap where a person should have been. A space on the couch, a shadow that didn’t match the objects around it. Once, I saw a blurry outline near the kitchen door, but when I zoomed in, my phone glitched and crashed.

I confronted Sarah and Brian that night.

“Something’s wrong,” I said, slamming my laptop shut after showing them the photos. “There’s no Emma. She’s not real.”

Brian looked annoyed. “Of course, she’s real. She was just here an hour ago. She made that disgusting lavender tea she’s always drinking.”

Sarah frowned, though. “Wait… when was the last time you saw her, Brian?”

He hesitated. “Yesterday? No… maybe two days ago?” He scratched his head. “She’s usually in her room.”

“Which room?” I demanded.

Neither of them could answer.

We spent the next few hours tearing the apartment apart. We opened every drawer, checked every closet, and even pulled up the carpet in one corner when Sarah insisted she’d heard tapping beneath it. But there was nothing—no trace of Emma.

That’s when the messages started.

It began with a sticky note on the fridge: “Don’t forget to buy milk. –Emma”

Brian thought it was a joke, but Sarah looked pale. She swore she hadn’t written it, and I hadn’t either.

The next day, a text appeared in our group chat. It was from Emma. “I’m going to be late tonight. Don’t wait up.”

I didn’t even know she was in the chat. When I checked the contact info, it was blank—just an empty name field.

By the end of the week, Emma’s presence was everywhere. There was an extra toothbrush in the bathroom, mismatched socks in the laundry, and faint humming at odd hours of the night. Sarah claimed she saw someone standing at the end of the hallway, but when she turned the lights on, no one was there.

And then Brian disappeared.

We woke up one morning, and his room was empty. His bed was neatly made, his belongings gone. No note, no text. Nothing. His phone went straight to voicemail. The landlord said he’d never heard of Brian, and there was no record of him on the lease.

Sarah and I were terrified. We stayed up all night, trying to figure out what was happening. We decided to leave the next day, but when I woke up, Sarah was gone too.

The only thing left behind was a sticky note on my bedroom door: “Don’t leave. –Emma”

I’m writing this now because I don’t know what else to do. The apartment feels smaller, quieter. I can hear footsteps at night, and the mugs keep multiplying. Every time I try to leave, I end up back in the living room, as if the apartment won’t let me go.

And sometimes, when I look in the mirror, I swear I see her—red hair, sunflower socks—standing just behind me.

Waiting.
