Most people can remember all sorts of things. Faces. Birthdays. What they ate yesterday. Others forget the little things—and we accept that as normal. For the longest time, I thought I was in the second group. Just forgetful. Just... one of those people.

But lately, something's shifted.

It started with a conversation with my mother. She mentioned, almost offhandedly, that I used to be a very quiet kid. Her tone was light, but there was something strange in her eyes—like she was remembering a ghost instead of a child.

I laughed it off. I mean, me? Quiet? These days, people practically beg me to shut up. But the more I thought about it, the more it bothered me. Because I couldn’t remember it.
Not just being quiet—anything.
Not before the age of twelve.

At first, I assumed the usual explanation: trauma. The kind that knots itself around your brain and snuffs out the light. I told myself that maybe my mind had just buried those years. Protected me. Sealed them off behind a locked door.

But then... the flashes started.

They came like static across a broken signal—sharp, intrusive, gone before I could hold onto them. A forest. Something watching. A hum beneath everything, like a heartbeat that wasn’t mine.

So, like any rational person would—haha—I turned to the internet. I searched things like "is it normal to forget most of your childhood?" Most of it was the usual mix of Reddit threads and sketchy wellness blogs. Until I stumbled across a name: Dr. Aimee Smith.

The article claimed she’d achieved breakthroughs with Alzheimer’s and dementia patients. Patients were recovering vivid memories—details from decades ago. Faces. Names. Emotions. All coming back.

Then I saw she was coming to my city. Just for a short time. Only accepting a few applicants. “The Fortunate.”

I didn’t think I’d be chosen. I submitted a little blurb—way too corny, in hindsight—about wanting to understand myself better. I didn’t ask questions. I didn’t read the fine print. I just... applied. And paid. And waited.

Three days later, I got the email.
“You’ve been selected.”

The message told me to contact her assistant to schedule an appointment. And that’s how I ended up here—sitting in the too-quiet waiting room of a too-clean building, about to let a complete stranger dig around in the darkest corners of my mind.

There were three others.

An elderly man, frail but focused. A teenage girl with flat eyes and headphones, her mother perched beside her, too eager. And a young man—mid-twenties, maybe—calm in a way that felt... wrong. As if he already knew what was coming.

I waited. For forty-five minutes, maybe more.
Then:

“Ms. Coleman?”

A woman stood at the far end of the room, beckoning. I followed her down a long, sterile hallway. As we approached the door, I glanced back. The others were still watching me—faces unreadable, eyes too still.

“Dr. Smith will see you now.”

She was already standing when I entered. Tall. Too tall. Blonde, polished, and clinical in a way that made her beauty feel artificial. Familiar, somehow. Like a face seen once in a dream—before it turned into a nightmare.

“Ms. Coleman,” she said, extending her hand.
“Lucy,” I corrected, without thinking.

Her smile faltered.
“Lucy,” she repeated. Flat now. Cold.
“Please, sit.”

Her office was immaculate. She gestured to a sleek chair—oddly identical to the one she sat in, yet when I lowered myself into it, it felt wrong. Like the shape had been molded for someone else.

“You wrote that you don’t remember anything before age twelve,” she said.
I nodded.
“Nothing. Not a single memory. Just… static. A blank tape.”

I told her what my mother said—about how I’d changed. How she’d once whispered, “It’s like they gave me back a different child.”

That part always stuck with me. They.
Not “like you grew up.”
Not “like you changed.”
But “they.”

Dr. Smith tilted her head.
“You mentioned trauma. And a police report?”
I swallowed.

“There’s a tattoo on my thigh. My mom doesn’t know where it came from. She says I didn’t have it before I disappeared.”
“Disappeared?”
“Briefly. When I was twelve. The police found me in a field. I was... catatonic. My mom thought it was some cult thing. But the report doesn’t say much. Just that I was missing for two days and then... came back.”

Silence stretched between us. I could hear the hum of fluorescent lights. Or maybe that was something else.

“And now you’re here,” she said softly, “ready to remember.”

I hesitated. Then nodded.
“I think... I think I need to.”

She smiled again, but it didn’t reach her eyes.
“Then follow me.”

At the far end of the room was a door I hadn’t noticed. As we stepped through, a wave of frigid air hit me like a slap.

“Don’t be alarmed,” she said.
“The body retains memories best when it’s cold. The colder it is, the more obedient the mind becomes.”

I tried to laugh.
“Like when you’re dead?”

Her smile widened.
“Exactly.”

The room beyond was blinding. White floors, white walls, white light. At the center: the chair. Surrounded by tubes and wires. It looked less like medical equipment and more like a throne built for something nonhuman.

“Sit,” she said. “We’ll begin shortly.”

The chair sucked the heat from my body. Metal restraints clicked into place. I told myself this was standard procedure. I told myself I could leave at any time. But the straps said otherwise.

Clear tubes ran with a glowing liquid. Technicians moved around me without speaking. They didn’t feel like people.

Dr. Smith’s voice echoed from somewhere distant:
“Just breathe. Let your mind open.”

Then: the tone.
It sliced through my skull.
A high, needle-thin sound.

And then—
Darkness.
Not sleep. Not unconsciousness.
Just absence.

Then:
Flashes.
The woods. The night.

Trees swayed like they were breathing. My feet were bare. Pine needles stabbed my heels. I was small. Nine, maybe ten.

And something was above me.
Blocking out the stars.

The hum returned. Not from the tubes—but from the sky. From inside me.

Then:
They came.
Tall. White.

Skin like wet porcelain. No eyes. No mouths.
But I felt them watching. Felt them thinking.
This one is damaged.
No. This one is new.
We will keep this one.

I tried to scream.
Tried to run.
But nothing moved.

Then I was on a table. Cold. Floating in air—or water. Or both.

They hovered.
Hands like needles.
Machines that hummed.

My skin opened like paper.
No pain.
They weren’t looking at my body.

They were inside my mind.
Erasing. Dissecting. Rearranging.

This one cries for others. Remove the part that attaches.
This one remembers the mother. Lock it away.
This one resists. Soften it.

I watched as they unmade me.

Then: a light. A field. A house.
And I was home.
But not really.

I came back gasping. Gagging.
The cold slammed into me like a wall.
I was shaking, teeth chattering.

Dr. Smith stood nearby, expression unreadable.

“So you do remember,” she said.

I stared at her, wide-eyed.
“What... what were they? What did they do to me?”

She turned to her tablet.
“You’re our clearest case yet.”

“You said this was a study,” I whispered.

She didn’t look up.
“And you said you wanted to remember.”

The door hissed. Two figures stepped in.
Suits made of that same shimmering, alien light.

“No—wait. You said I could choose—”

The restraints locked again. Cold. Tight.

Finally, she looked at me.
Her eyes—glasslike. Reflective.
“You did choose.”
“You just didn’t know what you were choosing.”

The screen behind her lit up.
And there I was—being taken.
Strapped down.
Split open.

But this time...
I remembered everything.
