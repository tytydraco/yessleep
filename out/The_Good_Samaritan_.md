This story takes place in a rural town in Northern Michigan in January. The town was one of those places that you're not sure really exists unless you're from there. A real “blink and you miss it” town with a population of 300. The only buildings in this town were a dilapidated church, a party store that's been owned by an old woman who is somehow still alive, and the local dive bar. During the day, you'd maybe get one cop rolling through, but that was rare. No one has moved to this town, but plenty of people move away every year. The only reason I was still there was because I'd inherited my folk's house down one of the many dirt roads. 

I'd been out on the “town” with a few of my buddies celebrating one of my friends who had recently gotten engaged. The four of us used to be roommates during our college years. My buddy Seth, who was the one getting married, had asked me to be his best man, so I immediately began planning the bachelor party. We were all working men, so it was borderline impossible to find time where we were all able to get time off. We'd discussed camping in Hiawatha National Forest in the U.P., getting an Airbnb in Tennessee, or even going to the Great Wolf Lodge in Sandusky Ohio. Unfortunately none of us had any vacation time left for the year, so we decided we'd just hit up the local bar. 

We ate, we drank, and we made merry. The food was amazing. If you haven't had a greasy burger from a hole in the wall dive bar, you're missing out. We told stories about Seth and reminisced about the good old days where we all lived together living the bachelor life. The only other people in the bar were a few bikers, a cop on their lunch break, and some guy eating in the corner facing the wall. 

Although none of us were drunk, we know that it's unsafe to drive with alcohol in your system, so we ordered an Uber to drive us back to Seth's place. The plan was that he'd drive us back to the bar to get our cars in the morning since he rode to the bar with me. 

When the Uber arrived, there was only enough room for three out of four of us. I let the three of them take the Uber since I only lived 5miles from the bar. And since it was a clear night and I had a really good coat on, I'd just walk. 5miles really isn't that far of a walk. They asked if I was sure about a million times before I just told the driver to go. Little did I know, this would be the greatest mistake of my life. 

The walk home really wasn't that bad. After 20min I'd already made it a mile up the road. I was feeling good too! I was plenty warm and I was humming to myself. Suddenly, and without warning, I felt an overwhelming pain and I was sent flying through the air. 

I hit the asphalt with a SCRAPE and a SHNLAP SHNLAP! My ears were ringing and my head was spinning. I looked up, dazed and bewildered and saw the break lights of a silver sedan. They'd slowed down, but immediately sped off. I assumed it was because they saw that I was still alive. 

I was amazed that I was still alive. I sat up and took inventory of my faculties. My arms were scraped up to no end, my head ached and my back felt wet and squelchy with blood. It was my legs that scared me. They were twisted into question marks and blood was seeping from my pants. The shock began to wear off and what I had already thought was the worst pain of my life escalated into agony. 

I managed to turn my body to look around. I saw another vehicle approaching me. I frantically began flailing my arms and screaming for help. My heart began to beat faster as I saw the vehicle slow down as they creeped closer. The vehicle was a twelve passenger van with First Baptist Church of (REDACTED) painted on the side. I was so relieved that I started crying. As they got right up to me, I locked eyes with the driver. He scowled at me and drove off. I screamed and pleaded with him to help me, but it was no use. 

I reached for my phone to call Seth. To my chagrin, it was shattered and no matter how much I prayed, it wouldn't turn on. 

Pure survival instincts kicked in. I was closer to the bar than I was to my house, so I began dragging my way back to the bar. My fingers dragged and scraped across the icy road. In combination with my rapidly fading finger flesh and the freezing cold, my hands were in torment. Blood was seeping from beneath my fingernails as they were being peeled off from me lugging my way down the road. I'd made it about 30ft when I saw another vehicle coming towards me. 

The joy I felt when I saw the red and blue flashing lights was comparable to the joy I felt holding my first born. The police car slowed as it neared me. The officer rolled down his window. 

Cop: “What are you doing?”

Me: “Please help me! Someone Ran me over and just kept going! I think my legs are broken!”

Cop: “Have you been drinking tonight?”

Me: “What difference does it make? I need help!”

Cop: “I hate this town. Just a bunch of drunks and tweakers.”

And with that, he drove off. I screamed as loud as I could. I pleaded with the officer, but it was no use. He thought I was just some blackout drunkard who couldn't hold his liquor. He had no clue that I'd only had two beers and was a victim of a hit and run. The cops in this area are cold and cynical. They view rural folk, and other low income peoples from the inner cities, not as people in need of help, but rather as lazy uneducated people who need a firm hand of retributive “justice.”

The cold was setting in. The adrenaline was wearing off. I gave up. There was no help coming for me. No one had enough heart to help someone they'd perceived as a lost cause. I closed my eyes and sent up a prayer. 

“Please don't let Chloe (my wife) find me like this. Please let James (my son) grow to be a strong man.”

I then shut my eyes for what I thought would be the last time. 

When my eyes opened, I was lying down in the backseat of a moving vehicle. I stirred to get a better look at my surroundings. 

Driver: “You awake back there?”

I stayed silent. 

Driver: “You're pretty banged up. When I found you, you were mumbling something about getting hit?”

Me: “Yeah. Hit and run.”

I then recounted my hours of torture to the man, who had told me his name was Graham. I told him about the church van that passed by me without helping. I told him about the cop who wrote me off as a lost cause. That was when I'd realized that I had no idea how long I'd been in Graham's truck. 

Me: “Hey Graham, where are you taking me?”

Graham: “I'm taking you straight to the hospital. There isn't a moment to lose. You could have internal bleeding, brain damage, or worse!”

I was so relieved. 

Graham: “Hey, I know it ain't much, but I have some ibuprofen if you need anything for the pain. It'll be another 45min before we get to the hospital.”

I greedily and unwisely consumed the pills. I was desperate for any form of relief. Around 5min after consumption, my eyes began to sag. In a fight or flight moment, I shot up and looked into the rearview mirror and saw Graham for the first time. I saw his eyes. His eyes were reflective. Like a beast in the headlights of an oncoming car. He smiled and I saw his mouth. There looked to be hundreds of tiny needle-like teeth. My vision blurred. My eyelids felt like they had 50lbs weights on them. Everything went black. 

When I woke up, I was laying on a hospital bed. The room looked normal. Just a bed, a closet, and a door leading to the bathroom. I was hooked up to all kinds of machines. I was in a cast from my waist to my toes. My legs were elevated above the bed. In my restrained arm, there was an I.V. pumping a clear liquid into my veins. Morphine maybe? On the old tube TV, reruns of Andy Griffith we're playing on loop. All I knew was that my pain was being managed. 

That was when I saw him. Graham. I frantically started hitting the Nurse Call Button on my TV remote. 

Graham: “Hey man, you good?”

He said it with a smile. The needles that I was expecting were replaced by normal teeth. And his eyes were a normal shade of light brown. I told myself that I must've imagined them. 

Me: “Your teeth were needles?”

Graham: “What are you talking about?”

Me: “I saw in the mirror. Your eyes were reflective and you had hundreds of needle-like teeth.”

That's when the doctor walked in. 

Doctor: “You suffered from a pretty bad concussion and lost roughly 2liters of blood. It's highly likely that you were hallucinating. It's very common among survivors of a hit and run.”

I was convinced. 

I asked to use the phone to call my wife to let her know what happened, but the doctor informed me that due to a freak snow and ice storm, that all the phones, Wi-Fi, and television service were out. I looked out of the window and saw the torrent of ice. I asked how I was able to watch so much Andy Griffith, and the nurse said that they have a ton of DVDs and they just so happened to put Andy Griffith in my room. The hospital staff were even staying at the hospital for their own safety. They said there was enough food in the hospital to last a month. 

Doctor: “We'll call your wife as soon as we can, but for now, all you need to worry about is getting better for us, m’kay?”

The first few nights were fine. Every hour or so a nurse would come in and shift my body to keep me from developing bed sores. They also brought me three meals a day. Every meal was plant based. Every time I'd ask if they could bring me some meat of some kind, or milk instead of water, the nurse would tell me that they ran out because of the storm and that they wouldn't be getting any for a while. I moaned and bellyached about it, but I happily consumed whatever they gave me. 

The doctor would come in and check on the progress of my healing, and every time he'd take a couple vials of my blood. 

Doctor: “It's so we can keep a close eye on it. We don't want you developing any infections or sepsis!”

It was after a week that I noticed strange things going on. The first oddity was that Graham would come and see me every day. At first I thought that was very kind of him to come and check on me, but I found it peculiar that he was willing to brave the storm every evening to come. I thought about asking him to go find my wife and tell her all that happened, but for whatever reason, that seemed unsafe. The second weird thing was that one night I awoke and I overheard the doctor talking to the nurse. 

Doctor: “His blood tests are almost perfect. Soon we'll be able to move forward with his treatments.”

Nurse while laughing: “Is that what we're calling it now? Treatments?”

Doctor: “He'll do whatever we tell him. We're the experts.”

Nurse: “As long as we keep him grass fed, he'll be perfect.”

I really didn't like the way he said “experts” or the way the nurse was laughing. I really didn't like the term grass fed. But I was on a ton of mind numbing medications, so I didn't think too much of it. Just some bad joke. The events that sealed the deal for me happened the following week. 

On my 15th day in the hospital, I woke up with a start. The lights were flashing red and an alarm was blasting through the whole hospital. Doctors and nurses were sprinting down the hallways screaming “don't let her out!” I was trying to get their attention, but they were completely ignoring me. Then a female voice rang out over the loudspeakers. 

Female: “She's outside! North door!”

Suddenly all the hospital staff were running down the same hall all towards what I guess was the North door. Within the crowd, I could've sworn I saw Graham. What was he still doing at the hospital?

Then a woman dressed in nothing but a hospital gown burst into my room with a wheelchair and shut the door. She looked manic. She had cuts all over her body, her hair was matted, and her eyes were wide and wild. The gown barely clung to her nude body as she turned to me and spoke in a frantic manner.

Her: “We're getting out of here.”

Me: “Who are you?”

Her: “Irene. Now let's go.”

Me: “But why? Why are you running?”

Irene: “Because they're not doctors.”

Me: “What are you talking about? Of course they're doctors!”

Irene: “No they're not. They're cannibals or something. They're trying to heal us up and feed us an all plant diet so that we taste better or something. They're going to eat us.”

Me: “You're crazy!”

Irene: “Suit yourself, but I'm getting out of here!”

She threw the wheelchair into the room labeled “bathroom” and bolted out of my room. 

The alarms kept blasting for a few more minutes. Then I looked out as best as I could from my bed and saw the security guard carrying Irene over his shoulder in a straightjacket. She was screaming and crying. 

Irene: “Please! Please let me go!”

Then the screaming stopped and my doctor walked into my room. He explained to me that she was from the psych ward on the top floor. She'd been admitted for believing that she was being stalked by a cannibal cult. Somehow she'd gotten ahold of one of the nurse's key cards, and tried for an escape. None of this calmed me down, but the doctor looked pleased. 

Later that night, the nurse brought me my food. On the plate there was a small square of meat. It looked funny. Like an off purpley-red. And the smell. I was starting to believe Irene. As crazy as she sounded, this was too much of a coincidence to overlook. 

Nurse: “We actually found some beef steaks in the back of the walk-in freezer! Since there's only a few, all the patients only get a small piece.”

I thanked her and she left the room. I glanced out my window and saw that it was somehow still snowing. I've wetherd some rough snow storms, but fifteen days straight was rare. I noticed the snow only ever blew in one direction. Always to the right. Never the left. I found that odd. I threw away my steak square. I'd lost my appetite. I then rolled over and went to sleep. 

The next morning the doctor cut my cast off to check on my healing progress. 

Doctor: “You're progressing well on your right leg, but it looks like your body is rejecting the plates and screws on your left. Unfortunately, I'm going to have to schedule you for an amputation at the hip.”

Me: “But my leg feels fine? Is that the only option?”

Doctor: “I’m sorry, but this is the only option.”

The combination of Irene’s outburst, the surprise meat, the prolonged snowstorm, and the threat of amputation, I decided it was time to go as soon as possible. 

Then they put me in a new cast, but only on my right leg. My left leg was labeled “amputation.” I then began my escape plan. Although I knew it would be agony, I figured that since I had one “free” leg, it would make getting to the wheelchair more plausible. I'd only have a limited amount of time between blood checks to get out of bed, into a wheelchair, place pillows under the blanket, and get out of the hospital. It was a tall order, but I was not going to let them take my leg. 

During the night time blood check they brought in my food. I ate it, but I managed to slip the knife that came with the food into my cast. When they left, the clock started. I waited til 5am. They were taking less of my blood at night, so from midnight to 7am, they would let me sleep. I used the knife to cut most of my hair and beard off and then I slipped the knife back into my cast. I shimmied my way to the edge of the bed. When I put weight on my legs, they screamed with pain, but they could at least support me for a few agonizing steps. I stuffed my pillows under the blanket, and I put the wad of hair where my head would be. I then painfully hobbled my way to the bathroom to get into the wheelchair. 

When I opened the bathroom door, I was expecting to see a toilet and a small shower, but there was nothing. Just an empty room with a wheelchair in the corner. This didn't make any sense. Why wasn't there a bathroom here?

I wheeled myself behind the room door so I could peek out of the crack. the only person I could see was a nurse at the nurse's station. Her back was to me and she was logging something into the computer system. I looked at the clock. This whole ordeal had taken me 10min so far. I took a deep breath and slowly wheeled into the hallway. I looked and saw that the exit was to my right. Was I on the first floor? That didn't matter to me at the moment. 

I wheeled myself past the nurse's station, past a bunch of empty rooms, and then I heard people talking in the break room. 

Doctor: “His leg is coming off in the morning.”

Graham: “Finally. I've waited too long to take a bite of that meat.”

Doctor: “Well you messed him up pretty bad when you ran him over. Our van driver and police officer told me they thought he'd die before we got him here!”

Graham: “Hey, I was told to hit him, so I hit him. I'd much rather be one of you doctors instead of one of the drivers at risk of getting caught by a real cop!”

Graham hit me? Was the church van driver fake? The cop was a part of this? I didn't have time to digest this new information. I kept wheeling. That's when I heard the alarm blast. 

“HE'S NOT IN HIS ROOM!”

I put it in high gear. I was flying down those halls as fast as I could go, which wasn't very fast. The exit was in sight and I began to hyperventilate and cry. I burst out of the doors and I looked back. What I saw wasn't a hospital. It was a huge wearhouse. There was maybe 3in of snow on the ground, not a 16day storm's worth. I looked up and saw fans on telephone poles blowing fake snow all over the wearhouse. They'd manufactured the storm. I'd been there for 16days for nothing! 

I saw the silver sedan that hit me. I saw the church van. I saw the cop car. I saw Graham's truck. I wanted to vomit, but I couldn't wait any longer. I wheeled up to the cop car. No keys. I wheeled up to the sedan. No keys. I wheeled up to Graham's truck. No keys. Finally when I wheeled up to the church van, by the grace of God, there were keys in the ignition. 

“THERE HE IS! DON'T LET HIM ESCAPE!”

I got out of my wheelchair, my gown blowing in the winter wind, winced as I waddled into the driver's seat, and turned the key. 

SKREEEET CUNK CUNK CUNK

It wouldn't start. 

SKREEEET CUNK CUNK CUNK

It still wouldn't turn over!

SKREEEEEEEET BRUMMM BRUMMM BRUMMM!

The passenger door flew open as I began to drive like a bat out of hell. It was Graham. He hopped in the passenger seat and I saw his eyes. They were reflective. His teeth were needles. 

Graham: “You messed up big time buddy.”

He grabbed me and in one fell swoop, he threw me into the back of the van. He slid over to the driver's seat and put the van in park. He crawled back to me laughing. 

Graham: “You gave us a pretty good slip back there. I must say, I'm impressed!”

He began to beat me. Like a chimpanzee who'd escaped from the zoo. I was helpless. Graham's strength was easily 10x my strength on a good day, but after all the meds, the low protein diet I'd been on, and the condition of my legs, I was helpless. Then it hit me. The knife in my cast. Graham was baring his teeth. He was leaning in towards my neck. I pulled the knife and jammed it straight into his eye. He wailed in pain. The cry shook the van. 

I crawled my way out of the van and fell into the snow. I looked up and I saw the sun breaking over the Eastern sky. I began crawling like I had on the night of the hit and run. Graham leapt out of the van and began walking over to me. He pulled the knife out of his eye socket and his eyeball followed the blade. He came over to me. Knife raised and ready to plunge into my back. That's when he looked up in horror at the sunrise. A single ray of light hit his hand and it began to smoke and sizzle. He roared and got down on all fours and bolted into the woods. That was the last I saw of Graham. 

I managed to drive to the nearest police station. It was the Beltrami County Sheriff's department in Minnesota. I told them everything that had occurred to me. The hit and run back in Michigan, the stay in the hospital, and my escape. They didn't believe me, but they helped me get a flight back to Michigan. I never heard anything from them or anyone else about the hospital. I was just happy to be home. 

If you're ever thinking about walking home in a rural town, please just wait for the next Uber.
