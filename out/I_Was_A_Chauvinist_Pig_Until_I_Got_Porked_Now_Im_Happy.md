Misogyny is the attitude of the community I was raised in, where women have no rights and rarely speak. We kept them at home and slapped them whenever they disobeyed. It's just how things were done, where I come from.

When I turned eighteen, I got my first phone, and I saw that the world outside hated us for how we treated women. In other countries women not only walk around in broad daylight wearing whatever they want, and freely speak their mind, but women also have the right to vote. It made me question everything, and from then on, I allowed my wife to speak. She then told me she wanted to go live in a different country.

I've always secretly loved my wife very much, ever since she was young when she was betrothed to me. I showered her with affection, and I never got around to slapping her for anything. I did raise my hand in warning whenever we had guests, so they would approve of how I kept her disciplined, but I never hit her. I didn't want to hit her, and if I ever did, it would have hurt me a lot more than her, because that's how much I loved her.

When she died in childbirth, I vowed to make her wish a reality and take our daughter and move to a different country. I used every resource that I had to make it happen, gaining citizenship in a place my community had regarded as a land of inequity.

I became an outstanding citizen, learning their language, paying my taxes and respecting their laws and government with full knowledge of how their country - my country, functions. This new place is home, and I am proud to become a part of it.

The best part is that I have learned that the faith of my former country is also here and has adapted and grown with the changing world. There is a deeper understanding, compassion and wisdom that was kept suppressed back where we came from by militant fundamentalism and fear of those in power.

Religion is just a path to God, and I have learned there are many religions, and each of them is alike in their quest for the betterment of humanity, and whether the image of humanity is perfect or imperfect, it is the bond with our Creator that is important.

Enough about me, my family and where I come from. None of this is new to an educated reader, I just wanted you to know who I am.

The dark chapter of my life was discovering another religion, much older and more sinister than anything, making me question all that I had learned.

In my citizenship classes, I met a very beautiful woman who looked remarkably like Mindy Kaling and whom I developed quite a crush on. I kept trying to talk to her, but she had a personal judgment of me and wasn't interested. I kept trying to speak to her and one day she opened up to me, telling me she was dealing with a group of people who she had fled from, a cult, to be exact.

I wanted to rescue her, hoping to prove myself to her, so I listened carefully. I soon became obsessed with playing detective, and it turns out it is something I am quite good at. I did my research, kept digging and it was not long before I had found these people.

I had already gone too far, but I had no idea how dangerous they were. The cult was matriarchal, and they worshipped a monstrous being they referred to as the Pale Sow of the Marsh, which had a name they spoke aloud in their secret rituals. I was disturbed, but I wasn't afraid.

I had joined them as an initiate but learned from one of the older men in their cult that I was in grave danger. Soon enough one of the women would choose me as her mate, and afterward, I would either be killed or castrated or worse. When I asked, "What is worse?"

He said they would make me happy. I tried not to laugh, but he was grimly serious, and I realized he was not joking. I asked him what his fate was, still trying to find the humor and I asked him:

"Well, what was your fate? Did they castrate you or kill you?"

He then made scissor snips in the air, his saturnine countenance spoiling my fun.

I played the part of the good initiate, already having a good idea of how to deal with fanatic religious leaders who used sexism to maintain control. I kept my head down, didn't talk too much and acted submissive. I never got slapped, and instead I was betrothed to one of their plump priestesses.

I was quite thrilled, because I find chubby women irresistible. Where I come from, they are a rare sight, and I always found them to arouse my prehistoric instincts. I worried though, about what would happen to me, somehow the part about her making me happy sounded bad.

The night before our wedding I became super terrified. I snuck out of the men's barracks and went to their secret midnight ritual. There I watched in horror as they summoned their goddess, the Pale Sow of the Marsh.

The creature came up out of the mud and was like a giant white female boar, except it was not really swine, it was some kind of primordial horror. It had cloven hooves made of silver, tusks that corkscrewed and twisted into non-Euclidean helixes, seventeen oozing eyeholes, two massive breasts that dragged on the ground and three small vestigial bat wings upon its back that stuck out at random angles from each other. The stench made me want to vomit myself inside out, but I was so enthralled with dread and terror that I just sat there drooling and staring with madness swirling in my thoughts.

They called her "Linlamamu" in their greeting, each of them disrobing before their goddess to show they were female. She approved of them and blessed them with a shrieking, sneezing bellow that came out as a noxious cloud, coating all of them and me in a thin layer of sticky dew. When the sacrament was complete, she waded back out into the filthy muck she had swam out of and was gone from sight.

Her followers then wrapped themselves in each other and an ecstatic orgy of embraces and frenetic delight. I took that as my opportunity to sneak away, realizing they would kill me if I was spotted. Back in the men's barracks I tried to wash off the putrid saliva, but found it had stained me, marking me as a rulebreaker. Men were not allowed out after sundown, and certainly not allowed to behold the monster the cultists worshipped.

I was terrified beyond reason, and without thinking I decided to try to escape. I went out just before dawn, but I was caught and beaten with sticks. It was up to my fianc√© to decide what would happen to me.

Luckily, when they asked her if I should be drowned in the marsh, she said "No, I'm still going to marry him. I'll deal with him afterward, according to the choice of three grails."

This was the first I heard of the process by which a priestess of their cult decides her husband's fate. After the wedding I was taken to the bridal suite, and we consummated the marriage. All the while I was sweating in fear of what would happen afterward, but somehow, I had gone almost numb to the nightmare I had gotten myself into.

At least I got to be with my new wife, the fattest woman I could have asked for, and I suppose that kept me distracted from what she was going to do to me later. I mean, I had a couple chances to try and escape again, and somehow the thought of not getting to be with her kept me from trying.

She then offered me the choice of three grails, and it was then that the true horror of my predicament finally dawned on me. I could choose to become a eunuch and live among the cult as a quiet man, or I could choose to drink a poison that would make me die in convulsions rather quickly, or the third option, that she would make me happy.

I had until dawn to choose, or she would choose for me.

I sat there, knowing I had no way out. I had to choose one of these three terrible fates, completely unsure what she meant by 'making me happy'. As she leaned over, I noticed my wife had a curly pig's tail at the base of her spine. I realized I had seen this on all the women of the cult but had somehow forgotten that detail until I saw it again, as it distracted me from my contemplation. I was so scared, that when I finally said:

"Make me happy." my voice squeaked in pinched dread.

She then proceeded to show me what that meant. Later, when she was asleep, and just before sunrise, I was still grinning with delight from the experience. I wasn't going to stay among them, although I realized I was never going to get enough of being made happy. I had to escape, though, and after she had made me happy there was no expectation I would ever try to escape. I can't see how any man would want to leave, knowing what these witches know: how to do that and what it is.

I decided I could live without them, though, because I knew someone else who could help me. So, I made my escape, finding the guards relaxed and not expecting me to leave. When I got to the world outside, I made my way home.

I wasn't afraid they would follow me, because I knew how to leave my old life behind and sever almost every connection. I began to prepare to do just that, but noticed all the messages from my daughter, who is away at college. She has her own name, so they'll never find her. She had left me messages about how she was going to get married, and wanted to come see me.

I called her and she joked that I must be getting married too, or at least have a girlfriend. I said that she was right, and that I would be coming to see her instead, and moving out to where she is. I then packed everything, took all my money, passport and citizenship papers with me and left my home and my job behind. I believed the cult would never find me, for I left no forwarding address.

There was just one more thing I needed. I called my friend who looks like Mindy Kaling and told her I had survived the cult. I told her I was moving away, leaving it all behind, and that I wanted her to come with me. She said she'd be waiting for me.

When I got to her place she was packed and ready to elope with me. I asked her, before we left:

"You've made me very happy, by coming with me." I told her. She winked at me and said:

"Don't worry, my dear. I know exactly how to make you happy."
