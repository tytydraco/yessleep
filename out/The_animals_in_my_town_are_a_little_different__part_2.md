Hi everyone. Thought I'd give a little more info to the animals in my town. I also want to start writing stuff down, because I'm finding it hard to remember stuff.

I listed the ones I feed on the regular but theres plenty others I can touch on, but I'll first start with suggestions from the comments. [AMG-28-06-42-12](https://www.reddit.com/user/AMG-28-06-42-12/) had some sage advice in contacting a local biology department and I furthered it by contacting the parks department. The biology department seemed to think I was on drugs. They talked down to me like I was a confused child explaining how ecosystems work. They told me that these were simply animals that lived in the area. The parks department is where I met a really nice woman name Peggy, she was a lot more helpful. She explained that since I've never lived in this state, or even on this side of the country, the animals might look a little different then I expected. She also explained that our town specifically used to have a lot of traders and wayward travelers who brought invasive species, ones that bred with the creatures here. It made A LOT of sense when she explained it. I will continue to note the animals I find here.

[Darth\_Malgus\_1701](https://www.reddit.com/user/Darth_Malgus_1701/) also suggested asking the birds about the animals in the town. It took a bit to finally find time to visit them. I fed the squirrels and pigeons (I think they're pigeons?) before approaching the black birds. I didn't say it in the last post but the black birds are segregated towards the pond near an alter. The town likes to pay tributes to the birds. Anything from coins to snacks to small tools or blankets for the black birds to cuddle up in. Peggy informed me that the black birds are a type of wadding bird, a descendent of the ibis breed called the sacred ibis, but Peggy said the people who brought them here called them thothibs or something. It would explain is why their legs are so long but I still don't get why they don't have beaks.

Anyway, the black birds took my tribute (a meal from the mom and pop place I frequent, it seems to be the black birds favorite too) and asked about the animals in the town: why were they different? The three I was feeding had different answers, maybe you guys can make sense of it.

The largest (fattest) one said - "Do not look inside the barrel of a gun with your finger on the trigger."

The oldest (I think it was the oldest) one said - "A man with all the materials and know how to build a home must stop looking for people to do it for him."

And the scruffiest one said - "Question not what see, but the impact of your actions."

All I got from that was to stop questioning shit. Which only makes me want to question more. So I bothered my boyfriend about it. He's lived here far longer than I, and has informed me that I shouldn't keep bothering the black birds for advice. He said that over doing it on seeking advice makes people act weird. I'm inclined to believe him, I wanted to ask them again what their riddles meant but I think they'd answer in more riddles.

Speaking of my boyfriend the pigeons I mentioned earlier are assholes to us. The pigeons only speak in insults. But these birds have beaks! They're relatively normal, I think! Each one is gray or brown, feathered, two wings, two beaks, four legs and six eyes. Kinda remind me of spiders back home, with the weird segmented bodies. Creepy little bastards. They're very good at using insults accurately, they really know how to dig into insecurity and they remember shit. You shoo them away from a picnic table? Hope you like being followed for a week being called fat, or told that no one will truly know or love the real you, or- my favorite- you are proof God makes mistakes.

I made enemies with them because I thought it was hilarious that my biggest enemies was a flock of six-eyed pigeon looking birds. Unfortunately, I've pissed them off to a point they now bother my boyfriend too. Since an incident where the pigeons found out what window was my boyfriends bedroom window and interrupted an intimate moment by calling us slurs, we've both installed black out curtains. I keep finding my window open when I wake up in the morning. Anyone have ideas on how to install a non-invasive lock on a window? It's a usual double-hung.

I am concerned about the water though. I do know that the water here is... bad. Constant reminders to not drink from the tap and its critical to have good piping to make sure it's filtered for cooking and bathing. I know the animals don't get that though. I don't think that could be the only thing that makes them so different than the animals back home. To be fair, and trying to not to break reddit rules of revealing personal information, my job is with a company that produces a lot of chemical waste. I don't know if that affects water supply, I'm just an analytics guy, not a bio chem guy.

I also decided to go to a local park to try and see if I can find any more animals I haven't seen in the city. I noticed that the air in the forest is really hard to breathe, like a sauna meets a smoker bar. It also doesn't have the smell the city does. The city is clean and cool, no bad smells unless you walk past dumpsters, but the forest smells sickly sweet like rot. The greenish-gray clouds were over bearing, terrifying. Everything was so loud and yet there wasn't a single person there. Just winds and rumbles of thunder. It reminded me why I don't leave the city. Nothing compares to the city. 

I only saw two animals. I saw a snake I nearly stepped on. I stumbled back when it screamed at me, and watched as it scuttled into a lake. Around the time I was on my way out, the sun was setting and I heard squealing. Pained screaming of something and something snarling. I regret it now but I investigated. By the time I found it, the squealing was done.

I saw a deer, at least I think it was a deer. It had the big doe eyes and ears I was used to, but its mouth was... wrong. It had a long snout, like that of a wolf, gnarled, yellow teeth, perfect for tearing flesh. and it's legs were stronger. I thought all deer creatures had thin stick like legs, but this one was... she was muscular. In my home town growing up, I had a neighbor who owned an American bulldog that he let free roam the neighborhood, big ol' muscular thing. I remember one time when I was walking home from a friends house during sunset, and I heard the thing behind me. Could see the muscles moving when it ran, could feel it's strength when it tackled me and tried to go for my neck, only stopped by my skinny 8-year-old arm. Thats the only comparison I have for this thing. 

I was ready to get attacked, feeling my body shake. But it just stared at me, never breaking eye contact as it walked backwards back into the woods dragging its kill with it. I didn't see what it was. I was unsettled. Do deers eat meat? I've never heard of it before.

I had trouble sleeping after that. I brought it up to my boyfriend and he said that's just how the deers were around here and comforted me. Something felt so wrong, I feel like I should report the deer to the parks department or animal control if they have that here. The doe didn't have fur either, her skin was tight black, and veiny. It felt like I wasn't meant to see it.

On a brighter side, I started feeding a stray cat. She's a cute little thing, looks like a little teddy bear. She likes to hangs around the dumpster by my work. I am freaked out by her tail but she hasn't stung me yet. Hopefully I can get her inside.

My boyfriend also refuses to stay at my place now because of Kenny's dog licking his feet at night. I'm trying to work with the landlord to let me get a different door knob that has a lock but he's being difficult. Kenny says I should just get a chair and put it under the door knob so his dog can't get in. I think he should crate his damn dog but whatever.

I'll try to update again soon. Until then if you all have any ideas on what might be going on, let me know.
