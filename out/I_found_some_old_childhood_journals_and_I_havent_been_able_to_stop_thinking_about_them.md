I’ve always been a forgetful person. Once, in second or third grade, I forgot not only my backpack, but also my shoes at school. My parents are the same way. It’s just something we’ve always had to deal with. I always assumed, at least until I was already into my teenage years, that everyone else did too. I started taking Ritalin and Adderall and whatever else, cycling through those little colorful pills one after another. Attention-deficit disorder, they said. Maybe it’s autism spectrum disorder, or obsessive-compulsive disorder, or this disorder, or that disorder. I forget people’s names, forget the name of the place I vacationed to only a year ago, forget where my office is. Sometimes I even forget that I forget. It’s not like I can’t function, though. I just have to make lists, put reminders on my phone, things like that. When I was around nine or so years old, I started journaling to try and keep track of things and names. It worked, to an extent. Even if it didn’t help me remember, it at least let me go back and check. All that to say, a lot of my childhood is a blur.

Let me get to the point. Last week, I bit the bullet and made the drive from my little town in New York to my parent’s place in Connecticut. I don’t visit them often, partially because of the drive, partially because our relationship is sort of stagnant and awkward. Don’t get me wrong; I do love them. They love me. I don’t know why exactly, maybe it has to do with our memory issues, but it’s always just sort of dry and tense when I visit them. Nevertheless, I still do it every now and again. This time, they asked me to clean out the attic; with no heads-up, of course. Mostly the usual suspects up there. In fact, all the usual suspects. I knocked down and wiped away the vast mountains of spiderwebs, cleared out the bones of some long-dead rodent, brought cardboard boxes of junk slowly down the ladder, and used nearly an entire bottle of air freshener to give some semblance of fresh-ish air. I don’t know who thought it was a good idea not to put a window up there, but I digress.

Forgive me if I ramble. I’m still in a state of shock and it’s hard to keep my thoughts clear. One of the very last boxes I brought down contained a stack of my old childhood journals, years nine to eighteen. I keep reading these journals over and over again trying to force some vague memory out, but nothing is coming to me. I had no idea my parents saved them, or why they never told me about them. When I asked them about it, they claimed they didn’t even remember saving them.

I thought, hey, what if I can remember some of those things I’d forgotten? Honestly, I was sort of excited to read them. That night, after we finished our day and went out to the local pseudo-Italian spot, I fell into my old childhood bed and opened up the first one. Now, you have to remember, these journals were absolutely full. Not to mention the nearly illegible handwriting and sad attempt at grammar and spelling. Anyways, it was mostly complaints about how hard school was, hangouts at friend’s houses, that sort of thing. It’s about what I expected, but it was really fun to go back and read about what I’d been up to back then. Every now and then there’d be something sort of interesting, but nothing really notable until I got to the third journal of my ninth year.

I figure the best way to do this is to just try and transcribe it the best I can. I’ve corrected the spelling, but know that this was a pain to try and decipher. I’ll try and explain a little bit afterwards:

*April 13 2003*

*Today I played in the woods with Andy and D and we played knights and killed a dragon. His mom made us macaroni pizza and salad and then we watched a movie called Dinosaur. We made a fort in his bedroom around his bunk bed and his little brother cried when we wouldn’t let him take the bottom bunk because he was scared of falling. He only stopped when we put pillows everywhere so that if he fell he would land on the pillows but then he said that he was still scared so Andy asked why and he said he didn’t like being looked at. I said we weren’t going to look at him and he said not us. He said that when he slept on the top bunk that sometimes he would see someone looking at him. I was sick of him so I said that I’d just sleep in the top bunk and everyone else could sleep down below. I’m not scared of being looked at. That’s dumb. Everyone else is asleep now but I can’t fall asleep. Tomorrow I hope…*

And I went on to describe what I wanted to do tomorrow so that I didn’t forget about it. That’s a habit I still have. For a little background on this, Andy was my earliest friend. We met in preschool. We don’t talk much anymore, but occasionally I’ll send him a happy birthday text or whatever. My other friend, Derrick, didn’t have a brother, so I guess we were at Andy’s house. I’m sure I don’t have to explain why this passage was a little creepy, but it wasn’t hard to brush off. Children have active imaginations, right? Nevertheless, when I first read it, I had to get up to twist shut the blinds of my window. I kept reading and eventually I forgot about it. Stopped actively thinking about it, at least. That was, until I came to this next part:

*April 18 2003*

*…Andy’s little brother is so annoying he won’t stop following us around. Today in school I failed a math test but the teacher said I could retake it and she’d help me. Andy me and his brother were walking to the bus and he kept talking about the eyes in the window and he asked me if I saw them. I don’t know what he’s talking about. He always wants to play games like Andy and I but he doesn’t know how and he’s annoying. But he kept talking about it so I went back and read and he talked about being watched before when I went to Andy’s house. Tomorrow I’ll tell him that I didn’t see anything and maybe he’ll stop.*

Poor Mark; that’s Andy’s little brother. We actually got along pretty well a few years later and he became a part of our friend group. This next entry might seem pointless at first, but I promise it’ll make sense:

*May 2 2003*

*I forgot to write yesterday but I remembered something from yesterday I wanted to remember. I was playing by the window with my legos after dinner and watching the TV but when I looked outside I got scared because I saw someone standing there on the other side of the street. He wasn’t looking at me but he was standing there weirdly for a while and then he kept walking. I couldn’t see him very well but he had a lot of clothes on. I built a house for my legos and pretended like they were wrestlers and were fighting it was fun.*

So what, I was building a Lego house and saw someone outside. They weren’t looking at me or anything, and I can’t imagine they were standing there for more than a few seconds. Probably someone checking their watch on a walk. I didn’t think anything of this entry at first, it sort of bled into everything else. I only realized how weird it was after I read these a few days later:

*May 4 2003*

*…and I saw the guy outside my house again but this time he was sitting in a tree behind my house and it was very scary. My dad opened the backdoor and was yelling and when I ran over I saw him in the tree and he jumped down and ran away. It was very scary and it was very dark so my dad tried to chase him but he didn’t see where he went and he came back and told us to make sure all the doors were locked.*

*May 5 2003*

*I’m getting ready for school and saw my dad sitting in the chair downstairs asleep and I heard mom ask him if he was there all night but he didn’t say yes or no…*

At this point, I was getting a little freaked out. I would’ve gotten out of bed to go ask my dad about it, but he was asleep. What else could I do but keep reading? This next one was long, so I’m going to cut it down for you:

*May 12 2003*

*…and since Bryan lived so close we could just walk to his house instead of waiting at the bus because that’s what he does everyday. When we got there his parents were making spaghetti so we watched Spongebob but his mom got angry so she made us watch Toy Story instead…and later after we finished eating we played Bryan’s PS2 and took turns because he only had two controllers. After that we were supposed to go to sleep but we stayed up talking and we snuck snacks. At ten Bryan said we should sneak out and go to the playground next door but Andy really didn’t want to and neither did I but everyone else did so we snuck out through his window because he said he did it all the time. So we went to the playground and played man on woodchips but we started to get tired so we went back. When we got there and were climbing back in the window, Joey looked really sick when we got inside and he sat down on the floor. Someone asked him what was wrong and he pointed at our backpacks and we saw that they were all open and someone dumped them out. We tried to figure out who did it but we didn’t know. All of our stuff was still there except someone stole my old journal. I don’t know who took it but they wouldn’t give it back to me.*

Very weird. It was at this point that I realized something was really wrong. There wouldn’t have been time for any of the guys to dump out all of our backpacks, and no reason for them to take my journal. I can’t remember that night at all but it just doesn’t make any sense. I mean, I suppose it might have been possible for someone to do all that, and that’s the hope I was hanging onto. The more I read, the less I believed that.

Let me take a pause here to tell you something about where I grew up. Connecticut is a beautiful state with rolling mountains, dense woodlands, and generally decent cities. The town I grew up in was pretty rural. I won’t say the name of it for my own privacy, but just know it’s the kind of place without any privacy. That’s part of why I moved away. When everyone knows your name, and everyone has dated everyone else in school, and people know about things you’d rather keep private, it can get pretty grating. Point being, there’s a lot of forest around us, and that’s where we’d be playing most of the time. Only a few kids had gaming systems, which made them superbly popular, but the rest of us had to entertain ourselves outside and go exploring. That is one of the things I remember from my childhood: exploring.

There was an absence in the next month of anything related to this all; at least, I didn’t notice anything. Nothing happened until that summer after school let us free. These next entries here take place during one of our jungle treasure hunter adventures:

*June 20 2003*

*Today I’m going to go out with Andy D Bryan Joey and Mark. I packed my backpack this morning with water bottles and granola bars and a flashlight in case we’re out late. I told my mom we were going to go to Bryan’s house so that we can go anywhere we want. I want to go to the lake and swim so we’re all bringing our trunks.*

*June 20 2003 2*

*Success! Joey even brought spray so the bugs won’t bite us. We just ate lunch and we swam so now we’re all hanging out and napping so I wanted to write in my journal. The lake was really cold at first but we got used to it. While I was swimming a fish brushed against my foot and it made me scream so everyone laughed but then the same thing happened to Mark so we laughed at him too. It was really fun. It’s hot out now. I love the summer and wish winter never came even though it’s really hot. Soon we’re going to go look at the old house because Mark says that he thinks he can sneak some of his dad’s tools out and fix it up and that can be where we hangout. That would be really cool. As soon as we’re all dry we’re going to go.*

The[ old house](https://imgur.com/a/old-house-eK3QYO0) that I’m talking about there isn’t the abandoned Victorian mansion you might be imagining. It was just an old cabin that nobody’s lived in for god knows how long; it had mostly fallen in on itself and was no bigger than one room. I know this because I actually went out there after I read the journals to try and put the whole picture together. I went to just about everywhere mentioned in these journals during those days I was in Connecticut, and since then, I’m trying to reach out to some old friends to see if they know anything else.

*June 20 2003 3*

*The house is super cool but other people hang out here because we found cans and stuff. The roof on one side is broken but D says he can fix it. He wants me to make a* [drawing](https://imgur.com/a/old-house-OYJpMSP) *so he can make plans*

*June 20 2003 4*

*I’m really tired. We just ran for a long time and now we’re all hiding behind a big tree. While everyone was inside talking me and Andy went out so I could draw the house. It was all fine but then Andy stopped talking and when I looked over he couldn’t stop looking at the path we came in on, even when I poked him. I asked him what was wrong and he said he thought he saw someone standing out there and looking at us. I looked where he was looking and I saw a man there standing next to a tree. He was really scary so I screamed and we all started running. He was so far away but I thought he looked familiar but I can’t remember from when.*

There’s another entry from June 20th but it’s just about the trip back home. No more oddities. After the drawing of the house, I drew [this](https://imgur.com/a/figure-woods-Fv7vVYa).

This is where I stopped reading when I originally picked these things up. I went to wake my parents up, even though it was eleven o’clock at night, to ask them if they remembered me talking about any of this. Like I was some kid scared of something in his closet. Really, I might have been. Maybe I still am.

To my shock, my dad actually did have something to say about it all. He said that when I was about ten years old, I started acting very strangely. Talked less, always a little nervous. He said he remembered a time where he came into my room without knocking and I started screaming and punching him. I showed them some of the entries and pictures but neither of them had anything to say about it except that it was creepy. It was possible I never told them. My dad was a little upset that I’d woken them up for this and I felt pretty silly about it too. Mom was a little more shaken. The next morning she told me that she wasn’t able to fall asleep the night before after I’d woken them up. I felt bad about that. I didn’t touch the journals the whole rest of that day; we were supposed to go out for a nice meal and spend the day at the park. Still, the whole mood was a little dampered, and I couldn’t stop thinking about the things. As soon as I found time, I kept reading through them.

Something you have to understand, and that I mentioned a bit before, was that these journals were absolutely full. Trying to pick out the entries related to this took an extremely long time. I’ve probably spent close to twenty hours trying to compile these all together in a way that’s coherent.

Anyways, I don’t mean to keep interrupting, but I want to keep my thoughts straight on this whole thing. Writing this all down might help me remember, or so I hope. I’ll put in the next few entries without butting in:

*July 4 2003*

*I just got back from the fireworks. They were really cool. Uncle Stu grilled hotdogs for us and we drank lemonade and then we looked at Pat’s Pokémon cards. It was really fun. I saw all my cousins and Pat and I played Mario Kart Double Dash. He has a big basement so we were down there until my dad called me up and made me sit down at the dinner table. He showed me a piece of paper that someone wrote Hello on and asked me who it was from but I didn’t know so I went back down to the basement.*

*July 7 2003*

*Today when I went outside to play I found another piece of paper like the one dad showed me outside but this time it said Hello Ethan Do You Want To Play so I went over to Henry’s house next door and asked if it was from him but he said no. I also asked Alex Andy and D and Jake but they all said it wasn’t them. I didn’t recognize the handwriting but it was really bad and hard to read. Whoever wrote it must have needed to leave quick and maybe didn’t finish it. I’ll leave a message for them beneath a rock on the porch where mom and dad can’t see.*

*July 9 2003*

*…and when I got home they found the note I left for them. It asked who wrote the note and the new one they put there said it was Your Friend but it didn’t say who so I made another one asking who…*

*July 10 2003 1*

*…so the new note told me to Guess Who It Is and so I wrote on the paper Are You Andy?*

*July 10 2003 2*

*When I got home from school, there was a new note for me. They said it isn’t Andy writing and then asked if I wanted to find out who it was so I wrote a note and said yes for them to tell me who it is.*

*July 12 2003*

*The new note said that if I wanted to find out who it was, then I had to go meet them at the park by my friend’s house so I guess that’s Bryan.*

Alright. If the rest wasn’t worrying to you, these sure as hell should be. Surprisingly, there wasn’t an entry about whether or not I went to the park, or what happened there. I read over and over to try and find it, just in case I missed it, but lo and behold, nothing. The next entry related to this all is actually about Mark, Andy’s little brother. Before you read this, I need to mention that I actually do remember this; it was a pretty big deal at the time:

*July 19 2003*

*Andy didn’t come out to play with us today. We waited for Mark to ask if he was sick, but he didn’t come either. When I got home mom was crying and she told me that Mark was missing. She said when his parents were waking them up that they couldn’t find him anywhere. Andy is really sad she told me. I am too. I hope they find him even though he’s really annoying.*

*July 22 2003*

*Mark and Andy came out to play today. I asked Mark where he was but he didn’t want to talk about it. He didn’t talk much the whole day even when we went to McDonald’s.*

Before I get onto the next entries, I want to include a text conversation I had with Andy and Mark a few days ago about this. I didn’t tell them all about the journals, because I didn’t want them worrying or thinking I was crazy. Just so it’s clear: I’m E, Andy’s A, and Mark’s M.

*E: So what really happened when you were gone, Mark? I never found out where you were. I’d forgotten all about that until just recently.*

*M: Honestly? I don’t really remember. I was very young at the time. I must have been six years old at the very most. I do remember when I actually ran away. I snuck out in the middle of the night and spent god, I don’t know. Maybe a whole hour tip-toeing to make sure I didn’t make a single creak. You remember how creaky our house was?*

*A: Yeah. I should have woken up.*

*E: Do you remember what made you run away? Or do you have any idea?*

*M: Well, I have a guess. At the time, I was really scared of being watched for some reason. I thought someone was watching me from the windows, the ceiling. Maybe I just got scared of that.*

*A: Oh yeah, I remember that. Ethan, do you remember when you had to take the top bunk because he thought someone was watching him?*

*M: Yes.*

*E: You know what? The more I think about it, the more I think that might not be right. I feel like this was after that whole fear-of-being-watched thing. Because I remember that during school, not the summer. Do you remember, Andy?*

*A: Not really. I do remember you got over it after a while.*

*E: Interesting.*

*A: You said something like, “He’s not watching me anymore.” I do remember that, because it freaked me out.*

*M: Weird time for sure. I really don’t know what spooked me, that’s the only thing I can think of.*

*E: You don’t remember where you went?*

*M: I don’t think I ever left the area. I think I might have been in the woods for a little bit, but mostly I was in the neighborhood. I was gone for less than a day. They found me playing at the park like everything was normal.*

*E: You were playing at the park?*

*M: I guess I must have been.*

*E: The one by Bryan’s house?*

*M: Oh yeah. Bryan. That would have been the one.*

Sure, it could be unconnected. I’ve thought of that myself. It’s just so strange that he would have been at Bryan’s park of all places. I also thought it was interesting that he “wasn’t being watched anymore.” Here are the next entries:

*July 25 2003*

*…and I couldn’t believe there was a new note. This time the paper didn’t say anything and it was just a drawing of two people holding hands. It looked like* [this](https://imgur.com/a/holding-hands-7IDCyoV)*. I left a note asking what it was.*

*July 26 2003*

*This morning the first thing I did was check to see if there was a note and there was. It says Us. Come To The Park Tonight but I don’t want to. I just threw it in the trash…*

*July 27 2003*

*The new note had a sad face on it and it said Come To The Park Please but I threw it out again.*

Even as I’m rereading all of this now, my hair is sticking up. The room feels colder than it is, you know? My hands are even shaking a little. This next one almost made me throw up:

*August 1 2003*

*They left a picture of me playing with Andy and Mark.*

I don’t have the picture in question; I wish I did. It must have been a polaroid. I can’t imagine what kind of creep would be taking pictures of me and trying to meet up with me at a park. I really do feel sick. I’m a little dizzy. It’s hard for me to say anything, so I’m just going to move on to the next ones:

*August 4 2003*

*…and after Mom drove me to Blockbuster so that I could pick out a movie. When we got back home, we saw someone standing in front of our house. When we got closer he ran away. Mom didn’t say anything about it but it was kind of scary.*

*August 19 2003*

*I just got back from our trip to Florida and school starts next week. The drive was really long. When we went inside the couch looked messy and my dad opened the fridge and he said there was food missing. There was a weird smell in the house like eggs or something but we couldn’t find any. We went into my bedroom and it wasn’t made even though I made it before we left. It looks almost like someone was sleeping in my bed. Weird. Mom and dad were annoyed that I hadn’t cleaned up like they told me to before we left and they didn’t believe me when I said that I did.*

*August 27 2003*

*First day of school today. Mrs. Newart is my main teacher this year and I really don’t like her but I sit next to Andy in social studies and english class. We took the bus and when I got home I saw footprints in the mud around our house. I asked dad if he was cleaning but he said it wasn’t him and that it was just someone walking their dog.*

*September 2 2003*

*…when I got home, there was a new picture like the one from before. This time it was me and Bryan on the swings during recess. It looked like it was taken from behind the fences by the houses behind school. On the back there was a note that said So Fun. I showed my parents and they asked me where I got the picture from and I said I found it outside and they were really scared.*

So I asked them about this. I know we all have bad memories, but what kind of parent would forget something like that? When I reminded them of the incident, it seemed to come flooding back to them. I didn’t record it, so I’m just going to try and provide a half-decent recounting of the conversation we had, because that’s probably the best way to address this.

*Mom: Now that you mention it, I do remember that.*

*Dad: Yeah, me too.*

*Me: And so what happened after?*

*Dad: Your mother and I were really worried. Oh yeah, I remember this all now. Jesus, I’d forgotten about this. We made a call to the police station to report it but they never did anything about it.*

*Mom: You’d think they could do something about it. I mean, God, honey, someone was leaving pictures of you outside of our house!*

*Me: Pictures? Like, multiple?*

*Mom: Yeah, multiple. Of course there were multiple. You don’t remember this? There was that first one of you on the swings, then a week later it was you walking home from the bus stop on your own, and then the last one was a picture of you inside of your room.*

*Dad: No, he wouldn’t remember the other ones. After that first one, we were on the lookout. I can’t believe we never caught the bastard. We found the other two pictures before you did, and we didn’t show them to you. After that last one, they stopped coming. The whole thing only lasted a week, maybe a week and a half. Eventually we thought it was just one of your friends playing a mean prank or something.*

*Me: Are you sure there wasn’t anything else you’re forgetting?*

*Mom: …well, I guess. I was talking to some of the other moms about it at the time, and Kathy, you know, Markus and Andrew’s mother, she said that she experienced something similar. She found a note that had her son’s name on it, I forget which one. And remember when little Markus ran away? That was around the same time.*

*Me: Anything else?*

*Dad: No. Did you talk with Andy and Mark about it?*

*Me: Not yet.*

I had that text conversation with them a little while afterwards. At this point, my visit with my parents was just about over. I packed up everything I’d taken, filled up a box with my journals, and drove back to New York the next day. But before I went, I decided to go and revisit some of my old childhood haunts to see if that could spark a memory. You already saw I went through the woods and to that old collapsed house. I also went to Bryan’s park, the houses of a few friends, my elementary school, and a few other spots. I’m not going to share any of the pictures I took for the sake of privacy.

It was like walking through a dream. I’ve never felt groggier in my life. There was a time a few years back I’d loaded up on booze and gotten so drunk that I ended up a few towns over when I woke up, and just walking through all of these old spots gave me a similar feeling to that. I felt just weighed down, like I was a balloon full of floating lead. You know the sensation of filling up a bucket by dipping it into a pond or wherever? That sort of uncomfortable half a second when the water comes rushing in and it gets heavy, that popping and sloshing feeling? That’s what it felt like.

At this point, the entries about this whole thing started to die off. I’m going to include the rest of them without any interruptions:

*September 23 2003*

*…and I saw* [eyes looking at me through the fence](https://imgur.com/a/face-fence-v2s2LnV)*. At first I pretended not to see so I could get a good look. They were really big and red like they were sick and they were brown. There was some hair in front of them that was black and stringy, like my hair is when I don’t shower. But longer. I asked who it was but whoever it was disappeared and when I looked through the hole in the fence, no one was there.*

*October 18 2003*

*It was chilly out today. During recess I went to the tree that Andy and I like to sit under and when we got there I found a note like the ones from before. I hid it before he saw it and when I got home I looked at it. It says Please Stop And Come Play At The Park Come Tonight Please Please. I’m not gonna go but I’m not gonna tell my parents because they got mad last time.*

*October 26 2003*

*I had a dream someone was looking at me through the window and it felt so real. It looked like* [this](https://imgur.com/a/face-window-h2r8PnE)*.*

*December 8 2003*

*…and someone hid a piece of paper at the tree outside school with Bryan’s name on it. I showed it to people but no one recognized the handwriting.*

*January 5 2004*

*Bryan moved away today. He had a party and it was fun but also sad. He’s only moving half an hour away so his dad can work so we can still hangout but he can’t play with us like he used to. I wish he stayed.*

And that’s it. I went through my notebooks up until 2011 looking for anything else, but couldn’t find anything. The rest of it was sort of nice, in all honesty. People I’d forgotten about, vacations, some fun stories about my first job. All kinds of stuff. So, a few days ago, I was at sort of a dead-end; but I couldn’t just get this whole thing off my mind, no matter how hard I tried. I called up my parents and asked them if they knew where Bryan had moved to, but they didn’t. I tried looking for his name on Facebook and a few other places, but I couldn’t find the right Bryan. He was the only lead I had on this, even if it was more than likely not going to lead me anywhere.

Andy was the one who helped me find him; or, rather, find his mother. She no longer lived in Connecticut, which makes sense after this whole thing. I reached out to her to try and get in contact with Bryan over Facebook, and this was our conversation:

*Me: Good afternoon, Mrs. ---------. I don’t know if you remember me, but I was friends with your son back in elementary school. I wanted to reach out to you so that I could get back in contact with him. Could you help me with that?*

*Her: Hi Ethan. I remember you. I haven’t seen Bryan in a very long time. I wish I could help you.*

*Me: I’m very sorry to hear that. Please forgive me for asking, but do you have any idea where he might be?*

*Her: Nobody has seen him in years. I spent ten years of my life searching for him, day in and day out. I’ve been trying to move on. We put up posters, worked with the police, hired private investigators, everything. All we ever got was more and more pain.*

*Me: I had no idea. Is there anything I can do to help?*

*Her: No.*

I searched through some old records, used the wayback machine. Eventually I did manage to track down an article by a now defunct local newspaper from the town they lived in at the time. Again, for privacy reasons, I don’t feel comfortable sharing it. It was about the headline you’d expect. Local boy disappears. Never a local boy found.

I still can’t believe I did this, but I took my day off and I drove back down to Connecticut. I visited the local police and asked them if they had any information on the case, they said no. It’s twenty years old now; cold as can be. I showed them the journal entries I’d compiled, some of the pictures I’d taken. To my surprise, they actually had something interesting to show me. They pulled out an identical journal to the ones I had brought down. Told me it was the only piece of decent evidence they had.

They let me look through it, but they didn’t let me keep it or even take pictures. I’ll try and recreate the type of thing inside.

*November 8 2002 May 12 2003*

(there was a normal journal entry, around it scribbled ramblings and drawings) *Haven’t looked but saw and went but couldn’t. Waiting waiting waiting waiting. Circles flowing in my brain, a connection. Love. I can’t wait. So excited. Haven’t looked but can’t and saw I saw but I couldn’t. Waiting. When when. When. I’ll wait, and I wait. It’s so beautiful, so beautiful. Funny. So funny. I can’t wait and look but I have to see and I saw.*

The whole thing was full of stuff like this. It looked like it had been left out in the rain a few times, it was blotted and a lot of the writing had run or become otherwise unreadable. The only thing I knew for certain was that it was definitely my journal. I spent an hour or so looking through it but there was nothing good. The police said it was all incoherent and never got them anywhere.

After that, they showed me the house where Bryan had been staying at the time. It was a small townhouse in the suburbs, cookie cutter design and chipping paint. The lawn was overgrown. Apparently the landlord had a hard time finding tenets, especially now that the town was dying.

I called the landlord to take a look inside, pretended like I was interested in renting the place. Wasn’t very big. Two stories. Two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a living room, and a kitchen. It was clear he didn’t take great care of the place. Some of the lights were dead, the carpet was a little mossy. There was a faint scent of cigarettes in the air. I went to the smaller bedroom, the one I assumed to be Bryan’s. There wasn’t any furniture except for a large mirror hanging on the wall. I couldn’t help but stare in my sunken eyes, sucked of all their energy by the last few days. The landlord walked out of the room to take a call, so I seized the opportunity to sit down against the wall and let a few tears trickle out. I must’ve looked like a wreck when he walked back in, because he pretended to take another call and walked back out.

Nothing. There wasn’t anything for me to find here, why would there be? There was only one possible thing to check. I walked over to the mirror, leaned my face up against the wall, lifted it up a little bit. The thing was heavy, cast a dark shadow in an already dark room, but I could see something written on the back of it. Carefully, I removed the mirror from the wall, and placed it glass down onto the floor. On the back of the mirror were the words:

*I Love You I Love You I Love You*

That was two days ago. I’ve got nothing more to go off, nothing left to read, nowhere left to go. No one to talk to. I can’t tell Bryan’s mom about what I found. Who can I tell? I guess that’s why I’m writing this all out. Someone has to know. I haven’t been able to sleep, I feel constantly ill. My skin is clammy, my eyes are gaunt, I haven’t taken a shower. All that to say, I’m not the same. I can’t stop thinking about if it had been me. It could have been me. Maybe it should’ve. Bryan was a good kid, there’s plenty of journal entries about him. All I can do now is try and remember him, what happened to him, what happened to me. I don’t think I could forget this. If I forget everything else in my old age, I don’t think I can forget this. I can’t forget.
