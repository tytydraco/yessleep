A friend once told me that all we see and feel is an interpretation from the brain. It sends out electric pulses throughout the body. Lighting up the nervous system, down to every organ, pore, and cell. From a soft touch that barely grazes an arm, to the breathless suffocation that can only come in waves, that can only feel like drowning.

These terms are no less contractual in a dream.

And no less true for nightmares either.

I've had nightmares so real that it feels as if I've lived an entirely different life. Filled with history, and memories. Dates. Numbers. Sometimes there's a woman. Sometimes there's a man. Other times I am alone. But always I am someone else.

Nightmares that wake me up as if a cold knife had been plunged into my chest. Causing me to bolt upright in my very real, very solid bed, drenched in sweat.

When this happens. I try to repeat the words that I grew up saying. The ones my mother told me. That it's not real. It's just a dream. But all that does, is prolong the lies I keep telling myself.

My brain has seen it. Felt it. Sent the signals to my body, and so I cannot say that it is any different than being real, that these dreams didn't happen to me. I can't tell that to the soreness of my clenched jaws that had been grinding for hours. The bruises that I can still feel on my arms and feet. The pain around my neck from where the wire was hung. Can still be felt, even if they're distant.

If I dreamt it. Then it was real. It happened to my brain, so it happened to my body.

All of the good ones, but all of the bad ones too.

But it was after a particularly horrible dream, that made me afraid to fall asleep. It felt so real that I could still taste the dirt in my mouth from where I wiped it on my sleeve even after I woke up. So real that when I went digging. I found what I thought was just a dream.

&#x200B;

In the dream. I had no wife. No kids. They left me. Or were dead. I didn't think about it. I did have a brother, but I rarely talked to him. Though I did consider calling him first when I got into trouble. Colleagues. Neighbors. I remembered, I remembered where I went to college. If I thought about it. And in my memory were personal jokes. Likes. Dislikes. I know that I hated traffic. And where was the best place to get a burger nearby. Which knee wasn't the way it used to be. Even though the actual dream only lasted for a second.

In the dream I was standing in my garage. Drinking a beer. The thin taste was never satisfying. But it was cheap and widely available. Which meant that my drinking problem, wasn't really a problem.

I hated my job. Felt that there was never enough money to go around. Not enough money to buy enough space inside the cramped quarters I called home. Which explained why I had the single garage door cracked, and a shop fan exhausting the 90 degree Arizona winter.

And due to my discontent. I invited a neighbor to join me. I've heard that misery loves company. And he lived on the same street, so surely it was, if not by choice, then circumstance. So perhaps we would have something in common.

I think that was my first big mistake.

Loneliness.

It's what makes hurt people try to be hurt again.

And I remembered that feeling. Growing up with a mother who was a drug addict. Someone who was never there, when I needed them most. Someone that would hurt me all my life. Into my adult years. Someone that would hurt me for as long as I loved her.

Which was why when Gary, my neighbor, came over to drink a few beers. Happy. Cheerful, and chirpy as can be about his small insignificant life. It made me feel to bad about myself. So angry. That was my first mistake.

My second mistake was killing him.

When I did it. All I could see was black. Taste his sweat in my mouth from where his fingers were trying to push me away. It were as if someone had turned off the lights and only the haziest figure shimmered before me, as if it weren't even real.

And when the light was finally turned back on. I was horrified that it ever happened at all.

My hands were bloodied, my knuckles white - turning blue from where I had struck his face in. I stood there petrified, waiting any moment for the sirens to come off the distance to apprehend me. But no one came.

Eventually I realized that if I kept standing there, someone would find me.

So I did what anyone who was afraid to face the music would do. I rolled up Gary's body in an old tarp and stuffed him into the back of my car.

Drove.

Drove until the gas light came on.

Then I found a place in the woods, and buried him. Working to dig a deep hole. Deep enough so that no one could ever find the body. And I worked. Worked all night to do it.

The entire time I was terrified that I would be discovered. Or worse. That Gary wasn't actually dead. And would wake up at any second. I was afraid that if he did, I'd actually have to kill him this time.

None of these thoughts made sense, as I threw him into the hole. The headlamps the only thing keeping the darkness away.

Up until I get into the car. Panting. Heavily. Dirty, and tired. That's when I looked into the rearview mirror as I was backing away, and screamed. Because I didn't recognize the person staring back at me.

&#x200B;

And that was when I woke up.

&#x200B;

Now. I've had similar dreams. Over the years. Some of them when I was young enough where I couldn't explain how exactly it was that I knew what a scalpel was, or why they mixed cement for shoes.

Things in my real life that made my parents wonder if I was stealing the car out at night, or just a really gifted driver. It's difficult explaining to someone that has known me all my life. That I had actually been driving for years. In my head. In my dreams.

But still, all the things that happened to me. I would explain away. Stuff that felt so real, but weren't. Suddenly became inevitable, the moment I found Gary's body in the woods.

&#x200B;

For the first time, I knew where to find the evidence.

Out of all my dreams, this one happened to be the closest, close enough for me to recognize the surroundings. I had been on that road a dozen times. Camping. Field trips. Day hikes even.

So I borrow the car, and make the lonely trek to the middle of nowhere. And dug until I found an old rotten hand in the dirt.

Gary.

My heart almost couldn't take it. I could feel it thumping in my chest. I've always had a weak one. But this time, it felt as if I were having a heart attack.

Barely even able to breathe, I crawled into a fetal position and concentrated on not dying.

When I was finally able to gather my composure. I had no clue on what to do. I rationalized that I was far too young to be suspected of being the killer. The body was long rotted before I could even walk, much less start driving.

But still, how do I explain this to the cops? Or my parents? That I found a random spot in the woods and decided to dig for no reason. Or that I was hiking and simply came upon the hole and noticed there was a hand sticking out of it? What if the person who killed Gary saw it? What if the murderer found out that I knew their secret? They would come after me. And I was making it easy for them, by having my face plastered across the evening news.

I didn't know what to do, but I also didn't want to abandon the body. So eventually I called the police and left an anonymous tip.

Then drove as fast as I could home. More afraid to sleep than ever before.

Except I didn't need to sleep to be affected anymore. No. It's like after I found Gary...I woke something up that started to change me.

Because one day when I was at school. My heart suddenly started beating erratically. And a weird taste overcame my mouth. I don't know how to explain it. And even my classmates who had grown used to my peculiarities, felt that I was acting out of character.

Because for the first time in my life, I approached a stranger, and introduced myself.

Me, who was never ready to smile. Or even liked hugs. Who turns off her phone after getting home. Whose birthday no one knows to forget.

Made a new friend.

Melody was as surprised as I was when I approached her. She was bright and cheery. And looked like summer. I pretended to be Halloween.

But she was ever gracious enough to give me a smile. One that made me realize that boys liked her.

And so we started talking. Hung out even. Told each other things. All sorts of things. Secrets. But I never told her about my dreams.

It was through our talks that I learned the day that I approached her, she was having a tough time. Her brother went missing on that day several years ago. Her parents had given up hope. But Melody believed that he was still out there. And that she would find him.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

A year of friendship passes, and on our anniversary, I go looking for Melody to celebrate. But when I finally found her behind the bleachers, she was crying.

I didn't know what to do. And so I kissed her.

Melody was still crying softly when she told me that she didn't like girls. I told her that I didn't either.

She kisses me back.

And we do that for awhile until her tears stop.

When she was ready to talk, I waited and listened. She talked about her family, her mom and dad being distant. About school. What scared her. She talked about her brother and even asked if I'd go with her to visit the empty plot her parent's bought for him.

"Of course!"

And then she showed me a picture of him.

My stomach slammed into my pelvis. My heart started beating irregularly. I could suddenly taste an overwhelming flavor of salt in my mouth, before I blacked out.

When I woke up. I was laying flat on the grass. Melody was crying over me. Afraid to leave me by myself. So she stayed by my side and kept yelling for help until her throat was hoarse.

When I opened my eyes. She coughed and hugged me so tightly that I thought I would pass out again.

That day, we didn't go to her brother's grave. Instead Melody insisted on taking me home. Watching me sleep from the foot of my bed.

That was the day when I had the worst dream of my life.

&#x200B;

It was a dark house. The air conditioner quit years ago. So the place was musty. The wood permeated the rot straight into my nose as the boards swelled with mold underneath my footing.

All of the curtains were drawn shut. All of the blinds too. Except for the two panel slits I stared out of. I happened to be doing the same thing I did every day from 3:10 to about 3:15. Waiting for the bus to stop across the street.

I recognized the house on the other side. It was white with yellow trim. Marigolds lined the garden under the window. These were my neighbors. And I liked watching them. Their lives. Their kids. Coming home.

The bus pulled up. Right in the window. I could hear the brakes squealing as it came to a stop, as its doors opened.

Sometimes I had control of the body. This time I didn't. It's like living on rails. The eyes staring intently, pointing me towards two little kids getting off the bus. A little boy with an oversized backpack, and a younger Melody.

&#x200B;

I woke up screaming in real life.

&#x200B;

Melody was holding me. I could feel my skin wet against her body, but I couldn't stop crying as she rocked me.

When I finally calmed down. I told her everything. About my dreams. Gary. Her neighbor. All of it.

At first she didn't believe me. But as I kept going into detail. There seemed to be no mistaking it. And her eyes grew wide and then wider, until she couldn't help but cry too.

When I was finished. She only asked me one thing, "Why was he after my brother?"

I was afraid to tell her, but I was also tired of telling half truths. So I told her, "He wasn't. He was after you."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We didn't talk for a few days after. Not because she was avoiding me in the halls. But simply because she didn't come to school at all.

So that Saturday, when I was least expecting it. When she showed up at my front door. I couldn't help but hug her. And for a second, I was afraid that she was angry at me. But she hugged me back.

During our time apart, she found out that her neighbor had died shortly after her brother went missing. And the house had been abandoned. And that she had gone inside, desperate for any clues. But it was unusually empty. Except for a few pieces of dusty furniture.

It's why she wanted my help to find him. She wanted me to comb through the murderer's memories, the ones that still lingered with me. So that she could find her brother's body, so that she could have something to bury.

I couldn't say no. But I made her promise that she would stop going alone.

"So you know where the body is?"

I nodded.

The two of us broke into the old house that day.

It was weird being in a place that I had never been before. Yet, everything felt so familiar. Every crack in the wall, creaking door, down to the place where the man stood for hours by the window.

Together we moved a couch, and the rug that lay underneath. Exposing a trapdoor and a set of stairs that led into the basement.

I could feel my heart pounding in my chest as we descended those steps. A stench wafted through the opening, raking my eyes raw as we sunk deeper into the house.

The smell was so strong, that it hid the familiar taste of Gary's fingers in my mouth. It was during this time that my tongue began feeling unlike my own. My body too.

"They searched down here already," she told me.

"But they didn't know where to dig," I told her.

We came to a spot in the bare basement. It was plain, even and unassuming all over. She looked at me and I nodded.

We started digging.

It wasn't long until we saw what we had come for.

He was face down and so small. Hairs still clung to the bone white of his skull.

Melody threw her shovel down and started digging with her hands. Until she was able to hold her brother in her arms.

The taste of salt on my tongue was much stronger now. My throat felt dry as the basement seemed to grow darker than before.

"Melody..."

"Thank you," she told me.

"I don't...feel so good."

"I know."

"What," I asked groggily.

"I drugged you earlier."

I shook my head.

"See, I've been thinking for awhile. I even did some digging after you told me about how you could see things. How you could feel them. I came across many articles. Most of them duds. But as I kept searching, a picture slowly started revealing itself in my head. It started with a man who was shot in the face and needed a blood transfusion. He recovered, and suddenly became a virtuoso pianist. Another person got a steel pipe through their frontal lobe and became someone else entirely. A woman who was blind, received a pair of eyes, and could suddenly see ghosts.

She came closer. I could barely breathe.

"They say that the brain interprets everything we see. But it's really the heart that gives it power. If it beats faster...or slower. The brain functions differently. It can do more, or less. Essentially, that means the heart controls everything."

Her soft brown hair brushed gently against my skin, "Do you feel that?"

She was so close now that I could smell her. And deep down inside, something screamed at me to strangle her. To kill her. To wrap my hands around her throat. But I froze as her fingers began to unbutton my top.

"I found out that his organs were mostly destroyed by years of abuse and neglect. His liver." She slipped another button loose. "His lungs. Even his brain was good for nothing. But," her fingers revealed the scar on my chest. "They somehow managed to save the most rotten thing about him. They somehow managed to save the heart of a murderer."

I screamed as I saw a knife flash before my eyes. I felt it plunge between my ribs as my knees gave out.

"I'm sorry if it still hurts." Was the last thing I heard before everything went black.

&#x200B;

When I woke up. I was in the hospital.

I could still smell the anesthesia permeating from my body. There was a uniformed police officer standing outside of my door. And a doctor was waiting near my bedside, "You're awake."

"What happened?"

"Early yesterday, we received a call for two stabbings. The ambulance arrived just in time to save your life."

I shook my head, "You said two stabbings?"

He nodded, "You're lucky there was a viable donor."

I grabbed at my chest, and felt Melody's heart beating.
