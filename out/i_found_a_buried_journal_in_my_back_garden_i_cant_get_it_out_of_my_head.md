This has been keeping me up so i thought maybe if i just wrote about it here i would feel better.    
  
Atleast a month ago i was out in my backyard. We have a trampoline my little sister loves to use but well she isn't very little anymore and the trampoline is rusty, covered in dog shit and the netting is destroyed. We decided to just get rid of it. The way the trampoline worked is that it was on the ground and underneath the bouncing thing or whatever its called there was a hole. So you didn't break your ass when you jumped on it. Me and my dad removed all the poles and got most of the trampoline out. After like 7 hours we finally had it fully removed. But we weren't done yet. There was still a 4ft hole in the ground and we were not risking the dog falling down it and breaking a leg (or more likely ma falling down and breaking a leg) so we also had to fill it in. Luckily there was plenty of dirt for us to dig up and refill it with.    
  
My da at this point was exhausted and had work in the morning so it was my job to fill it in. So i got to work. I got into a good rhythm and i was almost halfway done when my shovel hit something. It wasn't dirt, it wasn't metal but something else. I took a look at what i had hit. It was some sort of dirt block? It was crawling with worms, those little beetle things woodlice i think, and just all sorts of insects. I dropped it instantly because i mean who wouldn't and it landed back down on the ground. The other side of it wasn't covered that badly and i could tell what it was now. It was a book.   
  
It was a grey, small little handbook. I was really confused about why it was there. At first i thought it was some sort of time capsule from when i was younger, or maybe from the previous owners. But i had no clue. I placed it on the tiled ground outside and got back to filling in.   
  
I finally finished refilling it and picked back up the book. Most of the bugs had vanished or where on the ground at this point. It was really dry and stiff. I went back inside and told my ma that the job was done and i was heading to bed. I brought the book up with me and placed it on my desk.    
  
The first few pages were readable but the rest were all stuck together and melted together. Couldnt open them without ripping the pages.   
  
Ill write down the best i can what was in those pages. If you want the actual images you can ask for them in the comments. Ill see what i can do.   
  
This is what i read (and can make out)   
  
   
  
Pg1. Stuck to the front of the book   
  
Pg2. The words “ITS SHOWTIME!” written across page 2 and 3   
  
Pg4. The word hurt with crude drawings of a girl with her guts outs and some figure with a knife and crossed out eyes.   
  
Pg5. Blank   
  
Pg6. Happy funny. All that's written.    
  
Pg7. A noose and a stick figure standing on a chair next to it.   
  
Pg8. HER scrawled on the top of the page. Another basic drawing of someone's face. Text underneath says “i hear her”   
  
Pg9. It almost reads like some sort of suicide note. “to my friemds. For most of you i was the funny guy, the happy guy. Bu----------- care for you. In my own way. Glenda, siobahn, killian, jake, aiden. I wont forget you. Please visit me.”   
  
Pg17. I was able to open this one because of a printed picture hanging out of the side of it. There are two pictures. One is of a hammer laying in my bathroom. With what looks like blood around it. The other picture is of a two bags. A big yellow bag and a small plastic one. There is obviously something in the plastic bag but i cant make out what it is.   
  
After that the pages are unable to be read. The most intelligible thing i got after that was near the end of the book.   
  
Pg? All i could make out is “want to be a dad. Normal. Youre a great guy. I loe u ante. Letters"   
  
   
  
I don't know what this is. Its fucking creepy as hell. Its seems like some sort of diary from someone. But I have no idea what they were going on about. The picture with the hammer confirms it was a previous owner who owned this book. Because that was literally my bathroom!   
  
I've talked to some of my friends and showed them it and we have two main ideas.   
  
Its the vent diary of someone who lived here before me who wrote down all their negative or intrusive thoughts in a diary and then buried it so no on could find it.   
  
Its some prank left behind by the previous owners. Like hiding a fake skeleton in your walls.   
  
   
  
Thats all. I just really needed to get this out of my head. If anyone has any ideas about what this might be all help is appreciated.
