If you had told me a year ago that I’d end up sprinting barefoot across town at 1 AM because of a Tinder date, I would’ve laughed in your face.

But here we are.

I’d just finalized my divorce when this all started. I was broke, tired, and living in a one-bedroom apartment with mold in the corners and carpet that crunched when you walked on it. I worked the graveyard shift at a 24-hour diner in Springhill. Most nights were just me, a mop, and the occasional drunk regular.

One night, during my lunch break, I downloaded Tinder. Bad idea #1.

Leo was one of the first people I matched with. Younger than me, red flag, but he seemed polished. His profile was like something out of a Rich Kid Starter Pack: photos in front of a private jet, fancy watches, button-down shirts in various cities. Normally, I would’ve swiped left. But something about the way he smiled in those photos made me pause. It didn’t feel smug. It felt... rehearsed, but warm. So I swiped right.

We chatted. Surface level stuff. His messages were awkward but polite. He was weirdly modest about all the wealth he seemed to have. Said he “just got lucky with a startup” and preferred “lowkey girls.” I wasn’t flattered, I was skeptical. But curiosity beat caution.

On our first date, he took me to an upscale Italian restaurant I couldn’t even afford to Google. He was perfectly dressed. Confident. Funny, even. He paid for everything without blinking. That should’ve been red flag #2. But after years of scraping by and being told I was “too much,” it felt nice to be treated like I mattered.

We kept going out. Each time, the date got more extravagant. A boat tour. A steakhouse that charges by the ounce. Once, he took me into a designer store and told me to “pick something.”

I didn’t. But still. Who does that?

Then came the Cancun trip. Flights. Hotel. All expenses. And that’s when I froze.

It felt… loaded like a setup. I told him I wasn’t comfortable. Said it was too soon.

That’s when the mask cracked.

He called me immediately. I picked up thinking we’d talk like adults.

Instead, I got screamed at.

He called me every name you can imagine. Manipulative. Ungrateful. A waste of time. Said I “led him on” and that I’d “pay” for playing him. It was like he became someone else entirely in ten seconds.

I blocked his number. Deleted Tinder. Tried to move on.

Then my door was open one night when I got home from work.

I always lock it. Always.

Nothing was stolen. Nothing looked touched.

Except for a piece of paper on my bed. Folded once.

On it, in all caps, was one sentence: **“YOU’RE DEAD.”**

That was it. No explanation. No name. Just Sharpie on printer paper. Like it had been waiting for me.

I ran. I don’t even remember grabbing my keys. I showed up barefoot at my best friend’s door.

We called the cops. Gave them everything: texts, voicemails, the note. Turns out Leo wasn’t rich. Not even close. Maxed-out cards, fake social media, rented cars. He was playing a long con. Building trust. Love-bombing. Then baiting me for something bigger.

I don’t know what that “something” was. And I’m glad I never found out.

But I moved. Changed my number. Nuked my socials. And I’ll never touch a dating app again.

Because some people aren’t looking for love.

They’re looking for prey.
