Ms. Robinson called Tommy out three times during class. He kept opening and closing his notebook, spinning his pen between his fingers, and giving me that grin that said *I’ve got a secret too good to keep*.

“I found a device that lets you hear God,” he told me at lunch, after he finished ranting about how all the teachers sucked.

“What do you mean?” I asked, confused.

He told me he’d been chatting to people on mysticism forums, and they mailed him this gadget, saying it was a direct line to God’s voice. The Creator Himself.

I figured it was just another one of Tommy’s weird obsessions. We were two awkward, chronically online kids, and he had a thing for conspiracy theories.

I laughed and told him he was losing it. That’s when he dug into his pocket and pulled out the 'thing'.

It looked like a flash drive with a cheap earbud attached. Almost like an old MP3 player I’d once found in my mom’s junk box.

“Mark, this will blow your mind,” he said, grinning. “Just put it in your ear for a while when you’re home. For some reason it doesn’t always work, but at night it usually kicks in.”

Then he shoved the device into my hand and told me to bring it back the next day.

That night I went to bed early, feeling like an idiot for even putting the thing in my ear. But it was still better than lying awake listening to my parents fight like they did every night.

I lay there waiting, pretty sure it was all a prank Tommy cooked up to laugh at me in the morning. The device was metal, no labels, no lights, nothing to even prove it was on.

It was only when I was almost asleep that I heard something. A strange static, like a weak radio signal. Like wind blowing into a mic.

That lasted a few minutes, then a low voice started to come through.

It was calm, almost androgynous, barely loud enough to hear. A few lines stood out clear:

*You are my child.*  
*And one day we’ll be together again.*  
*Let my voice guide your way to the light.*

The same lines repeated a few times, and then silence.

The next day Tommy was just as restless in class and got just as many warnings from the teacher. This time because he couldn’t wait to hear what I thought.

At break I told him I heard it, though I still thought it was nothing special.

He swore it was. Said every night these words were different, new teachings or whatever. He told me his first time had been like mine, but that the voice was saying new things now. He was a few sessions ahead of me.

I asked what it said, and he shook his head. I’d have to hear it myself.

So we made a deal about the device: one night with him, one night with me.

And sure enough, the messages shifted. Still in that same pleasant, almost hypnotic tone, but the short phrases turned to themes of love, perseverance, and self-acceptance. We started calling them “the lessons,” and they rarely lasted more than fifteen minutes.

For both of us it turned out to be a pleasant escape. For me, from the endless fights between my parents and their neglect. For Tommy, from the fact that it was clear he was going to fail the year. His grades were a disaster, and he clashed with teachers constantly.

We spent whole classes daydreaming about the voice, and every break trading theories. The truth is, over time we started to believe it could actually be God.

That voice just had this pull and calm that you can’t really explain to anyone who hasn’t heard it. I could listen to it for fours.

But all that was before it turned... let’s say, *aggressive*.

\*\*\*

One day Tommy showed up at school with this serious look. He sat through class quiet and still, which was totally unlike him.

At break he told me he’d left the device at home and would give it to me the next day. I asked why he seemed so weird.

“He said my name,” he expaid, staring at nothing like he was in a trance. “The voice said my name and said I was special. That I was a blessing against the unjust.”

Tommy was still a few lessons ahead of me in what the voice taught, but it had already started talking to me about what it called the 'unjust'. In my last session, it said: 

*To the unjust there remains only the blessing of the light.* 

*The good must not merely walk away from them but face them.*

It sounded abstract, and I still had no idea what it meant.

“We were chosen,” Tommy finally said, grabbing my shoulders. "He's giving us a path to him." 

He didn’t come to school the next day, or for the rest of that week. I called, texted, nothing. I wondered how many lessons he had gotten through by then.

I didn’t hear from him until the following Monday morning. I was half asleep from another night of my parents yelling at each other. When I opened the front door there was a brown paper bag on the porch.

Inside it was the device and a scrap of paper with a handwritten note.

*"hey mark*   
*please don't come to school today*   
*trust me please and remember we were chosen. tommy"*

I didn’t get it, and tried calling Tommy again with no answer. Still, I felt I could not ignore his warning. 

I tucked the thing in my pocket and walked to a local park so my parents wouldn’t know I was skipping class, not that they would care much.

\*\*\*

It's been two months since the horrible things Tommy did that day.

That morning he came to school very early, while the teachers were drinking coffee and preparing for classes. 

Armed with his dad’s handgun, he opened fire, killing four of them. He emptied an entire magazine into Ms. Robinson.

Then Tommy ended his own life. 

The cops, the news, and the whole town still haven't figured out why. People guessed mental health, bullying, politics, all that stuff. The truth is something I keep to myself: I know it was the voice.

I haven't shown anyone his note.

And I still have it with me. The device. 

Although I didn’t have the courage to use it for a few weeks, I actually missed the peace it gave me. I only tried it again last night. 

But the voice I heard from it wasn't the one I was used to. It was another one. *Tommy's voice*.

What he said must have lasted a little over a minute, but I'm sure it was him, because he called my name.

*Mark, we were chosen.*

*The unjust were brought to the light by my hand.*

*And you must come meet me too.*

Before he finished I ripped the device from my ear and threw it across the room, decided I was hallucinating.

After a few seconds, I regretted it and went to get it. Could it really be my friend?

I slowly put the device on again, and soon the voice returned. Not Tommy's. The other one.

And his last "lesson" still haunts me, because I know what it wants from me, and I'm afraid that if I keep listening to it, I'll believe him. 

\*\*\*

*You are a blessed being, Mark.*

*Born and raised to be light.*

*Your father and mother fell to the path of the unjust.*

*And it's your duty to do the right thing for them, just like your brother Thomas did.*

*You are special.*

*Bring them to the light.*
