You know how people say that social media is harmless? I used to think the same thing—until I made an Instagram account for my cat, Mr. Whiskers. I thought it’d be cute. Now I’m not so sure if that’s him anymore.



It started innocently enough, around 2 AM one night. I couldn’t sleep, and my cat, Mr. Whiskers, was curled up on the couch in a way that made him look almost regal. I thought, Why not? I snapped a photo of him, gave him a cute caption, and created a brand-new Instagram account for him. It was a joke, really. Just something to pass the time. I wasn’t expecting anything serious.



But then, the following began to grow—fast. At first, it was just a few people, mostly friends, liking his photos. But by the next day, I saw something... strange. Accounts with eerie names—like u/thewhisperinggaze and u/eyesintheshadows—started following Mr. Whiskers. Their posts weren’t about cats. They weren’t about anything normal. They were dark, unsettling, cryptic.



One of them sent me a message, a simple text: "You’ve found him. He’s waiting." I thought it was some weird joke. But the picture they posted was of Mr. Whiskers, the same one I had taken, but his eyes—his eyes were different. They weren’t just glowing—they were reflecting something, something… behind him. I couldn’t make out what it was. It looked like a shadow, but I couldn’t place it.



I deleted the account. But it didn’t stop.



Every night at exactly 3:33 AM, the same account would message me. The messages were always cryptic: "You shouldn’t have started this." "We’ve been waiting for him." "Come closer." I blocked them, but they always returned with new accounts, new usernames. It didn’t matter how many times I blocked them; the messages kept coming, until I couldn’t even open the app without feeling like something was lurking on the other side.



And then, Mr. Whiskers started acting... strange.



He would stare at the walls for hours, unblinking, his pupils wide and dilated. It got worse every day. I’d wake up in the middle of the night to find him standing at the foot of my bed, his eyes locked on mine. But it wasn’t just a cat’s gaze—it was like he was waiting for something. Something I wasn’t supposed to see.



One night, I woke up to a faint sound—whispering. Low, guttural whispers. It was coming from the corner of my room, near the window. I tried to turn on the light, but when I did, the whispering stopped. Mr. Whiskers was sitting there, facing the wall, unmoving. And the worst part? His reflection in the window—there was something standing behind him. It wasn’t the normal reflection. It was wrong. The shape was too tall, too thin, like it was stretching.



I thought I was losing my mind. But the next day, I received another photo. It was of Mr. Whiskers again, but this time, he wasn’t alone. Standing behind him, clear as day, was a tall, shadowy figure—its face obscured, its long, skeletal hand reaching out toward my cat. The caption simply said, “It’s time.”



That’s when I realized: Mr. Whiskers wasn’t my cat anymore.



I deleted the account, wiped it completely. I thought that would end it. But the next night, I woke up to a new message on my phone. It wasn’t from Instagram. It was a text message, from an unknown number.



“He’s coming. It’s too late.”



And when I looked at Mr. Whiskers, sitting at the edge of my bed, staring at the doorway, I saw something I can’t unsee. His eyes—those eyes—were no longer his. They were black, hollow, and they weren’t looking at me. They were looking at something in the hallway, something that was just out of sight.



Now, every night, I hear scratching at the door. Low, persistent. Like something trying to get in. And when I check, I see nothing.



But sometimes... sometimes, I swear I feel it. Something standing in the dark, waiting.



Waiting for me.
