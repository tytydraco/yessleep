We moved from Cape Town to a farm about 3 hours away, in the middle of no where four years ago. I didn’t want to go, I didn't want to leave behind the familiar things, my friends, the shops, I knew the area like the back of my hand

City noise had been my shield. Out here, the quiet isn’t quiet. It waits. Watches. Feels you.

The closest neighbors are a 25‑minute walk away. At night, it’s pitch black without a moon. The wind slams against the house like fists. My room is tiny—2 by 3 meters—with my bed pointing north and a window on my left facing east. The house is single-story, tiled floors, some loose tiles that click sharply when stepped on. The wraparound porch on the north and east sides amplifies every sound, making the house feel hollow and fragile.

We have a piano in the living room. I play almost every day. Its sound has always been mine, a lifeline of normalcy in this endless quiet, it's the one thing that is truly mine.

About a month ago, it began.

It was just past midnight. Olaf, my beagle, jolted upright, hackles raised, teeth bared slightly. He stared at the window and refused to move.

Gravel crunched outside. Slow, heavy, deliberate. Footsteps circled the house and stopped beneath my window. Something dragged along the brickwork, long, deliberate, impossibly thin.

The air turned thick, sticky, as if the night itself pressed against my skin. I could feel my heartbeat in my throat. Olaf whimpered, low, terrified.

In the morning, the tracks were in the dirt: long, split impressions, far too deep for any local animal.

A couple days ago, it returned.

My dad had flown out for work. My mom and sister had left me alone for a few nights while they went to drop him off at the airport. They usually go for a few days, to run errands, or visit friends and family. The rifle my dad leaves for me while I'm alone on the farm was by my bed, an old mauser .22lr. I could hear my own heartbeat in the silence.

Just past midnight, the wind changed. Tiles clicked, one by one, along the porch. Olaf growled—a deep, warning growl I’d never heard. The steps weren’t wandering. They were coming straight at my window.

One tile clicked. Another. Another. Each sound echoed like a hammer in my chest. My legs felt numb. My throat dry.

The footsteps stopped outside my window. The glass bowed inward, yielding under some invisible pressure.

Then it whispered—not out loud, but inside my mind:

“…Deee…on…”

My name.

I grabbed the .22 Mauser rifle leaning against the wall. Its weight was solid and familiar, but it offered no real protection. My hands shook as I aimed at the window. I didn’t fire.

Then, I felt something, touch me. It was cold, ice cold.

I fired the rifle. The shot shattered the silence, ringing in my ears. The glass didn’t even shake. My hands shook uncontrollably for hours. By morning, the tracks circled the house again.

It wasn’t wandering.
It was learning.
It was patient.

Tonight, it escalated.

I went to the bathroom just past midnight. The house was too quiet—the kind of quiet that presses against your skin. Even breathing sounded loud. When I returned, Olaf was rigid on the bed, staring down the hallway, ears pinned, eyes wide.

Then I heard it. Gravel. Footsteps. On the north side of the house. The front door.

The steps stopped.
The handle pressed down.
Slowly. Carefully. Testing the lock.

Silence followed. The air smelled faintly of wet earth and something metallic—like iron blood.

Then, from the living room, the piano played a single low key. Then another. Then another. Soft, deliberate. It knew the sound. My sound.

Then every key slammed at once. Eighty-eight notes. Violent, discordant. Shaking dust from the ceiling. Vibrating the tiles under my feet. My ears rang. My chest felt like it would collapse. Shadows danced across the walls, elongated and twisted where no light existed.

Footsteps again. Inside the house. Following the exact path I had just taken—from the bathroom to my room—like it was tracing my every movement.

The hallway light flickered. Then went out.

Click. Click. Click. Closer. Closer.

Silence outside my bedroom door. Only one thin slab of wood between me and it.

Olaf dove under the bed, trembling. I gripped the .22 Mauser rifle with both hands. Knuckles white. Breath shallow. The shadows in the hallway seemed to move on their own, reaching toward me.

Then the doorknob began to turn. Slowly. Softly. Steadily. Testing the lock. Learning it.

My room felt like a prison cell, I'm locked inside and it feels like I've got no real options left.

Metal clicked. The knob twisted. Stopped. Then twisted again.

A breath exhaled on the other side—long. Patient. Malicious.

Then the whisper came, right against the wood:

“…open…”

The lock clicked once. Then again.

Then—

The doorknob turned further.

It was trying to come in.

And I had nowhere to run...
