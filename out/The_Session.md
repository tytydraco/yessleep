I’ve been modeling for three years, mostly small gigs, bridal catalogues, fitness brands, a few beauty campaigns. Nothing glamorous.
So when I got an email from a photographer named Victor Hale, my heart raced. Looking through his portfolio, it was incredible: moody, cinematic shots, the kind that end up on magazine covers.

He said he’d seen my work online and thought I had *“a face that could tell a story.”*
I didn’t even care that the job was unpaid. Exposure like this could open doors.

The studio was on the edge of the city, in a converted warehouse. It was almost empty when I arrived, just Victor and an assistant who barely looked up from her phone.
Victor himself was charismatic, all warmth and compliments.
“You’re even more striking in person,” he said, adjusting his vintage camera. “I want tonight’s shoot to feel… raw. Honest.”

His voice was smooth, almost hypnotic. My nerves melted a little. Maybe this was finally my big break.

The first hour went fine. He asked me to pose barefoot against a stark white backdrop, then in front of a cracked brick wall.
But gradually, his directions grew strange.
“Hold your breath,” he murmured. “Imagine you’ve just seen something terrible.”
“Good. Now imagine you *are* something terrible.”

He circled me as I posed, sometimes so close I could smell his aftershave, sharp and chemical.
“Perfect,” he whispered. “You don’t even know how beautiful fear looks on you.”

My stomach fluttered uneasily. Fear wasn’t what I’d signed up for.

Around 9 p.m., I asked for a break. Victor nodded, but when I tried to step outside, the door wouldn’t budge.
“Oh, that sticks sometimes,” he said casually. “Don’t worry. We’re almost done.”

Almost done didn’t come quickly enough.
He asked me to change into a flowing white dress, almost like a nightgown. While I changed behind a screen, I realized the assistant was gone.
“Where’d she go?” I asked, trying to keep my voice steady.
Victor didn’t look up from his camera.
“Didn’t need her anymore,” he said. “It’s just us now.”

Something in his tone made my skin crawl.

After the next round of photos, Victor disappeared into a back room to “develop some test shots.”
I took the opportunity to search for another exit.
That’s when I saw a cracked door partially open at the end of the hall. Inside was a small room—its walls completely covered in photographs.

My breath caught.
Every photo was of **me**.

Not from tonight though, they went back weeks: me walking to the train, me leaving my apartment, me at the grocery store.
In some, I was asleep.

On a nearby table sat an envelope labeled with today’s date. Inside were a few staged shots from tonight’s session, but in each one, my eyes were closed, my skin eerily pale.
I looked..… dead.

I stumbled backward, knocking over a stack of prints.
Victor appeared in the doorway, his expression unreadable.
“You weren’t supposed to see those yet,” he said calmly. “It ruins the narrative.”
My voice shook. “What the hell is this?”
He stepped closer, camera in hand.
“My art is about truth,” he said softly. “And the truth is… people only notice beauty when it’s gone.”

He raised the camera.
“Hold still.”

---

I didn’t. I bolted, shoving past him. My bare feet slapped against the concrete floor as I sprinted for the main door.
Behind me, Victor’s voice stayed maddeningly calm.
“You’ll ruin the ending,” he called. “But that’s okay. I’ll fix it in post.”

I reached the door, yanking desperately. It gave way this time, and I burst into the cold night air.

I didn’t stop running until I found a busy street. People stared, but I didn’t care. I flagged down a cab, shaking and crying, babbling about the creepy photos, the locked door, the assistant who vanished.

I called the police and they searched the warehouse later that night.
No photos.
No Victor Hale - just an empty building filled with dust.

They told me there was no record of a photographer by that name.

But last week, a package arrived at my apartment. Inside was a single photo of me, taken through my bedroom window.

My eyes were closed.
My skin looked deathly pale.
And written on the back, in elegant handwriting, were four chilling words:
*“Final edit almost complete.”*
