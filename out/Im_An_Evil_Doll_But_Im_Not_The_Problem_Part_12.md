Want me to start off by talking about what it’s like to be in a siege? I don’t need to, it’s exactly what you’d expect. 

Sorry, things are getting a bit tense here these past few weeks. It’s why I haven’t been able to get back to you guys in so long. Just surviving  has turned into a full time job. 

Sveta, Leo and JP tried calling the Bishop’s bluff. Walking out like everything was normal. There wasn’t any landmines, or invisible assassins, but everywhere they went they saw them, agents of the bishop. Once these career cultists figured out my friend’s patterns, things got difficult. 

If they shopped at a store, some clerk would wind up hurt the next day. If they took the same street more than once, sure enough a rogue roofing nail would find it’s way into their tire. 

The Bishop and his goons found ways of making sure we knew the consequences of trying to ignore him. He set the rules for the game he wanted to play, and had no problems letting us know it was rigged in his favor. 

And that’s what things felt like at first. A sadistic game, the Bishop wanted to see what we were capable of, test us. 

Me, I don’t need to eat. Neither does Hyve and Kaz doesn’t have to worry about food any time soon. 

JP has a decent amount of supplies stored, but split between three people, it’s not going to last. 

“Fuck!” JP exclaims. 

“What is it now?” Leo says, annoyed. 

“Not now, Jesus Christ. Since the start of this shit. 

I’ve been wondering how they’ve managed to keep such a low profile. I mean there must be a dozen cars on the street. 

They’ve tapped into my network, using my own god-damned hard work against me. “ JP says, hitting his fist against a red oak table. 

“Easy” Sveta says. 

“ And in English if possible.” Kaz adds. 

JP sighs before starting. 

“They don’t need any kind of finesse. Just someone void-touched enough they can burn themselves out overclocking my wards. 

With the kind of network the Bishop is involved in, they will never run out of fodder. The bastards are just going to keep bringing people in until they could have a parade without anyone so much as glancing in their direction. 

And the only solution is to take down my wards. “

“At which point they just fuck off and make a call to the cops. Half of us get arrested, and half of us wind up in some government blacksite. “ Leo finishes. 

“That’s about it.” JP confirms. 

“Any ideas from your end of things?” Sveta asks Hyve. 

“Good lady, I would leave this situation and retrieve my companion in a second if I could. No offense intended. “ Hyve responds. 

“Fuck your companion.” Leo challenges. 

“Easy!” Kaz says, ready to step between the two. 

“That was not Flapp on the phone. It’s the Bishop or one of his minions playing us against each other. “ Hyve asserts. 

“You know what’s worse than a demon? Sorry, *malignant* . 

One who thinks he’s some kind of nice guy. That’s the stupid bastard that gets everyone killed. “ Leo stares the small toy-like malignant down. 

“How nice do you think I feel right now?

Trapped in a hovel with a slayer, his minion, and the minion’s mate.
I can forgive you for forgetting what you’re talking to, but remember who you’re talking to.“ Hyve says, the air around him taking on a sinister fog-like appearance. 

“I’m talking to a…” Leo begins. He’s cut off by a sharp whistle.  

“It’s enough that I have to smell all of the testosterone since the water stopped running, but I’ll be damned if I’m dealing with it. 

Leo, brooding every time we figure something out, isn’t helping. Keep that Batman shit in check. 

Sweetheart, I love you, but maybe instead of just screaming ‘Fuck’ , wait till you have an idea before mentioning the newest turd in the punchbowl. 

Hyve, I don’t know if your friend is with us or against us, but it’s not going to matter unless we get out of this. Next time you do that Dracula shit in my house though, you can walk right out that front door. “ Sveta states with no room for argument.

She puts the situation into perspective, for the moment at least. 

“I’m taking a piss. “ Leo says sullenly, walking upstairs. 

“The toilet doesn’t flush. “ JP replies. 

“I know.” Is Leo’s answer. 

“We’re going to have to start using the chemical toilet sooner or later. “ JP says, more to himself than the Hero. 

“Punch, how comfortable are you with trying to get out of here? I think out of all of us, you’re the best suited to it. “ Sveta asks. 

“I could maybe get some food, or whatnot, not that I can carry much. But I don’t know how good I’m going to be with getting help. 

I’m still controlled by my creator’s plan.  Sneaking away some leftovers, doable. But I make myself known to the wrong person, either them or I are having a terrible night.” I offer. 

“Better than nothing. Kaz, you guys shapeshift a little, right?” Sveta inquires. 

“In my younger days I’d give a mimic a run for it’s money. But those were long ago. 

Still, given enough shadow, I think these old joints can pull a trick or two. “ Kaz replies. 

“Seems like we’re getting somewhere.” Hyve says, optimistically. 

“Son of a bitch!” Leo screams from upstairs. 

This is soon followed by pistol shots, and the Hero backing out of the bathroom. 

A half dozen, probing, insect-like appendages, colored a sick, deep purple whip and scrabble at the doorframe. 

  Leo empties the clip into the mass, from somewhere deep within the pipes there’s a high-pitched scream. The clawing, seeking limbs retreat. 

Leo pulls the door shut, and there’s a slight smell of ozone as a ward enacts. 

“Fuck. They’re starting with that shit already?

This place is made to be cordoned off, but I don’t like where things are heading. I was expecting this kind of breach in months, not weeks. “ JP laments. 


If I went through every day in detail, this would be hundreds of pages long. Now, if all that would be interesting, I’d be the first doll to let you in on things. But unfortunately war is long periods of boredom punctuated by brief moments of absolute horror. 

And as the days grind on, I realise, that’s what this is, a war. 

We fall into a routine. Checking the house for anything new and dangerous, cataloguing the growing number of Bishop’s agents, and for me, trying to top up our dwindling food supply. 

My end of things is getting difficult. The Bishop’s pawns seem to be figuring out ways to track me. Each time I leave, they learn more, get closer to finding me. 

But we ration, we close off rooms, and we drag out this war of attrition. 

 We’re down to three useable rooms in the house. The livingroom, the kitchen, and JP’s workshop in the basement. Everywhere else is infested with some kind of horror. 

Scuttling beetle like things whispering secrets no one wants to hear. A smell bad enough to cause nosebleeds. And a soft, almost childlike voice that kept trying to get one of us to enter the attic. Not the only new hazards we’ve had to cage in, but the more interesting ones anyway. 

The sentient mind can learn to deal with a lot, and as the days turned to weeks, the fiery clashes between us had burn down to smoldering anger. 

We sit in the living room going over a promising plan involving a friend of JP’s who has a predictable annual  route through the country. If we can hold out another ten days, he’ll be passing through. 

The television, useless since the power went out, suddenly turns on. The image is grainy, the sound warped, but we see the bishop, vile grin on his twisted face. 

I can’t really describe the place he’s standing in other than it looked like a house. Well kept, probably had kids, but other than that, could be any livingroom in any suburb in north America.  

“How’s it goin’ fellas? “ The evil old lich begins, “You seem to be a little down lately. Makes me think you’re getting bored. “

Leo goes red and looks like he’s going to spring to his feet. JP puts up a hand. 

“He can’t hear us. Don’t waste your energy. 

These bastards are in deep, but not that deep. “ JP assures the Hero. 

“So I’ve decided to play a little game with you. “ The bishop says, walking backwards from the camera, three figures enter the room. To say they looked familiar would be an understatement. 

It was Leo, Sveta and JP. Hell, one of them was even carrying a damn fine copy of myself. 

Obviously anyone with enough skill could create a non functional replica of myself (In fact, a couple of people have, awesome work guys!), but seeing the just off of perfect replicas of my friends is scary as hell.

“If you just want to sit in your hole, we’re going to take that out on your neighbours. “ the bishop starts as the three impostors fan out into the house, “ And to make things interesting, eventually I’ll let these tapes get out online. See how long you last with the law kicking down your door. 

I won’t make things unfair, I’ll stay out of the game, just you and my congregation. “

The bishop grins, walking out of the home amused with the situation he set up. Sounds of struggle and violence emanate from within the house. 

“I’ve got it.” I say, breaking the grim silence.

No one challenges me but I don’t see much confidence. 

“It’s a trap.” Leo says simply, collapsing into a couch. 

“Anyone else here able to be undetectable?” I ask sarcastically. 

“Undetectable is a pretty strong claim Punch. “ Sveta replies. 

“I know, but do we have any other options? They’ll see Kaz coming a mile a way, same with Leo, Hyve isn’t exactly at full strength, and no offense but JP and yourself are just human. “ My grim overview hits home. 

We try and ignore the situation, we knew things like this were going on, and it’s an obvious ploy to break the stalemate we’ve created. But with every hour the carnage done in the name of getting to us is displayed on another screen. 

“Want to know something interesting, punch?” Leo says after a sheet we tried to put over the livingroom television started to smolder. 

“Things are a little too interesting lately, Leo. “ I answer. 

“I’ll tell you anyway. A lot of folks think people like myself are affiliated with one religion or another. Some of us lean into it, but truth be told we’re just about the biggest examples possible of ‘ take what you want and leave the rest’.

At the end of the day though, what happens after you’ve really died is a mystery. 

That being said, with all the different perspectives, human, supernatural, and other, one thing seems universal. “ Leo leads. 

“Don’t, Leo. “ Kaz says, clearly knowing where this is going. 

“I’m not doing anything, I’m giving him information. 

Sacrifice is like poison to the worst things out there is all I’m saying. If all you’re going to be left with is a patched up mangled soul when then lights go out, you probably want to be an unappetising meal. “ Leo lets the statement hang. 

It's not like I don’t feel manipulated. I get what Leo is doing, but seeing as no one in our supernaturally inclined group is refuting him, it doesn’t seem like he’s lying either. 

I’ve said this before, but I want to do so again. I read the comments. I love to get a sense of what you guys are thinking, how you feel about me and what I do. 

From what I’ve seen you guys love when I win, and when I do the right thing, in that order. No judgement, you’re here for creepy things, and I’m a creepy thing. 

But unfortunately, while I made it to the door of the house the Bishop’s agents were in, I didn’t win, and while I tried, I wasn’t successful in doing the right thing. 

One thing I struggle with, writing these updates is to not make things come across as some kind of adventure. I don’t want any of you seeking out the kind of terror I have to deal with on a daily basis. 

We’re not superheroes, hell our “Hero” is a manipulative, self-centered, myopic  giant with short man-syndrome. We’re all just caught up in something beyond us. 

But right now, I’m not going to have to struggle. 

I didn’t slip in unnoticed and slay a trio of clones. I walked into a trap and paid the consequences. 

Catching someone off guard is what has saved us. Up until now, we’d been in grim situations, but ones where we were an unknown quantity. The element of surprise is a hell of an advantage. 

But the three simulacra saw me coming a mile away. They knew what they were dealing with.

I try and fight, but they’ve done this before. They understand how I move, they see beyond the protection of the eye. Whatever they are they aren’t that much stronger than a person, but each blow lands somewhere that destroys or disables me. Each one wielding shop tools like knife-fighters. 

The family screams from within the house, having endured their own torments in the name of the Bishop’s sick game. I try to use the shame of failing them, or the sick glee of their suffering to push forward, but it doesn’t work. 

I resign myself to going down fighting, hoping that if there is something waiting after I die it’ll see that I tried. 

But I don’t get that cold comfort. That possible light at the end of the tunnel, my deserved rest. 

As the trio bash and prod, saw and snap, I realise, they aren’t intending on killing me outright. 

They crack my metallic skull open, bending one razor sharp frond  to a 45 degree angle. 

The one mimicking JP swaps out his metalworkers hammer for a set of surgeons tools. 

I scream as much as I can, but his blades start to tear and flense. As this happens I feel something. 

Not the dull emulated pain of this stunted body, but real pain. What’s left of my body screaming at me that things are being destroyed. 

As the doppelganger does his vile work, I start to feel weak, my vision begins to blur. My consciousness begins to fade in and out. 

I’m picked up, held by one leg, casually. One of the doppelgangers slowly walks down the street me in tow. 

I see JP’s house. Him and Leo stand in the doorway. Leo wants to kill the thing holding me. 

When I come to next my friends are looking shocked,  standing above me. Having a serious conversation I can’t make out. 

It’s dark for a long time. I’m alone with my thoughts, a small pinpoint of consciousness in a place between unlife and death. 

They wounded me, hurt me to cause more problems and conflict. The Bishop knows that he could kill us all any time he wants to. He wants to break us. 

I see Leo’s face, he’s looking grim, my vision is distorted enough I can’t make out what’s going on, but I know they’ve opened my skull. 

“Are you sure about this?” JP asks Leo. 

“I’m sure it’ll work. “ Leo replies. 

He grabs the damaged, remaining flesh of my head. Broken plates of skull and jaw, barely attached to wires that skirt the line of flesh and steel. At first I think he’s just giving me the mercy the doppelgangers wouldn’t. And I don’t blame him, in fact, I’m relieved. 

Then, the metallic skullcase closes, I’m soaked, I hear Leo screaming, and I feel, hungry. 

If there was one bit of mercy I was shown, it’s that I don’t remember what I did with the hand. The answer is obvious, but not having a first person view was a blessing. 

When I wake up two days later, I’m patched up in a pretty haphazard manner. The damaged frond has been removed, my joints hitch and grind a bit, but at least I’m no longer near death. 

“Punch!” Kaz says, I notice he’s looking a bit thin. 

I hoped it was some kind of fever dream, but I see Leo’s hand, or lack thereof. The bandaging looks nearly professional, though the hero is clearly in pain. 

“Leo, I’d have thought you’d have done your Ash Williams thing by now. You know, the leg, the eye?” I say trying to break the tension. 

The room is silent. Everyone is happy to see I’m alive, but things are taking their toll. 

“You’d be right if I lost it. But I gave it away. “ Leo has no malice in his tone, I feel like shit anyway. 

The Bishop continues to give us a 24 hour stream of him and his congregation terrorizing those around us. Not everything is torture and death, they’d run out of houses pretty quickly if it was. But they manage keep the neighbourhood from sleeping in some way shape or form every minute of every day. 

And the worst part is that the bishop uses the wards to isolate, to pigeonhole. Each family thinks they are the only ones going through a horror film. Each too worried about seeming insane to take it beyond this soured suburb. 

The congregation has worked the wards enough they can stand outside their cars at night now. Dozens of human and just off of human forms, watching, waiting. 

Days pass slowly, the ever growing ring of increasingly bold cultists makes us all paranoid. And as of late, there is a strange, wet thumping noise coming from within the walls of the house. 

Food has ran down to scraps and a conversation about our next move between JP and Leo turns from lively, to spirited to an argument in a flash. The two men stand in the kitchen doorway, near the front hallway. 

“Holy shit, I lost my hand, I don’t remember you losing your balls though. 

We have to go shock and awe. Round up everything in here, pick a weak point in the line and push through. I’ll take my chances getting caught by the feds at this point. I’ve still got some connections. “ Leo yells. 

“For fuck sakes, it’s not a matter of balls. What we are doing is working. It’s why he’s trying so hard. Sooner or later we’re going to be more trouble than we’re worth, and he’ll give up. 

We fight, we lose. It’s a math situation, even if everyone out there is just some asshole with a .38, we’re dead. “ Is JP’s equally loud reply. 

This conversation goes on for a while and I start to get lost in my own thoughts. 

I start to think about how in a lot of ways, this is my fault. Or at least the scale of it is. 

If I wasn’t in the picture, maybe Leo would be dead, but it seems like that would have been the end of things. The bishop would do whatever he was going to do anyway.  

By trying to save Leo, I’ve just dragged JP, Kaz, Hyve, this neighbourhood and everyone else, into things. 

I didn’t make this situation, but it sure as hell seems like I made it worse. 

I see everyone focussed on the brewing one sided fistfight, and my self pity forces me to make a quick decision.

I sneak to the front door, unnoticed. My intent is to pick a direction and run. If worse comes to worst at least it’s only me who suffers. 

I open it just enough to get out, the volume of the argument masking the noise. 

Before I take my first step I notice something odd. A few splinters of wood ping off of my metal skull. 

I haven’t stepped foot outside the door when I notice the argument has gotten completely one sided. 

I turn and see JP, pale as a sheet, clutching his chest, blood oozes from between his fingers. 

The second shot, likely intended for Leo goes wild, putting a small hole in the plaster behind him. Free of the screaming of two grown men, I hear a faint crack in the distance. 

The third though, finds it’s mark. It strikes just below JP’s hands, severing a finger and blowing a piece from his heart. The Greysmith hits the wall, then the floor. 

Leo dives into the living room, screaming at everyone else to do the same. 

Shocked, I try to close the door. I feel like an idiot, this is such an obvious thing. 

“Keep it open.” Sveta says, staring out into the dark night. 

She sniffs , and looks into the distance  with a thousand yard stare. 

“Get the fuck down! Sniper!” Leo screams at her. 

She doesn’t do what he asks, even as a fourth shot tears a small furrow of flesh from the side of her head. 

Sveta begins to unbutton her shirt, slowly, without a hint of fear, shame or embarrassment.

“Get down woman! You will have plenty of time to grieve later!” Kaz yells, getting ready to run and grab her. 

The sniper fires a round at Sveta’s feet, clearly more interested in causing fear than death. 

In a few moments she stands naked. Disrobed, I see her body is covered tattoos and brands of all forms. Runes from Nordic to Hebrew and everything in between cover ever inch other than her hands and face. 

She walks into the gunfire, the small calibre weapon spraying her with shrapnel or grazing her. 

Large slashes, almost like rips begin to appear on her body as she starts to jog, then run. Flesh begins to fall like autumn leaves, thick, shining black fur taking it’s place. In the space of a few strides she stands in the front yard.

“Is that a…” Kaz begins. 

“It certainly fucking is, one of two left. “ Leo says, almost mystified. 

JP coughs spraying the front of his shirt with blood. He slaps the wall beside him to get our attention.  

We stand around him as wet cracking and tearing noises come from the front yard. 

“She needs to…” JP coughs more blood, a tremor running through his body, “Survive this.”

“I’ve got a duty to, and Willy Wonka here is probably related, so he has to.” Leo says with a smile that can’t reach his eyes, “But you’ll be able to see it yourself, do you know how many chest wounds I’ve seen folks pull through from?”

“You already used the Willy Wonka line.” JP says, laughing, then coughing, “ And no, I won’t. I can’t feel my legs, but I can feel the fact my heart has a piece missing. 

She’s been through too much to get killed by some pissing contest. Promise me, all of you. “

We do, but by the time we get to me, JP won the debate on his health. 

And this is where I’m going to leave things for the moment. Now, more than ever, I don’t know if there will be any more. The siege was one thing, but now, at a moments notice, it looks like we are going to have to go to war. 

Fuck I wish we had an army. 

Till next time, if there is one. 

Stay watchful. 

Punch.


I'm still around!
