Since i was a child i’ve never felt truly alone. i’ve always felt i was looking over my shoulder or straining my ears to make sure no one was there. when i was younger i didn’t think much of it but as i got older the feeling never went away. after i turned 13 it stopped being just a feeling. i would wake up in the middle of the night with little things out of place; my door or closet would be open, my covers would be thrown off, the TV would be on. i hadn’t considered the possibility of anything supernatural yet mainly because i had a lot of siblings and assumed they were messing with me. it wasn’t until i woke up with bruises on my legs i started getting weirded out.

Then one night i was laying in my bed on my side playing on my phone when the side i was laying on started burning. i ignored it at first but it started getting more intense to the point it was too painful to ignore. i got out of bed and went to the bathroom where i pulled up my shirt and saw three long scratch marks where the pain had been. they started on the side i had been laying on and stretched to my mid back. And look i understand how cliche this sounds, but i’m not one for dramatics. I told my dad about it and he insisted i did it to myself and i was playing a prank on him. after that nothing much happened for awhile. 

In the past i thought that this behavior could be linked to my house and when i found out i was moving to georgia i was expecting the weirdness to stay in Tennessee. Obviously i wouldn’t be writing this if i hadn’t been wrong. 

If anything it got worse once I moved, as if i had angered whatever this thing was. It escalated from little things to being dragged out of my bed, scratches and bruises all over my body, i could see feet standing at my door through the crack, i even woke up with a chunk of hair missing. But i think the nightmares were the worse. they were awful and they felt so real. I won’t get too graphic but they usually depicted me being tortured and assaulted. 

I never told anyone about it. my family wouldn’t believe me and if they did they’d probably send me to a nunnery. Whatever this thing is i think it’s attached to me. it whispers in my ears but i can never make out what it’s saying. it’s like hearing someone speak garbled english; you can almost grasp what they’re saying but in the end it’s complete gibberish.

I don’t know what to do or how to make it stop. it continues to become more aggressive every year i get older and i’m afraid it may seriously hurt me or worse. Or i’m just crazy which may be worse. i feel crazy. i’ve been to therapy and psychiatrist but nothing’s helped. i don’t know how to feel or how to live without paranoia. sorry there’s no real ending but i’m guessing that will be my death.
