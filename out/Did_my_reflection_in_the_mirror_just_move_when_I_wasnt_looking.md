It was just a normal morning really, got up and washed my face then came back and sat in front of my mirror to do my hair and makeup.
I had music playing while I did this, my favourite metal playlist.  
I looked into my makeup bag, out the corner of my eye I swear I saw my face staring back at me from the mirror... I shrugged it off, probably just my brain playing tricks on me. That was until, as I looked away again, I swear my reflection was staring at me with it's hands pressed against the glass... I quickly looked at the mirror and saw my normal reflection, nothing weird. I started to feel a little freaked out so I picked up my things and took them to the bathroom to use the mirror in there instead.

I turned off my music and carried on getting ready, that was when I heard what sounded like nails scratching a blackboard. It was earpiercing, horrible and it was coming from my bedroom. I froze, wondering what the hell it was. I walked back into my room slowly, I looked around from the doorway, nothing was there. I carried on scanning the room, I looked over at the mirror and all the hairs on the back of my neck stood on end... There, clear as day, was four scratch lines down the glass... 
"What the fuck" I said to myself, my hands getting clammy. I started to walk over to it, I was home alone so I grew more and more freaked out with each passing second. 
I stood Infront of the mirror and stared, my reflection just normally looking back at me. 
"I must be tired, this is stupid" I muttered to myself, shaking my head and walking out of the room. Just as I got to the door however,
KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK
Something knocked on the glass of the mirror...
I screamed and ran out of the room, not looking behind me. I picked up my makeup bag, threw everything back in and grabbed my phone. I was not going to spend the rest of the day in the house after that so I grabbed my handbag and left.
I stayed out of the house for the entire day after that, I did my makeup in my car in the car park of the local shops, went and ran some errands then met up with some friends for food and a few drinks.

As the day went on, i pretty much forgot about everything that happened that morning.
When I got home that evening, i made myself something to eat, watched a little TV then went up to bed. I stood in the bathroom washing my face and cleaning my teeth, just the calm sound of the water running. 
That was, until something crashed to the floor in my bedroom.... My stomach dropped, it was late at night and I was home alone, my phone was in the bedroom so I couldn't call for help if someone was in my house....

I turned off the tap and slowly opened the bathroom door just a crack to look. 
All my lights had gone off apart from the bathroom light. Every. Single. One.

I stood there, frozen in fear... 
"Hh Hello" I managed to squeak out
"hello" a voice whisperered back from the darkness...
I shreiked, slammed the bathroom door and locked it. What the fuck was I going to do? I had no phone to ring someone, i was trapped.
I sat in the bathroom windowsill, I pushed the window wide open and looked out. If I needed to jump out to get to safety, sure I'd get hurt but I should be okay...
That was when, the bathroom light clicked off behind me....
KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK....
I slowly turned, I looked at the mirror that I was not standing Infront of... I saw my reflection standing there... Staring at me in the dark...
I slumped down to the floor, covering my eyes like a scared child,
"You're not real!" I screamed.
Silence.
I moved my hands away from my face slowly...
It was now looking at me, hands pressed against the glass again, eyes wide and grinning at me.
