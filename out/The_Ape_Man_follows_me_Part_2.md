The sound of steel against the half full bowl of cereal was a grinding noise that whittled away at my already strained mental state. I had risen early with the intention of making something nice for Grace and I. Only for those intentions of being dashed almost immediately when I had descended the stairs to find Grace sitting at the dining room table with a cup of coffee in hand. Waiting for me to join her.

Without the motivation to cook something more for the both of us, grabbing the nearest prepackaged box became the only easy solution.

I had taken my seat at the other head of the table and started to dig into my food without any real enthusiasm or desire to finish the meal. Now I had taken to running the spoon along the edge of the bowl, the unpleasant scraping of ceramic on wet steel squeaking across the table with a sharpness that brought out a grimace from both of us every time I succeeded in hitting a high note.

“Please stop that.” Grace murmured, lifting her mug as she did so. “You know that sounds awful.” I nodded in agreement, pushing the spoon into the bowl before glancing up from the congealed milk and circular wet loops to look at Grace.

I can’t do her justice in describing her but I’ll still give it my best. She has a soft, narrow face with a peachy skin that perfectly accompanies her light steel blonde hair which is always done up in a bonytail save for a few perfectly placed lopsided locks that drift in waves over her cheeks. Her eyes are a sea green, almost a bright cyan blue that is quite striking and has always been one of my favourite things about her appearance.

She must have noticed me watching her and simply chosen not to respond. Taking a long sip of her drink before she rested it back in place on its coaster. Sticking out against the circular marks left by my inability to implement the tiny piece of wood.

“I saw your car.” She nodded behind me to the wreck of a vehicle that I had been able to navigate home. “Was it a bad crash?” She flicked the tip of her finger towards my face and my poor brutalised nose that had been battered all throughout the last night.

I did my best to give her a bemused smile that accompanied a shake of the head. It wasn’t bad. Just bad luck and poor observations that led to the thick plaster that I had placed across the bridge of my nose. She didn’t need to worry.

“No, thankfully the car still works alright, I’ll go get repairs in the city after work.”

“Do you need a ride home?” Her immediacy caught me off guard. It was uncharacteristic for her to be so willing to keep a conversation going. Offering a lift when my own car was broken was also something I hadn’t expected from her. But I didn’t feel that I could take her up on the offer. I didn’t want to be a burden more than I already had and I knew that she was only keeping me entertained out of pity for my nightmare and the bad blows to my face.

I wouldn’t force her to spend more time around me then she already had to bear. Imposing my own presence on her wouldn’t do any good. Although a small inkling inside my brain fought against these notions. What if she genuinely wanted to spend time with me? What if my odd behaviour from the last night had been able to catch more than just pity?

Doubtful.

Finally in response to her offer I shook my head again.

“Thank you, but I'll be good, I can rent a car or get a taxi.” Grace nodded politely as I rejected her offer. The corners of her eyes screwed up with a pained yet careful restraint, a pang of guilt twitched in my chest and I knew I’d made a mistake.

I stood up abruptly from my seat and started to wander back out towards my wrecked car, words falling in mumbling trails from my lips as I tried to string together an apology or half measure that I could offer.

“I have to go, can we talk later?” I was speaking too quickly and we both knew it as she bobbed her head and was already making her way out of her seat.

“Sure,” Grace’s words left in an exhale as she pried her cup off the table and turned back to the sink.

I was already out the door, walking at a brisk pace as I tried to outrun the embarrassment of my poor choices. I didn’t need to think about that or what I could have said differently, today was one that I needed to focus on, I had work. Then I could focus on fixing things after work. I’d apologise to Grace, I’d apologise for everything and really set things right.

My thoughts were temporarily halted as a strange lingering notion sat in the air around me. I was standing in the same spot that I had seen occupied by the strange man the previous night. In my haze of half sleep as he watched me from behind the edges of my desecrated car.

Tasting a drink of air on my tongue a sudden bitter chill washed its way down my throat causing me to gag. Of all the thoughts I needed to push down, that was especially one that needed to stay back. Fictitious weavings of my delirious mind appearing around me were unneeded and unwanted.

But even so I still considered how I stood in the same place he had. Watching through that large window to the occupants of the household that lay within its interior. Treading over familiar surfaces and shielded by the walls of the house’s thick armour. Now I could only see Grace living inside the home.

I coughed as I felt a warm wet sensation settle upon the back of my neck and I wrenched my eyes away from where she stood, cleaning her mug with the cold water that ran over her hands.

I felt a peculiar kind of disgust with myself as I limply lifted one of my hands to the car's handle and my eyes caught a strange set of markings towards the car’s crumpled hood.

I couldn’t tell if the markings had been there the previous night and were simply part of the wreck that had occurred after I had collided with the young moose. Four deep scratches that all ran parallel to each other towards the right headlight.

I was seeing things, it was part of the wreck and being paranoid wasn’t going to make my life easier. I didn’t need to invent hardships. Come on mark, this is ridiculous. 

Without a second thought I sat down in the driver's seat and made my way along the winding road towards Vancouver. Eclipsing the mileage of trees that encroached on the highway and fixing my gaze on the painted white strips along the concrete path. Occasionally letting my eyes wander to those four perfect scratches.

…

“So Mark, thoughts?” The chipper voice of my coworker, Charles, curiously crawled along the lobes of my ears as I watched, aghast and horrified by the racks of metal cages that lay behind thick panes of glass. Separating the pair of us from the subjects-to-be as they cried and bayed from within their tiny confinements.

Behind that glass pane were nine fully grown, male chimpanzees. All of which were hairless and actively antagonising each other through the bars of their cages.

I wasn’t even sure what to say. I felt stuck to the spot as I observed the chimps hollering cries, the rest of the bustle and footfall in the hallway behind us fading into a fuzzy blur that only served to be additional white noise. I could feel my mouth hanging open with shock as I turned slowly to stare directly at my colleague.

Charles was only slightly younger than I was, but that was still pushing it, he had a naive face with a toothy smile and a stubby nose. Curly red brown locks floating over his cheeks and adding to his own youthful expression. In the moment I wanted nothing more than to slap him and turn that rosy face into a deep black blue. How could he look that… content, with such a deeply confronting sight before us?

“What on earth am I looking at?” I tried to demand in a way that was forceful but still respectful of him as my equal.

His eyes shifted in slight confusion as his mouth screwed up in a strangely exaggerated confusion before he opened his mouth ever so slightly to reply.

“The… subjects? The ones were testing the new batch on?” His voice was full of a condescending matter of factness that only made it harder to hold my tone in line and prevent myself from snapping at him.

“Yeah, no, I got that, I meant since when are we using chimps?” He only replied with a vacant stare, unresponsive to my previous question.

“Charles, how the hell are we even using chimps? How did they get here? How did nothing cross my desk? Who wrote off on this?” Question after question I continued to lambast his dismissal of the chimps being so nonchalant.

“Doesn’t it make sense?” A reply that only confused me further as I failed to grasp his meaning.

“The meds are meant for human illnesses, the brain structure of chimps is closer to humans than any of the rodents. I thought someone just figured the same and was able to pull a few strings.” I wasn’t even sure how true that was. It made sense logically to assume the chimps may far better then the tiny lab rats that had been standard issue for animal testing. Although the use of apes made things… difficult. What if someone found out? They’d be hell to pay for sure.

But more than that I found it deeply unnerving to be conducting experiments on a creature not that far off from humans.

Have any of you seen a chimp? In person and shaved bare? Its almost uncanny how close to the human body their own anatomy resembles. Short and stout masses of muscle sinew and greyed skin with an outer layer that was worn with the hardships of life. Faces with overlong ears pushed too far back along their scap and mouths of twisted canines that peeled back behind large lips. Among their menacing and uncanny attributes I found their eyes to be deeply unnerving.

Shining pupils that hinted at a level of intelligence that was easy to underestimate. Constantly flickering and turning to examine the room and especially the unaware human captors.

“Mark, come on, let’s get this over with.” Charles lowered his gaze to the locker that sat beside the sliding door and was already loading a gun with a tranquilliser.

Necessary safety procedures I supposed, especially regarding the size of the experiment's participants.

Charles led the way into the room as I followed reaching into the same locker to retrieve a pair of syringes containing the new experimental drugs that with any luck would have been a major breakthrough in our research and a huge step forward in its respective field.

Now, the two of us were standing inside the room with the apes behind their cages. I heard a mechanical crunching noise of the locks being initiated on the door and knew that someone from the observation room was coordinating with our own actions. The observation room was behind a large one way mirror that blended in seamlessly with the rest of the walls.

Even in the moment it felt strange to lock the door behind us. Safety precautions and all but was it really necessary to keep the pair of us contained with the chimps?

Charles was beginning to approach the chimp to the far side of the room in the lower left corner of the grid and trying to prod the end of his gun through the bars so that he could sedate the ape without missing. A task made more difficult than it was needed to due to the apes own efforts of pushing the barrel out of its cage before quickly darting back to the end of the container and coiling up into a ball. Repeating the erratic movements out of panic and fear.

“Damnit, stay still.” Charles huffed to himself as he continued to fiddle with the gun while I stood to the side holding the syringes like a pleb, waiting for him to sedate the chimp and growing increasingly irritated by how he handled the tool.

“Charles, let me…” I was about to butt in before he shoved the barrel of the tranq gun deep into the cage, prodding the chimp in its side and enraging the already paranoid animal.

It lashed out, grabbing the metal barrel and yanking it with such force that Charles fell forward and smashed his nose against the shelf above the chimp. A crack of cartilage barely audible above the chimps shouts as his nose twisted to its side.

Without thinking I rushed to his side as I simultaneously dropped the syringes I held, letting them clatter against the ground. My fingers scraped along his lab coat and then felt the muscles in his whole body seize up and a scream of pain rang out.

I wasn’t initially sure what happened as my eyes were still locked onto the tranq gun that the chimp at his waist was clutching and his face was pressed into the cage before him. My eyes took their time to reach the point where his neck ended and chin began. The point where another chimp had been able to press it’s fingers around the bar and beneath the tender skin that graced that cold metal.

The chimp was holding Charles’ face to the cage and gripping onto the bars at the same time. Hot blood gushing from his neck and tainting his brilliant white lab coat with dark ugly blotches. Charles had no clue how to react, his arms shooting off in all directions with every slight curling of the chimps fingers in his throat as he made an odd gurgling noise in place of a scream and his eyes had shrunk into themselves.

I wasn’t fairing much better. I was still helplessly clutching his sides, gently trying to pull him away from the chimp and failing at this bout of strength I was glancing back at the invisible mirror to my left. Screaming desperate pleas at whoever was meant to be observing our actions.

“Get help! We need help!”

By then the world turned upside down as I felt myself fall back under the weight of Charles’ as a pair of noises fell upon our ears.

The first and loudest of the two was a bending of metal and breaking of steel as the gun was leveraged against the metal bars to pry the front of its cage away. 

The second noise was one that even now is still ringing in my ears. A strange slick, wet sound that I can only describe as a stack of paper being ripped through all at once. Tearing of a thin piece of parchment away from a larger whole.

I knew what had happened and I was dreading when I would need to open my eyes and bear witness to the grizzly sight that lay around me. Feeling the weight of a limp, shivering body on top of me, accompanied with a dripping of warm liquid onto my chest that was living a gradually blossoming wet mark that burrowed deeper into my heart.

I could still feel Charles’ heart beating and in a second I was grateful that he was still alive and had simply fallen unconscious from the act I couldn’t bear to see.

I started to sit up. Keeping my eyes barred shut as I pulled myself back so that I could begin to gather my bearings. Eyes starting to flit open to scan the whole scene.

Only then noticing that the cries and choir of the pained subjects had fallen totally silent. My eyes darted up and fluttered across the whole array of nine cages in swift frantic motions. All of them were watching me from where I sat with an expressionless intelligent stare.

Their eyes deep and aware of the scene that lay before them as they held their hands over their knees and kept their mouths concealed from view. The ape who sat in the bottom left cage being the exception. It had crawled from its enclosure and now stood on its hands and feet, watching me with it’s beady human eyes.

It knew, it knew that I was stuck there with it. Its shining eyes reflected lethal sentience that sent waves of terror across my spine.
