On a night where the moon was timidly hiding behind a blanket of thick clouds, I found myself alone in an empty playground, lighting a cigarette. The darkness surrounded me like a sinister blanket, and only the faint glow of my cigarette broke the blackness. I knew that park well, I spent a lot of time there, and I knew I was breaking the rules by smoking there, but I didn't care. There was no one to stop me, or at least that's what I thought.

As I exhaled a puff of smoke, my eyes landed on a nearby sign. It had the image of a terrifying eye and a chilling message: "Don't break the rules." I frowned, feeling as if the sign was looking at me disapprovingly. I shook my head to clear the absurd thoughts and continued smoking, watching the surroundings carefully.

Days later, my paranoia increased with each visit to the playground. The presence of the signs seemed to follow me everywhere, as if they were constantly watching me. Every time I lit a cigarette, I felt the questioning gaze of those terrifying eyes on me, judging me for my defiance of the rules.

I tried to ignore the growing fear that consumed me, telling myself that they were just signs and that they couldn't hurt me. However, the feeling of being constantly watched began to affect my sanity. I began to avoid the park, but no matter where I went, I always seemed to find piercing eyes watching me from afar.

I couldn't understand why I felt so haunted by simple signs, but every time I closed my eyes, the images on the signs haunted my dreams. The idea that they were plotting against me took hold of me, turning every moment into a battle against my own thoughts.

Posters with creepy eyes started appearing everywhere I went, on the streets, at my workplace, even on the walls of my own house. I felt like those eyes followed me everywhere, as if they were constantly watching me.

The messages on the signs seemed to become more and more personal, as if they were directed specifically at me. "We know what you did," "You won't be able to escape," "Rules are there for a reason." I began to feel harassed, scared by the intensity with which the posters were staring at me.

I tried to escape that overwhelming pressure, escaping in the middle of the night from my home in a desperate attempt to escape. The night had grown even colder, enveloping me in an icy embrace as I walked through the deserted streets, trying to escape the piercing gaze of the signs. Every corner I turned seemed to take me deeper into the abyss of that surreal world where eyes watched me relentlessly.

My footsteps echoed in the silence of the night, accompanied by the ominous echo of my own labored breathing. He felt as if he were being dragged into an unfathomable darkness, where reality was blurring and the boundaries between what was and what was not were fading.

In my frantic search to escape, I found myself trapped in narrow, labyrinthine alleys, where the signs with their haunting eyes seemed to multiply with every step I took. My heart pounded, filling my ears with the sound of my own anguish as I walked deeper and deeper into the darkness.

Finally, exhausted and desperate, I found refuge in an abandoned bathroom in a forgotten alley. But as I closed the door behind me, I realized with horror that I was not alone. The bathroom had become a twisted extension of that distorted world, where the posters with their watchful eyes surrounded me from all angles.

The flickering light from the old fluorescent lamp barely illuminated the claustrophobic space, casting grotesque shadows on the poster-covered walls. I felt trapped in an endless nightmare, where every dark corner seemed to whisper to me my worst fears.

Fleeing from that spectacle of shadows, I suddenly found myself in a dead end, surrounded by the signs that seemed to get closer and closer. The eyes on the signs glowed with sinister malice, and mocking laughter filled the air, as if mocking my desperation.

Trapped in that surreal space full of posters that seemed to have a life of their own, I struggled to maintain my sanity as the days slowly slipped by. The lack of food and water began to take its toll on my already weakened mind, and my thoughts became increasingly darker and more confused.

My attempts to find a way out became more desperate, but each alley seemed to lead me back to the same hopeless point. I clung to the thin hope of being rescued, but as time passed without any sign of help, that hope faded like a sigh in the wind.

I was torn between moments of lucidity and episodes of complete disorientation, where the posters seemed to close the ring around me, whispering promises of eternal damnation. Reality was blurring before my tired eyes, and the line between what was real and what wasn't became increasingly blurred.

In my agony, I began to succumb to despair and delirium. The posters taunted me with their ominous messages, feeding my fear and paranoia until I couldn't take it anymore. I sank into self-destruction, unable to resist the crushing pressure around me.

Desperate for a way out, I clung to the fragile hope I still had, the days faded into a haze of pain and anguish, and finally, when I could no longer bear the torment, I surrendered to the darkness that had consumed me. completely.

The only thing that keeps me sane is writing this before my body gives up, I doubt anyone will be able to find this, I doubt I will be forgiven for what I have done, but I don't deserve this, no kind of monster deserves this.

This text that you just read was recovered from a notebook found in a public bathroom, found by the police while they were investigating the disappearance case.

The case was archived due to lack of clues, this file came to me, and you can read it, only because a few days ago a note written on a piece of poster was found in the victim's house.

This note is the following:

&#x200B;

**Never break the rules never ever never never never ever \[▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇illegible▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇▇\], they see everything, they are \[▇▇▇▇illegible▇▇▇▇ \] Their laughter is deafening, grotesque laughter of little children,**

**\[▇▇▇▇▇▇illegible▇▇▇▇▇▇\] and tried everything, my hands \[▇▇illegible▇▇\] to try to tear off all the signs**

**They don't let me die.**

The photograph of the missing person began to be seen around the city next to the word “lost”, along with all those children who disappeared in recent months, almost as if it were a cruel joke, a lost man like a child who was separated from his mother and a cruel entity took him to a place from which he would never leave, a macabre presence that enjoyed hunting weak prey, moving among the shadows, where the only indicator of his presence was only the weak glow of his cigarette that broke the blackness of the night.
