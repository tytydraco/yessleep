I knocked on the security booth’s door and as expected, Nolan was still awake.

He was somehow even happier to see me than yesterday. He was like a dog, excitedly welcoming his owner back from work. It might be a poor comparison, but it was the most accurate way to describe his enthusiasm.

“Ben! Welcome back! How are you man?”

I, on the other hand, felt empty. My soul had been completely drained of emotion. Or rather, it would be more accurate to say, I have been feeling nothing but pain for the past hour. It was as though all my senses were being overwhelmed and interpreted as suffering.

Every motion, every breath, gnawed at the last bits of my energy. I had long gone past the point of exhaustion.

“Hey… can I stay here for the night?”

I could see his surprise at my unexpected request, yet I was looking right through him. I wondered what my face looked like. Did I look angry? Sad? Exhausted?

He scratched his head. “I don’t mind man since I also spend the nights here. I only use a pillow and blanket though. Is that okay with you?”

I simply nodded and he let me in, both lying down on the cold floor of the security booth. He seemed to understand something was wrong, and decided it was best not to ask any questions. After all, I had come back alive from that hell hole, as promised. He was instead staring at the ceiling, as if to say he wasn’t bothered by my mood.

I had grown to cherish the awkward silence in the orphanage after the lights were off. Nobody would bother me during that time, despite the occasional sobbing of the other kids.

It was so ironic. I was surrounded by so many people, yet I couldn’t feel any more isolated. It was the only life I had known, so part of me was drawn to it. The isolation, the pain, the suffering, all of them were mine at the very least, right?

Not to mention, the moon was simply gorgeous, signaling the end of an awful day. Due to my adoration for it, I always hated seeing the sun come up. I couldn’t even look at it properly without glasses anyway, so maybe humans weren’t supposed to acknowledge its existence?

Perhaps we should take it for granted as it’s compatible with our biology anyway. Just another fragment of this miserable world.

That said, tonight was different. Unable to sleep, I decided to distract myself with some conversation. Looking at Nolan lying next to me, I realized I didn’t know the first thing about him.

“How long have you been in this place anyway?”

He blinked repeatedly, as he turned to my direction. “I’d say… about a year or so.”

My eyes widened. “Tell me, how the hell are you staying motivated enough to keep working here?”

“It’s not the usual kind of motivation, I guess.” He pointed to the picture frame I had seen before, standing on his desk.

*“It’s because of my Goddess.”*

I raised an eyebrow. “That girl standing next to you?”

She looked about 8 years old and if I were to guess, Nolan was about my age, 18.

“That’s right Ben. She’s my sister and my Goddess. For her do I suffer in this hell hole.” He struck a dramatic pose.

It was the first time I had seen that kind of love between siblings. Back in the orphanage, all the other kids would just ignore me, since they were rewarded by the nuns for doing so.

“You two are really close then?”

“Yup, although we’re not related by blood, she’s the only family I have. I’m allowed to go see her once a month, thanks to the boss.”

I felt a small sense of kinship, but at the same time troubled as I connected the dots in my head. What the hell was actually up with this place? Was everybody here parentless? Maybe the maids were an exception. But something else quickly took priority in my line of thought.

“Wait, you’re allowed to leave? Why the fuck would you come back here if you can just escape.”

He took a deep breath. “Ben, please answer me this: What is your job?”

Ah, I see what he meant. “Rules won’t let you?”

He gave the most satisfied expression I had ever seen, accompanied by a gentle slap on the shoulder.

&#x200B;

“There’s another reason. The pay is good here, remember?”

I was skeptical. Would he really endanger his life for that amount of money?

His gaze shifted to the picture. “My sister doesn’t have a lot of time left. She has cancer and as you can imagine, hospital fees are expensive.”

What a cruel twist. Everybody in this place was suffering as a consequence of the mansion’s influence and their own circumstances. It was very unusual, coming across their different perspectives these past two days.

“My apologies Nolan, I’m not very sure how to reply to that.” It was the truth.

I wasn’t sure how to respond to his painful life. Should I compliment his determination, or should I apologize for what he’s going through?

He chuckled. “It’s fine Ben, I can tell that you’re a very straightforward guy. Do you know why I call her my Goddess?”

I shook my head. “Because you have a sister complex?”

He burst out laughing. “Hahaha, exactly Ben! I’m truly obsessed with this girl. Ever since I met her 3 years ago, I’ve never been happier. She became my salvation from the suffering of this miserable life, even giving unconditional love to someone like me.”

He appeared to be growing upset as he spoke. “She was abandoned by her parents and even got terminal cancer at such a young age. Despite that, she still smiles at me just like the first time I met her.

She forgave my sins and gave me a purpose to live. Just like a Goddess would.”

One question was still bothering me, and I had to ask. “What are you going to do after she passes?”

He looked at me, not angry, but somehow at ease. “***I will die.*** I don’t see the point of existing in this world without her and this mansion won’t let me go anyway.”

I couldn’t say anything about that. I truly agreed with his beliefs. This world was a horrible place, and the existence of a Goddess would truly give a glimmer of hope. Although his case was a bit weird, both of us had chosen a person to lay our hopes on, so that we had a reason to get up in the morning.

Hope is a fleeting emotion however, and if I hadn’t gotten this job two days ago maybe I would have…

“Sorry Ben, it seems I unloaded a bit too much on you. I don’t have conversations like these very often as you can imagine.”

A strange urge to voice my thoughts rose up from within me. If I were to die tomorrow, shouldn’t I at least leave a memory of me behind? Even if he were to forget me, this conversation would still remain irrefutable proof of my existence.

“Will you hear my story, Nolan?”

He nodded and I told him everything. From the childhood I had, to every single thing I had experienced during my stay at the mansion thus far. I couldn’t make eye contact at all. I felt as though I was being stripped naked, exposed for all to see.

However, a hint of comfort filled my consciousness. As though I was confessing my sins, expecting to be forgiven. Would that even bring me joy? To hear that I didn’t deserve the shitty life I had. Then again, I don’t think Nolan would reaffirm those beliefs.

In that moment, me and Nolan could both sense something neither of us were expecting to find. A weird, fucked up sense of companionship.

After I finished however, I succumbed to sleep and woke up the next morning to find snow had started falling.

Nolan was on the monitors drinking coffee. I stretched and he noticed I was awake.

“Morning Ben, I brought you breakfast, so eat up.”

I was having a bit of a cultural shock. It had been years since I willingly left the attic to sleep somewhere else. In addition, I had a deep conversation about myself with another person.

What did Nolan even think about me? Never mind that, today is the day.

I ate and we headed to Eleanor’s office.

“And there you have it boss, I’m going to borrow Ben here for a little while.” Said Nolan as he placed a hand on my shoulder.

After a few seconds I removed his hand since it started to affect me. Nolan thankfully understood and silently apologized with his polite smile.

Eleanor also noticed this small interaction and withheld eye contact from me. I suppose yesterday’s events had taken a toll on her. I couldn’t blame her since I also felt awkward being in her presence. She had seen a side of me which I had desperately tried to hide. I was ashamed.

She finally spoke up. “Very well, you may-“

“There you are Ben, I was searching all over for you.” Sophie said as she entered the room.

“I don’t suppose you believed slacking off was included in your schedule?”

I then proceeded to repeat what Nolan had stated moments before she arrived. She was stunned.

“What nonsense. Nolan, I don’t recall you ever requiring any assistance with transporting the mansion’s supplies.”

To some degree, I expected her to be against this plan since we hadn’t informed her of said plan to begin with. She must be worried about me.

“Sophie you don’t-“

*“I don’t suppose you could fuck off?”* Nolan barked beside me. The whole atmosphere of the room suddenly shifted. I wasn’t expecting him to snap at Sophie like that. Was I missing something?

“I beg your pardon?” Sophie’s brow furrowed.

“I don’t need your permission to get Ben’s help.”

He then glanced at me. “No wonder Ben is so depressed, having to share the same air you breathe.”

“Enough.” Eleanor interrupted.

“Nolan, Ben, you may go.”

“Mrs. Montague, I urge you to reconsider!” Sophie pleaded.

She sighed. “I’ve already made my decision.”

Defeated, Sophie grit her teeth and left the room.

“Nice! Let’s go Ben!” Nolan said as he went ahead.

I felt excited, I was finally going to escape this nightmare. I would finally be able to return to my normal everyday life…

“Ben…” Eleanor said from behind me.

Ah, that’s right. This was the last time I was going to see her. I would have to say goodbye to them. The only people I had begun to grow attached to. I wonder, if we had met under different circumstances, would we have ended up as friends of some kind?

“May you find happiness elsewhere.” She said with a mixture of sincerity and sadness.

In that moment, I could tell. She knew. She knew this was my escape plan, and she chose to help me, just like she promised.

“Goodbye.” I said with a determined tone. I wasn’t going to let this chance you provided for me go to waste. Unable to find Sophie, Nolan and I approached the car.

“Not that one.” Nolan, instead pointed to a red pickup truck.

As he and I drove off, I could see the mansion slowly fading from view. It was a beautiful sight, seeing the mansion I dreaded, finally disappearing from my life. As the truck jostled along the narrow road, we were enveloped by a thick blanket of falling snow.

The forest around us was transformed into a winter wonderland, the trees adorned with a layer of frost, their branches sagging under the weight of the snowflakes. The snow painted the landscape in shades of white and gray, muffling the surroundings with an eerie silence.

“I’m sorry if I scared you earlier Ben.” Nolan said, breaking the silence. I assumed he was referring to that tense interaction with Sophie.

“Has something happened between the two of you?”

He sighed. “Call it instinct Ben. I've witnessed her bringing numerous individuals through that gate on multiple occasions. Every single time I saw her expression, it was devoid of any semblance of guilt for her actions.”

“She doesn’t have a choice, remember?”

“I know, but even if it’s against your will, you’re still bringing innocent people to a slaughterhouse. The boss is the perfect example. I can tell she feels guilty no matter how expressionless her face may seem. You’ve noticed it as well, haven’t you?”

I couldn’t disagree with that. She was truly a kind person.

During our conversation, one question continued to occupy my thoughts. It was a question I had forgotten to ask the previous night, as we were preoccupied with our sorrows.

“Nolan, I never asked you. Why are you helping me escape?”

He, for some reason, was considering the question. Did he not know why he was even doing this?

“If I were to say, …it would be because of my nature.”

I turned to face him. “Your nature?”

“Yup, my parasitic nature.” An odd smile formed on his face.

I was surprised at the way he expressed himself, although he had his own way of saying things.

“You see, ever since I got here, I’ve had plenty of time to think. And I noticed a pattern within myself that I still can’t resist.

I can’t live by myself, Ben. I’m empty, completely hollow. This life is too boring for me to handle. And that’s why I feed off other people, even my Goddess. I need people to keep me alive, no matter what happens to them. Just like a parasite.

In your case, I could have helped you escape sooner. However, you still hadn’t fed me, with your story I mean.

All the butlers that I’ve come across couldn’t last a single day, but you are special. I knew your story would be fascinating and so, I decided to wait for you to open up.

People are wired to share their emotions with each other, and I was truly ecstatic when you came to see me last night. You looked like you had seen hell and come back to tell the tale. And what a tale it was.

That said, if you still hadn’t told me of your story by today, I would have postponed the plan until you did.”

I was speechless. I knew Nolan was fucked in the head but not to that extent.

“Are you being serious right now?

“Sure am! Don’t you think it’s funny though Ben? You’re undoubtedly the most fucked up guy to ever grace this butler job. But you still managed to survive the longest!”

I felt betrayed, as though I was being used. He was the first person to hear my story. But apparently it was all a lie. He wasn’t interested in me from the start.

Yet, I couldn’t ignore what had turned into a small craving within me. The need to be recognized. I still felt close to him, like catching up with an old acquaintance.

Nolan, no… people in general were very hard to understand. Why were they always using me for something? In their eyes I was just another person in a crowd, but couldn’t they see how different I was? None of them had experienced the same pain I had, yet they treated me just like everybody else.

Perhaps in the end, even Eleanor was using me as a way to comfort her guilt. Having finally found people who suffered, I still couldn’t bring myself to fully trust them and in this case, I was apparently right. Despite everything they had done for me, Nolan’s words pierced the hole that already existed in my heart. I was all alone once more.

He seemed to notice my despair. “Ben, it’s much simpler than you make it out to be. Just think of me as a guy bored to death.

A guy who will now reward you for easing his boredom. I think you understand this better than I do, that all good things come with a cost.”

I did not wish to speak anymore.

Eventually, we reached a wooden cabin on the side of the path. The structure stood stoically, weathered by time, its aged wooden panels hinting at years of withstanding harsh winters. The snow-covered roof slanted gently, preventing an accumulation of the soft powder.

“Here we are Ben.” We got off the truck and entered the cabin which was filled with crates.

“Due to the secluded nature of the mansion, supplies and letters are delivered in this little storage house, and it’s my job to move them to the mansion.”

I couldn’t care less what his job was.

“If you were to, hypothetically of course, escape while I was preoccupied with these crates, then that would make me very sad.” He winked at me.

Was that the grand plan he was talking about? “What about the rules though?”

“Are you familiar with loopholes Ben? You’re looking at one right now, if you wanted to escape that is.” He then proceeded to inspect the crates, turning his back on me.

After a few seconds, I carefully stepped outside. I was unsure if he actually meant what he said this time. Could I really trust this man? If he wanted me dead, he would’ve killed me already … right? Now that he had heard my story, I had lost all purpose to him, so this could potentially be an attempt at disposing of me.

Did he even understand how important this moment was for me? I could finally escape death, I could finally go home.

While I considered what to do next, my eyes wondered at an unexpected sight. A black spider stood amidst the snowy field. It stood out like a sore thumb due to the overwhelming contrast in colors.

I was startled by a familiar sensation in my chest. The cold air was unable to nullify the heat growing in my chest. Was I having a heart attack? No, that heat was exactly the same as last night. ***That is what one calls a pact. A soul contract if you will.***

I held down my chest as the spider retreated into the woods. Had the time come to honor our ‘deal’?

I reluctantly followed the spider to a nearby tree where an odd-looking knife stood amidst its roots.

It looked ancient, as if it was from a different era all together. Never mind that, I had to place this knife in the crates otherwise I would die a painful death.

As Nolan was loading the crates, I quickly opened one of them and practically threw the knife inside. And with that, the deal was complete.

*“Ben? You’re still here?”* Nolan’s voice startled me.

***You are not allowed to share this pact with our fellow mansion staff.*** I had to come up with an excuse and fast.

“Ye-yeah, I’m just-“

“Hold that thought.” He pressed a finger to his lips while scanning the area.

I was confused but I could faintly hear something. It was the sound of multiple footsteps walking on the snow, accompanied by growling. They were getting closer. Did this forest have wolves or something?

“What is that sound?”

“No, no, why now?! *Ben, stay behind me!*” Nolan pulled out a pistol.

Before I could ask any questions, the door was broken down. In walked an overweight, bearded man in his 40s. Before he could say anything, Nolan opened fire and the man collapsed to the floor, his body contorting.

I was about to comment on his rash decision, when the man started crawling towards us. *His back was completely gone*, as if someone had opened him up and removed all his insides. I gagged as the smell of decay began to fill the air.

Looking through the windows one thing became clear. ***We were completely surrounded.***
