When my husband, Ryan, and I bought our first house, we were thrilled. Our five-year-old twins, Eliza and Noah, were bursting with excitement over moving somewhere bigger, and even our six-month-old, Joseph, seemed to share their joy--gurgling and smiling in my arms.

Ryan had spent the past week working on the place with his brother, unpacking furniture and setting up the bedrooms so the move would be smoother--and a bit of a surprise for us.

For a split second, even I shared their happiness. But the moment the kids and I stepped inside for the second time, something shifted. The air felt heavier somehow, though the smell of Pine-Sol and Febreze practically stuck to everything. I tried to ignore it and focused on my family instead, but it felt impossible.

Ryan grinned, spreading his arms. "Well? What do you think?"

Eliza gasped dramatically, twirling like a ballerina, "It's beautiful! Can we have a dance floor?"

Noah darted past her, making a mad dash for the stairs. "No! Dance floors suck! We need a race track!"

Ryan lunged just in time, scooping him up before his feet could even touch the stairs. "Not so fast, speedster," he said with a laugh, "No racing until we get settled."

Eliza stuck her tongue out a Noah, "Yeah, *Noah.* You just don't know how to dance."

"I know how to win," he shot back, wriggling free out of Ryan's arms with a grin.

Their voices bounced off the ceiling that loomed high above the foyer, as they made their way toward the living room, filling the empty space. Even though the house was already full of furniture, the sound echoed longer than it should've--like the walls were repeating them a beat too late. I adjusted the straps of the carrier Joseph was settled in, and glanced up at the staircase. For a split second, I could've sworn I saw something move at the top landing--a shadow, maybe, or the way the light hit the banister. But when I blinked it was gone.

Ryan looked over his shoulder at me, still smiling, "Hey," he said, softly, "you okay?"

I forced a small smile, "Just taking it all in."

He nodded, stepping closer to press a quick kiss to my temple, "Told you it'd feel like home."

I'll be honest, at first I was thrilled with the fact we'd be moving to a bigger home because we'd been living in the same crappy two-bedroom apartment since Ryan and I had started dating after college.  It was fine back then, but with two toddlers and a baby, it started to feel less like a home and more like a shoebox with plumbing issues.

I smiled, but my eyes drifted to the stairs again. The air up there seemed darker somehow, heavier. And even though the house looked perfect, I couldn't quite shake the feeling that it was waiting--for something.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I set the steaming dishes of baked ziti, the smell of garlic and cheese filling the air. Ryan poured the drinks, while the twins scrambled into their chairs, giggling and talking over each other. For a moment, everything almost felt normal--the clinking of forks, the extra noise, and the soft cooing sounds coming from Joseph in his high chair.

I sat down, feeling the warmth of the food rising against my face. I was starving.

I was thinking, "Maybe tonight would be quiet" and, "Maybe this house wasn't as bad as I thought."

"This is incredible, Jane," Ryan said around mouthfuls of pasta, "Tastes way better than anything we've ever cooked in our old apartment."

"Thanks, Ry," I replied, taking a bite out of my food.

Across the table, Eliza suddenly burst into giggles. The kind of laugh that didn’t sound forced or nervous-- it was bright, delighted, like she was being *entertained.*

I smiled at her, lifting my wine glass. "What's so funny, sweetheart?"

Eliza pointed past me, toward the hallway that led to the front door. “The funny man,” she said between giggles. “He’s making faces!”

Ryan paused mid-bite, his fork hovering in the air. “What man?”

Eliza stopped laughing then, her expression softening into confusion. “He was right there.” She pointed again, this time slower. “By the stairs. He looked funny.”

Noah craned his neck to look, frowning. “There’s no one there, Liza.”

My skin prickled. I turned in my chair, glancing at the hallway. Nothing but shadows. Just the faint light from the chandelier pooling against the wall.

Ryan cleared his throat. “Eliza, maybe you’re seeing things. It’s late. Eat your dinner.”

She nodded, but I noticed her shoulders stiffen as she lowered her gaze to her plate.

Suddenly, Joseph started to smile and giggle at the hallway behind me, waving at something unseen.

I scooped him up from his high chair, my stomach twisting. "Who are you laughing at, huh?" I asked him, half-expecting an answer. His bright grin faltered, slipping away so suddenly it sent chills down my spine. He was still glancing at the hallway, barely paying attention to his mashed carrots.

I forced a laugh, putting him back in his chair, I was going to cut through another bite of pasta, but the back of my neck tingled.

Because for a split second--before I turned away--I could’ve sworn I saw it too.  
Something tall.  
Something standing just beyond the light.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After dinner, I carried Joseph up to his crib in the twins' room. His tiny fingers curled around mine as Ryan gave the twins quick showers, their yawns growing as they clutched their stuffed animals.

When the kids were finally tucked in bed, Ryan switched off the hall light and gave me a reassuring smile.

We crawled into bed, sheets cool and soft. The baby monitor's faint hum filled the room, it's small screen glowing on the nightstand. It showed a good view of Joseph's crib and the twins' bunkbed.

"Yeah," I murmured, checking the monitor one more time, "they're sound asleep."

Ryan slipped an arm around my waist pulling me close, "You did good today," he whispered, leaning his head back against the headboard, "I think this house might actually be a keeper."

I leaned in closer, thinking about it for a moment, my hand on Ryan's bare chest. I let out a quiet sigh, "Ryan, I know buying this house is a huge deal for us but--"

He turned to look at me, the easy smile on his face fading. His blue eyes softened with concern, and his dark, black hair was still damp from a late night shower. I hesitated.

"But, what Jane?" He asked gently, his voice low but laced with concern.

I swallowed hard, trying to steady my voice, "I just...can't shake the feeling that we're not alone here. Everytime I step into a new room, it feels as if I'm intruding or interuppting something. I always have a sense that I'm being watched or there's something in the room with me."

Ryan stayed quiet, his expression unreadable, so I went on, words tumbling out faster now. “And it’s not just me. The kids have noticed things too. At dinner, Eliza said she saw a man down the hall--making faces at her. She thought it was funny, but when I looked… there was nothing there. And Joseph--he was giggling, staring at the same spot. I swear, for a second, I saw something move. Just a dark shape.”

Ryan shook his head with a reassuring smile, "Jane...they're just kids. You know how wild their imaginations are, especially in a new place. And you've been stressed. I'm sure it's nothing."

"It's *not* just nothing," I said, glancing around. Suddenly, there was a cool breeze, way too cool for a warm August night. Goosebumps prickled along my skin. I didn't want to say it, but someone had to, "I think...this place might be haunted."

Ryan chuckled, "Ok, Jane," He said, kissing me on my forehead, "I think it's time we go sleep. You've been on edge since we got here."

"I haven't been on edge," I shot back, though what he said was true. I crossed my arms trying to sound confident, "It's called trusting your gut feeling."

Ryan smiled faintly, though there was a trace of tired affection in his eyes. "I get it, it's a new place, everything feels different. But we're safe ok? It's just the house setting. We'll get used to it." He kissed me once more, and we both said our goodnights and went to sleep. But I couldn't close my eyes at all. Somewhere downstairs there was something dragging along the kitchen floor, scraping against the wood. I must've been the only one to hear it because the noise came when Ryan fell asleep. I told myself that it was the house settling, but it felt like a lie.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When I opened my eyes again, the room was dark. My phone screen blinked beside me, reading **3:10am**\*\*\*.\*\*\*

*Must've fallen asleep at some point in the night*, I wondered, but didn't think much of it. I closed my eyes to drift back to sleep, but they were already watery from a yawn. I picked up my phone from the nightstand and noticed I got a message that was sent at three on the dot by an unknown number.

I unlocked my phone and clicked into iMessages. The number had the area code for Washington, which was where we were currently residing from California, so that meant this person was definitely here.

I read the message, my eyes widening.

**You're dead. If you don't get out of our house soon, you'll never hear the end of it.**

My pulse quickened, "What?" I whispered to myself.

I had no clue what the message meant, and whether it was a joke or not. Ryan and I were the official owners of the home now, and no one else was living in it other than us and the kids...right?

As if knowing I'd just seen the message, the entity responded.

**I know you're reading this, Jane Wilder. Get out of our house now or we'll make you leave.**

Goosebumps covered my skin, as I kept staring at the message like I was suffering from a seizure. I was completely frozen in shock and worry. At that moment, there was a shrill scream down the hall. It sounded like one of a little girl's. It wasn't Eliza's, that's for sure. It sounded child-like and demonic and distorted. Footsteps followed after. They came in a pair, one sounding like high heels hitting the floor, and one sounding like regular shoes slapping against the wood. They walked slowly and I heard the twins' and Joseph's room door open for a few seconds, and then shut. My heart pounded, as I frantically reached for the baby monitor on the nightstand.

It had gotten turned off at some point in the night, which didn't normally happen. I shook it vigorously hoping it turn on. Then, the screen flickered showing the feed of the kids sleeping. The twins were safe and sound on their bunkbeds, and Joseph was asleep in his crib.

It seemed like I had nothing to worry about until I noticed three dark figures standing in the corner.

A man.

A woman.

And a little girl who looked to be about 6 years old.

They dressed like it was the 1800s: the females wore long dresses, the man was wearing a brown suit with elbow patches and a fedora. The trio emerged from the corner, and stood in the center of the room watching the kids sleep. I was shaking.

Their outlines were faint at first, as if the monitor was trying to fill them in, pixels struggling to keep up. They didn't look real. They looked faded and glowed with a blue hue. I wanted to convince myself it wasn't real, but I knew full well it was.

I gulped, hearing the tune "Rock-a-bye-baby" play out of no where, eerily in the room. The man's head tilted slightly, and even though the image was grainy, I could still see the unnatural bend in his neck. The woman's long hair hung foward hiding her face, and the small girl's hand twitched rapidly like she was waving--or warning.

Then, all at once, the screen started to glitch--static erupting again before the figures *snapped* back into view.

They weren't human anymore.

Their limbs had stretched, faces blurring into something distorted and hollow. The little girl's hair stood up straight like she was going to be electrocuted, her eyes seemed to melt, dripping away until her face was left looking empty. Her head snapped backwards at an impossible angle, as her legs bent and reshaped into those of a goat's, her skin tightening against bone as if her flesh was being sucked away, like a vaccum picking up crackers.

The woman's eyes fluttered rapidly, widening with every blink until they bulged, rimmed with blood-red veins. Her skin blackened, charred like burnt paper, while beside her, the man grew taller--taller still--his head nearly brushing the ceiling. His face smoothed into nothingness: no nose or ears, beady eyes and a line too thin for a mouth. Horns split through his skull, sharp and glistening in the dim light. The group's fingers elongated next, stretching like strands of wax, curling into long, spidery talons.

The woman opened her mouth and revealed a long, crimson red tongue, dripping viscous liquid that looked far too much like blood.

My breath caught in my throat. The screen flickered again, and for a split second I swore I saw the girl’s head twitch--jerking at an unnatural angle--before the image dissolved into static.

“Ryan,” I whispered, shaking his shoulder.

He stirred, groaning softly. “Jane… what’s wrong?”

“Wake up,” I hissed, thrusting the baby monitor toward him. “Look. Look at this.”

Ryan sat up, rubbing his eyes. “What is it now?”

“Just--watch,” I said, pressing the monitor into his hands. My pulse pounded so hard I could feel it in my throat.

The screen flickered again. Static crackled. And then--there they were. Three distorted figures standing by Joseph’s crib, their shapes twisting and wrong, faces blurred like they were being smeared across the screen.

Ryan blinked hard, leaning in. “What the hell--?”

Before he could finish, the image jerked violently, the figures turning toward the camera in perfect unison.

Then came the scream. It wasn't Joseph's. It wasn't human. It was a sharp piercing cry that made my blood run cold.

Ryan dropped the monitor on the floor, screen going black. For a second, neither of us moved.

Then I whispered, my voice barely there, "That...came from his room."

Ryan's face went pale. He was already out of bed before I could breathe another word.

Ryan pulled on a shirt and sweatpants reached for the door first, his feet barely thudding softly against the hardwood floor. I followed close behind, my heart hammering in my chest so loud, I thought he could hear it. He pushed the door open.

The room was still. The dim night light glowed softly in the corner, casting a warm orange glow over Joseph's crib and toys scattered all over the floor. Joseph was fast asleep as if nothing had happened. Eliza and Noah were curled up in their beds, untouched and breathing evenly. Everything looked normal. Too normal. The only sound was the faint hum of the baby monitor still on the dresser, its green light blinking steadily.

Ryan took a step inside, his voice low and rough. “Joseph?”

No answer. Just the soft rhythm of his breathing.

Then I saw it--  
The air around the crib shimmered faintly, like heat rising from asphalt, before vanishing in an instant.

“Ryan…” I whispered, wrapping my robe tighter around my body. "Did you see--"

"I saw it," he cut in, his voice tight. He turned to me, jaw clenched eyes hard in the dim light. "Jane, get the kids."

"What?"

"Get the kids," he repeated, firmer this time, "We're getting out of here."

I froze for half a heartbeat, staring at him. Ryan never panicked. He was calm through everything--flat tires, storms, even hospital trips. But now, his hand was shaking slightly where it rested on the crib rail.

"Ryan..." I began, but he shook his head.

"Now, Jane."

The tone in his voice snapped me into motion, and hurried over to Eliza on the top bunk and reached for Noah on the bottom. My pulse thundered in my ears. the air felt colder by the second--even with my robe on--heavy with something I couldn't name.

I wrapped the twins’ blankets around them, cradling them both as best I could, then grabbed my phone from the nightstand in me and Ryan's bedroom and hurried downstairs.

Eliza rubbed her eyes, "Mama? What's going on?" she asked, her small voice groggy.

"Shh," I whispered, trying to be calm, "We're just going for a drive."

"But it's dark out," Noah mumbled, resting his head on my collarbone.

"I know," I said, kissing his forehead, "It's just for tonight."

I put the twins down and helped them into their shoes and shoved my bare feet into my sneakers, without caring whether I had socks on or not. I picked up the twins again and held them close.

Ryan finally came downstairs-- seeming unbothered-- holding Joseph who was tucked protectively in his carseat. His face was tense, jaw tight, eyes scanning the dark corners of the foyer as he made his way closer to the front door. He made it seem like it was all normal.

Suddenly, the lights flickered. Once. Twice. Then steadied again.

Eliza whimpered, wrapping her arms around my neck. “Mama, I’m scared.”

“I know, baby,” I murmured, my heart racing. “I am too.”

Ryan turned toward the door, reaching for the knob. The house seemed to groan. A deep, low sound, like the wood itself was resisting. "Let's get out of here," He muttered, more to himself than me.

The door wouldn't budge. Ryan twisted harder, keys jangling in his hand.

My stomach dipped, "Why isn't the door opening?"

His jaw tightened, "It's...stuck."

A sharp chill ran down my spine, "What do you mean *stuck*?" I asked, sounding with more attitude than I intended.

Then somewhere behind us came a soft, deliberate creak. Like footsteps.

The creak came again--closer this time.

I turned my head, breath caught in my throat. At the top of the steep steps, were the three demonic figures from earlier. Their faces were blank with no expression and they looked pale, washed out almost, like old recordings of people from the 1900s; color constantly fading off their clothes.

The figures came closer, bloodthirsty for more. “Ryan,” I whispered, clutching the twins tighter, who whimpered with far.

He looked up--and froze. “Jane,” he breathed, “let's get to the car.”

The figures started down the stairs as if going with our plan. Slow at first, then faster--each step echoing like a crack of thunder.

Without a second thought, Ryan kicked the door open, which sent it flying with a violent creak that made me jump. "Go!" He barked.

I ran. Sneakers pounding against the porch, the twins clinging to me, their muffled cries mixing with the pounding in my ears. The night air hit like ice as I stumbled toward the SUV parked in the driveway. Behind me, I heard the sound of wood splintering, the floorboards groaning under something that shouldn’t exist.

Ryan was right behind me, holding Joseph's carseat. “Get in!” he shouted, unlocking the car with his free hand.

I fumbled with the handle, my hands shaking so badly I could barely grip it, until it finally gave way. Ryan thrust Joseph’s car seat into my arms, and I hurriedly set the twins and the baby inside, my breath coming out in quick, uneven bursts. I scrambled in after them and slammed the door shut just as Ryan rounded the front of the SUV and dove into the driver’s seat.

Through the windshield, I saw them--  
The figures started to run forward at an impossible speed all of them on all fours. They were after the car.

“Step on it!” I cried.

He turned the key. The engine sputtered once--then roared to life. The SUV shot backward down the gravel drive as the figures lurched forward, their movements jerky and wrong, like puppets with broken strings.

For a moment, I thought they’d follow us down the road. But as soon as the tires hit the street, the shapes stopped--frozen at the edge of the property, standing in the glare of the headlights.

They just… watched us go.
