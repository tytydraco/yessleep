It was on a weekend. I woke up early in the morning and knew something was wrong. I was home alone. My father, with whom I lived in a large house in a new housing development from the 90s in the southwest of Germany, was, as usual, at his girlfriend's for the weekend.

The night before, I had been at the youth center in Welschbach, a small village in one of the neighboring areas, where, at 15 or 16, we had nothing else to do but smoke weed and drink vodka energy. The way home always led me through forests and meadows, spanning several kilometers. And even though the effects of the drugs would wear off on the way back, I never slept well because I was always afraid in the dark when I was alone. The gloomy atmosphere and eerie silence of the countryside would often linger even in my sleep.

When I stepped out onto the terrace from the living room that morning, I could already hear the chickens, and it suddenly dawned on me that the fox must have been there. I quickly ran to the barn. Feathers were scattered everywhere, and there was a metallic smell of blood and decaying flesh in the air. The fox seemed to have taken two chickens with it; one lifeless body lay motionless in the barn. The remaining chickens had gathered around a bloodied hen, whose side had a deep wound running from the head to the wing. Her gaze was cloudy, and she breathed weakly. I recognized her. It was one of the hens that had raised the new chicks in the spring and had taken care of them so devotedly.

I was in shock but quickly pulled myself together and wondered how I could end the animal's suffering. My first thought was the axe, with which we usually decapitated the chickens in our garage when we had a number of roosters among the chicks we intended to slaughter. But when I searched for it, I couldn’t find it. In my panic, I decided to use the heavy sledgehammer, which my father affectionately called "Big Bello."

I rushed to the garage, grabbed Big Bello,  positioned myself firmly in front of the hen and struck twice with all my strength directly to its head. I hit so hard that the severed head of the chicken was completely smashed and sank several centimeters deep into the damp earth.

I was out of breath, knelt next to the mangled corpse, and stared blankly into the void. Did I do the right thing? I still ask myself this question to this day when I think back on it.

From the kitchen, I grabbed some trash bags, collected the pieces of the body, and threw everything into the regular trash.

Throughout the day, I took several showers. I still remember that at the time, whenever something was on my mind or I was feeling sad, I would sit on the floor of the shower cabin and let the warm water pour down on me for several minutes. I’d then turn off the water and sit there in the mist of the cabin until I was completely frozen and started to shiver.

When I told my friends at school about the incident with the chicken the next day, they were disgusted. Although we constantly shared violent videos and pornography through the Bluetooth function on our phones, my story seemed to disturb them in a completely different way.

I had always been a reserved and quiet teenager, and now I had shocked them, earning their sincere respect. The existential nature of this brutality, and my confrontation with the decision over life and death, seemed to add a new, complex dimension to the image they had of me.
