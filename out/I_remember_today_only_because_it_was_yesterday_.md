Yesterday. I woke up with a horrific feeling about the day ahead.

A feeling so entrenched and seared to my soul I hardly remember a time without it. Grade school, maybe, Christmas ages ago. It doesn’t matter.

I then forced my fleshy husk to sit up and finally stand. I stood staring at nothing in particular with bone dry eyes swaying ever so slightly, listening to the familiar whispers between the sheets of drywall till I noticed the sun bleeding through the blinds. It’s existence challenged my own and convicted me with shame and haste.

I jolted violently, my body moving on its own accord as it began shuffling around the messy maze I’ve entombed myself in. I stayed behind remaining in my head everything going by in a blur. I was comfortable there, confined to the safety of my skull. I noticed another person and almost panicked but I realized my body found itself. I was facing a mirror and I was disgusted. Dragged from my skull to bare witness to this corpse of a man. My skin pale and scarred pulled taught against my bones, my ribs threaten to burst from their thin prison of flesh. My hair unkept and ragged sitting lazily above my gaunt lifeless face. A smile seemed to split open my dry lips but I certainly wasn’t smiling. The mirror was. Once broad and strong shoulders now sit sunken and defeated, my eyes very much the same. A malnourished disgraceful waste of flesh with half a soul and whatever else crammed in here with me.

“The man in the mirror isn’t the same one I grew up with ya know.” This one spoke so softly.

“Not what you expected to see as a kid. huh.” This one coldly stated as I continued to stare motionless jumping for a moment as I heard someone laughing in my shower. It doesn’t matter.

The mirror stares through me. The mirror stares and stares, I don’t dare break its gaze until my body finally turns and finishes whatever it was doing. I happily recede back into my thoughtlessness trying to disregard all I’ve witnessed. That was until I realized my body was holding something in its hand. My heart hurt. It reminded me it was there and not apart of the blurry mess that surrounded me, it then sank to the depths of my being as I realized I was holding a doorknob.

I couldn’t go out there. They can’t see me like this. The world knew someone else and it knows I’m not them. It knows. I know it does and I can’t go out there wearing this skin. I can’t go out there. My eyes swelled with water my hands began shaking as my heart palpitates with shame and fear pumping through my veins.

“What kind of man can’t open a door? Can’t step outside?” Hushed murmurs erupted from all around me. Various voices of different people I’ve never heard before mocked me.

“Grow a pair loser. What a fucking pussy. Is this guy joking or what? Just die already. Slit your throat or we will. Nobody can hear you suffering. We’ve all heard it. We know.” The voices sounded like whispers at first but then suddenly turned into a yelling with this muted agony as if they were being smothered while screaming at me.

They swirled around me rattling my ears with unwavering ruthlessness until all at once they seized. It was only then that I realized I was slumped against the front door one hand still awkwardly held onto the door knob while the other lay limp at my side. Tears streamed down my face and my breath was hard to catch up with. It doesn’t matter.

I finally stood back up and walked hastily to my living room for relief. I grabbed the lighter and began to inhale my thoughts away washing them down with abit of alcohol happily allowing them to swirl into the abyss leaving me blissfully mindless. From what ive heard this is far from Heaven but I’m convinced it’s as close as I’ll ever get and I’m very thankful for it. That’s when I noticed out of the corner of my eye she was back in my windows. I quickly threw myself behind my couch not daring to move as I knew she'd be frantically peeking around the perimeter of my windows looking for me but she’ll never find me, I’m always too quick for her.

She terrifies me though and I know if she ever did lay eyes on me she’d come right through that glass and take me straight to hell or worse id bet my life on it. Im sure of it. I cant ever let her see me she cannot get in here. It doesn’t matter.

After a long while of hiding I realized the sun was retiring from another gruelling day of shining. This meant she’d be gone and I could move freely infront of windows again although I’m still cautious and avoid them if I can. I can never be sure if shes gone or not.

I was hungry now so I ate whatever slop I had. I barely tasted anything and it probably wasn’t worth tasting. Right after I finished I heard a chuckle from under the table I sat at and a scream upstairs. The scream was startling but the chuckling man under the table wasn’t. He was always here and there. He sat cross legged smiling at me giddy like he’d just won an award, his hands moving around constantly touching different parts of himself and the ground. His clothes were 2 sizes too small and his bearded face was twisted into a yellow toothy crazed grin. I felt his gaze as I cleaned my plate and fork, and made my way back to the pain relief.

Another couple inhales and another long swig later I find myself back upstairs in my bed staring at the ceiling wishing it’d come crashing down to free me from this place. From this purgatory. Why was I put here. I mean here specifically why couldn’t I be in space? Or the ocean? Or another body. A different soul. As I lay here on my phone slowly drifting away the whispers within my walls almost start to make sense for once. Why won’t they ever finish what they’re saying? Do they know that im listening? Why is today just like yesterday? What happened the day before? Is tomorrow ever arriving?Please can anyone help me I don’t know what to do I’m stuck here and I’m so alone.

Everyday is the same. I’ve got no one to talk to and im always talked about I can’t do it. I want to meet me again please help me find him. Please find me. I hope this gets to someone. I hope I don’t remember today. God save me. It doesnt mater.

Yesterday. I woke up with a horrific feeling about the day ahead.
