I’m not sure where to begin, but I’ll try to explain everything as clearly as I can. I live in an apartment building on the third floor—unit 305. For a while, everything seemed normal. But then, it started. At first, it was just small noises. Some thumping above me, maybe a piece of furniture being moved around. But over the course of a few weeks, it got worse. I heard footsteps—loud, heavy footsteps that didn’t sound like normal walking. And then, there was something else. It sounded like whispers. Not words, but this constant, low murmur that would come through the ceiling late at night. I couldn’t sleep because of it.
 
I figured maybe it was just the neighbors upstairs. I’m not crazy, take no drugs and in no way believe in this sort of thing. So, one evening, I knocked on their door. The door opened a crack, but no one really said much. I asked if they knew anything about the noise, and they just acted confused, like they couldn’t hear me or something. But I could hear it clearly. it’s not in my head, the pacing, the whispering—it was getting harder to ignore. This has been a constant frustration for me, I’ve let the building manager know, and he hasn’t done anything about it. It keeps me up, work has become harder without sleep, and it’s not like I can just pack up and move. I’ve even slept in my car a few times, just to get away from it.
 
One night, I woke up around 2 a.m. to what sounded like nails scraping across a chalkboard. I couldn’t tell where it was coming from exactly, but it was so loud, ear piercing, I thought my whole apartment might collapse. I got up to bang on the ceiling with a broom, but right when I stood, it stopped. Total silence. Dead air, like I was the only one in the building. I’m tired, and at this point scared shitless.
 
I didn’t know what to think. I was just standing there, now next to my bed, waiting for it to start again, but there was nothing. I finally gave up, praying for the silence to continue. Then there was a knock at my door. It was soft, but it definitely came from the other side. I looked through the peephole—no one was there. I opened the door, and the hall was empty. But when I turned back to look at the ceiling, I swear to God, I heard a voice coming from the ceiling. It filled the air around me, thick like a dense fog. “We’ve been calling to you.” It said. I turned to look around, searching for its origin and standing in the hallway was a figure—someone, something, but their face wasn’t right. It was blurry, like it was out of focus, and it felt like it wasn’t even real. I—I don’t know what happened next. I must’ve panicked, because I slammed the door shut and locked it, but that’s when the noise started up again, only this time, it was louder, like something was scratching on the walls, moving closer to me. That’s when I decided to post this. To reach out for help. To see if anyone has had similar experiences living in an apartment complex. It can’t just be me; this can’t be an isolated event. I’m pretty freaked out, I either need to be admitted, or must face the fact that something, otherworldly exist.
