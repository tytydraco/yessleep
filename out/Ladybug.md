I was sixteen, living in the hidden gem of my country, a small town surrounded by lakes, mountains, and tall pinewoods. From the outside, it looked like paradise. But decades ago, diamonds were discovered beneath the soil, and the town was never the same. Mines multiplied. The air grew thick and heavy. No matter how rich the ground was, life above felt drained.

The weather was always gloomy, matching the mood of the place. A clouded sky, constant rain, and temperatures that rarely rose above eighteen degrees. The people weren’t much different. Most were normal enough, some quirky, but the elderly carried a heavy stare that could kill you. Whenever they looked at me, it felt like they were disappointed in something I hadn’t even done.

There was no entertainment, no malls or cinema or parks. The only place anyone ever gathered was Danny’s Pub. A dive restaurant-bar, glowing red with a flickering neon sign on the edge of the main road.
Truckers stopped by, while families ate greasy dinners. Singles tried to escape their loneliness. And the jukebox played forgotten ’80s hits in the background. Everyone ended up at Danny’s, whether they liked it or not.

I was in my last year of high school and proud just to have made it that far. The teachers barely did their jobs. My classmates cared more about gossip and trends than learning. I liked being alone.
But being alone in a small town doesn’t go unnoticed. People said I was rude, or that I acted like I was better than them.
The truth was, I just didn’t care much.

Except about Lorelay.
She was my best friend.
The only one who truly got me.
She spoke her mind and threw herself into every humanitarian cause she could find. I still remember the first time we talked. Her chestnut hair was wavy, freckles blended across her cheeks. She sat beside me in class, and I noticed her socks: one blue, one purple.

“Looks like you didn’t have time to get ready this morning,” I tease her playfully, pointing.

“You caught me,” she laughed, awkwardly tucking her feet under her chair.

“Don’t worry. We share the same secret.” I hiked up my pant leg to show my mismatched green and pink pair.

From that moment on, we were together, silent witnesses to the brutality of high school.
Then there was Melanie.
She was blonde, tall, captain of the basketball team. She had a body built for power and the face of an angel. People loved her. Or feared her. Or both.
She hated me. I never really knew why. Maybe because my simple presence irritated her. Maybe because she thrived on drama and attention and I gave her none.

Her boyfriend was a legend, at least according to the gossip. Girls talked about him in bathrooms like he was a celebrity. 
I’d never seen him. He didn’t go to our school. I doubted he could live up to the hype.

Until I saw him.
It happened outside the school gates. He was leaning on his bike, back turned. Dark hair, styled clothes giving him an effortlessly cool mystery. When he turned around, his eyes met mine: sharp, icy blue, like he saw something in me even I didn’t know was there.

He looked like a male version of a husky.
That was my first thought.
It wasn’t just attraction. I couldn’t look away.

“That’s him,” Lorelay whispered. “Melanie’s boyfriend.”

Girls around us giggled, looking at him, but I couldn’t move. His gaze held mine until Melanie appeared and clanged on his neck like he was a trophy. The spell broke. But something inside me didn’t let him go.

Later that evening, Lorelay and I went to an old antique shop downtown. I needed a cover for my diary. She had a soft spot for vintage jewelry. 
The shop smelled of dust and mold. The old man behind the counter ignored us,until I exclaimed.

“Jackpot!”

I found a leather diary cover embroidered with silver floral patterns and tiny ruby stones. But inside, on the lining, a phrase had been scribbled over and over in messy ink:

“There’s another one, same like this one. Don’t ever forget: There’s another one, same like this one.”

It was weird.
But I was drawn to it.

“You sure you want this?” the old man asked, finally looking up and adjusting his glasses. His eyes were kind… but worried.

“Yes. It’s perfect.”

“Objects choose their owners,” he mumbled, almost to himself. “This one has chosen you.”

That night, I stopped by Danny’s for food.
And there he was: Melanie’s boyfriend, without Melanie.
I tried to walk past, but he caught my eyes again. I froze like a deer in headlights.
The other mans were sipping their drinks, checking me out.

“You sure give off the vibe of a damsel in distress,” he said later, when he caught me outside.

“And you’re just another reason for it,” I answer back.

“What’s the worst that could happen?” he smirked. “Die? Or worse be used and tortured until you die?”

“You’re oddly specific,” I said, half-nervous, half-annoyed.

He smiled. But when he saw me hesitate, his face softened.

“I’m Kyle.”

“Anne.”

“Come on. I’ll walk you home.”

I should’ve said no. But I didn’t.
We walked the dark streets. I was quiet, awkward, trying to calm my nerves. But somehow we ended up laughing. He was reckless. Magnetic. The kind of boy who made you feel alive, even when you knew he could ruin you.
When he touched my shoulder, I knew what he wanted.

“No,” I whispered. “You’re with someone.”

“She doesn’t matter,” he said.

Then he kissed me.
For the first time in my life, I understood why people went insane for love.
The next day, Melanie found out.
In the hallway, she cornered me. She held my arms, making me unable to move.

“I saw you with him,” she yelled. “Meet him again, and I’ll destroy you.”

Before I could react, she pulled my hair so hard my neck twisted. Then, in front of everyone, she spat her gum in my face.
Her friends laughed, and rage took over me.

I try to push her off me, even if she was heavy.

She slipped.

One stair.

Two.

She rolled all the way down, screaming, until her head cracked against the concrete with a sound I’ll never forget. Blood spilled out through her nostrils, pouring. Her body twitched. Part of her skull looked split open.

Everything went silent.
Everyone stared at her then back at me in shock, disgust and judgement.

I stepped back, slowly. Then ran.
And I ran. Through hallways. Through the gates. Through the town. Through the people .
I ran until my lungs had no air and my legs gave out.

I collapsed in the woods, screaming. Clawing my fingers in my face.
Begging God to take me instead.

I had killed the high school sweetheart. Everyone will hate me.
Kyle would hate me.
I’d spend the rest of my life in a cell.

Right now , I had only one desire. Going home and hugging my family one last time, before everything will collapse.
When I got home, I lied. I said I’d failed a math test.
I kept saying “Sorry” for things my family didn’t understand.
I went up in my room and my cat curled beside me.
I cried myself into unconsciousness.

I woke up because something was crawling on me.
Something wet and rough pressed under my back.

I opened my eyes.
I was in an open field, lying on grass. I look up, perfectly clear night sky with stars flickering above. The air was clear and cold.

A tiny ladybug sat on my arm.
For a moment, I thought I had died.
Had God heard me?

But I’d never been this scared in my life. I was swaying, holding my knees. 

I forced myself to stand and walked toward the near road. I walked for more
than one hour till a car approached. I panicked, until I saw the driver. An older woman, her pink lipstick glowing under the cabin lights. A little boy was asleep in the backseat, hugging a teddy bear.

“What happened, doll?” she asked gently.

Lie. Fast.
“I had a fight with my boyfriend,” I answered . “I preferred the open field to his car.”

She sighed. “Get in. You shouldn’t be out here.”

“Could I use your phone?”

“I’m not one with technology, honey. And to be honest, I’m glad I won’t live long enough to learn.”

She dropped me off near Danny’s Pub.
But something was wrong.
This time there were no trucks or people. No music in the background either. Inside, a waitress I didn’t recognize wiped the counter in silence.

“Can I use your phone? I just need a cab”

She pointed. “Go ahead.”

No cabs were available. I walked outside. The streets were empty. All the houses were dark with no one inside. There were no lights, or people, or sounds, not even wind.
I turned back, Danny’s was gone.
The neon sign flickered once… then off.
Something was deeply unsettling. I just was inside.
I pinched my arm, hard, to try to wake myself up.

That’s when I heard it.
A noise coming from the woods, getting closer and closer to me. 

A deep, loud grumble.

I went still. 

Then a massive stag stepped on the road. Its antlers were huge, meaty, and dripping with thick, fresh blood.
I collapsed backward on the asphalt, trembling so violently I couldn’t breathe.
The stag turned its head. Slowly.
And for one long, terrifying moment, its eyes met mine.

And I knew, this wasn’t a nightmare.
This was just the beginning.
