  Hi,my name's Tyler, I am a 40 year old man and a proud dad, this is my first post on this subreddit, hell, I barely even post on reddit at all, but what happened recently shook me so deep to my core I have to share it.  
  
  I was laying around my two story house watching TV at late hours, I was downstairs in the living room sitting on the couch, my wife, Marla, sleeping next to me and my kids asleep in their rooms aswell, as I watched a movie at low volume as so nobody will get woke up, I hear two taps at the window that is right near the couch Me and my wife are laying on, I immediately jump and look at the window with so much fear I was about to pass out, but as I stare through the darkness of the night masked slightly by the curtains, I don't see anything, or anybody, My Reasonable Me thinks that maybe a branch hit the window, it was infact windy outside, a branch from a tree could've just been blown by the wind and bounce against my window twice, but My Paranoid Me realizes that there is no tree anywhere near our backyard. Before I could think it through more, a loud thud and glass shattering is heard through another window, I jump in panic, damn near having a heart atack, but the thing is, the sound was heard from upstairs...  
   
  I immediately rush to investigate, first noticing the window in shatters before looking in horror as I realize the door to my childrens room is wide open, I rush inside and I feel as my body is about collapse in on itself as I see that my kids aren't there anymore, but all of the sudden, from downstairs I hear the loud scream os my wife, I immediately rush downstairs to investigate and stop halfway down the stairs where I have a clear view of most of the first floor, to my horror, my wife dissapeared aswell, however, leaving behind her a pool of blood on the spot of the couch she layed before on, I still remember how some of the blood would leak down slowly on the wooden floorboards, making this wet sound I will never forget, I simply freeze, not being able to comprehend anything, and then just out of the blue, all the windows in my house start loudly breaking, wether is downstairs or upstairs it didn't matter, I then just collapse on the ground, not being able to comprehend anything that was happening near me, and just start breaking down crying and screaming.  
  
  As I continue to lay defenselessly on the ground crying and screaming, I manage to find some power in me and attempt to rush downstairs to call 911, but as I tried taking one step down the stairs, I realize I am being held back by my straitjacket, and just as I look around the white room I am laying in, I remember that I was put in a mental asylum for killing my wife and children.
