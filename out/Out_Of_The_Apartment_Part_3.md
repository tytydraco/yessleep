I can't believe we’re in this situation. Not the zombies, I’ve already come to terms with that. Of all the people we could have ended up with it had to be…I’m getting ahead of myself. This morning Drake and Me were discussing possible escape routes. Aside from the obvious human flesh cravers, the main obstacle will be getting around abandoned vehicles.

The idea we came up with was going to the roof of the tallest building in town. It would give us the best vantage point to see if any clear roads were leading out. This did pose a risk as it meant going closer to the zombies.  It’s not as if that’s a hazard that can be avoided outright. We prepared first with some stretching followed by breakfast.

We didn’t want anything too heavy since we’d be moving around a lot.  We each had several bowls of instant fruit oats with some bananas, bagels, and coffee.  For our venture, we were bringing some protein bars I snagged at Walmart and some water.

“Alright, how long do you want to spend on this?” I asked as we stood up from the table.

I collected the styrofoam bowls and plasticware as Drake replied.

“We can’t use our GPS so we’ll have to write down street names.”

“Do you think the town hall might have some maps?”

“Oh yeah, good idea. We’ll have to keep an eye out for that.”

For self-defense, we had our nail guns as well as axes. The kitchen has some knife sharpeners that we tried on the heads and we also made slings for them. Both of these seemed to have worked pretty well. As I’ve mentioned, close melee is something we want to avoid.  If we have to engage, though, we want to end it quickly. Drake waited by the entrance as I was brushing my teeth upstairs in our room.

I think it makes more sense to do this after eating. Drake believes that as long as you brush twice a day, it doesn’t matter. I came back down to see him on his phone. Noises from the game Tetris came from it.

“Ready?” he asked.

“Yeah and I got the binoculars,” I replied, holding them up as they hung around my neck.

“Cool, let’s go.”

We moved the chairs we’d set up in front of the doors and unlocked them, then stepped outside.

“Are we taking your truck or do you think that might attract too much attention?”

“It should be safe for a certain distance. We can walk the rest of the way.”

There’s something especially unnerving about driving through a town that’s devoid of people. To think, all this went down only a few days ago. I guess it goes to show that things can go to Hell fast. We went about three-fourths of the way and then Drake pulled his car to a stop.

“Remember, we parked at the barber shop.”

“Noted, are you leaving the keys?”

“No, are you crazy? My truck might get stolen.”

“What about the starting problem?”

“Don’t worry. I took a look at that the other day. It should be good.”

We got out, being mindful of how hard we closed the doors. We stayed low as we were making our way to the town hall. It was going smoothly, only having the occasional close calls. Two zombies spotted us. We used our nail guns to make short work of them before they could alert any others.

Reaching the town hall, we became apprehensive due to the entrance being ajar.

“We might have company here. Stay sharp,” Drake said.

I glanced around and my eye fell on the water fountain.

“Hang on.”

I went over to it, reached into the water, and grabbed a handful of rocks.

“What are you those for?”

“Distractions.”

We went up the steps and then peered inside. Once confirming it was safe, we proceeded, locking the door behind us in case any surprises wandered in. Since our steps echoed, we were making sure to move carefully. Every so often I would peek through the binoculars to get a better view of what was ahead.

“Hang on,” I whispered.

“What?” Drake replied as we both halted.

Scanning the floor ahead, I could see the reflection of several zombies along the marble flooring.

“Get your weapons ready. We got a lot to clear out,” I informed him.

We each took cover behind the wall on opposite sides. I checked one of the rocks and sent it skittering across the floor. The moaning and growling of the living dead soon followed. The first of them shambled around the corner. Drake fired his nail gun, hitting it in the head.

As soon as it collapsed, more were coming into view. I took out the next one, then Drake the one after. This repeated and for a while, we were making quick work.

“How many of them are there?” I asked as one was running at me. “They just keep coming.”

I fired, getting it in the throat.

“Just keep it up. It's not like we'll be out of ammo anytime soon.”

One zombie that was just an upper torso had been clawing its way toward Drake. Being occupied with the others he hadn't noticed it.

“Hey, the floor,” yelled.

He gasped when it was almost to him and shot it in the eye. It reached out to him and then fell still.

“Thanks.”

“Don't mention it. Well, I guess that takes care of…”

“Gus, is something wrong?”

“Is it just me or did I just hear something drip?”

We glanced at the floor behind us and saw a red split. We glanced up in time to see a zombie that was clinging to the ceiling, dropping down to try and pounce on us. We moved out of the way in time, screaming as we did. This thing was new. It scurried on all fours, snarling at us.

We aimed and pulled our triggers only for nothing to happen.

“They're jammed,” I said.

“No shit.”

We backed away slowly as it eyed us with a deep famine. Maybe it was the fear messing with my head, but I could have also sworn I could see the faintest hint of intelligence in its yellowed eyes.

“Guess we'll have to do this the old-fashioned way,” Drake said and put a hand on his ax handle.

I did the same. The crawling zombie let out a screech and lunged at us. Yanking out my ax, I swung, smashing the zombie across the face with the flat side and partially gashing its face with the edge.

It was back almost as soon as it hit the wall. Assuming Drake was easier prey, it went after him.

Unlike me, he had more time to get in position. Unfortunately, he misjudged the arc range of his swing. Instead of getting the zombie's head, he got it in the chest.

“Gus, help,” he yelled, holding it back as it clawed at him while it was balancing on the ax blade.

Drake tripped backward over a corpse and fell to the floor. All he could do was keep a leg up to keep from getting torn into. Heart pounding, I rushed over to him, and with one swipe, buried my ax in the zombie's temple. It swayed to the side and Drake shoved it away, immediately scooting back as soon as he did.

I was going to check on him until I noticed the fucking thing was still moving. Raising my weapon, I brought it down like splitting firewood. At the moment of its cranium crunching and bits of its brain getting stuck to my ax head, it stopped moving. I glanced at it, then the bits of gray matter, and found my breakfast making an unexpected upward exit.

“You good?” Drake asked, patting me on the back.

“Yeah, I just need a minute,” I replied between deep breaths.

My legs were wobbling so I was steadying myself against the wall.

“It's a lot worse when it's up close.”

“I know the feeling.”

The hall leading to the Mayor’s office was caked in dried blood. Under the light, there were scratch marks as if people had been dragged away. Disturbing though that was, what unnerved us more was the state of our elected, a term I use loosely, leader's workspace. Pushing the door open, we were greeted by a spotless office. Given what we dealt with earlier, this didn't sit right with either of us.

Not to mention, all the rooms we passed were in complete disarray.

“I’m guessing Schneider got out of dodge when things went south,” I said.

Mayor Bill Schneider wasn't known for what he did so much as what he didn't do. Ask anyone living among one of the many pothole-filled streets what they think about him. You will be hard-pressed to get a flattering response.

“Of course that good-for-nothing shit sucker abandoned this town,” Drake grumbled. “Whatever, let's just find that map and then get to the roof.”

We got one from the desk along with a pen and then took the stairs going up.

“Sart looking and let me know if you see anywhere viable. I'll make sure to mark it here,” Drake said.

Raising the binoculars to my eyes I began searching.

“Cars are blocking most of the roads,” I said. “The police station is empty, though.”

“No surprise there.”

When we first moved into town, we dealt with a break-in. We tried calling 911

However, after ten minutes of having our stuff ransacked, we decided to handle things the baseball bat way. The cops then arrived promptly to take our statements two hours later.

“Hang on, that might work,” I said, hopefully.

“What might?”

I informed Drake that there was a dirt road behind one of the neighborhoods stretching outside of town. He marked the route leading to it on the map.

“Alright, I say we head back and pack. That way we can…” he said, trailing off.

“What?”

“Do you hear that?”

I listened closely, only detecting the noises of roaming zombies. Then there was another sound, a rumbling that was familiar to us. Looking through the binoculars again, I saw Roscoe. He was in his white Hummer speeding through town. Behind him were some of his buddies in their own vehicles except for the last one.

“Drake, you might want to see that hat  this.”

His jaw dropped upon using the binoculars.

“They stole my fucking truck,” he roared.

Roscoe and his group drove by a building across from the town hall. Drake began foaming at the mouth,  mentioning all the unspeakable things he would do to them.

“Hey, relax, man,” I said. “Let's talk with them. I'm sure we can smooth things…”

The person driving his truck made too sharp of a turn, going over a curb, and crashing into a tree.

“Out,” I finished.

Stumbling out, the driver had a bottle of beer in one hand and a beer in the other. Drake's screaming caused birds to take flight.  My heart sank because this was the equivalent of ringing a dinner bell. Roscoe and his friends, on the other hand, were ecstatic and not subtle about expressing it either.

“It’s hunting time, boys,” Roscoe hollered.

They cheered and began firing at the zombies as they came.

“Maybe we should wait a bit,” I said.

We left the roof and decided to check the other rooms more thoroughly until the gunfire died down. Most of them didn’t have much use. The last one, on the other hand, contained something unexpected.

“This one’s locked,” I said, jiggling the handle. “Here, maybe we can wedge-”

Yelling, Drake smashed the window of it with his ax, then reached inside and unlocked it.

“Or that works too, I guess.”

Stepping over broken glass, the office we entered was stacked with paperwork.

“I feel sorry for the poor bastard who had to work in here,” I said.

“Gus, is that you?” we heard someone ask.

Peeking out from behind the desk was the familiar and disheveled face of Van.  From his odor, he was overdue for a shower.

“What are you doing here?” Drake asked.

He explained that back in our neighborhood, he’d managed to get away.  Without a car, the only place he could get to safely was the town hall.

“I’ve been sneaking into the kitchen and then back here for days. I don't know how I've managed to avoid them for so long.”

“Do you know anything about why this is happening?” I inquired.

“Sorry, I'm as clueless as anyone else. Not to be too forward, but do you have anywhere safe I can stay?”

By the time all three of us were outside, Roscoe and his ilk were guzzling down beer. Several of them were dancing on Drake's truck. His grip on his ax handle tightened. I put an arm out in front of him and then spoke up.

“Excuse me.”

They all turned

“Oh shit,” Roscoe exclaimed, “I thought you guys were dead.”

He noticed Van and frowned.

“Surprised to still see you kicking, pussy.”

Van smiled in return.

“And I see that being a drunk fuck is still all you're good at.”

Sensing an altercation brewing, I intervened.

“Roscoe, listen, you do know the truck your friend was driving belonged to Drake, right?”

He blinked a few times, then glanced at it still smoking in front of the tree and back at Drake.

“Oh shit, my bad man. We saw it parked at the barber shop and my buddy, Clint, knows how to hotwire that model so we thought we'd take it for a spin.”

“Well, I'm short one truck thanks to that,” Drake replied, irritably.

“Don't sweat it, man. We can get you another one. Isn't that right, fellas?”

They answered yes in a rousing cheer.

“Want some beer?” Roscoe asked.

“Not right now,” I said.

I was going to explain me and Drake's escape plan when all hell broke loose. From the roof of the building close to us jumped about a dozen of the crawling zombies. It all happened so fast there was no time to warn anyone. The next thing we knew there was panicked shrieking and firing. Our encounter with the one earlier made us better prepared for it and we began hacking away.

Even then, we survived by the skin of our teeth. Now it was Me, Drake, Van, and Roscoe staring down the brutalized remains of his friends.

“So we've been staying at a hotel,” I said, averting my gaze from the aftermath of the carnage. “Mind driving us there?”

Roscoe, still in shock, nodded. Then we got in his Hummer and rode in silence. That brings me to now. Trying to keep the peace between Roscoe and Van has been nothing short of migraine-inducing. Oh well, hopefully, we'll be out of town tomorrow so we won't have to deal with this anymore.  Until then, I hope we can keep from [losing  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromRose/)our [heads](https://www.threads.net/@rose_black2222).
