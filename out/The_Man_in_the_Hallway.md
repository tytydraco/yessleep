I live alone in a small, run-down apartment on the third floor of an old building. It’s not much, but it’s cheap, and I don’t really need much space. I work from home, mostly keeping to myself, keeping things simple. The building is quiet, almost too quiet. Sometimes, I think I’m the only one here.

Every night around 3:00 AM, I wake up. I don’t know why. It’s like an instinct, like something just pulls me out of sleep. At first, I thought it was just my mind playing tricks on me, some kind of weird sleep cycle. But it kept happening—every single night, without fail.

The first time it happened, I woke up to complete silence. The air was still, cold. My apartment felt unnaturally empty, even though it was just me inside. I lay there, wide awake, staring at the ceiling, trying to shake the feeling of being watched.

That’s when I heard it.

A faint sound—something from the hallway outside my door. At first, I thought it was just the building settling. But then I heard it again. A slow, deliberate *footstep*, followed by another, and another. It was faint, but it was there. Someone was walking down the hall. The odd thing was, the footsteps didn’t seem to stop. They just… continued. Moving back and forth in front of my door. Almost like someone was pacing.

I sat up in bed, heart pounding in my chest. There was no way anyone else was awake at this hour. This was a quiet building. The neighbors kept to themselves. I should’ve been the only one up.

I waited, breath held, staring at the door. The footsteps continued, growing faint and then louder, as if the person was moving closer to my door. I reached for my phone, the screen glowing in the dark, but I froze when I heard it—*the sound of a key turning in the lock.*

My heart skipped a beat. I hadn’t unlocked my door. I always double-checked the deadbolt before bed. I pulled the covers up to my chin, holding my breath. The key turned again, slower this time, as if someone was testing the lock.

And then, just as suddenly as it had started, the sound stopped.

The hallway went silent.

I stayed there for what felt like hours, too terrified to move. I didn’t sleep that night. The footsteps, the key in the lock—it felt like a nightmare I couldn’t wake up from.

The next morning, I checked the hallway. There was no one there. Nothing out of the ordinary. But the hairs on the back of my neck stood up when I noticed something odd. The *doorframe* was scratched—small, barely noticeable gouges, as if something had scraped against it.

The next few nights were the same. I would wake up at 3:00 AM, the footsteps in the hall, the sound of keys, the slow pacing outside my door. But no one ever came in. I never saw anyone in the hallway. There were no footprints, no traces of anyone there. It was as though the sounds were just *created*—by something unseen, something that never fully revealed itself.

I began to feel paranoid. Was I losing my mind? Was I imagining it all? My thoughts spiraled, and every night, the fear grew. I couldn’t sleep. I couldn’t shake the feeling of someone—or *something*—watching me from just beyond the door. I even started to see shadowy shapes in the corners of my vision, standing still, but always *just out of sight.*

But it wasn’t until the night of the storm that everything changed.

It was a particularly violent night, the wind howling and rain pouring so heavily against my window that it sounded like the building might collapse. I was awake, of course—staring at the ceiling, trying to ignore the sound of the footsteps in the hallway.

But then, something different happened. This time, the footsteps didn’t stop. They *moved*—slowly—toward my door. I could hear the sound of keys, faint but unmistakable, scratching against the lock. But then… something else. The sound of *breathing*.

Heavy, ragged breaths.

I froze. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t even blink. The breathing continued, growing louder, closer, and closer to my door. It was coming from the other side, just inches away from where I lay, and I swear I could feel the cold air pressing against the wood.

And then… it whispered.

"Let me in."

I felt my stomach twist into a knot. The voice was deep, low, guttural. It wasn’t human.

I wanted to scream. I wanted to run, but my body wouldn’t move. I was paralyzed, unable to do anything but wait, listening to the breathing and the whispering growing louder and louder.

And then it stopped.

Just like before, the sound of footsteps faded away. The breathing stopped. The door remained still. Silent.

I don’t know how long I stayed there, terrified, unable to move. Eventually, I must’ve fallen asleep, because I woke up the next morning, covered in cold sweat, and for the first time in days, I dared to look at the door.

There was nothing.

No scratches. No signs of anyone being there.

But the terror has never left.

I still hear it, every night. The footsteps, the breathing, the whisper. And now, every time I wake up at 3:00 AM, I hear it closer. It’s moving *inside* the apartment. It’s *in the room* with me.

And I know, sooner or later, it’s going to find me.
