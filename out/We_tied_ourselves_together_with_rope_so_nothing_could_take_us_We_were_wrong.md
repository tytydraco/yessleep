I grew up in silence.

My never spoke a word for as long as I knew him. Not one. His throat was scarred ruin, rope-burned deep into the flesh, and his eyes were hollow, like whatever had once lived inside him had never returned. 

Whenever I asked, the answer was always the same: "The swamp took his voice.”

That was it. No map. No story. Just a curse spoken like a warning.

He died last winter. While cleaning his attic, I found his journals. The pages were swollen with damp, the ink smeared and streaked with mud. What I could read ended abruptly, his final line scratching into paper hard enough to tear it: rope.

I should have closed the book. Should have let the silence die with him.

But I didn’t. 

Because when you grow up with silence, you either let it smother you… or you chase it.

So I gathered a crew six of us in total. A botanist, a zoologist, two local guides, 
Munroe with his forced laughter, and me the fool who followed his father’s ghost. We took provisions, rope, journals, lanterns. And we stepped into the swamp. 

The fog swallowed us whole.

At night, the world ended. No frogs, no birds, no insects. Just silence so heavy it crushed the air from your chest until you can hear nothing but blood rushing in your ears. I lay awake that first night, staring into the mist, and thought of my father jerking awake in his chair, clutching his throat like something was still wrapped around it.

On the second night, fenn swore he saw a lantern bobbing through the reeds. A glow weaving back and forth, like someone walking ahead of us. The guides froze, muttering prayers I didn’t recognize. I told fenn it was nothing. A trick of the light.

But I had seen it too.

The next morning our provisions were scattered in the mud. The rope we had lashed them with was sliced clean through not frayed, not chewed, but cut, smooth as glass. The men argued: rats, sabotaged, anything but what it was.

We pressed deeper until we found the camp.

The old one. My father’s.

It waited in the fog as if thirty years hadn’t passed at all. Bedrolls laid out. A journal left open mid-sentence, ink unfaded. Lanterns hanging from branches, still filled with oil.

Impossible. But there it was, persevered as if the men had only just stepped away.

We didn’t touch it none of us could.

That night we tied ourselves together with rope. Six men bound shoulder to shoulder, as if unity could save us. 

But before dawn, the rope went slack.

Rodriguez had been at the end of the line.
One moment there was weight, the next gone. The rope trailed into the mud, cut clean again. His bedroll was still warm. His knife still strapped to his belt.

No splash, no scream, just absence. 

The others started whispering about me. About my father. About blood. I wanted to deny it, but that night I heard his voice. Not the rasp I had grown up with the full, strong voice I had never known. Calling me from the fog, warm and calm. And I nearly answered.

Fenn vanished next. His scream cut short, the rope slack in our hands. Munroe broke then. He shouted at the mist, cursed it, dared it to take him. By morning, he was gone too. Not cut this time just empty space where he had sat.

Keating lasted another day, muttering about methane, about hallucinations, about science, as though the equations could keep him tethered. When the rope snapped at his waist, he didn’t fight. He just started into the fog as it pulled him away. 

The guides tried to keep watch. One vanished while pissing in the reeds, the other while knotting the rope tighter. Both gone without a sound. 

And then it was only me. 

The silence pressed down until I thought my chest would splinter. Faces swarm in the fog Rodriguez, Fenn, Munroe, Keating… and my father. They beckoned from the mist, smiling, whispering my name. 

The rope at my waist tugged, not cut this time but pulled. I felt it slide across my throat, searing, tightening. I clawed at it but there was nothing there. Just the burn. Just the breath being stolen inch by inch.

That’s when I understood. 

The swamp doesn’t want them all. It never did. It only ever wanted one. One to crawl back out broken, mute, scarred, to carry the silence into the world beyond. To lure the next generation in. 

My father had been that man. And now it’s me.

I don’t remember how I escaped. Only the daylight stabbing my eyes, the air tearing at my ruined throat. I haven’t spoken since.

But the silence didn’t stop with me. 

Because last night, in the fog outside my own home, I heard my child’s voice. Calling my name. 
But my child was asleep inside the house.
