This is where everything took a sharp turn for the worse. 

We crept quietly through the house, making our way to the back door, in the utility room. The yard was overgrown and the night was still deathly silent. The moonlight barely illuminated us, and we kept our flashlights off while we were outside so Sarah the ghost girl wouldn't know we were out there. Yazmine turned to us, “So, when we get in there, where should we look?” 

“The basement,” Vanessa whispered, looking at the world through the camera lens, “the eyes could be in there. There were some kids toys in there, I think the killer liked taking souvenirs from his victims, he must've had more than the four they found in the basement. The eyes could've been kept as a souvenir before he decided to kill himself.” 

My heart raced as we snuck our way around the side of that house towards the back door of the Eye Ripper house. We were actually going into the basement for a third time after everything that happened, and I hated it more than anything, but I knew that I wasn't gonna stay in that room with Zack. Not just because I was afraid of looking like a coward, but also because the general atmosphere felt so ominous with him around, even more than usual in this ghostly realm. 

We went through the back door, and our tensions were the highest there. We quietly padded down the hall towards the kitchen. I stopped the two, shakily asking, “What if that boy is in there again?” 

“I think Bryce just pissed him off, maybe he won't hurt us,” Vanessa said hopefully, “so far no one has really gotten hurt.” 

“We don't wanna test that theory, though,” John said doubtfully. 

“We'll be in and out, quick and quiet,” Yazmine assured me. It didn't help ease my frayed nerves. John put a finger to his lips to shush us as we carried on. 

The basement door loomed before us like a gateway to hell. We opened it and shined our flashlights down the stairs, the beam just barely touching the floor beyond the last step. We didn't hear or see anything from our vantage point, so John took the first step, followed by Yazmine, followed by me, followed by Vanessa. It felt like walking into a lion's den, and not only that but knowing full well that the lion hadn't eaten in a long time. 

When we descended the flight of steps, the basement seemed devoid of life, and that somehow felt creepier than if another entity was down there. 

“Hurry,” I whispered, immediately starting to search for anything that might look like it could possibly contain decomposing children's eyeballs. I didn't know what that would even look like, maybe a morbid keepsake chest? Everyone started looking as well, shining their flashlights around and spreading out, a frenzied urgency in their movements.

I couldn't stop looking over my shoulder to make sure that monster wasn't looming over me again, especially when I bent down to check inside the furnace, which definitely seemed like a place someone would get rid of remains. I didn't even think about the fact it would be ash, my brain was too focused on ensuring I wouldn't be ambushed by something that looked like the kid from the Grudge. Strangely enough, though, a teddy bear was inside, old, worn, and full of dust and soot. It looked familiar. I grabbed it and studied the plush, trying to think of where I'd seen it. 

Wait…. The picture. 

When I’d looked up the Eye Ripper case online a week ago, this exact bear was being held in the arms of Millie Jenkins, the girl in the purple dress. On Wikipedia, I read an article about her, and one of the photographs included there was of her cuddled up next to her mom on a couch during Christmastime, and she was clutching that bear to her chest. It was unmistakable, with orange button eyes, a cute tiny smiling mouth, and a red plaid bowtie under its chin. The belly looked like it had been stitched poorly, the sewing work abysmal. 

I could feel my heartbeat in my ears as I took my fingers and yanked up the seams. As the sounds of my friends’ shoes scuffing the ground while they explored the dank basement became white noise, I forcibly ripped open the hole inside the teddy. 

There was a little sack inside, tied at the top by a string, something of a sachet with a texture like a potato sack. 

It absolutely reeked. 

My nose scrunched up and I held it away from me. “What the fuck,’ I said, garnering everyone's attention. 

“What is that?” Vanessa inquired, coming over quickly to film my finding. John and Yazmine approached, too.

“I don't know.” I noticed the bottom of the sachet was darkened with the stain of a long-dried substance. Something viscous enough to not disappear when the fabric wasn't wet anymore, like water. With quivering fingers, I pulled the string and opened the bag for everyone to see. John shined his flashlight down in it. 

“What the hell is that?” Yazmine sounded befuddled. 

Inside were two black, shrunken little round…things. They were very clearly the origin of the smell, and they looked like grapes, olives, or blueberries that had aged a thousand years in the sun. 

“Wait a second-” I dropped the sachet and backed away, becoming aware of the horrible truth. “Are those eyes? Are those her goddamn eyes?” 

“H-holy fuck.” Vanessa breathed, her bottom lip trembling. “That's actually what eyes look like when they're decomposed. I saw it once, on an animal that died on my grandma's farm. They become these little black things.”  

“Fuck sake!” John lifted his shirt over his nose with his free hand. “That's sick!” 

“You guys!” Yazmine’s face was a mixture of horror and excitement at the revelation, if that was even possible. “It's terrible, but we actually did it! We found the eyes!” 

“We found a pair of eyes,” I corrected her, “he hid them in Millie's teddy bear. I saw a picture online with her holding this exact one, it's definitely not a coincidence.” 

“If we want to appease all four of the victims, we need three more pairs of eyes,” Vanessa realized with great dismay.

“Oh, gross,” John gagged, backing away so he couldn't smell the rot. I tied the sachet back up. “I guess you can hold onto that, Grace.” 

“Gee, thanks.” I rolled my eyes. 

 “Everyone, keep looking!” Yazmine urged. “We gotta-” 

Our walkies crackled, and we all stopped to listen. There was silence for a few moments, as if someone was holding the button to speak but choosing not to say anything. After a bit too long of waiting for them to speak, John raised the walkie to his lips. 

“Zack, Bryce, are y'all okay?” He whispered. It felt like the world was still for a few tense moments, as if it had stopped spinning and we were frozen in time. 

*“John,”* Bryce’s quaking voice whispered through the speakers, *“you guys need to come back right now.”*

“What's wrong?” Yazmine pressed, panic flashing over her face. 

Bryce whimpered, his breathing ragged as if he were truly scared for his life, *“... There's something wrong with Zack, I think-”* An unexplainable sound interrupted him and the walkie stopped making the static sound.

“The hell?” I said, feeling fear gnaw at my chest. The walkie crackled back to life again before anybody could say anything else.

*“John.”* Zack's voice, quiet and emotionless, sounding nothing like the emotional and energetic Zack we know. It didn't sound like he was calling him as much as he was just stating his name, as if someone had asked what his friend's name was and he was answering robotically. 

“Zack, the fuck are you doing to Bryce?!” John roared. Yazmine, Vanessa, and I leaned in, listening closely. I glanced over my shoulder to make sure there was no ghostly spectator. 

*“Where are my eYeS?”* Zack asked, his voice warping towards the end of the sentence, like an old doll with a voice box broken from age and wear and tear. It deepened in pitch towards the end, like he was an old machine slowly powering off. ***“GIve tHeM bAcK.”***

“What the fuck?” John screamed. We all looked at the walkie in horror. 

Yazmine picked up her walkie. “Bryce?! Bryce, where are you?!” 

There was no answer. 

“I-Is that really Zack?” Vanessa whimpered, her eyes bulging nearly out her skull. 

“Shit!” John ran for the stairs, and Vanessa and Yazmine followed right after him. I immediately ran after them, all of us sprinting towards the basement door, which we'd left open for an easy escape. Desperate to save our friend. 

The door slammed in John's face and he immediately shook the doorknob, trying futilely to open it.

“It’s locked!” He yelled, the panic in his voice contagious. 

“Oh my God!” Vanessa despaired, no longer holding the camera up to her eye. “We're going to die!” 

“Break it down!” Yazmine demanded, her face soaked with sweat. “Use that jock strength!” 

“Back up.” John said, and we obeyed, right before he started kicking and kicking at the door. It rattled on its hinges with each thrust of his sneakers. Then, he braced it with his shoulder, and started ramming his arm into it over and over. 

I watched him and prayed inside my mind for the God my mom always preached about to save us from this nightmare. Then I felt the hairs on the back of my neck stand up, and an unwanted presence dangerously close to me. 

I turned around in a flash, a gasp ripping out my throat as I shined my flashlight on the pale, eyeless, and dead face of Millie Jenkins. Every horrifying detail inches away from me on the step under the one I was standing on, the way her eyes were like the deepest holes, like she had nothing but a void back there, no flesh or anything. The bit of blood rimming her eyelids. The way her mouth was pressed into a tight line, like corpses whose mouths were sewn shut at the morgue. 

The others turned to look and the stairway was filled with the chorus of everyone's mortified screams. I could hear the door creak and their feet shuffling as they all fearfully pressed themselves against the basement door to be away from the entity . I, on the other hand, couldn't seem to break eye contact from those two bone chilling hollows. Twin abysses staring back at me. I could somehow feel her terrible aura which shrouded her, it felt like despair and rage and longing, radiating off her form like heat from an oven.

Then, her arm was suddenly outstretched towards me, I didn't see the gradual movement of the limb, it switched positions in the blink of an eye. Her hand was out, palm up. 

Feeling as though I were on autopilot, I dropped the sachet into her palm with shaking hands and recoiled. 

Finally, the ghost of Millie Jenkins, as if a puppet pulled away on invisible strings, floated backwards, swallowed into the cavernous darkness behind her. I felt her presence leave, it was like a dozen weighted blankets being lifted from my chest. 

John tried the door again and it opened. We rushed out into the kitchen, breathless and weak in the knees. I felt like I could barely stand. 

“You…you did it.” Vanessa stared at me, impressed. “You gave that creepy little bitch back her eyes.” 

“Dude!” Yazmine reprimanded her.  

“What?” Vanessa whined. “It’s not like she can hear me, clearly she moved on. One down, three to go.” 

“We need to get back, right now!” John reminded us as he hastily ran for the back door. We followed behind him, and retraced our steps to the second house’s back door. If that little blonde girl Sarah was still at the front, we did not want to be noticed by her, not without having her eyes at least. 

As soon as we were inside, we ran straight for that bedroom upstairs where we left the two, not caring how much noise we made. When John opened the door and we all filed in, it felt like my heart would explode in my chest from the anticipation. But the sight we got wasn't what we expected. 

Bryce and Zack were standing there looking back at us, completely fine it seemed. Sure, their stances were rigid and their eyes wide with an unwavering gaze like a scared animal, but they seemed relatively unharmed. 

John sighed and crumpled in relief, rubbing his face. 

“Dude, what happened?” Yazmine asked. 

“Me and Zack played a lame joke.” Bryce said disinterestedly. 

“Sorry.” Zack said, not even cracking his usual annoying smile. 

“That's not fucking funny!” Vanessa yelled at them. “We thought something bad was happening!” 

The two didn't react. They simply stood and stared and stared and stared. John seemed to find it as weird as I did. 

“Are y'all good?” John asked, skeptical. “You're being all weird.” 

“Well, anyways,” Yazmine impatiently said before they could answer, “Grace, like a complete badass, gave one of the ghost kids back their eyes and they like, ascended or some shit. I was right, we just need to find where that sicko hid their eyes, he kept Millie's in this little bag and hid it in her toy bear like a creep.”

We waited for their reaction, but got none. 

“So…” I began awkwardly. “Zack, are you feeling better?” 

“Yeah.” Zack said flatly. 

“I wonder if the other eyes are in the basement, too,” Yazmine said, turning to me and ignoring the two boys, “we didn't have time to check because of their unfunny little prank. We should go back.” 

“Let’s go outside.” Bryce said, his voice sounding weirdly hollow like Zack's. “Vanessa, you come with me, Yazmine, you go with Zack.” 

“Where are we going?” Vanessa raised an eyebrow. 

“Yeah, and why is *she* going with you and not *me?”* Yazmine's voice was rife with suspicion and jealousy. 

“I know where to find some eyes.” Bryce replied simply. 

“Me too.” Said Zack with the smallest of nods. “We should go quickly.” 

“Whoa, wait a sec,” John said as Zack and Bryce stiffly walked out the bedroom door into the upstairs hallway, “we just got back from outside, can we just catch our breaths for a moment?” 

“No.” Bryce said without turning around, leading Zack downstairs. We watched them, befuddled, in the hall. Something was very, very wrong. I turned to Vanessa, John, and Yazmine with a hard look on my face.

“I don't trust this,” I whispered, “follow my lead, okay?” 

“It's my boyfriend-” Yazmine started. 

“I don't care.” I held a hand up. “If I'm wrong, I'm wrong, but at least let me find out.” 

I quickly went down the stairs before they could stop me, Bryce and Zack had already made it to the front door and were looking at me expectantly. 

“Where are our friends?” Zack asked robotically. 

“They're coming, let's go outside and wait for them,” I said, opening the door.

No sooner than their shoes hit the pavement of the cement walkway, I slammed and locked the door.

“Grace.” Bryce stoically said on the other side. 

“Grace.” Zack echoed him, like a lifeless parrot. Then, a slow thudding against the door. Knock. Knock. Knock. Too patient, eerily calm. 

Vanessa, John, and Yazmine watched from the top of the stairs. I looked back at them, my eyes haunted. “If they were acting normally, they'd be swearing at me and screaming to be let back in.” 

“So what's wrong with them?!” A fresh wave of tears fell from Yazmine's eyes. 

“I don't know,” I admitted, “please, let's just go back upstairs and think for a while.” I ascended the steps, not wanting to dwell on the hopelessness of our situation for at least one blissfully ignorant moment. 

“But what if those things hurt them!” John argued as I brushed past him.

I stopped. “I don't think that's them anymore.” I replied without looking back, and then entered the room again. 

Yazmine instantly started to weep bitterly, darting down the hall and slamming herself into a separate bedroom. Vanessa made no sound as she recorded John and I, standing there with our expressions crestfallen. John shoved the camera lens away from his direction as he moved past Vanessa and went into the other bedroom by himself in the opposite direction. His door slammed, too, making me flinch. 

I looked at Vanessa. She looked back at me through the camera, not saying a word. I went deeper into the room and asked, “Are you coming in or not?” 

Vanessa wordlessly followed me inside and gently shut the door, still holding the camcorder up to her eyes. I sat on the bed and gave her the dirtiest stare I could muster. “Why are you not talking to me or looking me in my eyes?” 

She ignored me, opting to lean against the dresser with the mirror as she recorded. 

“Answer me.” I said. 

She crossed her ankles and gently kicked her feet back and forth, as if this were just a regular day. 

“Answer me!” I picked up an old fashioned alarm clock from the nightstand and threw it at her. She dodged, and it shattered the mirror. She stood up and backed into a corner, her breathing becoming uneven, as if I was the crazy one. 

I got up off the bed. “Vanessa, I swear to God…” Just like Yazmine had earlier, I lunged for the camera, and she shrieked in a wild sort of rage and valiantly fought me for it. I fell back, dragging her to the moldy carpet floor with me, and we wrestled with it. Rolling around and grunting, squirming and writhing, slapping and pushing, our faces red and perspiring with effort. 

Finally, I pried the camera out of her hands, which felt like peeling gum off the sticky suction cups of a squid's tentacles. She jumped at me for it and I held it out of reach, like my bullies did with my comfort toy back in elementary. 

When it became clear she wasn't getting the camera back, she sank to the floor and sobbed into her hands. 

“Why are you doing this?!” I snapped at her.

“Because I don't want to be here!” Vanessa wailed, finally providing my question with an answer. “When I have the camera, I feel like I'm not here.” 

I stomped over to her and kneeled down to her level. “Enough,” I replied firmly, “coping like this isn't helping. Whether you're watching behind a screen or not, you're here, and that won't change unless we get our shit together.”

“Yaz and John aren't here and no one's trying to fix anything anymore,” Vanessa wiped snot from her nose, “and we have less people to help without Bryce and Zack, and more people to worry about hiding from, too.” 

“We just need to give Yaz and John some time, okay?” I put a hand on her shoulder and she nodded. “You look tired, why don't you go take a nap and I'll stay up and keep watch?” 

Vanessa wiped dust off the old flowery comforter and lied on her side in the bed, pulling the drawstrings of Bryce's hoodie so that the hood closed tight over her face and only left her nose poking out. She was cold but she didn't want to get under the covers, it seemed, and I didn't blame her. These houses were full of all kinds of bacteria. I decided I would give everyone maybe an hour, and made sure to check my watch. It was 12 AM. 

I looked at the camera in my hands and decided to go through the footage so far. I sat in the corner by the window and made sure the volume was extremely low so that the noise wouldn't disturb Vanessa. 

I had to hold my hand over my mouth to muffle my gasps and squeaks of frights as, at several different intervals during the recording, I saw glimpses of the ghost children hiding just within frame. They went unnoticed by us during the filming which was a hard pill to swallow. How do you not notice a young boy with big gaping hollow sockets staring at you from the corner of the room? How do you not notice an eyeless little girl behind you, running past like she was playing a game of Tag? 

But that wasn't the most disturbing thing I had noticed, not by a long shot. 

The footage reached the time where we frantically entered the room to find Bryce and Zack acting weird. As soon as they came into frame, the footage distorted for a split second with static appearing on screen, then went back to recording like normal.

 That wasn't the worst part though. 

The worst part was, that in the vanity mirror, I noticed something that made all the blood drain from my face. How we hadn't noticed before, I had no clue. 

I rewinded and paused the recording at the right time frame. Zack and Bryce's reflections in the mirror were different from how they looked to us. 

*Their reflections had no eyes.*
