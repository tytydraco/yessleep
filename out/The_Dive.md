***\[Transcript Begins\]***

&#x200B;

**Kelly:** Look, I don’t know what you people are hoping to get out of me. I already told the coast guard that I have nothing more to say, so I really don’t know what you’re expecting to get out of me!

&#x200B;

**Caldwell:** Just looking to clear up a few details regarding what you saw, Mr. Kelly. That’s alright with you, isn’t it?

&#x200B;

**Kelly:** I already gave all the details to the last person who interviewed me. I’ve got nothing more to say!

&#x200B;

**Caldwell:** Humor me. 

&#x200B;

**Kelly:** *\[Pause\]* Whatever… just ask away, I guess. 

&#x200B;

**Caldwell:** Thank you. Why don’t we start with the job? What exactly was it that brought you out to the middle of the ocean?

&#x200B;

**Kelly:** We were supposed to recover a shipment. I’ve… got a few contacts. The kind of contacts who don’t like it when you give out their names, so if it’s all the same to you I’d like to leave all of that as vague as possible. I like my tongue where it is, thank you very much.

&#x200B;

**Caldwell:** Naturally. Given your residence though - I’ll assume they’re Cartel? 

&#x200B;

**Kelly:** Assume what you want. Just assume that I know nothing. 

&#x200B;

**Caldwell:** But you did know the man who hired you, no? Hector Sanchez?

&#x200B;

**Kelly:** *\[Pause\]* I had worked with Sanchez before, yes. Although I don’t remember any of the details of those jobs.

&#x200B;

**Caldwell:** Completely understandable - and I can assure you I’m not interested in any of those jobs. I only want to know about your most recent dive.

&#x200B;

**Kelly:** *\[Sigh\]* Fair enough. Look… Sanchez only contacted me because he knew I could handle it. I’ve been diving for years, and I take any work that I can get and a lot of it *is* above board. There are a lot of inspecting, maintenance and installation jobs my team and I get… *got…*  contracted to do. They weren’t as interesting as the recovery jobs, but they put food on the table. Recovery jobs were always the most interesting though. Ships go down. Cargo gets lost. Someone needs to go and get it. It’s straightforward, but still exciting. Reminds me why I got into diving in the first place.

&#x200B;

**Caldwell:** Oh, I imagine so. They do say that if you do what you love, you’ll never work a day in your life, after all.

&#x200B;

**Kelly:** Sure…

&#x200B;

**Caldwell:** So tell me about this specific job. What can you say about it?

&#x200B;

**Kelly:** Technically nothing… especially not on the record.

&#x200B;

**Caldwell:** Would what you say now really even matter?

&#x200B;

**Kelly:** No… no it wouldn’t. *\[Pause\]* There was a cargo ship that went down, about a week or so ago. Transporting cars. Real luxury makes. Audis, Porsche, Bentleys, stuff like that. Dunno exactly what happened to it and I dunno if anybody made it out alive, but Sanchez had a particular interest in that ship and wasn’t happy to hear it had gone down. 

&#x200B;

**Caldwell:** Can you tell me why?

&#x200B;

**Kelly:** Do I really need to spell it out for you? I can tell you for a fact that he wasn’t interested in the cars! 

&#x200B;

**Caldwell:** Right.

&#x200B;

**Kelly:** I got the impression that someone higher up on the food chain needed what was on that boat. There was a bit of an urgency to the whole thing. Sanchez had told us that we were on a tight schedule, and he did seem a little more antsy than usual. I dunno if you know anything about him, but Sanchez was a big man. Not the kind of man you’d expect to be scared. So if someone had him on edge, then that was someone I really didn’t want to piss off. Still… the money was good. It usually was, and this wasn’t the first time Sanchez had hired us to fix a problem like this. 

&#x200B;

**Caldwell:** Right. So you took the job and left soon after?

&#x200B;

**Kelly:** Yeah. The whole thing was pretty routine. Sanchez gave us the coordinates, and was on the boat with us as we headed out that way. 

&#x200B;

**Caldwell:** Where exactly were the coordinates?

&#x200B;

**Kelly:** I couldn’t tell you off the top of my head… genuinely, I couldn’t tell you. One of my crew, William was the one who did the navigation. He worked with Sanchez on that side of things.

&#x200B;

**Caldwell:** Of course… continue.

&#x200B;

**Kelly:** Right… well, there wasn’t really anything about this job that smelled particularly fishy. Even the coordinates he gave us, there didn’t seem to be anything out of the ordinary there. It just looked like any other barren stretch of the Atlantic. I figured we’d dive down, find the wreck, mark it and start the extraction… which was exactly what we did at first. Although… well…

&#x200B;

**Caldwell:** What?

&#x200B;

**Kelly:** Once we got down there and started our descent, it quickly became obvious that the cargo ship wasn’t the only wreck down there. I had about six people on my crew, and as a rule, two to three of us would go down to scout the wreck so we could mark it, that way we could position the ship a little better so we could streamline the process a little bit. Less time diving down to find the wreck, and making sure that the ship was close enough to spot and retrieve the lifting bags that we’d be sending to the surface.

&#x200B;

This time, I took Chastain and Meyers. They were good people… probably too good to be caught up in what we were doing… Anyway, usually, it’s pretty straightforward… but this time… God, it was a fucking graveyard down there. Not just other cargo ships, although I think I did still see a few, but older wrecks. World War II, maybe? Hard to say for sure. Then, scattered between the sunken steel wrecks were even older ships. Wooden ships, from God only knows how long ago. 

&#x200B;

Some of them even still had standing masts, like something out of a movie, although most were just rotting wood, and a few of them littered the seafloor like festering skeletons, with nothing left but rotten wooden ribs exposed where everything else had long since rotted away, although I could see a few old anchors and maybe even a canon or two buried in the dirt of the seafloor. Once I saw it, I couldn’t look away. I lost count of exactly how many there were… too many to count. But God, the payday I could’ve had from just *one* of those ships!

&#x200B;

**Caldwell:** I’m sure… 

&#x200B;

**Kelly:** In the end we did find the one we were looking for. Although with the other wrecks down there, it took us longer than intended. We had to surface once, just to report on what we’d found, and when we did Sanchez had snapped at us to stay focused. I thought I saw that familiar glint of greed in his eye, though… it was hard to miss. Anyway, we went back down. Started looking for the cargo ship and after a while, we found it and were finally able to mark it. 

&#x200B;

Although as we were marking it, that’s when I noticed that Meyers wasn’t there anymore. I didn’t see what had happened to him. I’d signaled to Chastain, although he didn’t seem to notice Meyers had disappeared yet. Not until he looked around. We’d figured he’d wandered off. Got caught up looking at the wrecks. I couldn’t blame him much. He probably had the same dollar signs in his eyes that we had. But we had a job to do. So I signaled for Chastain to look for him while I started to explore the ship. I wanted to see if I could get access to the cargo hold so we could start searching the cars, and start our extraction.

&#x200B;

**Caldwell:** So Chastain went off on his own?

&#x200B;

**Kelly:** I assumed he’d find Meyers, and they’d be right back with me! It only took about ten or so minutes before I realized that something was wrong. When he and Meyers didn’t come back, I started to get spooked. There *is* a reason we do a lot of under the table contract work like this… diving is a risky endeavor. There’s a *very* good reason that scuba isn’t typically authorized for salvage work, so if you’re hiring a team of divers to recover something for you, you must want it *really* badly. And a job like this was extremely fucking risky. I was worried something had happened to them. They could’ve gotten snared on something, they could’ve gotten trapped, their equipment could’ve been damaged. There’s a list of things that could’ve gone wrong.

&#x200B;

**Caldwell:** Animal attack…?

&#x200B;

**Kelly:** Possible, but not something that immediately crossed my mind. Anyway, once I realized they were missing, I started looking for some trace of them… and it didn’t take me long to notice the blood. A fucking cloud of it, drifting lazily through the water. Just blood… no sign of Meyers or Chastain. No sign of any animals either, although I still got closer to try and investigate. I guess I was hoping I’d either find one of them wounded, or dead… I know how morbid that sounds, but then maybe I would’ve been able to understand where the blood had come from. But there was nothing. No bodies… nothing… just… nothing… and while I was in that cloud of blood, that’s when I noticed it.

&#x200B;

**Caldwell:** What?

&#x200B;

**Kelly:** I… I don’t really know how to describe it. *Something* moving from the depths. But I don’t know what. I only caught a brief glimpse of it in the low light. I don’t know if what I saw was that thing in its entirety, or just a part of it. But it was big and it was moving toward the ship. I could see it… the ship, that is. They’d been moving to get closer to our position. I could see the bottom of the boat on the surface of the water… and I could see whatever it was shooting toward it, before hitting it with what I can only describe as *blinding* speed. 

&#x200B;

I watched the boat *break…* do you understand me? *BREAK!* Let me clarify that my boat wasn’t some fucking pleasure cruise yacht, but this *thing* snapped it like a goddamn twig! And it was just so fast I… I didn’t even have time to process what had happened until my boat was already starting to sink into the depths with the rest of them… and all I could do was watch. All I could do was just float there amongst the blood, watching as countless pincers and claws… pincers and claws that seemed almost impossible in their size, reached up to welcome the wreckage of my boat to the graveyard. I could see shapes trying to swim out of the wreckage. 

&#x200B;

I think I might’ve recognized one of them as Sanchez… but they didn’t make it far. Those pincers dragged them into the depths with such force that pieces of them were torn off by the water rushing past their bodies, floating for only a moment before another set of pincers grabbed them too, leaving only trails of blood behind. It had to have been a quick death… but that didn’t make it any less horrifying. As soon as I knew they were dead, I just floated there in silence. The only good thing about being underwater at that moment was the fact that I wasn’t able to start screaming… 

&#x200B;

**Caldwell:** Mmhm… interesting. I have to ask, do you believe there was only one creature there, or several?

&#x200B;

**Kelly:** What?

&#x200B;

**Caldwell:** Do you believe that there was only one creature there, or several? It’s a very simple question.

&#x200B;

**Kelly:** I don’t… I don’t know? Several? There were so many reaching claws… they couldn’t have all belonged to one thing. But I never got a good look at exactly what those claws were attached to. 

&#x200B;

**Caldwell:** That’s fine… may I ask how you made it back to the surface?

&#x200B;

**Kelly:** Very fucking slowly. After the initial shock had worn off, I started to ascend. I took it slow, and kept glancing down, waiting for something to reach up from the depths and pull me down… but nothing came. I don’t know if it was just blind luck, or if I was moving too slowly for them to notice me. Either way, once I made it to the surface, I tried to put as much distance between myself and that graveyard as possible… I’m not sure how far I got, but I didn’t stop swimming until my body completely gave out… and after that I just floated there for the longest time, until that fishing boat picked me up. 

&#x200B;

**Caldwell:** Right… you said you’d marked the wreckage, yes? Would whatever you used to mark it still be trackable?

&#x200B;

**Kelly:** I… yes. It was a GPS marker. We used those, just in case we had to leave and come back. Although I can promise you I’m not fucking going back out on the open water!

&#x200B;

**Caldwell:** No, that won’t be necessary... I can find it on my own.
