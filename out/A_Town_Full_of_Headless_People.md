There were four of us, heading back home from another town after attending one of our friends' weddings. It was a fun trip until we got kind of lost because it was our first time passing through that road.

We planned to stop for a while to ask for directions from the people in the neighborhood, but during the ride, we hadn’t seen anyone yet.

It was a small-town road, and it was quiet. We barely saw any other vehicles passing by, no matter what kind.

Then, we encountered a road sign with a town’s name written on it.

“What do you guys think about stopping by? It’s getting dark,” Morgan, who was driving, asked us. “I don’t mind driving through the night, but we need food. And a little rest.”

“Oh, I agree,” Elsa responded.

Morgan turned the wheel toward the town. It was quite a long journey from the highway until we finally saw the town’s houses. Strangely enough, the closer we got to the town, the quieter and eerier it felt.

“This town seems empty,” Amelia muttered. “Is it abandoned? We won’t find any place to rest here, let alone food.”

“Should we try knocking on a door or two?” I asked. “We could try. We’re here anyway.”

“It wouldn’t hurt to try,” Morgan responded. “Like you said, Danny, we’re here anyway.”

Morgan stopped in front of a house, and I hopped out of the car.

I looked around.

The town sure felt creepy and eerie, for whatever reason.

Something urged me to get things done as soon as possible. I immediately walked toward the house Morgan had stopped in front of.

I knocked on the door once. No response.

I knocked again, twice. Still no response.

“Excuse me? Is anyone around?” I called out. As I accidentally pulled the doorknob, I saw it creak open.

“Excuse me?” I called out again, peeking inside the house. I knew it was rude, but the door accidentally opened.

Yet, still, no response.

I was about to give up, close the door, and return to the car when I noticed something. As I opened the door wider, I saw a framed picture of a family of four hanging on the wall, right across from where I stood.

Intrigued by what I saw, I subconsciously walked inside the house.

“Danny, what the hell, man? Don’t just walk inside!” I heard Elsa shout from the car.

But my eyes were fixated on the framed picture. I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me. But they weren’t.

“Danny! Danny! Dude, come on out! What are you doing? If the homeowner catches you, we’ll be in deep trouble!” Morgan called out, panicking. He jumped out of the car, followed by Elsa and Amelia, trying to pull me back outside.

“Guys,” I said to them, “is it just me, or do you see that too?”

I pointed toward the framed picture hanging on the wall, just a few meters from where we stood.

The picture showed a family portrait of five members. It looked like the mother, the father, an adult child, a son or daughter-in-law, and a baby girl.

All five of them wore dresses and tuxedos, but something was strange about the picture.

All five family members were headless.

It wasn’t like the picture was cropped at the neck. We could see the tips of their necks, but no heads were visible.

None.

“What the fuck is that?” Morgan muttered.

“Is that some kind of inside joke?” Amelia wondered.

“Could be,” I replied, “but that would be cruel and inappropriate, wouldn’t it? Especially to cut off the baby girl’s head in the picture too?”

“We better get out,” Morgan said.

And we did.

We jumped back in the car and continued down the town’s road, hoping to find someone to ask for help or at least a store to buy food from.

Along the road, we passed by quite a few pictures with people in them.

We saw an election billboard with the name Clayton written on it and a picture of someone wearing a shirt and tie. We could see the tip of the man’s neck, but there was no head on top of it.

We saw advertising posters, housing commercials, and many other images featuring people, but none had heads attached to their necks.

All of those people were headless.

“What is this place?” Amelia muttered.

“Morgan, watch out!” Elsa screamed in panic, pointing toward the road. There, right in front of our car, was a dog crossing the street.

The dog didn’t have a head on top of its neck.

But it walked across the road as if nothing was wrong.

Then, we saw a house nearby with its door creaking open. Someone walked out wearing pajamas.

But there was no head on their neck.

Seconds later, another door opened, then another, and another. One by one, the people of the town walked out of their houses into the middle of the road, right in front of our car.

There were about twenty-something people standing before us.

None of them had heads.

They were all headless.

All of them.

“Morgan!” I shouted in horror.

Those headless people stood before our car, blocking our path. Morgan quickly turned the wheel around, heading back the way we came from. He floored the gas pedal, pushing the car to its top speed.

No one seemed to get in the way as we drove full speed back to the highway. It should have been a good sign.

But it wasn’t.

The town’s road was a single, long road. If we turned around, there was no way we could get lost. Yet there we were, sitting in the car, horrified as we stared at the road ahead that was now gone.

What was supposed to be the road leading back to the highway was now a dead end with a deep forest in sight.

“Did we miss an intersection?” Morgan asked.

“There wasn’t even an intersection!” Elsa replied, terrified.

“We came into the town from this one-way road,” I said. “Now the road is gone. How the hell did that happen?”

We all turned around to see countless headless inhabitants blocking our way back.

Meanwhile, in front of our car, the forest's edge seemed to be getting closer, as if it were expanding and shortening the road to the town.

“What choice do we have?” Amelia asked.

“I can still see a road back there,” Morgan responded. “We turn around and charge full speed.”

“Hitting them in the process?” Elsa asked.

“Well, they don’t seem human to me. So...,” I said.

“Exactly,” Morgan agreed as he once again turned the car around and slammed the gas pedal, driving toward the headless inhabitants.

But none of them flinched.

Morgan didn’t seem to care. He hit anyone who got in his way. Through the side window, I saw red liquid splatter as Morgan crashed into them.

“What is that red stuff? Blood?” I muttered.

“So, they’re human?” Elsa asked.

“I don’t know. I don’t care,” Morgan said, keeping a straight face as he sped through the town’s eerie road.

We could still see the headless inhabitants running toward the car, trying to get in the way. But Morgan didn’t care enough to stop. He pushed through.

Some of the headless inhabitants clung to the car, trying to break the windows and grab anyone inside. Thankfully, Morgan was a great driver. He swerved, he charged, he did everything he could until they finally let go of the car.

Along the road, we saw a number of posters and photos. All of them featured people, but none of them had heads.

We didn’t know how long we had been driving, but eventually, we saw something that looked like a gate in front of us.

I looked back and saw the headless inhabitants still chasing us.

However, the moment Morgan drove past the gate, all of the inhabitants who had been relentlessly pursuing us abruptly stopped.

All of them stood still right behind the gate.

I looked closely and realized that not a single one of them stepped outside the gate.

It was as if something was preventing them from walking past it.

Whatever it was, we were just glad to be safe. None of us were hurt. It was all over.

Or so we thought.

About a week later, we gathered at our regular coffee shop. Morgan, Amelia, and I were there, waiting for Elsa.

Amelia talked about her blog, where she shared our story about a town full of headless people.

"Guess what, guys? One comment stood out," Amelia said.

"This guy said," Amelia continued, "that he heard an urban legend about a town full of headless people. He didn’t say much, except that, according to him, the town is inhabited by humans practicing dark magic or witchcraft that lets them live for eternity."

Amelia took a sip of her tea.

"In exchange for their heads," she concluded.

"So, they’re okay with having no heads as long as they live forever? Insanity!" I exclaimed, feeling both angry and confused.

"Is that also why they didn’t step past the gate?" Morgan asked. "It’s their border. Once they step outside, they’re as good as dead."

"Oh, yeah," Amelia replied. "The guy said that too. And he mentioned that he was grateful we made it out alive. According to him, the legend says that whoever enters the town never leaves alive."

"And yet, here we are, sipping coffee," I said, taking a sip. "And tea," I added, nodding at Amelia.

"Where’s Elsa, by the way?" Morgan asked.

"I’ve called her several times, but she hasn’t picked up," Amelia replied.

"Why don’t we go check on her?" Morgan suggested.

We paid for our drinks and headed to Elsa’s apartment.

Upon arrival, we knocked on her door, but no one answered. We called her phone again. No response.

But we could hear her phone ringing from inside the apartment.

"Wait, I still have her spare key from when I stayed over after losing mine for a few days," Amelia said, pulling a key out of her purse and unlocking the door.

"Elsa? You here? We heard your phone ringing," Morgan called out as we entered.

We searched every room, but there was no sign of her. Then, we heard Amelia screaming from the bedroom. Morgan and I rushed over.

What we saw was beyond explanation.

Elsa’s body lay lifeless on her bed.

Without her head.

We gathered the courage to get closer and saw something strange. The tip of her neck was clean and smooth as if it had been like that for so long that new skin had formed.

Or worse, it looked like Elsa never had a head to begin with.

"Are you sure this is Elsa? She looks like...," I hesitated to continue.

"She looks like the inhabitants of that town we encountered a week ago," Morgan finished my sentence.

He pulled down her shirt collar, revealing a tattoo on her shoulder. It was her name, written in cursive: Elsa.

"Looks like her," Morgan confirmed.

We examined her body closely. There were no scars, no wounds, no blood.

We looked around her room. No blood.

Nothing. Not at all.

If someone had cut her head off, there would have been blood everywhere.

"Do you see her head anywhere?" I asked Morgan. We looked around, feeling sick at the thought of someone hiding her head somewhere as a twisted joke.

"GUYS!" Amelia screamed from outside the bedroom.

We ran to her as fast as we could. Amelia was pointing out the window.

Elsa’s apartment was on the ground floor, facing a small city forest across the street.

Amid the trees, three figures stood, almost hidden by the shadows.

None of them had heads on top of their necks.

One of them held something in its hand. Slowly, it lifted the object so we could see it clearly.

It was a head.

Elsa’s head.

None of the three creatures had heads, but somehow, I could see a smirk.

It was as if they were telling us...

"You’re next."
