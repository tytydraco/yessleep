Real messenger 2nd encounter

Real Messengers

I grew up living in a 2 bedroom board house and a small kitchen attached with a passageway leading to the kitchen. It’s not one of those nice board houses,as we grew up poor, it was one where you can stay from outside and look inside ( vice versa). At some parts inside like where the beds were we would nail cardboard boxes so one can’t look in on us sleeping on the beds.  

I along with my 6 brothers and sisters. My mother had 7 children. 
We lived in rural Jamaica. 

I remembered I was about 15 or 16 yrs old at the time I am now 33yrs of age. The doors couldn’t close properly cause our mother couldn’t afford to buy a proper lock so she had some made out of small pieces of wood. One that is held up by a single nail and you would just turn it left or right to lock the door and to open it. 

One night I was sleeping at around 2:30 am, it’s like I was half asleep and half awake, I could hear a voice as if someone was calling me, it called me by my name 3 times harshly as if they were in quite a rush to get my attention (Pam,Pam,Pam) not my real name. it was the rough voice that of a man. In my half asleep,half awake state I somehow looked up to where the voice was calling me from. 

There in the middle of the small kitchen I saw a man, he was tall, slim and dark. He was wearing a 3 piece black jacket suit with the shirt being red and his head was bald. The thing is there was boards parting the room and the kitchen as there was a passage as I said before. But at that time in my current state I didn’t see any boards I saw straight into the kitchen. (I had never seen this person before)

After looking up he said to me “didn’t you hear me calling you“? In a tone that was not harsh but hastily. 
I answered and said “yes I heard you but I was looking who was calling me first “ ( note that I had never seen this man ever in my entire life) . He then said “get up now and come and close the kitchen door” as he said that he turned around and walked through the kitchen door and leave.

 I immediately woke up and went around to the kitchen, there I saw that the kitchen door was wide open that’s I was looking straight outside into darkness.

 I closed the door and placed a 5gl water bottle filled with water behind the door. 

I then went to the other room and woke my mother up and told her. She got up and checked all the other doors but thy were all closed. She proceeded to check on all of my brothers and sisters to see if everyone was present inside the house. 

I had many encounters with the supernatural. I’ll tell you about the big cat in my next real lives stories.
