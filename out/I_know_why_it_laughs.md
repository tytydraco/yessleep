I’ve been living in my childhood home for three weeks now. Mom passed in February, Dad two years before that, and the house became mine by default. I’m 34, divorced, and couldn’t afford my apartment anymore anyway. Moving back felt like failure, but at least it was free failure.

The house remembers everything.

I noticed it before the laughter started. Little things. The way the third stair still creaked in the exact spot where I used to step when sneaking downstairs for midnight snacks. How the afternoon light through my bedroom window still made that same triangle on the wall, the one I used to pretend was a mountain I could climb into. The house held all of it, patient as a photograph.

The laughter started on the fourth night.

I was scrolling through my phone in bed when I heard it. Soft, muffled, coming from directly beneath me. A child’s giggle, the kind that bubbles up when they’re trying not to laugh but can’t help it. The kind that sounds like pure light.

I froze. The giggling continued for maybe ten more seconds. Not malicious. Not threatening. Just… there. Like someone had pressed play on a recording I didn’t know existed.

I grabbed my phone’s flashlight and checked under the bed. Nothing but dust bunnies and a box of my old baseball cards I’d forgotten existed. The Tony Gwynn rookie card was still on top, exactly where eight-year-old me had left it.

The next evening, it happened again. 11:47 PM. That same stifled giggling, like a kid with their hand over their mouth, shoulders shaking with contained joy. This time I was ready. I rolled off the bed and dropped to the floor, shining my light underneath.

The laughter stopped immediately. But in that split second before it did, I could have sworn I saw something. Not a shape or a figure. More like… an impression. The way air shimmers over hot pavement.

By the seventh night, I’d tried everything. Removed everything from under the bed. Set up my phone to record. Even spent one night sleeping on the couch. The laughter still came from upstairs, from my empty room, at 11:47 PM exactly. The recording only picked up the faintest sound, like whispers of air forming words in a language I’d forgotten how to speak.

I started leaving work earlier. Telling myself it was to beat traffic, but really I was being pulled back. The house wanted me there. Needed me to hear something.

Night ten, the laughter was clearer. It was definitely a boy, maybe seven or eight years old. There was something achingly familiar about it, like a song you know but can’t place. I found myself leaning over the edge of the bed, listening. Not afraid anymore. Just… lost.

That’s when other things started coming back.

Not memories exactly. More like muscle memory. I’d catch myself sitting cross-legged on the floor without meaning to, the way I used to when building Legos. I bought cereal I hadn’t eaten in twenty years. Started unconsciously tracing patterns on my desk that turned out to be the same doodles that still marked my childhood homework.

Night fifteen, I recognized the laugh.

I was sitting on the edge of my bed when it started. 11:47, reliable as gravity. But this time, instead of fear, I felt something crack in my chest. A fissure in whatever shell I’d built around myself.

I knew that exact laugh. I knew when I’d laughed it.

The night before my ninth birthday. Mom and Dad had hidden my present under the bed. A remote control car I’d been begging for. I’d snuck out of bed to investigate and found it, wrapped in silver paper that caught the moonlight. I remember pressing my hand over my mouth, trying so hard not to wake anyone, but the joy just bubbled out anyway. Unstoppable. Pure.

The laughter under my bed was mine. From twenty-five years ago.

After that, I started recognizing all of them. Each night brought a different laugh, a different moment. The night I’d successfully prank-called my sister from the landline in this very room. The time Jake slept over and we’d told ghost stories until we scared ourselves into hysterics. The afternoon I’d beaten Super Mario World for the first time. My first kiss with Sarah Chen in eighth grade, and how I’d come home and flopped on this bed, giddy and dizzy and alive.

The house had been recording everything. Every moment of joy, every burst of genuine happiness, caught in the grain of the wood, in the spaces between walls. A library of who I used to be.

I stopped trying to sleep through it. Started waiting for 11:47. Sometimes I’d lie on the floor, ear pressed to the hardwood, listening to my younger self discover the world was magic. Other times I’d sit at my old desk, running my fingers over those carved doodles, trying to remember what it felt like to have that much hope.

Three weeks in, and I finally understood.

The house wasn’t haunted. It was trying to haunt me back to life.

Because somewhere between that ninth birthday and my thirty-fourth, I’d stopped. Stopped laughing like that. Stopped feeling like that. I’d learned to moderate my joy, package it in acceptable doses. Professional. Appropriate. Adult.

I’d learned to live quietly. To want quietly. To fail quietly.

Tonight, as I write this, it’s 11:46. One minute until the laughter comes. I’ve been thinking about something.

Last week, my cousin brought her kid over to help me sort through Mom’s things. Six years old, gap-toothed, obsessed with dinosaurs. At some point, he discovered the echo in the empty dining room and spent twenty minutes just shouting “HELLO” and giggling at the response. Pure delight at something so simple.

I watched him and felt this crushing weight, because I realized I was looking at him the way you’d look at an extinct species. Like joy that pure couldn’t possibly exist in the same world as mortgage payments and performance reviews and divorce papers.

But it did. He was proof.

11:47 now. There it is. Tonight’s laugh is from Christmas morning, 1998. The year I got a chemistry set and immediately tried to make a potion that would let me talk to dogs. I can hear it all in that laugh. The absolute certainty that anything was possible. That the world was built for discovering. That I was exactly who I was supposed to be.

The laughter under my bed isn’t trying to scare me.

It’s trying to tell me I’m still here. Still that kid. Still capable of that kind of joy.

The house remembers who I am, even when I don’t.

I’ve started laughing back. Quietly at first, just a chuckle in response. But last night, when I heard my ten-year-old self laughing at a joke I’d completely forgotten, I found myself really laughing. Laughing until my stomach hurt. Laughing like I was trying to shake something loose.

My neighbor probably thinks I’m losing it. Maybe I am.

Or maybe I’m finding it.

The laughter under my bed comes every night at 11:47. It’ll probably keep coming. And I’ll keep listening, keep remembering, keep trying to find my way back to whoever that kid was. The one who knew that houses could hold memories, that joy could soak into walls, that laughter could echo across decades if you just knew how to listen.

The house remembers everything.

Maybe it’s time I did too.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
