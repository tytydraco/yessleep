[I don't have a dog : r/nosleep](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pj5p1h/i_dont_have_a_dog/)

When I got over the initial shock of my discovery I helped myself to a can of beer from the small store’s fridge. I downed the whole thing and felt my heart stop trying to beat its way out of my body. With as much composure as I could manage I considered my situation. There was something in my apartment, a monster and it had convinced me that it was a dog that I did not have. Not just that, my interactions with other residents of our little isolated tower block implied that more of these dopplegangers had already ingratiated themselves in the community. While considering my options my manager, Mr. Lin, returned from his lunch break. The sour little man was grinning and was holding hands with a tall and beautiful dark haired woman. A flicker of uncertainty about her identity was quickly squashed by an overwhelming sense of familiarity. 

“Hi Mrs. Lin.” I said. The sight of the woman flooded me with warm memories of her preparing me authentic Chinese food during my weekly visits to the Lin's apartment. She nodded at me and smiled kindly before picking up a basket and making her way around the store floor. Mr. Lin accompanied her and helped fill the basket before they finished up and made their way to the till where I stood. It was a strange assortment of household goods. Three bottles of bleach, a lot of baking powder and bars of soap. Mr. Lin paid for the items and then Mrs. Lin departed after giving him a kiss on the cheek. I watched the woman leave and get into the elevator. The moment she was out of direct eyeline the strange veil dropped from my mind. That had not been a human being.

Mr. Lin’s uncharacteristic good mood proved essential as when I complained of fake stomach issues he sent me home without further inquiry and even wished me well. That act alone confirmed to me that there was something deeply wrong going on here. Instead of hitting the button for my own floor I pressed the one for floor 3. This was the busiest level as it contained the Doctor’s Office, Gymnasium, Post Office and most importantly the Police Office. I passed a handful of people who I recognized. Our entire community was contained within the one building after all. How many of those familiar faces were just masks? 

I entered the Police Office to find Larry lounging with his booted feet propped up on his desk chuckling to himself at the small TV screen mounted on the wall opposite. Invasion of the Body Snatchers was playing. Larry did not bother comporting himself more professionally for my sake.

“How dumb do you need to be to think your friend ain’t an alien?” Larry said, taking a loud sip from his coffee mug.

“The normal level I expect.” I replied.

The staff toilet door clicked open and out stepped Amy. She was short and stocky but took no nonsense from anyone in the tower block. There was a sensitivity to her that shone in tough situations too like the blizzard last year. Amy nodded and smiled a greeting at me.

“What can we do for young man?” Larry asked but not taking his attention from the screen. He did look at me after I explained the situation. “You been drinking?”

“No. Well just one to calm my nerves.” I replied.

Larry’s face was hard to read thanks to his bushy beard and thick eyebrows. His face scrunched up as though he was trying to force his brain to do hard mathematics.

“Yeah you ain’t got no damn dog. Let’s go check it out.” 

I sighed with relief as Larry got to his feet and double-checked his sidearm.

Amy whistled the X files theme song as we ascended in the elevator until Larry told her to knock it off. I found it funny and the presence of two officers of the law who were armed made me feel much more relaxed. Everything was going to be fine. I unlocked my apartment door and let the officers head in first while I waited outside. Old lady Innes passed by on her wheelchair and grumbled something but did not talk to me. From inside my apartment I could hear the TV playing but no other noises. Five minutes passed before I called out and did not get a reply. My animal instinct told me to run as far away as possible but the human in me wanted some answers. I stuck my head into the flat and wished to God I would obey the animal side of me going forward. Illuminated by the ever changing colour and intensity of the TV from the open living room stood the scene in my hallway. Larry was in the middle standing as if frozen in place with his mouth open and his eyes rolled all the way back. To his left, standing upright, was a big white goldendoodle with its maw extended far too wide and a pink tendril protruding. That alien tendril went from the thing’s mouth into Larry’s ear. To the poor man’s right stood Amy with her own mouth open too wide and a pink tendril of her own piercing her colleague’s other ear. A quiet whimper escaped me but the things seemed far too occupied on whatever the fuck they were doing to Larry to notice me. I backed away and walked slowly to the elevator before hitting the button a hundred times to escape my floor.

I went back to store and assured Mr. Lin I felt much better. I have no idea what to do next. Pretend I’m none the wiser? Those things are everywhere and if I look at them they will just make me think we are best buddies before luring me off to drain my brain juice of whatever the fuck they did to Larry. What the hell should I do?
