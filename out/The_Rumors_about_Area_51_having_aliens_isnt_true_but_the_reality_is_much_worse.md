Hello, I will call myself Remedy for the sakes of staying anonymous, if the government finds out who I am, I will be arrested. I'm a Sergeant Major for the U.S Army and I live somewhere in California (again for staying anonymous). I joined the military in early 2002 a couple of months after 9/11. I signed up for my 18th birthday because it affected me hard. I was born and raised in Albany, NY. My uncle was a business man who worked and lived in Manhattan. he had meetings and such on September 8-13, 2001. My uncle was inside the North Tower for what was supposed to be 7:45-9:45 on the day. The North Tower was hit and fortunately my uncle was on 29th floor and was able to escape. So this obviously hit a little bit close to home. Anyway, I went through boot camp which was torture but I lived so I'm not complaining. I was officially a soldier in the army and I was proud.

 I went on my first combat deployment in 2003 to Iraq for 9 months. I saw some pretty messed up stuff, including the spiders (if you know, you know). Met a good amount of guys, got in a bit of gun fights, played a couple of pranks, all the stuff. When I came back I was psyched because then I would  get a veteran's discount lol. 

Just under a year later I was sent to Afghanistan for a year as my 2nd deployment. Met a cool guy named Tyson and me and him kicked it from the start. hung out with him a bunch and as much as I could. On a standard issue patrol around base, we got in a gunfight with a few Taliban fighters. Most shots were misses (of course). One of our guys shot one of them and the other 2 got scared and ran. we called out names to check everyone was ok. When we called for Tyson, their was no response. We looked and we saw him with a gunshot to his head. This gave me Severe PTSD. Went on another deployment to Afghanistan again and I was shot in my leg driving around a secluded village. This caused permanent damage to the nerve receptors in my leg which put me on reserves.

Now this is where the real story begins. After several years of going on short deployments to bases around the U.S, I finally was deployed to Area 51. I thought this was going to be the coolest thing ever.  And maybe I would see aliens lol.

 I was deployed as a guard for the armory room, meeting room, surveillance room, and mess hall. I would also be the surveillance guy and sit there and watch the CCTV camera's around the base. So I got to see a lot of stuff. Rumor was on the base for non-high-rankers is there is a secret hidden "alien" room several hundred feet underground. They had CCTV camera's there, but the low-rankers didn't have access to see them. One day when I was guarding the outside of the meeting room, I overheard some severely disturbing information. One man said something along the lines of, "I've called you all here to discuss the matter of the new anti-gravity subject we have found in the depths of the earth" (Technically not an alien). I was in utter disbelief, horrified. I went to sleep that night... well I tried, it was kind of hard after hearing what I heard. I didn't say a word to a single soul. 

The next week the alarms went off, I thought it was a test because they test them every now and then.  But this time, you could tell it wasn't. There was a strange noise coming from outside the hall of the surveillance room... where I was.. I looked outside the window and saw this animal-- rather monster... I thought it was an alien at first, but thinking back to the meeting I overheard, I thought it was the anti-gravity monster they had talked about. A high ranking agent came to talk to me the day of. He told me everything, but specifically not to tell a soul.. He told me the thing I saw was a unharmful species found in Antarctica by American Scientists working for the CIA. It looked like a human, but taller, thinner, and a strange face. The mouth was just a small hole and its eyes seemed like they gaped deep, deep into its head. It was grabbing onto a door handle to the closet with its long, sharp hand. The PTSD I mention prior, was just intensified. This whole event gave me trust issues and even worse PTSD. 

After going home from deployment, I resigned from the Army, I tried to focus on starting a family. I now have a wife and 2 kids with a nice house in suburban California. Life still doesn't really feel the same, I don't know if anything has changed but it all feels like a simulation. It's hard to describe the feeling I fell, but I'm sure I'm not alone.
