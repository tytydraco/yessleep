I’m not dramatic, and I don’t believe in paranormal stuff. But everyone I’ve told this to refuses to talk about it, and I’m starting to feel like I’m losing my mind.

So I’m writing it here.

My great-grandmother, my Mimi, lives deep in Appalachia. The kind of place where the roads narrow until your headlights barely fit between the trees. I grew up visiting her, and yeah, I’ve heard the stories. Walkers. Things that wear people wrong. I never believed any of it because nothing had ever happened to me.

Until last week.

I visit Mimi once a week. The drive’s about an hour, mostly through mountains. I like driving at night, podcasts on low, windows cracked, trees blurring together. This time I stayed the night for the first time in years. Everything felt normal. Peaceful, even.

The next morning, I decided to walk behind her house.

There’s a patch of woods there. Not huge, but dense. I used to explore it as a kid. I didn’t plan to go far, just enough to feel nostalgic.

That’s when the silence started.

Not quiet like “early morning.” Quiet like something hit a mute button. No birds. No bugs. No wind. The air felt thick, like it was pressing in on me.

Then I heard a sound.

Slow. Wet. Creaking.

Not trees. Not branches. It sounded like joints, like bones shifting under too much weight. Each sound came closer than the last.

And then the smell hit me.

Rotten. Metallic. So strong it burned my nose. I’ve smelled dead animals before. This wasn’t that. This smelled intentional.

I turned to leave.

I stepped left, and saw it.

My brain tried to call it a man. That’s the closest word I have. But nothing about it was right. Its arms hung too low. Its legs bent the wrong way. Its neck was stretched far longer than it should’ve been, like someone pulled it upward and forgot to stop.

No clothes. No hair. Skin pulled tight and pale, like it didn’t belong on what it was covering.

I couldn’t move. I couldn’t even breathe properly. I just stared.

It wasn’t looking at me.

Then I took a step back and kicked a rock.

Its neck snapped around.

I don’t mean turned. I mean snapped—fast and wrong, like twisting something that shouldn’t twist. It rose up, unfolding until it stood at least eight feet tall, and tilted its head like it was curious.

Then it screamed.

The sound didn’t come from its mouth. It felt like it came from everywhere at once high, piercing, vibrating inside my skull.

I don’t remember running.

The next thing I knew, I was standing in Mimi’s kitchen, shaking so hard my teeth hurt.

When I told her what I saw, she didn’t interrupt me. She didn’t tell me I was imagining things.

She went completely silent.

She packed my bags without asking. Made me tea. Told me I could leave whenever I wanted. She never once said, “That’s not real.”

I drove home in daylight, but I kept checking my mirrors.

No one believes me. My mom, my cousins, everyone says I scared myself. That I was tired. That Appalachia “gets in your head.”

But I keep smelling it.

Sometimes on my drive. Sometimes outside my apartment. Once, inside my bedroom.

I don’t sleep much anymore. And when everything goes quiet, no cars, no wind, I swear I hear that scream again, just beyond the trees.

I don’t think it stayed in those woods.

And I don’t think my Mimi sent me home to protect me.

How do I protect myself? I’m so lost and I just wanna be able to feel safe in my home
