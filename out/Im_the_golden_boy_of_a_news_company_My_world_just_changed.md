The lights in Studio Three always warmed up slower than the others—old bulbs, aging wiring, or maybe just stubbornness. Tonight, they flickered awake one at a time, washing the room in a soft, amber glow that made everything feel safer than it usually did. Like we weren’t a small local station desperately pretending to be a real network.

“Morning show glamor for an afternoon crew,” I joked as the second row of lights buzzed to life overhead.

“Don’t get used to it, Brightman,” Marty called from the control booth window. “Budget meeting’s next week. We might downgrade to candles.”

I laughed and tugged my tie straight, checking myself in the teleprompter glass. Hair decent. Smile bright. Posture confident.

Bradley Brightman, golden boy of Channel Seven.

At least according to everyone who didn’t look at my paycheck.

“Brad, you want water?” Kim asked as she set a bottle near my chair. “We’ve got a long opener before we bring your guest on.”

“I’m good, thanks.”

She gave me a conspiratorial grin. “Everyone’s curious about her. The whole newsroom’s been whispering.”

I blinked. “Whispering what?”

“You know—mysterious wildlife expert nobody’s heard of, showing up right when the town’s panicking about those animal attacks? Half the station thinks she’s secretly government.”

I rolled my eyes. “We’ve interviewed weirder.”

“Yeah, but this one’s pretty.”

“Kim.”

“What? I’m married. I can still have eyes.”

Before I could answer, the studio doors opened, and Vivienne Hemmings stepped inside.

And the room changed.

Not dramatically—no music sting, no gust of wind—but the casual chatter dipped. The crew’s attention flicked toward her in that half-curious, half-careful way people react when someone too poised walks in.

She wasn’t glamorous or intimidating. Just… composed.

Her dark coat draped neatly over one arm, hair pinned back in a way that seemed effortless but precise. She moved quietly, like she knew exactly where her feet needed to be. Her gaze swept the studio, not nervously, but as if tracking details out of habit.

She didn’t smile at first. She simply nodded to me in greeting.

“Mr. Brightman.”

I stood a little straighter than necessary. “Please—Bradley. Thank you for coming in.”

“I’m glad to help.” Her voice was low, smooth, steady. Something about it made the room feel smaller, like she only spoke to one person at a time. “Where would you like me?”

“Oh—right here,” Kim said, guiding her to the guest seat. “We’ll check your mic.”

Vivienne sat without adjusting anything. Most guests fidgeted, brushed their clothes, cleared throats, or nervously tapped the chair.

Not her.

She sat like she knew how to make a camera fall in love with her posture.

I tried not to stare.

“You’ve done interviews before?” I asked casually.

“Yes.” She folded her hands on her lap. “Though it’s been a while.”

“About the wildlife attacks?”

Her eyes lifted to mine. Calm. “Something like that.”

Before I could ask more, Marty’s voice came through the speakers: “Alright, everyone! Places! We’re live in thirty!”

The crew scurried to positions. Vivienne remained perfectly still as Kim clipped her mic on. I scanned my notes again—not because I needed to, but because Vivienne’s stillness made me feel restless.

“You nervous?” I teased lightly.

“Not particularly.”

“Good. These shows can be—”

“Bradley?” she interrupted softly.

“Yes?”

Her eyes were fixed upward, toward the rafters, where light rigs hung like metal skeletons.

“There’s something… off with your ventilation system,” she murmured.

I blinked. “What?”

She didn’t answer right away. Her eyes stayed on the dark space above us.

Then she blinked and looked back at me. “Nothing. Poor wiring, perhaps.”

She smiled politely.

But it wasn’t a nothing kind of smile.

Before I could think about it more, the floor manager began the countdown.

3…

2…

1…

And we were live.

I slipped into my broadcast voice with ease. “Good afternoon, everyone! I’m Bradley Brightman, and today we have a special guest joining us—wildlife specialist Vivienne Hemmings.”

Vivienne inclined her head, gracious but reserved.

We started the soft questions first—her background, her work cataloging regional animal behavior, her consulting on conservation issues. And she answered normally. Naturally. If anything, she seemed thoughtful.

But every so often, her eyes drifted toward reflective surfaces, polished metal edges, or the narrow, shadowy slits behind equipment. Like she expected something to move there.

I tried to ignore it.

“So,” I said finally, “these animal attacks people are talking about… what’s your take?”

Vivienne interlaced her fingers. “Patterns are unclear. But often, such incidents trace back to misidentified predators or diseased animals.”

She said it with the measured confidence of someone carefully choosing the version of the truth she’d allow.

“Are you alright?” I murmured during a camera-angle transition.

Her jaw tightened so briefly I almost missed it. “You need to be cautious tonight.”

I frowned. “Why?”

She didn’t answer immediately. Her eyes snapped toward the camera as the tally light went off, meaning we were off-air for a commercial.

Then she turned to me, voice low, urgent but controlled.

“Bradley. When the show ends, you go home. Not to a bar, not to dinner, not to a friend’s house. Straight home. Doors locked.”

My blood chilled.

“Why?” I whispered.

“Because,” she said carefully, “you were on its radar before you ever walked in this room. But now—it has your voice. And your face.”

“What does that even mean?”

Her eyes softened a fraction. “I’ll explain. But not here.”

She stood as the crew bustled around us. “I need a word with your producer.”

She strode away, coat swinging behind her, and the second she was gone, an uncomfortable pressure tightened at the base of my skull. Like something had whispered across my mind.

I brushed it off.

Nerves. Stress. Broadcast adrenaline.

When the show wrapped, everyone clapped me on the back again. “Golden boy kills another segment!” “Brightman, you’re smooth as butter, man!”

I played along. I always did.

But my attention drifted constantly to where Vivienne had disappeared into Marty’s office.

When I finally grabbed my stuff and headed for the exit, she was waiting in the hallway.

“You drove?” she asked.

“Yes.”

“Good. Leave now. And don’t stop.”

“Vivienne, I don’t—”

She stepped close enough that her voice didn’t carry. “Please, Bradley. I can’t force you to listen. But I’m asking you.”

Her expression—steady, sharp—wasn’t fear.

It was a calculation.

Something had made the hunter in her show.

I nodded weakly. “Okay.”

As soon as I stepped into the parking lot, the air felt wrong. Heavier. Still.

I scanned the lot.

Nothing.

Just shadows stretching under flickering lamps.

I exhaled.

Paranoia.

I climbed into my car, shut the door, locked it, and—

Something shifted across the lot.

A figure.

No—an outline.

Too tall. Too straight. Too still.

It tilted its head in a stiff, clicking motion.

The voice that came out wasn’t human. It tried to be.

“Braaaad… leeee… Bright… man…”

My veins turned to ice.

I floored the gas.

By the time I reached my house, my hands wouldn’t stop shaking. I shut the door, locked it twice, and paced in frantic circles.

“You’re tired,” I whispered to myself. “You imagined it. People don’t talk like that.”

Then—

Scrape.

A deliberate drag of something sharp against the living room window.

I froze.

Scrape… scrape… scrape.

I stepped toward the curtain, barely breathing.

“Don’t look,” I whispered—but I did.

At first, nothing.

Then something slowly rose into view.

A face—or a sculpted suggestion of one—pushing up from below the frame. Skin stretched too thin, eyes two wet pits, mouth hanging slack like someone forgot how it was supposed to work.

“Braaaad-leeeee…”

My throat closed.

I ran.

Keys slipping, feet tangling, heart battering my ribs like it wanted out.

I made it down the porch steps before a violent crash rocked the siding of my house. Something too big and too wrong moved between the hedges.

A tall, jerking shape.

It lunged.

And slammed into me with a force that detonated pain across my ribs. The breath tore out of me in a sharp, ugly sound. My shoulder hit the concrete so hard my vision blurred white. A second impact—its weight—pressed into my side, grinding bone against the ground until my arm went numb.

I tried to push it off, but my muscles wouldn’t cooperate. Something warm trickled down my forearm where it had raked across me, not enough to bleed out but enough to burn.

Its voice crackled inches from my ear: “Brad… leee… Brad… leee…”

A gunshot split the night.

The creature jerked violently, giving me just enough room to pull my arm free. The movement sent another spike of pain through my ribs, sharp enough to make my knees buckle when I tried to stand.

“BRADLEY! STAY DOWN!”

Vivienne.

She moved with terrifying precision, firing again—once into its chest, once upward toward its collapsing jawline. The thing convulsed, limbs bending in ways that made my stomach twist.

Then it dragged itself backward into the dark, melting away like a shadow breaking apart.

Gone.

Vivienne grabbed my arm. I winced as pressure hit the bruised ribs. “Inside,” she ordered.

I staggered with her onto the porch, legs trembling, each breath pinched and shallow.

“What—what was that?”

“A diseased coyote,” she said quickly. Too quickly. “They mimic noises when rabid.”

I stared at her.

She didn’t blink.

I swallowed. “Vivienne…”

She closed the front door behind us and locked every bolt in a swift, practiced motion.

Then her shoulders dropped.

“Bradley,” she murmured, “that wasn’t a coyote.”

The truth slid into the room like a shadow.

“That was a Doppel-variant,” she said quietly. “A mimic species. They don’t copy humans—they copy specific humans. Faces. Voices. Patterns. And once they fixate, they’re persistent.”

My pulse hammered.

“It had your voice before you left the studio. Which means it had already chosen you.”

I felt sick. “Why me?”

“I don’t know. Yet.” Her eyes softened, but her tone sharpened. “But you listen to me carefully now.”

She stepped closer, lowering her voice.

“You do not tell your neighbors. Your coworkers. Your friends. Not even your family. People die when they talk about things they aren’t supposed to see.”

A chill sank into my spine.

“I’m not trying to scare you,” she added, “but there are rules in this world. Old ones. And if you break them, hunters aren’t the only ones who come for you.”

My mouth went dry. “You’re threatening me?”

“I’m keeping you alive,” she said. “And keeping others from dying because of you.”

The house creaked. Something brushed the window outside—light, tentative, almost weary.

Vivienne’s hand went straight to her coat.

“It’s injured,” she whispered. “They always come back to finish what they start.”

I swallowed hard.

“Is it ever going to leave?” I asked.

She didn’t answer.

Not with words.

She clicked off the last light, plunging the room into darkness.

And then, from just outside the window—

Scrape.

Scrape.

Scrape.

The monster whispered my name again. "Bradley..."
