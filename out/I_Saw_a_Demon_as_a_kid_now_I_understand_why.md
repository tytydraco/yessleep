Talking about my past has never been easy. Not because I don’t want to, but because every time I try, the story changes. My therapist says trauma bends memory, fills in blanks with false details. My parents told me something similar.

But it never felt like a blank I was filling. It felt like remembering something I was never meant to know.

It was September. A storm outside. I was ten when I woke in the middle of the night. Sometimes I remember thunder. Sometimes silence. But always the clock—2:30 a.m., or maybe 2:03. That part doesn’t matter. What mattered was the feeling: that I wasn’t alone.

I crept toward the kitchen, hoping for cookies. But the air in the hallway was heavy, like the house itself was holding its breath.

Then I heard it. The slow twist of a doorknob.

I expected my parents. Instead, something else was there.

A figure. Human in shape, but smoke and shadow where skin should be. Its eyes were bright and white, featureless, yet I felt them grip me, as though they had known me forever.

I screamed.

The shadow staggered, startled by my voice. My parents ran out. My father chased it through the front door, into the woods. Later he swore it was just a burglar. But burglars don’t dissolve into air. Burglars don’t feel like memory.

That night has never left me. Over the years, the details blurred—the smell, the sounds, the shape of the thing. Except for the eyes. The eyes never changed.

And then I met her.

An old woman on the sidewalk, fallen and struggling. I helped her up. She smiled, too knowing, and said she must reward me. “I’ll give you what you’ve always wanted,” she said. “Your deepest desire.”

I don’t remember agreeing. I don’t remember speaking.

Her hand closed over mine. She whispered something I couldn’t hold on to. And the world vanished.

Not into darkness. Into nothing.

When it returned, I was standing in my parents’ house. The old house. The bathroom floor cool under my feet. The mirror fogged.

It was that night.

I walked into the hallway.

And there he was.

A boy. Ten years old. My face. My scream.

He called for his parents, and the sound split me in half. It was the same scream I’d carried all my life. Not from memory—from now.

My father’s voice thundered down the hall, his footsteps pounding after me. I ran, just like before, crashing into the woods, branches tearing at my arms. I collapsed against a tree, pulling my knees to my chest, shaking, sobbing.

And the truth—whatever it is—settled in.

Maybe I was haunted. Maybe I was insane. Maybe time is a trap, folding over itself until the beginning and the end are the same.

But no matter how I turn it, I see the same thing.

I was the shadow in the hallway.
The intruder.
The eyes.

I am the demon.

The architect of my own destruction. 

And maybe I always was.
