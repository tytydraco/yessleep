Day 1, 2013

I was sent to war. To fight against them. I'm on the plane, heading to the battlefield. I don't even know what we're fighting, or if I'll survive. We're arriving soon.



Day 19, 2013

I still don't know what we're fighting. It's huge and pitch black, absorbing all light. It stands 8 feet tall.

Send help. We need it.

They kill my friends. I just hope that I get out, but death is peace compared to this. Yet, I will fight for our country.



Day 70, 2013

We’re getting closer to victory, or so they say. But we’re losing so many. We’ve started calling them Syhti. They’re monsters with long, scaly arms and razor-sharp claws that slice through our armor like it’s paper. When they hit us, our organs spill out. This isn’t war—it’s torture.



Day 150, 2013

The Syhti have become aggressive. No longer do they attack in their little groups of twenty or thirty; they swarm, hundreds on hundreds, pressing against our defenses until they crack. Whenever we make a gain, they simply counter with a tide of numbers. I've lost count of the number of good men who've fallen. It's no longer about winning any battles; it's about trying to stay alive. And the fear… always there. There's hardly a moment to sleep before they are on us once more.



Day 247, 2013

Everything is falling apart. We’ve started retreating. The Syhti are pushing us back, taking more ground every day. We’ve lost millions. Even nukes do nothing to them.

The sergeant says surrender isn’t an option. He told us, “They’ve killed us already, but we’ll fight. Fight for our lives, for our families.”

I miss my sweet daughter.



Day 300, 2013

The sky is black with smoke and the reek of death. The battlefield stretched to infinity, bodies, twisted wreckage, gunfire. I have lost count of friends now, there have been so many. The Sythi simply kept on coming, inexorable, eyes like fire. It felt like it would never stop, ever. I am tired. just so tired. I do not know how much longer I can carry this on.



Day 377, 2014

I returned home. War has engulfed the cities now.

My family. they're dead. My wife was clutching our daughter, huddled in the closet. But Syhti found them. Ripped them to pieces.

There's no secret "secret" war anymore. Now what?

 

Day 420, 2014

We are forced deeper into hostile territory. The Syhti never seem to end; they just keep coming and coming. It has become a day-to-day, hour-to-hour sight of watching comrades fall. The blood never seems to end. I'm scared that we might not last through another night. Food and water are running out; ammo's almost spent. It would seem we've already lost…

I can't get my family out of my head. I just want to go home.



Day 490, 2014

We are down to ten men now. The Sythi are everywhere, closing in from every direction. We are trapped. We have made our stand in what once was a small town, but this feels like defeat. Supplies are gone, and options are all exhausted. Fear clings in the thick air; the sound of roars grows louder in the distance. We know they're coming for us again.



I sit here, thinking about my daughter, her laughter, the way she used to run up to me with that big smile. I don't know if I'll ever see her again. The others… they're scared too, but no one says it aloud. We're just waiting, preparing for the final charge. They'll come for us, and we'll give them everything we have left.



But this isn’t just a fight for survival anymore—it’s a fight to ensure that some part of humanity can live on after we’re gone. We’ve already lost our world… now we’re just trying to protect whatever’s left.



There’s a quiet resolve settling in among the men. We’ll fight… until the very end.
