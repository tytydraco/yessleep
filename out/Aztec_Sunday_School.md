"Blood is the sacrament of the gods. The sun rises when the heavens thirst-not for blood. In our hearts, the divine nectar is kept. The gods are thirsty - they need our blood or there can be no light. In darkness they dwell, and without our nourishing red blood, night shall be everlasting." I read aloud my belief to the teachers.

They just stared at me for a moment, unsure how to respond. Confirmation classes had struggled to explain to me a different truth, and I had already accepted that my baptism was the will of Tláloc, and I had sang the words of their hymns with my whole heart. I still did not understand how Tláloc could have made a mistake, when the cycle of everlasting rebirth was the truth of perfection.

"We have already taught you that it is the blood of Jesus Christ that washes you clean of sin." Father Ignatius spoke slowly and carefully. "It is not our blood that God wants, for the blood of the Lamb is the way to salvation."

I trembled slightly, feeling the first moment of my journey into a horror of new ideas. It had occurred to me that there must be something wrong with our blood, if it was unacceptable to the gods. I asked, with some trepidation, because it might mean I was somehow not an acceptable person to the gods:

"Do you mean that the gods do not thirst for my blood, but rather only the blood of Jesus?" I asked, worried for my grace in the light of the gods. If my blood was not good enough, what sacrifice might be?

"Nuavhu, you are now Joseph, and you live in the grace of God, sinless from the blood of the Lamb. You have only to accept the covenant of Jesus, as you did with your first Communion." Sister Valory reminded me.

"But the gods are still thirsty, are they not?" I asked.

"There is only one God." Teacher Victor spoke suddenly, like he was saying something without thinking.

"Tláloc." I said. "Tláloc is still alive, this I know. I realize that the other gods have - " I hesitated, unsure if the word was the right word, but unable to say anything different " - died."

"The gods have not died, they are myth. Only one true God exists!" Teacher Victor exclaimed, speaking to me as though I were a blasphemer.

"Perhaps in myth they reside, while Tláloc lives on. Do not the rains still come? Do not the crops grow? Am I not a child of the grace of Tláloc?" I shuddered, unable to accept that I was somehow wrong. I knew Tláloc was real, I had seen him walking in the forest, collecting flowers for his crown from among the thorns. The priest and the nun had told me that the blossoming crown of thorns was the sign of redemption from sin, and assured me I was saved. What was happening?

"You cannot be saved, not without the blood of Jesus, and denial of this Tláloc." Teacher Victor proclaimed. He gestured for the priest and the nun to agree.

"I am afraid your teacher is right. The Archbishop must be told that you have reserved your worship of Tláloc. If you are not found to be in the grace of God, through the blood of the Lamb, by the time he arrives, you will surely be excommunicated." Father Ignatius warned me.

I nearly fainted, I was terrified of being cast out of the house of Tláloc. I couldn't understand how my devotion to the one true god could also make me an exile from his grace. When I was taken to my cell to pray, I began to consider that I would have to find a way to give my blood, for the sunrise of my everlasting soul.

I fell asleep, feverishly gripping my rosary. In my nightmares I saw Tláloc in the forest, as I once had. The god was no longer shimmering in dew, the greenish blue of his skin, the ebony trim of his robes and the pure white feathers his garments were made of, all was cast aside into a dark and thorny mess. The horror of the thirsty god loomed.

When I woke up it was just before dawn, and I knew I must go and find my god where he lay in the forest, and feed him. If I wouldn't, there would be no sunrise, only a dying god, taking the last of his grace from a world so sinful that they had even cast me aside. If I was not pure, then I would have to find out who was. If nobody was good enough, then all were doomed. Night would never end and the monsters of the jungle, the creatures slithering up from the deepest pillars of the thirteen heavens would consume the world.

The priests had said this was called Xibalba, or Hell. I doubted the existence of that place. The pillars of the thirteen heavens were slippery with the ichor of the gods, fed on the liquid red blood of mortal creation - humanity. But if it must be called Xibalba to make sense to them, then that is a word, but it was merely the shadow cast by the beauty of the heavens, not some underworld of torment for the dead. I knew better, nothing dead lived down there. Those things ate the dead, as long as the gods didn't intervene.

I had rested easy, knowing Tláloc would protect me and everyone else. But now, it was Tláloc that needed protection. Without my help, the last god would surely die. Night would never end.

I wandered the path, just before sunrise, yet the light seemed to only glow on the hills where the jungle was cut away. I saw how the animals watched me with their eyes glowing, and the forest was silent, an eerie vigilance for the dying god.

My heart beat with terror, worried I would not make it in time. But there, in a clearing, among the wilting blue flowers Tláloc had come to pick by moonlight, the god lay dying, his colors faded to black and the robes in tatters and the smoothness of his skin a bramble of warts and thorns.

I hesitated, fear of going near such a powerful creature holding me fast. I lifted one hand, trembling, and then slowly approached the monstrous deity. In his current form, he was like a wounded animal, and might destroy me, lashing out in his agony, a death throe like a bladed claw from the darkness to eviscerate me.

"Tláloc, let my blood be pure enough to give you the sustenance." I offered. I lifted a razor sharp thorn from the forest floor, broken off of the god's own body as he had rolled back and forth in pain, dying in the dwindling forest.

I held my wrist over the god's parched lips, seeing how Tláloc's eyes watched me. I shivered in awe and dread, but did my duty and opened a vein to feed the god. As my blood flowed, he gulped and swallowed, drinking it and slowly becoming restored before my very eyes.

My weakness began, and I fell to my knees. Then, as Tláloc rose up above me, standing again on his own feet, I collapsed, the thorn clutched in one hand. Tláloc stood over me, and I could not remain awake, and then the sunrise began, and Tláloc ascended to Third Heaven, where his pool of water waited to bathe him in the early hours of the morning.

I smiled weakly, as I lay there, in and out of consciousness. The holy cleansing rains of the morning came and cooled me of the fever I felt. The animals sang in the harmony of the forest until the rain stopped. Then the great tractors, trucks, and machines used to harvest the jungle could be heard making progress.

The skies cleared of the white clouds of Tláloc's blessing and filled with the black diesel smoke and the drifting fumes of the petrol fire, where debris was burned throughout the workday. I was found there and taken back to the school.

"You attempted suicide. There is no hope for you now. Surely you are damned." Teacher Victor told me. Father Ignatius and Sister Valory prayed over me and prayed for me.

"Tláloc has accepted my blood sacrifice. My faith is rewarded. Another day is today, and night did not last forever. The world yet turns. I do not believe you know what you are talking about." I said, deliriously.

While another day came, I was too weak to return when night came again. Tláloc was only quenched a little bit, and thirst would come again. I could not stand up, let alone return to seek out my god by the waning moon. There was nothing I could do, as that night Tláloc lay dying near the cenote by Mary's Well.

I had a vision of the god, calling to me, last of the devoted, the final believer.

"How will night last forever?" Father Ignatius had asked me. "It is the will of God that the sun shall rise, not the actions or inactions of mankind."

"Then you have answered your own question, so why ask me?" I whispered weakly. I was barely clinging to life. Somehow the vision of my god had revitalized me, as though my body was restored through my faith, although I still felt very weak.

That is when the Earth began to shake. They were no longer held back. I fell out of my bed and saw through the open door how the priest and the teacher and the nun ran frantically across the courtyard.

I screamed in terror, my voice broken and distorted, as the very ground erupted around them and the slithering horrors from below came up. They took the teachers, they took the priest and they grabbed the nun and one by one they bit into the other students. Everyone was held by the creatures from below, none of them protected by Tláloc, who could do nothing for them.

The earthen landscape split open while it shook, and all the people and most of the chapel where above the gaping darkness, its living tendrils wrapped around all. Then the shaking and rumbling began to subside, and the buildings were as rubble all around, and everyone who had gathered in the clear center of the courtyard was gone, fallen into the bottomless hole beneath the surface of the world.

I stared in disbelief and horror, my eyes stinging with the dust all over my face and body. My bed I had fallen from was crushed behind me, and all around me the roof and walls lay piled high and in clouds of settling dust. My tears of grievance, terror and relief streaked through the dust on my cheeks, and I saw this in my reflection in the gradual stillness of the waters that had bubbled up around me.

A rain came, where dawn should have, but under thick clouds, there was no way to know if the sun had risen. Perhaps Tláloc was dead, and the pillar of the heavens had collapsed, and that is what had happened. I dreaded the return of the monsters, or that the Earth should swallow me up as well. How everyone was taken but I; left me thinking that there must still be hope, although I felt no hope, only fear for myself, fear for the whole world, and fear for Tláloc.

I limped and crawled through the clear-cut landscape, towards the remains of the forest. Somehow, I pulled myself through the mud and the grass, the vines and the roots, the tractor marks and past the piles of shattered wood.

There was a path from Mary's Well, that was made by the footfalls of the limping god. Wherever he had stepped, his blue flowers and fresh vines had grown. All along the way there was also a path burned by the slithering things, as they tore across the surface of the Earth, leaving a trail like a blackened and wilted scar.

There, at the edge of the forest, I found what was left of Tláloc, wheezing and dying, in much worse shape than I. There was nothing more I could do but stare piteously at the dying god. Tláloc had come to fight the monsters, trying to protect the forgetful humans, trying to do its duty, and had fought to the last, slaying a pile of the wretched slithering horrors, that lay slowly turning themselves like writhing severed worms.

Fear gripped me, telling me to come no closer. The gasses they dissolved into were toxic, forming the very clouds that were blotting out the sun. Should the dead muscles of the dying horrors catch me, they would crush me or worse, and I could see how their faceless mouths worked to open and shut in automation, although they were already slain by Tláloc's sharp hoe.

I saw how the god's spade dripped in the gore of the monsters, and how the soil it was stabbed into was already beginning to regrow the jungle, as vines and flowers encased the lower half, while the top was melting in the corrosive blood of the monsters from below.

I spoke to my god, pleading with him to give me the knowledge of what I could do to reverse the carnage. With his final breath, Tláloc looked at me and said:

"Night is the ignorance that shall prevail. Be forgiving, for only forgiveness, absolute forgiveness, can defeat the horrors of ignorance."

And with that, in the ancient language my mother and father had spoken to me when I lived with them in the forest, Tláloc spoke and gave his breath to me.

The clouds parted, and I looked up to the skies, seeing that the Thirteenth Heaven awaited the last of the gods, and as a cloud of birds of black and white, shimmering in the blue light, Tláloc ascended to where his brothers and sisters waited for him.

And so, I lay down and rested, and found my strength somehow return to me. I looked up and saw that Tláloc's spade was now a great tree, standing alone where the whole jungle should hold it in the center, but nothing but wasteland was all around. I decided I would go and teach Tláloc's message, that I would go among the people, and try to stop the ignorance that is our eternal night.
