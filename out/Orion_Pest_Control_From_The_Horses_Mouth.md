Nessa here. To start, I'll give yinz a brief update on our well-being after Samhain. 

(If you're not familiar with what Orion Pest Control's services are, it may help to start [here.)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/OpNHnxiz8U)

On my end, I have some more scars to add to my collection, but otherwise, I'm no worse for wear. Though, I do still find myself occasionally having nightmares about beheading. Can only imagine why.

The Dead Duo are back to normal. Wes came back from his recovery with only faint, jagged marks around his throat. So faint that you can only see them if you look in the right lighting. The only sign that he came scarily close to having his head chewed off. 

In other news, Cerri put in her two weeks’ notice. Can't say I blame her. While she personally walked away from the incident unscathed, she had to witness what happened to the rest of us. She said it made her think long and hard about her future. 

Ordinarily, leaving isn't really an option for us, unless it's in a coffin; I know that sounds morbid, but that's just how it is. You all have seen how the Neighbors are when it comes to vendettas. You'll see even more about that later on in this post. But with how Cerri kind of stayed in the background, she may have a chance to get back some semblance of a normal life. 

I really do wish her luck.

After everything, office morale wasn't great for a while. It tends to happen after a rough job like that. It took a few days, but we're all back to joking with one another again. What can I say? We all love being idiots too much to let a little bit of maiming get in the way of that. (Exception: Victor is the holder of the only brain cell in Orion. He is more possessive over it than Iolo is over me.)

So there yinz have it. The world is still turning. The sun is still rising. 

The rest of this post going forward will be an excerpt from Deirdre. Since she already had her thoughts conveniently written out, I figured it would be best to use that to update yinz on her situation. Straight from the horse's mouth. With her permission, of course. 

**Her entry is as follows:**

Writing appears to help Nessa get her thoughts in order, so I'm hoping it'll do the same for me.

I suppose it would be best to begin by outlining the turmoil. Perhaps an answer will present itself there, hidden somewhere in the details. I suppose I could start with what I remember, which, admittedly, is not very much. 

There isn't a hard line in my memories that marks the end of my human life or the beginning of my servitude to the river. Between those two points in time, there is only a thick haze that I can’t see through, no matter how hard I try. Mortality seems more like a dream rather than something I'd truly had, at one point. Had I ever been married? What about children? Surely, I must have left someone behind. 

Through my servitude, I have died more times than I can count. While it doesn't happen to me in a literal sense, it is an experience I share with the doomed souls whose shirts I work tirelessly to scrub clean. I feel their last moments as if they were mine. Every suicide, every accident, every anatomical failure. 

Yet, outside of the river and outside of my premonitions… nothing. Not the wind on my face, the warmth of the sun, or the touch of the woman I'm growing to love. Nothing. 

As a Weeper, I'm secluded on the outside of both worlds. Only able to feel human for the brief moment where I live through their final tragedies. There isn't much kinship with the ones from the Mounds, either. For the most part, Weepers are relegated to the background. Rocks on the edge of the road. Unable to harness any real power. Nothing worth paying any notice to. Though, I would say that their usual apathy is for the better. 

For the longest time, I simply existed. Drifting through the decades. Grieving. Washing. Singing. Grieving. Washing. Singing. 

I didn't feel real anymore. There's a part of me that still doesn't. 

But then the Lady of Orion told me that she liked my singing. She hadn't looked at me with fear, contempt, or pity, as I'm often accustomed to. She saw me as something else. Something *more.*

And those eyes… so dark. Dark enough to lose oneself in, yet so gentle. The kind gaze of someone who truly wants to see the world around her better. I thought of them often, as well as the woman who saw the world through their soulful depths. Our first interaction had been brief. Far too brief. 

When she promised to return, I smiled. When was the last time I'd smiled? I couldn't recall. 

For just a brief moment, I was real again. And in my selfishness, I couldn't let it go. Let *her* go. 

In that regard, I truly am no better than he is, am I? 

As the days passed before I could see her again, I found myself thinking of her. Who was she? What was she like? Was she truly kind or had I been imagining all of it, merely forcing my preconceptions onto her? So many questions that needed answers. 

All I knew was that I looked forward to seeing her again. It’s truly a shame that the circumstances of our next meeting had not been better. 

Her breathing was so labored that I could hear her long before she reached the river bank. Meanwhile, her pursuer didn't make a sound. Following her silently, patiently waiting for his prey to succumb to him. 

My pulse had raced. I acted. Or, I tried to. I leapt out onto the riverbank to go to her. 

Unseen hooks buried themselves into my intestines. Pulling. Stretching. Tears sprang to my eyes. Unable to breathe, I dragged myself back in. The sensation alleviated, though I still struggled to take in any air after the river's punishment. My chest quaked as my lungs refused me. 

Unable to leave or make a sound, I listened, helpless to aid the woman I'd been so curious about. 

Her frantic footsteps drew nearer. She collapsed by the bank, arms trembling. Behind her was a shadow. 

Before he could reach her, I managed to gather enough breath to yell, “Huntsman! I need her!”

The foul shadow passed her, the moonlight illuminating the captain of the Wild Hunt as he glowered at me. 

I didn't dare look into his eyes. Regardless, the sharpness of his stare pinned me in place. What cruelty is it that I can't feel her touch, but the Huntsman's gaze can penetrate through the numbness of the river? He skinned me with his eyes for daring to stop him from devouring her. 

The more I argued for her life, the more the Huntsman's stare promised. 

He is far worse than his predecessor. The captain before him had been vile as well, but more content to have their underlings do their work for them. The Dragonfly usurped them not too long ago, though I must admit that my perception of time is rather warped. It could've been three decades ago or three years ago. They've all blurred together. 

Despite my apprehension, I gathered the courage to fight for her despite barely knowing anything about the Lady of Orion. The river showed me what the Huntsman did to her father. I *felt* it. My skin peeled off until I was nothing but a miserable husk of screaming nerves. Limbs twisted, then amputated. He'd barely resembled anything more than meat by the time the Huntsman had grown bored of mutilating him. 

While the river never gave me the Lady of Orion's shirt, I didn't doubt for a moment that he had something similar in mind for her if I failed to convince him. After much back and forth while the poor woman clung to consciousness, he’d realized that he couldn’t break her vow to me and eventually acquiesced. 

I have many regrets, but saving her will never be one of them. Nor will be giving her his name. Even if his terrible promises come to fruition and he destroys me someday, it will have been worth it to know that I'd done what I could for her. 

What I do regret, however, is trapping her. She'd confessed to me once before that she believed love to be a cage. Not unlike the one her mother had fallen into. Even though I hadn't intended it at the time, I'd proven her right by trapping her in this bargain. I became her cage. 

As such, it is my responsibility to break it. 

I’d bargained with the Huntsman for her life using the rules of our world. Perhaps I can do the same for mine. And by extension, hers. At this point, we are tied together.

I waited until she went to work. She'd told me that she wanted to work to resolve our situation together and ordinarily, I would oblige that. However, she just survived a battle with the Dullahan. She's having to accept that the Huntsman will be her curse until the day either one of them gives in or perishes. Unfortunately, this Huntsman is terribly patient when it comes to matters like this. Old things like him know how to wait. He will eventually find some other way to try to enthrall her. 

Nobody deserves this curse. Nessa least of all.

Against my better judgment, I sought him out in the hopes of reasoning with him. Reasoning with a lunatic… What was I thinking? Perhaps *I’m* the real lunatic. However, I had bargained with him as well as those under his command successfully in the past. Moundfolk are covetous by nature, always seeking something. I am rue to admit that I am no exception to this. 

The Huntsman can't touch me with the hagstone. The river still has one thread left, tethering me to it. As long as that frail strand isn't severed, at the very least, he cannot take my life. 

When I arrived at his shop, he was busy with a customer. Keeping up appearances, the Huntsman gave me a brief, polite wave and smile in greeting. The customer glanced at me in reflex as the door shut behind me, raising his gray eyebrows before turning his attention back to the Huntsman.

It was surprising to see that the ‘banjo bastard’ - as Nessa eloquently likes to refer to him - looked rather sickly. He was paler than usual, his lower eyelids accentuated with dark shadows. The seeds must've been taking their toll on him. His penance for pushing himself as he did on Samhain. Orion’s vampire had served his purpose well.

Regardless of his apparent illness, he still carried himself with the easy confidence of a conqueror. Those hazel eyes were keen as they occasionally flickered towards me while the old man told him about his grandson's apparent attitude problem. The Huntsman was an excellent actor, effortlessly convincing his customer that he cared to hear any of it. Anyone that didn't know the Hunter's true nature would believe him. 

When the old man left him and me alone together, I became acutely aware of those eyes once again, glaring at me as if he sought to pry me open with one of his many tools strewn about. But despite the violence of his stare, he put on a guise of friendliness, “What brings you here?”

I reminded myself of what Nessa had said: *give yourself a chance.*

Daring to hold the Huntsman's gaze, acutely aware that the only thing protecting me from his will was a pebble with a hole in it, I inquired, “What would it take to convince you to spare my life?”

He raised his eyebrows, with a small laugh, “Oh, you ain't wastin’ any time! Right out with it!”

“Please answer the question, Huntsman.” I urged him patiently. 

All traces of humor disappeared from his expression as he coolly replied, “Nothing.”

Truthfully, I'd expected as much, but I'd thought at the very least, I could get him to entertain the idea before immediately refusing it. However, I wouldn't let him reduce me to pleading for my life. I was already in a rather undignified position to begin with. I did not need to go lower. 

Funnily enough, I continued to attempt to reason with the unreasonable, “If you kill me, she won't forgive you. And she'll never love you.”

My heart sank when he began to laugh again, “You think that's what this is about, *caoineadh?* Jealousy? Christ, I'm petty, but not *that* fuckin’ petty!”

“So what, then?”

“Now, I *know* you ain't this stupid.” He said, leaning onto the counter. 

This was a wound that had been festering for some time. One that I’d caused him. I spoke the cause of the gangrenous injury's name aloud: “The ledger.” 

The Huntsman clicked his tongue and winked in confirmation. 

Despite knowing it wouldn't do any good, I felt the need to defend my actions, “The game you were playing with the Lady of Orion wasn't a fair one. If I hadn’t stepped in, you would’ve killed her and I couldn’t allow that.”

His voice became colder than the river's depths in the dead of winter. “Wasn't meant to be fair. And wasn’t that just so noble of you! *Selflessly* stickin’ your neck out for her!”

He'd found this particular weakness back in the corn maze and was not shy about exploiting it. 

I hate it. I hate that I did it. I hate that I allowed myself to become one of *them.* Just as opportunistic.

*I just wanted to be free.*

The Huntsman's chuckle gave me the terrible urge to clench my hands into fists, “Aw, don't get all mopey. I ain't one to judge! It's exactly what *I* woulda done, after all.” 

He was distracting me with his barbs. Getting into my head. It took a moment for me to regain my composure, taking in a deep breath before I tried again, “I don't wish to argue with you, Huntsman. I came here to discuss things with civility.” 

He snorted, “Did you, now?”

“I did.” I replied evenly. “Is that something you are capable of?”

“Probably not, but my afternoon is pretty well wide open, so why dontcha go on ahead and try anyway?”

That made me frown. “You might consider a hobby sometime.”

Unfortunately, my retort didn’t have the effect I’d wanted; the intent had been to get under his skin as he does mine. Instead, he found it humorous. “*Woo!* Fiona seems to be rubbin’ off on you! Gotta say, it does make you more interestin’!”

I sighed, feeling far too much like a scholar dealing with a difficult, heckling student. “Will you please take this seriously?”

He raised a hand, still smiling, “Alright, alright! I’ll stop bein’ a dick for a minute.” 

The Huntsman took a deep breath, sobering somewhat. “Come to think of it, there’s one thing you could do to put all o’ this behind you. You get to be a human again. Free to grow old, pay taxes, do whatever the hell you want without me tearin’ your soul apart. But you *really* ain’t gonna like it!”

That wasn’t surprising. In his mind, I’d done something egregious. As such, that gave him the leverage to ask for something equally as diabolical in return. I told him to name his price.

He was all too eager to do so. “Fiona’s name. The real one, this time.”

My eyes widened. Instantly, I protested, “Absolutely not!”

The fiend shrugged, smirking insufferably, “Told ya you wouldn’t like it!”

I wanted to argue that there *must* be something else, but I couldn’t. His sights had been set on Nessa for a while. As of now, I am still unsure if his desires are carnal in nature, or if it more strongly matches the desires of a wolf seeking a doe that has successfully evaded it for far too long. Perhaps even some terrible combination of the two. No matter what his intentions towards Nessa are, it was clear that pleading with him to choose another grueling favor would be fruitless. He wanted *her.*

As shaken as I was, I still dared to ask him a question that had been haunting me for some time: “I truly don’t understand you. Why can't you simply leave her be?” 

He ignored me, “You said some shit earlier ‘bout fairness. You already gave her my name, so that'd even everything out, *caoineadh.*” 

The Huntsman had been dominating our conversation thus far. I couldn't let him continue, so I asked again, “Why not just let her go?”

He sighed, clearly losing patience, “Believe it or not, I don't want this attraction to Fiona anymore than she does. Funny thing is, I didn't have it ‘til she named me. Ya think that's a coincidence?”

That sounded unbelievable to me. He’d appeared to have had a fixation on Nessa before I'd translated the ledger for her, though that seemed more motivated by hunger than by infatuation. However, if he was saying it, at the very least, *he* believed it to be true to the best of his knowledge. 

From what I know about how names can be used to control us, it was possible that by using his against him, Nessa had unintentionally bound him to her. The threat of having him permanently tied to me in the way that he is bound to her is why I've refrained from doing the same. Perhaps that was why his affections towards Nessa were still edged with hostility. 

“What if I helped you get rid of the attraction instead?” I offered. “That's what you truly want, isn't it?”

“What do ya think I'm-” The Huntsman cut himself off, his eyes suddenly narrowing at the door behind me. “Hold that thought.”

Abruptly, he turned and disappeared into the back of his shop. Before I could question him, I heard a car door slam shut from outside. Another customer? Sadly, not. When I peered through the nearest window, I was greeted by the unwelcome sight of another Huntsman approaching. 

This one was unfamiliar to me. With his stature and the stern expression on his face, he reminded me of a bear. I recall dreading seeing him. Dreading the appearance of yet another Huntsman to bring grief to an already grief-stricken region. 

However, the problem ended up taking care of itself. Though, I suppose it would be more accurate to say that our usual problem took care of it instead.

The bear flounced through the door, not paying me even a passing glance. Without looking back at it, he then reached behind him, surreptitiously turning the lock into place. I didn’t dare move, staying still to avoid his notice. 

Not long after, the captain of the Wild Hunt reemerged from the back room, casually holding a tire iron in a gloved hand, cheerfully greeting the huge Hunter, “Howdy!”

Equally as amicable, the bear returned it, “Hello!”

There was the glint of a knife in the bear's hand. The violence between them was so sudden and unexpected that it made me yelp as I backpedaled, momentarily forgetting about the hagstone's protection in my fright. 

With one massive hand, the bear had shoved the Huntsman back into one of the vehicles he'd been working on, the impact creating a dent in its front. The Dragonfly moved just as the knife was driven down into the hood, right where his head had been. Afterwards, there was an awful thud as the tire iron left a perfect imprint on the side of the bear's head. Contact with the poisonous metal briefly caused the bear's disguise to falter, revealing an even more imposing horned figure concealed beneath the veil. 

Not wanting to be around for any more of this brutality - especially because our discussion had been going nowhere - I crept towards the door. The Huntsman caught me, shouting as he wrapped his forearm around the bear's throat, pressing down hard enough to make his opponent's face turn purple, “We ain't done here! You stay *right* where you are!”

The veins in the bear's face and neck were bulging as his elbow battered the Huntsman's ribs. The Dragonfly’s grip faltered for just long enough for the bear to break free. Their movements became a blur after that.

After he'd snapped at me, I was afraid to leave, not just out of concern for my own well-being, but Nessa's. I wouldn't put it past him to transfer any anger I awakened in him onto her, given how volatile he could be. She didn’t need that.

Unsure of what to do with myself in the meantime, I uncomfortably glanced around, seeking something to read to distract myself from the brawl. Naturally, there was nothing save for some brochures on full-synthetic oil. Meanwhile, it sounded like a natural disaster was occurring in that back room, between the metallic clanks of their weapons and the ear-splitting crashes that would reverberate throughout the shop whenever one of them would attempt to overpower the other. 

Truth be told, such violence makes me sick. One would think that after vicariously experiencing so much of it in my visions that I would be desensitized to it. That is not the case. If anything, it has only increased my aversion. 

Eventually, I heard a howl. It didn't come from the Dragonfly. There were a series of horrific, muffled thuds after that; the grotesque sound of meat being tenderized. Then silence. 

When the Huntsman stalked back out, both he and the tire iron were covered in blood. 

“I appreciate your patience,” He said breathlessly, wrapping the tool in a grease-covered towel that looked as if it could've been yellow at one point. 

I struggled to find words after the chaos that had just transpired. As he used a roll of paper towels to wipe the blood off of his face and arms, I warily - and with some trepidation - asked, “What was that about?”

“Hm? Oh, *him.*” What else would I have been referring to? “Yeah, that happens from time to time. I'm guessin’ he saw the state I was in after Samhain and thought he had a shot at a promotion.”

They truly are barbaric. There is a guilty part of me that wishes that the bear had won. But alas, the Dragonfly retains his position. 

He tossed the used paper towel towards the refuse bin, frowning when it bounced off the side, the reddened ball rolling a few centimeters along the floor next to it. With a sigh, he picked it up and placed it where it belonged. 

“Anyways,” The Huntsman began, leaning with his lower back pressed against the counter, then folding his arms across his chest. “Fiona’s real name.”

“I do not know it,” I informed him firmly. “And even if I did, I would not share it with anyone else like us, you especially.”

He chuckled harshly, shaking his head as he tilted his chin up towards the ceiling, “*Us?* You ain't one of us, *caoineadh!* Not really.” 

Before I could say another word, his voice and stare froze me in place as he continued, “You weren’t there when they came in droves, razin’ our forests to forge their iron weapons. You weren’t there when they cut our wings off as trophies, or when they strung my brothers’ and sisters’ bodies up on trees. You weren’t there when we lost *everything.* You *ain't* one of us.”

Swallowing, I summoned the audacity to point out, “And now you're attracted to one of them.” 

His laughter was bitter, “Yeah. Fuckin’ joke, isn't it?”

After gathering some more bravery, I presented him with my earlier offer once again, “If I find some way to help you dispel the attraction, will you allow me to live once the river releases me?” 

All traces of humor had drained from his demeanor, “I ain't negotiatin’ with ya. You wanna live so badly? Find me her name.”

“Please, be reasonable-”

“I *am* bein’ reasonable.” He interrupted calmly. “Now, I'll admit that I shouldn't've underestimated her and made that bet in the first place. That’s on me. However, if ya hadn't translated that ledger, I'd've made a fuckin’ buffet out of her and her colleagues' a while ago. Come on, *caoineadh,* you had to know this was comin'!”

“I did,” I conceded. “From the beginning, I was aware that there would be repercussions to aiding her. But you said yourself that the Lady of Orion is worth the trouble. I'm inclined to agree with you.”

“Yeah, she is some trouble, ain't she?” Despite professing his resentment about what he believed to be a manufactured attraction towards Nessa, he sounded as if he were fond of her when he said this.  

At the risk of agitating him again, I gave my honest thoughts in the hope that it could eventually lead to some resolution, “Given what you told me earlier about your history, I can imagine that it's easier to believe that your desires towards Nessa stem solely from having your name taken. However, I can’t help but wonder if there’s a bit more to it that you haven’t acknowledged.”

His eyes slitted, though his smirk remained as he playfully asked, “You tryin’ to psychoanalyze me, *caoineadh*?”

“Not at all,” I insisted evenly. “I'm merely telling you what I see. And what I see is someone who would rather convince himself that he is being manipulated rather than enamored.”

He shrugged, “Well, sounds like you best get your eyes checked. Now, are you gonna get me that name or are you gonna continue to waste my time? I got a body to dispose of.”

Maintaining my guise of patience, I took a deep breath then explained, “The point I'm trying to make is that learning her name won't stop the attraction, neither will eliminating me. All you'll serve to do by pursuing either option is ensure that your infatuation will remain unrequited. The best thing you can do for yourself and for Nessa is to let her go. Let *us* go.”

He pursed his lips in a pantomime of consideration, though I could tell that his mind was already made up. It had been made for a long time and it wasn't about to change.  

Eyes on the ground, demeanor light, he questioned, “Can I ask you somethin’, *caoineadh?*”

Hesitantly, I told him he could. A naïve little part of me wondered if agreeability would encourage him to find some semblance of mercy in his black heart. 

He snickered as he asked, “Just between you and me, do you actually care about Fiona? Or do you just care 'bout what she can do for you?”

Naïve, indeed. I should've known better. I *did* know better. The only thing something like him can understand is cruelty. 

I shook my head in disbelief at what he was accusing me of, “I'm not like you, Huntsman. I don't see people as a means to an end.”

“That ain't an answer.” He taunted. 

Despite knowing that I didn't have to justify myself to the being that has repeatedly assaulted Nessa in every way that he could - beating her, forcing himself on her, manipulating her - the implication that I was using her as he would made my blood boil. 

“Not that it matters to you, Huntsman, but I *do* care. And even if I'm not here to see it, I know that she *will* be free of you some day. They all will be. You talk about the repercussions of *my* actions? What about yours! You've been a terror for centuries by your own admission! You and yours are a blight upon this world!”

“So it's the latter.” His response made me reconsider my stance on violence. 

Trying to defend myself had been a mistake. No matter what I said, he would twist my words to make me out to be as villainous as he is. 

“Believe what you want, Huntsman.” I uttered in resignation. “I'll leave you to tend to your… guest.”

As I departed in what I hoped appeared to be a level-headed manner, he mockingly told me that if I changed my mind on betraying Nessa, I knew where to find him. 

Going there had been foolish. Clearly, trying to discuss things like civilized people was beyond the Huntsman's capabilities. To be clear, I'd known from the beginning that my involvement in saving Nessa’s life wouldn't be without its consequences. However, he had surprised me before by aiding her and her colleagues with the hag. There was a small, stupid part of me that had been hoping he'd surprise me again. 

There has to be another way. I will neither give up on my life nor my freedom, though I refuse to betray the woman I care about to obtain either one. 

As I've noted before, I am selfish. And at this moment, my most selfish desire is that she would've let him die.

Even after describing my situation and reexamining my abysmal interaction with the Huntsman, I still don't have a perfect solution. I’ll outline the possibilities I’ve already visited so that I don’t linger on them any longer.

Leaving after severing my tie to the river is not an option. Running from a Huntsman is ill-advised to begin with, but with the grudge he has against me, there isn't a doubt in my mind that he'd hunt me to the ends of the earth. 

There’s the possibility that another Hunter could take advantage of his injuries just as the bear had attempted to. With any luck, one of them will usurp him just as he did the captain that controlled this region before. However, he has proven himself to be formidable, even in weakness. There is also that possibility that his hypothetical replacement could be worse. 

When Nessa came home from work, she informed me that the employee who uses the false name, Cerri, had submitted her two weeks’ notice. After the events of Samhain, it is completely understandable. The Hunters didn’t appear to have as much interest in her as the others, so they’re praying that she’ll be able to make a clean break once her time is up.

That gave me an idea. 

Judging by her reaction, I apparently caught her off guard when I asked, “What were the exact terms you set in your bet with the mechanic? About his potential claims on Orion employees?”

Her brow furrowed as she tried to recall the exact words that they’d exchanged, “Uh… If I found his name, he had to relinquish his claim on all employees, regardless if they were living, dead, or undead. Why?”

“Does that apply only to those employed during the time of the deal, or does that extend to those brought on afterwards?”

She frowned, “Come to think of it, we didn’t specify. In hindsight, we should have.”

The Huntsman would probably point that out as well. It truly is a shame that one has to be both ruthless and cunning.

“Why?” Nessa asked, throwing herself onto the couch next to me. “Are you worried the Hunters will look for Cerri?”

Terribly enough, I had been so focused on my own situation that I hadn’t considered the threat to her colleague. But now that she’d mentioned it, I was concerned. 

“That is a frightening prospect,” I said, not wanting to admit my self-absorption. “I also need you to know that I spoke to him today.”

She gave me an incredulous look, “Wait, you *spoke* to the mechanic? Willingly?”

After I apologized for my secrecy, I relayed the entire experience to her. She wasn’t happy that I’d gone without warning her beforehand, which I accepted. I should have told her what my intentions were. As I showed her the recollection above, she snickered when I confessed to telling him to get a hobby, but otherwise her face was grave as she read my account of events, especially when I described the challenge from that other Hunter. 

“But to be clear, you did specify *all* Orion employees, did you not?” I inquired after she was done.

She nodded, “Yeah, we did.”

“Then we might be able to argue that ‘all’ includes current and previous employees. As long as there is an employment history, Cerri should fall under that protection. The same should go for any others that your supervisor recruits afterwards.”

Her pale eyebrows rose. “Huh. I… think you might be right. Of course, that’s only protection from the mechanic, but that’s better than nothing, right?”

I nodded, “It is! But in truth, that isn’t the sole reason why I brought the subject up.”

That was when I asked if there was any possibility that her employer would consider hiring me. A glimmer of recognition made her gloriously dark eyes shine like a starlit night. Without another word, she called the leader of Orion.

When he answered, it sounded as if he’d just awoken, or that he’d rather be doing anything but speaking to someone else. From what little I know about the draugr, both possibilities were equally viable.

Nessa didn’t help matters. Her way of beginning this conversation was, “Hey, you wanna hire my girlfriend?”

I failed to consider that she has made annoying him into an art form. I put my face in my hands to hide from her impish grin, not wanting my laughter to be audible over the phone. 

There was a loud, heavy sigh from the other end of the line, followed by an exhausted, “What?”

“Okay, hear me out!” She said, “First of all, she’s a genius-”

Flustered and giggling like an idiot, I whispered, “*Will you stop?!*”

Nessa carried on as if I hadn’t said anything, “She is a genius that figured out that as long as someone is or was employed at Orion, the mechanic can’t eat their souls! Not to mention that she has been extremely valuable to our organization, such as finding all those hagstones for us. Honestly, she should’ve been on our payroll a long time ago and you’ve been benefiting from free labor, buster!”

Even though I couldn’t feel it, I was certain that I had to be blushing. When I glanced in the mirror hanging at the end of the hall, I discovered that I was right.

Victor replied, “Splendid! She can take your spot!”

“Even if you fired me, I’d just show up anyway! And with a lawsuit, since you’re making us work for free.”


With another heavy sigh, her supervisor asked, “Can I talk to her? *Instead* of you?”

Instantly, I became nervous as she readily handed me the phone. With a shaky exhale, I accepted it, taking it off of the loudspeaker option in case the draugr wanted privacy.

Since I wasn’t as familiar with him as my beloved is, I felt the need to be polite, “Good evening.”

“Sometimes, I forget how nice it is to speak to another grown-up.” He joked, thankfully sounding less irritated with me than he had with Nessa. 

After a swallow, I explained to him all of the intricacies of my situation. About the premonition of my own death, leaving out the details of this vision that continued to haunt me. My ribs breaking as the Huntsman reached into my chest as he had before, but without the river’s numbness to spare me from the pain this time. The firm coil of his hand around my heart mere seconds before arteries tore, stretching to the point of snapping as he took his time ripping my heart out. Darkness swallowed me even before I felt the tip of his finger burrow into the tear duct of my right eye. 

I shook off the memory, going on to say, “Because of the verbiage of Nessa’s deal with the one you refer to as ‘the mechanic,’ I have reason to believe that the only way that I can survive after escaping from the river is by using the protection that Orion has been granted by naming him.”

The owner of Orion sounded somewhat apprehensive, “There are some concerns I have, the first being that the deal was only about employees’ souls. He'd still be able to take your life, if the opportunity presented itself. Unfortunately, the fucker is smart, so that won't escape his notice. He could also enlist either Briar or the Houndmaster to do the job for him, since the deal only applies to the mechanic.”

The leader of Orion was right to point all of this out. But even so, “It's not complete protection, but it's more than what I have now.”

“That's true,” He agreed. “And you're aware that you'll have to handle iron and salt?”

“Once I’m human again, neither of those will be an issue.” I assured him. 

He was quiet for a moment as he considered. I held my breath in anticipation. 

Eventually, he said, “Well, I suppose we do owe you for all that you’ve done for us.”

Nessa seemed pleased to hear that come Monday, I will be joining the Orion crew. The plan is for me to complete my onboarding before I end my servitude to the river. This way, we can ensure that the Huntsman can't reach me before Orion's protection is in effect. 

She also said that she wants to gauge the Huntsman's reaction to the news of my hiring. Her thinking is that a negative response will indicate if we're on the right track or not. As much as it pains me to acknowledge it, she appears to have gotten to know the Huntsman fairly well. Well enough to see through him better than she had probably ever wanted to.  

On another note… Nessa has asked if she can publish my account of events, provided that I'm comfortable with it. Admittedly, I'm nervous to have my private thoughts put before the eyes of strangers, but in the end, it might not be a terrible idea to have a few more sets of eyes to look over our circumstances. It's entirely possible that there is something we are missing that someone else could [see](https://www.reddit.com/r/atypicalpests/s/kvnRWF2wFv).
