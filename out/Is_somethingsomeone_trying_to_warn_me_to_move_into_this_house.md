I kindly ask you guys to read this post to the end. It's very important to me. I'm beginning to suspect that something (or someone) is trying to warn me about moving into the new apartment... The story is 100% true! 

I need advice… I’ve been living in Germany for several years, and life here is quite good. I can say that I’m almost satisfied at the moment. The only problem is my apartment. My place is really annoying me because I feel like I live in a paper-thin-walled building. I hear every sound, and it’s driving me crazy. The neighbors aren’t too friendly either… that’s just a prelude. 

Everything started in December 2022. For a long time, I helped my dad, who lived in the same town as me but much farther away. I often visited him. My dad was diagnosed with very awful disease and had trouble moving around independently. As a result, in Decemeber, the decision was made for him to move to a „nursing home” (Pflegeheim in Germany). I had to take care of everything, related to transferring my dad’s rented apartment to the eccentric Owner…

My friendship  with the apartment’s owner(let’s call him Andy) turned out to be really interesting with each meeting, and I enjoyed listening to his stories. We met quite often because there were many formalities to take care of, and in mid-2023, I told him that I was looking for an apartment and if he knew anyone, he should pass on that info. And… I was very suprised when he offered me to live in an apartment that is located in his family home and has belonged to his family for several generations. 

I was super happy, because from what he said, the apartment was large and spacious, and the house is in a beautiful and peaceful neighborhood. He also told me that the ground floor is rented out to a certain couple, a very specific couple….

Soon more about them, cause I think they are super important part of the story. 

When I went to see the apartment, I must admit I was shocked. There were so many things inside… Unusual souvenirs, paintings, books, newspapers, photos, artifacts - some of them were even simply scary…but just things from all over the world. His family was very rich and they traveled a lot. However, even I knew it’s gonna be a lot of work I made the decision that I wanted to live here. The apartment is in very good condition, it only needs some “updating”. We agreed together with Andy that we would remove all these things until it was clean, and then I could move in. And over time, while working, he told me many different stories related to the house, himself, and the mysterious neighbors on the ground floor...

It turns out that my good friend and also the owner of the house are very interested in esotericism, tarot, demonology, and supernatural phenomena... He showed me a lot of books about tarot, occultism, and black magic. I must admit that I wasn't scared, but quite the opposite - it really intrigued me because I myself enjoy such stories.

He also told me many quite scary stories from his life. He told me about underground civilizations, magic, demons etc. It fascinated me and still does. Sometimes he claimed to have the gift of seeing what an ordinary person doesn't see, so he can read from the tarot cards. Andy is also an artist and painter. And I must admit that some of his sculptures and paintings make me feel weird. Some of them are just a little bit scary. But he is a truly talented artist! Very very creative and smart guy. 

Now it's time to write something more about the strange neighbors. This is probably the most disturbing part... So, these neighbors moved into this house over 10 years ago. They never caused any problems. Andy told me that this man used to work at the University, if I remember correctly, and he never really gained sympathy. Supposedly, he always felt(Andy) that there was something wrong with him(Neighbour). This neighbor leaves the house only 3 times a day. Always at the same times. He walks the same path with his wife and dog for years. It seems to me that he only goes out because of the dog. I've seen many times that even when it's dark, the lights in their apartment are off. Andy also said that he turned off his doorbell. 

Every time I've been there, you can never hear any conversations, the dog never barks, even when something heavy falls on the floor. He doesn't talk to anyone, neither does his wife - according to what Andy told me. Only she goes shopping and takes care of matters that require going into town. Andy says that probably something very bad happened to him and he has that feeling that this neighbour is hiding something very bad. He told my yesterday that he (Andy) has nightmares with this guy…. 

He can’t kick him out, cause legally the house belongs to his father, and his father is currently very ill… this weird Neighbour has been paying rent for 10 years without any delays, and legally, there is no way to complain about him… 

Often when I'm there, I feel like I'm being watched. I have the impression that someone is constantly staring at me - but maybe it's just an illusion? Andy complains that the energy of this guy is really negative and he doesn't like being there, but I don't feel that... Besides, cleaning the apartment and taking out all these things is very difficult for us because there are constantly problems arising. Once when we were cleaning the kitchen, we both heard like a woman's voice???, but neither of us could say exactly what the voice said, and we wondered if it was just sounds hallucinations? Well, when we were supposed to take out the unnecessary furniture and we set a date, a week earlier I suddenly had an accident... and now I have my arm in a cast…. I'm starting to wonder if someone is trying to warn me against moving into this house? Is there something wrong with this house? Are the neighbor and the homeowner somehow connected in a strange way? Or I’m getting crazy? 

Well, this house could be the perfect setting for shooting a horror movie - especially at night. The attic (previously inhabited) is also full of unusual things - even from the time of World War II. 

But as I said - I don’t know what to do… or what should I think… any ideas?
