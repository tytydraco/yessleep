Some memories stick with you for the rest of your life. A perfect snapshot of a moment that you have no choice but to revisit. Time and time again. 

I remember his eyes more than anything. Wide open with the shine completely rubbed out. His skin was paler than it was supposed to be. Just a shade under sheet white, with green and purple veins running just below the surface. Dusty blonde hair dull and gray. And a red-handled knife from our kitchen sticking out of his chest. 

I used to think scary things only happened in the night. Naive I guess. Or maybe I just hadn’t thought on it before. But the truth is, the scary things don’t go away just because the sun comes out. And the soft, golden light of the early morning filtered through the curtain in his room, and lit him up like an angel. I remember wishing it had been night. Then maybe I wouldn’t remember every single detail.

That was nineteen years ago. I don’t remember the before and after much anymore. I know my parents found me curled around the body, staring blankly at the wall. I know my mother screamed, and I bit my dad’s arm when he tried to get me out of the room. He still has the scar, though it’s become a running joke after years of therapy for all of us. It’s amazing what we can joke about. It’s amazing how much it helps.

These days I feel almost normal, though never quite all the way there. I’m twenty-seven with a stable job. I have a nice car. My family and I are close, and they adore my girlfriend Penny. I’m planning on proposing to her. I genuinely love my life. There’s only one issue.

When I was thirteen my parents took me to do something they’d been promising for almost a year. We went to a tattoo parlor together. It was almost Christmas, so I was off from school, and I can still remember the smell of the sugar cookie candle they had lit that day. My parents spoke very briefly to the artists, but I knew they’d talked to them a lot before, they’d been planning this for months. 

I don’t remember the pain very much. I knew one of my friends at school had a tattoo, it was for his diabetes. He used to tell me, “You either sweat or you cry, but you lose fluids one way or the other,” and he was right, I sweat a lot, and my dad cried. I know tattoos are controversial for children. I know most tattoo artists wouldn’t tattoo a little girl even *with* parental permission. But this was a special case.

We had a koi pond in our old backyard. Oscar was obsessed with it. He used to spend hours of the day just staring into the water with a stupid little smile on his face. One time he jumped in to swim with them. He loved the koi, he wanted to be one of them I think. My mother dragged him out and explained that the koi needed their own space to stay healthy. He was disappointed, but understood. Dad teased him about it for a while, calling him ‘koi boy’. The name kinda stuck. 

He died two years later. He was only six years old.

I stared in amazement at my wrist when it was done. A simplistic, but beautiful koi fish. I suddenly felt so much. I don’t know which emotion it was, but it was so big. Tears were running down my face, and I was grinning so wide it hurt. My parents were teary eyed too when I looked over. They scooped me up in a big hug, and whispered, “This was a good idea, Kayla.” 

Those tattoos we got were pivotal in our grief. I’ve spoken with my parents at length, and they agree the healing didn’t really start until then. It might sound silly if you haven’t lost someone before, but getting better can almost feel like a betrayal. And those little, matching koi fish for our koi boy helped ease that guilt. It was a permanent reminder that he’s never really gone, not if we still remember. And talk about him. And share the funny stories and the home videos. Not if it’s permanently inked in our skin that we love him and we’ll never stop. It really did help. 

It still helps.

But every now and then, sporadically since the day we got those tattoos, I would wake in the night to an itching feeling. The place on my body wasn’t consistent. Sometimes my neck. Sometimes my stomach. Sometimes my face or back. The only real pattern was how maddening it was. I couldn’t sleep. I tossed and turned, and tried not to scratch. Then caved, made it worse, and tried not to scratch again. Those were long nights. 

I’ve seen several dermatologists in recent years. They all said similar things. Contact dermatitis from an allergy, or chemical irritant? Okay. I change my detergent, do an elimination diet, have Penny’s cat sleep outside the bedroom, and switch to organic everything. Things seem fine for a while. Then on a random work night it happens again. Worse. To the point I spend the night crying in frustration in Penny’s arms, and going to work the next day completely exhausted. I get a new Derm, a new diagnosis, and repeat. Then repeat again. And again. Nothing worked. And the bad nights grew closer together.

And then there was last night. 

I was curled up on the sofa with Reginald (the cat) in my lap. Penny was out of town visiting her sister, so I opted for a quiet night in. It was much later than I usually stayed up. I’d gotten distracted from the time rewatching a cartoon I used to binge as a kid. It was peaceful, honestly. Until a small, subtle itching started on my wrist. I scratched a bit and thought it would go away. But then it started moving. The itch didn’t go away and then reappear, it was like it was crawling through my arm. I paused the episode and looked down at myself, expecting some kind of rash or skin issue. But I was wrong. 

My breath caught in my throat. My wrist was empty. 

Panic instantly shot down my spine. My body shook, even my vision was unstable, like my eyes were trembling too. I was hyperventilating as I scanned up and down both arms, looking for something that wasn’t there. I sprang up from the couch, flinging Reginald off of me with a screech and ran to the bathroom. I slapped the light on and stood in front of the mirror, nails digging into the counter. And there, on my shoulder, was the tattoo. Somehow it was worse than if it was just gone. Gone could be a trick of the light or exhaustion, if I was really stretching to make this rational. But for the tattoo to MOVE? There genuinely isn’t an explanation for that. And to my horror, it moved again. The itching started and I watched the little fish on my shoulder, unable to breathe. It started to swim.

I gasped and clawed at my skin, slapping and scratching and *anything* to make it stop. But it didn’t stop for a second, unbothered. It was a part of my skin after all. Eventually I gave up, just crying and watching, feeling unsteady. Reginald was watching from the bathroom doorway, I saw him in the mirror. 

It was a sickening feeling. The koi fish traveled everywhere, its horrible itch going with it, a gentle, infuriating feeling. And I couldn’t do anything. It soon started lingering and circling on my chest, just below my collarbone. And right when I thought it might end, the fish dove below the surface, disappearing, and a realization hit me. 

It was that horrible itch. THIS was what it was. The reason the doctors couldn’t help, the reason it started fourteen years ago, the reason there was no rash or visible irritation. The reason every doctor said the only damage was something I’d done to myself. When the tattoo disappeared completely, and the itch grew so overwhelming I fell to the ground in tears, I just *knew* it had been this every time. I was going crazy. That had to be it. Because the alternative is somehow even worse.

It lasted all night, just like every other time. No sleep, I just hugged Reginald and sobbed. I’m completely drained. I tried taking a nap, but Reginald brushed me with his tail, and I woke in a panic, thinking it’d started again. I look terrible. I feel terrible. I am terrible. And maybe crazy. I don’t know what to do.

Penny comes back tomorrow, and I know she’ll notice how haggard I look. What do I even say to her?
