As ridiculous as this may sound, this post might be one of my last chances.

I’m sure one of you will comment that this website never actually existed in the first place before I refresh the page to find an error code and a link to purchase the domain name. But Reddit being willed out of existence is the least of my worries right now.

This is Graydon's fault.

I hadn't heard from Graydon in three months when he showed up at my apartment just last night.

He looked terrible. His usually neat brown hair was greasy and unkempt, hanging in stringy clumps around his face. Dark circles rimmed his eyes, and his clothes looked like he'd been sleeping in them for weeks. But what really bothered me was the way he kept glancing over his shoulder, like he expected someone to be following him.

"Do you remember me?" he said before I could even invite him inside.

I was confused. "Of course I do, Graydon. Where have you been? I've been texting you for months. Your mom said—"

"Please." He grabbed my arm, and I could feel his hand shaking. "I can't explain it here. You just have to trust me. There's something I have to show you."

We'd been friends since high school, and I'd never seen him like this. Graydon was the type of guy who planned everything three weeks in advance and color-coded his class schedules. Seeing him this frantic and desperate was genuinely unsettling.

"Okay," I said, grabbing my jacket as quietly as possible. Emma was already asleep, and I didn't want to wake her. I slipped my engagement ring off my finger and set it on the nightstand—no point risking losing it wherever we were going. "Where are we headed?"

"Whitmore Caverns. About an hour north of here."

I knew the place. A series of limestone caves that used to offer guided tours until they shut down in the '90s after a couple of accidents. The entrance was still accessible if you knew where to look, but most people stayed away. It wasn't exactly the kind of place you'd expect to visit at 10 PM on a Tuesday.

The drive was uncomfortable. Graydon barely spoke, just stared out the window and occasionally muttered something under his breath that I couldn't quite make out. When I tried to ask him what was going on, he'd just shake his head and say, "Not yet. You'll understand when we get there."

We parked at the old visitor center, now just a crumbling concrete building covered in graffiti. Graydon pulled two flashlights from his backpack and handed me one.

"Follow me," he said. "And don't say a word until we get deep enough."

"Deep enough for what?"

"Just don't talk. Please. It's important."

The entrance to the caves was hidden behind a cluster of overgrown bushes about fifty yards from the parking lot. Graydon moved through them like he'd done this before, leading me down a narrow stone pathway that disappeared into complete darkness.

The cave was bigger than I'd expected. The main passage was wide enough for us to walk side by side, with rough limestone walls that sparkled in our flashlight beams. Water dripped somewhere in the distance, creating an echo that made it impossible to tell how deep the cave system went.

We walked in silence for what felt like twenty minutes, descending steadily into the earth. The temperature dropped with each step, and I could see my breath forming small clouds in the beam of my flashlight. Graydon seemed to know exactly where he was going, never hesitating at the various branching passages we encountered.

Finally, he stopped in front of a section of wall that looked identical to every other section we'd passed. But when I got closer, I could see a small hole about the size of a baseball, carved into the limestone at eye level.

"Okay," Graydon said, his voice barely above a whisper. "Do you see the flame?"

I aimed my flashlight at the hole. It was just empty darkness, maybe six inches deep before the beam hit solid rock.

"Graydon, there is no—"

"Stop." He grabbed my wrist. "Don't tell me what is and what isn't. Just yes or no: Do you see a flame?"

His grip was tight enough to hurt, and there was something in his eyes that made me take a step back. This wasn't the Graydon I knew. This was someone on the edge of a complete breakdown.

"No," I said carefully. "I don't see a flame."

His face contorted with frustration. "Look again. Really look. Are you absolutely sure you don't see anything burning in there?"

I looked again, even though I knew it wouldn't change anything. The hole was empty. No flame, no light, nothing but limestone and shadow.

"I'm sure, Graydon."

That's when he grabbed my hand and shoved it into the hole.

The pain was immediate and excruciating. It felt like I'd grabbed a red-hot coal, a searing heat that shot through my palm and up my arm. I screamed and jerked my hand back, stumbling backward until I hit the opposite wall.

When I looked down at my palm, there was a perfect circular burn in the center, already starting to blister. The skin was angry red and felt like it was still on fire.

"What the hell, Graydon! Why did you—"

I looked back at the hole and froze.

There was a flame burning inside it.

A small, steady flame, maybe two inches tall, flickering gently like a candle in a draft. It cast dancing shadows on the walls around us, and I could feel the heat radiating from the opening.

"Do you see it now?" Graydon asked, his voice filled with desperate hope.

"I... yes. I see it."

That's when he lost it completely.

"YES!" he screamed, his voice echoing through the cave system. "I'm not alone anymore! I'm not crazy! Someone else can see it!"

He started shifting between hysterically laughing and crying within seconds of each other, spinning around in circles like a child. "Three weeks! For three weeks I've been living in this hell alone. But you see it now! You see the flame! I'm not alone!"

I was so focused on his manic celebration that I didn't notice him backing toward the cluster of rock behind him. He tripped over their jagged edges, and I watched in horror as he fell backward, his head striking the pointed tip of a limestone formation with a wet, sickening crack.

The sound echoed through the cave like a gunshot.

Graydon's body convulsed once, then went completely still. Blood pooled beneath his head, black in the flickering light of the flame that I could now see burning steadily in the wall.

It took me two hours to drag his body out of the cave system. He was heavier than I'd expected, and I had to stop every few minutes to rest and figure out which passage led back to the surface. The combination of sweat and tears in my eyes only made it harder to proceed. By the time I reached the parking lot, my clothes were soaked with Graydon's blood, and my burned hand was throbbing with every heartbeat.

I called 911 as soon as I had cell service.

The paramedics arrived first, followed by two sheriff's deputies who took one look at the scene and immediately started asking questions. I told them everything—about Graydon showing up at my apartment, about the cave, about the accident. I watched them load his body into the ambulance on a stretcher covered with a white sheet.

At the police station, they kept asking me the same questions over and over again. Why had we gone to the cave? What were we doing down there? How exactly had the accident happened?

I answered everything honestly, even though I could see the skepticism in their eyes when I mentioned the flame. They kept looking at each other with expressions I couldn't quite read—confusion, maybe, or suspicion.

After three hours of questioning, the chief of police came into the interview room with a folder in his hands.

"Look," he said, sitting down across from me. "I don't know what kind of game you're playing here, but we need to get this sorted out."

"I'm not playing any game," I said. "I told you exactly what happened."

He opened the folder and spread several photographs across the table. Crime scene photos of the cave, showing the exact spot where Graydon had fallen. But in every picture, there was no body. No blood. No evidence that anyone had died there.

"We found you 3 hours ago," he said. "Wandering around the parking lot, covered in blood and talking about your dead friend. But here's the thing—we searched every inch of those caves. There's no body. There's no evidence that anyone else was ever down there with you."

My heart started racing. "That's impossible. You put him in the ambulance. I watched you do it."

"Son, there was no ambulance. There was no body. And there's no record of anyone named Graydon living in this county."

I stared at the photographs, trying to make sense of what I was seeing. In the pictures, the limestone formation that had killed Graydon was clean and undamaged. No blood, no sign of impact.

"I don't understand," I whispered. "He was my friend. We went to high school together."

The chief leaned back in his chair. "Look, it's not illegal to report a false death, technically. But I don't understand what you're trying to accomplish here. Are you looking for money? Having some kind of mental crisis?"

"No, I—"

"We're going to let you go with a warning," he interrupted. "But if you come back here with any more stories about dead friends who don't exist, we're going to have a different conversation."

They released me an hour later, and I took a taxi home in a daze. Everything felt wrong, like I was living in someone else's life. I kept looking at the burn on my palm—the one piece of evidence I had that any of this had really happened.

When I got home, Emma was waiting up for me, curled on the couch in her pajamas.

"Vince! Thank God you're okay. What happened? You look terrible."

I sat down next to her and tried to explain everything—Graydon showing up, the cave, the accident, the police not believing me. She listened patiently, occasionally reaching over to touch my arm or smooth my hair.

"That sounds absolutely terrifying," she said when I finished. "I'm so sorry you went through that. But you're home now, and you're safe."

She stood up and kissed my forehead. "I need to be up early tomorrow, so I need to go to bed. You should get some rest too."

Before I knew it, I was waking up on the couch from a full night of sleep. It was unlike me to fall asleep so suddenly, but after last night, I wasn't too surprised. Sunlight was streaming through the windows, and I could hear birds chirping outside. Emma was already gone for work, but she'd left a note on the kitchen counter.

I picked it up and read the front: "I love you, sleepyhead."

I smiled despite everything that had happened and slipped the note into my pocket before heading out the door. I felt the need to maintain a sense a normalcy in all of this nightmare. I tried calling Graydon's phone on my way out twice, but was met with a dial tone each time.

My first stop was the corner store for my usual morning coffee. I'd been buying the same large coffee there every day for two years—always 99 cents, always from the same machine near the register. There was a hand-written sign that said "Coffee: ALWAYS 99 cents!" in faded black marker.

I put a dollar bill on the counter. "This should cover it."

He stared at the dollar like I'd just tried to pay with monopoly money. "Dude, you know that's not enough. Our Arabic coffee is $2.50."

"Good one, Mike." I said with a chuckle. "This coffee has always been 99 cents. I'm here all the time."

The cashier finally looked up at me with irritation. "Yeah, I know, Vince. You come in almost every day." He shook his head. "Our coffee has always been $2.50 and always will be. Are you feeling alright, man?"

I looked back at the coffee stand and read the sign again. "Arabic Coffee: $2.50 a Cup!" I shook off an intense shiver down my spine. I pulled the remaining $1.50 from my wallet but as I reached toward the cashier he pointed at my hand. "Hey, alright! You finally left her. Good for you! You're a free man, now."

Confused, I glanced down at my hand. I had forgotten to put my ring back on.

I laughed awkwardly, "Oh no. I just took my ring off last night because... well I just took it off." It felt like too much to explain at the moment and I was already running late for work.

"Sure thing, buddy." He gave me an exaggerated wink as he handed me the receipt before I headed back to my car.

At work, I tried to focus on my usual tasks, but I kept thinking about the strange interaction at the corner market. Around 10 AM, my coworker Dave stopped by my cubicle.

"Morning, Vince. You look tired," he said, glancing at my face.

Suddenly, an overwhelming wave of exhaustion hit me like a physical force. My eyelids felt heavy, and I had to grip my desk to keep from swaying.

"At least that tea will wake you up," Dave continued, nodding at the cup in my hand.

"It's actually coffee," I said, lifting the cup to take a sip.

But when the liquid hit my tongue, it was without a doubt tea. Earl Grey, hot and strong, with just a hint of bergamot. I instinctively spit it out.

I stared at the cup in confusion. I'd just bought coffee. I poured it myself. Even took a sip on the way here. But I was definitely drinking tea.

Dave had already walked away, leaving me staring at my cup and questioning my own senses. The exhaustion was getting worse, making it hard to concentrate on anything. I put my head down on my desk, just for a moment.

"Oh man, tired already?" Another coworker, Joan, was walking past with a stack of files. "It's only 10 AM. You can do this!"

The moment she said "you can do this," the exhaustion vanished completely. I sat up straight, feeling more alert and energized than I had all morning. It was like someone had just injected caffeine directly into my bloodstream.

I spent the rest of the day trying to focus on work, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something fundamental was wrong. The coffee becoming tea, the sudden exhaustion and equally sudden energy—it all felt connected somehow to what had happened in the cave.

I sent Emma a text around lunch: "Something funny happened with the clerk at the corner store today that will make you laugh. I'll tell you about it when I get home."

She didn't respond.

I tried again at the end of my shift: "Heading home now. Want me to pick you up anything?"

Still no response.

As I was packing up to leave, my boss Mr. Harrison appeared at my cubicle. He looked annoyed, which wasn't unusual, but there was something particularly hostile in his expression.

"Vince, we need to talk about your performance lately," he said, loud enough for half the office to hear. "Your work has been sloppy, you're making careless mistakes, and frankly, your attitude has been unprofessional."

"I'm sorry, sir. I know I've been distracted, but—"

"I don't want to hear excuses," he cut me off. "You're supposed to be a professional, but lately you've been acting like an amateur. At this rate, you're worthless to this company."

The word "worthless" hit me like a physical blow. I felt something shift inside me, a cold emptiness that seemed to spread through my chest.

My phone buzzed with a notification from my banking app. Then another. And another.

I pulled out my phone and saw multiple overdraft alerts. My checking account was showing a negative balance of $847. My savings account, which had over $3,000 in it yesterday, was showing zero. Even my emergency fund was completely empty.

"Sir, I—" I started to say, but Mr. Harrison had already walked away.

I sat at my desk for several minutes, staring at my phone and trying to understand how all of my money could have just disappeared. There were no transactions listed, no withdrawals or transfers. The money was simply gone, as if it had never existed in the first place.

When I got home, I knew something was wrong before I even opened the door. The apartment felt different—quieter, emptier somehow.

Inside, most of our furniture was gone. The dining room table Emma and I had picked out together, the bookshelf full of our combined collection, the framed photos of us from various trips and occasions—all of it had vanished. What remained was a single couch facing a large TV, a gaming console, with a stack of old pizza boxes and empty beer cans scattered across the floor.

"Emma?" I called out, but there was no response.

The words of the cashier echoed through my head, "*You finally broke up with her!*"

I tried calling her, my hands shaking as I dialed her number.

She picked up on the third ring, but her voice sounded different. Annoyed.

"Hello?"

"Emma, thank God. Where are you? What happened to our apartment? All our stuff is gone and—"

"What are you doing?" Her voice was cold.

The words hit me like a physical blow. "Emma, it's me. It's Vince."

There was a long pause. I could hear children playing in the background, and a man's voice saying something I couldn't make out.

"Look, Vince, I know it's you" she said finally, "but this isn't funny. If this is some kind of prank—"

"Emma, what are you talking about? We're engaged. We live together. We had dinner together two nights ago, and you made that pasta dish with the sun-dried tomatoes."

"Jesus Christ, you broke up with me 3 years ago, Vince" she said, her voice rising slightly. "I don't know how you got my new number, but you're acting insane. I should've known that was you texting me earlier today."

"Emma, please. I know this sounds crazy, but something is happening to me. You left me a note this morning. You wrote 'I love you, sleepyhead.' I have it right here in my pocket."

"I'm hanging up now. Don't call me back or I'll call the police."

"But Emma—"

"Fuck off, creep," she said, and the line went dead.

I collapsed to the floor, the phone falling from my hand. This wasn't possible. Emma and I had been together for two years. We'd gotten engaged six months ago. I had photos of us, text messages, emails—proof that we'd built a life together.

But when I looked around the apartment, there was no sign that a woman had ever lived here. No photos of us together, no second toothbrush in the bathroom, no clothes in the closet except my own.

I pulled out the note she'd left that morning, desperate for some proof that I wasn't losing my mind. The front still read "I love you, sleepyhead" in her familiar handwriting.

But as I watched, the ink began to fade. The letters grew lighter and lighter until they disappeared completely, leaving only blank paper.

I flipped the note over, and there was more writing on the back—words I hadn't noticed before:

"You're the only one for me."

The moment I finished reading those words, I heard the sound of crashing cars from outside. Multiple impacts, one after another, followed by the screech of metal and the hiss of steam from radiators.

But there were no screams. No shouts for help. Just the mechanical sounds of accidents without any human voices.

I rushed outside my front door and looked down toward the main street. Every car I could see had crashed—some into each other, some into parked vehicles, others veered off the road entirely. But all of them were empty, their engines still running, headlights cutting through the growing darkness.

The sidewalks were completely deserted. No pedestrians, no one running to help, no emergency responders. It was like every person in the city had simply vanished.

I ran further down the road, calling for anyone, but my voice echoed off empty buildings. Every storefront was dark, every window was empty. The only sounds were the distant hum of abandoned engines and the occasional car horn from vehicles whose drivers were no longer there to turn them off.

There was one horn that stood out though. It wasn't steady, it was hitting in bursts, as if someone was pounding on the steering wheel. I walked several blocks until I found a car that had flipped over on the side of the highway.

There was someone in the passenger seat.

My heart stopped when I realized who it was.

Emma was strapped inside the overturned vehicle, a large shard of glass from the windshield piercing her throat. Her foot was pressed against the steering wheel, causing the horn to sound with each spasm of her body. Blood was pooling beneath her, and her eyes were wide with terror and confusion.

The horn kept blaring.

She just kept kicking.

And kicking.

When she saw me approaching, her mouth moved like she was trying to speak, but only gurgling sounds came out. Blood bubbled from the wound in her neck, and her eyes—those beautiful green eyes I'd fallen in love with so many years ago—stared at me with a mixture of recognition and horror.

She knew who I was. In her final moments, I think she remembered.

I reached through the broken window, trying to help her, but there was nothing I could do. The glass had severed something vital, and I could only watch as the life faded from her eyes.

Her foot finally stopped pressing against the horn, and the sudden silence was deafening.

I'm writing this now, sitting in my empty apartment, surrounded by evidence of a life that apparently never existed. Everyone is gone—not just Emma, but everyone. The entire world has become empty except for me.

And I think I know why.

"*You're the* ***only one*** *for me.*"

I'm posting this in the desperate hope that someone, somewhere, is still out there. That maybe there's another person who touched the flame, who understands what's happening. If you're reading this, please comment. Please let me know I'm not alone.

Because if I am truly the only one left, I don't know how much longer I can handle this silence.

The flame is still burning in that cave. I can feel it calling to me, promising answers, promising an end to this isolation.

Maybe it's time to go back.

Maybe it's time to join Graydon and let someone else carry this burden.

Please. If you're reading this, just tell me you're real.

Tell me I'm not the only one left.
