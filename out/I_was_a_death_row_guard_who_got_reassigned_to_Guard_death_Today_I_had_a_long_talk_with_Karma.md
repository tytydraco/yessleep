Another wave of terror made it through me in a flash, like a fever or aftershocks following an earthquake. I didn't mind the tingling hands or shortness of breath. It was the stomach feeling I would do anything to stop. If you know, you know. I did some box breathing to calm myself. Navy Seals do that. It really works.

Slightly calmer, I picked up a pen to take notes (a bic, thank God. Last thing I needed was a quill and a pot of ink to contend with). Reading the prologue I realized the strange man wasn't a killer. Just a windbag I expected was living a *particularly* extensive lifetime by supernatural means. The strange man was a pretentious douche and he wrote like one. This is my Cliff's Notes version without all the jargon. If anyone can pivot from corporatese, it's me. 

Extraordinary inmates require extraordinary protocol. I’ll try to make it short and sweet.

DO NOT ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE. DO NOT KNOCK ON WALL INCESSANTLY, HOPING FOR A DOOR TO OPEN. YOUR DAY ENDS AT 5PM, A DOOR WILL OPEN (SOMEWHERE). 

YOU WILL PROBABLY FIND IT.

Death has total control of all mechanical processes in the facility. She has been relatively liberal with privileges, but beware of taking advantage–she offends easily and will proceed to what she refers to as a “clap back” that will be significantly unpleasant and cost precious resources while you recover in our infirmary.

To be fair, Death has supernaturally sensitive hearing. You are just annoying her with endless knocking. Know that it is not truly endless. She ends it. On a good day, she’ll kill you. On a bad day, she’ll stick you in a liminal space until you starve or lose the will to live while knocks from nowhere surround you for the rest of your days. 

WEAR PROTECTIVE GEAR AT ALL TIMES Skin on skin contact can be interpreted as a “brush with death”, leading to fatalities.

DO NOT TAUNT DEATH

OK? Ffs the last time that happened we got covid. Before that, the nuclear factory incident in Japan. And politics are wilding out, more than usual. We all see it.

ADDRESS HER AS LADY

Though she is known to use modern slang (thank the gods the “yolo” phase is over), she also shifts into what is believed to be an amalgamation of all human, animal, and non-human languages past and present. She appreciates old-fashioned courtesy. So call her Lady for the best chance at a conversation in English. 


NO MATTER HOW TEMPTED DO NOT KISS DEATH. THAT'S JUST OBVIOUS.

Death is objectively beautiful in her preferred form, a mixed-race waif with strikingly beautiful natural red lips, and cascading raven hair. Despite rumors, Death does not have black eyes, a bare skull, or empty eye sockets. She has pretty green eyes that gleam ember in times of high emotion.


I put down the bic, shaking my sore wrist.

There was a knock and a door existed itself. Then a voice, “little pig, little pig, let me in”. I almost peed my pants. Hey, I haven't even met this woman who apparently does whatever the fuck she wants and kills when her podcast is interrupted.

I kept my expression neutral. The girl in the door looked reminiscent of Quinn from Daria. Silky blonde hair my wife would call Alicia Silverstone in Clueless hair. “Moves like a dream. Probably always smells like roses”.  She had a lightly tanned face with a pinched nose, lithe
but chesty, perfectly lipsticked lips, and a hot pink curve hugging uniform that did not meet dress code standards. In place of an inmate number was a happy face. I don't know how, but the happy face looked smug. No, this isn't going anywhere icky. I immediately saw her as someone just like my daughter's friends trying to test boundaries. This wasn't the Lady. This was Karma. 

I stood up, offering my hand to shake. She pinched my ass. I gasped. “Miss! You are a minor! And I am a happily married man”! 

Her eyes widened and she begun to laugh, not with me but at me. Like it was the most hysterical thing she had ever heard. “Whew! You gave me a laugh. A real one. She clicked a small device and put it in her pocket. “I'll do you a solid later. Promise.”

“Lady Karma?”

“Just Karma is fine. Or Carme. Or Nemesis. Becky with the good hair. Regina George. But most people go by Karma. On Wednesdays, we wear pink. 

“Listen Shep, you've been a challenge for me.”

“Why does everyone know my name?”

”Oh. Sorry, Wilbur. You're one fine pig.”

“Stop.”

“The name Shepherd Reaper is very interesting in certain circles. Especially to people like me and my sister.”

“Why is it interesting? Who is your sister?”

“Ugh. That blind slut Justice. You know she ain't so disabled she can't feel that titty she leaves out of her dress. We got into a fight about you.”

“Excuse me, I'm a man of justice. I've devoted my entire life to it.”

“And that's why we fought. She didn't mind all those innocent men you killed just following orders or you're *little rebrand*, “carrying out the law”.

Justice didn't mind at all. You were following legal protocol. However. Colton Embry. #0003232, baby killer. Baby, 7 months old, died of blood loss from human inflicted bite marks and stab wounds. You knew the bites were female but said the opposite in evidence and intimidated the specialist to confirm the marks were male. You knew the aggressive scratches were from a hand with long, intricately bejeweled nails. Hell, you found one on the ground, probably because the cheap ho got them done at a chop shop for a blowie. No wonder it was crap glue. The point is, you let a killer go free and an innocent man die. Justice wants you to hang. Also, she wears aviators instead of the blindfold now and they look awful.”

I stepped in. “Well, these weirdos seem to think I'm an ok guy, and whatever shadowy correctional institution this is probably knows all that stuff too.

“They do. It's a plus for them. Shows loyalty. And they can leverage your wife's life to manipulate you. Blackmail you.

Again, terror.

*I*, unlike Justice, see nuance. I saw what Colton did to your daughter. I know you don't like to hear this but it's important, he killed her slow, with her own Christmas lights.”

“STOP.”

“Why? You're in law enforcement. You saw the autopsy report. Evidence of sexual assault. Burn marks consistent with cigarettes. Clutching her own knocked out teeth in her rigor mortised hand. Anal tears. 

Colton was her rich connected boyfriend before he got deep in drugs. Of course he would get off. But when you investigated the baby-eating cunt gf and found she did it–you made it your life to manufacture an overwhelming amount of evidence that fuckall to do with Colton, but sure as fuck got him on death row. That was you. And I made sure nobody realized. You killing your daughter's killer? Classic Karma. You needed *me*, not handcuffs. 

And I know why you tensed up when asked about botched execution. Mr. #1 Warden accidentally-on-purpose forgot to deliver the anesthetic. Embry got saline, a paralytic, and a drug to induce cardiac arrest. He burned but he couldn't move or scream, drowned in his own lungs, felt his heart explode. And you knew. Clock *that* tea.”

“How could you know all this?”

“Because I'm not a minor, stupid. I hung with the Fates in ancient Greece. I'm a universal concept since forever. I have say on when to cut the thread of life. I'm hot Santa. A low-key vigilante. That's why they keep me around. Death doesn't like my attitude–which I have never understood, I'm so chill–but I make sure she knows who the real ones are.”

“Am I a real one?

“You are. Real complicated. But do you understand? Justice would have had you burned at the stake for commiting I don't even know how many felonies that resulted in the slow painful death of an innocent man.”

“He wasn't inno_”

“I know,” she said, pointing to the happy face on her uniform. *Nuance*. That guy was a piece of shit. Your daughter wasn't the first, and his dad taught him all he knows.” (Note from Shep–this was news to me). 

When he died, she said, “I made it hurt.” 

“Thanks.”

An understanding passed between us. She wants universal justice over procedural justice. No wonder she wants to keep Death quiet and happy. 

She handed me a traditional black-and-white speckled composition book. “It's not as good as *my* burn book. They took that. But every day, sit quietly and think about all the stuff you've been letting slide. Like how you don't remember traveling from Texas to here, or back to your home. You had no onboarding forms, no W-2. No background check, no HR. No explanation of benefits. All you got was a 7 figure number and you volunteered your soul. We didn't fog your memory. What you call compartmentalizing is selective denial. Write everything in that book. It's only visible to you and me. We're going to work together, fill that donut hole in your brain.

I signed the composition book. Another strange sensation of pleasure that wasn't mine. 

“Lalalalaa, thanks, Babe. Talk soon. And remember–you’re in deep shit with a lot of problems. 

But I ain't one.”
