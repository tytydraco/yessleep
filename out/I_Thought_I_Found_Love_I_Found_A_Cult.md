I’m not sure where to start, but if I don’t get this out now, I might not have another chance.

It all started three weeks ago when I met George . I was at a furniture store nearby, killing time because their Christmas decorations are outlandishly pretty. Yes, I know. “What do you mean a furniture store has pretty decorative displays?” But my town is weird like that, and I’m not going to apologize for enjoying it.

That’s where I met *him*. George  struck up a conversation, charming and soft-spoken, with these dark eyes that felt intense and intoxicating in a rare sort of way. Before I knew it, we were exchanging numbers.

At first, it seemed innocent. George  texted me sporadically—nothing overbearing, just enough to keep me curious. We bonded over mutual tastes in books, weed, and horror movies. Insert eye rolls regarding the horror movies. Yes, I see the irony now that I’m posting this here, and yes, I love being a cliché. But who could blame me? It was those damn eyes of his and his quiet, almost reserved demeanor that drew me in. 

When he invited me over to watch *BoJack Horseman*, I figured, why not? I needed a distraction from my routine of doom scrolling LinkedIn, dodging memories, and procrastinating on job applications. It had been months since I’d worked, and while I tried to keep my chin up, the weight of it all was starting to feel suffocating. I needed a distraction and comedic adult cartoons seemed as good as anything. 

George ’s apartment was small but clean, with just enough furniture to make it functional. The sparse decor reminded me of the kind of place a guy like Patrick Bateman might live in, but I dismissed the thought as my usual paranoia. He handed me a glass of water as soon as I walked in, and while I usually prefer beer or nothing, I sipped it anyway.

We settled on his bed, the glow of the TV illuminating the dim room. I adjusted the hem of my blue and white striped Vineyard Vines top, glad I’d chosen something comfortable but cute. My black boots rested on the floor next to his nightstand, and I was already regretting wearing leggings in this stuffy apartment. George  sat close, but not too close, which I appreciated. I wasn’t sure if I wanted this to turn into something romantic, but I decided then that I wouldn’t mind if it did.

We were halfway through the second episode when there was a knock at the door. George  got up, his expression unreadable as he glanced at me.

“Expecting someone?” I asked, half-joking, taking a discreet puff from the weed pen I’d bought at the dispensary yesterday. Well, his back was turned. George  didn’t know I had it—I’d told him I only did edibles. It was the truth, usually. But like I said I had been extra stressed during this time period. 

He didn’t answer. He opened the door just wide enough for me to see a tall, muscular guy with shaggy blonde hair and piercing blue eyes standing in the hallway. The guy stepped inside without waiting for an invite, carrying a pizza box. I squinted, trying to place his familiar looking face. 

“Ella, this is Diezel,” George  said casually, but something about the way he said it made my stomach knot. 

“Hey,” I said, forcing a smile. “You didn’t mention you were having company.”

Diezel didn’t respond. He just stared at me, his gaze lingering on my chest for a bit too long.

“Relax, Ella,” George  said, sitting back down beside me. “Diezel’s an old friend.”

“Great,” I muttered under my breath, rolling my eyes and reaching for my glass. The room felt smaller with Diezel in it. Something about him tugged at the edges of my memory. Then it hit me. Like a truck. Events and Adventures. A dating group for singles. We hooked up once last year, and then he ghosted me. My stomach churned.

Things shifted after that. George ’s easy going demeanor turned... off. His smile was still there, but it didn’t reach his eyes. Diezel didn’t bother pretending at all.

“You don’t seem like George ’s type,” Diezel said, leaning against the counter, his voice arrogant and teasing.

“What’s that supposed to mean?” I shot back, trying to sound braver than I felt.

“She’s feisty,” Diezel smirked at George . “You didn’t tell me she’d be fun.”

“Fun?!” I screamed as loud as I could, hoping to alert neighbors. Neither of them flinched. But I knew it was time to leave the apartment. But my feet felt like cinder blocks. 

George  chuckled darkly. “I wanted to keep it a surprise.”

My pulse quickened. “What the FUCK is going on?” I stood up, heart pounding.

George  grabbed my wrist, his grip like iron. “Sit down, Ella.”

“Fuck you,” I snapped, yanking my arm away. “You don’t even know me.”

“Oh, I know enough,” George  said, his voice tight. “Everyone’s seen all that footage of you, all those texts. You’re not such an honest person, are you?” And to make his point he grabbed the lavender weed pen out of my pocket and held it in front of me. “But you’re a saint right? You don’t even smoke.” He laughed, mockingly. 

The words hit me like a punch. I froze. It was the same tone, the same implication I’d heard before—countless times in whispers I wished I could erase. From the daycare, from high school, from every moment I had tried to bury. I couldn’t breathe. 

George  shoved me back into the couch. I internally sighed, screamed, and rolled my eyes... realizing these corny little boys were trying to do some sort of good cop bad cop routine. “Don’t make this harder than it needs to be.”

Diezel moved closer, pulling out a knife. The blade gleamed in the dim light. “Sit down,” he said coldly, pressing the knife to my throat.

I froze, the cold steel biting into my skin and drawing enough blood to get me to stop struggling against it.

“She’s going to be a problem,” Diezel muttered, not moving the blade. But instead shifting his other hand to the gun I was now noticing in his pocket. 

“She’ll learn,” George  said, his voice eerily calm. “We all had to, once,  remember?”

Diezel smiled wickedly, then pulled a syringe from his pocket.

“What the—” I screamed, but Diezel clamped a hand over my mouth, plunging the needle into my arm. My pink iPhone 15 clattered to the floor, the last tether to anything familiar.

When I woke up, my head throbbed like it had been squeezed in a vise. The fluorescent lights above me buzzed faintly, casting a sterile glow on the room. I tried to sit up, but my wrists were bound to the armrests of a cold, metal chair. Panic surged through me as I realized my boots were gone, my shirt’s neckline was stained red, and my leggings felt damp from the floor.

“Good morning,” a soft, feminine voice cooed somewhat menacingly from somewhere behind me. 

I craned my neck to see a petite woman with blonde hair tied into a tight bun. She wore a crisp white blouse and beige slacks, the kind of outfit you’d expect on someone running a seminar about mindfulness. Her smile was disarming, almost motherly, but her eyes held something cold, calculating. Obviously, I was not matching her confident, relaxed energy. 

“Where am I?” I demanded, my voice hoarse, my wrists struggling to find a way out of the restraints. 

“Safe,” she replied, stepping closer. “For now.” With a wink, she placed a manicured hand on my shoulder, and I flinched. My legs strained but the restraints were made of strong stuff. 

“Who the fuck are you?”

“That does not matter right now. George and Diezel thought you could use some guidance. A little reprogramming.”

Reprogramming. The word hit me like a slap, and a memory surfaced—an article I’d written months ago about a pretty notorious cult, which had used similar vocabulary. They’d used words like “recruitment,” “rebranding,” and “personal growth” to justify horrific abuses. And now one of their founders was standing right in front of me.

“You have no idea how lucky you are,” she continued, crouching so we were eye level. “Most people don’t get a second chance. But Diezel saw potential in you. A spark. And that’s why you’re here.” 

I thrashed against the restraints, my breathing ragged. “Let me go! You can’t keep me here!”

“Shhh,” she hushed, pressing a finger to her lips. “Resistance is natural at first. We’ve all been there. But you’ll understand soon enough. You’ll thank us.” She winked and I rolled my eyes. 

The door creaked open, and George  stepped in, his dark eyes void of the warmth they once held. He was followed by Diezel, who leaned casually against the wall, a infuriatingly smug grin plastered on his face. George ’s gaze met mine.

“Are you fucking stupid? I have roommates. Friends. The cops will be here in minutes.” But everyone, especially George  looked un phased, he let out a slow exhale, as if disappointed.

“Ella,” George  said, his voice low and steady. “This doesn’t have to be difficult.”

“Go to hell” I spat, the words burning my throat. “You’re sick. All of you.”

The woman chuckled softly, standing up and smoothing her blouse. “Oh, George , she’s spirited. I like that. It’ll make the transformation all the more rewarding.”

Diezel pushed off the wall, crossing the room with slow, deliberate steps. He picked up my pink iPhone 15 from a nearby table and held it up, inspecting it like a curious child.

You’ve run away without notifying your parents before, and it’s believable you’d do it again. Your friends know how flighty and distant you can be, so no, no one will actually care. Nice phone, by the way,” he said, flipping it over in his hand. “Too bad you won’t be needing it anymore.” He finished sending something before tossing it to the ground and smashing it.

“What do you want from me?” I asked, my voice trembling despite my effort to sound defiant.

George stepped closer, his face inches from mine. “We want you to let go. Of your lies, your past, your so-called independence. You’ve been living in a prison of your own making, Ella. We’re offering you freedom.”

“Freedom?” I sneered. “You drugged me and tied me to a chair. That’s your idea of freedom?”

The blonde woman sighed, shaking her head. “It’s always hardest for the ones who’ve been hurt the most. But that’s why we’re here. To help you heal. To teach you how to be truly honest with yourself and others.”

I glared at her, my mind racing. Every fiber of my being screamed at me to fight, to scream, to do something. But the cold metal against my skin and the presence of George and Diezel made it clear that any attempt would be futile.

“What happens if I don’t cooperate?” I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

Her smile faltered, and for a split second, her mask slipped. Her eyes narrowed, and she leaned in close, her breath warm against my ear.

“You don’t want to find out,” she said, her voice a chilling blend of sweetness and menace.

Diezel placed my phone back on the table and pulled out a small black device. He pressed a button, and a red light blinked to life.

“Smile for the camera,” he said mockingly. “This is just the beginning.”

My heart pounded as the reality of my situation sank in. Whatever they had planned, it wasn’t just about me. They wanted to use me to break someone else, and I didn’t know if I had the strength to stop them. But I knew one thing: I wasn’t going down without trying.

The door swung open again, and a new figure entered the room. She was tall, with sharp features and an air of authority that made the blonde woman step back, her demeanor suddenly deferential.

“What’s the holdup?” the woman demanded, her voice cutting through the room like a blade.

Bone straightened, his expression tense. “She woke up later than we anticipated. We needed to use more GHB because she was so... agitated.”

The woman’s eyes locked onto mine, and a chill ran down my spine. There was something eerily familiar about her, something that made my stomach twist. She tilted her head, studying me like a predator sizing up its prey.

“Ella,” she said, her lips curling into a predatory smile. “You’re going to be very useful to us.”

I scoffed, leaning back against the cold wall. “Useful? Please. If you’re recruiting people like Diezel, this whole thing must be a scam. A club for failures who need to lie to themselves about how much of a loser they are.”

Diezel flinched, his face darkening. He stepped closer, and I couldn’t resist twisting the knife a little further.

“You know, it makes sense now why you ghosted me after that hookup,” I sneered, my voice dripping with venom. “You always did seem nerdy and pathetic. The Star Wars posters? Yeah. You probably realized I was out of your league.”

George’s jaw tightened, and Diezel’s hands curled into fists at his sides. I knew I was playing a dangerous game, but the anger bubbling inside me didn’t care. My heart raced as I locked eyes with Diezel, daring him to respond.

“You really think you’re better than us, don’t you?” Diezel hissed, his voice low and trembling with rage. “You have no idea what you’re talking about.”

“Oh, I think I do,” I shot back, crossing my arms. “You’re all just a bunch of desperate nobodies playing pretend. Your leader is a washed-up, B-level at best, failed actor, turned scammer. This whole operation is a joke.”

That did it. Diezel lunged forward, grabbing my arm with bruising force. “Shut your mouth,” he growled.

The woman raised a hand, her expression calm but her eyes blazing with amusement. “Enough, Diezel. She’s just scared. Let her have her little tantrum.”

But Diezel wasn’t listening. His face twisted with fury as he pulled a cloth from the table. “You’re going to learn some respect,” he spat, shoving it against my face.

The sickly sweet smell of chemicals filled my nose, and I thrashed against his grip, but his strength was unrelenting. My vision blurred, the edges darkening as my limbs grew heavy. The last thing I saw before the darkness claimed me was the woman’s cold, satisfied expression.
