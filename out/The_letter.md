My dear boy,

If you are reading this, the priests have read me the holy rites and I am dead. I am writing to let you know what you must do and why.

When I was a young man I entered into a seminary in Rome. I was widely considered one of the brightest and acclaimed students in the school. It was assumed I would become a priest and work my way up to eventually becoming the bishop in some place where the holy church could make use of my talents. It was therefore a bit of a surprise when I was suddenly sent to the Vatican to meet with the archbishop of Rome and the office of the grand inquisitor.

After the introductions were made I was told a frightful story sent to Rome from the abbot of  a Jesuit monastery in Romania. 

An evil wizard less than a days ride from the monastery was said to have conjured the demon Baal, who was dictating book of spells to the wizard. If recited at midnight on the winter solstice, a spell in the book would give him complete control over every man, woman and child within a thousand miles. While the spell would only last a year so long as a virgin were sacrificed on the day of the solstice the spell would be renewed so long as the incantation were also recited at midnight.

The thought of the mind of every person within a thousand miles being in complete control of a single person indefinitely was to terrifying to contemplate. Because of my reputation as a brilliant scholar in the peak of my youth led head if my seminary to recommend that I be trained to go to Romania.

It was 9 months till the winter solstice which gave me 6 months to prepare, and 3 months to reach the wizard  to dispatch Baal back to hell, kill the wizard and destroy forever the awful book.To this end I spent 8 hours a day studying with the most experienced excorsists in the church. After a Short period for rest and prayer I spent the next 4 hours studying with the finest swordsmen who could be hired train me.

The 6 months past in a blur with hardly an hour of time to my own pursuits. To important was my mission. At last I was given a 6 fast horses and a sturdy solid carriage driven by an experienced driver and I departed.

We rode the horses to near exhaustion every day till we reached some distant monastery. There I would spend the night and exchange horses at first light. I would be given a basket of food for the next day and at noon my driver and I would stop somewhere say a prayer and have lunch till we reached the next  monastery. My driver knew the path intimately and we never got lost or spent the night in the ever thickening forest. So we continued without event till we reached the Jesuit monastaryabout the beginning of December.

 The abbot who had sent word to the Vatican welcomed me. My driver departed to Rome without delay. I was shown my small cell where I prayed and slept. I took meals with the other monks.  The abbot showed  me a map of the area that marked the castle where the wizard lived and communed with demons.

On the 15th, I left the monastery with the blessing of the Abbot and the hope that I could defeat the wizard and destroy the book lest every soul in a thousand miles be under his evil spell for his foul purposes and some poor virgin sacrificed yearly to maintain his realm. 

 The training I had received proved more than adequate for Baal fled from me immediately after I read the sacred rites. The wizard was an old man and he fell by my sword just as quickly. The book of spells was fascinating and before destroying it I sat in the library and read for many hours before deciding what to do next. 

So here at the end of my days, my son, I wish you to understand why it is necessary to sacrifice a virgin on the day of the winter solstice and recite the spell just as I have done since that fateful day when I inherited my kingdom here in the heart of Romania.
