I just moved into this old place in London had to be from 18 or 19th century So I started to go through the attic just to clean up and repair but I found this letter it’s very old and ripped but I managed to figure out what was being said I asked around and people don't seem to want to talk about it maybe you all can help it seems like the rambles of a mad man but here is what is says “My Dearest Eliza,

It is with trembling hands and a mind burdened by dread that I pen these words to you. I implore you, do not dismiss this missive as the ravings of a man unhinged, for what I am about to recount is the absolute truth, and my very soul depends on your belief.

For months now, I have sensed an otherworldly presence shadowing my every step. The specter that haunts me is no mere figment of a troubled mind, but a wraith of unimaginable terror. The people of Whitechapel speak of it in hushed tones, calling it the Wraith of Whitechapel, a creature born of the deepest shadows, a monster that thrives on fear and despair.

It began with a chill, an unnatural cold that seeped into my bones as I walked the fog-bound streets. At first, I dismissed it as a consequence of the biting winter, but soon the signs became undeniable. I would catch fleeting glimpses of a gaunt figure, eyes glowing with an eerie luminescence, disappearing into the mist whenever I tried to approach. At night, as I lay in bed, the whispers would come, soft and insidious, calling my name.

Last night, the wraith drew closer than ever before. As I wrote by candlelight, I felt its presence materialize in the corner of my study. I turned, and there it was—a spectral form, pale and ethereal, hovering just beyond the reach of the light. Its hollow eyes bored into mine, and I felt an overwhelming wave of dread.

"Leave me be," I pleaded, though my voice was barely more than a whisper. "What do you want?"

The wraith smiled, a ghastly sight that chilled my very soul. "I seek not your body, but your mind," it hissed. "You are mine, a writer whose words will carry my legend far and wide. Your despair will feed me, and your fear will be my sustenance."

Desperation seized me, and I reached for the revolver I keep in my desk drawer. But as I aimed, the wraith dissolved into the shadows, leaving me alone and trembling. I knew then that no weapon of man could banish this horror.

Eliza, I write to you now, not only to warn you but to leave behind a testament of my ordeal. Should I disappear, as others before me have, know that it is the wraith that has taken me. I beg of you, protect yourself and our children. Do not come to Whitechapel; do not search for me. The wraith is relentless and will stop at nothing to consume the light within us.

Pray for me, dearest love, and believe my words. For though the wraith may have claimed my body, my spirit clings to the hope that my warning will save you from the same fate.

Yours in eternal fear and love,

Jonathan” As I reread this I hear my name and the room has gotten cold I feel watched I hear the creaking of the floors I see a shadow as I walk down these haunting halls the house energy has shifted am I going mad help me..I fear I am next
