When I was 18 my friends Timmy, Mike and Dalton wanted to explore abandoned places, we caught wind about this abandoned school for troubled youth in upstate Maine. Timmy, mike and Dalton wanted to go the upcoming weekend, I was hesitant about going.

I talked around with some people who’ve been there before, and each once of them looked me dead in the eye and said that it’s haunted and to be careful with what I say and do. After my friend where haggling me to go I gave in. 

Timmy and mike pile into my truck we started on are hour long drive. Dalton wanted to drive separate and meet us there. Timmy and I where talking about this school and how he was hesitant to go as-well. Mike occasionally chimed in saying where both pussys and there’s nothing to worry about. 

We where about 20 minutes away when Dalton called and started talking about how he’s going to call out these so called ghosts, just to see if ghosts are real. With Timmy and I both saying we should just go and walk around and look at things then leave. 

I pull in to a small dirt lot up the road, we wait for Dalton. We all fall out of the truck to stretch are legs and to take a piss. As we all secretly enjoy the cool night air we hear dalton’s trashed Chevy screaming down the road. We all group up and grab flash lights, then we head into the woods.

As all 4 of us pop out of the woods and stare at this massive school. When Dalton breaks the silence by yelling out “if there any ghosts here go fuck your self”. I look over and Timmy and we both look a Dalton I respond with “Dalton……….shut the fuck up”. Mike pushed by me and Timmy headed right for the open window, so we all follow.

We all crawl through the window and start going through the rooms and just taking it all in. Mike and Dalton break off and I can hear them both yelling and screaming for ghosts to show themselves, challenging them. Timmy and I start going through the rooms looking at the scattered papers and the air on the walls. Timmy looks at me and goes “I’m going to start taking pictures just to see if I can get anything”.

Timmy and I slowly make are way through the hallways with the occasional camera shutter. We stopped hearing mike and Dalton but knowing there up to no good. As Timmy and I both got bored and started to make are way back to the truck. Texting mike that where heading back to the truck.

As Timmy and I crawl back into the truck we start reviewing the photos Timmy took. Spotting that he did catch something, a dark outline in the corner of the room. We sit there both freaked out and on edge, we start to hear mike and dalton loudly make there way through the woods. Mike a Dalton pop out of the woods talking about if they had to chose how they die what way would they pick. 

Dalton and mike both picked if they could pick a way to die they would want to crash into a tree. Timmy and I showed them the picture we took which freaked them out too. At this point we all wanted to go home so Timmy and I crawled back into my truck as mike and Dalton got into daltons truck. Following Dalton and mike down a 2 lane road Timmy and I where talking about how freaked out we where.

Driving down the road listening to music we see dalton truck pull away as he speeds up. We lose daltons tail lights through the windy back roads we come around the bend to see daltons truck sitting in the middle of the road. Steam bellowing out from the truck as mike kicks the door open, Timmy and I both mumble fuck.

Once we calm Dalton and mike down we ask what happened and Dalton coldly looks at me goes “idk it pulled into the woods I couldn’t fight it”. I am screaming on the inside completely freaked out trying to keep a calm demeanor to calm everybody down. The cops come and do a report as well as the tow truck comes and takes the truck. We all pile into my truck, it was a silent ride home while I drop everybody off and head home myself.

Later that night Dalton and mike both frantically text me saying that something followed them home. That now weird thing are happening, that there dogs are barking at the wall and they feel the there being watched. As well as door slamming and foot steps, I didn’t know how to respond so I just told them that there just freaked out and to get some sleep.

This is a true story mike and Dalton both still have weird things happening to them. Mike crashed his truck into a tree a week later under unknown reasons.
