They say sleep is the safest place on Earth — a private darkness where nothing can touch you.  
That’s a lie.

Sleep is not rest. It’s a door.

When we dream, our minds wander, but our bodies stay behind — empty houses waiting for something to come home. Every night, billions of us slip into paralysis and hope that whatever visits, whatever watches, will leave when morning comes.

Doctors call it “sleep paralysis.”  
Spiritualists call it “crossing the veil.”  
The truth is probably worse than both.

The case I’m about to share came from a missing person’s file that was quietly closed in 1991.  
The investigator’s name was **Abby Dubberlan**, a sleep technician and young mother who took on an unusual home visit in rural Oklahoma. The report was never officially submitted. Instead, her handwritten notes were found in a bloodstained notebook beside a child’s toy.

The toy’s brand and model don’t exist in any catalog.

What follows is her *unedited field log*, transcribed from recovered pages. The original handwriting becomes erratic near the end. Investigators marked several time stamps where they believe she was interrupted.

Read it if you want.  
But if you do — **don’t fall asleep tonight.**



Field Log — June 6, 1991

**Subject:** Drake ██████  
**Observer:** Abby Dubberlan  
**Location:** █████ County, Oklahoma



When I first met Drake, he came across as your typical six-year-old boy.  
Sweet. Shy. Polite.  
The kind of child who folds his napkin and says “thank you” for a glass of water.

Nothing stood out as odd — except how quiet the house felt.

His mother, Sarah, looked exhausted. There were deep shadows under her eyes, the kind that don’t come from a bad night’s sleep but from *too many* of them. She said Drake’s episodes began shortly after they moved here, after... what she called *the incident* with his father. She wouldn’t elaborate.

The house itself was small — two bedrooms, one bath, but it felt wrong somehow. No clocks ticking. No hum from the fridge. Just the steady creak of wood, like it was breathing along with us.

Every wall had crosses or scripture verses pinned to it.  
When I asked if she was religious, she told me *no.*  
Said they “just help keep things quiet.”

That’s when I started noticing the locks — not on the *outside* doors, but on **Drake’s bedroom door.** Heavy, metal, bolted from the hallway side. His window had burglar bars that didn’t match the frame.

She said it was to “keep him safe while he sleeps.”

I tried to laugh. She didn’t.

Drake followed me through the house with a toy clutched to his chest — a plastic werewolf missing one eye. He called it *Fred.* Every room we entered, he introduced Fred like a guest.

“This is where we fix bodies for Fred to eat. Yum!”

He said it sweetly, almost singing, his small hand rubbing his belly.  
Sarah didn’t even flinch. She’d heard it before.

Something about the way that toy stared at me — always facing my direction, even when I didn’t remember turning it — left a cold pressure behind my eyes.

I told myself it was just nerves.  
It wasn’t.

Field Log (Continued)



**Time:** 7:13 PM  
**Conditions:** Calm. Clear.  
**Temperature:** 73°F indoors — dropping.



Sarah was called into her night shift sooner than expected. She hesitated at the door, keys trembling in her hand.

“Lock him in if you need to,” she whispered. “You’ll understand.”

Her eyes didn’t meet mine.  
Then she left.

It was just me, Drake… and Fred.



**7:45 PM**  
Drake was surprisingly obedient — brushed his teeth, cleaned up after dinner, and even said grace on his own. He didn’t speak much, except to the toy.

“Fred’s tired. But not sleepy yet.”

His voice had that strange matter-of-factness that children use when they don’t realize they’re saying something impossible.

I noted that the air was colder near his chair than anywhere else in the room. Could’ve been a vent.  
Could’ve been.



**8:32 PM**  
We talked while the TV murmured. I asked about his dreams.  
He said sometimes they were “movies that never end.”

“They start nice,” he said, “but then they get stuck.”  
“Stuck?”  
“Like… the people can’t wake up, so they keep screaming.”

When he mentioned “the monster that looks like Daddy,” his tone shifted from fear to familiarity — like he’d accepted it. Like it visited often.

I tried to steer the conversation toward his toy, to see if “Fred” was an extension of that trauma.

“Fred came from there,” he said simply. “From the dream place.”

His gaze didn’t break.  
Neither did Fred’s.



**9:00 PM**  
Bedtime.  
Sarah’s written note said “No exceptions.”

Drake begged to stay up for a horror special at 10.  
I shouldn’t have agreed, but his smile was bright enough to make me forget every warning I’d just heard.

He curled up on the couch, toy in hand. Static flickered on the old TV screen. The picture stabilized into a cheaply made werewolf film — exactly what I didn’t need before a long night.



**10:07 PM**  
Drake was transfixed.  
Fred sat upright beside him on the coffee table, its one glassy eye catching the screen’s light.

Every so often, I could swear the toy had turned slightly — just enough that I could see its teeth.

I blinked and it was still again.

I told myself to relax. Imagination. Lighting. Pareidolia.  
Still, I made a note: *Possible RBD onset approaching — minor tremors in subject’s fingers.*



**10:43 PM**  
Drake fell asleep mid-scene. The TV kept playing.  
When I bent to lift him, the temperature dropped — a sharp, visible mist when I exhaled.

The channel glitched. For half a second, the screen showed what looked like a dark hallway, not part of the film.

Then static.

Then nothing.

I reached for the remote. That’s when I heard it.

A wet, slow **gurgle** — behind me.

The sound of something breathing wrong.

“Drake?”

No answer.

Dark, squiggling shadows pooled around his body like ink bleeding through the carpet.

When I turned back toward the coffee table—

Fred was gone.



**10:51 PM**  
My arms prickled with cold. The air hummed — a low, electrical tone you don’t hear so much as *feel* in your teeth.

I tried to move Drake, but he was impossibly heavy — not limp, not rigid, just wrong. Like gravity was thicker around him.

“Drake, wake up.”  
“Drake!”

His eyes snapped open all at once.

“Is the movie over?”

I nearly cried with relief.

He smiled, sleepy but calm.

“You stopped it too soon,” he murmured. “Fred was almost done.”



**11:00 PM**  
He wanted to keep watching. I gave him five more minutes. I shouldn’t have.

He stared blankly at the screen until it ended. Then he turned to me, still holding the toy.

“You were wrong,” he said softly. “The monster lived.”  
“It’s just a story, sweetheart.”  
“No,” he said. “It’s a dream. And it’s still hungry.”

For a moment, I thought about my daughter back home. She’d be curled up under her pink blanket, safe, breathing softly. I promised I’d call before midnight. I should’ve called by now.

  
**11:26 PM**

Drake’s asleep again.  
At least, I think he is.

His breathing doesn’t sound right — too slow, too… *thick.* Every inhale rattles like there’s someone else inside his lungs trying to get out. I tried waking him once more, but his eyes rolled under their lids like they were tracking movement only he could see.

Fred’s back on the floor, lying face-up toward the ceiling.  
The toy’s mouth is open wider than before. I checked — the plastic doesn’t bend like that.

I should have left an hour ago.  
But I promised Sarah I’d watch him through the night.



**11:52 PM**  
Temperature’s dropping again — I can see my breath. The walls are making a sound like… chewing. A damp, pulpy sound that moves in circles around the room.

I heard the locks on Drake’s door *click* on their own.

I swear to God, I didn’t touch them.

The refrigerator hummed for a moment, then stopped mid-cycle. The house went completely still. Even the crickets outside went silent, as if something larger had just arrived. The air smells metallic — like coins and old blood. The light bulb keeps flickering, and every time it goes out, I see a shape standing where Drake’s shadow should be. It bends when he doesn’t.

The wall clock read 11:12. When I blinked, it said 12:09. My wristwatch still said 11:12.



**12:07 AM**  
Something just whispered behind me.  
Sounded like *me.*  
Same voice.  
Same words I’m writing.

I dropped my pen, but when I picked it up again, there was handwriting already there — my handwriting — words I didn’t write:

“Stop waking him. He’s dreaming of you now.”

I want to scream but I can’t. The sound gets swallowed before it leaves my throat. The room eats noise.



**12:10 AM**  
He’s standing up.

Not walking.  
Just… standing.

His eyes are open, but they’re too dark, like the pupils swallowed everything else.

“Drake,” I said.  
No answer.

He turned his head slow, like it hurt. The smile that followed wasn’t his.

For a heartbeat, I saw my reflection move behind his eyes — not as a trick of light, but as if something had replaced him with me.

“Fred’s done playing,” he said. “It’s your turn now.”

Then he started laughing — a bubbling, breathless laugh that didn’t match the shape of his mouth.

I’m hiding under the desk. I don’t know what’s happening to him.  
Something’s wrong with the walls — they’re *moving.*  
Breathing.



**12:16 AM**  
If anyone finds this—

I’m tired. But not sleepy yet.

I can hear him inside the walls, humming through my hands as I write.

If anyone finds this— the sound— it’s learning how to use my voice to travel.  
It’s finishing my thoughts before I do.

It’s colder now.  
Everything smells like pennies and wet fur.

Something’s scratching at the door — not to get in, but to keep something *in here with me.*

Drake’s humming.  
He doesn’t blink.

The shadows are longer now.  
They look like *hands.*

He’s walking toward me.

He’s whispering something.

It sounds like—

*(line trails off in ink and pressure marks)*



Post-Incident Summary (Extracted from police file #06-1991)

When investigators entered the residence two days later, they found no trace of Abby Dubberlan or the child known as “Drake.” The house showed signs of internal damage consistent with violent struggle — deep gouges in wood and plaster, originating from inside the locked bedroom.

The floorboards beneath the bed were warped by heat, though no fire occurred.

A melted wristwatch was recovered from the desk area, hands stopped at **12:17 AM.**

On the wall above the bed, written backward in soot and graphite:

“Don’t wake him.”

A single toy was discovered on the floor nearby.

It was not a werewolf.



**Editor’s Note (Recovered 2025)**

In 2004, a figure matching the toy’s description was reportedly found at a thrift store fire in Tulsa. The store’s CCTV footage froze at 11:12 AM — same as Abby’s watch. File DRAKE\_IS\_SLEEPING reopened briefly in 2005, then sealed again under directive 42-C.
