# 1. Who am I and why am I here?

I should have realized sooner that something was wrong. But even now, after everything that happened, I still struggle to comprehend. What has happened to me during the last few months has left me constantly anxious but despite everything, I keep telling myself, that there is a perfectly rational explanation. An unfortunate set of circumstances. Coincidences, dreadfully strange but still within the realm of possibility. A bunch of people going missing in the sewers sounds like your average urban legend after all.

 

Phrasing it like that, sounds like the understatement of the century. A lot more than that has happened and even if my mind keeps trying to reassure me, my gut knows, it’s wrong. I cannot shake the sense of foreboding. Like something is approaching, something horrid and inevitable. And I can’t just sit idly, waiting for it to come. Here, no one can keep me from talking. No one can keep me from remembering and sharing a story that everyone else seems to disregard. And maybe, if I happen to vanish too, you might know, where to find me.

 

My name is Derek Polloni. About half a year ago, my company offered a handsome raise for me to transfer to a city called Uridach to replace a college of mine that had injured himself working the sewers. A few weeks later I arrived there by train. Most of my personal belongings had already been moved to my new appartement at that time. Never have I regretted anything more than making that city my home.

 

# 2. Uridach

I had only seen parts of the city before. In between inspecting my new appartement, introducing myself to the landlord and ordering some mediocre takeout while moving in my stuff, there had been no time to familiarize myself with my new surroundings. I wouldn’t describe myself as a particularly adventurous guy. I didn’t care much for the history of the place. Money was my main reason for moving. When I exited the train, bags full of my remaining belongings, the reason for my generous raise suddenly hit me. Right in the nose.

 

I’m a sewer worker. I’m used to a lot. Still, the stench of concentrated piss and heavy vomit that crept from the subway stations almost had me gagging. It looked like service had been discontinued some time ago. Flimsy metal fences had half-heartedly been erected in front of the tunnel entries, which seemingly had become a shelter for the homeless. Homeless, of which there were many. Dishevelled looking, glassy-eyed, loudly talking to themselves, mostly unintelligible.

 

During my twenty-minute-walk towards my new home, I was approached for money at least five different times. Maybe because my baggage made them think I was a tourist with money to spend. Maybe because Uridach was already testing my character.

I refused them. Until my next paycheck, I was living on a budget. Rent was low at least, making me hopeful about being able to save some money in the near future.

 

My landlord welcomed me, when I arrived. We exchanged first names, then talked a bit about the homeless situation after he, Henry, had asked me a leading question about my first impressions.

 

“It’s because of the proximity to the bigger cities”, he explained to me. “The dealers handle their customers during the train rides. The junkies then depart in Uridach to get their fix. They know the police has given up on handling the situation at the subway stations a long time ago.”

 

I remember telling him about my last place of living. A city much bigger than Uridach, that was no stranger to poverty and crime. On one of our routine inspections, we had discovered a settlement of tents and tarps in the canals. A town of the unfortunate, hidden below the city, just out of sight.

Henry had frowned a little, when I told him. A gesture I didn’t pay any mind to until much later.

 

“Well”, he sighed. “Be sure to take care of yourself, Derek. Uridach’s a city where you better get home at sundown. I mean it. The streets aren’t safe at night.”

 

I would come to take his warning seriously. Having some time to spare on the weekend, I strayed a little further from the appartement complex than necessary while out for some groceries. After my first close encounter had levelled my expectations, I wasn’t too surprised to find the greater reaches of the city in a similar state of disrepair. It seemed to me like Uridach took great care to break the illusion at any chance given.

 

I was used to the cities, I had thought. The brighter the lights, the darker the shadows. Only there were no bright lights in Uridach. The streets I wandered, dim and grey, blurred seamlessly into the gloom of their back-alleys. While most cities provided an ever so subtle shift in atmosphere as the invisible barrier to a more dangerous area was broken, I found myself trying to escape said barriers in vain. Downtown, even the outskirts where nothing to write home about. Only few shops were still actively operating in between their abandoned brothers and sisters. A barber shop, a clothing store, an electronics repair service. What remained sustained Uridach like its vital organs. Everything else seemed to have been outsourced towards the bigger cities, while the litter of several urban centres gradually collected here. Sandwiched in between metropolises with the booming rhythm of a steady heartbeat, Uridachs pulse felt more like that of an infected appendix. Swelling and retracting in unpredictable patterns, always ready to burst.

 

There was a robbery at the grocery store. The stumbling bum, I had been carefully avoiding throughout the ails, had drawn a knife and was holding the cashier in contempt until the police showed up. After they carried him away, screaming slurred profanities at every person in sight, I witnessed the people of Uridach letting out an insignificant sigh, the tiniest shrug, before returning to work like nothing had happened at all.

 

When I arrived home, I felt relieved not to have delayed my return any further. The streets weren’t safe during the day. I didn’t want to find out what would happen at night. In fact, I was looking forward to spending the abundance of my working hours below the city, not inside of it.

 

# 3. The first day of work

My new colleges took me in with an honest smile and a hearty pat on the shoulder. Their attitude was the first pleasant surprise that Uridach had to offer. We shared that specific kind of humour unique to our profession. If you know, you know. You either go with the flow (including whatever drifts by), or you force yourself to take it until you grow bitter. I was lucky that Richard and Wes where of the before mentioned kind.

 

Richard was the older of the two. Bald head a finely trimmed moustache and an earnest but well-meaning personality. Wes was only a little younger than I, had moved to Uridach the year prior and carried an unrelenting smirk, even in his neutral expression. Circumstances set us both up to become friends quickly.

 

My first day of work started with cleaning the canals. Basic maintenance. We secured the manhole, tested for toxic fumes, then Richard and I got suited up and assembled our equipment. Wes was in charge of monitoring our sensors and bodycams, as well as reporting our progress, occasionally communicating with us wirelessly from the surface.

 

Richard had me assemble the frame for the nuzzles. The six-armed structure saved us a whole lot of work by pressure washing the curved canal- walls all the while slowly wheeling itself forward by the recoil of its own water jets. At least as long as it was mounted correctly.

 

My college gave me a satisfied nod when I finished my work. Letting me pass the test of my ability. Trust was built. Richard started to relax and Wes seemed even more eager to stay in touch. We went for a beer after work, talked some more, shared some stories, most of them work related. Wes seemed no less aware of Uridach than I was. Only he had already learned to laugh about the morbid absurdity that could only thrive in an environment such as this one. Like that one time, he told me, a human toe had casually floated by in the sewer waters. I wasn’t the least bit surprised.

 

Wes dropped his cheerful character for a moment, when the topic of their former coworker came up. The person I owed my new job and place of living to. You might not expect it, but the job that we do, comes with a surprisingly high mortality rate (about 200 a year). Most of them originating from the disregard of safety protocol. You might have climbed the bars of those manholes a thousand times, but one of those times, you’ll be thankful for that safety harness. You might never have encountered any toxic fumes before, might expect, that heavy rain would surely wash them out. The sewers are a hostile place. They almost seem to notice, when you start to forget about that. And that’s when they get you. For that unfortunate college of mine, it was nothing more than an otherwise harmless misstep.

 

“That fat bastard of a rat got him dirty”, Wes told me. “Jumped his leg, then threw itself under his foot, when he tried to kick it. Like it wanted to make him slip. He fell into the canal, cut his hand, got an infection. A week later he was dead.”

 

I spoke my condolences and reminded myself to stay cautious. We both knew that history would repeat itself sooner or later. We just did not expect for it to happen so soon.

 

# 4. The first incident

I was monitoring the maintenance process from the van, when it happened. How it happened, I still cannot say. I had the hose from the pressure washer to watch, the monitors that showed changes in air quality, all the while navigating Richard and Wes through the tunnels. When the screaming started, I was simply overwhelmed, I guess.

 

They were walking a good distance in front of the cleaning apparatus, taking care of any debris on the canals edges that our mechanical aid could get stuck on. One moment Wes was gleefully joking through the speakers about a bloated rat that had choked to death on a period pad. The next he yelled at me frantically to immediately stop the water. I could barely hear him over the deafening noise of the pressure nuzzles. Richard’s bodycam had lost connection while Wes was chasing after what looked like the six-armed metal structure. Seemingly completely out of control.

 

I rushed outside the van to turn the valve. Inside the noise died down. When I returned, the severity of the situation was evident. Somehow, the structure had lost traction, had thrown itself wildly through the tunnels until Richard got caught in its arms. He was unconscious as far as I could tell through the image of Wes’ camera. The rogue metal had slammed him into one of the floodgates we had raised in advance to lower the water level.

 

After calling an ambulance, I joined Wes to get Richard back to the surface. He had opened his eyes when I grabbed his arm to help him walk but wasn’t responsive. Shaken up, Wes and I recovered the pressure washer from the tunnels and ended the day early. We went to my home while waiting for an update from the hospital. Wes had brought some weed. We started smoking and slowly calmed down even though none of us would be able to process what happened that day. That didn’t stop us from trying.

 

There was a faint memory circling the back of my mind, almost getting drowned out by the more prominent impressions of what was definitely a traumatic experience. I hesitated to mention it to Wes at first. After already having witnessed another college succumbing to a work-related injury I could only imagine how he was feeling at that moment. When he suddenly decided to bring it up himself, a union of dread and relieve came over me. I didn’t imagine Richards last words before the incident. Words that brought with them a looming conclusion, that Was didn’t hesitate to bring to my mind.

 

“Hold on”, he repeated the sentence quietly, that had haunted my memories for the past few hours.

 

Then he looked at me, seemingly aware of my recollection.

“Derek?” A realization was shaking his voice as he addressed me directly. “I think, he saw something down there.”

 

# 5. The aftermath

Richard thankfully returned a month later. We had a small reunion, went drinking together. All seemed well at first. Richard was back on his feet, rugged and sturdy as we knew him. Blinded by the relieve of his recovery we would have probably looked straight past his new vulnerabilities, if he hadn’t decided to tell us himself.

 

Seeing a man like Richard open up about his fears, was a somewhat impressive experience. He probably wouldn’t have if the circumstances hadn’t forced him to. Still, he refused to let go of the profession that he had practised for over thirty years. There was no denying that a sense of pride guided him back into our company. At the same time, the shame in his voice made me feel for him deeply.

 

Besides the physical trauma the accident had left him with an uncontrollable fear of enclosed spaces as well as the dark. He acknowledged, that his condition would impede his work but seemed hopeful he would be able to return to the canals one day after exposing himself to the idea long enough. We offered him to take care of monitoring until he felt comfortable returning to work underground.

 

Autumn came to Uridach. Due to the lack of plant matter in the cityscape, no change in scenery proceeded its arrival. But when it came, it made itself known.

 

The rain was heavy enough that at some days we only gathered at work out of a sense of responsibility. There was no way working the canals that carried waters that would swallow us from the neck down if we tried. Some of the days we simply parked the van around town, got some coffee and counted the hours until the next crisis call about another clogged drain came in.

Rumours were circling around at that time. Some of them undoubtedly a symptom of Halloween getting closer. Some of them grim, but close enough to the reality of Uridach, that Wes and I didn’t take any chances when spending some time at each other’s appartements after work (usually gaming or smoking). Fog had appeared after sundown. Apparently, some people had gone missing as well and the rumours were quick to connect the two. Ridiculous, yes. Still, we had developed a habit of staying overnight at each other’s homes, when night came too early.

 

Rainfall and overflowing sewers had swept the subway station clean at some point. When the homeless returned soon after, the seasons had not been kind to them. Their demeanour had grown increasingly unhinged, erratic or straight up feral. There was every reason to avoid the station at that time.

 

We were late on inspections after the floods had rendered the sewers inaccessible. When Wes and I returned there, things had changed. Treasures and trinkets had resurfaced, after strong waters hat carried them from the bottom of the canals. Now they lay scattered around the steady stream of wastewater. I never knew, how many clothes there were. The rats also appeared noticeably bigger than before. And when we finished up our work in the early afternoon, I noticed the fog creeping hesitantly from the shallow waters. The same fog that would swallow the streets as soon as the sun went down. It came from down here.

 

# 6. The second and third incident

The sewers are a hostile place. They almost seem to notice, when you start to forget about that. And that’s when they get you.

 

The main canals that I’ve mostly been talking about are not the only structures in the tunnels. From both sides, smaller drains feed the constant stream of sewage and faecal matter. Smaller tubes, only about half a meter (about 20 inches) in diameter. They spew their load in sudden gushes and leave a trail of greyish ooze on the wall, usually more yellow in the centre, where the urea crystallizes. Despite the surroundings, a well-maintained sewer doesn’t smell as bad as you might expect it to. Less like the stench of a blown-up outhouse, more like the subtle smell of a lukewarm puddle of mud water.

 

There are certain things you are just getting used to, no matter where you work at. The hum of a refrigerator, the hiccups of a needle printer, the unsteady flickering of an office lamp. Overtime you might notice yourself growing less and less sensitive to this one specific background noise until you think you’ve entirely gone numb to it. That’s until it suddenly shifts. And without being able to immediately point your finger at it you somehow know that something is wrong.

 

Wes said it first, before I could even fathom the feeling.

 

“Put on your mask”, he said and I followed.

 

“What’s going on?”, Richard asked through the intercom.

 

“Smells like something died down here.”

 

I could not help but agree. The air had thickened and left a sickly-sour taste in my mouth.

In case the atmosphere went foul, our personal protective equipment provided us with gas masks and clean compressed air for about twenty minutes. The alarm didn’t trigger. There was no immediate danger originating from toxic fumes. Still, it was better not to expose ourselves to whatever was currently digesting itself in the damp atmosphere. It was our job to find it, and we hand a limited time to do so.

 

With our flashlights we examined the main canal and the corners of the walkways, before turning towards the drains inside the wall. People flush all kinds of stuff down the toilet that they aren’t supposed to. Clothing items, sextoys, unwanted pets, just to name a few. What I didn’t expect to find in the steep and narrow drain, framed grotesquely by the circular stone, was the face of a man.

 

He was of a dark grey colour when I found him. Skin awfully tight and swollen. His eyes had been stolen by rats. The tongue had protruded from his mouth and showed obvious bitemarks from vermin as well as human teeth. Probably his own. His features were distorted from his state of decomposition. I wouldn’t have recognized the guy even if I had known him. Wet fragments of worn cloth, almost completely swallowed by the bloated flesh, had me suspect him to be one of Uridachs homeless. In the moment I found him though, another question took over my mind and has not left me since: How did he even get in there?

 

Conscious enough of the situation, I was able to spare Wes the details. We left the discovery to the police, but the image lingered. And after I returned home, I think I started shutting down. We didn’t smoke that afternoon. Wes stayed with me until I half-lucidly kept insisting on being fine on my own. He left because I told him so. And I still can’t forgive myself for that. Because when he went home, it was already dark outside. Wes disappeared into the fog, never to be seen again.

 

# 7. Solitude

He had called in sick. At least that’s what Richard kept telling me. He didn’t respond to my messages, didn’t pick up my calls, didn’t answer the doorbell. Two times I had called a wellness check on him. Police told me he was fine. I didn’t believe them.

 

Work in the sewers was lonely after Wes was gone. The discovery of a corpse in an impossible space had only furthered Richard’s fear of the tunnels which meant that I was left to wander the sewers alone for the foreseeable future. He too had gone mostly quiet during our working hours. Leaving me to process all that had happened alone while returning to the crime scene time and time again, almost expecting another dreadful find.

 

It didn’t help that there was no news on the matter. Maybe even in Uridach matters like this had to be handled more carefully as not to cause unwanted distress.

Since then, the sewers hadn’t chanced as much as the way, that I started looking at them. Not just looking. Smelling, Listening. During the winter the fog didn’t vanish. It remained in the sewers, covered ground and water in obscure layers, blurry and grey. Passing the drains on the wall I kept seeing the mutilated face out of the corner of my eye. I kept asking myself how long it would have taken for the corpse to swell up to the point that it plugged the narrow drain seamlessly. For the first time though, I started wondering why no request ever reached us to take care of the blockage, that we purely discovered by chance.

 

An unfamiliar noise startled me before I could finish my train of thought. A low gurgling sound, reverberating through a long, tube-like structure with sturdy walls. My attention immediately shifted to the drains. Just fast enough to catch something vanishing inside of one of them. I knew, the rats had been growing bigger. But colour and shape didn’t match. Another sound followed. Slimy and guttural. Somewhere else I could hear something moving behind the brick walls. It seemed to be slowly sliding downward, until the sound died down.

 

Water trickled from one of the drains. Dark and damp, steaming against the winter cold. I was used to the sound. In a way it was soothing. When I looked around again, I felt that something was missing though. Which is a distinctly unsettling sensation to have if you are standing alone in a tunnel with nothing but dripping drains and bubbling wastewater in sight.

 

Then, Richard’s voice tore through the silence. I didn’t understand him at first. The same syllables over and over, until I realized, that what he was screaming into my ears was my own name.

 

“Derek!”, he howled frantically. “Get out of there! Get out! Now!”  
  
He repeated his warning like a mantra. His words getting louder but ever less intelligible the longer he kept screaming. I found him in the van, curled up on the ground, wailing like I have no man see before. He could barely control his breath. Responded to my presence only by crying even more. Repeatedly he gestured towards the monitoring screens showing my camera feed. I knew he had seen something, but he refused to tell.

 

While waiting for the ambulance, my imagination ran wild. Yet, I could not come up with anything that would have reduced my college to a whimpering, shivering pile of instinct, purely at sight. I was tempted to return to the sewers just to gain some closure. Common sense got the better of me. I reported the incident, then I left home.

 

# 8. Paid leave

I’ve been on paid leave for the past few days. Didn’t leave my home. Didn’t even sleep most of the time.

 

The streets outside are practically deserted. I don’t know if they have always been. Maybe it’s just the fog that keeps me from seeing. It doesn't retreat back into the sewers anymore. I can barely see the other side of the street during daytime.

 

I tried to call Wes again. He didn’t answer. I didn’t expect him to.

 

During the last few nights, the police stopped by. They parked their car. An officer got out. Then they just stood there. Waiting for something, I assumed. Yesterday I forgot to turn off the lights in the kitchen. The police car stopped by. No one got out. This morning, they rang at my door. Wellness-check they said. I didn’t let them in.

 

I know they lied to me about Wes. There is also no news about a corpse being discovered in Uridach. Not on the internet, not even in the Newspaper. I’m starting to suspect, the body we found isn’t the only one they covered up. I think Wes might be one of them.

 

After denying them entry this morning, police have returned two times over. They demanded for me to open the door again. Threatened to break it down when I stayed adamant. One way or another, I will leave this appartement tonight. And I have a feeling that whatever is lurking in the sewers below Uridach, I will soon be forced to find out.
