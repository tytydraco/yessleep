*On January 12, 2022, officers entered 21 Jenkins Avenue after a woman related to the residents expressed concerns about their wellbeing.*

*They discovered the body of a 34 year old man lying in the upstairs bedroom. He’d been dead for about 37 hours. In the hallway just outside the doorway of the bedroom where we found the older victim, we found the body of a 10 year old boy. He was understood to be the older victim’s son. He died a few hours after his father.*

*The cause of death is seemingly natural. A trace amount of codeine and xanax was found in the older victim’s system, but it appeared his death was caused by a sort of infection of the lungs which led him to asphyxiate.*

*His son appears to have died in the same manner. This infection is not explained but may have been caused by the unidentified substances we found in the walls.*

*The older victim also has some blunt force injuries to his spine consistent with being hit in the back with some sort of blunt object, although this doesn’t seem to have contributed to his death. Human teeth were found within the victim's back, they were seemingly pushed into his flesh when he was hit and some were crushed in the impact. The teeth do not belong to either of the victims.*

*The deaths are a medical rarity. The substance we found in the walls is not a match to any existing medical phenomenon, and is in the process of being tested to examine the danger it could cause.*

*In an attempt to understand the symptoms, we have collected transcripts from the older victim’s phone (number used is 077555 23454) We could not locate other electronic devices from the home as they had mostly been damaged by the unidentified substance we found in the walls.*

Hi, Michael. It’s Helena.

We’ve been trying to reach you on the phone but you haven’t picked up. This is about Brian. He’s in the office right now. He is deeply distressed and I think it's best that he goes home. I’m not sure exactly what has happened. I know you’re at work but please get back to me as soon as you can.

Hey, Sasha. This is Michael, I mean, you know that. I just remembered how you said you don’t save all of the numbers on your phone. (Sighs)

I guess I haven’t been totally honest with you, Sasha. I’m not… well. I have a son and I never told you. He’s… er… he’s 10 years old. His name’s Brian. I didn’t tell you because… honestly, Brian’s been through a lot. I didn’t really want him to have to meet you because… I don’t mean it like that.

Brian’s mum, my, um, my wife. Not… we never got divorced. My wife is… um…

(Pause)

Okay. I’ve got to go now and I’d, uh, I’d like you to delete my number.

Hey mum I just don’t know what to do anymore. It’s starting to get too much with Brian. I just left work early to go pick him up from school because he had a meltdown. He said he was in class and he looked down under his desk and saw his mother’s face was on the floor. Apparently, it was in perfect condition, as when she was alive. He said that she spoke to him, that she said “Whatever you do, don’t touch me, no matter how much you want to” Obviously he got scared and stamped on it. He said he saw her face be destroyed when he did that, he told me he saw blood splatter, that he saw her teeth scatter all over the floor. I don’t know how a 10 year old boy could imagine such a thing. I asked him what he saw when he looked down afterwards, he said he saw a face completely caved in.

I guess I should take him back to the therapist like I did when Stacie first passed away. I’ve just never believed in that stuff, that a kid who’s going through terrible things should just talk to some strange adult and that should make them feel any better. I was scared of them giving him pills like they did with me. You remember how sluggish I was, I didn’t even feel like  a person. I wouldn’t wish that on anyone but with Brian I’m scared. This isn’t normal, and if he continues to see things like this, I don’t even know what will happen.

Brian thought he saw his mum, basically and he got scared.

You can’t act like he’s crazy for it, can you?

============

*Editor’s note: We thought this seemed significant so we sent an investigator to the boy’s school to learn more about this incident. We conducted interviews with the headteacher and a few other staff members.*

*Our findings was that several staff members reported finding a small amount of blood under the boy’s desk after his outburst. They reported it ‘wasn’t nearly enough blood to think anything of’ and believed it was most likely from  a papercut or similar.*

*One witness reported that they did find a tooth on the floor that day but didn’t question it too much as in a primary school sometimes children lost teeth. Asked if they believed it was the victim’s tooth, he said he wasn’t sure as it had been found a few feet from his desk and was under another desk. We asked if it looked adult, no conclusive response.*

Hi, I don’t know if you remember me. I’m Michael. We met on Hinge, months ago now. I’m aware you probably deleted my number but I’m the guy who has a son, I guess. I didn’t have it in my profile but I told you that night. You seemed cool with it, but looking back you were probably just being polite. I get it and everything but politeness is a plague really. I’d like to wring the neck of whoever came up with the concept of being polite. I think politeness is why we’re the only species that has problems.

I guess I’m messaging you again desperate for your empathy or somebody’s empathy. It’s not that simple as me just having a son or having an ex. My wife is dead and that’s one hell of a burden to bear not because of her but because of him. He’ll never be the same and he’ll never really be okay. My son was the one who found the body, and he saw her face. I didn’t see her face. I don’t know if seeing a thing like that is something you can ever get over. I do try my best but I guess it's getting worse for him.

I really hope you'll get back to me. I don’t expect anything from you romance-wise. I promise. I just want someone to talk to. Will you talk to me?

Michael, I’ve had just about enough of you. I’ve watched you neglect yourself long enough and I don’t want to see you neglect your son as well.

Your son came to my house in hysterics. He told me he didn’t want to be at home because he could see faces in the walls. He said that he heard them speaking to him. He said they told him not to touch them or something bad would happen.

I don’t know how, as a father, you can hear a 10 year old boy say this and continue to think this is okay and that he doesn’t need help.

Let me lay this out in front of you clearly. You either seek out mental help for Brian or I sue you for custody, which I’ve thought about doing even back when your wife was alive.

This is the Gloucester child and adolescent mental health service, we have recieved your request. You will be connected with a provider soon. Please provide the name and date of birth of the patient you would like to refer, and a short paragraph describing why you believe they need our help.

**Sent to: (private number) Sent by: 077555 23454**

Hi, the patient I want to refer is my son Brian Wilkerson born 5/6/2013.

So my son recently lost his mother in August 2021. His mum died of a lung infection nobody knew she had overnight. I was out that night, so my son was the one who found her in the morning. I’ll never be able to take back the guilt I feel over that. What I know is that he was with the body for about 8 hours before I got home, because for whatever reason he didn’t want to just call me.

So Brian is starting to say that he sees faces, maybe his mother’s face, sticking out of the floor and the walls. He first saw it in school. He saw his mother’s face sticking out from the floor under his desk, looking as if she was alive. She told him not to touch her, no matter how much he wanted to. But he got scared and stomped on her face. He said then he saw blood and teeth splatter on the floor, and he looked down to see her face caved in.

I’ll admit I brushed that under the rug, but now I think it’s impossible to ignore. My son wakes up in the night screaming, and he’ll tell me he saw a face sticking out of his wall and sticking out of the ceiling. He says the faces always say to him ‘don’t touch me no matter how much you want to’. They tell him that something bad will happen to us if he touches them, but he says he has touched them to try to get them to stop.

My mother says he needs mental help so here I am referring to you.

In bathroom, ceiling above the bath. Speaks: yes. in kitchen, behind oven. Speaks: no. in my room, under bed, speaks: has spoken, not consistently. in Brian’s room, ceiling above bed. Speaks: constantly. Stacie.

*Editor’s note: this is very significant. We found that in the kitchen, the oven had been pulled to the other side of the room. The wall behind the oven had been hit with a hammer or similar, causing a dent in the drywall. Further, pieces of drywall were discovered under both victim’s fingertips.*

*Under the older victim’s bed, the floor is wooden. He had hit the floorboards here with a hammer, and a small amount of his blood was found on the floorboards. Splinters of varying sizes from the floorboards were found in his hands.*

*The locations on the ceilings had not been damaged in the same manner. There has been no damage at all to the ceiling in the bathroom. In the younger victim’s room, a towel had been nailed onto the ceiling. There is a hole ripped in the centre of the towel, seemingly ripped with teeth marks.*

=============

*This is the last text sent from this phone before we believe the victims died. From this texts, we can discern that the substance in the walls had caused a lung infection in both victims that gave them trouble breathing and caused them to exhibit psychotic symptoms through the period of infection, which is about 2 months.*

*The substance we pulled from the walls for testing was a substance with a chalk-like consistency. There was about 0.55mg of this substance in the walls/ceilings of each location noted by the victim. We also found trace amounts of the substance within the victim’s lungs. Results have found this substance contains human DNA, but it’s unsure exactly what in this substance was toxic to the victims, or how it originated in the house.*

*We attempted to test the substance on animals. We inserted traces of the substance into the walls of a wooden structure that we kept two lab mice in. We inserted a small camera to note the effects but after 10 hours, the substance had damaged the camera. We found that one mouse had been killed by its companion. The dead mouse’s back had been viciously mutilated with bite marks and the surviving mouse had the dead mouse's blood all over its fur and teeth. As like the original victims, the mice had seemingly attempted to tear the substance out of the walls.*

*Whatever this substance is, it is extremely dangerous to any living creature and may possibly appear in other homes near where the first victims died. We believe that more testing should be done on humans to get a better picture on the effects on different individuals. A clinical trial is to be undertaken and test subjects are being sought.*
