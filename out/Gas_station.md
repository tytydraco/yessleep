One night when i was driving home from a late night shift at my wor., I was on a high road normally filled with traffic at that time of night but there was no car but mine, i was almost out of fuel and spotted and my gps showed a gas station a mile away so i drove above the speed limit to reach it before my fuel ran out. When i reached it all the lights were on inside but nobody was there i thought maybe the worker was in the restroom so i thought nothing of it, i filled up my car and went in so i could pay and grab a drink and some stuff to eat, once i had entered there was still nobody in but there was a ATM so i went to it and pulled out around £60 so i could pay for the gas and a snack i grabbed a pack of crisps, chocolate and a bottle of cola i went up to the till and i put the money on it and as i was about to leave i saw a shadow behind me it’s arms were the same height as me it was towering over me it had talons. 

I quickly turned around to see what it was and when i saw it i felt like i was paralysed it had no eyes instead it had holes where they would normally be the holes were deep going right through its head i could see the gas station wall through it. It’s neck was slit open bleeding out and it’s mouth was wide open with a grin and it’s sharp blood stained teeth, it had a old stained uniform on with rips in it and through the rips you could see it’s ribs bulging out looking like it hadn’t ate for years. I was horrified just standing there paralysed holding my stuff and out of nowhere it said “ERDAN FORTIF NORAFI KERIF” it pulled its arm it and its talons that were atleast 4 inches looking like a knife moved to my throat as if it was going to slit it out of nowhere i no longer felt paralysed and my fight or flight kicked in, i punched it as hard as i could and it didn’t move a muscle it then said in a angrier tone “MERKAF MOFIAS GORIAR.” i ran as fast as i could. 

Not even going to the door and just jumping out the glass windows feeling the glass seep into my skin as i ran for my life to my car with it slowly chasing after my lifting it’s arms getting ready to grab me. It almost grabbed me but i just got out of its reach and when i had got to my car i didn’t even put my seat belt on. I just put my key in and it wouldn’t start i tried and i tried. 

It then worked but by that time IT Had put it’s arm right through the window almost grabbing my neck but instead it cut my neck with its talons and i pushed down the acceleration with all the force i could. i had got away from the gas station thing i was safe then i heard a thump on top of my roof, It caught up to me i thought if i went as fast as my car could go it would fall of but it didn’t it put its hand through the hole in my window it left earlier and grabbed me by the throat and pulled me out of my car but luckily because the car was speeding it pushed forward knocking it off while i was in its hand it had let go and i thought it was dead so i ran as fast as i could to my car got in and went as fast as my car could go and got way from it. I am now in my house hopefully safe from it as i am writing this it is currently 3:56am and i live by myself i am praying that it doesn’t know where i live but if anything happens and i live i will update you
