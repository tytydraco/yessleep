I woke up my head spinning to my tv blaring at me from its stand in the Corner of the room. It took me a few moments to recognize the message displayed on my tv said. “Emergency alert system” it said there was a “lunar anomaly” it was odd because I memorized most of these type of signs and information but I’ve never heard of one like this, what even is a “lunar anomaly”. At the bottom it said it was at king place in my home town and a few other towns nearby. Starting at 2:45 am. Oh crap. I look at my phone clock 2:30. It said to took supplies, food, water , etc. and to go to any room with no windows. 

2:42 I locked myself in the bathroom grabbed quite a lot of food and water, a phone charger, my phone, and headphones. 

2:45 I got settled, and waited while watching my phone. 

2:47 a scream penetrated through the silence of the night. I flinched. Another scream. More and more screams joined the disturbing chorus. The screams were horrific. It sounded like they were boiling alive

3:10 my phone started to glitch for about 5 minutes every once in a while, a message on flop up I would get to read the whole thing, but I only saw a picture of the moon

3:24 the screaming stopped 10 minutes ago. I didn’t dare go outside. whatever is out there, I wouldn’t to see. 


7:56 I dozed off. Normally in my neighborhood. This time, birds would chirp, cars would drive through and dogs would bark but no. Silence. Complete silence.

12:43 I decided to go out at two, that was short lived though when. Another person screamed. Probably thought whatever was happening was over. 

3:24 I haven’t had a lot of friends since I moved from Canada except for one. They’re my neighbor, George was a nice funny guy. Who I meet when I was just moving in. I moved after while in Vancouver on a business trip. My family disappeared. It had been tough. But he was there for me but imagine how hard it crushed me when George’s voice joined the symphony of screams. 


5:46 a knock on my door shattered the everlasting silence drifting through the air. I stayed quiet then I heard him George, but no, it’s not him. I know it’s not. It’s the one talking. When my parents dispersed it wasn’t just them it was a whole town. It happening here too. The thing that was masking the sound of my dead friend started talking to me. “ come out, the moon its so bright, it’s so beautiful joe. Please we can see it together.” I started crying quietly. My only friend has been take- bang bang the thing pounded on my door, while screaming at me to see the moon. I can’t take it anymore. 

I finally stared at the moon and it stared back it was so so beautiful
