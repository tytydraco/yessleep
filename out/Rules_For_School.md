This is your first day of school, you are new. Follow these rules and stick to them if you expect to stay safe.

0. ALWAYS, ALWAYS get the school helpline number the reasons for this are provided below.

1. The car journey is relatively safe, however a few procedures and precautions should be taken.

1a. During the journey if you see an old balding man outside the building ignore him and continue with your journey it is VERY important that you ignore him.

1b. When you are entering the school DO NOT look at the roof, THEY are NOT friendly.

2. If the school building is made of grey concrete then get out immediately and run back to your car, THAT is not your school. Instead stay home and return tomorrow, repeat this until you find a building in any other colour and material. After this the building is safe you can safely attend, the building will stop changing colours and will resume as normal.

2a. If you enter it it is too late, your only hope is to escape using the windows. Otherwise refer to 'Rule 8'.

3. If you enter a class and there is no teacher present, run and DO NOT look in the supply closet.

4. While walking in the hallways you will be around other people, if you come across a section that is empty simply leave.

4a. If you see eyes in the dark in the empty parts of the hallways do not worry they will not harm you unless provoked or harmed. They will become agitated or provoked if they see any kind of food, refrain from showing any type of food unless you want to be taken away.

4b. If the empty hallway doesn’t end then use your phone to contact the school for help, this is one of the reasons for ‘Rule 0’. The school authorities will find you and take you back to the usual hallway.

4c. If the authorities that come to help you has red eyes, or if you haven’t called anyone yet DO NOT in any circumstance go with them. Refuse kindly and change the topic, they will soon go away. After this thank whatever god you believe in because you just survived an encounter with THEM. If this is not successful refer to 'Rule 8'.

5. The teachers are there to protect you, do not be afraid of them and trust them as long as they don’t have red eyes. If they do, then call school authorities.

6. If you are in the hallways and you see familiar faces you may talk to them. But if they have red eyes RUN to the closest classroom and call authorities, you will be notified when it is safe. If you don't receive any notifications escape using the window and get as far as possible.

7. If, while going to lunch or leaving school the sky turns red, RUN BACK INSIDE, after this find a place to hide, a classroom, supply closet or bathroom preferably not alone. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT AND MUST BE FOLLOWED IMMEDIATELY

7a. If the lights go out stay as silent as possible, there is a chance you will hear sniffing, if this happens do not move at all. After following this you will be safe and back to normal in about 30 minutes.

7b. If you break rule 7a It is too late, THEY have got you. Refer to 'Rule 8'.

8. They have found your scent and you will not return.
