My name is Kaitlyn (22f), I live in a rural town in the deep woods of Montana. I moved here because the surrounding area was more appealing to me than the cities on the East Coast. It was my first winter here and it was hard to adjust. I got a job at a local gas station on the outskirts of the town. The locals have always seemed friendly but we all know how locals feel about big city people showing up in their small towns.

Starting at Marties (the gas station) was simple and easy. They stuck me on mid-shift so I would leave just before it got dark. There's not much to talk about the station. We had four pumps, they had a very vintage feel to them because there was no digital screen, the first time I'd seen ones like that. Inside we had three rows of random assortments as well as two walls of fridge/freezer doors. Then of course we had the soda machine which only served Pepsi products, not my favorite choice.

The area around the station was beautiful. There was a single-lane road that ran past with moderate traffic from tourists or other locals. When I got to work, the smell of fresh pine and morning dew always hit my nose. It was as if being there was such a mental pallet cleanser. Other than that there was a small storage/garage area out back next to the trash bin. The only stuff kept in there were tools to fix stuff if the mechanics couldn't come out, or in case someone's car broke down and needed a jump.

I had a few interesting co-workers, well three. There was Jim, he was your typical small-town stoner guy. He was always relaxed and went with the flow but always smelled like he just climbed out of a pile of dirt. Then there was Brenda, she was a mother of three and was a mother to everyone that worked there. Her only downside was smelling and puffing out smoke like an old train. Then there was Wayne, Wayne looked like a very mature typical country boy. He wore his button-up shirt with his blue jeans and boots. His hair was short and black that framed his face along with the light stubble around his chin. It's what every city girl dreams of and boy did I dream about him.

Now that I've told you a little bit of what is going on it's time we get to why I'm here writing this out for you. So I've been here for three weeks now, enough time to build up somewhat of a relationship with others in town. And as it turns out there's a fall/winter concert kind of party that goes down at the Harris farm every year. People from the surrounding towns would all gather here and have one big party. I was invited the first time I've ever been invited anywhere. So I planned and got the day off and cleared. And I couldn't wait to go to my first real party.

I had the location ready on my phone, I was texting in between stages telling my friends how excited I was about this. Just as I finished getting my hair done and my eyeliner perfect my phone rang. Glancing over I expected it to be the girls at the party, But it was Wayne who was calling me, I froze for a second, sure we have talked before but why was he calling me now? So I picked up the phone and answered.

Kaitlyn: "Hey Wayne, what's up? Shouldn't you be at work now?"

Wayne: "Howdy Kaitlyn, you are right but that's what I'm callin’ bout. I've had a sudden issue with family and I need to leave for a few hours and wanted to know if you could cover for me?." At this point my heart kind of dropped, I was so excited for this party but I was also torn because of how much I wanted him to like me.

Kaitlyn: "What happened to Jim or Brenda? Or one of the others?"

Wayne: "Well I tried calling them both but neither answered. I'm sure Jim’ll be too high to figure out how his phone works or he's asleep. And you know Brenda is probably also asleep after dealin’ with those kids she's got."

Kaitlyn: "I'm not sure honestly, I can probably come in for a few hours." saying reluctantly. Wayne: "Listen I know how much it means to you but I wouldn't be asking if I had any other choice I'll make it up to you I swear."

Kaitlyn: "Alright Alright but you owe me big. I'll see you in a few."

We both said goodbye and hung up, I immediately gave out a drastic sigh and began finding, putting on my work clothes. I hurried because Wayne was waiting on me now. The faster I got there the faster he could get back. Finally getting ready I grabbed my keys and my jacket and headed out the door. My old car fought me in the cold. When it roared to life, I drove to Marties.

As I pulled into Marties, I could see Wayne prepping the shelves inside. Stepping out of my car and locking it I began to see snow fall from the sky. Enchanted by the sight of snow for the first time (right lame I know) I heard the doors slide open. Wayne was staring at me with a smile that said "You having fun?" and somehow "Hurry up." Wayne: "Having fun watching snowfall?" It was said with a tone issuing patience was faltering. Kaitlyn: " Right sorry I've never seen snow before just kinda caught me off guard." responding on my way inside.

Wayne: "First time seeing snow? Well, you are gonna see a lot of it this year." I heard behind me heading for the backroom to clock in.

Walking in the TV was talking about the current storm coming in. It seemed a lot of the area was going to get hit including mine. obviously I'd tell myself looking out the window. Snapping back to reality I quickly clocked in the familiar click of the old-school punch card machine ringing. Then out to talk to Wayne I went. I was stalling too much at this point.

Kaitlyn: "Alright I know you are in a hurry but give me the rundown." I noticed he was already putting his coat on but no gloves like a true country boy.

Wayne: "Well, I haven't been busy. Maybe four or five customers make sense with the party going on. Maybe take out the trash in an hour or so? It will give you something to do. But I have to leave" He said heading for the door but stopped to turn to look at me. "Kaitlyn again thank you for this. I appreciate it."

And with that, he was gone and off to his car. His words gave me a surge of warmth. I just hope he didn't see how red my cheeks got. I watched his car leave from the window and began to look around the empty store. It was my first time being alone this late at night here and it was kind of peaceful. Walking over to the windows of the front of the store I watched the snow fall ever so slowly outside completely entranced with the small movements.

Snapping out of the little hypnosis the snowfall brought on me I began to walk the store seeing if Wayne had left anything for me to face. There were a few that seemed like he tried but was in a hurry which made sense. Fixing the small issues I made my way back to the storage area. Grabbing the push cart I piled an assortment of products on top of the exact number that I needed for the spots I'd seen open. My memory has always been next level. My mother used to tell me I made an elephant's memory look like a goldfish's. With that i went out and started placing the stock in its own place.

Placing the last can of dog food on the shelf letting it slip in on top of the other can locking them in, I nodded to myself as I heard the familiar sound of the front door opening. Standing up I look over and notice it's Alice, a friend i was supposed to meet at the party and it smacks me as I realized I never told the group I was going to be late if I didn't miss the party all together. I wave to her shyly as her eyes get big with a smile then the look of confusion on her face.

Alice: “Kate why are you here? I thought you got tonight off for the party, remember?!” said with worry and irritation.

Kaitlyn: “Yes yes i know trust me i know. But Wayne said he had a family emergency and he called me.” Feeling defeated as I pushed my cart to the front while she headed towards the back where the fridges with beer and other adult drinks were located..

She shook her head as she pulled out a twenty four pack of her favorite and made her way to the front.

Alice: “Oh yes Mr country boy now it makes sense. You have been drooling over him since you got here. No, I get you girl just make sure he pays you back.” She said with a smile and a wink causing me to blush a little.

Just then another friend popped into the store. Her name was Heather. She came up asking why I was still here and I explained it to her just shorter this time because Alice cut me off saying “Wayne”. Heather knew right off the bat and gave a very over exaggerated face and display, Causing all three of us to laugh a bit.

They turned around to leave as they made their way to the door. It swung open and one of the older locals came in a bit tipsy already. As the two girls walked past he stopped and watched them with the creepy smile only an old man could do and said out loud for everyone to hear.

Creepy Old Man: “If I was forty years younger that would be the kind of tail I'd be chasing.”

Alice: “When you were our age you were chasing tails for the village to eat.” Alice had said as she scoffed at him.

They quickly left, leaving me alone with the man. He made his way slowly through the store after giving a non caring shrug. He made his way up to the counter and set his choice of candy and a beer in front of me and began fumbling for the cash he would need. Not much was said between us, I gave him the total and he gave me the cash. The change was exchanged and he turned around and left. And honestly i felt kind of insulted, i know i may not be the most attractive girl but he acted if i wasn't even there. I watched him walk out of the store and over to the side where the cars usually parked.

Walking out to grab my cart I felt a very uneasy feeling the kind you get that you are being watched. Like eyes somewhere are fixed on you like prey in the sights of a predator. I shivered at the feeling thinking maybe the old man was watching me. Maybe now he wanted to say something, looking around I didn't see anyone. But what caught my attention was across the street in the treeline where the snow lay piling up. Was a deer, he had no antlers but by his build it looked male. I'm not sure I'm from the city, but it felt like the deer was watching me. That made my skin crawl a bit too much and I made my way over to the window to see if I could get a better look. As I got to the window a car passed by at a high speed. It was the old man leaving finally but as he passed the deer as soon as the car was out of the line of sight the deer was gone. I was confused. I looked around the area to see if I just lost sight. But the deer was gone and no sign he was ever there.

I shook my head before noticing the buildup of snow and decided I should take out the trash now. Because if not then I would have to do it later in the deep snow. Heading for the back I stopped to grab the trash in the main register area replacing the bags. Then into the back I placed all the small bags I placed on the cart in the big trash. Pushing the cart back to its spot I pull out the big trash bag and make my way out back. I stop to admire the sight of the heavy falling snow. It was peaceful so serene movies or pictures never do it justice. A small quick rush of air brought me back and I headed over to the gate blocked trash can. I walked in between the two separated gates and lifted the lid up and over throwing the trash into the main dumpster then closed the lid. I dusted my hands off and nodded telling myself I did a good job.

The cold was settling in so I made my way outside the gated area to the main building. Stepping out only a few steps I was greeted with the sound of a sharp crash. Metal bending and scraping, it came from the shed next to me. My mind thought that the only thing it could be was a car who lost control had crashed into the side. I quickly ran over to the opposite side to help, I could hear what sounded like groaning. Maybe the old man had hit the shed? Sliding to a slow stop I looked to the now exposed side of the shed. There was no sign of impact, no sign of a car, glancing up I spotted the source of it all. The metal roof had caved in due to the snow fall. I'm sure after years of being out here it finally gave in and the wind moving the broken areas recreated the sound of groaning. Letting out a slight sigh, then went back inside.

Walking back I noticed all the lights flickering. And said to myself “it's as if this place never deals with snow.” Entering the building I was met with the sound of the store's phone ringing. I quickly made my way over to answer the phone. Picking it up and answering it, I was met with the worried voice of Wayne.

Kaitlyn: “Hello Thank you for calling Marties this is Kaitlyn how can i help you?”

Wayne: “Kaitlyn it's Wayne, I saw the power flicker and I forgot to tell you about the Backup generator.”

Kaitlyn: ”That's kind of a big thing to forget about you know?”

Wayne: ”Yeah i know i'm sorry, but there is a panel in the backroom labeled “Generator” all you have to do is make sure it's on setting two. That way if the power goes out and stays out for a bit it will kick on and the store will be good.”

Kaitlyn: “Oh ok so setting two? How long will it last? And when are you coming back?”

Wayne: “Yeah, setting two should last a few hours. If it goes out again, switch it to setting three. That's the backup tank; it's run off propane. And yeah, sorry, it's taking longer than I figured. I'm trying to get stuff situated here, but I'll text you and let you know when I'm on my way.”

And with that we said our goodbyes and I made my way to the back room. I was guessing the big complex power box with labels is what he meant. Reading over I found the correct switch and turned it over to two and heard an uneasy buzzing as things did what they needed to. The backroom didn't have much. There were the files, the panel, and the manager's computer. Jim told me the password a week ago in case I was on my break and wanted to watch the cameras. I typed in the password and pulled up the cameras. Looking over the options on the monitor I thought I spotted something out by the shed. It looked like the deer from earlier. And before I could get a better look a ring of a bell sounded from upfront causing me to look away for a moment. Glancing back the deer was gone and nothing in the snow showed footprints.

I walked up front and the local Mechanic/Carpenter Rod was standing out the counter bundled up with a coffee and snacks on the counter.

Rod: “Wait you are here? Where’s Wayne?” He said a bit curious and surprised to see me.

Kaitlyn: “Well he had a family thing go down I guess so I'm here till he gets back. When I was supposed to be at the big party." I said sort of sarcastically and he nodded, grabbing his card to pay for his things.

Rod: “I'm actually on my way out there now for a call. I guess some girl either got her car stuck or broke it somehow. Who knows with these kids.” he chuckled a bit, grabbing his stuff and heading for the door. He stopped by the door, turned around and pointed out the door. “There's gonna be a guy named Sam he's gonna be here probably after a bit he's going around lookin’ for sights for a bear. I guess people have reported something big trying to get into their houses. So if a guy shows up with a hunting rifle it's ok.” I thanked him as he finally exited and I stood there thinking about the possibility of seeing my first bear before shaking off the sudden fear that followed shortly after.

I remembered I could have told him about the caved in roof but by the time I got to the door he was already driving off. I let out a sign and returned back to the register and grabbed a notebook labeled “important Notes”. It was there so that everyone on shift could read it for important notices or issues. It seemed nothing was new from the last time I saw it and I wrote about the issue with the shed. As I'm writing down in the notebook I had that feeling again that I was being watched. Like a strong uncomfortable feeling and it felt like it was being centered on the back of my neck. I tried to swat at it, maybe to make the feeling go away. But I turned around and saw nothing, just the wall with a clock and cigarettes on it. At this point of searching the wall a small sound caught my attention above me so I looked up at the plain ceiling tiles.

It sounded like something shuffling above but I brushed it off as just the snow moving and piling around on top. I made my way back to the storage area to grab a cleaner to clean the desk and windows. As I pushed the cart off to the side to reach for the cleaner, that's when I noticed that the sounds of shuffling above me seemed to follow where I was. Noticing this my heart began to race thinking maybe it was some creep who found his way into the ceiling and now he was watching me somehow. As my mind began to race with all kinds of possibilities it was interrupted with a loud and unsettling crash. It came from outside and I felt that if a car was going to crash into a shed that's what it would sound like.

Opening the back door I expected to see a destroyed shed and a smoking car. But what I saw was so much worse, with the flicking lights of the shed and lights from the main building you could see a clear sign of impact. It was midway up the shed with a clear sheen of a crimson red liquid. It was blood, it had to be blood. Hearing a sort of dragging sound I saw what seemed to be a pair of deer hooves being dragged into the gated trash area. As the feet vanished from sight it was met with another sound I will never forget. The best way to describe it is a few leaves of ice cold lettuce or cabbage that was slowly being twisted and bent causing the very distinct snapping sounds but somehow kept the sound of a juiciness to it. I was frozen in fear with everything that just happened. I thought maybe it was hit by a vehicle but it was too far away from the road to be flung that far. But then the conversation about the bear came into my mind and I began to back up. That's when the second sound hit my ears, it was very distinct like a cartoonish sound of a balloon full of slime that popped or the sound you expect from stepping into a bucket of semi melted butter. With that i quickly ran inside and locked the door my breathing heavy and labored.

Swiftly I made my way upfront and picked up the store's phone and called the police. I told them the bear was outside and that it was here the one people were talking about. And that it killed a deer in the trash area. They told me they were going to send people out and remain inside, maybe lock the door. They said with the snow coming in it's hard to get people out to my area at the moment. I groaned in frustration and made my way upfront after hanging up and turned off the auto function of the doors and locked them. Then I had an idea, I headed back to the counter and using a piece of paper I made a sign telling people to knock if they want in and that a bear is nearby.

Satisfied with my current choice I made my way to the drink station and poured hot water into a cup and then made my way down the aisles. I grabbed a package of hot chocolate and mixed it with the water before returning to the backroom to watch the cameras for this bear. I took a short cautious sip of the hot reassuring drink and placed it down while sitting at the computer. I shake the mouse to wake it up and it's the home screen. I double-clicked on the camera app, seems it closes on its own kind of weird. As the screens came into view I began to scan them and I found the one pointed towards the trash. There was no sign of the deer, or the bear and it seemed the blood on the shed was slowly being whisked away by the snow. I began to scan every other one top to bottom to see any hint of the screen thinking that maybe the bear got the creepy deer from earlier. Returning back to the original one I noticed something different, something moving. It was coming from behind the wall. It looked like branches of a tree slowly growing out and wrapping around the corner. As I bent in to somehow get a better look the sound of a knock jolted me causing me to knock over my drink. I placed napkins on the spilled liquid in a hurry and stood up the cup heading back out.

Standing at the door was an older Asian man I've never seen before but I suspected it was Sam. What gave it away was the surprisingly sized gun in his hand. Heading over, I unlocked the door and told him that the bear was outback by the trash. He nodded looking around and he told me to lock the door again. He was going to look around and see if he could find the beast. I told him about the dent in the shed and I thanked him. Watching him disappear behind the store I locked the door again. I stood there expecting the sound of a gun or shouting something. My heart quickened its pace as I waited. The wait wasn't too long because I heard something. It was the sound of an engine. Maybe a lawn mower? But what it was, was Sam on his snowmobile leaving the parking lot and down the road. Guess there was no bear and I was safe, hopefully.

I returned to the register, sat down in the chair and tried to gather my thoughts. What really helped me was the music playing from the speakers of the store. It's funny, they always play the same songs and sometimes I feel like I can tell you what time it is by the song playing. I guess I was so used to them that I never hear the songs unless I focus. And with that I began to laugh a small chuckle at first then full on laughter. I felt stupid i felt that I was overthinking everything. This isn't some cheesy movie or some over hyped TV show. This was reality everything has and had a logical explanation so far so i just needed to breathe. After the small mental break I let out a sigh of relaxation finally feeling better.

I looked down and saw my phone and picking it up I went onto social media to see how the party was going. Scrolling through there were pictures and videos of my friends seeming to have a great time. There was even a video of Rod fixing a drunk girl's car as she tried to hit on him. I smiled a bit watching it before continuing to scroll. I went through a few videos before my thumb stopped its doom scroll. It was a simple video of some girls at the party drinking and making sounds with no actual words. But that wasn't what stopped me, in the background of the video i spotted a deer by the tree line. And I could have sworn it was the same deer I was seeing outside and the one the bear had gotten. I know, how could I know what a deer looks like, especially from that far away. But it was a gut feeling along with the deer’s face. It looked stretched like someone was pulling on it, and the eyes seemed soulless and deep, very unsettling. I placed my phone down and placed my hands on my face when I noticed the post was only five minutes old.

With that I got up looking back at the clock. It's only been two hours since I've been here. So I needed something to eat. Maybe that would calm me down. Walking to the back to the premade food section I picked up a Turkey and Provolone sandwich. The great thing is that they were made from a deli in town and guessing by the expiration date we got them today. I smiled at it and grabbed a water heading for the register. I placed my items down and paid for them, even the hot chocolate packet I kept in my pocket. Sitting down in the chair I opened up the sandwich dressing it, then lifted it up to my mouth. I gave it a generous bite, as my mouth closed down on it I was met with a familiar but now unwelcoming sound of lettuce crunching. It threw me back to the scene outside, my stomach twisted and I ended up kneeling on the floor emptying out my stomach into the trash can. I tossed the sandwich into the trash and sat there catching my breath that the sound stole from me.

Sitting on the floor for a moment I heard a sound. It was a sound that raised my senses, it was the sound of something dropping on the floor in the store. I didn't hear anyone come in no wind or anything how could they with the doors locked. Slowly standing up I spotted a can slowly spinning in the middle of an isle. Looking past it I thought I saw something slink off to the side. And quickly stepping to the side to catch it there was nothing there. I shook my head gathering my nerves because there was nothing in here there was no way for anyone to be in here. So I walked out to the center of the isle where the now still can of dog food lay. I bent down and looked at it out of confusion and placed it back on top of the other watching it slide into place.

I figured maybe one of the few that came in moved it or something. Before standing up I looked forward towards the fridge doors and I froze every hair on my body standing at attention. In the reflection I could see something in the aisle next to me. It was massive, its body was the height of the shelves but it was crouched. And its eyes were ghostly white but I could feel they were searching for me. Then I could hear its breathing. It was heavy but held back like it was trying to hide it was there. It started to come towards the end of the aisle. Each movement causes the sound of a comb being lightly plucked. Tik Tik Tik is what I hear with every movement.

I started moving backwards slowly watching the reflection. It seemed the closer it got to the end the more blurry it got, not allowing me to get an actual good look at it. I don't know if it could see me in the reflection or if it could see me. But I had the sense that I was being watched again but from behind me. Were there two of them? How could something this big be so quiet and so stealthy. As I continued to back up I made the mistake of not watching where I was going and bumped into a section of chips. With the sudden noise I heard the breathing getting louder and closer and I knew it heard me and it was on its way. So I ran towards the counter, I could hear behind me the sound of it bashing into shelves as it ran. As I came close to the end of the aisle the shelf at the end came crashing down in front of me and with a scream I turned around and ran the opposite direction. I could feel it behind me, the sense of its eyes were burning into the back of my skull. I swear I could feel its breath nipping at my neck.

Turning at the end of the isle my shoulder caught the rack and sliced my arm open. I made it a bit down the first section before I stopped. I could feel the warm sensation of my blood leaking from my arm. And from behind me was the sound of licking, it was the kind of noise an annoying younger sibling would make to annoy you with the greedy licking and slurping of an ice cream you wanted but they got. Each sloppy lick was met with the sound of the plucking of a comb. I wanted to turn around to see with my own eyes what was chasing me now that it was busy with a taste of me. But every part of my body told me not to turn around, not to look. The lights above my head began to flicker and go out. With it came the silence. There was no more licking and I felt the spine tingling feeling of the eyes behind me so I bolted. I didn't make it far before my feet were swept from under me causing me to tumble to the ground. I felt the sensation of blood leaving my body again now from my ankle. I tried getting up, tried getting away but I was swatted again, this time into the shelves.

Pain shot up through my body as I now lay in the next aisle, my spine feeling as if I fell from a rooftop, and my side feeling as if I got punched by a professional boxer. I knew it was almost on top of me. I could smell it now. It was as if the sewers of a city were condensed into a small spray bottle and a child got a hold of it spraying it all over your face. I tried to move as fast as I could to the end of the aisle but I was met with the weight of a shelf crashing down on top of me. And to my horror I felt its weight being applied on top of it. The plucking of the comb ever so loud now, I could sense its face next to mine. I knew I should have gone to the party, that I should have been selfish. I'm sure whatever Wayne is dealing with is not worth my life. But here I was because I wanted this boy to like me. Now I'm going to die alone in the dark by the means of this monster. I finally felt its breath on my neck and that's when I heard it. The sound of snapping lettuce, my only thought was that it was its jaw slowly opening to consume me. I couldn't look at it, I didnt wanna open my eyes, I didnt wanna see it coming.

But as soon as everything started it stopped, I was met with a blinding white light. I expected to be dead, that I made it to heaven. Then I heard knocking. It was quiet in the distance at first. It slowly grew in volume until it was loud and banging in my head as well. Slowly opening my eyes and looking towards the source I spotted Wayne and a police officer at the main door. Wayne Finally got the door open and when they opened the door I heard the officer calling for an ambulance. Reaching me, Wayne lifted off the shelf from my body. While the officer tried to clear more around me. Realizing the beast could still be around I tried to quickly get up and warn them but my body winced and didn't want to move. I looked over to the officer and told him it was still in here.

The Officer quickly pulled out his gun and began to search the area. Wayne had gently lifted my head up onto his lap while we waited, my arm still bleeding, I heard the officer come back saying there was no sign of anything. He traded places with Wayne upon request and heading towards the back office the power was soon restored. He came back saying the first tank was empty. With the lights coming on I was blinded again I wasn't sure how long I was out for. By the time the ambulance arrived, my arm and ankle was being wrapped up as I tried telling both of them everything that had happened, both looking at me unsure of my story. I groaned out of frustration watching the cop leave to get the paramedics. Then I remembered something I shot up with a wince and shouted “The Cameras!”. And I made my way to the backroom Wayne trying to stop me. But this was my chance to prove this wasn't just some bear. I quickly sat down and shook the mouse to wake up the computer. But nothing happened, I remember the power went out so I reached down to turn on the switch and pressed it. But I was met with the feeling of wetness and no power. Looking down in confusion the hot chocolate wasn't fully stopped by the napkins and had leaked into the computer frying it.

I sat there defeated, shortly after the paramedics showed up with a stretcher guided by Wayne. As they wheeled me out I told them to wait and waved over the cop.

Kaitlyn: “Hey did you check for the deer by the trash?” I said with some kind of hope in my voice.

Officer: “Yeah I looked and there is a deer back there alright, in very bad shape. I'm guessing it got hit by a commercial truck in a hurry trying to get ahead of the snowfall. It seems it did not suffer long because the heart seems to have exploded. Least that's what I can guess from the mess.”

Laying back in the stretcher devoid of any more will, I waited for the Paramedics to load me up into the ambulance. That's when I noticed a trail of tracks leading from the store to the tree line. And it seemed every print was of a different animal and that's when I saw the backend of a deer vanish into the treeline.

I was treated at the hospital and the whole situation was written off as a bear attack. A few people have gone missing from the party and they still haven't found any traces of them. Wayne did make it up to me, He showed up almost everyday I was in the hospital with some kind of homemade dish. They weren't that good but he tried, and said he was sorry every time. He told me the situation was his drunken father causing issues at home. And he went home to protect his mother and sisters. He said his father is in rehab and doing better.

But now I'm sitting here in my room at my computer typing this all out for all of you so that my story can get out there. So that others can be warned that there is something out there, something watching. But as I'm almost finished writing this the sound of a comb being plucked has started in my closet and it's been getting louder. With the same uneasy feeling I'm being Watched.
