I (F25) am a regular at my local adult store.  I strip as a side job, so I visit the store every couple weeks to browse the new stock for outfits/accessories I can wear on stage. I’ve become very familiar with the store’s layout, especially the video section.

For context: My dancer friends and I thought it would be funny to have old adult videos playing in our dressing room so we could laugh at the terrible acting between sets.  We set up a TV, DVD player and little bookshelf to store the movies we brought in.  After a bit, we got bored of watching the same couple videos and decided to start looking for more to fill out our collection.  As it turns out, the adult store I frequent has a decently sized video section, so my friends and I started shopping around for eye-catching titles whenever we were there. We had collected videos of just about everything.  On any given day, you could walk back in from your set to the sounds of some guys' balls slapping or forced moans.  It was a bit strange at times, but it brought us some laughs. 

During a solo trip to the adult store, I was browsing the movies as usual when something caught my eye.  There was a stack of VHS tapes sitting beside one of the DVD shelves.  I’d never seen tapes in the video section before so naturally I decided to check them out.  There were 12 in total and all of them were unlabeled.  I had an old VCR at home and figured they could be something interesting, so I brought them to the cashier who told me she had never seen them before.  She let me take them anyway since they didn’t seem to belong to anyone and they weren’t a part of the store's inventory. 

We didn’t have a VHS player at work so I knew I wouldn’t be able to share them with my friends until I digitized them. (I was a child of the 90s, so I kept my old vcr/dvd player for nostalgia reasons).  I was so excited to find something potentially rare to show my friends that as soon as I got home, I plugged in my VCR and started recording the footage onto a DVD before even watching it for myself.  

 It was when I tested the DVD copies of the films for the first time that I realized I wouldn’t be able to play these at work (or anywhere for that matter).  The contents of the video were so disturbing that I couldn’t stomach watching it all the way through.  I was speechless, I didn’t know how to react and since the videos were unlabeled, I had no clue where they came from or if they were real.  It was pure filth.  From the parts that I did see, the videos appeared to be centered around two masked girls who thrived on sadomasochism, necrophilia, and haematophilia. The videos were split into segments, starting with the short haired girl. The video began in the dark, she entered the frame, lit only with a blacklight that emphasized the fresh sores on her cheeks. Her hands made their way into the frame and it became clear that she was holding a knife. She placed the blade to her tongue, detached it fully and placed it on a tray. This tray was filled with tongues, I mean FILLED. I counted at least 10, I couldn't fathom where she got that many from, I began to feel ill.  She sprinkled something on top of them (could be drugs but im unsure) and they became mobile. The detached tongues were literally dancing on top of her naked body, leaving trails of saliva behind. It was very disturbing, but my final straw was intact until the second girls segment came on. It began with her unzipping a body bag. It looked incredibly real, as someone who doesn't watch horror movies often it was hard for me to tell. She pulled out a drill and brought it towards the supposed victim's head. That's when I closed my laptop with such force that I thought I cracked the screen. I ejected the DVD and haven't touched it since, for fear of my own sanity. 


The video seemed to be the first episode of a series (series of horrors, if you ask me). I knew I needed to find out more about them and where they came from after seeing that. What was the  purpose of this? Is it real? So many questions left unanswered.  This is why I’ve decided to share my story with you today. I've tried typing keywords into different sites and looking through hundreds of videos to find them, no need to suggest it. I haven’t found anything relating to these two girls anywhere. I plan on uploading the videos to my reddit account so that hopefully someone can help me. In the meantime, if you know anything please send me a DM or email me at Pandoralenore99@gmail.com. Any help is appreciated, thanks.
