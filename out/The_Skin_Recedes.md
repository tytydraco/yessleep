**January 21st, 2024**



I'm around 20 years old and starting to go bald. I knew this was something that happened to a lot of men in their late 20s.



But I thought I had more time, I guess I'm one of the early cases.



It started small and barely noticeable. I noticed one day that my hair looked thinner than usual. When I would shower, I saw more hairs circling the drain.



My once luscious and thick locks are turning into a massive widow's peak; the hair on either side creeps more upward.



It's not fair, I see my friends around the same age with perfect heads of hair. Why am I the only one dealing with this shit?



My teeth haven't been the best either. I'll admit I haven't been the best about keeping up to date with dental hygiene daily.



So I have some cavities that need filling. I should also ask the dentist about my gums; they are receding.



Looking online, I've found different solutions for male pattern baldness. I'll give it a try.



I'm also vigorously researching other ways to keep your hair intact; things like sea salt spray for volume, or biotin & rosemary oil. Stuff like that couldn't hurt.



I’ve heard that keeping a journal/dream journal can benefit your life, so here I am. I should talk about my dreams from last night.



I was at a party, and my hair was the thickest I've ever had. Talking to this girl I like, she suddenly looked disgusted at me.



Then, as if out of a movie, the music scratched, and the party stopped. Everybody was staring at me now.



Looks of surprise, contempt, or disgust were shot at me from every direction. Then a mirror appeared in front of me out of nowhere.



I had no hair on the top of my head, and the hair I did have on my sides was sticking directly outwards. I looked like I was ninety years old.



My focus shifted to a woman leaving the party; a black veil covered her face. It was impossible to see any defining features.



I woke up and ran to the mirror. While I did still appear to be thinning, the hair was still there for the most part.



Other than that vivid nightmare, I can't complain. Life has been going well enough for me.



I'm in college right now, I have a group of friends, a job that isn't too demanding but pays well enough, and I have been talking to that girl from my dream, and I think she likes me!



Anyway, that's all I have to write for now.



**April 15th, 2024**



So I've been using this subscription for the better part of a few months. I got these chewable tablets that have minoxidil and finasteride in them.



In addition, I've also purchased a few bottles of this topical solution; it has the same stuff in it, so I'm not sure if it'll make a difference, but I'm desperately trying to cling to the hair I have left.



In addition to the chewables and topical foam, I've built an exhausting routine—oils, pills, rollers, foams, and more. If a YouTube video said it helped hair growth, I tried it.



All things that are supposed to benefit my hair, and I feel like it's working. At least, I think so. It's hard to tell any significant differences.



My hair has certainly stopped thinning at the progressive rate it was before, and I can see some new hairs that weren't there before popping up in my hairline. All in all, it's a habit I must implement into my daily schedule.



Still, it bothers me that I even have to take these drastic measures to maintain my hair. It doesn't feel like anyone my age has to deal with these problems.



My gums are starting to inflame more and more. I think I have gingivitis. I'm also starting to get more dull tooth pains from my cavities.



Inspecting my chompers in the mirror has revealed the true nature of my teeth. They've taken on a yellow hue, and my gums have receded by a few millimeters.



I've kept up on my daily brushing and flossing, albeit I forget some nights, but I've been good for the most part. I never saw a dentist earlier this year, but I really should.



Other than that, life has been going well for me. Me and that girl have been going strong for a couple months now, her name is Casey and she's beautiful.



I don't deserve her, but that's the negative self-talk creeping in. She tells me how wonderful I am and how good I treat her all the time, but that could be the honeymoon phase of our relationship.



We'll hang out with our circle of friends. None of us can go to bars yet, so we usually hang out in a friend's dorm room, go out to house parties, or go camping—just your usual college lifestyle.



In a moment of vulnerability, I asked Casey,



"Babe, do you think I'm going bald?"



She looked a little surprised.



"What? No, silly. Your hair looks fine! It's soft too; whatever you've been doing in your routine is doing wonders for your hair. It's never looked better." She said,



That surprised me; I thought I was still thinning rapidly. But she's telling me that my hair's never looked better. Weird.



In my dreams last night, I was there with Casey again. We were under the moonlight in the trees, as the fog from a nearby waterfall cascaded around us.



We were both littered in long hair, strange garments, and a mystical attire that heavily contrasted our standard college outfit of sweats and a t-shirt.



We were holding hands, and she looked into my eyes. Then, with a deepened look of remorse, she retreated from me.



"Where are you going?" I asked somberly, almost knowing the answer to my question.



She turned to look upon a figure that rested on a cliff nearby, which was slightly higher than ours. I couldn't make it out at first, but then I was sure of it.



That was me, but a better version of myself. She started to pursue this man, as I raised both hands in my sight.



They were old and decrepit, scabs and thin skin composed my wrinkled arms. My long flowing hair was gone.



I reached out to Casey, crying out, but they were gone before I knew it, and I was left alone.



I noticed a beautiful humming behind me as I kneeled, tears streaming down my face. I turned to look upon an angelic woman with a melodious voice at a distance.



There she sat lustfully, legs crossed, in a scarlet delancey chair without a single piece of clothing to cover her. The woman brushed her luxurious brunette strands while looking through a handheld golden carved mirror embellished with intricate leaves and curves.



She stopped to look at me. Her eyes widened, and her lips curled into a sinister smile.



Raising her fair hand, she motioned for me to come forth with a single finger. She was alluring yet inaccessible, as every step I took towards her resulted in the same interval between us.



I woke up in my dorm with a feeling of anguish and desperation that was so unreal.



I hope this hair regimen pays off. But that's all I care to write about at the moment.



I need to get some fresh air.



**May 15th, 2024**



I don't know what went wrong. My hair was doing fine until the past week.



Small hairs around the shower drain have turned into clumps that have vacated my scalp, never to return. Why is God singling me out?



What have I done to deserve this? I've always thought I was a good person. I'm no saint, but there are far more evil people in this world who have a thick head of hair.



Nobody seems to notice anything, though. My girlfriend will playfully run her hand across my head, as if to mess my hair up.



She tells me I look great. Is she fucking taunting me?



My toothaches are starting to exacerbate as well. What was once a minor, dull pain is beginning to envelop my entire mouth.



My gums are swelling so heavily that it feels like my teeth are trying to escape. To explode out of my mouth.



A couple of weeks ago, I went to a dentist, who told me I had no cavities and that my teeth and gums were perfectly fine.



He just doesn't want to do his job, and he wouldn’t even prescribe me pain meds. Fucking asshole.



I've been taking ibuprofen more and more, with less effect. There's only so much it can do when I take so much daily.



I'm meticulously scouring the internet for a solution. I've read through every Quora and Reddit forum to find answers on what might help—every male hair product review.



Everything, and I keep getting conflicting responses. "This works wonders" to "don't waste your money" for the same product.



I could take a personal loan out for a hair transplant. But do I want to take on that debt?



I'm already paying off a car, and piling up more student loan debt every semester. What's $5-7k more?



People around me, my work acquaintances, friends, and even my girlfriend have told me I seem more high-strung and irritable lately. Nobody's made a single comment about my appearance.



Were they trying not to hurt me? Are they just lying to my face and telling me I look good?



After hours of searching, I've found something. And it is the most promising result thus far.



A cost-effective capsule solution by an online brand named "Vanity". They didn't have a single other product on their website, only this.



It was called "Solution", and it was $49.50. All the reviews were glowing, but I couldn't click on any of their names.



I was so desperate that I ordered it. It should be here in a week or two.



I should write down my dream last night. I was in an old Victorian bedroom where I met the woman again. She was right in front of me.



Still bare and unabashed. She was brushing her hair as usual through a large vanity mirror, this time.



She didn't acknowledge me, so I sat there and felt compelled to watch her.



I wanted to understand her, maybe she could reveal something in my hidden psyche that I wasn't aware of. But she continued ignoring me, humming the same song I didn't know.



This went on for what felt like hours. I tried to leave through the door, but it was locked.



I tried to say something to her, I don't remember what, but it didn't matter either way. She was ignoring me entirely.



However, there was no threat or malice. On the contrary, I felt comfortable.



That's all that happened.



**May 30th, 2024**



So, yesterday I received a package in the mail. There was no return address or anything to indicate where it came from.



I opened it up to reveal a small, white prescription bottle. There were no labels; it was blank and void of any warnings, facts, or ingredients that would give any information.



Opening the bottle, I discovered a pill twice the size of a quarter. It was black like obsidian.



The pill resembled an artifact more than medicine. It had a shiny coat and was warm to the touch, almost humming in my palm.



I tried to find the website where I found the pill, but I couldn't find a single page to indicate it ever existed. I even searched throughout my browsing history from that day, and I did find the link, but a 404 error popped up.



Fuck it, down the hatch.



It was a hard pill to swallow, and even drinking water simultaneously proved difficult. But eventually, I was able to get the lump in my throat to descend further into my stomach.



A strange noise emanated from my stomach, like the pill expanded rapidly with a hiss. My stomach bloated a bit, then deflated back to normal.



In my dreams last night, I was in the same room with that gorgeous woman whom I've never met in the conscious plane of reality. Only this time, as she brushed her hair and looked through the mirror, her gaze fell upon me, disapproving and angry.



I asked her what I did wrong, knowing she was implicating me in something, but she just shook her head and kept brushing. She was judging me.



I awoke this morning, got up to get ready, and as I went to the bathroom mirror, I saw that my hair was all back. In fact, it never looked thicker.



I was ecstatic. Finally, my hair is back and I don't have to worry so much. My teeth still hurt, but there's another solution I can find for that.



It took me a while to stop gushing and feeling through my thick strands of newly formed hair, but eventually I went out with some friends to go hiking.



Casey was with us, and I asked her if she noticed anything different. She just shrugged and said I look the same as always.



I was annoyed by her statement, but who cares? I'm finally free of this burden.



Anyway, that's all I have to say for now. I think I'm gonna brush my beautiful hair, I'm so excited!



**August 1st, 2024**



All my hair is gone. Last week, I woke up to find it looked the same as it did before I took the pill, and this morning it's just gone.



My head is barren, not a single hair to be found. It's almost like there was never any in the first place.



Investigating the top of my head proved to be fruitless. There were no pores on my epidermis to show that any hair follicle ever existed.



I can't go out like this, I can't let people see me. My dorm roommate almost came into my room, and I told him I didn't want to come out right now.



Like a cruel twist of the tooth fairy tale, I found one of my teeth on my pillow. But I haven't seen any missing hair anywhere.



Where could it possibly have gone?



I'm freaking out, I don't know what happened, but it's all gone, and now I can't do anything. I haven't stopped crying.



Last night, I dreamt of myself in that moonlit forest clearing on the cliff's edge with the waterfall nearby. I was lying on a hospital bed.



That same woman and Casey were behind me as I was lying down. They both cradled my head in their hands, kissing my forehead.



It felt like absolute bliss, and I didn't want to wake up. But then I did, seemingly into my absolute nightmare.



I can't write anymore; my tears are dropping onto the page, and they smear the ink.



**August 8th, 2024**



Casey is worried about me; she doesn't understand the pain I'm going through. There's no way I could make her understand my situation, so I almost don't want to bother.



I've tried explaining it to her, but we've discussed this before.



She said, "You know, maybe this is just in your head, babe. You've been working and studying like crazy lately."



I responded to her in disbelief, "There's no way that could possibly be what the cause is, Casey. This is all real. My hair is gone, my teeth are in so much pain, and I can't even think straight. I mean, three of my teeth have already fallen out."



She examined my mouth and shook her head.



"Babe, your teeth are all still there. I really don't know what you're talking about. And you still have your hair, too. I think you're just imagining things." She said,



"How could you say that to me? You have no idea how this feels. I mean, look at this!" I responded, holding out one of my teeth to her.



She looked at it and laughed.



"This is just a crumpled-up piece of paper."



I looked closely at it, and she was right. I felt my head, and there was still hair.



She grabbed my face and said, "I love you, but I really think you need to relax. I hear you, and I'm here for you. But I can't participate in your delusions. Maybe you just need some time off. You know, like a break from it all."



She grabbed my arm and leaned into me as we sat under a shady tree on campus. Maybe she was right; this is in my head.



Lately, however, more than my hair and my teeth have been messing with me. My skin had a mild tingling sensation all over, and my muscles, tendons, eyelids, ear canal, nose, throat, nails, and other parts of my body I can’t describe have all felt sore.



"Let's go on a vacation, we still have some time before next semester starts. We can go visit my family in Florida. You can meet them, and the beaches in that area are so pretty!" She suggested.



"That sounds like a great idea, babe. Let's do it." I said,



And just like that, on a whim, we packed our things and were off.



**August 18th, 2024**



Casey left me. She can't deal with my condition.



We went to Florida, and things were going off without a hitch. I met her parents, and they seemed to like me. We had a great week, going out around the town and to the beaches in the area.



For a brief time, it seemed like everything was normal with me. I was fine, and everything was in my head.



Until the day we got back. I had a mental breakdown after looking at myself in the mirror.



My hair was all gone again, and so were all of my teeth. Until then, my gums were still receding at a growing pace. But now my teeth have vanished.



She noticed that I wasn't okay and asked what was wrong. I freaked out and kept shouting that my teeth and hair were gone repeatedly while hyperventilating.



She had had enough by this point. Not angry at me, or resentful, or anything. She couldn't deal with this anymore.



She told me we should take a break and suggested I seek professional help.



I haven't had any dreams lately.



**August 31st, 2024**



I'm taking the semester off. I quit my job and moved back in with my parents for the time being.



I didn't feel like I could deal with everything right now, not with my condition. I still had a decent amount of funds left from working and school loans, so I wasn't hurting for money.



My parents haven't said anything about my appearance, and they seemed surprised that I came back out of nowhere. I just told them I needed some time off to figure things out.



Every time I look in the mirror, I see the appearance of somebody who is falling apart at the seams. But everyone in my life thinks I look just fine, but highly stressed.



From my perspective, my hair is still gone, and all my teeth have fallen out, and I can't shake this perspective. Before, I could wake up from the illusion, but not anymore.



Fingernails and toenails feel loose, like they could fall off at any moment, and it's getting harder to blink. I'm having trouble swallowing and sometimes even breathing.



My ears and nose have begun secreting substances, almost like they're evacuating everything that inhabits them. It's getting more challenging to move as my muscles and tendons feel tighter, and my hands shape into claws when not in motion.



Open sores are forming along the skin on my face and body, as well as in my mouth, and even my most private parts weren't spared, as my whole body disintegrated. My pores are now open craters.



My stomach is also in constant pain; something is unraveling inside. I'm sure of it.



I still haven't had any dreams lately.



**September 30th, 2024**



I'm in the hospital, with no hope of leaving anytime soon. My mind is clouded with doubt and agony as the doctors analyze my entire self to see what exactly is going on.



They don't see what I do; my whole body has become an open wound. From what I can gather, they seem to think I'm suffering from a case of body dysmorphic disorder, and I'm the only one who can see what's going on.



Last night, I saw her again. Not Casey, but the woman from my dreams.



This time, I stood with her under the moonlight in the trees. Fog from a nearby waterfall cascaded around us.



We were holding hands, and she looked into my eyes. Then, with a deepened look of remorse and betrayal, she retreated from me.



I asked where she was going, but I knew it was hopeless. She stopped walking, turned her head towards me, and with a bitter tone, she said, "You did this to yourself."



After that, she continued walking to somebody in the distance. This time it was a hooded figure.



The only difference with the woman this time is that now she was fully clothed. Wearing a long black dress that swept the ground beneath her feet.



I just stood there in shock as they disappeared. Nothing left to say, nothing left to try, and I had a gut feeling that I was about to come to a bitter end.



I woke up this morning with a searing, intense pain all over my body. Limping slowly over to the bathroom mirror revealed the culmination of what has been cursing me all along.



In my reflection, I saw a body so contorted and disfigured. I couldn't believe it was mine.



Blinking to break from this horror was impossible because my eyelids had receded into obscurity. My exposed eyeballs were hanging on for dear life, and I struggled to look straight into the mirror without them slumping to the side.



My ears and nose were tiny scabbed holes now. My jaw stuck to the top of my chest, and I couldn't close it.



My teeth had vanished prior. Now the gums had retreated so drastically that bone was revealed on the top and bottom.



Three ample folds at the top of my head indicated that my scalp had receded to the point that it almost looked like someone tied my head skin into a ponytail. I didn't have lips anymore; they were so far removed that only little skin folds remained.



A horrifying revelation unraveled as I discovered my tongue was missing now, and my uvula was a sad little dried-up sack that looked like it was about to snap off.



Enormous lesions and openings were scattered throughout my entire body. My tendons had pulled all of my appendages into a twisted state.



My elbows were strapped to my side, my forearms pointing in different directions, and my hands took on the mannerisms of a dinosaur. Coiled back to the point of no return.



My hips were so warped that they leaned to the side. I appeared to be mimicking a decrepit dance pose from which I couldn't escape.



My fingernails were gone, and what remained were holes that were pulled back beyond where they should've been.



I saw my lungs through openings in my rib cage. They were twice as small now, and fighting to pump oxygen.



I could feel the tension in each tendon, causing them to snap individually. I froze in agony.



Every blood vessel was withdrawing inward in real time. Parts of my intestines were slipping out of the many holes that lined my stomach as my spinal cord inched further and further back.



Pieces of muscle were falling off of me, slipping out of the several lacerations. I could see my bones peering out all around.



Just like that, the tendons above my ankle separated into a ball at the top of each of my calves. I fell to the ground.



Stuck in place, I could do nothing. Nothing, but scream.



I blacked out from the pain and awoke in a hospital bed.



Every second I lie here, I feel waves of surging pain coursing throughout my body. My entire being wants to spiral into itself.



My thoughts feel like they're also being stretched, and I'm starting to forget who I was before all of this.



This will be my last journal entry as I struggle to write more and more. I can't put the pen to paper without blood puddling up on the pages.



A blood-soaked book that reverts to normal at a second glance.



I tilted slightly to the door, left ajar. In the reflection of the rectangular window, there the woman stood. Smiling at me, almost satisfied.



Then she left, whistling that song I had never heard before I met her.
