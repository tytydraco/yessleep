It all started when I woke up in my school. I accidentally slept late and it was night time and everyone else had left, except for the janitor who kind enough to leave the door open so I could leave.

I grabbed my backpack and headed out of the school, the stars twinkling in the night sky and a full moon out. I was worried my mom would think I was kidnapped or got killed, so I sped-walked to my house. It was a couple block away from the school but not too many.

I then noticed a strange-looking man stare at me from the side of the road. I sped-walked faster but he slowly followed me. So then I began to ran and the strange man followed suit. But he was too fast. He eventually caught up to me and knocked me out cold for what seemed like an eternity.

Seemingly a couple hours later, something like tapping on my face woke me. Its texture felt like human skin, probably a finger or a hand. I woke up to see an elderly man. He had white hair, blue eyes and was wearing a suit and tie. I was tied up to a hospital bed in a dark room.

Me: “What…? What’s going on?!”

Man: “Oh! 85! You’re awake! I was worried you were gonna be one of my many failures.”

Me: “What’s going on?! Where am I?”

Man: “Calm down, 85. Everything will be alright.”

Me: “Let me go!”

Man: “Not yet, I need to check for any abnormalities.”

The man then grabbed a flashlight and began analyzing my body head to toe. I was assuming the worst if I screamed or tried to break free from the hospital bed I was tied to. After a a few minutes, the man stopped analyzing.

Man: “Okay! No abnormalities! I’m so glad! It’s very, very rare to get a successful subject.”

Me: “What are you talking about?!”

Man: “I said not to worry. You’ll figure out soon.”

The man then turned around standing in front of a door.

Man: “Guards! He’s ready!”

At first, I thought he was speaking to no one as a joke because the room was so dark. But then two men wearing green military uniforms with helmets on untie me but then start to grab and carry me. I started to struggle and freak out.

Me: “Let me go! Help! Somebody help me!!”

Man: “Hold on, guards. I have to relax him first. Pin him down.”

The man’s guards then pin me down to floor. The man then grabbed a syringe filled with some kind of strange, pink liquid. He then walked over to me.

Man: “Don’t worry, 85. You won’t feel a thing.”

The man then injected me in the neck. I felt the sharp pain in my neck as the guards loosened their grip on me.

Man: “There… you’ll be asleep for a bit. But when you wake up, you’ll meet some new friends! They’ll be happy to see a new buddy!”

The man smiled as I stared at him with anger and fear. My eyelids started to get heavy as I tried to stay awake, but then I feel asleep. 

When I woke up again, I seemed to be in some sort of bedroom, it was large too. My ears were ringing and my vision was a bit blurry. I stood up and rubbed my eyes.

My blurry vision went away but my ears were still ringing a bit. I observed the bedroom and found four other people staring at me from the left. I jumped back in shock and saw a door. I rushed towards it but it was locked.

Me: “Hey! Hey! Let me out!! I don’t wanna be here!! I wanna go home!!!”

I began to pound at the door, desperately wanting to go home.

Me: “No… I just wanna go home…”

I said, tragically knowing my fate was sealed. I looked up at the four people. They were adults and had sympathetic looks on their faces. I calmed down a little after realizing they weren’t going to hurt me as the ringing in my ears went away.

I slowly stood up and continued to look at them. They had hospital gowns with a number embroidered on each of their gowns. All of them had strange appearances.

Me: “Who are you?”

A young woman walked up to me first. She was the only woman in the group looked normal, but she had an old 80’s TV for a head. On her screen, was a simple, expressive emoticon face that moved when she talked.

TV Woman: “First day, huh? We freaked out on our first day, too. But it’s going to be alright. We’ll explain everything soon.”

Me: “What… happened to your head?”

The TV Woman looked a bit uncomfortable when I asked that, almost like it was a personal question.

Suddenly, a tall, fat, bald man with pale skin, praying mantis-like arms and pure white eyes spoke up.

Mantis Man: “He experimented on all of us. Our bodies and brains. He changed all of us completely. You’re just the newest. If you wanna check your new body out, there’s a mirror here.”

I walked over to the mirror the Mantis Man was talking about and looked at myself and my eyes widened at my new appearance.

I used to look like an average boy. I used to have brown hair, brown eyes and have freckles across my nose.

But now, that man had turned me into something strange.

I now had black hair and two short horns coming out of my head. My left eye was now red and my right eye was yellow. My skin was pale white and had sharp teeth, like some kind of rabid, wild animal.

And I was wearing a blue hospital gown like the rest, with the number “85” embroidered on it.

As I stared in awe at my new look, another man from the group walked up to me. He had very long blonde hair with a beard and blue eyes. He had robot arms and legs.

Robo-Guy: “Welcome to your new home, kid. Hope you can get used to it.”

TV Woman: “32, don’t be rude. He’s just a kid.”

Subject 32/Robo-Guy: “Whatever you say, 64.”

Me: “Why are you guys calling each other by your numbers? Just call each other by your names.”

Subject 64/TV Woman: “It’s not that simple.”

Me: “Why not? I’ll just introduce myself. Simple. My name is…”

Before I could say my name, I seemingly forgot it. And a few things from my life, too.

Me: “What…? Oh my god! Oh my god! I can’t remember my name! I can’t remember the faces of my family and friends too!”

Subject 32/Robo-Guy: “We all did. When we arrive, The Doctor preforms his surgeries on us, he erases the memories of our names and what our family and friends looked like. That, and we’re also stuck at the age we’re at after the surgery. So it looks like you’re gonna be a kid forever! Haha!”

The final member of the group, an Asian man with dyed purple hair and sea green eyes that wore a blue medical mask, spoke up too.

Mask Man: “He’s right. I had to suffer the most. I’ve been here the longest!”

He points to the number on his gown; 11.

Me: “Oh my god… I’m really gonna miss my mom and friends. But… since I’m here now… I have to accept this place as my new home… and being called 85.”

I sat down on one of the beds and 64 sat down next to me.

Subject 64/TV Woman: “I know it’s scary, but everything will be alright.”

She said in a motherly tone. I smiled a bit at her words.

Suddenly, the door began to open and it was the man. The damn doctor that turned me and four other innocent people into freaks of nature. I wanted to punch him, but his guards would probably hurt me if I did.

The Doctor: “Attention, my subjects! Since 85 is the newest, you all deserve a free day!”

He said, in a happy tone. He then pulled out five vanilla ice cream cones in a box holding them.

The Doctor: “Who wants ice cream?”

Subject 32/Robo-Guy: “I’m down. Heh.”

32 grabbed an ice cream and started eating as I stared at The Doctor with pure hate.

Everyone else got their ice cream and I came around to eat my ice cream, too.

Me and the other four just hung out for the rest of the day, with me being a little happy that they will be there for me and I will be there for them.
