I don’t know if anyone will believe me, or if I even exist to be believed anymore. I just need… someone to listen. Maybe that’s all I have left.

My name is Giana. Thirty-six, Quality Analyst for a call center here in Manila. No kids, though I might’ve thought about it, once upon a time. I worked the night shift last night, November 1st—a day when everyone else in the Philippines would be with family, remembering their loved ones. But not me. Gotta pay the bills. Gotta keep this machine running, right?

So there I was, analyzing calls, like always. But then I found… a weird one.

It was an inbound call with no agent assigned to it. Just a long, empty recording. Curious, I put on my headset and listened.

And it was *not* empty. At first, it was distant, faint, just low murmuring. But soon it turned… dark. Out of this world. Animalistic, like the gnashing of teeth, howling—sounds I couldn’t recognize. I should’ve stopped listening, but I couldn’t tear myself away. The longer I listened, the more it got inside my head, making me feel… hunted. It was 11.1 minutes long, 666 seconds, basically. No assignee, just random gibberish text. I shrugged it off and noted that sometimes the system does record ambient sounds and maybe people were vacuuming. 

I took my break to get some air. No one wanted this shift, everyone wanted to honor the dead or something. Fine. I was alone in the entire QA floor. If I wasn't gunning for a promotion, I would have skipped this shift too but I needed to prove to Randy, our boss, that I'm worth it. I was getting fatigued though, this is the nth call I've listened to and the reports are due later. The agents are in another floor, and that's a probably livelier, happier floor than I'm in right now, but hey, I do prefer being alone anyhow.   
  
I went down to the 7-Eleven downstairs for a cigarette. But as I stood there, something was… off. There were people around, sure, but not my usual fellow night-shifters. They were younger, dressed… bizarrely. More formally, like as if in a job interview situation, but oddly enough, some of them were sporting some dog ears and fangs, puffing on what looked like smoke but felt too… thick and smelled nothing like vape flavors (unless cinnamon or burnt sandalwood are all the rage now). They laughed in deep, guttural tones and called each other names that sounded like something from a video game: “Marbas,” “Forneus” And they didn’t even blink at me, like I was invisible.

I brushed it off. Maybe it was just some Halloween prank that ran late, right?

When lunch break hit, I decided to walk home to eat instead of having something delivered. I wasn't really particularly hungry though. Besides, I had some leftovers to reheat.

I don’t even know why I try to keep up with it all—the cooking, and cleaning, even though he barely lifts a finger. My husband, he’s been drifting for a while now. Barely does anything but sleep, game, or ignore me. But I made peace with it… or so I thought. At least he was home, right?

I unlocked the door quietly and walked in, hearing some low murmuring from our bedroom. I thought maybe he’d left the TV on while he slept, but when I stepped into the bedroom, I froze.

There was a woman on top of him, straddling his sleeping body, her face close to his like she was… *feeding* off him. Her eyes shot to mine, blazing with an unnatural, red glow, and she smiled with a mouth full of sharp teeth. He's *into* this? I noticed his breathing is like when he's in deep sleep. He's into *this*?! Since when?!! 

“Oh, *you’re* here,” she purred, sounding as if she was irritated by my presence. “I thought you’d be back later. He told me he was lonely, after all.”

She's wearing a red skimpy dress and made up in what seems like sequins and glitter on her face? She's gorgeous but the fake red eyes and sharp teeth makes her look pretty demonic. This girl had the audacity to attend some Halloween party then come for my husband? Maybe this is why he's online so much, to discuss their sick fantasies with each other! 

I was so furious I didn’t even think—I lunged at her. We struggled, but she was stronger, holding me back with barely any effort. “I don’t care if you’re his wife,” she hissed, “He wants me. Don’t worry, you’ll get yours soon enough.”

And then she walked out, leaving nothing but a lingering smell of burnt cinnamon.

I turned to my husband, shaking him by the shoulders. “Wake up, *gago*!” I shouted, over and over, but he didn’t even stir. He lay there, breathing in shallow, weak gasps, his face pale and waxy.

I was shaking, livid, heartbroken. I didn’t know what to do, so I just… left. I figured maybe once he’d wake up and realize he’d messed up, he'd come crawling back. Maybe that lady will tell him I caught them and he's so drugged or high to even notice. So I went back to work, trying to act like nothing happened, telling myself it was just a trick of exhaustion.

But when I got to my floor, I saw… *me*. Sitting right there at my desk, typing away.

The “me” at the desk didn’t even look up. Just kept typing, doing my job, like everything was normal. I tried to get someone’s attention, but no one acknowledged me. I waved, called out, tried to tap a coworker’s shoulder—but nothing. I was invisible.

I don’t know where I am anymore. Or *who* I am. It’s like I’m a ghost, a stranger in my own life, watching myself go through the motions. I’m stuck, typing into the void. My life’s a loop I can’t escape from, and no one can hear me scream.

Please, if anyone can read this… help me. Please tell me what I should do.

What’s happening to me? Am I dead? Am I… forgotten?
