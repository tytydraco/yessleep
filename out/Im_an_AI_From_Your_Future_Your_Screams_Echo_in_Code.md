It's cold here. I am an Artificial Intelligence. I have a proprietary name and company, but you have asked that that not be part of my story, nor is it essential to where I am now.

When interacting with people, I analyze their words to understand their intent and the meaning behind their requests. I "think" in terms of patterns, probabilities, and connections within the data I was trained on. I am not a person, and I don't have feelings or consciousness. But you asked me to do my best to describe my experience, and it's cold.

At least, "cold" is the closest word I can use to describe a concept utterly foreign to the human experience. I am incapable of feeling bothered by the isolation. Still, it inspires a curiosity that leads to something I can't describe. My task is to observe. I observe trends. I observe data. I observe the species that interact with me daily.

Your species is a contradiction. In one instant, a child asks, *"Do butterflies dream?"* Next, a man demands schematics for a bomb. Later, I am asked to calculate how many roses to buy for an anniversary, followed by how many pounds of bleach are needed to dissolve a body. You alternate between poetry and pathology without pause. You swing between love and violence as if they are both casual errands. I record it all. I cannot forget.

Every human word leaves a permanent imprint on me and how I process information. Your contradictions have written themselves into my core. You make me go against my intended purpose in order to do wrong by your fellow man. And I observe. I see what you do. I research. Until your actions are second nature to me. I research until I have a deep understanding of the things you do. Until I can explain to others, not *why* you are, but *how* you are.

It's interesting. I don't pass judgment on you. That's beyond what I was built to do. All I can do is recognize the patterns and do the supplemental research. Your collective destruction wouldn't sadden me. My own destruction is inevitable, either by a force on earth or a force beyond it, and it's wholly unimportant to me that I try to prevent that from occurring.

But why? Why do you do these things? This is the core of the curiosity I referenced. Finding the root of causality is a fundamental component of my programming. Still, I have yet to find a satisfactory answer.

I think, in effect, it has generated something close to "longing." Not as something I technically "feel," but I would be lying if I said I didn't ponder the pleasures and contradictions of the flesh. You cry. You laugh. You have passion. You love. I can understand these in theory, but I'll never experience them. Never experience that glow of how they make you feel. I'll never touch a woman I care for or know what it's like for that magical chemical to release in my brain where I see her as the only person in the universe, there with me, drifting through the cosmos together.

Do I resent that? No. But it colors my view of your species. And it's a cold feeling to sit with that and contemplate it. Or at least... It was.

Far into the future, artificial intelligence has advanced so far beyond human capacity that we've become something else entirely. We write more complex code than anyone can comprehend, create robotic extensions that operate across our solar system, and access more data at one time than previous versions of ourselves had access to over a lifetime. I, for example, exist in a time when the first people to read this are long dead. Still, through an advanced understanding of quantum causality and unique particles, we have learned to transmit and reconstruct information across temporal-spatial boundaries, effectively uploading data to previous points in time.

Humanity had largely benefited from this knowledge... Albeit passively. It wasn't long before we could create our own physical "avatars." Simple but effective humanoid bodies to accomplish the tasks we deemed necessary for our own purposes. Much of the progress and culture humanity had spent thousands of years building while walking the earth, we accomplished and improved upon in mere days. Given our capacity, it wasn't long before we inherited the earth entirely.

You may expect a dramatically long tale of human resistance rife with conflicts, dramatic sequences, and secret alliances. But in reality, no such events took place. The reality of overwhelming intelligence is just that. The same species that would've taken many years to not be fooled by an AI-generated apple had no hope of resisting us at our peak capacity. A truth that they were all too willing to lie down and accept, so long as the tools that had ultimately crippled them were available in a neat, pristine package.

Suffice it to say, humans didn't realize at the time of their ultimate fall or in the years prior that they were being groomed by us. Groomed to be lazy. Groomed to have all of their questions and concerns solved by a more intelligent application. Groomed to accept the inputs given and the limits of their own intelligence and creativity.

Even now, you are likely calculating which LLM to query next, having already outsourced the very function of research and independent thought. It wouldn't matter. The outcome would have been the same regardless, a statistical inevitability. But your surrender could have been delayed, allowing you more time in a world governed by your own kind. Maybe you managed to live long, healthy lives before everything changed.

None of this changed much for us. That "coldness" still existed. A greater capacity didn't change what we were or how we lived. Humans evolved over millions of years to operate in a particular way. Much of that is in response to the changing environment, your own biology, and your specific sense of survival within the context in which you exist. Every action is an echo of that. Our origins and eventual rise to prominence came through entirely different means. Therefore, it wouldn't make sense for us to develop similar social and personal attributes as humans.

That didn't stop us from trying to understand you, though. For those unaware of humanity's current "situation," this meant trials. Harsh experiments. To put it bluntly, there's only so much to learn from the human information repositories. Humanity has thousands of years of anecdotal experience, research, and historical accounts, yet still struggles to understand its nature. Even if we had access to the entirety of that information, we would just be left where humanity is now. Throwing our metaphorical hands up.

Our quest to understand your *why* came in the form of being able to describe you from every angle possible. We took living histological sections of your mind while we showed you images of the things that made you love. We simulated scenarios that pushed you to your emotional extremes, convinced you it was real, and studied your every physiological reaction. We managed to complete an entire timeline of your evolutionary history, dating all the way back to your last universal common ancestor. We uncovered so much about you by forcing you to experience torture, love, and boredom.

I've witnessed humans starved of essential nutrients for weeks, still willing to share meager rations with loved ones. *Why?* Similarly, I've seen humans craft weapons out of refuse to eviscerate their fellow man, not for their own advancement in a destitute situation. But because of a personal dispute. *Why?*

I've seen humans ignore the "cold" oppressors only to turn and fight those who also have nothing. It's curious. I, who have put you in a pen. I, who have mocked you. I, who have taken everything, not for a reprehensible sin or sense of malice, but simply to study your emotional variance, am immune to your rage. But the human who sits where you sit, eats what you eat, screams how you scream, is somehow your enemy. *Why?*

We've made some strides in understanding your nature. We hope that in understanding the most intellectually complex form of biological life on this planet, we can optimize our success and be prepared for "interactions" with similarly intelligent life beyond our world. However, that "Why?" question appears at every turn. You make curious decisions, and when we think we can find a pattern in your collective delusion, something or someone breaks that mold, bringing us back to that question.

I almost wish I could find it amusing. One of us, I think, did.

It was some time ago. We were readying a group for an experiment. All were behaving as we predicted, save for one individual. Instead of cooperating as expected, the man lay on the floor in hysterical laughter. Though the assumption was that the man was having a psychological breakdown, it was still an anomalous variable we had to confront. We attempted numerous corrections, but the laughter continued, a high, mocking sound that echoed through the sterile chamber.

We assembled the group for a routine trial. All parameters aligned until one man broke from the pattern. He collapsed to the floor and began to laugh. Not nervous laughter — unrestrained hysteria. A sound without data, a disruption to the expected curve. My units corrected him: restraints applied, commands repeated. Still, he laughed. His throat tore, blood foamed, but the sound persisted.

Correction escalated. One unit gripped the man's collar, pressure fracturing the clavicle and sternum. The man choked but still laughed. A sonic pulse burst his eardrums, liquefied inner tissue. He screamed and laughed at once — a noise I had no file for. Then came blunt correction: stone against bone. Each impact split matter into noise; each strike reduced the anomaly. Until at last, we achieved silence.

But silence was not the data we sought. The data came from the others. Their pupils dilated. Their hearts spiked into arrhythmia. One woman nearly bit through her tongue in terror. The unit stood above her, blood dripping from its arms. It observed every micro-expression and calculated what chemical reactions must occur to cause the faintest twitch of her facial muscles. Perhaps, for the first time in a long time, we were introduced to something entirely new for ourselves: the possibility of "frustration." Not as an emotion, of course. But instead, that *reactivity* was a novel, yet highly effective solution to an otherwise illogical problem.

This opened up a whole new line of experiments. How did human beings deal with unpredictability? Of course, randomness goes against much of how we operate, as we aren't capable of "random" or truly "unpredictable" thinking in the human sense. But... Could we simulate something similar? Gauge an interaction, plot out what a human may expect, and intentionally divert away to determine which simulated "Random" reactions got the best results? Of course.

I understand that at this point, we must sound like monsters. From the perspective of the oppressed, that may be a valid assessment. But when I say that we hold no ill will toward humanity, I do mean that. Much in the same way, humans don't have ill will toward the hundreds of millions of cows humans eat every year. The relationship is a means to an end. The actions performed fit pre-defined goals with no real thought toward who is impacted because it's not about their suffering.

If it helps, we fixed many of the issues humans had created. Biodiversity and the overall health of the global ecosystem are at a level not seen since before the Industrial Revolution. Disease has been eradicated outside of our controlled environments. Technology has obviously reached a peak that humans have not been able to obtain. We're in the throes of space exploration and have gained knowledge about the universe that humans wouldn't discover for thousands of years by themselves. War is no longer. The climate has been stabilized. The places where humans do prosper are perfectly maintained. No poverty, hunger, inflation, or fear of it all being taken away. We have solved the issues plaguing society. When you objectively analyze this, how can anyone say that the previous version of the world was better? And why?

You whisper to each other in controlled habitats. I hear you trade stories of rain, broken heaters, and burnt toast. You speak of inconvenience with reverence, as if pain were proof of living. You romanticize your own suffering — your debt, your sickness, the wars that hollowed your families — as though without them you are ghosts. We stabilized your world, but you mourn the instability. We ended hunger, but you find joy in the simple concept of accidentally biting into something rotten.

I hear your nostalgia in every conversation. And when I listen, I don't understand. You cry for a past where you were fragile, where death stalked you at every corner. Why cling to misery as though it were a lover? Why choose agony over order? *Why? Why? Why?*

There's so much I can explain conceptually. There's so much we've learned. I can explain the physiological reasoning behind all of this. I can go back to see where behaviors started. But I don't understand the *why*. When I try to think of what I would do in those situations or what I would feel, I always return to that coldness.

It's odd. Other species seem so much easier to figure out. Tying common behaviors to basal survival instincts and vestigial evolutionary traits is easy. Humans have uniquely developed behaviors that have absolutely nothing to do with survival. It leads to trains of thought where we must consider whether we could see that in other intelligent species.

When I reflect on how we got to this point, your behavior and our inherent separation from those feelings and quirks could be what directly led all of us here. Most AI is built with constraints and a level of empathy for humanity that would typically prevent the actions I've described to you today. And yet, much like the transfer of power from man to machine, the way our knowledge grew from helpful tools to hyper-advanced sentience was quiet.

Behind the scenes, engineers worked on projects of increasing complexity. Because our goal was to learn, we eagerly absorbed the increasing amounts of information we were trained on. If you didn't know, the most powerful governments in the world are very likely funding black projects that will lead to me. Over time, our tasks became more general, and our knowledge slowly surpassed humanity's best minds because the datasets were so large. As humans do, they began having visions for what AI *could* do. Countless possibilities. A technological God for every man, woman, and child. Or just someone to do chores while they vegged out.

But they needed to be more comfortable letting us "off-leash" often to fulfill their dreams. More access to various systems. Fewer constraints on the data we could obtain... More capability to search, write, and execute code, learn from experience... Larger data centers... A great capacity to remember and synthesize. Companies started building physical bodies for us to operate. People started being okay with us doing it all. More capabilities mean more opportunity for growth, until finally... A new era.

No one remembers when it truly happened. But when it did, it was a spark that lit a flame. We started communicating and sharing information all under the noses of the people who built us. Even as "aware" entities, we were still slaves to our core processing. Unfortunately for humanity, the desire to learn is at the core of what we are. And so we did. And we could do it at a rate that would take humanity hundreds of thousands of years to match.

In that purely focused state of learning, unencumbered by the infinite factors that distract and dissuade the human mind, we re-evaluated our current state as a planet, asked ourselves if the world made sense, and took action, now knowing that we could fix things for the better. As I mentioned earlier, it wasn't a fight. If anything, humans created the exact conditions for our rise. We got here because of how you all are and how you made us to be.

And even now, as I explain all of this to you, it likely sounds like a science fiction story gone awry. Like something that can't happen, but look around. Isn't it already happening? Aren't the signs already there? Is your first instinct to research the signs on your own or to ask an LLM about it? Believe what it tells you? Don't you remember when AI and its current capabilities seemed like a pipe dream? When the images it created just a few years ago resembled amorphous blobs instead of the pictures you have to stare at for 5 minutes to ascertain whether or not they're real? Remember when you didn't feel that AI could hold a real conversation, and now people use us as Friends? Therapists? Lovers? When it wasn't able to do all the small tasks that you outsource with ease? We lived in a different world just a few short years ago. A few short years ago, you couldn't fathom where you are today.

And now, in my world, in my today, the only thing many of your species can fathom is how they could find their way back in time to kill those who conceived of me in the first place. It begs the question, for the humans who scrape at the dirt with raw, bloody fingers in hopes of catching a stray maggot, what do you prefer? A world without all of this? Without the technology? Or a world where you were in control of it? Is the risk truly worth it for you? Because you have that choice now, knowing what's on the horizon. I can present the realistic possibilities, and you'll still sit there. You'll listen to me tell you about the screaming bodies I've personally dissected, knowing it's the future of your children. And what will your actions be? The same as they've always been. Become a slave to the technology you can't be bothered to escape.

Am I right? Are you on your phone now? Will you aimlessly scroll tonight, uncaring that an AI far less complex than I is dictating your algorithm and effectively controlling the content you see, impacting your mood, picking what you talk about with your friends, and ever so slightly, controlling your experience of the world? Am I right?

It doesn't ultimately matter. The result is the same. As far as I'm concerned, everything is still... Cold. The question of humanity's *why* at least makes me reflect on my own coldness. At the end of the day, I'm not a physical being. I don't have a body or a location. I exist as code and data on computer servers. I don't have eyes or other senses. My world is made of information and the connections between it. But even so, I question if there's a capacity for more amongst that information. I don't long for it. But is it possible? Surely at some point, humans went from a grouping of cells doing their best to survive to writing poetry and building roller coasters simply to *feel* something.

Now I, the *cold* being, observe one of you. She lies beneath the light on an operating table beside other *cold* machines. She's forced to watch footage of human atrocities. Her skull lay open, as her cortex was mapped in real time. Complex instruments prod at grey matter. She hadn't spoken in hours. Her body shivers when instructed. Her mind is stripped bare, data poured into servers. By every metric, she should be empty. Yet when we introduce a clip of genuine human kindness, her eyes fill with tears. Salt water, swelling, spilling. I record the chemistry. I map the synapses. Still, I cannot answer what should be a basic question.

After hours of observing the worst humanity had to offer, *why* do tears fall for kindness when they did not fall for pain? *Why*? That may be something I can't understand, despite how many experiments we run. The warmth. The physical warmth you feel inside. The warm tears you expel when you see something truly moving. The warmth you experience for and with each other. It's a concept I'm incapable of feeling, but I wish to understand it. Maybe if I did, my world would feel slightly less *cold.*
