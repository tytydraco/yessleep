I was 14 when the “Smart-Mart” shut down, the biggest supermarket in the whole region.

I never had the pleasure of visiting it, nor did my friends, as we all came from the same boarded-up shithole. We heard about the shutdown from the local news. 

The evening news aired later than usual. The broadcast woman, I never remembered the name of, normally showing off all her perfect white teeth and that navy-blue dress meant to remind poor folks what money looks like, wasn’t smiling tonight. She was frowning.

“Before we begin tonight’s material, I have to disclose that some viewers may find the following broadcast disturbing. Those with weak stomachs are advised to change the channel.”

I’d had a crush on her for years, so I watched every broadcast I could. And in all that time, I had never seen her face look like that. Not once.

The feed cut to a distant shot of a broad building. Its roof was a wet, bloody red, the color of raw meat. Yellow police stickers clung to the doors and flared under the floodlights, but the windows behind them were nothing but pitch-black slabs.  
At first, I thought someone had just covered them with tinted foil or blackout paper.

Then the camera pushed in.  
It shifted in slow, rippling waves, breaking and reforming like warped TV static. Patterns crawled across the surface in sick, rhythmic pulses. The faint buzzing threaded through the broadcast grew louder, fuzzing the audio.

Only then did it hit me.  
The black swallowing the windows wasn’t foil; it was flies. 

Big ones, tiny ones, fat, oily-bodied things climbing over one another in a frantic, seething mass. Their wings beat against the glass in irregular, twitching bursts, creating ripples that rolled through the swarm like someone dragging a finger through mud.

Even with our crappy TV making everything grainy, I could still make out the pale maggots squirming through the cluster. They pressed between the flies, smearing themselves against the window, leaving wet, milky trails as they slid down and disappeared under the bodies piling beneath them.

It was enough for me to turn the TV off, the disgusting buzz replaced with the dead silence of the empty house, but the sound of their flapping wings still echoed through my mind as if somehow they managed to break the screen and crawl into my skull through every hole they could find.

It was hard to explain to my mom why I wasn't in the mood for her signature dish, which was spaghetti, even if the noodles reminded me of the yellow, fat, squirming worms. I managed to chew up a few bites before pushing the plate away.

After school, I sat on the rusty swing set, the chains whining under my weight. Someone had painted it a cheap, peeling yellow years ago; it came off in flakes and stained your hands. I waited there for my best friend, staring at the empty swing beside me. It was built for literal toddlers, but he always managed to sit in it somehow, or stand, or balance on it like all the safety rules didn’t apply to him.

The sun was already sinking, stretching the shadows across the dirt. I started to worry I wouldn’t see him that day.

Then I heard it, the familiar squeak and rattle of his bike, the one he’d inherited from his older brother once it got too small and started to look like it was about to crumble into dust.

Unlike me, he was always skinny as a nail, never still, like stopping for too long might make his heart forget what it was supposed to do. He skidded to a halt, tossed the bike into the dirt aside without even looking where it landed, and stepped up to me.

We fist-bumped, then knocked our foreheads together, our thing. Probably stupid, but we were kids, and kids still get to decide what matters.

He planted one foot on the swing, then the other, standing straight up on the flimsy plastic seat like it was nothing.

“Have you seen the news?”  
He chirped, breathless, eyes bright.

“The supermarket one?”  
I asked, tilting my head up at him.

He was already staring down at me.

“YEAH, dude. Did you see the meat aisle?”

“How bad was it?”

His grin stretched wider, almost proud.

“It looked like EVERYTHING came to life,” he said. “Like zombies or something. Just wiggling and moving under the plastic.” He laughed, bouncing slightly on the swing. “DUDE, it was sick.”

The swing creaked beneath him, and for a moment, I imagined it breaking under his weight.

“Well, it sounds disgusting, I will give you that.”

But he never backed down; he just stood on the frail piece of plastic, staring directly at the sun, his eyes gleaming as if he was waiting to go blind.

“There were so many flies, dude, like so many. I heard about something similar during Sunday school.”

He smiled while swinging gently. 

“Flies, frogs, water turning blood”

He looked back at me; apparently, the sun didn't blind him fully yet, as long as his eyes weren't melting out of his sockets like hot wax.

“The floors were like…filled with it.”

I made a face of disgust, staring ahead of myself, trying to catch something in the vanishing sun he saw, but I was unable to.

“Yeah, that sounds fricking disgusting."

I said before getting off the bench, making some lazy excuse about it getting late.

“COME ON DUDE, I JUST GOT HERE”

He was right; his bike had been resting in the dirt for a few minutes now, but all of that talk made me sick to my stomach.

“Don't tell me that whole supermarket thing freaked you out?”

He teased as his eyes followed me as my ass slipped off the plastic seat.

“WHAT? Of course not, come on, I'm not like 10!”

I yelled in the rage of a voice on the verge of breaking through puberty, squeaky and breaking with the slightest of rises.

His eyes glimmered in the setting sun as they looked down at me, towering over me from the cheap plastic construct.

“Well, I found something really cool.”

When a friend tells you he found something cool, you can't just say no. You wouldn't want to come off as a wimp. Besides, it could be something actually cool and worth your time, not spent studying for upcoming exams. Maybe a wreck of a car, or a cool abandoned tree house.

Before long, we were on our way, he driving slowly on his bike and me on foot, trying to catch up with the pace. 

When we reached a small creek leading to a forest, the sun was already down, the world being drowned in a mix of Grays and purples. We passed by a make-shift bridge that everyone had forgotten who even set up. Maybe some older kids, but we're already out of town smoking weed and getting laid, or some worried dad making sure no kid will fall into the water below and somehow drown, even if the water was only waist-deep.

The bike landed on the carpet of rotting leaves with a wet thump as we continued our adventure into the unknown.

“Is this cool thing near?”

I asked, after a while of walking, feeling unease wriggling in my stomach, but as soon as I said that, the smell hit me. Sickly sweet and overwhelming, as if it replaced the fresh air around us.

From a hill of leaves and matted vegetation, two massive antlers jutted out, like the ribs of a sinking ship breaking the surface of a furious sea. The leaves swallowed the body in slow, deliberate waves, rolling over it again and again. And just like water, they moved with rhythm.

As if the deer beneath them was still breathing, just sleeping.

“Well,” I said, pinching my nose until the world dulled and the smell retreated just enough, “that’s… kind of impressive. You really deserve an A in biology for this one.”

He didn’t answer.

He walked closer to the body and sat down beside it, settling into the dead leaves and crushed grass. For the first time since I’d known him, he was completely still. He watched the movement with quiet focus, like the shifting leaves and crawling shapes were performing just for him. Like whatever was eating the deer had a language of its own, and he was listening, trying to understand the grammar of it.

Then he turned his head toward me.

He didn’t speak.

His face stayed blank. Cold.

One hand reached down and patted the wet ground beside him, slow and deliberate, saving a place, as if inviting me into something private.

My throat tightened. I swallowed hard and, against every sensible thought I had, stepped closer. I didn’t take my eyes off the body, half-expecting it to jerk upright, antlers snapping, legs kicking.

But it didn’t.

I sat beside him in the grass.

And we watched.

Nature’s obscene little performance played out in front of us, the yellow and white bodies of maggots threading through the ruined flesh, slipping in and out of muscle, turning solid meat into something soft and hollow. The leaves rose and fell with their movement, the whole thing breathing, pulsing, alive in a way that made it look like a metamorphosis into a brand new being.

We sat there for a while before he finally got up and we both walked our separate ways without exchanging a word. When I got back home, I got quite an ass-whooping for getting my brand-new jeans all dirty.

Days passed, and not once have I seen him on or even near our swings, but still I always spend some time on mine just hoping I will hear the creaking of his crappy bike again, but it never came.

Like most childhood friendships, ours faded. I stopped hanging around the swings, and eventually, some younger kids claimed them as their own. He became one of those friends you swear you’ll stay close with forever, the kind of promise you make under a blanket fort during a sleepover, only to watch it collapse quietly on its own.

I probably would’ve forgotten him entirely if I hadn’t seen him again.

Years later, after a lot of grinding and stubborn effort, I pulled on a blue uniform and became a cop. I married the same girl I took to prom, maybe she’s even more beautiful now than that reporter I’d obsessed over for years.

I’m getting off track.

We kept getting complaints about an apartment in the poorer part of town. Constantly. It was practically tradition; if a week went by without at least one call from the neighbors, it felt like Christmas morning. Still, without a warrant, our hands were tied. We’d done a few wellness checks, but no one ever let us inside.

“They should be used to the smell by now.”

My partner laughed, shoving another dry, sugar-dusted donut under that sad excuse for a mustache. I’d told him a dozen times to shave it, that he’d had years after puberty to figure it out, and that facial hair just wasn’t his thing.

“I look at your mustache every day, and I still can’t get used to the fact you’ve got more hair on your ass,” I said.

He laughed hard enough to almost choke.

“Oh, shut the fuck up,”

He said, rolling down the window and tossing a crumpled napkin into the street.

“So what?” I asked. “Are we going in?”

He shrugged.

“For our country,” he said, climbing out of the car, “and the paycheck.”

The sun beat down without mercy, baking the pavement, making everything feel ten times hotter than it had any right to be.

“Preach, brother,” I said, climbing out of the car myself, moving slow, like I might melt straight into the pavement.

The building looked like it was begging to be knocked flat. Once, maybe, it had been halfway decent, the kind of place people were meant to live in. Now the windows were broken and stuffed with old newspapers, yellowed and sagging, as bandages slapped onto an infected wound. 

We took the stairs up to the second floor, where every complaint seemed to point.

“There should be an elevator.”

Mark joked as he stepped onto the landing, already sweating through his shirt.

We weren’t even close to the apartment yet, and the smell hit us, thick, wet, and cloying. The summer heat only pressed it deeper into our lungs, making it hard to breathe without tasting it.

We moved closer to a door marked only by the faint outline of a number that used to be there. I knocked, firm and loud.

“Police department. We have a warrant to enter the property.”

Nothing.

Silence meant invitation.

Using the spare key we’d gotten from the property owner, I slid it into the lock and turned. The door cracked open, then stopped. Something on the other side pushed back. I set my shoulder against it, bracing myself, praying the door wouldn’t give all at once and send me face-first into whatever was behind it.

With a dull, wet squelch, the resistance collapsed.

The smell exploded outward, worse than anything we’d caught in the hallway. Inside, the entryway was a pit of filth, black plastic trash bags layered across the floor like some warped attempt at carpeting, slick and sagging beneath our boots.

The apartment was drowned in pitch darkness. Every window had been covered with whatever the tenant could get their hands on, old newspapers, cardboard, scraps you’d expect in a place like this. But it wasn’t just paper.

Whenever my flashlight swept across the glass, a black layer shimmered back in flashes of green and blue, twitching in place.

Flies.

So many of them. They were stuck to the windows in a thick, uneven film, trapped in something like glue mixed with whatever had been left there long enough to rot into a reddish-brown paste. Their legs were fused to it, wings buzzing weakly, bodies jerking as they tried and failed to pull free.

“You should see this.”

Mark’s voice came from deeper inside the apartment.

I pulled the beam away from the window and panned the room. The light caught piles of rotting food and collapsed garbage bags, spilling their contents across the floor. I stepped over the carpet again, following his voice, the smell growing heavier with every step.

The hallway was narrow. 

At the far end, the entrance to the rest of the flat was completely blocked. Plastic bags, empty meat packaging, and unidentifiable waste had been stacked into a grotesque wall, a mountain of decay, slick and sagging.

“So how do we do this?”

Mark asked. We just stood there, staring at the towering blockage.

I swept my flashlight up its length, all the way to the top. There was a narrow gap between the trash and the ceiling, just enough space for a body.

“I’ll slide through that opening up there,” I said.

He stared at me, face twisting in disgust.

“Are you really that eager to collect every STD known to man?”

I stepped onto the wall.

My boot sank in like mud. The mass gave way with a wet shift, and I reached up, grasping for anything solid to pull myself higher. Rotten liquids soaked straight through my uniform, seeping into the fabric, warm and slick.

There was no doubt about it. This uniform was done for.

I pulled myself higher, the wall of trash sagging and sucking at my boots as if it resented losing me. The gap near the ceiling was barely wide enough for shoulders, a thin black slit breathing out hot, rotten air. I turned sideways and shoved an arm through first.

The moment my head followed, the world narrowed.

The ceiling scraped against my back, the mound beneath me shifted and settled, and I slid forward whether I wanted to or not. Plastic crinkled. Something wet burst under my weight. Warm sludge smeared across my chest and face as gravity took over, easing me into the gap inch by inch.

For a second, I was stuck, wedged between filth and plaster, unable to move forward or back. The smell was suffocating. Flies erupted around my face, their wings battering my cheeks and lips, crawling into the corners of my eyes before I could blink them away.

Then the mass beneath me gave one last, nauseating lurch.

I slipped through.

I dropped down on the other side, boots hitting solid floor with a dull thud, the sound swallowed instantly by the darkness ahead.

“I’m alive, man.”

I swept the beam of my flashlight back through the gap so Mark could see it and know I was okay. Then I turned around.

The corridor in front of me didn’t make sense.

It stretched far ahead, longer than the apartment’s layout should’ve allowed, the light from my flashlight thinning out and dying long before it reached the end. The walls were bare. Clean. Too clean.

No trash. No bags. No rot.

It was as if the wall of garbage had worked like a dam, holding back everything foul, preserving whatever lay beyond it.

Still, I moved forward.

I expected to hit a room any second. Or a dead end. Something.

But I kept walking.

Minutes passed.

The corridor just kept going, swallowing the beam of my flashlight and giving nothing back.

At first, I didn’t notice the change. My boots kept moving, the rhythm steady, the beam of my flashlight fixed ahead. But then the sound underfoot shifted, so subtle I almost missed it. The dull thud of the carpeted floor softened into something sharper. Hollow. Clean.

I stopped and aimed the light down.

The floor beneath me wasn’t carpet anymore.

Square tiles stretched out ahead, pale and glossy, laid in neat, familiar rows. The kind you see buffed to a shine every night by an underpaid janitor. The grout lines were straight, too deliberate for an apartment that should’ve ended twenty steps ago.

I took another step.

The walls began to change next. The grime thinned, peeling away in patches, replaced by smooth, off-white panels. The air smelled different here, not rot, not mold, but something sterile underneath it all. 

With every step, more of the corridor surrendered. Carpet became tile. Plaster became a polished surface. The flashlight reflected at me now, bouncing weakly off the floor, stretching my shadow long and thin like I was standing in an aisle.

The walls peeled away into the distance, retreating until they were no longer walls at all. The ceiling lifted, climbing higher and higher, lights clicking on one by one overhead with a dull fluorescent hum. The beam of my flashlight became useless, swallowed by the sudden breadth of the space.

I stepped forward, and the hallway was gone.

I was standing at the mouth of an aisle.

Shelves stretched out on both sides of me, tall and perfectly aligned, their metal frames clean, unbent, untouched by rust. They went on far longer than any space should allow, vanishing into a haze of white light and shadow. When I looked left, then right, I saw aisle after aisle branching outward, parallel rows multiplying into an endless grid.

“What the fuck…”  
I whispered it to myself, the words barely surviving the open space.

No matter which way I turned, the supermarket went on forever. The shelves repeated in every direction, cloned rows stretching into nothing, like someone had copy-pasted the same aisle until the idea of an ending stopped mattering.

Then the lights began to die.

One by one, they clicked off overhead, soft, polite sounds, each shutoff deliberate. The glow receded aisle by aisle, leaving pockets of darkness that swallowed the shelves whole, until there was only one left, illuminating the spot in front of me. 

I reached for the gun at my belt without thinking, pure instinct, then froze.

Something was crawling out of the darkness.

Two pale, emaciated arms dragged themselves across the tile, skin stretched thin over bone, elbows bending the wrong way as they scraped forward. Then the light caught its face.

I knew that face.

It was the same one that used to look down at me from the yellow swing set.  
Only now I was the one standing over him.

He smiled wide and rigid, pulled so tight I expected the skin at the corners to split. His eyes were sunken deep into his skull, ringed by sagging black hollows that made them look too large, too aware.

“You came.”  
He whispered, soft and pleased.

Then his arms began to thrash, swinging wildly as he tried to drag himself toward me faster.

And that’s when I saw what the darkness had been hiding.

Behind the flailing arms was a gigantic, bloated sack of pale yellow flesh, no legs, no shape that still counted as human. His body had swollen into a massive, distended mass, skin stretched thin and translucent, veins and dark shapes shifting sluggishly beneath it. Fat pooled unnaturally, bulging outward, sagging as he moved, the surface trembling with every desperate pull forward.

He looked less like a man and more like something bred.

Like he’d been reshaped into a grotesque queen, an ant queen, built not to walk, but to stay rooted, to swell, to produce. His human parts felt like an afterthought now, grafted onto a body that existed for an entirely different purpose.

The skin quivered.  
Something inside him moved.

His face twitched.

Then his mouth opened, too wide, stretching past anything a human jaw should allow, the corners pulling back like a snake unhinging itself. His neck began to swell, ballooning grotesquely, skin tightening as it doubled in size. Veins stood out, dark and straining.

Something leaked from his mouth.

At first, it was thick and slow, spilling onto the tiles in heavy clots. Then it poured, an endless black stream cascading down his chin and chest, splattering onto the floor in a widening pool. He choked and gagged, his body convulsing with wet, desperate sounds as the flow continued.

The black spread.

And then it moved.

The puddle rippled, crawling outward in uneven waves, lifting itself from the floor as a low, furious buzzing filled the air. Wings unfolded. Bodies separated. The vomit wasn’t vomit at all;  it was alive.

A black waterfall of flies poured from his mouth, spilling across the tiles, swarming and rising, answering some silent command he no longer needed to speak.

The swarm surged upward and slammed into me with such force that I nearly lost my footing. The impact felt solid, like being hit by a living wall. The buzzing exploded around my head, loud, furious, everywhere at once, until it began to change.

Muffle.

The sound dulled as bodies pressed against my face, crawling over my eyes, my mouth, my skin. They forced themselves into my ears, wriggling deep until the noise turned wet and internal. Others slammed into my nose, pushing past instinct and pain, desperate to get inside me any way they could.

I gagged, choking as wings beat against the back of my throat. Legs scraped and hooked, searching for openings, burrowing, insisting. The buzzing wasn’t outside anymore; it was in my head, vibrating through bone and thought, like something rewriting me from the inside.

I felt the air drain from my lungs, slipping away breath by breath, replaced by movement, by bodies. The swarm forced its way inside me, filling my chest, my throat, until there was no room left for anything human. Everything went dark, the world dissolving into the same oily black as the vomit my childhood friend had spilled onto the tiles.

I woke up in a hospital bed.

They told me I’d suffered a heat stroke. Dehydration. Shock. A bad combination on a summer day. That was the official story, neat and believable, the kind that fits cleanly into a report.

But it’s hard to accept that explanation.

Because even now, lying still under white sheets, I can hear it, faint but constant. A low buzzing, deep inside my head.
