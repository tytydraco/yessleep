Have you ever heard of the No-No man? If you have, it’s already too late for you. 

There's no easy way to put this, but I am a 36 year old morbidly obese white man. Have you seen Darren Aronofsky's *The Whale*? Well I’m twice that man’s weight in prosthetics. The only difference is that while Brendan Fraiser gets to shed his prosthetic prison off after wrap, my oceanic rolls are as vast as they are inescapable. As you can imagine, it was a bit of a problem.

I never wanted to be so fat. I was always a real butter ball growing up. My mom even used to call me “The Great English Ham”. Being a tubster is cute when you’re a kid but it got out of control fast. The phenomenon of life-long eating disorders stemming from parental abuse is well documented, and unfortunately I was no outlier. 

You see my father would kick the ever loving shit out of me and my mom daily. And while my mom found her peace in ketamine, I found mine in the cookie jar. 

Fast forward to three months ago. I’m doing my thing; I sell subprime mortgages to illegal immigrants who make lambo money off construction gigs. It’s not a job Christ would do, but it pays the bills better than washing hooker feet or whatever. 

It started off like any other day at the office. I reached down between my legs to fish out a GoodHumor Strawberry Short Cake Bar from the mini fridge wedged under my desk, only to be met with violent resistance. 

WHAP! A sharp and assertive slap intercepted my searching hand from its creamy treasure. 

I let out a frustrated “What the fuck?” catching wayward glances from Stephen, our resident Microsoft Excel specialist.

But when I looked up to see who had so rudely got in the way of me and my GoodHumor Strawberry Short Cake Bar, I found myself face to face with something totally inhuman. Not to say he wasn’t human-like: his rib bones jutted from under his latex-tight jaundiced skin, the stomach vacuum sealed inward revealing the corrugated outline of a large intestine, and the shoulders were hunched so he looked like a very tall S. He was so naked I screamed. 

I looked up at his face, having half a mind to give him a piece of my mind, when I saw his awful, inhuman face. It was human-like because it had eyes, a nose, and a mouth but they were all totally inhuman. The eyes were blackened by the shadow of his big furrowing brow, his massive cheeks forcing his eyes into beautiful half moons. The nose was so long that I hesitated to look straight at it for fear of my eyes getting stuck cross-eyes. And the mouth, oh that horrible puffy mouth, puckered into a great big frown that stretched past his chin and jutted from the face about, oh let’s say three inches.

Then, in a booming voice louder than anything I’d ever heard in my whole fucking life, he said, “NO! NO! NO! NO!” 

An emaciated finger wagged pendulously from his stone knuckles. I couldn't believe it, no, I refused to believe this was happening to me. I quickly rubbed my little eyes as if to say “please let this all be a bad dream.” But it wasn't. This was dead real. 

I looked over at Stephen with eyes full of desperation and hopeless confusion. “Are you seeing this, man?” I whimpered.    

“What?” He replied normally. 

“You don’t see this?” I said, his dumbness almost driving me to madness. 

I reached down again for my pink juicy GoodHumor Strawberry Short Cake Bar and the man slapped me even harder than he had before. “Ah, fuck. That fucking sucks.” I screamed as my knuckles began to bleed.

 A deafening “NO! NO! NO! NO!” shaking the very foundation my reality is built upon. 

“What?” Stupid Stephen murmured hesitantly.  

“Try it! Grab the GoodHumor Strawberry Short Cake Bar! You’ll see!” I barked like a rabid dog. 

“For real? You never let me touch your snacks. You always bark at me when I ask you for one of your GoodHumor Strawberry Short Cake Bars.” Stupid Stephen shat out of his bitch mouth. 

“DO IT!!!!!!” I howled, my bottom lip jutted out and I bounced up and down on my tiny office swivel chair, flapping my arms like a temperamental bird. “NOW! NOW! NOW! QUICKLY!”

So, Stephen came over to my desk with a quizzical look. He opened the fridge and grabbed a GoodHumor Strawberry Short Cake Bar. 

“Now give it to me Stephen. Give it to me and I’ll give you a raise and maybe Microsoft Word as well.” I quibbled. 

“Oh, cool. Sure.” He said.

But before Stephen could hand me the sweet treat my heart oh so desired, the big S-shaped man took his evil hands and tore Stephen limb from limb! His shoulder came out with a stomach-spinning POP. He cracked Stephen’s leg bones and the man slurped up the gore like a well-seasoned Baltimorean working his way around some crab legs. The man tore through Stephen’s flesh as easily as my child-hands used to tear through microwaved frosting. He would scoop heaping piles of flesh and viscera into his elongated throat, stuffing it far beyond its flesh storage capacity, and then turn to me, chewing wide and slow, making sure I could see every gruesome detail of what was once a perfectly productive coworker slide pathetically down his neck chute.   

Stephen screamed and screamed, but I covered my ears because the screaming sound hurt. When I uncovered them, what was left of Stephen was soaked into the brand new carpet I had installed not even two weeks ago. I fell to my knees and cried. 

That’s when I learned that when the No-No Man says “No”, you listen. 

It’s been three months now. I lay fetal, my emaciated body forming a bumpy O on the novelty faux tiger skin rug sprawled out on the floor of my cigar lounge. My tongue hangs out, licking at the floor, every lick eliciting a swift slap on the taste buds, like a S shaped cat pawing at a tiny helpless bug. “No, no, no,” he coos.     

He won’t let me eat, not even a lick of dust. And while I look better than I ever have, sort of like Christian Bale in *The Machinist*, I’m dying really hard. My hunger is consuming me the way I wish I could consume some food right now. 

I’m using the last of my strength to type this out. I needed to warn the other morbidly obese white men of this world of a fate worse than death. Well, I am dying, but I’m sure my death is hurting more than most other people’s deaths. 

So long and farewell. And remember, if the No-No Man comes… Well, let’s just hope he doesn't.
