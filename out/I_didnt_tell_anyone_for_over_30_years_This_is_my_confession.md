My great grandparents helped settle this land because they believed it was God’s country. It was their own personal Eden, gifted to them based on their faithfulness after wandering west. And standing there, sun set between the mountains of the Salt Lake Valley, all of it was almost believable–maybe we were destined to steward this land. Maybe this was heaven on earth. Maybe everything they said, from the to the assertion of our fated presence here, was all true.

But to my younger brother Thomas and I, the hundreds of unspoiled square miles was just our backyard. And for the daylight hours during summer, it was all ours–the trees and the ponds and the caves the backdrop of every imaginary game that we would play. We knew the time it took to get from one landmark to another, the hazards we could skip across and the ones to avoid, and how much time it would take us to get back home from any particular point. 

It was a summer’s day like any other, except there was a buzz between Thomas and I. It was his birthday, and there’s nothing in the world like turning six. I was nine at the time, playing the dutiful role of the older brother. I led us hopping from root to root in the trees behind our house, setting off on our day’s adventure.

“I’ll go this way, because I’m the older brother.” I pointed at the easier path and Thomas nodded. I almost felt guilty as to how agreeable he was. Almost.  “And you got to go that way, but as a monkey.” He hunched over, dangling his arms, mouth agape like it was about to hoot. He blew out little puffs of air from his pursed lips instead.

Thomas had been born soundlessly, slipping into the world in a silence he never lost. His vocal cords were malformed in the womb, a condition the doctor had said may not be permanent. 

“It won’t be, doctor,” my father had said. “God don’t make mistakes.” This was his ever-repeated mantra, a catchphrase he used for everything in life.

But even my father’s faith had been slipping. I found a pamphlet on his desk for a school teaching sign language, which had been out of the question before this. I had straightened it back on his desk like I never saw it.

“We’ll see who can get out to the well the fastest. And since you’re the birthday boy…” He presented his face with his hands beneath his chin, ta-da! “I’ll give you a headstart. Starting now!” I rushed out the last two words, and Thomas leapt at them, sprinting ahead of me. I remember that it was the hardest I had had to work to beat him. 

The well itself was old and narrow,  barely wide enough for the many gallon bucket that had to be hand cranked to the well’s bottom below. It had dilapidated enough that you could hardly see it from the path. That made it secret and so we made it ours. It was home base in tag, a fort when we played soldiers, and (Thomas’ favorite), a ship when we were pirates.

And it was where we dropped our wishes.

The crank was rusted, as the well itself hadn’t been used in decades. It took both of us pulling with all our might to lower it. “Okay, so get your wish ready. I got mine. I wish for infinite wishies.” I held my hand over the crumbling ledge and dropped my quarter. I heard the clang of it against the metal of the bucket. “Mine’s coming true! Your turn.”

Thomas leaned his little body over the ledge, shut one eye, tried to aim the quarter just right. But then it was like he froze up, his body locked tight like it did when my dad came into the room. He overcorrected and let the coin go. We heard nothing for a while, and then the splash of the quarter hitting the water. That was a bad omen. Not only will your wish not come true, but you also are out a quarter. I could see tears growing in Thomas’s eyes. 

“Hey, it’s okay, it’s just a dumb game! It doesn’t actually mean anything!” He reached his hand out,  fingers pinching the air.

“Oh you’re sad about the quarter! You can have my quarter. I can always just wish for another one now.”

He nodded his head, blinking away tears. There was a sort of wish logic to it. He had forgotten that he had been crying before we even got back home. 

Mom would always let you pick the meal on your birthday. And every year, Thomas requested the same thing: grilled cheese and tomato soup. He had a stepstool he would use to help my mom butter the bread. My mom and him had their own language too, and I sat at the table next to dad, listening to the rare sound of my mom laughing in the kitchen.

“I have a real bang up headache,” he had told me the moment I entered the room. I sat down without speaking, knowing how volatile he could be with one of those. He was opening a new Costco bottle of Asprin. He went through them like water, but took them with none: instead, he would tuck them into his cheek and let them dissolve. He said they worked better that way. 

“You and Thomas have fun?” I nodded at him. “Good, good. Thanks for taking him out.”He was always saying things like this, like I was doing Thomas a favor. His fingers tapped at the table, his leg was shaky. My mom laughed again from the kitchen and he twitched. “What could she possibly be laughing at in there?” I shrugged. “Hey! Beth!” The kitchen became silent at the sound of her name. “I’ve got a real bang up headache in here, can you maybe keep it down?”

“Sorry, honey.”

Dad became more gregarious as dinner went on, as if it was just the food that he needed. But we all knew that wasn’t the case. Anything, from the temperature in the room, to the squeak of a chair, could set him off again, often at Thomas. Especially at Thomas.

But tonight was different. He told a funny story from work, thanked Mom and Thomas for cooking. By the time we were ready for cake, we had relaxed again, it was like his outburst had never happened. That’s how he always did it. Made you feel safe.

“Okay then! Almost time for candles, I think.” He looked toward my mom, and she was already clearing the table, knowing her cue. When she was in the kitchen, dad looked at Thomas, like really looked at him. He didn’t just let his eyes float above Thomas’s head like he usually did. “Now Thomas, I know it might not be traditional, but I wanted to give you one of your presents before the cake.” He reached under his chair and pulled out a box, set it in front of him. “Well, go ahead!”

Thomas’ eyes gleamed, more at Dad than the present. To have his approval, to have a special gift picked out just for you, meant you were special. The gift itself barely even mattered. But he ripped the paper off just the same. Inside was a tapedeck recorder and a stack of tapes. His eyes flashed up to my dad’s, confused.

“It’s a tape recorder! See, I got you these series of tapes here. It’s for speech impediments. That tape says something, then you record yourself repeating it, listen back to it. A guy from work, said his kid had a stutter and it worked wonders for him.” My brother’s face dropped. He hung his head, fiddled with the buttons. 

“Well? Don’t you like it?” Thomas’s head snapped back up at my dad raising his voice. He nodded emphatically. “Because it wasn’t cheap. God don’t make mistakes, Thomas. I’m trying to help you.” Thomas nodded again, but I could tell dad wasn’t buying it.

“He does, dad. Honest. You know I can tell.” I regretted saying it before I was even finished.

“Really? You can tell? How can you tell?”

“We just understand each other–”

“Well I don’t “just understand him”. And the rest of the world, they’re not going to “just understand him” either. I’m doing this for his own good.” By then, my mother was leaning in the archway, holding the cake, candles already lit. The flame caught dad’s eye. “Case and point!” He stood up, took the cake from my mom. “I have never heard you sing me happy birthday. Not once. So tonight, you don’t get to hear it from us.”

“Honey…” My mom’s voice, barely above a whisper.

“Better yet, we’ll all sing it like Thomas does. Ready? One, two, three!” My dad started mouthing the lyrics to the song, blowing air in a caricature of my brother. He made us all do the whole song like that. “Make a wish.” He instructed Thomas when we had finished.

Thomas blew out the candles, and for the second time that day, I watched him cry in silence.

He had gotten other presents that night, a battery powered train and some art supplies, but they lay untouched on his bedside table.  As soon as we were put to bed that night, he turned his face against the wall. I used five of my wishes to make myself sleep that night.

That night. something stronger than the sun had seized me awake. It was still dark, but I knew it before I even opened my eyes. I knew it before I turned his covers, before I checked the bathroom, before I rocked my mom awake. Somehow, I knew.

“Thomas is gone.”

There was a flurry of police and search parties going through the next day. They swept the area, and then swept it again, my father out with them, my mom and I at home. The police had found that Thomas’ camping backpack was gone, along with a few of his favorite things. Underneath my bed, he had left me a note on his new art paper: completely blank except for a big “x” drawn on it. They asked me what it meant, but I didn’t know. I blamed that on why I had to sit at home with my mom. She was perched on a stool and mostly stayed silent. Once or twice a cop tried to start a conversation with her over their endless cups of coffee, but they eventually gave up. 

My dad’s reaction may have surprised me the most. He was full of shock, real shock. I knew it was genuine. When I told him Thomas was missing, he did not know it yet, and he was confused. And I guess that surprised me because it was so obvious Thomas was running from him. My dad went out with the search party, and then out on his own, and then out with the search party again before he was finally returned. The sergeant in charge brought dad back at nearly 3 am. “Man’s been looking for over 20 hours. He needs to sleep.” 

“Thanks, Sarge. I’ll just be a couple hours.” The officer held his hand up.

“Rest. We can’t have you exhausted. We’re expanding the search area. We don’t know how long this is going to take.” He patted my dad on the arm, and he unwillingly agreed.

They put me in bed, no matter my objections that I wasn’t going to be able to sleep. But childlike sleep came anyway, fitful and dreamless. It was from this sleep I was tossed awake again. This time it wasn’t to a prediction, but to a vision. 

Thomas and I always understood each other, always knew how to communicate. And it was like he was communicating to me then. And I don’t mean through a dream or a metaphor. I mean face-to-face. I opened my eyes and a face was inches from mine. Thomas’ face. 

He hung upside down above me, eyes unfocused. His head was scratched and bloodied, his breath was labored. But it was him. He hung there, perfectly still except for the twitching of his fingers and lips. I couldn’t move either. Doctors have told me I was having sleep paralysis, but I know this was different. It was like I could feel the warmth from his wheezing lips. And he was in trouble.
I blinked, and he was gone. But it didn’t matter. I knew where he was. 

I shot out of my bed toward my bedroom door. I had to tell my parents. But just as I was about to turn the handle, something stopped me. I went back to my room, got dressed, grabbed a flashlight, and snuck out myself. 

Thomas had told me where he was going, did it in a way that only I would know. It was our pirate ship. X marks the spot. The light from the silver of the moon was more than enough to a path I knew so well. I followed my own feet to the well. 

At first, I thought it was a dead end. The spot was clear and quiet. I was scared to be out at night, but more so to be breaking rules, but I still let out a word, small and hesitant. 

“Thomas?”

Silence–and then, the sound of Thomas’ quarter, a soft plunk of water splashing up from the well. I raced over and shone my flashlight down it.

And there was Thomas. He had fallen backwards into the well, nodded off while waiting for me. His body was being held upside down by the narrow walls, one arm twisted behind him, the other with just the tips of his fingers free. He used them to push pebbles into the water below. He was still alive. 

“Thomas! I’m going to get you out of there. Just hold on, okay?” I turned, ready to run back, then stopped. There were footsteps approaching, clunking up the path I had just taken. Instinctively, I hid, killed my flashlight, held my breath. The footsteps had a light, and it bobbed at waist level, a camping lantern hooked onto something. I heard the quiet squeak of wheels. The figure lifted the lantern onto a tree branch and I saw it was Dad, pushing a wheelbarrow. 

I blew out a sigh of relief. This was it, Dad to the rescue. The wheelbarrow had to be full of tools, rope, something. Everything was going to be okay. I stepped forward to go to him, to help him save my brother. 

And then I smelled tar.

There are moments that are so ingrained in your mind, you will remember every detail of it forever. And sometimes, you know you’re having one of those moments.

Dad tore heavy bags of powder into the wheelbarrow, poured water in. Used the back of a broom to stir it. He hummed songlessly. Then he lowered the well’s bucket, and emptied a wheelbarrow of instant concrete over my brother. And then he did it again. And again. Until the already drying asphalt reached the brim of the well. He used a trowel to smooth it over.

And I did nothing. Just stood there, pissed my pants, and watched.

I never said anything. Not to my mother. Not to a therapist. Not for the years and years until my own father was buried under his own pack of dirt. Writing this now, looking through my blurred eyes, remembering the way the tar stung them, is the first time I’ve actually gotten it all down.

The closest I ever got to saying something was during breakfast a few weeks later. The search had stalled, the words “presumed dead” had been used. My mom wore black and didn’t talk much. My dad stayed the exact same. 

I was alone with dad at the table. He had been in a good mood that morning, but he always said my questions ruined a good mood. I decided to risk it.

“Dad, why is the old well sealed up?”

The question caught him off guard, and he sat up a little straighter. But he soon got his composure. “I sealed it up. It was in my area during the sweep and I thought it was too dangerous. Wouldn’t want you falling in.”

“Or Thomas.”

“Yeah. Or Thomas.” He stopped, peered down at me. Put his spoon down, bent a little to my eye level. “Hey Michael, you know I would never hurt you or Thomas, right? You know that, right?”

I nodded, quickly, curtly.

“I’ve never laid a finger on either of you. I made a promise I never will and I haven’t.” It was true. That wasn’t his form of torture. I nodded again. “Never would hurt you.” He repeated. 

“But sometimes, God makes his own plan. And it’s like I always say, son:”

“God don’t make mistakes.”
