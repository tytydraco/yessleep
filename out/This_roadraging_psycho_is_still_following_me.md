I’m so angry and scared, I don’t even know what to do.

This whole mess started a few days ago, and it has escalated to a point where I think I’m completely out of options.

So, Monday, as I was driving to work, earlier than most people to avoid the worst of traffic, everything was still fine.

Yeah, I wasn’t thrilled about starting the week; maybe I was speeding a tiny bit to avoid being late, but nothing out of the ordinary happened.

That was until I came to my least favorite intersection. Everyone probably knows one of those.

It’s open; it shouldn’t be hard to navigate, but pretty much every single day, something happens there. Sometimes you see hubcaps by the side of the road, other times flakes of paint, or maybe even a mirror.

The signs at the intersection are all where they should be; they are all readable and uncovered, yet some people still can’t manage to follow them. As was the case on Monday.

I had the right of way, as I always do, from the direction I was coming, yet this big black SUV with tinted windows barreled into the intersection like it was a racetrack!

I don’t know if he didn’t notice me beforehand, but I leaned on the horn, and through sheer luck, the asshole somehow managed to brake and steer his POS car to avoid mine, even if just barely.

I cursed him out, of course. Maybe loud enough so he heard some of it... I don’t know, but as soon as I drove off, that big, dark SUV started tailgating me.

Slowly at first.

I wasn’t about to speed up, still mad at the guy for almost taking us both off the road.

It’s not like I crawled along, but I kept to around 5 to 10 miles under the official limit. That black SUV stayed behind me.

My anger subsided, and after about five minutes, I first sped up; the car kept being right on my heels, and then I slowed down, wanting to let him pass.

He didn’t.

The dark SUV was still right behind me. Almost bumper to bumper.

I couldn’t see the person inside through the tinted glass, but I knew they were looking at me.

That was the moment I got really scared for the first time.

I didn’t know what else to do, so I put on the emergency lights and drove over and onto the shoulder, only for this psycho to immediately do so as well.

My car came to a stop, so did his, and for the first time, I saw something from him.

He didn’t leave his vehicle; he only let down his window and put out a hand.

In it, I saw a gun.

I didn’t need to see anything else.

Without looking, I stepped on the gas and raced off.

Not even ten seconds later, the dark SUV was behind me again. Driving right up to my bumper.

I don’t know what his plan was, but I was scared out of my mind.

In my panic, I was looking for a way to shake him off, but every route I could have taken, he could have followed easily.

His car is definitely faster than mine.

I looked back at his license plate. It was a temporary one.

Thankfully, I’ve been driving that same road for years, so I knew a police station was coming up in a minute. I stepped on the gas and started racing along, while the guy behind me kept hot on my tail.

I still don’t know what the hell he was thinking, but I was determined to scare him off.

Finally, the police station came into view, and I immediately pulled into its parking lot.

The dark SUV drove in behind me, then seemed to realize where we were, turned, and shot back onto the road and off...

I was shaking at that point.

My hands were trembling as if I had just escaped some kind of wild animal, and I stayed in my car in the parking lot for another few minutes before I finally felt safe enough to drive off again.

Of course, I was late to work and got in a bit of a shouting match with my manager because of it, but that doesn’t matter at all.

On my way home, I saw it again. The dark SUV.

It pushed through traffic and overtook three cars just to end up right behind me, where it stopped driving like a maniac.

I knew it immediately.

The moment I saw this thing again, I was sure it would start tailgating me once more. Only this time, there were other people around. Angry drivers honked at the dark SUV, but he didn’t seem to notice or care.

This psycho was here for me. He probably wanted to know where I lived, I thought back then...

I should have been more careful.

In my panic, I called 911 and told the operator that I was being threatened.

To his credit, the guy on the line tried to help me for real. He asked me about the license plate, but as I looked in the mirror to read it, it had definitely changed.

Another temporary one, but the numbers on there were different.

I thought I must have misremembered it, but now I’m pretty sure that’s not the case.

Still, I told the operator, and then he asked me if there was any place I could safely stop, and thankfully, I was just about to pass by the same police station as I had on my way to work.

I turned and drove off the road, but this time, the dark SUV followed.

The driver parked his vehicle right between mine and the entrance of the station.

I think the operator could hear my distress as I watched the guy lower his window a bit and wave the tip of his gun back and forth.

This was too much.

I pulled out of the parking lot while I screamed at the operator for help. Thankfully, another car let me in, so I could race off as I watched the dark SUV still idling in the parking lot, apparently in no hurry to follow me.

I was told to get as much distance between me and the other car as possible, and that officers were already en route to stop this guy.

Back then, I really thought that that would be it.

Maybe the guy had just wanted to scare me.

Well... the officers en route to him would find him and scare him off.

I told myself that the police would make him stop. What a fucking joke.

Tuesday morning, on my way to work, he was behind me again. Tailgating me.

The message was clear. He wouldn’t simply give up.

I called 911 and told the woman on the line the whole story, but the dark car turned off the road before I even reached the police station.

What I do remember clearly is that his license plate was different once more.

He was changing them every time.

A cop car waited for me as I left work and escorted me home.

The dark SUV didn’t follow us, but I think I saw him off in the distance.

It’s all a game to him, I fear.

The cops weren’t too happy with me, of course, but they made sure I arrived back home without a problem, then talked to me for a few minutes.

They told me that he wouldn’t turn up again.

Yeah, right.

The next morning, he was there.

This time, a dark SUV was right behind me the moment I pulled out of my driveway.

He left before I had even finished dialing 911, though, and the operator on the line sounded far less interested than the other ones.

I got to work, but the day passed in a daze.

All I could think about was what I could do to make this stop.

Should I buy myself a gun?

Wave it at him the next time he turns up?

That might just lead to a shoot-out, which is something I really don’t want...

Whoever is driving that damned car could be waiting for something like that.

For me to give him a reason...

Well, I didn’t see him on my way home, at least not until the end.

The dark SUV was idling on the other side of the road from my driveway as I came home.

I only noticed him when I had already parked my car, so I ran inside and locked the door behind me, calling 911 again.

The SUV was gone long before the officers turned up, and this time, they made it clear that I was getting on their nerves...

I don’t think they are going to help me anymore.

He followed me again today. Openly. As if he knew the police were already annoyed.

He had another temporary license plate, although I’m not sure if he isn’t just driving around with some kind of digital one, changing his plate every few minutes.

The guy is a psycho.

I know it. I can feel it.

Should I walk up to him and try to talk it out? No way... He’ll kill me.

Right now, as I’m writing this, he’s idling out on the street, watching my windows.

Sometimes I can see movement behind the dark-tinted glass of his car.

Is he recording me? Or waiting for me to do something?

I don’t know what to do, and I am scared.

He’s been obsessed with me for days already, and I don’t think he’ll stop anytime soon.

I feel like... no. I know I’m in danger.

He’s getting ready for something.

This won’t end with him just driving off.
