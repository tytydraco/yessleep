I didn’t think the house was strange at first.

That’s the part that bothers me the most now.

When my wife, Erin, first suggested we move, I assumed she meant closer to her job or into a better school district. Instead, she sent me a listing with three blurry photos and a price that made my stomach tighten.

“Something’s wrong with this,” I said.

Erin smiled. “It’s just old.”

The house sat at the end of a gravel road that didn’t appear on Google Maps. Not missing—just… unnamed. No street sign. No address marker. The GPS stopped guiding us about a quarter mile out and calmly announced we had arrived, even though we were still driving.

The house waited at the tree line, paint the color of old teeth, windows dark but unbroken. It didn’t look abandoned. It looked paused.

The realtor didn’t come inside with us.

“I’ll wait out here,” she said, too quickly. “Yell if you need me.”

Inside, everything smelled faintly of dust and cold iron. The layout made sense room to room, but the proportions felt wrong—hallways a little too long, ceilings a little too high. The kind of place where your footsteps echo back half a second late.

Erin loved it immediately.

I noticed the doorframes.

Every doorway had shallow grooves carved into the wood, about shoulder height. Not scratches—intentional marks, evenly spaced. Like someone had dragged something heavy through again and again.

“What’s that?” I asked.

Erin frowned. “What?”

“The wood.”

She looked directly at the grooves. “It’s just wear.”

We bought the house two weeks later.

⸻

The first night, I dreamed I was standing in the hallway outside our bedroom.

I could hear breathing behind me.

When I turned around, the hallway was longer than it should’ve been. The walls stretched away, bending slightly inward like ribs. The breathing grew louder, wet and uneven, but no matter how far I walked, I never reached the end.

I woke up with my heart racing.

Erin slept peacefully beside me.

Over breakfast, I mentioned the dream.

“That’s weird,” she said. “I dreamed I was walking toward our room. I could see the light under the door, but I couldn’t get closer.”

We laughed it off.

That was the last time we laughed about it.

⸻

Things changed slowly, which is why I didn’t leave.

The house began to feel… observant.

Not haunted. Not alive. Just aware.

Doors stayed where we left them, but sometimes they felt heavier to open, like pushing against pressure. The mirrors reflected us accurately, but occasionally I’d catch Erin staring at her reflection with confusion, like she was checking to make sure it still matched.

Then came the discrepancies.

One afternoon, Erin asked me why I’d repainted the spare room.

“I didn’t,” I said.

She frowned. “You did. It used to be green.”

It had never been green. I knew that. I remembered the beige walls clearly.

But when I went to look, the room was pale green.

That night, I found an old photo on my phone. Moving day. The spare room—green walls.

My stomach dropped.

Memory errors happen, I told myself. Stress. Adjustment.

Then Erin forgot the pantry door existed.

She stood in the kitchen one evening, frustrated, opening cabinets.

“Where did we put the food?” she asked.

“In the pantry,” I said, pointing.

She stared at the door like it offended her. “That’s a broom closet.”

It wasn’t.

I opened it. Shelves. Cans. Rice. Everything normal.

She screamed.

⸻

After that, the house stopped pretending.

I started finding spaces that didn’t exist before—short hallways branching off familiar rooms, doors where there had been blank wall. They always led somewhere almost familiar. A room that looked like our bedroom but wrong. A bathroom with a mirror that reflected the room behind me incorrectly.

The grooves in the doorframes deepened.

I measured them. Each was exactly the width of a human shoulder.

Erin stopped noticing the changes entirely.

She insisted the house had always been this way. When I begged her to leave, she looked at me with pity.

“This is our home,” she said. “Why are you acting like a guest?”

That night, I heard footsteps pacing the hallway for hours.

When I opened the door, the hallway was short again. Empty.

But the grooves on the frame were deeper.

⸻

I finally spoke to the realtor.

Her face went pale when I mentioned the address.

“You’re not supposed to stay long,” she whispered. “People usually don’t.”

“What happens?” I demanded.

She shook her head. “Everyone remembers it differently. That’s how it keeps you arguing. Comparing notes. Doubting yourselves.”

“Keeps us from what?”

She looked at me then, eyes wet. “From noticing who’s missing.”

⸻

I started keeping a journal.

Every morning, I wrote down the layout of the house. Every door. Every hallway. Every room.

By evening, the journal was wrong.

Sometimes the handwriting wasn’t mine.

I found entries describing rooms I’d never seen, written in my style but with unfamiliar phrasing.

It’s easier if you stop counting.

The house needs consistency.

Someone has to fit.

Erin stopped sleeping in the bedroom. She said it didn’t feel like ours anymore.

She started using a room at the end of a hallway I could never quite remember walking down.

One night, I followed her.

The hallway stretched.

The air grew cold.

At the end was a doorframe with grooves worn smooth, like they’d been touched thousands of times.

The room beyond was small. No windows. No furniture.

Just Erin, standing in the center.

She smiled when she saw me. “I remember now.”

“Remember what?” I whispered.

She placed her shoulders against the grooves. They fit her perfectly.

“The house doesn’t change,” she said gently. “We do.”

The walls shifted.

The hallway shortened behind me.

The doorframe pressed inward.

Erin screamed—not in fear, but in relief—as the grooves swallowed her shape, the wood bending, reshaping, sealing.

When it was over, the hallway was normal again.

The spare room was beige.

The house was quiet.

⸻

I tried to leave.

The road didn’t connect to anything anymore.

The GPS insisted I was home.

The journal now contains only one sentence, written over and over in different handwriting:

Everyone else remembers the house differently.

This morning, I noticed new grooves in the bedroom doorframe.

They’re my height.

They’re getting deeper.

If you’re reading this and you’re thinking of buying a cheap old house that “just feels right,” please—

take pictures.

Write things down.

And if someone you love starts remembering things differently than you do—

Leave.
