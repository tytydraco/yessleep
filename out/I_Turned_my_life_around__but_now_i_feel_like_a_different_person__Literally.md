It's not every day that you get to feel fulfilled. Most people spend their whole life chasing that feeling. Like the dopamine hit you get from watching a good video on your feed. It's there and then gone.

The lowest point in my life was 6 years ago. At the time all I really felt was hopelessness. I kept searching for gratification. In men, drugs, and even social media for a time. I had an account where I would do full makeup and make jokes. Nothing original really. Just riffs on on-line discussion mostly. It was okay. But the money wasn't as much as I thought it would be, and the attention felt suffocating.

So, I used the money that I had made to buy a van and tried traveling the country. I did that right after graduating high school. Sort of keeping the social media thing up with an OF to just to make a living. Just enough for basic expenses.

I think I was in Arizona when I received the call. It was my sister. I hadn't seen her since CPS took her. She was always the sensitive one, so she was the first one that my mom lashed out at when she started to lose it. I was already living with an older boyfriend at the time and doing drugs, so it didn't affect me much.

"Moms dead " she told me. Drunk driver, hit and run. A week later I was at her old apartment helping my sister clean out mom’s old shit. She was a hoarder and never cleaned. Whole place smelled like a Wendy's dumpster mixed with cat piss. It was all garbage except for her jewelry. My sister and I split it and parted ways. I tried to go get dinner or something with my sis, but she wouldn't have it. Something about abandoning her.

I sold everything aside from a gaudy costume jewelry piece. It was made of cheap metal, and the pawn shop wouldn't take it.

One of those stupid witchy pendent chains. Big old black bat with a vile red liquid in it. "Fuck it I'll where it ". That night I was driving 90 mph on I5. I was rushing to get to an old friend’s house before she went to sleep. About a mile from her cabin’s driveway a deer jumped out onto the road and exploded on to the hood of my Subaru.

I was lucky to have barely made it out alive. The stupid bat thing got logged into my throat and kept the airway open. Otherwise, I would have choked on my own blood.

The little liquid vile broke but other than that the piece is still intact. So, I still where it. I'm a driving instructor now. Just kidding, but I do teach kids. I started reaching out to my sister more. We occasionally go to bars, and I let her know Which guys aren't straight. It's a special talent I picked up from being trans my whole life.

My name is Brenda, and this is where my story really begins. We were at a local bar called shays. It's one of those dive bars that smells like puke and holds punk concerts on the weekends. I was telling my sister Heather about how one of my students got in trouble for drawing two of her fellow classmates making out. I had to stop laughing when I first saw the drawing.

Doing something like that without the subject’s consent is pretty fucked up and a very big deal but damn this girl was good. I mean the expressions where perfect and they kind of deserved it for being little shits.

They were rude to everyone and class and constantly getting in trouble with me for making jokes about how "I was a MR not a miss “. My sister was cackling when I felt a rough hand grab my bear shoulder.

The owner of the hand was a bald man with a dark messy beard and unflattering face tattoos. " You think that's funny what that little Witch did to my boy "?

I coughed in surprise. It was a reaction that I gained after getting the scar on my throat. " No sir but my sister does ". He held the non-occupied hand to his ear. He wasn’t being cute, I’m sure he had to strain his ears to hear me. After the accident I had to relearn how to talk and often it was more of a wheeze than actual speech.

" I know the bartender, so either you buy me a drink, or the cops are coming" he didn't seem phased. " I know who you are you know. Little Wana be pornstar cock muncher " he said with a yellow toothed grin. Before I could retort I felt cold steel on the small of my back.

I almost fell off my stool but kept my composure. I tried to give my sister a look and told her everything was fine, but she wasn't buying it. She was reaching for her phone when an equally rough looking man swooped in behind her.

How was no one seeing this? The hawk’s game was on, and home team really had been killing it but that was no excuse. My sister and I got up from our stools and walked outside at the orders of the two humorless men.

It was the standard drunk utterings of someone who felt misplaced in society exploding out the father's lips. My side was winning, and people like him just got kicked around. It wasn't true of course. Every day of my life since I had come out had been undercut by an understanding that something like this could happen to me.

Not to downplay the man’s plight though. Sure, he was a piece of shit about to commit a hate crime, but he wasn't living on easy street. I recognized him from the parent teacher conferences. He worked at the local aluminum processing facility for 20 years. It seemed proud of it. Kept talking about it and how he had never been the bookish type when I brought up his sons’ grades.

It had been 8 months since the lay off and it was honestly sad seeing him lash out like this. " I'm sorry you got laid off, that wasn't fair. This isn't going to help though.". That seemed to soften him up a little. "Thank you, but I don't think people like you should be teaching my son ".

At the point I probably would have told him he could request his son be transferred to a different class and that I would back him on it. Instead of hearing my own raspy voice all I heard was a gunshot then nothing.

That fulfillment I mentioned earlier. As everything went dark, I finally began to feel it. Lately I had been hard on myself but in that moment, I had perspective of all that I had accomplished in the 6 years since my car wreck.

Even before that when I was living on the road, I got sober. I had made a living after that time doing something I truly loved too. I didn't have a partner, but I did have family. My sister, her husband and their child had made me feel loved. My coworkers at the school made me feel loved.

Light came rushing back into my eyes. I was looking at myself dead on the ground. Hole In my head. My sister was on the ground too. Just unconscious though. still had a strong pulse. She had a serious looking bruise on her head though.

The dude who had been holding her must have taken off. Where was the father though? The one that shot me. I looked down. I was holding a gun.

Fuck, somehow, I had Jamie Lee loahanded myself. Only the dad didn't get swapped because well, I was dead.

I drove my sister to the hospital. Carrying her and my own dead body to the car was a breeze. I have my suspicions that cops will be looking for my dead body and my current body soon, but no one was outside behind the bar when I came to.

No one seemed to follow me from the hospital after I left my unconscious sister at the er loading dock either. I know you're not supposed to move unconscious bodies, but I panicked a bit.

I'm at my apartment now typing this up on my laptop. I don't know what to do and this is the only place I could think of posting at.

If anyone has any ideas on next steps, I'm totally open to them. I shaved my new face and used an old wig and some looser fitting clothing to dress myself. I don't have my sleek yoga-built frame anymore though and I don't think a little make up and a cute top is going making this guy look like someone else.

Anyways, bye for now, I guess. Please help.
