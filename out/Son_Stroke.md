Some of my memories get all blurry but that day will be with me forever. It was hot that day and we weren’t used to it.

Mum had taken us to one of my favourite places, the zoo. I always loved watching the animals there, especially the meerkats. I would always find them hilarious, the way they would stand on top of their little dirt mounds like they were little lookout guards. My brother would always be giggling in his pram as mum showed him around.

We spent the whole day exploring that place. I was having so much fun, but it was so hot that day and by the end we were all very tired. Mum was so tired from pushing my little brother in the pram all day.

We eventually decided to go back home. Mum didn’t have a car, so we got a train from near were we lived and got off at the station near the zoo. The walk to the zoo was fine but the walk back was so long. The heat was just never ending.

As we waited on the station platform, I could see how tired mum was. She was swaying from side to side and looked like she was barely hanging on. I could see her eyes slowly starting to close like she was about to go to sleep.  

I remember hearing the train coming and people starting to get up from their seats. It all happened like it was slow motion. I still remember seeing the pram slowly rolling off the side of the platform, onto the tracks. I remember the gasps and shouts from people on the platform. I remember the cries of my baby brother before the train hit.

What I remember most is the sound of mum screaming. I’ll remember it forever. I didn’t know a person could make a sound like that. It reminded me of one of the animal screeches from the zoo. That sound still makes my whole-body shiver when I think about it.

It’s hard to remember the rest, things get blurry. I remember people shouting, people holding my mother as she cried. I remember ambulances and police cars. I remember people in green clothes leading me away from Mum.  I remember crying. Why were they taking me away from Mum, the only person I have that cared for me?! Eventually I was taken away in a car and things get too blurry after that.

It was a while later, but a policeman eventually came to visit me. He told me that Mum was at the hospital, that she was sick from something he called sun stroke and that’s why she had been so tired. It's been a long time since that day, I’m older now, living in a foster home. I hate it here and the other kids don’t talk to me much. Mum was the only family I had, Dad died a long time ago, I don’t have anyone else.

Mum never got better after that day. I never saw her much but sometimes the people at the foster home let me visit the hospital she stayed at. I tried talking to her, but Mum kept crying every time I spoke, she would always cry and wouldn’t look at me. I don’t understand, I thought she would be happy to see me again. I thought we could go back to the good times, but we never did. Mum’s gone now.  I was told she passed away in hospital, I don’t like to think about it much. I’m alone now and I don’t know what to do.

Dad passed away before I was old enough to know him.  We were alone but not really, we had each other. Eventually things got better and for a while everything was great, Mum was happy and smiling again, she always made lots of time for me. We played games, went to the zoo and parks it was great, we were happy.

It didn’t last though and soon Mum started seeing someone, a man. I always hated that man. He took mum away from me. She was so happy before but now she wouldn’t talk to me, we stopped playing games and never went anywhere fun. The man was always loud and angry and Mum was always sad. She cried a lot, even when the man left, she cried. I thought that now he was gone things would go back to the way things were, but then…he came.

Mum sat me down one day. I thought we were going to do something fun, go to the zoo or a park maybe? Then she told me that I was going to be a big brother. I was confused, I thought it was going to be just us again, like before, when we were happy. Mum was never happy again, not like before, not like the old times.

Mum was always tired, and we never did anything fun anymore. Mum would always be with that thing, my…baby brother. Never made time for me, never did anything fun. Mum was always tired, always sad, while my brother always cried. He ruined everything, we were happy, Mum was happy until….it arrived.

I thought I could fix it; I thought I could make Mum smile again and as she closed her eyes at the train platform…I pushed.
