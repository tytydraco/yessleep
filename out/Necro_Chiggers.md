Graveyard grass that grows too tall isn't like the dead neighbor's lawn. Well, actually it is, when one thing is considered. They both glisten with thousands upon thousands of little crimson ones, crawling within the collective preponderance as the cruelty in their nature. It isn't easy to explain; I'd rather forget what I've learned.

It is just too horrifying.

My name is Jake. I’d spend my time volunteering with my old youth group since I was twelve—landscaping, mostly. Pulling weeds, trimming hedges, cleaning up trash. By the time I got to college, I hadn’t thought about it much. But when the opportunity arose during a break, my friend Greg and I decided to visit some of the old neighborhoods we’d worked in, just to keep the habit alive. Most of the places we worked on were in disrepair. Overgrown yards. Abandoned houses. People moving out. The usual.

We came across one house that stood out. The lawn hadn’t been touched in months—maybe longer. It was a rundown little property on the edge of town, and from the street, I could see that the hedges were practically choking the front porch. The place was tucked behind a barricade of trees and had the kind of overgrowth you don’t see in more populated areas. Like no one had cared for it at all. We’d passed it a few times before, but this was the first time we’d felt like tackling it. It wasn’t too far from Greg’s place, so we figured it would be a good, quick job. We'd taken our equipment—trimmers, shovels, and basic tools—and started clearing the front yard.

At first, everything felt normal. Quiet, isolated. The smell of earth and dust. There were some oddities, sure. The house had an air about it—dilapidated, like it was holding something in. The windows were covered with grime, except for one. The back window, which was slightly ajar, caught my attention. Neighbors had stopped by once, maybe twice, but no one had seen the old woman who lived there for weeks.

We didn’t think much of it. Just a draft, maybe. It wasn’t until we reached the backyard that things started to get... wrong.

The first sign was the smell. It wasn’t the typical musty odor you’d expect from a house left abandoned for a while. No, this was something worse. Rotting. But not just food or spoiled meat. Something deeper, as if the house itself was sick. The air felt thick. I remember Greg stopped, sniffed, and frowned, his eyes squinting. "Man, that smells bad," he said.

We followed it around the corner, near the open window.

At first, I thought it was a shadow, or maybe a piece of cloth. But no. It was a body. The old woman. She was crumpled in the corner, barely visible, half hidden by the grime and clutter. I can’t say exactly why it took so long to realize what it was. Maybe it was the disarray of the room, the shadowed angle, or my own mind trying to avoid the truth. But when I finally understood, my stomach turned. The smell grew worse, as if confirming the inevitable.

Greg pulled out his phone and called the police. We didn’t get too close. But the moment he spoke into the phone, something happened.

The air shifted.

At first, I thought it was just the wind picking up. But then I noticed a strange, fine dust swirling around us—clouding the air like some kind of mist. It wasn’t like any pollen or normal dust. It was... *too red.* Small particles, almost like sand, but with a consistency that was far too thick to be natural. They moved with a kind of purpose, as if following some unseen current. Greg and I stared at each other, but we didn’t say anything. Our focus was broken only by a faint, high-pitched hum in the air. It was subtle at first. But I felt it crawl along my skin.

Before we could react, the swarm descended.

It wasn’t like any insect attack I’d ever seen. There wasn’t a flash of wings, no immediate stings, no obvious creatures. Just the sensation of something crawling— *too many things crawling*—on every part of my skin. I tried to swat at it, but the dust clung to me like static, embedding itself into my pores. It burned.

I didn’t know what was happening. All I knew was that I needed to get away. But the swarm only grew more intense, coating my arms, my legs, my neck. I screamed, or maybe I didn’t. It was hard to tell with the shriek of Greg in my ears; the overwhelming sensation of thousands of invisible claws digging into my flesh.

Greg was the first to fall. He stumbled, swatting wildly, but it was no use. He collapsed to his knees, his face contorted in pain. The dust had already taken him, eaten away at him. His skin turned a sickly pale shade, almost translucent. His eyes were wide, desperate—but unconscious.

I ran, not caring where I was going, only that I needed to *move.* I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t see.

"I'm burning!" I screamed. Somehow, in the direct sunlight, the swarm retreated, leaving my skin feeling scalded. Droplets of blood formed all over me, as they had nearly chewed me open in some places. I moaned in pain, before I realized Greg was still back there. I started crying out for help.

By the time help arrived, Greg was gone.

In the hospital I was asked some questions by a researcher. They showed me on their phone that the house was under a quarantine tent. Apparently, some kind of carnivorous mite had encountered mutagens from a new kind of 'waterproof hair conditioner'. They knew about it, as this was the fourth report. When I'd answered their questions about what happened I asked:

"Isn't there some kind of recall on this product?" but there was no response. Then I asked what they were, exactly. Those things that had attacked and terrorized me and killed Greg. I was staring at a picture of them and told they were a subject number, swarming from dead bodies, some kind of chigger apparently. Necro Chiggers, that's what I named them.

They are still out there, breeding and at any moment it's possible for new ones to mutate into those things. That's my understanding. Just because a product is approved for use doesn't mean it is safe.

Nature will always have the last laugh on us.
