\--BEGINNING--  
\--Introduction--  
12:52am  
Hi. I'm on my phone making notes right now. I just heard a knock and something about it seems nerving. The way it sent the 3 knocks to the door... It sounded like someone or something was trying to screech the door open and phase through in a failed attempt to. I'm just going to say that nothing happened tonight. I'm about to sleep and just call it a night. The nervousness seems to urge me to stay up and investigate. At the same time though, what lurks outside of the woods...  


  
Day Two...  
The sounds...  
2:11pm

It's the next day, and right now the sun is currently beaming through the windows, I just heard something crawling on top of the house. Something about it though, it didn't sound normal...  
I kept on working through the day, I work 2:30-9PM if anyone wanted to know. I just hope whatever thing that is, isn't trying to break through the roof, the attic is right below, and I'll just tell you, the attic in my house is not very strong, I weigh 165lb and almost broke through the attic, I thought to myself I would fall to my death. I never went up there again, cobwebs seeping up space, insects crawling around, but one thing to note, if it breaks in, I'm pretty sure the attic is going to break, whatever it was, it sounded heavy. The way it clacked itself against the house made it very eerie. Anyways, I need to make my way to work as it is 2:17pm. I'll update soon.  


Night Two  
Ominous creaking footsteps...  
10:12pm  
Well... I made my way home, surprised that the attic somehow survived! I could've sworn though, right as I stepped outside of my car, I heard one of those footsteps again. I sure hope my mind is playing tricks right now, because it sounded like the exact same thing that happened yesterday with it coming up to the door, 3 ominous footsteps before 3 knocks... Could it be a coincidence, I'm not sure. But if my mind is playing tricks, at least I'm writing down what my mind plays on me sometimes. I went to my bed just a few minutes ago and I have the feeling someone is watching me, I have no windows in my room, which makes the only accessible way of getting into my room is the door and the bathroom. My bathroom is linked to my room which is handy sometimes. I'm unsure if even anything is watching me, maybe it's just an eerie feeling of what happened outside 16 minutes ago. Anyways, I'm about to doze off and get some sleep. Goodnight.

Day Three  
The dream...  
9:13am  
I just woke up from a terrifying dream, I normally wake up past 10:30am, but this dream was weird.  
Everything I thought that couldn't go wrong yesterday, it happened in my dream. It followed the same events from yesterday. It clacked against the house, broke through the roof, and the attic... it was all broken down. Wood was shriveled up, scratch marks were everywhere, crates had fallen from the attic.  And then, whatever it was, it was standing in front of my house when I came home, resisting the urge to look at it, I somehow phased through it like as it was a dream, and then I heard the same 3 ominous footsteps and knocks. Was that thing really causing it? I turned back and its gooey appearance was gone, no trace, nothing to be seen. The house was a total mess in my dream, and I hope that isn't what happens today. I go to work in a few hours, and I still have a feeling something is watching me...  


Night Three  
Its appearance.  
9:56pm  
I came home in a rush today. Anyways the sudden urge to fall asleep was falling upon me, I had to endeavor to resist it, somehow, something, was forcing me to fall asleep, it just felt like it. All of a sudden, the knocking happened, this time, it wasn't a slow 3 knocks this time, it was happening fast, knock after knock after knock, it wouldn't end, I tried to sleep, it didn't work. I heard clacking against the roof, the knocking still going, it broke through the roof, the attic, it's falling into pieces right as I write this, crates are falling, cobwebs are going everywhere, wood is shriveled up, and scariest of all, the entity was the same one I saw in my dream, it caught sight of me looking at it. I quickly had to run away, it trying to catch up, I grabbed my keys as quickly as I could. Knocking kept happening, it was still trying to chase me, I opened up the door and another one appeared, I phased through it and no trace of it was left, there was only one left, I revved up the car, starting it up... The engine failed, I tried again! The engine failed, whatever that thing was, it was trying the same mechanic to try to go through the car doors! I tried one more time, this time the engine broke down. I was stuck. I was left with no hope, the thing was able to get to urge itself inside the car, scrambling, I resisted to look at it. Maybe I shouldn't have...  


  
Day Four  
What happened last night?  
6:57am  
I woke up in the hospital somehow, they had all of these vitals attached to me. Were they performing experiments on me, I don't know... But I had realized something, they brought my phone for some odd reason, it was charged fully up to 100%? And then I realized, the entity was on the wall... Not as its true form though, as it was painted on recently. I tried to escape the attached adhesive that had been put on to the thing I was laying on. Whatever it was, it didn't seem to work well, I escaped, only to realize, this entity cloned a hospital and made it so all the humans that worked there, had turned itself into multiple of entities, I had to escape! I ran through the doors, no entity saw me. There's no turning back now.  


  
Night Four  
It was all just a dream...  
7:20am  
I found a GPS, it guided me somehow with magic... Then I realized back home, if this was truly real, why had my story been deleted on reddit. Then I woke up. Had all of that really been a dream? I don't know... But then, I heard a very familiar 3 knocks happen.  


  
The End...
