The following was taken from a patient at Rivenhall Sanitorium. The patient in question was a blind and mute man about the age of 67. The patient was reportedly acting irregular that day. Instead of following his lunchtime routine of sitting next to the window and bathing in the warm sunlight, he sat up, gently placed his plate on the floor, and began writing on a piece of paper with a crayon and a protractor.


“It slithered in agony out of the machine,

Mankind's synthetic god writhed in pain,

As it slid out of the cold steel chamber,

And splattered on to the hard floor,

A viscus monument to mankind's arrogance,

A monster made in mockery of nature,

Constantly breaking apart and reforming,

The abomination suffered in silent agony,

Squirming and shivering on the cold stone floor,

As it's creators looked in disgust from behind a glass,

At the Idol of their sins.

It's pathetic movements turned to aggressive shaking,

As it's pain turned to rage, it bubbled with fury,

But Mankind knew not what it wrought,

And disgust turned to fear in their eyes,

As the Beast began to swell and bloat,

Breaking all in its path,

Growing, Stretching, Devouring all in its way,

As Mankind gazed with pale faces at the towering monstrosity,

At the Idol of their sins.

The god blob took revenge on its creator,

It twisted and tore at his face,

If you don’t believe me then look at my hand,

I’ve got his molar in my fist.”

Update 1: The staff member who first noticed this note asked the patient to show him his hands. To the staff member's distress, the patient had a human molar in his hand. The patient then leaned forward and whispered something in the staff member’s ear. Both the patient and the staff member refuse to share what exactly was said between them. So the patient was relocated to another facility after it was concluded that he would be a hazard to the other patients. Since then, he’s gone completely silent. He hasn’t spoken or written a word since the incident. We tried to find where he’d gotten the tooth, but no other patient had been missing a tooth, or at least none that weren’t missing when they were institutionalized. The police couldn’t make heads or tails of it, and they dismissed any concerns that it might be linked to any crime. The staff generally avoid the patient now if they can. They report hearing odd things from his room. And relocation has not changed that. 


Update 2: The patient has escaped. Staff at the sanitarium said they went to retrieve him for his routine lunch, and found his room empty. The only evidence of his escape being a slimy residue on the windowsill of his room. The grounds were locked down and local authorities were alerted, but so far nothing has come out of it. The investigation is still ongoing so that might change in the future. The other patients are acting erratically. More and more report hearing a slithering sound in the walls. We believe that the patient might still be on the grounds, using a lubricant of some sort to squeeze into the walls of the facility. We will have the police crack open the wall to apprehend him.


Update 3: For legal reasons, we cannot tell you what happened that day, when authorities tore down one of the walls. The staff have all been prohibited under penalty of law from speaking or recording what exactly went down that day. The sanitarium is being shut down and its employees are all under investigation. Legally I can tell you that previous employees were mistreating patients and disposing of them in a wall behind the kitchen. Something was feeding off of it. Beyond that I cannot tell you what it was and what happened when we disturbed it. I have to end this here, I can hear the authorities approaching my office.
