I’ve spent so many hours watching people bicker about if God exists or not. It actually became a pastime. The atheist going “prove God exists” and the theist going “I don’t have to”, it all seems so silly now.

Now, there’s this interesting method for determining if a religious text holds historical truth, called the criterion of embarrassment. Basically it says “if someone were making this story up, they wouldn’t want to paint the character in an embarrassing or weak light”. One example is when discussing the historical Jesus, where it says He was born in Nazareth. Nazareth was a middle-of-nowhere town that no one cared for, so scholars generally agree that the historical Jesus was born in Nazareth, since who would want to actually follow someone from nowhere?

Anyway, I’m beating around the bush. I guess because acknowledging what I saw makes it real…

About a month ago, I was doing a historical-religious project. We were a group of archaeologists, historians, linguists and theologians. We were in a site in Lebanon, and we believed it was connected to ancient Canaan. There were lots of strange discoveries there, things that could rewrite our understanding of the origins of Abrahamic religion, possibly Ancient Near Eastern religions as a whole. References to Gods and peoples that shouldn’t have been known at the date we placed these objects. But one find stood out to me.

First, some context:

When we first began the dig, we had a guide with us, Karim. He was a funny man, stout with a prominent belly and thick accent, always wearing a deep navy shirt and leaning on his mahogany cane. Even though we tried telling him we speak Arabic, he insisted on speaking English.

"It is proper for me to accommodate you as guests" he would always say, with a hearty belly laugh and a slap on someone's back. Karim always found something to smile and laugh about, almost always having 'Alhamdulillah' somewhere in a dialogue.

When we got closer to the site though, his cheery attitude soured, and he became much less jovial. The grey strands in his beard almost became more noticeable, and when we arrived at the site, he refused to cross the boundary. He bent down and drew a line in the sand between himself and the flags marking our location.

"Brother, I must leave you here." He said with stoney eyes.

"What? Why brother?" I had grown so accustomed to calling him that, I just picked it up from how much he would say it.

"That land... It’s not right. A djinn cursed it, my father always told me." There was a tremor in his voice, and his bright smile seemed to be nothing more than a distant memory.

"Okay brother. Thanks for getting us here." I held my arms out for a patented Karim hug, where he squeezes so hard you can feel your ribs bending, but it somehow is the most loving feeling. But instead, he shook my hand and then turned on his heel to walk off. He swayed for a moment, and I heard sadness in his voice.

“Do not look too closely here, brother. Some things want to be seen, and they follow the eyes home.” The words poured out, delicately chosen as he departed.

I walked towards the rest of the group and caught up with Michael, one of the theologians.

"Hey Mikey," I placed a hand around his shoulder in a side-hug "Karim says this place is cursed by a djinn. Thoughts?"

"Well, if there's a djinn here, hopefully it's a friendly one. But we should pray there's none here.” His eyes stared into the midst of the roped off section. Michael is from Lebanon, and is one of the more spiritual members of the team. We failed to account for his prayers when planning the time to get here, which he was unrealistically gracious in forgiving.

So we began to dig. Michael and I went over some old documents, describing prior excavation attempts here. One note stood out to me above the rest:

"We have retreated from the site. The majority of the staff became ill after digging in section 4a, and the men insist on the presence of a la'nah being on the land.”

So, naturally we began to dig at section 4a. Michael was worried about the la’nah, which he described as a curse. Niamh, one of the archaeologists, dug and joked about ‘the curse of Ra’, but after a whisper-shout conversation with Michael, she stopped making that joke and dug with embarrassment sitting in her cheeks.

Eventually she came up to me holding several brick-shaped objects, wrapped in an ancient brown cloth. She beamed at me as she placed them on my table, her skin shone from sweat yet the dirt absorbed all light.

We named them the Sarafand Theonymic Tablets, and catalogued them as STT-1 through to 6. It was my job to translate STT-1, and the subsequent tablets, STT-2 through to 6. But just tablet 1 should’ve been enough for me to resign.

So, I was sitting in a make-shift tent, with the tablet on my table, surrounded by papers and books. I began to translate.

*“Let these be a record for all flesh,*  
*An inscription of divine truth.*  
*Let all who read know,*  
*And let all who know read.*  
*Blessed are the ignorant,*  
*For they are beyond His reach.”*

That first bit took me 4 days of almost non-stop work. It was around this time Jarred, one of the historians, came to check on me.

“Tony, how’s it going in here?” He chuckled out as he entered my tent. I slouched back into the hard wooden chair, rubbing my eyes.

“How do you fucking think, dude?” I groaned out.

“That bad, huh?” He chuckled as he picked up one of my books, thumbing through the pages.

“Yeah, I need a smoke. When’s the next supply run?” I groaned as I stood up, feeling every muscle in my legs stretch.

“Mike’s going in today. I’ve already told him to get your cigs, don’t worry,” He grinned as he placed the book down, “I gotta say, I don’t envy what you’re doing there. All I got to do is look at shitty carvings of naked people and write down what they’re holding.”

“Oh fuck off, you got lucky.” I chuckled as I flipped him off. I heard him sidle away, out of the tent. I stretched for a moment before gazing at all the tablets on the table. My eyes flickered over tablet 6, and I noticed it looked different. I couldn’t sight-translate yet, but I could tell it didn’t have sentences, per se, but rather it had just single words. I felt a small jitter of excitement at what that could mean, and I got back to the first tablet.

*“These words record the knowledge*  
*The hymns of ʾIlūma.*  
*For He is first*  
*And He shall be last.”*

So, it was around this point that my excitement grew even more. ʾIlūma appeared to be a new God. The name looks like it would mean something like “The God from whom all Gods Emanate”, which alone could make most scholars have to retract their essays and statements. But my excitement changed as soon as I began the next line.

*“ʾIlūma hungers for those who read*  
*He who craves those who sing the hymns*  
*He who desires those who worship*  
*He who set the vassal gods in their stations.”*

As I sounded the words out, I was fine, the excitement was still there. As I wrote the transliteration on my notepad, I was fine. But once I began to understand them, read them in English, a coldness settled behind my eyes. I called in Emma, another theologian, so she could check my notes and make sure I translated right.

“That looks right. I mean, I wouldn’t have done ‘craves’, maybe ‘longs for’ instead, but overall it’s fine.” She looked at me, puzzled. Her blue eyes stared right into my soul. Even though the creepy tablet should’ve been a mood-killer, I couldn’t stop the butterflies from writhing in my gut.

“But have you ever seen a tablet, or any ANE text that suggests a God wants to… y’know… eat humans?” I babbled out, trying to remain professional. She giggled at my question, a soft and beautiful laugh that could even make Tiamat calm.

“Lamashtu, but she’s a demon…” Emma began, her brows furrowed in thought, “Mot devours Baal and sends him to the underworld. Psalm 97 is Yahwistic and it talks about consumption, but that’s fire…” she trailed off

“So, uh, nothing too new?” I darted my eyes between her soft gaze and the hard tablet.

“It is kinda new. Mot eats gods and men, but that’s all I can think of off the top of my head. Sorry Tony.” She looked into my eyes with empathy. Even as the words on the tablet clawed at my understanding of the divine, I couldn’t stop my eyes from drifting to Emma, watching her as she left my tent.

I sighed as I got back to my work. Cigarette in hand, I began the next section.

*“Let those who read know this:*  
*Our Lord hungers.*  
*Know we speak true*  
*With our final inscription.”*

My eyes began to sting, as if the words themselves were worming through my pupils, spreading through my brain. Questions began to flood my head, ‘What would he hunger for?’ was the biggest one. The table itself began to feel cold to the touch.

Now, I’m not going to give you every single line from these tablets, but two specific lines stood out to me.

*“We wish we could love our Lord,*  
*But we know we must have fear.”*

And

*“May those who know share*  
*Speak falsehoods for our Lord*  
*Make him pleasing*  
*Make him desirable.”*

This is where that criterion of embarrassment comes in. Here the texts explicitly say to lie. To make this Iluma seem more palatable. So why would they keep the texts saying this horrific shit? The tablets go on, saying;

*“There shall be worship of our Lord*  
*The worshippers shall ascend to our Lord’s home upon death*  
*And their souls shall fill our Lord’s halls*  
*And He shall feast upon their essence.”*

Upon finishing that line, my hands were trembling, and my throat felt closed tight. I heard a whisper behind me, but I couldn’t make it out. I felt my eyes shifting towards the sixth tablet, the intricate stone carvings beckoned my attention. I slowly moved over to it, and saw a line I had missed previously.

*“For proof of our Lord’s knowledge,*  
*Scribe yourself a series of numbers.*  
*Any value, and any amount.*  
*Then read ahead, to see our Lord’s power.”*

It was then I packed up. I was constantly nauseous, my head was hurting. On the journey home, the long plane ride, I scribbled away on some loose paper. I decided to start writing some numbers, and I still don’t know why I did it, but I did.

When I landed, Jarred had sent me a text.

“Hey man, hope your flight home went alright. Just thought I’d let you know Emma translated that sixth tablet, since you had started on it before you left.” and what followed was a typed-up string of numbers.

The same as the ones I had scribbled down. Whole numbers, decimals, square numbers, prime, everything.

I’m at home now, but I kept writing numbers. I don’t know why, maybe an attempt at having some control. But I kept writing, and I wrote for a long time. I didn’t have a pattern in mind. I even rolled some dice to determine a handful of them.

Then another text, this time from Emma. One line, and an attached image.

“Hey, Tablet 6 was double sided! Check it out!”

With even more matching numbers.

My first instinct was to call her. Hearing her voice, her laugh at my stupid dad jokes. I had the urge to talk to her about all of this. Tell her what's going on… but I knew that if she knew about Iluma, she would also be damned to His hunger.

I began to obsess. I scanned the numbers over and over. I checked coordinates, but none fit. I checked phone numbers, but none made sense. I checked fucking library book numbers.

The criterion of embarrassment. A God that isn't benevolent, or even apathetic. A God that hungers. A God that knew every number I would write. But I decided to be thorough. My philosophy is: Once is an accident, twice is a coincidence, thrice is a pattern.

So I reached out to Niamh. I asked her to write down a random string of numbers, as many as she wanted and of any value. Maybe her numbers would finally break the pattern. Maybe I’d laugh about all this in the morning.

Then I waited.

While waiting, I read, studied, researched. I was drenched in a cold sweat, the taste of metal lingered on my tongue. My hands shook violently with every movement. Then the phone buzzed.

A perfect match.

I didn't need a third. That alone would be proof. Enough to convince any reasonable person. But what if she had read the tablet? My logic refused to let me be satisfied. But I didn't know who to reach out to. I sat at that desk for hours before I realised.

Karim.

A simple text, I told myself, just enough to interest him.

“Hello, Brother,” it began “how are you? I've made it home safely! I hope you're well! This might be an odd ask, but could you send me a bunch of random numbers? It's for a theory I have. I hope to hear from you soon!”

My phone was heavy in my hands. Pressing send, it felt like those crumbling stone tablets were back before me. I put it down like a bag of sand, with defeat and weakness. My exhaustion was too much and I fell asleep at my desk.

When I woke up, I checked my phone. The blurry light piercing my waking eyes, I tried to force them open as I read.

“You read the tablets, brother. I'm so sorry. I tried to warn you. That place is cursed”.

I then came here. I'm sorry, but I need to know I'm not alone. I have many regrets in my life. Not saying goodbye to my dad, going to the party that led to my ex dumping me, not asking Emma out. But this will not be another regret.

“Let all who read know”

“Let those who read know this:  
Our Lord hungers.  
Know we speak true  
With our final inscription.”

I'm sorry you had to be one of those that know, please forgive me. I know where we are going, and what awaits us. I just can't do it alone. I can’t be the only one that knows.
