My name is Ria. I am 22f. I've always been big into the metal scene, searching for the most obscure and upcoming bands. 

I've been to some crazy events, but as time went on... the underground scene just kind of seemed to die down, shows became fewer and far between. It all started 6 months ago when my best friend since childhood, Mikey, 22F, showed me a video that had viral on one of the forums we frequent for upcoming shows.

 The band's name was "The Afterlifers" (clich√© I know). The band contained 4 members, and all the members wore some kind of mask or veil over their faces. Never once revealing what they truly looked like. 

"WE HAVE TO SEE THEM, RIA!!" Mikey said with a huge smile on our face "Its been months since we've been to a show! We have to go. "  I glanced at the video uninterested at first, completely unimpressed by the masks. "Don't you think the face covering is a little much? I feel like that's so overdone, no?" I said, completely unimpressed, assuming that was their entire gimmick.

Mikey grabbed my face and looked me in the eyes ," Ria! I can guarantee you we've never seen a show like this." She then shoved the phone in my face. In the video, the band was performing mostly covers. Yk the usually mainstream metal stuff. At that point, I was ready to just completely ignore Mikey's plea. 

That was until the singer in the video stopped to speak, his voice familiar. I couldn't figure out from where I'd heard it before, but it caught my attention. The lead singer, who simply went by S, spoke," Thank you for coming out tonight... now I'm sure you're here to see our big finale." The crowd cheered, a mix of completely euphoria and genuine concern. 

S seemed to smile under the viel covering his face," That's what I love to hear! Now, may I have a volunteer?" He reached his hand out, kneeling at the edge of the stage, waiting for someone to grab his hand. Many in the crowd were hesitant, some even backed away from the stage.

 While some in the crowd raised their hand waiting to be picked, a girl no more than 19 years of age stumbled through the crowd and over the railing in a trance almost. Her eyes void of any emotion, her face gaunt and exhausted. S reaches for her, the girl taking his hand and stepping onto the stage with him, he turns to her then back to the crowd and in a scream that made your blood run cold he shouts," WE HAVE OUR VOLUNTEER!!!!" As he screams, the drummer, only going by T, begins to drum softly. The lights in the venue go completely black. The silence was deafening even through the video.

Suddenly, a glow emanated from the stage. A light unlike any I've ever seen," Hell of a light show." I say under my breath snarkily.

   S turns to the girl, looking deep into her eyes through his viel," Tell me... what ails you?" The girl looks deep into his eyes, for the first time she shows emotion. Fear. In a low, trembling voice, she says," My twin sister died last month... I'm scared because... I don't know if I'll ever see her again. If... there's anything after death... if there isn't, I've lost her." S smirks and pushes her to her knees," How noble of you..." He says before he walks to his guitar player, I, reaching out his hands. I then pour a red liquid into S's hands. S walks back  quietly, whispering something as he seems to draw symbols on the distraught girl's face. 

At this point, I am interested, I've been to death metal concerts but this was pretty fucking metal so far. 

 That's when the bassist, X, begins playing. Soon the rest of the band followed. S smiles," Do you wish to see your sister again?" The girl nodded slowly, closing her eyes. That's when S pulls a gun out from behind his back and holds it to her head, without a moment of hesitation he pulls the trigger. Blowing her brains all over the audience. "

JESUS FUCKING CHRIST!! WHAT THE FUCK, MIKEY!!!" I say disgusted. Yeah i liked the hard-core shit but live murder was a little far for even me. Mikey leans in and whispers," Keep watching." 

I reluctantly turn my attention back to video, the band is now playing. A melody unlike anything I've ever heard, a song that touched my very soul but not necessarily in a good way. 

I could feel my blood run cold as S began screaming something in a language unfamiliar to me. One that seemed older than time. That crowd entranced as a giant portal opened behind the band. On video it just looked like bright light. That's when the girl, previously deceased, sat up and the portal closes as the song ends. She looks up at them, the bullet hole gone but the blood and brain matter still splattered on the stage. Before jumping up with tears in her eye," Thank you..." S smiles at her then turns to the crowd," Until next time." Just as fast as they appeared on stage the band was gone and video ends. 

I stare in shock, now this was my kind of show. Mikey's eyes lit up," Have you ever seen special fx like that?!? It's fucking crazy! We have to see them!" I looked back at her," I'm down, looks like blast... no pun intended." 

Mikey scrolled through their page showing me other shows, each cause of death different but the chant, the song everything about it was the same. Except each volunteer "died" differently, usually in some gorey way. One even appearing to be cut in half by a sword, only to get back up as though nothing happened. Not even the symbols remained on their faces. 

For the next month Mikey and I tried desperately but failed to get into their show. Each show was sold out each time. 

Mikey and I went to our favorite spot as we did every weekend. There we ran into a few of our friends. Paul, 24M, Niki, 25F, and Niki's older brother, Jacob, 27M. Niki approached us, her usual demeanor reminesant of a golden retriever, but boy could that bitch mosh. She spoke," Fancy seeing you ladies here!" Paul and Jacob waved at us," Have you guys seen that new band, the afterlifers?" 

Mikey immediately stood up, her obsession with them had grown over the last month and our inability to get tickets to their show only made her crave it more," No! Have you?! We haven't been able to get tickets for shit." She sat back down begrudgingly, she had upset herself with the reminder she hadn't seen them live. They shook their heads then Jacob said," 

My friend, Manuel, saw them, he says it's legit. No special effects." All 4 of them turned to face him in complete shock. Paul scoffed, he was always a skeptic," There's no fucking way. You can't bring back the dead. They probably have audience plants or something."  

Jacob shook his head," Nah man, he's never been the same since. He said his girlfriend, Erica, just kind of fell into a trance and with strength he'd never felt from her before she pushed through the crowd against his will and got on the stage. He said he saw her head roll off her body, he felt her blood splatter his face. He watched her die." Niki shivered," No way, we just saw her yesterday. Although she was the happiest I'd ever seen her since her mom died." 

I looked up at Jacob," So you're saying it's real... I don't buy it." Jacob shrugged," Hey don't shoot the messenger, I'm just telling ya'll what he told me." Mikey was even more intrigued," OK. Now I have to see them or I will literally die." I chuckled," Hey. Maybe you'll get to see them after you die." Mikey puts me in a head lock of a hug," Aw you'd miss me that much." I just smiled at her, she was right. I would. I do. 

As the months went on, Jacob and Niki's grandpa died. Shortly after his passing they got into the show. Niki called Mikey and I screaming super excited," Jacob and I got tickets to see The Afterlifers!!" Niki was excited, this was the most enthusiasm she had shown in weeks since her grandpa died. The loss of their grandpa however effected Jacob deeply. He was different, they used to go hunting and fishing together all the time. 

That stopped when he got cancer then passed a month after being diagnosed. I had to ask when she called," That's great but how are you and Jacob?" Mikey nudged me, giving me a look to signal that now wasn't the time. On the other end of the call Niki was silent then spoke," Yk I'm doing pretty ok, I miss him but Jacob... he hasn't been the same, he won't eat.

 He barely leaves his room for anything but work. I'm worried about him. That he might do something rash." She then mumbled quietly," He seems... excited for the show tho... just not the same way I am." I frowned," I'm glad to hear that at least. You two have fun, tell us if it's legit or not." Niki's tone changed," Yeah, wouldn't that be something... I'll let you know how it goes, bye." The call ended and Mikey just stared at me," Read a room jeez, it's still fresh." I sighed," I know but at least she'll let us know, i mean we've been trying for months and for some reason we just can't get tickets." Mikey couldn't deny she wanted to know," Alright." 

 2 days later, I was woken up by a call, it was Paul. He was frantic, I picked up the phone," Wow, crazy that you call me out of all people." Paul immediately cut me off," I can't find Niki... she's not home and neither is Jacob. Their parents haven't seen them in days." I immediately sat up," What?!" Almost on instinct I began getting dressed," When did you last see them ?!" Paul was silent for a moment,"... I saw them last night when I picked them up from the show. They were different. Jacob had this grin on his face, like he'd seen an angel or something. His eyes... they just... he wasn't right."

Niki was going on and on about how their deceased loved ones were waiting for them. That she couldn't believe that the afterlife was so beautiful. She went on on about... how this is torture... this is hell..." Paul began to wheep," I didn't believe them... God I didn't believe them, what if they...Oh God." I ran out my door and immediately went next door pounding on Mikey's door. Mikey opened the door disheveled and obviously still tired," Why are you pounding like a mania-". 

Mikey cut her sentence short when she heard Paul's voice through the speaker, crying. This was very unlike Paul, usually the serious, collected one. I immediately explained the situation," Have you seen them?" Mikey shook her head," No but... there's one place they may be." Mikey snatched the phone out of my hand," Paul, we're coming to get you, you're obviously not in any condition to drive." Paul agreed and we took off to the only place they could be. There was an old warehouse outside of town that the group hung out at in their youth. It had since been condemned to be demolished by the same construction company Jacob now worked for. It was a 30 min drive outside of town. 

They sped there like their lives depended on it.  Upon arrival they found Jacob's car parked outside. Paul immediately got out of the car before I could fully stop," Hey dude!" I turned off my car and put it in park. Mikey chasing after him," Slow down idiot! That's tresspassing!" Paul found an opening in the fence that was seemingly cut open, forcing himself through with a quickness unfamiliar to his personality. 

Cutting himself in the process. Paul ran full speed towards the building, desperately searching for a way to look inside, praying he'd find them. Paul had a thing for Niki but was way too scared of losing her to do anything about it. Now time was against him. Mikey and I followed behind him. The moon is the only light shining our path. Finally, Paul found a back door that had been smashed in completely, a sled hammer lying beside the remains of what was left.

 Paul raced into the entrance, Mikey and I attempted to catch up with him," Wait up!" Upon entering, he found both Jacob and Niki, sitting in the center of the room. Hands tied together to a pillar. Niki looked up," You guys can't be here! It's not your time yet!" Niki was haggard. Her eyes dilated with madness. She wasn't the same girl he loved anymore. Jacob watched then looked at Mikey and I," You guys have to leave. NOW!" I immediately ran over and attempted to cut them off. Jacob lifted his leg and kicked me. Hard, a strength almost inhumane, the same madness clouding his mind," You don't get it!!" 


Paul ran at Jacob, grabbing his shirt," I will not let you kill the girl I love!" Jacob once again pushed Paul away. Sending him flying into a pillar on the verge of collapse," My sister and I have had enough! Leave us be!" Mikey attempted to call 911. Her phone suddenly died despite the 95% battery. I attempted to catch my breath, my ribs obviously broken. Mikey rushed over to me. Paul relentlessly trying to get them loose. Both Jacob and Niki fought tooth and nail to stay tied to the pillar. By the time Paul got them untied, he was practically beaten black and blue by Jacob and Niki.


 They'd never so much as hurt a fly before outside the pit. This wasn't them anymore. That's when I looked up and saw it. The reason they wanted to stay on the pillar. Above their heads were explosives up by Jacob, the demolition expert. Thecountdownn hadn't started yet, but it only had 5 minutes on the timer. Jacob sighed," I guess I have to do it." 

Jacob pushed the trigger, suddenly as fast as this, and all happened. We helplessly watched the wick burn, unable to get them to come to their senses. That's when we heard sirens outside. Blue and red lights flashing through the broken windows and cracked walls. With only 1 min 30 sec on the timer, Mikey made a decision for Paul and I. We had all grown up together, we could leave them, but Mikey grabbed Paul and I dragging us to safety, both of us too injured to get save ourselves. As we made it out of the gate, the officers helped Paul and I when they realized how injured we were. Paul looked at the building, tears poured down his face," I should have told her before,  now she's gone... the Niki I loved is gone." With that final word. The building blew open with a blaze of fire and smoke before collapsing in on itself. 

After being hospitalized for a week, Paul and I were released. Paul was consumed by grief, a hallow of the man he once was. Distraught by grief. Paul began spending more time with Mikey and I. We found comfort in each other's company. Mourning the loss of our friends, the change in people, the deaths, the insanity. All of this started because of that fucking band. 

Paul, Mikey and I sat at our usually spot as we did every weekend. Paul broke the silence," A ticket for the show appeared on my dresser..." his hands shaking as he lifted the coffee to his mouth. Mikey's enthusiasm for the band had died down after Jacob and Niki died. I held my head in my hands," So much death since they came to town, but no one they kill stays dead... what the fuck are they..." Mikey looked at me surprised," Wow, so now you believe, huh?" Paul chugged his coffee," I'm going to see them." Mikey and I almost spit out our coffee and looked at him," Paul... you can't be serious, you saw what seeing the afterlife did to Jacob and Niki... it's not for us to see." Paul slammed his fist on the table," I know but... I need to see her Rita... I love her, I will always love her." He stood up, leaving his part of the bill and walking out. 

A few days later Paul knocked on my door, I opened the door," Hey... what brings you here." Paul looks at me, his eyes filled with... peace," Rita... this is... I miss her but... God I wish I was with her... she is somewhere beautiful... May i come in?" I opened the door all the way. Stepping aside so he make his way to the couch. I locked the door and sat down beside him. Paul was quiet," Don't worry... I won't hurt myself or anybody... Niki said it wasn't my time yet. That I'm not supposed to die yet... I spoke to them... they said they had to, it was their time." I looked at him," What..." Paul nodded," They told me they had already seen their deaths... that's why they'd seen it." He gulped," I saw how I'm going to die too..." I gasped," Are you sure you're ok?" Paul nodded," I couldn't die now even if I wanted to... its simply... not my time..." He grabbed my hand and held it," Just know... if you go to the show, you will come out a different person... you may wonder why I went but... grief makes people do crazy things." Paul got up and walked to the door. He turned and waved," Goodnight..." He closed the door. Paul left town shortly after that. 

About a month ago, Mikey and I were mentally recovering from the shit show that had been our social life for the last 5 months. Most of our friends were gone and we only had each other now. Mikey got us tickets to see my favorite band, V.I.P. to cheer me up... I wish we didn't go... God I wish we didn't go. On our way out of the venue Mikey carried me into the car, she was always the strong one, she could be a real mom sometimes. I was so fucked up I just laid down in the back seat. I closed my eyes for a moment only to be woken up by my body getting slammed into car door. In a daze I could see police cars and  an ambulance. I sat up, my vision finally coming back as the paramedics pulled me out the back. That's when I saw it... the driver and passenger seat had been completely smashed in... Mikey was being cut out by paramedics. As my vision faded, I whispered," Mikey." before losing consciousness.

I woke in the hospital room 2 days later, I had rebroken my ribs (great, right?) I had a concussion and some minor bruises. My family sitting at my bedside. My parents immediately went to hug me only to push a little too hard on me," Ow mom! That hurts." Through tears she choked," I'm sorry baby, I thought I'd lost you..." As I looked around the room, I saw that Mikey wasn't there. I sat up the best I could," Where's Mikey?" My mother and father looked at each other. My father sat beside me, my sister avoiding eye contact with me. I remembered what I saw," She's ok right....RIGHT?!?" I looked into my dad's eyes begging for him to tell me she's ok. His lip quivered and he began crying. My father was always a softy," I'm sorry, Rita... Mikey didn't make it...". With those words my world came crashing down. Everything... everyone... I'd lost them. Why? Why me? Why us? We were just a group of metal heads that wanted a good show. 

I screamed in pain, both my body and heart hurt. Mikey and I were best friends forever, but now she was no longer here with me. I lost my soul mate. I was discharge 2 weeks later. My life had changed completely, I understood true grief. As it consumed me I could hear their voices at night, blaming me for not saving them somehow. Why did I live and they died? I started seeing Mikey in my dreams. 

Sometimes, the Mikey I knew, sometimes that bloody pulp that was once Mikey being cut out of the car. As the nightmares became more frequent, I felt my will to live slowly. Slip away. 3 nights ago, I came home from work and found a ticket to The Afterlifers on my dresser. I picked it up and immediately burst into tears," This is hell! Why did you take them from me!?" The loss of my friends hitting me like the truck that took Mikey from me. My lungs, devoid of air. Once again I looked at the ticket and bit my lip. I tried to burn it, tear it, I even ate the fucking thing but still... it appeared over and over. Finally i did it. I took the fuckign ticket and went to the show last night. 

I walked into the venue alone, standing towards the back. The show was pretty routine as usual, nothing unique. As the show closer and closer to the main event. The singer, S, asked the question of the night," Do we have any volunteers?" Like a switch was flicked, my body frozen, my blood run cold. My vision focused on him as he reached out his hand. As if my body was being controlled by someone else, I began to move. Without a problem, just like the girl who got through in the video that started my own personal hell. 

Before I knew it, I was on the stage, standing before the man I blamed for it all. S did something different this time. He grabbed me and turned us around. His back facing the crowd. 

He removed his viel, showing the face of a corpse, long decomposed but with eyes, untouched by time. Yellow, glowing, the color of gold. I was horrified but unable to move. S smiled, showing razor-sharp teeth that would not be on a human corpse, but I already knew this man was no human. 

S snicked," What ails you?" As if on instinct, I said," I've lost everything. My friends are gone. My best friend... my soul mate is gone. She was the only person I felt like I could spend a lifetime with." S was satisfied. He pushed me to my knees as he'd done to those before me. Step by step, he painted me with the red liquid. A liquid I realized was blood. As the music began and the portal opened. 


The bassist, X, impaled me with the tip of his bass, ripping out my heart. I watched as my still beating heat just pumped on the tip of the bass. I could feel his fingers and hands ripping through my body as he played. As my vision faded, I saw the light. 

I saw her, Mikey, she ran to hug me. Niki and Jacob came too, my grandparents, my childhood pets that long passed. A field of flowers. It's more beautiful than I could ever imagine. Colors I couldn't comprehend. 

Mikey smiled at me," You finally got to see it." She held me tight, I held her tighter," God, I don't want to go back... please... I can't live without you..." Mikey shook her head," You can... and you must..." She kissed my forehead. Letting me go," No... NOOOOO." I screamed as she let me go. I woke up on the stage, S's now veiled face standing over me. Everyone else but the band gone. I sat up," Why am I still here...?!" S leaned in," You're special..." As he said that he eyes glowed. 

I looked at the rest of the members, their eyes all glowing the same inhuman yellow. I immediately backed away," That voice..." That's when I realized it couldn't be his... that voice belonged to someone dead for over 2 decades. S smiled," I had to borrow this one to appeal to the audience... my real one is a little less..." his voice changed to a deep guttural growl, a nightmarish symphony of gurgles and screams," palatable." As the band members stood around me... that's when I realized... S.T.I.X...riverstix
 
I began to cry," What do you want from me?!" I felt like I was going mad with grief. S leaned in," I want you to live." Just like that, I woke up in my bed as though nothing happened. My heart back in my chest, my ribs completely healed. 

I attempted to take my life 5 times today. All of which were unsuccessful.

 I hung myself this morning. The rope broke before my neck. I slit my wrist in the bathtub and fainted, only to wake up healed 30 minutes later. 
I drank a whole bottle of anti freeze and immediately regurgitated all of it, unable to keep even a slightly toxic amount down. I stabbed my heart, and the knife broke on impact. I took a whole  bottle of sleeping pills only to wake up to a bottle of pills I couldn't get the pills out of. They were fused to the bottle. Paul was right... it's not my time... they want me to live. I will not know peace until they allow it... S told me so...
