Yesterday, I fell asleep as if being buried alive.

Not gently. Not drifting. It felt like the mattress melted, swallowed me, and I slid through layers of damp fabric into something deeper. I dreamt I was walking through a corridor . Every surface trembled with fungi that pulsed in epileptic bursts of color. Each spore carried a fragment of memory: my childhood dog dissected on the kitchen floor, my mother’s hands peeling away like cigarette paper, my own face sinking into a puddle of black milk. And a voice, my own voice ( maybe ), whispered: “They’re tunneling into your brainstem !”

When I woke up, the dream hadn’t ended.

When I woke up, I wasn’t in my bed.

I was lying face-down in soil. Damp, cold, bitter-tasting soil was packed into my mouth and between my teeth like bread too long left to mold in a sealed crypt. Damp, sour, worm-kissed. I spat it out.  
At first I thought I was buried alive. But then I noticed the space around me. It was a tunnel, maybe carved out by hands or claws. The ceiling was so low I couldn’t sit up straight.  Worm-castings glistened overhead. The air was swollen with a loamy musk, the kind that slicked the lungs and made the heart beat out-of-sync.

I tried to push myself up, but my arms refused. My fingers had become white cords, mycelial threads sprouting out of the nailbeds, weaving into the dirt like intravenous lines feeding the ground itself. When I pulled, the earth screamed, a wet, muffled sound, as if I’d yanked nerves out of living flesh.

That’s when I saw them.

Not rats. Not men. Something in between. They looked like… gnomes, I guess. Tiny, bent-backed things with glowing button eyes and mossy skin, skittering at the edges of the dark. One of them dragged a giant centipede across the dirt and just bit its head off like it was a carrot. They didn’t run away when I try to moved. They just… stared. Yes, they stared at me the way butchers stare at livestock, measured and impatient.

Before I could scream, something cold touched my shoulder. I tryed to turn and saw another creature, bigger, almost human-sized, but with the face of a blind mole. Its pink eyes cataracted and blind, its skin hung loose, gray, with claws that looked more like digging tools than hands. It leaned close and whispered:

“You’ve been seeded.”

I try to scream then I realized I wasn’t breathing on my own anymore.

Something was working my lungs for me. Blooming into my throat.  A slug-shaped respirator glued to my sternum pumped its own uneven rhythm, inflating and deflating my chest. My ribs creaked as if they were no longer mine. Each breath tasted like mildew and iron filings.

The mole-thing kept talking, its breath hot and sour. “We needed your dream. You’re from the Top. The Dry. The Barren. Your brain is fertile.”

At that instant I knew I was being used, in that cold, indifferent way the universe had of repurposing the broken.

The gnomes hissed, and the spores in the air bloomed, strobing in psychedelic patterns. Suddenly I could *s*ee it all . All this place ,tunnels made of marrow and fungus, walls throbbing with heartbeat rhythms, entire palaces carved from the ossified nightmares of strangers. They were mining dreams the way others mine coal. Every sleeper was a seam, every nightmare a harvest.

The mole-thing leaned closer again, so close I could feel its whiskers brush my ear.

“You’ll dream again,” it said. “And when you do, we’ll mine you.”

I woke up in my bed. Or at least I think I did. My sheets were black with damp soil. My fingernails are packed with earth so deep I can’t scrape it out. When I coughed in the shower, something soft came loose in my throat.

I reached in and pulled out a mushroom the size of a thumb, pale, veined, still twitching.

I don’t think it’s over. I think it’s just beginning.
