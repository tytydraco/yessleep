So I turned 45 this year and you know how you know? because at my recent physical my doctor says to me, *Guess what time it is, Gary?* and I look down at him and say, “About 10:45?” and he says, *It’s colonoscopy time, baby!* Oh but don’t worry, the terrifying thing in this tale is not my tail end – say, an exiled old god residing deep within the distal portion of my small intestine… or that little fiberoptic camera they use snaking its way into a Backrooms that waits implausibly inside me… or the proctologist coming across a pattern of polyps that when decoded power off our shared reality – no, the horror that waits inside me waits inside the other end of me, the brain end of me, which, come to think of it, left hemisphere, right hemisphere, kinda looks like a butt, so take that as you will, but at any rate, official butt or nay, it’s time to do like the man in the movie says and hold on to yours, because I just saw something, something right outside the bathroom door, something I worry that I’ll never unsee, that lays sinking into the quicksand of my hippocampus – that’s your short term memory, folks – becoming my ghastly past with each passing second.    

Let me back up.     

Today has been prep day. For what? My colonoscopy, obviously – have you even been listening? It’s scheduled for tomorrow morning, which for those of you unfamiliar means spending eight to twelve hours of the day before becoming intimately familiar with a substance known as polyethylene glycol 3350, aka PEG formula, aka a motherfreaking laxative they require you to drink a whole-ass gallon of leading up to your procedure, this salty, fish tank-tasting powder you shake out into your water that has a single solitary function: inducing a biblical proportion of poops.    
 
My roommate, Sam, he knew what was up. When I told him this morning, he glanced up quick from the sports bet on his phone, said, “Hey, you should make a day of it.”    

“A day of what…?”    

“A day of call me when it’s over, pal, because I *do not* want to be here.”     

Sure. I mean, I didn’t want to be there when it happened either, but I didn’t really have a choice in the matter. At least they try to make it tolerable. The solution they give you, it comes with a little packet of lemon-flavored powder, but even if you make the stuff taste like Godiva chocolate you’re still basically hotwiring that “EMERGENCY EJECT” button hidden somewhere inside us, reserved typically for our last moments here on Earth – not simply being 45, on a Tuesday, with a roommate addicted to sports betting.   
  
I wanted it over as fast as possible. So I started Googling: “Advice for colonoscopy prep.” “Tips for drinking a gallon of laxative.” That kind of thing. Until six search queries later and thirty links deep, I found it, in a Reddit thread titled “How to empty yourself,” the advice that has brought me to now, peeking out the crack in the bathroom door, white undershirt soaked in flop-sweat, heartbeat a rubber mallet.     

Let me back up again.     

*Looking 4 the absolute purge? The elimination 2 end all eliminations?* read the Reddit thread, *Tell u what u do: squeeze a few drops of liquid caffeine into your PEG solution. You’ve never SEEN an evacuation like this! Eight hours? No, you’ll be done in no time!*     

I loved done in no time. Low commitment. Minimal effort. Those were some of my favorite words. So with Sam out the door and on his way, I got to work. I searched through the pantry, found some of his water enhancers, the energy kind, aka the *caffeine* kind. I mixed in a spurt of that and the laxative powder and a big fat gallon of water all together in the plastic jug they sent along, plopped down on the futon in my bedroom, no obligations, no plans, just a trove of unwatched movies on my Plex server, Ms. Poly Glycol, and me. I was well on my way. Destination: toilet.    

Hour one.    

So I finally watched *Lawrence of Arabia*. Or thirty-five minutes of *Lawrence of Arabia* anyway, because that was how long it took for the PEG sludge I’d been downing from title card to brownface Alex Guiness to bond with the water in my body, initiating, well… you know what.     

Hour two.     

Hey, that Lawrence fellow, he’s a complicated figure. Lost in the desert proximate to Arabia, surrounded by emptiness on all sides, a vast nothing bearing down on him. And let me tell you, I knew something about vast nothings by this point: I was quickly becoming one. Trip after trip to you-know-where for you-know-what, I was well on my way with half my gallon gone. Come at me, oblivion.     

Hour three.     

Was getting hard to follow the Lawrence flick. It wasn’t really complicated, I just couldn’t stop thinking about all that limitless desert at his feet. The edge of endlessness. Infinity’s face, a thousand years young, as it menaces the living with its empty immensity.     

Also: toilet, toilet, toilet, toilet.     

Hour five.    

*Wait,* you say, *Five? You were just on four!* Yes, that was how I felt too, waking up with the right side of my face weighing heavy on the blue-and-white tiles of the bathroom. What happened? I don’t know. A nothing happened. Not nothing-nothing, but a something-nothing, an hour of something-nothing something, which had apparently zapped my consciousness. My throat hurt, as if I’d vomited but there was nothing around me. The door was closed. My gallon jug was on its side, three quarters empty now. I got up on one elbow, lifting the jug to my lips, when… a sound caught my ear. I turned suddenly, PEG gunk spilling from my lips, splashing. But I know what I heard: a voice.     

Let’s say human.    

I got to my feet, groggy, exhausted, feeling more hollow than man. I was a shell of a person by this point, a flesh husk paying a steep deductible for the privilege of such. You know, contrary to the ever trustworthy Reddit, emptying the self was turning out to be no small task. Go figure. The human body is basically a self-sustaining, self-aware storage unit – food, water, DNA, carbon, bacteria by the billions, tartar, skin cells, strings of fluid pumping through our bodies thick as snot and safe-kept inside the thing we call us.    

There it was again, the voice. The “human voice.” I put my ear to the door, listening. I couldn’t quite understand what it was saying, only that it *said*. That it spoke, that it *was speaking.* I mean, it wasn’t so strange – how many times have you been in the bathroom and tried to figure out what someone was saying through the door? “Huh? What? I’ll be out in a minute!” This was nothing new. This was probably nothing new.    

Temple throbbing, teeth sore from where clearly I hit the tile, mind cloudy, I slowly opened the door, peeked out. Feeling drained, *Lawrence of Arabia*-levels of empty, I saw it, emphasis on “it.” I thought it was Sam at first – I mean, eventually he *would* come back, right? – sure, Sam. Maybe he took pity on me and came home early only to catch me still occupying the John. So I did what you do is that situation, I went a little red-faced (surprised my body could manage it), blurted out “Sorry!” and was just about the shut the door when I noticed… Sam didn’t budge. “Sam” didn’t do anything. Didn’t cover his eyes. Didn’t yell out, reply. No, instead “Sam” just stared. Stood there in the dim light of the hallway, glasses glinting in the bathroom light. Except… Sam didn’t wear glasses. His eyes were circular. And that wasn’t the only disturbing part: his whole body was something else, what “was” of his body anyway, which I now realized was missing legs. He was not standing in the dim hallway so much as he was emerging from the dimness of it. Instead of non-shadow partially obscured in shadow, this thing was shadow, a silhouette punctured left and right with eye holes that shone brilliant.     

I had the door mostly closed at this point, watching. When suddenly a third eye appeared, right between the first two, except… lower. A circle growing and growing. When I realized it wasn’t an eye – this third hole in the shadow’s face, it was a *mouth*. Expanding. Silent. A scream swallowing itself. No, not silent. There was a rushing noise. Air through a passage unobstructed. As if this shadow had nothing inside it. We humans, we are mad collectors. We collect, consume, ingest, imbibe. It’s like the top-line crucial thing about us, that we acquire, accumulate, keep, around and of and in ourselves. We define our world by what we have – and and what we have inside us, that is the most defining-us of all.    

This shadow thing, outside the door now, I think it used to be inside me. I think I let it out. Exhaled it like a second self, a shadow self. I’d emptied my body so hard that the empty became its own thing. Imagine that somehow you could take the void, give it a shape, appendages, well that’s what this thing was.     

And that brings us back to now. The thing I’ll never unsee. The quicksand hippocampus, the short-term memory pit, my ghastly past and the passing seconds. Watching with the bathroom door nearly closed now. Can feel the spring of the latch as it depresses, waits on edge. I watch as whatever that empty thing is begins to grow. Larger. Larger. When I realize: it isn’t growing, it’s coming closer. Closer. Closer. Ten feet. Eight feet. Five feet. Four.     
I slam the door the rest of the way shut, lock it. I back away, trying to turn the sight into some kind of sense. Bend it to my command once more, define it by me than myself by it. But I’ve lost that chance now. Whatever it is, it’s out. It can be anything it wants to be now.     

*Knock, knock.*    

And what it wants is to be in here with me.
