Around here the cacti, trees and bushes rise verdantly from sepia fields. A contrast created by resilience. A landscape which, in my youth, I felt the call to explore. So my backpack would be emptied of its schoolwork, then filled with a change of clothes. As I set off, my imagination would run wild with childish impossibilities and blissful delusions born of ignorance. I wish I could say I ever made it further than a good half mile down that road, but what is a kid supposed to do when his stomach is rumbling?

  
Today I walked the fence of the White House on the Hill, siphoning memories from the landscape through my eyes. There was the rock I had smacked my head on when I fell out of our ATV. The tree which held the first bee hive I had ever seen in person. The thorn bush I crawled beneath to sate my curiosity, and the perforated shadow it cast in the hollow between itself and that oak tree. There was the window, and the barren, cold ground beneath it. Strange how now, those things which once harmed me both physically and psychologically bring a cold, comfortable nostalgia.

  
Eventually, I found myself standing between that fence and the corner of the house. The trees requested silence with the breath which periodically flowed down that hill. Beneath the canopy, chain links shook in the cold. There I stood staring at the straightest path to the gate at the back of the fence line. The gate which opened into the woods at the foot of that hill. The gate where those tracks had led twenty years ago.

  
I continued through that gate, drawn by some strange compulsion. The dirt road slithered through the trees like a headless serpent. Its scales I made once and then made again. I met a deer on those scales once. A doe which startled me as I rounded a corner, then again as it reared. It towered over me, and as it swung its forelimbs, I showed it my back.

  
As I stepped through that memory I came to where the road straightens. A path used to run behind the dilapidated tin shed to the left there. I wore it into the grass myself on a small four wheeler. It ran through the trees to a perfectly circular field. If I had gone there in the present, I'm sure I would have found myself neck deep in a familiar amber sea. When I was a kid, there was no hope of seeing over all of that grass.

  
I found a hunting blind there once. A simple plywood construction. A box crafted for the kill. At first, all I could see was the roof. I was extremely careful navigating toward it, as I wasn't sure what the terrain was like. The four wheeler bucked as I rode over a hole. Fortunately I had gotten pretty used to riding over rough ground though, and I stayed saddled. I made a mental note of that dip as I approached the blind.

  
It smelled of mildew, and looked like I had been the only biped to enter it in years. The slit offered a narrow view of the tips of tan blades from my vantage. Deciding there wasn't much of interest beyond the rickety stool in the corner, my attention shifted. I wanted to see the field in its entirety. The legs of that stool held my weight surprisingly well as I watched the wind roll the grass onto verdant cliffs. There was only a hint of the path I had cut, yet it granted me some comfort.

  
It took me far too long to notice the silence.

  
It took me far too long to see the fresh wake splitting toward me.

  
Wonder was swiftly replaced by fear. My mind had placed me in The  Lost World. Before I knew it, I was kicking the four wheeler into gear. I fled at full throttle, standing on the footrests. I was still beneath the surface, tearing blindly through the grass as it did the same to my skin. I prayed I wouldn't be sent over the handlebars by that obfuscated hole. I began to question my direction as adrenaline dilated time. Then relief came as sudden as the open air, and I sped back toward the dirt road.

  
I had only paused a moment to acknowledge where that path had been. For an instant it was almost as if I was expecting to witness the climax of that memory. Or the unveiling of its antagonist. My intent was further down the road though, and my attention soon followed. It carried me to where the path prostrated itself as if in reverential fear of the treeline.

  
Before, the approach of that trench seemed to bring the silent attention of everything with a beating heart. Their satellite eyes transmitted to me their horror. However, my child mind misinterpreted those signals as the thrill of adventure. As a dragon to be slain. God, how naivete betrays the child just as integrity does the virtuous. . .

  
Now there is only the passive rustling of leaves and birdsong. A peace which feels out of place. So seeing little more to be gained, I turned home as I had dozens of times before.

  
I'm still unsure what I was hoping to achieve. Each memory is like a carcass left to rot upon a web of neurons. An essay without a subject. A story with no moral. What was the purpose of that walk? I don't know. I can't help but feel like I was being led. Pulled along toward a void of answers. Teased by obscurity. Impossible as I know it is, I would have settled for a trace of my best friend at the very least.

  
His name was Pepper. He was a Blue Heeler. Every day after elementary school I would drop my bag under the carport as he leapt into my embrace. Of course, I always fell back, laughing as he did so. He was the kind of dog whose eyes shone with a human-like intellect. No other has been able to live up to him. We used to play for hours, strengthening our bond each day with every fetched ball, every tugged rope, every tandem step. When the sun fell though, I had to be inside. I thought I was the reason he began trying to squirm his way in. The reason he began whimpering and scratching at the door every night. I often wondered where he went in the silence that followed. I longed to hear him in those dark hours. Now, I wish I never had.

  
The winter after that behavior arose, it began. The frigid winds carried a blood chilling wail on the quietest nights. A sound like a woman screaming in lamentation as she ran frenzied through the trees. It sent icy serpents slithering down my spine. Ultimately though, its source would give me what I longed for.

  
That night the voice erupted from somewhere near the base of the hill. Each subsequent call grew louder, with intervals like a giant's footfalls. My parent's and I took our usual positions by the front door. We were just in time for the crescendo to be interrupted by a snarl. It was an unfamiliar sound from an all too familiar canine. Just on the other side of the door Pepper began baying into the renewed silence. His barks grew in volume and ferocity. A language of violence I was unaware he knew. Then he moved away from the door. To the very spot I would stand twenty years later. It didn't take long for snarls to transmute into whines. For his encouraging intensity to shift into a paralytic, squealing terror. I knew that whatever was out there was turning the tide. I knew that Pepper was losing.

  
I was overcome with dread. All I knew was that I needed to help. That I didn't want to lose my best friend. I didn't understand why my father held me from that door. Why he didn't listen to our pleas. Today I'm grateful. If he hadn't, Pepper's blood might not have been alone as it pooled in those tracks. In those paw prints.
