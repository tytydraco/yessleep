The sun streamed through the windows of the McDonald's, casting a warm, golden glow on the faces of four friends sitting in a booth. They were laughing and enjoying their breakfast, a light-hearted banter filling the air. The comfortable hum of idle chatter mingled with the sizzle of the deep fryer, and the scent of warm, greasy food wafted through the restaurant.

Daymion Gallo, a 20-year-old male with red hair and blue eyes, took a sip of his coffee before addressing his friends. "So, are we all set for the day trip to Flagstaff? I heard there's an amazing spot for photos up in the mountains."

Shaemus Heginbotham, Daymion's 22-year-old brother, pushed up his glasses with a hint of excitement in his blue eyes. "Definitely! I've been doing some research, and there's a place called 'Aspen Corner.' It's supposed to be incredible this time of year. The leaves are changing, and the views are breathtaking."

Karina Traynor, Daymion's girlfriend, brushed a strand of her medium-length brown hair behind her ear as she listened intently. Her brown eyes lit up at the idea of an adventure with her friends. "That sounds perfect! I've been wanting to get some new photos for my Instagram. Plus, I've never been to Flagstaff before."

Reganne Ghirardelli, a 5-foot-3 brunette with brown eyes and Shaemus's fiancée, chimed in. "Count me in! It'll be nice to get out of the city for a day, and I'm excited to see what Flagstaff has to offer."

As they continued to discuss their plans, Daymion suddenly felt a chill crawl up his spine. His vision blurred, and he found himself in a nightmarish scene set within the McDonald's. The once bustling restaurant was now eerily silent, and time seemed to slow down as he observed a series of events unfolding before him.

An employee, carrying a tray laden with food and drinks, slipped on a puddle of soda that had gone unnoticed. The tray flew into the air, and the contents tumbled to the ground in slow motion. A large cup of iced coffee collided with a helium-filled promotional balloon, which had been drifting lazily near the ceiling. The balloon, now punctured, spiraled out of control, its ribbon wrapping around a decorative paper banner hanging from the ceiling.

The weight of the balloon tugged at the banner, which was anchored to a wall-mounted TV on one end. The force was enough to dislodge the television from its mount, causing it to crash onto the counter below. The impact sent a canister of powdered coffee creamer flying into the air, scattering its contents like a cloud of dust.

The friends, seated together in the booth, watched the bizarre scene unfold before them. As the cloud of powdered creamer hung in the air, a nearby heat source—an exposed wire in a malfunctioning electrical outlet—ignited the highly flammable dust.

Flames erupted, and the fire spread rapidly throughout the restaurant. Reganne, who had been closest to the outlet, was quickly engulfed by the flames. Her friends looked on in horror as the fire consumed her, leaving them paralyzed with shock and disbelief.

Shaemus, desperate to save Reganne, grabbed a fire extinguisher from the wall. He pulled the pin and aimed it at the fire, but in his panic, he failed to notice that the extinguisher had been tampered with.

The pressure gauge showed it was overcharged, making it a dangerous weapon rather than a life-saving tool. As Shaemus squeezed the handle, the extinguisher exploded in his hands, sending shrapnel through the air. A jagged piece struck him in the temple, and he collapsed to the ground, lifeless.

Karina, realizing that the situation was growing dire, frantically searched for an escape route. She noticed a window that led to the outside and made a run for it, hoping to break it open with a nearby chair. However, as she lifted the chair to smash the window, a dislodged ceiling tile, weakened by the flames, fell onto her. The heavy tile struck her head, causing her to lose consciousness and collapse onto the floor, the fire closing in around her.

Daymion, now the last of the group still conscious, fought to maintain his composure amidst the chaos. The fire roared around him, and the heat was nearly unbearable. He spotted an emergency exit and made a desperate dash towards it, his heart pounding in his chest. Just as he was about to reach the door, a support beam, weakened by the flames, collapsed in front of him, blocking his path.

Trapped and with no way out, Daymion felt a sense of hopelessness wash over him. He closed his eyes and braced himself for the inevitable. But in that instant, the horrific vision faded away, and he found himself back in the booth with his friends, the restaurant once again bustling with life.

Disoriented and shaken, Daymion took a moment to process the terrifying vision he had just experienced. He knew that he had to act quickly to prevent the horrifying chain of events from becoming a reality.

"Guys, we need to get out of here right now!" Daymion exclaimed, urgency lacing his voice. The others, startled by his sudden outburst, exchanged confused glances but could see the fear in Daymion's eyes.

Without waiting for a response, Daymion hurriedly ushered his friends out of the booth and towards the exit. As they left the restaurant, the chain of events from Daymion's vision began to unfold behind them.

From the safety of the parking lot, the group of friends watched in shock as the McDonald's burst into flames. Daymion's heart raced as he realized the gravity of the situation and the narrow escape they had just experienced. Though the ordeal had been harrowing, he knew that his vision had given him the opportunity to save his friends from a gruesome fate.
