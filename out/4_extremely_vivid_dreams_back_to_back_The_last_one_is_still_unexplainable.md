I have always been an extremely vivid dreamer. I have dreamt about dead loved ones many times. The ones that were positive, were great. There was one specific one that I was running down a hill, towards an ocean. The most beautiful colors and flowers all over. No worries, no pain, just pure happiness. As I made my way to the ocean, my deceased best friend was standing by the water. She turned to look at me and we hugged tightly. It felt like heaven. The energy and scenery was beautiful. I remember not wanting to wake up, not wanting that hug to end. That’s just an example of a positive vivid dream. Now for the creepy vidid dreams that happened back to back:

The first one began, I was sick subconsciously that night with a cold. In the dream, I got up from my bed. Made my way towards the kitchen to get medicine. I saw dark insidious figures in my room, down the halls and in the kitchen. It all felt very real. Until, I noticed myself in underwear. I never sleep in underwear. I sleep in basketball shorts. So I told myself in the dream “this isn’t real. You are wearing shorts. This isn’t real, wake up.” I was able to wake myself up and went back to sleep when the creepy vivid dreams continued. 

The second one that immediately followed: I was with my great grandmother (mom’s side) who passed away in 2007, my grandma (mom’s side) who passed away in 2020 and with my mother. The entire dream felt like the movie insidious. Everything in that dream can be described as “the further”, the term in that movie for hell / the inbetween. I remember exactly where the 4 of us were sitting in my grandma’s kitchen. It was all around just dark, sinister. My mom gets up from the table and walks into another room, which is also dark with an insidious vibe. I told my mom, “why did you get up and leave? We were talking to grandma. That was rude.” She responded: “that was not your grandma, your grandma is in hospice unconscious and dying. That wasn’t her.” Which that was the situation with my grandma IRL. She died from pancreatic cancer and was unconscious for 2 months before passing away. As soon as my mom told me that, I immediately woke myself up. 

The third one that immediately followed: It was my grandmas rosary. Everything seemed fine. My grandma died March 2020. During the rosary I see my best friend who died September 2019, sitting alone. I went up to her and I immediately began to cry. Once again, we hugged tight. After that hug, the dream jumped to a funeral. I am assuming it was my grandmothers, based on the rosary taking place before the setting change. But aside from that, I can’t confirm it was 100% my grandmothers funeral. The dream immediately became dark, sinister and insidious. I saw something evil, walking around the cemetery with a black umbrella covering their face. Just twirling around the umbrella in circles. It was extremely unsettling. This figure had hooves for feet. They never removed the umbrella from their face. But I knew, it was not anything positive. It was almost at joy watching myself and my loved ones in grief. Finally, I was able to wake myself up once again and escape that terrible nightmare.  

The fourth one that immediately followed: I was tossing and turning all night, due to the cold I had and all the vidid dreams I kept waking myself up from. I have a salt lamp in my room that is on 24/7. For it to be turned off, you literally have to physically switch it off. I really thought I was awake. That’s how vivid this dream was. I see a woman like figure coming up to me. My salt lamp isn’t bright enough to see details of the figure. I assumed it was my mother. They walked towards the salt lamp and I said “what are you doing? Don’t turn it off. I always keep it on.” All that was responded was “shhhh…” and the salt lamp switch went off. I thought it was my mom so I eventually went back to sleep or maybe I was asleep, I don’t know. What I do know is, the next day when I was fully awake… the salt lamp was indeed shut off completely. I immediately confronted my mother and told her “I told you not to turn it off. Why did you?” She replied “I never went into your room last night. Also, I have no reason to turn off your salt lamp.” That’s when my stomach fell. I know my mom, if she had done it… she would admit it. Also like she said, she has never had a reason to switch it off, ever. That one left me unsettled. Who was that woman like figure? Was I dreaming? Even if so, how was the salt lamp completely switched off? That can never be explained.

\*Another additional positive dream about a deceased loved one: I was at the beach with my entire immediate family. This time, It was my grandma on my dad’s side who I saw. I was the only one who could see her, nobody else noticed her. I waved at her and she smiled and pointed at my dad. Signaling me to get my father to notice her. I pointed at her to my dad. She called him over and they began walking the beach. When I told my dad about this dream, he said “I hope that’s not her way of telling me that it’s almost my time to go.” That’s all he said. This dream happened over a year ago and thankfully my dad is still well and alive. I mentioned the positive stories as well, as a slight insight for you all to understand how vividly my dreams are. There are many more that I can tell— Positive, negative, creepy and unexplainable. I just will never understand how I have such vivid dreams about deceased loved ones.
