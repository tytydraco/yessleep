I'm a horror novelist from Surrey, though I rather wish I'd stuck to writing cozy mysteries after what I've witnessed. My agent keeps ringing, asking about my next manuscript. If she only knew why I've missed my deadline... I suppose I should write this down, though my hands won't stop trembling as I type.

 

A month ago, I travelled to MO Forest seeking inspiration. Writer's block had been plaguing me for months, and my publisher was growing rather impatient. I'd heard whispers about this particular forest on various paranormal forums - tales of mysterious disappearances and unexplained phenomena. Perfect research material, or so I thought.

 

I arrived in the nearby village on a dreary Tuesday afternoon. The sort of place where everyone knows everyone, and outsiders stick out like a sore thumb. The locals at the King's Arms pub fell silent when I walked in, though that might have been due to my London accent rather than any particular prejudice.

 

"Looking for a room," I said to the barman, a weathered fellow with hands like old leather. "Somewhere quiet, preferably near the forest."

 

He paused in his endless glass-wiping routine, fixing me with a peculiar stare. "Planning to go into the woods, are you?"

 

"Research for a book," I explained, settling onto a creaky barstool. "I write horror novels."

 

A few of the locals exchanged meaningful glances. An elderly man in the corner actually crossed himself.

 

"You seem a sensible sort," the barman said, leaning forward. "So take my advice - if you hear chains dragging through the leaves at night, run. Don't look back, just run."

 

Naturally, being the sort of fool who writes horror for a living, I pressed him for details. That's when I first heard about the Judge.

 

"Bloody tall fellow, he is," the barman continued, his voice dropping to barely a whisper. "Wears this peculiar coat with patterns sewn into it, like something from one of them Eastern European countries. Hat with feathers, too. But it's his eyes you'd notice first - green they are, like poison."

 

An old woman at the end of the bar suddenly joined in. "My Harold saw him, he did. Three years ago, just before he..." She fell silent, dabbing at her eyes with a handkerchief.

 

"The chains," another patron added, "that's how you know he's coming. Then he says that word..."

 

"Guilty," the barman finished. "If you hear that, well... best start praying for dawn."

 

I spent that night in a room above the pub, scribbling notes and searching online for any mention of similar legends. Nothing quite matched what I'd heard, though I did find several news reports about unexplained disappearances in the forest over the past three decades.

 

The next morning, I rented a rustic cabin five kilometres into the forest. The estate agent seemed almost relieved to have someone take it, even at a suspiciously low rate. "It's yours for as long as you need," she said, avoiding eye contact as she handed over the keys. "Though most folks don't stay more than a night or two."

 

 

The cabin itself was a rather dilapidated affair, though sturdy enough. A single-room structure with weathered logs and a tin roof that creaked ominously in the wind. The rusty padlock on the door was oddly unlocked, swinging gently despite the lack of breeze.

 

Inside, the air hung thick with the musty smell of abandonment. Just an iron bed, a weathered wardrobe, and a wooden desk that had seen better days. Perfect for a writer's retreat, I thought at the time. How bloody wrong I was.

 

That first night, I dozed off while working on my laptop. What I saw in my dreams... Christ, I wish I could convince myself it was just a nightmare.

 

A young couple had taken shelter in the cabin. The lad was trying to impress his girlfriend, showing off like young men do. They'd been drinking - I could see the wine bottle they'd brought. The girl was giggling, perched on the edge of the very bed I'd been sleeping in moments before.

 

That's when I heard it - the sound of chains dragging across dead leaves. Like something massive being pulled through the underbrush. The temperature plummeted so quickly I could see their breath crystallising in the moonlight. The wine in their bottle froze solid, the glass cracking with a sharp ping.

 

The door didn't just open - it was torn from its hinges. He stood there, the Judge, all two metres of him, his feathered hat brushing the doorframe. Those eyes... imagine absinthe mixed with corpse-light. His coat seemed to shift and writhe in patterns that hurt my eyes to look at.

 

"Guilty..."

 

The word seemed to echo from a thousand throats at once. The anchor at the end of his chain moved faster than I could track. When it struck the young man's head, the sound... bloody hell, it was like a watermelon being dropped onto concrete, but worse. So much worse. I watched his skull cave in, fragments of bone mixing with... other things. His body twitched, fingers scrabbling at the floorboards, leaving bloody trails.

 

The girl tried to scream, but that ashen hand caught her throat. It was the colour of old gravestones, and I swear I could see movement under the skin, like worms writhing beneath the surface. Then those other hands appeared, growing from his shoulders like some hideous fungus. Three withered things, each clutching their tools.

 

The scissors made a wet snicking sound as they severed her windpipe. I could hear the cartilage being snipped, like someone cutting through thick rubber bands. The chisel... Christ, I could hear her skull crack like an egg, see the fragments sink into the soft tissue beneath. And the saw... the sound it made as it worked through flesh and bone... like a rusty gate being opened in hell.

 

I woke up drenched in sweat, my laptop's battery dead. The room was freezing, and I could smell something metallic in the air. When I checked the floor where the couple had... in my dream... I found dark stains in the wood that looked disturbingly fresh.

 

The next day, I tried to convince myself it was just a nightmare brought on by the locals' stories. I spent the morning in the village library, researching the forest's history. The elderly librarian, Mrs. Pembroke, seemed unusually interested in my research.

 

"Looking up the old stories, are you?" she asked, bringing me a stack of local newspapers. "About the Judge?"

 

I nodded, and she glanced around before continuing. "My sister's boy... he was one of them that disappeared. 1987 it was. They found his shoes by that cabin, but nothing else. Never did find his body."

 

\[Part 3\]

 

The newspapers told a grim story. Over three decades, twenty-seven people had vanished in the forest. The only connection? They'd all been last seen near the cabin. The most recent case was just six months ago - a poacher caught setting illegal traps.

 

That night, I had another dream. Or perhaps 'nightmare' isn't quite the right word. It felt too real, too visceral.

 

The poacher was counting his snares when the temperature dropped. Frost crept across the cabin's windows like skeletal fingers. The chains scraped across the forest floor, and I noticed something disturbing - the sound wasn't just getting closer, it was coming from multiple directions, as if the chains were circling the cabin.

 

When the Judge appeared this time, I noticed new details. His coat... the patterns weren't sewn in at all. They were moving, shifting, like faces trying to push through the fabric. Faces contorted in agony.

 

The poacher tried to run. Fool. The anchor caught his leg, shattering his knee with a sound like branches breaking in winter. He screamed - God, how he screamed - as the Judge dragged him back.

 

Those three withered hands emerged from the Judge's shoulders, but this time, I saw the process in horrific detail. The skin split like overripe fruit, yellow fluid seeping out as the hands pushed through. Each finger unfurled like a blooming corpse flower.

 

The scissors took his fingers first, one by one, like pruning dead twigs. Snip. Snip. Snip. The chisel... it worked methodically, tapping through joints and ligaments with surgical precision. The saw... it started at his ankles, and... Christ, I can still hear his pleas for mercy.

 

I woke to find my notebook filled with drawings I didn't remember making. Detailed sketches of the Judge, of his victims, of those damned hands. The pages were damp, though not with water. They smelled of copper.

 

Over the next few days, I tried to leave. I really did. But each time I packed my bags, something drew me back. The dreams kept coming, each more vivid than the last:

 

A pair of thieves dividing their spoils.

A drunk driver who'd fled the scene of an accident.

A man who'd abandoned his family.

 

Each night, the Judge found them. Each night, I watched. And each morning, I found more evidence that these weren't just dreams. Bloodstains that appeared and disappeared. Scratches in the wood that weren't there before. Once, I found a single feather from his hat, black as sin and cold as death.

 

I started researching the Judge himself. In the village records, I found something interesting. In 1888, a circuit judge had died in these woods. He'd been known for his harsh sentences, for finding guilt where others saw innocence. They found his body hanging from a tree, surrounded by the families of those he'd condemned.

 

But here's the detail that chills me: around his neck was an iron chain, and in his hands were three tools - scissors, a chisel, and a saw.

 

The librarian had more to share. "They say," she whispered, "that before each execution he ordered, he'd whisper 'guilty' in a voice that made even the guards shiver. And his eyes... witnesses said they glowed with an unholy green light."

 

I should have left then. Should have run as far as I could. But I had to know more. Had to understand.

 

 

Last night, everything changed. I'd fallen asleep at my desk, researching as usual, when something woke me. Not a dream this time. The temperature in the cabin had dropped so low that my breath came out in white clouds. My laptop screen frosted over, then died.

 

That's when I noticed - the chains weren't just in my dreams anymore. I could hear them dragging through the leaves outside, that horrible scraping sound coming from all directions. But there was something else too, something I'd never heard in my dreams: whispers. Dozens of voices, maybe hundreds, all speaking at once in a language I couldn't understand.

 

The voices grew louder, and I realised with horror that they were coming from the Judge's coat. All those shifting patterns... they were faces. The faces of his victims, trapped in the fabric, endlessly whispering their pleas for mercy.

 

"Guilty..."

 

The word froze the blood in my veins. He was here, standing in the doorway, larger than I remembered. Those poison-green eyes fixed on me, and I understood something terrible - he'd known I was watching. All those dreams, all those executions... he'd been performing them for me. Drawing me in. Making me complicit.

 

The ashen hand reached for me, and I saw what I hadn't noticed before - it bore a wedding ring. The same ring I'd seen on the hand of that judge in the old photographs from 1888.

 

His other hands emerged, those twisted things clutching their tools. But this time, I saw what the tools really were - not metal at all, but bone. Human bone, fashioned into instruments of torture.

 

I ran. Through the back window, into the forest. The chains followed, scraping through the undergrowth like serpents. Every direction I turned, I heard them. The whispers grew louder, became screams.

 

I found myself back at the cabin. Of course. You can't escape the Judge. Not when he's decided you're guilty.

 

And I am guilty, aren't I? I watched. Night after night, I watched his executions. Took notes. Drew pictures. Never tried to help. Never tried to stop him. Just observed, like some damned voyeur of violence.

 

It's 3:17 AM now. I'm huddled under the bed in this bloody cabin, typing this on my mobile. 7% battery left. The temperature's dropping rapidly - I can see frost forming on the floorboards. The chains are getting closer.

 

The whispers are back. I can make out words now: "Watch... Watch like you watched us..."

 

Footsteps outside. That word again.

 

"Guilty..."

 

The door's opening. I can see his polished shoes by the bed. The chains are scraping across the floor, and... bloody hell, is that an ashen hand reaching under the bed? The fingers are bent all wrong, like broken twigs, and they're reaching for my...
