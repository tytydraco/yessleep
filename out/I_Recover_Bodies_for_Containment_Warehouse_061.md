It’s twelve hours after clean-up and I just want caffeine, but I can’t bring myself to take a sip. I swish the coffee around my Styrofoam cup and try not to think of the barrel.



This is a two-man job. I need Al, but no one is telling me where he is, and I’m beginning to think they don’t either.



My line of work isn’t for the soft-hearted. Compartmentalization only helps so much. Eventually, the wall breaks, and it all floods through like a river rushing through your skull.



I want to quit. But there’s only one way out: to disappear.

  
\*

The catheter rested against my thigh like a warm tick. Wearing one was mandatory; there were no bathroom breaks.



I was issued a basic Type-C hazmat suit, which offered little assurance for my safety. Al mentioned once how he’d been talking to a guy one second, and the next his face mask was a curtain of red. The guards hadn’t properly secured the entity and it still had some withering clutch of life. Anyway, they needed the position filled, and that’s how I got my job.



The room I was assigned today didn’t house an entity. I hadn’t cleaned an entity room before, and I didn’t want my first time to be without Al. They were the messiest and where most incidents happened. But today was strange, because rather than the typical room the ticket listed: *breakroom.*



I’d only been working as a Cleaner for 6 months, but I worked in the data entry department for two years. Things like this didn’t happen in the staff quarters. They were safe areas—Normal areas—at least as normal as we all pretended. Departments are so siloed; only a few key executives at the top of the chain have an understanding of what really goes on. Still, there are whispers. Co-workers gossip. News stations get a hold of leaks. I keep my head down and tell myself it’ll all crumble eventually, with or without me.



Waiting for me was a mousy gentleman with a fro of black hair. His lab coat was absolutely splattered with brown specks that looked like motor oil. He held a clipboard with a stack of white papers.



“Excuse me, are you here for the report?” he asked nervously.



I lifted my mop from the bucket. “I’m just the cleaner, but maybe you can help me. How many bodies is it?”



“Uh—no bodies. The sprinkler system activated and sprayed this filthy water everywhere.”



Becher, as his nametag read, kept glancing down nervously at the stack of papers. If this were a simple sprinkler malfunction, he’d have no reason to stand guard. The forms would be scanned in and sent to WH&S.



“And what do you say?” I asked.



“Oh yeah—it definitely smells dirty, so I wouldn’t be surprised if it were only backed up water.”



I knew better than to pry information out of a white coat. While they weren’t privy to all details, they generally held a higher security clearance. Getting information out of them though was like prying teeth. They got off on it, and would smugly smile and tell us not to worry about it.



I continued wheeling the mop and bucket down the hall, wondering if I’d need to bring the hose instead.



“Wait,” Becher called from behind me. “Before you go in there.”



Curious, I turned my attention back to him. “If you want to chat, I’ll lend you a mop, but I got to get started on this.”



“I could hear something in the pipes. Before the sprinkler system activated. The pipes were shaking, and it sounded like grains pouring out of a silo.”



“Broken pipes tend to be make sounds.”



“I’ve been hearing that sound all month.” Almost as soon as he said it, Becher covered his mouth with the clipboard.



“What are you trying to say?”



“I’m not trying to say anything. Just—watch out for yourself, okay? We don’t need to lose any more cleaners.”



Becher hurried away from the scene. I don’t think I’d seen him here before. There are only about 500 employees at the company, and moving around the building the whole day I’d met most. As you’d guess it’s quite cliquey and people usually only chat with people who share the same security clearance.



It wasn’t until I was pushing my cart through the breakroom doors that I fully registered what Becher had said. *We don’t need to lose any more cleaners?* Surely he couldn’t be referring to the guy before me. If Al were here, he’d be able to shed some light on it for me.



The breakroom was covered in brown, like something had exploded from the pipes. I pinched my nose to block the foul smell; a sweet, bitter stench like perforated bowels.



I started with the walls, since they were the easiest to do, covering large sections with the mop. I don’t know what they planned to do about the smell other than let the ventilation do its job. It’s called a warehouse but 90% of the building is underground. We didn’t exactly get fresh air.



At some point another white coat who looked like Colonel Sanders wandered in and just stood there drinking coffee from his mug and watching me work. I fucking hated it when they did that. I didn’t need them watching over my shoulder. It’s not *relevant* to their clearance level.



Usually, this work was left for the janitors—the normal ones. Al and I’s work was more often than not recovering dead bodies and cleaning the aftermath. With the bodies, we had to melt them in barrels. We were told this was to “remove any trace” of an entity or object. Really, what it was was a cover-up. Not even their families knew the full truth of what happened to them.



There was nothing dangerous about the breakroom, and yet I couldn’t stop thinking about what Becher had told me. *Lose any more cleaners. Sounds in the pipes.* The whole damn place was rotting.



After finishing cleaning the floor, I noticed a brown puddle had reformed. One of the pipes was still leaking. I went back to the storeroom and collected the ladder. I had the ceiling to do anyway.



The ladder was six meters tall. I could have really used an extra set of hands to secure it, but I climbed up anyway. When I was closer, I noticed the pipe wasn’t just leaking but also disconnected from its joining piece, leaving one end exposed to the breakroom. I grabbed my torch and shined it inside.



I wasn’t sure what part of the body I saw first, but I knew exactly what I was looking at when I saw the eyeball.



I reeled back—I felt the ladder move out from under me.



And like before all head injuries, I shouted.



“Fuck!”
