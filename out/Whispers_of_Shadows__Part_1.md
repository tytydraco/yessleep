This old dusty thing never moved, it sat on the mantle proudly, always watching us as grandma used to say, with its leather falling off and horrifically worn at the spine, its features constantly got me fascinated by the book, yet my mother warned me about it, never to touch it but always to have it there.

Throughout my life, my Grandma had amassed a collection of peculiar items—voodoo dolls, possessed artifacts, intricately arranged sigils—you name it. Most of these strange relics were off-limits to me, but the book, even with its eerie leather cover, captivated my curiosity the most. 
My mother would tell me tales of the horrific knowledge it contained, things no human should ever know. Our family was entrusted with it not to read, but to safeguard, passing it down through generations as a protective measure.

She recounted how, at nineteen, just a week after her mother passed the book to her, she’d tried to open it. She managed to read only a single sentence before Grandma scolded her mercilessly. My mother warned me she would do the same if I dared to pry into its pages.

The thought of the horrors that might lie within fills me with dread, yet the anticipation of owning such a forbidden artifact is a thrill of its own.

Soon, I would turn nineteen and inherit the book myself! My ma insisted we must follow a sacred ceremony to transfer the book and its “spirits” into my possession. While I don’t truly believe in such nonsense, I was willing to humor her for the sake of keeping the peace.

At breakfast today, she offered her only warning regarding the book, recalling a fragment of the sentence she had managed to read years ago: “When all seems right, heed my call for it signals—”

Signals? Signals what? I was at a loss—maybe my mother’s memory was fading; after all, she was nearing retirement and such a sentence being the first line seems, outdated to say the least? I mean cmon, Is this the 1600’s?

You might wonder who in their right mind would trust a 19-year-old with such an artifact. Hell, i sure do… Seems a bit stupid to leave it to me, I got to be worrying about college, not some dumb book, it’s not going to sprout legs and run off now is it?

But our family has a peculiar affinity with the number three; everything revolves around it. 
As Grandma would say, “Maiden, Mother, Crone. Perfect things always come in threes; otherwise, Hecate would have made more.” 
Even our birthdays fall in March, June, September, or December (mine is on March 9). Strangely, everyone in the family seems to die in multiples of three—Grandma passed at 72. Perhaps there’s significance to this, or maybe we’re just a bunch of misfits; I can’t make sense of it.

But enough of my ramblings; back to the matter at hand.

The ceremony I must perform is deemed “super sacred” to our family. Grandma was notoriously superstitious, maintaining a salt ring around our property to ward off “ill-tempered beings.” This ring is the most expensive maintenance on our land; it can’t just be regular table salt or rock salt. According to Grandma and my mother, the weather’s temperament means it wouldn’t last long. Table salt would break in a gentle breeze, while rock salt would wash away in the rain. So, we use salt geodes, which are a hassle to produce, but we ensure we always have plenty on hand, making more when supplies run low.

Unfortunately, today is my day to inspect the circle and replace the salt geodes in time for the upcoming ceremony. Honestly, this is the worst chore I have besides cleaning the cat litter. The wheelbarrow we use for transporting the crystals has a wonky wheel, and out of sheer stubbornness, my mother refuses to replace it, insisting it builds character. That was three years ago, and I gave up asking for a new one after my sixteenth birthday.

After breakfast, I dashed upstairs to change into my working clothes, leaving my messy room behind. As I came downstairs, my mother shot me "the look"—the one that said, “If you mess this up, you’re dead meat.” I shrugged it off and headed through the kitchen to the garage. “And don’t forget to report—” Same old, same old, I thought. “—if you see anything unusual.” Every time? Must she tell me every single time? Im not a kid anymore… “Yes, Mom, I get it.” Haven’t you got anything else to do? Tarot readings or something equally boring to be messing with today? We have customers waiting weeks and not a thing has been done to fix it. 
She followed me into the garage, but I tuned her out by putting in my earphones, MP3 player, and making sure my phone is in my pocket. 
Yep, you read that right—an MP3 player old school, i know! 
My dad gave it to me on my twelfth birthday before he disappeared.

He was on scout duty that day to replace the circle, and I haven’t seen him since, so I hold onto this old device as a reminder of him. Grabbing the wheelbarrow, I stepped outside, feeling a strange unease in the air, but I shrugged it off as its literally the crack of dawn, ain’t nothing wrong with a bit of cold at 8am, i think it’d be crazy if it were super warm right?

I set off toward the first checkpoint, the farthest from the house, requiring a trek through the clearing and past the overgrown trees my mother refuses to pay to have removed. It’s only a five-to-ten-minute walk, depending on your pace, but today, it felt like an eternity.

Finally, I arrived at the first checkpoint. Nothing seemed amiss—just a few smaller geodes worn down from winter. I figured I should replace them, just in case otherwise ma would be on my ass again about being disrespectful of the circle. 
So I got to work, carefully nudging the old geodes away their places while gently settling the new ones around them, ensuring the circle remained intact. The old geodes went into a bucket hanging from the wheelbarrow's handle like they always did. 

Satisfied with my work, I turned to head to the second checkpoint, hoping not to find too much to replace; my wheelbarrow was only half full, and I wasn’t keen on lugging it back and forth all day.

Five minutes later, I reached the second checkpoint. This one was my favorite, mostly because of the view. It sat near a small beck, the water shimmering like glass in the sunlight, almost captivating the way it dances and waves, god i should go for a dip again when the weather warms up shouldn’t I? If only Mom would let me buy a decent camera, I could capture the beauty of this place. 
I scanned the surrounding geodes and found a few that needed replacing and got to work. As I approached the last of the second checkpoint, I noticed something that made my heart sink. One of the rocks had been shattered, pieces scattered away from the circle.

Pulling out my phone, I dialed my mom’s number. It didn’t ring the first time, nor the second. Maybe she was busy or preoccupied with something else. Finally, on my third attempt, she answered—her voice booming through the speaker. “WHAT IS IT? I’M TRYING TO READ THIS BOOK, AND IT’S AT THE BEST PART, CHILD!”

“Mom, you might want to come here. I’m at checkpoint two, and one of the rocks is, well, wrecked. It’s been moved out of the circle, and—”

She cut me off. “Just replace it and get back to work! It’s almost noon!” I couldn’t believe it. She always told me to call if I noticed anything strange, yet here she was, dismissing me.

“Okay, Mom, I’ll be home soon.” I hung up and sighed, following her advice. I picked up the remnants of the old geode and replaced it with a larger one. Slightly satisfied given the circumstances, I made my way to the last checkpoint.

Checkpoint three wasn’t as scenic as checkpoint two, but it had its own charm. Located in the southwest of our land, it bordered a meadow, which would soon burst into bloom. As I walked through the first part of this circles section, I noticed everything appeared in order—no geodes needed replacing. At least that was one worry off my mind.

Continuing along the perimeter, I suddenly felt something was off. about midway through, I noticed the rocks had been disturbed, scattered haphazardly from their positions. This wasn’t giving me a good gut feeling, but I hesitated to call my mom again. Maybe I should check further before bugging her. 
God knows she would kill me if i ruined another book of hers, they always end the same though so i don’t really see the point… hero comes in, saves the girl, girl falls in love with him… or some variation thereof… and they all live happily ever after *yaaaay*

After spending 5 minutes convincing myself that I could handle this, I pressed on, the gut feeling only getting worse from there.
That was when I stumbled upon something I truly wished I hadn’t seen. A trail of blood marred the outline of the remaining geodes, interrupted by two lifeless animals lying nearby. My stomach churned at the sight.

I knew I had to call my mom this time. I pulled out my phone, hands trembling as I waited for her to answer again.

Thats odd, it rang off until i got to voicemail?
Whats ma doing? This never happens..

Where is she?
