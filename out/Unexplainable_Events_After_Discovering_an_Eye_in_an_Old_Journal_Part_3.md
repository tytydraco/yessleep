Another night filled with creepy, unsettling sounds keeps me wide awake. My nightlight is on, but I can't decide which is worse: the scary shadows that the light makes dance on my walls, or the idea of turning it off and being in complete darkness. Either way, my imagination is running wild with fright. As if that wasn't enough, the creepy creature on my roof is back. I can hear it walking around, stopping now and then like it's listening for something—or someone. It's right above my room, and it seems to know I'm here.

Bravely, I try to get out of bed to go to the bathroom. But as I start walking, the creature on the roof seems to hear me. It makes a heavy thumping sound, moving closer to where I am. That's it—I rush back to bed as fast as my legs can carry me. Just when I dive under my covers, I hear a loud thud right above me, on the roof. It's like the creature knows exactly where I am, and it's waiting. 

It's tracking me at night, and the reason remains a maddening mystery. It's like it's surveilling me, watching my every move. Even more unsettling, it positions itself just out of sight from any of my windows, as if it knows the exact angles from which I could possibly see it. But maybe that's a small mercy; I'm haunted by the thought that catching even a fleeting glimpse of this creature could unveil a horror so grotesque that it would scar my soul for a lifetime.

While watching the news, a segment comes on that chills me to my very core. They report an eerie phenomenon sweeping through the area: a sudden and unexplained surge in miscarriages that has left the medical community baffled. But what makes this even more nightmarish is the discovery they share next. Upon examination, some of the unborn babies have been found without hearts, as if they'd been surgically removed. Fear is spreading like wildfire through the community. Speculation runs rampant, with theories ranging from tainted water supplies to some other form of environmental poison.

Yet, deep in the pit of my stomach, I feel it's something far more malevolent. My relative had once whispered tales of a Manananggal—a vile creature from folklore known for its shape-shifting abilities and hunger for human flesh. And now, I can't shake off the sickening thought that perhaps, just perhaps, this creature might be responsible for the horrors plaguing our community.This naturally raised a haunting question in my mind: what is the connection between the eerie eye portrait and the cryptic journal to the unsettling events plaguing our area?

Ignoring my mother's wishes to keep those items secured in her room, I surreptitiously retrieve them and begin to do some research on my laptop. My fingers fly across the keys as I try to translate snippets of Tagalog text from the mysterious journal.

Just then, a soft but urgent knock echoes at my door. My mother's face appears in the doorway, etched with a mixture of concern and fear. Her eyes immediately dart to the journal lying beside my computer, and then to the open screen displaying my attempts to decode its ominous passages. Before I can even utter a word in my defense, her expression turns to one of anger and foreboding. 'You need to stop this,' she warns, her voice tinged with a chilling finality. 'You're making things worse. All these hauntings, they're happening because you can't leave well enough alone.'

Something deep in my gut churns uneasily, making me question my mother's sudden defensiveness about the journal. Could I be reading too much into this? Then again, her initial reluctance to even discuss the journal flashes back into my mind. She was inexplicably brief when I first asked her for a translation, tersely warning me to 'not look at it, nor think about it.'

The more I ponder, the more unsettled I become. Maybe it's time to seek out another perspective, someone who might provide additional clues. My thoughts drift to Uncle Edwin. He was close to Aunt Rosita, the journal's original owner who has since passed away. Maybe he holds the keys to this looming enigma. I resolve to reach out to him, hoping he can shed some light on the growing shadows that cloud my life.

As the sun dips below the horizon, a sense of dread engulfs me. Nightfall is coming, and with it, the return of that accursed creature that prowls above my bedroom. I've tried telling my Mom about the nightly terror that unfolds while she sleeps soundly, unaware. Yet, she insists that I should try to put it out of my mind. 'Don't think about it,' she keeps saying. Easier said than done, Mom. How can I not think about it when this fiendish entity is practically hovering right above me, separated only by the thin barrier of my ceiling?

In the interim, I'm determined to dig deeper into the lore surrounding the Manananggal. I'm desperate to uncover a vulnerability, a chink in its armor, anything that might offer me some semblance of protection should it decide to breach the sanctuary of my home. I'm on a race against time, diving into obscure texts and scrolling through online forums, hoping to arm myself with knowledge before it's too late. If anyone out there knows more about this abominable creature, please, I urge you, reach out to me!
