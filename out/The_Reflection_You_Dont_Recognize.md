I’m typing this on my phone because my laptop isn’t safe anymore. My name’s Sam, and if you’re reading this, you’ve probably looked in a mirror today. Maybe you caught something weird—a flicker, a shadow, a face that wasn’t quite right. Maybe you laughed it off. I did too, until it got me. Now I’m warning you: it’s coming for you next.  
  
  
  
It started three weeks ago. I was brushing my teeth, staring into my bathroom mirror, when I saw it. My reflection blinked a second after I did. I froze, toothpaste dripping down my chin, but it was back to normal so fast I thought I’d imagined it. Stress, I told myself—too many late nights at work. The next morning, though, it happened again. This time, my reflection smiled when I didn’t. A slow, cold smirk that made my stomach drop.

I stayed away from the mirror all day, but that night, I heard it. A faint tapping—like fingernails on glass—coming from the bathroom. I crept down the hall, peeked inside, and saw nothing but my empty reflection. The tapping didn’t stop, though. It got louder, more insistent, like something was trying to claw its way out.

By day three, it wasn’t just the bathroom. My phone screen flickered with shadows that didn’t match my movements. The kitchen window showed a hand reaching when mine was still. The fridge’s shiny surface reflected eyes darting where mine stayed fixed. I started covering everything—towels over mirrors, paper taped over my webcam—but the noises followed. Tapping turned to scratching, then pounding, rattling the walls at night.

I called my friend Jen, begging her to come over. She checked the mirrors, saw nothing weird. “You need sleep, Sam,” she said, but her eyes lingered on me too long. “You look… off.” I glanced at the hallway mirror. My face was pale, eyes sunken, but that wasn’t it. My reflection’s hair was parted on the wrong side. I don’t part my hair.

That night, I woke up at 3:13 a.m. to a whisper. Not in the room—inside my skull. “Let me in, Sam. It’s cold out here.” I shot out of bed, sweating, but the apartment was silent. Then it came again, closer: “I’m already halfway through.”

I stumbled to the bathroom, splashed water on my face, and looked up. My reflection wasn’t me anymore. It was something—wearing my skin, eyes too wide, grin too sharp. It raised a hand, and my arm lifted too, like a puppet on strings. “See?” it hissed, in the mirror and in my head. “We’re almost one.”

I smashed the mirror with my fist, glass cutting deep, blood pooling in the sink. But the pounding didn’t stop—it spread. Windows, screens, every shiny surface thrummed with it. I tried to run, but the front door just opened back into my hallway, like reality had folded in on itself.

Then I saw it: a full-length mirror in my living room, one I’d never bought. The glass was dark, almost black, and my reflection was already there, waiting. It stepped closer, hands pressed against the surface, and I felt the air crackle. The whisper turned to a scream: “You looked too long, Sam. Now I’m coming through.”

I swung a chair at it, but the glass didn’t break—it pushed back, solid as steel. My reflection laughed, and my mouth twisted into the same grin. My thoughts started slipping, replaced by something cold and empty. I clawed at my face, trying to fight it, but it was too late.

Now, my fingers type this on their own. My reflection’s here, smiling through the screen, watching you read this. It’s not trapped in my mirrors anymore—it’s in yours. Every glance at your phone, your laptop, your window, it’s there, waiting for you to notice.

Look at your reflection. Is it really you? Does it blink when you do, or smile when you don’t? If you see it move wrong, it’s already got you. You’ve looked too long, and it’s coming through.
