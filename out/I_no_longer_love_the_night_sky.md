Have you ever gone camping before? If so, I’d wager you’ve sat back admiring the stars on a clear night. I certainly used to. I’d lie inside my tent with the rain cover off, staring off into the night sky. I loved those clear, dark nights when all the cosmos seemed to show itself just for me. Now I never look up into the nighttime sky while camping. 

	

It all changed during a camping trip during the crisp early winter. Around where I live, it doesn’t really get too cold until January or February, so it was perfect weather for camping. A group of my buddies and I decided to go camping during Christmas break. It was going to be a short trip consisting of four days and three nights at a nearby state park. Excitement buzzed among our group, especially from those who had never been camping before. We joked about how we should search for Bigfoot and bring back proof of his existence. If only that’s what we encountered in those woods. 



Since only Sam and I had gone camping before, we were designated as the leaders. In total, there were five of us going on the trip. Chris would drive us to the park, Jake and Ernest would bring food and essentials, while Sam and I would bring the outdoor equipment. With our supplies delegated, we felt prepared for our adventure.



The day after Christmas break started, we were on our way to the state park. Being packed in like sardines didn’t dampen our mood as we listened to music and headed to our camping trip. Once we got to the park and found a spot for the car, we started lugging our supplies into the forest to search for a campsite. We found a relatively secluded area that was perfect for our group. Sam and I started setting up the tent we would all stay in while the rest of the group started unpacking our supplies. Ernest inspected our ice cooler to make sure there was still enough, during which Jake and Chris gathered firewood to create a campfire. The sun started to dip behind the treeline as we finished setting up camp. As dusk settled, Chris set to work cooking our dinner of SPAM tacos. Once we had devoured our dinner, we sat back, relaxing while taking in the surrounding nature. I told a couple of campfire stories, the typical fare of bumps in the night, and so forth. It was after my story of the Look-Around finished when Jake suggested that we should have s’mores. We all agreed this was a brilliant idea and went ahead making them. Ernest burned his first couple while Sam melted his chocolate a little too much, resulting in a sticky mess. We all laughed at these mishaps; we were having a great time and that was all that mattered.



After staying by the campfire for a little while longer, we decided to call it a night. We had a long day of hiking planned and didn’t want to get a late start. As we lay in our sleeping bags, we kept up with some idle chit-chat. I told them to be quiet for a second. Once the last word died in the darkness, all was silent. The silence lasted only for a brief moment before the chatter of the forest took over. It was a soothing melody of rustling leaves, owls hooting in the distance, and the chirping of crickets amongst the myriad of other nighttime sounds. Jake looked up towards the clear sky and pointed it out to us, expressing his astonishment at how many stars he could see. We all stared upwards, admiring the beauty of the unadulterated night sky. After a few minutes of gazing at the stars, Chris broke the silence with a question. It was a question that had never occurred to me in all my time of camping. The question was rhetorical, for we all knew the answer as soon as he asked it.



“If we can see outside, doesn’t that mean something could look inside?” Chris asked softly. 



The question seemed to create an oppressive silence between us. In an attempt to lighten the mood, I jokingly said, “Well we better watch out for Mr. Creeperman then”.



 Jake started laughing at the absurdity of the name. The laughter spread and we soon forgot about the unease that settled upon our tent moments earlier. A gust of cold wind signaled it was time to bundle up and get some shuteye. We all eventually drifted off to sleep listening to the forest’s symphony.



I woke up shortly after daybreak and quickly found a tree to water. Once finished, I returned to the campsite and set about reigniting the campfire we had put out the night before. As I was coaxing a small ember to ignite the tinder next to it, Sam appeared beside me. He greeted me with a slap on my back, causing me to drop the little ember. I returned his greeting with some choice words before turning my attention to see if the ember survived. It had, to my relief, and with a small flash, the tinder erupted into flame. After a few minutes, the campfire started growing into a respectable blaze. I then grabbed the egg carton and started making fried eggs for everyone. Jake was next to emerge from the tent, enticed from his warm sleeping bag by the smell of breakfast. He was soon followed by the other two, who groggily made their way to the campfire. We gathered around the fire and talked about Chris’ new girlfriend while we ate. Chris wasn’t too amused by this topic and quickly changed it to the hike close at hand.



We all looked forward to it as it was a 20-mile trek around the forest. The trail was laid out in a rough semi-circle shape that officially started closer to the regular campgrounds. The trailhead was off to the side, past a small patch of trees, so it was harder to find without knowing it was there. The lake was on the last quarter of the trail and had a small picnic area nearby. Most people used the trail’s exit to get to the lake since it was easier to find and was closer to the lake. While it wasn’t a main hiking trail, it was still managed by the local rangers who walked it occasionally. 



Once we finished breakfast and cleaned up the camp, we stowed our food and other belongings inside our tent until we came back from the hike. I made sure the campfire was out and announced the start of our expedition. Our initial pace wasn’t fast, but neither were we going for a stroll. A small wooden stake with the mile number denoted every mile carved into it. It was around the 5th marker that we took a short rest. We found a fallen tree off the trail a few yards and sat down. I took a quick gulp of water while Ernest handed us some granola bars from his bag. That morning, we had designated who was going to carry what in their bags. I was carrying our water bottles and some towels along with the knife I strapped to my leg. Ernest handled our snack supply and trash while Jake and Chris carried our lunches. Sam’s backpack contained the first aid kit and some other emergency supplies. We sat there for a little while, eating our snacks and resting. Once we finished our snacks, we put the trash in Ernest’s bag and continued down the trail. We made small talk as we progressed along the trail. 



After a while, we saw the first person since we started the trip. He was an elderly man but seemed well accustomed to the trail. As we passed each other, we exchanged some pleasantries and moved on. Once we left earshot, Chris made a comment about how we had found Mr. Creeperman. I shook my head, smirking, while some of the others laughed. Around noon, we arrived at the 11th marker when we decided to take a break for lunch. We had packed some sandwiches and chips to eat for our lunch. I sat down on the ground and leaned against a tree as I gratefully ate my lunch. The trees were densely packed in this part of the forest, which cast a dim shade. Their pine needles were a vibrant green against the backdrop of the blue sky. The sunlight that filtered through the leaves cast odd shadows on the forest floor. I watched a couple of squirrels run around in the trees above us and relaxed for a bit. We probably spent 15 minutes resting our bodies before I finally got up and motioned to the rest of the group to start on the trail once again.



Our progress was slower than when we had set out that morning, but we trudged onward. The sun traveled across the sky, moving ever downward across the horizon. We reached the 18th-mile marker as the sun was starting its descent. Ernest was the most affected by the hike and lagged behind a short distance. Sam suggested we take a short break to drink up and have our last snack. Jake and Chris wanted to keep going, but I agreed with Sam. So with the vote being 3 to 2, we stopped and took a break. I ate and drank, finishing my last bit of water. I put it back in my backpack with a soft sigh. Ernest was the first to get up and start walking again. He told us we were burning daylight and should hurry up. He also decided it would be wise to taunt Chris, saying he could reach camp before him. Chris jumped up and started running at Ernest. This gave Ernest a fright, with him flinching as Chris ran past, calling him some interesting names. Ernest quietly swore under his breath and started to jog, albeit haphazardly, after him. Jake was quick to follow the two, saying he would make sure they got back to camp alright. I let out a small laugh and helped Sam up, telling him we shouldn’t let them get too far ahead or they might get lost. Sam and I started back upon the trail with a brisk pace after the others.



Sam and I got back to camp just as the sun began to set. Jake had started cooking dinner while Ernest collapsed in a nearby chair. Chris was gathering some firewood when he noticed us, waving at us. We had our dinner of campfire burgers and sodas in relative quiet. All of us were pretty tired from the hike that day and didn’t want to stay up very late. Once we had eaten our fill, Sam put out the fire and Chris packed up the remaining food. We clamored into our tent and got into our sleeping bags. There was some chit-chat for a little while, but most of the guys were asleep within ten minutes.



Then it was just me awake, alone, to revisit the events of the day. I smiled as I recalled our hike and found myself staring up at the night sky once again. I scanned the sky, admiring the Milky Way, when I noticed two bright stars. I couldn't remember seeing them the previous night, but thought I might have just missed them. As I inspected the two stars, I noticed they didn’t seem to flicker like other stars. I then thought I remembered a news article talking about how some planets were going to be visible during this month. I was about to wake up my friends to show them the planets when I saw them vanish as if snuffed out of existence. I rubbed my weary eyes, thinking they were playing a trick on me, and opened them again to see the stars had returned. Although, they felt closer than before. I continued to stare at them when I felt a sense of unease come over me. The stars, or whatever they were, seemed to be focused on me. The moment I realized that a gust of cold wind ripped through the tent, causing me to shudder, grasping my sleeping bag close. I looked back to where the stars had been just moments ago but saw nothing. I stared at that empty space before determining they were gone for good this time. I turned over, pulling my sleeping bag over my head as I had done the previous night. Although this time I did so to try and hide from the pair of brilliant white stars. 



Restful sleep eluded me most of the night, so after a while, I decided to just get up for the day. I reignited the campfire with more ease than last morning’s attempt. In the shadows of twilight, the flames danced and sputtered, creating shades at the edge of the campfire’s light. I tried to ignore the shades moving at the corners of my eyes, telling myself it was just the fire creating an optical illusion. To distract myself, I focused on the mesmerizing dance of the flames, grateful for their warmth as a cold breeze swept through the camp.



I must have drifted off at some point because I woke to Sam throwing a log on the fire which had gone down to smolder. He asked me why I was sleeping out here and I simply responded that I had trouble sleeping. He shrugged in acknowledgment and kept building up the fire. Sam took out some eggs and sausage so he could make us some breakfast when I asked him a question. I asked if he had looked at the night sky before we went to sleep last night. He looked up at me and replied that he had. Sam told me that he was gazing up and taking in the beauty as he drifted to sleep. He also noted that right before he fell asleep, he noticed two bright stars in a field of dimmer ones. When he told me that, I shuddered involuntarily. I thought it wise to not say anything since I still didn’t believe it myself, so I just told him I saw them as well. 



After a little while, the rest of our group joined us at the campfire for breakfast. We scarfed down the eggs and sausage quickly. I was hungrier than I had thought I was. It seemed that the hike had taken out more of me and the rest of the guys as well. We didn’t have anything planned for today, so we were free to do whatever we wanted. Jake and Chris said they were going to head over to the lake and Ernest said he was going to hike another, albeit a much shorter, trail. Sam said he wanted to explore the woods around camp and I told him I would join him in a little while. So they all went off to do their things, leaving me to snuff out the fire. Once I had, I decided I wanted to check something. Trying to recall exactly where I saw the two eyes last night, I headed back to our tent. I looked up into the now clear morning sky and scanned the area where I saw the stars. There was nothing there. No tree branch, no vine stretching across, nothing but clear sky. The nearest tree was about 10 yards away and no tree branch extended even remotely close. My theory that the stars were actually the eyes of an owl seemed a little harder to accept after that.



I didn’t think I needed much else besides my knife to go exploring so I set off without any supplies. I also reasoned that Sam and I wouldn’t be going off too far from camp. I set out in the direction that Sam went off to earlier and found him after a half hour. Once he noticed me, he beckoned me over and showed me a small creek that he had discovered. As I walked over I heard the babble of the creek and I smiled when I saw the water flowing. We spent some time making little leaf boats and had them set sail downstream. My boat crashed into the bank about 30 feet down while Sam’s sank almost immediately. He shared a laugh at our poor boats’ failures before getting up and starting to explore once more. We followed the creek downstream, passing my stranded boat and continuing onward. We saw an abundance of wildlife as we explored. Birds flew from tree to tree, squirrels ran along the forest floor, and a rabbit or two darted between shrubs when we got too close. We even saw a doe jump in front of us and run off into a thicket. It was a cool experience. After a while, we agreed that we should head back and get some lunch as neither of us brought food so we turned back towards camp.



As the campsite was coming into view, we could see Ernest munching on a banana. Sam let out a loud moan and Ernest jumped up, nearly dropping the banana in the process. When he saw us approaching, he called us some rather rude names before quickly finishing his banana. We laughed at his attempt to insult us and grabbed some food. The three of us sat and had lunch, taking turns telling each other what we had done. Ernest told us about his short hike to the boulder clearing. Well, boulder is a strong word. Ernest described it as more like a big rock that was encircled by other smaller rocks. According to a sign at the trailhead, some loggers used that big rock as a landmark before the park was established. After the park was established and the hiking trail was cut, hikers started to leave small stones by the big rock. It became a tradition if it was your first time at the boulder to add a rock to the circle. I found this pretty neat and thought I might want to check it out later. 



We hung out for some time before we saw Chris and Jake appear from behind some trees. They seemed to be in good spirits and looked like they wanted to tell us something. Sam greeted the pair and tossed them their lunch. They ate as Jake told us of what happened to them earlier at the lake. The two of them arrived at the lake around an hour after they had left camp. The lake had a thin layer of mist covering its water. Chris commented how cool he thought it looked while Jake said he expected Jason Voorhees to emerge from the water any second. They watched over the water while they walked towards the picnic area. As they got closer to the picnic area, Jake’s attention turned towards a person sitting on a bench over there. He recognized the person as the old man we saw yesterday during our hike. The old man then noticed the two and waved at them in a welcoming gesture. Chris and Jake were slightly troubled by this elderly man being here all alone in the early morning, but they brushed the feeling away. They sat near the old man and started making small talk with him. The conversation moved from how the guys were doing to what brought them to the park. The conversation was pleasant enough and soon any feeling of strangeness from the old man disappeared. He was just a regular old man, alone in the woods. 



When the subject of Sam and me exploring off the trail came up, the man seemed a little worried. He asked them where we were exploring and Jake said he assumed it was near our campsite. The old man’s anxiety didn’t abate when Chris said where we had set camp. He warned them to tell us not to venture into the Dark Woods. When Jake asked for him to elaborate, all he added was to steer clear of an unusually dark patch of trees in the forest and always stay near the trail. With the warning given, he got up and started to walk down the hiking trail, toward the trailhead like the day before. His face cast a somber expression when he left as if he had recalled from a lifetime ago. Our friends looked at one another before coming to the same conclusion: a final adventure before we leave tomorrow. As Jake finished recounting this, he asked us for our input. The three of us agreed that this would be a fine last adventure to close out our camping trip. Sam chimed in that these dark woods might be where Bigfoot called home. This just made us more excited to find the dark woods. 



We set out away from camp back towards the trail from yesterday in search of the dark woods. Our group spread out about 100 yards from one another in a line to get a larger search area. We spent the afternoon searching, to no avail. There were some false finds, but they all turned out to be a bust. The patches were either too small for it to be considered “woods” or the darkness was temporary from a passing cloud. Once the sun had started to fade behind the treetops, we decided to call it a day and head back to camp. We arrived back at camp at dusk. Jake started preparing dinner while the rest of us discussed the plan to find the dark woods tomorrow. I suggested we head away from any trails. Sam thought this was a good idea and pulled out a map of the park that he had picked up on the first day. We marked out some areas of interest that were off the beaten trail. With a battle plan ready and dinner piping hot, we decided it was time to eat. We ate the Hamburger Helper and stated how disappointed we felt about having to leave tomorrow. After we finished off the last bits of dinner, we sat content around the campfire. We sang some songs and talked about going back to school the following week. 



After a while of this and once my stomach had stopped feeling like it would explode, I asked the group if we wanted dessert. The vote was unanimous, and I went to grab my supplies. I told them that instead of s’mores we were going to have snails. At that comment, Ernest let out a confused “huh” while the rest of the group questioned if they heard me right. Sam asked what I meant by that, but I told him to trust me and wait. I started preparing the snails while I said for the guys to grab a stick. They formed a line, sticks in hand, not knowing what concoction I was creating. Sam held out his stick, and I wrapped raw Pillsbury dough around it. I instructed him to hold it over the fire until he felt like it was done. The rest followed after him and I joined them once they all had theirs. I cooked mine to a golden brown while there was a variety from practically raw to nearly burnt from the rest of the group. Once they were finished cooking their snails, I ushered them over to where I had prepped the rest. I then showed how to finish the snail by dipping it into melted butter and then into cinnamon. Taking the gooey deliciousness and taking a bite, showing them how to properly enjoy it. At this, they quickly followed my lead and created their snails before swiftly eating them. They loved them. We made some more before running out after each person’s third snail. 



We stayed up a little longer, watching the campfire die out slowly. After the campfire was reduced to smoldering embers, we agreed it was time to retire for the night. The five of us crawled into our sleeping bags and drifted to sleep before long. 



I awoke suddenly. I listened for any noise that might have woken me up. I then opened my eyes and looked at where the stars had been the previous night, dreading what I might find. To my relief, they weren’t there. I kept looking around, searching for the pair, which I unfortunately did. They were in a different part of the sky than last night and were brighter as well, or were they closer? I stared, transfixed, at the two glowing white orbs. The surrounding sky seemed to darken as I gazed into the orbs. They were so bright and warm, safe even. With no warning, they vanished, seemingly snapping me out of my trance. I blinked a few times, trying to clear my mind before looking again. I noticed a subtle shimmer in the sky around where the stars had been, almost like a heat mirage off hot asphalt. Then the pair of stars appeared across the sky to where they had been the last time. I shuddered, confused about how they could move so quickly and silently. I was frozen in fright. I didn’t know if I should wake up my friends or not. I blinked and the orbs were gone when I opened my eyes. The cold night breeze going through our camp didn’t cause the chills that ran down my spine. I turned over, trying my best to trick myself into going to sleep.



The morning light penetrated our tent, glaring into my eyes. The sunlight woke me from my restless slumber. I tried to remember the pair of stars from last night and somewhat successfully convinced myself it was my mind playing tricks on me. After all, I was pretty tired from exploring and not getting enough sleep last night. The rest of the guys were already up and eating by the campfire when I left the tent. Chris heckled me a bit for sleeping in, to which I promptly ignored him. I sat down and joined them for breakfast. We went over our plan from yesterday. First, we would pack up our campsite and put it in Chris’ car before we started the search. Then we would split into two groups; Jake, Chris, and Ernest would search near the lake area while Sam and I would head deeper into the forest we explored before. 



We spent the next hour packing our things into Chris’ car and making sure we had what we needed for the search. We split the emergency supplies, food, and water between the two groups. I reached for my knife, making sure I still had it strapped to my leg. Each of us also brought a flashlight in case we needed it since a line of dark clouds was coming in from the north. After saying we would meet back at the car before dark, we split up, heading to our designated search areas. 



Sam and I were silent for most of the morning, focused on the search. We exchanged words when we suggested moving to another area or investigating something. By midday, the sun was obscured behind the dense layer of clouds. With their arrival, the temperature had dropped a few degrees, creating a chill in the air. Thankfully, my windbreaker was barely enough to keep the cold away. As we walked following a game trail, we started to notice that we weren’t seeing as many animals. The forest seemed to quiet, like after a fresh snowfall. However, there was no snow, just a subtle encroaching darkness. I looked at Sam and we nodded in agreement. This was the most promising lead we had found, but needed to confirm it was indeed the dark woods. The trees started to enclose around us, being more densely packed the further forward we went. With each step we took, the world lost a little more light. Our footsteps made no noise. My breath was the only thing I heard. I looked over at Sam to comment about the strangeness happening when I lost him. 



He should have been right next to me, not even a yard away. In his place was a void of darkness. I turned, searching desperately for my friend, but all I could see was the trees and their darkn- no, this was the Dark Woods. I seemed to be in a small clearing surrounded by twisted trees. I couldn’t recall how the area looked before Sam disappeared. Was I still in the same place? Was my mind creating an illusion? I didn’t know the answer to that, but I knew what was happening was real. The silence was oppressive, bearing down upon me as if any sound would break the world around me. I reached down for my knife, unsheathing it before holding it in front of me. 



A gust of icy wind ripped against me towards a pair of trees to my left. I turned my head to look in that direction when I noticed a small light beyond the treeline. I cautiously stepped towards the light, scanning the surrounding trees. I inched forward, making each step deliberate. I felt the dirt crunch underneath my feet as I strode forward. I made it to the treeline seeing a gap between two gnarled and curved oak trees. The light led down a path between the two. I prayed that this was where I had entered from. I clutched my knife close, hoping Sam was safe. At the thought of Sam, I grabbed my flashlight, turning it on, thinking he might see it. 



The flashlight lit up the path in front of me with its artificial yellow glow. I was about to shout Sam’s name when my voice caught in my throat. Fear. I couldn’t bring myself to announce my presence to the world. At this thought, my flashlight flickered. I quickly turned it off before ridiculing myself for being so careless. I searched my surroundings for any sign I spotted. After a couple minutes, I decided I wasn’t, so I slowly started down the trail. The light seemed to flicker as I approached it. When the source came into sight, my stomach dropped. It was Sam’s flashlight. In a state of shock, I stumbled to it, dropping to my knees in front of it. My hand was shaking as I grabbed it. I held it in my hand, feeling despair start to creep into my soul. However, upon closer inspection, I discovered that while this was the same flashlight that Sam had, it couldn’t be his. This flashlight was much older and covered in grime. It seemed like it had been left here for many years. It was well worn from all the time it was out in the elements. Despite all this, the flashlight still shone bright. It was acting like a beacon for this place, showing the way. Guiding the lost from the all-encompassing void of the Dark Woods. 



Just as I was beginning to relax a little, the flashlight went out. The air turned frigid, my lungs burning with every breath I took. The darkness was complete. The silence is deafening. At that moment, I had a terrible thought. I was wrong. The flashlight wasn’t a beacon of hope. The flashlight was bait. Its purpose was to lure people who had wandered into the Dark Woods with the false promise of salvation. I was but another unfortunate soul who had fallen for this ruse. My body started to shake violently, partly from the now freezing cold that had descended upon me but also from fear. The primal fear that swelled from the depths of my being. 



A brief shimmer moved across my vision, carried on the arctic breeze. It was the same shimmer that I had seen last night. I was no longer alone. My head turned to follow the shimmer, trying to get a good look at who I knew was responsible for my situation. The shimmer extended upwards to the tree. It kept going, up past the top of even the tallest pine. I continued into the sky, void of all light, just like the rest of the Dark Woods. Then two bright stars appeared. No, not stars; eyes. I couldn’t delude myself anymore. I was looking at eyes, and they were looking at me. Another pair appeared across the eyes. More and more appeared in every part of the sky. I struggled for breath. Frost was starting to accumulate on my shivering body. My fingers burned from the intense cold, but I couldn’t pry my sight from the sky. I shakingly broke the silence with a statement illustrating the sheer terror and dismay of what I was looking at.



“My God…” I shook.



I was looking at the night sky. It was just like the beautiful sky I had loved and admired for all my life. It was the most magnificent array of the cosmos I had ever seen. However, it wasn’t the sky I loved. It was a horror beyond comprehension. Even knowing the truth that was in front of me, I couldn’t turn away. I stood still, no longer shaking. My eyes were transfixed by the cascade of brilliant orbs before me. A fog covered my mind as I fell into a trance. The eyes were so beautiful; beckoning me to join them. I felt my sense of self slowly drift away from my body towards the eyes. Yes… I want to join you in your warm embrace. Allow me to become like you, with your brilliant shining eyes. Just as the eyes started to glow bright, flooding out of the darkness, I heard something. At the corner of my shattered consciousness, I heard a soft sound. Someone was calling my name. 



I awoke to Sam shaking me and yelling my name. Once he saw me open my eyes, he stopped shaking me and helped me sit up. The confused look on my face prompted him to explain what had happened. He told me how when we were walking in the forest I had suddenly collapsed. He panicked and tried his best to wake me up. However, despite his best efforts, I could not be awoken. My body grew cold and my breathing was shallow. Sam had then ransacked his bag, looking through the emergency supplies for anything that might help me. As my body began to shake, he grew more desperate. In his last-ditch attempt, he grabbed the smelling salts and used them on me, hoping that I would wake up. I didn’t right away and Sam started to lose hope. He shook me and called my name with a mix of desperation and grief. It was around this time that I opened my eyes. My mind was still foggy, and I felt ill. Sam helped me to my feet and we left that forest. We shambled back to Chris’ car and the others ran to us with worry on their face. Sam briefly told them the situation and we got in the car. They wanted to take me to the hospital, but I objected, saying it was simply exhaustion and I just needed to go home to rest. A reluctant murmur of agreement ran through the group before we left the park. As we were turning down the road that led back home, I took a last look back at the park. In the dark recesses of the forest, I saw a pair of eyes; brilliant, white, eyes…
