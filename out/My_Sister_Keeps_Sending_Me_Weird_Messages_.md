Hi my name is Lita. I'm sixteen years old and for the last month and a half my sister Ellan has been sending me strange messages over text. The messages weren’t too strange at first, just some dark jokes here and there. I didn’t think too much about it at the time but then they started becoming more and more common in Ellan’s texts. She eventually started sending news articles about people just having horrific things done to them. This is when I started becoming concerned since I didn’t think it was healthy for her to be constantly reading about messed up things and I told her so but she just responded with 
“I understand your concern but I just find this interesting and wanted to share with you as i’m starting a true crime podcast”

I was kinda weirded out by this response but whatever I guess she is a stay at home wife and could use the extra income. This week however the messages started to get really out of hand as Ellan started sending videos and photos of what looks to be real videos of people being killed in horrific ways. I’m going to go into detail about what the videos and photos showed for the sake of my soul and yours. I asked Ellan why the hell is she sending me these photos and videos and why the hell she was looking at them in the first place she just responded by saying
“I don’t know, why are you upset by this?”

After that message she just kept sending more and more of these videos. I asked her to stop sending me this fucked up stuff. She didn’t stop sending these videos, my only response from her would be voicemails of her laughing for minutes on end. I honestly thought she hated me or something cause why else would she send me these things. Not knowing what else to do I went to my mom and told her about this. She was reasonably freaked out and tried to get a hold of my sister but she couldn’t. So she called her husband and explained the situation to him to which his response was 
“Huh that’s weird I’ll try and talk to her about it”

Safe to say after that lackluster response my sister kept sending me those videos and photos. At this point my mom asked me to block her as she didn’t want me seeing those videos anymore. But I couldn’t block my sister. I loved her. She clearly needed help so I convinced my mom to take me to her house so we could check on her. When we got to her house we knocked on the door but there was no response. We waited a few minutes before knocking again, still no response. Eventually my mom knocked on the door while saying
“Ellan it’s me and Lita are you home?” We waited a few more minutes and were about to go when the door opened and Ellan was there to greet us.
“Hi guys” Ellan said meekly while looking down, clearly avoiding eye contact with us.
“Sorry to leave you two hanging like that”
“Don’t worry about it” mom said while embracing her as tightly as possible

Ellan led us inside and we all sat down in the living room. I expected her house to be at least a little messy but it was clean. It was so clean that the place hardly looked like it’d been lived in. At the very least I expected Ellan to look a little rough but she looked fine and well put together as always.
“I think you know why we're here darling” mom said while fidgeting with her hands
“No I don’t?” Ellan responded looking genuinely confused
“The videos and photos you’ve been sending me Ellan” I blurted out 
“What videos” Ellan looked even more confused
“The videos of those awful things happening to people”
Ellan laughed when I said that
“Have you been watching too many scary movies, Lita?” her voice darkened when she said that
Mom chimed in stopping Ellan from derailing the conversation
“Ellan we’re all very worried about you and we love you but something here isn’t right you shouldn’t looking let alone sending those videos to your sister”
“I have no idea what you’re talking about” 

Ellan looked even more puzzled than before. I pulled out my phone and went to our text conversation and showed her what she’d sent me.
“You honestly don’t know what I’m talking about” I said harsher than I meant to

Helen’s face went pale as she scrolled through the messages 
“N-no I swear to god I didn’t send these to you, my god I wouldn’t even look at this stuff myself”
Ellan paused for a moment before continuing
“Lita I don’t know who sent you this but I swear it wasn’t me”
“What do you mean was phone number hacked or something” Mom asked with hopeful relief in her eyes
“I guess my number was hacked and I somehow didn’t know, my god i’m sorry that you had to see all that Lita if I’d only known sooner”
“Ellan it’s okay it’s not your fault” I said as a wave of relief came over me
Mom, Ellan, and I hugged it out and Ellan changed her phone number. We stayed for a little longer to make sure Ellan was alright. But while on the drive home I couldn’t help but think about the many inconsistencies in my sister’s story of being hacked. Why didn’t she hear about what was happening from her husband after my mom called him?  Wouldn’t she have gotten my messages of me asking her why she was sending me all these horrific things? And did those voicemails of laughing sound exactly like her? I pushed these thoughts away for the past few days as once Ellan changed her phone number I wasn’t sent another awful video or photo. Well that is until yesterday when I was sent the message on Ellan’s new phone number
“You can’t stop me”

Under the message was at least a dozen photos and videos of the most depraved things you can think of. Again I don’t wanna say what these photos and videos showed for the sake of my soul and your soul. I don’t know how I’m to stop this or if Ellan is really behind this but I’ll keep all of you updated. If you have any questions leave in the comments and I’ll try to respond to them.
