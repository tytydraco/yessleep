The GameStop at the mall in Fremont opened at 10. I drove like a maniac trying to get there before then—I simply couldn’t risk someone else buying the game.

It was 10:05 when I arrived at the store, sweat dripping from my face. Behind the register was a pimply-faced kid watching some video on his phone. He didn’t even bother to look up at me as I approached him.

“I saw on your website that you got a copy of *Desert War*,” I said, panting.

“Oh, yeah. Some kid bought it yesterday. It takes a little while for our website to update. Sorry, man.”

“Do you know who bought it?”

He shook his head.

“How about the guy who sold it, what did he look like?”

“Uh…it’s hard to say. He was wearing a surgical mask and had on dark sunglasses and a hoodie. Think he was white, and he looked old, like about your age, the little skin I could see was wrinkled. Average height, no accent or anything.”

“Did the guy tell you anything about the game?”

“Not really. He came in with the cartridge and I told him we only buy big N64 titles, like *Mario Kart*, but he said I could have it for free and just walked out. I tried to search for it in our system, but no info came up, so I just priced it at $2.99 and put it in the bargain bin.”

“How about the kid who bought it, do you know who he is?”

“I don’t know his name, but I’ve seen him before. He’s Asian, like 14 or so. Why are you asking all these questions?”

“Because I own a video game store and that cartridge was stolen from—.”

“Oh shit. I didn’t know it was stolen, I swear, man. Can you please not file a police report, I’d probably get fired. I’ll pay you out of my own…”

\*\*\*

I had no choice but to call the cops. That kid’s life was in danger if he ended up playing the game. For obvious reasons, I couldn’t tell the cops everything I knew—they’d think I was crazy—so I just said that I thought some predator had lured Jason Statler 20 years ago, and, after a long hiatus, was trying to lure other kids.

I was hoping some detectives would come, but instead a regular patrol officer showed up an hour later.

“I’ve received a report that a stolen video game was sold here,” the cop said.

“It’s not just that,” I said. “This is related to the Jason Statler—”

“Sir, you’re not making any sense. Jason Statler disappeared over twenty years ago. I don’t see what a stolen video game has to do with him.”

“I know it sounds crazy, but—”

He let out a long sigh. “Sir, I have a friend in the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office who is working that case. They have received innumerable tips from cranks—”

“I’m not a crank! There is imminent danger to the kid who bought this game.”

“Oh, just shut up. You’re wasting my time.” He turned to the GameStop employee. “How much did the game sell for, anyways?”

“$2.99.”

The cop chuckled. “Yeah, this is a complete waste of my time. Think I spent more on gas driving over here.”

I called after him as he started walking away, but he paid me no attention. Even if he had, it might have been to late. I searched for any recent articles about missing kids in the Bay Area. On the *East Bay Times* website, there was a headline about a missing kid from Milpitas. A 15-year-old named Adam Kim had been reported missing this morning. The police said they were investigating it as a possible runaway, but I was almost positive that wasn’t the case. I recognized his photograph. He had come into my store dozens of times. Even though he was coming of age in the era of ninth-generation consoles—the PS5 and the Xbox Series X—he loved retro games more than anyone I knew.

I showed his photo to the clerk. As I suspected, he was the kid who had bought the copy of Desert War. *Was he still alive, held captive in the skeleton’s lair? Had he been given three lives like me, or did the skeleton only give him one chance?* Thinking about it wouldn’t do any good, I needed to track down the skeleton.

I checked my email, praying that there was some lead. James Langan, one of the guys I had messaged from Gooseberry Games, had gotten back to me. He was currently a professor at Berkeley and said he was free to meet with me at 1 this afternoon.

\*\*\*

Dr. Langan’s office was on the 4th story of Soda Hall. I had heard that it was the only building at Berkeley to include both classrooms and showers, designed that way to accommodate the demanding schedules of its CS students. However, based on the odor in the building, it was clear that the students were not taking advantage of all its facilities.

The door to the professor’s office was open. Behind a cluttered desk sat a smiling man with a long white beard.

“Ah,” he said when he saw me. “What an honor to finally meet you in person. The guy who gave *Raucous Raccoon Racing* a 1.25/10. Think in your review you wrote that ‘getting rabies would be more fun than playing this game.’”

“Uh…” I said. “It was nothing personal. I—”

He laughed. “Oh, I’m not mad, don’t worry. I barely even worked on that title. Bet you’re wondering about the lagginess of it. Other N64 racing games, like *Mario Kart 64*, used pre-rendered sprits to simulate a 3D appearance. We wanted to be the first to use actual 3D models. One of the guys on our team thought he had a way to overcome N64’s limited processing power, but, as you know, it wasn’t very successful. I wanted to hold off, push back the release and fix the performance issues, but, as usual, I was outvoted.”

“Very interesting,” I said. Normally, I would have loved to talk with him about retrogaming, but now was not the time. “So in your email you said that you know something about *Desert War*.”

“I never thought I would hear that name again. But here you are. It’s a long story. I don’t have all the answers, but hopefully, if we put our heads together we can figure it out.”

He took out a photo from one of his desk drawers that showed a group of about 30 guys. In the back left row was a man who appeared to be about 40. He looked creepy—I don’t like to judge people on their appearances—but that was the first word that came to mind. He was dressed in a magenta tracksuit and had long platinum-blonde hair, so light that it was nearly white. And, on his head, was the green sorcerer’s hat the skeleton had worn, the hat that was found near the body of Jason Statler.

“Who’s that man with the hat?” I asked.

He chuckled. “That was Ed Schumacher. He was quite the eccentric, as you can probably tell from his appearance. Not that there aren’t lots of interesting characters in video game studios, but he was in a league of his own. Wore that hat every day. When asked why, he simply answered that he thought it was a ‘happy hat.’ A good a reason as any, don’t you think?

“Now, Ed was not a programmer. He was an illustrator, would design advertisements, box art, instruction manuals, etc. Was fairly talented, wouldn’t say he was world-class, but he was a decent artist.

“Ed’s dream was to become a developer.  Unfortunately, he had no aptitude for the subject. He was, how shall I phrase this, a rather simple-minded individual. He could draw well, but he couldn’t even program a simple 2D game like Pong, which is something I could do in an afternoon. Honestly, I would be surprised if he could have coded, ‘Hello, World!’ And I’m not being hyperbolic.

“But Ed never gave up. He had an idea for this grand video game. It would be designed for children, even though Ed had no children of his own, he still loved kids. Now, I know what you’re thinking, but it was not in a perverse way, I’m almost certain of it. He loved dressing up in costume and going to promotional events, handing out free goodies to kids, getting them to smile. I know it sounds creepy, but I do not think there was anything nefarious about his intentions.

“His game would be about two children, a brother and a sister, who get lost in a magical world and have to find their way home. Not original, I know, but Ed thought it would be a big hit. He was also working on some children’s book that would be a companion piece to it.

“Ed pitched that game over and over, but it would be a mess, a literal mess. Was going to be a mashup of 50 different genres, part shooter, part racing game, part platformer, even part RTS if you can believe it. Of course, that would not be successful, so we had to gently turn Ed down, tell him that now wasn’t a good time, that maybe next year we could take it on.

“Ed asked if he could work on the game himself. He wasn’t that busy, and to satisfy him, we said fine, he could spend an hour a day working on his pet project. *Raucous Raccoon* was our last N64 title, so we let him mess around on an old computer that had all the N64 development kits and tools configured on it.

“Our next game was the title you’re interested in—*Desert War*. It was planned for the PS2 and would be an FPS. You’d control either an American or British soldier as they fought Rommel’s troops in North Africa. In late 2001, there was a meeting where Ed was showing some sample cover art for the game. Very similar to the photos of the label you sent. Then, to everyone’s surprise, Ed said that he wanted to show a live N64 demo. No one had any clue what he was talking about. But he starts demoing the ‘game’ you described in the email, with that kid wandering around the desert. No skeleton though, that must have been added later. And the kid wasn’t dressed in cargo shorts and a black t-shirt. But overall, it was very similar. You could tell Ed was proud of himself, but most of the office burst out laughing. And poor Ed runs off crying with the cartridge. He quit that very day. Never saw him again.

“As for *Desert War*, it got canned. Development was taking longer than expected and we were hitting some major roadblocks. *Medal of Honor: Frontline* was released in May of 2002, and that was far better than what we had created. It was decided to stop throwing good money after bad and shelve the project. I quit that October and returned to academia. People complain about how stressful it is, but compared to working at a game studio it’s like spending a day at the spa. Gooseberry Games folded a few months later.”

“So where’s Ed now?” I asked.

“Dead. He committed suicide, think it was in early 2002. Apparently videotaped the whole thing.”

*Early 2002. Around the time Jason went missing*. “Have you heard about the Jason Statler case?” I asked.

The professor nodded. “Yeah, saw on the news that a hat like the one Ed wore was found near his body. I contacted the police and they looked into it. Said that he had died a month or so before Jason disappeared. Just a coincidence.”

“Jason’s brother is the one who sold me the cartridge. The day before his body was discovered.”

“That is another odd coincidence, but I bet there was some yard sale with all of Ed’s stuff after he died, and Jason bought his hat and the cartridge there.”

“You know how many cartridges Ed made?”

“Pretty sure there's just that one. He went all out, making label art and burning it onto an actual cartridge.  That's not how it's typically done. I’m sure you know this, but during development, you didn’t use actual cartridges. Instead, the build would be burned onto an EPROM chip, which would be loaded into a caddy for testing purposes. Guess Ed thought it would impress us, poor guy.”

“You said that Ed couldn’t write a basic program, yet he allegedly created a game—not sure if you could call that a game, but he created something playable. I was never an N64 developer, but I know that doing that is no small feat. Today, a 10-year-old with a modicum of talent could follow a tutorial and create a basic 3D game for the PC in Unity or another engine that abstracts away most of the math, but not in the ‘90s. Even today, it’s hard for an experienced programmer to create a homebrew N64 game— its architecture is notoriously difficult, almost as complex as Sega Saturn’s. So, someone must have been helping him.”

“You’re right, and I’ve thought about that too. I teach an elective undergrad class on computer graphics. Some students think that it will be an easy, fun class, but I emphasize that it requires a solid math background. I put on the syllabus that if you start shaking when you hear the word ‘quaternions’ you should find another class. But many don’t listen to me. I’ve even been told that it even requires more math than the undergrad machine learning courses. But I’m digressing, I tend to do that. To answer your question, yes, Ed had help creating that 'game.' Who helped him, I don’t know. He was a loner, don’t think he was ever married, had no friends as far as I could tell.”

I thought about the piece of metal I had found with 'F.S.' engraved into it. “Did Ed have a brother by chance whose name started with F?” I asked. “Frank or Fred or something like that. I found an…uh…an Easter egg with the initials F.S. on it.”

“He did indeed have a twin brother named Frank. Unlike Ed, Frank was as smart as a whip, did his undergrad at Caltech, double-majored in mathematics and physics, before getting his applied mathematics PhD at Stanford. Then he got a tenure-track position here at Berkeley, but he got fired. From what I heard, he was a disturbed, troubled individual.”

“I think we found who helped Ed with the game,” I said.

“No, he couldn’t have. Frank killed himself in ’96, jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge.”

\*\*\*

After leaving the professor’s office, I headed to Berkeley’s Doe Library, determined to find out anything I could about Ed and Frank.

I was sure I would find some information about Ed that would show that he was not the harmless eccentric the professor had made him out to be. But there wasn’t much about him online. I located a Social Security Death Index record for an Edwin Fox Schumacher, which listed his date of death as March 6, 2002, but not much else. Didn’t even find an obituary or the location of his grave.

I searched newspaper archives, but the only article on Ed was a brief mention in the *Mercury News* that in May of 2002, the San José Museum of Art had acquired “an unpublished 700-page children’s book manuscript by the late Ed Schumacher, a reclusive illustrator, for $500.”

The museum’s collection database showed that the work was not on display, but had an image of a childlike watercolor depicting two smiling children on a swing set.

There were no other results for him; he wasn’t even listed in the credits of any Gooseberry games. The professor said that he filmed his death, and I thought that footage would be circulating online, but found nothing. I didn’t really want to see it—I was never into gruesome, macabre stuff like that—but it could offer a clue. I tried dozens of queries, tried spelling his last name as Shoemaker, tried general queries like ’2002 Bay Area suicide video,’ but found nothing. Finally, when I searched for “sorcerer’s hat suicide video”, I found a link to a message board.

“Does anyone have a copy of the video of the guy in a sorcerer’s hat (sort of like the one Mickey wore in *Fantasia*) dissolving himself in a vat of acid???” someone asked in a post from September of 2002. *A vat of acid? What could possess someone to kill himself in such a horrific manner?*

I skimmed the post. Apparently, the only copy of the film, titled *The Death of Ed the Sorcerer*, was owned by an adult video store in East Oakland. I was sure it would have made its way online, but everything I found said that if you wanted to watch the video you had to go to Oakland. Apparently, it wasn’t even on the dark web.

How that was possible, I didn’t know, but I’d worry about that later. Next, I started researching Frank. There were more results for him. As the professor said, he seemed like a brilliant man. The first result was from the 1980 Jefferson High School Yearbook in Daly City. His senior page—depicting him with close-cropped hair—said that he had qualified for the United States of America Mathematical Olympiad and had hoped to attend either Caltech, Stanford, or MIT. Curiously, Ed was not in the yearbook. *Guess he attended some alternative school*.

In the following years, he had won several awards and published dozens of highly cited papers. But nearly all of his output stopped when he accepted a position at Berkeley in 1994.

There was an article from 1996 in the *Daily Cal*, Berkeley’s student newspaper. It said that “Franklin Lawrence Schumacher, an assistant professor of mathematics, was arrested for attempting to steal a 13th-century German grimoire from Bancroft Library.”

Two weeks later, another article reported that his wallet and bike were found on the Golden Gate Bridge at night. I searched some more, but there was no mention of his body ever being recovered.

*He had faked his death*. That I was sure of. He had killed Jason Statler, disappeared for over 20 years, but, for some unknown reason, had returned. And I was running out of time to find him.

I tried to find information on their parents or other relatives, but found nothing. It was as if they were foundlings.  I also failed to find Frank’s old address online, but failed. I didn’t think he’d still be living there, of course, but thought he might have left a clue for me there, like how he left that piece of metal with his initials on my kitchen floor.

I went down to the stacks and found an old Bay Area directory and made a note of Frank’s former Berkeley address. I also found the address of Ed’s old apartment in Daly City.

\*\*\*

After leaving the library, I drove to Frank’s old Berkeley address. There was a vacant lot where his house once stood. I poked around for a few minutes, but found nothing of interest.

Next, I headed to the video store, creatively named VideoXXX, in East Oakland. It was sandwiched between an auto body shop and an abandoned warehouse. Some people are scared to go to Oakland—they think the whole city is a pit—but it has several upscale neighborhoods where the median rent for a one-bedroom apartment is nearly $3,000. This was not one of those neighborhoods. Gentrification had not, and I doubted ever would, come to this part of town.

The clerk, a thirty-something guy dressed in a stained black t-shirt that covered only half of his enormous gut, glared at me as I entered. “You a cop or something?” he asked.

“No, I’m—”

“You look like a cop. Go ahead, arrest me, I’ll sue you. Nothing I have in here is illegal. I have—”

“I’m not a cop,” I said. “I hear you have the video of Ed Schumacher’s death.”

“Ed the Sorcerer?”

I nodded.

“Yeah, we got that. It’ll be 50 bucks.”

“I don’t want to buy a copy, just—”

“Yeah, you can’t buy it, there’s only one copy. You have to view it here. If we let people take it home, it would be all over the dark web. Also, put your phone in your car. Can’t risk people recording.”

“Fine,” I said. I went back to my car and locked it in the trunk of my sedan. When I returned, the clerk collected the $50, checked me with a metal-detecting wand, and led me into a back room. There were two rows of seating and a film projector on a tripod in the rear of the room. From a locked safe, the clerk took out a film reel.

“Shot on Super 8,” the clerk said. “It helps with its aesthetic. Grungy as fuck. I’d say that this is one of the few films we have that has actual artistic merit. I know film, have a BFA from USC’s School of Cinematic Arts.”

I didn’t ask why someone who had graduated from one of the best film schools was working at an adult video store. As he started the projector, I sat down in the back row. As Khachaturian’s *Masquerade: Waltz* played, various title cards flashed across the screen. Actual physical cards, like you’d see in a silent film.

“The Death of Ed the Sorcerer.”

“Starring Ed the Sorcerer as Himself.”

“Directed by Ed the Sorcerer.”

“Screen Play by Ed the Sorcerer.”

“Produced by Ed the Sorcerer.”

And so on. Think there were probably about 50 cards in total. At the bottom of each, in white, was a illustration of a skeleton wearing a sorcerer’s hat. As each new card was displayed, he slowly danced his way across the screen.

After the cards, the film showed the interior of a small bedroom. There was a large steel vat in front of an unmade bed. Next to it was a ladder. And, on one of the walls, there was the poster that José had described seeing back in 2002. The one advertising the *Desert War* sweepstakes. On the bottom of it, was a URL—rehcamuhcsde.com Took me a few seconds to realize that it was Ed Schumacher spelled backwards.

After about a minute, Ed finally walked on screen, naked except for his sorcerer’s hat and a pair of rose-colored glasses. He was trembling and looked sickly—his face was sallow, his ribs were all showing. *Was he terminally ill? Was that why he decided to end his life? But why would he do it in such a painful manner?*

“Hello,” Ed said, his voice shaky. “My name is Ed the Sorcerer. And today, it is necessary that I die.”He seemed to look at the camera for several seconds, before slowly climbing into the vat.

Then there was a cut and we were looking down at Ed’s body immersed in liquid. *There had been a cut! The camera had moved.* Someone else was in the room with him. Almost certainly Frank. Frank wanted his brother to kill himself. But why?

We did not get to hear Ed’s screams, instead Vivaldi’s *La primavera* played. I had previously thought that Ed might have faked his death, but if he were acting, he deserved to win an Oscar. There was pure terror on his face, it was the personification of agony. It seemed to take hours before his silent screams ceased.

I wanted to leave, but I couldn’t, for I thought that Frank might have dropped another clue. As Ed’s body floated in the vat, his pasty skin slowly dissolved, revealing his muscles and tendons. Then the acid began to eat them as well.

There was another cut. The vat had been drained. On top of a layer of sludge were Ed’s bones and the sorcerer’s hat.

“That’s the end of the good part,” the clerk said. “The rest is five more minutes of looking at his bones. You can stay if you want to, but it’s pretty boring.”

“You went to film school,” I said. “Was this faked?”

“Nah, this is real. The second sequence, of him dissolving in the acid, that was sped up, you can see on the reel where the film was cut and spliced, but it’s not a fake.”

“Where did you get it from?”

He laughed. “How the fuck would I know? This place has changed owners like 5 times. Probably someone came in and sold it. We got lots of amateur stuff, although this one is a gem. I’ve thought about editing it and submitting it to film festivals.”

“On screen, the skeleton suddenly stood up and leaped towards the camera. *It looked like it was a fake after—*

The skeleton shot out of the screen. At first, it looked translucent, but as it neared me it began to solidify. The clerk let out a high-pitched scream, and with a surprising speed, dashed out of the room. I got up to follow him, but the skeleton was moving too fast. It wrapped  its ice-cold hands around my neck and started strangling me. I tried to break its grip, but it was too strong. I staggered backwards, struggling to breathe.

I fell to the ground, feeling light-headed, each of my attempts to free myself getting weaker and weaker. In a last-ditch effort, I kicked my left foot towards the legs of the tripod, about two feet away from me. It toppled over, the projector cracking as it hit the linoleum floor. The screen went blank, and the skeleton slowly dissolved into the air.

I struggled to my feet, gasping for breath. *Had I finally defeated the skeleton?* I didn’t think so.
