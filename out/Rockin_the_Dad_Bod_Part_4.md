The E6 Travel Mart looked almost the same as I left it. Castle still lay on the floor in a fetal position. He had stopped his all-out crying, but still sniffled a little when he inhaled. The pile of Pop-Tarts and Funions was still on the floor where Kevin dropped them. *Kevin* – where was he?

“Castle, what’s happened to you?” Where ten seconds earlier, the Parson was full of the confidence of the righteous, he now sounded shaken.

I followed the Parson into the potato chip aisle, where Castle still lay. The fallen trucker extended his arm, then slowly extended a shaky index finger. “*She* took me out,” he whimpered.

The Parson followed the trucker’s accusatory finger and turned to glare at me. “Ah, I see,” he said calmly, “that our little Pauline is a SINNER!” I flinched when he screamed the word *sinner*.

Now the Parson extended his own accusatory finger at me. “Sinner! You took out Castle. You must atone!”

“Sure?”

“You must tell me where I can find the King!”

“I don’t know ….” I began to profess my true ignorance about where Kevin had gone. But, as I started telling the Parson that I didn’t know where Kevin was, I suddenly *did* know where he was because, as I spoke, I saw Kevin hiding in the drinks fridge behind the Parson at the end of the aisle. My truthful statement became a lie before I had even finished my sentence. “… where he is. Like. At. All.”

“You must be struck down!” The Parson lifted his crooked Bible over his head. He took a step backwards and turned to face straight up-and-down the potato-chip aisle. The Parson’s movements were confusing - It was a strange way to smite someone, stepping backwards and turning to place them in front and to the side.

It clicked. *Chess*. This is all some kind of demented game of chess. Keven, the Parson said, is the king. Castle is a rook. When Castle confronted Kevin, right here in this same potato chip aisle at the E6, he made sure he stood directly in front of Kevin to threaten him. I’m a pawn. I struck diagonally when I punched Castle. Castle’s pathetic collapse when I hit him wasn’t from any super-strength I have. It’s just how the game goes – if a pawn attacks you diagonally, you’re out.

I thought of the Parson’s bolo tie doo-dad and the diagonal cross piece on his church’s cross – he’s a bishop. He can only attack diagonally.

“Sinner!” he yelled again. I looked at him dumbly, my brain still finding the hidden order in my fever dream of an evening. A few seconds passed. “I will strike you down,” he said again. I looked up at his hand, brandishing the book with the diagonal cross. “You have sinned!” Why wasn’t he hitting me?

*Because it’s my turn!*

I stepped forward so I was shoulder-to-shoulder with him. He stepped backwards, putting me in his diagonal, again.

The Parson’s step backwards put him only a foot away from the shop’s refrigerator wall; a foot away from the glass door to the fridge that Kevin had awkwardly crammed himself into. I smiled.

Kevin opened the refrigerator door and jumped into the aisle. The Parson spun around. “The king-” he sputtered.

Kevin quietly said “I take you,” and backhanded the Parson’s hat off his head.

The Parson collapsed onto his knees and held his holy book high above his head. “Lord,” he said, “please play my piece again.” Then he lowered his head and began whispering prayers.

“Nicely played,” Kevin said to me. “Tricking him into getting next to the door to the fridge I was hiding in. Smart stuff. I knew I picked the right pawn. You, Pauline, are going places.”

I stared at Kevin for a full minute-and-a-half. I was paralyzed with an incapacitating mixture of fear, confusion, rage, and then a little more fear on top. The huge squirt of adrenaline that my glands or whatever dumped into my bloodstream when the Parson threatened me with his book left me quivering with fight-or-flight energy that I now had no need for.  
  
Kevin attempted to talk to me while I basically silently vibrated in front of him.  
  
"Pauline comes through for the W!"  
  
Nothing from me.  
  
"I knew you'd come back to help me out."  
  
I wanted to respond. I just couldn't. The road from my brain to my mouth was closed for maintenance.  
  
"I was right about you. You're definitely queen material."  
  
My lips pressed together for a moment as if I was going to say something that started with the letter 'B.' Consciously, I still had nothing to say. It was just that my mouth, without any signal from my brain, kind-of took matters into its own hands. Or its own lips, I guess.  
  
My addled brain tried to follow what my mouth was doing. Was there anything I could say that started with 'B.' No. Nothing came to mind.  
  
"Pauline? PAULINE? Are you still with me? You're not seeing the grid, are you?"  
  
Kevin's odd, slightly off-putting question about "seeing the grid" gave me something to focus on. The mouth/brain roadway opened up a single lane for travel. "Grid?" I tried to say. My mouth had already decided to say ‘B’ so my question came out as "Brid?"  
  
"Ohhh," Kevin said, seemingly only now realizing how far down the rabbit hole my brain had slipped. "Let's get you some Pop Tarts. That'll clear things up."  
  
He put his hands on my shoulders and gently turned he around. Then he walked me back to the E6's cash register counter. There was a wheeled stool behind the counter for the so-far non-existent cashier to sit on. Kevin pulled the chair around the counter and sat me in it. "Wait here. I'll go get what you need."  
  
He wandered off into the potato-chip aisle, carefully stepping over Castle and the Parson, who were still wallowing on the floor, and returned with a box of Pop Tarts. "It's a special flavor," he said, showing me the box. "Cosmic Fudge." The box showed a picture of a Pop Tart whose top bore a colorful, swirling galaxy rendered in icing. It had a bite taken out of the corner, and a spray of psychedelic paisleys, fractals, and neon-green vines was pictured gushing out fudge-colored interior.

“This will really clear things up for you.” He tore the box open and pulled out a pair of Pop Tarts wrapped in foil. “Here, eat this,” he tore open the foil pouch and handed me a galaxy-decorated Pop Tart.

This wasn’t the first time in my life someone handed me something potentially mind-altering and told me that ingesting it would make me feel better. Frankly, most of the time, I *did* feel better after eating whatever mystery substance was offered.

I took the offered Pop Tart and bit off the corner, leaving it looking just like the picture on the box. Unlike the box, my Pop Tart didn’t emit a geyser of psychedelic shapes. Just a sweet, deeply-fulfilling taste of fudge.  
  
“I know how you're feeling,” Kevin said as he watched me chew and swallow. “You don't know why you came here tonight, but you got the feeling that something ain't right.”

I took another bite of the Cosmic-Fudge-flavored pastry. Kevin kept talking. “You’re so scared in case you fall off your chair. And you’re wondering how you’ll get down the stairs.” He switched from talking to me, to off-key singing. “Clowns to the left of you, Jokers to the right, and here you are stuck in the middle with me.”

I turned to Kevin so I could glare at him while I told him to shut up. But, like he just said, something wasn’t right.

“Kevin,” I said. “Why are you wearing that hat?”

“Hat?” he said. “Look again. It’s a crown.”

I closed my eyes. The darkness was a nice break from the surreal scene in the E6 travel mart. I opened my eyes. Everything was different.

Except for the chair Kevin plopped me into, the E6 was gone. No more cash registers, aisles of junk food, and refrigerators with soda. I was on a grid. On a huge chessboard. The squares were enormous – each was a hundred yards across. A hundred fifty, maybe. They were shiny and perfectly smooth – as if each square was a single enormous, highly polished tile.

*My* square – the one that I was centered in – was a white one. Castle and The Parson lay on the white surface a few feet away – as if all of us had been transported from the E6 to the grid as a unit, with the positions between us remaining the same. Or as if the E6 Travel Mart was an illusion that had vanished when I ate the bite of Cosmic Fudge, and all of us were always on the grid.

Kevin stood in front of me, staring intensely into my eyes. He still wore a gold crown.

“Do you see now? Where we are? *What* we are?”

I studied his crown. I’m not an expert on crowns, but his looked legit. Heavy. Gold. Constellations of red, green, and blue gems decorated its surface. In the center, a huge white crystal. Diamond? No, it was far too big to be a diamond. But the most prominent feature of the headpiece was that it appeared to be *bolted* to his head. A dozen-or-so golden hex-bolt heads ran around the base of the crown.

“Look at them,” Kevin said, pointing at the prone figures of Castle and The Parson.”

They each wore … *things* on their heads. *Hats* is too normal a word for what they had on. They weren’t crowns, though. The Parson wore something that looked like what the Pope might wear – tall and arched like a Cathedral ceiling. But black. And attached to his head with the same golden bolts.

Castle’s headpiece was literally a model castle. Picture the Princess Castle at Disney, but bolted to a huge truck-driver’s head.

“Do you see what we are?” Kevin repeated.

“You’re….” I trailed off because I didn’t want to hear myself say something that implied either I, or the universe itself, was insane.

“Chess pieces. I’m the king. The white king. And you, Pauline. I want you to be my pawn.”

“But …? How …?” I couldn’t even form a question. Logic and proportion had fallen sloppy dead.

“You just sit tight and keep eating that Pop-Tart. I’m going to tell you a story.”

I took another bite of my Cosmic Fudge breakfast snack.

“I was an investment banker. Wall Street. I liked to take risks. Big risks. I was extremely successful, until suddenly one day, I wasn’t. In fact, you could say that one day, I became the exact opposite of successful. I lost a lot of people’s money. And all of my own. I was fired. I moved through a bunch of random jobs for a while, but nothing clicked. Nothing let me take the risks I wanted. Then I met her.”

“Who?” I asked with a mouthful of Cosmic Fudge.

“The queen. The white queen. I was waiting for the bus to take me to whatever lame job I hadn’t gotten fired from yet. Then she pulled up, driving a Lamborghini. She revved the engine a few times to get my attention, then rolled the window down.”

“She was dressed like a queen. Not like a dodgy old Queen-of-England queen. She wasn’t wearing anything medieval-looking. From where I was on the bus-stop bench, I could see she was wearing a snazzy couture black-and-white checkered blazer and a white-gold broach in the shape of a chess piece.”

“Then she shouted to me: ‘*Hey! We’re starting a whole new thing over there. Wanna be a king?*’”

“There’s a lot of contextual information missing from that statement. Like who is *we*? Or what kind of thing is getting started. You could ask a ton of follow-up questions, you know? But I only asked one. I said *Over where?*”

I swallowed the last bite of Pop Tart. “What did she say?”

“She said, ‘*On the grid. Get in!*’ So I did.”

“Wow,” I said. “That’s some really bad decision-making on your part. Getting into a car with an obvious wacko, under the premise of doing something that doesn’t even make sense if you’re tripping on LSD.”

“Exactly,” Kevin replied. “Does that sound familiar? Like, is there anyone else you know, besides me, who would do something like that?”

I didn’t answer. I spun around in the chair, looking out over the grid. The grid was enormous. It was hard to see anything more than two squares away, just because of the distance. But I could make out that we weren’t here alone. Far away, in the direction of the dark country road and The Parson’s church, I could barely make out two dark figures. In the other direction, a dark shape stood on the horizon.

“So,” Kevin continued, “she drove me to the grid. And that was the start of the game.”

“So, you’re playing chess? On a huge chessboard?”

“We’re playing a game that’s chess. But also not chess at all. And we’re playing it all over the universe. The universe, Pauline, is a lot weirder than you think it is. You know the story Alice in Wonderland?”

“Yeah, Alice falls into a rabbit hole, and ends up in a surreal, dream-like world.”

“Well, the Universe is like that, but backwards. The normal, mostly ordered universe that you know – *that’s* what’s at the bottom of the rabbit hole. You and me: we’ve climbed *out* of the hole. This – “ he gestured at the grid “ – is the real world. Part of it, anyway”

I swallowed the last bite of my Cosmic Fudge Pop Tart. Kevin got down on one knee, like he was going to propose marriage.

“Pauline. I would like you to be my pawn. Let’s play together.”

I looked around again. Sure, accepting his offer meant I wouldn’t have to go to work on Monday. So, a check in the ‘pro-leave-the-universe’ column. I looked at Castle and The Parson, sprawled out on the grid surface, still moaning and whimpering.

“If we get taken out, what happens?”

“Nobody knows, exactly.”

“If we win, what happens?”

“Nobody knows, exactly.”

“What if I refuse to play?”

“Well, you can just go back to enjoy life with your husband and family.”

“I’m not married.”

“Okay, you can return to your boyfriend, and have date-night every other Tuesday.”

“I’m single.”

“Single. Well then, you can return to the little universe you know, at the bottom of the rabbit hole, and really focus on your career. Hit the grind hard. Build up that 401-k balance.”

I laughed. My “career” was just a series of boring, entry-level jobs with no real prospects for advancement.

I smiled the way I always do when I’m about to do something nuts. “Fine. I’ll be your pawn, Kevin.”

Kevin stood up and placed his hands on my shoulders. For a second, I thought he was going to kiss me. Instead, he spun me around in the chair. The grid blurred and when I had completed the full 360 degrees of spin, I was back in the E6.

“Hold tight!” Kevin said. He ran into the back of the store. I heard him rummaging around on the shelves. A few seconds later he returned with a box that said. “Pawn Helmet – Unisex. Medium.”

He tore open the box and pulled out a heavy steel helmet. The kind you’d wear if you were a pikeman going to battle in the 1600s or so.

He handed me the helmet. “Make sure it fits.” Then he pulled a plastic baggie of golden bolts from the box.

I put the helmet on. Apparently, medium is my size for seventeenth-century war helmets.”

“Uh, what are you going to do with those bolts?”

He didn’t answer me. He pulled a wrench from the box, tore open the baggie of bolts, and pulled one out.

“Close your eyes,” he said.

There was pain. A lot of pain. I kept my eyes closed, so I don’t know exactly what Kevin did to produce the wet crunching and popping noises that came from each part of my head he worked on.

“Don’t move. You don’t want this thing installed crooked. It’ll look funny.”

Twelve gold bolts later, he said “We’re done. Open your eyes.”

I slowly opened my eyes. Kevin smiled at me. His shirt was dotted with a few drops of blood. He gently turned the chair so I was facing the glass door of the E6. I saw myself in the reflection. It was me. Regular me. Wearing my Friday-business-casual outfit. With a steel war helmet bolted to my head. Thin red streaks of blood started at each bolt and ran down my forehead and face.

The pain from the helmet installation was already fading.

“Ready to play?”

“I’m ready.”
