Look, do we not have a single man in here? Oil those damn swings outside – I couldn’t sleep with all this creaking. …The kicks somebody gets from wandering in this weather!

**Block Manager** 7:27

Yes, the mountain winds are harsh today. Good morning everyone!

**Big Jac** 7:45

Allie, its the Roberts from the seventh creaking all night! They are the ones who need to get something oiled up next time lol

**William Roberts** 7:46

oh sod off mate

**Block Manager** 8:00

Dear residents! Which day would be more convenient for hosting a meeting: Friday evening or Saturday morning? I will not be present next week – I will need to spend some time on the mainland.

*Block Manager created a poll*

**Bohemian Rhapsody** 8:35

does anybody else smell rotten eggs? 

**Bohemian Rhapsody** 8:45

hey

**Bohemian Rhapsody** 9:05

/Helen\_Cooper, how do I notify the gas services? It smells in here

**Big Jac** 9:20

there is a thing called shower

**Block Manager** 9:36

There is the services poster in the lobby.

**William Roberts** 10:03

by the way who was that dickhead revving his car engine right under my windows for half the night?!!! I find you and your tires are fucking gone

**Block Manager** 10:05

Please, mind your manners. Better go take part in the poll.

**Alexander** 13:07

What’s the meeting about? We had one already, two weeks ago…

**Block Manager** 13:08

we will discuss getting a new intercom

**Alexander** 13:15

I can’t attend this weekend. What’s the sum to donate?

**Block Manager** 13:16

Everything will be posted after the meeting

**Alexander** 13:17

Okay

**Big Jac** 16:13

**Big Jac** 16:13

**Big Jac** 16:13

yo what thefuck

**Big Jac** 16:14

*…is typing a message…*

**Block Manager** 16:15

Please keep calm, I am looking into it

**Big Jac** 16:16

Holy shit that was a quake!!! You alright, yall?

**Big Jac** 16:17

whats the deal? We evacuate?

**Block Manager** 16:23

Nobody is going anywhere, it is not an earthquake – there was an emergency in the mine!! Message from FEMA: EVERYONE STAY HOME!

**Big Jac** 16:25

ok, thats funny

**Albine** 16:26

what do you mean stay?! I need to pick my girl up from preschool

**Block Manager** 16:27

I REPEAT: EVERYONE STAY HOME! CLOSE ALL WINDOWS, LOCK UP DOORS! THERE HAS BEEN A GAS LEAK!

**Bohemian Rhapsody** 16:30

I told you it smelled

**Albine** 16:30

hold up, who will get my girl then??

**Block Manager** 16:31

You wouldn’t be allowed in anyway, there will be a lockdown until further notice too

**Albine** 16:32

to hell with you all!

**Albine** 16:32

*(left the chat)*

**Big Jac** 16:33

what an idiot, the fuck she thinking! You saw wat is going on there right?

**Big Jac** 16:45

its getting more and more dark, you do whatever but Im not going out

**William Roberts** 17:05

they’re shitting us – this isn’t the mine. When the ground shook, the darkness started coming from the lab.

**Big Jac** 17:08

u think somebodys bombing us?

**William Roberts** 17:15

I think that the order to stay inside was for a reason. Lock up tighter

**Big Jac** 17:16

fuuuuucking hell

**Alexander** 18:05

it isn’t the atomic.

**Alexander** 18:05

dosimeter readings are normal.

**Big Jac** 18:06

well thats good… Yo, you prepared for this kind of thing? Any thoughts? :DD

**Bohemian Rhapsody** 18:26

guys, no one is picking up!!

**Bohemian Rhapsody** 18:26

and messages aren’t getting through

**Bohemian Rhapsody** 18:28

guys, are you here???

**Big Jac** 18:31

Im here. My people aren’t responding too

**Big Jac** 18:31

I aint liking this one bit

**Block Manager** 18:32

Maybe they sealed themselves in just like us?..

**William Roberts** 18:33

and that’s why they aren’t getting messages??

**Block Manager** 18:34

maybe they are in a shelter…

**Big Jac** 18:35

so they all got evacuated,, but we didnt??

**Block Manager** 18:36

How do I know?! Emergency service is not responding. There is not even a dial tone. Try it yourself.

**William Roberts** 18:45

if there is no connection, why is our chat working?

**Bohemian Rhapsody** 18:55

It’s so dark outside…

**Bohemian Rhapsody** 18:56

I’m scared. Why is everybody gone? Where is the emergency support?

**Bohemian Rhapsody** 18:57

what if we’re the last remaining survivors in an apocalypse?

**Big Jac** 19:06

then you will get the honors of restoring humanity. You are the only girl weve got. The one that can carry I mean. No offense, Helen :DD

**Block Manager** 19:10

are you drunk already?

**Big Jac** 19:25

*(left the chat)*

**William Roberts** 19:31

there’s someone in the dark. There’s movement. Maybe it’s the rescue

**William Roberts** 19:48

hey, dosimeter guy, you work at the lab, right? What the fuck did you guys conjure up there?

**Alexander** 19:52

Not me… My wife works there. But it’s classified. She doesn’t tell me anything.

**William Roberts** 19:55

Nothing at all?

**Alexander** 19:58

**Alexander** 20:07

Nothing. She may be charged for an NDA violation.

**William Roberts** 20:08

Took you a long time to utter three words. I say you’re bullshitting all of us.

**William Roberts** 20:11

all right, off with you then. For now.

**Block Manager** 20:38

It is pitch black out there. What happened?... My son is in that mine… And daughter-in-law is on shift as well… God help us!!

**Alexander** 20:40

**Alexander** 20:43

**William Roberts** 21:10

no, there’s definitely someone out there! Out on the street! Are you seeing this? It’s the rescue! They are waving at us! Looks like they are calling out. We need to get outside!

**Block Manager** 21:11

William, what are you talking about, there is no one there. It is just dark as tar

**William Roberts** 21:12

What? Are you guys blind?? There they are, right under the windows! I say we need to go

**Big Jac** 21:13

**Big Jac** 21:13

**Big Jac** 21:14

**Alexander** 21:20

**Block Manager** 21:24

I am not going anywhere. What if my family returns and I am not home?

**Big Jac** 21:26

**Block Manager** 21:30
