  
I never thought I would return. To set foot on the paradise that set my life on fire. To offer myself at the mouth of the monster that consumed so much from my very being. But here I was.

That was the first mistake. One of many I would come to regret. But this one was the catalyst. The first domino. The key to Pandora’s Box.

I didn’t think I’d ever talk about this part. I thought telling you about what happened to my sister, and then to Raffy’s family was enough. But silence doesn’t keep things buried in Pilar. It only feeds them.  
( This won’t make sense unless you know what Pilar already took from me. If you haven’t read the first two parts, start here; [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1k0n9r3/my_hometown_was_a_paradise_that_consumed_my_family/) and [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1k1q686/my_hometown_is_a_paradise_that_consumed_my_best/)).

Pilar looked different. Livelier, even. Like I had taken the curse with me when I left. Like the dark clouds that loomed ahead followed me wherever I took my life. There were more lights now. The town square was filled with music and laughter. Children ran barefoot across the same dirt roads, now cemented pavements, that once held the blood of people who mattered to me. People smiled. They smiled like they had forgotten. Like the woods hadn’t once taken away precious life. 

In all honesty, I never wanted to return. After the mess in the city, quiet firings, whispered rumors about mishandled funds and disappearing inventory and files, I was left with nothing but shame and a cardboard box of things from my desk. My name had been wiped from the company directory before the day even ended. I had nowhere else to go. The rent was overdue, job prospects were thin no thanks to being blacklisted by multiple companies, and supposed friends stopped returning my calls the moment it became clear I had nothing left to offer.

All I had was the old property and small farmland my family owned in Pilar, an aging hut wrapped in vines and silence, sitting at the edge of  the land we once called ours. It was supposed to be sold years ago before I ran away,  but the paperwork got lost in the shuffle after my mother passed. The title was still under my name. A technicality. This was a last resort.

So I came back. For a moment, the festivities laid before my eyes gave me hope. False, hollow hope, but hope nonetheless. Every step I took felt like it brought a decay with them, a darkness that slowly seeped into the dirt.  Nobody here recognized me. At least, I thought nobody did. Some men waved me over, offered me a seat and a glass of coconut gin, the same rough kind my father used to keep stashed in old Coca-Cola bottles. Ones I used to sneak little sips from, regretting each time I did as a child.

“*Welcome back, bud*” one of them said, raising his glass towards me. “*Oh. I…didn’t think anyone would even remember me,*” I replied uncomfortably, taking a swig of the burning drink. “*You’re ol’ Danilo’s kid, right? Hard to forget a face like that. You look like your pops*,” another chuckled. The mention of my father’s name almost made me flinch. I  nodded with a surrendering acceptance. Took another swig. The bitter liquid burning down my throat.

That’s when I met her eyes.

Miranda.

There was nothing striking about her at first glance. She was pretty, sure, but not the kind that turned heads. A kind of pretty that would disappear in a crowd. Like a daisy in a field of flowers. But as the sun dipped into its orange hues and the stories flowed and the drinks hit harder, something about her drew me in. A certain kind of steadiness. A strength behind her soft eyes.

“*You’ve got city hands*,” she flirtatiously teased, touching my palm. “*What? Didn’t think softness was a crime,*” I retorted, grinning. We laughed. Shared memories. Created new ones, blurred and drunken and clumsy. Unintended. By night’s end, we walked together to a private hut near the rice paddies. The air was warm. Our breath smelled of smoke, booze, and sugar.  I didn’t feel much of a connection with her, just a plain craving for the lecherous human touch that I’ve neglected myself for how many years.  And in my drunken vagary, I quenched that craving with her.

Another mistake.

I don’t remember much, except the feeling of skin and the silence after. When I woke, the morning light stung my eyes. My body strained and ached. My head throbbing . Regret sat at the edge of the bed, fully clothed and grinning maliciously.

“*I…I think I should go*,” she whispered, tugging at her shoulder, avoiding my gaze. A small glimpse of weakness in her otherwise steady demeanor. “*Yeah, um, I’m sorry. I think you should go on ahead. My head still hurts. I’ll uh…pay for the hut,*” I murmured, not meeting hers. Her footsteps as she left through the door echoed within my mind, a choking guilt bursting into my thoughts. I told myself it was just one night. But the past has its funny way of reminding us of our mistakes.

Months passed. Slowly. Unevenly. Like time itself was reluctant to move forward in Pilar. I spent the time looking for work, doing odd jobs, wandering around the village. I settled in my childhood home, though it was unimaginably decrepit. I rebuilt the hut, made myself as comfortable as I can be. But the thing is, no matter how much I rebuilt that place, no matter how many rotten wood panels I replaced, the curse that befell me stuck, lingering in the air around me like putrid smoke.

Then one afternoon, Miranda came to find me. Her face was pale, her eyes wide with something deeper than fear. It was uncertainty. “*I’m pregnant,*” she said. The words swirled in my brain like a nasty parasite borrowing itself deep into fleshy seams. I didn’t speak. Couldn’t. My throat felt rough, a grave of words unspoken. 

My thoughts went straight to my father. My father was strong. I wasn’t. Almost two decades spent in the city had turned me soft, rounded my edges, dulled my instincts. My father, he was a beacon of a man, and yet he couldn’t protect Joanne. So what chance did I have?

Miranda waited, watching me like she already knew the answer. Her words snapped me out of my daze. “*Say something, this child is as much of your responsibility as it is mine,*” she urged in a stern tone.  “*I… I don’t know what to say,*” I admitted. “ *I didn’t plan to do this. I didn’t wa-*” I caught the words before I could utter something so vile.  “*I didn’t plan this either*,” she snapped, tears welling up. I just nodded. A half-assed agreement to stay. To help. To try.

Word got out faster than I could process it. That’s how it works in towns like Pilar, secrets are just stories waiting for judgement. Her parents came. The village captain came. And just like that, we were urged to tie the knot. “*It’s the right thing to do*,” they said. “*For the child. For its future.*”

I didn’t want it. God, I didn’t want it. But I said yes anyway. We got married under a tarp behind the chapel, surrounded by people I barely knew. The same people who’s eyes burned with judgement towards my mother and father years ago.  Miranda wore a simple white sundress that looked decades old. I wore a smile I had to force into place, like a flimsy sticker lousily stuck to my visage. Like I meant it. And as the guests walked towards me, each “*Congratulations*” muttered and each handshake felt heavier, crushing my soul piling on stone after stone. Pilar had stolen the happiest day of my life. Stolen my opportunity to actually say my vows wholeheartedly, to mean every word that I utter.

When I kissed her, my hands were shaking. The softness of her lips felt wrong against mine. We barely even touched before I broke away. I was disgusted at myself when I realized what I did. Be a man. I told myself. I looked out at the trees behind the chapel and felt like they were laughing at me. Like they’ve seen this before. Another sacrifice at the feast.  

When the applause died down and the food ran out, we were husband and wife. I trashed myself after the wedding ceremony with drink after drink of the cheap whiskey we had prepared for the guests. Miranda and I didn’t even enjoy our supposed honeymoon. I wanted to forget this moment. To quickly flip through this shitty fragment of time. But this was supposed to be a fresh chapter. A new mistake.

I was forced to sell my family’s farmland and the rest of the property. We built a small house with what little we had at the border of the village and its neighboring town. It was a semi-cemented cube with rusted roofing and hollow walls. The kind of place grief could settle into easily. Something temporary. Frail. We moved in, but deep down I knew, I didn’t want to. I did not love her. And I didn’t love that child either. Not yet, I thought. To me, they were responsibilities. Weighed down by duty and shame. We weren’t a family. We were strangers tangled into chaotic loops by the wretched hands of fate.

We had bought two pigs from the market, thick-bodied, greedy little things. I built them a pen behind the house. I had planned to sell them as soon as they were primed for the market, to make ends meet. I would tend to them every morning, cleaning the pen and making sure they had fresh clean water. I’m not going to lie, dealing with pig excrement revolted me, its nauseating scent sticking on to my nose long after I got rid of the things. I would do this every single day, trying to occupy the time I had. Trying to avoid contact with my “wife” as much as I could throughout the day. Miranda would feed them our leftovers every afternoon as I tended to our crops. We worked “together”, but not together. If that made sense.

Some nights I would hear the pigs squeal so loudly, like they were panicked, as if they were afraid of something outside of their pen. I wouldn’t bother to check, thinking it might just be a random cat or dog or other animal bothering the pigs. Nothing malicious, or so I thought. One morning, I found both of the pigs, dead. They were torn open, their bellies shredded, organs stripped clean. Their carcasses hung on the makeshift fence I made around their pen. The insides were scooped out with almost surgical precision. There was no blood on the ground. Just flies. Fat and skittish little parasites, feasting on hollowed spoiled corpses. The sweet rotted smell of death permeated as the wind blew.

“*What happened?*” Miranda asked. “*I don’t know. Must be some stray animal. Fucker ate all of their organs*,” I replied monotonously .”*Took their damned eyes too*.” “*W*\-w*hat kind of animal would do that?*” her voice shaky and uncertain. “*Miranda, I don’t know, but it’s best if you stopped looking and went inside. Now. I’ll take care of this.*” I tried to mask the fear in my voice, tried to hide the terror I felt. A pit in my stomach. I buried them alone. Regret brewing in my head. I threw away all I had, what money I had left, and this happened. My apparent investment down the gutter.

A few nights later, the noises began. Not the crickets. Not the neighborhood dogs. The type of noise that did not seem to belong. A noise that felt insidious. Screams. Not human screams either. Worse. Like something attempting to be human. Wailing, choking, and gurgling at the edge of the trees. Sometimes it sounded like laughter. A shrill crack in the air that didn’t seem innate.

“*Did you hear that?*” Miranda whispered one night, clutching her belly. “*Probably just a stray animal*,” I replied, trying to sound convincing. “*Go back to sleep. If it makes you a bit more comfortable, I’ll be by the door, I’ll keep watch.*” “*No, please, stay in bed with me . Hold me. I need you*.” she pleaded. I hesitantly wrapped her in my arms. “*You’ll be alright, we’ll be alright.*”

I felt that she didn’t believe me. I could tell by the way she clutched her belly tighter in her sleep, or the way her eyes flicked to the ceiling with the smallest change of the wind. There was a fear that was boiling inside, her motherly instinct sensing something was deeply wrong.

Small rashes and boils would develop on her stomach. They looked like gashes, like tiny claw marks being dragged across her skin and flesh. I assumed she was responsible for the rashes, assumed that maybe she started itching her stomach unknowingly as she slept. It got to the point where the gashes started bleeding and I had to hold her hands as we slept, trying to prevent her from making things worse.

Then came the sounds of scratching. At first it was faint, like farm mice clawing at old wood. But mice don’t scratch rhythmically, and they don’t pause when you whisper, “*Did you hear that?*” 

*Shrrkkt*

*Shrrkkt*

*Shrrkkt*

Sometimes it came from the roof. Sometimes from under the floorboards. Sometimes from the walls behind our bed. This happened on a nightly basis, to the point where my hearing had adjusted to it. I was getting used to something so sinister, so insidious.

At times I would wake up in the middle of the night to the sight of Miranda, standing near the window, eyes glossed over, slowly stroking at her stomach. She looked dazed, like something in the trees nearby were calling to her, beckoning her to come closer. I would, in my annoyance, take her by the hand and usher her back to bed, not a word shared between us.

One morning, I found a strange bundle tied to the door’s frame. Tied together with twine were bundles of garlic and strange herbs. It looked almost beautiful, like strange macabre bouquet. “*Miranda, did you put this thing here?”* I asked, the annoyance in my voice seeping through. “*This shit isn’t funny. What the fuck is this for anyway?*” “*To keep them out,*” she replied bluntly. “*Keep what out? What, you don’t trust me to be able to protect you? Is that it?”* my question sliced through the air like a razor through thin paper. “*That’s- that’s not  what I mean, I just feel unsafe lately. Things have been strange, and you know it.*” I opened my mouth, rearing my words, ready to argue. But I stopped myself at the very last moment. I grit my teeth and walked towards the house.

I couldn’t mask what was boiling up inside me. Insecurity. Uncertainty. Deep inside, I doubted myself. But my facade can’t fade. Not in front of her. Be a man. I slammed the door as I entered, jolting the fragile entirety of a house I could never call a home. I saw something in her eyes that was only growing. Fear. Not just of the strangeness around us, but a fear of being in a house with someone she can’t trust. Her eyes never met mine again after that.

The next day, I caught her burning old leaves in the corners of our home, muttering prayers under her breath. “*What are you doing?*” I asked. “*Just… precautions, we really don’t know what could be out there,*” she murmured. I sighed heavily and shook my head in a dismissive surrender. It was all foolish. All the unnecessary rituals, the strange effigies, the hollow prayers and chants. That night, I took the bundle of garlic and threw them into the fire she used to burn the old leaves. I got rid of those too. 

I watched the flames consume the strange sigil, the cloves of garlic hissed and popped, ash consuming every fiber, crimson veins eating through its crude structure. The smell was repugnant, like spoiled meat being burned. This was yet another mistake. Another domino. The skies above me seemed just a shade bit darker, not a trickle of light slipped through.

The air around us had shifted. Grew thick. Oily and heavy. Like Pilar itself was sweating something vile into the soil and into the air. In Miranda’s seventh month, the silence between us turned oppressive. Like the house itself was holding its breath, waiting for a dark impending crescendo to befall us. 

The heat became so unbearable. I took to sleeping on the floor just to be closer to the cooler cement. Miranda barely moved from the bed. Her face was always damp, her lips cracked, her breath shallow. We stopped speaking altogether. We just existed in parallel lines, breathing the same cursed air, but never touching.

I woke in the middle of another unbearable night. There was a sound. Initially it was soft, then it grew until it became deafening. A flapping, like a giant tarp caught in a typhoon. But this one was rhythmic. Deliberate. Like wings flapping in the sky. Enormous, leathery wings beating against the rusty roof. I sat up, my heart beating against my ribs like it wanted to escape me. I looked through the open bedroom door and inched a bit closer.

“*Miranda?*” I whispered. “*Hey, Miranda. Are you up?*” She didn’t stir. Then I heard something strange. Something so out of place, something repugnant.  A thick, wet sound of something sliding against a rough surface, followed by a soft tap, tap, tap against the bamboo rafters.

*Tap*

*Tap*

*Tap*

I realized where the sound was coming from. I looked up. And what I saw froze me dead in my tracks. Something black and glistening was descending from the ceiling. It was thick, fleshy, and sinewy. An unnaturally long appendage that looked like it was made out of putrid flesh and muscle.  Glossy and wet like the entrails of a freshly-butchered pig. It unspooled downward like a grotesque vine, the tip twitching, slowly separating at the tip into two dart-like edges.  It was hovering above Miranda’s belly.

I wanted to scream, but my throat seized. I couldn’t move. Couldn’t even blink. I just stared as the grotesque slithering strip lowered further, slowly, almost lovingly, reaching. Feeling for something. Maybe something inside Miranda. For a moment, I think I saw Miranda’s enlarged stomach almost bubble, like something within it shifted. A disgusting movement of flesh and skin. She stirred. The tongue snapped back upward in an instant, coiling into the darkness above with an abnormal and disgusting slap.

Miranda’s eyes opened. She gasped. Clutched her stomach. Something heavy crashed onto the roof. A skittering of what sounded like claws echoed through the roof, followed by a large whooshing sound. Then silence. I grabbed the machete by the door and ran outside barefoot. A strange feeling of sudden dread-fueled rage overtaking my senses.  I don’t know what I expected, maybe a stray animal, maybe a thief.

But when I looked up… There, hovering against the moonlight, its form silhouetted by the pale glow,  was the thing. Half of a woman. Its torso had torn off just below the waist, jagged flesh dangled where legs should’ve been, strings of intestine swinging like vile ropes. It had  bat-like wings stretching wide, each flap lifting it higher, keeping the creature aloft. 

For a moment, I thought I saw it face me. A visage so evil, so malevolent. My stomach stirred as it snarled a set of long and jagged teeth within a mouth that stretched too wide, like its jaw had been unhinged. It’s eyes yellow as bile, shaped like a feral cat’s. Its hair lulled clumsily as it flew, a thick and long raven entanglement of matted strands.  Whatever this thing was, it stretched the bounds of what could be human.

I shouted, raised the machete and swung at nothing but air. My body was running on pure crazed panic. The creature shrieked, an inhuman sound that split the air like metal tearing through stone. As it vanished into the trees, leaving a trail of dark drops of what I assumed to be its own blood, droplets of viscera scattered onto the emerald canvas of trees.

When I ran back inside, Miranda was screaming a blood-curdling shrill. An absurd amount of blood pooled beneath her, soaking through the mattress, slicking the floor. She looked at me with crazed eyes. I carried her out of the house. I carried her until we got to the next town over, my legs barely able to hold my body up, arms strained to point of numbness.  I don’t even remember the road. I only remember Miranda’s screams. Her unintelligible cries and pleas kept swimming in my head even after I handed her bloodied body over to the nurses at the clinic.

The clinic didn’t ask questions. But I saw fear in the eyes of everyone who witnessed us enter in a panic. The same deep fear I saw when one of the midwives approached me in the small clinic’s waiting area. Her lips trembled as she fought through the words. “T*he baby, it’s…*” she cleared her throat. “*What? Tell me*.” I urged the midwife. “*It’s still in her but…its head and part of its chest...it’s...their gone.*” The words horrified me. They conjured a mental image so gory and obscene that my stomach turned. I started to dry heave, my stomach punching into me like a heavy blow.  

After that incident, something in Miranda died. And maybe something in me did too. We came back to Pilar, but we weren’t the same. If we were parallel lines back then, now we’ve become oblique lines, skewing in our paths, never meeting. We didn’t talk. Didn’t touch. Days seemed to mold together. I slept on the floor again. She barely ate. We lived like ghosts, haunted by a child we never met and a thing we could never name. Sometimes I caught her standing by the window for hours, eyes fixed on the trees. Like she was waiting. Her hand over her belly, mourning a life she had never met.

I stayed. Not out of love. Not out of loyalty. I stayed because of the soul-splitting guilt. I stayed because I had nowhere else to go. Pilar had taken everything from me.

My best friend.

My sister.

My family. 

My pride. 

And now, a child I never even got to hold. My chance to be a father. If I were honest, I didn’t love the child. Not at first. Maybe not even near the end. But I could have. I started to learn to do so. I wanted to, at the very least. But whatever lurked in the deep woods of Pilar, it was unforgiving. It craved for my suffering. It wanted to bleed my soul dry, suck out any semblance of normalcy or serenity in my life.  

I am now fully held in the iron-clad grasp of Pilar. This wretched paradise. The one I used to call home. Its veneer of natural beauty chipping away before my eyes, and I had no way out. Something beneath my feet has already taken hold of me.

I felt as if there was nothing else to save, nothing else to salvage. This ship had already sunk before I could even have thought of patching the holes, before I even realized that I was aboard.  Whatever part of me that wanted to leave this place had died. It died slowly and painfully. And Pilar, it smiled. An evil wanting grin. It smiled as it watched my spirit bleed completely dry.
