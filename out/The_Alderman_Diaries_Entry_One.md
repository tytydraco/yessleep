My name is Lucy Alderman. I am currently 26 years old. I am being made to write all my experiences down by my therapist and psychologist for “self reflection and therapeutic purposes.” I personally don’t think it’ll work, I don’t see how writing down my feelings, keeping track of dates and times, and keeping track of incidents will help anything, but I’ll try anything at this point. I guess I should start at the beginning or what I personally think of as the beginning. 

It all started about six months or so ago. I was in an unfortunate accident. I took a tumble from the top of a steep gully, and fell about 100 feet or so. In addition to being thrown around like a rag doll, I got a really nasty concussion and lost my left eye. Thankfully I always had 20/20 vision and losing an eye wasn’t that hard. Unfortunately the concussion left me “brain dead and on life support” for over a month. Miraculously and lucky for me, the day they were set to cut me off life support was the day I woke back up. Technically I was pronounced dead at 3:40pm on Saturday, May the 23rd and remained dead for a solid five minutes. When I awoke of course there was a lot of freaking out and whatnot but I was none the wiser. The only permanent damage at the time seemed to be that I had lost my eye, acquired a bunch of nasty scars, and somehow wound up with mild amnesia. I, to this day have no idea what I was doing in those woods or what caused me to fall from that embankment, I just know that I did and my family and friends don’t like to talk about it. They seem to think keeping me in the dark does me some amount of good, but I beg to differ. Anyways that leads me into the big reveal. Something happened when I came back from the grave. I somehow have developed the ability to sense and talk to the dead. 

Surprise! Yes you read that correctly. I have, for the last 6 months, been able to commune with those who have passed on as well as see flashbacks of the past. How this all came to pass I couldn’t tell you. I just know that it did and I previously had no experience at all with the supernatural. Now I have to deal with all the people that tell me I have gone crazy and the ghosts that want to mess with me. Perhaps I have gone nuts, perhaps not; all I know is I see things, hear things, and know things that don’t make sense in a linear world. I hope and pray I’m wrong. I wish I was crazy then maybe all the pills I’m prescribed would help. As for what brought me here to write in the first place, I can now tell you with my little back story out of the way. 

This morning I woke up and started my normal morning routine of breakfast, consisting of coffee and pills, then hit the shower to wake myself up. While in the shower I heard a sound coming from my living room. I couldn’t make it out at first but I finished up, wrapped a towel around me, and headed out to see what had made the sound. To the side of the room I swear I saw something dart from the corner of my eye. My head snapped in that direction. At first I thought it was a trick of the light, maybe just a shadow and nothing more. That’s when I noticed my laptop open, light spilling onto the couch from the coffee table where it sat. 

I walked over and looked at what was on the screen. I had had it open on the weekly sale from my local grocery store. What was on the screen though was much different. It was an ad, for a little out of the way log cabin, nestled in the mountains in a rural town. A town I recognized all too well. It was the exact same town, mountain, and log cabin my family and I had been staying at when I took my big tumble. I don’t know how it got on the screen, but there it was. This wasn’t the only reminder I got from my accident. Days before I had gotten a postcard from the same town in the mail. It had been hand delivered; there was no postmark on the card. I couldn’t help but wonder why the universe seemed to want me to go back to that place where it all started. 

Something about that place seemed foreboding and dangerous. I desperately wanted to know what had happened to me that day in the woods, but I also dreaded the thought of going back. After sitting for what seemed like an hour, air drying in the living room, staring at the open screen, I made a decision to go back, and retrace my steps, and see if I could figure out once and for all what happened to me that night. I made the reservation on the laptop’s open page to stay for a week at the cabin. I hoped in that time I would be able to find out the truth. So I called out of work, my boss wasn’t happy, and booked a flight out west.

I’m sitting now on that flight taking the time to write this. Not so much to fill you guys in but to let you know that as I sit here in my seat I see a man, with blackened eyes, no whites, no color, just black eyes yellowed, crooked teeth, pale skin, and a smile that would turn your stomach upside down. Usually when I see those kinds of spirits….ghosts, whatever you want to call them. I know something is about to happen, something bad. I just watched as he walked into the wall, well, through it, and into the cockpit of the plane. I know something is about to happen. I think the plane is about to go down.
