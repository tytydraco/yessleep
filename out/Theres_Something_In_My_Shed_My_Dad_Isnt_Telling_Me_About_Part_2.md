A big thanks to everyone who left suggestions in the comments, I appreciate the concern for my well-being. I’m here to update you on everything that’s happened the last 2 days. 

It’s thanksgiving tomorrow, so yesterday, my dad went out to the store to pickup some food which is about a 25 minute drive. I was having a hard time deciding if I really wanted to know what I saw in my shed, but curiosity got the best of me, I just had to know. As soon as he left I began thoroughly searching for anything in the house that could give me some answers. Unfortunately I didn’t find anything of importance. The only thing I could find was a usb that read “Project-Q56” hidden behind my dads favorite painting. I just assumed that it was some old documents from before he retired, plus I didn’t want to waste anytime, so I put the usb back where I found it. I know most of you reading are screaming at me to view whatever is on the usb, but at the time I really didn’t think anything of it. I just figured it was business stuff.   

Before my dad left, he made an online pickup order for a bunch of thanksgiving foods. I even heard the notification go off when he arrived at the store and picked up the groceries. He ordered the usual stuff, corn, potatoes, stuffing, cranberry sauce, etc.. what weirded me out was… I’m not even lying when I say this, he ordered 3 turkeys. How many fucking people was he planning on having over? It was just me and my dad. His friends had their own families to attend to. The moment I said that I stopped. “Holy shit” I thought. I walked over to the back door window and looked at the shed. Nothing out of the ordinary. “No, the online order must’ve been a mistake.” I said to myself.  I feel like I was trying to connect dots that aren’t there. I couldn’t help myself, I needed an explanation. I pray to god he’s not feeding that thing.  

He arrived home with groceries. I offered to help, but instead he shouted at me and gave me a pissed off look so I just went inside. He’s just one of those old guys that are really easy to piss off, if you know what I mean. He probably wasn’t even mad at me but someone at the store or some idiot driver. I didn’t blame him for getting angry sometimes, he was a hard worker. But something was holding me back from telling him what I saw the day before. I felt like he was not telling me everything about that shed. But if it’s true, what will my dad do to me if I confront him? I’m not sure I want to take that chance. I have nowhere else to go and have nobody to take care of my dog. Was any of this real? I feel like I’m going crazy.  

I decided I was going to keep my mouth shut about it until I got some real evidence. I trust my dad, but I just have this gut feeling that something is wrong. Then just this morning my dad left a note on the fridge:“Hey Bud, I’m off to hunt for a turkey for our thanksgiving dinner tomorrow. I’ll be back before dark.”. Normally that would be a normal thing for him. We have a large property with plenty of space to hunt, but that note still left me feeling uneasy for more than one reason. The first being that I am almost positive that I saw he ordered 3 turkeys, whether it was intentional or just an accident, I’m not sure, but it was definitely on there. The second being that dad never used the word dinner, he’s called it supper ever since I was a kid. I know I’m 20 years old and I’m a man, I’m supposed to be strong, but I can’t lie this was freaking me the hell out. And Third being that dad was an avid hunter. Even I know that you can’t just kill a turkey and cook it the next day, it takes much longer than that. Nothing made any sense. I wasn’t usually one to question my own father but something about this whole situation felt wrong.  

It was around 12 pm, I kept thinking about that usb. I don’t want my dad to see me snooping but I felt like I had put back the only thing that might prove I’m not crazy and what I saw was real. So while he was still outside hunting I decided I was going to plug in the usb and take a look. That was a terrible mistake…   

I plugged the usb into my laptop in my room. I expected the flash drive to be encrypted but to my surprise there was no password. Three separate folders were present so I decided to take a look. They were all labeled “NSX(#)”. I looked at the first two, but both were empty, maybe they’re encrypted? I did however, find contents in folder “NSX3”. A text file and some sort of odd application. My first thought was to read the text because I was unsure what the application did. The note began by saying “I ADVISE ANYONE WHO IS READING THIS FILE TO DO SO IN A PRIVATE SETTING, AS THIS INFORMATION SHOULD NOT BE PUBLIC.” Before I could continue reading I heard 3 loud gunshots coming from outside. I assumed it was dad but the sound seemed awfully close to the house. I walked over to my bedroom window and started choking on the coffee I made earlier. Maybe I was being paranoid, but the shed door was wide open. I could see the lock on the ground, it was in pieces. I just stood there for about 10 minutes, staring at the empty shed, the door wide open. I think seeing that creature was easier to look at than this. “Did it escape?” I thought. I could see myself in the mirror to the right, I was as white as a ghost.   

I began to hear knocking at my door, though I didn’t answer. I just stood there silently, pretending I wasn’t there. Then more knocking. I figured it was my dad at first but they didn’t say anything. I didn’t want anyone knowing I was in there just in case they were intruders or something. The doorknob began to turn slowly. Luckily I have 2 different locks on my bedroom door, the normal one on the doorknob and a hook and eye latch I installed a few years ago. So I was sure they weren’t getting in without a fight. The knocking and jiggling of the doorknob lasted for about 30 minutes. I thought it was odd someone wouldn’t just try kicking the door down if they really wanted to get in. After sitting silently in the corner for what felt like hours I eventually fell asleep. I guess I slept for a long time because it’s now 9 pm. I can’t call the police or my dad because I don’t want to make any noise, I don’t want whoever is on the other side to hear me.   

Tomorrow I think I’m going to pack some stuff up, grab my dog, and get the hell out of here. There’s no chance whoever was knocking at my door is just waiting for me on the other side and I’m not just going to leave my dog, I’m better than that. Of course I need to find my dad too but I’m hoping when I go down there I see him just watching tv, eating breakfast. It could just be my dad fucking with me. His generation has a sense of humor where sometimes they mess with you, and you can’t really tell if they’re joking, you know? I hope all of this has just been my dad playing pranks but I can’t help but think that there really is a creature in that shed. I just hope to god it’s not in this house with me right now. Has anyone had any similar experiences? I need advice. Also to those of you who said to buy a security camera, I have one coming in the mail. I’m still going to try to get the hell out of here but I’ll try setting up my camera here when it arrives. What should I do about the usb? Should I continue reading and run the program?
