The day was hot. Roasting. The sky was a blazing bright light that shined above me. School time had come to an end and I was making my way home. Passing through suburban streets the sun seemed to lower even further gleaming, burning my eyes. Heat immediately punctured my skin and forced me to remove my jumper. As I stuffed the jumper deep into my schoolbag I noticed someone further along the street. Preceding forward, not too far away from my house I saw him.



He helplessly stood seeing off sweat that was dripping rapidly from his forehead. The man was small although a lot taller than my twelve year old self he was small for a grown man. The closer I approached the more I could make him out through the summer air. He appeared old, having graying hair and wrinkly, leathery skin. His arms and legs were swarmed with varicose veins. Nearing the old man he turned to me and smiled. A charming, innocent grin grew and I gave one back. His face, smiling, he looked friendly, looked like a decent person. To go along with his jolliness he had a huge hanging belly. He would make for a perfect cast as Santa Clause if he grew out his beard. I continued onward, approaching my house. Then I heard him desperately call out to me. 



“Oh dear.” He said in a high pitch tone, obligating my head to turn. 



“ So sorry to bother but can you help an old timer out?”



“Okay what do…” Before I could even finish my sentence the old man interrupted. 

“You see I've managed to drop my only screwdriver down there and I don't have the back in me anymore to reach down and grab it. Do you mind dear?” 



“No, not at all.” I replied



“Oh thank you, thank you so much dear, you see it's quite far in there.” 



He pointed with a crooked, yellow stained finger to below the wide, white van that had only now revealed itself to me. I looked at him with an unintentional look of concern. He reassured me by saying “Just down there.” Still pointing. 



I crouched down touching the concrete ground still keeping eye contact with the kind old man. He was licking his lips. Breaking my gaze I poked my head in under the van. The surrounding light still shined bright but only darkness could be seen under. Shaded shadows surrounded me the further I leaned inside. I couldn't see the screwdriver, I reached forward attempting to grab something, swaying my hand left and right I only felt the thick warm air.



 “Sorry I can't see it.”



“ I told you it's deep in there.” He chuckled. 



Practically beneath the mammoth metallic van, claustrophobic and scared of the ever growing blackness, I retreated back to the light. Crawling backward I could only see two stumped legs. 



“I can't find it.” There was no answer from the old man. “Mister, I'm scared.” Still there was no answer. The back van door was pulled open like a train speeding past. Then, now I knew there was no screwdriver.



The first thing he grabbed was my hair, tearing me out from underneath the van. My yelps of pain and panic were soon silenced as he put his gross, greasy hands over my mouth, pressing down on my nose making it impossible to breathe. His other hand soon found my throat and in one sporadic motion he threw me inside through the swinging back door of the van. 



Nothing was inside the van except me, no tools, no steps, no screwdriver or anything that a tradesman would use, only me. I sat there trying to gather the air back into my lungs as the old man hurried inside the van starting it. He sped off heading straight forward. For a mere moment reality stood still, I honestly had an outer body experience commencing with myself. Linda, he's taking you away from your family. Linda, he's going to hurt you.  Linda, you're going to die if you don't do something. Linda SCREAM!!! And that's exactly what I did. I screamed. Roared at the top of my lungs, screeching, bursting eardrums, wailing, bagging the side of the van. I yelled for my freedom. Suddenly not too long after I decided to have an outburst of shouts the van came to a halt. He stopped the Van in the middle of the road. He calmly slid the door open, letting in total sunshine. The friendly old man's face had become mean, cold, lifeless. I flew out the van running away. He simply drove off, not speeding or driving like a maniac, he just drove off. 



This is where my memory becomes fuzzy. I must have made it back home, walking god knows how far. My mother tells me I came inside like nothing happened. I didn't talk for the whole day and when this continued into the night she knew something was wrong. She took me to the hospital that very night. I had torn my vocal chords and bruised my throat and lungs. As disturbing as it is, pain never felt so good. Next thing I can remember is writing on a piece of paper, answering the policeman's questions. I still don't know if they caught him. 



Today I am a fifty year old woman with kids of my own. Nobody knows of this story besides me and my mom. I felt like if I shared this or for better put it out into the world it would take this stain, this heavy weight of me. I'm not sure if it will, I guess we'll need to wait and see. But if there is anything to take away from this I would say When you see a friendly face think to yourself what's truly underneath it.
