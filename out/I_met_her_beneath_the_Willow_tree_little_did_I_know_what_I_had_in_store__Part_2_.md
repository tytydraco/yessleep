Later that evening after spending an entire day to myself, avoiding my house like the plague so I could keep up the illusion I set up, I made my way back to the tree, this time from a different direction. The other way into the forest was from a park right around the corner to my house. I spent most of the day there, sitting on the swings quietly pondering to myself all of the different things I wanted to talk to Willow about. Once I made it to the tree, I did a quick circle around the clearing, looking in every direction just to make sure she wasn't already there. 

After my search ended to no avail I sat by the tree with my back towards the house, looking in the direction I saw her leave that morning, hoping to see her arrive the same way. I sat for what felt like hours, before I heard footsteps quietly approaching from behind. 

“Willow?” I turned around swiftly, excited but startled, to see her standing there, her arms crossed and her face somber. She was in the same clothes as earlier and looked cold. By this point the sun had started to go down again and the air was beginning to freeze. 

“Everything alright? You look freezing.” 

“Yeah I’m fine.” She said timidly. Suddenly I realized that both of the times I’d seen her at that point she didn't have anything to keep herself warm, or even a different outfit than what she had on. Her tattered short sleeved shirt and overalls was all she seemed to own. 

“Here, dont object please,” I said as I handed her my coat. The inside was wool lined and the outside was slick to keep water off. It was my fathers coat. He lent it to me a few nights before he died and it had just barely begun to fit me well enough. It was a bit long but It didn't bother me. “I can bring you one you can keep tomorrow, I might have some spare hoodies I can do away with.” 

She took the coat hesitantly and threw it on. Her hands were hidden in the sleeves and the Hem fell just below her knees. 

“Sorry it's a bit big. It was my dads.”

“It's okay, thank you.” She smiled, and immediately looked warmer. 

She sat down against the tree, the cloth of my coat made a swishing sound as it slid across the bark. 

“Everything alright? You seem sad.”

“It's okay really, I've just been thinking.”

“About what?” I asked curiously. 

“Well, I really enjoy talking to you. Nobody has ever talked to me kindly before. Actually, nobody has really ever talked to me.”

“Why's that?” 

She looked up nervously and then back down. I traced where her eyes were aimed and noticed the same Raven from earlier, looking down at us with its eerie gaze. 

“Mother has kept me pretty sheltered my entire life. I've never been to school, or a party or anything like that. I was always told that other kids were going to bully me and I wasn't going to be accepted. So I learned the ways of the world by reading stories. She would send me on grocery runs, and with whatever money I had left I’d attempt to buy a book or two to see what I could learn from them, and to keep me company.” 

“Oh, I'm sorry to hear that,” I said, not knowing what else would be appropriate at the moment. The more I learned about her the more puzzled I became. Some things just didn't seem to add up. “Does your mom work a lot?” I asked, worrying that it might've been insensitive to ask.  

“No. She doesn't have a job, and neither do I. We have a bunch of money stored away from when my father passed years ago. I don't know much about him, but he had a lot of money that he kept sealed away just in case something happened, but we've been using it for years, and it's starting to run out so we have to be careful.” 

“I understand that. I lost my father too. We weren’t rich by any means when he died but we had enough, but now that he's gone my mom has to work a lot to keep us afloat.” 
I looked at my watch. The time read 4:45. It was almost time for me to leave. Willow looked up at me and smiled, a small lone tear rolled across her face. This deeply saddened me, but also, assured me that I had made a friend. 

“I hate to say it but I should probably be going soon.” I said begrudgingly. 

“Before you go, I was going to say before, I've been thinking about your offer earlier.”

“To come see Maple?” When I said it, I didn't really think it was serious enough for her to shed a tear over, but obviously it meant something deeper to her. 

“Yeah. I'd like to sometime if that's okay. I'll just have to be careful mother doesn't find out.” 

“Yeah for sure, how about tomorrow? Or is that too soon?” I asked excitedly. 

“That's fine.” 

“Does 3:00 work? I can meet you here or you can meet at my house, my mom will be perfectly okay with it as long as I let her know. I only lied to her today because I didn't know how to tell her who I was hanging out with. 

“You don't have to lie about me.” Willow said, a quiet sternness in her voice. 

“I know, I just hesitated and didn't know what to say so I lied. It was mainly so she didn't bother me about wanting to hang out with a girl. You know how parents are.” 

“I guess. You're sure she's not going to be mad if I'm there?”

“No no, she'll appreciate the company. It's pretty lonely at my house.” 

“Okay, you'll see me at 3.” 

“Sounds good. I gotta go now, sorry to rush off. See you tomorrow.” 

“Bye Everett.” 

As she stood up from the tree, she took off my coat and held it out to me. 

“Wait!” she called. 

I turned around and saw her holding the coat. I stopped briefly and smiled. “Keep it for the night, I'll give you another tomorrow.” 
Before I turned to part ways I noticed another tear roll down her face, but this time she was smiling. 

It wasn't until later that night that I realized that meeting with Willow sparked something in me. It invoked a sense of hope that I had not felt in a long time, sense of purpose and contentment. Which I know is an odd emotion to feel as a young teenager, but I'd struggled my entire life up to that point with the idea that things would always stay the same. With my Mothers sudden shift in mood and talking to Willow, having her open up to me, and shedding a tear simply because I talked to her, made me remember that there's always a silver lining to everything, that nothing ever stays the same forever. 

I opened my back door at exactly 5:00 Pm. My mother was in the kitchen, cooking quietly to herself. She turned around and smiled when I stepped inside. 

“There you are. I was beginning to worry you were going to be late. Again.”

“I was watching the time. I knew you'd be waiting.”

“You better have. Dinner’s almost done.”

“What are you making?” I asked, the smell made my stomach growl suddenly.

“My famous southwest Chile. Extra spicy just the way you like it.” 

My heart stopped for a second. She hadn't made her famous chili since the night my Father died. I didn't know what to think. Her sudden shift had caught me off guard. From the groceries being put away to the chili, something had changed and I could feel it deeply.

“You haven't made that since…” I hesitated to finish my sentence as I sat at the table. 

“I know. You don't have to say it. The truth is Everett, We can't live like this forever, and I figured what better time than now to change things. I had a little bit of a rough patch I know, and I'm sorry for that.” 

“It's okay Mom.” 

“It's really not. I shouldn't be telling you this now but I almost gave up. I almost let go, and it made me realise I was letting go of the wrong thing. I need to be the grown up and give you the life you deserve, and if that takes bearing my feelings no matter how dark they get then that's what I'm going to do.” 

Her confession buried itself deep inside my heart, and made my stomach twist. I knew what she meant, and it made me realize the truth behind why she had been the way she was, at least deeper than I already knew. I failed to respond and just sat at the table in silence as she set down my bowl of chili. 

“Sorry for throwing that at you all at once. I felt like I owed you an explanation. Anyways, how was your day?” 

“It was interesting.” 

“Did something happen?” 

“Well yeah but not really. Can I be honest?” 

“Of course kiddo.”

“I didn't go out with friends all day like I said. You know I don't have any.” 

“Oh don't talk like that. What did you do all day then, and why couldn't you tell me?” 

“Well, I think I have a friend now. I met her the other day.”

“Oh.” she said, a little surprised and a little confused. 

“I didn't tell you because she's a girl and I worried that you wouldn't leave me alone about it if I told you.” 

“Oh hon, I wouldn't have made fun of you or even been mad. You know my rules and I trust you so I have nothing to worry about. Can you tell me about her?” 

“Yeah a little bit. I don't know much about her yet.”

“That's fine.”

“Well, I met her when I was chasing Maple the other night after she ran off, and I found her again today so we hung out for a while.” 

“Interesting, what was she doing out in the forest that late?” 

“I don't really know. Maple heard her singing and I think that's what made her run off. I found her sitting by this big willow tree all alone. We talked for a second and then I had to run home.” 

“That's weird.” 

“I assume she lives close to us but she hasn't told me where. We just keep meeting at the tree.” I hesitated to say the last bit, worried I was sharing a little too much. 

“Is she nice? What's her name?” 

“She's nice, her name is Willow.”

“That's funny that you met her at a Willow tree.” 

“I know, she was named after it, kind of how we chose Maple's name. I actually invited her over tomorrow if that's okay. She wanted to see Maple again.” 

“Oh yeah that's perfectly fine, did she want to stay for dinner?”

“I'm not sure. She seemed a little nervous when I asked if she wanted to come over so I thought it would be better if you asked when she's here.” 

“Yeah, I'll be sure to make extra just in case. Anything specific you want me to make?” 

“Not really. Whatever you want to.” 

“Alright. I'll be sure to make it good.”

I smiled and noticed my chili was gone. I didn't even realize I'd eaten it. I stood up, cleared my bowl and rinsed it out in the sink. Since it wasnt that late, we decided to sit down and watch a movie. She pulled a disc from her purse as she sat down and handed it to me to put in the DVD player. It was Halloween. Not the original but the David Gordon Green remake. At that point I had never seen either of them. The only rated R movie I had seen was Alien, which I had watched on my own because I was curious; coincidentally enough I ended up loving it. 

I put the disc in the DvD player and sat down next to my Mom. 

“This one okay?” She asked. 

“Yeah it's perfect.” I responded, curious to see what I was in store for. 

After the movie ended, we said goodnight and I headed up to bed. It was an alright movie, nothing that kept me up at night or anything. Horror movies have never really scared me. I liked Michael Myers and I ended up checking out the rest of the movies a few years later. 
The next day was mostly forgettable. I remember getting up and struggling to find something to do. The anticipation of seeing Willow again ate at me from inside, making me antsy and sporadic. Eventually I settled on taking Maple on a walk and for some reason reading a book. At this point in my life I think I had only read maybe 3 books in my 13 years of life. I pulled one off my shelf that my mom had bought me for a school project that I never finished. It was short and not very good to be completely honest. I might like it more now but at the moment I could not appreciate it the way it was probably intended. 

The time ticked by slower and slower as 3 O’clock loomed nearer. I paced my room, watching out the window hoping maybe Willow would suddenly appear, in her green shirt and grass stained overalls, smiling up at me from the edge of the yard. Scenarios danced in my head, pushing out any ounce of negativity I had in the moment. It was a strange feeling. It was uplifting yet overwhelming. It was almost like my thoughts were locked in a race against my emotions with no chance of reaching the finish line. Everytime I pictured her face or her voice, I would freeze wherever I was and disappear into the same trance as before. It was, to be honest, frightening in every sense of the word. 
Eventually after what felt like decades waiting for the clock to turn over and the beginnings of dinner appearing on the counter, I told my mom I was headed out to pick up Willow. I ventured to the woods once again. I was excited but a part of me felt scared. After the arduous day of anticipation, I had begun to worry if she was going to be there at all. What if she had forgotten? What if her mom kept her home? Were the kinds of questions I started to ask myself, as I stepped recklessly through the brush. 

I reached the tree, just as my watch beeped, signifying it was now officially 3 O’clock. The sun was still out so the tree cast an ominous shadow upon the ground. It stood before me, bare and pale, the trunk twisting into the canopy of the leafless forest. As I stood before it, belittled once again by its intimidating stature, nervousness began to take over any sense of excitement. The frozen ground made loud crunches as I stepped over my own feet with anxiety. I could feel the seconds tick by as I waited, the cold nipped at my ears and my nose, and combined with nervousness it got increasingly difficult to stand still. 

Her footsteps were inaudible over my own, and when she appeared from behind the tree, I almost jumped out of my skin. 

“Hi Everett!” She said excitedly. 

“Oh uh- hi.” I stopped prancing and attempted to collect myself after such a scare. “You scared me!” 

“I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.” She immediately became shy and crossed her arms. 

“It's okay really. It was a pretty good scare. Say, how did you do that?” 

“Do what?” 

“Appear behind the tree that fast, without me seeing you.” 

“Uhm… you were distracted I guess. I didn't think I was being that sneaky.”

“Yeah, I probably was. That makes sense.” I knew damn well I was distracted. “My moms got dinner going, it'll probably be a minute so we'll have plenty of time to do whatever before it's ready.” 

“Okay. Are you still sure it's okay that I come over?” 

I noticed her demeanor seemed different that day. She was off and on like usual, but that day she seemed like something was on her mind, like something bad had happened the night before.

“Yeah it's still fine, I've just been waiting anxiously all day.”

“Really?”

“Yeah I had nothing better to do. To be honest I didn't want to do anything else.” 

She looked at her worn out shoes, staring for a second before looking back at me, smiling. Her smile seemed genuine and I couldn't help but smile back. 

“Hey Willow, before we go, is everything okay?” I couldn't stop myself from asking, something just seemed off. 

“Yeah I’m fine I guess, just nervous.”

“It's alright, I am too, not for the same reasons as you of course.”

“What are your reasons?” She asked with an innocent curiosity. 

“Oh uhm…” I debated heavily whether I told her the truth and eventually settled on the 
thought that nothing bad could happen if I did. 

“Uh, cause of you. I'm not nervous in a bad way, just to be more clear.”

She smiled shyly and looked back at her feet and then past me towards my house. “I know what you mean.” 

“Okay good.” I laughed quietly as the awkwardness began to settle in my stomach, I suddenly felt weighed down and out of breath. Willow stared towards the treeline and without warning started walking towards my house, her hand held out behind her beckoning me to follow. 

I ran to catch up, she looked back at me, and then at the sky as she walked. When I finally caught up, I tapped her hand with a light high five and she dropped it to her side, the sleeves of my coat fell past her fingertips, making her look much smaller than she was. 

“Don't let me forget to grab you one of my spare coats.” I said suddenly remembering the promise I made the night before. 

“I won't.” She turned back once more with an appreciative smile. 

We got to the back door and at that point I made it in front of her to open the door for her. I let her inside and showed her where to leave her shoes and coat. She hesitantly took her shoes off and set them by the back door. I took my own shoes and left them next to hers. My Mom was in the kitchen still prepping dinner. She usually took a while to make dinner but that night she was slow and meticulous, and I could tell just by the smell she was making my favorite dinner. My favorite dishes have changed over time, but the one dish I can still say tops them all, is my moms famous lemon grilled chicken and pasta. She makes it very carefully each time, adding her own special flavors that no one could ever replicate.
Eventually I showed Willow to the table so I could introduce her to my mom. 

“Mom, say hi to Willow.” I said to get her attention away from her cooking. 

Her head spun around and her concentrated face immediately turned to a sincere smile. “Oh hi Willow, nice to meet you!” 

“Nice to meet you too, I like your apron.” she said, eyeing my moms flower adorned apron; the same one she still wears to this day. 

“Why thank you!” She took the apron off and set it on the counter before sitting down at the table, leaving her pot on the stove to boil. She could tell Willow was uneasy so she flashed her an assuring smile. Willow shyly smiled back. I could tell she didn't really know what to think of the situation. 

“Alright, my pot’s boiling now. Don't be afraid to make yourself at home.The only scary thing here is Maple.” she laughed softly and stood up returning to the stove and adorning her apron. 

“I like Maple. She's nice.”

“Usually she hates people. I'm glad she warmed up to you so quickly!” 

Willow smiled, and turned to me, I could tell she was uneasy but trying her best to be calm. “It's still light out, We can go play with Maple for a bit like I promised. If you still want to, of course.”

“Yeah that's okay.” she stood from her chair and pushed it in as tenderly as she could. 

“I'll call you in when dinner is ready. Should be about 30 more minutes. It's a bit earlier tonight since I figure Willow should be home at a decent hour.” 

“I appreciate that.” Willow said, I felt her anxiety begin to slow down and her voice started to project more. 

“You're very welcome, now you two go have fun, don't worry about the food till it's done!” 

I spent about 15 minutes on a scavenger hunt for one of my spare coats. It had ended up in the wash the night before without me knowing, so I awkwardly drug Willow on a tour of my house frantically searching for what felt like an eternity. Eventually I found it and she tried it on. It fit her much better than the one I gave her previously. 

“It's yours now!” 

“Thank you, I'll keep it extra safe. In case you need it back.” 

“Don't worry, I won't need it back.” 

Right then I saw her smile, not just any smile, but a smile of genuine happiness. It was as if she had just found her most prized possession after years of being lost in a mysterious land only god knows. I froze in place for a second as her hypnotizing gaze met my eyes and I couldn't help but fall back into the trance. 

“Everett?” 

I shook my head violently, shaking off her spell. 

“Sorry.” I laughed awkwardly, and broke eye contact. “Maple!” I yelled to break the awkwardness. I heard her come bouncing down the stairs, her tail wagging and hitting the walls with enough force to shake the pictures on the walls. 

The three of us made our way back outside. The cold air bit at our noses but we didnt care. Willow chased maple around the entire yard, running circles over and over in an attempt to retrieve the ball Maple had stolen from her. My mom opened the window to call us in for dinner right as the sun was starting its descent below the horizon. Willow ran with Maple inside. They were in such an intense chase that Willow failed to notice that Maple dropped the ball as they went inside. It rolled down the steps of the porch and into the grass which for some reason was now full of yellow wildflowers. I grabbed the ball and looked around the yard before stepping inside. The flowers outlined the exact path that Willow and Maple had traced around the yard, turning the dull frozen grass into a beautiful yet slightly frightening tapestry of yellow as bright as the sun. 

I went back inside and shed my layers. The aroma of lemon chicken spread throughout the entire house. It's not an unpleasant smell, but it can be overpowering sometimes. Dinner was served and we sat quietly eating slowly. Willow was unsure about the meal but tried it anyway. After some time she seemed like she was enjoying it, at least from what I could tell. My mother was the first to break the silence.

 “So Willow, I hear you live not too far from here.” she said as she took her last bite of chicken. 

“Uhm yeah, I'm not far.” 

“I noticed you're wearing one of Everett’s coats, I’m very proud to see he treats you properly already.” she said, smiling at me. 

“Yeah, he's been really nice.” I could tell by the vagueness of her answers that she was trying her hardest to not overshare while also being courteous.

“I don't want to pry with too many questions but I can't help my curiosity, do you go to the same school?” she glanced at me and then back at Willow. 

“No, she's-” I stopped my sentence when I heard Willow respond. I didn't want to overshadow her. 

“I'm homeschooled. Mother teaches me most things, and I learn alot from reading.”

“Oh interesting, I actually debated about homeschooling Everett for a while, but I'm a teacher so I figured I would just keep him in my class through elementary school. I shifted grades each year so he would stay in my class.” 

“Mother mostly teaches me how to write and improve my reading. I know alot about nature too, she doesn't let me get away with not learning about it.” 

My mom looked intrigued, in the same way I was about Willow's story. Something about her was eerily mysterious. 

“So Everett tells me you meet at the Willow tree out back. It's the middle of January. Why don't you guys start meeting here? That way you don't freeze to death waiting for him. He can be slow sometimes!” She laughed and I shot her a look of disapproval. 

“He gave me this coat, I think it should be warm enough.” 

“Oh, is he letting you keep it?” she looked at me questioningly.

“Yeah!”

“Why's that?”

“She uh, doesn't own one.” 

“Well, I’m glad you're being thoughtful of her situations. I was watching you guys while making dinner and you've been awfully kind to her. That's how I know I raised you right.” 

“Ms, uh…” 

“Oh Hon, you can call me Laura.”

“Ms. Laura, thank you for the dinner. It was really good.” 

“Your welcome Hon, your welcome to eat with us anytime you’d like. I always have enough.”

“Thank you.” Her eyes turned to me and I could tell she was ready to leave. 

“One more thing before Everett takes you home, I noticed some bruises on your arms. I apologize for bringing it up, I can't ignore my motherly instincts.”

“Oh uhm, they’re nothing to worry about. I just ran into some branches pretty hard the other night going home from the tree.” 

I knew immediately that story was far downplayed from the truth I would find out just a few days later. 

“Oh okay, if you need anything you can tell me. Any friend of Everetts is like family here. Everett, why don't you walk her all the way home tonight, it's dark out now so I'd hate for her to walk alone.” 

I looked at Willow seeking approval. She nodded and smiled at my mother. 

“Thank you, Ms. Laura!” she said with the same appreciative tone she expressed when I gave her the coat. She stood from the table and pushed in her chair. I quickly followed suit and met her at the back door after putting my coat on. 

“You're gonna go through the woods?” 

“I live on the other side, it's the easiest way to get there.” 

“Alright, stay close to each other and be safe. Bring a light!” 

I made sure to grab my flashlight before we set out. Willow jumped in front of me practically running out the door, her hand trailing behind her, reaching for mine.
