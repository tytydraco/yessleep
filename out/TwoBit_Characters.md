BE-DE - BOOP. BOP!

It's not bad to see them. Not bad, but not good.

The man in the cheap chequered suit wearing a hat a few sizes larger than his scrawny shoulders is lifting a wallet from a drunken youth walking a dame away from a recent flicker. He dips his hand in one frozen moment BLINK gone then back, in profile, moving away to the right of your vision.

BE-DE - BOOP. BOP!

It's later, whenever. There's a dame in a yellow and white polka dot dress leaning over a young girl at a bus stop. She steals the girl's handbag and moves away to the left, out of your line of sight.

Why were you even here?

I stopped taking the cytochrome they gave me years ago. IT DID STOP THE NOISES! But I found the noises make it easier to spot them, and it was usually other-wise choral music that was relaxing & not stressful at all.

But the sounds- BE-DE - BOOP. BOP!

I saw one get hit by an automobile it went BLERT.

The sounds are good.

They are cheap, cheap beings, I do not know what they get from taking from the poor, but they do. Nobody can see them, they know how to walk sideways and then towards.

BUT THAT IS GOOD!

When they are walkING sideways they can be seen, silhouette wise in profile like a fucking mug shot that's never going to happen because THEY'RE TOO CHEAP TO BE CAUGHT. you can see them, and they can not see you- predator eyes, facing forwards. Always.

WHEN YOU CAN NOT SEE THEM IS WHEN THEY are closer I do believe they have other senses- --- they are looking straight at you. maybe there. maybe right in front of you. 

throw. away. everything you have.

It's the only way.

I think they take more than just tawdry possessions I think they might just might be taking everything but I do not know. I HAVE NO IDEA 

YOU CAN cut them up with doors. Go inside anywhere you have to right now, invited or not even if you have to break it down. Jamm the doors back solid and shut, whip your head around, kill anyone else around you, they can move quickly but are befangled by impediments and changes in latitude - climb higher. Then go back down a different way. 

BE-DE - BOOP. BOP!

This is the sound they make when they turn around, I know this as a fact. 

Police are useless. Hotels are good. Get to a hotel and lie. You just need to get into a lift because lifts can take you to a floor of long corridors, and this is good. 

I should have told you about hotels first, that is OK.

BE-DE - BOOP. BOP!

Listen for that noise it means they are turning around. And that means they are looking for you. You have not dropped everything of value to those two bit characters.

Stand flat against a door in the middle of the longest hallway and stand there. Keep standing there. Keep listening. I do not know what they take but it must be more than it seems.

That is all I know.
