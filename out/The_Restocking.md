I work the graveyard shift at a 24-hour grocery store. Most people think it’s mind-numbing, and they’re right. But it pays, and the work is straightforward: stock shelves, clean floors, handle the occasional customer who can’t sleep either.

The weird part started three weeks in.

Every night around 2 AM, I’d find items on the shelves that weren’t there when I’d restocked them hours earlier. Not misplaced items. New items. Products we didn’t carry. Things that shouldn’t exist in our inventory.

The first time, I found a can of soup in aisle 4. The label was yellowed, the font old-fashioned, from maybe the 1950s. I checked our system. We’d never ordered it. The product code didn’t exist in any database I could access.

I showed it to Derek, the overnight manager. He looked at the can for a long time without touching it.

“Put it back,” he said.

“Back where?”

“Wherever you found it. It’ll be gone by morning.”

It was. The next night, the shelf was empty. No can. No trace.

I told myself it was a prank. Someone’s idea of a joke. But Derek’s reaction suggested otherwise. He knew something about those products.

So I started watching.

I’d restock a section carefully, marking off my sheet, making sure everything was accounted for. Then I’d work another aisle. Thirty minutes later, I’d come back to the first section and find new items had appeared. Always old products. Always with that yellowed, vintage look.

A jar of mayonnaise from 1967. A box of crackers with a design that looked like it was from the 1970s. A bottle of hot sauce with a label I’d never seen before.

I asked Derek about it directly one night.

“What are these products?” I said. “Where are they coming from?”

He was organizing returns at the customer service desk. He didn’t look up.

“Don’t worry about it,” he said.

“But they’re on the shelves. People could buy them. They could be expired, they could be—”

“Nobody buys them,” Derek said quietly. “That’s the thing. They appear. They sit there for a shift. Then they’re gone. Nobody touches them. Not customers, not us. They just… exist for a while, and then they stop.”

“That doesn’t make sense.”

“No,” he agreed. “It doesn’t.”

I wanted to ask more, but a customer came up to the counter, and Derek turned his attention to them. The conversation was over.

But now I was paying attention.

I started timing it. Every night, between 2:15 and 2:45 AM, new products would appear. Never the same items twice. Never in the same location. But always with that same vintage quality. Always products that didn’t exist in our system.

And they were always in places I’d just finished restocking.

One night, I decided to test something. I spent an hour carefully organizing aisle 3. Cereals, from left to right, newest to oldest. I wrote down every single item. I took a photo on my phone.

Then I went to do another section. I came back after exactly thirty minutes.

On the shelf, between the Lucky Charms and the Frosted Flakes, was a cereal box I’d never seen before. It was dusty. The cardboard was brittle. The mascot on the front—some kind of cartoon animal—looked like it hadn’t been drawn since the 1980s.

I picked it up carefully. The box felt fragile, like it might crumble in my hands.

There was a price sticker on the bottom. It said $1.29. The date on the sticker was from 1994.

I called Derek over.

“Look at this,” I said.

He examined the box without touching it. His face had gone a specific kind of pale.

“How long was it there?” he asked.

“I don’t know. I was gone for thirty minutes.”

“Okay,” he said, and his voice was very controlled. “Okay. Here’s what you’re going to do. You’re going to put that box back on the shelf. You’re not going to tell anyone about it. And you’re not going to mention this to corporate if they ever call asking questions. Understand?”

“Derek, what is this? What’s happening?”

“It’s the store,” he said. “The store does this. It’s always done this. The previous manager told me about it when I started. The manager before him told him. It goes back… I don’t know how far back it goes.”

“Does this?” I asked. “Restocks itself with vintage products?”

“No,” Derek said. “It doesn’t restock itself. Something uses the restocking as cover. When we’re moving products, reorganizing, making space… something adds things to the shelves. Old things. Things that have been around for a very long time.”

“Why would it do that?”

Derek finally looked at me directly.

“I think the store is hungry,” he said. “I think it’s hungry for products that don’t exist anymore. Products that stopped being made. Stopped being sold. Stopped being remembered. And it reaches back somehow and brings them here, just for a moment, just so they can exist again in a store, on a shelf, the way they’re supposed to.”

“That’s insane.”

“Yes,” Derek agreed. “It is. But you’ve seen it now. You can’t unsee it.”

That night, I paid very close attention to the vintage products.

Most of them lasted until morning, when the day shift arrived. But a few of them—maybe one in five—would vanish mid-shift. I’d turn my back, restock another section, and when I came back, the item would be gone. Not sold. Just absent.

And there would be a gap on the shelf where it had been.

One morning, before my shift ended, I checked one of those gaps.

Where the vintage item had been, the shelf was completely empty. But not dusty. Not neglected. It looked like the space was waiting for something.

I asked Derek about it.

“The store takes them back,” he said. “I don’t know where they go. Back to when they came from, maybe. Back to being forgotten. The store brings them forward for a shift, lets them exist again, and then puts them back.”

“That’s not possible,” I said.

“Neither is finding a can of soup from 1952 in aisle 4,” Derek replied. “But here we are.”

That was a week ago.

Since then, I’ve developed a routine. I restock carefully. I note where I place things. I watch for the vintage products. I’ve learned to recognize them instantly—that particular quality of age, that feeling that something has been stored away for decades.

And I’ve started noticing something else.

The vintage products are becoming more recent.

The first week, they were all from the 1950s and 1960s. Last week, I found items from the 1980s. A few days ago, I found something from 1995.

Tonight, I found a product from 2003.

It was a energy drink that hasn’t been made since 2005. The can was in pristine condition, like it had just left the factory. But the date on the bottom was 2003.

Derek saw me staring at it.

“It’s speeding up,” he said. It wasn’t a question.

“Why would it be getting faster?” I asked.

“Because the store is getting closer,” he said quietly. “The products it’s pulling back are getting closer to now. Which means…”

He didn’t finish the sentence. He didn’t have to.

The store is pulling things forward from closer and closer to the present. Which means eventually, it will pull something from now. Something current. Something real.

And then, Derek didn’t say but I understood anyway, it would keep going.

Last night, I found a product from 2019.

It was a limited edition soda flavor that was discontinued almost immediately. The can looked brand new. The date was unmistakable.

Tonight, I’m dreading what I’m going to find.

Because I have a terrible feeling that the store isn’t just looking backward anymore. I think it might be looking forward.

I think it’s trying to bring something from the future into the present.

And I don’t know what happens when it succeeds.

Derek called in sick tonight. First time I’ve seen him miss a shift. I’m here alone, doing the restocking, watching the shelves.

It’s 2:30 AM.

I just found something.

It’s on aisle 7, right where I left a gap when I finished restocking. It’s a product I’ve never seen before. The packaging is wrong—the design is too clean, too precise, like it was made by someone who understood modern aesthetics but didn’t quite understand how a real product should look.

The expiration date says 2028.

There’s a note underneath it, written on the back of a receipt in handwriting I don’t recognize:

“The store is preparing. It’s bringing inventory from forward and backward simultaneously. Soon there will be a moment—just a moment—when all times exist on the same shelves. Past products and future products, sitting side by side. When that happens, the barrier will be thin enough. The store will be able to pull through what it’s really been hunting for all along.”

The note doesn’t say what the store is hunting for.

But I have a terrible suspicion it might be us.

The products from the present.

The items that currently exist.

The things that are still being remembered.

I’m going to go home now. I’m going to call Derek and tell him I’m quitting. I’m going to find a new job. A job that doesn’t involve a building that collects products from across time.

But as I’m walking toward the exit, I can feel the store watching me.

And I realize something horrible.

We’re products too, aren’t we?

We restock. We organize. We exist on the shelves of this building night after night.

And the store is learning to pull forward things that no longer exist.

Eventually, it will learn to pull forward people who no longer exist.

And when it does, we’ll all be on the same shelves.

All of us. Past and present and future, arranged neatly by the hands of something that understands inventory better than it understands mercy.

I should have listened to Derek.

I should have just put the cans back on the shelf and not asked questions.

But now I know.

And knowing is the worst thing the store could have taught me.

Because now I understand what I’m really restocking for.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
