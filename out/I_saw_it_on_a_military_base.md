# (Title: I Don’t Believe in the Supernatural—But I Do Check My Backseat)



I wish this could be a boring story. One that you skim over, shrug off, and forget.  
Hell, I wish I could forget.

Some backstory might help you understand. I don’t even know if anyone will read this — I just need to get it out of my head.

One thing I should start with: I don’t believe in the paranormal, the creepy, the ghosts and ghouls. There was always an explanation for me.

That little brown creature that looked like a mangled dog? It was a weird dog, obviously.  
Doors opening on their own? A simple draft. Warm air entering cold air, or whatever scientific thing it is.  
Seeing something out of the corner of my eye, only to see nothing when I look? I just need more sleep.  
An entity that lurks inside the closets of my childhood home, causing nightmares? Just the imagination of a kid.

My family always thought differently. My mother and sister would always burn sage whenever they got “the creepy feeling.” It was just a coincidence that I felt better, too.

I don’t think my father ever believed it either, but now I’m not sure.  
He was always calm whenever my sister or mother spoke about their experiences. He never brushed it off; he listened. He asked questions. But he never seemed scared. More like he was trying to gather information. He always seemed relaxed whenever they finished their talks.

My father was in the Air Force for twenty years, and honestly, I’m not sure how he did it.  
I’ve only been in for three, and I’m more than ready to leave. That’s probably due to bad leadership and low manning. I’m not willing to stay any longer to find out.

I think that’s enough backstory. My job in the Air Force doesn’t matter, not for this story anyway.  
I was working nights, an amazing schedule of 2000 to 0600, which means I got out at six in the morning.

It was a Sunday, quiet and dark. The type of silence that reminds me of my tinnitus.  
The sun never comes up earlier than eight these days.

My gas tank was nearly empty, which was odd. I remember thinking I had just refilled it. Either way, I needed gas.  
I drove to the gas station on base, just down the road from where I worked.

I didn’t pass any cars, which wasn’t odd. Who would be out that early in the morning on a Sunday?

The first thing I noticed after leaving my car was the silence. No animal sounds, no birds, no cars, not even wind.  
There was only the creaking of the gas handle as I grabbed it.

The “creepy feeling,” as my sister and mother would call it, was looming over me.  
I looked around as I tapped my card to pay and noticed that the sign for the gas prices was out. I’d never seen it off before, but maybe I was overthinking it.  
A coincidence.

I shrugged it off and started pumping my gas, still scanning my surroundings.

The eerie feeling never left. It was cold, even with my fleece on. I could see my breath when I exhaled.  
I looked beyond the parking lot toward the shopette, and then I saw it.

I won’t lie — for a second, I swear my heart stopped.

It was a humanoid figure. I thought it was another airman getting off work. It wasn’t impossible; I wasn’t the only one on shift work.  
But the more I stared, the more I realized something was off. The neck was too long. The arms reached farther down than they should.

Little things you’d miss with a quick glance.

I looked away quickly when the figure whipped its head around at me. If that was a person, I didn’t want to be caught staring.

Maybe it was just someone with weird proportions. Calling them weird would be rude, but it was a better alternative to something not human.  
Which I totally didn’t believe in.

I remember looking at the gas pump and thinking how it was taking forever. I only needed ten gallons. Why was this taking so long?

Then I saw something move out of the corner of my eye — a flash of motion.  
I glanced back to where I last saw the figure and froze.

It wasn’t there.

Even though it was below freezing, I was sweating. My armpits, my forehead, down my back.  
Maybe I hadn’t seen the figure the first time. Maybe I was seeing things. I did need more sleep.

I stopped pumping the gas at that point. I could get more when it was daylight, when there was noise outside, when there wasn’t a humanoid thing on base.

Trust me, I tried to rationalize it in my head. Homeless people got on base all the time. Maybe it was just a fast homeless guy. With odd proportions.  
Who am I to judge?

I turned to get in my car and froze again. How much am I freezing tonight? Too much for someone who claims not to believe in this kind of thing.

But this time, I couldn’t come up with an excuse for my soul.

The thing was staring at me from behind the pump to my right.  
This time I could get a better look at it, since it was in the light and we were both standing so still.

It definitely wasn’t a homeless person. It was tall, at least seven feet. I hadn’t realized that when it was farther away.

It had human eyes, but they were sunken in and yellowish, like someone with jaundice.  
There was something else about them too, like it was looking past me but staring right into me at the same time. It’s hard to explain.

I noticed the uniform next. The thing was dressed in BDUs, the Air Force uniform used from the early 80s to the 2010s. I only knew that because my dad wore it.  
Sure, it’s not impossible to get BDUs these days, but the full uniform? Really?

It didn’t fit either. The collar hung loose on the long, thin neck. The arms stretched too far past the cuffs.  
I wasn’t sure about the pants or boots. I was too afraid to look down.

I had my hand on the car door handle. I wanted nothing more than to just open it and drive away, but I was frozen in place.  
I couldn’t tell if my heart was beating a million times a minute or not at all.  
Everything was so quiet, it was deafening. My tinnitus was almost comforting.

The thing swayed. It looked like it was going to move forward, and I yelped.

Its skin was loose, and it looked like something gray underneath, maybe not gray, more like off-white. The realization hit me, and I really wish it hadn’t.  
The thing was wearing skin. It was trying to look human.

It seemed startled by my yelp, and I don’t know if that helped me or not.  
Either way, I flung the door open, jumped inside, and sped off.

I ignored the seat belt alarm. I just wanted to get out of there.

My car doesn’t automatically lock right away.  
So when I heard the terrible sound of my back passenger door opening, I didn’t want to look back.  
I didn’t want to validate the thing that was now in my back seat.

But I did.

I looked back and saw how truly terrible this thing was.  
The smell was almost overwhelming; it hit my nose like a slap in the face.  
The skin was almost melting off its core, like it was rotting. It smelled like it too.

I didn’t freeze this time.

I grabbed my lunch bag from the passenger seat and started beating the thing.

I was speeding down the road, at least fifty in a thirty-five, beating this horrid, uniformed, skin-stealing thing out of my car.  
I’m not religious, but I thank God it worked. The thing fell out of my car, still clutching my lunch bag.

I’ll have to buy the same kind again, in case I ever need to beat something out of my car.

I didn’t look back. I didn’t slow down.

The car door shut on its own. Maybe not all the way, but enough.

When I finally got to the gate to leave, I slowed down. I considered telling the gate guards what happened, or maybe just saying some homeless guy had wandered on base.

The gate guard shack was empty. The gate was open. No SecFo in sight.

That sent chills down my spine.  
Were they already dealing with the thing? Had it gotten to them already? It would’ve switched skins then, right?

I didn’t know, but I wasn’t sticking around to find out.

I drove home, blasting my Spotify playlist the entire time.  
I was shaking. I was scared. But I didn’t want to acknowledge that.

I almost didn’t want to leave my car. I checked all my mirrors as I parked, afraid to see that thing nearby.  
But I didn’t.

So I got out, ran to my door, managed not to drop my keys as I unlocked it.  
I rushed inside and locked the door, releasing a breath I didn’t realize I was holding.

Never have I felt so thankful to see my boyfriend up early, looking at me with confusion from the kitchen.

“Rough night at work?” he asked.

“I wish,” I replied.

I didn’t waste any time explaining what had happened, ranting as I shed my uniform.

“You’re kidding. You’re serious? I thought you didn’t believe in the supernatural?”

“I didn’t, babe. Not until just now. You don’t have to believe me, but that’s what happened.”

I was a little offended that he didn’t believe me, until I realized I probably wouldn’t have believed myself either.

He was quiet for a minute, watching his breakfast burrito heat up in the pan.  
I was quiet with him, processing what I’d just gone through.

When he finally spoke again, I startled.  
“You said your car door shut, right? But not all the way?”

The question sent a chill down my spine. That much was true.  
Someone, or something, could easily get into my car. That door wouldn’t have locked.

We both stared at each other for a second before racing to the gaming room.  
We could see my car from that window.

At first, I didn’t see anything. I let out a breath and looked at my boyfriend with some relief, but he was still staring, frozen.  
I looked back at my car and saw what he was looking at.

There was the thing. Sitting in the back seat of my car. Waiting.

I wasn’t sure how it had followed me, or how it got there so fast.  
I didn’t want to think about it.

“I think I believe in the supernatural now,” my boyfriend mumbled, still frozen beside me.

“See? I told you,” I said, feeling weak. But at least I wasn’t alone this time.

“What should we do? Call someone? Kill it?” he asked, still staring.

I was going to answer, though now I couldn’t tell you what I would’ve said.

Before I could get a word out, the thing started moving.

It slowly got out of the car. Somehow that was almost funny — this tall, lanky thing crawling out of the backseat of my tiny Honda Civic.  
It stood there, staring at us for too long, before shuffling away.

We both stayed at the window, even after it was gone.

“Isn’t your burrito going to burn?” I finally asked.

“Aw, shit,” he muttered, lingering by the window for a second longer before running back to the kitchen.

I never burn sage like my sister and mother.  
I don’t ask questions like my dad.  
But I do check my backseats.

I think I understand now why he never looked scared.  
Maybe my dad believes in the paranormal after all.  
He just isn’t afraid of doors closing on their own.  
**Because he’s seen worse.**
