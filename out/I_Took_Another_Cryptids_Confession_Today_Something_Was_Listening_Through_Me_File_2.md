Date: [REDACTED]

The Wailing Hart attacked a guard three nights ago.

I wasn’t present, but I saw the aftermath—if you could call it that. Officer Kellar had been stationed outside its cell. No breach, no protocol failure, just a moment of stillness where the air “got thick,” as the medics put it. Then the screaming started. They found him with both eardrums ruptured, eyes rolled back, muttering the same three words on loop: “It’s still singing.”

He’s unresponsive now. Last I heard, they moved him to Site 6’s deep psych ward.

The Hart’s in solitary confinement—separated by triple-layered opaque shielding and lined with sigil-bonded concrete. I’ve already submitted a request to speak with it again. It’ll take time. They’re “reassessing clearance hierarchy.” I don’t think they want me near it.

In the meantime, they gave me someone else.

TYPE-9 – Alias: “The Hollow-Faced Boy”

I wasn’t briefed beyond that. Just the name, a transcript ID, and a whispered warning from another staffer:
“Don’t ask it questions. Let it talk.”
The containment room was colder than usual. Not physically—emotionally. Sterile. Dead. Like the walls had given up on holding in heat.

The boy was already sitting across from me when I entered.

He looked no older than ten.

Gray hoodie. Pale legs. Dirty fingernails.

Except he had no face.

Not like a wound. Not blank skin. Just… missing. Like the front of his skull had been swallowed by shadow. You could see the suggestion of teeth, sometimes. Like something grinning just beyond the veil.

They hadn’t cuffed him. No restraints. Just that same red line between us.

He didn’t move for a long time. Then, without lifting his head, he started to speak.

“There are tunnels beneath the world. And there are children in them.”

His voice was too clear. Too precise. Like it wasn’t bouncing off the walls the way sound should. More like it was bypassing my ears and threading itself directly into my thoughts.

“They dig with their fingers. They sing with no tongues. They make new gods out of broken ones.”

I kept still. I wanted to speak, to ask protocol questions, but something about the cadence of his words made my throat close.

“We are what’s left when a name is used too many times and then forgotten. When you lose a child in the dark and find it again—changed. That’s us. That’s me.”

The red line dimmed.

I wrote that down in real time. I saw the lights flicker above us and checked the feed log later—no power drop. No fluctuations. But the line faded. Just for a second.

Then he stood.

I didn’t even see him move—I just realized he was standing.

“They called me from the roots. Pulled my voice out through the soil. My first breath was a scream. But they made me hold it in.”

He took one step forward. Still behind the line. But the air in the room pulled inward like a vacuum. My skin went tight. My vision blurred.

“There is something under your feet that remembers the shape of you. One day, it will wear it again.”

Then he smiled.

I couldn’t see his mouth, but I knew. Like my spine knew. Like my blood whispered it to my bones.

And then—like nothing happened—he sat back down and went silent.

The session ended itself. I didn’t hit the buzzer. I didn’t move. The door just unlocked. Security pulled me out like I was sleepwalking.

I went back to my quarters and threw up.

When I checked the audio logs, they were corrupted. Distorted beyond recognition—except for the moment he said “One day, it will wear it again.”

That part was crystal clear.

And it’s been playing on repeat in my head ever since.

I still haven’t heard back on my request to see the Wailing Hart.

But I think the Boy was a message.

Not a replacement.

A warning.

Session 2 – Approved Continuation

They sent me back in less than twenty-four hours.

No explanation. No clearance change. Just a sealed envelope slid under my door marked REPEAT INTERACTION AUTHORIZED in black stencil.

The Boy was already in the chair again when I arrived. Same posture. Same dirt-caked hoodie. Same darkness where a face should be. You could almost convince yourself it was just a child.

If you didn’t look too long.

If you didn’t listen.

I sat down without speaking.

He tilted his head to the side, like he was studying me without eyes.

“Do you want to see what I used to be?”

No prep. No intro. Just that.

I didn’t respond.

I didn’t need to.

He reached into his own shadow.

Not physically. Not with hands. With something else. Like a gesture that happened in concept rather than motion. And for a moment, I saw something formless and terrible beneath the table. Something older than the shape it was wearing.

And then it was gone.

“They put my name in a mirror,” he said softly.

“And fed it to itself until it forgot how to stop.”

I started recording manually. I didn’t trust the room’s systems anymore. Last session’s audio came back scrambled—except the one sentence. I didn’t want to risk losing this.

He started to hum.

It wasn’t music. Not really. Just three tones in a loop.

High. Low. Silence.

High. Low. Silence.

And with each cycle, the shadows in the corners of the room stretched further along the walls.

“There was a town once. It had too many mouths and not enough teeth.”

“So they pulled the teeth from the children.”

“And buried them beneath the school.”

He leaned in, though he didn’t move.

The distance between us got smaller. Not spatially—existentially. Like the concept of space was thinning.

“I lived in the gap between recess and when the bell rang. I lived in the hallway no one remembers walking through. I lived in the cough just before someone says your name.”

I wanted to breathe but forgot how. My ribs locked up like something unseen was coiling around them.

He spoke one more time.

No expression. No malice. Just fact:

“You carried a name before this one. You buried it in the fire. Do you remember what it was?”

My hand jerked. I dropped the pen. And for a split second, I felt something else inside me trying to answer.

But it didn’t speak.

It just listened.

The lights never flickered this time.

No alarms.

No documentation flagged the session as unusual.

And yet I left that room different.

Like part of me didn’t leave with the rest.

I haven’t listened to the recording yet. I’m afraid it will remember more than I do.

I submitted another request to speak with the Wailing Hart. Still no reply. But I’ve started dreaming about the sound of teeth tapping glass. Slow. Rhythmic. Measured.

Like someone knocking.

Like someone waiting.

I haven’t listened to the recording yet. I’m afraid it will remember more than I do.

I submitted another request to speak with the Wailing Hart. Still no reply.

But tonight, when I returned to my quarters, there was a new envelope waiting.

Same black stencil.

No instructions.

Just one line stamped on the inside:

“REQUEST APPROVED – SUBJECT 37-A”

They’re letting me see it again.

God help me. I’m going back in.
