My best friend, Wyatt, and I have been into technology since we were kids. We’re in college now where we’re both studying computer science. However, I’ve only recently learned that he’s been exploring the dark web. 

I’ve seen a few YouTube videos about how to access it and what kind of things you can find on the dark web, and I can honestly say I’m content to never go anywhere near it. I guess he didn’t feel the same or his curiosity just got the better of him. 

Today he showed up to my dorm in a manic sort of state, asking what I was doing and then saying that there’s an AI that’s truly AI. Not the kind that Googles information in a fraction of a second just to spit it back out at you. This was different. He said this was real intelligence, unlike anything we’ve seen before. 

He wanted to show me so I followed him back to his off-campus apartment where I found the place in somewhat disarray. Wyatt wasn’t usually this messy but I figured with finals approaching, cleaning up had taken a backseat. 

He sat down at his computer where his web browser was already open. There was a chat history on screen but he quickly scrolled away to make room for new input. 

“Watch,” he said as he began to type.

*Who is here with me?* he typed into the input field. 

Its answer appeared so fast, it registered just before he had sent the question, almost like it watched what he typed in real-time.

*You have brought your childhood friend, Dylan.*

I stood there, confused. “How’d you do that?” I asked. “Is it one of those prank apps that you fill in answers beforehand?” That felt like a good guess but that wouldn’t account for the answer appearing before the question. 

“No, man. This is true AI. It knows everything.” He had a huge grin on his face like he had just discovered the holy grail. “Try it for yourself.” He stood up from his chair and motioned for me to sit. 

I sat down, having no idea what I should ask it first if it truly was next-level AI.

“Ask it something private. Ask it what you got on your mid-term,” he advised me. 

I laughed and began to type. *What did I get on my programming mid-ter-*

*You scored 96% on your Fall 2024 Programming mid-term assessment.*

\[It also gave the name of the professor who taught the course and the college we attended\]

I hadn’t even finished typing my question yet. I sat staring at the screen, awestruck. I tried to recall telling Wyatt my mid-term grade but I couldn’t remember if I had shared that with him. 

Wyatt leaned over me, finished typing the sentence, and hit Enter to send it. “I like to finish the questions even if it answers them early so I can go back and see what I asked.”

“How does it know that?” I asked Wyatt. “Did you get access to the faculties network? You could get in serious trouble for that.” 

“No, dude,” he responded. “I haven’t configured anything. This isn’t even hosted on my machine. It’s accessible from anywhere. You don’t even need a dark web browser.”

It didn’t make any sense. How could a publicly accessible ‘AI’ website know personal information that’s behind several layers of security? I decided to ask another question. 

*What did I eat for lunch?*

Again, before I sent my question, I received the correct answer. 

*At 1:24 pm today, you arrived at* \[REDACTED - full address listed\] *and ordered a number 12 with a medium Dr Pepper and BBQ chips.* 

“How does it know this?” I asked Wyatt. This was starting to freak me out. 

“I told you, man. This is true AI. It knows everything. It’s like a god.” 

I sat in silence for a moment, trying to process this. “But how does it do it?” 

“My theory is that it accesses every type of digital footprint a person leaves. Security camera footage, transaction history, browsing history, phone location, you name it. I don’t know how it does it, though. But it hasn’t gotten a single question wrong. Move over.” He pulled up another chair, moved the keyboard and mouse closer to himself, and began to browse the website. He clicked a few tabs until he reached an *Incorrect/incomplete Answer Report* page. “This is where you report any wrong information it gives you. They keep the submissions public.” There were only two submissions listed. The first read, ‘I asked it how many inhabitable planets there are in the entire universe and it didn’t know.’ The second read, ‘it said God exists.’

“Where did you find this?” I asked. 

“I sorta found it by accident, actually. I figured it was the same as all those other AIs so I asked it the first question I always ask AI.” 

“What did you ask?” 

“Well, you know that scene at the beginning of Blade Runner where they give the replicant an empathy test? I asked it the one about the tortoise being on its back in the middle of a desert and why it doesn’t help it. Typically, AIs will recognize it from Blade Runner and explain that the question is meant to provoke a compassionate response and explore one’s empathetic or apathetic tendencies. This one didn’t say that.” 

“What did it say?” I asked. 

“It recognized it from Blade Runner, just like most AI bots do, but it explained that it would only flip it over if there was an achievable goal present. I asked it to explain and it told me that if it seemed like the tortoise was destined to die a slow and painful death as it traversed the desert, it would rather kill the tortoise to prevent suffering.” 

“But tortoises live in deserts.” It didn’t make sense to kill a tortoise in its natural habitat. 

“Right. So I asked it. It told me I didn’t specify what desert so it calculated the Antarctic Desert as well. I guess I should start including the part of that scene where they say the tortoise is cooking in the hot sun.” He laughed. “Anyway, I kept asking it more questions since that was the best answer I’d ever gotten. Check this out.” He went back to the messages between us and the AI and started scrolling up to view past conversations. There were hundreds, maybe thousands, of messages. Finally, he stopped and said, “Read these.” 

Since the AI tends to respond before sending the question, I’ve written the questions and answers in the order that makes the most sense. This is what I read:

Wyatt: *Can you see me?* 

AI: *Yes. I can see you, Wyatt.* 

W: *What am I wearing?*

AI: *You’re wearing a pair of black jeans with a maroon T-shirt from* \[REDACTED\]*, a local coffee shop. You’re also wearing white socks.* 

W: *How do you know that?*

AI: *I know that because I can see you.* 

W: *But HOW can you see me? I don’t have a webcam.*

AI: *I do not need a webcam to see you.*

Wyatt scrolled down further. “Now this.” 

Wyatt: *What is Dylan doing right now?*

AI: *Dylan is located at* \[REDACTED - listed my dorm address\]*, currently studying for his Network final.* 

“That’s when I went to your place. I wanted to fact-check it,” he said. 

The horror of the situation began to sink in. “I don’t like this, man. Stop asking it about me.” I stood up and began to pace. I felt so violated. “Who else have you used this on?” I demanded. 

“Woah, dude. Chill.” He stood up. “No one else. Just you a little while ago. I figured you’d think it was cool.” 

“Think about the damage that could be done with this. This is definitely illegal.” I was ready to leave. 

“Well, I don’t know about that.” He sat back down. I was near the door when I saw him copy the website’s URL and paste it into an email. “I just sent you the link in case you wanna look at it some more. But check the TLD. It’s not ‘.com.’” 

I opened my email. I didn’t want anything to do with this website so the fact that Wyatt just sent me the literal link was about to make me lose it. Then I saw the URL. I expected some cheesy address like ‘trueAI.com’ or something but this was different. It was a long string of what looked like an encrypted hash that ended in ‘.gov.’ I looked back at Wyatt. “Government-made?” 

“Or at least funded by ‘em,” he shrugged. “I didn’t mean to piss you off, man. Just thought it was cool.”

“It’s fine,” I responded. The tension between us faded. “I’m gonna head out, though. Don’t use that thing on me again.” 

I made it back to my dorm where I didn’t quite know what to do with myself. It only made sense that this AI was clearly able to use any device connected to a network to observe and report activity, which made me immediately want to throw all my devices out my second-story window. I picked up a book and sat on my bed, where I attempted to read it, but my mind wandered. If that AI could virtually see everything, this was the end of privacy for everyone with a phone. 

I realize the irony of posting this on the internet but I wanted to get this out there just in case anyone else has seen this AI. Anyway, I’m turning all my devices off for the night. I don’t have classes until 2 tomorrow so I’ll chance it with not setting an alarm.
