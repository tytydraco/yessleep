[\[Part 2\] The Dinner](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/15upty7/a_guest_at_my_hotel_requested_a_demonic_symbol_on/)

\[NSFW/Trigger Warning\]\[abuse\]I had trouble sleeping again that night. It didn’t matter that I was drunk and exhausted. I had an energy drink when I got home to kill the caffeine withdrawal headache I’d had since dinner. Now my brain couldn’t shut off. I had waking dreams about Kilday. I saw him on top of me and underneath me. We were intimate and it was incredible. I knew it wasn’t real, but my body couldn’t tell the difference. Then it stopped. I couldn’t conjure his image anymore and the sensation of him went away. I looked down at my feet and the bedsheets were pulled completely off. I’m always cold. I never sleep like that. But when I went to reach for them, I couldn’t lift my arms. I couldn’t move from the neck down. I had never experienced sleep paralysis before, but if this is what it was like, then I now understood its terrifying reputation. Helpless to do otherwise, I rested my head back on the pillow. An ominous sight awaited me on the ceiling. I saw the shape from the photo I took in the restaurant: two sharp points nearly coming together to form the top of a circle. I shut my eyes, but the shape remained seared into the backs of my eyelids.

I don’t remember actually falling asleep, but when my alarm went off, it was like night had switched to day in an instant. My eyes were suddenly open and I could move my body again. I felt sluggish as I forced myself out of bed. I knew I could fall asleep immediately if I tried now. But I had two more workdays ahead of me before my weekend (which in hospitality usually means Tuesday-Wednesday or something else stupid). Other than seeing Kilday again, I really didn’t want to go back into work. My car was still at the resort, so I took another Lyft. I brought three cherry-limeade energy drinks with me this time. I’d need them to survive the day.

Rory was working the front desk again when I arrived. He grinned when he saw me. “You look like shit,” he said, which made a lot of sense because I was pretty hung over.

“Your shoes look like shit,” I said back.

He jokingly put a hand over his heart. “Osprey, that hurts me.”

It immediately made me think of Terry’s heart attack the night before. “Have we heard anything about Terry? The waiter at the Aqua Table?”

“I heard his son called this morning. He didn’t make it.” Rory waited to gauge my response. “I didn’t really know him. Were you guys close?”

“We both worked here a long time,” I said. Terry wasn’t my work bestie or anything, but I knew the staff here would miss him.

“Well,” Rory started, “I got something that might cheer you up. Kat sent me this.” He opened a link to an Instagram post. “Check out Amisha.”

He handed me his phone and I looked through a set of three photos. They showed Amisha Patani, our micromanaging resort director, at the Indian wedding in New York she said she was going to. The pics showed her in a brightly colored, traditional Indian dress posing with the groom’s family, seated at a dinner table, and on a dancefloor. It looked like a giant wedding. I didn’t know what Rory was getting at.

“What am I supposed to be seeing?” I asked.

“Look,” he said, taking the phone and zooming in on one of the pics. “Everything’s wrong. Look at these people’s hands. They’re shaped all wrong and two of them have more than five fingers. And this guy and this guy are right next to each other, right?” he explained, panning over to two men near Amisha. “But their heads are completely different sizes. And one of their faces is also on this guy way over here!”

I looked closely. He was right. “Whoa. What’s going on?”

Rory could hardly contain his laughter. “She used A.I. to fake wedding photos! This is the stuff A.I. does when you give it photo prompts!”

My hangover brain was slow to piece it together. “So, what are you saying?”

“That she’s not actually there! She wants us to think she went to this big, super-important wedding in New York, but she’s actually somewhere else! Kat thinks so too.”

“Where do you think she is?” I asked.

Rory shrugged. “I don’t know.”

And neither did I. Just add it to my weirdness pile for the week.

The front desk phone rang. Security was calling. “Good morning, front desk, this is Osprey,” I answered.

“Why, good morning, Osprey. This is Morris,” he said on the other end. “Now, I’m calling you because, while I don’t have the precise whereabouts of the black polymer case you inquired about yesterday, I may—and I make no promises—may have a lead on the general area it may have been moved to.”

With everything that had happened since, I had forgotten all about the black shipping case that had disappeared from Mr. Kilday’s suite before his arrival. He said it wasn’t his, but I still needed to find it. I told Morris I’d be down there to see him about it soon. First, I had to pay a visit to Kilday. As much as I enjoyed being around him, there was something about his whole situation that rubbed me wrong. From his mysteriously absent partner to the culty rose petal symbol on the bed to the “horns in a circle” in my photo, there were too many unanswered questions. And now one of our employees had died just at the moment when Kilday was conspicuously absent. I went up to suite 4180 and knocked without announcing myself. I waited and knocked again.

“Coming, coming…hold on!” Kilday shouted from inside. I heard the deadbolt lock turn from inside. Guests typically didn’t use the deadbolt. The automatic lock works just fine unless you don’t even want housekeeping to come in. With the deadbolt unlocked, Kilday opened one side of the double doors. “Osprey, hi…” he said, seemingly surprised. He was wearing a towel around his waist and the skin of his hairy chest and beer belly was damp. I don’t know why I found him so attractive. I just did.

“Uhh—I can come back if you need a minute,” I said.

“No, no, it’s okay. What’s up?”

“Can I come in, then? I’d rather not discuss this in the hallway.”

“Well…” he looked over his shoulder, “I just came back from the beach and I’m kinda workin’ on something.”

I nodded and took a deep breath. “Then I think I deserve some answers. What is this?” I showed him the photo I took in the restaurant.

His face didn’t register anything. “What am I looking at?”

“Above the chairback. It’s faint, but it looks like a pair of horns coming together.” I zoomed in for him. “That was the chair for your partner. I took this during the waiter’s heart attack—when you stepped away.”

“Osprey, I’m confused—”

“—But are you? Really?”

He seemed a little put off, but he looked at the photo again. “Okay. So, the first thing that jumps out at me is this is a reflection. Those ‘horns’ are something reflecting in picture glass from across the restaurant.”

I studied it again…and he was right. What had first looked like an ethereal pair of horns floating above the chair now really did look like just the reflection of something else in the glass of a framed nautical photo mounted to the wall behind the chair. As a trick of the light, it could have been just about anything.

I let out an embarrassed sigh. “I’m sorry. Look, I’ve been dealing with a lot. Guests, this renovation, my manipulative boss, I haven’t slept for two nights, and I’m subsisting on energy drinks. I’m such an idiot, I—”

“—No, no, you’re not,” he said. “I’m actually a little concerned about you. I mean last night you told me you keep seeing this dead kid and now this.”

“I thought you said you believed me about Dustin.”

“I do, I do. Shit—I just mean, like, you got a lot on your plate, you know? Maybe too much. And if you’re not sleeping, and powering through on caffeine, then—”

“—No, you’re right, you’re right,” I said. His observations of me certainly weren’t wrong.

“And we both got pretty lit at dinner, too.”

“But you don’t look hung over at all,” I said, rubbing the aching spot where the back of my neck met my skull.

Kilday leaned closer and put his arm on the door. “What can I say? I’m a powerhouse, baby!”

Embarrassed, I laughed and looked to the side. A wall mirror hung nearby. Dustin stared back at me from it, as if he was just a few feet behind me. I saw the gunshot wound in his forehead slowly open up and blood begin to run down his face.

Kilday must have noticed the shift in my expression. “You see him, don’t you?”

I couldn’t lie to him. “Yeah.”

“You know what you need? The spa. Go with me. I got a massage and sauna booked for two at 2:00PM. We’ll sweat out the alcohol. My partner still isn’t here, so….”

I knew I could get away with it. The hotel was still mostly empty and all I had to get done that day was make the schedule and reply to e-mails. But then I remembered something. “The spa is closed! I am so sorry, Mr. Kilday. I didn’t even think to mention it. Amisha, my director, shut it down and furloughed the staff since business has been so slow. I thought we had messaged all the people with appointments!”

He wasn’t concerned at all. “I got money. Call the spa therapist in. I’ll make it worth her while. Cash. All under the table. No need to payroll it. Your boss lady will never even know.”

“I’ll see what I can do,” I told him.

I went into a stairwell where no one would hear me make the phone call. I couldn’t have other staff know. I got ahold of Leilani, one of our spa attendants who was also trained as a massage therapist. She must have needed the money because she responded enthusiastically and said she’d be ready for us at 2:00PM sharp. She didn’t even question why I was one of the two people going, which was odd, but I doubt I’d care if I was her. A girl has to get paid, right? There were still a few things I had to do before then. First, I needed to visit Morris in the security office about the black case.

“There aren’t any cameras in the guest hallways, there are, however, cameras in each of the guest elevators,” Morris explained.

“Yeah, I know, Morris,” I said. “Just tell me what you found.”

“In the elevators, I’m afraid nothing.”

I rolled my eyes and was about to get up and leave.

“But-but-but,” he held up his index finger and continued. “It led me to assume the individual who moved the case instead chose to use a service elevator. Those don’t have cameras, but there are cameras in the outdoor walkways leading from them to the other wings of the hotel. And that’s where I found it.”

He pulled up video of a man in a dark blue maintenance uniform wheeling the black case through a breezeway that went from the main building to the next. That building held another 180 guest rooms, all empty, that would be undergoing renovation in just a few days. The worker pushing it was wearing a baseball cap and didn’t show his face to the camera. It could have been any of our maintenance guys.

“And where did it go from there?” I asked.

“Fortunately, he used a guest elevator this time.” Morris switched the monitor to a different camera. “He brought the case up to the fourth floor, and that’s where we lose him.” The camera showed the worker pushing the case out of the elevator and out of sight.

“Can you go up to four and check rooms for me until you find it?” I asked.

“I would like to,” Morris said, leaning back in his chair, “but as we are currently scheduled only one security officer per shift, per the handbook I must remain here unless there is a domestic dispute or medical emergency.”

It was pretty much what I expected him to say. “Thank you for being so diligent,” I said with a level of sarcasm I knew Morris wouldn’t detect. I wanted to find that case. I was becoming obsessed with it. My instincts told me it had something to do with Kilday even though he claimed it wasn’t his. I’d have to go up there and find it myself. But that would have to wait. Our spa appointment was approaching. And besides, I knew the real reason I wanted to see what was in the case was to prove my suspicion wrong and show myself it didn’t have anything to do with him.

I put off looking for it until later and instead went to the hotel’s clothing store to buy a swimsuit for the spa and sauna. I’d have preferred to buy it off property, but the shops and stands along the beach that sold things like that were closed in the colder months and I didn’t have time to go into town. I settled on a simple black and white bikini. The girl working in the shop was confused why I, a manager, was buying a bikini there on my personal credit card in the winter. I was not about to explain. “Hey. Judgment-free zone,” I told her, and it was all she would get.

Next, I went to my office to make the next week’s schedule, send it out to the staff, and reply to a few dozen e-mails. Even with all the weirdness of the last couple days, I still had basic manager shit to take care of. Once that was finished, I swung by the front desk to check on Rory. He was streaming NBA on TNT on his phone. “Where’ve you been?” he asked, barely looking up from the screen.

“Just dealing with stuff. I have something else to take care of. Amisha wants me to inventory everything that needs the new logo after the renovation. Think you can handle the desk by yourself for another hour?”

“Sure. Place is pretty dead. I’ll be off after that anyway,” he replied. It was just what I wanted to hear.

I headed for the spa. Kilday was already wearing a robe and waiting inside the spa reception area. Leilani had gotten there early and opened it up for him. “See, money talks, girl,” he said as I walked in. He rubbed his hands together excitedly as Leilani ushered me into the women’s locker room to change.

“Thanks again for doing this. Did he already pay you?” I asked her.

“Oh, yes,” she said in a tone that sounded much more gregarious than her usual calm, soothing voice.

“How much?” I asked.

She tried to contain her smile. “You don’t want to know.”

Was she actually blushing? I couldn’t quite tell. I had never seen Leilani so excited. She was among the most consummate professionals here and rarely displayed much emotion. Had he really paid her so much money she was afraid I’d be envious? Maybe.

I changed into the black and white bikini I’d just bought. It was nothing fancy or overtly sexy (the cheapest one the shop had, actually), and it would do just fine for this. I put on a robe over it and Leilani walked me to the massage room. The smell of eucalyptus, subtle sound of running water, and peaceful tones of Japanese meditation music welcomed me in. Kilday was already laying face-down on a massage table with his robe pulled down to his waist. I climbed onto the second one a few feet away and did the same.

He eyed the bikini. “Black and white, huh? You buy that just for me?” he asked with his usual smirk.

“I had it in my car,” I lied. Forget his partner. There was no way he wasn’t flirting with me now.

“I’ll be alternating between you,” said Leilani as she removed a folded hot towel from Kilday’s shoulders and placed another on mine. “While you’re waiting, don’t be afraid to let your mind wander. Follow it where it goes.”

I had never gotten a massage from Leilani before, but it struck me as kind of an odd comment to make. Still, I was tired. The last thing I wanted to do was think hard about something else.

I don’t know exactly when I fell asleep. Leilani had started on Kilday first and I remember deciding to rest my eyes. When I opened them, the room was hot and bathed in red, like we were baking under a heat lamp. The Japanese meditation music seemed louder and slowed down, like each note was stretched-out into a deep, brassy groan. Leilani’s hands were on my back, pushing hard, really working the stress out of my muscles. I couldn’t keep my eyes open for more than a few seconds at a time. It was like my body was crashing from lack of sleep and too much caffeine. But on the fourth or fifth time I came to, everything about the massage had changed. Her touch was harder—almost too hard—and the hands themselves felt different. They were much larger. I could sense broad, cavernous palms and fingers that had extra joints. They were like the hands of an extremely large man, only they did things no mere man ever could. It felt like they were sculpting me and reaching through my skin inside of me, rigorously studying my body and deciphering whatever they could about me from it. I could feel my consciousness transferring, my memories, my emotions. Pain alternated with relief and euphoria. I couldn’t stay alert. I managed to turn my head toward Kilday. He was laying still with his head turned away and a hot towel back on his shoulders. The times my eyes were closed seemed to grow longer. There was a black void ahead of me accompanied by the sound of waves crashing. As I got closer to the void, a ball of fire appeared, closing in on me from a distance. It got really close. The heat in the room became unbearable.

Just when I began to feel truly afraid, it all stopped. I blinked several times and looked up. The red glow was gone and the running water and music sounded normal. Still laying on my stomach, I lifted my head with a huge gulp of air. Leilani was massaging Kilday. They both looked over at me.

“Welcome back. You fell asleep,” said Leilani. “Go somewhere nice?”

I didn’t know how to respond.

“Just what we needed, huh?” Kilday mused, almost too relaxed to talk.

Leilani walked over to me. “Mr. Kilday says he’s all finished. Shall I keep going with you, Osprey?”

“No!” I shouted, startling even myself. Leilani smiled and didn’t seem bothered. I took another breath. “I just mean I’m not used to this. I don’t do massages much. It’s all I can take for now.”

Kilday cleared his throat. “Is the sauna ready?”

“You have a choice,” Leilani explained. “Sauna means a dry sauna, as in dry heat from heat rocks. Or you can choose the steam room, which is heated by boiling water to create steam.”

Kilday looked at me, eyes half-open, like he was the most contented man in the world. “Steam room, then.”

I had no preference. I stood up, but my muscles and joints were so sore I had to steady myself from falling.

“It’ll go away in a few minutes,” said Leilani. “Don’t worry.”

I kept my robe on until we entered the steam room. Kilday didn’t. He walked right in with his army green Billabong boardshorts. Leilani turned the steam on and left us alone. I took off the robe, hung it outside, and closed the steam room door.

“I haven’t been in the gym much lately. Too many sixty-hour work weeks,” I said to him. I don’t know why I was so self-conscious. I was in relatively good shape and certainly far more fit than he was.

“You’re perfect,” he said. He didn’t take his eyes off me, and I realized I didn’t mind.

We fucked in that steam room. I’m not going to sugarcoat it. I debated relaying it differently on here for fear of how it would reflect on me, but this part is important. Our lips and bodies touched and the steam grew thicker and thicker. Kilday was strong, sensual, and never violent. At the point he got me down on the wooden bench, he found just the right buttons to push. He asked me questions as we made love—about guests, about Amisha, about my staff, about corporate—which ones I hated and what I wished I could do to them. It was like he had found my inner darkness and fed it as our bodies moved in rhythm. I don’t remember exactly what I said. My thoughts came stream of consciousness. I felt completely out of body. I only remember his last question.

“Does anyone hate you?” he asked.

“Probably,” I said, without considering.

We stopped after that. I was absolutely spent. We sat across the steam room from each other. I was dehydrated, but too tired to get up just yet. Then I noticed something. Kilday was just sitting there, elbows on his knees, staring at me with an obnoxious smile on his face. He didn’t look quite real, like it wasn’t him, but rather a wax figure of him that had taken his place. After a moment of it, the smile didn’t seem obnoxious anymore. It became creepy, unsettling—the uncanny valley. The steam grew thicker until I could no longer see him at all. Instead, I saw something else. Two sharp ends of a rounded shape almost coming together near the ceiling. ‘Horns in a circle,’ I remembered. Despite the soaring temperature, my skin suddenly felt ice cold. Then I saw more—pieces of a thin, fleshy membrane clinging to a human-like skull. The horns sprouted from the top of it. Inside the eye sockets were floating eyeballs with pupils fully dilated and fixated on me. I wanted to run but feared movement of any kind would trigger it. I saw the raw muscle tissue of its shoulders. And then, even as I stayed still, it moved on me. It was like it floated—its entire presence—across the steam room toward me at an agonizingly slow rate. I was in disbelief. I had already let it get too close by the time I realized what was happening. I couldn’t escape now. I’d missed my chance. I turtled up on the bench and braced for whatever horrors were to come.

Then the door opened, steam billowed out, and cool air conditioning swept through. “Osprey? Osprey? What’s wrong? You okay?” The voice was Kilday’s. He came in and pulled me out of the steam room. Leilani was right there and immediately helped me over to a chair. She brought me a bottle of cold water. I immediately started guzzling.

“Did you pass out?” Leilani asked.

“I don’t know, I—I thought you were in there,” I said to Kilday.

“I was,” he replied, concerned. “I said I was getting out. I needed water. Your eyes were closed. You nodded and stayed in.”

Leilani held a chilled towel to my forehead. “I told you not to stay longer than twenty minutes. You stayed forty-five.”

“I need more water,” I said to her.

“I’ll be right back.” She hurried into the back.

I looked up at Kilday. “Did we…”

“…Have sex?” he finished.

“So, it was real?”

“Real real,” he said, stroking his goatee.

I decided against telling him I saw the tall, eerie figure and horns in there. I needed to figure out what was happening for myself first. Leilani returned with more water bottles. “What time is it?” I asked after a drink.

“Almost four o’ clock,” she said.

I popped up from the chair. “Shit. I told Rory I’d only be gone an hour.” I dried off and got dressed as quickly as I could. Rory would be off by now. I felt guilty. I was letting my employees down by not being there for them. Something could have come up at the front desk that required my help. It had only been an extra forty minutes, but knowing it was so I could bang a wealthy diamond member in the steam room made the guilt a lot worse. I think I was also eager to focus on something normal.

My hair was still wet when I got back to the lobby. Rory had gone home and Neal had come in, but I couldn’t ask him about the symbol just yet. Because, as it turned out, something had come up at the front desk. The Wojciechowskis were screaming at each other, and Mrs. Wojciechowski had blood smeared across her nightgown, arms, and legs.

“You’re sick. You’re sick!” she shouted at her husband, with tears bleeding through her mascara. “I want to press charges,” she said to Morris, who was attempting to mediate.

“Do you want me to call the police, ma’am?” he asked, standing between them.

“Go ahead!” spat Mr. Wojciechowski. Then, to his wife, “Wait until they see how you almost OD’d on Xanax! And what’s your blood-alcohol level? Try it. See if they believe you!”

“What happened?” I asked Neal. But with his meek presence and quiet voice, he barely got a word in.

Mrs. Wojciechowski stormed up to me. “He put a dead bird in our room when I was asleep—” she started, then stumbled in her high heels, twisting her ankle. “Ahughh!—and covered me in its blood!” She sat down on the floor and pulled off her heels.

“Call 9-1-1,” I told Morris. He stepped aside and made the call.

Mr. Wojciechowski approached me, playing the part of the reasonable one. His breath reeked of tequila. “She’s not supposed to be upping her meds. I had nothing to do with—”

“—He’s on testosterone replacement therapy!” his wife shouted. “He can’t control himself! They stick needles in his—”

“—You shut your lying mouth!” He stepped toward her, pointing a finger. “These are my points, my miles, my money! Not yours!” He turned again to me. “I don’t know what she’s talking about. What bird? I’m the diamond member here. I’m the one you listen to.”

All I could do was stall until the cops showed up. “Sir, I need to ask you to keep your distance from each other.”

Mrs. Wojciechowski was beside herself. “What bird??? He put it there! He’s trying to make me insane!”

Her husband removed his photochromatic glasses and looked me in the eye. “I was gone all day. I had meetings. I haven’t even been to the room.”

As despicable as I found him (both of them, really), the bewilderment in his voice sounded real. I hate to admit it, but I believed him.

The police showed up soon after. While one officer dealt with the Wojciechowskis, a second cop followed me up to their room. It was worse than I expected. Blood was smeared across the white comforter on the bed, on the balcony windows, and on the dresser—where the severed head of a seagull sat inside a ring of salt. The seagull’s feathers were scattered around the room, reminding me of the giant, black feathers with singed tips I found in the planter outside the lobby the previous morning. If Mrs. Wojciechowski had indeed passed out after taking Xanax, then someone else had entered the room and done this, and I doubted it was her husband. While the officer took notes and photographs, I studied the blood smears. The blood on the sliding balcony door was in the shape of a pentagram while on the main window was a cross with two horizontal lines above an infinity symbol. It all looked very occult. The next thing I did was look for Kilday’s symbol, but it was nowhere to be found. Once we exited, the officer had me set the electronic lock to restricted and said they would return to grab some of the Wojciechowskis’ belongings.

After the police had taken the couple and left, I pulled Neal into the office to talk.

“Can I see the room?” he asked. Neal was in his thirties, lanky, with prematurely thinning hair and a tiny chin that vanished into his neck.

“The cops said I can’t let anyone,” I explained. “But I really need to ask you about the symbol I texted you. So, without telling me that the moon isn’t real, or that the pyramids are made of hemp—”

“—But the moon isn’t real.”

This was just who Neal was. The world was simply a very different place to him.

“Okay. Fine,” I said calmly. “Do you know what the symbol is?”

“I do.”

“Why did you say it isn’t safe to talk about?”

“Because they’re listening.”

“Who? Who is listening?” I was a very confused blend of frustrated and scared at that point.

“Can we put our phones down and go in the other room?” he asked with total sincerity.

“Let’s go.” We set our phones on my desk, went into a side office used for storage, and shut the door. “Okay, Neal. Just tell me what you know.”

He looked down at his feet. His lips barely moved. “It’s the sigil of the demon Barbatos.”

I didn’t feel a chill and my hairs didn’t stand up. It was nothing like that. In a strange sense, finally having a label for whatever had been happening lately came as a relief.

“And who or what is Barbatos?” I asked, trying to sound normal.

Neal continued, slightly mumbling. “A duke of hell from the Lesser Key of Solomon. A spirit that manifests when the sun is in Sagittarius.”

I didn’t know what to think of it just yet, though the idea of Kilday as some kind of satanist began to make a lot of sense. “Do you believe in this stuff, Neal?”

He looked up at me, then back down. “What? No. Of course not. Do you think I’m stupid?”

“But I don’t—then what are you afraid of? Who’s listening to us, then?”

“The World Economic Forum. They use demonology and astrology as codes for manipulating the financial system and establishing a one world currency and social credit score.”

I felt like such an idiot. Neal really had me going for a minute. I knew he meant everything he said literally, but I was not about to let myself be consumed by his conspiracy paranoia.

“Who had you make the sigil on their bed?” he asked.

“It was just a prank. Don’t worry about it,” I told him as I walked back out and grabbed my phone.

One of the cops came back a few minutes later to collect a few of the Wojciechowskis’ things. I went up to the room to watch as he packed items into a police duffel and brought it downstairs. I let him take the elevator down without me. I wanted to be alone. I took the next one. But when the doors opened, Kilday was inside. I tried my best to act naturally and went in with him.

“Awesome news,” he said. “My partner is arriving tonight. [For certain.”](https://connorgunnin.com/)
