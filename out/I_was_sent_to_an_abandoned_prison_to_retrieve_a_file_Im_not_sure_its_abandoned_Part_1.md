   The waves lapped violently over the side of the boat, rocking us from side to side. The rain was pouring down in heavy sheets, which wasn’t helping the situation any either. I could hardly hear the thudding of Carter’s boots as he ran over and shook my arm. “I think we’re almost there!” he shouted. “Yeah, I think so. Look at that!” I replied, and pointed to the silhouette of a cliff in the distance. “We’re almost there if we can make it through this storm!” I suppose I jinxed us. Carter nodded and started to run back to the cabin, before being knocked down by a wave that crashed over the side of the boat. I was soon after submerged as well. I struggled in the water on the deck before being swept to the back of the boat, into Carter. Another wave slammed me into the side of the boat. I felt fuzzy and distant for a second, before the boat and I drifted away.

   The soft lapping of waves against my side jolted me awake to the now sunny sky. I sat up and violently hacked out a gallon of water, before rolling over and hugging the ground. Now I’m not a strong believer in god, or satan. Hell even ghosts or any of that supernatural shit. But there was about 100% god had carried me to shore from that crash. I stood up once more and scanned my surroundings. The shoreline was littered with rocks and driftwood, and encompassed by a towering stone building, with barred windows and tall barbed walls. It looked as if it hadn’t been maintained in several decades, with ivy creeping down the sides and cracks in many of the bricks. This wasn’t surprising, considering this island hadn’t been used since the 1950s.

   My name is Scott Hale, and my friend Carter and I had been hired by some suits to retrieve a file from this island. We weren’t told much about the assignment, except for the fact that it was in the block 3 tower somewhere. Apparently it was ‘beyond us’ to know why we were after this file, which irked me a little. They also warned us to watch out for supposed ‘inmates’ who never left the island. Which reminds me, this island was a prison. Before of course it was overrun by inmates in ‘57 and fell into disrepair. I’d wanted to come out here for years, but never had the opportunity to until now. In my research I found an article claiming there was a secret set of tunnels under the prison made by inmates, sort of an underground city. Trading, gambling, bootlegging, all that good stuff. That’s besides the point. There was a dilapidated jetty blocking the coast to the left of me, and a rock face on my right. I needed to find Carter, seeing as he had all the spare magazines and my canteen. My canteen. This set in the daunting reality. Carter might not have even made it to the island. Even if he did, how was I supposed to find him? And even if I did somehow manage to find Carter, how were we going to get off the island? Our boat was in about 1000 pieces now, some of which had washed onto shore with me. My only option was to try and find a way into the old building.

   There was about 100 meters of beach between me and the building, and as I got closer I had a feeling in my stomach that made me stop in my tracks. I looked up at one of the windows, and to my surprise a sliver of a face ducked away and out of sight. I was spooked, but figured it was some sort of wild animal that made it’s way into the building. Hell, I was probably just concussed from that crash. I finally made it to the edge of the building, and started climbing up the windows to the top. From my vantage point, I could see the whole island now. Block 3 was to my left way in the distance, and block 2 was connected to this building by a hallway. This must have put me, on the roof of block 1. I had researched the island beforehand, and block 1 was where they held inmates on the first night. They first, of course, had to check in at the Check in Center, which is where our boat should have docked. I sure as hell wasn’t climbing back down this building. Thankfully for me, I didn’t have to. There was a roof hatch on the East side of the building, held shut by only a simple lock, and a shit ton of rust. The lock was easy enough, and I was able to pick it open with a rake pick. I had the feeling again but it was now or never. I dropped into the building.

   As my eyes adjusted, they adjusted to an image I’ll never be able to free my mind of. To my horror, there was a sickly, decaying man with white eyes and a grimacing grin waiting at the bottom. Before I could react, he leapt up at me and started clawing. I kneed his stomach and he recoiled, before I rolled over and pinned him down. With a quick slash, he went still and stopped fighting. A closer look revealed this to be no man, at least no type of man I had ever seen. It’s flesh was practically black, and clung tightly to it’s bony structure until it was cracking. It’s eye sockets were sunken and rotten, and few thin gray hairs poked out of the crispy flesh. It had a putrid odor of gasoline, expired meat, and a public toilet. It was wearing nothing but a faded, ratty jumpsuit that looked like it was ready to fall apart. It was now my turn to recoil, as I fell backwards and threw up a bunch of ocean water. This reminded me of how dehydrated I was. I guess my current mission was to find some water, before I could worry about finding Carter. That all changed when I heard a scream echo from somewhere in a courtyard. Carter was alive after all.
