Me and my friend Lumina have always been inseparable! We became fast friends in kindergarten and honestly never left each others side. As we got older we went on double dates, shopping sprees and even considered going to the same college! I adore her to be honest! But the thing is Lumina is a little…well, different. You see, Lumina sees things others don’t; she sees and talks to the dead.

Now I know what you’re thinking “No Way!!” And yes I too thought that at one point but all that changed a couple years after meeting her. Me and Lumina were hanging out at a friends house when I noticed her become very still. I recognized that she was having one of her “episodes” were she saw things. She slowly turned to our friend and in a hushed voice she said “there’s a man in the house…” My friend looked puzzled and replied “No there’s not. It’s only me and my boyfriend but he’s out of town.” Lumina shook her head and repeated “There is a man here, he tall and wears a suit. He has black hair and-“ she was cut off “a-and a black fedora??” My friend asked shaking slightly her eyes welling with tears. Lumina nodded slowly. My friend began to cry at that moment, her shoulder heaving with every sob. Lumina rested her hand gently on her shoulder “he just wants to know you’re all right.” My friend wiped away her tears and looked at the spot behind her. “D-dad?” My friend whimpered tearfully “oh dad I’m okay you don’t need to check in on me I’m okay”. After that incident I began to believe in Lumina’s gift. 

It’s been a couple years since that incident and nothing has really changed. We still are close and we even go to the same college together. I’m sitting in Lumina’s room right now and we are talking about next term classes. She wants to take psychology and I want to take biology. We were just laughing when he room mate walks in puzzled. She looks between me on the bed and Lumina at her desk. “Lumina” her roommate asks puzzled “who are you talking to?” Lumina shoots me an awkward look and turns to her “j-just a friend.,” she replied. Her roommate scoffs “yeah okay whatever.” And with that she closes the door and leaves. Me and Lumina sit in stunned silence and then we broke out laughing.

“What an idiot” I howl “she still doesn’t believe you huh?” “Oh gods no,” Lumina chuckled “I mean you didn’t either at first.” And she’s right, I didn’t, but I’m glad I believed her eventually. Even if it took my old friends experience and my own to make me fully understand. I’m just glad that I can still have Lumina as my best friend even if I did die in a car crash last year. I told you she was special. Which is good because even in death, I’m still her best friend.
