Last Tuesday, I found myself standing at the edge of my roommate Alex’s bed, staring at him, trying to figure out if he was actually awake. His eyes were wide open, but he wasn’t moving. I knocked on the door earlier that day to see if he wanted to grab lunch, but he didn’t answer. He’d been acting strange for a few days, so I figured it was just another of his phases.

Alex tends to disappear into himself sometimes, especially after something stressful happens, so I didn’t think too much of it when he just stayed in his room. The problem was, it had been days since he came out. He hadn’t eaten, hadn’t showered, and worst of all, he hadn’t said a word.

It wasn’t until Thursday night that things started to get weird. I came home from work to find Alex still in his bed, not moving at all. The whole room smelled a little odd, like old gym socks, but I figured it was just his laziness catching up with him. The next day, I checked on him again still nothing. By then, I was getting worried, so I knocked a little harder on his door.

“Alex?” I called, but he didn’t even blink. I shook him by the shoulder, but he didn’t flinch. His skin had a weird, pale tint, and his body was stiff. It wasn’t until I noticed the faint smell of something rotting that I realized something was off. He hadn’t been moving for days, and his body wasn’t just still he was beginning to decompose.

I rushed downstairs to find my roommates—Chris, Anna, and Leah—sitting in the living room. I told them Alex wasn’t moving, that something was wrong. But when they came upstairs, they just shrugged it off. Chris said “He’s probably just sick, dude. He’s been dealing with a lot lately.” Leah, who was always the voice of reason, agreed “Yeah, give him some time to rest. He’ll be fine.”

But he didn’t look fine. I could see the faint purple in his lips and his skin starting to stretch unnaturally. He wasn’t sick; he was rotting.

For days, I tried to talk to them about it, but no one would listen. They all kept pretending like everything was normal. “He’s just isolating,” they’d say, or “He’ll get better once he’s ready.” But I knew something was seriously wrong. He hadn’t eaten or moved in days. His body was starting to smell, and I could see his eyes fixed open, staring at nothing.

By the end of the week, I couldn’t take it anymore. I called the police, asking for a wellness check on Alex. The officers came, but when they saw him, they acted like nothing was wrong. One of them even asked if I was overreacting “He’s probably just sleeping it off, man.”

I didn’t know what to do. I couldn’t just leave him there, decomposing, and I couldn’t force my roommates to accept what was happening. So, I made the decision. I packed him up, wrapped him in a blanket, and drove him out to the woods. There’s an old creek out there where people sometimes leave things they don’t want to deal with, so I dumped him there, in the cold earth.

I thought that would be the end of it. But when I returned home, things started to change.

Chris was acting different. He didn’t move much, and when I tried talking to him, he just stared blankly at me. His eyes were wide open, and his hands were stiff. Anna said he’d been like that for hours. I thought maybe it was just exhaustion, but I had a sinking feeling in my stomach.

I realized what was happening whatever had taken Alex, whatever curse or dark energy had claimed him, it was starting to get to Chris. He wasn’t just tired. He wasn’t sleeping.

He was gone.

And just like with Alex, no one seemed to notice. Anna and Leah just kept going about their day like nothing had changed, pretending he was fine. The only difference now was that I was the only one who seemed to see what was happening.

I’m starting to wonder if it’s not just me being paranoid. Is it really some sort of curse that’s hitting us one by one? If it is, what’s next? Will I be the last one standing, watching everyone around me slowly fade into this… this empty state?

I don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like I’m trapped in a nightmare that no one else can see.
