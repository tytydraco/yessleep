I’m writing this down because memory isn’t enough anymore.

Not because it’s failing. I remember everything too clearly, but because what happened doesn’t feel like something I’m allowed to keep to myself. It keeps pressing against every other thought I have, like if I don’t acknowledge it, then it might slip away.

There’s a spillway just outside town. Nothing dramatic. Concrete slopes, old guardrails, water moving with the confidence it has when it knows where it’s going. The grass dancing to the same tune it always has.

I’ve been there before. I know how that place is supposed to feel. Sound carries a certain way. Distances behave themselves. Even the quiet feels predictable.

There was a shadow on the concrete where nothing was standing.

At first I thought it was mine, stretched oddly by the light. But it didn’t line up. It didn’t move when I shifted my weight.

It moved upward instead.

It wasn’t climbing the surface, it was lifting slowly, as if the air itself was responsible for casting it.

Then the spillway echoed from places it shouldn’t have. It felt like noise lagged behind itself, like the space around me hadn’t finished deciding where I was standing.

Light didn’t dim. It slid. Brightness gathered where it didn’t belong, draining from other places. Shadows bent inward rather than stretching away, like everything nearby was leaning toward the same empty center.

As I stared at that empty center, it felt like a switch flipped in my brain. I saw it.

Not a shape.

More like the space where something should have been.

It didn’t block light so much as redirect it, the way water pulls itself aside when something heavy moves through it without breaking the surface, without revealing what’s moving. It had depth, but the depth didn’t agree with itself. Parts of it felt close enough to touch. Other parts felt impossibly far away.

It didn’t slow. It didn’t stop.

It moved the way something moves without having to worry about what’s around it.

The world reacted instead.

The ground beneath me felt unreliable, like gravity was making a suggestion instead of issuing a command. Distance warped. Corners pressed too close. Up and down lost urgency. I wasn’t lifted. I wasn’t pulled.

For a moment, it felt like every reference point I’d ever trusted had shifted and used me as its origin, not because I mattered, but because I happened to be standing where something much larger needed space.

Distance stopped feeling like measurement and started feeling like preference.

Then it passed.

There was no departure. No retreat. The air corrected itself. Sound settled. Light behaved again. Gravity reclaimed authority.

I was still standing where I’d been.

My body didn’t panic. No shaking. No dizziness. My heart stayed calm, as if no change had happened.

That frightened me more than anything else.

I stayed longer than I should have, watching the space where things had bent, waiting to see if they would bend again.

They didn’t.

Since then, the world has never quite sat right.

Flat surfaces felt tense. Straight lines looked dishonest if I stared too long. Depth collapsed sometimes, with corners arriving sooner than they should, distances correcting themselves like they’d made a mistake.

I can still go to work. Still talk to people. Still function. But it’s obvious how optional all of this is.

Everything feels smaller.

A few nights later, I went back to the spillway.

Not because I expected anything to happen again.

Because not going back felt like pretending it hadn’t happened at all.

I don’t think something like that passes through without a reason.

I don’t think a gift like that arrives finished.

Maybe this wasn’t the end of it.

Maybe this is all a test.
