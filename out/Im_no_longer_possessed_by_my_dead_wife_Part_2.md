Thank you for the kind words in the [first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mrgydz/im_no_longer_possessed_by_my_dead_wife). I wasn’t expecting anyone to take me seriously. If I’m being totally honest, I wasn’t wanting to make a second post if at all possible. A very small part of me hoped that if I magically posted what was going on, that all of this would go away.

Well, it didn’t go away. Hence part two. If it wasn’t abundantly obvious, I’m in dire need of help right now. I feel like a marionette. Is that how being possessed feels? My actions are almost sluggish and unnatural. Like my brain thinks one thing but my body does another.

I wanted to get you all this update, but only after something had happened. Well… Something has happened.

The following day after my post, I called a priest. Not Ed and Lorraine Warren as someone suggested, turns out they aren’t around anymore. Regardless, thanks for the recommendation.

I live on a long and winding road that leads deep into the forest. Signs are posted along the way saying "no trespassing." I’ve loved isolation for a vast majority of my life, but now I can’t help but wonder if coming here was a mistake. Even the strongest willed men of this town are hesitant to visit, unless necessary.

That’s why I was surprised the priest was so eager to come all the way out here when I talked to him. When they arrived, the first words out of his mouth were, “There is an evil presence in this home.” 

I then proceeded to shit bricks all over the floor. Again, I am not the superstitious type, but all this is freaking me out. He gave me a list of different protective prayers I can recite in order to potentially ward off the demon, entity, whatever it is, in my home. Not only is it in a language I don’t recognize, I wouldn’t even know how to pronounce half of the words in order to recite the prayers. Awéé’, Da’ayą́? (I’m just as confused as you are.)

The priest said, very likely, the reason I may be possessed is due to the loss of a loved one, but not that I am having dissociative episodes. No, that would almost be a somewhat heartwarming mental disorder compared to what I’m currently affiliated with.

He said, “There could very well be an ancient evil spirit lingering here and has attached itself to me.”

Great. Literally awesome. I think I liked it better when I thought it was just my grief causing this to happen, but in his words, “The grief has made me vulnerable."

This does explain why this didn’t happen immediately after my wife died.

Another terrifying explanation, (because why not), is that he thinks that my wife has NEVER possessed me. He described whatever it is inside me as a parasite, and that my actions could “not be my own.”

Now imagine, if you will, you are sitting in your home, thinking, “Cool, this guy is going to show up, tell me I’m full of shit or that I’m crazy and there is nothing to worry about.” Then this old man shows up with so many wrinkles it is amazing he can see through the folds in his skin. And even behind all those wrinkles and the slits for eyes, it is very clear that even *he* looks worried.

I’m not exactly in my girl boss era right now. 

The priest explained that something happened here in order to awaken this thing that has attached itself to me, or I would’ve been possessed a long time ago. He hasn’t ruled out that this thing could be my wife, which is honestly the best case scenario at this point. 

What he truly suspects is that my wife never possessed me in the first place, that something else is inhabiting me. He also hasn’t ruled out that, since where I live is so remote, I could be on some sort of burial grounds of former Indigenous tribes. 

I will do some research in my local area to see if I can find any information on burial grounds. (Can you Google that? And if you can… why?)

The priest blessed the home in his sort of way that he does. Then he said what he did today was only temporary, he would need more supplies to, “Stop this thing for good.” He then admitted that he still felt an, “Immeasurable dark presence within these walls.” 

So, guess where I am sending this message from?

Nice little motel in town, well… only motel. I would’ve treated myself to a nice Holiday Inn if there was one available. Between you, me, and the cockroaches, I’m feeling a little cozy right now. Comparatively, that is.

The man at the counter asked me, “Don’t you live in that house at the edge of town? Why the heck are you staying here?”

‘A demon is possessing me.’ didn’t feel like a satisfactory answer. So I just lied, “I have an infestation in the basement.” 

That seemed to be a good enough answer for him.

But yeah, the wi-fi is shit, but I can still post from my MacBook, so it's not the biggest ordeal. 

And before any of you ask, yes, I blacked out earlier this morning. If my watch is correct, I was out for exactly six hours and thirty minutes. Does it make sense as to why I’m here now? Not exactly a part-time shift at Winn-Dixie that I’m dealing with. 

At some point during my anxiety-ridden stupor, I called the police. I called them a couple of times, it seems, if my contact history has anything to say about it. Yet, they didn’t do anything or notice anything wrong with me. Because when I came to, I was alone, sitting in the bathtub, clutching the rosaries like my life depended on it. 

The beads were digging so hard into my skin that when I released them, they left an imprint for hours. My skin has been so dry, especially because of the hard water, that I've been applying lotion nonstop since the event.

Before anyone says, “Why don't you just throw them away?”

If only it were that easy. I've tried throwing them away multiple times, but they always end up back in my hands eventually.

I wonder what the police did when they showed up to my house. I can imagine the look on the officer's faces as I approached them naked, clutching a necklace.

“Oh. Hey mister! Why are you naked? Oh? You called us but can’t remember why? You’re possessed by your dead wife? I am not professionally trained to handle this situation. You should call a priest!” Then they speed off in their cruiser.

Jokes aside, I feel that if this spirit were going to kill me, it would have done so by now. This is another reason why I think it could be my wife: the fact that I’m still breathing. 

What am I missing?

Now I can’t help but wonder if my wife is trying to protect me from… I don’t really even want to think about what “it” could be.

I’ve been doing some quick googling, well… not quick googling. Actually, intensely slow and painful googling. Like… waited forever for a single webpage to load, type googling. Apparently there are actually dozens of different types of spirits and evil entities throughout all cultures. 

One of my favorites in my internet crawl that I saw was a wendigo, but I don’t think it could be that. I just love the mythos surrounding them and what they represent. Terrifying and cool. I knew they sounded familiar, because my wife loved them because of a game she played before. I think it was called *Until Dawn*. (Wait, is that a spoiler?)

I never understood the plot, now that I’m thinking about it. If you are trapped in a cabin, why not leave? Why are we going to a place like that to begin with? There are hundreds of other things that are potentially more entertaining, but I digress.

Maybe it’s a poltergeist? I’ve been reading about them, but nothing is being thrown around. Quite the opposite, in fact. The only thing I want to throw is this laptop waiting for it to load. But my house was made spotless thanks to my demon on Friday, ready for our priestly visit on Saturday. So I guess I have no reason to necessarily complain about everything going on. 

Do you think the devil himself is possessing me? I hear that happens sometimes in movies. I don’t know what makes me so special. Ya know, with my white Ford F-150. 

Although the idea of Satan himself walking around in a little apron, sprucing up the house in *my* body, makes me chuckle. Maybe he’s a maid on his days off.

Can you tell I’m trying to be positive? Turns out, it’s pretty hard to be depressed when a literal demon may be possessing you. Or maybe I've just lost it. Have I told you what it's like on the days when I'm not dealing with having no control over my body? 

Imagine, if you will, someone has stuck their hands into a bag of sand. They now have that sand all over their fingers. They are now rubbing said sand through your hair, and through your skin, into your brain. They then grab your brain and fuck with your memories. It's like whatever is inside me is looking for something.

I suppose if that does make sense to you, you are as crazy as I am. Are you guys used to this? I don't even know if I'm typing anymore.

My fingers feel light. I don't remember being this good at typing. Lack of sleep will do that to you, I guess. Oh, I haven't mentioned. Do you guys have any good movie recommendations?

Also, maybe a slightly more pressing issue: do you have any suggestions for what spirit or demon this could be? If it isn’t my wife, that is. I mostly only know pop culture references, but I mean, this is the internet. One of you guys can probably figure it out. I’m sure I’ll be able to read your responses after like forty-eight hours, when the webpage refreshes.

This is the first time I’ve been bored in a while. I’m generally in my two story-cabin at this time of day, watching the sun set. 

Oh! My roses. Don’t let me forget when I get back on Monday. I have to water my roses, that is, if Satan doesn’t water them for me on Friday.

Okay, well, I think I’ve run out of things to talk about for now. When I figure out more I’ll let you know, so me and the cockroaches are probably going to head to bed. If by some miracle I DID sleep, it would be the first night in a long time.

Thank you again for all your kind words in my previous post. Little interactions, even though they seem small and insignificant to you, mean a whole lot to me.

So, if you don’t mind, I’m going to tell you another story about my beautiful wife. That is, until I get tired enough to stare at the ceiling while this thing molests my brain.

We were in Seattle. Morning sunlight was illuminating our cozy hotel room. We just stayed in bed, staring at one another for hours. Her Ember eyes set my soul aflame as the light reached her sun-kissed skin. 

It's sometimes the moments of nothingness that mean the most in hindsight. When nothing is going on, pay attention. Those might be the moments that you'll miss the most.

Around lunchtime, we decided to eat at the best fucking mac and cheese place, probably ever (If you know, you know). Well, my wife could cook some really good mac and cheese, too.

Anyway.

The cold winter air stung our noses, yet the warm and gooey noodles warmed us up. We even took a short trip to that fucking monstrosity of the gum wall (Seriously, what is wrong with you people?).

We eventually made our way to the dockside, and we walked and talked for hours. She liked to people-watch, despite her not being all that social. She loved to hear how people pronounced words, especially in the North.

Where eventually this child came upon us. She was lost because, of course. I’m on a romantic date with my wife. I can’t think of anything more romantic than a crying child waddling up in the freezing temperatures, snot dried on her nose, and screaming about her “Mama.”

My wife was eager to get this girl back to her parents. I was… less enthusiastic, but if she wanted to help, so did I. 

She held her hand as I asked around the local shops on the dockside, asking if anyone knew where her parents were. We figured they couldn’t be far, especially in this weather. We called the police, who offered little to no help. 

They checked to see if any people reported a missing child; no calls were answered. The police then searched all around the docks for us while we waited with the small girl in the warm denizen on the docks. It had an arcade and some restaurants. 

Apparently, the little girl really likes video games, so I snagged a couple of quarters and we played every machine a dozen times, probably. 

Finally, after over two hours, they found the girls' parents, but by the time we were done playing, she didn’t want to leave. I was kind of feeling attached myself.

From what we were told, she wandered out of the hotel room and walked around the city. How a young girl managed to do that, I have no idea. How the parents didn’t notice their child was missing for so long is beyond me.

Her parents were grateful, if not embarrassed. The girl gave me one of the tightest hugs I’ve ever received when we went our separate ways.

My wife looked at me, up and down. A sort of seed was planted within her. “You know, you looked really cute playing those games with Hera.”

“Yeah.” I’d smile. “It almost makes you want a kid of your own, right?”

A little bittersweet, now that I look back.

I just love to think about how cute her blonde hair looked underneath her beanie and the twelve layers of clothing that made her waddle like a penguin. All because she refused to wear a single snow jacket, because they were “ugly.” She’d pout at me and say, “I was being a jerk for making fun of her.”

But she was the one who looked like Wheezy from Toy Story! 

She was ridiculous.

God, my mind feels like it’s being hung by strings. Everything is so foggy, you know? When I get back I’m half tempted to set up a recording camera in my home to see what happens when I black out.

At the same time, I’m terrified of what I might discover.
