ok so a few years ago me and my friends had an era of playing red door yellow door. we did it on everyone in the group over the corse of at least a month or so. i was the thrid to go so i kinda knew what to expect but besides a friend being the director to mine, i lead and directed everybody else's experience. for each person we did, they had no context/knowledge/inside on anything about the game. obviously each of us had. different experience with the game, (the clocks, the shadow man, the doors etc,) but one the only things besides the shadow man that every single person saw, was an old woman. all but one of us saw her alive. one of us found her dead. Out of all of the research ive done on the game i havnt found any other experiences that also saw the old woman. but i also cant get out of my mind why all of my friends and me all saw the same old lady. it creeps me out so bad. 

my experience:
i appeared in a street outside of a grey house. i dont remeber much of the outside besides the front door being yellow and slightly ajar with two collom windows on each side. it was a somewhat normal surban house, (i dont rlly need to explain all the borning details) anyway i saw the old woman im one of the upstairs rooms sitting in a rocking chair by and empty cradle. in a chair slumled over. she didnt move but i could hear her deep breathing. eventually one of the doors was a black void and i went in. i couldnt see anything but i could feel someone in the room. the door was black. i left fast and when back downstairs. there i found a skinny brown wooden door. inside was a long dark hallway. the walls were bookcases full of old books, down futher, under a hanging light bulb was a shadow figure. thats when i left.
 
around a year and a half after. i was following this tiktok tutorial on how to purposely fall into sleep paralysis. while i was trying it, ig i fell asleep or something but i was back in the red door yellow door house from the first time i played. everything was the same, except in the hallway where the shadow man was, the shadow man was not there. once i walked to where he was there was a staircase branching off down. i descended into a room which pretty much consisted of a massive black void but there were circus tents spread out. at first there was nothing but as i walked past a few tents i heard a footstep behind me. there were these like jesters, one from each tent in the door ways. while i was turned back looking at them i heard another footstep behind me again. all of the other tents also had jesters in the entries. a third sound came from behind so once again, i turned around. they were closer. so on and so on everything i wasn't looking at them they moved but i was stuck. i could get back out because the staircase i came down was gone. this is where it gets really foggy. i somehow got past them and went into one of the tents. i was entering back into the original house through the back door which was in the kitchen. the house was different this time though. though it was the exact same house it only felt different. thats all i remember from that. 

the main reason i came on here was to ask if anyone else has seen the old woman. i have played tons of scary games and stuff like that but this one stuck with me more than the rest
