Proportionally, I’m the same. But I’m slowly being scaled down. It started an hour ago, and I’m already about a quarter of my original size. I have no idea what the *fuck* to do because I live in an isolated farmhouse. At this rate of diminishment, I’d be as minuscule as a mouse before I could reach anybody — or anybody could reach me.

It started with an asinine conversation online. Sitting on a lonely armchair in my lounge, I watched videos on my phone and fell into a state of festering frustration. Bitter at my solitude, I found myself embroiled in a needless debate. I accused a stranger of being rude to somebody else in the comment section of a YouTube video, and that nameless, faceless commenter replied:

*So, you think you’re the bigger person? Not for long.*

An excruciating ache tore through my body. I watched in horror as my flesh started to ripple and crinkle, like crumpling paper. My bones groaned in searing agony, and I shrieked as my body started to shrink.

Drowning in the dwindling sands of time, I found the following information in the about section of the user’s YouTube page:

*Rita’s email address for enquiries: \[——\]*

Already struggling to reach every letter on the phone keyboard, I emailed Rita to ask what was happening. Half an hour of painfully terrifying — and terrifyingly painful — shrinking passed. Then the wicked woman replied:

*Struggling to type with such tiny fingers, Ant-Man? You should be more afraid of the things you’ll see when you shrink into the carpet.*

I’m no microbiologist, so I leapt onto Google to research what things lurk at the unseen levels of reality. Monstrosities far more horrifying than the ones we see at the macro level. [Just take a look](https://uk.pcmag.com/electronics/36080/10-creepy-but-amazing-microscopic-monsters) at the terrors that are going to devour me when I disappear into that tiny world.

I begged Rita for forgiveness, and a cure for my terrible affliction, but she ignored my pleas and derived sadistic pleasure from my ceaseless suffering.

*You should fear the things that the monsters fear, little man. Every creature in the micro realm is hunted by the shadow. And now you’ve caught his attention.*

As I typed my response, I saw the light from my living room lamp traversing my walls in strange ways — the walls that had become towering skyscrapers. I steadily shrank atop the screen of my phone, which was resting on the floor, and watched a shadowy figure dance across my faded green wallpaper. My heart jittered in terror.

An eerie moan sounded from the carpet. I crawled along my phone screen, trembling as I prepared myself for whatever horrors I would face on the other side. As I peered over the edge of the phone, I screamed at the blackness between the carpet fibres. For a fleeting moment, I thought I saw an empty face observing me from the void.

I can’t explain it. As I continue to shrink, which seems to be increasingly painful, it’s as if I see the world through a different lens. Not just a smaller one — a darker one. Am I seeing the world in its real state? Who knows? I don’t have time to figure this out. It’s becoming harder and harder to type. I’m running from letter to letter on the phone keyboard at this point.

I suppose I could avoid the carpet and stay on the screen, but microscopic creatures live on every surface, so it doesn’t matter where I go. What fate awaits me in those carpeted chasms? Should I fear the monsters beneath me or the one hiding in the shadows?

If you have suggestions that could help, thank you. However, I should warn you that I think it would be a fruitless endeavour. I wouldn’t expect a reply. I don’t even know how much longer I’ll be able to keep typing.

It’s too late to save me. Soon, I’ll be lost in the world within my carpet fibres. A world that, by the looks of it, is far more dangerous than the one we know. And if I survive the monsters, I have to face the frightful, formless shadow stalking me.

As I shrink, my microphobia grows.
