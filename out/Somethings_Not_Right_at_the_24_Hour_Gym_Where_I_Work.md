# Something's Not Right at the 24 Hour Gym Where I Work

I've been working the night shift at Endurance Fitness for about three months now. After blowing out my knee and ending my gymnastics carrer last year, I needed something to keep me close to fitness while I figure out what's next. The job seemed perfect - I get free membership, the pay is decent for an 18-year-old with no college degree, and night shifts (10pm-6am) mean I can take classes during the day.

The gym is one of those 24-hour places with key fobs for members to get in after hours. My job is basically to check people in, clean equipment, and make sure nobody dies on my watch. Usually, it's just the same handful of night owls - the EMT who hits the stairmaster after his graveyard shift, the insomniac lawyer who only uses the rowing machine, and a few others.

But there's something else happening here. Something I can't explain.

It started two weeks ago. I was wipeing down the free weights when I heard the door chime. Looking up, I saw a man I'd never seen before scan his fob and walk in. He was tall, maybe in his 40s, wearing gray sweats that hung off his too-thin frame. What caught my attention was how he moved - fluid but wrong somehow, like someone who'd learned human movement from a manual rather than experience. I guess my years in gymnastics make me hyper-aware of body mechanics.

"Evening," I called out as he passed the desk. He didn't respond, didn't even look my way.

Whatever, some people just want to work out in peace. I went back to cleaning.

About twenty minutes later, I realized I hadn't heard any machines running or weights clinking since he arrived. I did a lap around the gym but couldn't find him anywhere. The bathroom was empty. The locker rooms too. The only exits are the front door and the emergency exit, which triggers an alarm. Neither had been used.

I convined myself he must have slipped out when I wasn't looking.

Then it happened again three nights later. Different person - an older woman in pristine white sneakers. Same weird movement. Same disappearance.

Last night was what's making me write this post. I was at the front desk scrolling through TikTok when the temperature suddenly dropped. Like, dramatically dropped. I could see my breath. The door chime rang, but I didn't see anyone enter. The security camera by the door showed static for exactly 3.5 seconds.

When I looked up from my phone, there were five people standing in the weight area. All in gray sweats. All with that same wrong way of moving. I hadn't seen or heard any of them come in.

They formed a perfect circle and began stretching in sync. Not normal stretches, but those hyperextended positions that always freaked people out when I was competing. The kind that make joints bend in ways they shouldn't. Except these people were pushing beyond what even Olympic gymnasts could do. Their limbs twisted and elongated, necks rotating completely around.

I grabbed my phone to record but it was dead despite being at 87% a minute earlier.

For fifteen minuites, they "exercised" in perfectly syncronized movements that defied anatomy. Then all five stopped simultaneously, turned toward the wall with the gym's oversized mirror, and walked directly into it. Not into the mirror - into the wall itself, passing through solid concrete.

The temperature returned to normal instantly.

This morning when I clocked out, I checked the member log. No entries between 2:13 AM and 4:47 AM.

I have to go back tonight. I need the job and honestly, who would believe me if I reported this? But I'm bringing a real camera, extra batteries, and thermometer.

Has anyone else experienced anything like this at their 24-hour gym? Any night shift workers seeing weird shit? I'm starting to think there's something about these places after hours, when the normal world is asleep and something else wakes up.
