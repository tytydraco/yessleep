so this started all happening about… maybe 5 or so months ago? the first time I heard it was as I was coming back from school, I was early since we didn't have PE, and because the unusual schedule I'd take another bus to family that I had in another part of town, it was my uncle and grandparents from my mother's side, but scratch that… that's not what you're here for. 

I should mention that this wasn't a school bus, it was obviously a regular bus, so almost everyone besides me and a few kids were adults, where I went to highschool you would just take any bus that would come around when school ended, so no busses came exactly when my classes ended and that's why I'd go to my family's, I'd have to potentially wait an hour or more because PE didn't happen. despite it not being packed with teens, it was still very loud, the driving bus’ noises and people talking sounded like a constant buzz that never got quieter or louder.

but even so, I could hear the faintest of… sobbing? behind me. 

I sat near the back right, there were maybe 4 seats behind me, and someone there was crying, it wasn't quiet, but it was just above the noise level the bus was making, it sounded like a woman in her 20’s or maybe even a younger teen? I didn't dare turn around however, as the image of confronting a woman discreetly weeping in the back and making her feel even worse didn't sit right with me obviously, so I just stared ahead, my gaze dancing across the city.

the crying, however, quickly shifted from repid inhales to very audible sniffles and the occasional sobs

again, I didn't bother to look behind me, I didn't wanna embarrass this poor girl or whoever was behind me

a couple minutes passed, and we were approaching my stop, the bus was much quieter now since most of the passengers were gone, making me realize that the crying had… stopped? I still didn't want to fully look behind me, so I turned my head to the left a bit and judging from the shadows cast on the seats I was looking at, nobody was behind me 

“the fuck?” I thought to myself, I didn't see anyone getting off who looked distressed or sad, hell I didn't see any women get off, what could've happened? 

now I had the courage to fully turn behind me, nothing! I got up and checked around and under the seats, probably to the horror of the bus driver wondering how a kid on his bus got a hold of drugs, there was nothing… 

I got off at my stop, which was right across the street from my uncle's home. as I look both ways and cross, I wonder to myself… could I have somehow imagined that whole ordeal? it had happened before, I could recall imaging an entire scene where I got out of bed and turned on the lights, only to be brought back to reality, I was scared shirtless of sleeping alone back then… when I was 6.

this incident never faded from my labored mind as the coming days passed, until Thursday 

it was the same as last week, there was no PE again, this would usually make me happy as, well let's just say I'm no athlete, but there was that experience from a week ago, nagging at me silently, the thought the something was behind me for half an hour, breathing down my neck, possibly mimicking the sounds of a woman in despair, waiting for the moment I turn around so it can capture my gaze and tear out my eyes. 

“pfft… nah”

I step onto the bus, in a good mood that day, I make my way to, I shit you not, the exact same spot, it was my favourite spot, I'd always go there. it's strange actually how I have a favourite spot for every different bus I go on, but nevertheless, here I was again. 

about 15 minutes into the ride, as I was on my phone, numbers and patterns flick before my vision as my brain tries to no avail to solve a sticky situation in minesweeper, I groan in annoyance and out my phone away, looking out the window out the town, I liked to people watch alot. yes, yes I know, a hormonal teen watching as couples live my dream, laugh all you want, but it genuinely was a nice, albeit creepy hobby… and my skills in picking up the subtle details on people's surely would fail me now…. as I spot a woman on the bus, staring at me? she was on a backwards sear, most faced toward the front of the bus, however a few faced the back. 

this woman's face, it was pale, her eyes wide with confusion and immense worry as she stated at me… here eyes darting around the features on my face….

### **she's staring behind me**

at that moment I hear it, the soft sniffles and sobs of whatever is behind me, I freeze up, mimicking the woman's face, she seems to notice this as her gaze flicks to mine for a moment. 

not a moment later at the next stop, she gets up and makes a swift and efficient exit, weaving through the crowd like a sewing needle. 

I watch as the door shuts, with only 2 people in the front seats now. 

it's just me and **it**

I don't know where I grew a big enough pair for this, but I slowly turn to the left, I glance at the shadows. 

not only do I see a woman with scruffy looking hair sitting behind me, but her shadow isn't staring at the back of my head, no, it's facing the shadow, my gaze. 

my head snapped forwards again, I'm not sure what scared me more, the fact that she was still as a statue as she sobbed or the fact that I couldn't feel any breathing on my neck. 

this.. thing.. it wasn't human. 

for 15 long minutes I sit there, hoping if I ignore it it'll go away, I stare out the window… 

why can't I see it's reflection? 

eventually I decide to get up, making my way to the front of the bus, I couldn't handle the sobs anymore… 

I very slowly turn around to face it, now a solid 10 feet away, at the center of the bus. 

as you can guess… nothing… I couldn't hear it, couldn't see it, I go back and search around the seats thoroughly, if the bus driver didn't think I was high before he was sure certain now. again, nothing. 

the drive and walk back home, I don't feel like I'm in my own mind or body, I've never felt this terrified and stressed before, this was a new height of horror that I thought only my academic worries could reach or challenge. 

I'm sure my family could read the terror scribbled on my face that day, but thankfully no one questioned me…

Thursday 

I pray that there's PE, I couldn't do this again, I'd happily take my classmates distasteful comments about my athleticism over that again, but again, I'm subjected to this torture. 

no… nono I won't do this again, I'll wait for the bus to MY home, waiting an hour is nothing if it means I don't have to face that hellspawn again. 

the bus to my uncles home arrives, and the bus driver stares at me with a confused expression as I do not get on, at this point, in his mind I'm on meth, in mine, I'm being hunted. 

the bus passes by, I'm not sure what wills me to look downwards but I do, anything but eager to see that… thing in the backseat. 

as the bus passes I feel a weight lift of my chest, I let go of a breath I didn't realize I was holding, I'm free! this surely won't be the only time I'm more than happy to wait an hour for the bus home…

two days later 

my mom comes into my room, informing me about an article, I couldn't really understand much through her panicked speech so I ask her to send it to me

my PE professor was… dead? 

I read further through the article… 

she was found dead in her home, her body looked pale and boney, the skin around her face was red from tears. 

there's a picture included of her body in her house…. but that's not what I'm focused on

I know it's there. 

I know it's taunting me. 

in the corner of a hallway, where the camera blurs because of the focus, scruffy hair, a red glowing iris staring directly at the core of my being, I can almost hear the sobbing again… almost like…
