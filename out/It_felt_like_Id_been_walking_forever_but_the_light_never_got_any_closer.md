It was a journey I’d travelled many times before as a child, walking home from the school bus. Back then, it took about fifteen minutes. Twenty if I felt like exploring the fields, ten if I needed to pee. But that was two decades ago, and that was during the day. Currently, it was just after midnight, on the darkest night I’d ever witnessed. Usually, out here in the countryside was the best place to see the cosmos twinkling down. Far from all that light pollution of the big city. But not tonight. There wasn’t a single star in the sky, no moon to light the way, even the bus stop light was obscured by the only bend in the road. The only source of light is the old bulb hanging in the porch of my parents' rural cottage. And a good thing they’d left it on, because after fourteen hours of transit, my phone was flat and it was the only thing guiding me. Like a moth to a flame. Wait, that’s not good. Like a lighthouse. Except lighthouses are warnings of unseen dangers. Whatever, it’s late and I’m exhausted, so I trudge on.  
  
It’s been six years since I visited in person. Too long. I promised my parents I’d be back to see them sooner, but sometimes life gets in the way. My last visit had been to install working internet and a basic laptop that even they could use. Just so we could video chat. Perhaps that makes me a bad son, but it’s not like they were racing out to see me in the city. To be honest, the only reason I’m visiting them now is because of the strange voicemail they left. Very vague, barely sounded like them. Sounded more like the FaceTime version of them. You know, parents who’ve spoken to you your entire life, who speak like normal on their landline, suddenly place them in front of a phone, tablet or laptop and they freeze up. They become mechanical, robotic in voice, too awkward to move a muscle. At least that’s how they were for the first couple of years, eventually they got used to this new form of communication. But this voicemail, it was like listening to that version of them all over again, like they’d never used a phone before. And since that message, no contact whatsoever. The cynic in me said they sabotaged their internet to trick me into visiting. But when I couldn’t get through with landline or mobile, I decided I better come see what’s going on. At this late hour, I’m hoping it is all a prank. I can be mad at them in the morning, after a good night’s sleep.  
  
Ooof, I trip on the edge of the road. The sealed part was done in a rush, I’m being generous even calling it a road. More of a gravel path with some bitumen casually tossed on top. Not that they need much with their old farm ute. It could traverse the paddocks just as easily so long as it wasn’t muddy. I get up off my knees, wipe away the gravel and feel a trickle of blood running down my shin. Damn it, I must've ripped my pants. Now I’m really annoyed. Now I hope they have a proper excuse for going dark.  
  
I gather myself, get my bearings, look for the light which has momentarily slipped from my view. It’s not where I expected it to be, I must’ve got spun-round a little when I fell. I trudge on toward it. Now walking on the grass next to the road. It’s softer underfoot anyway making for a pleasant walk. I don’t bother looking for the sealed road for fear of hitting that jagged edge.  
There used to be fences, back when my parents farmed stock, but they gave that up when I left home. Too much work, not enough return. They’d long since paid off the mortgage and were able to make money leasing back paddocks to other farmers, and even running a tourist camping area for a while. But since retirement, they’d decided to take the easy path and just enjoy the countryside that they owned. I encouraged them to build a bigger house, maybe install a pool, do something with it. But they said the farmhouse had been big enough to raise three children, it was certainly big enough for just the two of them. I think I can just make it out now. A faint silhouette emanating from that single bulb. A cool blue light. Turns out my parents finally upgraded their old incandescent bulbs to some sort of LED. I could’ve sworn it was warmer when I first saw it. Must’ve been an illusion caused by distance. Whatever, I just need to get there.  
  
I’ve been out here in the darkness long enough that I can finally pick the horizon. It’s the only thing visible, and it’s barely a shade different from the sky. It does help with my balance as I walk through a dip in the grass. Closer and closer, yet the bulb remains out of reach.  
When I woke up this morning, I thought it would be an annoying but simple journey. It has been anything but. I had to catch an early flight, so I’ve been up for nearly twenty hours. Not counting the small nap I took on the bus right before my stop. I’d been drowsy for so long, and had attempted to sleep at the beginning of the bus-ride, but it hadn’t happened. Then right before my stop, I nodded off. Luckily, I was up front and had told the driver where I was getting off. He woke me, and ushered me off the bus before I really knew where I was. Luckily, it was the right stop. But now the drowsiness was returning. My stride was shortening, my eyelids fluttering a little - Wait, did the light move? Can’t be. I’m really struggling all of a sudden. My tiredness brings anger and frustration, focused on my parents. Why can’t they look after themselves? They ran a farm for crying out loud. I’ve shown them tech stuff and they just choose to ignore it. Now I’m here in the middle of nowhere, in the middle of the darkest night in history, yearning for sleep. I’m going to say nothing and just climb into bed. The scolding can wait till morning.  
A flicker of light catches the periphery of my vision. I turn, peer into the gloom. Nothing there. Odd, there are no other houses or buildings out here. I rub my eyes, turn back to the light. I can finally make out the silhouette of the building behind it. Looming over the horizon. It’s getting larger as I get closer. At long last.  
  
It gives me the burst of energy I need, and I cover the final distance quickly. As I take the last strides I notice the light -- It doesn’t illuminate the front door like the old tungsten bulb did. For a moment I think it must be part of some new security system my parents installed, but then I remember who I’m talking about. My parents wouldn’t bother, and if they did, the only person they’d have install it is me.  
  
I step closer, the bulb is right there, the dark silhouette on the horizon that is the house right behind it, but I still cannot see the door. I step closer and closer, the light is glaring, blinding my eyes that have become adjusted to the darkness. I cover them with my hand and inch forward. Right up to the light.  
Right under the light.  
  
Somehow, the house is still shrouded in darkness. Nothing but black in an impossibly black night. For a moment, my exhausted mind tries to process this impossibility, tries to make sense of it. Then I catch that flicker of light in my peripheral vision. I turn and look. In the distance, an incandescent light bulb illuminates the front door of my parent’s little farm house.   
  
My tired and confused brain tries to unravel this mystery. Maybe my parents did expand. Perhaps this is the pool house. But why so far away? I must’ve veered off course at some point after my fall, but that doesn’t answer the biggest mystery off all. What am I standing next to?  
The light goes out. Instant blackout. The huge black silhouette behind it envelops me before I can call out in terror. My world goes completely dark.  
  
I wake up with a headache, the morning light sneaking under the curtain hurts my eyes, like I’m seeing for the first time. A knock at the doorway. It’s my parents. They smile at me, happy I’m home, then return to their breakfast without saying a word. As my eyes adjust to the light, I start to see things clearly. Their movement, their posture, their smiles – They look like the unnatural videocall version of themselves. I peek between the curtain, nothing but blue sky and open fields. No new building. Nothing in the paddocks but grass. I stumble out of bed, into the kitchen, flick on the kettle. Strange, it’s not plugged in. No coffee either, I check in the pantry, but it’s empty. Not a single item of food. I turn to find my parents standing there, smiling an impossible smile. They open their mouths and speak in perfect unison.  
“We’re so glad you’re finally home, son.”
