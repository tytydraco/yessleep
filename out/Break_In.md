Hi everybody, It’s Markus. I know I’m not the best writer compared to her, but Billie asked me to come on here this time, she told me this story was “best told first person”, so you're stuck with me for now. Sorry, not sorry. ;)

The next day I woke up later in the afternoon, I was exhausted from packing with Billie’s family and really needed those extra hours of sleep. I texted Billie, replying to her 8 million worried messages before walking downstairs. My mom and I were sitting on the couch, she was reading and I was looking out the window watching my neighbors walk by, walking their dogs, drinking coffee on their porch, all that stuff. My mom sighed and put her book down, reading something on her phone. I asked her what was wrong to which she replied she forgot to text Billie's mom back. I assured her it was fine, and so she sent a quick text before running upstairs to change or something. 

I laid back on the couch looking at the ceiling, there was a small mark right above me. I couldn't tell if it was a scratch or a bug, either way, I didn’t want to find out and moved to the kitchen for a cup of water. My mom walked downstairs and told me she was going to clean out the shed before it rained again. I wished her luck and reminded her that I would be in the garage working on the car. She smiled at me warmly and went outside. I sat in the quiet for a little before I changed my clothes to work.

I walked into the garage, it was dark and dusty. Every time I walked into the garage I always felt this knot in my stomach. I wasn't the biggest car guy,  I mean hell if you were to ask me a question about cars when I was younger I would tell you to get a life and tell you five million monster facts or something. I just never was into cars, but my dad, he loved ‘em, older cars a least. He would take me to the garage to work on this damn car almost every other day, all he wanted was to get this thing running, but it never was ready, always a new problem to fix. 

I flipped on the lights and closed the door behind me. An old 1956 Mercury Turnpike Cruiser, originally a bright orange, but now the paints just faded to a gross yellow. I tried my best for the better half of 8 years to get this thing going, and I felt I was nearly there. Every time I look at it all I see is my dad staring back at me. I wish I tried harder when I was younger. I wish I could've had the reality of us driving together in it, but I didn’t.

I walked over to the small shelf with all my stuff and grabbed the shit I needed. I worked on it for a few hours before I came out and made myself a sandwich. I was sitting at the table when my mom came downstairs. She looked at me, before asking me why I didn’t make her one as well, I looked at her with a smug smile before pointing at her plate that was sitting on the counter. She laughed and walked into the kitchen, grabbing her sandwich, and sitting next to me. We talked for a little while longer before I went back to work. I was trying to find my safety glasses when I saw Billie's mom walk past the garage. I was going to say hi, but I figured they were just going to leave, so I just let her be.

I heard the door open and shut before I threw my headphones on. I sat for a while, looking for another thing to fix when I thought I heard something outside the garage. I took my headphones off and I heard something break. I stood up and ran to the door, I grabbed at the knob, but it wouldn’t open. I threw myself against it but It wouldn’t move. I could hear my mom yelling, I yelled trying to get through, begging my mom to open the door, begging to know what was wrong,  but I just couldn’t get to her. I pulled the garage door open and ran to the front, it was locked. I turned to my neighbors all around me and yelled for help, but they just looked like I was crazy. I clenched my fist in frustration and shoved my elbow through the door's window, cutting my arm against the broken glass as I reached for the knob. I swung the door open and expected to see the worst to hear the worst, but there was absolute silence.

I got into the house and looked around, it looked untouched. I grabbed a kitchen knife and walked in further. My mom was nowhere in sight. I stood there, my hands shaking. I didn't know what to do. I just looked around, until I heard slamming from upstairs, and I yelled for whoever was there to get out of my house, then it was quiet again. I heard my bedroom door open slowly.  I could hear its voice. It growled.

 Like a fucking animal.

Though it didn’t sound right, it sounded like somebody screamed all day and then tried to imitate an animal. I couldn't see anything, the top of the stairs was shrouded in darkness. I screamed at it again then I heard it cough, a painful dry cough. It was quiet for a while before it called my name. It was my mom, at least, my brain wanted to believe it was her. My whole body screamed at me to believe it was her, but I knew better than to believe this thing. I clenched my jaw, waiting for it to move but it just stood there. 

I could hear it breathing, its voice may have sounded like hers, but Its breath showed the truth, it was heavy and low like a man’s. Then I heard the sirens, and so did it. I waited there staring up the stairs, I can only imagine it was staring right back at me. I slowly backed up, walking to the light switch behind me. I put my hand against the wall and slowly reached for it. I flipped on the light, but I could only see its eyes peeking from my door in the hallway.

It was my mother's eyes. 

“What do you do, where is my mom?!” I screamed.

“Her” eyes widened and said, “Markus, don’t be silly, why don’t you come up here and help me?”

I just looked at it and told it to come out. It started to open the door. I expected to see its long discolored fingers wrap around the door, to see it begin to stand up, rising to the top of the door, but that wasn't what I saw.

What I saw was my mother.

Its eyes, warm. Its smile, comforting. Half its body showing in the light.

“Markus, why don’t you come up here.” It said, much lower than before.

I looked at it, really looked at it. It looked like her yet so different, the skin, the mouth, the hands, the eyes. It was as if my mother had a twin, its complexion looked softer than my mother's, and it had a wider face and a comforting expression. I felt as if my brain was tricking my body, my shoulders relaxed and I lowered the kitchen knife slowly. I knew this wasn’t my mom yet I felt comfort in this thing's presence, I closed my eyes before looking back up at it.

This fucking thing, it ruined my life, I have spent so many years of my life trying to pretend this thing never existed, but it’s impossible to deny now. It opened the door wide, exposing its entire body, looking at me with a twisted smile. Its eyes widened with each second. It looked down at me with a twisted expression of pure happiness. I could see its jaw was hanging wide open. It took a step forward. I heard cars pull up infront of my house and I quickly glanced behind me.

I looked up the stairs, its face was filled with anger and frustration, but it just shut the door violently, sending a strong vibration through my body. I ran upstairs to search for my mom, she was lying upstairs in her room. She had glass sticking from her side, I hovered my hands over her not knowing what to do. I heard the door open and I begged for help. When police searched the house, it was gone. 

That thing nearly killed her and It would have killed me if I had been inside. When we made it to the hospital they rushed her away from me and I was left alone waiting in that cold hallway not knowing what would happen next. I sat in silence waiting for hours until they got her to a room. I walked in slowly and sat myself next to her. I tried to talk with her but she was coming in and out of consciousness. She was just in so much pain, all because of me, because I wanted to live my life like a normal person. 

I felt like a failure, I couldn’t protect her. I failed her, my dad, Billie, all because I wanted to play pretend. I felt so ashamed. My hands were shaking so badly, I couldn’t tell if it was from fear or hatred. I looked down at my hands.

 I couldn’t pretend anymore.
