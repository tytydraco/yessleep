I wasn’t the one who noticed the house.

That was Marv.

He lived across the street from me—retired electrician, mid-sixties, set in his routines. Bit of a worrier, but harmless. The kind of guy who trimmed his hedges with a level, watered the sidewalk cracks, and knew if a squirrel had farted three houses over.

If something was off in the neighborhood, he’d spot it before the rest of us even knew what “off” looked like.

One morning, I was grabbing my mail when he called out from his porch.

“Hey, Ricky! C’mere a second!”

I figured he was about to rant about trash day again, but instead, he just pointed down the block toward the house at the end. Faded gray siding. Two stories. Closed garage. Blank windows. Porch light that flicked on like clockwork.

“You ever seen the guy who lives there?” he asked.

I squinted. “Dunno. Moved in what… two years ago? Quiet guy, I guess.”

“Yeah, but have you seen him?” Marv’s voice dropped. “Like… taking out trash, getting the mail? Anything?”

I thought for a second. Then frowned. “Now that you mention it… no. Not once.”

He nodded like he’d been waiting to hear that. “That porch light comes on every night at exactly 3:12. Never earlier. Never later. No car. Mailbox’s always empty—but I’ve never once seen him check it.”

We stood there for a moment, just watching.

It wasn’t that the house looked creepy. That was the worst part.

It didn’t look like anything.

Just a house.

And somehow, that made it worse.

“I think we should check it out,” he said.

I laughed. “You serious?”

“What if he’s dead in there? Slipped in the shower. Been lying there for weeks.”

“If that were the case, the mail would’ve piled up. Place would stink. Somebody would’ve noticed.”

He looked at me.

“Exactly. Somebody. And now we are.”



I should’ve walked away.

But Marv was already headed down the sidewalk, robe flapping, coffee sloshing.

“Marv, don’t,” I called out—but he didn’t even turn around.

So yeah—I followed.

Not because I cared about the guy in the house. I followed because I was worried about Marv. He had a history of obsessing over things. A few years back, he spent three straight days logging the frequency of a transformer hum he was convinced was off by half a hertz.

This felt like one of those moments.

But different, too.

The closer we got, the quieter everything became. No wind. No birds. Just that kind of dense, ringing silence that makes your heartbeat feel like a drum in your head.

We stepped onto the driveway.

No car. No oil stains. Lawn wasn’t long, but it wasn’t cut either. Just… untouched. Like time skipped it.

Marv climbed onto the porch.

I stayed back.

“You sure you want to do this?” I asked.

“I didn’t come all this way to admire the siding.”

He knocked. Three sharp raps.

We waited.

Nothing.

No footsteps.

No floorboards creaking.

No one peeking through the blinds.

He knocked again—louder this time.

Still nothing.

Marv turned and gave me a look like that proved everything.

Then he crept to the front window, cupped his hands to the glass.

“Seriously?” I said. “You’re going full Rear Window now?”

“I’m not breaking in,” he muttered. “I’m just looking.”

I stepped up beside him.

Inside, it was clean. Couch. Coffee table. TV flickering with a screensaver loop. A single mug sitting on the table. Half-full.

“See?” I said. “Someone lives here. Just a recluse.”

“No pictures,” Marv said. “No mail. Nothing on the walls.”

“Some people like it simple.”

“Or maybe,” he said, “they want it to look like someone lives here.”

Then he went still.

“Upstairs,” he whispered.

I followed his gaze.

At the top of the stairs—through the narrow hall—I thought I saw… something. A shape. A figure maybe. Still and shadowed.

I blinked. Squinted.

It was gone.

Or maybe it was never there.

Marv stepped back slowly. “Someone’s in there.”

I didn’t answer.

Because for the first time since I moved to this neighborhood, I wasn’t sure I was alone in my own head.



That night, Marv wouldn’t stop.

He texted me screenshots of the porch light turning on. Timestamps. Circles around the same flicker in the same upstairs window.

He was unraveling.

But here’s the thing.

So was I.

Because we were both watching now.

And nothing ever changed.

No car.

No visitors.

No movement.

So we called the police.

Not 911. Just a wellness check.

“Never seen the guy,” we told them. “Something feels off.”

They sent a patrol unit the next morning.

Marv and I sat on my porch, drinking coffee, watching the cruiser roll up.

The officer walked up calmly.

Raised his hand to knock.

But before his knuckles hit wood—click—the door opened.

No footsteps. No delay.

No hesitation.

The cop didn’t flinch. Just stood there, relaxed.

“Just checking in, sir. Got a call from your neighbors. Everything alright?”

We waited for a voice.

There wasn’t one.

Still, the officer nodded. “Alright. Take care, sir.”

Then he walked away like nothing was wrong.

We asked if the guy was okay.

“Yep. Fine.”

No name.

No description.

Just fine.

Marv watched the patrol car turn the corner, then said, “There were no footsteps.”

I didn’t argue.

Because he was right.



After that, Marv changed.

Not drastically. Just enough.

He stopped speculating.

Started sounding… certain.

“He’s always in the hallway,” he said one night. “Standing there before the door even opens. Like he’s waiting. Like he already knows.”

I asked how he knew.

He told me he’d set up a wildlife cam across the street. Hidden. Motion-triggered. Pointed straight at the porch.

“Legal,” he said. “It’s my property. I can film my own view.”

But he wouldn’t go back himself.

He said the house had “seen him too much.” That it wouldn’t let him see it right anymore.

So we asked someone new.

Tammy LaRoux.

Nice woman. Walks her dog every day. Knew everyone’s name and birthday. Always up for being helpful.

We told her it was just a knock. A quick wellness check. She agreed without blinking.

We watched from my porch.

Tammy walked up. Smoothed her coat. Raised her hand.

And the door opened before she knocked.

She smiled. Spoke for a second. Nodded.

Then turned around and walked away.

Back at my place, she chuckled. “Sweet guy. A little off. Said he works nights. Sounded tired.”

Marv asked what he looked like.

She paused. “Tall, I think. Or thin. Standing back in the shadows. Couldn’t really make out his face. Voice was soft. Weirdly soft.”

Then she shrugged and went home.

Marv didn’t say a word.

He just went inside.



That night, he watched the footage.

I came over the next morning. He looked pale. Barely blinked.

“Watch,” he said.

We scrubbed through the video.

Tammy walked up.

Raised her hand.

The door opened.

And there, just inside the hallway, stood a figure.

Not approaching.

Not greeting.

Just there.

Tall. Pale. Bald. Too far back to be answering the door. Just… waiting.

Still.

And in the very next frame—gone.

Not blurry.

Just no longer present.

I leaned in. “That’s what’s answering the door?”

Marv’s voice was barely audible. “That’s what waits behind it.”



I don’t remember why I went.

I just remember doing it.

Marv had passed out, slumped over his notes. I left his porch. Crossed the street.

I didn’t knock.

Didn’t need to.

The door opened.

And it was standing there.

In the hallway.

Waiting.

Not moving. Not breathing.

And yet… alive.

I can’t describe what it felt like, standing there. I didn’t hear anything, but I knew what it wanted me to understand. Like it pressed something through the back of my eyes and into my spine.

It didn’t speak.

But it didn’t need to.

It showed me everything.

And I haven’t felt afraid since.



Marv came looking for me the next day.

I was already on his porch.

Drinking his beer.

Watching the street.

“You went over there?” he asked.

I nodded.

“You saw him?”

I nodded again.

“And?”

“He’s fine,” I said.

He just stared at me.

I smiled.

“He explained everything.”

Marv didn’t say anything. But I could feel his discomfort.

“He works nights,” I said. “Odd hours. That’s why the lights flicker. The footage? Motion blur. Nothing weird.”

I didn’t even think about what I was saying.

I didn’t have to.

The house had given me the answers.

They were always waiting.

“Let it go,” I told him. “You’ve been watching too long.”



That was the last time I saw Marv.

I don’t know where he went.

Or maybe I do.

Maybe he stepped inside, too.

Maybe the house kept him.

Like it kept me.



Weeks passed.

The gray house went dark.

Porch light never came on again.

But across the street—Marv’s old house—started changing.

The porch light flicks on every night now.

Not at 3:12. Not predictably.

Just… when it wants to.

Sometimes at dusk.

Sometimes at dawn.

The curtains never move.

But behind them, a soft glow pulses.

And sometimes, if you’re watching closely enough…

You’ll see someone standing in the window.

Tall.

Still.

Waiting.



People ask about him sometimes.

“Didn’t someone used to live there?”

And I always smile.

Because I know the truth.

Because I am the truth now.

And I say:

“Someone always lives there.”
