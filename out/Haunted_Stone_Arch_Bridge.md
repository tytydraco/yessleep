Opening shot of the Stone Arch Bridge in Kenoza Lake, NY. The camera slowly pans across the bridge, taking in its grandeur and the beauty of the surrounding nature. The sound of the water flowing beneath the bridge and the chirping of birds can be heard in the background.  


As the camera reaches the center of the bridge, it stops and focuses on a small plaque that reads "In memory of George Markert, 1892." The camera then cuts to a close-up of the plaque, lingering on it for a moment before cutting to black.

EXT. STONE ARCH BRIDGE - DAY  


A group of four people, the PARANORMAL INVESTIGATORS, approach the bridge. They are all dressed in dark clothing and carrying various pieces of equipment. They look around, taking in the beauty of the bridge and the surrounding nature.  


LEAD INVESTIGATOR  
(to the group)  
This is it, the Stone Arch Bridge. The site of the infamous hex murder.  


The group nods, all looking a little uneasy.  


LEAD INVESTIGATOR  
(to the group)  
Let's set up our equipment and begin our investigation.  


The group sets up their equipment and starts to explore the area. As they start to investigate, strange occurrences begin to happen. Strange noises, cold spots and feelings of being watched. The group starts to suspect that the ghost of George Markert is still present on the bridge.  


LEAD INVESTIGATOR  
(to the group)  
Something is definitely here. We have to uncover the truth.  


The group decides to stay on the bridge until nightfall in order to conduct a full investigation.  


As the night falls, the occurrences on the bridge become more frequent and intense, leading the investigators to believe that they are getting closer to the truth. But what truth is it? And what will they find out about the bridge?  


As the night goes on, the investigators continue their investigation, unaware of what horrors await them in the darkness.  


The camera cuts to black and the words "To be continued" appear on the screen.  


End of scene.

INT. PARANORMAL INVESTIGATOR'S VAN - DAY  


The PARANORMAL INVESTIGATORS, JASON, LIZ, MIKE, and KAREN, are sitting in their van, reviewing their equipment and discussing their plan for the investigation.  


JASON  
(looking at a map)  
Alright, we're here. The Stone Arch Bridge. The site of the infamous hex murder.  


LIZ  
(nervously)  
I've never been on a real ghost hunt before.  


MIKE  
(reassuringly)  
Don't worry, Liz. We've got all the equipment we need. And Jason's the best in the business.  


JASON  
(smiling)  
Thanks, Mike. But remember, we're not just here to hunt ghosts. We're here to uncover the truth.  


KAREN  
(looking through a camera)  
Let's get started.  


The group exits the van and approaches the bridge.  


EXT. STONE ARCH BRIDGE - DAY  


The group sets up their equipment and starts to explore the area. As they start to investigate, strange occurrences begin to happen. Strange noises, cold spots, and feelings of being watched. The group starts to suspect that the ghost of George Markert is still present on the bridge.  


JASON  
(to the group)  
Something is definitely here. We have to uncover the truth.  


LIZ  
(nervously)  
What if it's dangerous?  


JASON  
(reassuringly)  
Don't worry, Liz. We'll stick together and we'll be fine.  


KAREN  
(looking through a camera)  
I'm getting some strange readings on my EMF detector.  


MIKE  
(looking through binoculars)  
And I'm seeing some strange lights in the distance.  


JASON  
(nodding)  
Alright, let's split up and cover more ground. But stay in radio contact and be careful.  


The group splits up and continues their investigation.  


As the night falls, the occurrences on the bridge become more frequent and intense. The group starts to uncover more information about the hex murder and George Markert's life. They interview local residents and experts on the history of the bridge.  


As the night goes on, the investigators continue their investigation, unaware of what horrors await them in the darkness. Suddenly, they hear a strange noise coming from the center of the bridge.  


JASON  
(over radio)  
Everybody, meet back at the center of the bridge. Now.  


The group reunites at the center of the bridge, where they find a diary that belonged to Adam Heidt, the man who murdered George Markert. They find out that Adam Heidt was driven to do so by a deep-seated psychological disorder and the "hex" that Adam believed Markert had placed on him was actually a manifestation of Adam's own fears and anxieties.  


JASON  
(to the group)  
Adam's ghost, driven mad by his guilt, has been haunting the bridge in an attempt to make amends.  


LIZ  
(nervously)  
What do we do now?  


JASON  
(determined)  
We have to help Adam find peace.  


The group confronts Adam's ghost, and through the use of their equipment and their knowledge, they try to help him find peace and move on.  


EXT. STONE ARCH BRIDGE - NIGHT  


The group leaves the bridge, satisfied that they have helped Adam find peace. The camera pans across the bridge, showing the ghost lights of Adam flickering in the distance before fading to black.  


EXT. STONE ARCH BRIDGE - DAY (LATER)  


The group is seen standing in front of the bridge, holding a small memorial ceremony for George Markert. They place flowers on the plaque in memory of him.  


JASON  
(to the group)  
We may not have found the ghost of George, but we helped Adam to find peace and that's what really matters.  


LIZ  
(nodding)  
And now George's memory will always be honored.  


The group leaves the bridge, feeling a sense of closure. They pack up their equipment and get into their van, driving off into the distance.  


Fade to black. To Be Continued...
