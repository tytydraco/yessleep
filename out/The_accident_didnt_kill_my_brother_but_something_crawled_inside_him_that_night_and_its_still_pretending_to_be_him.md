We were driving through the mountains after my cousin’s wedding. Dad at the wheel, our mom humming along with the radio, and Aman asleep in the back, his head on my shoulder. It was late, fog thick as cotton. Somewhere near Bhujwara Pass, a truck came speeding around a blind curve and slammed into us. The car flipped off the road, crashing through the trees like a toy in a storm.

I woke up in a hospital bed, ribs cracked, face stitched. They told me I was lucky.

But Aman? He didn’t have a single bruise. Not even a scratch. Walked out of that crumpled mess barefoot, blinking at the stars.

They called it a miracle. I called it *wrong*.

Because the Aman who walked out of that forest wasn’t my brother.

He smiled too long. Talked too little. Watched everyone like he was memorizing how to be human. The first night back home, he stood outside my bedroom door until 3 a.m., not moving, not speaking. When I finally cracked the door open, he was grinning wide, glassy-eyed.

“Just checking,” he said. “You’re still in your body.”

I tried to laugh. He didn’t.

Things got worse from there. Mirrors started fogging up in empty rooms. My mother began forgetting words mid-sentence. And every few nights, I’d hear whispers under the floorboards something crooning in a language I couldn’t understand. Aman blamed the house settling. But the walls never creaked *before* the crash.

One night, I found him in the basement, standing in a chalk circle. Burnt feathers. Rope knots. Symbols etched in charcoal on the concrete.

“It keeps me *in*,” he said.

Then smiled.

The next morning, he acted like nothing happened.

Weeks passed. People in our neighborhood started talking. Dogs wouldn’t go near him. My best friend stopped coming over after Aman asked if he’d ever tasted someone’s soul “from the *inside*.”

Then came the dreams.

Always the same. I’m underwater, but the water is black, thick like ink. I can’t breathe. And in the distance, something is *crawling* toward me. A shape, tall and thin, made of shadows and rot. Its head is upside down, and its voice sounds like breaking glass.

When I finally told my grandmother our family’s last true believer in old gods and older curses she turned pale. Said there are spirits in the forest that wait for moments of trauma. Cracks between worlds. “If a door opened that night,” she said, “you better pray it didn’t stay open.”

I didn't tell her the truth: the door *wasn’t* open.

It was *invited.*

Because Aman had been... dabbling. Spirit boards. Rituals. Trying to “see beyond the veil.” He’d been doing it for months before the accident. The crash wasn’t just an accident it was a summoning.

And the thing that answered wasn’t done with him.

It used his broken body like a glove.

Last week ten years later I went through his old laptop. Hidden in a buried folder was a video. Taken the night before the crash.

Aman, in the woods, whispering something over a circle of bones.

Then a scream blood-curdling, primal and the camera hits the ground. Just before it cuts out, you can hear his voice, but it’s *twisted*, layered beneath something else.

“Let me in.”

Now, tonight, for the first time in years, Aman’s here. Visiting. Sitting at our kitchen table. He hasn’t aged. Still seventeen. Still smiling that not-quite-right smile.

Mom doesn’t notice.

Dad refuses to look at him.

And me? I’m upstairs, typing this while watching the hallway mirror… where his reflection just blinked.

But *he* didn’t.

If this post ends here, don’t come looking for me. I think the thing wearing my brother just found another crack.

And this time, I don’t think it’s coming alone.
