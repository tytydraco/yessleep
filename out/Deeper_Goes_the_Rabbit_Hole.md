I was fourteen the first time I remember someone dying. Two blocks from my house I was riding down the street and saw a man, motionless in his front yard, covered in blood. The man had just killed his family. Wife, two kids, their dog. Stabbed them each dozens of times, dragging them out the front door to be put on display for the neighborhood. It was a horror scene, but there was a crowd formed before the police showed up, and he didn’t move. He just kept repeating, “The book made me do it.” Soon after he was catatonic. I don’t think he ever recovered. The thing that stuck with me the most were his eyes. Wide, blank, like his mind had left before his body. I saw those same eyes in my bathroom mirror this morning but, I guess I should start at the beginning.

I love used bookstores. The older, the better. The kind where the shelves are overflowing, and you can smell the history in the air. Dust, old paper, and a hint of something that could be mildew but feels more like memory. I found the book in a used bookstore I’d never seen before on the outskirts of my town. It was wedged between a laundromat that had seen better days and a place that sold knockoff vape cartridges. The kind of store that shouldn’t still be in business, cash only, no receipts and very few customers.

Books were stacked floor to ceiling, the air thick with dust. Three dollars per book, no exceptions. I spent an hour scanning the shelves, running my fingers over the cracked spines, letting instinct guide me like so many trips to bookstores in the past. That’s when I saw it. A faded red hardcover with no dust jacket. There was also no author name on the spine, just the title in gold letters, half-peeled:

Deeper Goes the Rabbit Hole.

I picked it up and flipped it open expecting some bizarre take on Alice in Wonderland. No summary. No publishing date, odd. Just a single line scrawled on the inside cover "To those who seek the depths, may you find yourself within." I don’t know why, but I felt like the book had been waiting for me so I grabbed the three bucks from my pocket and gave it to the wholly uninterested person at the front counter.

I couldn’t put the book down. The protagonist, no that’s not right, the villain was called Clinton Dominic Grieves. A man with three names reminded me of the way serial killers and assassins are named. At first, Clinton Dominic Grieves was just a scholar, obsessed with lost knowledge. He wanted to understand the world’s forgotten corners, the gaps in history that no one questioned. But as he dug deeper, he learned how to slip through them. I was really enjoying the read, and noticed, scribbled in the margins of one of the pages was a weird handwritten note, “if you start, you won’t stop.”

Reality wasn’t solid for Clinton Grieves. He could unmoor himself from time, step through the cracks in existence. But the price was steep, he needed fuel, needed energy. Memories. Experiences. Lives.

He started small. A whispered secret stolen from a stranger’s lips. The taste of a childhood birthday cake, ripped from a man’s mind. A woman’s wedding day erased from existence, her husband left staring blankly, unable to remember why he felt so empty. The more he took, the less human he became. The more power he felt.

I couldn’t stop reading.

The first time I lost time, I chalked it up to exhaustion. I have been putting extra hours in at the office lately and the stress didn’t allow for restful sleep. I remember making coffee and I checked the clock, 8:00 PM. Read a few more pages and looked up, 11:45 PM. My coffee was cold, my limbs stiff, like I’d been sitting in the same position for hours, but I hadn’t even taken a sip.

The second time, I wasn’t so sure. I woke up with the book on my chest, my fingers curled around the pages. I didn’t remember falling asleep. Didn’t remember anything past midnight. It’s not unusual for me to read late into the night on weekends. It’s my stress release and really my only hobby these days.

I went to the bathroom and when I washed my hands, they didn’t look right. The skin thinner, paler. My nails longer. My reflection was off. The angles of my face sharper than I remembered. And there was nothing behind my eyes. I told myself I was tired and it was a trick of the light. It had to be.

Then I read the next chapter.

Clinton was in a crowded marketplace. He brushed against a mother carrying her child, and the little boy ceased to exist. Not just dead, erased. The woman blinked, confused, staring at the empty space in her arms. As I read, I could hear it. The mother’s scream. The absence of the child, crying out in some void just beyond the words on the page. And beneath it all, a breath against my neck. Did I have a child?

I took another break, 5 AM, to stretch my legs. I really should have gone to bed. Just put the book down and gone to bed but a vague memory in the back of my head came to the forefront. I felt like it was violently pushed to the forefront. That man in his front yard. At some point I must have grabbed a knife because it was still in my hand, but I didn’t have anything to cut. That was strange.

Maybe one more chapter.

Something shifted. The air in my apartment thinned. The walls seemed farther away. The book in my lap grew heavier, like it was sinking into my skin. And my eyes... I could barely see past the pages. My vision narrowed into a tunnel and I couldn’t close my eyes. They ached from dryness but I couldn’t blink. I know the sun must be up by now, but I can’t see anything but this book. I heard my phone ringing, but when I picked it up, the voice on the other end sounded garbled, none of it made any sense, so I hung up.

One more chapter.

I think I know how this ends. There is only one chapter left. The final chapter is waiting. I can feel it, humming beneath my fingertips. If I finish it, I won’t be me anymore. I’ll be watching, helpless, as Clint slips inside my skin, stretching it like a costume. I’ll see through his eyes as he chooses his next victim. I’ll feel the pleasure of his knife carving into flesh, the way he drinks in the last gasps of memory before they’re wiped from existence. And I won’t be able to stop him.

I have to close the book. I have to stop. I have to…

 

Just one more page.
