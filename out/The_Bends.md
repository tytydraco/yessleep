"Calm down"

"Slow your breathing.” 

“You need to slow down and think."  

My panic subsided, the sound of my heart pounding in my ears dissipated as my body focused. My ragged breathing became calm and measured. The gentle lull of the water’s currents flowed past as the muffled silence of the sea closed in around me. My air tank read just under 10% left. Damn, I’d been sucking air like I was running a marathon. My left-hand gripped the anchor line, leading back to the inflatable dinghy waiting on the surface. Down below, the prow of the ancient shipwreck stared up at me partially obscured in the shadows of the bottom of the sea. 

50 ft to the surface. 50 feet to escape. I checked my watch. 40 more seconds until the decompression break is over. 40 seconds until I can resume my slow ascent.  

I tried to ignore the shadow bobbing on the surface next to the dinghy. A humanoid shape resting at the surface of the ocean. Mark isn't moving anymore. He stopped a few minutes ago. I catch a sob in my throat, and my eyes sting in my goggles as tears threaten to break free.  



*Stavros' directions repeated in my head. I can almost see him standing in front of Mark and I in the resort villa. Sounds of splashing and laughter drifted in from the pool, as we were briefed on today's dive. "Now listen up, the bends are no joke. Under no circumstances do you ascend at any rate faster than 30 ft per minute. On this dive you especially need to be careful, with how long we'll be down there we'll need to take decompression breaks. Our bodies need time to adjust and offgas the extra nitrogen..." I can feel Mark's hand around my waist tighten, his eyes alight with anticipation. My heart skips a beat.*  

I'll never see those eyes again. 

 	*This was supposed to be the start of our life together. The start of our great adventure. Our honeymoon. Scuba diving in Greece with our own personal guide was a dream for us. Years of pinched pennies, overtime, and the generosity of family helped us make this dream come true. After a backyard wedding, we packed our bags and hit the airport excited for the adventure awaiting us.* 

*Eight days and four dives later we were one away from our advanced diving certification. This morning was our fifth and final dive, the "grand finale" as Stavros dubbed it. An unexplored shipwreck 110 ft down. When Stavros told us his plan over dinner, we both agreed immediately. An unexplored shipwreck was a once in a lifetime opportunity. That night as the warmth from the wine and food lulled us to sleep, unknown treasures came to me in my dreams.* 

*We set off on a beautiful summer day. When we arrived at the location our eyes scanned the water looking for a sign. After a few minutes Mark spotted a darker blue outline against the blue of the bottom of the ocean. The excitement was palpable as we geared up, checked and double checked each other's equipment. One by one we sat on the edge of the inflated dinghy and launched ourselves backwards into the water.  We all let air out of our BCDs slowly as we started to descend our diving weights controlling our slow fall into the sea below.* 



 30 ft to the surface. 

I looked down at my gauge, 7% left in the tank. I continued upwards at an agonizing pace. As I swam closer details of Mark came into view. His mouth and eyes left open trickled blood into the water enveloping him in a pink haze. His wrist, tangled in the rope jerks his body as another wave bobs the dinghy up and down. Could he feel as the compressed air tore holes in his lungs and as bubbles of nitrogen were introduced into his bloodstream? Did the panic mask the pain until it was too late?



*The wreck came into view as we sank closer. It wasn't a frigate or modern shipwreck but much older. It was an ancient Greek warship, wrecked on the sea floor. Rows of holes pocked the side where dozens of oars would once stick out, propelling the ship. A forest of coral covered the hull in bright pinks, oranges blues and yellows. Small shapes danced in and around the reef.  A school of small fish flitted by. Their scales were a pearlescent gradient of blues and pinks that sparkled in the low light. They danced around us before darting into the ship's rowers deck. A large green octopus with yellow rings observed us before sliding into a crack it had made its home. After taking in the rare beauty of the wreck we began to explore.* 

*Whatever sunk the ship left a giant jagged hole near the stern. A snaggle-toothed maw of shattered mossy wooden planks laid open, and we eagerly swam toward it. Thoughts of future discoveries clouded our judgement. We didn't notice the slow current that helped us along, slowly guiding us toward the opening. We didn’t notice that the water in the cabin was bitterly cold and stagnant. Outside was teeming with life and movement but inside the small cabin we were completely alone. As we entered the wreck we saw an onyx pedestal stood in the middle of the debris filled room.*

*Covered in broken planks and shattered ceramic it stood four feet tall and two feet wide. We could barely see the sparkle of intricate gold carvings on its surface. Stavros, Mark and I got to work moving aside planks in a hurry to lay eyes on the discovery.* 



A low groan from below roused me from the memory and reverberated through the sea. The temperature dropped as the sunlight dimmed. I spared a glance down at the wreck and regretted it immeadiately. Clouds of inky black billowed out of the hull. A pure darkness raced along the sea floor obscuring the wreck, the sand and the rocks surrounding it. The darkness was too deep, as if a trench opened up under me going down miles and miles where nothing could live in the bitter cold and crushing pressures.  As I stared, twinkling lights blinked into life from the abyss. I turned, kicking my legs faster, ascending towards the dinghy. Stavros wasn’t enough for this thing. It was coming for me.



*After a laborious few minutes we cleared the pedestal from the debris. It was a sight to behold. A black onyx pedestal that depicted pictures of a battle thousands of years in the past. The glistening carved lines inlaid with gold stood in contrast to the midnight rock of the pedestal. Carvings of warships charged down massive waves, ramming into their enemy.  Above the scene, in the inky black night a large golden eye surveyed the battlefield. Mark gestured to the top of the pedestal and we saw a half spherical depression stood empty.* 

*We began searching the ground, brushing aside shattered ornate ceramics and decayed wooden planks, searching for a lost artifact knocked loose from its pedestal millennia ago.* 

*I let out a cry and a burst of bubbles from my regulator as my hand brushed by something hard. Lying on the ocean floor was a sphere. The artifact was the size of a grapefruit. It shone in the beam of my flashlight, a brilliant gold. Mark and Stavros made their way to see my discovery as I reached down to pick up the artifact.* 

*The artifact was warm to the touch. A feeling of overwhelming comfort wrapped around my hands as the sphere shone like polished gold in my flashlight’s beam. Mark put his hand on my shoulder and leaned in to take a closer look. The light of his flashlight glinted off the edges of swirling patterns engraved into the surface. As the light danced across it the swirls almost seemed to be moving.* 

*The three of us stared at a fortune in my hands. The warmth spread up my arms and into my chest as the current gently nudged me in towards the pedestal. As if in a dream I floated to the top and placed the warm golden sphere into its place on top of the pedestal.* 

*We all floated, transfixed as the sphere began to rotate slowly in the depression of the pedestal. The engravings swirled up and down like the waves of a great ocean as a low thrumming filled the room. Faster and faster the waves crashed on the sides of the ball until it was a blur of spinning gold. Mark grabbed me by the shoulder and began pulling me towards the exit. Stavros stood transfixed and I just watched as the sphere stopped moving. A sickly crack of yellow light worked its way across the artifact. It hissed and screeched as the crack grew larger and larger. Like golden eyelids the crack opened revealing a massive yellow eye with a jet black pupil that filled the room with a sickly light. It stared at us, moving from one to the other cornea contracting and relaxing as it took in its surroundings.* 

*The eye shot up on a torrent of tarry black liquid that spewed from the top of the pedestal. It poured over the sides and spread along the floor. What once was the sea floor of the cabin became a vast nothingness stretching miles below the floor of the sea. My transfixion was replaced by fear as I launched myself  towards the mouth of the cabin. The blackness covered the sandy floor and when it reached the walls of the ship began climbing. Mark led the way with Stavros behind as we swam with all our might out of the wrecked ship.* 

*A low groan emanated from the nothingness. The sound coming from the depths of the cabin sounded like a whale’s death cry. A muffled scream reached my ears as stavros shouted. Something thin and dark had wound its way around his leg and began pulling him into the ship. His hands scrambled for purchase but the smooth hull offered no salvation. He pulled his diving knife, burying it deep in the ship, anchoring himself as his legs were pulled inside the hole of the wreck. I doubled back, reaching for his hand and our fingers touched before he was pulled again by the inky black tendrils snaking their way up his leg and around his hip. His knife held but his shoulder dislocated with a muffled pop as his hips were dragged into the hole.* 

*I reached out again as another chorus of cracking bones and cries of pain came from Stavros as his body was stretched beyond its limit. His eyes wild with fear caught mine. His hand could no longer hold on under the tremendous pressure and his scream echoed through the sea as he disappeared into the blackness of the wreck. I screamed as I turned around and swam as fast as I could up and away from the wreck.* 

*"Now listen up, the bends are no joke-"* 

*Stavros' words rang in my ears and I looked forward in horror, Mark hadn't stopped to help. He was already 30 feet above me kicking as fast as he could toward the surface. I yelled again in a rush of bubbles but he couldn't hear. I could see the panic in his body. Nothing I could do would stop his suicidal ascent. All I could do was watch as Mark slowly killed himself every panicked foot he swam towards safety*. *The pit in my stomach grew as I checked my instruments and began my slow ascent.* 



20 ft to the surface.

 The ocean has grown frigid cold as the clouds continue to cover the sun. The waves tossed Mark’s body and the boat back and forth. Below me the darkness has spread. It continued to reach up, getting ever closer toward me. I kicked my feet furiously ascending as fast as possible. 

10 ft to the surface.

I could feel the gaze as the yellow eye stared into my back. I saw it’s sickly light reflecting off my instruments. I felt a swish below me as something grazed my flipper. I have no time to look back. 

5 ft to the surface. 

Something tangled itself around my left flipper and pulled down hard. I kicked back and the flipper was yanked free. Ice crystalized in my mask, and my joints screamed out in pain as my body reacted to my fast ascent. Mark's body and the dinghy were almost within reach.   
  
Then I was face to face with Mark. His eyes, grey and lifeless, stared, deep into mine. The same eyes that teared up on our wedding day as I walked down the aisle. The eyes I was going to grow old with.

I'm sorry. I climbed, hand over hand, using Mark's scuba equipment as a handholds. The wind whipped sea spray into my face as my body tumbled into the inflatable dingy. I was in the middle of a storm. The boat was rocked by waves as I stumbled to the outboard engine. Through sea spray and rocking waves, I pulled the starter cord. I thanked Stavros for taking care of his equipment as the engine sputtered to life. I pulled the throttle, hard. The boat accelerated forward before it whipped around, anchored by the line tethered to the front of the ship. I was thrown to the floor of the dinghy and scrambled my way to the bow where the anchor line was tied. I reached for the diving knife at my hip, and begin hacking at the chord as something pulled from below. 

Black tendrils snaked their way up Mark’s body, pulling him deeper. As he was dragged down, the front of the boat dipped below the waves taking on water. His hand, wound around the anchor cord, pulled us below the waves. I took a breath as the icy water engulfed the dinghy as the front was submerged. 

Yellow golden light poured from the great eye as we came face to face. An abyss of starry night surrounded us as its tendrils pulled Mark and the dinghy. Stars and galaxies twinkled in the infinite ocean of space. The great eye studied me, an iris miles across growing and shrinking as a brilliant yellow cornea contracted. It was the finite and the infinite, floating in deep black space.   
  
With another hack the cord snapped. Mark disappeared under the waves as the dinghy rocketed towards the surface. The sputtering of the motor motivated my screaming joints as I threw myself at the tiller. I caught it in my hand and twisted hard on the throttle. The dinghy shot forward, speeding up the nearest swell and cresting it with ease.  
  
I sped back towards the island. The wind whipped my hair. Tears stung my cheeks as I let out a muffled sob. The clouds above grew more and more sparse. The sun began to peak through and the waves settled. I left the storm behind as I skipped across the water. 

 	I came to, in a hospital bed a week later. My mother held my hand as my eyes flitted open. For the next few days I underwent tests and took questions from the police. I told as much as I could and they let me go. 

I feel empty, drifting through the days. Through work, friends and life I am a shadow of my former self. I lay in bed tossing and turning anxious for sleep. When I finally drift off, the Great Eye calls to me from another place. It thanks me with warm, comforting dreams. I long for the peace it promises me. A future, holding hands with Mark as we drift from star to star exploring a new galaxy all to our own. A future without pain or worry.  In my dreams I feel whole, deep below the waves in the embrace of its infinite gaze.
