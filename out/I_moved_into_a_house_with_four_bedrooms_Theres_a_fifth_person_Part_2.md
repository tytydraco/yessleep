\[Part 1\]([I moved into a house with four bedrooms. There's a fifth person. : ](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1eog9po/i_moved_into_a_house_with_four_bedrooms_theres_a/)

So. Um.

If you remember, over the weekend, I kinda got into a real fucked up mess with some crazy witch/demon woman named Sjzona (Sh' - zoh - nuh for all you normal people out there who don't know how to pronounce mystical fairy tale sounding names and seriously why the hell is she named that is she a dark angel or a demon in disguise wtf is going on here)

Well, I know a bit more than I did then. As you imagined. Sjzona, as I suspec...hoped to God, isn't some crazy vengeful spirit out to claim souls or anything, but I can see how it would be easy to mistake her for something like that.

The next morning was Saturday, and I didn't have work. I woke up slowly in some kind of daze, and for a few moments I forgot what was happening and where I was.

Then I remembered. Oh yeah. I'm in the weird low-ceiling rectangular bedroom with no windows on the first floor that technically isn't supposed to exist, until some dumbass like me lets an obvious hint go over my head and falls for someone's tricks.

Well, okay. Some of you did call me stupid, but I'm joking. I stand by this not being my fault. Who the HELL out there would really have believed what Mr. Landa was saying? It sounded like the poor man was off his rocker when he tried to explain to me what was happening. Sjzona simply played on my common sense, and that's not my bad. Wait, why am I trying to defend myself against her? Let me tell this in the right order. Sorry.

Sjzona slowly woke up with me, stretching like a cat and groaning. She looked up at me with a sleepy smile. "How are you feeling?" she asked softly.

"Freaked out," I admitted, pulling myself up into a sitting position. "Door's still gone. Was all that real?"

She nodded, her black eyes almost seeming to shimmer. In the morning light, I could clearly now see the paleness of her skin (not that bad) and that her eyes and hair were both black as midnight. So were her clothes. Soft long-sleeved pajama clothes, but the kind you could still wear out in public without getting weird looks or having people think you didn't give a shit.

Then my eyes narrowed. *Morning light?* I turned around. There weren't any windows...but there was morning light filling the room, from some vague location. I looked around, wondering how in the hell, and I couldn't see any shaft of light that showed the source. It was just generally bright in the room now with a bit of a soft morning glow to it. But there was no light source at all. The walls themselves might have been glowing, I had no idea.

"Don't be too weirded out, Tim," she giggled. "You'll need to get used to some of this stuff. This is kinda your life now, don't you realize that?"

"Sjzona," I began, "I don't know how to even say this. But are you some kind of witch or something? I don't even know what HAPPENED last night."

She nodded slowly. "Reasonable," she said gently. "I won't beat around the bush to you, Tim. Let me put it like this. I'm human, but ever since I was a little girl I've dabbled, and then become experienced with, the element of darkness, if that makes sense. I don't know if I was descended from some great sorceress or something, but I've managed to pull a few strings to generally get what I want in life without hurting other people."

Her gaze softened further. "That's one thing I wish the world understood as a whole. Darkness isn't inherently evil. Darkness can be used to comfort people."

I blinked. "So...what am I to you?"

"To me, Tim, you're like a human familiar. But closer. I don't mean to use such trivial words, you're not *really* a familiar. But I've claimed you. That's what my circle does. There's not many of us, but it's very important that we each find a mate to live and die with. We call people like you Heartsomes."

She looked a little sad. "You wouldn't believe me if I told you everything I've done so far. But your life isn't going to become a nightmare, baby. I don't want you to worry. When you looked at me for the first time, I could tell by your gaze that you were a good, honest man who didn't want to take advantage of other people. That's all I needed to want to capture you and make you mine. Or else I'd have just made myself vanish and let you think it was a hallucination. It doesn't take weeks or months of drama for sorceresses, or whatever you'd call me, to figure out whether we've found the right man or woman. You're my first attempt, and I know it's a success without wondering about it. I already know I love you, and that we'll always be together."

She glanced down at the night table where my phone sat. "It's okay to tell people things, Tim," she said softly. "You didn't have to hide that from me. And on that site you posted to, people are supposed to just *act* like it's real without truly believing it is. It's fun for them. Nobody would actually *truly* think anything you're saying is real. It doesn't do any harm at all."

"How...how'd you know I made that post?" I stammered.
Sjzona tipped her head a bit, and a knowing smile crossed her face. "Even in my sleep, I'm watching you. Even when I sleep, you're in my heart and mind. You're my world now, and sooner or later, you'll naturally stop being afraid, and you'll learn to accept me, then love me too. I'm not a monster or a demon. This doesn't have to be that kind of plot twist. Not for you.

"I'll let it take time, okay? I'm sorry to be so bold, Tim, but you deserve the truth from me. I can let you take a while to think about all this. Just don't forget, this is your room, and...I wouldn't bother trying to explain this to the other guys. As far as they know, your room's always been down here, and there's nobody in it but you. Please, don't make them worry for your sanity, okay, Tim? And if they ever see or suspect anything odd, I can easily just make them forget. To them, I don't exist. To the rest of the world outside this house...it's all okay."

And behind her, the door slowly materialized into the wall.

She took me out to O'Brien's Irish Pub to see someone. A friend of hers, she called them, who would be able to help me understand and accept my situation more easily. She gave me directions while I drove.

The house, seriously, it doesn't seem to be warped in any way other than my room becoming the one downstairs. There's only four rooms in the house, after all. Best not to assume there's a fifth. If I ever start down THAT road again, boy, I can probably go ahead and dial the nearest asylum.

We got stuck at a particularly long traffic light, but Sjzona touched my arm, whispered something, and before I knew it, we were suddenly across the intersection, safely out of the way of the oncoming traffic. I gasped and felt my arms clench up. They tried to swerve the steering wheel----just a terrified gut reaction to fuckin' teleportation, I'm sure you understand----but Sjzona's gentle grip on my arm seemed to have paralyzed them both for a moment, and despite my body's intent to spasm, my arms stayed put. We kept driving straight, no sign of danger.

"FffffUCK!" I cried. "How did you----"

"Don't worry. Just try to get used to things like this," she reminded me, with a small, naughty smile.

Good God. This woman was basically my girlfriend now, or in her mind, maybe my unwritten wife already. Heartsome? Get real, I don't even know what the term means.

About ten seconds later, I heard a loud honk and almost jumped out of my skin. I looked in the rearview mirror. Some bearded redneck idiot in what was pretty much a Ford Rollover, tire to well gaps so big you could fit a less overcompensating car in there, was riding my ass despite the fact I was going five over. That was the fastest I ever went.

The horn blared again. Sjzona was looking behind us at him, and suddenly for the first time (not that we'd known each other long), she looked PISSED. Her face turned almost scary.

HOOOONK.

Sjzona raised her arm and pointed right at the guy through the rear window; I could see her in the mirror. She hissed softly, almost like a cat, and then shrieked,

"OMVÄND EFFEKT!"

The idiot laughed, and I could actually see his hand shift as he pressed on the steering wheel again.

The horn didn't sound as I expected it to. Suddenly his eyes went wide, and I saw his mouth open in a scream. The truck swerved wildly, tires grinding up against the curb, and I heard the screech of brakes as he spun around. The truck rocked dangerously, almost falling over, but righted itself.

The problem was, whatever had happened, now HE was pissed. I could see him yelling incoherently, pounding on the steering wheel as he rushed to catch back up with us. "Sjzona, what the fuck is going on?" I cried.

"Don't worry. Just keep going." She didn't sound tense. In fact, she was surprisingly calm for someone who'd just shouted some spell in a foreign language. I didn't know what she'd said, but I don't speak anything but English, so whether it was a regular language or not, I have no idea.

Less than a minute later, we were at another traffic light, and Mr. Beef (seriously, he looked like he could bench press his own truck) came pounding out and over to my window, greasy gray shirt, jeans and work boots flapping, jeaning and, uh, booting in the breeze, or some other bullshit, I dunno.

He stopped right by my window. "Open the goddamn door!" he screamed.

"Why?" Sjzona asked him in that same calm voice.

"You fuckin' changed my horn around! You threw something at me, you did some shit, and you're gonna fix it or I'll kick your slowpoke bitch boy's ass!"

Sjzona pointed at him again. Now, let me be clear, I have NO IDEA what the fuck she said next. But it went something like this (she actually typed it out for me, but said it was best she not tell me what it meant until later).

"Du kan inte skada honom. Du kan inte skada mig. Varje åtgärd är nu lika med en avkastning. Du kommer att betala varje gång. Blod betyder hämnd, och den undre världen är din väktare. Ruttna som en gris i växthussolen innan du ens hotar mannen jag älskar."

He just stared at her. "The fuck you trying to say? What are you, some fuckin' e-woman? Just open the fucking door and fix whatever you did."

I deigned to roll down the window an inch. "Hold on. What the hell happened to your truck?"

"The fucking horn blows INSIDE THE GODDAMN TRUCK NOW, you asshole! It fuckin' scared the shit out of me!"

"Kind of like you did when you tailgated me already going over the speed limit and lied to my face that I was being a slowpoke? Just because you're trying to drive faster than your quickest finishing time in bed doesn't make your road rage my problem. Now, would you fuck outta here before you sink through the ground? You and your rejection rate are makin' cracks in the goddamn pavement."

With that, I turned to face front, saw the other cars were long gone and the light was yellow, and pulled through the intersection while he stood there dumbfounded. Sjzona had a good laugh.

By the time we reached the pub, the mood was more subdued. She looked at me and said gently, "it might get rougher than that if people try to mess with you, sweetie. I can go farther than you can imagine. My powers are weak if there's no stimuli, but karma makes me stronger."

The smile on her face was almost frightening, but I found it oddly attractive. I know. I was kind of accepting things way too fast, wasn't I?

We entered the pub and found a booth way in the back. In just twenty seconds a server came to us, a lovely looking young tanned woman who might have been Hispanic or something. Again, I'm not trying to be rude, I just REALLY suck at foreign anything, okay?

(She was Brazilian. Sjzona told me later.)

She had long dirty-blond hair hanging down in frosted curls. I have to admit, the look really worked for her. In my opinion, anyway. Not like I'm the judge on women's appearances. How the fuck did I end up with Sjzona? I'm pretty average.

"Can I get you anything to start?" she asked, smiling in a very distinct way at Sjzona.

Sjzona smiled back. "Hej, vackra vän," she said softly, and the server's smile suddenly looked warmer and kinder, like that of a close friend.

"Had to make sure," she said softly, removing her apron, which suddenly seemed to vanish entirely. She leaned down and kissed Sjzona on the cheek. Then she turned and smiled at me. "Hey, hon. Feeling all right? I'm guessing you're new at the whole thing, aren't you?"

I barely managed to choke out a reply. "I...um...who the..."

The server giggled. "My name is Rengardia. I know what you're going through. Three weeks ago, I claimed my love too, like Sjzona took your heart for herself."

She turned around and looked at a booth two away. "Sam, come on over. There's someone I want you to meet. I think you two will get along *really* well."

From the booth emerged a short but slim blond woman, probably college aged and no more than a year or two younger than Rengardia. She wore a blank pink hoodie and looked nervous. "Hey," she said softly. "New, I hear?"

So let me speed this up. Rengardia and Sam are a thing, just like me and Sjzona. While the two caught up with each other at a table in the near corner, Sam and I sat in the booth talking.

"So this is real? It's legit? We aren't just on some crazy fucking reality show right now, or full of crystal meth in some back alley somewhere?" I babbled desperately.

Sam laughed. "Chill, dude. Meth doesn't work that way, and also, no. It's real. I mean, it's real, and it's really, *really* amazing living like this."

"'What do you mean?"

Sam's green eyes seemed to glow as she answered. "First off, Rengardia makes me feel like I never found love before, *ever.* If she was the sun, she could convince the moon to stay in the sky. And Sjzona's going to be that way with you, too. Plus, my job is getting AMAZING. Wherever you are, you'r probably about to get a lot of lucky opportunities out of nowhere, and you'll be living stress free in no time."

I just stared at her. "Sam, I don't know if I can really just believe this is happening. I mean, what's the catch? What amazing thing did I do to deserve any of this?"

She smiled at me and took my hands in hers. "You were just in the right place at the right time, and for all of your life, you've been a good enough person. You don't have to be perfect. Everyone makes mistakes, but as long as you're genuine and you wish no harm on the world, people like Sjzona and Rengardia seek you out. Just call it destiny, order some breakfast, and don't think too much about it."

A different server----that is, an *actual* server this time----was approaching our table. He was a middle-aged guy wearing rectangular glasses. "Can I start ya both with a drink?" he said in a pronounced Irish brogue. Well, you can't say O'Brien's doesn't hire to suit accuracy. We both got Cokes without ice.

I sat back in my seat, my head still spinning, but not as fast as before. There had to be some punch line. There had to be SOMETHING that made this all a joke, a dream. What was my life about to become?

Well, I'm typing this part after getting the answer to that question. I got up to use the bathroom, and pulled out my phone to give you guys the update you were asking for, and I got as far as the end of Sam's speech before I realized I was taking a while and decided to put it up for a bit.

I did my business, washed my hands (it's not that hard, God damn it), stepped out of the bathroom, and found myself face to face with that server again.

One hand was stuck deep in his pants pocket. "One sound," he said, his voice no longer Irish, "and Sjzona is gonna spend the rest of her short life mourning you before we slit her fucking throat."

Wh...okay.

He grabbed me by the arm and marhced me toward the nearby exit. Fuck, we were like FIVE STEPS from the others, but a small jutting piece of wall blocked me from their view.

He pulled me outside and started marching toward a small black sedan parked in the empty lot behind the pub. "Start talking," he said in a low growl as he pulled me along. "Where'd you meet those two demon bitches from, and what kind of hell's creature are you? What business you and Blondie got with a couple Spawn of the Night Crusades?"

I just stared at the guy as he shoved me against the car, glaring at me. "I mean it, little monster man. Whatever horns or claws you're hiding, you don't fool me. We've been chasing Sjzona for over a month now, and I finally get the honor of telling my guys her address thanks to you. There ain't no way anyone of her station claims a human, so drop the act, show yourself, and get explaining. Otherwise, you can watch from hell while she burns screaming to the ground."

I wanted to rip this motherfucker's front toothpick off and jam it down his throat.

There was a creak behind him, and he whirled around to face Sjzona, pointing at him with her face deadly calm. He whipped out his gun, and aimed it at her, a Colt .45, but she just smirked at him.

*Oh fuck.* We all know what was about to happen.

"I agree," she said softly. "He *is* more than he seems, and so are you. I've never seen a dead man walk and talk before. Underjordens änglar kommer att våldta dig med eld, slita köttet ur dina ben och festa på dina inälvor."

The man dropped the gun to the ground, frozen stiff to the spot, and I swear I actually heard his throat close up. I heard him gurgling as though he were choking, and then he----

*Jesus fucking Christ!* He started bending over backwards, farther and farther, until his head was almost back between his legs, staring at me in horror and anguish as blood ran from the corner of his mouth.

*CRACK!* There went his spine. He dropped to the ground, a bent human pretzel, and his skin started to sizzle and boil while he silently screamed in his faint gurgle.

Sjzona ran to me and took my hand in both of hers, turning to watch him as he slowly melted away and his bones crumbled to powder, then floated off in the breeze.

"Even angels can be brutal when it's necessary," she said softly.

"Sjzona," I gasped, my voice cracking in the most manly way possible.

"Okay," she murmured reluctantly. "I'm honestly not done explaining. In fact, there's a LOT to go."

She looked at me and took my face in her hands. "But you already know you have friends, Tim. No matter what happens, no matter who comes after you or what they try, we'll always be here to protect you. You're going to become a part of something bigger than you can imagine, and even Sam wasn't supposed to tell you, but it's going to be all right."

I just stared at her, shaking. "You----you lied to me?"

She looked down at the ground. "I did lie," she whispered. "I'm sorry. I didn't want you to be frightened about the prospect of losing your place in life. But you can't really think, after seeing this, that you would have been able to just go on living like nothing ever happened?"

She looked back at me again. "There's so much to learn. You'll have a new career, a new home, a new life once it's all over and done with. If I let you stay in Landa's house for too long, you'll become tied to everything I do, because you'll be my link to the real world. A link that can't exist. The fifth bedroom. It can't be there, Tim.

"Someday, someone else will move into the house and take over the room. Landa will say what he'll say, but there won't be anything mysterious anymore. I've found you. Now we have to move on together."

She put her hands on my shoulders. "But *only* together. Whatever happens, it's going to be a wild ride. But I know I found the right man in you, Tim, and before long, you'll be glad you left all this behind."

Okay, so, to summarize.

I'm Harry fuckin' Potter and I've just stepped into Diaholyshit Alley.
Sjzona's driving so I can type the rest of this update out (she's actually not doing it herself, she's controlling the car without touching it). Sam and Rengardia stayed inside only because she asked them to, but she took me back in and let them know what happened. They both promised we'd meet up again soon.

As Sjzona took me back out toward the car, I stopped for a second. "Hey, you don't think there were five Goddamn bathrooms in that place, do you?"

Sjzona smirked at me, and I could tell she was trying not to laugh. "Don't be a smartass." She kissed me, and we got into the car and took off.
