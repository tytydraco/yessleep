I moved into a new apartment a few months ago. It wasn’t anything special—small, but cozy enough for a single person. I didn’t expect much, just a quiet space to work and sleep. But over time, things started to change.

It began with the lights. At first, I thought it was just a faulty bulb in the living room. It would flicker every now and then, nothing out of the ordinary. But the flickering grew more consistent, to the point where it would happen multiple times a night. 

Then, one night, something odd happened. I was sitting on the couch, reading, when I noticed something in the corner of the room—just beyond the flickering light. I didn’t know what it was at first, but it looked like a shadow, a shape just barely visible in the dark. It wasn’t the same shape as the furniture or anything else. It looked… wrong. 

I assumed it was just my eyes playing tricks on me from the dim lighting. But it felt off, like I wasn’t alone. The next evening, I turned on all the lights, hoping that would help me shake the feeling. But when I turned back toward the corner, there it was again—this time clearer. A figure, hunched slightly, standing still. I could barely make out the silhouette, but I could feel its presence like an oppressive weight in the room.

The worst part? I realized it was facing me. It wasn’t just standing there; it was watching me. 

That night, I slept with all the lights on, hoping that would keep whatever it was away. But when I woke up the next morning, I noticed something chilling—two deep scratches on the floor, leading directly from the corner toward my bed. 

The light flickering grew worse after that, and I started hearing noises—scraping sounds at the edge of my hearing, like nails dragging along the floor, always coming from that same corner. I thought about leaving, but I didn’t have anywhere to go, so I stayed. 

Then, a week ago, I woke up in the middle of the night. The room was dark, and I could feel the air heavy with something that wasn’t right. When I opened my eyes, I saw it again—closer this time, right next to my bed, its features barely visible in the dark, but its outline unmistakable. It was so close that I could hear its breathing, low and ragged, like something trying not to be noticed.

I thought I was dreaming, but I wasn’t. The thing was real. I could feel its cold, suffocating presence.

Since that night, I’ve been trying to find a way out, but nothing seems to work. I’ve tried talking to neighbors, but they all say they’ve never noticed anything strange. The building manager said there were no reports of issues with the apartment, and that everything was fine.

But I know what I saw. I know what’s in the corner of that room. 

I just don’t know how to make it stop.

It’s still there. Watching.
