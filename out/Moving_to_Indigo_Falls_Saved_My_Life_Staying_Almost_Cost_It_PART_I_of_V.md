The gravel crunched under the tires as I pulled into the cabin driveway. My old Bronco rattled over the uneven ground as I glanced up at the place I hoped would be my salvation. A cabin, weathered by time and the harsh northern winters, stood quietly at the edge of a dense forest. When I saw it online, I could not have dreamt a more perfect place for my tired soul… but now that I was here, it seemed less appealing than I had imagined. Moss climbed the stairs. Tree roots tangled around the foundation like veins. I ran my hand over the cracked wood of the porch railing, feeling its roughness beneath my fingertips. No matter how dilapidated the house looked, it was vastly different compared to the savage streets of Detroit.

It has been 33 long years since the day my mother died from pushing me out of the womb, and I can still feel her pain as if it were my own. I ran away from that pain for so many years, trying desperately to feel anything else. I spent every cent I had ever earned on drugs, cheap booze, and fuel for the road. I have been running for so long, and yet, gnawing at me was a voice telling me to slow down... That there was a place for me out there somewhere. That is when I saw my way out. Nestled in the rolling hills of Northern West Virginia was a small log cabin for sale. The listing offered beautiful landscapes and a quiet 10-acre lot for the ridiculously low price of $115,000. For that much of a deal, I could not pass it up. I gathered the money I had left in my account from my inheritance, loaded up my ’79 Bronco, and headed toward my new home.

This was it… A chance to escape. To bury my past. To finally breathe.

I’d spent years on the road… weeks spent in cheap motels; nights filled with regrets and a numbness I couldn’t shake. But this place, this wild patch of land surrounded by towering pines and ancient oaks, felt different. Raw and untouched. Alive.

The air was sharp with pine and earth, the scent of rain lingering on the breeze. I inhaled deeply, chest tightening against the clean air. It was fresh and calm… but seemed to have something attached to it. Something I couldn’t quite make out. I unpacked my bags from the Bronco… the last material thing I owned from a past life. A life that I wanted to forget.

The quaint little cabin sat just beyond the town of Indigo Falls… a small dot on the map. A sleepy little West Virginia town that boasted only a small cluster of buildings that were barely visible from the highway. There were a few trucks, a general store, and a diner with a flickering neon sign that spelled out “Harlan’s” in tired pink letters.

The first three days blurred into quiet routines… time spent unpacking boxes, stacking wood, and exploring the thick woods that surrounded the cabin became the norm. The forest was both comforting and unsettling. Every crack of a branch underfoot echoed in the silence of the meadows and clearings. Shadows shifted just beyond the edge of the trees, as if you always had someone with you. The wind blowing through the canopy sounded like whispers flowing along in the breeze.

At night, the forest pulsed with life. Owls hooted, insects droned, and something deeper stirred... something strange... Something I didn’t understand, and yet, I didn’t care to. This place was paradise from what I had come from and endured. A little oddity here and there wasn’t going to scare me off.

On my fourth day in town, after a vigorous morning of chores, hunger and curiosity led me to the diner. I drove down the hill and across the covered bridge that connects the rolling hills with the center of town. Crossing over the small speed bump that separated dirt from asphalt, I spotted a sign that read “Indigo Falls – Population: 48”. This place was amazing. The roads had no red lights or even stop signs. The only cautionary measure was a yellow caution light that blinked intermittently at the center of town. I pulled into the diner’s parking lot and secured a spot. Harlan’s Diner was a squat brick building with chipped paint and windows fogged by steam. The place was packed. It looked like every person in town was having breakfast at the same time. The bell above the door jingled as I stepped inside. The smell hit me instantly... bacon grease, strong coffee, and something metallic, faint but unmistakable… the griddle, sizzling with eggs and bacon covering every inch.

The diner was full, aside from an open seat here and there. Old men and women occupied the creaking metal bar stools that lined the counter. They sat nursing their black coffee and folded newspapers, occasionally chatting with one another. Their conversations were low, punctuated by laughter that didn’t quite reach their eyes. As the door closed behind me, ringing the bell once more, all heads turned… not in hostility, but in awareness. They didn’t know me, and they wanted me to feel that. The silence was deafening as my feet froze to the sticky linoleum floor. I could feel every set of eyes on me like red-hot fire pokers jabbing at my soul.

Behind the counter was a woman. Her red hair was pulled back in a loose knot, strands falling over her face. She looked up and smiled, the kind of smile that someone gives as forced pleasantry.

“Don’t just stand there, come on in,” she said in a sweet, inviting tone.

I stumbled awkwardly as I turned in her direction and shuffled over to an open stool.

“New in town?” she asked, her voice warm but tired.

“Yeah,” I said, sliding onto the stool. “Moved into the cabin outside town a few days ago.”

She nodded. “I’m Clarice, but everybody here calls me Clara, hence the nametag.”

She pointed to her shirt at a patch that had “Clara” stitched in black thread.

“My name’s Elias Smith.”

She wiped her hands on a rag and poured me a black coffee.

“Well… Elias Smith…” She said in a playful, teasing way. “You’ll find it’s quiet here. Too quiet, some say.”

I let out a small laugh.

“Why do you say that?” I asked as I took a sip of my coffee.

“Well, some folks don’t like to be bothered… especially around here.”

She shot a glance over at an old man who was peering across the top of his newspaper at us. I glanced, following her eyes over to the man. As my eyes met his, he ducked behind his newspaper once more.

“Hmmm… Well, I guess I can’t say I blame them.” I responded, turning my head back around to meet Clara’s eyes.

“Don’t worry about that old grouch.” She said in a playful tone. “He just needs another cup of coffee.”

She shot another glance at the man, yet he didn’t reveal his face from behind the paper this time. She focused back on my face as she spoke to me,

“So, whatcha want for breakfast, hon?”

The rest of the morning was spent in playful conversation with Clara, the cute, red-haired woman who seemed to be sent here just for me.

Clara felt completely different from the people in town. She was kind and warm. A person who was gentle and understanding in such a way that you could talk to her about anything. Over the next few days, I finished the arduous move-in process. My reward was enjoying Clara’s company at Harlan’s with a strong cup of coffee and a hearty breakfast. 

I had been in town for only a week, but it felt like I had been here for decades with Clara behind the counter. She had become my beacon of hope in a place that I still wasn’t sure of yet.

“So…. You never told me where you were originally from.” Clara said with a curious look.

“Hmph… yeah, that is a story too long to tell over just a coffee.” I half-chuckled in response.

She leaned over the counter close to me, almost touching my ear with her lips, and in a half-whisper said,

“Well, I keep a bottle of Four Roses back here for when things get slow. Ya wanna get loaded and do naughty stuff behind the dumpsters out back?”

I choked on my coffee, and my face immediately turned red. She giggled, knowing that she had tripped me up with that comment.

“Hahaha, just messing... but seriously... I want to know more about you, Elias.”

“Ok… well, you can come up to my cabin if you’d like. It’s just outside of town, across the covered bridge, up past Grist Mill Road.” I responded confidently. “I can give you the address and you can come by when you get off… if that’s ok, of course…”

“Haha, that sounds perfect, honey.” She said with a smile.

Looking into her beautiful green eyes, I was captured… mesmerized by her beauty. I couldn’t believe where I had found myself. I found this place by accident… It was a pipedream I thought would never be achieved… and yet, another part of me felt like I was owed this life. I had been through hell to get here, and it was time for a change.

From the moment I met Clara, time seemed to fly by. Over the next week, Clara and I settled into a rhythm. Mornings at Harlan’s, sharing late breakfasts. Sometimes she’d take me on slow walks near the edge of the woods, pointing out plants and telling stories about the town’s history. Over that time, I told her all about my mom and her side of the family. I told her about the times I shared with people on the road and what city life was like back in Detroit. We talked freely with one another, but we both felt like the other was holding something back… hiding something.

At the beginning of my third week in town, Clara got off early and met me outside my cabin for a hike. We had become remarkably close over the last couple of weeks. As usual, this was our time to talk and decompress in the beautiful West Virginia hills. We walked down the forest trails, combing through the ins and outs of small-town life. As we walked, Clara grabbed my arm and snuggled in close to my side.

“So, tell me about your dad. You’ve told me all about your mom and her side, but you haven’t mentioned your dad much at all,” she said, giving me a confused look.

“Yeah, that’s a sore subject. It’s one of those things that I would like to just lock away and forget, you know what I mean?”

“I do… but you know we talk about everything, Eli. I want to know everything about you.” She said, smiling at me and pushing her cheek into my shoulder.

“I guess so…” I muttered in return.

“Well… are you gonna tell me?” she asked, pressing a little further.

I couldn’t resist Clara’s charm. She was my kryptonite. I had only known her for a matter of a few weeks, but it felt like so much more.

 “Ahem…” I choked up a little as I started to talk, “Well, it starts back when I was just a baby.” I paused, knowing that this part of my life was so traumatic, so intense that I had literally compressed it into a little ball and pushed it as far back into my mind as I could, hoping that it would die and rot away without ever resurfacing again. I continued, fighting the urge to bury it again, “My dad was a heavy drinker and a very mean person… As a child, my brother and I only knew beatings and pain. We would get beat for being late to school… beat for being late to dinner… hell, we even got beat for not crying when we got beat.”

“Oh my God, that is awful! I am so sorry, Elias. I didn’t know it was like that for you.” She said in a troubled and mournful tone.

“It’s ok. That drunk bastard killed himself with a 12-gauge during the Super Bowl about 16 years ago, so he got what was coming to him.” I said coldly.

“Jesus! He committed suicide in front of you!?” she asked, searching my face intently for the answer.

“No… my brother and I weren’t home… and it wasn’t a suicide. He was trying to shoot the neighbor's cat in our yard and dropped the gun while trying to open the window. Boom… just like that, he ended my nightmare… and my brother’s.”

She paused, not yet knowing what to say. Feeling the tension from the moment, I tried to lighten it by adding what I considered “the good part.”

“Well… It wasn’t all bad. My grandpa made a lot of money in the stock market before the dotcom crash in 2000. He died a couple of years later and left it to my dad. Since he didn’t have a will, my brother Josh and I received it as an inheritance when he died and split it. So, I guess the good thing about it is that I don’t have to worry about money anymore hehe.” I gave a slight chuckle, trying to relax the mood.

“Where is your brother now?” she asked.

“Last I heard, he had joined the army and was stationed in Fort Benning. He always wanted to be in the army. He was always talking about how he wanted to make a difference and jump out of planes. I never really understood it, but it made him happy.”

“At least he is doing something that he likes.” She responded.

“Yeah… I guess so.”

We walked a little further down the trail, silent. The conversation weighed heavily in the air between us. As the sun started to fall, she finally spoke up again.

“The Harvest Festival is coming up soon,” she said, kicking at the gravel on the trailside. “It’s the biggest event Indigo Falls has. Everyone will be there. It’s a... tradition.”

“What kind of tradition?” I asked.

She hesitated, eyes flicking to the woods.

“Old stories. Old songs. You’ll see… Will you go with me?” she asked, looking up at me with her intoxicating green eyes.

“Of course I will!” I responded quickly.

The walks I had with Clara were renewing my soul little by little. Each time we were together, I could feel a powerful warmth wash over me, and then I became calm. The townsfolk, however, weren’t as welcoming as she was. I stopped by the grocery store after mine and Clara’s hike to grab a few things for dinner. When I came through the door, I could see Jimmy, the clerk, standing behind the counter. 

Since I had moved in, he was always there, no matter the time of day. It seemed like all Jimmy did was work. As I walked by him, I nodded in his direction with a half-smile. He barely looked at me. He was a nice guy, by my estimation. The times I had come in before, he was pleasant and helpful. Something was different this time… something was wrong.

“Whatcha need?” he said with a monotonous groan.

“A few things,” I said. “Just a few essentials for next week.”

He shoved the items across the counter, making no eye contact. When I tried to make conversation, he would cut me off or ask an abrupt question.

“That all?” he asked, his expression becoming more irritated.

“Y-Yea I guess so...” I replied.

“Good, that’ll be $36.78. Cash only.”

Caught off guard by this, I quickly reached into my pocket, fumbling for the bills. He had never done this before. He always lets me use my debit card. Why was he asking for cash only? When I pulled my hand out, all I had was a 20 and a 10, accompanied by a wad of matted pocket lint. I held the money up toward Jimmy, mouth slightly agape, as if I were a mute asking if this would be enough with just my facial expression. His brow furrowed. With a violent rush, he sprang toward me and grabbed my jacket, pulling me close to him.

“Is this some kind of sick joke, buddy?” he snarled in my face.

“Wh-What do you mean? I-I’m just trying to pay for my groceries. Look, here’s cash. It’s all I have on me right now.”

“Ha! You know damn well that ain’t what I said. I SAID, THIRTY-SIX DOLLARS AND SEVENTY-EIGHT CENTS… NOT THIRTY, YOU FUCKING IDIOT!” He screamed in my face. “IF YOU DON’T HAVE THE MONEY, THEN GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY STORE!”

He pushed me away from him while releasing my jacket. I stood stunned for a moment. I had never had anyone in town act like this toward me, especially not Jimmy. He stared at me, red-faced, veins popping from his neck, fuming over the audacity of my ignorance. The fact that I came in to buy groceries without exact change was inconceivable to him. As I stumbled out of the store empty-handed, all I could do was think about how this place felt… different… changed in some way.

The air in town felt charged... like I’d walked into a spider’s web and the spiders were watching me, waiting. I noticed people stopping their conversations when I approached. The few kids on the playground would fall silent and glance away. Older women eyed me over knitting needles, their fingers tightening involuntarily, knuckles turning white from the force. It felt like I was becoming an outcast in a place that just weeks ago was my refuge. It felt like everybody was starting to hate me for some reason.

The next night, after Clara closed the diner, I invited her to my porch for a few drinks. The sky was a patchwork of stars behind the dark silhouettes of trees. The crickets provided the perfect ambience for her pleasant company.

“Did you hear how Jimmy acted toward me yesterday?” I asked.

“Yeah, it was all he could talk about when he came in for dinner last night.” She responded.

“I had some weird encounters with the folks in town as well… it’s been… strange lately.”

She lowered her head, staring at her glass. She ran her finger around the edge slowly as if she were in a trance.

“Why do you think they act like that?” I asked, taking a sip of a beer.

She looked out into the woods, tracing a pattern on the weathered trees.

“Because they’re scared,” she said softly. “Scared of change… of outsiders. Indigo Falls likes its secrets. It’s how they keep the town... safe and healthy.”

“Safe from what?”

Her eyes met mine, filled with sadness I couldn’t place.

“From what’s in these hills.”

These hills? I pondered... my eyes slowly scanning the darkness.

The more I stared into them, the more they felt alive. I could feel them watching... breathing. Strange sounds echoed in the distance... a low hum… the snap of twigs... not animals, something else. The mystery of the hills around me had become front and center in my mind. I couldn’t place it, but something had shifted in the air, and it was starting to cause my little piece of heaven to crumble right in front of me.

“Is there anything I can do to stop it?” I asked.

“No… these folks have been here a long time… and I do mean a very long time… They don’t like anybody coming in that they don’t know.” She continued. “Every year around the harvest festival, it gets this way. It will pass, and they will get back to normal. It’s just an old tradition that started a long time ago, and people never really let it go.”

My eyes searched her face as she spoke. Her words reassured me. There was nothing that Clara couldn’t fix in my mind. I just had to endure this weird “tradition” of outsider hazing or whatever they wanted to call it, and then hopefully we could get back to normal.

The rest of the night after our conversation was routine. Clara and I spent the evening swapping stories and laughing with one another well into the night. The idea of the hills having secrets stuck with me, however. My mind couldn’t erase the look on Jimmy’s face when he grabbed me. He had true hate in his eyes. I hadn’t seen that look since my dad was alive. I needed to focus on more important things to get my mind off it.

The next day, I made my way down to Gene’s general store to purchase some nails and boards for the cabin. The railing was getting on my nerves and would give me a nasty splinter every time I tried to grab it. Entering the store for the first time, I could hear the tired, old speaker behind the counter playing old music. It sounded like slow jazz… something old. I grabbed my items and approached the counter.

“Good morning, sir. I hope you found what you were looking for.” The man said in an upbeat and jolly tone.

“Umm… Yeah… I did. Do you—”

He cut me off before I could finish asking my question.

“That’ll be $16.25, sir.” He announced with a wide smile.

 “Uh…. Ok… Do you take debit cards?” I asked.

“Tsk… No, I’m afraid not, sir. Cash only here. Sorry about that.” The man responded, clicking his tongue against his teeth.

“No worries, I have some cash on me.” I quickly responded. I had prepared for this scenario ever since the Jimmy situation happened.

I pulled out a handful of bills and began counting the total on the counter. As I counted the bills in front of him, his eyes left my face and slowly rolled down to the counter below. Still smiling, his face started turning pink… and then red… his eyes started bulging from their sockets, and he began gritting his teeth so hard that I could hear them grinding behind his smile. Suddenly, he slammed his hand down against the counter, rattling the coins and flattening the bills I had placed.

“This isn’t a bank… sir.” The man said through gritted teeth, still trying to hold his smile.

“I’m just trying to count exact change for you. I know you need exac—”

He cut me off again before I could finish.

“Like I said… This is NOT A BANK……SIR!” His face was now blood-red, and his eyes stared at me with pure vitriol.

“Ok, ok, no problem, man, easy. I don’t want any issues here.”

He stared at me, his hand shaking with anger, clenching the bills on the counter. Then, as quickly as the anger flared, it vanished, replaced by a chilling silence. The old radio had become more apparent now. An old jazz tune had become the background of our staring contest. A slow, almost predatory smile spread across his face before he spoke.

"You know too much," he remarked, his voice dangerously gleeful.

“What? What do you mean I know too much?” I asked, full of confusion.

“Have a wonderful day, sir, and remember, don’t nix it, Gene can fix it!” He answered, not acknowledging my question.

I turned to leave. As I made it outside the store doors, I looked back through the window. There, I saw Gene still standing behind the counter, that same smile plastered on his face, staring at me as I walked down the steps.

The next night, just after midnight, I heard footsteps crunching outside my window. I grabbed a flashlight and my revolver from the bedside drawer. I was in bear country, and I did not want to become dinner for whatever was out there. My heart pounded as I crept through the cabin, following the sound of the footsteps as they crunched toward the front door. The more I listened, the more they sounded like someone walking. This was no bear… it was a person. The sounds were now coming from right outside… heavy footsteps creaked across the slats on the front porch. I grabbed the door handle and, with a deep breath, swung the door open. As the door opened, I clicked the flashlight on and leveled the revolver in the middle of the beam. I scanned the porch and the surrounding area, but there was nothing… Nothing but shadows and silence. The idea of a person skulking around my cabin did not sit too well with me, especially in these hills… especially with how everyone has been acting.

The next couple of nights were more of the same. I would hear footsteps approach my window at midnight, creeping their way around the cabin until they drew me to the front door. I foolishly took the bait every time, looking like an idiot standing on my porch with nothing but boxers, a Maglite, and my dad’s old .38 revolver.

That Friday, I headed back into town to do my weekly grocery run, no matter how much I dreaded it. I knew Jimmy was going to give me shit, no matter if I had exact change or not. I learned my lesson quickly on the cash-only request. I received my groceries and endured Jimmy’s hate-filled eyes as I paid and made my way out to my truck. I loaded the groceries into the Bronco and started to hop into the driver’s seat when a wild thought struck me. I decided that, instead of getting in the Bronco and driving straight home, I was going to take a walk around town and take in the cool weather that was starting to roll in. I needed some time away from the cabin. 

I walked down toward the center of town where the town hall sat. I rounded the turn on Quincy Street, head down, pondering the curiosity of this place, when suddenly, I was struck hard in the shoulder by what felt like a semi. I was sent flying, eventually crashing to the ground in a heap. As I lay on the ground trying to get my bearings, I heard a deep, raspy voice ask,

“Whoa there, boy! You ok?”

Still dazed, I couldn’t respond to the question yet.

“Sorry bout that, son… Don’t see as well as I used to. Sometimes I just run right into shit and not even know it... hehehe.”

I finally gathered my wits about me and looked up at the man. He was tall and lean, his face weathered like bark, eyes sharp but cloudy, like they had seen things no human should ever see. He wore an old pair of overalls with a red shirt underneath and a straw hat that looked like it had seen better days.

“Yeah, I’m ok. I should’ve been looking when I came around that corner.” I replied.

“Heh, no worries, son. These days everybody is on that damn phone looking at stupid shit nobody cares about. It happens more times than you think.”

I laughed as the old man helped me up. His lips and skin looked parched and worn, like an old leather satchel, and he had one brown tooth that stuck out when he spoke.

“The name’s Tom. Tom Sheffield.” He boomed. “And you are?”

He stuck out his hand for a handshake.

“Elias… Elias Smith.” I responded, grabbing the man’s calloused hand.

With a firm grip, he shook my hand and shot me a half-smile.

“Where ya headed, son?” He asked.

“Well… I was just walking around a bit… but I guess I’m gonna head on back to my truck.” I responded.

“Well good, I’ll walk with ya. It ain’t every day I get to talk to someone new, ya know?”

“Ehh… That’s ok, I don’t want to interrupt your day.” I said in return.

“Nonsense, I need to stretch out the ol’ legs anyway hehe.”

Tom walked with me back to my truck even as I protested. I was already on the bad side of most people in town for reasons I didn’t understand… I didn’t need to owe anybody any favors or piss anybody off. As we walked, he kept a happy and carefree demeanor. We talked the entire way back.

“When’d you move to town?” he asked, his smile slightly fading from his face.

“I’ve been here about a month or so. I like the place, but some of these people are just… strange.” I replied.

He gave a slight nod and looked forward as if he knew exactly what I was talking about. As we approached my truck, he pulled out a pack of cigarettes and stuck one between his weathered lips and spoke.

“Well, son, this town has some strange history. Hell, I live here and still don’t understand it.”

He took a drag on his cigarette.

“I lived close to here as a boy ‘til I got sent to Vietnam. I wasn’t much the same after I came back from that. I had some… issues at home when I got back and had to move here. I never felt like this place was home for me. I’ve only lived here for ten years myself.”

He took another drag, squinting his eyes as the smoke encircled the brim of his hat.

“This town’s got its layers,” he said, voice rough. “People like to keep the surface smooth, but underneath... things aren’t so simple.”

“What kind of things?” I asked.

He flicked ash onto the ground.

“Things that people don’t like to talk about.” He answered. “Now you get your gear and head on home before it gets dark. These roads get dangerous at night.”

He took one more long drag off his cigarette and flicked it to the ground, stamping it out with his boot.

“You take care now, ya hear? Nice meetin’ you, Elias. I’ll be seein’ ya.”

The man walked back the way he came, leaving me with more questions than answers. Confused, I climbed into the Bronco and made my way back home.

That night, I lay awake, listening to the wind twisting through the trees. Tom’s words swirled in my mind.

“What did he mean by layers?” I asked myself. “And what don’t these people want to talk about? What is so secretive?”

The thoughts raced through my skull as I lay in bed, trying not to think about the footsteps actively crunching around the cabin’s perimeter. Indigo Falls was no longer my safe haven… It had become a cage.

  
END OF PART I
