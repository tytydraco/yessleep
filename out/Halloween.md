Back in 2017, there was a kid in my grade that everyone got along with. Out of respect, I won't put his name out there, I will refer to him as "F" for this story. Anyways, we were in 7th-8th grade, I never met him personally, he went to a different school than I, but we had lots of mutual friends. He seemed like a good kid, every time I would see him on my friends snapchat/instagram stories he would always be doing something silly, making everyone around him laugh. He seemed like the type of person you want to have around you know?

One of my closest friends "M," who knew him very well, told me that "F" was going through some problems at home. I don't even know how we started the conversation but I remember we started talking about how crazy it is that some people can act so happy around friends, but then be in a shitty place deep down. "F" told my friend that his parents are always arguing constantly, sometimes they'd both team up on him and just completely tear him down. I can't imagine what emotional abuse does to someone in middle school.

Now it's October of 2018, this was around the time where people in my area would still decorate their houses for halloween. "F" had gotten into a really bad argument with his parents, I can't tell you what about, but I'm assuming his parents didn't let him go out with some of his friends on halloween night. This is what I've always assumed because all of the snapchat and Instagram stories i've seen of him were taken at school. I've never seen him out late at night, or let alone, off campus. So I assume that this one night, F couldn't take it anymore. He got into a really ugly argument with his parents, and he stomps out of the house. He goes missing. There are "missing person" posts on social media, nearly all of my friends are reposting it. That entire night, nobody knew where he was. Then the morning comes around. This happened years ago, and I've only heard about it, but the thought of it still lives in my head. They found "F," hanging from a tree... the morning after Halloween. The morning AFTER Halloween. It's been almost 5 years, and I can't shake the thought of kids and families walking past what they thought was a "halloween decoration." Everyone was a little quiet after that for about a week, a lot of posts dedicated to him, they even held a vigil service for him. This really shook everyone, being in 8th grade, we don't really know how to react when something like this happens.

My prayers go out to the the family and friends of "F." Please tell your friends and family that you love them, always check on them, they may look all happy when they're out in public, but you won't ever know for sure until you ask.
