The Mariani family has lived in this country for generations, we were a loud and proud bunch from the boot. Everyone always stereotypes Italian immigrants as brutish thugs, or that we are all connected. Unfortunately, my family liked to live up to those stereotypes.

From the moment we stepped of the boat it seemed like we were fined tune to trouble. My great grandfather got his start as a bootlegger, right on the tail end of prohibition.

Vinchenzo "The Wall" Mariani; my grandfather, a respected Cappo in one of the five families.

Which leads us to my father, Frank Sr, who never really had the temperament or fortitude for the life. A fact that Papa Vinchenzo respected, all things considered. Still, it was different back then, he was expected to keep up appearances, make like he was grooming an heir.

So, he and dad came to an understanding; Dad would make small collections, drive some friends around on errands. It would all work out, as long as he didn't ask any questions. Dad wasn't *stunad*, he had some inkling about what was happening on those drives. This went on for a few years and ended somewhat abruptly.

My father moved away and distanced himself from that part of the family. We rarely saw the "black sheep" Mariani unless it was for a wedding or a funeral. The last time I saw Papa Vinchenzo was a few weeks ago at my cousin Vincent's funeral actually. He went around the room shaking hands and offering condolences, gabbing with anyone who would indulge him. He and dad said few words to each other, and it was then I decided I needed to get the full story of their fallout.

That night I cornered him in the kitchen, asking him why he was so cold to his own father. I laid on the guilt heavy on him, but he scoffed at that.

"When I was your age, If I talked to my father like that, they would have found me in seven different dumpsters." He exclaimed.

That probably wasn't too far off from the truth. I urged him on, and he got quiet, dwelling on the past. Finally, he spoke up.

"Frank did I ever tell you, about some of the jobs I did for my old man?" There was a grave tone to his voice. He went on to tell me about a few stories from his time North Jersey. They fascinated me, some of it sounded so outlandish.

He told me about the first time he went on a collection run. He didn't have his own set of wheels yet, and Papa Vinchenzo loved his son very much, but not so much as to let him drive his 1958 Cadillac. He ended up showing up at the brownstone of Paulie Caruso; hat in hand meekly asking he could use his car for the gig.

Well Paulie was beside himself, smacking him across the head as he threw dad his keys. Paulie drove a ragged Brown aspen, a permeant dent in the hood from some drunken brawl down at Cindy's. They got in and Paulie pointed down the road and they set off on his first collection run.

Now for this first one, dad reiterated, he didn't leave the car. They travelled all-around town, sometimes circling stores three or four times before Paulie had him slam on the breaks. He would calmly get out of the car and enter whatever bar or bakery they had parked themselves in front of. Dad would hear the ringing of a bell and some store owner loudly welcoming in Paulie, who took in this wealth and good cheer with glee.

It would often be a few minutes before he would come back out, tucking something into his pocket. He was all smiles with the owner when he would leave, sharing a laugh or a pat on the back with them. But the moment he sat his eyes back on the Aspen, his expression would stone over, those beady eyes of his long since losing their soul.

Only once that day did a collection take long. It was their second to last stop of the day; a bait and tackle shop that had just opened up. Paulie's face darkened more than usual as they pulled up, and he saw the owner twiddling his thumbs at the register. He pointed at him with such force; it was like he expected the owner to vaporize with a glare. 

"This gentleman-" Paulie explained. "-Is always short." Paulie slammed the car door shut in a huff and made his way inside.

Now Paulie was not a very tall man. He was about 5,4 bit of a beer gut and had the face of a century old bulldog. He also had the temper of one as well, dad could see the shop owner's face explode in terror as Paulie strode over to him, as he shot that shark tooth grin at the man.

He couldn't hear what they were saying, Paulie was simply nodding as the man spun some yarn, gesturing to his register and the empty store around him. Paulie seemed understanding and took the man by the shoulder and led him to the back. It was then my father noticed Paulie had spun the closed sign around when he had entered.

It was about half an hour before Paulie emerged, like a ghoul hiding in the shadows. He came out of an alley way, glancing up and down the street in a paranoid fashion before waltzing back into the Aspen, huffing and puffing. Dad noticed Paulie's knuckles were throbbing and raw but said nothing.

 "Nice enough guy, shame his business ain't taking off like he thought it would." Paulie said, cutting into the tension in the air like a butcher swinging his cleaver. 

"Didn't see him come outta the back." Dad mumbled. Paulie gave him the side eye.

"I was helping him do some inventory in the back, he took a bad fall. Told him to take a day, ice his leg a little." Paulie remarked casually.

"I'm a helpful guy; ya know that right Franky?" Paulie asked him, a deadpan look on his face. My dad sputtered and tried to reply but Paulie laughed, jabbing him in the gut playfully. "Hehe, you're a good kid. Pull up to that Butcher shop round the corner, I'll buy ya a hero."

And that was end of that, he never brought up the tackle shop after that. That shop would end up going under a few months later, some of Paulie's associates had come in and ransacked the place taking everything but the cooper wiring. He never heard about what happened to the owner, but he could imagine; and left it at that. 

Dad did well as a driver, having a few regulars who requested him specifically. They tipped big and treated him well, if for no other reason than he was the boss' son. Eventually father was able to afford his own set of wheels, red gawdy looking Vega. That car was dad's pride and joy and had very strict rules about it that he enforced on the wise guys.

One of these rules was " No carpets."

Before I could even ask dad explained the origin of that rule. One night he got a call from Paulie, a friendly but strained tone in his voice. He knew it was late, but he needed him to come pick him and his buddy up from some club in Newark. Dad knew by no not to argue so he hopped in his car and headed to some sleazy nightclub. He went around back and saw Paulie standing there with his buddy, Sal Valentine.

Sal had the nickname "Waddles" due to a case of gout he had that got so bad he ended up having half his left foot amputated. Paulie saw my dad pull up and reached for something behind his back, relaxing only when he saw who it was. Sal waddled up to the passenger side and got right in, reeking of cheap booze and cheaper women. 

"Hey Franky boy how's your rash?" He joked. "You look good, you been hitting the gym, important thing for a kid your age, gotta stay in shape for the ladies huh." He had a crazed look in his lazy eyes, but dad met his gaze and held it. Though out of the corner of his eye, he noticed Paulie lugging something behind the Vega and popping the trunk."-I tell you Frank you got it easy being young, whole life ahead of you, some people don't know what they got till they lose it ya know haha."

Sal was rambling now, and Paulie overheard him, slamming the trunk and heading to the backseat, snapping his fingers. He flashed sad a smile as he came in. 

"Heya Frank, sorry to disturb your beauty sleep there but eh, well waddles over here had a bit too much and lost his keys." Sal smiled sheepishly, grinding his teeth at the mention of his hated name. 

"No problem, man. You guys heading home?" Dad offered.

"Well, uh, we need to make a quick stop first-down by the docks."

"Down by the docks huh." Dad grumbled as started the engine. 

"Yeah, left some paperwork back there." Sal countered. Paulie shot him a look, and he snapped shut real quick. The drive over to the docks was unusually quiet. It was about 1am, the roads devoid of travelers and the cops had pretty much packed it in for the night. The radio droned on, playing some quiet melody that dad couldn't quite place.

He was so focused on that he didn't hear the light thumping coming from the back. Paulie heard it before him, and from the rearview he could see all color drain from his face. He heard a louder thump now, more deliberate. Dad raised his eyebrows, besides him Sal glanced out the window ignoring the elephant in the trunk. 

"What was that noise?" He said, watching Paulie in the rearview. He shrugged the question off.

"You see the game last night; O'Brien took a fucking header huh?" He said all chummy. More thumping as Sal shifted next to him.

"Lotta potholes on the road Franky, gotta watch out you'll ruin your suspension." He spoke. Paulie looked like he wanted to strangle him. Against his better judgement, dad pulled off to the side of the road. He could see Dock 55 in the distance, massive overhead cranes marking the promised land. The thumping became frantic now, panicked even. Paulie threw up his hands as Sal got out of the car.

"What the fuck is back there." Dad asked plainly.

"Nothing, old carpet don't worry about it." Paulie mumbled as Sal popped the trunk. A muffled voice cried out from the back, as Sal began shushing insistently.

"Pretty chatty for a carpet." Dad remarked. There was a smacking sound from the back as the carpet began to cry out, a little less muffled now.

"Waddles you limp wristed fuck you let me outta here right now or I'll-" Waddles silenced the carpet with a solid left hook and gave him three more for good measure. The trunk slammed shut behind him and Sal came back, wincing as he held his hand. Dad clucked his tongue and turned the radio off, facing Paulie. Paulie held the facade of a mean bastard, but his eyes sang a tragic tale of embarrassment and guilt, a rarity for a man like him. 

"Does my father know you have Antiono Petriello in a carpet?" he asked him, not a hint of fear in his voice as he stared down Paulie. 

"It would be prudent if he didn't." Paulie finally admitted. My father simply nodded and pulled back onto the road.

The docks were deserted, by design of course no one was dumb enough to loiter around Dock 55 after hours. It was an open secret that 55 was where Mariani family problems went to disappear. No questions asked, you just secured your luggage in a container marked with a red X, and in the morning a cleaner came in and ferried them out to sea.

Dad sat in the car as Paulie and Sal loaded up the carpet, never to be seen or spoken of again. Paulie pulled him aside after the fact, apologizing profusely as he promised he wouldn't pull that stunt again. Paulie produced a wad of hundreds out of thin air, successfully bribing my father to not utter a word of this to Vinchenzo.

Sal didn't say anything after the fact, though he did give the warehouse one smug look as he limped over back to the Vega.  None of this would matter in the long run to my father, though a few days later he did find a few specks of blood in his trunk, and he spread the word to Paul: " No carpets"

Dad went on to say that he never saw that much of Waddles afterwards, and never did get a clear picture of what went on that night. He and Paulie drifted apart and a few weeks after the carpet incident, Sal up and vanished. He was never spoken of again, save for the occasional crass joke in his "honor."

The leading theory Dad had was waddles was given up as a sacrificial lamb to appease the Petriello crew, who never did shut up about the missing Antiono. Such was life back then, you could lose yours casually at the drop of a hat. This was the par for the course things he dealt with, but in a hush voice he explained things got weird at times.

One time he was picking up two guys from a "heist." Now I say "heist" like that because really it was two Schmucks who got the bright idea to hold up a truck bound for the Natural history museum.  They figured they would stop it outside of town, stuff the Vega with loot and drive off into the sunset.

It was a late Friday afternoon, the two schmucks sulked in the back of the Vega, stockings masking their adrenaline spiked panic of what they were about to do. My father was bored with it, wasn't his first heist and really, he was just doing a favor for one of his regulars. Schmuck number one in the red tracksuit being the son of his regular.

The truck came over the horizon and dad jerked the Vega forward cutting it off. The Schmucks jumped outta the car, guns drawn and at the ready. He watched as Schmuck number Two held up the driver, a black bearded man who was more pot than belly, while Schmuck One went behind it.

It was taking a good while for him to come around the bend with the goods, and dad was forced to hike up his own ski mask and investigate. He came around back and saw John the schmuck standing there confused as all hell, crowbar in one hand and an empty sack in the other.

It turns out the two criminal masterminds failed to vet what would actually be on the truck. They heard history and thought old paintings and fabled jewels. The truck was filled to the brim with ancient Egyptian artifacts and larger than life stone statues of animals and pharos past. John was standing in front of an open shipping crate, the gold-plated death mask of an old king staring up at him with painted eyes. 

Dad told him to grab something and let's go-John reached into the crate and filled it with something. The ill-fated heisters made their getaway in the Vega, speeding off into the distance towards safe harbor. John sat in the back, rummaging through the sack. He had grabbed some animal headed pots and a statue of Bastet. Nothing no one in their circle really had any clue how to move. My dad's regular was embarrassed and the idiots laid low as they sat on their stolen goods.

The rest of this my dad overheard through various sources and hushed conversations.

John the Schmuck kept the Bastet statue, hung it over his mantle. That day forward, every night a cat would creep up to his window and stare at him. He began having vivid nightmares of the dead rising from the grave, wrapping him in gauze and dragging him to hell to face judgment.

John became jumpy and flakey, staying couped up in his room rather than risk his bizarre dreams becoming realty. He would see black cat, eyes yellow and hungry gaze upon him from his bedroom window. He chased it off at first, but it just kept coming back. His father had enough of his foolishness and ordered some guys up to his apartment to drag him outta the house and get some air.

When they arrived, they reportedly heard screaming and burst into his place, only to find the window open and a splash of blood near it. At first, they thought he had finally lost it and jumped up or slit his wrists or something. They went to the window and looked down to the alleyway, seeing nothing but a black cat licking its paw. The stolen statue was gone from the mantle, and much like John the Schmuck was never seen again.

I begged my father to tell me more, but he said that was enough for one night. He told me to catch him when he was in a better mood. Well, I just got back from the store with a bottle of his favorite *grappa*, so hopefully I can coax that better mood out of him and come back with more tales.
