A few days ago I had been sleeping and had an incredibly vivid, lucid dream. 

I was stuck in this alternate dimension, world or space I'm not really sure what to refer it as. The best I can describe it is that it was very similar to the ending of the movie vivarium if you've ever seen that. 

In this space I could crawl through mirrors, cabinets that let to large open spaces and I had been trapped there by an entity that would show itself to feed on my energy. Essentially this space was its domain for it to feed on energy on other people who were also sleeping. 

I was aware of where I was and most importantly that I was sleeping. I could not wake myself up, but I also knew I was sleeping and I also could not control what was happening. 

There were other people trapped here with me and in this place my only instinct was to find a way out or wake myself up. 

I remember exploring this place crawling through mirrors, small spaces like cabinets, doorways and other crawl spaces I could fit in. This domain even had an outside with sunlight where other people wandered. 

I can't really remember how long it felt like I was in this place for, but by the end of the dream I had a conversation with the entity and I think I may have messed up and made a deal with it that would enable me to wake up. The entity was of feminine figure and had long black hair with a demonic face. But it seemed kind. 

It explained to me that there were others and that they were not as kind as she was and that this space was specifically hers and it had spanned even a greater distance than I had explored. 

I remember her hugging me, draining my energy making the deal that I would provide her 10% of my overall energy when I die and something else I cannot remember. By the time that conversation ended I woke up. 

Did I mess up? Should I be concerned? From my understanding if I had not made this deal I would have been trapped asleep for the rest of my life until all my energy had been drained by this entity. 

I've been thinking about this for days and the thouhht of making a deal with ah unknown entity in my sleep terrifies me. If I did make this deal, what do I do? Am I able to sever it without consequences? Should I just move on as if it never happened? This experience was incredibly vivid and felt so so so real. 

Any advice/input/opinions are much appreciated. 

Also note I have incredibly weird and vivid dreaming experiences, but nothing like this one, I lucid dream pretty frequently and have a history of premonitions within my dreams and them coming true at a later time sometimes within 24-48 hours and sharing dreams with others which is why I'm seeking advice here. 

Thanks!
