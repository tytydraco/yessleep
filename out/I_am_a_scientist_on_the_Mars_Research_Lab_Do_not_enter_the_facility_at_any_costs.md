There is something about the red planet that seems to pull people in. Maybe it's beautiful red sandy plains that want us to explore its mysteries, and there is something about it's desolate and rocky landscape that makes us feel at home despite it being so far away. I am no exception. Growing up I was always fascinated by space exploration. I would often stare out the window as my parents drove me to school or head off to sleep listening to Neil Degrasse Tyson explain the cosmos. It wasn't until I started attending college, however, that I discovered that I wanted to become an astronaut myself. 

When NASA announced their new program to send people to Mars within the next decade, I knew I had to apply. I spent every spare minute studying for the application and working towards my dream. It wasn't long before I got a call back from them. I was in! I was going to Mars.

I can still remember the feeling of excitement and terror that swept over me when I got the letter. My hands were shaking as my parents watched me open it. I remember the feeling of that coarse reddish brown paper, almost like they sent me a bit of Mars. I was going to Mars. I was going to live on the Red Planet.

My name is Michael. I'm 34 years old and I've been assigned to the Mars Research Facility, also known as MARF. It's a large facility located on the eastern side of Mars, near the equator. The facility is part of a larger complex of modules that make up the Martian city complex. It's a dream setup planned by only the smartest of people.

NASA had sent all of the habitation modules months before I would arrive with the first set of colonists, mostly research personnel and military officers.  The equipment arrived and was installed without incident. I began training and preparing for my arrival. I was excited and nervous at the same time.

The MARF is located on eastern side of the US Martian City of Washington. The first city on Mars, aptly named after the first President. It is a sprawling metropolis of concrete and metal, most of it under the martian soil, but it was truly a sight to behold.

My first day on Mars was exciting. I was given a tour of the facility and shown around by my commander, Colonel Bragg. He was a tall, dark skinned man with a stern look in his eyes. He reminded me of my father. We talked about my training and he told me about the research projects being conducted. Some of the things he told me were truly extraordinary.

We stopped in front of a thick glass window that let me see into one of the labs. A man in a lab coat seemed to be playing with a bucket of red sand with a magnet.

"Is it...levitating?" I asked with a bit of excitement.

"Yes, that is levitating," Colonel Bragg said. "That man is a physicist named Dr. Christopher Smith. He is working on a new method of producing energy for the facility. It will require a lot of sand, however, so we'll need to build more labs like this one."

"I've never seen anything like it," I said with excitement that he didn't share.

"Well, it's not something you're going to see every day. You'll get used to it. Now, come along," Colonel Bragg said, leading me away from the lab.

He swiped a keycard and I followed him into a long brightly lit tunnel. The walls were painted white, giving the tunnel a cold feel.

"You will be living in module 12-B, on the west side of the facility. Your room is already furnished. Do you have any questions?"

I shook my head. "No, sir. I'm ready to go."

"Good. You are dismissed."

The next few days were a blur. I studied the Martial soil with the other scientists and it's properties were...fascinating. We dug into the dirt and tried to determine if it had any properties that would be useful for us.

We also tested the equipment in the labs. I was excited to test the soil, but my excitement soon turned to frustration. Nothing worked as planned. The machines broke down constantly, sometimes just by turning on. It was as though the machines were malfunctioning before they even started. Everything seemed to have somehow managed to get clogged with thick soil.

The strange magnetic properties also seemed to almost be a fluke. Not all samples triggered it and sometimes the same sample wouldn't work twice.

My dreams of the amazing Martian paradise seemed to have gone away. I found myself frustrated, angry, and tired. I was looking forward to getting off the planet, so I could go back to Earth and forget about this place.

It wasn't until one late Martian night that everything changed.

The scientists all decided to bring some drinks into the lab and work together. The research had gone nowhere and we were all ready to go home. I don't know what got into us, but we ended up drinking a lot. I drank too much and became quite intoxicated.

Dr. Stevens drunkenly walked to the soil samples and giggled something incoherently about spicing things up. 

I watched with mild amusement as she put some of that soil into her drink and chugged it while everyone cheered her on. It was disgusting and also a little bit funny.

Then she started to dance.

She began to twirl around the lab, shaking her butt at the glass windows. She looked like a stripper. I thought to myself that she was an idiot, but it was also kind of cute. Maybe it was just my drunken mind talking.

Soon, all the other scientists joined in. They were laughing and dancing. I laughed but my smile slowly faltered.

Her arms started twisting too much. The movements becoming more aggressive. There was something unnatural about it. The smile on her face vanished, replaced by a stony expression. She started dancing with more energy as if she were possessed.

The other scientists stopped dancing and stared at her.

"What's going on?" I asked.

We stepped back as she began a series of spins, each more violent than the one before. I watched in horror as blood began to pour from her arms. Her skin was turning red and black.

I don't know why but I felt the urge to cower under one of the lab tables.  A second later, she exploded, covering everyone in the circle in thick slimy blood.

I came out from the table and almost threw up at the sight of her mangled limbs. Some of them were still wriggling.

"Get out!" I yelled to the other scientists. "Get out! Get out now!"

But the others were too slow. Dr. Stevens lifeless leggs continued to spin, spewing blood everywhere. They finally fell to the ground and rolled in a disgusting, bloody and mangled mess.

"Oh my God," I said, trying to hide my disgust.

I started running towards the door when I realized no one was following me. The group seemed to be stuck in a state of shock.

Then the screaming started.

First a man in the back threw up bloody, disgusting goo. Then another one screamed as he tried to run away, but his legs gave out. He fell to the floor and writhed in pain.

"Run!" I yelled again, but the other scientists didn't seem to hear me. They continued to stare at the bloody mess that was once Dr. Stevens.

I didn't look back and I ran as fast as I could to the door. It was locked. I banged on the window but to no avail. There was no here at this time.

 "Michael," someone next to me whimpered.

I looked down to see the lab intern cowering under another desk. His eyes were bulging in fear.

"I don't want to die here."

I gulped and looked back at the mess of bodies in the back of the room. The scientists were started to make odd jagged movements, falling to the floor and getting back up, as if not knowing how to move anymore. I gagged as one of them moved their arm so hard it snapped right off the bone.

"I...we need to contact someone. Anyone, now," I barely managed to mutter.

Most of the scientists were still frozen in place. They stared at the corpses and made noises like they were trying to talk, but couldn't form words.

It intern huddled up in his lab coat and pulled out a cellphone.

His hands were shaking too much to dial any numbers. I could tell he was terrified.

I grabbed it out of his hand and dialed 911. On Earth, it would get emergency help. Here, it is just a hail Mary.

"Come on, we need to get away."

I pulled on his hand and dragged him to other end of the room, as far as I could get from them.

The bloody scientists had started moving now. Slowly, they crawled towards the door, dragging their broken limbs behind them.

"Oh my god," I whispered as they started beating on the metal with their bloodied hands.

A few of them started smashing their arms into the large window, covering it in red slime.

"I want to go home..." the intern kept whimpering under his breath. "I want to go home..."

The metal door suddenly made a sickening crunch as it gave away to the barrage of limbs. The creatures tore through the metal like it was paper.

The ones that still were in functioning order spilled out into the hallway, screeching in pain and dripping slimy blood everywhere.

"Michael?" I hear next to me.

"What...oh"

A small blot of blood on his leg was wriggling on his skin, slowly seeping into his leg.

He grabbed my arm, terrified.

"Get it off," he screamed.

I didn't know what to do. I was in shock.

The little blood blob had turned into a large, blood-covered worm. It wriggled on his skin, moving from his leg to his wrist and back again.

He suddenly lurched back so hard his spine snapped cleanly, his scream piercing through the air.

"No!" I yelled.

I grabbed his arm, trying to hold it together. But the worm had already spread over his body.

"Help me," he begged.

"I'm sorry," I whispered before running out of the room.

\*\*\*

It is now 2 days since the night it started. The gunfire stopped 5 hours ago. The screaming hasn't stopped. I am alone.

If anyone gets this message, do not come here. The infection has spread too far.

Please, end my agony. I can feel the infection climbing through my arm where he grabbed me. End it all.
