They say life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it. I try to live by these words whenever I can since worrying too much never helped anyone, and a positive attitude just makes your life better overall. That’s why I didn’t give up when my hometown’s economy went down the drain and most places started closing due to the lack of income, in turn causing their staff to seek fortune elsewhere. Wasn’t exactly what I imagined coming back from uni, but here we were.

What made the situation worse was the part of town I lived in felt the recession especially hard. Poverty and rising crime levels followed closely behind, as they tend to do. But my point is that pretty much every bad thing that happens can be a learning experience if you look at it a certain way. And man, does my work give me plenty of learning experiences.

To start, let me say this: I work in a nice place. Well, alright, it *can* be nice potentially if we put our mind to fixing things that are wrong with it. We’ve got a nice building layout and plenty of hardworking—at least sometimes—staff members who keep the diner running despite everything happening there, which is a lot sometimes. The diner might be old, the menus can look faded, and our sanitation may not correspond to all existing standards, but it still gave me a job and money to support my parents, so that’s the hand I was dealt.

I could post the diner’s name here if not for the ongoing legal procedures, which is a story for another time, but let’s just say it’s a notable place, at least due to all the odd things happening in and around it. If I’m being honest, I’m still not sure what exactly is wrong with my workplace and why certain things happen, but I’ve grown to accept that they just *are*. A part of reality like you or me, and, often, my responsibility.

I’m Ronald, by the way, but my staff calls me Ronnie. We call this informal communication. Decided to implement this idea after attending a business seminar in the neighboring town. The seminar was useless, by the way, several hundred dollars down the drain. But they sounded very convincing, probably because of the informal communication they used.

Anyway, I’ve finally found time to write down one of the notable experiences I had on the job and decided to share it. Maybe it’ll help somebody who’ll find themselves in a management position similar to mine, or even save some folks from making mistakes which they’ll live to regret.

**Mincedmater**

I named this story like that because it’s to the point and makes me hopeful that someone online recognizes that company's name, maybe even helps me understand what actually happened that day.

This was back in summer, shortly after I started working at the diner, and it turned out to be the first occasion that made me realize something weird was going on with this place. That day started as usual, with me pulling up to the diner’s parking lot in my old Ford and checking whether we were ready to accept new customers.

Meaning no trash on the floor, no lemonade-stained tablecloths, and no unidentified blue goo in the sinks (cleaning that off would sometimes delay us quite a bit). Everything was remarkably fine. I checked the main dining area, restrooms, staff-only spaces, and even the kids’ play area that we inherited from happier times. Then, I went to the kitchen to meet Chuck, who was already working, just as always.

Chuck is our cook, the best of his kind. He’s a short, middle-aged man with more hair in his mustache than on the top of his head. Always wears a Stetson while cooking, and while this headwear doesn’t technically fit the standards, it performs its function, so I let that slide. Partially because of how dedicated Chuck is to his job.

He always comes to work before me and leaves last. Come to think of it, I never saw him walk in or out of the establishment as if he simply lives there. But asking him that directly isn’t easy since I still don’t understand a word he says. It’s possible he’s Italian. But it’s not like Chuck needs words to communicate. This man has an amazing ability to relay any work-related information with just gestures and movements of his majestic moustache.

This time, the cook was clearly worried about something, and before I could even ask him about it, he handed me a stocktaking paper with one of the most important ingredients circled with a pen. I quickly understood what was the matter and let out a laugh. Here I was worrying about weird goo and paranormal activity, not even realizing we were running out of ground beef.

It turned out our last delivery didn’t show up. We still had enough meat for today, but if I didn’t figure something out until tomorrow morning, we’d be left without burgers, which took up almost half of our menu. I called our supplier, and it turned out they had some issue with their freezers and were probably going to file for bankruptcy due to blowing all of their deals. I asked whether there was a possibility I could get at least some meat for the next day, but the guy on the phone was too busy preparing for upcoming lawsuits to hear me out.

I had to find a new supplier now, but it’d take time and I doubt we could’ve gotten another delivery right away. However, before jumping to radical ideas like labeling the next day “hot dog Monday” or something to hide our inability to meet our customers’ needs, I decided to take a close look at the walk-in freezer, hoping to find at least something we could work with.

My scavenging hunt was a success, which took Chuck by surprise since he checked thoroughly. It took me some time, and I had to venture deeper than you usually would, trying my best to ignore the-thing-in-the-freezer (a story for another time) as I walked on the icy floor. Finally, I found several vacuum-sealed bags between a stack of old crates and a wall.

I thought they must’ve fallen over and Chuck simply didn’t notice them. Neither our cook nor I could tell for how long they’d been there, but it was clear they weren’t from our usual supplier. There was an inscription in dull brown that read “Mincedmater™” on each one. An odd name for a company if you ask me. The slogans written below it were even stranger:

“Chunks of purity.”

“The flesh of pleasure.”

“Certified 100% stomach-filler.”

A horror fan within me told me to throw that meat out right then and there. However, a businessman within me had an entirely different take. I mean, I wasn’t a stranger to bizarre branding, and as far as marketing ideas went, this wouldn’t make it into the top 10 of the weirdest ones. At least those creepy, cult-like phrases made their product seem memorable, which is exactly what you want as a brand. Either way, I told Chuck to thoroughly check on whether the meat was still edible and tell me about the result at the start of the next shift. Whatever that product was, we were going to find out very soon.

The next morning I went to the kitchen right away. Barely remembered to tell our janitor Margaret to clean up the blue goo before it started forming fibers and clogged up the entire drain. Chuck was in his usual place, with an opened Mincedmater bag nearby and a small hill of ground beef on the table before him.

He began actively throwing his hands around as soon as he saw me. His forehead was sweating, and his moustache looked like it wanted to jump away from his face. The man was clearly worried about something, so I walked up to him and took a close look at the beef.

Oddly enough, it looked completely fine. Appetizing, even. The smell was perfectly acceptable too, none of those sweet undertones like when the beef starts going bad. So I asked Chuck again what was wrong, and when he touched it with a knife, I understood everything right away. Because, you see, it moved.

I tried attributing it to liquid leaving the meat, or its mass expanding a little after being sealed in a tight bag, but then it moved again without Chuck touching it. One of its ends extended and seemed to latch onto the table. I rubbed my eyes, unsure of whether what I was seeing was real. Maybe a piece of the mass just fell over, and I mistook it for movement, infected by Chuck’s worrying.

But when I opened my eyes, that version was immediately thrown out of the window. The meat was slowly but surely trying to crawl away from the table, carrying its mass forward like a snail. Of course, Chuck stopped it before it could reach the edge, cutting it off with his chef’s knife and forcing it to back up. The thing stopped, and for a good reason. I suddenly remembered Gordon Ramsay's "It's so raw it's moving" and let out a giggle as the realizations of the situation's horror and comedy blended in my head.

The meat didn’t like Chuck's treatment at all. Well, I can’t be sure about that; I just made that assumption due to the sound it started to make. It began as a low-pitched growling but quickly turned to a buzz, as if a large beetle was stuck inside of it. Suddenly, there was a rustling behind my back.

Both Chuck and I turned around simultaneously and saw other portions of the “beef” buzzing as well. They quickly began turning and struggling, as if trying to break free from their vacuum-sealed prisons. I still don’t get whether it was a coincidence or they were actually communicating somehow through that noise.

I was about to tell Chuck that we should turn on the stove. Not to cook these things, mind you, but to burn them to a crisp. Of course, I’ve never seen locomotion listed as one of the signs that the meat had gone bad, but whatever was causing it, I doubted it’d be safe for consumption.

Then, I heard buzzing coming straight from my pocket and nearly threw my jacket away. Thankfully, it was just my phone. I quickly picked it up and tried telling whoever was calling that we had a bit of a kitchen malfunction and I didn’t have time. Before you ask, yes, they did teach me to frame problems like that in the management school. However, the conversation that followed wasn’t something any education could’ve prepared me for.

It went something like this:

ME: Hello-hello, Ronnie’s on the line. Please call later, we…

CALLER: (Chewing loudly right into the phone, saying something I still can’t decipher)

ME: Hello? Do you hear me? I can’t talk right now.

CALLER: (Still chewing) Eat it.

ME: What?

CALLER: Eat the meat. You’ve opened the bag, broken the seal. It is your right now. (Indecipherable due to loud munching).

ME: Could you please stop eating while talking to me?

CALLER: No. I can’t stop. The meat is too good, too pure, too beautiful. You won’t stop either. Nobody can.

ME: Wait, you’re from Mincedmater, right? How did you get my number? Actually, forget about that part. Why is your product alive?!

CALLER: Consume it and you’ll know. (Speaking with his mouth full again) Swallow it raw. Let your saliva envelop it whole. And thank it while eating. Say “thank you” loud and clear. Then you won’t stop, ever. Mater nostra exenteratus. Waiting for you, Ronald.

His teeth started chattering as if he was standing in the blizzard and I heard him putting another piece of meat into his mouth. We talked a bit more, but I quickly understood that whoever this psycho was, his ramblings wouldn’t give me any answers. I ended the call and blocked his number. He tried calling a couple more times from slightly different numbers, like spam callers do when they’re desperate to get you. Either way, our conversation was over, and I decided it was time to get rid of the meat.

Burning it sounded like a good idea, but Chuck pointed at the sanitation rules and refused to put it inside of our stove. He was right. Since we didn’t know what the hell it was, we couldn’t tell if it was even safe to touch. So we did the only thing we could think of and decided to burn it outside. If we'd manage to do it quickly, I’d even have enough time to change the menu for my newly patented hot dog Monday.

I tried manually putting the chunk back into the bag with gloves on, but it shrieked like a demon and, I swear, tried to bite me.

“Uh, thank you?” I said, but it only got louder.

Finally, Chuck was able to scare it with his knife and we were on our way. When Margaret saw us going to the backyard with a bunch of ground beef and a shovel to keep it at bay, she simply sighed. It was clear she regretted a lot of things in her previous sixty years of life that led her to this place.

Once we left the building, I had a weird sensation of being watched. Thankfully, it wasn't the meat developing eyes, but a couple of bums rummaging through the nearby dumpster. One of them saw the bags we carried and looked at them hungrily. I could see his mouth watering from here and decided to yell that the meat’s gone bad and eating it would certainly kill them. And to be fair, back then I didn’t know whether it was an exaggeration or an understatement.

So we put all of the bags into a ditch, and I ran back to get a gas canister. It was meant for our power generator that became a necessity after our district became too poor to afford stable electricity, but I figured this was more urgent. Before I even saw Chuck, I could hear him yelling something in a language I could only describe as Italian and the bums grunting in response.

When I came back, Chuck was visibly agitated and swung his shovel around while the bums were running away with one of the vacuum-sealed bags. Whether they thought I was lying about it killing them or decided it was worth it, we didn’t know, but they were surprisingly fast and disappeared before we could catch them.

Chuck shook his head, and I understood him. But there wasn’t much we could do now. The police stopped responding to calls from our street months ago, and even if they didn’t, I doubt they’d be interested in two homeless guys stealing a bag of rotten meat.

In the end, we cut our losses and let the rest of the beef, or whatever it was, burn under the sun. It was a bit similar to a BBQ, only lonely and horrific, with the main dish screaming in pain the entire time. We came back already weary from this ordeal, but the work hours have only just begun, so Chuck cleaned the kitchen and we started serving our dear customers.

It’d be the end of the story if I didn’t meet the same two bums a couple of days later at the same spot. Well, technically I met one of them. He was kneeling over the ditch we burned the meat in, digging with his bare hands and putting pieces of ash-covered dirt into his mouth like a wild animal.

His friend was nearby, lying in a pool of his own blood. He got shanked about twenty times, most of them in the neck, and now looked at his former buddy with a murky, unblinking gaze. The digging man paid him no mind and turned towards me as soon as our gazes met, his eyes bloodshot and nearly bulging out of their sockets. I tried backing away, but he lunged at me and began shaking me by the shoulders while a series of incoherent sounds poured out of his mouth.

I could make out phrases like “need to chew” and “give me more” through this cacophony. Then he opened his mouth and pointed inside of it, I suddenly realized why his speech was so incomprehensible. All of his teeth were shattered. It was like he pressed them against each other so hard they broke into tiny pieces. He still couldn’t stop doing the chewing motion and desperately moved his jaw while screaming at me.

My phone rang again, but I didn’t answer. Instead, I retreated back to my diner and ordered Margaret to barricade the back door. The bum kept scratching at it and yelling for more than an hour, up until one of our tougher neighbors got annoyed and knocked the guy out, likely destroying the rest of his jaw. When the night came, he disappeared, and I’ve never seen him again.

After that, things continued as normal… Well, normal by this diner’s standards, I suppose. I managed to find a new supplier a day later, making sure they were as trustworthy and clean as one could get to still make a deal with us. Should I even mention that I never found any info about Mincedmater online, or that nobody in the diner knew where these bags even came from?

I suppose the lesson of this story is never neglect choosing the right supplier and always check what you’re feeding to your customers beforehand. Failing to do so may result in food poisoning, a lawsuit, and you going out of business. That’s if you’re lucky. But if you’re working in a place like mine, the consequences may be far, far stranger.

Although, call me an idiot, but a part of me is still somewhat interested in how that meat would’ve tasted like. Especially when I have a shitty burger in some other diner and regret spending my money. The rational part of my brain tells me to stop wondering about it, especially since I still get pop-ups about blocked calls from time to time. After all, judging from what I saw, this haunted meat makes you crazy and ruins your teeth like no other food can. But sometimes I can’t help but wonder, what if it truly was *that* good?
