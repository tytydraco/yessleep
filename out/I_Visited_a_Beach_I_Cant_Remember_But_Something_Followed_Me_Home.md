I don’t know how I got there.

I don’t remember booking a flight, driving, or even hearing about the place before. But there I was, standing barefoot on sand as white as bone, speckled with shimmering gold dust that glowed under the burning sun. The ocean stretched out before me, an impossible shade of turquoise, almost artificial in its perfection. The waves were gentle, lapping against the shore in rhythmic sighs, but something about the sound was… off. It wasn’t soothing. It was hungry.

People were everywhere—laughing, drinking, dancing. A beach party was in full swing. Music played from unseen speakers, though I don’t remember any wires, any DJ, any source. Just sound, drifting in from nowhere.

I walked among them, but something gnawed at me. The air felt too thick, as if pressing in from all sides. The sun shone bright, yet there were no shadows—none at all. Not under the umbrellas, not beneath the palm trees, not even beneath the people.

I tried asking someone where we were. A woman in a red bikini turned to me, smiling too wide, teeth too straight.

“You made it,” she said.

That was all. Then she turned back to the water, stepping forward, her feet sinking too deep into the sand with each step.

I looked behind me, toward where the road should have been—where I should have arrived. There was nothing. Just more sand, stretching endlessly into a horizon that… wavered, like heat distortion, but wrong.

And then I saw something in the water.

It was deep beneath the surface, a shadow darker than the ocean floor. At first, I thought it was a reef, a patch of seaweed shifting with the current. But then it moved against the tide.

The music throbbed louder. The laughter around me rang sharper, forced, like an audience cue in a sitcom. I turned to the people nearby—none of them seemed to notice the thing below, the way it rose, slow and deliberate, just beneath the swimmers.

I tried to step back, but the sand held my feet. Not like regular sinking sand, but as if it had fingers, gripping my ankles, holding me in place. The golden specks swirled unnaturally, glistening like thousands of tiny, unblinking eyes.

Then the sky darkened—not from clouds, but as if something vast and unseen had passed overhead. A woman wading in the water let out a shriek, then disappeared beneath the surface without a splash.

The music continued. No one reacted. No one looked.

I turned, I ran.

I don’t remember how I left. I don’t remember a plane, a road, a hotel. But I’m home now. At least, I think I am.

And yet, the air in my apartment feels thick. The corners of my rooms are too dark, even with the lights on.

This morning, I found specks of gold dust on my bedsheets.

And just now, I heard something outside my window—a single, soft sigh, a sound like the ocean lapping at the shore.
