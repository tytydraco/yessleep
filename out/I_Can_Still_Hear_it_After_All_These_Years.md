I leaned back in my swivel chair, staring at the empty walls. They were covered with all sorts of company posters some HR hack decided to put up. I was almost glad I couldn’t make them out; this job was soul-sucking enough anyway. The outdated monitors in my office were monotonously buzzing away. I checked my watch, only a half an hour before 3 AM, when I could get off from work. I yawned and got out my phone. The deep bags under my eyes were evidence enough as to my need for an Uber. I had to start looking for an Uber soon in order to find the one driver who had enough unresolved medical issues to be up at this time. The phone screen was dim, and despite it being at max brightness, I couldn’t help but wonder what could be lurking in the darkness.

After about 15 minutes, I managed to find an available Uber. I got up from the beaten-up swivel chair and checked the cameras one last time. As soon as I exited the office, pitch-black darkness enveloped me. I got my torch out and flicked it on. Immediately the pitch-black darkness left. Something weird I noticed was that when the torch was on, thick strands of moonlight trickled in from windows where my torch wasn’t pointed at. The moon was extremely bright out tonight, and I should have seen the moonlight when I opened the door.

I continued on through the halls of cubicles. As much as I disliked my office, at least it was wider than me, unlike some of the cubicles. I stopped in my tracks when I heard a soft thump. It was quiet, and I almost didn’t hear it. I swung my flashlight to the cubicle I thought the noise came from, hand on my holstered gun. The cubicle was particularly dark. As I approached, I felt as though my flashlight barely illuminated it. I decided to unholster my gun, just in case. When I got to the cubicle, my torch’s dim light revealed that there was no one in the cubicle. I turned the desk lamp on so I could see what made the noise, but for some reason there was no lightbulb in it.

A bit spooked, I continued on towards the elevator. Wait, the elevator was open? Suddenly the lights in the elevator turned on and flash-banged me. I stumbled back. The elevator lights began flickering before eventually the elevator door closed. Something weird was going on. I checked the time, and it was Robert’s shift. Knowing him, he was probably blackout drunk 5 miles away. Relieved I wouldn’t get blamed. I ran to the glitchy elevator. and pressed the button. It quickly opened, and I stepped into the light. I began the slow descent; that was when the elevator music started.

Elevator music grinds my gears, especially when I realize it probably has reached more ears than any of my stuff ever could. I breathed a sigh of relief when the elevator music abruptly turned off. I tapped my toe and hummed a song I actually like. That was when the speaker turned on again. But it wasn’t your normal elevator music; it was the faint sound of someone whistling a cheery tune. I didn’t notice at first, but it began to get louder and louder. There must have been some sort of glitch with the sound system. I checked to see how long getting off this elevator would take and was surprised when I hadn’t even moved a single story. The whistling had risen to the volume of a banging drum kit that echoed with the rhythm of my beating heart.

Something weird was going on; I had to get off this elevator. I tried all of the buttons, but none of them worked; I eventually resorted to pressing the help button. That didn’t work either. My hands began to shake, and the whistling rose to the volume of someone screaming in your ear. Despite this rise, the whistling retained that cheery mood. I got out my phone and dialed the number of the guard who had the shift after me; he should’ve been here by now. When I got out my phone, the whistling stopped, and I have never felt so much relief as when that whistling stopped. Then, the lights turned on.

When the whistling had started, I knew it was coming from the sound system because it had the same echoey sound to it. But when the whistling started again, that quality was gone. Whoever was whistling was right outside the elevator. My relief vanished in an instant, and I reached for my torch. But when I turned it on, no light came out. Same thing with my phone screen. Slowly, the gap in the 2 parts of the elevator door began to widen. When I realized what was going on, I grabbed my gun and turned off my safety. The widening did not cease; eventually, it was as wide as my forearm. Then, the widening stopped.

My sweaty palms made it so I could barely hold my gun. My chest rose and fell with a speed I never knew was possible. My heart was threatening to burst. The door remained like that for what could have been moments, minutes, or hours. Shaking, waiting for the next horrible thing to happen. The whistling was still going, though I could barely hear it over my own breathing. I carefully got out my phone. I needed to dial 911. I could’ve sworn the whistling got louder as soon as I did that. The whistling didn’t matter, though; it didn’t change the lack of light that came from the phone that had been at 62% just a couple of minutes prior. It didn’t change the amount of time I spent crying, willing for this all to be a dream.

My torch didn’t work either, so there was no way to fend off the darkness that strangled me. I had all but tuned out the whistling, as if it was a minor annoyance. Which it was, especially considering what was going on with the elevator. You see, in the elevator, there is a screen that shows you what floor you are on. I hadn’t given it much thought considering it had turned off along with all the other lights until it flicked on. That was when the elevator started going up, up, up, up. The floor count went from 4 to 17 to 83 to 197 and on and on and on. The whistling never ceased, and the crack remained.

I tried my gun pretty early on the first day. It didn’t work. Around what I thought was day 4, I tried to climb out through the elevator panels. It didn’t work. Around what I thought was day 7, I tried to squeeze through the crack. It didn’t work. Around what I assumed was some time after year 1, I tried to shoot myself to stop it. It didn’t work. Around the time I had stopped keeping track, I tried to use my last remaining bullet to shoot the panels that would not open. It didn’t work. According to the police, I was only missing for 3 years, but I know it was so much more than that. I still hear the whistling when I’m alone, as if whatever did this is still watching, waiting for me return
