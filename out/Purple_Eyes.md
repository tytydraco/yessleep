I don’t know why I did it.

She was still there, I could feel her breath, touch her body, hear her heartbeat, smell her hair. Everything seemed normal but her eyes, those were not her eyes. They say animals have an instinct for survival because the ones that didn’t are all dead. I am alive so does that make me an animal for what I did? 

We are humans, we are not animals, I understand that but have you ever stopped to think about how we came to be as we are now, how we evolved. We started living in caves, hunting, and fighting for survival. We were animals, we just got better and better at killing and at organizing.The world was new to us, these groups did not know anything about physics, philosophy, the rotation of the earth they just wanted to see the next day and they would do anything in their hands to do it.

Everything started 2 weeks ago. I matched with this girl on Bumble “Brianda” … cheesy I know but I'm 36 years old, all my friends at the office are either married or way older than me and it's not that easy to meet someone in the streets nowadays. Fucking Internet and fucking Covid.

She was weird I have to be honest, she just moved in from Budapest, and was working as an assistant manager in a small startup company remotely. She didn’t use her real photos on the app because she didn’t want to have an internet trail, she had no facebook no instagram no social media just bumble and a netflix account. Normally on the weekends she stayed home and had basically no social life outside of a regular meeting with her friends every sunday by the old park in the city center, the one with the homeless people and the old civil war cannons on display. 

We had great conversations. She really knew the world, I was surprised I didn't think people from Hungary had this much knowledge. She had read so many books and knew so many facts about history I was surprised it was as if she actually lived through them. She could tell me exactly why and when the austro-hungarian empire was formed, stories about the Hungarian tribe known as the “Megyer” , the first people that ever lived in Hungary.

After weeks of messaging we decided to meet in real life. I invited her to a fine sushi restaurant, to the new public park, to the movies, to my favorite bar and she refused everytime. She wanted to meet me at my apartment, cook something and watch a movie. She explained that she didn’t feel comfortable in public places and that she had anxiety and social issues. I accepted… that was my first mistake.

She knocked at my door; the moment of truth. As I opened my apartment I was picturing in my mind all possibilities of what she might look like since I had never seen a photo of her. The door opened and there she was, she was beautiful, she had brunette hair, a pleasant smile, she was wearing a vintage gothic dress and her eyes. Her eyes were something else; they were dark blue, almost purple like. I had never seen something like that before. It was hypnotizing. I don’t know how to explain this but they were calming and they made me feel safe.

The date was going really well, she was shy at the beginning but I managed to make conversation topics and keep the date interesting. I cooked some pasta with chicken and we sat down on my dinner table. She brought her own wine. I opened it and poured us two drinks. She said she wouldn’t drink hers until after dinner because it made her feel bloated. I didn't think anything of it and drank by myself while we ate dinner… This was my second mistake.

After dinner we sat on my couch to watch her favorite movie “Blue Valentine”. At this point in the date I was feeling pretty confident everything was going well. I even reached out to put my hand around her shoulder, she flinched but after a second thought she relaxed and came closer to me. Fifteen minutes into the movie as I was seeing Ryan Gosling delivering goods from his truck I started to feel extremely tired. My neck started to feel heavy, even keeping my eyes open felt like a task. I felt weird and I didn’t want to freak Brianda out so I orbited my eyes from the screen to her to make sure if she was noticing anything strange.

She was still there, I could feel her breath, touch her body, hear her heartbeat, smell her hair. Everything seemed normal but her eyes, those were not her eyes. She was staring directly at me unfazed by anything else. I heard her swallowing saliva. Her eyes were completely purple, almost shining. I couldn't believe it, what the fuck was going on? Who was she? Why where her eyes like that? 

She smiled like a cat, a long cat-like smile, and started sliding her body towards the floor. My hand dropped to the couch, I couldn’t move. Brianda’s eye contact never stopped, when her body touched the floor she expanded her legs and arms in all four directions. She was really skinny so she looked almost like an arachnid. I could see red vessels appearing on her body, she kept stretching and stretching.  An insect, her skin started to crack. I could hear her bones slowly ripping apart, she was getting too long. She opened her mouth and an absurd amount of “saliva” started to come out drenching my floor. 

I noticed the stretchmarks on her now big eyes and my body completely froze. She was slowly crawling from the floor towards me on the sofa. I couldn't move, her breathing became heavier and heavier. My body was not in my control, my heart was about to come out of my chest and it was pounding like a church bell. Brianda started to crawl on top of me; her neck became longer and longer casting a shadow beneath me.

We are all animals and I was the prey, I do not know why or how I did it but my body moved by itself. My hands quickly grabbed her long neck and started to close like a wrench around it. Her face changed from an aggressive, even playful look to a surprised look. She started screaming but I was not listening anymore. My hands kept choking her and something took over me. I bit her, I started with her nose and ripped a big chunk of it from one bite. A torrent of blood started to fall on me but I didn’t let go. I kept gripping with pressure, her body was longer but the muscle’s became weaker because of it.

She started to scratch me. Her nails were like razor blades, small but effective. My shoulders, my back, even my face kept on receiving her claws but I didn’t let go. It must have been four or five minutes of back and forth, of receiving her cuts while I choked her. Then it happened she stopped moving and as soon as I blinked she was back to normal. She was no longer long , her body was the same except it was getting colder. She was missing a chunk of her nose and her neck had red, even black hand markings on it. I let go of my hands and she dropped dead on top of me. The only thing that was different was her eyes, her eyes were now purple and slowly losing their light.

I don’t know what happened, I don’t know if that was real, I don’t know why I did it but those eyes were not her eyes. It’s been three weeks since that happened, nobody has found her yet and I doubt they will. I was pretty efficient. I sometimes walk around the old park on Sundays scanning every person there, every group of woman I see. I am sure they don’t know about me but I know about them and I will find all the rest of them. 

Those eyes, those eyes must not hurt anyone else.
