I always walk to and from school. My family never had much money, so it was a way to save money, besides, we lived relatively close by, so it was manageable. When I walked back though, this kid, around 7 years old I wanna say, would always walk with me. I didn't really know him, we didn't talk much, but at the same time, it felt like we had some kind of connection.

One day, he didn't leave the school with me though. I thought the kid was just sick at the time, but the next day? Nothing. And then again. And again. It was like he'd disappeared off the face of the Earth. 3 weeks later though, he was back, but this time he was...different. He didn't talk when I spoke to him, his eyes almost glazed over, like a doll's, but most importantly, his route back home had changed entirely; in-fact, it changed daily.

One day, he went to my neighbor's house, the next, he wasn't even on my street. And the weirdest part? The people who lived in those houses claimed they hadn't even seen him before. One night, I couldn't sleep, so I decided to get a midnight snack instead of sleeping.

But when I got to the fridge, I noticed something in the corner of my eye. It was that same kid. That same boy I would always walk with. Still walking on the street, hours into the night. I watched him. He went into a house across the street first, then left, went to the school, and came back.

This time though, he was clearly coming to *my* house. I started panicking, he was standing in the front yard now, slowly walking up that small hill within it. I debated talking to my Mom and Dad about it, but I thought I'd definitely get grounded if they found out I was up this late.

Then, I heard the screen-door creak open. I started hyperventilating, running to hide behind an armchair as I listened to the boy clumsily and aggressively grabbing at and pulling on the door-handle. I shut my eyes as hard as I could, bracing myself and praying to God that me and my family would be okay.

And then it stopped. I looked to the door. It was shut, though the screen door had fallen off of its hinges and into the garden. My Mom said it was probably just some harsh wind, which is a valid assumption but considering what happened the night before, I doubt it.

I’ve been debating whether I should speak about this or not. I mean, who would believe me, y’know? I’ve seen a lot of similar stories here, so maybe you all can help me figure out what happened that night, no, what happened to that kid.

I still don't know what happened to that kid, but I’ve been searching around the internet, interviewing people whose homes he’s entered, I haven’t found anything yet, but please tell me if you know anything. If anyone's had something similar happen to them, please tell me what you know. Whether it's speculation or absolute fact.

I need to know.
