Cashmere Botanical is wearing its fall colors and The Lady was experiencing her first Fall in the Gardens.


The trees are all crowned with red and gold, the faces in the trees have begun taking on a ghoulish cast, and the grounds are filled with kids coming to see our Halloween Revelry. The town of Cashmere has a party going on Halloween night, and we have been piggybacking off of it for the last week of October. It’s been a whole week of candy, costumes, and lots of tricks and treats.


It all started about a week before October when The Lady came to me with a strange request.


“Do you know what this Hallowed Ween is? I have seen flyers for it and am not sure what is expected of us.”


She had come back from a council meeting, heard the other town heads talk about Halloween preparations, and had questions about what was expected of her.


I almost laughed, “My lady, have you never heard of Halloween?”


Looking at her now, she appeared closer to the crone I had first encountered. Her age made her no less beautiful, though. She looked like a woman who’d come fully into her beauty, a woman in the comfort of age, but when she glowered at me, I was afraid I had overreached. It was easy to forget that she was a force of nature when you looked into her angelic face, at least until some of that furry reemerged. 


“I know of the celebration. It is of the cold one, though, and I am not as knowledgeable about his holidays.”


The cold one, The Winter Lord, The Green Man.


This was one that I had heard of but knew very little about.


“I tell you what, my lady. If you will tell me a little of your enemy, an enemy I may have to one day fight, I will tell you all I know of Halloween.”


What followed was the longest walk I have ever been on, but it turned out to be very informative.


“The Green Man is the antithesis of my power. He brings the cold, he kills that which I create, but he withers in the heat. We wax and wane, grow and fades, and our battle is one that has lasted for ages. His minions are numerous, as numerous as mine, but they are crafty and they know I am at my weakest.”


Her gait was slow, her legs stiff as we walked, and it was as if I could watch her age the longer we stayed together.


“Why would you be at your weakest?” I asked.


“The cold is encroaching,” she said, her voice that of someone speaking to a child, “When the cold comes, the living world shrinks. The Green Man is at his most powerful when the cold winds howl and the seasons turn away from growing times. This Hallowed Even,”


“Halloween,” I corrected, but gently.


“Right, Halloween, it’s a time when he is strong. We should all be on our guard, for his minions will doubtlessly come to see this place I have made for myself.”


I started to ask her something else, but she put a hand up to stop me.


“I have fulfilled my word, now it is time for you to share your knowledge with me. Tell me of this Halloween.”


So I told her everything I knew. I told her about pumpkin carving, corn mazes, candy exchanges, Trick or Treating, Costume Contests, and everything in between. She wanted to know everything, every little detail, and the more she learned, the more she liked it. When she realized how much the growing of things was involved in the season, the last harvest before winter, she became enthralled. The more I told her, the more you could see working behind the scenes as she made plans. She would grow, she would build, and she would have a Halloween like no other.


Truly, she meant to make this a Halloween to remember in Cashmere.


She spent the next two weeks preparing. The Gardens were closed for “Event Settings” and I watched as she grew apple trees, corn fields from the rocky soil, and pumpkin patches from scratch. We Brandylou carved gourds, made cider, stuffed scarecrows, and generally set the mood for the coming event. The Pale Lady presided over it all, directing our efforts as she pulled me away from whatever I was doing to make sure it was all correct. I had become her consultant, it seemed, and she wanted my opinion on everything.


We were too busy to keep a proper watch then, but I’m sure they were already lurking around.


On October fifteenth we reopened and the lines reflected the curiosity of the community, a curiosity that was rewarded. 


They had watched the gardens for several weeks with mounting interest, and you could see their eyes grow big as they saw what we had created.


I’ve told you all about the rings before, right? They follow a pattern around the park like a clock, a clock with the security booth for a center. Each other the twelve rings usually holds a different exhibit, and when the gates opened that morning they each held a different Halloween display or activity. There was a whole area of carved pumpkins, complete with a booth for carving your own. Another held the trees with faces, though more had been added with the scary faces of witches and ghouls. Another was a corn maze that held costumed Brandylou who were ready to come jumping out to scare people. There were games with prizes, an apple-bobbing tub, a cider stall, hay rides on the old trailer pulled by the John Deer we had around back of the sheds, scarecrow contests, seasonal vegetables display with information about their growing cycles, and so much more. It amazed me sometimes to just walk through the park and see the transformation, and it was here that I saw the first one of the Winter Lord’s minions.


It was the third day when I ran into him, but they had surely been in the park since we re-opened. 


It began as a kid in an orange mask. 


He shouldn’t have stood out, there were lots of kids wandering around in costume, but he did. I was organizing traffic in the park, the crowds at an all-time high, when I saw the bobbing stem of a pumpkin head. I just saw the back of his head, but immediately I was fixated on the guy. I couldn’t have told you why, but for some reason, he gave me a shiver. I started making my way toward him, the crowd parting like molasses, but by the time I got anywhere close, he was already gone. I checked the cameras when I got back to the booth, but I couldn’t find a trace of the kid either.


It was like he had never been there, but it wouldn’t be the last time I saw him.


The next day, as I was giving directions to a couple of tourists who were looking for the cider tent, I saw him again. This time I got a good look, continuing to give half-hearted directions as I watched him from my peripherals. He was definitely a kid, maybe sixteen or seventeen, in ratty jeans and a black hoody. He wore motorcycle boots and fingerless gloves, and the mask he wore was grotesque. It looked like a jack-o-lantern with a long lolling tongue worked in plastic that hung across the cheek. The mask was bad, but the eyes were the worst part. The eyes were far too expressive to be made of plastic, and I could swear they blinked as I watched them. 


I had just finished showing the couple the ring they wanted on the map when he stepped back into the bushes and disappeared from sight.


I went to Carl, but he was as much help as he ever was.


“It’s just kids playing pranks, kid. Don’t let them get you down, and make sure they don’t ruin the exhibits.”


He did help me look, enlisting the help of a few others, but we never found the kid. It was like he had vanished, and Carl couldn’t find him on the camera, either. He found me, watching me poke the map as I showed the tourists to the ring they wanted, but the kid was nowhere to be seen. It was like I was haunted by this pumpkin-headed little brat, and I was beginning to suspect something was going on.


I kept my eyes peeled, but it was hard to maintain that level of vigilance. There was so much going on in the park these days, and I had to be on guard for other things too. Aside from the pumpkin heads, we had the usual level of shenanigans. Local kids playing pranks, clueless tourists trampling things, and the everpresent problems of having so many Brandylou housed so close together. Brandylou get restless when there are so many at hand and fights weren’t uncommon. The Lady's influence was strong here, something that stopped them from becoming deadly, but Carl and I were still up to our eyeballs in problems. Some of the older ones said this restlessness wasn’t uncommon during the waning months, and that this too would pass.


Pass or not, I was not looking forward to six months of grouchy goats and weird kids skulking about.


So when Friday rolled around and I saw the orange mask again, I fell in quietly behind him and followed. The people he passed seemed to like his mask no more than I did, and I watched more than one pull away in disgust. He was making a beeline for the fair section of the park, and people were giving him a wide berth. He had his back to me, but I could see the stem on the top of his mask bobbing as he swiveled his head right and left. If he was aware of me following him, he gave no indication, and when he turned for the corn maze, I was less than twenty feet behind.


I paused at the entrance, wondering if he meant to ambush me inside the maze? It would be the perfect place to jump me, but I wasn’t too worried about my ability to take care of a kid who was a head shorter than me. Even so, I gripped the handle of my nightstick as I headed into the lush halls of the corn corridor. There were supposed to be Brandylou in here, my own people who could offer some backup, but I saw that their hiding spots were empty. If I was lucky they were just on break, but if not then I hoped they were only wounded and not gone forever. I made my way through the gently waving stalks, the walls taller than me, and as I came closer and closer to the center, I felt sure what I would find there.


He still had his back to me, his hands linked behind his back, as he looked into the corner of the corn maze.


“Are you one of the Pale Bitches creatures?”


My hackles rose, his words lighting something deep within me, “You will speak of my Lady with respect. I am her servant, for now and always.”


He turned then, and up close the mask was even less pleasant. It seemed to bulge oddly, the orange skin speckled with blemishes and patches of rot. As he smiled, however, I came to doubt that it was a mask at all. The outside flexed like rubber, the muscles beneath moving oddly, but as he drug that tongue back into his mouth and showed an ear-to-ear grin of pointed fangs, I suddenly felt my earlier intuition about the eyes had been correct. Whatever this was, it had become his face and he was more monster than man now.


“Good, then I have a message from her better.”


He took a step towards me and it took everything I had not to flinch away.


Extending his hand, he had an envelope clutched between thumb and forefinger, the paper a delicate blue with the faintest speckling of red.


I reached for it, praying my hands wouldn’t shake, and when it came free of his fingers, he leaned in close to whisper into my ear.


His breath was as unpleasant as his face, and it felt hot and fetid on my cheak.


“She was foolish to open herself up like this. When she was on the move she was hard to pin down, but now we have The Lady and all her Brandylou in one place, and we mean to end her threat forever.”


My breath came out heavy, the fear palpable, but I swallowed it as I thought of my Lady, my Queen of Summer and Spring, destroyed by something as cheesy as a man in a Halloween mask.


“We shall see,” I said, putting the letter in my pocket, “My Lady has many allies, and she may prove harder to destroy than you believe.”


“May we meet on the battlefield then,” he said, walking past me, “Then we’ll see whose forces are the stronger.”


He walked out of the maze then, and though I caught sight of him often after that, I never spoke to him again.


The Pale Lady took the letter when I offered it to her, but she must have expected whatever it said because she sniffed and threw it away.


“A declaration of war,” she said, almost boredly, “just as he sends every year. We shall weather, as we always have.”


She may have been sure, but the Brandylou around her seemed less than convinced.


“We’ll rally our allies here and repel them, just as we always do. Send out the appropriate missives, I want them here before Halloween.”


The festive mood was done, it seemed, and we were a camp preparing for war now.
