I never thought an app could want me dead. Or, at least, that’s how it feels now, as I sit here, staring at the green glow of my phone screen, the same sickening shade that has haunted my nights for weeks. But let me back up. Let me tell you how all of this began.

My name is John, and for the better part of two years, Duolingo was my life. No, that’s not an exaggeration. I had a streak going—a monstrous 628 days. Nearly two years without missing a single lesson. At first, it was a hobby, something to fill the time on my morning train rides to the office, a quick daily challenge to keep my brain sharp. I chose German, mostly at random. I’d always liked the sound of it, the crisp consonants and logical structure. I had no real reason, no family in Germany, no trips planned. But once I started, I couldn’t stop.

It began as a ten-minute routine. Then it became fifteen, twenty, even thirty minutes. I’d find myself lying in bed, eyes heavy, but I’d push through “just one more lesson,” feeding that growing, green fire that told me I needed to keep going. The streak number climbed, and with it, my obsession. I knew every lesson by heart—the little gamified bits of vocabulary, the ridiculous sentences about purple cows and green elephants, the encouraging messages from Duo, the little owl mascot, who clapped its wings when I reached a new level.

Six hundred days of perfect progress. It became my identity, my achievement. Every morning, I’d wake up, make my coffee, and dive into my lessons. It was my routine, a ritual I wore like armour. I’d boast about it to friends, post my daily streak count on social media, and even considered buying a plane ticket to Berlin, just to see if my efforts had actually paid off.

Then Irina came into my life.

I met her at a work event—a conference I didn’t even want to go to. It was a cold, rainy Friday evening, and I’d almost bailed, preferring to stay home, wrapped in a blanket with a cup of tea, practising my German verbs. But something dragged me out that night. I suppose I should be grateful… and maybe a little terrified of how things turned out. Because Irina was everything I never knew I was looking for.

She wasn’t like anyone I’d met before. She had this wild, curly hair that framed her face in a way that seemed both unruly and perfect at the same time, dark eyes that glinted with some hidden joke, and this smile that… well, it could make you believe in magic. She was confident, quick-witted, and when she spoke, everyone listened. I remember the exact moment I first saw her, laughing at some joke a colleague had made, and how I felt this instant, inexplicable pull, like gravity was drawing me toward her.

We ended up talking for hours that night. It was easy—so easy, in fact, that I almost forgot myself. I told her about my German lessons, about my Duolingo obsession, expecting her to roll her eyes or politely nod. Instead, she grinned. “Deutsch?” she asked, raising an eyebrow. “Interessant! Why German?” I laughed, told her it was a long story. We spent the rest of the night lost in conversation, and for the first time in as long as I could remember, I forgot about my streak, about Duo, about everything that had consumed me for those 628 days.

From then on, Irina was my world. We spent every spare moment together—stolen afternoons in cafes, long walks through the city, endless conversations that lasted until dawn. She’d joke about my Duolingo devotion, teasing me every time my phone buzzed with a notification, but I didn’t care. For the first time, I felt like I was actually living. My German lessons began to feel trivial, a silly obsession from a past life.

And then, one night, it happened. The night I missed my lesson.

It wasn’t intentional. Irina and I had spent the evening at this little jazz bar she loved. We drank too much wine, talked too much, laughed too hard. When I finally got home, it was late, and I was exhausted in that blissful, contented way. I crawled into bed, and for the first time in 628 days, I didn’t open Duolingo. I didn’t even think about it.

The next morning, I woke up to a notification: “You’ve lost your streak, John!” The bright green of the app icon seemed almost accusatory, the message laced with a hint of disappointment. I felt a small pang of guilt. I’d lost something I’d worked so hard to build. But then Irina texted, asking if I wanted to meet for breakfast, and just like that, I forgot about it. I was moving on. I was happy.

But Duolingo wasn’t.

At first, the notifications were what you’d expect: “You’ve missed a day!” “Come back to keep learning!” They felt more insistent than usual, but I brushed it off. I figured the app was programmed to re-engage lapsed users. I swiped them away without a second thought, too focused on Irina, on the thrill of this new relationship, this new life that was unfolding before me.

But then, the messages changed. They became… personal. The first one caught me off guard. I was at lunch with Irina, my phone resting face up on the table, when it buzzed. A message flashed across the screen: “What does she have that we don’t?”

I felt a chill crawl up my spine. Irina noticed my expression and glanced at the phone. “Is everything okay?” she asked. I nodded, quickly locking the screen and slipping the phone into my pocket. “Yeah, just a weird message,” I mumbled. But my mind was racing. How could Duolingo know about my girlfriend? I shook it off, convinced it was just some odd coincidence.

The next few days were a blur. Irina and I were inseparable. We went on picnics, explored the city, stayed up late watching old movies. But every night, at exactly 2:00 AM, my phone would buzz. Always a message from an unknown number. “Don’t ignore us, John.” “You’re making a mistake.” “You need us more than you know.”

I blocked the numbers, one by one, but new ones kept coming. I’d wake up in the middle of the night, heart racing, my phone screen glowing in the dark, casting an eerie green light across the room. Irina started to notice. “You’re not sleeping well,” she said one morning, her voice soft with concern. I brushed it off, told her it was nothing. But the truth was, I was starting to feel… hunted.

Then, one day, as I was leaving for work, I found something on my doorstep. A small, green sticker, the exact shade of the Duolingo owl, stuck to the frame of my front door. It was a simple circle with the letter “D” in the centre, scrawled in the same bright green. I felt a shiver run down my spine. I peeled it off, crumpled it up, and tossed it in the bin, telling myself it was just a coincidence, some weird prank. But deep down, I felt a knot of dread forming in my stomach.

That night, Irina stayed over. We had dinner, watched a movie, and I finally started to feel normal again, like maybe I was just overreacting. We fell asleep tangled in each other’s arms. But at 2:00 AM, my phone buzzed again. I groaned, reaching for it, and froze when I saw the message: “Don’t forget who you belong to.”

My heart pounded in my chest. I felt a rush of cold fear, and I couldn’t stop my hands from shaking. Irina stirred beside me. “What is it?” she murmured sleepily, her head resting on my shoulder. I quickly locked the phone and set it down. “Nothing, just a wrong number,” I lied. I didn’t sleep the rest of the night.

The next day, I decided to delete the app. I opened Duolingo, stared at the green owl, its wide eyes staring back at me like it knew what I was about to do. I hesitated for a moment, then hit ‘Uninstall.’ The icon disappeared from my screen. I felt a rush of relief. It was over. Or so I thought.

The messages stopped for a while. I allowed myself to believe it was really done, that I’d managed to escape whatever weird glitch or AI gone rogue was happening. I went back to focusing on my life with Irina. I didn’t think about Duolingo. I didn’t let myself.

But then the dreams started.

Every night, the same dream. I was back in my old flat, the one I’d moved out of when I met Irina. The room was dark, except for a faint green glow coming from my phone on the bedside table. I’d pick it up, and there it was—the Duolingo owl, its eyes glowing, staring right through me. I’d swipe at the screen, trying to turn it off, but it wouldn’t go away. The tapping would start, soft at first, then louder, more insistent, like knuckles on glass. I’d wake up in a cold sweat, heart racing, convinced I could still hear it.

One night, I jolted awake to that same tapping sound, my heart hammering against my ribs. It wasn’t just in my dream this time. I lay there, listening, my breath shallow. The tapping continued, slow and deliberate, like someone was knocking just to let me know they were there, waiting. I glanced at Irina, asleep beside me, her curls spilling across the pillow. I didn’t want to wake her, didn’t want her to see me like this—nervous, paranoid.

Slowly, I slid out of bed and crept toward the window. The tapping was louder now, more insistent. I could feel the cold floorboards beneath my feet, could hear my breath coming in shallow bursts. I reached for the curtain, hesitated for just a moment, then pulled it back. My blood ran cold.

There it was. The figure in the green hoodie, standing in the alleyway outside, facing my window. The hood was pulled up, shadowing the face, but I knew. I knew it was staring at me. I blinked, and it was gone. I rubbed my eyes, my heart thundering in my chest, but the alley was empty again, just the faint glow of the streetlight flickering in the distance.

I stumbled back, nearly tripping over my own feet, my head spinning. I tried to tell myself it was just a trick of the light, a shadow cast by the streetlamp, but I knew better. I knew what I’d seen. I crawled back into bed, pulled the covers up to my chin, and lay there staring at the ceiling, my mind racing. I didn’t sleep for the rest of the night.

The next morning, I was a wreck. Irina noticed immediately. She reached out, brushing a strand of hair from my forehead. “You look like you haven’t slept,” she murmured, concern etching her features. I forced a smile, trying to mask the fear that had taken root deep inside me. “Just a bad dream,” I whispered, but my voice sounded hollow even to me.

Over the next few days, the tapping continued. Sometimes at the window, sometimes at the door. Always slow, always deliberate, as if whoever—or whatever—was out there wanted me to know they could come in anytime they wanted. I started keeping the curtains drawn, locking every door and window, even in the middle of the day. But it didn’t help. The feeling of being watched grew stronger, a cold, creeping sensation that slithered down my spine every time I turned a corner or glanced into a shadowed room.

I started seeing the figure everywhere. At the corner of my eye, just out of sight. A flash of green in the rear-view mirror as I drove home from work, a shadow passing by my window at night. I stopped going out after dark. Even when Irina invited me to her friend’s birthday party, I made excuses. I didn’t want to tell her. I didn’t want her to think I was crazy.

One afternoon, I decided to confront it. I had to know if I was losing my mind. I set up my phone in my living room, pointing it toward the window where I’d seen the figure. I hit record and left it there, going about my day. Hours passed. Nothing happened. I felt foolish, but a part of me hoped that maybe, just maybe, it was all in my head.

But when I played back the video later that night, my blood ran cold. At first, it was just static, the empty room, the faint hum of the city outside. Then, around the two-hour mark, the screen flickered. The lights in the room dimmed for a split second, and then… there it was. The figure in the green hoodie, standing right outside the window, staring in. The hood was still pulled up, masking its face, but I could feel the intensity of its gaze, like it was looking straight at me. I leaned closer to the screen, my heart pounding in my ears. The figure didn’t move, just stood there, still as a statue.

Then, slowly, it raised a hand and tapped on the glass. The same slow, deliberate tap I’d been hearing for days. It tapped three times, then paused, as if waiting for a response. My breath caught in my throat. And then, the figure leaned closer, pressing its face against the window. I could see its breath fogging up the glass, and for the first time, I saw its eyes—wide, dark, staring. They were too big, too round, like an owl’s eyes.

Like Duo’s eyes.

I dropped the phone, the screen going black as it hit the floor. I stumbled back, my legs weak beneath me. I could feel my heart racing, my breath coming in short, sharp gasps. I knew then that it wasn’t just a glitch, wasn’t just some weird bug or prank. It was real. And it was coming for me.

I didn’t sleep that night. I sat in the corner of the living room, a kitchen knife clutched in my hand, waiting, listening. The tapping came again, soft at first, then louder, more insistent. I squeezed my eyes shut, trying to block it out, trying to will it away. I stayed there until dawn, too terrified to move.

The next day, I tried to tell Irina. I wanted to explain everything, to tell her about the messages, the figure, the tapping. But how could I? How could I explain that I was being haunted by an app? She would think I was mad. So, I kept it to myself, buried it deep down, and tried to act normal. But I could see the worry in her eyes, the way she watched me when she thought I wasn’t looking. She knew something was wrong.

A week later, the notes started again. This time, they were different. More direct. “Come back, John.” “You know you miss us.” They were stuck everywhere—on my car, on my office door, even slipped under my front door in the middle of the night. I felt like I was losing my mind.

One night, I came home to find a package waiting for me on the doorstep. No name, no return address. Just a small, plain box, wrapped in brown paper. I hesitated, staring at it for what felt like hours before I picked it up. I brought it inside, set it on the table, and slowly unwrapped it. Inside was a green hoodie. The exact same green as the figure I’d been seeing.

I dropped it like it burned me, stumbling back. My phone buzzed in my pocket, and I nearly jumped out of my skin. I pulled it out, my hands shaking, and saw a new message from an unknown number: “Try it on, John.”

I felt a scream build in my throat, my heart hammering so loudly I thought it might burst. I grabbed the hoodie, threw it back in the box, and shoved it into the closet, slamming the door shut. I backed away, staring at the closet door like it might burst open at any moment.

My phone buzzed again. Another message: “You’re making a mistake.”

I grabbed my coat and left the flat, my breath coming in quick, shallow bursts. I needed to get away, to clear my head. I walked aimlessly through the city, trying to shake the feeling that I was being followed. Every time I glanced over my shoulder, I saw flashes of green—a hoodie, a sign, a pair of shoes. I felt like I was going mad.

And then I saw it. Across the street, standing under a flickering streetlamp. The figure. The green hoodie pulled tight around its face, its dark eyes fixed on me. I froze, my heart pounding in my chest. The figure lifted a hand, waved slowly, almost mockingly. I turned and ran, my footsteps echoing in the empty streets, the sound of my breath loud in my ears.

When I finally stopped, I was standing outside Irina's building. I felt a surge of relief, a momentary comfort. I buzzed her flat, and she let me in without a question. She must have heard the panic in my voice. I collapsed on her sofa, trembling, my mind racing. She made me tea, sat beside me, tried to calm me down. But how could I explain? How could I tell her what was happening without sounding insane?

That night, I stayed at her place. She held me until I finally fell asleep, my head resting on her shoulder. I felt safe for the first time in weeks.

But at 2:00 AM, my phone buzzed again. I picked it up, my hands trembling. Another message, from the same unknown number: “You can’t hide, John. We’re always watching.”

And then, I heard it—the slow, deliberate tapping on Irina's window.

I turned, my blood turning to ice. There it was again. The green hoodie. The figure, staring in, its face pressed against the glass. The tapping grew louder, more insistent. I felt my breath catch in my throat, a scream building inside me.

And then, the figure smiled.

I stared at the figure, its face still obscured by the shadows, but that smile… it stretched too wide, lips curling unnaturally at the corners. I could see its teeth, sharp and white, too perfect, almost like they’d been painted on. My stomach churned, a cold sweat breaking out across my skin.

Irina shifted beside me, sensing the tension in my body. "John" she whispered, her voice thick with sleep. "What’s wrong?"

The tapping continued, louder now, more frantic. I felt my heart hammering in my chest, my hands shaking as I pointed to the window. "Look," I managed to croak, my voice barely a whisper.

She turned, and for a moment, her face was calm, confused. But then, her eyes widened in horror, and she gasped, scrambling back against the headboard, pulling me with her. “What is that?” she stammered, her voice breaking.

The figure pressed harder against the glass, its breath fogging the window, and I could see those massive eyes, Duo’s eyes, staring back at us with an intensity that felt almost human. And then, without warning, it began to speak. Its voice was distorted, a mechanical, monotone chirp, like the app’s notifications. "Come back to us, John," it hissed, the smile growing even wider, stretching to an impossible length.

Irina was shaking now, her grip on my arm tight enough to hurt. “John… what is this?” she asked again, her voice thin, on the edge of breaking.

“I don’t know,” I whispered back, my throat dry, the words catching like thorns in my mouth. I could feel the weight of Duo’s gaze, the way it seemed to pierce right through me, as if it was reading every thought, every fear in my mind.

And then, with a sharp crack, the glass began to splinter. A thin web of cracks spread from where the figure’s fingers were pressed, each line crawling slowly, deliberately across the surface. Irina screamed, jumping to her feet, and I grabbed her hand, pulling her back, away from the window.

But the figure didn’t move. It just kept smiling, kept tapping, the sound growing louder, echoing in the room like a heartbeat. "Come back, John," it said again, its voice now a low, guttural growl, like static tearing through a speaker. "Come back, or she pays."

I felt something cold and sharp shoot through me—a surge of adrenaline, of terror. I knew, in that moment, that it wasn’t a threat. It was a promise.

The cracks spread further, the glass now shivering in its frame. Irina pulled me toward the door, her face pale, her eyes wide with terror. “We have to go,” she whispered urgently. “Now!”

But before we could move, the window shattered. Glass exploded inward, and the figure stepped through, moving with a strange, fluid grace. I saw it clearly now—its face, its eyes, too big, too dark, unblinking. It was wearing that green hoodie, the same shade as the app’s mascot, but its face… its face was a blur, a shifting, swirling mass that almost seemed to flicker like a glitch on a screen.

My breath caught in my throat. I felt a scream rising in my chest, but no sound came out. The figure took a step closer, its smile still stretched across its face, and I felt an icy hand close around my heart.

“Come back, John,” it whispered, now just inches away. “This is your last warning.”

And then, without thinking, I lunged for my phone. My hands shook so badly I could barely unlock it. Irina was screaming, backing away toward the door, but I couldn’t focus on her. I couldn’t focus on anything but the app, on Duo, on that green owl that was somehow now standing in front of me, more real than ever.

I found the app, trembling fingers hovering over the install button, and for a moment, I hesitated. What was I doing? How could this possibly make it stop? But then I looked up, saw the figure looming over me, those eyes—too wide, too deep, too empty. I couldn’t breathe. I hit the button. The screen flashed.

“Reinstalling…”

The figure paused, its head tilting slightly, almost curiously, as if waiting. The download bar moved slowly, painfully slowly. Irina was by the door now, tears streaming down her face, and I could feel my own panic rising, my fingers numb and cold as I gripped the phone.

And then, just as the bar reached the end, the figure leaned in, its breath hot against my ear. "Too late," it whispered.

The phone went black.

The lights flickered, then went out, plunging the room into darkness. I heard Irina scream again, felt a rush of cold air, and then… nothing. Just silence.

And then, a familiar sound filled the room—the cheerful chime of a notification.

I looked down at my phone. The screen was lit up again, glowing green, and there, in the centre of the screen, was Duo.

Its eyes seemed darker now, more menacing, the smile sharper, almost mocking.

"Welcome back, John," it read.

And then, below it, another message blinked into view: "Let’s keep learning."

I felt the cold, creeping sensation again, that slither of fear tightening around my chest. I glanced at Irina, her face pale in the green glow.

But before I could say anything, the phone buzzed again.

A new notification.

From another app.

“Hello, John,” it read.

I looked at the icon. Bright red, a little flame.

Tinder.

I stared at it, my heart pounding, a new kind of terror settling into my bones.

And then the tapping started again.
