 

It was a  Sunday afternoon when I got a phone call from my friend Marcus. He told me had found an abandoned house in the middle of the forest with satanic signs written all over it. He asked me if I wanted to check the place  out  , which I replied with the answer no. I was grounded for a week by parents after they found me watching hardcore porn , something they didn't take a liking too even though I knew my dad had a whole file of it hidden in one of his drawers.

Marcus kept on insisting till I eventually agreed to go with him,  he told me that we should meet up at the corner store at midnight.  My parents were going to  party they had been invited to so the  only people in the house was me and my brother who was two years older. My brother had his girlfriend comeover so he didn't mind if I sneaked out . When it was 11:45 I got out of my house and walked to  the corner store where I saw a group of teenagers with Marcus in the middle.  They were all wearing dark clothing so I could  barely see the number  of the people  there . When I got closer the number looked to be about 13 with Marcus included

When I arrived Marcus told me that we would be going with them , something I did not mind at all. He guided us off the gravel road of the street and into a pathway that lead into the forest.  The pathway was long and narrow . We had walked almost 30 minutes when we reached a passage. We had to bend down to crawl through due the fact the passage collapsed.  When we reached the other side we saw a small white house in the distance . Behind the house was a large satanic pentagram drawn on it. One of the guys in group pulled out a crowbar  and Started pulling the lock on the house.  After a few hits on the lock it eventually broke. We all flooded into the house to see what was inside. 

The floors were decorated with newspaper with blood splattered all over them , there was an idol placed in the middle of the room . The sight of the doll placed in the corner of room gave me creeps , it was one of barbie dolls but life size . No when I think about it could've been a sex doll. One of the boys in the group was freaking telling everyone he wants go back home. I found it funny he was freaking out till a large bang  throughout the forest.  I opened the door to see a man dressed in black with a gun   in his hand walking towards the house.  I told the group what was happening before I sprinted out the house  running as fast as I could  to the to pathway.  Behind me I could hear another gunshot being fired.  In the corner of my eye I could see Marcus catching up with me. 

We both rushed to the  pathway crawling through there as fast as possible.  . In my state of panic I jumped over the wall of my neighbors house to seek shelter. I stayed down and waited for  a while.  I was shaking violently  , anyone who saw  me could of that I was having a seizure. One more gun shot rang . I crawled up to gate and peeked to see the man walking back into the forest. At that moment I thanked God,  for  saving me. Marcus called me and told me to go back to the corner store so everyone could meet up. The time was 2 :56 everyone was trying to catch their breath from what happened.  

I wasn't feeling well , my body was about to collapse any moment from exhaustion.  Marcus accompanied me back to my house as I struggled to keep myself up. We did not talk about what had happened , but it was obvious we would all have to keep quiet on what happened.  I can't let my parents find out that I snuck out or they would kill me .

Loud music from my house could be heard from a mile away  , the ear screeching sound of metal shook the windows . I knocked on the door and to no suprise my brother answered the door flat out drunk. I said goodbye to Marcus and headed to my bedroom ignoring my brother as I went. I laid on my bed ever so tired only thinking about the pain that will haunt me tommorow. I laid in my bed recalling the events that  happened.  There was a knock on my door , I knew it was my brother.  He wasn't the most elegant person drunk so I just shut my eyes waiting for him to stop eventually falling a sleep after a while 

When I got out of bedroom to take a piss I saw a figure from the corner of eye in front the  house.  I opened my curtains to see the man from before standing with a shotgun in his  hands. I rushed to my brother's room to call for help. I heard a bang on the front door .As I was about to run into my brother's room I noticed him slumped by the toilet.  With all the strength I had I tried to get him to wake up but he just wouldn't.  My heart was pounding out of my chest as adrenaline pumped into my body  . I dragged him into the toilet with me and locked the door.  In my run to my brother I mistakenly left my phone in my room.  

There was a knock on the door and without another warning a short gun shell tore through the door blowing my shoulder awat.  Blood splattered everywhere,  I could see the masked  man clearly now. The only thing I could note that was that his mask was torn on the lower half with his jaw was crooked  with a grin that went from chick to chick . I grabbed onto my shoulder as I shook in mixture of terror and oain.  With its hand it opened the lock  . I could feel his lifeless eyes stare into my soul before he  reloaded the shotgun and shot me in the face.  I could see brains splatter all over the bathroom but I was still conscious 

I don't know how or if it was by the graces of the lord,  but I was still alive after a losing a chunk of my head. Unfortunately my brother wasn't so luck when he woke up a few seconds after I got shot . He was shot in the  neck  , decapitating him in the process.  I couldn't do anything but watch as it all unfolded. After a while I searching  people in the house,  the man left .  My brothers girlfriend probably left after another one of their arguments,  my brother wasn't the nicest of guys but he didn't deserve to die. I crawled to my father's desk and wrote as much I could write on what  happened.  I was getting tired , my eyelids were getting heavier before I could even keep them up. I laid on my parents bed closing my aways on what could be the last time on this earth. I could hear footsteps walk up to , I opened my eyes thinking it was my father,  maybe  I could give him a sort of closure I f he spoke to me  one last time but to my suprise it was the man . He lifted me by the waist and carried me into forest with him. We crossed the pathway back to the house.  He tied me and placed me in a coffin in the middle of the room.  It's been 3 days now and I don't what's gonna happen to me
