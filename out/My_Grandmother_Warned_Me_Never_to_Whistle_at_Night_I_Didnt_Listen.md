I wasn’t raised to believe in superstition. My mother was a nurse and my father a civil engineer, two very rational people who met in college, got married, and moved to a quiet, unassuming suburb in Virginia to raise a family.

But every summer, they'd send me to stay with my grandmother in rural Ghana.

She lived in a small, sun-baked village wrapped in dust and mystery. It was the kind of place that refused to die, as though the land itself wouldn’t let it. Time moved differently there. And so did logic.

Her name was Esi, but everyone called her Awo Maame. “Wednesday Mother.” A title passed down to the oldest woman in the village born on a Wednesday. And with it came responsibility. She knew things, things I wasn’t supposed to ask about.

She never let me go out past sundown.

Not just because it was dangerous. But because "The air changes at night,” she’d say. “The wind stops blowing. The trees listen. And if you whistle…they’ll know where you are.”

I was nine the first time she told me that.

I laughed.

She didn’t.

I’m twenty-nine now. And I haven’t whistled in twenty years.

Until last week.

And now I can’t sleep. I can’t breathe right. And I’m not sure who or what is in my apartment.

Let me explain.

A few months ago, my grandmother passed away in her sleep. Peacefully. No drama. My family barely mentioned it, she’d lived a long life, and in truth, we’d grown distant.

Still, I felt something. Not quite grief. Not sadness either. More like…unease. As if something had been buried with her that shouldn’t have stayed buried.

After the funeral, I went back to my city life. Fast-paced. Emotionally numb. I didn’t tell anyone about the recurring dreams I started having.

They always began the same.

I’d be back in her village. Not the way it looked in the real world, but strange twilight forever. Purple skies. No stars. Just the sound of wind moving through the trees that didn’t move.

In the dream, I’d be standing at the edge of the woods, barefoot, watching something shift between the branches. Not a person. Not an animal. Something that pretended to be both.

And every time I turned to run, I’d wake up with blood on my pillow from a nosebleed.

Last Thursday, I got drunk.

I don’t drink often, but I’d had a terrible week, and the loneliness in my apartment felt like it was pressing down on me. I put on an old Highlife record to feel close to my roots, lit a candle, and sat on my balcony overlooking the city.

And I whistled.

Just a tune from childhood. A lullaby, I think. I wasn’t even thinking. I was just…filled with some stupid nostalgia.

And then my phone buzzed.

It was a message from a number I didn’t recognize.

“Don’t do that. They remember.”

I froze.

The hairs on my arms stood up. I looked around the dark balcony, nobody was there. I stood up, walked back into my apartment, and locked the sliding door behind me. Tried to laugh it off.

Maybe a prank?

But then the dreams came back.

Worse this time.

Friday night, I dreamed I was back in her house. Everything was covered in dust. Her photo was missing from the wall. I heard the sound of whistling coming from outside.

Low. Rhythmic. Patient.

I looked out the window. Something stood just beyond the light of the porch bulb.

Not a man. Not a shadow. But a space where both could be.

It didn’t move like a living thing. It glitched, like bad video footage.

And then it turned its face toward me.

I say “face,” but it didn’t have one. Just a smooth surface. No eyes. No mouth.

But I felt it watching me.

It whispered without lips.

“You called us.”

I woke up screaming. Sweating. With a nosebleed so bad I stained my mattress.

Saturday, I tried to rationalize everything. Lack of sleep. Grief. Maybe even inherited psychosis? (Yes, I googled that. No shame.)

I went to a café, just to be around people. On the sidewalk, an old woman in a colorful wrapper brushed past me. She looked just like my grandmother.

I turned.

She was gone.

That night, I slept with the lights on.

Still, the dream came.

This time, I was in the forest again. And I wasn’t alone.

A girl was standing beside me. I recognized her.

Me.

Me at age nine. The version of me who laughed at my grandmother’s warnings.

She was whistling.

That same lullaby.

The thing in the forest stepped closer.

And then I felt it hands on my chest in the real world.

I couldn’t move.

Sleep paralysis? I’ve had it before, once or twice. But this was different.

The weight was too heavy. The room was too cold. The thing wasn’t on my chest.

It was in the room.

And then it said:

“Open the door.”

I didn’t.

I couldn’t.

I just closed my eyes and waited for morning.

It’s Sunday now. I haven’t slept. Not really.

There’s a sound in my hallway. Like someone dragging their feet. A soft knock at my front door came an hour ago.

But no one’s there.

And I swear to God…I heard whistling from inside the walls.

I tried deleting this post three times. Each time, it saved itself as a draft with the title: “You Called Us.”

I’m writing this because I need to warn someone. Anyone.

There are rules in this world we forgot when we stopped listening.

Old gods don’t die.

They wait.

And all it takes is a lullaby. A whistle. A memory.

So if your grandmother ever warned you not to do something…

Don’t.

I didn’t listen.

Now I think they’re already inside.
