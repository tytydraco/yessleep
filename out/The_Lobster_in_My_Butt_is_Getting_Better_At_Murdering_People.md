It began as a drunken dare, the sort of idiocy that only feels immortal at 2 a.m. with salt air and cheap tequila thick in your lungs. Five of us in that sagging Outer Banks rental, half-cut and hysterical, when Darren hauled up the lobster trap from the moonlit surf. The creature inside was obscene—two feet of armored muscle, shell mottled rust-red and black, claws thick as my wrist even with the rope binding them. Its stalked eyes tracked us with cold patience while we howled and took pictures.

Darren’s challenge was simple, slurred, inevitable: “Bet you won’t put it up your ass.”

I don’t remember saying yes. I remember the shock of its cold plates against my skin, the impossible girth, the slime from the sea gunk still on it, and the way my body yielded with a wet, yielding tear that sounded like fabric ripping underwater. I screamed, it was too big but it was in. Suddenly I felt its tiny appendages moving around trying to adjust to its new living area. There was a lobster inside me. Then the room spun, laughter became a distant roar, and everything went black.

I came to on the bathroom tile at dawn, alone. My friends were gone. The trap sat empty on the porch. My rectum felt packed with wet stone—heavy, distended, wrong—but there was no blood on the floor, no external wound. Just that leaden fullness low in my pelvis, pressing against my spine.

I convinced myself it was a sick prank. They’d roofied me, staged photos, left me to marinate in humiliation. I drove home in furious silence, ignoring the group chat blowing up with laughing emojis.

That night it moved.

A slow, deliberate shift deep in my bowel, like a fist turning over in sleep. Then a scrape—chitin on soft tissue, faint but unmistakable. I froze on the mattress, every muscle locked, feeling it probe the slick walls that now imprisoned it. Another shift, harder. Something jointed flexed, testing how much space it had. My sphincter fluttered involuntarily, trying to clench against an occupant far too large to expel.

I didn’t sleep again for days.

The first real pain came on the fourth night. A sudden, crushing pinch inside my rectum, as though the thing had decided to close one claw experimentally. The sensation was white-hot, precise, intimate. I screamed into my pillow, legs drawn up, feeling warm fluid trickle down my crack. When I staggered to the mirror and parted my cheeks, there was only a thin seam of blood and a swollen, purplish ring that refused to relax. The anus itself looked… stretched. Permanently. The skin shiny and thin, veins livid beneath it, as if something beneath was pushing outward, remodeling me from the inside.

Darren died the next morning.

I don’t remember leaving my apartment. I don’t remember the drive. But I must have blacked out again, because I remember standing in Darren’s living room, the metallic reek of blood so thick it coated my tongue. The door had been locked from the inside—cops confirmed it later—but somehow I was there, hands clean, clothes unmarked, staring at what was left of him.

Darren was on the floor in two main pieces, though it was hard to tell where one ended and the other began. His arms had been severed at the elbows with impossible precision: the bones weren’t just cut—they were pulverized first, reduced to splinters and paste as if caught in industrial shears, then twisted apart. The flesh around each stump was bruised black in perfect circular patterns, the diameter matching exactly the span of those bound claws I remembered from the beach. Blood had sprayed in arterial arcs across the ceiling, but there were also deeper, crushing wounds—ribs caved inward on the left side, sternum cracked like a crab shell under a rock. One claw had punched straight through his chest, compressed the heart until it burst inside the pericardium, then withdrawn, leaving a tunnel of macerated tissue.

I stood there for minutes—or hours—feeling the thing inside me shift luxuriously, a slow, rolling stretch that sent a warm pulse of satisfaction up my spine. It was feeding on the moment, savoring the echo of its own work. My vision tunneled, knees buckled, and everything went black again.

I came to in my car outside Darren’s building, sirens approaching in the distance. No memory of walking out. No fingerprints, no footprints—nothing to tie me to the scene. Just the creature’s quiet, sated thrum deep in my gut.

I stopped eating. I fasted for days, hoping starvation would kill it. Instead it grew restless. I could feel it feeding—not on food, but on me. My rectal lining sloughing away in sheets, absorbed. The heaviness increased; it was gaining mass. My abdomen began to distend slightly on the left side, a firm, unnatural bulge that moved when I pressed it. Inside, the clicking became constant, wetter now, accompanied by a soft sucking sound as it worried at the tender mucosa.

Sarah vanished three days later.

The blackout came while I was scrolling through her Instagram stories—sunset selfies, cocktails, captions about “healing vibes.” Then the screen blurred, my phone slipped from my fingers, and darkness swallowed me whole.

I surfaced behind the wheel again, parked outside her apartment complex at 3 a.m. The air was thick with summer heat and the distant crash of waves. Her car sat in the resident lot, driver’s door hanging open. I walked toward it like a sleepwalker, drawn by the creature’s insistent tug low in my bowels.

The driver’s seat was ruined. Two perfect circular impressions had been crushed straight through the leather and into the foam beneath—deep, symmetrical, the exact span of the lobster’s claws. The material had been pinched with such focused hydraulic force that the edges were fused, almost cauterized. But that wasn’t the worst of it. Sarah was folded into the back seat like discarded laundry, legs bent wrong, neck twisted 180 degrees. Her thighs bore matching crush marks—femoral arteries clamped shut first, blood pressure building until the vessels burst inside the muscle, blooming purple-black bruises the size of dinner plates. Then the claws had released, letting her bleed out in seconds. But not before practicing. There were smaller test pinches along her arms, her ribs—shallow at first, then deeper, as if calibrating pressure, learning how much force human tissue could take before it gave.

I could feel every detail echoed inside me: the creature replaying the kills through my nerves, a slow, grinding flex that made my sphincter spasm and leak. Pleasure—its pleasure—flooded my bloodstream again, warm and narcotic. My legs gave out. Blackness.

I woke at home, dawn light slicing through the blinds. No memory of the drive back. Sarah’s blood under my fingernails, though. Just a trace. I scrubbed until my skin was raw.

I started wearing diapers. Not for incontinence—for the seepage. A constant slow ooze of blood, mucus, and something thicker, darker, that smelled of low tide and iron. My anus no longer closed fully; it gaped, a raw, glistening O that wept in a steady trickle. When I tried to examine myself with a mirror, I saw the skin inside the ring had turned the same rust-red as the lobster’s shell. The tissue pulsed faintly, in rhythm with something deeper.

I felt the first molt on the tenth night.

It began as an itch, bone-deep, everywhere the creature touched. Then heat—feverish, localized—followed by a sensation of splitting. I curled on the bathroom floor, sobbing, as something inside me peeled away in long strips. The pain was beyond screaming; it was cellular. I felt the old shell crack along hidden seams, felt the new exoskeleton beneath it harden against my raw intestines. When the wave passed, the bulge in my abdomen was larger. Angular. My pelvis ached constantly, widened by millimeters every day, joints grinding as the thing forced me to accommodate its growth.

Mia was found in her tub two nights later.

The blackout hit while I was trying to eat a single slice of dry toast—my first food in days. The room tilted, nausea surged, and then nothing.

I came to standing over her bathtub, steam still rising from the water now turned scarlet. Mia floated face-down, skin pale as candle wax. The femoral arteries in both thighs had been severed with surgical neatness, but the edges weren’t clean cuts—they were crushed first, the vessels flattened and heat-sealed by pressure so intense it cooked the surrounding tissue. Blood had jetted in perfect twin arcs across the tiles before the heart gave out. Smaller practice wounds dotted her body: a crushed collarbone, ribs snapped like twigs, each break showing the same progression—initial testing squeeze, then full lethal torsion. The lobster was learning efficiency, artistry. It no longer needed to batter; it could reach inside clothing, inside flesh, and simply close.

Inside me, it stretched luxuriously again, swimmerets brushing my rectal walls in what felt almost like affection. A deep, rolling wave of alien satisfaction made my ruined anus clench and release rhythmically, leaking thick fluid down my thighs. The pleasure was stronger now, addictive. I sank to my knees on the wet tile. Blackout.

Home again. Clean. No evidence. Just the growing bulge, the constant clicking.

By then I could map its anatomy perfectly. I knew the exact curve of its tail pressed against my sigmoid colon, the way its swimmerets tickled the rectal walls when it shifted. I knew the reach of each claw—one angled upward toward my descending colon, the other curled down toward the exit it could not yet force. I knew because every movement was intimate, nerve to nerve. When it stretched, my spine arched involuntarily. When it clenched, I voided blood and shreds of my own lining in uncontrollable gushes.

Lucas came to my door on the fourteenth night carrying wire cutters, a bone saw, and the same brand of tequila. His voice shook.

“I read the old logs,” he said. “Deep-trench species. They don’t just eat flesh. They wear it. If one gets inside a host, it hollows him out slow, learns the nerves, the muscles. Then it steers.”

I didn’t let him in. Because I had begun to feel something new.

Pleasure.

Not mine. Its. A slow, rolling satisfaction every time another friend died. A warm throb deep in my gut when the news reported a fresh, impossible murder. The thing was rewarding itself—releasing something into my bloodstream that made my skin flush and my ruined anus pulse with alien contentment.

Last night the clicking stopped.

The heaviness shifted lower, settling directly behind my sphincter like a loaded spring. My abdomen is visibly lopsided now, the skin over the bulge thin and translucent, veins black beneath it. Beneath the surface I can see angular shadows moving—claws extending, testing the final barrier.

My anus no longer resembles anything human. It is a permanent, weeping crater ringed by hardened plates that flex when the creature breathes. The tissue inside has thickened into something cartilaginous, ridged, ready.

I am sitting on the toilet as I type this, legs trembling, feeling it gather itself for the last push. There is no pain anymore—only pressure, immense and building, and a terrible anticipation that is no longer entirely mine.

It has learned everything it needs.

It has widened me enough.

Tonight it will open me from the inside out, unfolding into the world wet and perfect and hungry.

And when it does, it will wear what’s left of me like a coat.

It is no longer just getting better at murdering people.

It is perfecting it.
