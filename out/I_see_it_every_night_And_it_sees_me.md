Sorry if this sounds really odd. I never post these things online. Hell I *never* post shit online but this has just blended my thinking and I don’t know what else to do. There’s only so many serious monster experts out on quora yknow?

Really need some more majors in that field, its 2022. You’d think the world would be more open-minded.

Anyways. Intros.

I wont give off my name, but I’m E. Sophomore at lsu, majoring in conservation biology. I like to draw, play guitar, skate, stuff like that.

That’s kind of what got me into this actually.

See I skate at night, when there’s no cars to worry about and no students to run into. Its peaceful, real serene when you’ve got that right playlist and can see your own breath in the cool night air. I love it.

**It**, loves it too.

It, by the way, isn’t that clown thing from the Kings books. God I fucking *wish* it was some kind of spider alien, something to make sense of but it’s not. I can’t even begin to properly describe it. Like, tall, thin? It’s always in my peripheral, but sometimes I feel like it’s right in front of me. It happened the first time, when I thought I was gonna run into it. My body froze, yet the board kept barreling down that street by the Union. I tensed, readying myself to hit… *something*. But it was like when you trip in a dream. Just air.

I thought maybe I drank too many energy drinks, that my brain was beginning to wack out with the 60mg adderall mixed with it. I thought maybe I should get back to my apartment when my eyes were still opened. I thought a lot of things.

Fuck I’ve never ran so hard in my life. 

I couldn’t tell my roommate about it, she’d laugh at me. Definitely couldn’t tell my parents about it either, that relationship was already hanging by a thread. My ‘friends’ would call my crazy or say I was hallucinating. I wished I was. I really do. When I woke up, I thought I was.

Yknow that saying? That if you can see it, it could see you too? 

Well I couldn’t see it.

But it could see me.

It’s been a few days of this back and forth bullshit of me feeling it watching, of me seeing it *just barely*. Im scared to be alone. Im scared to what it even is, because what if I’m just imagining all of this? What if this is just the tip of an iceberg of some psychological shit? I’ve got a therapist but the last thing I need is for her to think I’m losing my head.

So does anyone know what it can be? I know this isn’t much to go off of, and if I can, I’ll send more info. Fuck, I wish it could just jump out at me so it can end but then I don’t. I’m sorry, this is so jumbled up. Please, just tell me your theories. I need all the safe help I can get.
