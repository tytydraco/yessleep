  
I should’ve known better. I thought I was helping him. I thought that what I was doing would save his life.

Brandon had always been the kind of guy who carried his sadness like a second skin. He never really talked about it, but you could see it clearly in his eyes. They were glossy, like he was staring into an abyss that none of us could see. He used to be the life of the party, but life seemed to be draining away that part of him. 

We hung out one day, got dinner. That’s when he told me he didn’t see a point in anything anymore—that’s when I got desperate. That’s when I found her.

I don’t know how to explain how I met Elise. I can barely remember the details myself. I was walking home late, after our hangout, my head full of thoughts about Brandon. The streets were nearly empty, with just the occasional car humming by. That’s when I saw her, standing under a flickering street lamp. She wasn’t doing anything—just standing there, watching. 

Her presence made me stop in my tracks. She was beautiful, but not in a way I could easily describe. Her face was symmetrical, but almost too perfect, like an artist had drawn her. When she smiled, I felt an odd warmth, comforting but unnatural. 

She asked me why I looked so troubled, and for some reason, I told her everything. It didn’t feel like I was talking to a stranger, it felt like talking to someone I already knew. Like we had planned to hang out. She listened without interrupting, her gaze never leaving mine.

And then she said the words I will never forget: *Maybe I can help.*

She didn’t ask for more details. She didn’t need to. She just said she could help, and I believed her. I knew, at that moment, that she was something Brandon needed. Someone who could pull him back from the edge. 

I don’t know why I trusted her. Maybe it was the way she spoke, the way she made everything feel like it was going to be okay. I introduced them to each other the next day, and Brandon lit up when he saw her. It was like he had come back to life. 

For the first time in years, I saw him truly happy. He smiled more, laughed more. He told me he was in love, and I wanted nothing more than to believe it was real. 

But there was something about Elise. Something slightly off. I kept watching, waiting for a sign that she wasn’t who she claimed to be. But that sign never came. She was kind, affectionate, and always supportive. No vanishing in mirrors, no cryptic messages, no shadows where there shouldn’t be. But there was something wrong with Brandon. 

Brandon started losing time. When we would hang out, he would blink and suddenly not remember where we had been for the last hour. His texts to me became long paragraphs about the eternity of love. Elise became the subject of every conversation. We started talking less. Conversations became sparse, and eventually, we stopped talking altogether. 

A year passed, and then one day, Brandon called and told me they had broken up. His voice sounded broken, like he was trying to say something, but the words couldn’t come. When I asked what happened, he hesitated, like he was on the edge of telling me something important.

“I-I don’t know what happened. She’s not who I thought she was,” he began, his voice trembling. But before I could get him to say more, the call ended. I tried calling back, but he didn’t answer. The next time I heard from him, it was a text telling me he needed to be alone. 

He wouldn’t tell me why. In fact, he didn’t reply at all. The light that had come back to him had vanished overnight. He wasn’t answering my calls, and his boss let me know he had stopped coming into work.

 I went to his apartment, but he refused to let me in. When he finally did, I saw he was a wreck—sunken eyes, like he hadn’t slept in weeks. His place was trashed, papers scattered everywhere in writing I couldn’t understand. 

*She’s gone,* he said, and that's all he kept saying. 

I stayed with him for a while. I contemplated trying to find Elise, but something inside me told me not to. I tried to remind him he wasn’t alone, but nothing I did mattered. 

He killed himself a week later. 

I found him when I got back with groceries. Hanging from the ceiling, a look of horror on his face. 

That should have been the end of it. But then I started seeing her again. 

Not in person, but in the corners of my vision. Appearing in windows, standing out of reach. Always smiling. 

I don’t know what she is. I don’t know why she chose Brandon, why she loved him or why she left. But I do know this. 

She’s looking for someone new. 

And she’s looking at *me.*
