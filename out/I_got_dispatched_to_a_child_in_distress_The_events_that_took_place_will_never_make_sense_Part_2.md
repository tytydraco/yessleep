My flashlight jumped in my hand, scattering light across the concrete walls.

I ran for the stairs, taking them two at a time. I threw my shoulder into the door.
It didn’t move.

“Hey!” I shouted. “Open the door! Police!”

For a moment, there was only silence. Then a voice. Soft, just on the other side.

“No one was supposed to find out. I’m sorry.”

I pressed my ear against the wood. “Who is this? Open the damn door!”

“I can’t. It won’t let you leave now.”

“What won’t?” I yelled.

But the voice didn’t answer. Footsteps faded away.

I hit the door again, harder this time. Nothing. Just the echo of my own breathing.

Behind me came a faint sound a small whimper, echoing off the walls. I turned the light toward the cage.

The kid was still there, knees pulled to his chest, watching me.

“Hey buddy” I said, trying to sound steady. “It’s okay. I’m getting you out of here.”

He shook his head slowly. “He said no one should come down here.”

“Yeah, well” I said, lowering the flashlight “he’s not here now.”

The lock was old and rusted. I found a piece of pipe on the floor, wedged it through, and twisted until the latch snapped.
The door creaked open.

The boy didn’t move.

“It’s alright” I told him. “Come on, kid. We’re leaving.”

He hesitated, then crawled forward. When his hand brushed mine, it was ice cold. He looked up at me, eyes wide, face pale.

“Thank you” he whispered. “I’ll be good now.”

I swallowed hard, nodding once. “Stay close alright?”

We started for the stairs together. The light flickered again.
Halfway up, the boy stopped and looked back into the dark.

“He doesn’t like it when people try to take me.”

I froze. “What did you just say?”

The boy’s expression didn’t change. “He’s going to be mad.”

The flashlight dimmed again.

Somewhere below us, the sound of slow methodical footsteps.

The sound crawled up from the basement, each step landing heavy and deliberate. It wasn’t rushed. Whoever or whatever was down there wasn’t hiding.

I aimed the flashlight toward the dark. The footsteps stopped, leaving only silence and the hum of my radio still dying against my shoulder.

“Stay close” I muttered, keeping my voice low.

The kid followed without a word, bare feet brushing against the wooden steps. We reached the top. I threw my shoulder into the door again. This time it gave. Not because I forced it but because something let it.

The sudden give almost sent me forward. I caught myself on the frame, gun up, scanning the hallway beyond.

The air up here was cold. 

I stepped out, light sweeping across dust covered furniture and wallpaper peeling at the seams. Alright, I said under my breath. We’re getting out of here.

The hallway split. Kitchen to the right, living room to the left. I moved forward, clearing corners, each step careful and slow.

Behind me, the kid’s voice carried soft through the dark. 

“He doesn’t want you to see him yet.”

I stopped, glancing back. The kid stood in the doorway at the top of the stairs, his expression blank.

Stay right behind me, I said.

He nodded once.

I tried the radio again. 

Static.

I turned the volume down and kept moving.

The kitchen was empty. Old table, overturned chair, one window covered by a sheet nailed into the frame.

Something about the air felt thicker. Heavier.

I took one more step, then felt it.

A sharp, blinding pain in the back of my leg.

I stumbled forward, catching myself against the counter. The flashlight hit the floor, spinning wild light across the walls.

I looked down. Blood already soaking through my pants, dripping to the tile.

The kid was gone.

“Hey!” I shouted, voice cracking off the walls. “Where are you?”

No answer.

Then, somewhere deeper in the house, a laugh. High pitched. 

Not scared. Amused.

I pushed myself upright, gun drawn, flashlight shaking in my grip.

The laughter moved. First to my left, then behind me. It bounced off every wall, impossible to track.

I backed toward the hallway, leg throbbing, gun up.

A shadow darted across the doorway. Small, fast.

“Stop!” I shouted. “Don’t move!”

The laughter stopped instantly.

For a moment, the silence felt worse.

Then, from the dark ahead, that same small voice. Calm.

“You shouldn’t have opened it.”

I froze. The light flickered once more, then steadied.

The hallway was empty.

Only my blood on the floor, and the sound of something small scurrying just out of view.
