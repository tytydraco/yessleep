Ps. My cats name is snow. 

1. If they door is open don't go inside it is waiting inside. 


2. If the door is closed knock two time that's it anymore and it will be mad


3. I have a lot of toys and games but no human like dolls if you see on don't touch it and hope it not hungry, if it is hide and hope it doesn't find you :) 


4.I have some glass jars with only! toy inside if you see a human like thing inside one revert back to rule 4.1-4.2.


4.1. if it alone your ok just hide until it goes away. 


4.2.if there are more the one it too late.
 
 
5.you might see some things looking at you from around a corner if it's eyes are purple your ok if not run and don't look back. 


6.you might see a animal in the house I only have one pet it's a white cat but it is shy if it's not a white cats it's not mine pets so don't go near it. 


7. Sometimes it trys to lie to you if you hear 1 knock on the door it's not me, don't answer it . 


8. If you did if you see a tall figure standing next to a tree revert back to rule 4.1-4.2.


9. Don't hide under the bed they always look there first.


10. Always leave as soon I get home unless I ask you to stay. 


11. If you see eyes out side the window go hide they aren't animals or human. 


12. If you see eye, hear strange sounds, hear meowing- just end you life they are trying to live with you. Don't let them get too close or else you will be the one hand off the rules. 

13. None other them you are allowed inside the house, snow see them as a offering. So unless you feel like losing someone just stick to the food inside the fridge.don't worry only my cat eat from the fridge. 

14. You wanted to human dolls asked to play a game say, you know I can't play I'm human. If you say anything else.got to rule 15

15. snow hate the dolls and the dolls are scary of snow if your being chased try to find snow or hide. don't run out side then they can't kill you but they won't leave you alone until you come back and let the eat you. It the price for cheating. 

16. If snow is happy you will be ok to leave when I get home but if not it's best for you to end you life before snows "friend" does it's not human and loves snow dearly. But "friend is stuck in the shadows. 

17. If snows friend don't kill you I will. Heads up I'm not stuck inside the shadow like "friend".stay in the light want help you now I well be watching. 

Good luck and feed the cat or else it might eat you. :)
