When people think of the area 51 raid, they think of the memes. Naruto running, saving the aliens, the conspiracies, etc etc etc. But, that’s not what really happened. They, as in the government, did a good job of making it seem like it was all some big joke. Making whole youtube channels, podcasts, tv shows and developing them for years, for the sole purpose of releasing a single video/episode/session to talk about the “hoax” that was the area 51 raid. But the event was never a joke. People had genuinely intended to find something the government had been hiding from them, and I was one of them. I’m going to tell the story behind the area 51 raid in its purely raw state. Nothing added, nothing taken away.

The 17th of September, Lincoln County, Nevada USA.

Nineteen people. Nineteen people showed up to the location of the event. I didn’t care, I was excited and wanted to discover the secrets. The host of the event walked to the front of the small crowd.

“Alright, they can’t stop all of us, let’s go!” They’d said, turning towards the gate into a full sprint. The rest of us eagerly followed along. As we neared the gate, I’d quickly realized there was something wrong. The barrier gate was snapped off of its pole, there were no guards, either. The leader noticed this as well. This didn’t stop him though, it didn’t stop the other eighteen people either. But it should’ve. God I wish it did.

After the gate were two hangars and a metal platform. The group walked up to platform, as the host pressed a button, it began to drop downward. We looked at each other with excitement.

We were lowered into a small square room sealed off by a gate that opened with a button. One of the group members pressed a button, the gate began to rise. We were all surprised when a creature with long arms and legs awaited us on the other side, grabbing the group member and bringing it to its mouth. It brought their head up to its mouth, chomping down. Blood began to spew out everywhere. I watched in absolute horror as the group members corpse flopped onto the floor, lifeless.

Screaming was what came next. Lots of screaming. The platform would not go back up fast enough for us to escape. Temporarily escaping my fear, I took initiative, driving every home in my body to run to a nearby square area, pressing a red button to close the door. Four other group members slipped into the room before the door closed. The rest were locked out, killed by the entity. Or so I thought. But then again, I was thinking of a lot of things. Ideas raced through my brain in a near instant. I was terrified, at what they’d been keeping from us. At what those things were. What they’d do to us.

“Holy fuck! Shit shit shit shit!” One of the survivors began to scream. The creature aggressively banged on the door, the door began to cave inward. 

“We need to go.” One of them said, their tone all depressed like. And I didn’t blame them at all. We went through another door, traveling even deeper into the facility.

“What happened here? I have so many questions!” Another one of the group members said.

“They were running experiments. Really illegal ones. Some kind of power outage lead to their escape. But that doesn’t matter. I just want to go home.” The fifth survivor concurred.

We settled down in a room, exhausted from the chase we’d ensued in. I looked around at the group members, to see what was left of the raid party. A girl with brown hair, a guy with black hair, a blonde girl, and a guy who wore a cap on his head.

“We need a plan. To get out of here.” The guy with the black hair had said.

“I agree, but for the time being, we need to rest. We’re all too tired to be doing any plan making.” Id responded.

So we’d decided to sleep on the floor of that room that night. Safe from whatever lied within the facility. For now, what was.
