  
The early morning air was fresh as we stood on my front porch, wrapped in a tight hug that felt so warm and safe and comforting.  
  
He cupped my face in his hands, leaning down to deeply inhale, breathing in the scent of my freshly washed hair.  
  
I felt butterflies in my stomach, wondering how I had gotten so lucky?  
  
He seemed hesitant to leave, and I didn’t blame him. We had shared a beautiful night together. From the wine, to the slow and sensual lovemaking, everything had been just perfect.  
  
He had even arrived with a bouquet of red roses, something I’d told him I loved in one of our letters. I felt so happy he had remembered such a small detail.  
  
I waved him off as his car rumbled to life, wrapping my dressing gown tightly around myself as I suddenly fully felt the chill in the air.  
  
I was quiet when I let myself back into the house, making sure to close the door softly. I didn’t want to wake Anna. She was such a bitch at the best of times, and there would be hell to pay if my penpal boyfriend had woken her.  
  
I was irritated again thinking about how she talked about him. Like he was some random guy, some catfish even.   
Despite the fact we had only talked through letters, I knew Damon inside and out. She was just jealous, I was sure of that.  
  
I hadn’t heard a peep out of her all night,.not even when I dropped the glass of wine and shards of glass went shattering all over the tiles, I thought for sure she would come out complaining. 

  
But I guess she was embarrassed about how she had spoken about Damon, now he was here, now she could hear us having fun, laughter roaring, she probably felt too ashamed to show her face.  
  
I crawled into bed, happy as I’d ever been, a smile plastered on my face as I drifted off to sleep.  
  
The next morning, I woke up to cops at the door. They were notifying me about a body they’d found,.and wanted to ask me some questions.  
I felt numb. I couldn’t believe it. Everything had been going so perfect and now..  
  
I listened to the officers words as best I could, but everything was a blur. I heard things like body found with multiple Stab wounds, decapitated, head located but the scalp was missing. 

  
The officer handed me a letter, the most recent one I had sent to Damon, the one with my address on it. I broke down as I accepted the truth.  
The officer asked me if I could identify the body. Numbly, I agreed.  
  
My brain was a whirlwind of questions. Why Damon? What had happened in the few hours of him leaving my house? How could he have ended up dead.. murdered? I jumped at every noise. I felt eyes watching me.  
  
The morgue was cold, but when the mortician pulled back the sheet and I saw the body, I felt hot with nausea.  
The man staring, not seeing, with glassy red eyes is not Damon. 

&#x200B;

A towel covers the top of his head, presumably hiding the fact it was missing.

  
I feel awkward and sad, but also relieved. They had made a mistake.

  
The officer looks confused when I explain this to him, his frown growing with each word I say.  
He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a driver’s licence. 

  
Damon Hardenfield.

  
 The same name, the same address, as my penpal. 

  
But the man’s face was not the same as the man I had welcomed into my bed last night. 

Not the same as the man who had brought me the red roses, who had kissed me and held my head so lovingly in his hands.  
  
I shook my own head in confusion, telling the officers as much as I could muster. Someone called out for a sketch artist and a few minutes later I was starting at a drawing of the man who had pretended to be my penpal.  
  
I tell them as much as I know, which isn’t much. They put a call out with the make and model of the car, a description of the murderer they were looking for. I was sent home, promised to be kept up to date with everything. They said they’d send a cop car out every few hours, just to check on me. They were pretty sure this guy would be far gone by now, but better safe than sorry, they said.  
  
When I got home, I was met with silence. Last night’s dinner dishes sat unwashed on the table, fat solidifying on the pot, the smell of rubbish prominent.  
No doubt Anna was still punishing me, probably overhearing the conversation between myself and the police this morning. She wouldn’t let me hear the end of that, the fact I’d let an actual killer into our home, that I was sure of.  
  
I sighed and got to cleaning the kitchen. If Anna wanted to play it that way, that was fine. I made sure to be noisy as I scrubbed cutlery and rinsed plates, thinking to myself, stuff her.

  
If there was any time i needed a friend, it was now. But she was too selfish to bother to comfort me, I shouldn’t have expected any more.

  
After i had rage cleaned, I felt better, and I also felt quite guilty. I had put our lives in danger,.and I wanted to show Anna I didn’t think it was a joke, and that I was truly sorry.

  
 I made a pot of fresh tea and took it up stairs to Anna’s room. I knocked on the door, but she didn’t answer. I told her I was coming in, and opened the door, expecting her to roll her eyes at my peace token, but instead I dropped the tray with the mugs of tea I was holding, and screamed.  
  
Anna was sitting on her bed, her legs folded in a cross, as if she was about to start a yoga pose. In her lap was her book, the current novel she had been obsessing over. She hadn’t stopped talking about its arrival for weeks.

  
My mind drifted from the scene Infront of me, back to only hours earlier when I’d cleaned up the kitchen. I remembered seeing the plastic postal packaging, that days date written in marker on the top. I remember, because I was irritated at the fact Anna had lazily dumped the wrapping on top of a plate of our leftovers that were on the bench.

  
Anna had been alive, just before I had gotten home from the police station.   
  
Now though..Her head.. that was gone.

  
The wall behind her was sprayed red with wet and sticky blood and there was Just an empty space on her shoulders, where her head should have been.

  
Bitch was scrawled messily on the wall, written in the blood that seeped through the mattress and onto the carpet below.  
  
The cops tried to comfort me, but it was futile, they didn’t have a clue who this guy even was, let alone a way to stop him. 

  
I never told them that I kept waking up to red roses on doorstep. 

  
And, even though they looked high and low, they never did find Anna’s head.

  
\-

  
I don’t sleep much these days, I don’t do much, at all really. I’ve found comfort in being online, connecting with others who have been through scary experiences but have come out stranger.. I mean, stronger.

  
I moved back home, with my mum. At the start she felt sorry for me, but now I get the sense I’ve over stayed my welcome with no indication of moving anywhere else, she sees me as a burden.

  
I can tell she wants me to get a job, get a boyfriend (and not one I’ve met online – according to her!), just be a normal part of society, whatever that even means. She’s always saying it’s been months since the ‘thing’ happened and it was time to move on.

  
She doesn’t understand that I’m not like everyone else. She never has. 

  
To be honest, I’ve been really lonely, more so than I’ve ever felt, and it had been getting hard to deal with. 

  
Initially after my.. experience, the thought of ever writing another letter chilled me to my bone. I was scared, I was worried. I spent my time looking over my shoulder, afraid of everything.  
  
But.. well, things do change with time, and i did start to think it would be nice to have a penpal again, actually.

  
Every day I would check the mail box diligently, hoping to see a letter with my name on it. 

  
I wanted him to find me.

I wanted to wake up and find red roses on my mother’s doorstep again.

  
And eventually, he did.

  
His letters came, not with red roses or any other florists delight, but in the form of locks of hair,some still attached to the scalp. 

  
I savoured them all, each and every one, sleeping with them curled in my palm like a comfort blanket.

  
I gave the tufts of hair names and when I feel lonely, I talk to them, tickle them across my face so it feels as if they are hugging me. They are my friends.

  
I hope he comes soon. I can’t wait to see him. To feel him run his hands through my hair once again, to feel his loving hands cup and caress my face, to be in his warm, safe, embrace..
