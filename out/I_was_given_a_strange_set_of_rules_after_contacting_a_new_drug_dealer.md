it was 3:05 AM and I put down my cup of coffee and  picked up my phone while my leg shaked anxiously. i opened snapchat to see  “Delivered 2 days” on my main drug dealers  snapchat profile.  i look down and see the same thing under all of my backup drug dealers snapchat profiles.  “Fuck!” i shouted out loud,  knowing that my stash had run out a few hours ago. I was desperate, i couldn’t bear the thought of going through withdrawals. the whole situation was very odd. why did all of my drug dealers go silent 2 days ago? i put down my phone and was about to reach for another sip of my coffee when i heard my phone Ding 10 times in a row from notifications. i instantly picked up my phone and looked at the notifications. they were from all of my friends who knew that i used. each message said the same exact thing: 

“ yo if ur looking for some 🧊 💨  hit up my boy @pablosells3737 on snapchat 💯 “

“What the fuck?”i  said out loud to myself. 

i decided to look past the bizarreness and open snapchat. i typed the username and hit “add friend”. i was about to place my phone down when i  got a notification. “Pablo added you back! Say Hi” followed
 by another notification that read: “Pablo is typing…” followed by “Pablo sent a chat!” 

I clicked on the notification and the chat conservation opened up. i saw his message that read “Yo i have an ounce of crystal for you, i’m on my way right now. how does 40$ sound?” 


“What the fuck?   how is he on his way if he doesn’t know my address? and only 40$ for an entire ounce of crystal? is this guy out of his mind?” i thought. 

it seemed way to good to be true, and extremely sketchy at that. but my addict mind didn’t care about that. i didn’t care if this was sketchy or risky, all i cared about was getting my hands on the substance i loved but  also hated. “Alright, sounds good.” i responded. a notification popped up saying that my childhood best-friend who i occasionally talked to had sent me a chat.  i clicked on it to see  this strange message containing an interesting set of rules. 

“Hey man, i know it’s been a while. listen, i don’t have much time. i don’t have time to explain anything, i’m sorry, but this list of rules can possibly  help you make it through the transaction safely. 

1. you must treat him like a human. Pablo is not human, he’s also not alien. Pablo is beyond human comprehension, but you must treat him like a human. he doesn’t like it when you don’t. 

2.  Do not cancel the order. if you already responded to his first message, (which i know you did) , there is no turning back. if you cancel the order he will envelope your mind with horrors beyond your perception. 

3.   BE. ON. TIME. this is the most important rule. he will arrive at the park in your neighborhood at exactly 3:43:32 AM. it’s best  to arrive early, because if you are even a nano second late to arrive there, it’s over for you. 

4. Do not make eye contact with the person in the passenger seat of Pablo’s vehicle. 

5. you must Give him a vial of Human blood. it is his favorite pleasure. 

6. The Being in the back seat will try to start conversation with you. do not engage or give it any reaction. completely ignore it.  

7.  Make sure the money you hand him is folded in half. this is a very important rule, if you don’t do this, serious consequences will follow. 

8.  do not give pablo any type of thanks. simply take the substance. 

9. immediately turn around so your back is facing pablo. close your eyes and count to 30. during this time the being, the passenger,  and pablo  will simultaneously try to get any type of verbal sound out of you. Do not give in. stay completely silent for the 30 seconds. 

10. Walk home as fast as you can and never look behind you. once you make it in the front door you are safe. 

11. Block Pablo on snapchat, and block every single friend that reccomended Pablo to you. after this, you are done with the transaction. congratulations. “

“What the fuck did i just read?” i thought to myself.  I picked up my finger and began to type a message back to him. “right now is not the time for dumb jokes, why the hell would you send me this? did you set this whole thing up?”. I watched his bitmoji sit there for a few second, almost as if it was questioning what to say in to response to me.  

His bitmoji finally sat up and formed a text bubble on top of his head.  15 seconds later he sent a chat. “Man, please listen to me.. Just follow the rules. it’s better safe then sorry, right? all i can do is beg that you listen to the rules.. good luck man.” just after i completed reading his new message his bitmoji left the chat.   

i came to the conclusion that i would just follow the dumb list of rules, he was right. it was better safe then sorry.  I put down my phone and picked up my coffee. my eyes looked at the clock that read “3:32 AM” as i completed taking a sip of my coffee and sat it down on the table next to me.   I knew that I had to get going, the park was only a 5 minute walk from my house. 

3 minute walk if you’re an addict that’s desperate for his drug.  I rushed out the door and began speed walking eagerly and anxiously to the park. I opened my phone and pulled out the list of rules my friend had sent.  I arrived at the park and waited. after a few minutes, i looked at my phones digital clock and the time read:  3:43:32  AM.  Just as i read that, i heard the sound of a car pulling up. “Rule #1, simply treat him like a human. that’s simple enough” i thought as i walked to his car.   

“Hey, man.” i said nervously to Pablo. 
It was very dark and i could only see an outline of Pablo. to me he looked normal, but i couldn’t imagine what the dark was covering.  

He showed me the bag of crystal meth. I was about to pull out my money, but my eyes locked contact with the being in the passenger seat. 

I had broken  rule 4.

Fuck.
