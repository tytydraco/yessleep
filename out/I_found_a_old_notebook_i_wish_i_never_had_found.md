Hi my name is Jonathan. I'm 27 years old, and being a writer has always been my dream. Not just any type of writing, but horror. Ever since I was a kid I’ve been deeply fascinated by horror. The tightness in your stomach it gives you, and the suspense of if the girls are gonna escape the killer. Has always made my stomach churn.



I wasn’t able to complete a full book, so I ended up writing on reddit. Particularly r/nosleep. The perfect community for me to get my short horror out there, and be seen, but there's always a downside, and for me it’s that I can never get any traction with my stories. I write them and post them at the best hour to get seen, but nothing.



This all changed last month. I was deeply saddened by a story not doing well that had taken me months to write. I was thinking of giving up, especially because money was running really tight. I was shopping at an old thrift store. That I’ve never noticed before that day, and I decided to stop by, and see if there was anything good in there. I walked in there for about 15 minutes when I came across an old leather bound notebook that looked to be 30 to 40 years old. I look in it, and on the first page it says This one book will make you the best writer the world has ever seen, and under that was a cryptic message saying every upvote fuels the hunger. I ended up looking through it, and there were some really good horror stories in it. I took it up to the front counter, and an old lady looking to be in her 70’s said, “ Oh you found josh's old notebook.” I said who and she continued to tell me about her husband named josh who unfortunately died 20 years ago from dying in his sleep. She talked about how she never believed the doctors because her husband had been telling her the days prior to his death that it were coming after him. She said that she felt that it was cursed, and said I can just take it.

  


When I got home I uploaded the first page which was a terrifying horror story about a girl named Lorisa who had been in an experiment for a new drug. When I uploaded it I laid down, and fell asleep when I awoke. I found that it did better than any of my other stories I had ever uploaded prior to this. 



This trend kept up. I would go to the next page and upload a new story, and it would do incredibly well. I did start to have sleep paralysis for what was the first time in my life, each time I had it. There would be a creature standing in front of me. It was always constantly morphing into new beings, but one feature always remained the same: the creature never had any eyes, and in these dreams it would say the same thing every time. “My hunger grows,” it would always say in a deep raspy voice. 



It remained in my dreams up until 4 nights ago when I saw it out of the corner of my eye. Morphing into different beings. I saw it the next night and the next, but last night it said to me in my dream, “your time has come, time to come home.” After that I awoke in a sweat, and didn’t fall asleep at all. I had decided to turn to the back of the journal, and read what it had to say. It was one last horror story, but this one was different. This one was about me. I ended up slamming the journal closed, but in the process a paper fluttered out. I bent down to grab the paper, and on the paper it gave a detailed description of the creature's true purpose. It stated that it is a manifestation of the collective human subconscious, specifically the darkest desires and primal fears lurking beneath the surface.



I sit here now waiting for that creature to take me home, and I’m ready for it to. I see it out of the corner of my eye. It's beautiful. I see how it was truly meant to be seen. I finally see its eyes. It's beautiful. “I am god,” it says before i black out.
