The infant is dead. 

The thing is, I saw it on Christmas Eve alive and well. A little tuft of hair on its head. I was told of its demise 4 months ago, but no one seems to remember anything about a death in the family. No one told me that it got better. No one else seemed confused. But I am sure that it was dead. I remember my mom's tears when she told me that my newborn cousin didn't make it. I didn't really feel anything when I heard that, but I had only seen it once. I don't know how to explain it, but the baby was dead.

I just put it aside then, didn't want to talk of death during the holidays, but it kept gnawing at me. Was I going crazy? Did I just misremember? I was going to ask my Mother about it, but a small, irrational voice whispered in my thoughts before I opened my mouth. What if something is wrong? What if you were right? How could you know that asking won't shatter something? You were never meant to realize. You might wake up to hell. Or something will realize that you know.

That voice ranting essentially conspiracy theories, though absurd, shut me up. I walked away and did something else. What if it was right?

I have tried to talk to her multiple times about it, but I could never bring myself to actually ask her. I'm just being stupid. Irrational. Crazy, even. But that terrified little voice won't shut up when I think about it. If I don't at least write it down, I think I’ll explode. I don't think anything has noticed since I started writing this, so maybe it can only see through people? I don't know, I’m delusional.

My Mother just showed me a picture of my cousin. I don't know why, I don't really keep track of family. The kid looked too old. I guess it has been almost a year. Time flies way too fast, I guess.

I feel like I'm being watched when I leave my door open. Even if no one is there. I guess I have a monkey brain. I thought that I wrote my previous entry on the 12th. Strange. Anyways, my parents have started to act a little annoying. They will just stand in my doorway, staring at me. Not saying anything. If I ask them why, they mumble something and walk away. Sometimes my dad just sits on my bed and looks at my computer for a couple minutes. Am I really that much of a recluse? If they want to do something with me, they should just ask!

I reread some of my earlier entries, and I can't stop thinking about my cousin. I distinctly remember getting a box of sugary cereal that was supposed to be for the shower. I thought her name was Anna or something, but now the posts that Mother shows me say that it is Olivia. I wish she would stop showing me these stupid pictures of family members I barely know. Is something trying to see if I remember?

I was looking through my Aunt's Facebook account to see if I could find anything last night. I could have just been very tired (it was around 4), but I thought I saw something vaguely sad about a baby. I didn't get a good look because I realized my Mother was looking at me through the door that was cracked ever so slightly open. I think I heard her scamper off when I looked up. I checked again today and I couldn't find anything remotely like what I saw that was within the last 2 years. I guess I should go to bed earlier. Mom seemed normal as well.

Her name was definitely Anna. I remember baby shower invite on the refrigerator that always covered the ice dispenser. I think that I’m unraveling. Made for the Loony bin. I peered out my window, and I saw someone. Even I don't remember exactly what he looked like, but that guy looked like my uncle. Other side of the family. He had his hat. He died when I was 6. What am I saying,?!? It was probably just a random lookalike! I still can't question Mother. It will know.

Mother is here. I will ask her.

I have never known anyone named Anna. I have been unwell. Mother is a normal. Olivia suits her better. It.
