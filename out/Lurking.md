I don’t know what to do. I’m scared, alone, and tears are rolling down my face making it hard to see.

This is all my fault, it was me who said we should do this. I was wrong, we never should’ve done this. We never should’ve messed with this. Now look what’s happened.

See, yesterday morning school had been canceled due to possible storms. So I texted my 2 friends, Nessie and Rayan. I said we should meet up at my house, try to figure out something to do. And so that’s what we did. 

They came to my house around 12:00AM and we sit across my bed wondering what to do. 

The idea popped in my head after I scrolled across this video on YouTube. It was of these girls,  playing hide hiding seek in creepy abandoned places.

Now, there weren’t any abandoned places near where we live. However, there was a creepy graveyard. So what did I do? I suggested it to my friends. 

“Hey guys, what if we played hide and seek but like in a graveyard,” I sat up, showing them my phone, the video of the girls playing hide and seek playing on it. “We can do it tonight to make it even more creepier.”  

They were down with it, no objections. 

And so hours later, 10 at night we got ready to go.

And of course I had an even stupider idea. Flashlights, not the flashlight on our phones but a normal flashlight. We would take them instead of our phones. To make it feel more real, like we were in a movie. Again, no one disagreed. Although I could see on their faces they didn’t fully like the idea of not having their phone on them. Looking back, I don’t blame them. Maybe if we had them, we could’ve called for someone. Someone to help us, to save us from this. 

We agreed at the graveyard 30 minutes later, and we got ready. Nessie would count to 60 while me and Rayan hid. 

Everything was fine the first few rounds, nothing happened. That was until the 5th round. It was my turn to count. So, that’s what I did.

“58…59…60!” I count, “Ready or not..” I see a hand poking out behind a tree a couple of yards ahead of me. “Here I come!”

I laugh, why would Nessie and Rayan hide so close to me, and doesn’t she know her hand was sticking out. Just as I was a few feet from the tree the hand jerked itself back behind the tree. I figure she heard me coming, or me laughing. 

“I got yo-“ huh? I look behind the tree and see nothing. No one. “What the hell?” I say, because there’s no way she could have managed to get away from behind the tree without me seeing her. 


Ok. That was odd. So either one of two things just happened, my mind was playing tricks on me and I never actually saw a hand sticking out, or she somehow managed to go from one tree to another without me seeing or hearing her.

I walk around a few other trees looking behind them, I don’t see anyone. So I circle back around, looking behind the graves instead. 

I found Nessie behind a big grave, I saw her hair sticking out slightly. She helps me look for Rayan. 

We look for a few minutes before we decide to give.

“Okay, Rayan, you win. You can come out now!” 

Nothing happens. I don’t hear anyone move. So once again, I say “You can come out now! You win!” 

But again, nothing happens. “Um, Liz?” I hear Nessie say, that’s me. I’m Lizzie, my friends call me Liz. 

“Rayan come out!” I scream louder, maybe she didn’t hear me before. But she doesn’t. 

“Are you fucking serious right now? Does she really have to do this,” I’m aggravated, Rayan is the funny one. The one who is always pulling jokes and stuff so I figured that was what she was doing. But it wasn’t funny to try to scare us like this. 

“Liz what if she just went too far and can’t hear us?” 

“I don’t know but-“ my eyes widen. Behind the tree, the same tree as before, I see a hand poking out. I knew it, she’s pranking us. 

I grab Nessies arm and point at it.

We both start walking towards it, but again, just as we get a few feet away the hand jerks itself back behind the tree. 

“Rayan you little-“ I stop. Dead in my tracts. 

Because behind the tree is a girl. Not rayan.

She’s got her knees pulled up to her chest and her arms around her knees. She has long messy black hair. I don’t say anything, I was shocked to see someone else here this late at night. 

The girl slowly looks up. And when I tell you I screamed, you best believe i mean it. 

Her eyes were as wide as a basketball, and her mouth was open wide in a smile. That wasn’t why I screamed though. 

I screamed because she threw something at me. Not just anything. A finger. A finger I recognized all too well. 

Rayan.

Rayan always wore a pink ring on her left hand. The same ring the finger had on.

I saw Nessie looking at it with wide eyes. 

The girl jumped up, fast. Too fast.

I ran. I could hear someone else running to.

I don’t know if it was Nessie or the girl chasing me. All I know is I ran. 

“Gah!” I scream as I trip over something and land right on my face. “What the hell?” I landed in something wet. I shine my flashlight at it. Red. All I saw was red.

I slowly move my flashlight to shine it at whatever I tripped on. 

I scream. 

Rayan. 

Dead, lifeless, Rayan.


I get up almost slipping in the blood and just as I was about to run I hear a scream. A painful scream. Nessie. What do I do? Do I keep running or go back for her?

I make a choice. I wouldn’t leave her behind to end up like Rayan.

I run towards where the scream sounded like it came from, I stop a bit later to catch my breath.

My chest is beating like it never has before.

“Lizzie help me please..” I hear Nessie.

“Where are you!” I scream 

“I’m over here Lizzie!”

I run towards her voice, stopping too late. 

I realize, Nessie, throughout the 7 years we’ve known eachother, has never called me Lizzie. Always Liz.

I see Nessie. Behind the tree. On all fours, just lurking. 

“Over here Lizzie…” I see its mouth move, but not like a normal persons. It just opens and closes. Like it was biting something. I say it, because I know deep inside me that isn’t Nessie. Nor is it human.

Not with those too sharp teeth and eyes that are so wide they look like they will explode.

 I stare. Too afraid to run or move.

It slowly comes out behind the tree. Walking on all fours.

It slow morphs, Nessies skin falling off of it.

It stands on two feet now ripping the rest of Nessies skin off of it.

It grows, taller and taller till it’s looking down at me.

I find the courage to turn around and run.

I run until I can’t, my lungs burn and my feet hurt.

I duck down behind a grave.

I know it won’t be long before it finds me.

So here I am, writing this in the dirt with a stick.

Hopefully someone finds this and tells my story. 

I hear the low growling noise behind the grave I’m hiding behind, and I know it won’t be long.
