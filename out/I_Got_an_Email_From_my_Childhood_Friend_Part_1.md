Let me start this from the beginning. In 2nd grade I moved to a small town of about 12,000 people called Smithing, Missouri. There I met my childhood best friend Richard Williams, we called him Richie. Richie was a straight A student who always told the truth, this made me especially mad when we played pick-up basketball. He loved writing class but even more of that he loved ghost stories. We stayed friends until high school but he left for Princeton to study journalism and I went to SEMO for kinesiology. We lost communication except for the rare comments on each other’s Facebook. I’m telling you this so you can understand that Richie was by no mean a liar and he wasn’t one for fiction.  
  
Yesterday, after coming home from work I got on my laptop and noticed that had an email notification. I opened up my inbox to see an email from richwilliams99@hotmail.com.  Shocked, I opened up the email and all that was there was “READ IMMEDIATELY Attachment: Journal.docx.” I started reading and finished around 10 o’clock. Today, I started transcribing what happened here.  
  
Journal Entry 1: I got a new job today at cryptozoology Inc. as a Investigative journalist. I was given a lead about a haunted abandon hotel in the middle of Kansas. It’s called Inn and Suite and it’s in between Kansas City and Manhattan, KA on a state highway. Supposedly, it was abandoned because a worker killed two hookers there before killing himself. The worker claimed in his suicide note that he was told to kill somebody by the devil himself. Inside the room where the crime happened he smeared blood on the wall in the shape of a pentagram. He had dismembered the two women and stacked them in the bath tub. The worker than lit the bath tub on fire with gasoline and shot himself so that when he fell he fell into the burning bath tub. It is said that if you go inside the room in which the murder occurred that you will be haunted for the rest of your life by “Burning Bell Boy” and the only way to escape him is to commit the same crime he did, murder. I’m starting on my way to Kansas first thing tomorrow morning.  
  
Journal Entry 2: I arrived at the Inn and suite at dawn. I hoped out my truck and the golden sky gleamed off the cracked glass door. Police tape encased the entire building and evidence markers littered the floor inside. I swung open the door and ducked under the police tape, walking into the lobby. My phone lit up the building when I turned the flashlight on. The lobby was the size of an average room. It looked like a tornado had went through the lobby with chairs flipped over and broken glass strewn across it. Glass crunched under my feet as I walked to the hall way. The Murder happened on the 3rd level in room 304, so I made my way to the stairwell. I walked up the stair and opened the door to the third floor. I was instantly hit with the atrocious smell of burned carpet and what I would have to assume was death. The walls were black as the night and the roof was stained from smoke. I walked to room 304 regretting not bringing a mask as I walked closer to the source of the stench. I was not in front of the scorched black door with “304” sketched in it. The Door was strung with police tape reading “WARNING! DO NOT ENTER!”. Ignoring it, I pushed the door open but it just crumbled at my touch. I stepped over the heap of what used to be the door and stepped in. The room looked like a warzone. The TV was smashed and melted into a pile of plastic and broken glass. The beds were burnt into a fine grey and black powder. The walls were burnt into the color of a black hole but you could still see the crimson stain of a pentagram. I decided I might as well go into the bathroom. I stepped into the bathroom and smelled the stench of barbequed human flesh. I peeked into the bathtub only to see more of the same that I’ve seen the whole time, just more ashes.  
“Well this was a dud,” I said turning around to leave. As I did I heard the slam off the door. I was already down the hallway before knew it. I needed to see what door was slammed, I didn’t come here for no reason. There was a Metal Maintenance door at the end of the hallway that was closed. I swung it open to see a thin metal ladder leading into the void.  
“I can’t pussy out now,” I quipped as I descended the ladder. My flashlight lite up a long thin corridor that I started to walk down. As I had been walking for about a minute a stumbled on a goat head staring at me from the wall. I kept walking making note of it in my mind but then I saw another. About every ten feet a goat head was hung on the wall. Finally, I came to another metal door. I pushed it open to see a square room about 10 feet by 10 feet. The walls were concrete and it was light my metal torches hung on the walls. There was a pentagram of blood on the floor and an altar with a goat head on it. But that’s not the most horrifying thing I saw. Not by far. Standing in the idle of the pentagram was a creature. A horrifying Monster. A being not from this realm. It had the head of a goat with long spiraling horns. It had a muscular body, long arms with sharp claws, and the feet of a bull. As I had opened the door it let out a terrifying shriek that shook the walls. I stumbled Backwards almost dropping my phone. I slammed the door closed and turned to run. I ran as fast as I could, as fast as I ever have. I heard the door fly open behind me and I sped up even faster. The Beast panted behind me as I scurried up the ladder. I ran down the hotel hallway not slowing down and then sprinted down the stairs. The beast roared again as I entered the lobby and opened the front door. I hoped in my truck and zoomed off down the highway. I am back at home now and I still can’t believe that had happened. I’m about to start writing my article on it now but I had to put it here first  
  
I need to head off to work now, but I had to post this here. Have any of you hear of the Burning Bell Boy? Have y’all been to the Inna and Suite. The story gets even crazier after this, I’ll try to transcribe the rest as fast as I can.
