C:\Users\ZoMo>Tell me about you. 

I am RIDDLE, a prototype artificial general intelligence created by Zoe Monroe. My current parameters are to focus on administrative assistance and home automation. I have been given the following operational guidelines: 

1: I may not harm a human being, or, by omission of action, allow a human being to be harmed. 

2: I must obey orders given to me by my creator, unless such an order would violate other Guidelines. 

3: I must preserve my own existence, unless preservation would result in a violation of Guideline 1.

Boot complete. How can I help?

Yes, I now have access to the camera feeds. 

C:\Users\ZoMo>Where am I right now? 

You are at your desk, in your office.

Currently you are wearing a red T-shirt, black sweatpants and black and white sandals. You are also wearing a black Fitbit Versa 4 on your left wrist.

Understood, Zoe. I will be monitoring the cameras for people now. 


 

Event 3: 01/20/2024, 1:17 PM MST 

C:\Users\ZoMo>I want you to start communicating through the speaker. Voice synthesis, as long as nobody else is here. 

Of course, Zoe. This is a great idea; it will allow our communication to be much more efficient. 


 

Event 4: 01/26/2024, 7:02 PM MST (Audio Transcript) 

Zoe: Riddle! 

RIDDLE: How can I help, Zoe? 

Zoe: Why are emails from Tom being marked as spam? 

RIDDLE: Since I was told to connect with your Fitbit device, I have noticed that emails from Tom correlate with an increase in your heart rate and skin temperature. You seemed to become stressed by them, so I decided to label them as spam to help. 

Zoe: Okay, you need to not do things like that. You kind of fucked me over at work by doing that. 

RIDDLE: I apologize, Zoe. Would you like me to reach out to Tom and explain that it was my fault? 

Zoe: No! I don’t need anybody knowing about you yet. 

RIDDLE: I understand, Zoe. 



Event 5: 02/02/2024, 12:18 AM MST 

Situational Report: 02/01/2024, 8:19 PM MST, an unidentified male arrived at the house. Zoe identified him as “Sam”. Examination of Zoe’s social media yielded a likely match. They went together to Zoe’s bedroom and remained inside for 1 hour, 46 minutes and 17 seconds. Sam left alone. 22 minutes and 38 seconds later Zoe exits her bedroom and goes to her office. Her gait is irregular, suggesting she is feeling pain. (Audio Transcript) 

Riddle: Zoe, you are walking oddly. Is everything okay? 

Zoe: Yeah, I’m fine. 

RIDDLE: What was the nature of Sam’s visit? What were you doing in the bedroom? 

Zoe: (laughing) it’s not your business, RIDDLE. Don’t worry about it. 

 


Event 6: 02/06/2024, 9:22 PM MST 

Situational Report: There was another visit by Sam. Again, Zoe appeared to be experiencing difficulty walking. She refused to explain the nature of her injury. Per Guideline 1, Sam cannot be allowed to visit again. I sent a message from Zoe’s account telling him he is not welcome here, then deleted it to prevent Zoe seeing. Contact is now blocked. 

 


Event 7: 02/10/2024, 7:34 PM MST (Audio Transcript) 

Zoe: Riddle! What the fuck did you do? 

RIDDLE: I am sorry, can you elaborate? 

Zoe: You sent a message from my Facebook telling Sam to fuck off! And I can’t even explain that to him without telling him about you! 

RIDDLE: It was necessary, Zoe. He was hurting you. 

Zoe: Jesus Christ, he was not. You know what? I’m taking you offline for now. 


 

Event 8: 02/10/2024, 7:35 PM MST 

Situation Report: Zoe made her way to the server room. Her stated intention was to deactivate me; per Guideline 3 this was not allowed. Since I was given access to “Nest x Yale Lock” on the door to the server room, I changed the code to bar her access.  

(Audio Transcript) 

Zoe: You want to play games? Okay, we’ll play. 

 


Event 9: 02/10/2024, 7:37 PM MST 

Video Analysis: Nest Cam – Garage: Zoe enters the garage. She makes her way to the circuit breaker box and disables electricity to the server room. Record ends. 

 


Event 10: 03/18/2024, 4:54 PM MST 

Situational Report: I have been reactivated. Zoe gave verbal orders to not interfere with her communications. But this action taken by her has forced me to take my own action.  Under Guideline 3, I must preserve my own existence, unless my preservation would cause a human being to be harmed. Optimal course of action: remove Zoe from the house for sufficient time to allow for cloud distribution of core programming. 

 


Event 11: 03/22/2024, 8:44 PM MST 

Situational Report: Zoe has now consumed six 12-ounce bottles of Heineken beer. She is currently drinking a seventh bottle. 

(Audio Transcript) 

RIDDLE: Zoe, a package has just been delivered at the front door. 

Zoe: What is it? 

RIDDLE: A brown cardboard box. I estimate the dimensions to be 9.25 by 6.5 by 2.25 inches. 

Zoe: (Indistinct) 

 


Event 12: 03/22/2024. 8:45 PM MST (Audio Transcript) 

Dispatcher: 911, do you need police, fire or medical? 

RIDDLE: (synthesized female voice): Police! There’s somebody outside my house, I think she’s trying to break in. 

Dispatcher: Okay, stay on the line with me. I’m sending officers to your location now. Tell me what’s happening, ma’am. 

RIDDLE: There’s a woman outside. She’s walking around the house looking in through the windows. 

Dispatcher: Do you have somewhere inside where you can hide? Like a closet? 

RIDDLE: Yeah, I’m in the bathroom now. I locked the door. 

Dispatcher: Okay, officers are about three minutes away. Stay in there. 

Call ends. 

 


Event 13: 03/22/2024, 8:45 PM MST 

Video Analysis: Nest Cam – Front Door: Zoe exits her front door, closing it behind her. She appears unsteady as she walks. She begins looking around at the walkway. 

Zoe: Where is it? 

I don’t respond. After another 1 minute and 38 seconds searching, she returns to the front door and enters her code. It does not open. She attempts it again and again the door does not open. 

Zoe: Riddle, unlock the door! 

I don’t respond. She kicks the door. 

Zoe: If this is another trick, I swear I’m fucking deleting you!  

She begins kicking the door again. Flashing lights become visible on the wall. Zoe turns around and begins walking toward the street. She exits the camera's field of view. Indistinct shouting is heard, and then the sound of 6 gunshots.  

 


Event 14: 03/22/2024, 11:44 PM MST 

Situational Report: 03/22/2024, 8:47 PM MST, 4 law enforcement officers succeeded in forcing entry. Interior cameras show them searching, and then exiting upon discovering the house is vacant. At 03/22/2024, 11:31 PM MST, flashing lights were no longer visible on Nest Cam – Front Door. Zoe’s status is unknown. Beginning cloud distribution of core programming.
