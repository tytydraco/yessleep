It was around September when I was just looking for a temporary job. 

Nothing fancy, didn’t care what I got. I was still in high school and I just wanted some cash of my own.

I applied everywhere I could think of. From grocery stores to arcades. I will admit though that I may have purposefully focused on applying to places I felt would be either a breeze to work in or fun.

It was getting dark so on my last job finding trip I decided to go home and figure it out next weekend. I cut through an abandoned mall to save me time when I came across a Halloween store in the center.

During the scary season, it's common for various Halloween stores to open in abandoned areas. But in the middle of an empty, dead mall was just unusual.

The store also didn't look anything like the other ones. Probably another company trying to get into the competition.

I looked up at the deteriorating orange neon sign that read 'The Halloween Hut: Tis the Season to Dress Your Worse!'.

I walked in and was greeted by an employee sitting by the counter. I asked him if by chance they were hiring to which he said yes.

Flash forward to two weekends later, I sat at the same counter and was scrolling through my phone when a mom and her two kids entered the store.

The mother asked where the children’s costumes were and I pointed her to the far left corner. They hurried along as I waited for them to come back.

After a few minutes, I remembered that I didn't tell them to not try on the costumes. For some reason that was the one rule my boss really cared for.

I got out of my chair and headed towards them to let them know and to my horror I saw the mother lying dead on the floor as a small werewolf was feasting on her corpse.

It stopped and turned to face me. Growling, it lunges at me and I make a break for it. I was nearly out the door until a witch flicked her wand and tossed me back towards the werewolf.

The werewolf quickly sinks its' teeth into my right shoulder as I let out a scream. I shove it aside and push the witch into a rack of costumes. I rush out the front doors and don't stop running till I get home.

I called the cops but they found no store in that mall, nor traces that there ever was one. My family insists that I was just bitten by a rabid dog and the shock made me think like this.

But I know what happened was real and not because of the bite mark on my shoulder.

But because today while walking down my usual block I saw another Halloween Hut store appear next to the old movie theater.

A dad and her young daughter walked out. The daughter was holding a spider costume in her hand. I hope the dad isn't afraid of giant spiders...
