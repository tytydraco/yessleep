I fell in love with a dream thief.

That’s not a metaphor. She steals dreams.

People’s dreams. Memories. Souls, maybe. I'm still figuring that part out.

Everything about Lena felt wrong the moment I met her but in the most addicting, intoxicating way.  
I was at a grief recovery retreat. You know the type: crystals, candles, wealthy people trying to fix themselves with yoga and green juice. I wasn’t rich, but my sister had died suddenly, and my therapist convinced me I needed something.  
That’s where I met her.  

She was sitting cross-legged under a weeping willow near the lake, staring at the water like it held secrets only she could hear. Long auburn hair braided with black threads, eyes so dark they looked like ink spilled across her irises. And the way she looked at me like she already knew me.  
“Grief clings to you,” she said, before I even introduced myself. “You wear it like a second skin.”  
I should’ve walked away.  

Instead, I sat beside her. And from that moment on, I was hers.  

She told me things that made no sense. Said pain had “frequencies.” That the dead could echo in our thoughts if we knew how to listen. That our minds were just locked doors, and she had the keys.  
She said she was a dream walker. That she could help me “say goodbye” to my sister.  
That’s how it started.  

The first time Lena hypnotized me, it felt like sinking. Like falling backward into dark water. Her voice was a thread in the void, guiding me through images I didn’t know were inside me: my sister’s laughter, the smell of our childhood home, blood on the tile.

Then… I saw her.  

Not a memory. My sister. Standing in the hallway, confused, scared. Reaching for me. I tried to speak, but I had no mouth. No body.  
Lena pulled me out before I lost myself completely. She said too much contact could be dangerous. That the mind gets “addicted” to the echo.

But I wanted it.  

I begged her to take me deeper. She said I wasn’t ready. That projection could go wrong. You could leave your body and someone or something could take your place.  

“You’ll think it’s you,” she whispered one night, curled against me in bed. “But it won’t be.”  
I didn’t care.  

She started teaching me astral projection in secret. Said I had a rare kind of mind: “porous, slippery.” Whatever that meant. She’d burn herbs I couldn’t name, draw symbols on my chest with oil. Her voice would sink into me like roots.  

The first few times I left my body, it felt like floating. Like being a ghost. I could wander the retreat grounds, pass through walls. I saw people sleeping, dreaming, muttering secrets. I started visiting my sister’s echo again each time more vivid.  

But Lena warned me not to linger. "Time moves different out there," she said. "And you're not the only thing watching."  

One night, I didn’t come back.  

Not for hours. Maybe longer.

When I woke, I was screaming. My body didn’t feel right. My limbs felt delayed, like they didn’t belong to me. Lena was sitting in the corner, eyes hollow.
“You weren’t alone out there,” she said softly. “Something followed you back.”  

I laughed. Nervously. "You mean like a ghost?"  

She didn’t answer.  

After that, things got weird.  

I’d black out and find myself in strange places: naked in the garden. Kneeling in the lake. Scratching symbols into the walls of my cabin. My dreams bled into waking life. I saw my sister’s dead eyes reflected in mirrors. Woke up with blood on my hands.  

Lena started acting distant. Cold. Sometimes terrified of me.  

"You’re not you anymore,” she whispered once, backing away. “Not all the way.”  

I didn’t understand until I caught my own reflection blinking out of sync.  

The worst part? I liked it.  

The power. The freedom. I could visit memories like movies. Step inside someone’s dream and twist it like clay. I watched two strangers fall in love in their sleep, then turned it into a nightmare. I felt like a god.  

But something inside me was unraveling.  
I stopped sleeping. Not because I couldn’t but because I was afraid of who I’d be when I woke.  
Lena said we had to “sever the tether.” That my soul was becoming occupied. Something was piggybacking on me, learning me, preparing to overwrite me like a program.  

She kissed me hard that night. Said she loved me. Said she was sorry.  

Then she dosed my tea.  

I woke up in the dream again. But this time, it wasn’t mine.  

I was inside her.  

Lena’s memories. Her childhood. Her pain. The man she loved before me who tried to leave his body and never came back. I saw her screaming, chanting, holding a mirror to his face as something else smiled through it.  

Then I saw myself.

But not really.  

The thing wearing my face. Talking to people. Laughing. Smiling. It wasn’t me.  

And Lena was standing beside it. Holding its hand.  
“You left,” she said softly, not to me but to it. “He stayed.”  

She turned to me. “I had to choose. And he chose me first.”  

I tried to wake up. Couldn’t.  

I tried to scream. Couldn’t.  

I’ve been here ever since.  

A guest in a borrowed mind. Sometimes I slip through—take over for a few minutes. But it’s getting harder. He’s learning how to hold the wheel better.  

He calls himself “The Reflection.” Says he was trapped in the dreaming world for centuries. That Lena promised him a way out if he helped her find someone “porous.”  

Someone like me.  

The worst part?  

He’s doing a better job than I ever did. My family likes him. My friends say I finally seem happy. And Lena? She looks at him with that same soft love she once gave me.

I don’t think she regrets it.  

And I don’t think she’ll let me go.  

But sometimes, when she’s asleep really asleep I whisper to her.  

I tell her I still love her.  

And sometimes… she cries in her dreams.
