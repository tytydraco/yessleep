Isn't it weird that we remember certain things from childhood? For example, we can't remember our first kiss, but we can gladly remember what we ate for our 16th birthday. That's what I experience daily, a Deja Vu thing, if you will. But I'll never forget one night as a child when I spent the night with a dead man.

 I was only 11 years old when it happened; my mother, high as usual, was complaining about everything under the sun, the concept of life, and why she would never truly be happy. We were staying at a Holiday Inn just around the south side; Mom had one of her boyfriends staying with us. That same night, a fight started when one of them accused the other of infidelity, and probably rightfully so. My mother left hurriedly, forgetting her purse, shoes and me. I had to stay behind with this man I did not know; it was pitch-black when she left with only the TV as our light. The man was spread out on the bed and trying to fall asleep while I was on the floor; the night seemed to drag on forever as the stars slowly drifted past. As the night went on, I became hungry; in search of food, I found nothing. I wanted to ask the man on the bed if he had any food or if we could get some. I grabbed his hand and shook it, and a grumble was all I got.

 I took that as a sign not to bother him anymore and went back to watching the Television, the same old stuff on at night, mainly shopping network stuff. Behind me, I could hear a faint, sniffing noise. I looked behind me to see what it was, it was coming from the man. It sounded like he was having trouble breathing by himself. I continued to watch my shows, and it had become midnight when the power shut off; either the switch had tripped, or the entire block had gone, but I was in no position to find out as I was not going out of this room by myself. As I lay beside the bed, the man behind me made strange noises, like he was trying to catch his breath but couldn't. It seemed odd initially, but I ignored it and kept my thoughts to myself. As I sat there, I turned around to look at the man to see if he was still sleeping; his breathing got less rapid as time passed, and his flannel draped down the bed as it was at least three sizes too big.

 His hair was oily and musty smelling, and his breath had a foul fish smell. At around 12:30, it got so cold I couldn't stand it anymore. I tried hiding under the bed, but the dust kept making me sneeze, so I thought I would crawl onto the bed and get some warmth. I snuck beside the man, taking up half the bed and went under the covers. I was just about to fall asleep when I heard him make a wheezing sound. I turned around to look at him, and nothing was out of the ordinary. So I turned back and went to sleep. I awoke to my mother holding me; we were outside as she was talking to the police. Apparently, during the night, the man who slept next to me had died, and my mother found him when she got home that morning; where she was, I still have no idea. To this day, it still haunts me that during the night, he took his last breath, and I probably wasn't aware of it. I still haven't grasped what happened that night and likely never will.
