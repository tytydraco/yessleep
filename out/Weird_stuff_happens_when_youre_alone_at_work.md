So I’m a 20 year old guy who works at my university that I go to but for privacy reasons I will not disclose which one, I’m currently in my 3rd year and I recently picked up a job as a student assistant, I have had this job for about 4 months, and yeah here and there you get the occasional asshole customer but it is usually smooth sailing for me, so for some insight I work in an office space where I work customer service for my school, we usually get students of all ages who come in and need help with applications, school schedules, financial aid, all that.

But one particular day It was a Friday of all days I was by myself because two of my co workers went to break at around 2 which is how our normal schedule is since I come back to work at 1 from my lunch, and because of this I am always alone around this time nothing out of the ordinary. So it hits 2:00pm and my co workers go to their 2:00pm lunch, and everything is fine for about 15 minutes.

I had this older black woman come in and she needed help with an application, but this lady was a very church going woman she had transcripts from a church school that almost looked made up but I took them in and she told me how she goes to church, and that even at an old age she wants an education and a degree, you know the whole old people talk they usually give, and eventually  she was asking me what I believed in and if I go to church, she had some sort of like older name like one you really don’t hear, but anyway I answered, but shit got weird really fast. 

She needed help with something relating to her getting into her email, for some sort of form regarding her being an older student that’s applying to the university this is an important document to put into her application, I am used to helping with these sorts of documents. 

As I was helping her I seen in her sent emails was an email (I don’t know the details of) sent directly to ME not my work email but my PERSONAL EMAIL that only very few have and it kind of freaked me out, I don’t go around emailing people that personal email is just for my PlayStation account that’s all the email is for so I was freaking out wondering how she got that. I continued to help her but that was all that was going through my head. at the end she gave me a kiss on the cheek and told me to be safe I cannot make this shit up I have not seen her ever again and she got accepted but she never attended the school, coincidence? Maybe but holy I was freaked out for days after that but yeah drop comments on your guys thoughts on this shit.
