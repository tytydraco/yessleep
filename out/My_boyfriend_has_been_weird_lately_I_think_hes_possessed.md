This all started a few weeks ago. I was making my delicious avocado toast and egg breakfast when I got a knock on my front door. I opened the door, only to be greeted by my boyfriend, Matthew. 

"Matt? What are you doing? Shouldn't you be teaching the kids at school? Its 10am!!" Matthew responded with "Nah, just popped to Aldi. I don't really care about those kids. Can i come in?" In confusion, I still decided to let him in although i didn't understand what was happening. All of a sudden, he threw his shoes off and started crawling on all fours across my kitchen floor. 

"Matt, what the fuck? Did you take drugs?" He screamed at me and began to run up my stairs, still on all fours. I immediately called up my best friend, I'm not gonna share her name on here but let's just call her Miss Williamson. She arrived at my front door in a matter of 5 minutes.

 "so what's going on?" She asked. I explained everything that happened when all of a sudden, he zoomed down the stairs and started licking Miss Williamson's feet. "Ooh scrumdidillyumptious" he muttered under his breath as he continued to lick.

 "WOOF WOOF" he began to bark. "I LIVE UNDER THE SEA, MY NAME IS PEE PEE, YOU MUST WORSHIP MEE" at that moment, I ran out of that house and drove away. I went to stay at my brother's house, Jake. 

"Jake! Matt is going crazy again! Please let me stay!!" Jake turned with an oddly huge grin. His teeth, razor sharp, blood covering them. That's when I knew something was up. This wasn't a prank. 

It couldn't have been. Fearfully, I started to back away, when I heard an unmistakable sound. "Bark.. bark..." Came from behind me. I turned and saw Miss Williamson and Matt. I began to run, knowing they would start humping my leg if I stayed still.

 They began to say "daddy's gonna make me choke" in sync as they crawled on all fours, attempting to hump my leg. I ran ever faster, I prayed I could make it back to my car. Thankfully, I got back in. But it was too late. The radio was on, and I kept hearing "DADDY'S GONNA MAKE ME CHOKE".

 I was terrified. It would never turn off and I zoomed away, but suddenly, I had no fuel. I was stranded. I hopped out of my car and ran to the nearest gas station. They let me stay there for the night but at 3am I got a tickling sensation on my feet. 

I opened my eyes and saw my boyfriend, my best friend and my brother licking my feet. "what the fuck." I whispered but the sensation kinda felt nice. So I went back to bed, letting them lick me. I woke up, and my feet were sore. I think i am one of them now. I keep crawling on all fours and humping people's legs and licking their feet. Plz send help. I'm gonna die.
