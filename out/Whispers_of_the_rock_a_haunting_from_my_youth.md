When I was around 5 years old, I made what at the time I thought was a make-believe friend from a rock I'd found. Well actually my dad found it but I didn't know that at the time. While I don't remember exactly how it was It came into possession, the earliest memory I have of my once friend is walking around the front porch of my house to see it sitting on a bench underneath the veranda. The way this rock was placed was if it was not only looking over the yard, but also just waiting. As any child of that age I grabbed the stone and that's where my memory ends. I try and think back to any other time before that, but its as far a memory I can think back upon my childhood. 


When I became older my parents split up and one day as I sat in the nearly empty house with my dad, I'd told him about my rock friend and the memory I once had.


"That's funny, I remember walking in on you a couple times, always talking to a wall or a door. You would always be scared when I asked what was up" 


We both would almost laugh at these situations as we were both into the supernatural, although I think my dad just wanted to believe anything of the macabre as a way to cope through the divorce. 
On that day as I would leave the house for the last time, sat on the window still was my small lumpy companion. Faint blue marker circles for can be seen as what seems to be a kids attempts to eyes. I knew this hadn't been there when I came in originally, but I grabbed it and shoved it into my pocket nonetheless 


I was 12 at this age as I remember it was the night of my birthday when my rock first spoke to me. I had it on my nightstand almost always holding down whichever book I was reading at the time (usually goosebumps). I had just put down the book when I head I grumbling whisper in my brain, not my ear, My brain. Like it was echoing through my soul.


"A Gladiator or a tormentor?"


My first time honest reaction was that I was just tripping balls from tiredness. So I said "fuck yeah, Gladiator" as if I was choosing which dream to fall asleep to. Sure enough i have one of those intensely realistic dreams, where I'm dragged down an old stone passage way, to come out to the Roman Colosseum. As breathtaking as it was seeing the inside of a monument I'd never consider of one day seeing, nothing was as breathtaking as the arrows and blades that tore through my body as I layed being massacred, limb by limb, joint by joint. I didn't even put up a fight. The pain was all so real just as the blurry view of the cheering crowd that surrounded the seats of the arena. 


"HOLD HIM DOWN"
"HOLD HIM DOWN"


They chanted as my remaining upper torso watched an oncoming stanpleade of horses and carriages, ready to demolish whatever had been already demolished of me. That's when at God last I'd woken up..nearly.. I was in a state of sleep paralysis, something that unfortunately wasn't uncommon. I had become so use to these accuracies that I trained myself to slowly be able to slowly and heavily pinch whatever skin I can as hard as I can to wake myself up. This time was different as while I layed there in complete darkness, the inside of my skull had felt a faint stomping within itself. As if the stampede was going on in the dream world (whatever the fuck that means). Once i had awoken, i was able to comprehend the other aspect that differentiated itself in this recurring nightmare reality, which was Instead of skin I felt pinching, was hard, tough, stone.


I just needed to get this out of my system which is why I'm recounting these experiences in text for other people to read and possibly understand what is happening to me. As today I had found out why it was in fact my beloved rock being the one whispering to me that night. I currently sit here has a bloody rock sits beside my unconscious dad. 
Then comes that same deep, ghastly voice reverberating through my body like some sort of spiritual enlightenment, through my spine and out my head. 
"Tormentor, or gunman?" 
I've yet to made a decision.
