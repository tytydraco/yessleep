’m posting this partly to vent, and partly because I need to know I’m not losing my mind.

Three months ago, I got out of a very complicated relationship. From the outside, it probably looked “difficult but normal.” He was controlling. The more I stayed quiet, the more he took over. When it ended, I didn’t feel free — just empty.

So I decided to reset everything.
New city.
New apartment.
New number.
New life.

I rented a small, quiet apartment where no one knew me. The first couple of weeks were hard, but once I settled in, I started to feel okay.

That’s when the small things started getting strange.

During the first week, I woke up one morning to find two coffee mugs on the kitchen table.
I live alone. I hadn’t had any visitors.

I told myself I must’ve forgotten. Stress does that to you.

The second week, after a hot shower, I noticed something on the bathroom mirror. Finger marks in the steam — like someone had written a word.
I couldn’t read it clearly. I wiped it off and didn’t think too much about it.

The third week is when I couldn’t ignore things anymore.

I was cleaning out my phone — deleting old messages, trying to fully move on. That’s when I realized something terrifying:

There were no messages from my ex.
No arguments.
No apologies.
No breakup conversation.

We had texted for months. Even if I deleted them, there should’ve been something. A backup. An email. A trace. There was nothing.

And yet… some nights, my phone would vibrate.

No notification.
No call.
Just vibration.

One night, I pulled out a notebook I’d been keeping since the move — something I used to “organize my thoughts.” Toward the last pages, my heart started pounding.

The handwriting was mine.
But I didn’t remember writing any of it.

“If you’re reading this, you’ve forgotten again.
You can’t go back to him.
He isn’t real.
And neither are you — the way you think you are.”

There was a date at the bottom.

Yesterday.

I didn’t sleep that night. The next morning, I went downstairs and asked the building manager about the previous tenant. She gave me a strange look.

“This apartment’s been empty for three years,” she said.
“The last woman who lived here… had your name.”

I laughed nervously. Thought it was a joke.

Then she added,
“The police came once. She kept reporting messages she had sent to herself.”

Back in my apartment, my hands were shaking. I went to the bathroom and looked at the mirror.

This time, the writing was clear.

“You never knew him. But he created you.”

That’s when everything clicked.

I didn’t leave a complicated relationship.
I was what remained after it erased me, piece by piece.
This “new life” wasn’t new at all — it was a loop I kept restarting.

And here’s the real twist:

Those phone vibrations aren’t from him.
They’re from me.

Reminders I set so I wouldn’t forget.

But every time…
starting over feels easier than remembering.
