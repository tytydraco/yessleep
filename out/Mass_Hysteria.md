I have always been a fearful man. Sudden sounds and surprising shadows never fail to send my soul spiraling. As such, there have been few places where I've been able to find solace, and it wounds my heart to have one of them so irrevocably tainted. I fear that I may never be allowed to forget what emerged from the womb of Bai Shan, the Giant Panda. 


The sun was shining, mockingbirds sailed lazily through the afternoon sky, and I found myself lost again in the bustling crowds of the San Diego zoo. When I was younger, I would have hated it. The shuffling of elbows, the occasional glancing of one ankle against another. As I've matured I've come to appreciate how easy it is to become lost in a sea of faces. Especially in a place like that, where exotic beasts lay caged behind glass. Surely, in the face of such sterling examples of nature's graceful, brutal, efficiency, anybody would be a fool to spend their time in judgment of a man. 


Bai Shan had been receiving extra attention lately due to her surprise pregnancy. The zoo had no breeding program for their panda at the time, due to rising tensions with China, so the caretakers were completely baffled when her discolored coat of white fur mottled with brown dirt began to swell at the belly. 


I stood admiring the lazy dozings of a pair of cougars, lost in thought as I rolled my gaze across muscled jaws and paws easily twice the size of a man's hand. Suddenly the flow of people began to reverse its course. I stretched my ear toward the conversation of passersby, without even fully meaning to. 


"Bro, c'mon! Tony is over by the Panda and he says it's grunting like a pig!" 


I was befuddled by what I had overheard. Was it choking? Vomiting? Had something gone wrong with the pregnancy? I rushed over to the exhibit, others running alongside me in a torrent of bodies. Hundreds of people congregated there, joined by mockingbirds in equal number, sitting in hushed masses barely obscured behind the vibrant purple blooms of the Jacaranda trees. The plaza was silent beyond the sound of beating wings and pounding footsteps growing more distant as the available space dwindled. When the last of the witnesses arrived, the branches, laden with heavy blossoms and birds alike, sagged dangerously beneath the weight; the sound of footsteps bleeding distantly into nothing. 


I don't know if you've ever seen the way a Panda gives birth, but it's nothing like it was for Bai Shan. Typically the infant bear, smaller than a child's shoe, springs forth from its mother's womb in a comically effortless way, anticlimactically launching the baby from its birthing canal. Bai Shan's labor was anything but effortless. 


I pushed to the front of the crowd, and was horrified at the blatant agony on display. Bai Shan laid flat on her back, muscles twitching in violent spasms as her gut stretched desperately against its bounds. An older woman, somewhere in her 40's, fainted as the shape of a paw violently distended Bai Shan's stomach. The paw pushed against its mother's skin, making itself plainly visible through the thick fur. A long, wet, schlicking sound crept out from the enclosure. What happened next is something I have a difficult time putting into words. The skin of Bai Shan's belly seemed to suddenly rip and snap back to its place, and the paw remained pressed against her fur, stretching it as if it were a single, contiguous membrane. This second skin began to fill with blood until it was fat and sagging like an overful water balloon. 


Bai Shan grunted, heaved and roared. Her pelvic floor rocked with a horrible, internal impact. The edges of her labia suddenly tore open, oozing red blood into white fur as a mass ripped its way out from within her, splitting its mother's pelvis completely. Bai Shan roared in terrible, grueling misery as a torso, far too developed for an infant, emerged from her womb. It was followed rapidly by a forelimb, the hind legs, another forelimb, and finally the head. 


Several spectators turned to flee, hoping to find a safe place to vomit, but found themselves blocked by the throng of bodies. A daisy chain of bile spread through the crowd, lacing the air with a thick sheen of pungent, acidic stench. 


Each body part launched from within her with a wet popping sound, landing in a flurry of slimy thuds across the dirt. The crowd stood in shocked silence, parents quietly ushering away crying children as I tried to make sense of it. Bai Shan wasn't due to give birth for another three months, at least, yet the heap of anatomy all seemed to belong to a cub already three months old. A boy no older than 11, with a hat bearing the insignia of the San Diego Padres, was the first to notice. He spoke softly, but was heard by all amid the horrified stillness. I remember a sense of relief at the momentary distraction, instantly squashed by the words he spoke. 


"Is it...moving?" 


He breathed the question as if it were a thought gone rogue, drawing my eye, along with hundreds of others, back to the gorey pile as it began to sit up. The limbs pulsed with waves of dark, crimson blood from where they were meant to meet the thorax. Small balls of bone, bones meant to be securely fastened into sockets, pulled gently at the fur, wet with blood, as they moved toward their position. 


All the pieces fell into place, and immediately fell back out as they slid past their mark. The left forelimb continued on to glide around its back like a figure skater, with the right one hesitating at the shoulder, as if waiting for its turn. The raised paw rotated forward at the wrist, moving back around through the arm and returning to its original position. The cub's hips rotated independent of its torso twisting the creature's midsection up like a wrung-out rag. My stomach lurched at the sound of skin drawn past taut and the grotesque clicking of vertebrae pushed beyond their limits. 


All at once a high-pitched whine, like some supercharged form of tinnitus, tore through my ears. I clapped my hands to my head, hoping to insulate myself from the noise, but it was no use. All around me, people repeated my motions, many collapsing. After several minutes of writhing excruciation the sound abated, leaving us to pick ourselves up from the ground. Bewildered, furious eyes turned to the cub. 


One of the bear's hind legs had found its mark, locking itself into the joint. The bear balanced on one foot which spun about the ankle, causing the infant Panda to dance a slow pirouette as its other limbs slid across its form. Something in the motion gave me a sickening sense of celebration. As if the baby were dancing to herald its own arrival. 


A brunette in a red leather coat screamed out what we had all been thinking as she hung on her husband's arm. 


"KILL IT!" 


Her pleading prompted the man to draw a revolver from the holster on his hip. He leveled the barrel square at the horror's head, but the shot went wide and struck Bai Shan. 


The cub spun its head toward the sound of its mother's cries, with the head continuing its rotation until it locked its eyes on the cowboy. The cub's brow furrowed in a move that struck me as all too human, and leaned its head back. The head continued along its trajectory until it disappeared into the cub's torso. The woman from before let out a scream which sounded half-hearted, as if her fear were battling a desire to draw as little attention as possible, and the crowd began to scatter in a panicked stampede as the cub's head rolled itself impossibly back out from the center of the man's chest. 


The man looked down, jumping in such startled surprise that his Stetson went flying off his head. He screamed in a horrified rage as he slammed the barrel of the revolver against the infant's skull, pulling the trigger just a moment too late. The bullet tore through empty air before lodging itself in the skull of the woman in the red coat. She collapsed to the ground, her head producing a sickening crunch against the plaza's stone pavers. 


The mockingbirds cried out in her voice:
KILL ITKILL ITKILL ITKILL ITKILL IT


I wished desperately that I could flee, but the tide of rushing bodies was far too strong. To enter that current would be to subject myself to a thousand trampling feet. The bear re-emerged from the skull of a man to my right, this time with shredded grey matter caking its fur as the man collapsed in a seizure. The bear squealed in delight as it rolled itself back into his head, disappearing once again. 


KILLITKILLITKILLIT


I looked around wildly for any way to escape, finding my eyes drawn back to the man with the gun as he climbed down into the enclosure. The cub's head had returned to its body, and the man fired four more shots as he approached. Each bullet swung wildly away from its path, as if the very idea of a straight line were distorted by the infant's presence. He reached for a large rock, hefting it up over his head and bringing it down with a furious yell. Bai Shan's second skin burst catastrophically as the cub was crushed beneath the stone. The cowboy was swept off of his feet by the crimson torrent of blood. He drew himself back up in rage, and resumed smashing the cub, a wet thump echoing across the plaza again and again and again and again and again. 


KILLITKILLITKILLIT


When he had finished with the cub, he turned his rage toward Bai Shan. The already dying bear groaned and cried real human tears as the man slammed the stone against her skull over and over until blood and brain matter sprayed out across the ground. Then he turned his eyes to me. 


KILLITKILLITKILLIT


I've never had any explanation for how I became the focus of his rage. Perhaps he felt me watching him. How he managed to scramble up the deep walls of the enclosure is another thing which eludes me. He was on me within a minute, raining down a hail of furious punches. The impact came again and again, blurring my vision and drawing red into the corners of the world as blood ran from my forehead. At the edge of unconsciousness, a shot rang out and the mockingbirds scattered. The man clutched at his side and staggered, allowing me to slip loose. I ran like hell as the police, finally arriving, swarmed over top of him. 


After visiting a walk-in medical clinic where a very gruff woman with thickly muscled wrists poked and prodded my various bruises and lacerations, I returned to my home. I opened the lock and turned the door's handle, feeling a strange sense of absence. The knob was frail and cold beneath my skin, with a thinness like that of rice paper. I turned it gently, unable to tear myself from the irrational idea that I might accidentally crush the solid brass between my fingers. 


I don't remember that evening well. I know that I didn't bother to cry, or vomit, because what would be the use of that?  The only thing I truly remember is staring at the rich, forest green of my living room walls. Something in the color had changed, and I must have sat for hours trying to figure out precisely what it was. A stain? A scratch? A smudge? Each time I began to get closer to solving the mystery, a great anxiety coursed through me and I found myself suddenly lost again; as if my thoughts had walked in a circle. 


I woke in a blind panic the next morning, slapping at my alarm clock and feeling only slick, lacquered wood beneath my fingers. I blinked sleep from my eyes, realizing the alarm had yet to sound. The clock had shifted several inches back and to the right, the nightstand on which it rested visibly sagging toward that corner. I wearily lifted the unnaturally heavy duvet off of me, my feet cold against the floor, as I moved to investigate. At the right corner nearest the wall the table's leg had sunk itself several inches down into the floor. I feared rot in the boards, so I attempted to move the nightstand. I hoisted at the sunken leg, finding it absurdly heavy. Lifting at the other end only allowed me to pivot the table around that single point. In desperation, I attempted to overturn the whole table, but stopped as the leg didn't move at all, only threatening to separate itself from the piece of furniture. I sat back in vexation, a ringing making itself louder in my ears. After several minutes of stewing, the sunken corner popped slightly up into the air before landing in its usual position. 


I heaved at the table, finding myself far exceeding the minimum effort required, hoisting it far higher into the air than intended. Moving it away from the wall, I inspected the floor. There was no sign of damage beyond a bizarre, spiraled warping on the surface. 


"Yeah..." I said, to nobody in particular, "yeah, fuck this." 


I left my home as quickly as I could and tapped the cutesy little icon of a hellish food delivery app. I'd had to resort to freelance work since losing my job a professor of astronomy. By the time I came home, I found myself exhausted and barely turning a profit. Things went on like that for three weeks, with the customers growing increasingly confounding and the tips shrinking down to nearly nothing. The only reprieve I could find in the humdrum of it all was in the lens of my telescope. The stars, a constant presence. Unshakable, predictable. I found comfort in the austere adherence to their path through the cosmos. 


One afternoon, as I quickly scarfed down a burger which claimed to be "up to 59%" beef, I shifted my gaze to the shitty old TV in the corner. 


"-sources say that the French President is in stable condition after today's incident at the White House." 


A plain man, all his edges worn away by decorum and submission to a role, wore a somber expression as he delivered the news. 


"For those of you just joining us, something truly bizarre has happened in today's meeting between President Fictiono and the French President Imaginaire L'homme. During a very heated, and very public, discussion President L'homme pointed his finger in the face of President Fictiono. Suddenly, the tip of L'hommes extended finger appeared to shear off at the first knuckle, with the severed segment of the digit seeming to plummet with enough force to smash Vice President Maydup's right kneecap on impact." 


A zoomed out, censored video of the event played on loop as he spoke, the only corroborative details visible being the shared looks of pain and horror between the heads of state.


"The French President has wasted no time in attempting to spin this event as an assassination attempt from the Fictiono administration, though there is little evidence at this time. President Fictiono has fired right back with accusations of his own, here are his comments." 


The camera cut to President Fictiono. He was an Italian man, 42 years of age, with swarthy skin and jet black hair. 


"I tell you, I couldn't believe it. It was incredible, I've never seen anything like it
I walked in I said 'Imaginaire, what have you done with your finger? Why would you do this to your finger, Imaginaire?' It was incredible, really, and, for Idiot Imaginaire to accuse me of doing this to him, when my Vice President, who is a really tremendous person, sustained a serious injury, is really, I think, shameful, frankly." 



I left a $10 bill on the table as a gratuity and made my way out the door. Driving home in horrid silence, I felt as if the whole world had begun to fold in on itself. The feeling was largely unprovoked, beyond the strange happenings in the news, and completely inexplicable, yet each landscape that stretched out before me filled with a nausea. As if something incongruent with our reality had soaked itself into the very fibers of existence. 


Tensions between the two nations rose exponentially over the next week, with both parties claiming innocence and both equally unable to explain what had happened. Then the burgeoning conflict came to a screeching halt on the night Pinko Baebae died. 


During a performance of her song, "Dreamboat Mayhem", Pinko leaned forward to belt out the climactic lyric: "dreamboat but the motion of the ocean sucks!" 


The word "sucks" dragged out into a surprised shout as Pinko faceplanted onto the stage. Witnesses reported it happening so fast that it appeared as if she had teleported, with the majority of her skull bursting on contact with the stage. The crowd fell into a confused silence as the pounding beat thrummed on, then they began to panic. Seventeen people were trampled in the ensuing chaos, including musical legend Jack Fable who tried, bafflingly, to soothe the crowd by performing the song "Bridge Over Troubled Water" in while blocking one of three exits. 


These events were disturbing to me, but distant. Horrifying in the same way as a bombing or some far-off famine, with the distance providing the delusion of immunity. 


This delusion was violently dispelled on a late afternoon trip to the grocery store. I have suffered for most of my life with a profound case of cibophobia, which led to hours of checking expiration dates and ingredient lists for potential hazards. I stood before the glass doors of the dairy display attempting to discern which of the gallon jugs would have the most longevity with the least risk. I was startled when the seventh jug I'd picked up to evaluate began swirling at the bounds of its plastic packaging. It was a whirlpool held perpendicular to the jug, with its vortex pointed out towards my face. 


Again and again, I found the bizarre anomaly forming itself. Just before giving up completely the jug I'd been holding seemed to rip itself from my grasp. The handle I'd laced my fingers through tugged horribly at the digits bending them each backward against their joints in a way which threatened to snap tendons if resisted. The jug burst against the floor, showering myself and others in milk. The scene reminded me vaguely of what had happened to Pinko Baebae, though the splatter this time was a pallid ivory rather than the disgusting, greyed crimson of blood and brain matter. 


From all around the grocery store there came a ridiculous clatter, followed by screams of panic and pain alike. A woman in aisle 7 had her right foot punched clean through by a can of baked beans. A man in the produce section of the store was screaming, his hand trapped beneath a head of cabbage which stubbornly rebuffed attempts to free himself. 


The self-checkout was a complete disaster, with each machine crumpled and bent as if hit by a series of trucks. Employees argued with customers over the idea of accountability while EMTs began to stream in. I left as quickly as I could, hoping to evade whatever bedlam had come for us. 


Hours into my nightly food delivery runs, I was hit with a brutal case of the "fuck-its. I eyed the pepperoni pizza in my passenger seat with a sense of guilt as I turned into my driveway. I didn't want to disappoint the person waiting, but with all that had gone on, I was past the point of truly caring. 


I dumped the derelict pizza in the dumpster outside my home. I am not one to be wasteful, but the idea of eating something touched by an unknowable number of hands is a bridge too far. I shuffled through the dim hallway, noticing that the lights had taken on a strange, weary quality. Sitting down in my favorite armchair, I found the cushion with an odd dampness. Wet doesn't feel like the right word, with the viscosity of the substance. It was more as if the cushion had been *suffused* with some viscous ooze the color of phlegm after you've been sick. I slapped at the seat, setting it jiggling gently in its place, and when I pressed down firmly I could see the bizarre goop squeezing its way past the fibers of the cushion's blue cover. 


Disgusted, but resigned to dealing with it another time,  I moved the chair aside and placed myself on the floor. The television turned on with an audible click, humming in a way I hadn't heard since 2007 at the latest. My television is a Roku. To be completely honest with you, the oddity barely registered, because of what was on display. 


A brunette sat behind the newsdesk, eyes wide and bright, mouth hanging open in a slight smile. Something about her looked oddly familiar. She was sitting there staring directly into the camera for well over fifteen seconds before she began to speak. 


"Good evening, thank you for joining me tonight. I hope sincerely that you're all doing okay out there. By this point, we've all seen the massive amount of videos posted to Clitter in the last two hours." 


I had no idea what she was referring to. I don't have a Clitter because I believe it's mindpoison, and also because I fear accidentally drawing the ire of some madman, but that's neither here nor there. 


"The incident which took place with Imaginaire L'homme seems to be repeating itself across the globe. People everywhere are experiencing a spontaneous, instantaneous loss of limb and, often, death. We obviously can't show you videos, as they're extremely disturbing. We urge everybody to stay safe out there, lock your doors and open the blinds. Here's what we know about the phenomena so far." 


The graphic on the green screen behind her crumpled itself silently before switching to a new graphic, the words "what we know" emblazoned across a picture of Bai Shan. 


"Nothing. We know nothing, and that's all we deserve to know. We killed that baby bear. We all did that, on some level. We all bear the weight of that guilt." 


A patch of her forehead fell away, revealing the catastrophic entry wound of the bullet fired by her own husband, the cowboy. She was screaming now, with deep lines appearing in her skin as her face contorted in a shaking rage. 


"KILLITKILLITKILLIT"  she shouted in a mocking sneer. 


A dozen gunshots rang out all at once from behind the camera, obliterating the upper portion of her skull completely. She pounded her fists against the desk so rapidly and with such force that it drove its legs down through the floor, bringing the woman's legs along with it. I turned off the television. 


"Oh for fuck's sake." 


I was more exasperated than anything by this point. It seemed as if some bizarre bullshit were waiting for me at every turn. 


Later that night, I sat down at my telescope, hoping to slip loose from the anxiety and frustration welling up within me. Instead, what I saw has driven me to the brink of madness. A man should have the right to be certain of things like the shade of the sky, or the rhythm of the heavens above.


To the left of Venus in the night sky, far beyond the bounds of our solar system, there was a red dwarf star flanked by two white dwarves. I was completely baffled by what I was seeing. Stars aren't meant to approach us, nor are they meant to twist their shape so fluidly. They swirled and deformed themselves, bending their shape to slide past one another like oil in water. Nausea rushed into my gut. 


Whatever high strangeness had been occurring, I got the sense that it was all tied to the rogue stars. The thought appeared in my mind as if willed into existence by some outside force. 


I tossed the telescope out the window in a senseless raging against the way my reality had been sundered. It smashed across the concrete sidewalk which bisected my front lawn, lenses scattering about like viscera across the cold gray ground. It felt to me like a cruel joke. Some sardonic bit of humor borne of causality and random chance. With nothing being sacred, and no refuge left to turn to, I decided I'd set out the very next morning to try and find some sort of sense in all this. 


I stayed up all night pondering possible first steps, endlessly cycling through excuses to do nothing instead. In the end, I had managed to convince myself that the only path forward was to visit the site of Pinko Baebae's death. 


The auditorium had, naturally, been deathly silent in the aftermath of the incident. All shows had been canceled for the foreseeable future. The venue offered reasons like "respect for the dead" and "safety," and the reality of it made the lying understandable. 


As I approached the stage, and the spot where Pinko made impact, I could just barely perceive a muffled singing. There, embedded in the hardwood, was the frontal plane of Pinko's face. It appeared as if somebody had sliced her skull cleanly, just behind the cheekbones. My gut coiled violently against itself as the whites of her eyes rolled around, as if aware of my presence and trying to get a look at me. 


My horror redoubled itself as I noticed the subtle movement of her shattered jaws. Constrained by the wood, they bumped almost imperceptibly against one another. Slowly, painfully slowly, they wriggled until escaping their confines. Her face floated through the air now like paper caught by the wind. 


"The prince is born in pieces
I count them as they come
A debt is owed for each
An incalculable sum


His recompense is presence
His presence is a scar
Unending, rending effervescence 
Born of twisted stars"


Pinko turned to me as she sang, with tears streaming out from her ruined eyes.


"Irreverence fills his halls
The candles bear no fire
And all along his walls are strung
The souls who drew his ire"


I was paralyzed by her gaze, by the impossibility of it all. 


"I pray with liar's tongue
A song that's sung in round
I'll slip loose of his vengeful eye
And sink into the ground" 



The word "ground" dragged out, hanging on the ou sound. It resounded far into the corners of the stadium. After holding the note for upwards of fifteen seconds, Pinko suddenly seemed to be overcome with a great sense of peace. There, floating far above the stage which she had graced so many times, Pinko Baebae closed her bloodshot eyes forever. Piece by piece, her face came undone and fell gracelessly to the floor. 


I was bemused and angry with myself. I had set out to get answers, but only succeeded in subjecting myself more bizarre bullshit. I stomped out of the stadium, the hollow light of LED streetlamps glowing gently through the fog as I walked. It wasn't hard to get lost in thought, especially since Pinko's song had been something of an earworm. 


Life seemed to be coming apart completely in the time since Bai Shan gave birth that I felt a welling of either nausea or despair in my stomach. Even though I had just barely begun, I felt as if I would make no progress in my quest for-


"Answers! You want em, we've got em! You've seen the odd tidings. You know that this world belongs to us no more. So why are you trying to remain unaltered? Adapt with us, and welcome the king's wind of change." 


An amputee sat on the curb in front of an abandoned church, resting the stump of his wrist against a railing. I was perplexed by the coincidence of my thought and his speech, but took it for simple providence. He locked his eyes on me, clearly recognizing how my gaze fixed on the ragged, bleeding stump of his arm. 


"Oh this? This is nothing! He demands a price from us all and I have happily paid the cost. Come inside, you could settle your debts too." 


"Ah, sure. Whatever." 


The floor inside was slick with blood, but the building around it was devoid of the chaos found everywhere else. The amputee from out front introduced me to a man who was scheduled to have his leg removed later that day. His name was Harold Pringle. 


"Nice to meet you, Mr. Pringle. Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?"  


"Shoot." 


"Okay, starting with the elephant in the room. What made you decide to mutilate yourself?" 


"Haha, that's an interesting way to frame it. You sound a bit like me from a couple of days ago. I didn't believe in any of this either, until I started to feel a pulling on my leg.  I knew at that point it was an 'easy way, hard way' thing so it just seemed logical to choose the easy way." 


"A 'pulling'?" I repeated the word inquisitively. 
He nodded. 


"I'm not quite sure how to explain it, frankly. Have you ever tried to push the same poles of two magnets together? Negative-negative, that kind of thing?"


"Of course, I think we've all done that at some point." 


"Right, that's a bit like how it feels to have my leg in its place right meow." 


"I'm sorry, did you just say 'right meow'?" 


"Did I?" He smiled a little here in a way which betrayed his mischief. "Anyway, it's like my leg used to be part of me, but now it isn't. Like it's no longer something that is of my body, but something all its own. What used to be the seam where part meets whole has become a barrier between things entirely their own."


"Okay, Mr. Pringle, that's awesome. Thank you for your time." 


I shook his hand and left the church as quickly as possible. I was getting desperate, sure, but not to the point of removing limbs. 


As I drove home, I saw countless people getting spontaneously dismembered along the sidewalks, different parts of their bodies either becoming too heavy for the flesh to support, or becoming separated by the sudden incursion of some new mass.  One woman's neck ballooned out as if she were a frog, never retracting from the inflated position. The way she fell made it obvious that she was paralyzed at the very least, the distortion of her flesh wreaking havoc on her spine. A man in plumber's overalls collapsed straight down, becoming folded unnaturally beneath the altered weight of his own shoulders. I've never been more relieved to see my own driveway. 


As I lay here in my bed, I think maybe I ought to consider going back, though I can't imagine it would matter. As I lay here in my bed, I can feel my heart growing heavier in my chest, and I know that it might rip itself away at any moment.
