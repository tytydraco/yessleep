I have a long commute to work.

I work as a security guard for a public park. It’s not the most ideal job or even my career goal, but it’s really hard to argue with 25 bucks an hour, Monday through Friday, 8 hours, 8pm-4am, more than worth the 2 hour commute I have to make for the job. Like I said it’s not ideal but I make enough to live.

I’ve thought about moving closer to the park but I get by with my roommates right now and asking them to uproot their lives is a huge ask. So I just deal. The jobs are easy and the pay is good so the drive is really the only inconvenient part of the job.

Every night I switch off to the morning watchman, a guy named Harry, he’s an insane stoner who lives in the area and walks to work; kinda spacey but he’s cool. Once we switch off I start my commute back home. 

I’ve been doing this 5 days a week for about a year and until recently just fell into a nice routine with things.

Last Monday I was driving home. I have a weird bit of paranoia at night and have made a habit of checking my backseat while driving, turning on my cabin lights and briefly looking back. There's always nothing there and I always know nothing's gonna be there. But I can’t help it. I looked back this time and saw a person under my car blanket sitting down staring at me in my rear view mirror, I froze.

Before you judge me, please answer me what exactly you’d do in this scenario. You're driving on a backroad, the last bit of civilization was 30 minutes back, you look in your rear view and see a person you can’t see sitting up in your car, mind you, I’m a woman, this is a deep seeded fear of mine; I didn’t know his intentions with me. What would you do? What could you do? Take your hands off the wheel and attack the guy? Swerve into a ditch? Pull over and risk provoking this person who's been silently watching you for god knows how long? I started laughing. I don’t know why, maybe it was a nervous breakdown, but I just couldn’t stop laughing. 

Horrifically the person chuckled back which provoked me to laugh even more, we just laughed and laughed for 10 minutes of driving. Eventually I slowed down and came to my senses enough to try and assess the situation. He hadn’t killed me yet… he was laughing with me. Maybe he was prone to reason. So I hesitantly spoke.

“H-hey man… so… you're not gonna kill me are you?” I said still chuckling a bit from my previous fit.

The man under the blanket just stared at the rear view for a handful of seconds that felt like hours.

“Not if you keep driving. I just need to get to the Chevron here in Woodburn.”

I know it might sound stupid but that immediately washed my body with relief. Woodburn isn’t a hyper populated city but it’s a city. And the chevron was open with employees in the shop at 5 am. I could survive this. I said.

“Ok man… but-!”

The man immediately interrupted me.

“Stop fucking talking bitch.”

My heart sank into my stomach. He spoke with the cadence of a drunk dad at his limit, and he implied earlier he could kill me. I didn’t wanna provoke him. 

30 minutes went by. I couldn’t help but continue to look back at the man in the back of my car. It was almost constant to the point that I nearly swerved into a ditch. This provoked him.

“Next time you look back here I’m gonna bite your fucking throat out.”

That was a new threat. But it put the fear of god in me and I stared at the endless Oregon backroad. 

20 minutes went by, and I started feeling a wet breath creep down my back. I kept my eyes on the road as his breathing got exasperated, hot, uncomfortable against my neck, my pupils dilated and time slowed.

10 more minutes went by and I felt something tug at my hair, the breathing extended to my head and I felt my hair roots heat up. I pissed myself out of fear, something I’ve never done before. Finally Woodburn was in sight, the Chevron was right off the backroad entrance and the second I saw it I nearly hit someone pulling into the station. 

The second I my car stopped I slammed open my door and dove out of my car screaming for help leaving my car in drive, I ran towards the shop screaming for help. The gas station attendant followed me out to my car.  It managed to stop on a blue pole sticking out of the cement and we looked in my passenger seat. But the dude wasn’t there. I cried. I begged the guy to believe me and call the police and he obliged. 

Police investigated my car, I was crying to an officer the entire time recounting the scenario. There was no evidence of tempering in my car, and I of course had no signs of trauma on me. I couldn’t describe the man, cus he was under a blanket the entire time, there was nothing the cops could do and honestly I couldn’t even blame them… I was at a total loss myself.

So now I’m on here… posting about it. I’m having one of my roommates drive me and pick me up from work for the next couple weeks at least, I feel bad because he’s got the day off but he’s a great guy, we used to date and he still cares a lot about me so as long as I’m lying for gas he’s down. 

What the fuck happened to me? You think this was like… a hallucination? I just… I’m fucking scared… I haven’t been able to sleep for days thinking of what could’ve happened to me… and I’m just supposed to believe it wasn’t real? Any insights would be valuable… Thank you.
