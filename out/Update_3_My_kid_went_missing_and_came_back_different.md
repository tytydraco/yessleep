Looks like I’m back on Reddit again, talking about aliens and LSD like a total lunatic.

If you didn’t read my last posts: My son disappeared for two weeks. When he came back, he was different. I met a guy I called “Fred” who said something similar happened to his daughter. He claimed aliens replaced our kids, and their real souls are still out there. He wanted me to take psychedelics to find my son’s spirit or whatever. I thought he was nuts. Now I’m not so sure.

Anyway, thanks to everyone who’s been supportive so far. This is the update you asked for—or maybe just another breakdown. Honestly, I can’t tell the difference anymore.

Still no improvement. Nothing that makes me think he’s coming back. And I’ve tried. I’ve been rational. I’ve been patient. I told myself Fred was just some crazy drug addict. I wanted to believe that. But it’s getting harder. My son’s sleeping less and less. Fred said his daughter started going “nocturnal” too. I brushed it off at first, thought I was just seeing patterns that weren’t there. But now I can’t unsee it.

His eyes are different. I swear. They used to be this bright blue—like the sky on one of those perfect days. Almost silver in the sunlight. Now they’re flat. Gray-blue. Cold. Dull. Lifeless. Everyone says I’m imagining it, but I’m not. I know those aren’t his eyes. I carried him. I nursed him. I know every inch of him like I know myself, and that is not my son.

So I started testing him. Nothing major. Just small stuff. I put on movies with aliens or space themes, just to see if it triggered anything. I figured if he really wasn’t him, something would slip. I put on *Predator*. Whatever he is, the movie got him out of his emotionless state. He just started crying. Quietly. Shaking. Tears just streamed down his face like his body didn’t know how to react.

Fred said his daughter reacted like that too. Then came the weird drawings. The wandering. The self-harm. We’re not there yet, but it feels like we’re heading down the same track. Like whatever this is—it’s unraveling.

About Fred—I blocked him after we met. It felt like the sane thing to do. I didn’t want any part of his theories or his world. But after my last post, I started getting messages from a bunch of new accounts. All of them claiming to be Fred. And all of them *call* themselves Fred. But remember, that’s not even his real name. It’s what I called him to protect his identity. So either some of you are screwing with me (thanks), or someone else is watching.

And yeah, about the drugs. I really thought Fred was just some addict. But after how my son—whatever he is—reacted to that movie, I started looking into it. You’ve probably seen me lurking in psychonaut and alien subs. I’m just trying to figure out if there’s *anything* to what Fred said. Even if there’s a 1% chance it helps me find my son, I’ll take it.

Which brings me to the part where everything fell apart.

It started with an email. Just a short, cold line: *“Can you stop by HR this afternoon?”* My stomach dropped the second I read it. I told myself it was routine. Probably paperwork. Maybe even something about my benefits. But I knew. I think I knew the moment I saw it.

When I walked into the conference room, they were all already there—my manager, my editor, someone from HR I’d never even met. No one said hello. Just that forced kind of silence that feels louder than talking.

They asked me to sit.

Then they opened my laptop.

They didn’t even ease into it. No preamble. No warnings. Just tabs. Screen captures. A printed list of the forums I’d visited—drug forums, alien subs, Reddit threads with usernames circled in yellow highlighter. 

They asked if I was okay.

I said yes.

They asked if I was using anything.

I said no. That it was research. Just background for a column I was thinking about writing.

It was a bad lie. I think I knew that too.

Then they dropped the bomb. Quietly. Almost gently, like they were trying not to scare me.

They’d found my Reddit account. All of it. Every post. Every reply. Everything I’d written.

They tried to act concerned. Professional. Like they were talking to someone who’d just gone through a hard time. They used words like *trauma* and *support* and *mental health resources.* But the way they looked at me—like I was something fragile, something already cracked—they didn’t believe a word I said. Not really. They think I’m losing it. That I made it all up. That I’m spiraling into some delusion where something is wearing my son’s skin and pretending to be him.

I didn’t argue. I didn’t defend myself. What was I supposed to say? 

After the meeting, my manager pulled me aside. Just her, in the hallway. She’s a single mom too. Our sons are in the same playgroup. I thought maybe—maybe she’d understand.

She said she cared. Said I needed rest. Said Reddit wasn’t helping, that people were “feeding into it.” That I needed to let this go. That it wasn’t healthy.

That’s when I knew.

She didn’t believe me either.

Maybe Fred was crazy. Maybe I am too. But every time I try to convince myself none of this is real, I hear those soft, shaky sobs from the living room. I see those eyes that don’t belong to my boy. And I know.

Something is wrong. Deeply wrong.

So now it’s just me.

Me, my not-son, and this thing in my house that looks like him. Everyone thinks I’m crazy. I’m taking a mandatory paid leave from work and I’m sure CPS is on its way.

What do I have to lose?
