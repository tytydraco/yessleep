  
A long exhausting day at work tired me a lot, i needed something to calm be down, the long drive home im constantly thinking about how im going to roll asap. I was almost home and an incoming call came up \*Dahlia\*. My wife is calling me, I answer \*hey baby\* i say. \*Please tell me you're almost home I have a big surprise for you\* she says nervously I ask what it is, knowing she's not going to tell me. \*It's a surprise for a reason stupid\* she said very sarcastically. I tell her ill be home in 15 minutes and i tell her I love her and hang up.  
  
  
  
I pull into the driveway, say hi to the neighbor and his dog and proceeded inside. Instantly I smell something, \*Lavender\* I say \*Vanilla Lavender\* says my wife. \*hey hun, what was the surprise?\* I ask eagerly. She signals me with her pointer finger to come to her. So I do, I was never prepared for what would happen next, I walk into our room and I see an envelope, I thought it was weird scheme for us to get into a little dirty time. But I couldn't of been more wrong, I open the envelope and see a test, a pregnancy test. I look her and shes giggling, I instantly think \*is this it? is this finally the time?\* I see the two lines on it and look at her, her joyous tears start to run down her face and I can see how happy she is. It makes me happy,  
  
  
  
I begin to smile and look her in her eyes, \*this is amazing baby!\* I shout. She jumps into my arms and tells me how happy she is. I tell her we should celebrate, she agrees. We both hurry into the car, \*i'm not even out of my work clothes\* I say with a dirt stained shirt. \*She laughs it off and says \*I don't care im so happy and I love you so much\* \* I love you too sweet girl\* I say as we pull into the gas station parking lot. \*I'll be back im going to get us some raw papers\* I say as I walk away from the car. \* Get me a monster\* she yells I roll my eyes sarcastically  
  
  
  
I check out, ask for raw papers and of course my babys monster energy. As i'm heading back to the car I see a women sitting on the side of the gas station wall sitting Indian style. \*You alright?\* I say loudly. She looks up and has a pale face, low eyes, crusted lips and massive eye bags. \*That's creepy I say to myself\*. She stares at me for a good 30 seconds before I say again \*Are you alright\*. She continues to give me this deathly, almost threatening stare as I walk back to the car. \*Who's your girlfriend my wife?\* my wife says sarcastically. "I don't know but shes really creepy" I say. "I know I saw her face too" Dahlia replies. We start to pull out our parking spot and drive home. At this point its sunset and its starting to get dark.  
  
  
  
It's a 10 minute drive back home so their is a lot of houses on the way back. As im driving and talking to my wife I see a family outside playing in the yard instanly thinking \*I can't for that to be us\*. But I notice something super weird about this family, all of them had weird eyes. They were pitch black. An endless void of darkness. I thought I was just tripping out or seeing things. I was so incredibly wrong. My wife didn't notice and I didn't want to freak her out because she gets scared easily. We get home, smoke, and go to sleep so excited for us to finally have a kid on the way.  
  
  
  
A few days passes and I forgot all about the girl and the family with black eyes completely. I find myself on the way home from work again as I do every day, I pass by the same house and see the same family playing again. They were normal this time, but I notice in window on the second floor a girl, the same girl from the gas station standing and staring at me as I drive by. I almost run off the road as I was looking at the same girl. Maybe they were family I thought, but what didnt make sense was that the gas station was about a mile from this house. "What was she doing at that gas station by herself when her family lives right here" I thought to myself. I ignored it and went on with my day.  
  
  
  
I got home and me and my wife went shopping for baby stuff even though it was so far away. She loved to be prepared. I forgot about the girl completely until 2 days ago. It had been 8 months since I saw the girl in the window. We were preparing to get my wife into the hospital because she was expected to go into early labor. It was a boy, I was so happy for a boy, she wanted a girl so bad but didn't mind a boy at the same time. I stayed with her in the hospital for 2 days until I had to go back to work, I wish I knew that was going to be the last time I saw my wife.  
  
  
  
I finished work and immediately went to the hospital, it was the same way the house was so I had to drive by it. I drove by and saw the whole family including the girl standing all next to each other in a line staring at me as I drove by. I immediately sped up remembering the girl and the family from several months ago. In that moment, my car slowed down and stopped working all together. Right in front of the house next door. I was scared.  
  
  
  
I got out of the car and was looking for a car to pass by so I could get a jump. But it was pitch black all of a sudden. No lights, no cars, no people besides the family in the front yard, but this time their eyes were different. They were bright white and they were glowing. I was to scared to look at them but I could feel their eyes on me. I frantically pull out my phone and call my wife. It picks up. I then realize shes in labor and doesnt have her phone, I do.  
  
  
  
So who answered? The phone is in my car. I look up and see a pair of white glowing eyes, sitting in my backseat. I put the phone to my ear nervous to see what was going to happen. "The baby is mine". Instantly the panic sets in. What do they want with me kid, why me, what is happening. The call hangs up and 4 pairs of white eyes drive off in my car. What?? I think to myself "How did the car start, my wife, I need to get to the hospital now. As the car drives off Im met face to face with the girl from the gas station. Her mouth wide open, staring at me. I can feel her breath thats how close we are. Keep in mind I always am carrying a weapon. I back up draw my gun and shoot. Shes gone.  
  
  
  
The girl is gone. I immediatlly start running towards the hospital hoping shes still alive. Its still pitch black out and I cant see a thing. After running for what seems like forever I see the hospital. I run inside to the front desk asking the lady what room my wife is in. The lady turns around and it's the mother from the family that took my car. Her eyes are that same pitch black. I bolt it to the last room she was in screaming her name \*DAHLIA... DAHLIA WHERE ARE YOU\*. I hear a scream, my wifes screen, their is bodys all bloody and dead all over the hospital. Im to worried about my wife to think. I find the source of the scream. Its my wife. Dead. On the hospital bed and no longer pregnant.  
  
  
  
"she gave birth" I said to myself. I lay there looking at my wifes lifeless body screaming in agony. \*WHY.. WHY ME\*. I hear a child crying. Could it be my child? I run to the noise and see it. The whole family with pitch black eyes standing under the flickering light holding a newborn baby. I look at the baby, his eyes, they're white. A second passes and I realize, there is no hope. So i make a run for it as fast as I can out the hospital. I see my car and start it and speed off as fast as the car could go.  
  
  
  
I took one look back to see the family standing in front of the hospital with white eyes, with a new addition, my son, looking at me with white eyes. I made a stupid decision deciding to not call police and just run to the hospital. I drive to the next town looking for help. I see a group of people walking in unison, I beg to use there phones and as I got closer I could see it, they had white eyes.
