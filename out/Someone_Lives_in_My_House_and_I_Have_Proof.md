I’m Jack, and I want to tell the story of when I discovered that someone is living hidden in our house.  
I know it sounds pretty surreal, but listen carefully because this story is worth it.

It was a very normal Monday, another week just as monotonous as the last. Coming home from school, eating, studying, showering, and going to bed. That’s how my days went, but I can’t really complain—I’ve gotten used to being bored. Maybe it sounds sad to say that you have a boring life, but this was what led me to discover that every night, someone roams around my house, and I still don’t know why. That’s why I need help.

It was midnight—not really that late, considering I usually stay up scrolling through videos like most teenagers.  
But last night was different. I wanted to take a dopamine detox. I decided not to use my phone late at night because I had heard it affected sleep, and even though it was almost 1 a.m., I still couldn’t sleep. So I decided that my pastime at that moment would be looking at childhood photos. I went to the living room, opened the drawer of a cabinet where we keep photo albums, and that’s when I saw the camera. The damn camera.

My dad used to take it with us when we traveled. I decided to turn it on to check out some recent trip photos. But I saw something really strange. It said that photos had been taken the night before. My curiosity got the best of me, and I clicked on the first picture. It was really blurry. I moved to the next one, and I could make out my living room, the very place I was standing in at that moment. They were pictures taken with flash in the dark. I kept scrolling, and as I reviewed them, it felt like a tour of my house. Even though the pictures were badly taken—shaky and barely distinguishable—I recognized them instantly because they were photos of my own home. The pictures continued through the hallway, moving toward my bedroom door. That’s where they stopped.

I was pretty freaked out, so I ran to my room. I guess I felt safer there. After what I had seen, I wanted to wake up my parents and ask them about the pictures. But in the end, they were just badly taken photos. Maybe my mom had taken them by accident while cleaning, though doing that late at night seemed odd. I convinced myself they were just accidental photos taken by one of my parents and decided to sleep since I had to wake up early the next day. I had an early meeting with my teacher before classes.

The next day, after school, I came home and, as usual—ate, studied, showered, and went to bed. The same vicious cycle I can’t escape from. That night, I remembered the camera. I thought about whether I should check the pictures again because it had been such a strange thing, and I needed to understand it. I know it’s very convenient to check it again at night, but that’s when I remembered it, and I wanted to satisfy my curiosity.

I rushed to the living room, straight to the album drawer. The camera was there. I grabbed it and took it to my room to examine the pictures calmly. I clicked to open the gallery, and there they were. I went through them again carefully. Nothing really new stood out. I was about to turn off the camera when something clicked in my head, and something inside me told me to check the video gallery. What I saw left me breathless.

There was a video recorded the night before—the same night I discovered those photos. I thought maybe I had accidentally recorded it while fiddling with the camera, but when I played it, I wanted to smash the camera against the wall.

The video started in the living room. It was completely dark, though you could see a little thanks to the weak flash from the camera. The person holding the camera moved forward until they reached the hallway and continued to the door at the end—my bedroom door. That’s when I realized this person was using the camera’s flash to navigate my house easily. That explained the blurry pictures I had found.

The video continued. The person opened my bedroom door, and I saw myself sleeping in my bed. My skin crawled. The person started covering the camera with their hand—I understood they didn’t want to wake me up with the flash.

Before watching any more, I wanted to run to my parents’ room to tell them what I had seen. But thank God, before doing that, I kept watching.

The camera then pointed at my desk, and the person started going through my things, revealing some intimate photos of me with my teacher. I had carelessly left them on the desk because, in my mind, it never occurred to me that a stranger would come in and casually stumble upon them.

Then, the camera pointed back at me, and I saw my arm start to move. That’s when the video ended.

Don’t judge me, and I don’t want to shift the focus of this story to my romance with my teacher. It’s something we’ve kept secret, mainly because of the age difference, and of course, my parents can’t know about it. That’s why I haven’t told them everything about what happened with the camera and why I’ve decided not to take legal action—because they’d find out that, from time to time, I sleep with my teacher.

But what disturbs me the most is the idea that a stranger roams my house every night, and I don’t know with what purpose.
