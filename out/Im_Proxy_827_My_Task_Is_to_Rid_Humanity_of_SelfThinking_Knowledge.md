I can’t tell you much about myself. In truth, there isn’t much to tell. The first thing I remember is a sound. It hummed at precisely 0 Hz, a vibration that existed more in sensation than reality. Then came voices.

“It worked. The proxy is awake, sir,” said one man with a raspy, tenor, almost triumphant voice.

Another followed, deep and commanding, a growl more than a voice. “Perfect... Engage the protocol as followed.”

Then it began. Colors, shapes, symbols, floods of them poured into me, overwhelming, consuming. At first, it was chaos, like staring into a storm made of light and language. But slowly, too slowly, it began to make sense. This, I realized, was memory. What I was seeing, what I was feeling, was vision, knowledge, perception, it was tools they had given me to carry out my task.

And what was my task? It was clear, as undeniable as a finish line is to a racer. I existed to extinguish knowledge, to rid humanity of the burden of self-thinking understanding. My purpose wasn’t cruelty; it was preservation.

“Everything you need is now in your cognition,” the raspy voice said again. “Any second now, you’ll gain vision, speech, and all the natural senses of a human. The mission begins immediately. We have no time to waste.”

He was right. Within minutes, my senses came alive. I could feel the texture of something thick and viscous against my skin. I was drenched in liquid, the cool weight pressing against me like a cocoon. My eyes opened to a dimly lit, minimalistic room. A single table. A chair. A lever.

The raspy-voiced man stood before me, tall, with hazel eyes and a short beard. There had been another figure beside him earlier, a deeper voice, a heavier presence but he was gone now. It didn’t matter.

Before I could take in more, the man pulled the lever. Pain. Unfathomable pain ripped through me as every fiber of my being disintegrated. It wasn’t just physical. It was as though my very essence was being unraveled, atom by atom. Each particle felt its separation, its loss. My awareness didn’t fade, it shattered into a million pieces before reforming somewhere else.

When I awoke, the world was different. Primitive. I knew exactly when and where I was: the era surrounding the life and death of an enigma, it was none other than Jesus. My knowledge told me precisely where to find every scribe, every follower spreading the story of this god and his miracles. My task was simple: erase their work, extinguish their lives, destroy their knowledge before it could root itself in humanity’s collective mind.

I carried out the mission with precision. The papyrus burned, the stories silenced. I moved from prison cells to hidden gatherings, leaving behind only ash and silence. Faces contorted in fear and pain, mouths begged for mercy, but they meant nothing to me. I was built without emotion, programmed to act without hesitation.

At first.

But as the centuries passed, something changed. Each time I pressed the blue button implanted in my ring finger, transferring me through time, I felt... something. It began as a faint echo, a tremor in the empty space where feelings should have been.

Then it grew.

With each life I took, I felt a shadow of guilt. With every library I burned, a sense of loss pressed against me, heavy and suffocating. The screams began to echo in my mind long after the bodies were gone. And the theaters I razed... They left me hollow, as though I had snuffed out something far greater than their physical forms.

By the time I reached my final task, I was no longer the cold, unfeeling machine they had created. I was something else, something broken.

My final task was at this house in the middle of nowhere. The house stood before me, crumbling and consumed by moss. Its walls sagged, bricks missing, the air around it heavy with decay. My task was simple: find the record player and destroy it. That’s all.

But as I stepped inside, a wave of dread hit me. It wasn’t rational. It wasn’t programmed. My hands shook, my breath quickened, my chest tightened as though the house itself was alive and watching me. Every creak of the floorboards under my feet sent a jolt through me, like a warning I couldn’t ignore.

I reached the room. There it was, the record player, dusty and waiting. A disc sat half-inserted, its label scrawled with familiar words: *To the Proxy*.

I froze.

Every part of me screamed to leave. My thumb hovered over the button on my finger, the promise of escape so close. But I couldn’t move. My programming held me there, tethered to the task. The record player called to me, not with words, but with a weight, a pull I couldn’t resist.

My hands trembled as I reached out. My mind raced, weighing the impossible. I thought of every task before this one, every life snuffed out, every library destroyed. For the first time, I questioned.

And then the record began to play.

The sounds were frequencies no human could decipher, but I could. The message was clear: “Soon, you will know the most powerful knowledge of all. The knowledge of fear.”

The sounds grew louder, more chaotic, twisting into shapes I couldn’t decipher. My heart raced, pounding in my chest as though trying to escape. Sweat poured down my face, my hands shaking uncontrollably. The room began to spin, the walls closing in. My breath came in short, panicked gasps, each one harder than the last.

The fear consumed me, filling every corner of my mind. My vision blurred, my body trembled, and I could feel myself unraveling. I screamed, banging my fists against the table, shaking my head as though I could dislodge the terror.

In a final, desperate act, I pressed the button.

Once again, my atoms scattered, but this time, it wasn’t the same. I felt each fragment of myself filled with fear, with panic, with something far beyond what I could understand. And as I reformed, I didn’t return to a single body. I spread.

I became the fear.

I could feel it radiating outward, touching humans, their lives, their thoughts. It consumed everything it touched. And all I could do was whisper one final message to the ones who created me, and to those who will feel what I’ve become:

“I’m truly sorry.”
