  found an old cult by working on the bodies that they left in their wake.

I never thought my fascination with the human body would lead me down such a twisted path. As a mortician in the heart of the city, I had encountered all sorts of bizarre cases – people decapitated, shot, even objects inside of people that did them in, so to speak – but nothing had prepared me for this.

It was a cold, drizzly day when the body arrived. A pale woman in her early thirties, no signs of foul play, death attributed to natural causes. She was just another lifeless vessel, and I set to work, as I always did. But as I started the embalming process, I noticed something odd – a series of intricate etchings on her left shoulder. The markings were faint, as if they had been deliberately obscured, but they were undeniably there.

Curiosity piqued, I snapped a picture of the etchings and continued my work. Once the woman was properly prepared, I couldn't shake the feeling that I needed to know more about those symbols. I decided to do some research on my own time, scouring ancient texts and obscure internet forums for answers.

Eventually, I stumbled upon a reference to an old druid cult that was established early in the history of the United States. This group believed in the power of nature, the sanctity of life, and the necessity of human sacrifice to maintain the balance between the two. According to legend, they etched their sacred symbols onto the bodies of their victims, marking them for eternity.

My heart raced as I realized the implications of my discovery. Had I stumbled upon evidence of a long-lost cult? Or was there more to this story than I could even begin to comprehend?

In the following weeks, more bodies arrived at the morgue, most normal but one bore the same eerie etchings. A young man, looking well-groomed. Definitely signs of struggle and such.

I decided to trace the symbols on the body, this time they were very well hidden but more intricate and more “perfect,” almost picture-perfect like in the book. I felt an overwhelming sense of dread. It was clear that the cult was not only still active but also operating right under our noses in the city. The question that plagued me was why did these and other bodies appear now, and what purpose did they serve?

As the weeks turned into months, I became obsessed with the cult and their practices. I scoured every resource I could find, from historical accounts to modern-day conspiracy theories, hoping to uncover anything else I could. I even went so far as to visit the locations where the bodies were found, trying to piece together the puzzle, which sounds creepy, I know.

There seemed to be no rhyme or reason to where the bodies were found, but also as to who the victims were. There was no pattern, "old" or "young," male or female, rich or poor; it didn't matter. I couldn't readily tell from the information I had if the markings were meant to summon something, keep something alive, or whatever else. That is until I heard that ungodly pang from the morgue room.

I thought to myself, maybe it was some instrument that I left on a table or something that fell. Typically trays will make a panging type of noise when they fall. This... this was not that. It was a loud pang like something heavy hit hollow metal or just metal.

I heard it again, louder. Then once more. There was no rhythm or anything to it. But it was loud. I decided, against all conventional wisdom, to go check it out. I mean, it was just my morgue room.

I burst through the double doors, sweat pouring down my spine – the kind of sweat that you have after a chilling nightmare. Why was I so damn nervous?

What I saw shook me to the core. The morgue "drawer" – that big wall where we store bodies, you've seen them in movies – had a door open with the body tray fully out. These cabinets have handles that only open from the outside. There is no way for something to come out unless an immense amount of force – I'm talking freight train force, at least I think – would have pushed it.

I was paralyzed in fear. Was somebody pranking me? But then I heard the sound. It's that very common sound that joints make when you wake up in the morning and stretch or when you get up from a chair and feel your knee/ankle "pop," except this was a concert of those. Loud as a bat crack.

The sound came from behind me. As if whatever or whoever was there was waiting for me to barge in and was just perched next to the doors.

I turned around in a panic.

There "he" was – the man that had just arrived. Standing. Staring right at me with eyes that shone like amber lights.

The skin was as pale as it was when he came in but different somehow. The veins and arteries were blackened but raised so they looked like a "spider web" of sorts.

I was mesmerized in horror for less than a second when it/he shuffled towards me, arm outstretched as if to reach me. At that point, I somehow gathered the strength and composure to physically push past this "zombie" – for lack of a better word – and ran the hell out of there.

Luckily, or maybe due to a preparedness mindset, I had my keys on me. I did not bother to lock anything; I just went straight to my car and drove. I couldn't drive to the cops or anything because I doubted they dealt in "zombies," so I just drove home.

I couldn't sleep, but I also couldn't go back for fear of that thing being there.

Morning came, and I got a call urging me to come down to the morgue. Against my better judgment, but perhaps out of curiosity, I drove there. The coroner and another person were there, noticeably angry at me for leaving without locking the morgue and damaging equipment.

How was I going to explain this? They were not going to believe me.

The cameras! Of course, this had to be on video. Not only would my name be cleared, but they would also see what I saw.

The tape played. We heard the first pang. Then black. Erased.

I was let go that day. Understandable. I was lucky they decided not to report me or press charges.

I had to leave the city to find work. But also, I had to leave as far away as possible from whatever the hell was going on there.

So I drove, and drove until I couldn't anymore. I settled in the middle of nowhere. I still couldn't shake what I saw.

It had been months since it happened, but I couldn't forget it. I had since thrown away all of the cult's information and research I had done. I wanted to place as much physical and mental distance as I could.

I got a job again. I always feared finding the symbols again. I was always afraid of hearing that panging or that dreadful joint noise. However, they never came.

Last night, I had just finished with a body. I stepped out to go to the restroom. I shut everything off for the night.

In the stillness of the morgue, two amber lights shone on...
