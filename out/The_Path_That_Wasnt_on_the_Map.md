I consider myself an experienced hiker. I’ve spent years exploring the national parks and the dense forests that border our state. I know how to read a compass, how to track the sun, and how to stay calm when the fog rolls in. But three days ago, I learned that nature doesn't always play by the rules we’ve written for it.

I had decided to take a solo trip to a remote valley to photograph the autumn leaves. I parked my car at the end of a gravel road and set off on a well-marked trail. My plan was simple: hike four miles in, set up camp near a stream, and head back the next morning.

The trouble started when I reached the clearing where the stream was supposed to be. The water was gone. Not just dried up, but replaced by a deep, perfectly circular trench filled with white, chalky dust. I checked my map, but the landmarks didn't match. The mountain to my left was too high, and the trees were no longer oaks—they were tall, grey trunks with needle-like leaves that whistled in the wind.

I decided to turn back, but the trail I had just walked had vanished. In its place was a wall of thorns so thick that even a lumberjack would have struggled to clear it.

I wasn't just lost. I was in a place that didn't want to let me go.

As the sun began to set, the temperature dropped rapidly. I found a small cave at the base of a cliff and decided to hole up for the night. I started a small fire using some dry brush, but the smoke didn't rise. It settled on the ground like a heavy, grey liquid, flowing out of the cave and toward the forest.

Then I heard the voices.

It sounded like a crowd of people talking at a party. I heard a woman laughing, a child shouting about a game, and a man discussing the weather. It was the sound of a busy city square, but I was in the middle of a desolate wilderness.

"Is anyone there?" I shouted, grabbing my hunting knife.

The voices stopped instantly. The silence that followed was so absolute it made my ears ring. Then, a single voice answered from the darkness just outside the light of my fire. It was my mother’s voice.

"You’re late for dinner," the voice said. It was her exact tone, her exact inflection. But my mother had passed away in a hospital three years ago.

"Who are you?" I screamed, my knuckles turning white around the handle of the knife.

A figure stepped into the flickering light. It wasn't a person. It was a collection of sticks, rotted leaves, and grey mud, molded into the shape of a woman. It didn't have a face—just a flat surface of wet clay. But when it spoke, the sound came from deep inside its chest.

"I’m the one who remembers your name," the thing said. "The others have forgotten. The ranger, the search party, even your brother. They think you fell into the ravine. They’ve already stopped looking."

I didn't wait to hear more. I grabbed my backpack and sprinted into the dark forest. I didn't care about the thorns or the lack of a path. I ran until my lungs felt like they were filled with broken glass.

I eventually stumbled onto a dirt track that looked familiar. I followed it for miles until I saw the headlights of a truck parked near a bridge. I ran toward it, waving my arms and crying for help.

The driver stepped out. He was an older man in a flannel shirt. He looked at me with a mixture of pity and confusion.

"You okay, son?" he asked. "You look like you've seen a ghost."

"I got lost," I sobbed. "In the forest near the valley. I’ve been out there for three days."

The man frowned and checked his watch. "Son, that valley was cleared for a housing development ten years ago. There hasn't been a forest there since I was a boy."

I looked back at the way I had come. The trees were gone. In their place was a vast, empty construction site filled with concrete foundations and piles of gravel.

I reached into my pocket and felt something cold. I pulled it out. It was a small, hand-carved wooden heart. On the back, written in the chalky white dust I had seen in the trench, was my name.

I’m home now, in my apartment, but I don't feel safe. Every time I close my eyes, I hear the whistling of those needle-like leaves. And this morning, I found a pile of grey mud on my welcome mat.

I think I’m still lost. And I think the forest is coming to collect the rest of me.
