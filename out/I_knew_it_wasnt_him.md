This all started when my friend Greg went missing in 2022 at Mount Rainer. My friend Greg and I liked hiking in different national parks, I liked it but Greig loved it. One day, Greg told me he wanted to hike at Mount Rainer National Park. I have seen people say how beautiful the park is, and wanting to experience this, I said yes.  We made it there early breathing in the crisp, cold, mountain air that helped my brain wake up.

We got inside the park and continued on our adventure but before we went up Greg wanted to make this hike into a race. We made it pretty deep in the trail when I got tired I told Greg to go on without me in a sarcastic tone and that I would catch up to him. Being pumped up and cocky he said that I wouldn't be able to catch up to him because he would already be done. I brushed it off saying "Yeah, yeah, whatever". He hmphed and sped off, and went out of view, and a few minutes later after I caught my breath I went on my merry way.

A few hours later I realized how empty the park was and how I hadn't seen Greg either, he was athletic but not to the point that he could run this long without catching his breath a few times. I soon made it to the end it was sundown and looked around and no sign of him, I thought it was weird but didn't think much of it maybe he was in our RV.

I checked and he wasn't there either, so I started getting scared because Greg would never play a joke on me like this. I asked the workers if they had seen Greg and they said no. The workers then called some park rangers to check the area. I told Greg's family and they were all shocked which made sense. I drove to a hotel and stayed for a few days, wanting to stay close to the park just in case they needed me, I was near the park. They took me in for questioning and I answered truthfully they then let me go. 2 years later I decided to go back to Mount Rainer, still not at peace after what happened. 

I was scared of the park so coming back was a way of facing my fears, I hopped in the RV we used to drive and went to the park. When I got there I had a weird feeling in my stomach that wouldn't let me go. I walked to the entrance, and the cold air that felt so familiar was back, waking up my brain like how it did 2 years ago. I did the same trail and I just admired the sights because I was so focused on winning that I didn't see the beauty. It was getting late and I hurried up I was at the last stretch when I heard Greg's voice in a distorted tone saying "Hey buddy haven't seen you in a while" I was shocked, still as a rock. I turned around, crying because I hadn't heard his voice in 2 years. But all I saw was the dark empty void of trees. Greg's voice behind some bushes told me "Come over here and see me, I know you want to"

The more "Greg" talked the more I knew it wasn't him but I couldn't stop crying because it was him but I knew it wasn't. I told "Greg" that I didn't want to. The "Greg's" voice got more distorted and angry to the point that it didn't even sound like him. Then it said "Then I'm coming to you" I saw something jump out of the bushes and I BOOKED IT and didn't look back. I made it out of the park cold sweat dripping down my face while I gasped for air. I got back into the RV and left. I didn't tell Greg's family about this event because I didn't want to scare them and we didn't talk much and I knew they wouldn't believe me.
