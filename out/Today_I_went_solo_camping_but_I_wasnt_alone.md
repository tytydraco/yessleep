It might’ve been the peak of stupidity, but there I was again listening to those horror stories. I was twelve and had just discovered the endless supply of horror. It was the same routine every day, waking up, listening to people read these stories, and then not being able to sleep at night. Now that I’m older, I find it humorous, the way I’d regret it at night and then be filled with excitement during the day. That’s just who I was. 

I had loved the idea of cryptids and skinwalkers roaming in the thick woods and deep in mountain caves, but as I grew older, and my rational thinking overtook my naïveté, those thoughts became just that, thoughts. It may come as a surprise, but I don’t believe in the supernatural. 

With the digitalization of the world, how could there not be video evidence of the supernatural. Sure there are videos out there, some easier debunked than others, that claim to have definitive proof of the supernatural. I never found a video convincing and as I studied CGI and SFX, well a video could no longer cut it for me. I had to experience it. 

I guess that's what pushed me into solo camping in the first place. To experience something first hand would change my entire life and way of thinking. It’d go beyond my thought that all we were here for is to be, just as a leaf blows in the wind. 

But let me reiterate, this story I’m about to tell isn’t about the supernatural. No, it’s about a horror that’s scarier than any ghoul, ghost, or cryptid. It’s about a horror that’s known to be true. A horror that can only be produced by one thing, another human. 



At the tail end of my last year in college, I had finally decided what I wanted to do with my life. I moved to Lexington, Kentucky, while continuing my studies of CGI and Special effects. I’m from New York, and found that Lexington provided the perfect balance of city life and space to keep me happy. On Friday nights I’d go out on the town and Saturday nights, I’d choose to spend it out in the wilderness. 

The Appalachian mountains were, not accounting for the two-hour drive, practically in my backyard. I was no stranger to what stories and legends the Appalachian Trail’s held and the countless warnings against solo camping. Still, many did it, and many returned, disappointed that their hopes of an unexplainable occurrence were crushed. Nothing ever happened, but yet the reputation of the trails grew darker, and darker

Naturally, if I wanted firsthand experience of something other worldly, this had to be the place to go. 

The first time I went camping, I went with two of my co-workers who were quickly becoming my best friends, Eric and Nate. 

“So, do you believe all the stories?” I asked. We had just gotten out of the city and were making our way deeper into forested areas. 

“Believe what?” Eric asked as he drove us along with Nate in the passenger's seat.

“The skinwalkers and the urban legends. You know, the ‘don’t be out past dark’ stuff.”

Eric and Nate looked at each other and then began laughing. 

“What’s so funny?” I asked while cracking a smile.

“Ah, nothing,” Nate sighed, “Just the longer you live here, the more you’ll get it.” 

“So, you don’t believe it?” 

Eric followed the curve of the road and up ahead, I could see trees becoming thicker. The seemingly ending fields had turned into mountains and small rocky cliffs. “I don’t believe in a lot of things, but I tell ya what, you will not see me out there alone. Especially not at night.” 

Nate scoffed. “There are only two things to be scared of, and the ain’t only from these woods.”

“Yeah?”

“Yeah.”

“Okay, if you’re so certain, then what are they?” Eric asked.

Just then I felt my ears pop. 

“Silence and darkness. If you’ve got those two things, suddenly you’re in a nightmare. Sit alone, in the dark, and in your silent bedroom. You’ll start thinking things that ain’t there.” Nate pointed to his temple. “Your mind is the most terrifying place you can be.” 



We pulled into a visitor center deep in the Smoky Mountains and began the hike to our campsite a couple of hours before noon. When asked where I’d like to camp, I told them the most reclusive and cut-off place we could go. Nate said he knew a spot, but that it would take a couple of hours of hiking. I said that was fine. 

Hiking can, for most people, be very fun. But there’s another side to hiking that isn’t known until you’ve actually experienced it. It’s grueling. There are bugs, and sweat, and hills, and sun, and if you aren’t wearing the proper shoes like Eric, there’s also blisters. 

Nate and I had a better time. Sure, there were moments where I felt each step before, but when I looked up and around at where I was, those steps seemed to fade. And then before I knew it, we were at our campsite. 

To call it a campsite was a massive understatement. It was more of an open field, nothing more, and nothing less. But it did offer one thing that was unique, there was a shelter a little over a mile away. 

After setting up our tent, we ventured to the shelter before it would be too dark. We were about halfway there, according to my estimation, when a sign on a tree caught my attention. 

Rusted and faded as can be, it read, “Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ.” Right underneath it were two tall stones sticking out from the ground. 

“Gravestones.” Eric said. He must’ve seen me staring.

I looked at Eric. “For what?”

Eric began walking past me and stopped, “I don’t know. But I’ve never seen a hidden burial ground this… hidden.” Then Eric continued walking. 

I hesitated for a moment, taking one last glance. The tree-broken light from the setting sun bathed the sign and stones in an orange glow. And suddenly, I had second guesses on staying the night. 

“You coming?” Eric yelled. 

That feeling disappeared. “Yeah.” And I left the rusted sign and stones behind. 



The shelter was pretty underwhelming. From what I’ve come to learn, shelters have a sort of negative connotation to them. The amount of bugs, mice, and snakes aren’t the only off-putting aspects of a shelter for hikers. Sometimes shelters can be filled with campers. And sleeping next to someone you don’t know in a secluded area is worse than any mouse or snake. 

But there is one thing about shelters that I didn’t know about until that night. There are shelter logs. For those who don’t know, some shelters have a notebook for hikers to write in. It’s Nate’s favorite part of hiking along the Appalachian mountains. 

He pulled the black notebook out from a ziplock bag. “You can find good stories in these things. It’s fun to see the changes from shelter to shelter.”

I asked what it was, and Nate explained it to me. We began from the beginning. Everything from sort dated logs to drawings. That was until Nate flipped to the last two pages. 

“Holy shit.” He said. 

Eric, who was taking pictures, was now intrigued. “What is it?”

Nate dropped the notebook, showing us what was inside.

There from top to bottom was the same phrase, “God help me.” 

It was written large and then small. Sometimes the ink was dark, and rips in the paper. Other times, the ink was thin, and almost faded.

“This is new writing.” Nate said. 

“Well, that’s a bit unsettling.” Eric nervously chuckled. 

I grabbed the notebook for a closer look. “Man, I don’t believe in God, but this is pretty creepy.”

Nate took the notebook from my hands and put it back in the ziplock bag, “Eh, probably just some kids fucking with everyone. We need to get back anyway, it’s getting too dark.” 

Nate was right, by the time we got back to camp, the sun had completed its daily rotation and plunged us into darkness. And after starting a fire, the night went by without any complications. We roasted hotdogs, burnt smores, told childhood stories, and eventually, tried our best to sleep. 

I think I was the last one to fall asleep. I remember thinking that night at just how vulnerable sleep truly is. All of our senses are briefly shut down and for those who are heavy sleepers, their muted senses don’t return until the body allows them too. I was a heavy sleeper and couldn’t hear those nighttime forest sounds. 

That night was normal. And so were the other couple times I went camping with those two. I had learned to appreciate the stiffness of the ground, the dirt, the bugs, and most importantly, the quiet noises at night. I don’t know if it was the overconfidence, or me being naive, but today, almost two months later, I returned, this time alone. 

Nate gave me the address and the trail map. This was all after I assured him that I wasn’t going alone. Before I left work that Friday afternoon, he got real quiet.

“You have to be careful.”

“Of course.” I said.

“No.” He looked at me more seriously than I’d ever seen him look, “I mean real careful.” 

“What do you mean?”

He sighed. “Last week I went camping just down the trail from where we all went. Most hikers hike the same direction, so logically, I checked the log from the next shelter in line. There was nothing.”

“Oh.” I said, “alright.”

“You don’t get it, man. There was nothing like what we saw. No ‘God save us’, no writing from the top to bottom, not even a mention of God.”

“Wait, so-”

“Bring your 9 mm.” He said while walking back towards his desk. “I know we told you not to bring it last time, but this time, I would.” 

And then Nate disappeared around the corner. 



The next day, I arrived at the visitor center around noon. With it being in the middle of summer, the sun would stay out for just a bit longer, and without Eric’s stops, I was in no rush. 

I made it to my campsite within five hours. It was exactly as I remembered it, a small open field hardly with enough room to fit more than a tent and campfire. The sun was still out, but it was late afternoon and nothing came quicker than nightfall. 

I settled in, and then I set out to find that shelter. After what Nate told me, the shelter log was the first thing on my mind. I had no idea where exactly it was. There were only two things I knew, one, the general direction and two, there would be a distinct landmark. And so I set off.

If I could find that graveyard, then I knew I was on the right track. I pushed through trees, and bushes and was too concerned with stepping in the right spots because the moment stopped and looked up, I saw it. That same rusted and faded sign. Only this time, the G in ‘God’ was faded almost completely off. I approached the tree and placed a lantern from my bag on one of the stones. I would be back here once night hits. 

As I imagined, the shelter wasn’t hard to get to after finding the hidden grave site. It was in the same state of underwhelmingness as before. I wouldn’t imagine a hiker staying in this. 

This time, I noticed something carved into one of the logs. It was tally marks, and after counting, I determined there were 57 tallies. And that’s when I grabbed the shelter log. This time though, the notebook was significantly lighter than last time. In fact, there were only a couple sheets of paper in it. 

I opened it to see the same “God save us” messages. And then I saw that all the other pages of logs were ripped out. The next page was different, only slightly. This time, “God save me” was written from top to bottom. I kept flipping the pages until I read what sent chills down my spine. “Your God can’t save me.”

For the previous pages, the handwriting was scribbled, hard to read, and ugly. This time, the handwriting was clean, like it had come from a typewriter or printer. 

I flipped the page, “Immerse your soul before your God fails you, yet again.”

I flipped to the last page, “He’s awoke.”

There was something very wrong. These weren’t preachings of religion. And if the messages weren’t enough, the ink on the last page looked… wet.

The messages on the last page were just written. 



I suddenly felt as though someone had been watching me. I threw the log down and looked through the trees. It was all nothing but silence. From what I could see, there was no one near me, no one watching me, but I knew I had to get away from that shelter. 

I hiked, hiked away from that place and kept looking behind. My nerves didn’t calm until I had made it to the hidden grave site. To do what I had planned, it needed to be nighttime. I tied a string to a nearby tree and then made my way back to my campsite.

There, I made dinner and when it was too dark to see more than 20 feet in front of you, I grabbed my 9 mm, and followed the string. 

With a flashlight you can hardly see in the dark. Sure it helps, but it only illuminates the things nearest to you. What a flashlight in the dark does more effectively is let anything else see you. I was thinking about that at the time.

Before long, I was back at the grave site. I kneeled before the stones and opened my bag. There, I took out an EMF reader. I had read that this would help me communicate with spirits. And where else would be a better spot than to ghost hunt by a hidden grave site, at night, alone, and in the middle of the woods. 

I turned off my light, but before I could turn on the EMF reader, I heard it. 

“I see you!”

It was a high-pitched, playful voice, like a man trying to intimidate a child. 

My heart dropped and beat out of my chest all at once. Regret instantly filled my blood. I had to be anywhere else but here. 

I didn’t respond, and put my hands over the flashlight. Then I turned the flashlight on. 

With my hands letting out a small amount of light, I grabbed onto the string and tiptoed through the leaves. Every second, I prayed I wouldn’t hear another voice or more leaves rustling, other than my own. Even when I saw my campfire, I didn’t feel any relief. I was a 5-hour hike away from my car, and at night, the hike would take much longer. 

I had no other thing to do but stay the night. 

There was nothing interesting for me to stay awake. I poured water on the fire and then climbed into my tent. I brought everything inside my tent, including my 9 mm. 

In the middle of the woods, and without the snoring of your camping buddies, every sound is amplified and imagined into something that it's not. 

The small breeze of a wind can cause sticks to fall, sounding like heavy footsteps. The nightly routine of a raccoon can sound like a person walking up to your tent. The howling of a coyote can sound like demented screams of a lost hiker. Owl screeches, crickets chirping, cicadas buzzing, all of these can play tricks on your mind. Nate was right, your mind can turn nothing into something horrid. 

This would already be true, but with the pressing concern that I was not alone out here. It wasn’t the noises that got to me, it was the anticipation of a noise. Sitting in silence, hoping that you don’t hear something, is almost worse than actually hearing it. 

And that’s the state I laid in for an hour. 

Holding my 9 mm, and paranoid, I rested my head against my pillow, praying that I’d make it through. My eyes became heavy, my breathing slowed, my senses started going out starting with my smell and thankfully, my hearing was last to go out. Because just then, I heard the faintest laugh. 

My eyes shot open and adrenaline took the place of melatonin.  

I gripped the 9 mm and felt my heartbeat through my fingers.

“Help me.” 

This time the voice was much louder, and closer, but once again sounded high pitch. I didn’t get a chance to think or respond because just then, I heard someone running straight towards me. Leaves and branches flew through the forest as this man flew towards me. 

“Get the fuck back! I have a gun!” I yelled while raising the gun to the tent door. 

The man stopped running. For a moment there was a pained silence while I began to feel tears fall down my eyes. 

“I want to see you again.” 

Then I shot my gun. 

I hadn’t actually shot my gun without ear protection on. I always heard that gunshots were loud, and I was prepared for it. Or at least I thought I was. A gunshot is louder than you’d imagine. My ears started ringing, and I couldn’t tell whether the man left or stayed. 

I couldn’t move. I laid there pointing the gun at the zipper until my body gave out. Eventually, I fell asleep and woke at sunrise. 



I don’t imagine I need to oversell how relieved I was once I had woken up. But I can’t begin to describe the despair I felt when I slid open the zipper to the tent. There on the ground in front of me was the head of a bunny. Nothing else but the head. 

I screamed then in horror. Being a heavy sleeper didn’t just mean I tuned out Eric and Nate's snoring. It tuned out everything. 

After grabbing my backpack and leaving my tent behind, I made the hike back, only putting away my 9 mm halfway down the mountain. I got home early in the afternoon. I began to unpack my bag, but there was something in it that wasn’t mine. 

It was the shelter log. 

That man was in my tent. He saw me sleeping. 

Besides my cards in my wallet being out of order, there was nothing else gone or added. It’s hard to remember the exact way your wallet is, but I always keep my debit first. Now, it was in the middle. 

With the knowledge of what it contained, I stared at the shelter log for what seemed like forever. Eventually, I couldn’t take it anymore. I had to open it. 

The first couple pages were the same religious scripture. What terror the first pages had, had nothing compared to the next. There was only one sentence on the next page. 

“I will see you again, Caleb.” 

And I started crying. I don’t know how he knew my name. 

Then it clicked. My cards in my wallet were out of order. He hadn’t just been inside my tent, he was also in my backpack. 

But that was hardly the worst of it, because if he had seen my ID, my name wasn’t the only thing on there. 

My address was too.
