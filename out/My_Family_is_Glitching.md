I was just a young child when it first happened. I remember it vividly, as though it was etched into my mind forever. It was a dark and stormy night, the kind that makes your skin crawl with anticipation. I lay in bed, tossing and turning, unable to find solace in sleep. That's when I heard it—a faint, unsettling noise, like a glitch in reality.

Curiosity got the better of me, and I slowly crept to my bedroom door. I hesitated for a moment, my hand trembling as I reached for the doorknob. With a creak, the door swung open, revealing a horrifying sight that I could never forget.

There, standing before me, was my family. But they were different. Their bodies glitched and flickered, as if they were trapped in a digital nightmare. Mom, Dad, and my baby sister all stood there, their eyes locked on me, their faces contorted into unsettling smiles that sent shivers down my spine.

I blinked, hoping that it was just a trick of my tired mind, but they remained unchanged. I couldn't tear my eyes away from their glitching forms, their movements jerky and unnatural. It was as if they were trapped in some glitched-out version of reality, a parallel world that had somehow merged with our own.

Fear consumed me, but curiosity drove me forward. I had to see if this horrifying vision was real. I stumbled out of my room and made my way to the bathroom, hoping to find some answers in the reflection of the mirror.

As I stood before the mirror, my heart pounded in my chest. I gazed at my own reflection, but it was not me staring back. Instead, a distorted version of myself grinned maniacally, black glitchy liquid oozing out of its mouth. I let out a blood-curdling scream, and the mirror shattered into a thousand pieces, glass flying in all directions.

From that day forward, I referred to this glitchy version of myself and my family as the "Family Void." They haunted my dreams, their glitchy forms always lurking in the back of my mind. I couldn't escape them.

A few years passed, and we decided to move out of that cursed house. We packed our belongings into the car and began our journey to a new life. As we drove away, I couldn't resist looking back one last time.

There they were, standing in the yard, watching us leave. Their glitchy forms smiled at me, black liquid dripping from their eyes and mouths. I shuddered, feeling an overwhelming sense of dread.

Who were they? Why did they look like me and my family? These questions tormented my thoughts, but the answers remained elusive. It was as if the glitch in reality had swallowed them whole, leaving behind only distorted replicas.

To this day, I wonder if they still exist, if they continue to haunt the lives of unsuspecting souls. And if they do, I pray that no one else will have to experience the terror of the Family Void, a glitch in reality that consumes everything in its path. Did anyone have stories like mine? Gone through the same thing? That saw… Them?
