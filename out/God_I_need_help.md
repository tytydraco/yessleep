I need to get some things off my chest.

Hey this is a throw away account because I really don't want people knowing I posted this
But I digress. (Fake names) So I male 20 now have had a few experiences that I can't personally explain. I'm posting here to see if people can educate me.

1. Let me set the Seen I was 5 and had just gotten back from my cousin's house.
it was I'd say 9-10 pm and I decided to go to bed in the gaming room.
Now the gaming room had two doors one that led into the kitchen and the other led to a large back porch.
Now I was laying on a couch Facing the door that led to the back porch.
So I fall asleep and awake at idk what time all the lights in the house were out except for a dim glow coming from the kitchen.
And slowly it got brighter and brighter until 12-40 little colour changing orbs enter the room and dance in the air.
It truly was the most beautiful thing I have ever seen I felt warm in the middle of winter.
And just as they entered they left out the porch door.
I have never seen anything like that since.

2. I was about 8 at the time and had just moved to a small town, big upgrade from the middle of jack shit nowhere and the third night of being there I got the most unsedaling feeling.
So I look out the bedroom window to see crouched down in our driveway a man fully back even though he was in direct light from the street.
And I blinked and he was gone.
The next few weeks everyone's in the house was on edge and the lights were turning on and off normal for a old house except the electrtion had been there the day before we moved in.
Then started the knocks at the door we'd go check it out and nothing about an hour later knocking again.
After that we started to hear footsteps from inside the roof... The fucking roof one way in one way out and it's 4-5 M high roof from ground level.
And then sleep Peraltalasis (sorry if I miss spell anything I'm tired as shit right now)lay out of my bedroom so I had a bunk bed with my younger brother and my third brother slept on a trundle that slid under the bunk when not in use.
The door when open stands against the foot of the bed.
So I awake until able to move and see nothing aside from the sult lamp in the corner of the room.
Second night nothing, Third night nothing... On the fourth night a pare of fingers grasp the edge of the door and on the fifth night I see it's second hand and an eye.
On the sixth night nothing but on the seventh night it head was hanging from the top bunk looking at me smiling it's eyes empty aside from two white dots in its eyes empty.
Safe to say I slept in my mother's for a while.

3. So me and my dad were watching tv in the loundgroom watching the hunger games and there is a wall between the loundgroom and the back door which also Leeds into the bathroom.
So my dad goes out for a smoke and I hear the old wooden door slam shut.
So about fifteen minutes pass and I see something tho my left peering from behind the counter smiling my dad teeth showing looking me in the eyes.
We look at each other waiting for the other to make a move.
I stand up and it visibly takes a step back.
And take another step and I hear it run so I think it's my dad so I go out the back to ask why he was being creepy and he says I'm seeing shit and he's been out there the whole time.
Normal I would think he was playing a prank but I never heard the door close or open and it's a loud door.

4. This made most of the strange events stop one day I was sick I was I'd say 10-11 at the time and my family had planned a day trip but I was to sick. 
So they left me home now this was just after Christmas and I had gotten a sult gun and I was laying in the loundgroom and I hear footsteps in the roof.
So I who had had enough sults every entrance to the house aside from the back door which I leave wide open.
I grab the "gun" and yell "get the fuck out of..." Before I can finish I hear yelling and a gust of wind leave out the back door
I slam it shut and sult it.
And that has stopped any odd events happen in my house for the 7 years until I moved out.
Now weird things happen outside but nothing ever entered the house again.

I'd appreciate advice or people's idea on what they were. Otherwise have a lovely night/day.
