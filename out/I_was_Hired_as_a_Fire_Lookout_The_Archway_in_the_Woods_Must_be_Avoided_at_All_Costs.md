My first week as a fire lookout stationed at Fire Tower 14 had started off okay.  All my life I’d wanted to be a park ranger, and now I was within one day of accomplishing that goal.  After this final day of training, I was to be left on my own.

But something catastrophic had [happened,](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11qdr8t/i_was_hired_as_a_fire_lookout_theres_something/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
derailing all of those plans.  

After seeing two separate fires burning in the distance, my supervisor and I had set off in our Jeep to check out what we assumed were campfires.  He had left me alone to investigate one group of offenders, while he approached the other campsite.  

Everything was going according to plan until I stumbled across a stone archway in the forest that looked very out of place.  On the other side the sky was purple, whereas on our side it was blue.  But I mistook that for the setting sun, or some other phenomena, and pressed onward, going through it.  

I wish I’d trusted my instincts, and stayed on the other side of the arch.  Because now I'm trapped in another world, with no way home.  The archway disappeared, leaving me stranded here.  And I quickly realized I wasn’t alone.  There were creatures in the forest that looked like people but were not.  They had an extra set of arms, for one thing, and they called back to you if you spoke, but they were not human.    

Despite all odds, I’d been rescued by another park ranger right before getting mauled by the bizarre creatures.  This man, who told me his name was David, said he had been trapped in this place for a month.  He had a cave which he managed to camouflage with tree branches, allowing us to hide from the creatures after escaping from them.  

David knew a lot about this place, and he said the creatures avoided a certain part of the forest - so that was where he took me.  He had set up traps, which only he knew the placement of, and his hideout was there, stocked with provisions.  

“A lot of the plant life here is the same as in our world,” he told me when we arrived back at his camp.  “I found a patch of shitake mushrooms and I’ve been surviving on those more or less.  I had a few things in my bag - an energy bar, some trail mix, y’know, the usual stuff - but I ran out of that pretty quickly.”

He showed me his little pile of foraged food and I marveled at how well prepared he was.  There were different species of mushrooms, some wild root vegetables, and some ruffage he’d set aside to make a salad with.     

“This is incredible,” I said.  “And I thought I was a good survivalist.”

“You’re still young,” he told me.  “I’ve been doing this sort of thing for a long time.  I was in the British Special Air Services when I was younger.  They’re highly trained soldiers - sort of like your Special Forces.  Since I got across the pond I’ve worked here and there, but most recently I’ve been the fire lookout at Tower 14 for almost ten years.”

I let out a soft gasp.  

“That’s where I’m stationed.  You worked at Tower 14?”

He chuckled.  

“Worked.  Past tense.  Damn.  Those bastards replaced me already, eh?  Well, I guess they must have given up looking for me too, then.”

I thought back to that odd look Ross had given me when letting me out of the Jeep.  He looked like he was going to say something, but maybe, “Don’t get killed or disappear like the last guy,” would have been too on the nose.

Maybe he’d been thinking about how this was a bad idea, I realized.  Maybe he was thinking we should go together.  But instead he’d let me go alone.  

I felt a twinge of anger, thinking about how none of this would have happened if Ross had been shadowing me like he was supposed to be.

“They’re still looking for you,” I said, not really knowing if that was true.  “I’m sure they are.  They wouldn’t just forget about you.  Ross didn’t get around to telling me yet, that’s all.  I’m still in training.”

I didn’t add that this was my last day of training.  Or that news of David's disappearance seemed to have been purposefully omitted from my orientation. 

David eyed me suspiciously, but didn’t say another word about it.  

“I was going out to look for more mushrooms when I spotted you.  It’s too dangerous to go out again tonight, but tomorrow we’ll check for the archway again and I’ll show you the shitake grove.  I go back to that same spot every day and look for that arch.  I can’t believe I missed it.”

He was peeling a mushroom with his knife as he spoke, but with that last sentence he hurled the blade across the room where it clanged against the rock wall, making a loud noise.  

“Quiet!” I whisper-yelled at him.  “I know you’re upset but we’re gonna get out of here.”

His face was emotionless as he looked back at me, tears welling up in his eyes.  

“That’s what I’ve been telling myself for the last thirty-six days,” he said.  “I hope to God you’re right.”

As I tried to fall asleep that night, I couldn’t.  The idea of a man like David being brought to tears by this place was almost too much to bear.  The man was a killing machine.  British Special Forces.  He had saved my life and pulled me out of a situation where I’d thought I would be dead for sure.  

At least we had more ammunition, now.  And two guns.  Still, that didn’t reassure me very much.  

Those creatures, whatever they were, did not like to die.  

*

I managed a few hours of off and on sleep before the sun came up, still appearing that same horrible shade of purple as it had the day prior.  It was starting to hurt my head.  It felt wrong just being in this place, like we didn’t belong here.  Like the air was too thick and too heavy, not meant for me to breathe.  

Without even realizing it, I had begun to hyperventilate.  I tried to stop myself, to calm myself down, but was unable to.  

David came over and looked in my eyes, and after a while I started to hear the words he was saying.  The cave was still beginning to turn darker and darker all around me, and I could feel myself losing consciousness, but I managed to listen to him.  

“Breathe deep,” he said.  “Slow it down.  You’re okay.  I’ve lived here this long.  The air is breathable.  You’re okay.  Big, deep breaths, lad.  Good.  Okay, that’s better.  Keep breathing, in and out.”

After a while I started to calm down, and looked at him gratefully.  

“Thanks,” I said.  “I needed that.”

“Stay there and get your wits about you.  I’ve got breakfast ready,” he said, and I realized he had a portion of mushrooms and wild lettuce set aside for me.  He brought it over on a flat rock and handed the food to me.  

“What’s the plan,” I asked, eyeing the food suspiciously.  Despite the fact that he said it was okay, I was still concerned.  

“Eat,” he told me.  “You need your energy.  We’re gonna walk over to the shitake patch.  On the way, we’ll check for the arch.  On the way back, we’ll check again.  That’s all we can really do.  It’s not safe lingering out there for too long.  Those things - they can smell us.”

I managed to eat a bit of the salad and mushrooms, despite the fact that they made me uneasy.  Consuming anything, even the air, in this world, felt wrong.  Like I was breathing in toxic fumes not meant for human consumption.  Still, a little bit of food couldn’t hurt me.  At least, that’s what I told myself.  

After eating, we set out for the archway.  

The hike was a long one, and David brought plenty of water and provisions, filling up our canteens from a spring along the way.  Once again, I felt glad for his guidance.  If not for him, I’d probably be dead ten times by now.  

After a long while we reached the clearing where the arch had been.  Once again, it wasn’t there.  The spot where it had been was empty, but we wandered over to it anyway.  

“How can it just disappear?  Be here one day and gone the next?” I asked.  

David shook his head.  

“How can any of this be possible?  I wouldn’t have believed it if someone told me.  Would you?”

I thought about that for a few seconds.  

“No, probably not.  I’d think they were crazy.  Or high.  Or maybe both.”

“And yet, here we are.  Defying all rational common sense.”

There wasn’t much more to say, so we continued walking.  

I tried desperately to ignore the feeling that I heard the sounds of rustling leaves behind us.  As if someone were following quietly, and at a distance.  Every time I looked back, there was no one there.

*

Eventually we reached the shitake patch. David told me to start picking the mushrooms quickly, before the creatures found us.  He said they were smart, and would send out scouts.  So once they knew where we were, more would be gathered together and they would come back to hunt us like pack animals.  

The worst part was, they knew this was a favorite spot of his, so they would be ready for him.  

After a few short minutes of gathering mushrooms, David told me to wrap up.  

“Let’s go,” he said.  “There’s no more time.”

Despite my fear I couldn’t believe what he was saying.  We had just started.  It had been such a long hike, and this small amount of mushrooms would barely sustain us for a day.  

“Come on, David,” I said.  “A few more minutes.”

“I said, let’s go!” he hissed at me, his face morphing into one of rage.  

I almost didn’t recognize him.  His color changed, going red, almost purple.  And there was something else strange too.  His chest seemed to spasm when he was angry.  The fabric puffed in and out in a very odd way, like he was breathing much too fast.  

He caught me looking at him and calmed down slightly, then came over to me and grabbed my arm, dragging me away from the mushroom patch.

“I can see one.  It’s a little ways away, at six o’clock.  That means there’s more.  We need to start walking fast.  Don’t run yet.  Don’t look.  Don’t let them know we saw them.”

All of this he said while dragging me away from the mushroom patch, and I fought the urge to glance over my shoulder.  But I did hear the distinct sound of movement now, coming closer, gaining on us steadily.  

“Do you hear that,” I asked, my heart pounding faster, my throat dry, my knees shaking.  

“Quiet,” he whispered angrily.  

I was silent for a few short seconds, and the noises came closer, and closer.  

“RUN!” he screamed, and I began to bolt as fast as I could through the trees.  

A second later, I heard them all around us.  They had surrounded us.  They’d been waiting.  

“Your gun!” David screamed from behind me, and I tried to get it ready while still running.  

Then I saw what he was worried about - one of the creatures was straight ahead - waiting for us partially hidden behind a tree.  It revealed itself just barely, poking its head out to look and see how far off we were, then it disappeared again.  

“You see it?” he shouted.  

“Yeah!” 

“When we get to that tree, you go left, I go right!  Don’t get too close!”

I understood immediately what he was doing.  He was sacrificing himself for me.  By going to the right, he was running right through the eyeline of the creature.  He would be running past it within inches of its grasp.  All to distract it so it wouldn’t get me.  

Part of me wanted to argue, but there was no time.  We were already at the tree.  I ran to the left and David went right.  The creature lunged at him, just as I’d feared, and managed to rake him with its long talon-like fingernails.  His back was bloodied as he ran, getting ahead of me as he put on speed.  

“There’s more up ahead,” he yelled.  And I saw them a second later.  

There were at least two, maybe more.  Hiding in the trees and waiting for us a little ways ahead.  I had a feeling they would not be fooled as easily as the last one.  

Luckily we had a speed advantage on the creatures.  At least the ones we’d come across so far.  I hated to think what a faster version of these things would look like.  Our ability to outrun them was the only thing keeping us alive.  I could hear them chasing after us, their heavy footsteps loud as they crushed the leaves underfoot.

“Let’s split up,” David said.  “You go left, I’ll go right.  Then we meet back in the middle, say a hundred paces from here.  Got it?”

“Sure,” I agreed, not sure what other options we had.  I was deferring to him, since he seemed to know what he was doing.  

“Now!” he yelled, and branched off from our trajectory, heading to the right.  At the same time, I went left.  

The creatures took a moment to respond, but once they saw what we were doing, they left their hiding spot where they were waiting to ambush us.  The creature closest to me came at me from my right and I screamed as it came within a few feet of me, its horrifying arms reaching out to grab me.  

I felt the breeze from its hand rushing past, but managed to duck out of the way just in time, stumbling over a fallen log and face-planting right afterwards.  The thing crawled after me and I felt it grab my ankle, pulling me towards it as I screamed.  

Kicking as hard as I could with my other leg, I brought my foot up into the creature's jaw, where it connected with a sickening crunch.  It howled a cry of hurt anger as its grip loosened on my ankle for a split second.  

I attempted to wrench myself free but it held on tightly.  The thing was strong!

I was about to kick it again when it grabbed my other leg and began to crawl in towards my face.  Its oversized eyes widened with anticipation, drool pouring out over its lower lip.  

The thing was about to eat me.

As it unhinged its jaw like a python about to consume a deer, I remembered the rifle slung across my back.  The thing darted its head forward toward my neck, as if to start its meal with my jugular.  

The rifle was caught underneath my bodyweight.  I was trying to rock side to side to pull it free while simultaneously shoving the thing away from me with my knees, kicking and bucking and doing anything I could to weasel my way out from its grasp.  

Just as its teeth were about to snap shut around my windpipe, I managed to free the rifle.  

Using all of my strength, I pulled my knees back and kicked the creature in its chest, sending it reeling backwards for half an instant.  

Just enough time for me to get a shot off.  

BOOM!

The blast echoed through the forest, exploding outwards from the barrel of my rifle.  

One moment the creature was there in front of me, the next its head was gone - replaced by a bloody crater jettisoning blood from the ruined remains of the creature's visage.

I scrambled to my feet and ran, not looking back.

After a long, harrowing run through the forest, I met up with David again.  He looked even worse for wear than before.  

Whereas I had gotten away cleanly, he had been mauled by one of the creatures, just barely escaping with his life.  He was bloodied and had gashes on his neck, his forehead, and both of his arms from defensive wounds.  

Worst of all, he lost his gun in the process, and now we were down to only one weapon for defense.  And half the ammo. 

Eventually we arrived back at the cave, after a long run through the forest, barely escaping with our lives.  

David was in rough shape, and I helped him lay down on his bedroll.  I went outside to find leaves or whatever possible to patch up his wounds, in the absence of bandages.  I had a small first aid kit with me as well, which I brought everywhere, but it wasn’t nearly enough for the injuries he’d sustained.  

I cleaned his wounds and packed the worst of them with gauze from my first aid kit, then wrapped them with long leaves from the forest.  

David began pushing me away when I went to unbutton his shirt, to tend to the wounds on his back.  I told him to calm down, but he wouldn’t stop resisting me.  Eventually I relented and told him to deal with the cuts himself.  They wouldn’t heal properly if he didn’t do something about them.  But he just closed his eyes and drifted off to sleep, the blood running from his wounds leaking out onto the rock floor of the cavern while he snored.  

*

For the second night in a row, I couldn’t sleep.  I kept thinking about David and his injuries.  He would be dead by morning if I didn’t do something.  There was too much blood loss.  I couldn’t understand why someone with his level of experience wasn’t taking this seriously.  Was he delirious?  

Suddenly his snoring stopped.  The cave was dead quiet and still in the darkness of the night.  

And then I heard a sound like rocks being moved.  A shuffling of feet.  Bones creaking and cracking.  

There was a wet, sloppy sound.  Smacking lips and rending flesh.  Someone pulling meat from bone and tearing gristle with sharp incisors.  

I peered into the darkness of the cave, looking in the direction of the sound, and my eyes slowly began to adjust.  

David was up.  He was eating something in the corner of the dark cave.  It looked like… Was it moving?  A rat?  Or a squirrel?

He tore another bite of flesh from the writhing thing which had been moving in his grasp, and suddenly it was still again.  The only sound was of him chewing.  

My eyes adjusted further, my heart pounding rapidly.  

David’s shirt was off.  He had treated his wounds after all.  In the darkness when I’d been trying to sleep, my eyes closed, he had been busy dealing with his injuries.

And I realized why he hadn’t wanted me to see beneath his clothes. 

It all made sense suddenly.  The twitching beneath his shirt when he got upset.  The way his color changed when he was angry.  His face had turned red.  Almost purple, like the sky.  

And beneath his shirt was the most obvious change of all.  

He took another large bite of whatever it was he’d found scurrying in the cave.  And with his FOUR quickly-moving hands, he pulled flesh from the bones and crammed more of the creature into his mouth.

His eyes were golden and reflective when they caught me staring at him in the darkness.  

And as I got to my feet I began to [run.](https://youtu.be/5V3obVKO4xA)
