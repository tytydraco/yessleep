Perhaps I came here seeking answers to questions I couldn’t fathom. Perhaps I came to find meaning. Or perhaps… I had died long ago and simply failed to realize it.

But regardless of the reason, I was in Kursk.

In the year 2000.

I remember it clearly. The last train out of Moscow. The filthy streets, the dimly lit bars, the lost souls wandering through the frostbitten air. I wanted to escape it all, and for some reason, Kursk called to me.

But the moment I arrived, I knew something was wrong.

Everything was… distorted.

As I looked around, I saw charred, broken tanks scattered across the fields. Rusted T-34s lay still, as if the battle had never ended. Abandoned artillery pieces, their barrels forever pointed at unseen enemies. I stepped over trenches filled with mud and shattered bones, uniforms still clinging to the skeletal remains of Soviet and Wehrmacht soldiers alike.

I knew the Battle of Kursk had ended in 1943. But why was I here?

In the year 2000.

Perhaps I was dreaming. Perhaps I was drunk. But when I looked up at the sky, I knew this was no dream.

The sky above me… had no sun. No clouds. Just a deep, crimson hue, as if someone had spilled blood across the heavens. And on the distant horizon, where I knew only ruined villages should remain, eerie green lights flickered, moving unnaturally.

Something—or someone—was still here.

I kept walking. Past crumbling concrete bunkers, bombed-out roads, and nature slowly reclaiming the scars of war. The past lingered everywhere. But I was not part of it.

A voice spoke behind me.

“Why are you still here?”

I turned. A man stood before me. A Soviet officer’s uniform clung to his frame, stained with mud and dried blood. His face was pale, his eyes hollow. But as I looked at him, I knew—he was alive. Or at least… he had been once.

“I… I don’t know,” I answered.

The man nodded, as if that was the only response he had expected.

“We are still fighting,” he said. “The Battle of Kursk never ended.”

I wanted to protest. I wanted to tell him he was wrong, that the war had been over for more than half a century. But I couldn’t. Because when I looked down at my own hands, I saw them trembling. The clothes I was wearing… were not what I had worn when I left Moscow.

It was a uniform.

Tattered. Stained.

On my chest… a red star.

I opened my mouth, but no words came out. I turned and ran. I sprinted past corpses frozen in time, past trenches filled with shattered helmets and rusted bayonets. Artillery fire roared behind me. Tanks were moving once more. I heard men screaming orders in Russian, in German. I saw flames rising through clouds of dust.

I ran. I wanted to escape.

But when I looked down at my feet, I realized they were no longer mine.

I had run past a puddle. And the reflection staring back at me… was not my own.

It was that of a soldier.

As I lifted my head, a shadow loomed before me. A woman stood there, her face blurred, but her eyes—her eyes were infinite, like the cosmos itself.

She smiled. And in that instant, I knew.

I had seen this smile before.

“Who are you?” I asked.

She did not answer. But I understood.

She was Kursk.

She was the battle itself.

And I… had always been here.

The year 2000.

Or perhaps… it was still 1943.

There was only one truth.

The Battle of Kursk… never ended.
