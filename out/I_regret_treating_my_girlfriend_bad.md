Genea is my girlfriend. She's 23, I'm 22. She was born on December 31st. She has BPD. I treat her the best I can, but if I make even a small mistake, she gets mad. Even if I forget to make the bed, she'll say, “Thanks for making the bed,” with that passive-aggressive tone, and then not talk to me. Instead, she talks to other guys in front of me—compliments them even. But I don’t care. I stay with her because I feel like nothing without her. I know it sounds cuckish, but she’s all I care about.
Until I can’t handle it anymore.
I get annoyed.  And I start to caring less. And that’s when she starts caring more. I feel powerful. The worse I treat her, the more aroused I get. I feel like I could get anyone. I'm on top of the world. But I shouldn't have done what I did. I regret it. Even shitty boyfriends don’t do this—but I did.

December 31st comes. Her birthday. I don’t even get her a gift or say happy birthday. My ego’s too high. I’m talking to some other girl and playing it off as “just a friend,” but this girl is the definitionof crazy. She starts crying and shouting at me even throwing stuff at me. Then, suddenly, she stops. Smiles. Hugs me tight.
"Why are you smiling, Genea?" I ask.
"I'm happy I have you," she says.
She walks towards me and hugs me. I hug her back. She goes on her tiptoes and asks for a kiss. I kiss her.

I think it’s her BPD—she’s split and now sees me as perfect again. But oh, I’m wrong.
She starts treating me better than ever. Cooking my favorite meals. Overfeeding me. I love it. And still, I treat her badly.

Later, I see her growing this magnificent plant. I’m 6'2", and the plant is almost as tall as me. It's beautiful. Alive. It feels like it has a soul. The leafy stems have tons of leaves—some alternating, not opposite—and it stands out in the garden. I admire the plant. The flowers are trumpet-shaped, some white, some purplish. It feels like they’re singing. Watching Genea care for the plants makes me fall for her all over again.
But I know if I treat her good, she’ll treat me bad again. So I keep up my shitty behavior.
One day, she gives me my favorite snack bar. I love these bars, even though I hate the dry mouth they give me. But like roses with thorns, they taste good, and I tell myself I can worry later.
She gives me these bars every day. I gain so much weight. And when I’m not with her—because I usually sleep beside her—I get angry. Impatient. I can’t sleep without her. I get so anxious. Still, I keep eating the bars. When I'm with her, I feel this enhanced focus. I become so creative. I start drawing on the walls—beautiful art. But I can’t stand for long because my heart rate is so high.

As I’m drawing, she says, “Hey love, can you draw me?”
I respond, “Sorry, I only draw beautiful things.”
No reply. Later, she comes to me and gives me more of my favorite bars—and a frozen bottle of water. She leans in and whispers in my ear, “Baby, please love me.” It’s so sensual it arouses me.
“Why should I?” I respond.
She gets up fast and shouts, “Fuck you! I try so hard. We’re fucking done!”
She storms off. I shout after her, “I’m only joking! Come back!” No response.
I wait. She doesn’t return. I grab a plate and throw it at the wall. I feel weak. Mentally wrecked. I can’t live without her. I rush to the bars she gave me and gobble them down. They remind me of her. I drink the frozen water.

Then, a knock at my door. I open it—and I don’t see one Genea. I see three.
They come inside and start talking to me. They say she cloned herself because one of her wasn’t enough to make me love her. I start talking to one while another ones mouth is occupied. It feels intense—stronger than I’ve ever felt. However the third one stands far away, watching in jealousy.

It confuses me. She is her. But her face starts turning upside down.
Freaked out, I get up and point at her. The other two stop and look at her. Then both their heads twist around and face me. They laugh. Then suddenly, they shrink—into child versions of themselves.
“Catch us,” they say in sync, “and we’ll give you a reward.”

I’m losing it. Is the clone bugging out? I get hot. I strip off all my clothes. The Geneas run away. I look into my bedroom—and see a man. I don’t know him. He’s just... there.
We start talking. He asks me about countries then religion. I ask about Genea.
He says, “They don’t exist. What are you on about?”
I point to the pile of clothes on the floor. “Here’s one!” I shout. “Genea, stop hiding!”
I hear her singing a beautiful lullaby.
“You don’t hear her?” I ask.
“Open the clothes,” the man says.
I do. No one’s there.
I look at him. “Who are you?”
He replies, “I am you. But I’m not real. You’re not real. You’re fake.”
“What are you talking about?” I ask.
He says, “What are you staring at right now?”
“You,” I tell him.
“What’s in your room?”
And then it hits me—it’s the mirror.
He laughs. Then he melts away.
I start seeing shadow figures. I hear Genea’s voice again, taunting: “Catch us…”
I can’t sleep. I talk to the shadows. I try to talk to the Geneas. Days go by. I shit blood. I piss blood. I cough blood. My room distorts. Twists. My house becomes a maze. I don’t know who or where I am. I lose my phone. Every time I pick up my clothes, they turn to sand and fall through my fingers.

I cry in the corner. The shadows and the Geneas get to me. I scream for help. I grab the pistol. I shoot at the Geneas. Every time, the bullets go through. They laugh.
“Missed me! You can’t catch me!”
They taunt. Laugh. Mock me. They get angry—because I’m trying to cheat.
They crowd me. I’m cornered. Bare. Sweating. A 9mm in my hand. One bullet left.
I don’t want this anymore.
I put the gun in my mouth and pull the trigger.
Darkness.

Then... light.
I wake up in a white room. It’s beautiful. Pure. My imagination runs wild. My head throbs, but it’s peaceful.
There’s a woman in a surgical mask. Her voice—so familiar. It makes my heart race. I feel whole. My ears tune into only her. Nothing else.
She tells me, “You will heal.”
And I believe her.
I enjoy this place. I’m free. No chains. And this woman—I feel something. A strange connection. Because she’s so familiar.
My life is complete.
The grass really is greener on the other side.
But if I didn't treated her bad. This wouldn't of happened.
