Not to brag or nothing, but I’ve donated blood 36 times in the past 8 years. I started donating when I was 22 and in a couple months I’ll be the big 3-0. I don’t even remember why I started doing it. I just wanted to help others and give back. Do something for someone else for a change, ya know? 

Anyway, I started regularly scheduling blood donations about every other month give or take. It got to the point that the volunteers that were working at the stations would recognize me. I got to know their names and even became friends with a few of them. One of them, Ren, became a gym buddy of mine. I even got the number of a volunteer. Meghan I think? We texted a couple times but after that she ghosted me and I stopped seeing her at the drives too.

Look, I know this is making me sound like some self righteous douche and I get it, but it’s just a very easy way to do good. All it takes is a little bit of time and an arm. Plus you get cookies and juice after, so why not?

As the years passed I’ve noticed some changes here and there about the drives. For one, the actual rooms for the drives were smaller. Like, sometimes harry potter closet small. I’ve also seen a whole lot of volunteers leave. Like they just straight up stop showing up after a while. New people come, but they don’t stay.

I was talking to Ren and he was trying to convince me to volunteer. He was all like, “We need all the help we can get, man, come on. You wouldn’t be sticking people or caring for anybody. All you’d have to do is work the front desk, greet people, and turn on that charisma to try and pull people in. Easy shit.”

I wasn’t sure I wanted to volunteer, not because I didn’t want to help more, I’m always down for giving back. But, it’s like, I do so much, I have a full time job and a girl I’m seeing occasionally. Although my full time job is work from home so I do make my own hours. And I’m kinda hitting a rough patch with this girl, I’m trying to keep it casual, but she’s talking about more. I’ve also been told I’m a very nice, easy going person that’s hard to say no to, so, what the hell, why not?

I signed up to work for a blood drive and, to be honest, it was sad! They set up camp in a public library and, like, no one came. Not literally no one. But it wasn’t a lot. Over 6 hours there were only 4 people who donated. That includes me. 

It seemed to, like, rub off on people. All the other volunteers were huddling close to each other and whispering about the bad turn out. They looked really worried, but when I tried talking to them, they’d just smile and act like everything was cool. But everything was *not* cool. I started texting people, asking if they were free to come donate, but I only got my sister and her girlfriend to come out and that was cause I said I’d buy them food. That brought our total to 6. Still not great.

Around the end of the day Ren was talking to another volunteer, Diane. Diane was, like, the head volunteer or something like that. She’s the person everyone seemed to go for with questions or anything. It was easy to tell she was in charge, formally or not.

When I was walking over to them Ren looked up at me and said hi with waaay too much enthusiasm. Like he was making up for the fact that he was whispering and being all sneaky sad. 

I asked if it was normally this slow and Diane said, “This is a particularly bad day for us.” Diane was maybe in her 40’s or something and I think she’s married. Didn’t look like she had a kid or if she did she still took *very* good care of her figure. Did have a bit of RBF though.

Anyway, I wanted to try and be more optimistic so I said something like, “I’m sure it’ll pick up soon, right?” giving my always charming smile and keeping things light.

Ren went with me and said, “Oh, yeah. We’ll get more donors and then more blood and everything’ll turn out alright. Right, Diane?” He looked to her to see if she’d join the vibe. 

She didn’t. She just made some sour puss face and said, “Unless something tragic happens or a local celebrity is hurt, things aren’t going to pick up any time soon,” then she stomped off. 

“Yo, dude, she always like that?” I looked back to Ren and he had his head in his hand. “Man, you good?”

Ren looked ready to cry. He’s always had this desperation about him that was just sad. “We’re in a blood shortage right now. We don’t have nearly enough blood. I’ve seen the people this affects. I know what will happen if we don’t get more blood. People--” he stopped and let out a big sigh. His breath smelled like garlic bread. He shook his head at me, his hair shaking with it, and said, “If things don’t pick up soon people will die. That’s just a fact.” 

That was hard to hear.

For the next three weeks I donated not my blood but my time. I mean, I would’ve donated my blood too, but I had to wait.

Anyway, over the next three weeks I volunteered out on 11 more drives. Just a reminder, I have a full time job too, so, 11 was a lot. Over the course of those 11 drives I saw less and less people coming in, sometimes no one at all, and the other volunteers seemed to get real panicy. This last drive they were set up in some back room of a church. Everyone was  packing up for the night and it was already pretty dark out. I needed to piss but as I was heading to the bathroom I saw a volunteer crying. I don’t just mean little crying, she was damn near sobbing! I came up behind her and asked if she was okay and she jumped when I spoke. 

“Sorry, didn’t mean to scare you,” I said smiling. She smiled back and wiped a tear. “Are you okay?”

Melissa (her name was Melissa) didn’t  look too hot. Her eyes were puffy and her hands shook as she put them together around her necklace. It was a cross or crucifix. I don't really know the difference. I’m not super religious, but this girl was. Not, like, an-in-your-face *you need jesus* type of religious, but it was still the only thing I knew about her. She had one of those jesus fish bumper stickers, she wore a cross (or a crucifix), and I saw her praying every time just before we open. So I asked her if she was okay and with her hands clasped around her necklace she pushed a smile as she said, “Just. Nervous.” She said it like that too, as if it were two sentences with a pause in the middle. *Just. Nervous.*

“Why? Is everything okay?” I noticed for the first time that she had a very nice smile. She had those big doe eyes and her hair pulled back behind her ears. Also her shirt was lower cut than I would’ve thought given the jesus thing. She honestly was like, real cute.

“‘Is everything okay?’” At first I thought she was asking me and got confused, but she was just repeating the question, thinking it over, eyes up to the ceiling. Or maybe up to like the heavens or something, I dunno. There was a good 5 seconds before she answered and all she said was, “I pray that everything will be okay.” Then she smiled again, a real pretty smile, and with a hand still over her necklace she walked past me. 

Anyway, I went and pissed then joined everyone else back in the little side room. Everyone just seemed so... well, like Melissa. They all seemed nervous. They were whispering amongst each other and I walked up to Ren and put a hand on his shoulder to get his attention and he freaked. He jumped, which made me jump. 

“Sorry. I thought you were someone else.”

“Who, dude? Why is everyone so jumpy? What’s going on?”

“Nothin. Everything’s fine. Look, I was thinking, why don’t you head now?”

“No,” Diane said as she listened in on our conversation. She was standing on the other side of the room so when she spoke everyone turned to look at her. She closed the gap between Ren and myself standing, honestly a little too close for comfort. Diane looked me in the eyes with an intense glare. I got the sense she was trying to, like, intimidate me and for a moment it almost worked. So, she looked me in the eye and said, “Do you want to continue volunteering with us?”

Everybody stopped what they were doing and watched. I let out a laugh and said, “Yeah! Of course!” 

“Are you sure about this?” Diane said as if I was making a very serious decision. “If you continue to volunteer and help us out, you can’t leave after tonight.”

I looked towards Ren expecting him to be hiding a laugh or something because this just seemed very ridiculous. *Can’t leave after tonight?* Of course I can! That’s how volunteering works! Everyone was taking this so seriously and yes, I know we’re in a blood shortage and we haven’t had a lot of donors, but to act like this is a crucial decision felt so weird. My opinion on that has changed. 

“Yeah, I still want to help volunteer,” I said, trying my best to sound stern and match their seriousness. 

Diane opened her mouth to say something but there were three incredibly loud knocks on the side door to the church. Everybody froze and looked towards Diane. She took a deep breath and said to me, “I hope you mean that.”

Diane started towards the door and everyone followed her. Ren put his arm around my shoulder and said, “I made a mistake asking for your help.”

I gave a polite chuckle and said, “It’s okay, dude. I’m fine.” He gave me a pity look, like I was some idiot child or something, then followed Diane. I was right behind them.

Diane opened the door and there he was. A man stood in the doorway, the light pouring around him making him look almost unearthly. Like he was chiseled from stone by the hand of a god. He had a strong jaw with a nice even face and that perfect amount of stubble. He was tall. Taller than me. I’m 6’1”, but he had three or four inches on me at least. His hair was midnight black and eyes were a piercing dark blue. Looking into his eyes sent shivers up my spine, and suddenly I was cold. He had a good frame, in solid shape, and he stood with his back perfectly straight, shoulders back, and hands stuffed into the pockets of his ankle length jacket as he towered over everybody. 

“Trying to hide in a church?” His voice was a deep bassy silky smooth voice that echoed in my own head. I wanted him to keep talking. What I really wanted was for him to talk to me. I had a desire to be noticed by him, but I also felt that if he did see me I’d panic. 

Diane tried to start talking, but fumbled over her words. She cleared her throat and started again, “This is just where we were set up today. We’re not hiding from anybody.”

The man said nothing, but instead took 5 large steps back, his black shoes making a pleasant clop on the concrete. Diane took several small steps forward and we all walked after her. I can’t speak for anybody else, but I know that I didn’t have the conscious thought to walk forward, I just moved. 

As the man stepped back he revealed he was not alone. There were 6 of us, Diane, Ren, Melissa, two people named Luke and Amania, and myself. There were only 5 of them, but it still felt as if we were outnumbered. The main guy stood with two people to either side of him, and they all had that same breathtaking beauty to them. There were two guys and two girls, all tall and stunning and all with expressions of steel and faces that looked constructed to be perfect. 

One of the men had a clean shaven face and short perfectly placed brown hair. His eyes were big with small dark pupils. The other man had a wonderfully groomed beard and long golden blond hair that flowed to his shoulders. The woman center right had short auburn hair that was longer on one side with a clenched jaw and cheek bones as sharp as swords. The woman next to her had long onyx black hair and hypnotic neon bright eyes that I couldn’t look away from. She looked most like the main gentleman. They all wore those long black jackets and they stood straight up and above us, they’re feet practically gliding above the ground. 

The cold air hit my bare arms and I shivered. I wanted my coat, but I knew I couldn’t leave. I didn’t want to leave. I had to know what this man would say.

“What do you have?” he said. He didn’t have any detectable accent, but his voice was very distinct, very american, and very pleasant. 

Diane turned toward Amania and said something in a whisper. Amania hesitated, looked back to the man, and then ran inside. After a second or two Amania came back out with a reusable bag that she held out to the man. He snatched it up and she flinched. He smiled at her fear and without looking held the bag out to the woman with the deadly cheek bones. She looked inside the bag and sighed. After closing the bag she turned her eyes back to all of us, seeing all of us together and each of us individually at the same time. “It’s not enough,” she said in a cold German accent. The man in the center tightened his jaw and tilted his head as he looked at Diane. He didn’t say anything. He didn’t need to. 

“James, I know we’re low and I’m sorry, but it’s all we have. We don’t even have anything for the patients or to give to--”

The man, James, raised a hand and Diane stopped, almost as if unable to speak. His hand was large and he slowly curled his fingers and put his hand back into his pocket before speaking. “I do not care about what you need.” He spoke slowly, not needing to worry about losing our attention. “I care about what you owe us. Our payment that we agreed upon. And, as she said,” he motioned towards the woman on his right with a fluid movement, “it is not enough. Now, you have been short the past three times we’ve come to collect.”

“James, I--”

“Hush.” He drew the *sh* of the word out getting quieter until he was silent. “You disappoint me, Diane.” A breath escaped her as if she was physically hurt by that.

The woman with the entrancing eyes was scanning the crowd and she stopped on me as I stared back. She smiled at me and I turned my eyes to the ground, feeling embarrassed and scared, like a grade school boy. I peeked back up at her and she was still looking at me, still smiling, so I looked away. 

I looked towards Diane, who was also looking at the ground. It was hard to tell, but it seemed as if her eyes were watering. James took two loud and careful steps towards Diane. *Clop. Clop.* It left an uncomfortably small distance between them. “Look. At. Me.” Diane craned her neck to look up at James. He leaned forward and down, hovering over her and in a whisper we could all still hear he said, “You know what must be done now, don’t you?” 

Diane swallowed. I suddenly felt very bare and exposed. My bones turned to ice.

James stood up and started to survey the rest of us, walking back and forth. When his eyes met mine I felt everything freeze and goosebumps run across my entire body. He looked away from me and I released the breath I was holding. I’m sure he only looked at me for a brief second, but it felt like minutes. He stopped pacing and his eyes landed on someone. I followed his gaze to Melissa, who had her head down, eyes closed, and was holding her crucifix as she prayed inaudibly. 

James turned to the man with the long hair and they seemed to talk to each other only in a glance. The man walked forward, his boots making a heavier thud than James’s shoes. He stood in front of Melissa, his shadow falling over her, his toes to hers, and she stopped praying and opened her eyes. Slowly she looked up at this man. When she met his gaze I saw a tear roll down her cheek and her lips curled up like a small smile. 

This man looked like the one she prayed too, long hair and beard, but he certainly wasn’t here to save her. 

It happened before I had time to register it. His hands moved in a blur to Melissa’s head and his sharp daggered teeth were over her throat. Melissa let out a pained moan and her arms went limp at her sides.  I saw the color drain from Melissa’s face and looked away as the sounds continued. My legs felt suddenly weak as a wave of horror and relief hit me.

When he was done the man opened his hands and let Melissa drop to the ground. I looked back to see his mouth stained red. He wiped it on the sleeve of his coat indelicately and smiled as he fell back in line.

James smiled down at Diane and said, “Next time, it’s everyone.”

He turned on his heels and walked away, the rest of his group followed. All five of them left, joining the darkness of the night, as the six, now five, of us stood in the sickly yellow light of the church. 

It’s been three weeks since then and these meetings are monthly. Things have not gotten better, but not much. I hold Melissa’s crucifix in my pocket now. Not that it does much, but I feel safer having it there. We did get a new volunteer too. A nice sweet girl named Lyanne. Diane told her to take next week off. 

Please, oh God please, if you can donate blood, do it. It’s a matter of [life and death.](https://www.redcrossblood.org/give.html/find-drive?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D48102861298134648994468031603124344829%7CMCORGID%3D723A22C757518E2C7F000101%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1674226551)
