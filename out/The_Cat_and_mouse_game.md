Hey, my name is detective Marlowe. 5 years ago I was working as a detective at the Harrodsburg police department. I had just been named the hero of Harrodsburg, the man that has solved every case thrown his way and helped clean up the streets up. I was so happy until  that  day. I was told I can never speak about…but…I can’t hide it anymore. I need to tell everybody The truth of the hunt for what people like to call the cat and mouse killer. I know it sounds like a silly name but what he did to this town will never be forgotten. 

October 14th I found out that my mother had lung cancer. I spent a lot of time with her by making breakfast, dancing to music with her, and just spending a lovely time with her. I’d always feel bad about leaving her for work but she always reassured me that it was okay cause I was stopping the bad people of Harrodsburg. 

October 20th  I had just made us breakfast and was enjoying my time with her.  We talked about when we first got the house. I was just about 10 years old and we were getting away from my abusive father which we didn’t speak about. We talked about When we first got to the house it was very gross and needed a serious remodeling. We repainted the gross white walls that were destroyed, their was really bad mold that we had to learn to clean up,  the flooring was so nasty that it smelled of shit, and we had to completely replace the flooring. It might have been bad but staying with that monster was a lot worse. As we were talking about how happy we were about turning the house around completely,  I  received a call from my partner and best friend detective Morgan. Morgan said “hey Marlowe, sorry for bothering you. I know your with your mom right now but the body of frank has just been found in front of the hot lagoon and its pretty bad so we will need your help. ” I told him “no, it’s fine, if its as bad as you say then I need to be there.” Morgan said “thank you sir, please get here soon because we truly need to find the guy that did this.” I hung up and told my mom “I love you, I really don’t want go but I need to.” She just smiled and told me “son, whatever your doing is very important to this town.” I smiled and hugged her. 

I headed down to the hot lagoon, a bar about 5 miles out. When I had arrived Morgan came over to me telling me “you really need to check this out it’s not like anything we’ve seen before.” I headed past the ambulance, the cops, the news, and the people their sitting their in shock. I looked around at the Halloween decorations that they had put all around the front with spider webs and skeleton props sitting in the chairs in front of the bar But right in front of the door was frank. What I saw was like nothing I had ever seen before in my life. It was frank but his entire gut was opened up like a butcher gutting a pig. his intestines pulled around  these two dead mice In a form of a circle with something wrapped up placed right between the mice. I put my gloves on and pulled it out. I tore open the paper seeing a video tape that said “happy birthday~marlowe” i looked over at Morgan telling him “we need to see what this is about.” We look around the hot lagoon trying to find any evidence but not a single footprint or hand print anywhere so we took pictures of franks from body and around the lagoon and searched the entire property but their wasn’t a single clue of what had happened or who done it so the killer had to be thinking 10 steps ahead of us. I looked over at Morgan telling him “we need to find this guy cause I don’t think this will be the last.” Morgan agreed and told me that we need to check out these tapes and try to look at any footage that maybe the bar had gotten over night. 

We headed down to the station to talk to the boss Mr. Jackson. It was about 15 miles down the road from the hot lagoon. Me and Morgan were fast walking in the decent size building  past the cops that we completely ignored.  We headed into the office at the very end of the hall and sat down to talk to Mr. Jackson, we handed him the video tape in a paper wrap  and told him “we found this in the body of frank…it says happy birthday to me and I don’t really understand who would know me that is out to get me” Jackson looked at us telling us “oh god, who would think one day somebody would be after the hero of the city.” Morgan looked over at me, saying “yeah I believe they have to be close to Marlowe and we just need to watch the tape so we can maybe see who it is.” We pulled out the TV and the video player that Jackson likes to keep in his closet. I looked around with a pale white face and nodded at them as I placed the tape in. 

It started with somebody walking up to this table with a blanket, hearing the muffled out screams and cries. He pulled it off slowly saying “happpppy birthday to you, happy birthday to you” he pulled the blanket off, showing us franks who seemed to be tied down to the table and his mouth covered in tape. The man that did this grabbed a butcher knife and put his hand on frank as we see him trying to fight but unable to all he can do is cry with his muffled screams slowly going away. we watched the killer place the knife on his stomach tearing through the top of his stomach and slowly watched the knife cut down. We heard the sounds of screams fading and skin being tore in half almost as if  frank was a pig at a butcher shop still saying “happy birthday to you” but once he was at the bottom he opened up the stomach and placed the dead mice, finishing the video by saying “marlowe, I hope your celebration gives you many memories. I hope you like the game we have begun playing” The video cut to black after that. I sat there  staring into the black TV screen just feeling sick and for the first time ever…I was truly scared….they padded me on the back saying it’s okay we will find him. I didn’t know if I should believe them or not I just knew somebody was out for me…I’m sorry, I’m starting to get sick….I think it’s time for me to take a break from this…I’ll be back to tell the rest just give me a bit….
