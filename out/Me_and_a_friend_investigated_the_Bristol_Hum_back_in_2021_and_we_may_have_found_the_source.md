For those who don't know about the Bristol Hum, imagine a pulsating throbbing low pitch sound, like an air turbulance or that sort of sound you hear in horror movies before something bad happens, as you can guess, it can be annoying, and best of all? no one knows the cause, there have been various investigations over the years and supposed recordings along with hypothesis after hypothesis, yet no one knows the true cause, and it's made stranger by the fact that the hum isn't just in Bristol, or the UK, or Europe, it's been heard all over the world.

&#x200B;

Me and one friend (who we'll call M) started hearing the hum back in 2020 during the lockdowns, exclusively at night, the day after the first night i heard it i phoned M up and his first words? 'dude what was that strange sound last night'

&#x200B;

And for the next year, we continued to hear it, and that's when our interest in finding the cause increased, our attempts at recording it were in vain, but we did manage to get something with the help of a friend who works in audio, we tried to use special microphones to find a bearing of the sound, but it seemed like it was coming from every direction.

&#x200B;

One night the hum was particularly strong so the next day i had an interesting proposition for M, to investigate it, to assemble a small group and leave our comfort zone to find the source once and for all, so the next day i texted all my friends, expecting at least a few to decline.

&#x200B;

But it turned out that they'd all been hearing it since 2020 and were just as interested, and so we all agreed, to prepare and wait for a night where it's bad again and hunt it down, you see, the hum isn't as bad every night and some nights it's not there at all, it's one aspect about it that can drive you insane and leave you wondering if you just imagined it.

&#x200B;

Over the next few weeks we got our equipment and plans together, sound engineer friend, S, supplied us with recorders and microphones, a friend who liked airsoft, T, provided us with two way radios, torches and a military grade NVG (PVS-14) for me at least, the rest of the crew got night vision camcorders.

&#x200B;

We all coordinated it like a military operation, my job, since i had the night vision device, was just to keep an eye out, while recording the hum making notes with my recorder, S would attempt to narrow down the direction of the sound and give us areas to investigate, M would be providing backup for me and focus on videoing the action, T would keep track of where we were and would be the first to investigate any potential sources before we went in further, finally a techie friend, B, kept an eye on our locations with FindMyiPhone and monitored and recorded our radio communications all from home.

&#x200B;

Our plan was simple, wait for a night when the hum was strong by 12 AM and if we all heard it, we were to bring our equipment and rendezvous at a nearby park, starting our search from there.

&#x200B;

Every night we made sure to keep our batteries charged, and followed Ts strong advice not to burn out his NVD by using it during the day, it took a few nights, but finally the night came.

&#x200B;

Quickly texting my friends, they all confirmed they heard it too, some even texted before me, X was notified, and i grabbed my recorder, phone, NVD, torch and made my way to the park.

&#x200B;

The rendezvous went perfectly, we met up and setup and tested our equipment, everything on and recording, we started off, the hum sounded kind of different outside, and S had found an ever so slightly stronger hum signature towards the west, in the back of my mind it occured to me that it could just be ships but there was no turning back now.

&#x200B;

We advanced westward down the Avon, S still reported the hum was stronger towards the west, soon we passed the S.S Great Britain, but according to S no sound signature was coming from her, and my NVD showed nothing, we continued advancing for an hour and a half, and soon the city of bristol was behind us, and we were on the near the leigh woods between bristol and the dock, heading towards the clifton bridge.

&#x200B;

Suddenly our radios crackled into life with the voice of B.

&#x200B;

'This is control, comm check, comm check, 123' control was what we called B over the radios.

&#x200B;

'What is your 10-20, i repeat what is your 10-20'

&#x200B;

10-20 is old CB codewords for location so i replied

&#x200B;

'Just wanted to warn you that your signal is dipping, i estimate you will have no comms back to me if you go beyond the bridge, i advise keeping to high ground'

&#x200B;

We heeded Bs warning and continued on, keeping away from the edge of the Avon while trying to stick to higher ground, it was pitch black and the PVS-14 was doing a great job of making sure i could see, what i didn't realize was the hum was becoming increasingly louder and it was being picked up clearly on all our recorders, the reports from S solidified that, and we were just a few hundred yards away from the bridge when i noticed the hum, it was strongest i'd heard it.

&#x200B;

S moved even closer to the bridge and reported that it seemed to be coming from across the avon, somewhere in or near leigh woods.

&#x200B;

We all focused our equipment across the gorge, but i couldn't really see anything out of the ordinary, to my perspective it just looked like when you see night vision being used in the woods, creepy, but nothing obvious popped out as an immediate threat.

&#x200B;

We stood around investigating for a while, not finding much of anything, we decided to backtrack to investigate leigh woods, we found our way on the other side of the avon gorge and kept following the hum, it seemed to be getting much stronger, you could almost feel it.

&#x200B;

The whole group descended into leigh wood and that's when we noticed it, aside from the hum, there was no other sounds, the woods seemed devoid of any animal life, i looked around the woods, and up at the night sky, i thought i noticed a little structure in the distance, and S's sound equipment showed the strongest signature yet eminating from that direction.

&#x200B;

It was at this point that M started telling me he was getting a bad feeling, we had fearless almost the entire investigation up to this point, i did too think something was disagreeable about the hum, something not right, but i quickly snapped out of it, it's just a strange sound, that's all.

&#x200B;

We slowly advanced towards the small structure with T at the front of the group, at it drew closer it seemed little more then a small wooden shed, the kind you would see in someones back garden, a familar sight, in an otherwise creepy landscape, yet i did feel as though bad vibes were coming from the shed, i dismissed it as infrasound from the hum, infrasound is supposedly a pitch of sound that can cause feelings of anxiety, creepiness, and paranoia, and the hum apparently produces it.

&#x200B;

At this point it felt extreamly strong, it felt like it was eminating from the shed, and indeed T said he could almost feel it with his hand against the wood work.

&#x200B;

The shed was up against a tree, and the four windows on one side seemed to have been painted over, none of us could see what was in there, when we peered in with our night vision devices and torches.

&#x200B;

The front and only door was locked, by an old fashioned lever-type padlock, it was here our radios lit up with a crackly tranmission, barely understandable, it was from B, another comm check, we told him of the shed, the padlock, the painted over windows, B told us that he would continue tracking us, but radio communication might be hard or impossible any further out, saying the trees were blocking the signal.

&#x200B;

We looked at the shed and wondered if and how we should effect an entry, none of us knew lock picking, so that was out of the question, T told us that if we really wanted to see the source of the hum, put a stop to it and possibly even end up in the news, we were going to have to break in.

&#x200B;

T, who was the kind of person to do an SAS-type raid on his own house, and the person assigned to go in before us, happily obliged to do it, every kick of that wooden door sent a loud rattling bang across the gorge, it seemed much louder then the hum, almost like a gun going off, and i wondered what gossip there would be tomorrow of the hum and apparent gunshots, the hum didn't even seem that loud, but S said those low pitch sounds can travel far and wide, like a ships horn, and that the sound of our forced entry wasn't going that far.

&#x200B;

With every kick the wood seemed to weaken and on the fifth kick, the wood around the shackle gave way and lock flew off, the door didn't burst open, as it was an outward opening door.

&#x200B;

T put his foot in the door, and after a count of three, swung the door open.

&#x200B;

Our equipment focused on the space as T went in first, it looked like a typical shed, a shelf hung below the windows, we all checked for signs of security cameras, but there was nothing, save for a small box we went through, and it just contained old car parts, some old gaskets, a stereo, filters, and some aftermarket steering wheel.

&#x200B;

We were all just going to leave when T suggested something:

&#x200B;

'Wait a minute, move the box, don't ask why, just move it'

&#x200B;

I shifted the box across the small space and to my surprise, there was a hatch.

&#x200B;

'I thought so' T said

&#x200B;

T again, obliged to lift the hatch, as we watched and filmed on, all i saw down there was a blizzard against an inky black sky, the achilies heel of passive image amplification, according to T, was true darkness, not star or moonlight, so we'd all need our camcorders night vision, which are like invisible torches switched on, according to T, the NVDs were capable of seeing this infrared night vision.

&#x200B;

T descended on a dodgy old ladder and came down to a small space with an indescript piece of machinery, the hum seemed to eminate out of this hole, from this machine, we all descended after T deemed it was safe.

&#x200B;

The space was no bigger then the shed itself, the machine seemed to vibrate with the humming, and sheets of paper littered the floor, we walked over to one corner, where was a little table with an old book on it, it looked victorian, like the kind of book that would contain a 19th century engineering text.

&#x200B;

It was blank on the cover but the first page was signed by I.K Brunel, the late great engineer, and most of the book, written in latin with some english, mixed in with depictions of whatever the pump-like steampunk apparatus behind us was, thinking back now, it had a thick wire extending straight into the earth.

&#x200B;

We did find manage to find some english writing in the book, reading by torch because that PVS made it almost impossible to read close up.

&#x200B;

'Such an apparatus shall gurantee the west country if not the entire world a certain security from the beast'

&#x200B;

The word beast was underlined, but a werid book was never going to put a stop to the sound that has quizzed the world over, so T went up to it and grabbing a lever like you would see on an old steam locomotive, squeezed the trigger and pulled it.

&#x200B;

Just like that the hum stopped, it was now 3:30 in the morning, we left, but not before taking the book with us.

&#x200B;

As we exited the shed to a hum free world, we radioed B and told him of what we did, we would be in the news, for sure, and no doubt soon people who knew what they were actually doing would descend upon the machine.

&#x200B;

But we never got that far, for as we were walking across Leigh Wood, i caught sight of a huge inky black mass beyond a tree line, we stopped, it was like a dog almost as big as a car, and even though the NVD it seemed entirely black.

&#x200B;

Suddenly, it turned toward us, two eyes seemed to give off an immense amount of infrared light, temporarily blinding me with the NVD, and according to T 'caused them to go into autogated bright source protection mode but it still burned two dots into the tube' when i regained my vision all i remember is shouting 'Run Run Run!' and we took off, running back towards bristol.

&#x200B;

We felt a presence much worse then the hum, thinking back at this point the hum was almost benign, we ran, but we were soon stopped by a figure in victorian dress near a tree.

&#x200B;

A figure who looked a lot like I.K Brunel and who seemed to freeze time as he spoke.

&#x200B;

'I am the late brunel, and i come here because i know you switched my apparatus off, that... machine, protects the world'

&#x200B;

'Protects the world from what? not being annoyed?' M said

&#x200B;

'From the beast, let me tell you a little story, you know that in September of Eighteen Fifty Nine i ceased to be, such is true, but what has never been told is three years before, September of Eighteen Fifty Six, i saw the beast in this very wood, the hound, he is, sent to collect the souls of those whose contract have expired, i knew not long was left after i saw the beast, so between designing my great ship i should never see fully built, work i did upon this machine, putting it into action was the last thing i did before i fell too ill'

&#x200B;

'The hum though!' T joined in

&#x200B;

'A ghost can neither maintain nor oil a machine, so it is not my fault, but the likes of the great tesla would later improve its powers by way of the so called herztian rays, which were found early on to deter the supernatural'

&#x200B;

'Indeed' The continued

&#x200B;

'If you looked more upon that book of yours, which i ask back, you may find another half of it is written by the great Nikola Tesla'

&#x200B;

We handed back the book, and with that, the ghost vanished into thin air, and so did the hound, we looked behind, and the little shed was gone.

&#x200B;

We got into contact with B, who said he had been trying to contact us for an hour, it was now 4:30, and we made our way back to bristol without a problem, apart from the ever present hum that had returned.

&#x200B;

The next day we checked our recordings, but it was as if the recordings around the time of finding the shed were deleted, no camera or recorder had any recording of it, it was always us walking into leigh wood, then cut to us walking back to bristol, that's it, Bs recording of our comms was normal, but again there was no mention of a shed, or padlock, just B telling the void that the signal was weak.

&#x200B;

The FindMyiPhone logs were of no help either, showing that we went no where near where we think the little shed was.

&#x200B;

Nor did any of S's equipment capture anything, it was the same story, hum, but the shed, the ghost, the book, none of it.

&#x200B;

But the only reason i write this three years after, is because last night, i dreamed of a large black dog, with [red eyes](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/search/?q=subreddit%3Anosleep%20author%3Anocommunication7&restrict_sr=1).
