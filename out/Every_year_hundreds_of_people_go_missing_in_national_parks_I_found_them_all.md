My friends and I were very into spooky adventures. It was a hobby that originated in our high school years. We started playing with an Ouija board at some cemetery at night, and like addicts looking for a bigger high, we moved on to exploring abandoned buildings that were supposedly haunted. With the exception of a very unsettling atmosphere at most places, we were never in any real danger... That is until our last adventure. 

It had been some time since we had the chance to go on any adventure. Once we graduated from high school, some of us moved away for college, others started families, and others simply fell off the face of the earth. A while back, I was contacted by my best friend in high school, and after catching up, he proposed a trip to a national park. Usually, this sort of trip would actually be a nice outdoor experience with friends, but Mike had specifically picked the national park for a reason: The disproportionate number of people that go missing there a year. 

This tidbit of information immediately made me pause. We were all in a way adrenaline junkies, always looking for that next scare. The difference this time was that we weren't going to explore an abandoned building or play in a graveyard. We were going to visit a place where real people go missing and are never heard from again. Mike,being the silver tongue devil as always, managed to convince me that we would be safe camping at the park and that a handful of our group had vast experience in the outdoors. 

Even though I should've made the sane decision of hanging up the phone and going back to my daily mundane life, I was out on the road two days later and was meeting up with my friends at the park visitors center. The first thing I noticed was the immense beauty of the park. We had not even begun to explore the area, and it was already one of the most breathtaking places I'd ever laid eyes on. The second thing I noticed was the bulletin board next to the parking lot. It was overflowing with missing person posters. 

While we had begun to unload all our camping equipment, a park ranger came out of the visitor centers office. He looked tired, like he had not gotten a minute of sleep in the past week but was trying hard to fake a friendly demeanor. "Hello everyone, what brings you to our park?" He said in a tired voice. Mike engaged him in conversation.  "We're just here for a camping weekend, sir." 

The park ranger looked saddened at the words coming out of Mike's mouth. "Yeah, it looks that way. Listen, you folk don't look like the misinformed kind, and I know you've seen our bulletin boards. People have a tendency to go missing in this park, and we are very short on staff, being I'm the only one on shift. If you insist on camping in this area, don't go too deep into the woods and stay on the paths. If you get lost out here... well, we don't have a good track record of finding nice folk like you." 

The park ranger didn't really stick around waiting for our reply. He went about his day, and we just went about ours. Our group, composed of 6 people, three men and three women, walked for a few miles looking for a good camping spot within the woods. I was initially against being so far away from our vehicles until Mike and one of his friends, Alex pulled out hunting rifles from their bags. If there was anything dangerous in these woods, we would be surely safe, I thought. 

 After a long walk, we found a spot that was perfect for our campsite, and we began setting our tents up. By nightfall, we had multiple tents around a campfire, and we began drinking a few beers and reminiscing about our old high school adventures. Around midnight,Mike had a terrible idea that he had joyfully proposed to the rest of us. "We should try and find some of those missing people out here. Some of them would just be bones by now." 

Nobody was drunk enough to go exploring the dark woods in search of ghosts with the exception of Mike and his friend Alex. When the rest of our group inevitably rejected his proposal, he took his hunting rifle, his friend and Brenda, the woman he was dating and drunkenly set off for a scary adventure in the woods. As they left and we could no longer hear their steps in the woods, I remembered the park rangers warning, "Stay on the paths," which they most definitely did not do. My worries were validated hour's later when they had not returned to the campsite. We tried reaching them on their phones, but we had no service this deep into the woods.

 After some debate, we decided to head back to the visitors center and get help from the park ranger. Regardless of his previous warnings, we would have a better chance at finding our friends with his help and not go blindly searching in the woods and inevitably get lost as well. We only took what was necessary with us, some flashlights, and the other hunting rifle Alex left at the camp. About thirty minutes into walking back to the visitors center, we noticed something unsettling. All the wildlife around us seemed to go dead quiet. It seemed like our footsteps echoed throughout the woods for miles. 

From my very limited experience in nature, I could remember that when the woods went quiet, a predator was nearby. Just when I was about to consider the sinister thought, a scream broke the silence. "Help!" It sounded like Mike was crying out somewhere not too far from us. "Help me!" We started to follow the screams for help, which led us further and further away from the path. A few dozen feet deeper into the woods, we found a flickering flashlight that had been cracked and barely functioning. 

A few feet in front of us, we could hear Mike: "Help me." Mike sounded weaker this time, but something was off. His voice sounded wrong this time, like someone was trying to imitate how a human spoke and Mike's voice at the same time. "Mike, are you hurt, buddy?" I said concerned but not moving an inch forward until I got a reply. "... YeS... CoMe... HeLp..." Mike said maybe twenty feet in front of us. He looked like he was on his knees. 

"Where are Alex and Brenda?" I asked while signaling Josh to ready the rifle he was carrying. "ThEyRe... HeRe... We... FoUnD...ThEm..." I pointed my flashlight towards Mike... his body was on his knees, his head was slumped forward, and his shirt was covered in dirt and bathed in blood. I know knew that whatever was talking to us only a few feet in front of us was not Mike. He had been dead for hours. "They were so damn tasty." 

The voice stopped trying to imitate Mike. Mike's head raised up to where we could see his lifeless eyes rolled to the back of his head, and somehow, his dislocated jaw was moving by itself, like some sort of demonic ventriloquist  and dummy show. Something large and grotesque emerged from behind Mike's corpse. It had one of its inhuman hands lodged into the back of Mike's skull using him as a puppet. It wasted no time to drop on all fours and rush towards us. Josh fired a shot at it and missed. 

Before our reflexes could kick in, it had crashed into us, throwing Amber and I in different directions, but making sure it got Josh first as he was the biggest threat with a weapon. I landed a few feet from Amber, who had landed badly and broken her leg. I got her up, and we shuffled as fast as Amber could go while the creature ripped chunks off Josh. We made it maybe 50 meters before we were knocked to the ground, and Amber was pulled away into the dark woods, screaming all the way. I got to my feet again and sprinted faster and further than I had ever gone before. I stopped hearing Amber's wails of pain and knew that thing would catch up to me in a matter of moments no matter how fast the surge of adrenaline would make me run.

I fell in the darkness, longer than I should. There must have been some sort of cliff I failed to see. I landed on something hard and soft at the same time, I couldnâ€™t see a thing after I dropped my flashlight, I could only smell the terrible putrid stench of death all around me. I could hear dozens of flies buzzing around me, and it made me froze in terror. As my vision focused in the darkness, I could see the hundreds of bodies around me,I had fallen into a mass grave. None of the corpses were complete from what I could tell, and some of them I recognized. Amber and Alex were among the piles of dead and one particular body I could recognize as the park ranger that we had met in the morning. 

I had to swallow my scream as a couple more bodies were thrown into the pile. The creature was actively looking through the pile for any signs of me. I had to play dead until the creature left in defeat. I waited what felt like an eternity until the first rays of light broke through the trees. I felt sick to my stomach as I tried crawling over the dead bodies and out of the pit. I cried for my friends and cried some more when my foot got stuck in one of the bodies.

 It was Mike, and my foot had gone through where his stomach used to be. Eventually, I crawled out of the mass grave and found my way back to the path we originally used to get to our camp site. A few hours of walking, and I reached the visitors center where our vehicles awaited our return. I got into my car and fell into a catatonic state for a few minutes. After I snapped out of it, I drove away as the feeling of still being watched was too overwhelming, as I did a saw a car driving towards the visitors center. A man, a woman, and two young children in the back seat.

 I wish I could say that I stopped and warned them of the impending doom that awaited them... but I drove, I didn't look back.
