I’m 23. Life’s… comfortable, mostly. I’m finishing up my business degree online through ASU. The flexibility works out—keeps my evenings free and gives me time to pick up part-time hours at the garage. I’m engaged, too. Sophia. We met on one of those dating apps I used to make fun of, back when I thought anything worth having had to happen “naturally.” Turns out, timing and honesty matter more than where you meet. She’s grounded. Sharp, kind, quick with a joke that cuts through stress. Somehow, she just gets me.

Everything feels like it’s moving forward. Wedding planning. Saving up. Building a life. For once, it feels like things are lining up the way they should.

Then, out of the blue, my mom calls.

“We should go up to the cabin,” she says, casually, like it’s something we’ve done every year. “Just for the weekend. You should bring Sophia.”

The cabin. I hadn’t thought about that place in years. Not really. I had good memories there—real ones. Summers with my siblings, chasing each other through the pines, fort-building with old lawn chairs and half-broken coolers, s’mores that burned our tongues. It felt like freedom up there. Safe.

But we stopped going. Just… stopped. Around the time my parents started fighting.

I asked if my siblings were coming too—Daren, Eliza, even maybe Sam and his weird guitar he never knew how to tune.

Mom’s voice got quieter. “No, just you and Sophia. Your grandparents will be there. Aunts. Uncles. I’d really like her to meet the family—to get to know our traditions. The ones you missed out on… because of how things went with me and your father.”

She trailed off after that. Left it hanging like it wasn’t meant to sting, but it did.

Still, the idea lingered. Sophia was the one who nudged me toward it. “It could be nice,” she said. “I’d love to see where you grew up, meet everyone. Besides, how bad could a weekend in the woods be?”

I was on the fence. Not because I remembered anything bad. More because… I didn’t remember much at all.There was one summer—I must’ve been three or four. The cousins built a fort around this 

massive tree stump with blankets and camping chairs. I remember laughing. I remember someone telling a ghost story about a smiling tree that followed kids in their dreams. It gave me the creeps, and I left early to go lie down.

And I think I had a dream. I’m not even sure anymore. Something about torches. A circle of people. A huge tree with eyes. But it’s hazy—like a shadow behind frosted glass. I chalked it up to campfire stories mixing with sleep.

After that trip, things changed. Mom and Dad started arguing more. First it was small stuff—who forgot to pay a bill, who left the laundry wet. Then it got heavier. Bigger silences. Door slams. Dad moved out a few months later.

At the time, it just felt like bad luck. Families fall apart. That’s what people said. No one ever pointed to the cabin. No one said anything about the family traditions Mom mentioned. Just... silence. Like whatever was behind it didn’t want to be talked about.

Dad—he never explained much either. But after the divorce, he got quieter whenever Mom’s side came up. If I asked about Grandma or Uncle Reed or even something harmless like the old family tree we had framed in the hallway, his face would shift—just slightly. His jaw would tighten, or he’d change the subject.

And when I told him we weren’t going to the cabin anymore, he didn’t argue. He just nodded like that was probably for the best.

But he stayed in my life. Especially after everything started falling apart. He kept me close, taught me how to fix things—starting with his old truck, then my own. When the A/C in mine went out, we made it our new project. Arizona summers don’t care if you’re broke or busy—if you don’t have A/C, you’re toast.

We were waiting on a part when Mom brought up the trip.

Sophia and I couldn’t take my truck, and her little car wouldn’t survive the dirt roads, so Mom offered to drive. Said she was excited. That it would be “just like old times.”

We loaded up early on a Friday. The roads felt familiar—pine trees swaying, sun cutting through the branches like broken glass. It was almost easy to believe everything was fine.

Halfway up the mountain, my phone buzzed. Dad.

“Hey Jack,” he said. “The part came in. We could fix your A/C tonight if you’re around.”

“Actually,” I said, glancing at Mom, “we’re on our way to the cabin. Just for the weekend.”

There was a pause.

“You’re going to the cabin?” he asked. Not angry. Just… sharper.

“Yeah,” I said, laughing a little. “Don’t worry, it’s nothing. Just Sophia and me and Mom’s side of the family. She wants to show us the old traditions, that sort of thing.”

Another pause. Longer this time.

“Jack,” he said carefully, “if anything feels… off, you leave. You understand?”

I frowned. “What? What’s that supposed to mean?”

But that’s when the bars on my phone started dropping. We were climbing higher. Thicker trees. Less signal.

“I’m serious, Jack,” he said. “You need to—”

The call dropped.

I stared at the screen. No signal.

I looked over at Mom. She didn’t say anything. Just kept driving, eyes forward, hands steady on the wheel. Humming quietly to herself.

And even though everything seemed normal, a strange chill crept up my spine.

I told myself it was just the altitude.

But a voice in the back of my mind whispered something else entirely.

*The Cabin – Arrival

The turnoff onto the forest road felt like crossing into another world. The paved road narrowed into gravel, the trees leaned in closer, and sunlight thinned to gold-tinted slivers between the branches. Sophia leaned forward between the seats, her eyes wide with curiosity as the tires crunched beneath us.

“This is so pretty,” she said, her voice soft, almost reverent. “I didn’t think it’d be this... secluded.”

“It’s even quieter at night,” Mom said from the driver’s seat, smiling without looking back. “No traffic, no lights. You can hear the owls if you’re lucky.”

I didn’t say much. I was watching the road, the bends I used to know by heart. Something about the silence hit different than I remembered—heavier. But that could’ve been the fog of old memories mixing with years of distance.

Then we crested a small hill, and there it was.

The cabin.

Same weathered wood, same sagging porch with the rusted rocking chair. The roof looked recently patched, the windows cleaned. Someone had been taking care of it. That surprised me. I thought it had just been sitting empty all these years.

As we pulled in, a few cars were already parked out front—ones I half-recognized but couldn’t quite place. Older models, big bodies, that lingering smell of gasoline and pine sap when you stood near them.

Mom was the first out. She stretched, hands on her hips, like she’d arrived at the summit of some long-overdue pilgrimage. “Home sweet home,” she said brightly.

Sophia stepped out, turning a slow circle as she took it all in. “This is amazing,” she said. “I see why you loved it here.”

I nodded, forcing a small smile. “Yeah. It was... good, back then.”

And it was. I remembered running barefoot through the grass, hiding behind tree trunks during flashlight tag, laying on the back deck with my siblings and counting stars until we fell asleep under quilts that smelled like bonfire smoke and cedar.

But those memories were shadows now. And my siblings—well, we hadn’t really talked much since the divorce. A few texts here and there. Birthday messages, maybe. It wasn’t anything ugly. Just silence. Space. Like we’d all slowly floated apart and no one bothered to swim back.

Mom opened the trunk. “Let’s get the bags inside. Your grandparents should be back soon—they went to pick up fresh bread from that place in town. You remember the bakery, right?”

I did, but I didn’t answer. I was watching her carefully. She moved with purpose, like everything was already laid out in her mind. A schedule, maybe. A plan. Her enthusiasm felt practiced, like a mask just a little too perfect.

Inside the cabin, it was almost exactly how I remembered. Same living room with its stone fireplace. Same dusty photograph wall of old black-and-white family portraits, the frames arranged like a shrine above the mantle. I recognized faces, but names escaped me. There were more photos now than I remembered. Some new ones I didn’t recognize.

“They added more pictures?” I asked.

Mom glanced up at them. “Oh, just some of the old ones we hadn’t unpacked before. Family history’s important, Jack. Especially now.”

“Why now?”

She didn’t answer.

Sophia was admiring a hand-carved wooden figurine on a shelf. “Did someone make all this?”

“Your great-grandfather,” Mom said proudly. “Almost everything in here was crafted by someone in the family. We believe in remembering where we came from.”

“‘We believe’?” I echoed. The words felt rehearsed.

Mom just smiled. “You’ll see.”

That afternoon passed slowly. Sophia and I unpacked in one of the back rooms while the adults began to arrive. Aunts, uncles, grandparents—people I hadn’t seen in over a decade. They greeted us like we’d never left, all warm smiles and lingering touches on the shoulder, their eyes just a little too watchful.

They asked Sophia questions. About her family, her upbringing. Her interests. Her faith.

“It’s just good to really know who’s coming into the family,” one of my great-aunts said with a smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes.

Sophia handled it well. Better than I would’ve. She charmed them without effort, polite but never overly eager. She made them laugh. Even Mom seemed impressed.

But I couldn’t shake the feeling that the conversations weren’t just polite curiosity. They felt like interviews.

By the time night fell, the sky was bruised purple and the trees around the cabin had melted into silhouettes. Lanterns had been lit around the porch. No one used phones—Grandpa even asked us to leave them in a bowl by the door, “just to disconnect.”

Dinner was long and quiet, the adults talking in low tones, laughing at old jokes I didn’t get. Sophia and I exchanged glances more than once, smiling, but uncertain.

After dishes were cleared and the fire was stoked in the living room hearth, my mom clapped her hands once. “Tomorrow night,” she said, “we’ll be doing something special. A tradition that goes back generations. I think it’s time Jack finally saw what our family really stands for.”

I blinked. “What do you mean?”

She turned to me with that same calm, rehearsed smile. “You’ve always had the “Neumann” name, Jack. But you come from the Millers, too. And the Millers go back farther than any record in this part of the country. This land is ours. These traditions are ours. It’s time you remembered that.”

The room had gone silent.

Even the fire seemed to dim.

And for the first time since we’d arrived, I felt it again—that tug, that faint chill. Like something was watching me from the tree line.

Sophia reached for my hand. Her fingers were warm. Solid.

“It’s okay,” she whispered. “We’re just learning about your roots.”

But I wasn’t so sure.

Because somewhere, deep in my chest, that forgotten dream stirred.

And it wasn’t a dream anymore.

*The Cabin – The Day Before

The smell of sizzling bacon and fresh-baked biscuits pulled me from sleep. For a moment, I forgot where I was. The bed was too firm, the blanket smelled faintly of pine and smoke, and birdsong drifted through a barely cracked window.

Sophia stirred beside me, still tucked beneath the quilt. I leaned over and kissed her forehead, then pulled on some clothes and padded into the hallway.

The kitchen was alive with voices and movement. My mom stood over the stove, humming to herself as she flipped something in a pan. My Aunt Lydia was slicing fruit, and Grandpa and Grandma were laughing about something at the table. It was domestic, warm. Almost... too perfect.

“Morning, sleepyhead!” Mom chirped, turning to me with a bright smile. “We were about to come wake you.”

“Didn’t think you’d still be here,” I said, caught off guard. “Thought you might’ve gone into town or something.”

“Town?” she said with a laugh. “Why would we leave when everyone’s finally together?”

She waved me over. “Come eat. There’s plenty.”

I sat down and accepted a plate piled high with eggs, biscuits, sausage, and some sort of rustic jam I couldn’t identify.

Sophia appeared shortly after, wrapping herself in a shawl as she blinked herself awake. She smiled at the table, maybe trying a little too hard.

Breakfast was good. Conversation buzzed. They asked Sophia about school, her job, how we met. Everyone laughed at the right moments, and it all felt normal—almost aggressively normal. 

But there were glances. Subtle pauses. Times when I caught someone looking at me a moment too long before turning away.

Still, I smiled. I ate. I nodded.

But in the back of my mind, I kept thinking about Dad’s call. His voice. That urgency.

I’d checked my phone the night before—no signal. Of course. This cabin never had Wi-Fi. No satellite dishes. No cell boosters. My mom always said it was about “disconnecting,” about being present and honoring the land. “The old way,” she’d say. “Back when families looked each other in the eye and sat together at dusk.”

Even as a kid, it had always felt a little... forced.

After breakfast, as we cleared dishes, Mom came up behind me and gave my arm a little squeeze.

“You two should take one of the RZRs out,” she said. “Explore a little. You never got to drive one when you were younger, remember?”

I smiled. “You never let me.”

“Well,” she said, brushing imaginary dust off my shoulder, “you’re not a kid anymore. Just don’t go off-path. You know how deep the woods can get.”

Sophia beamed. “That sounds amazing.”

Half an hour later, we were geared up and strapped into the RZR, winding our way through the pine-lined trails. The cool air bit at our cheeks as the engine growled beneath us. I let Sophia take the first turn driving—she was a speed demon, apparently—and I watched the trees blur by, my thoughts drifting.

It felt good. For a moment, it felt like childhood again—only better, because now I was in control.

We came across a narrow creek, its water glittering in the sun. We stopped to rest, climbed down the embankment, skipped stones for a while. I pulled out my phone, even though I knew it was useless. Still no bars. But I wanted to take pictures—of the trail, the creek, the trees.

And then I saw it.

On a nearby pine, half-hidden behind bark and moss, was a carving. A crooked cross-like symbol, etched deep into the wood.

“Sophia,” I called.

She came over and studied it. “What is that?”

“I don’t know. I’ve seen something like it before, I think. Maybe in an old book or… maybe just in the back of my head.”

I snapped a photo.

We kept riding, quieter now. A few more times, we spotted the same symbol—some alone, some in groups. Always carved clean, like it was done with a fresh blade. Always old.

Eventually, we looped back to the cabin. Before we even reached the clearing, I saw my grandpa standing on the porch, waiting. His posture was relaxed, but his eyes were sharp.

We parked and climbed out. He smiled at Sophia, then turned to me.

“You two have fun?”

“Yeah,” I said, trying to sound casual.

He glanced at my pocket. “You bring your phone out there?”

I froze for a half-second. “Yeah, just to take some pictures.”

“Phones don’t work out here,” he said. Not angry. Just... pointed.

“No signal, yeah. I just wanted to get some shots.”

His smile returned, but his eyes didn’t soften. “Be careful with what you keep. Some things aren’t meant to be captured.”

Sophia and I exchanged a look, both of us uneasy.

Later that evening, she pulled me aside near the back porch. The sky was dimming, stars starting to blink in.

“Something’s off, Jack,” she whispered. “I’ve been trying to shrug it off, but… I don’t know. It’s just this feeling.”

I nodded. “I’ve felt it too. I didn’t want to freak you out.”

“Weird symbols, everyone acting just a little too… perfect. Like they’re rehearsing a version of themselves.”

“And my dad tried to call me before we got here,” I added. “Tried to warn me. I didn’t tell you ‘cause—”

“You thought I’d think you were being paranoid.”

“Yeah.”

We stood there for a while, watching the woods, saying nothing. The wind rustled the trees like whispers.


That night, just before dinner, my phone buzzed again in my pocket.

One bar.

My chest tightened. I pulled it out fast and saw it—a missed call from Dad. And this time… a voicemail.

I moved away from the kitchen, where everyone was laughing and setting dishes on the table. Sophia glanced up from the silverware and caught my eyes. I gave her a quick nod and slipped out the back door onto the porch, the screen door creaking behind me.

I hit play.

His voice came through low and crackling, like he was speaking through a storm.

“Jack—listen to me. You need to leave. I didn’t want to scare you before, but they’re not telling you the truth. Your mom’s side, her family… there are things they do up there. Things I tried to keep you away from. You need to be smart. You need to stay close to Sophia. And whatever you do, don’t—”

The message cut out. Nothing but static.

Then silence.

I stared down at the phone. No bars.

Of course.

The door creaked behind me again.

“You get a call?” Grandpa’s voice was soft. Almost too soft.

I turned and saw him standing in the doorway, hands in his pockets, just watching.

“Reception must’ve flickered,” he said, stepping out next to me. “This land’s funny that way. Doesn’t care for outsiders much.”

“Just my dad,” I said, pocketing the phone quickly. “Didn’t say much.”

He nodded slowly, then patted my shoulder once—too firm. “Dinner’s almost ready. Wouldn’t want to miss your last meal as just a visitor.”

I wasn’t sure what that meant, and I didn’t like the way he said it.

Inside, the table was packed with food. Meats, stews, root vegetables soaked in something dark and syrupy. My mom greeted us with a smile that felt a little too wide, too bright, like she was hosting a dinner party that wasn’t really about food at all.

Everyone was dressed a little nicer tonight. Even the old ones who usually wore tattered flannel had swapped it for black robes draped over their shoulders.

After dinner, my mom stood up and cleared her throat.

“We’d like to welcome Sophia into our traditions,” she said, her eyes warm but fixed, “and pass on the history of this land to Jack.”

My skin prickled.

Two of my uncles stepped forward with folded robes in their arms and handed one to me and one to Sophia. A necklace dangled from the collar—roughly carved wood, the strange cross shape we’d seen etched into trees earlier. I hadn’t said it aloud.

Sophia looked at me, her face pale.

“Go on,” Mom urged softly. “Put it on. This is your birthright, Jack. Your future.”

I didn’t move.

Then one of my uncles—Joel, I think—stepped up with a long hunting knife resting flat in his palm.

“You’re not gonna go against your bloodline now, are you?”

The threat was hidden behind a smile, but it hit me hard.

Sophia and I exchanged a look. She was scared—I could see it now, even if she was trying to hide it. But we put the robes on, slowly. The necklaces too.

The carved wood felt heavy against my chest, like it pulsed with heat.

They led us out into the woods, torches held high, their voices hushed as we walked. Not solemn—more reverent. I could feel it in the way they moved, like they were approaching something holy.

The clearing was just how I remembered it from my dream. Circle of trees. Blackened soil. Stones surrounding an empty center.

But there was no tree with eyes this time. Just a patch of open ground… waiting.

Then I heard dragging.

From the trees, two of my uncles emerged, pulling someone by the arms. A man—gagged, tied, squirming weakly against the ropes. His eyes were wide with terror.

“What the heck is this?” I snapped, heart pounding.

No one answered.

“Mom!” I yelled. “What is this?!”

She didn’t speak. None of them did.

They placed the man in the center and began to circle him.

I couldn’t take it anymore.

I shoved past my grandpa and sprinted forward, grabbing the man’s shoulder. “ I don't know what this is but We’re not doing this! Are you all insane?!”

I knelt and started pulling at the knots.

“They’ve lost their minds,” I muttered. “We’re getting you out of here—”

Behind me, I heard the first low notes of a song.

Melodic. Haunting. Voices rising like a prayer.

“No, no, no—stop that!” I shouted, turning to the circle. “You’re all freaking crazy!”

They didn’t stop.

I turned back to the man, and that’s when the trees began to creak.

All around us. Not from wind—but like something massive was leaning against them. Moving through them.

Sophia screamed.

I looked up—and froze.

From the shadows between the trees stepped a figure. Seven feet tall. Tattered black clothes clinging to a long, narrow frame. A crooked top hat perched atop a bald, ash-colored head. His skin looked dry, cracked—like burnt paper. His grin was too wide, too clean, too straight.

And his eyes… pure white. Glowing like frost in moonlight.

I then heard in the whisperings of the song “Trossilus.”

He stepped into the circle with a creaking whoosh, head tilting like he was sniffing the air.

Everyone else dropped to their knees, heads bowed, hoods covering their eyes.

Sophia was hysterical behind me, crying, trying to run but unable to move.

The Trossilus walked toward me—and stopped.

Its smile twitched.

It glanced at my chest. The necklace.

It hissed softly, then turned, sJacking up the tied man like a sack.

“No!” I screamed, lunging.

With a flick, it swung the man like a club and slammed me backward. I hit the ground hard, vision swimming.

I blinked up just in time to see the creature raise the man high.

A clear third eyelid slid back from its eyes, revealing something deeper—something that shimmered.

The man in its grip went limp. Like the very life had been sucked from him without a touch.

Still grinning, the Trossilus turned toward the woods.

And with one loud, creaking whoosh—it was gone.

Swallowed by the trees.

The song faded.

And silence took over again.

Only this time, it was heavier. Permanent.

Because now we knew it was all real. And we were in it.

Worse—we might already be too deep to escape.

I don’t know how long I laid there, staring at the spot where the Trossilus vanished.

The clearing was still. Too still. Like the forest was holding its breath, waiting to see what we’d do.

Sophia was the first to move. She stumbled toward me, her robe dragging in the dirt, eyes wide and brimming with tears. Her voice cracked when she spoke.

“Jack,” she whispered, grabbing my face. “Jack—we have to go. Now.”

I sat up slowly, head spinning, ribs aching where the man’s body had slammed into me. The necklace dug into my chest like it was trying to warn me—don’t take me off. Don’t forget.

I looked around.

My family… they were rising to their feet. Slowly. Calmly. Like this had all gone exactly the way they expected. My mom’s hood was still up, but I could see her face beneath it—wet with tears, yes, but not sorrowful.

Reverent.

“You saw him,” she said softly. “You felt him.”

“You’re all insane,” I spat, my voice shaking.

My grandfather stepped forward, brushing dirt from his robes. “You should be honored, Jack. He acknowledged you. He saw your bloodline.”

I grabbed Sophia’s hand and backed away. “We’re leaving.”

“You can’t.” That was Uncle Joel again—still holding the knife, now pointed casually at his side. “You’re part of this now.”

I tightened my grip on Sophia. “Like heck we are.”

We turned and ran.

Branches whipped at our robes as we tore through the woods, slipping and stumbling in the dark. Somewhere behind us, I could hear shouts—my name, commands, someone yelling to cut us off near the cabin.

Sophia didn’t speak. She just ran. Her sobs came sharp and fast, broken by gasps and curses. We were both shaking, breath coming in short panicked bursts, hearts pounding like war drums in our chests.

The cabin came into view, the porch lights still glowing.

We sprinted up the steps, slammed the door, and locked it behind us. I dropped to my knees by the hallway cabinet and yanked open drawers, tossing aside maps and old batteries.

“Where are they,” I muttered. “Where the heck are the keys?”

Sophia pulled open the drawer by the kitchen. “They’re not here—they took them, Jack—they took our dang keys!”

“No,” I growled, storming into the guest bedroom. “There’s a spare. There has to be—”

Voices outside. Footsteps on the porch.

I ripped open the dresser, and there it was. A spare car key on a tarnished key ring. I grabbed it and ran back to Sophia.

“They’re coming,” she whispered, pointing to the window. Shapes moved outside. Lanterns. Hoods.

I grabbed the duffel we’d brought in, shoved our phones, wallets, and charger inside—anything we could find—and flung the front door open.

“Go!” I shouted, grabbing Sophia’s arm as we bolted toward the truck.

Someone lunged from the bushes. Uncle Joel.

He tackled me hard, knife flashing up—and I reacted before I could think.

I smashed the flashlight in my hand against his head. He crumpled with a grunt.

Sophia screamed, and I looked up to see Grandpa trying to grab her robe. She twisted, yanked it off, and kicked him in the gut. He fell to one knee, coughing.

We got to the truck. I jammed the key into the ignition, hands slick with sweat. The engine roared to life.

“Go, go, go!” Sophia shouted.

I floored it.

We tore down the dirt road, tires kicking up gravel behind us. I didn’t look back—but I could hear them yelling. Running after us. Fading into the trees.

The headlights lit up the path ahead. Narrow. Twisting. Unfamiliar in the dark.

Sophia was crying. Not loudly—just quietly, like her body didn’t know what else to do.

“What was that,” she whispered. “What was that thing, Jack? It was real. That thing was real.”

“I know,” I said. My voice was flat. Hollow. “I wish we hadn’t come here.”

The forest blurred past us in streaks of black and gray. The Miller land stretched out for miles, and I didn’t know when we’d hit the highway—but I wasn’t stopping until I saw signs, other cars, something normal again.

Something human.

I glanced in the rearview mirror. Nothing but trees.

And for a second—a split second—I swore I saw a glint of white eyes between them.

Watching.

Waiting.

It’s been a week since we got out.

I still don’t know how we made it. Sophia and I wake up most nights in a cold sweat, our ears straining for that creaking sound in the woods, for footsteps in the hall, for that song. The one that won’t leave our heads.

But I’m writing this now—not just for us. For anyone out there who’s ever heard whispers about the Miller land. For anyone who’s ever thought their family secrets were just old ghost stories.

They’re not.

My family—my mom’s side—is part of a cult. I used to think that word was extreme, a label people threw around too easily. But it’s real. It’s the only word that fits. The Millers have been worshiping something ancient called the Trossilus for generations. Sophia and I saw it.

Seven feet tall. Skin like charred stone. Glowing white eyes. Tattered black robes. A top hat that somehow made it worse. It grinned like it was wearing someone else’s face. We watched it take a man. Lifted him like nothing. Looked inside him. And took his soul.

My family didn’t scream. They didn’t cry. They sang.

When Sophia and I escaped, we were wrecked. But I called my dad. And that’s when I learned the real truth.

He told me something that changed everything.

That “dream” I had when I was little—the one I’d always remembered in flashes and nightmares—it wasn’t a dream. It happened, And my dad filled me in on the parts I had forgotten.

I’d wandered into the woods during one of the Miller rituals. I was only four. I don’t even remember walking out there. Maybe I was drawn to the fire, or the sound, or maybe the Trossilus itself wanted me to see. I remember the flames, the shadows, the robes… and its eyes. yes.

It saw me. It stepped toward me.

I would’ve been taken. But my dad—Gosh, my dad—he ran into that circle, risked everything, and scooped me up just before it could reach me. He held me tight, and he said he felt this strange warmth, this burn around his neck. It was the wooden cross necklace. The one the Millers use during the rituals. It was pressed between us. That symbol, whatever power it held, stopped the Trossilus.

That was the moment it all changed.

That was the night my dad finally broke. The night he stopped pretending he was just part of the family. The night he said enough. He fought with my mom. He tried to take me and my siblings away right then, but they kept him from leaving—threats, lies, pressure. It took years, but eventually, he got out. And he made her let me stay with him.

He’s been protecting me from the Millers ever since.

Before he left, he stole a locked chest from the old Miller shed. Inside was a journal. Old, cracked leather, stained and falling apart. It belonged to one of the first settlers of the land—Arthur Miller. And later, his brother, Edward Miller. The man who made the original blood pact with the Trossilus. The journal is filled with disturbing entries—desperate prayers, ritual instructions, and accounts of the first “offerings.” It started with livestock. Then, the Trossilus demanded more.

And they gave in.

Every generation since, they’ve sacrificed people to this thing in exchange for “peace,” “protection,” and the promise of a cursed kind of legacy. My family’s entire history is built on blood.

I have the journal now.

My dad gave it to me. Told me to make sure the truth came out.

So that’s what I’m going to do.

I’m going to transcribe it—every page. Every word. And I’m going to post it online for everyone to read. Because people need to know. The rituals. The symbols. The signs. The warnings. Maybe others have seen things like this. Maybe there are other families like the Millers. Other names. Other monsters. If we stay silent, it grows.

Sophia and I are working with the police now. We’ve already been warned how deep the Millers’ roots run. The sheriff in that town? Cousin. The county clerk? Married into the family. We know it won’t be easy. But we’re not giving up.

The Trossilus feeds on secrecy. On fear. On tradition twisted into something evil. But we’re done hiding. Done running.

We’re dragging this thing into the light.

If you’re reading this, stay away from Miller land. Don’t go near the trees. And if you hear a song in the dark?

Run.
