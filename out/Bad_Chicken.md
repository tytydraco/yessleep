The tree was ancient. Older than the village, older than the first settlers who arrived on bullock carts and mules, seeking to carve out new lives, older than the stars themselves if you believed Granny. And I did. It was enormous, its gnarled trunk twisting like a coiled serpent, draped in a suffocating cloak of vines and leaves thick enough to rival a small forest. No bird or squirrel dared to make their home within its shadowy branches. When I was seventeen, I learned why.

Every month, on the night of the full moon, a single family was chosen to conduct an elaborate *puja* beneath the tree. The ceremony required sweets, vermillion, sacred red and yellow threads, and most crucially, a live chicken. From my first experience of the ritual, it was clear that while families could economize on everything else, the chicken had to be perfect. Local birds were pampered, fed the best grain, and allowed to roam freely. Broiler chickens were strictly forbidden, and wealthier families like the Chatterjees paid a hefty premium to import Kadaknath roosters from Kolkata. The better and richer the bird, the more successful the ritual.

The *puja* itself was straightforward, at least on the surface. The chosen family would proceed from their home to the tree in a solemn, single file, accompanied by the steady, rhythmic beat of pipes and drums. They'd sit cross-legged, heads bowed, while the family patriarch recited age-old prayers passed down through generations. The trunk of the tree would be anointed with vermillion, threads tied delicately to the lowest hanging branch, and then the chicken’s throat would be slit with a sharp, small blade. Its blood would pool at the roots, seeping into the soil as if it were drinking greedily. The patriarch would dip three fingers into the crimson puddle, sprinkling drops onto the trunk, and then the family would rise, offer the sweets as a token, and return home.

There were two unbreakable rules. First, no one was to look up at the tree's boughs while the ritual was in progress. Second, once it was done and the worshipers were leaving, no one was to glance back at the offerings and the lifeless body lying on the roots. Breaking these rules, they said, would invite untold misfortune upon the family—dark, mystical, and irreversible.

The few times it fell upon my family to perform the *puja*, I did follow the instructions to keep my eyes pinned to the bark but it was all I could to avoid slapping at my neck, which something rough and filament-like brushed now and then. I was certain of something watching me, watching all of us, from the shadowy branches. But I didn't dare look up. In Indian villages, curses and forbidden rules are taken a bit more strictly regardless of how modern you are.

“What lives on the tree?” I often asked Granny as she rubbed coconut oil into my locks.

“Nobody knows *baba*,” she would reply, chewing on her areca nut and betel leaf preparation. “It has stood there since before my great grandfather's time. Some say there is a spirit at the top, an angry, hungry spirit.”

Spirit or not, as the years passed and I grew up, my curiosity only thickened. I would spend an hour every afternoon hanging around the tree, trying to glean some arcane secret from its silent, dark green facade. It just stared back at me stolidly, marked by years of blood sacrifice and frayed threads. Generations of villagers had prayed here for rain, good crops, healthy calves and protection. Many believed an aspect of Kali resided within its scarred bole. 

One frigid winter, it was our turn once more to perform the *puja*. Baba called me to him and fished out a five-hundred rupee note. “Go to Karim and get a healthy rooster.”

I nodded, stuffing the note into my pocket, but as I headed down the winding road towards the bazaar, a different idea began to form. The new bakery had opened up just last week, and I could almost taste the greasy, flaky mutton patties they were famous for. Besides, it wasn’t like anyone would notice if the rooster was a little... less than perfect, right?

When I arrived at Karim’s, the shop was buzzing with activity. Chickens clucked nervously in their cages, their beady eyes darting around the room, while the butcher’s knife glinted under the dim yellow light. Karim barely glanced up as I walked in. “Ah, back again?” he said, wiping his hands on his stained apron. “Got a good batch today. Take your pick.”

I pretended to inspect the birds, lifting a few by their wings, checking their feathers and weight, just like I’d seen my father do. But my mind wasn’t really on the task. I eventually settled on a rooster that looked decent enough—still feisty, but with a slight droop to its comb that suggested it wasn’t the healthiest. I knew it wouldn’t pass my father’s scrutiny, but I could save a good hundred rupees this way. Maybe more if I haggled a bit.

“Not this one, Karim. It’s too expensive,” I said, feigning indifference. “I’ll take it if you knock off fifty.”

Karim raised an eyebrow. “That one? It’s not the best bird I have, you know.”

“Exactly,” I replied. “Which is why you can give it to me for less.”

He sighed, muttering something under his breath about kids these days, but eventually relented. I handed over the cash, pocketed the change, and set off to the bakery. I felt a rush of giddy rebellion as I bit into the steaming, flaky patty, savouring the rich, spiced mutton. I even splurged on a pack of cigarettes, slipping one between my lips as I strolled back to the village, the cold air prickling against my skin.

By the time I got home, my father was waiting in the courtyard, his arms crossed. He took the rooster from me, holding it up to the light, turning it this way and that. His eyes narrowed as he inspected it, and for a moment, my heart leapt into my throat. But then he just sighed, shaking his head. “Looks a bit scrawny,” he said. “But it’ll do.”

The night was colder than usual. Durga Puja had just ended, and the October air seemed intent on freezing my very bones as we set out from the house. Ma, Baba, Dida, my little sister Mithi, and me—guilty, with the faint smell of smoke clinging to my jacket. I had absorbed the essence of Gold Flake earlier, huddled in the backyard.

The tree loomed out of the fog like a monolith of terror, skeletal branches reaching desperately for the sky, leaves rustling softly in the wind. We quickly lit a series of *diyas*, placing them around the roots for meagre warmth and a flicker of light. Baba began chanting the mantras, and we stood with our palms clasped, eyes dutifully lowered, not daring to look up. But my other senses remained firmly tuned to the branches above.

There it was again—that prickling on the back of my neck, the unmistakable sensation of being watched. Strands of something brushed against my skin, and at one point, I could have sworn a drop of warm liquid splashed onto my head. I swatted at it, but my hand met only empty air.

The rooster clucked nervously, its wings flapping as Baba gripped it tightly in one fist. With a quick, practised motion, he slit its throat using a Thermocol cutter. Blood gushed out, thick and sticky, drenching the trunk and seeping into the roots. Baba circled the tree, dragging the twitching carcass in a wide, crimson arc before tossing it aside.

“Come, time to go,” he said, his voice sharp in the cold night air.

We turned and hurried away, legs moving as fast as they could without breaking into a sprint. I strained my ears, listening for anything out of place, but there was nothing—just the bristling of branches and the sighing of a sudden breeze.

Dinner that night was quiet, almost sombre. Baba looked distracted, while Mithi complained of a mild headache, and Ma took her to bed halfway through the meal. I forced down the watery fish curry with potatoes and then retreated to my room at the far end of the house. Sleep, however, remained elusive.

I must have managed to drift off for a few hours when the sound of shattering glass jolted me awake. My heart pounded as I fumbled for the light switch, only to find there was no electricity. But in the pale, eerie glow of the gibbous moon, I could see it clearly—a heap on the floor beneath the broken window.

It was a dead rooster. Partially devoured, stringy flesh hanging from cracked, sucked-clean bones.

Horror clutched my heart. It was a naked, alien terror. Was someone playing a prank on me? I stooped and touched the carcass with trembling fingers. The flesh looked like it had been set upon by sharp teeth, but teeth that did not belong to a dog or cat. I knew something about bite marks given my rural upbringing. 

Something brushed against the back of my neck, light as a whisper. I froze, muscles locking in place, my heart hammering so loudly it drowned out everything else. The realization sank in like a stone sinking through dark water—there was another presence in the room with me. Something huge, lurking just out of sight.

I had to break the age-old taboo. I had to look up. I looked up.

She unfurled from the ceiling like a dark, twisted bloom, her hair spilling in a tangled, endless curtain that brushed the floor. Black fur bristled along her muscular arms, claws digging effortlessly into the wood, and her eyes—those sickly yellow eyes—glowed from behind the curtain, watching me with a hunger that tightened my chest. Her lips stretched into a grin too wide, revealing rows of jagged, needle-like teeth. 

The creature pointed at the rooster.

“Bad chicken,” she rasped.
