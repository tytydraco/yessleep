I remember the summer before fifth grade. I was generally excited about the upcoming school year. After all, they say, or said, fifth grade was supposed to be the best year of elementary school. It was the year when everything was bigger and bigger.

However, once I entered fifth grade, I realized the year was going to be a lot different than expected. To quickly summarize, it was miserable. It was miserable because I did not belong. 

A person cannot really comprehend what it feels like to be outcasted by their peers until he or she has experienced it. In fifth grade I didn't appear, act, or dress the "right" way. My more "sensible" fifth grade peers judged me as weird and that meant I was punished. A problem with elementary school socialization is it's so tightly knit. I had gone to camp before and made friends, but summer camp was more of a lawless land socially, while elementary school had strict laws.

There is nothing on Earth like the gnawing dread an ostracized child might feel when the teacher calls out for everyone to find a partner. No one gives a glance at you as they run off to calling friends. Sure, I had my fifteen seconds of fame once or twice that year, where people would look at me like a bit of an "enigma" as opposed to "reject", someone interesting to talk to as long as no one saw you!

My refuge was any place that wasn't school, mainly home, where I was reading and drawing and TV-watching and of course, Internet-ing, all the time. I didn't have a friend to do social activities with, except the occasional people I talked to on the internet. Especially when I got home at 4 and the Internet hadn't quite woken up for the night yet... It was lonely.

Today I can talk about everything that happened later easily, even to Reddit, ha. I just feel like it's time to get my message out there that anyone can do it. Anyone can make it to an enjoyable, pleasant life, even if your life sucks right now. I promise. In return for the memories, I am more insightful, I know more about having a pleasant face (having learned from negative experience). One that can literally convince someone to come into a random person's basement hahhaa. Ok, still a little proud of that.

I am also now stronger than I would have been. I learned a lot of skills that made their deaths more pleasant. I still wanted to see these 6 people (the ones I could bring in) feel what I felt, OK? Is that so bad? Honestly, I realized then and realize now they were adults, now. So revenge would be a pretty stupid concept to enact all these years later.

But it wasn't about revenge, and I hope you, Reddit, won't judge me too much. I bet a lot of them probably felt bad or would have if I had told them why I was making them do what they did (I was not expecting it to be that easy but then again they had literally just lost 4 limbs). It was just something that had to happen. And maybe it was funny in a way hearing them them pick the 5 people to die, but the point is no one escapes judgment, even if it's unfair.

Unexpectedly, it was so boring watching them debate and pick someone. You know, it was my ex-wife who got me thinking about all this when she left. How life was unfair. It really got me thinking, okay? She was not being her best self. Anyway, in the end they picked the kind of older mother of 3.

So obviously I walked over and slit her throat and honestly it was... I can't believe they didn't expect anything else. Oh, okay, you're locked in this room by someone and just got your arms and legs cut off and you think that person ISN'T going to torture you by tricking you? But anyway I did the whole monologue I'd done with some improvements from the last time, and explained to them that they had been right the whole time. There was such a thing as fair judgment. And I was doing them in a favor in a way if you thought about it. I wanted to give them the gift of knowledge (lol) and show them what that was like. Then, they could go out into the world knowing this know. The looks on their faces was priceless. I tricked them AGAIN. Not one of them thought maybe I wouldn't want to go to jail forever... I can't

Ultimately I didn't have to work to make their deaths pleasant at all; I just asked them to figure it out themselves and they took care of it themselves :) It was that woman with 2 kids who was a nurse so she tried to think of the best way to go about this.

So anyway it turned out she couldn't think of anything that wouldn't be still somewhat painful for all of them. I felt bad, so get this Reddit, I actually went and realized I had some extra cyanide lying around from last time. It was... well, it did suck watching them all cry. Who enjoys watching people cry? Oh, right, they did :P

The word escaped from my lips, "You," as the life of the last one (the nurse who sucked at thinking of non-painful death solutions) left her eyes, all for me.

I don't know why I spoke aloud? I guess I just wanted her to realize I was a person.

So anyway, what I came here to say in the first place is this. If I could talk to someone who is feeling the wrath of his or her elementary school peers right now, I would give them a huge hug and assure them that everything will be okay. I would tell them that they should not change who they are no matter what AND they just need to be strong, they need to be patient, and they need to remember to laugh. Those people didn't laugh long hahhaha but I feel a little bit bad even now and I want to honor their memories by spreading my TED talk. Thanks for listening :)
