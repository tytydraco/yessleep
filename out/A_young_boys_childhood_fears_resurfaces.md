"There was a monster underneath my bed!"

Back when I was still young and naive, this single sentence would haunt the whole of my family because it guaranteed a sleepless night for my mom or dad or whoever that was unfortunate enough to be sleeping in the master bedroom. I could only imagine what my parent would have felt like when their tensed up child wobbled into their room, huddling a thick sheet of blanket and begging for company as behind their compassionate and reassuring smile there must have been hatred and agony that have slowly built up over each one of those sleepless nights.  As for me, before I even decide to leap out of my bed and make a "run for it", I would always imagine that as long as the monster is not in sight I am safe. This meant that sealing my head with my pillow would be the optimal solution and this strategy will work until curiosity 

"Max! I choose him." An agonizing scream echoed throughout our doubled-storied house ,waking me up from my slumber. This deafening and pitiful scream struck me by surprise; only someone who has suffered so much could let out a scream this painful. Swinging open the door to my bedroom, the floorboard beneath me creaked as the multiple footsteps I made in such a short period of time gave it pressure it has never felt before. I navigated along the hallways, down the stairs and then through the living room while also continuously calling out her name until I saw her knees bent on the ground and sobbing. "What happened! Did you call me or what?"

She finally had the courage to stare up at me now , putting her plump red face on full display. It was evident that something has happened to her yet she was extremely reluctant to spit the information out, judging from her trembling face. Grabbing a cold one from the fridge, she settled down on the stool with her back bent and started sipping away as the tears trickled down like raindrops. "Max. I cannot tell you what happened... it is for my own safety."

"Why? I am your son."

"Oh why? I am not really sure but all I know is that he will get very mad. All I can tell you is that I have made a deal and your life may be in danger."

Her way of speaking. Too quiet. It was too questionable to the point where I though she was just playing with me!

"You have to tell me what happened Ma." I scoffed and then chuckled. It was not unusual for my mother to stay up late and lucid dream in the kitchen.

"All I can tell you son is that I saw an hooded figure that lacked human features. Just watch out, okay. My mind might have been playing tricks on me." She left me a final piece of advice before asking me to leave. Before going back upstairs, I looked back once more. From afar, she really looks like another shady yet trustworthy alcoholic just sitting there minding their own business ,and you could never tell what they are thinking about every time they pick up their bottle of beer.

I woke up again to the noise of my father's complaints as apparently he has not slept very well like me however I do not see the same fear in his eyes compared to my mom's. I should have listened to her now thinking back. Putting on my clothes and getting ready for a day of school has been normal but everything took a turn for the worst after 7pm after the final call was made for all remaining students to leave the facility.

I slotted my books into my bag that looks as if it has gone through more physical damage and trauma than a retired war veteran and paced down the concrete stairs into the ceramic-tiled pathway that lead to the exit gate of this medieval fortress of a school. 

Our school is isolated and located near a suburban area that requires a 50 minute bus ride to where I live and unfortunately, buses have recently stopped service near this area meaning that I had to make my way towards an active station near me. 

The air outside was foggy and I could barely see anything today. Pressing on forward, pairs of headlights came and went until I reached my destination where I settled myself down on the metallic bench.

“Where was I?” I could barely make sense of my surroundings when the sudden rustling of leaves above me suddenly alerted me. In the distance, something dark lurked amongst the shadows. Its 2 sets of yellow, gleaming eyes made me jolt back in fear. Was this who my mother warned me about? My stomach made a grumbling noise after such distress and it was not until the bus came when the figure disappeared into the misty fog. I just wanted to forget about everything that has happened by now — I feel like the thoughts are now also haunting my poor soul.

 After stepping into the air-conditioned bus, I could not wait to get home and collapse on my cushiony bed. Navigating through the curves of the uneven road, my head shaked rhythmically to the sways. The vehicle pathed its way slowly as there was only me and another woman who I supposed was the driver’s wife; the whole surrounding was eerily quiet and an air of tranquility filled my presence.

“Why did you come back so late today?” questioned my mom. I gave him the classic “I’ll respond later” stare before falling face down on my cushion as I pulled my phone out. In a blink of an eye; it was already night time. “Bang!” A loud crack upstairs awoke me from my nap. I promised myself that I would finish my homework and then sleep however everything feels so fucked up and convoluted especially when there is only my mother around me with my father departed for a business trip. It was not long before a familiar sound engulfed our flat in pitiful screams.

I froze. The scream pierced through the silence of the night like a sharp knife, sending shivers down my spine. My body, still half-asleep, hesitated before forcing itself off the bed. My legs felt heavy, almost as if something was trying to hold me down, but I pushed forward.

I rushed out of my room, my heart pounding against my chest. The wooden floor creaked under my weight as I sprinted towards the source of the noise. The dimly lit hallway stretched ahead, each shadow appearing darker and more menacing than before.

“Ma!” I called out, my voice breaking slightly. “Are you okay?”

No response.

I reached the doorway of my mother’s room and hesitated before stepping inside. The room was dark, save for the faint glow of the moonlight filtering through the curtains. My eyes darted around, trying to adjust. And then I saw her.

She was standing near the window, her back turned to me. Her posture was rigid, her breathing uneven. It was as if she was frozen in fear.

“Ma?” I whispered, stepping closer.

She turned around slowly, and for a brief moment, I thought something was wrong with her face. Her eyes looked distant, unfocused, as if she was staring at something beyond me. A tear rolled down her cheek, and she swallowed hard before speaking.

“It’s here,” she muttered under her breath.

“What?” I asked, my throat suddenly dry.

“The thing I saw last night… it’s here,” she repeated, her voice trembling.

I felt a chill crawl up my spine. The memory of those glowing yellow eyes from earlier flashed through my mind. Was it the same thing? Was it really here?

Someone—something—was inside.

I reached for my phone, my fingers trembling as I tried to dial for help. No signal. My mother, now fully sobbing, gripped my arm.

“It’s too late,” she murmured.

I didn’t want to believe her. I couldn’t. I had to do something.

A shadow moved past the doorway. My breath hitched.

The air turned ice-cold.

And then—darkness.
