You won't find the town of Reficul, Pennsylvania on any maps, new or old. You won't find any mention of it in any old newspaper articles in the Pennsylvania libraries. Nor will you find even the faintest whisper of it in any state or county records. There's no mention of it in any official government documents, no census reports or tax records or land surveys. Neither will you find any hint that any of the 478 men, women and children who allegedly once inhabited the town ever lived.

It is a town that for all intents and purposes doesn't exist and never did.

But it does.

Ask the younger people who live in the neighboring towns about Reficul and you'll be met with either a blank stare of ignorance or a mocking laugh or an eye-roll of annoyance. But ask the *older* residents and you'll get a different reaction altogether. Sometimes they become defensive, even outright belligerent, and flatly dismiss Reficul as a "legend" and a "superstition." Others will deny any knowledge and say they've never heard of the town...but you'll see a different truth in their fearful eyes.

But there are a few who are willing to talk, if you ask them the right way. People who were young when the town supposedly disappeared back in the mid 1970s. People who claim to have even *been* there, and some even attest that they once had friends or relatives who lived in Reficul.

Ask, and they'll tell you the stories.  If you're brave enough to listen.

A rural farming village located in northeast Pennsylvania, the town was purported to have claimed 478 souls in the census of 1970. But by November of 1976, it claimed none. Every one of its 478 inhabitants vanished off the face of the earth one dark November night, never to be seen again.

And not just the people.

The *entire town itself.*

All the homes and farms and shops and businesses that once lined its streets (along with the streets themselves), every bench and lamppost and stoplight and stop sign, every outbuilding and field, every pet and farm animal and head of livestock...

Gone. Vanished overnight, leaving only empty, unblemished open country. As if nothing had ever been there at all.

You would logically think that the sudden inexplicable disappearance of a - literally - entire town would cause a stir in the neighboring communities. That a media storm would follow, along with the intervention of state and government authorities who would launch a full-scale investigation.

But you would be wrong.

The vanishing of Reficul, Pennsylvania in November, 1976 didn't cause even the slightest ripple with the surrounding towns or attract the attention of the media and the State Police and FBI.

Life went on in its normal rhythm, undisturbed by the unexplained mass disappearance of 478 human beings.

Because, no matter who you ask, no matter how many county officials or courthouse records clerks or local historians or state authorities or retired reporters you interrogate, the answer will never deviate.

*The town of Reficul never existed.*

As if not only had the town itself had been erased from the land, but also the *memory of it* from the minds of man.

But a few people *do* remember the town, or say they do. People who would have been very young when Reficul ceased to exist in 1976; children and teenagers and even a few who had been in their early twenties . Young people who swore adamantly that the town had once been there, whose wild assertions were met with scorn and disbelief and ridicule. Who were dismissed as charlatans and lunatics later in life by younger generations, who nevertheless adopted the outlandish claims of their elders and took them for their own, adapting and embellishing them into ghost stories to scare each other at campfires. Legends and rumors that no one took seriously.

What happened to the town, assuming that it *had* once been real, that fall night nearly forty-seven long years ago?

Everyone who knows the story has their speculation. The younger people will tell you that it was the work of aliens or some nefarious secret government experiment that went horribly wrong.

The older people who claim to remember the town have their own beliefs. Legends and rumors that the original founders of Reficul had been "practitioners  of the dark arts" that had fled persecution during the Salem Witch Trials to settle a township in the wilderness further south in the late 1600s. Rumors of dark rites and rituals that had been secretly carried on by the townspeople from one generation to the next, right into the middle of the Twentieth Century. Rumors of  unholy ceremonies involving orgies and incest and the sacrifice of newborn infants to ensure the town's prosperity.

It doesn't matter which story you believe. It doesn't matter where the truth lies or what truly happened to the town that cold, dark night in November 1976. Whether it was the work of aliens or demons or the wrath of vengeful God or any of the other dozens of wild theories.

All that truly matters is that *none* of it matters because it's just a foolish local legend. A ghost story for the kids and the unhinged ramblings of the senile and demented.

The town of Reficul, Pennsylvania, former population of 478, does not and never did exist.

But it does.

I know, because I've seen it with my own eyes.

I've been there.

And you can see it too, if you're brave enough.

Or mad enough.

But I warn you in advance that you might be getting more than your bargain for. Some things are best left unknown. And some places are best left forgotten.

You still want to know?

Alright. I'll tell you.

But please, follow my instructions specifically and overlook nothing. If you mess up...well, you might just become Reficul's newest resident.

I won't tell you who told me the ritual for locating the town, but I *will* tell you the ritual itself.

First, a couple preliminaries.

Make sure you have a car in decent working order. And make sure that car has a full tank of gas. If your car runs out of gas or picks an inopportune time to break down, odds are you're going to find yourself in a pretty deep heap of trouble.

Next, make sure you have a good old-fashioned analog watch, preferrably one manufactured prior to 1976. Don't bother with a digital watch or your smartphone to check the time; modern devices don't work in the town of Reficul. Believe me when I tell you that you *need* a watch. It's *absolutely critical* that you monitor the time while exploring Reficul. You're going to want to check your watch regularly and frequently. I'll explain why later on.

Also, and this one is optional, a good blindfold would be a good item to bring along.

Okay, so you've got your car and vintage analog watch? Good, we can commence with the ritual itself.

On the night of the new moon of any month, start driving south on I-476 just outside of Scranton. Reficul lies -- or did -- somewhere in between Scranton and Allentown, seventy-six miles south. You're going to want to start your journey no sooner than 7 P.M. and no later than 9 P.M. Be sure to keep a close eye on your odometer. Drive south for exactly -- and I do stress *exactly* \-- thirty miles. Nothing eventful or out of the ordinary will happen during the first leg of your trip. When you've driven exactly thirty miles you're going to want to find an exit you can use to turn around, get back on the interstate, and drive back the way you came. When you've travelled exactly *another* thirty miles, turn *back* around and head south again. Then repeat the process (and be sure to keep an eye on your fuel gauge;  if you start getting low, look for an exit with a gas station where you can refuel, then resume your journey.) You might have to do this two or three times before you see the sign coming up on your right.

The sign reading: REFICUL EXIT, 2 MILES.

The exit sign that *hadn't been there* the first two or three times you drove along that stretch.

Drive another two miles and sure enough, you'll see the exit approaching with a sign reading REFICUL.

Take the exit and you'll find yourself on a two-lane highway with open country on either side of you. Drive slowly for the next couple miles. The only thing you will see will be the road in front of you, unwinding gradually in your headlights. There will be no sign of anything else on either side of you; not a tree, a building, or any living creature. Just your car and the road ahead in the middle of a vast, desolate and eerie darkness. A darkness that might strike you as being unnatural and frightening in its density and lack of feature. As of you were driving between two immensely high, endless walls of solid blackness. 

If you have your radio on, at some point it should stop working. Just fall abruptly dead without warning. No white noise, no sound of  signal interference, just dead silence. 

Then, ahead of you, you should spot something in the distance. 

A small cluster of buildings. 

You've done it. You've found the town.

Drive until you reach those buildings. 

Then stop abruptly. Turn off your engine. And make sure your windows are all rolled up and your doors all locked. 

Listen carefully and follow my instructions precisely. This is the most dangerous part. If you value not just your life but also your immortal soul, *do. Not. Screw. This. Up.* 

Close your eyes and just sit there. If you brought along that blindfold I suggested, now's the time to put it on. 

What do you do now? Now you just sit there. And wait. 

Do not get out of your car. No matter what happens or what you hear, *do not, for any reason get out of your car.*

And for the love of God, *do not open yours eyes.* 

You're going to be sitting there for a while, so try to get comfortable. If you find yourself suddenly needing to go to the bathroom...well, I guess an empty bottle or jar might be a smart bring-along to add to your list.

But I repeat, do not get out of your car!

At some point -- I can't tell you exactly when -- you're going to start hearing sounds. Faint and hardly audible at first; the sort of sounds you might assume at first to be in your imagination.

But they'll get gradually louder, and closer. 

Then you're going to start hearing the voices. 

Perfectly normal-sounding human voices that sound like they're speaking to you from right outside your car.

You might hear someone -- or something -- tug at your door handle, trying to open your car door. Do not panic, no matter how scared you become. When they realize your car is locked, they'll give up and won't attempt to force themselves in. 

But the voices will continue. 

At first you might only hear one or two, speaking to you from right outside the driver's window. But they'll increase in number until it sounds like a crowd of people are surrounding your car. You might hear fingers tapping on your glass, trying to get your attention. Pay them no mind.

At first the voices will sound calm and perfectly reasonable. They will address you by name and talk as if they know you personally. They might even sound familiar. You might even swear they sound exactly like people you know. Friends and loved ones. 

Do not listen to them. Do not believe what they tell you. And most of all, do not open your eyes and look at them. Just sit there as calmly as you can and ignore them. Don't acknowledge them; pretend you can't even hear them. 

The voices will try to get you to unlock your car and come out. They will cajole you, coax you with a false sense of trust and safety. They will manipulate you; attempt to trick you. They will tease and tempt you. 

Eventually, when they realize that's not working, they will become hostile and try to intimidate you with insults and threats and profanity. Do not be alarmed; they cannot harm you as long as you stay in your car. The only way they can hurt you is if you go out to them. 

Then the voices will become desperate. They will beg and plead and speak frantically, imploring you to unlock your car, as if they are in immediate danger and require your help.

Ignore them, ignore them, ignore them.

Just sit there and wait. And keep your eyes tightly closed. You *do not* want to look at them. You will not like what you see. Don't even crack open an eye just to glance at your watch; just wait them out. It will seem like an eternity, but suck it up.

(What are *they*, you ask me? I couldn't tell you, because I didn't look. Neither did the old man who explained the ritual to me. His friend, who accompanied him, *did* look however...and that's why he didn't make the return journey with the old man.)

Hours will pass. The voices will not cease. They will clammer endlessly, trying to gain your attention. 

Then, at some point, you will notice the voices are beginning to fade. Slowly growing fainter. Until they diminish totally into silence. 

Just to play it safe, keep your eyes closed until you begin to sense the darkness transitioning to brightness. 

Daylight. Dawn has finally arrived and the night has ended. 

You made it. Good for you.

Okay, it's safe to open your eyes. You can exit your car now and begin to explore the town. But stay alert, and be careful. You're not out of the woods yet. 

Far from it.
