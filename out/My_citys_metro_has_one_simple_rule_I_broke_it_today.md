I raced down the creaky escalator, past the cheesy advertisements which looked as if they haven’t been replaced anytime in the last decade. It was still a while before I would reach the platform, and I was already hearing the shriek-like symphony of the brakes as the soviet-era train made its way into the empty station, lit only by a few flickering yellow lights. Panicked, I glanced at my watch, causing me to stumble over my feet and hit my head on the rubber handrail running alongside me.

I woke up in pitch darkness. Feeling around my pants, I uncovered many cuts and bruises, but most importantly, my phone. As I tapped the screen with my disfigured fingers, it lit up, blinding me with light. Seconds later, as I read the time and my memories came rushing back, I was blinded by something much worse; fear. 

0:58 AM. 

“No. - No, no, no! It can’t be!” - I tried to scream, but only a raspy whisper came out. I quickly understood that this was for my own good, though, as I realised that this wasn’t simply a bad dream; it was reality.

I sat in silence for what felt like hours. I never thought that this moment would come. I always told myself that I wouldn’t risk it, that I would be careful. Yet here I was; fallen victim to my own impatience; and soon, I reckon, the victim of something worse than death.

Hey, I just thought of something. If you find this, and you’re not from around here, I reckon you wouldn’t know what the hell I am talking about. I’ll explain, but every tap of the screen is painful, so I will try to be quick.

I was young when the rumours started, and yeah, that’s just what they were to me back then: rumours. Every city has their own, unique set of creepy legends that terrify school children and keep teenagers in check. Don’t get me wrong, most of the rumours here in xxxxxxxx are just that. Unfortunately though, and I hate to be cliche, but this one, well; this one was just different, and not in a good way. 

Listen, I’m not sure I have much more time before those things find me. It’s already 2:00 AM, and the noises are getting closer. Any attempts to move result in a sharp pain in my back, causing me to stumble and crash back to the ground. I fear that crawling will have me falling down into one of the tracks, meaning they’ll get to me even quicker. Even if I wanted use my phone’s flashlight, I want to conserve as much of the 12% of remaining battery as I can, and I don’t reckon what I would see would be pretty anyway.

I can see them. Their eyes, at least. The faint glows of red remind me of my car’s cigar lighter. Fuck, I should have taken my car today. I can see them watching. Dozens, if not hundreds in each tunnel. I don’t have much time left. If you find this, please, just please, remember -

don’t stay in the metro after midnight.
