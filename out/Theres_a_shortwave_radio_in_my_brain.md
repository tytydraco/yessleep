There’s a shortwave radio in my brain. 

I didn’t put it there. But I know it's there– it has to be. I feel it, always.

Burning, twisting, functional metal lodged amongst bleeding, fleshy neurons.

It does things. 

Tells me what to do. 

Odd hums, beeps, and frequencies bounce in my skull constantly.

It thinks it can control me, but it can’t. It sends electrical signals down its spindling wires into my occipital lobe; begging, pleading for me to accept its distortions. 

But I won’t. I refuse. It can’t propagandize me. 

The main unit– behind my right eye. 

I can feel it every time I move it or blink. The weight of the box slows the fluid movements of my eye. That harsh, brutish device violates me. It tries to show me things that aren’t real. Before my very eyes. Distorting the light that bounces into my retinas. 

I can’t explain how they installed it. 

All that I know for sure is that they entered through my forehead. And they did a damn good job covering up their work. But I see through it. They left one mistake. There’s one tiny scar visible on my right eyebrow, where no hair grows. Hard to believe they really forgot something so obvious. They think I’m a fool.

It happened some months ago– the scraping was the first thing I noticed. 

A sharp, pinpoint dragging of the edge of some cool, metal container against the inside of my eye. I can practically hear the noise still, the harsh invader carving miniscule trenches along the surface of the red, veiny back of my eyeball. Like nails on a chalkboard.

The second thing I noticed was the taste. Coppery, bloody, coming from the back of my throat. I think they left wires there, too. Snaking past my uvula and into the rest of my body through soft, fleshy channels.

After that, it all started to flood my mind. The foreign thoughts. The strange figures in my peripheral vision. They tried– are still, trying now– to make me scared of myself. Of the world.

But I won’t accept it. I won’t cower to those that want to track me, stalk me, fool me into submission. I’ll do something.

A man had been visiting my house periodically over the past month or so. A man who thought he could just invite himself in, talk to me as if he owned me. Tried to give me things. I think he installed the radio.

But I saw through it. He's with them. I wouldn’t allow him to further insert their cold, dead, electronic fingers deeper into my soul. 

My radio warned me. A hot flash emanated across my head, from back to front, ending at my forehead, producing a slick sweat. I wiped it with my shirt sleeve and knew that he was on his way. He’d be here any minute.

A knock at the door. 

An alarm bell telling me to run. 

He was here. I could feel the radio frequencies pulsing from his body– and it told me something was different. He wasn’t here to fool me again. He was here to kill me. Cast me aside. I, the lab rat, was done being played with.

I wouldn’t let him touch me. Not this time. Not with his hands. Not with his thoughts. 

I hid right around the corner from the front door in a hallway perpendicular to the entrance. I peeked my head around the wall just enough to give me a good view. Just enough to know for sure what’s hunting me.

A few more knocks left unanswered must have compelled him to do something else. I watched as the shadowy figure, obscured by the frosted glass of the door, faded from view as he walked away.

But his frequencies didn’t go away. Instead, they seemed to have shifted, coming from the side of the house first, then coming from the backyard.

I rushed to the backdoor, located in my kitchen, and watched the window from behind the counter. The man appeared, clear as day, within my view. He was dressed in all black clothing, touting tactical gear like riot police. His face was obscured by a tight black mask with only holes for his eyes, dark and angry.

A concealed, black-gloved hand reached for the doorknob and twisted. The door creaked open as it granted him permission to invade my home.

Just as a heavy, black military boot caked in mud crossed the threshold into my kitchen, I sprinted from my hiding spot behind the counter into the adjoining hallway and up the stairs in a mad dash.

“Hey!”

The man shouted into the home, his voice only answered by the dissipating pattering of my bare feet on hardwood.

Past my office, past the laundry room, straight into my bedroom I ran. He won’t find me. I’ll make sure of it. I shut the door as carefully and silently as possible, and I locked myself in the bathroom.

I approached the mirror.

My hands were shaking. Sweat formed beads on my forehead that sparkled in the light. My right eye was twitching. I tried to blink rapidly to stop the movement, but it wouldn’t close.

It wasn’t obeying me anymore.

I reached up, and with trembling fingers, forced my right eye shut. As soon as my hand let go, the aperture immediately flipped open again.

The entire surface of the eye was inky black, reflecting the light above the mirror, making it seem shiny in appearance.

A camera lens.

That’s it. He knows where I am. He can see through my own vision. My body betrays me. It’s only a matter of time before he walks right into my bedroom and busts down the bathroom door.

“Where are you? I just want to talk!”

I could hear shouting coming from the man down the hallway; robotic, forceful, and it was near. He thought he could coax me from safety.

The sudden wave of terror instilled a newfound initiative in me. I won’t let him see through me. I grabbed gauze tape from the cabinet under the sink and applied enough to force my eyelid shut. 

If he was going to hunt me, I knew it was only a matter of time before he caught me. I couldn’t just hide. I needed to act.

I scanned the room with my remaining sight searching for a means to defend myself. There was nothing obvious that stood out. I looked back up at myself in the mirror and realized. I slammed my fist into the mirror, shattering it into large shards that crashed down over the counter and onto the floor.

The jagged edges cut up my knuckles and forearm, leaving a small dripping faucet of blood behind. I picked up the largest shard, about the size of a kitchen knife. 

I crept out of the bathroom back into the bedroom, barefoot upon the carpet. I just had enough time to glance at the bedroom door to realize the knob was turning.

I lunged to the ground, crawling under the bed, the blood from my arm soaking into the carpet.

The knob shook several times, each more insistent than the last. A final attempt was followed by a few seconds of silence. All I could hear was my heartbeat and the electric buzz ringing in my ears.

Thud. 

Thud. 

Crack. 

The door began shaking violently with barely constrained force.

I gripped the reflective shard tight– cutting the palm of my hand in a pact of blood. I watched the door from my concealed position, sweat dripping from my brow to the floor.

The door gave way with a deafening slam, splintering wood flying from the handle. It swung into the wall with enough force to crack the drywall. 

Before it stood him– the tall, wide, black form of an invader, no, a trained killer. Velcro straps and square plates and reflective padding and dark fabric and tightened boots. I couldn’t see above the chest. The skin exposed between his gloves and sleeve displayed a sickly pale tinge of blue, that of a corpse. 

He, no, it– stomped into the room, one boot barreling after another, the steel toes trampling the soft carpet below. It slowed, and I could feel it’s cold, violating sight scanning across my bed, floor, the closet, and any other personal affect I kept hidden away in my most private space. 

The feet trudged away toward the bathroom. Crunching of shards breaking under the pressure of black boots told me the terrifying truth. It knew my plan. It saw the mirror. All I could hope was that it couldn't feel the waves my radio was transmitting in all directions. Telling it my exact location.

It walked back out into the bedroom, stepping towards the end of the bed, right where my head was. It’s feet paused right beside a small, smeared blood stain that led straight to me.

A pool of sweat and blood had formed beneath me, my weaponized hand resting just in front of it. Now was the time. I had to strike. 

I swung my arm out and the shard plunged into it’s right ankle. Just as the leg jerked backwards involuntarily, I could make out the reflection of it’s face looking down through the jagged device.

It’s, no, his– eyes were terrified. He was shocked by the attack, completely unprepared. As he reeled back, my grip remained firm and the shard exited his flesh just as suddenly as it had entered.

He shouted in pain. I scrambled out from the right side of the bed and stood before him. 

“I know what you want! Take it!”

I shouted with desperation, turning the makeshift knife upon myself. He backed away slightly and raised his thick arms, palms out, as if to reject me. 

Electrons and waves of static blared through my skull as I began to hack away at the camera. Blood poured from the socket and he looked at me with bewilderment.

Just as the camera was beginning to sag and hang from my head, he grabbed my hand with an iron grip, pulling the shard and tossing it to the corner of the room. He reached into one of his many velcro compartments on his vest and pulled out some sort of radio transmitter.

I screamed, blood dripping into my mouth, lunging at him as he tried to put the transmitter to his ear, contacting someone. More of them. 

I knocked the device from his grip before he shoved me to the ground. 

He looked down at me, and I saw the robotic facade fade into that of a confused, scared man. He backed off slowly, then ran out of the room and down the hall.

I pulled myself up the side of the bed and walked to the shard. I picked it up and gazed into it.

What used to be my right eye was hanging to the black socket by tangled, multi-colored, frayed and sparking wires. 

The man left my house that day and he hasn’t come back.

The frequencies I intercept have only worsened since. They want me to do horrible things. I won’t listen. 

I have since fully removed the camera. What lies deeper within will be harder to extract. I don’t know if I have the knowledge or willpower.

Yet.
