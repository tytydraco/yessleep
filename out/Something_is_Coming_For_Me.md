So, hello. I'm writing this in probably my last few moments alive. I'm afraid. I have boarded up my windows and doors but I dont think that's enough to hold it off for long. I guess I should start at the beginning.

Knowing how clumsy I am, this story shouldn't be as odd as it is. One night, I was scrolling on reddit as I do most nights. My bed is directly next to a window but there's not much activity since I live in a generally remote area. But that night, I heard a baby crying. It sounded like it was coming from behind shed about 50 feet away from my window. There's no baby in my house or at my neighbors house so I was confused.

I brushed it off as me mishearing an animal call because it went away. But about 20 minutes later I heard something else. This time it was a baby laughing. This kept happening every 20 minutes and every time it was something different. The last time was right before I fell asleep and it sounded like a woman singing for 5 minutes then there was a blood curdling scream and then deafening silence.

Next time this happened, I heard meowing and assumed it was some stray that had wandered into my yard since it's happened before. I looked out my window and saw something looking back at me. It looked like a dog but it was still meowing at me. Then it suddenly stood on its hind legs and sprinted back to what I assumed was its nest.

When it did that, I slammed close the shutters and locked my door. I was too scared to sleep and even more scared to stay awake. To see it again. That was about a month ago, but something happened again tonight. I heard that same woman scream but this time more muffled and I made out a word.

After the screaming, I heard her voice yelling "HELP! HELP!" Then I heard my name. It's almost like she knew me and needed me specifically. I was about to open my bedroom door when something within told me to stop. I looked up what I was experiencing and found other people in rural areas with similar stories, though most ended with the person leaving to investigate the noise. I don't want to say what it is in case I accidentally summon more. If you still don't know, I will leave a clue for you.

Leaning against my wall were inch thick wooden boards because my dad was doing construction. I covered my door and window with them but the banging and pleading just wont stop. I don't know what to do because I know she's actually just it trying to get in.

Kinda wish I grabbed food before I shut myself in but chocolate from Christmas should keep me alive long enough. I know I will die anyways but I want to prolong that as much as I can.

Even now, the banging wont stop and I think I hear more banging and hooves running through the woods. I hope this reaches the correct people before they get to me.

Reach out to me if you have any method of keeping them off. I hope you understand the message hidden. If not, remember what comes before second. I'm sorry I can't tell you more.
