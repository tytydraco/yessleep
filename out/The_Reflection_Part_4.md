I don’t believe in ghosts. Or demons. Or whatever the hell is living in my mirror.

I tell myself this every morning. Every night. Every time I catch my reflection moving just a little too fast, a little too eager.

I don’t *want* to believe it.

But I can’t deny it’s been helpful.

The day after my reflection smiled at me, I braced for things to get worse. I expected more messages, more obvious horror movie bullshit. Instead, my life got… easier.

Little things at first. The coffee machine never runs out of filters. My bank account stays just above zero, even though I swear I was drowning in overdraft fees last week. My boss, who normally looks for any excuse to chew me out, suddenly can’t find a reason to reprimand me.

It’s like the universe flipped a switch in my favor. And if I hadn’t seen my own reflection lag behind me, hadn’t wiped please off my mirror, I’d call it good luck.

But I did see. And I did wipe it away. And now I can’t pretend this isn’t happening.

So I do the next best thing—I stop looking in mirrors.

I avoid them like a superstition, like walking under ladders or breaking glass. I shave without a reflection. I use my phone screen at an angle. I even keep the bathroom light off when I brush my teeth, just to be safe.

But then, the world starts slipping.

It’s subtle at first. A coworker calling me by a nickname I’ve never had. My apartment door being unlocked when I come home. Strangers looking at me like they almost recognize me.

And then, one night, I dream.

I’m standing in my bathroom, staring at the mirror, but my reflection isn’t me. It’s someone wearing my face, but their eyes are just a little too bright. Their posture, a little too relaxed.

They don’t mimic me. They don’t need to.

“*You look tired,*” they say. Their voice is my voice, but it doesn’t belong to me.

I don’t answer.

They tilt their head. “*I can make it easier. You know that, right?*”

I shake my head. “I don’t want your help.”

They smile. “*You already have it.*”

I wake up in a cold sweat, heart hammering. But the worst part isn’t the dream—it’s the fact that when I stumble into the bathroom, turn on the light, and finally let myself look in the mirror again…

I look good.

Not just good. Rested. Healthy. Like I haven’t been slowly unraveling for weeks.

And when I blink, for just a fraction of a second—

My reflection doesn’t blink with me.

“*Just let me help.*”

The voice isn’t in my head this time. It’s real. Close.

I don’t remember running out of the bathroom, but I do remember slamming the door shut behind me, my breath coming fast and ragged.

Because I know, deep down, I can’t ignore this anymore.

And worse?

I don’t know if I want to.
