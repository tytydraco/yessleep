I was going to die, but Lilith wasn’t going to be the end of my family.   
I had screamed and pleaded and begged, but she wasn’t going to leave us alone.  
I was so fucking done with it.  
I was so fucking done with her.  
\-  
My left sleeve was damp.  
I could have got up and grabbed some napkins from the bar, but every time I got up, I came back to my table with another drink and somehow forgot the napkins. I moved on and started wiping my nose on my right sleeve instead.   
That was my problem. I always missed the little things. If I didn’t, my patient would still be alive.   
He was only thirteen.  
He had been getting a little worse every session. He seemed more and more frustrated, but he didn’t give me any signs that he would take his own life.  
But he did.  
All those little comments that I glossed over for six months were little bricks that he was using to build a prison around himself. One that he felt he had only one way out of.  
Everyone I talked to said the same thing.   
It happens.   
You need to dust yourself off and keep going.   
Some people are going to do it no matter what.   
Do better next time.  
Move on.  
Onto the next sleeve.  
I was muttering to myself between every drag. The ashtray was two butts shy of a spent pack when she walked over.  
“Hi.”  
The gorgeous bimbo who was making her rounds finally found her way to my table. She had a small handful of napkins.  
“Hi.”  
“You seem like you could really use someone to talk to. Can I sit down?”   
The first awkward pause.  
“Sure.”  
Everything about her looked calculated. The dress, the voice, the hair. All of it made her look like the perfect maneater on the prowl, but her eyes were different. Genuine is the only word that even comes close, but they were even more than that.  
All the little bricks I was building around myself were taken down by her eyes. I was lost in them before she even sat down.  
“I’m Lilith.”  
“Amy.”   
“Nice to meet you.”  
“I’m normally a little more put together than this.” That was an understatement. Underneath my sweatshirt were breasts that hadn’t felt a bra or a shower in two days. I had put some deodorant underneath them before I left my apartment because the smell of boob sweat followed me like a cloud.  
“I’m sure.” She handed me the napkins and smiled. I wiped my nose and lit another cigarette off of the one I had just finished. I started coughing and grabbed a napkin just in time to catch a nasty bit of something clear and sticky. “My God. You’re really going for it, aren’t you?”  
“I’ve had a really bad couple of days.”  
“Well, why don’t you tell me about it.” She was earnest, but the question made me laugh. “What’s so funny?”  
“It’s… I’m a therapist. I’m usually the one who asks that question. I always ask that one, but I guess I miss the important ones. Fuck! I’m sorry. I’m terrible company right now. I’m so sorry.”  
She reached across the table and held my free hand. Her hand was so warm. She studied my face, while I studied hers.  
Her brow furrowed and she took a sharp breath. She looked like she understood everything about me, like she could feel everything I was going through.  
“You lost someone, didn’t you?”   
My lips were quivering.  
Her eyes started to tear up.  
“Tell me all about it. Everything. I’ll just listen.” She just held my hand while I spilled my guts as much as I could without violating confidentiality. Outside of the birth of my daughter, I had never felt connected to someone like that. Two spirits coming together with nothing in between them.  
But there was something between us. A small omission on her part. A part of her that I was never supposed to see.  
There was a little thing.  
\-  
It’s a strange bit of wonderful knowing that you’re going to die. I’ve heard it from terminal cancer patients. You can breathe a little easier, sleep a little better, because you know how the story is going to end. The only anxiety you have comes from figuring out the tiny details of how you’re going to get there.  
I was going to die, but Lilith was coming with me.  
I just had to work out the details.  
\-   
I had taped black garbage bags over every vent. If Lilith went back into the attic, the plastic wasn’t going to stop her from getting in, but I wanted to make sure she couldn’t see anything. I had tacked up sheets and blankets over every window. It was her turn to wonder exactly what was going to happen next.  
I figured Charlie would wake me if Lilith was close, so I was finally able to get a few hours of sleep.  
Charlie and I were sitting on the couch plowing through a bag of Funyuns and staring at my dad’s metal thermos.   
It was sitting on the bar in the kitchen; a problem waiting for me to solve.  
Maybe she had always wanted a piece of her next to me. I wasn’t sure. I just knew it was something I could use.  
“How am I going to do this, Charlie?”  
He grumbled a reply and a bit of Funyun fell out of his mouth and onto the couch.  
“Well, if you come up with anything, don’t hold back. Just blurt it out. I don’t want to ruin the moment, but we don’t have a lot of time.”  
He buried his face in the bag and when he got out of the way, I reached in and grabbed another handful.  
It was the first food I hadn’t had to force myself to eat in days. It was delicious. I had made some pasta salad and a tri-tip was marinating in the fridge. I polished off a two liter bottle of Coke, and I was working on my second. I was going to live it up.  
“Luring her here should be easy, but how do we get rid of her?”   
We finished the bag, but our stomach’s were still growling. I got up and Charlie voiced his concern.  
“Settle down. I’m going to make dinner in a minute, but there’s a tube of Cheez Balls in the pantry. I’ll be right back.”  
I eyed the thermos as I walked by; the mess I had made of my mom’s kitchen counter was in the background. So much clutter. I grabbed the tube of goodies and then I froze. There was something on the counter.  
I walked back into the kitchen and stared at my mess. Charlie spoke up from the couch and I threw him a Cheez Ball over the bar.   
“I think I found a piece of the puzzle, Charlie.”  
The marinade injector I had used on the meat was sitting in a puddle of red wine and worcestershire.  
A stainless steel lifesaver. A giant needle that could hold two ounces of liquid.  
God bless my father and his obsession with grilled meat.  
\-  
Charlie had his paws up on my dad’s workbench while he watched me open the thermos and shake the small gob of Lilith out into an empty coffee can.  
The thing was very much alive as it crawled around the bottom. It was trying to climb up the sides, but I kept shaking the can to halt its progress.  
The marinade injector was full of some lacquer thinner I had found in the garage, and I lowered the needle into the can. I poked the little blob and it attached itself to the end of the needle. I pushed the plunger down and the reaction was immediate. The thing began to writhe and spasm.  
I smiled at its pain.  
Charlie growled.  
I watched the clock on the wall. A young Troy Aikman was holding a football and staring back at me through the hands of the clock.  
The reaction only lasted for about five seconds, and then the little thing began moving around as it had done before. I injected it again, but this time, there was no reaction. It shed the lacquer thinner immediately. Almost like it spit it out.  
“It adapted. I’ll only have one shot. Five seconds. Not a lot of time.”  
Charlie agreed with me.  
I pushed the remaining liquid out of the syringe and filled it from a gas can next to the lawn mower. I dribbled it over the thing and then I dropped a match.  
Little Lilith raced and jumped around the bottom of the can. A flaming tiny dancer. It finally came to a halt and I watched the fire consume all of it.  
\-  
“PETE!” I slapped my hands on his window. He screamed as he came out of a dead sleep.   
“HOLY SHIT!”  
“Pete! I need to talk to you!”  
He slowly climbed out of his car. He shivered at the cold.  
“I’m really sorry to wake you, but I need your help.”  
“Is everything ok?”  
“I need you to do me a favor.”  
“What?”  
“I need you to take Charlie. I need you to take him and I need you to stay away from my house for a few days.”  
“What? Why?”  
“He barks whenever she’s around, and I need her to come here.”  
“What?”  
“Just, please. Take a few days off. Take Charlie. Please. You’re a really good kid, and I don’t want to see you get hurt. Keep my dog safe.”  
“I’m supposed to work in two hours. They’re going to want me to come right back here.”  
“Cough on the phone. Throw up on a video call. Break a fucking leg. I don’t care. Just stay away.”  
“For how long?”  
“You’ll know when.”  
“Mam, I can’t do that. What about you?”  
God, the kid was so nice. Reason wasn’t going to work. I had to hit low, or he’d never leave.  
“Pete. I’m not your mother and nothing you do is ever going to bring her back. Understand me? Now take my Dog and go.”  
His face dropped. I really hurt him.  
\-  
It killed me watching him drive away with Charlie. I wasn’t ever going to see him again, and that was the last impression of me he would ever have. Another scar left because of Lilith. I hoped that was the last one.  
\-  
After the sun came up, I ran outside with a couple of cans of spray paint. Normal people were already out mowing their lawns while the crazy daughter of the Dobkins’ was running around writing things on the beautiful white home in red and neon green spray paint.  
I wrote things for Lilith on all four sides of the house. I hoped she was watching.  
“You’ll Have to Come Inside.”  
“I’m Waiting.”  
“You Can’t See Me.”  
“I’m never coming out, so what are you Waiting For?”  
I stood in the middle of the front lawn and decided that I should put one more on the garage door.  
“Jim Was My Soulmate.”  
It wasn’t true, I just knew it would piss her off. I hated Jim because he was a lie, just like her.  
I hated her for many things. Defacing my parent’s house was now the latest. The cop in the cruiser across the street was speaking into his radio while he kept an eye on me. I heard a familiar voice coming from my left.  
“Amy? What are you doing to your mother’s house?” Homer was standing at the edge of his lawn.   
No coffee cup.   
No Joe.   
I had never seen Homer without Joe. Ever.  
“Morning, Homer.”  
“Honey, you really shouldn’t do that to your mom’s house?”  
“Where’s Joe?”  
“Oh, she’s inside. Why don’t you come over and have some coffee with us. You look like you need some company.” He smiled.  
“I can’t. I’m waiting on someone.”  
“Obviously.” The space between us seemed to narrow. I didn’t like his smile. He was closer to my front door than I was. I left the syringe inside, and I had nothing to defend myself with. I was being too arrogant.  
“When do you expect your friend to show up?”  
“They should be along soon.”  
“I see. Well, I hope you have a good time. Just come on over if you want some company.”   
He didn’t move. I was trying to keep my breathing steady while I walked past him. He kept smiling.  
I locked the door and ran for the syringe and put it in the front pocket of my sweatshirt.  
\-  
Later that night, I had a cigarette on the porch. Homer and Joe never came out with their decaf. I thought about telling the cop across the street, but if it was Lilith, there was no point. They were already gone.   
\-  
The smell of the paint thinner, detergent, and gasoline was growing stronger as time went on. I needed to hide the smell.  
I started smoking inside the house and burning every one of my mothers candles. I emptied every bottle of perfume she had on the furniture and I was constantly spritzing my sweatshirt pocket with Febreze. It was almost impossible to breathe in the house.  
I waited inside. No more going outside.   
I got rid of every clock and threw them in the garage. I made sure no light was coming through the windows. Time didn’t mean anything. There was only this house. There was only the waiting. I thought of Kurt Vonnegut.  
*“Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time.”*  
\-  
The only gauge of time I had was the way I smelled. From my pits, I figured it was at least three days. I hoped she was going just as crazy as I was. I didn’t know what was going on out there, and she had no idea what was going on inside, but I had to be realistic. I was going to fall asleep, and I knew that when she finally came in this time, it was going to be for keeps.  
A stalker’s game only lasts so long before they decide to end it.  
I stayed next to the kitchen. Next to my trap.  
I had to stay awake.  
Had to stay awake.  
Stay awake.  
Awake…  
\-  
Someone was shaking me. She was inside. I had fallen asleep while I was standing next to the bar.  
I felt the steel in my front pocket.  
“Mam? Mam?”  
My eyes shot open. Pete was in his uniform and he was shaking me. His hands were on me. His face was next to mine. He was smiling.  
I pulled the injector out of my pocket and drove it into his forearm, but he threw me against the bar before I could push the plunger.  
“DADGUMMIT! What the hell are you…”  
I had my back to the bar while I slid around it. I was still trying to get my eyes to focus. I was trying to think. I had to get to the oven. He plucked the injector out of his arm. “You thought… oh my Lord, you were gonna…”   
He started walking towards me.  
“Ok, now wait a minute. It’s really me. I know what you told me, but I just couldn’t leave you here alone. I hadn’t seen you for a few days and I just wanted to check on you.”   
I made it around the bar and backed up to the counter, but he was still walking towards me. I felt for the liter bottle behind me on the counter, and when I found it, I unscrewed the cap with one hand. My head was pounding. I could smell the gas and soap. I felt like I was in a dream.  
“Charlie’s fine. I got him with my girlfriend’s parents. Really good people. They’re regulars over at the First Baptist on Gettysburg.”  
“How did you get in, Pete?” I was shaking. This was it.  
“Your dad gave me a key.”  
“He would never do that.”  
“He trusted me. I can prove it to you. The key’s still in the deadbolt if you wanna come take a look. Come here.”  
The oven was right behind me, and I was trying to figure out how to get him closer.   
It was Lilith. It had to be.  
“Mam. I’m not going to hurt you.” He stood still and held out the injector. I looked him over for any little thing I might have missed. I wasn’t going to take it from his hand.  
He put it on the counter and slid it next to me. He backed away into the family room.  
“I just wanted to check on you is all. I swear, I’m Pete. I’m not gonna hurt you. I’ll just stand right here.”  
I grabbed the injector and started to cry.  
“I can’t do this anymore… I’m losing my mind. Why don’t you just kill me and get it over with?”  
“Mam, you got to believe me.”  
I heard another voice. A shout. Pete’s head moved to the front door.  
“What are you doing in here?!” Detective Hopkins walked in and stood in front of Pete, looking him up and down. I put the injector back into the pocket of my sweatshirt.  
“Officer Avery! You are not supposed to leave your post!”  
“Yes sir. I’m sorry sir, I just…”  
“Now, Avery! Out!”  
Pete ran out of the house and the detective turned his attention to me. I was shaking. Wiping my eyes.  
He was walking towards me.  
“My God, it smells in here. I was going to ask how you were, but I think I know the answer.”  
If that really was Pete, I was ready to kill him. If it really was the detective, how was I supposed to know? I was suddenly terrified that I was accidentally going to kill an innocent person. I was breaking down. I was finally at the end of my rope.  
Lilith had won.  
I was laughing and crying. My hand gripped the injector and I thought about using it on myself just to end everything.  
  
Hopkins was trying to calm me down. He was getting closer. All I could do was cry. He was there to take me to the station for more questioning. He threatened to arrest me if I didn’t come willingly.   
He stopped just short of me being able to stick him, but at that point, I wasn’t going to. I didn’t want to hurt anybody.  
I was done.  
“I’m so tired, Detective.”  
“Well, come with me, and we’ll see if you feel a little safer.”  
“Ok.”  
Through the tears, I saw the little thing. The one thing that helped me pull it back together.  
There was no coffee stain on his shirt.  
It was something. I could have been wrong, but it helped me get control of myself.   
I had to think of something else, and it wasn’t hard.   
If it was Lilith, I knew what would get her to show her true colors.  
If she did show her true colors, I knew how I was going to show her mine.  
“I never should have left her.”  
“Excuse me?”  
“I’d give anything to go back to the night we met. I’ve ruined everything. I could have had a life with her.”  
I saw another little thing, but I was looking for it. An almost imperceptible twitch.   
A suppressed smile.  
It was Lilith.  
“She’s always been my everything. I never wanted any of this to happen. I’m so stupid.” I sobbed and Hopkins moved toward me. I put out my right hand towards him like I wanted him to hold me, while my left was stuffed in my pocket. Hopkins hesitated for only a moment. I figured that Lilith would want to feel my pain.   
I figured correctly.  
“Mrs. Taylor, it’s going to be alright.” Hopkins grabbed my hand. He studied my face, while I studied his.  
I saw the look of realization.   
Lilith realized that she had been played. His face turned to a scowl and I pulled my hand away before I could be injected with anything.  
“Amy, you bitch!” Lilith’s voice.  
“MAM?! MAM?!”   
Both of us looked towards the door. Pete had run back in, screaming for me. Hopkins turned back to me as I stabbed the injector into his neck and pushed the plunger down.  
Five seconds.  
Pete was yelling at me to step back. Detective Hopkin’s face was spasming into a display of pain. I turned my back.  
Four seconds.  
I turned the knobs on all the burners. Lilith was screaming and flailing.   
Three seconds.  
It was half Hopkins and half Lilith. I grabbed the two liter bottle full of food coloring, gas, and detergent and shook it.  
Two seconds.  
I squeezed the bottle, and all the nasty goop inside covered the suit that Lilith was wearing. It doused her face. I grabbed her by the suit. My hands were wet.  
One second.  
“Soulmates my ass.” I spit in Lilith’s face. I used every bit of strength I had and spun her around me and into the stove. The side of her face crashed down on it from the momentum.  
Lilith erupted in flames, and so did my hands while I held onto the suit jacket.  
For just one moment, I could see her eyes before her face was gone. She was afraid.  
I felt the sensation of floating backwards, away from Lilith. Pete had pulled me away and ripped the blanket from the sliding glass window. The family room was filled with sunlight. Pete was patting me down. Lilith was screaming.  
I only got glimpses through the blanket. Lilith ran through the family room. Pete was praying to Jesus that he could put me out. I was laughing.  
\-  
When Pete was convinced I was out and the house wasn’t on fire, he helped me to my feet. I could smell my own burned flesh and the smell of whatever the hell Lilith was.  
We walked to the front porch. Lilith was lying still on the lawn. I lit a cigarette and offered one to Pete. We both sat on the steps while we watched Lilith burn down to nothing. Sirens were somewhere close.  
“How did you know?”  
“What do you mean Mam?”  
“How did you know it was her?”  
“It hit me just when I was about to sit in the cruiser. Nobody calls me Avery. That’s my Dad’s name.”  
I kissed him on his forehead.  
“You did good, Pete.”  
We couldn’t stop laughing as the firetruck pulled up.  
It was over.  
\-  
I was sitting in the hometown dive bar and Charlie was on the seat across from me. I saw a lot of people I remembered from highschool. They were avoiding me. The crazy bitch that killed someone and almost burnt down her parents house.  
That was fine. I just wanted to blend into the background. I had sat down in the darkest booth I could find. The bright white bandages on my hands and over my left eye stood out in the shadows. They were the last burns I would ever have to deal with.  
I was doing my best to clear their shelf of bourbon. I was in sweatpants, no bra, and the ratty sweatshirt I had killed Lilith in. I had to wash it twice to get rid of the smell of gas and burnt Lilith.  
My parents were at the hotel with Jessica while their kitchen and carpet were being replaced. They were safe and Charlie and I were celebrating.  
“Where do we go from here, Charlie?”  
He cocked his head and grumbled.  
“I don’t know either.”  
I lit a cigarette and a song came on the jukebox. It was my favorite band, singing Lilith’s favorite song.   
  
*“All messed up with nowhere to go,*  
 *I stare at myself in the mirror alone.*  
*It’s hard to make friends when you’re half in the grave,*  
*But I ain’t dead yet.*  
*And I’ve got something to say*  
*Oh-Ohh yeah.”*  


I watched the inside of the bar, but I couldn’t see her anywhere. I turned and looked behind me, and when I turned around again, he was there.  
“Hi.” He had a deep voice and he was tall. A Carhartt jacket, jeans, and boots. God, he was hot.  
“Hi.”  
“You seem like you could really use someone to talk to. Can I sit down?”  
I smiled and I looked at Charlie. He cocked his head and told me he thought that would be alright.  
“[Sure](https://www.reddit.com/r/tinyhorribles/).”
