You read that right.

I was on my way to Nox, a small place in Obscurité, I was supposed to meet a client. So pretty weird cult summoning stuff.

Well, I was **supposed**, but I couldn't get there on time.

I was riding my car in a road in a forest,  then suddenly, a deer jumped right to the way, Obscurité is full of that creatures.
It just stared and glared at my car, my lights weren't on, but it still, just stared.

Then I saw a figure, humanoid, they had a gas mask, and a red cape. They looked like they were standing there for years, with literal moss and ivy climbing up their legs and chest, there was a yellow glow behind the mask.

Then they slowly raised a revolver (which was not in their hands a moment ago), and shot the deer.

The deer started to scream and convulse violently, big chunks of meat falling from it's body, until there was only its skeleton.

I knew what would probably happen next, so I ran over the deer, and started driving the car as fast as I can.

Nuclear bullets, supernatural mercs definitely loved those things.
They would first make your body get destroyed in various horrible ways, then you'll die, and your meat melts, and turns into something horrible.

Now, you are probably asking, "How the hell do you know about these things?!"
I'm... kinda a freelancer, but I specialize in the supernatural.

Anyways, I was driving the car as fast as I could, then, I heard a loud thumping, something just hit the roof of my car.

Then it **tore apart** the roof of my car, as I looked up, I expected to see some horrid creature, and I was right.

It looked like something out of a psycho's nightmare, no skin, no other organs than a giant,  disgusting mouth from the top of its head to its stomach, with six long arms with bones like chainsaws instead of hands.

It was frightening, yes, but for someone who has done my job long enough, it really doesn't matter after some point.

I hit the gas, and prayed to find something to find to shoot this thing.
And I found something, my trusty old shotgun.

I mean, you need to be ready for things like these if you are into the supernatural.

I aimed at the thing, which was trying to get inside my car now, and shot it. Multiple times.

Now, normally, these things doesn't stay dead for long, so I just needed to distract it for long enough so I could get the hell out of this forest.

And, with some miracle, it happened.
I finally got off to a highway, and started going to Nox.

When I arrived at the hotel I booked, my client was not there.
I asked the hotel staff, and they said someone came to my room earlier, then left.

I rushed to my room, entered, amd found a newspaper on my bed.

"Local journalist arrested for suspicious activities and the attempt of break-in!
Authorities claimed that the suspect was caught trying to break-in to an old storage building, the suspect is also in suspicions of cult activities."

There's a hand-written note with red ink on the newspaper,

"*Ave Imperatori.*"
