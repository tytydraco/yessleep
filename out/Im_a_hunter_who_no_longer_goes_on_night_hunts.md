My hobby is hunting, yet recent events have shattered my passion for it. I find myself haunted by what I witnessed, struggling to grasp its true nature. But my gut tells me it wasn't anything good, and it's only luck that I'm still here to share this story.

It all started quite ordinarily. It was evening, shortly after sunset. I walked about 4 miles into the woods, to one of my usual spots. I settled in on a tree and began my observations using a thermal imaging scope. I've never been afraid of the forest at night - on the contrary, nocturnal hunting always gave me a healthy adrenaline rush. I'm the kind of person who keeps a cool head in most situations, and I had a sense that as long as I stuck to the rules, nothing bad could happen to me. So, I was calm, focused on my task, scanning for prey among the trees. The sounds coming from all around didn't scare me - the forest is a lively organism, never silent. That's part of its charm for me.

After about two hours without any noteworthy events, I decided to change my location, leaving the tree and venturing deeper into the woods. After some time, I finally heard a familiar sound, echoing as an animal made its way through the forest thickets. I pressed the scope against my eye, trying to locate the source of the sound. And there it was. Quite far away, I caught a glimpse of the silhouette of a living creature, appearing and disappearing behind the tree trunks. But one didn't need to be an expert to conclude that it wasn't any animal. Or at least, not any known to science.

The creature looked like a naked, white man of undetermined age. It moved cautiously, glancing around, occasionally stopping and clearly sniffing. While at first I thought someone must have simply gotten lost in the woods, it was the sniffing that made me feel uneasy. It was too animalistic. The whole behavior of this person wasn't human, and certainly didn't resemble that of a lost individual. This was someone or something searching for something specific and it was determined to achieve its goal. I probably should have run for it then, but my rational mind still tried to convince me that it was just a person in need of help. However, I wasn't foolish enough to approach it or otherwise reveal my presence. I kept watching.

Unexpectedly, the creature dropped to all fours and began intensely sniffing around one of the trees, circling it and scanning its canopy with its gaze. Something told me it wasn't just any tree but the one I had been sitting in just 15 minutes ago. At that moment, fear finally caught up with me. Whatever was happening, whatever it was, the whole situation was just fucked up. With every fiber of my being, I felt like I shouldn't have been there, that whatever I saw wasn't meant for my eyes. Then something happened that made my vision blur, and cold sweat drenched my body. That man began to scream, his voice filled with fear:

*"Hello? Is anyone there? I'm lost, please, help me!"*

But that wasn't a man's voice. It was definitely the high-pitched voice of a young woman. Faced with the incomprehensible, I began to question my sanity. I wasn't drunk, I wasn't under the influence of drugs, yet I was witnessing something that simply shouldn't be happening. All those thoughts flew out of my head in one moment when I realized it was slowly approaching me. It noticed me. I would never shoot at a person, but at that moment, I raised my weapon and shouted a warning for them not to come any closer. That creature ignored my warning and was approaching faster and faster. In a panic, I decided to shoot, aiming above its head. Then it stopped. It was about 150 feet away from me. I saw its pale face contorted in a grimace and black eyes devoid of whites. It was looking at me and again called out with a voice that belonged to a woman, this time with a clear hint of mockery:

*"Please help me! I'm lost and can't find my way home!"*

Well, that was it for me. I weakly shouted for it to leave me alone or I would shoot, and this time I'd hit my mark. Then, I turned and started running. I ran as fast as I could, scraping my skin on sharp branches, stumbling over uneven ground. I glanced over my shoulder from time to time, but I didn't see that creature behind me. I didn't stop; I felt like my life depended on escaping from that cursed forest. I don't know how it's possible, but I made it. I started crying with relief when I spotted the clearing where my car was parked. I got in and drove away as fast as I could. I'm not religious, but at that moment, I thanked God for saving my life.

I've never told anyone about what I saw. Friends and family would think I'm crazy, that's for sure. Since that incident, I haven't set foot in the forest at night, and I don't intend to do that ever again. I don't know what it was, and I prefer not to find out. I guess you could say that on that night, the hunter was almost the prey. Now I believe that some things belong in the realm of darkness, and it's best not to disturb them. I won't make that mistake again, and neither should you.
