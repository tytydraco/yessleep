Carefully and quietly, my wife and I got up from the bed. Adrenaline coursed through my body as I made my way to the door. Cracking it open, I peeked out through the small slit. 

The primary bedroom was two doors away from the stairs, an empty bedroom between it and us. The only other room on this floor was the bathroom at our end of the hall. If that woman was coming up the stairs, I had to pray she would check the empty bedroom first. Then, once she was in there, we could hide in the bathroom then move to the empty room when she was in the primary. A deathly game of musical chairs.

I stared at the top of the stairs, waiting for the figure to arrive. I felt my jaw clench and unclench, my grip tightening on the doorknob. It was as if my body was preparing to flee, checking the muscles to make sure they were working. 

Suddenly, a rush of cold air swept over the hallway, leeching behind our door and into my bones. Then, a black-blue foot stepped onto the hallway, followed by another. 

The apparition was a ghastly sight. Sagging, raggedy skin clung to her thin frame. She wore a tattered gray dress only a few shades lighter than her tangled black hair. Her dress and hair floated eerily around her, as if underwater. Her bony hand gripped the banister, the black chipped nails digging into the wood. She glanced down the hallway, sharp pale eyes sunken into her emaciated face. Thin black lips ringed her mouth, holding back pointed yellow teeth. 

For a moment, she seemed to look right at me, then she walked to the nearest door and opened it. I flew back to my wife and grabbed her arm. 

“We have to go,” I whispered urgently. She nodded and followed me back to the door. I peeked outside and, seeing that the hall was still empty, dragged my wife out of the primary bedroom and into the bathroom down the hall. 

Just as I closed that door, I heard the woman open the first door. Her feet creaked along the hallway floor as she made her way toward us. We were trapped. If she checked this room before the primary, there was nowhere for us to hide. 

I pressed my ear against the door, straining to hear. The footsteps had stopped, but I didn’t know where. Then, I heard the door to the primary bedroom open. 

I turned to my wife, grabbing her by the shoulders and looking right into her eyes. 

“Listen to me.” I said, my voice low and urgent. “The woman is in the primary bedroom. You and I are going to run to the first bedroom she checked. Then, we’ll be safe for the rest of the night. She won’t go back in there. Okay?”

My wife looked at me, tears staining her face, then she nodded. 

“Okay, we have to go now. We don’t have much time.” I grabbed her hand and pulled the door open. We ran down the hallway, the short distance seeming like a football field.

We were just about to pass the primary bedroom when the door began to creak open. My wife gasped and pulled out of my grip. I tried to hold on, but she wriggled away in fear, stumbling backwards to avoid the woman seeing her.

I turned my head, but momentum carried the rest of my body forward. I opened my mouth to cry out, but I didn’t have time. I went through the bedroom door while my wife retreated back into the bathroom. 

Back to where the woman would be visiting next. 

I wanted to shout, wanted to do anything to stop the woman from advancing down the hallway, but my mouth was glued shut, my feet frozen to the ground. 

I watched from behind the cracked bedroom door. I watched as the woman’s bony hand reached for the bathroom door’s handle. I watched as she twisted it slowly, and I prayed that my wife had gotten out, climbed out of the window if necessary. 

Silently, the woman drifted into the room, shutting the door behind her. I strained my ears, turning my head to hear better. But I heard nothing. The house was empty, the only sound the settling of its bones. 

Then, the woman opened the door and stepped into the hallway. I held my breath, waiting to see what happened. 

But nothing did.

She simply closed the door and made her way back through the hallway and down the stairs. The moment she turned her back to me, I sprinted quietly from the bedroom to the bathroom. 

I scrambled for the doorknob and threw the door open, not knowing what to expect. 

Moonlight filtered in through the window, and it took my eyes a moment to adjust. I looked around for my wife and saw her sitting on the edge of the tub. I moved to embrace her but something held me back. 

Something was wrong with her. 

She sat ramrod straight, her feet planted on the ground, her hands resting on her knees. She stared straight forward. 

“Tess?” I said, my voice low and shaky. She didn’t respond. I moved closer, whispering her name again. 

With each step, I realized what was wrong. At first I had thought it was just the moonlight, but her skin had become the same mottled black-blue as the woman. Her eyes, a beautiful hazel before, were now fully black.

I gasped and stepped back. 

She didn’t respond, just continued staring straight ahead. Then, as if on command, she shot to her feet. She took a creaky step forward, cold from her body washing over me. We were only a foot or two away from one another, but she didn’t seem to see me. She took another step forward, her face only inches from mine now. 

Small cracks spiderwebbed across her blue skin, like broken china. Her lips were chapped and ragged, and I saw them move ever so slightly. 

“Help me,” came the slightest of whispers from her mouth. Then, she took another step, this time toward the door. I grabbed her arm, pulling to keep her with me. Somewhere inside that body, my wife was trapped but still aware. It didn’t matter how hard I pulled though. She continued to step forward, making her way out of the bathroom and down the hallway.

“Help me,” came the desperate cry again, this time slightly louder. My energy renewed, and I pulled again, but she was too strong. 

She was at the stairs now, descending each step. I grabbed onto the handrail,  but it was no use. We continued down the stairs and into the main hallway. 

The basement door stood open, an eerie gray light emanating from its depths. My wife stepped closer to it, the air growing colder each time. 

“Please, help me,” she said through unmoving lips, fighting her own body.

We were now only feet from the basement door. I pulled, but to no avail. 

She was at the threshold to the basement stairs now. I stood in its frame then looked down.

The woman was waiting at the bottom of the stairs, her pale eyes staring back up at us. I gasped and let go of my wife, who took the first step then the next. Halfway down, her head turned to face me. 

For a single moment, fear played across her face. 
“Kill me,” she whispered. Then the expression was gone, and her head turned back around.
