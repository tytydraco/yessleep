I should clarify, I don't necessarily believe in ghosts, I honestly hadn't thought about Elliot in years. I'm not sure why I'm even writing this down, I just don't know what else to do.

Our house is pretty old, it was built back in the early 1900's, but we've renovated since we moved here when i was young (about twenty years ago,) so it's not creepy in anyway, but we joke that it's haunted. I remember years ago, my sister claimed she saw a ghost.

"What do you mean?"

She shrugged, as if it was nothing.

"There was a little boy in a red shirt in the bathroom, i thought it was Charlie, so i told him to hurry up and get in the car, then he was gone."

Charlie is my younger brother, she told me this about a decade ago, when he would have been around five, and I remember being fascinated with the story.

It feels a bit silly now, but i was twelve, and a weird kid, so i went ghost hunting in my bathroom. I never found anything- not surprising, as my only equipment was a toy net i had taken from some poor kid at school. I can't remember what I thought that would do against the ghost of a five year old, but it made sense at the time.

It was a few years before i thought about it again, when my younger sister Alana mentioned that she had seen the boy in the red shirt as well, although it was many years before she told me. It was never scary, just a fun story to tell to friends at a sleepover to freak them out, telling them the house was haunted.

Still, it stuck with me. I decided to call him Elliot, it seemed to fit the short description i had, and the ghost story got more details the more i told it. A little boy named Elliot who lived in the house in 1920, he drowned in a mine nearby and still wanders around his old house a century later. I wonder if I created him.

Neither of my sisters ever saw Elliot again. They said they never felt scared or in danger when they had, so i figured that if he was real, he was a harmless ghost that disappeared well over a decade ago. 

I got older, forgot about the haunted house story, and the supposed sighting of this little boy, and life moved on.

At least i thought it did. a few weeks ago, the floorboards in the corner of my room creaked. This was nothing new, it was an old house and a windy night, there was bound to be some creepy noises. But something about this was different. My blood ran cold and i thought my heart would explode, even if only for a split second. I didn't know why, but I just felt uncomfortable. Not knowing what else to do, I made my dog stay in my room with me, and just went to bed. 

Two days later i had forgotten about it, until again, i felt a deep sense of discomfort, of just general wrongness. I couldn't figure out what it was for a minute, sitting at my desk on edge and listening for any noise, neck prickling, when i recognised it. Something was watching me.

this happened for about a week, every now and then i would feel it, the air would grow stale, the crickets go quiet, and i felt the now familiar uneasiness.

when i told my friends, they claimed i was being haunted, telling me to move out, claiming they would never step foot in my house again. i'm sure many of you might say the same, leave and never come back, but you have to understand my mindset at the time.

this was the house i grew up in, i had never seen or heard anything wrong. The only unnatural thing that had happened in the twenty years of living here was the supposed sighting of a harmless five year old ghost who had disappeared long ago. i was in my room, there was nothing scary about it any other time, cheap fairy lights strung up and posters on the walls. a few moment of discomfort wasn't enough to send me running. besides, i couldn't afford to move out, i was struggling through art school living at my parents house on a wage of two shifts a week at the news agency up rhe road. This wasn't a horror movie, just an odd feeling every now and then.

after about a week and a half of the unsettling feelings becoming increasingly more common, i woke up at some time in the night while my dog growling at the corner of the room. i didn't think much of it, still half asleep, until i turned on the light to calm her down. there was someone hiding under the floorboards.

i don't know how i knew, nothing seemed to be there at all, yet Somehow i could almost see it. it was big, and it was still, and it was watching me. 

i stayed on the couch for days after that. and every night, i could feel it. silent, hiding, watching. 

i felt awful, i couldn't sleep more than an hour at a time, couldn't shake the feeling, couldn't stop staring at my closed bedroom door. it was constant after that, its Eyes on me wherever i was in the house, and i jumped at every small noise around me, waiting for it to climb out of the floor and get me.

i was beginning to think i was crazy, so i went to my doctor, explaining how i was being watched, shuddering just thinking about it. i'm not sure if it was the bags under my eyes, or my frantic tone, but she spoke in long words about the effects of sleep deprivation, and sent me home with a prescription for sleeping pills. I must have convinced myself it was only that, returned to my room that night feeling fine, took the pill and slept in my own bed for the first time in days. 

that night, for the first time, i saw it.
my dog was growling from the door, and crouched in the corner was a crude attempt at a human form.

i couldn't move, i couldn't breathe, i just stared in horror at this thing in the corner. the arms and legs were too long, bent unnaturally to press itself down as flat as possible. it looked like a body fallen from a building, a broken form twisting its head back against the floor and staring with unblinking eyes.

i don't know how long i sat petrified, unable to take my eyes off it. it might've been minutes, might've been hours, but i felt like i had spent days staring into those blank empty eyes in the darkness. i don't know what happened next, if i had fallen asleep or fainted, but the sun was up and it was hidden again, watching motionless from under the floor. 

i left the room the second i could get my muscles moving again, mind racing as i tried to comprehend what the fuck i had seen. had some malnourished hobo hidden away in my room while i avoided it? was it some sleep paralysis from medication? i made my dad check the crawl space under my bedroom, leaving out the part about the humanoid creature, and he returned covered in dust and coughing. no one was there, no one had been there for ages.

for the first time in years, i slept in my parents room that night. they seemed confused when i asked, but set up a mattress with only a few concerned glances towards me. the light stayed on, my mum snored loudly, and it was in the corner again. 

it looked even more uncanny in the light- the skin was pale and stretched over limbs, its face didn't fit quite right, like a mask with dead eyes. the clothes were dirty and too small, i could see ribs rise and fall too fast under a shrunken red shirt. 

it was trying to look like a child, bandaids on the bony knees bent under its body, bruised rosy cheeks and missing front teeth. it was pretending to be Elliot.

it didn't go away when the sun came up, when my parents got ready and went to work, when Charlie put a bowl of cereal next to my makeshift bed, when he replaced it hours later with lunch. it didn't look away, it didn't blink, it didn't leave. it stared from the corner with its Mouth  slightly open and its body contorted and pressd to the carpet.

i didn't sleep, i didn't eat, i didn't look away, and niether did he. i was at the doctors office, it was unnder the desk. i was in the car, it was in the back sseat. people tried to speak me to me ,it stared it open  mouthed with a heaving chest  and distorted Face, thsi thing trying to lookk like a ghost boy i never saw, inching closer  by the d ay without moving a muscle.

i don't  Know what it wwants, i don't know what  it is, idon't know how to make it go  away. if anyone  has Experienced something similarr to thsi, please help  me it's been  weeks it it won't  stop lookking  at mme
