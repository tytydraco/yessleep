I recently bought a house on the edge of a big forest. My father passed away when I was 19, and since my parents were divorced I inherited everything myself. After my father’s passing, I had trouble focusing on school so while I was supposed to graduate when I turned 21, I only just graduated this year after turning 24. After finishing school I bought a beautiful old house on the edge of a giant forest on the edge of my childhood town.
I wanted to turn this house into a bed and breakfast but it needed a lot of renovating.

While renovating this house I’m living in it myself as right now I cannot afford a second house to live in.
The house came with some old floodlights that illuminate the first line of trees in the backyard, making for a beautiful scene when eating dinner.
Every night when I can’t sleep because of my paranoia, I go to my window and look out to the trees and the night sky.

Now here’s where the first strange thing happens, a couple of times when looking outside between 1 and 4 am I could see strange flickering lights in the woods. It almost looked like reflections of a bunch of disco balls in the forest. But the strangest part is the fact that I could clearly see them move. I never really thought anything of it and just brushed it off as some fireflies or something similar.

This strange phenomenon still keeps going on to this day months later.
However, a couple of weeks after moving in I woke up one night to strange noises. I swear it sounded like scratching at the old wooden doors and windows downstairs. I never got the courage to get up and go look as I am incredibly paranoid and still check my closet before bed every night at 24 years old.

I did however put a night vision camera down after those sounds happened the second night in a row. I also put some eggs and other food scraps in front of the camera as this always seemed to work when I was a child.

This is where things turn increasingly worrying. I had been putting this camera down for a couple of days and every morning when I went to check, the camera was either turned around, flipped down or sometimes even completely somewhere else. This made me think it’s some guy pranking me. However, every single morning all the food was gone and there were never any footprints on the grass in the mud or anywhere else. Even on rainy muddy nights there was no trace of what took the food.

I had a terrible feeling every morning when I looked outside and saw the camera was gone again. I just knew deep down this was something more, something else other than a human or some other animal.

On a friday night after working hard the whole day I noticed I forgot to put the camera outside after putting the food out, I thought to myself “I’m not going out there in the middle of the night with the food there already” so I decided to take another look at the footage I already had from the countless times before.
I then noticed something I hadn’t noticed before.
Every single time before the camera got knocked over, it turned quiet. And I mean completely quiet, as if the sound glitched or got removed. No more owls or nightly animals, just silence. Then skipping an hour forward the noises returned. This happened on every single video, every. Single. One.

This same scene kept going on and on for months until finally when working on the garden I had a wooden fence put down.

After I put the fence down I thought it would be useless putting the camera and the food down again as there was no way this animal could get in my backyard anymore.

I went to sleep and when I woke up, I went to the kitchen looking out into the backyard when my heart sank into what felt like an endless abyss.
The newly placed fence was completely demolished, there was a massive hole in the middle of the fence about a full meter wide. 
I know what you’re thinking but there are no bears in my area, not even in my country. I have no clue what bursted through my fence that night and neither did the authorities.

That is the reason I posted this, this happened just this monday and I have no clue what to do next. The scary part is that I found wood splinters all the way towards where I usually put the food out. Still, there was not a trace of any footsteps or animal traces.

I haven’t slept in the house since that night and I’ve stayed this week back at my moms house as I’m honestly too scared to go back there unless it’s bright daylight.

I wanted to post this here to ask you guys: what is this? What did I accidentally lure into my backyard? And how do I get rid of it.
