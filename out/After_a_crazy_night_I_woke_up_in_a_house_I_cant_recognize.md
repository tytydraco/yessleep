I have finally awoken from the longest nap. For a second, I thought I died and this is heaven, with the sunshine hitting my eyes directly, and angels singing lullabies. My body aches, and my mind is filled with distant scenarios from last night: blurry moments I am unable to tell apart. 

The last thing I remember is laughing and drinking with my friends from around the block, going from one bar to another looking for any fun we could get. Michael bet everyone he could get the most girls that night. I giggle as he has never had a girlfriend before, and all the others think he might be secretly gay. 

Suddenly, the remembering stops, as I look around to notice I am completely unaware of where I am: an unknown room never seen before. As I decide to venture deeper into the house, all the pain pours in like a water cascade; my knee, ankle, the headache, the buzzing in my ear; it feels like a car suddenly flashing every icon on the dashboard at once. Unfortunately, the more I explore, the less I recognize; so far not even a single item in sight I could remember. 

I decided to lay on the nearest couch and let the memories come back together, but only glimpses come from last night. I remember a bottle of some drink one of my friends smuggled from his father's bar in downtown. Although the taste was so strong, I managed to drink most of it to prove I was the bravest; big mistake, as I spent the rest of the night semi-consciously, throwing up violently, promising to never drink again just to finish half a bottle of Vodka just an hour later.

I think I saw Robert kissing a girl at a bar minutes after her boyfriend left because of some stupid arguments they had. Robert has never missed any opportunity, especially with a girl. Unfortunately for him, her boyfriend came back with a few of his friends while he had his tongue inside her... I hope they did not beat him so badly.

I stand up to continue my adventure and try to piece together the events of last night. I spot someone in the house, an older gentleman looking at me from within the wall; he seems confused but as I try to walk closer, he slowly disappears, as if he only lives inside the wall. I stop thinking about it; with all the alcohol I drank, I cannot rely on anything my eyes see until I sober up completely. Then I see her. A beautiful girl, with perfect dimensions, and such a gentle face, not older than 25. I do not remember her at all, but that explains everything; my friends must be so envious of me. She is even prettier than the girl Robert kissed, or any girl Michael could have dreamed of having. 

I slowly walk towards her, and as our eyes meet, she gives me a warm smile and a friendly look. I feel like an awful person; such a pretty girl with her perfect smile, being so joyful and welcoming with me, and I have no memories of her. As I finally close the distance between us, and before my mouth could open to say any word, she shouts: "Mom, grandpa is awake now."
