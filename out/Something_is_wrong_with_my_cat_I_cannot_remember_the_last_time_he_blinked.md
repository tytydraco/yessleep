I got a new kitten a month ago. I wasn’t planning on getting a cat because, honestly, I’m really horrible at taking care of things, including myself. I’d always wanted one but, considering I forget to brush my teeth for days, I didn’t think I’d be the best cat parent. Well, last month a mate of mine fell into some debt over a passing relative and he could no longer take care of his cat and her recently born litter. Some people from our friend group took in two kittens, some none, and I, eventually, agreed to take the last one. He was the runt of the litter, not even close in size to the other ones, but he had the most beautiful orange fur and the cutest little face. I couldn’t help myself. Anyway, I took him home and thought he would be scared of the new environment and me. Turns out, he was also the bravest little kitten, because he took the house and me almost immediately. The second he was out of his carrier, he was running around the living room with his tail straight out, yowling happily from every new corner and hiding place he found. I also was soft for him immediately. I called him Fanta Pants. Fanta for short.

Fanta and I had the best first two weeks together. I managed to harness train him in days and took him on my morning and midnight walks around the neighbourhood. He became quick friends with the neighbour’s Pomeranian, Puff, and they started playing together in the front yards and driveways (with my supervision of course). He learned the outlay of the house so well that he started playing hide and seek with me. While that freaked me out the first couple times, it soon became almost ritual for us to play it once every day, just about before dinner. I felt myself slowly becoming happier than before, which isn’t much of an achievement for me and my long-term depression disorder but, for once, I didn’t feel alone. I’m not one to believe in these things, but I almost felt like I found a soulmate. He even sat on my chest and comforted me all night on the anniversary of my wife’s passing. It was like he knew and understood, and I felt all the better with him.

It all seemed too good to be true. Turns out, it was. 

Two weeks ago– exactly two weeks now, actually– something changed. I woke up and Fanta wasn’t lying on the pillow next to me, snoring away softly while waiting for me to wake up. Instead, I noticed him sitting by the bedroom door, staring at me intensely and with no movement. His tail wasn’t wagging nor straight up, his eyes were round and wide but not bright with the joy of day, and he seemed… odd. It took a couple minutes of me staring back at him and observing to realise that he wasn’t blinking. At all. I jumped out of bed in concern and went to check on him, but he walked off, strangely casually, to the living room downstairs. I followed him and watched him as he jumped up to the top of his cat tree and, again, sat still, staring out the window at the yard. I snuck up slowly and tried to pet his back, from which he shifted away, and then I watched his eyes, waiting for a blink, a twitch, anything. Nothing.

I called out of work sick that day. I managed to catch him and get him in his carrier, and we went off to the vet. The whole time we were in with her, I was sweating, scared that he’d caught some type of disease and he was going to die, or that I’d failed him and let him get poisoned from something, or even that Puff had done something. No, none of that. The vet said he was all healthy, nothing looked off, and that he was probably stressed out about something. That didn’t seem right to me, but what did I know? I am no vet, she checked him. He had to be okay. So, I brought him home and released him in the house. I thought he’d do his usual roaming and exploring. He went to the cat tree and, again, sat at the top leaf and stared out at the yard, unmoving, unblinking. I left him there for the day.

One day of this turned into two, then four, then a week, and now two weeks. It’s been two weeks of me waking up to him staring at me from the doorway, then moving downstairs to the cat tree to stare outside until late hours of the night, not eating and not drinking all day. I called the vet maybe three more times because it didn’t make sense and it didn’t feel right. No matter how much I explained to her that regardless of him not eating or drinking he hadn’t lost any weight, she kept telling me she found nothing and it’s likely just him maturing slowly. I decided to change vets a few days ago and found one half an hour away who claimed to specialise in behavioural issues. Tomorrow is our first appointment. I don’t know if I can last until tomorrow.

Three days ago, Fanta began to scare me. Really.. scare me. I sat on the couch on Sunday to observe him, see if I could figure out what was wrong. I was convinced he would just keep staring out the window as he had been so far, and he did for about half an hour. But then, after no more than a minute or two of not doing so, I looked up at him and realised he was peering into me. He had the same look as he did when he stared outside, but it felt so much more intense, piercing like a knife through my face. I cannot even describe the chill that sent through me, especially as we stared at each other for minutes, maybe even a whole hour, neither one of us moving, him not blinking. 

Blink, for the love of God. Blink!

I left him downstairs that night, but then it got worse. I woke up on Monday morning with him sitting on my chest, staring at me, just as he had done so from the door before. I left him at home while I went to work, but when I went to check on him through the camera feed in the living room, he was there too. He was sitting on the TV stand, in front of the camera, staring right into it. Into me. He didn’t even understand what that camera was before all this started. Then he was staring at me in the bathroom as I showered, sitting on the toilet lid. Then on the dining room table. I closed my bedroom door that night.

On Tuesday morning, he was on my chest again. The door was still closed. I had no clue how he’d gotten in there. I locked him in the spare bedroom before I left for work. When I came back home, he was waiting for me by the front door. The bedroom door was still closed and fully locked. The third time I left him in the bathroom with the living room camera moved there. I sat on the couch, turned on the live feed on my phone, and just watched. I watched for hours and hours as he just sat there, right in front of the camera, staring back at me. He couldn’t have actually been watching me, but it felt like he was. It felt like he could see me more than I saw him. 

I must have fallen asleep at some point without realising because I woke up in the middle of the night. The room was pitch black and I could only see the light of my phone screen along with a low battery message. I sat up and dismissed the message, only to realise Fanta was not in frame anymore. He wasn’t in the bathroom. I freaked out and frantically looked around, trying to spot him in the darkness. I didn’t see him on the couch, or on the table, or even on the cat tree. I ran to the light switch and flipped it on, but it took a few seconds for my vision to adjust. And then, I finally spotted him. He was sitting where I had just been laying on the couch, wide eyes on me. Staring. How? How can this be possible?

I left the house. I went to my car and that is where I have been this whole time. It’s currently 12:49pm, and I didn’t turn up to work. I spent the first few hours here trying not to fall asleep out of fear that he would somehow break his way in here. When the sun rose, I finally turned my phone back on with the charger in the car and tried to research. I looked up everything. 

Why is my cat not blinking?

Why is my cat just staring at me?

Why won’t my cat eat or drink anything?

Why is my cat acting weird?

Can a cat be possessed?

I believe by the end of it I might have gotten delirious. I’m not sure though because, at some time around 10am, I had fallen asleep again.

I woke up maybe fifteen minutes ago. He’s here. He’s in the car. He’s sitting in the middle of the backseat, staring at me through the rearview mirror. His eyes aren’t the right colour. They’re green like before, yes, but they’re not… right. Not the right green. I have run out of options, I don’t know what to do. I feel like if I close my eyes for longer than a few seconds, something horrible will happen. 

I’m watching him now through the mirror, too. Our eyes are locked, and I’m relying on autocorrect to assure what I’m writing is correct. His eyes are.. almost human. They move up and down quickly, minimally enough that if I wasn’t staring, I wouldn’t notice. He’s moving now. He’s coming to the front seat. I’m slowly losing sight of him in the mirror. Shit. I can’t stay here any longer. 

I just escaped the car with a single gash on my arm. Fanta is inside, and he’s entirely feral. He’s running back and forth between the front and backseat completely destroying my car. The filling of the seats from underneath the leather is flying, and I’m honestly scared his force is going to shatter the windows. He’s bigger. Much, much bigger. But, at long as I watch him, he can’t sneak up on me. He can’t. The only times he got close— without in the car— were when I wasn’t watching him. So, I will stare at him now. I will keep staring, and I will call the police, or animal control, or whoever can deal with this creature, and watch. 

He still hasn’t blinked.
