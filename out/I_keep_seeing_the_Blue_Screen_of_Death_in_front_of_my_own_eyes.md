Has anyone here ever seen the “blue screen of death” in real life? Like the error message that pops up when a computer crashes. I’ve seen it in multiple times now.

No, I am not a robot or AI or any of that bullshit. I’ve seen Blade Runner and The Matrix and that one anime movie, and I assure you I am human. My memories are not implants, my parents are not programs, my emotions are not software. Blood runs through my veins. It certainly wasn’t motor oil that spilled out when I cut my arm open to check.

This started a few weeks ago. I was standing in the kitchen at work when I suddenly heard the sort of staticky, scraping sound that a speaker starts to make when you mess around with the connection point too much.

Static popped like a whip in my eardrums, and suddenly I couldn’t hear anything.

I remember seeing a look of concern on my coworker’s face before a bright, blue light flashed before my eyes, then I woke up in a hospital bed.

They did a bunch of tests, took my blood pressure and all that, then they just sent me home with no explanation as to why I had fainted. I was perfectly healthy.

The doctor told me it was pretty normal for people to see flashing lights when they pass out, but he didn’t seem to understand when I tried to explain the auditory phenomenon I had experienced just before losing consciousness.

It sounded purely mechanical. The indistinguishable sound of an electronic device failing. It felt so foreign coming from my own body, and the doctor insisted that I must have imagined it.

I tried my best to move on from that incident, but things have only escalated since.

The next time I passed out, I was in the shower. This time, the blue light stuck around for about a second. Long enough for me to see that it wasn’t just a blue light.

Google “blue screen of death,” and you’ll see literally exactly what I saw. There was text. Actual digital typeface, right before my eyes. It looked outdated. Analogue. It looked like fucking Windows 95.

The only difference is that I can’t read the text. Every time I’ve seen it, it only lasts for a second at most. I don’t even have time to memorize a single word, but it looks like Latin or something.

I told my therapist, and they said that there’s a good chance I’m imagining it. But that’s bullshit. My tests came back clean. I’ve had no history of anything like this. Nobody can explain the combination of what I’m hearing and what I’m seeing before I pass out.

I found one person online who told me they were experiencing the same thing, but they suddenly stopped responding yesterday. I’m getting really scared.

I’ve seen it like 10 times now. I keep losing consciousness more and more. In the middle of eating, in the middle of talking on the phone… I’ll just shut down and wake back up an hour later. I don’t know if it’s exactly at the hour. I have no way of timing it.

I haven’t driven anywhere since the shower. I’m afraid of crashing on the road.
I’m afraid to leave the house. I’m afraid to go anywhere or do anything. I have no idea how to stop it, and I have no way of telling when it will happen next,
