The weather in the past few months here in British Columbia has been utterly terrible. Rain after rain after rain. Every single day. Last year at least had the decency of having the wintertime cloudy, rainy, and sunny. But now it is just pouring. Every single day. 24/7.

To add to my already terrible luck, the only feasible way to get to work is to walk through this absurdly large park in the pouring rain. I mean, yes, I could drive, but the rush hour traffic would tack on 20 minutes to my commute compared to just walking. I tried biking a few times and almost got hit by a car on the road. I nearly kicked the bucket when I fell off my bike and rolled down a small hill in the park, almost hitting my head on a large tree. So biking is out of the question.

Well, after today, I might consider taking the car or quitting my job altogether.

It started an hour or so ago, around 5:15 PM. I was walking through the park with my umbrella, my coat, and my backpack. It was pouring heavily. All you could hear were the drops hitting the leaves, the trees, the ground. Anything, really. No one other than myself was stupid enough to walk through the park, so I was all by myself. Which I usually consider nice, since I like to talk to myself and perhaps argue a little, especially about stupid things that I’ve done. Human brains work in mysterious ways.

Today, I was arguing with myself about why people couldn’t follow the simple instructions I made for labeling images for object detection model training. Was I too detailed? Not detailed enough? Were the other employees too technically illiterate to do this? I don’t know. Beats me. It was what I was arguing with myself about at the time.

That’s when I heard sounds. Splashing sounds. Like footsteps in the distance behind me. They were loud too. Unusually loud. I turned around and saw nothing. Just the trees, the bushes, the grass, and the rain. I heard cars honking and people yelling in the distance too, so I remember just ignoring it and continuing my walk.

Then, I heard it again. I turned around and was met with the same scenery of a park and pouring rain. I stood still for about 30 seconds. That moment spooked me out, especially since everything suddenly felt quiet. No sounds of traffic or people screaming. Just rain drizzling onto the ground.

I decided to continue walking at a much faster pace. The clock on my phone said 5:27 PM, which meant I had another 18 minutes or so to walk until I passed through the park.

For about four minutes, I heard nothing but the rain. Then, I heard it again. The sounds of splashes. This time, they sounded heavier, like an adult jumping into a puddle. I decided not to turn around this time. I just kept walking, thinking it was my paranoia kicking in, or perhaps the highly unlikely chance of my footsteps echoing behind me.

Considering that the echoes might actually be possible, I decided to stop walking suddenly. To my surprise, the splashing sounds behind me did not. What’s more horrifying was that the splashing appeared to be approaching me, and they did not match my walking pace. This meant that someone or something was really behind me. Following me.

I turned around, hoping to face whatever it was that was stalking me. To my relief—or surprise, or both—I was met with nothing. Just the trees, the ferns, the bushes, and the rain. A false sense of relief washed over me. I took a deep breath but paused for a moment when I realized that this person or thing could be hiding behind the trees or the bushes. Now, I was panicking.

Scanning my surroundings again, I was met with nothing, accompanied by the absence of those unusual splashes. Like a sentinel, I stood there, watching for a good minute or so. And I found nothing unusual.

Normally, this would be a good thing, but it did not calm me. In fact, it did quite the opposite—I was in full-blown panic mode.

I decided to high-tail it out of there. I ran as fast as I could out of the park. That’s when I heard the splashing sounds again. Following me, but at a faster running pace than myself. I could hear the sounds closing the distance at an extremely fast pace. In my head, I was thinking that there was no way I could outrun this person or thing.

Screw it, I thought, I will just have to fight this thing. So, I grabbed the metal water bottle on the side of my backpack with my right hand and turned around. To my surprise, I was met with nothing.

But then, I noticed that there were no raindrops hitting my head. It was clearly pouring still. I looked up and saw the water splashing against something maybe two feet above me, like rain on a glass windshield. The water appeared to flow above me and finally fall behind me, hitting my umbrella and backpack. I could see the same thing to my right side without moving my head. Water was meeting an invisible glass pipe or something. I could see water splashing on this invisible thing, then flowing downwards before finally dripping off it.

I turned my gaze to the left without turning my head, and my heart nearly stopped. The rain was flowing around something there too, but this time it was different. The water cascaded down in a way that suggested a shape—an outline of something right out of a nightmare. It looked like the rain was outlining a claw, with five sharp, knife-like appendages. The water flowed from the tips of these invisible knives, dripping off in a steady stream.

I felt the absolute alarming urge to not look behind me. Whatever this thing was, it was right here. Right in front of me. And I was at its mercy. My breath came in shallow gasps as I tried to think of a way out.

Then, it came to me. It seemed like it never followed me when I was gazing in its general direction. Maybe I could walk backwards and hope for the best. And maybe, just maybe, get out of this alive.

I slowly walked backwards. Step by step. Foot by foot. While straining my eyes towards this invisible monster. Each step was cautious and slow. If I came across an obstacle, I dared not look down.

I felt like I was roughly six feet away from it before I was able to kind of make out its shape. As the rain splashed on it and the water flowed around it, I could see it was a rather thin, tall thing. It did not seem muscular though. From the curves that I could make out through straining my eyes, it seemed very smooth. Too smooth. Nothing that told me it was remotely humanoid. The difficulty of trying to understand this monster in front of me was that it seemed perfectly invisible, if not for the water outlining it.

Suddenly, I could see its head, or where I thought its head should be, turn towards me. I gasped and lost my balance, falling onto the ground.

I quickly raised my head and turned towards its general direction, my heart pounding in my chest. The rain seemed to avoid me entirely, as if I were under an invisible shield. No water was touching any part of my body, except my nose. I could see water flowing from the top of this invisible thing, cascading down its form like a waterfall. The droplets traced the outline of its knife-like appendage, revealing its terrifying shape. The water dripped off the tips of these invisible knives, landing on top of my nose.

This thing was right on top of me. The appendage hovered just an inch above my nose, close enough for me to feel the cold air emanating from it. I dared not move. The rain continued to pour, masking the sound of my short, panicked breaths. The invisible monster was positioned above me with its claw ready to strike. Yet somehow, my stare prevented it from doing so.

Carefully, I crawled backwards while maintaining my gaze on it. Feeling somewhat comfortably far enough from it, I risked standing up. This time, I did not fall.

I assessed my surroundings without moving my eyes and saw it was getting dark. I took the phone out of my pocket and held it right in front of me. Turning it on, I could see the clock in my peripheral vision.

6:07 PM.

Further adding to my panic, this meant that I had roughly 40 minutes before the sun set. And it seemed that I had half a mile or so left to go in any direction before leaving this God-forsaken park.

Somehow, I made it. I walked backwards slowly for what felt like an eternity, keeping that thing in my sight no matter how strained my eyes were. Thinking about that trek now, I remember noticing that I did not see anyone else in the park. As I got closer to the exit, I did not hear any of the usual traffic. It was only when I left the park that I finally heard the familiar sounds of cars and traffic.

However, this thing made my life hell. When it was out of sight—presumably because I walked far enough or there were too many trees hiding it—I would hear the splashes again. This made me panic as I would wildly look around until the splash sounds finally stopped. This happened so many times, I lost count. At one point, it stood between me and the direction of my home. I almost gave up there, probably from fatigue, but I decided to just walk around it slowly.

When my feet finally touched the pavement of the sidewalk, I knew I was finally out of the park. Suddenly, the clouds dissipated within seconds, and the rain with it. There were tens of people near me, going about their day, walking their dogs. I was extremely relieved.

I inspected the park at a distance, trying to catch a glimpse of this thing. I thought I did, but I got interrupted by a nice old lady. She inquired if I was okay. Oh boy, was I a mess. My pants and shirt were ripped and muddy, my umbrella was bent upside down, and my backpack was open with all its contents spilled out in the park some tens of minutes ago. I told her I was fine, that I fell down a big hill in the park. When I looked back at the park, that thing I thought I saw was not there anymore. I quickly sprinted to my apartment.

Now, I am here on my computer at 8:13 PM, typing everything down before I forget, but I probably never will. Beforehand, I looked up the park’s history and missing persons. Apparently, there have been at least two persons missing a year in this city, last seen at this park. However, there was one news article dated back in the '90s claiming that a man, Arnold, once saw blue lightning flash above the park near the power lines. This was a week before he disappeared.

Last week, I saw blue lightning flash on top of the park while I was working. Today, assuming that there is indeed a correlation, should have marked the day that I would have disappeared. However, the day is not over yet.

I remember saying that I would either use the car or quit my job.

Scratch that.

I am moving out of the province. I think I will go back home to my family in Alberta.

I can do that. I can work from home. Tell them that it’s a family emergency or use my vacation days. Whatever.

This should give me time to decide what to do next.
