First off, my bed is pressed against a wall and therefore nobody can get behind it or anything but there is a small vent behind it on the floor. My whole house is carpeted with beige carpet so you can see everything, and I mean everything if it isn't hidden, I have a dog with heart medication which causes him to pee quite a bit and my floors are disgusting.

 Now this started last month, I dropped my shoe as I getting ready to leave with my father and went to pick it up, noticing that next to that tiny vent there was a strange stain, it was a tan color but I just thought it was from my cat puking up a hairball or something stupid like that since my old cat had liver problems and threw up a lot. I shook it off and ignored it for a while till today, I paint masks and mix colors frequently, I had been working on a new mask that included custom colors for the entire thing and got paint all over my legs and arms so I took a shower so long the water ran cold, when I got out I walked to my room and was about to put my phone on the charger until I noticed the stain, it was bigger and my main focus was that this time, it was red. You could tell where the tan was but it was mainly a fire truck red, seeping in the carpet. It looked like a huge splatter, it stained the bottom of the air vent a light red color.

 I immediately looked behind my bed and there was nothing, at that moment I got a stomach wrenching feeling, a chill went through my body and I went on high alert. I didn't think anything would happen till I heard a knock in my walls, I jumped in fear as I tried to figure out where it was coming from and then, another knock came. It echoed in the vent as the knocking became more persistent and harder, begging me to think about it more, to look for it more, to find it. It was almost like a hypnotic pull, I crept closer to the vent and there I saw a slim faced silhouette with clearly visible eyes, in fact huge, bulging eyes staring up at me happily as if it was proud it finally managed to grab my attention. My heart sank as I darted out of my room and left my home, slamming the door shut as I sprinted as fast as I could, my legs burning and my breathing became heavier. I could hear it banging on my walls in fury.

 I'm currently at my neighbors house waiting for the police to come and investigate, I can still hear the knocking, rattling in my mind. I know I'm safe here but I don't feel like it. I still have that feeling that it's watching me with it's horrific eyes. I still wonder what that stain could have been, though I don't think I want to know.
