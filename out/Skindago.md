Skindago: The Hunger That Walks
An original story 

---

Prologue: The Whispering Woods

The Splitlands were never mapped.

Not properly. The trees grew too close together, their branches tangled like claws reaching for secrets. Paths twisted in on themselves. Landmarks shifted. Compass needles spun like dancers in a trance. Even the birds flew in circles, as if the sky itself had forgotten which way was north.

Locals didn’t try to tame it. They feared it. They spoke of it in hushed tones, like a relative gone mad. They said the forest didn’t want to be known. It wanted to be remembered.

And only by those who survived it.

The wind here didn’t howl—it murmured. It carried voices. Not loud. Not clear. Just enough to make you turn your head. Just enough to make you wonder if someone was calling your name.

Tonight, the wind said Elias.

Chapter 1: The Hunter’s Descent

Elias Crowe had always been a man of silence.

He hunted alone, slept under trees, and spoke only when necessary. The forest was his companion, the cold his teacher. He knew how to track a deer through snowfall, how to read the wind, how to disappear.

But he didn’t know how to resist the whisper.

It started as a flicker—barely a thought. A voice in the back of his mind, soft and warm, like a fire in winter.

> You are starving, it said.  
> Not for meat. For memory.

He ignored it at first. Ate what he caught. Slept when he could. But the hunger didn’t fade. It deepened. It sharpened. It began to shape his dreams.

He wrote in a journal, hoping to hold onto himself.

> “I ate yesterday. A rabbit. Bones and all. Yet I woke starving. Not for meat. For something deeper.”

> “I dreamed of my brother last night. We were children, chasing fireflies. I woke with blood on my hands and a mouth full of fur.”

The forest changed around him.

Animals fled when he approached. The trees bent away. His reflection in the creek began to shift—his eyes too pale, his teeth too sharp. He buried his rifle beneath a cedar stump, afraid of what he might do with it.

He tied himself to a tree with sinew and prayer.

By morning, the bark was chewed.

His hands were bloodied.

He had gnawed through the rope.

And then—just as the last thread of Elias began to fray—he saw her.

Chapter 2: Ashka of the Old Ways

Ashka was born beneath a blood moon.

Her mother called her Echochild, for she could hear the forest speak even when it had no voice. Her cradle was a nest of raven feathers. Her lullabies were sung in the Skinwalker tongue—syllables older than frost, older than fire.

She was not raised to love.

She was raised to listen.

The Skinwalkers of the Splitlands were guardians of balance. They did not interfere. They did not forgive. They walked between worlds—human and spirit, flesh and shadow. Their rituals were precise. Their laws were carved into stone and bone.

Ashka knew them all.

She knew the binding circle must never be broken.

She knew the Wendigo must never be touched.

She knew love was a flame that burned through the veil.

And yet… she saw Elias.

He stumbled into her clearing like a shadow trying to remember how to walk. His eyes flickered—human, then hollow. His voice cracked like ice. But Ashka saw something beneath the hunger. A flicker. A name.

> “You are Elias,” she said.  
> “You are not lost. Not yet.”

She painted runes on his chest—symbols of memory, resistance, and protection. She placed eagle feathers around his sleeping body. She sang to the spirits, asking for mercy.

They answered with silence.

Each night, Elias grew colder.

Each morning, Ashka grew warmer.

She taught him the old ways. He taught her how to hope.

But the forest watched.

The wind whispered warnings.

The bones beneath the cedar stump began to stir.

Chapter 3: The Tearing of the Veil

Under a split moon, Elias and Ashka performed a ritual to bind their souls and defy fate.

The forest recoiled.

The sky screamed.

From their union, something unnatural was born.

It came not with cries, but with silence. The kind that makes your bones ache.

Antlers. Feathers. Claws. A face that flickered between Elias and Ashka and something else entirely.

Skindago had arrived.

It did not cry.

It did not scream.

It watched.

Chapter 4: The Spirits React

The forest screamed.

Not with sound, but with sensation. Trees groaned. Stones pulsed. Shadows recoiled.

The spirits rose in fury—animal shapes with glowing eyes, ancestral echoes with mouths sewn shut. They tried to bind Skindago.

But it shifted faster than they could strike.

It became the storm.

It became the silence.

It became everything they feared.

And then it vanished—into the woods, into the world.

Chapter 5: Survivor Tales

Marla Vex was found near Mirror Lake, barefoot and trembling, clutching eagle feathers and muttering her own name.

She had followed a voice that sounded like her brother.

She saw her own face in the trees.

She placed a mirror on the ground.

The mimic flickered.

She survived.

Silas Wren did not.

His voice was found on a cracked cassette:

> “If you’re hearing this… I’m not me anymore.”

> “It wears your face. It wears your love. It wears your guilt.”

> “Don’t follow the voice. It already knows yours.”

Chapter 6: The Awakening of Fen

Beneath Eagle’s Perch, in a cave sealed with feathers and mirror shards, slept Fen—the last Thorneblood pup.

Born of werewolf guardians. Hidden by his mother, Lyra Thorne, who sacrificed herself to protect him.

He heard the howl.

He felt the shift.

He transformed.

Not into beast.

Not into man.

Into something Moonbound.

He howled.

The forest answered.

Skindago paused.

It felt something it hadn’t felt in centuries.

Fear.

Chapter 7: The Face in the Fog

Fen walked the Splitlands.

He met a mimic wearing his mother’s face.

It smiled. Too wide.

He placed a mirror on the ground.

It flickered.

He placed a feather beside it.

It hissed.

He pressed play on the tape.

> “I buried the mirror. I buried the feathers. I buried myself.”

The mimic vanished.

Fen stood alone.

But not afraid.

---

Chapter 8: Lyra’s Last Moon

Lyra Thorne knew her time had come.

She laid Fen in the cave.

Carved runes into stone.

Whispered the prophecy:

> “When the moon splits once more, and the beast wears the face of love,  
> The last howl shall rise from the cave,  
> And the hunger shall meet its mirror.”

She faced Skindago.

It wore her mate’s face.

She howled.

She did not survive.

But Fen slept on.

Protected by feathers, mirrors, and love carved into stone.

---

Chapter 9: When Hunger Meets Its Mirror

The moon split again.

Fen stood at the Cradle.

Skindago emerged.

It wore every face.

> “I am everything you love,” it said.  
> “I am everything you fear.”

Fen placed a mirror on the ground.

Skindago looked.

And flinched.

Its reflection did not mimic.

It revealed.

Antlers twisted like broken promises.

Feathers soaked in blood.

Eyes flickering with stolen memories.

Fen howled.

The mirror shattered.

Skindago collapsed.

It did not die.

It unbecame.

Epilogue: The Echo That Walks

The Splitlands are quiet now.

Not empty.

Just… quiet.

Fen walks the woods.

Moonbound.

Mirror-marked.

Feather-cloaked.

He howls when the moon splits.

And somewhere, deep in the trees, a traveler hears a voice.

It sounds like someone he lost.

He turns.

He sees a smile.

Too wide.

Too still.

But before he steps forward…

He hears a howl

Pure.

True.

And the mimic vanishes.
