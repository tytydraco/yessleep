Many scientists believe that we are living inside a simulated reality or that we are a universe within an infinite number of universes. This post is my testimony to these scientific theories, although I don’t have any proof, you will have to read this and decide yourself if you want to believe it or not. I am fully confident that this happened, I have a strong memory and I remember it like it was yesterday.

It was in the summer of 2022, I was homeless because I had an altercation at home and decided to leave for good. I had a job but no where to sleep. Luckily, I had my own car, but when it got too cold I had to rent a motel/hotel for the night. During this time, I won’t try to sugar coat it, but I hit an all time low, and I believe that made me able to reach a perception of reality that I can’t describe. I was in survival mode and I saw things more clearly, I saw things as they were without any bias from my beliefs or personal experiences, or from social influences. I was going through an awakening of some sort. On a side note, this is where I discovered my remote viewing abilities, which is real, look it up. Anyways, this awakening was mostly in my dreams where I had entities deliver messages to me in my sleep. Some of these messages were delivered while I was semi-conscious, ie. my eyes were open and I saw entities appear in front of me and deliver a message. So lots of strange stuff was happening at this time because once you go down the rabbit hole of this universe’s true reality, a lot of stuff will appear in front of you that you have been blind to and aren’t prepared to even process in your mind. 

Now to get to the point, one night after a long day of work, I checked into a motel 6 late at night. Side note: whenever I checked into a hotel/motel I had a 3-step routine: 1. Check in with the clerk and grab keys. 2. Find room and bring suitcase up to room. 3. Change into different set of clothes from my suitcase and shower with my own personal towel kept in said suitcase. This is what I always did each time I rented a room. We humans are creatures of habit, so that night I checked in and brought up my suitcase up to my room as usual. I was tired after a long day of work so I set my suitcase on my bed, changed into a new set of clothes, skipped the shower and passed out. Please note that although I was tired, I have clear memory that I did in fact bring my suitcase up to my room.

When I woke up early in the morning, I noticed that my suitcase was missing. I looked all over the motel room, in the closets, bathrooms, etc. I figured that someone snuck into my room somehow and stole my suitcase. While I was checking out, I noticed that my suitcase was in the backseat of my car. When I saw that suitcase, a deep sense of confusion ran down my spine. I clearly remember bringing up my suitcase and the change of clothes from last night was my evidence since I kept my clothes in my suitcase.


I sat there for over an hour trying to recall if I somehow got up in the middle of the night to put my suitcase back into my car, but I was sure I slept through the night as usual.

Anyways, this is just a weird experience of mine that I wanted to share, not any valid proof of parallel universes. If anyone experienced anything similar, please share down below.
