About a year ago I found myself without a home. A few bad financial choices here and there and you end up three months late on rent. Obviously, I didn’t plan on moving out so soon, but things happened, so I decided to take a risk and move out into the forest. When I was younger, I used to spend my weekends in the summer at my grandparents' house. They had a large property deep in the woody mountains, and I have many memories of exploring the property with my older brother and the other kids that lived in the neighborhood, overturning logs, climbing trees, making forts out of fallen branches, and following the worn paths that we had made for ourselves until we reached the end only to continue those routes even deeper into the forest.



In my search for a new place to call my home, I found a listing that was out in the middle of literally nowhere, and I mean nowhere, just to get to the place you have to take a series of very hidden turns deep in the mountainous forests of northern bc, down roads I will never remember the names of, and you find yourself in a small little town if you could even call it that, as you pass the welcome sign that says in worn out letters “MICKELLY”,  you’ll be greeted by gravel and dirt roads leading off into the forest, along these many paths lined a series of old abandoned buildings and storefronts intermixed with functional shops and small rugged houses barely held together by the boards haphazardly nailed and screwed onto them, it’s amazing that any house with such little insulation could withstand the harsh winters here, this place is covered in snow year-round, yes even in the summer, and you really gotta prepare for those winters, there’ll be weeks where you go without ever leaving the comfort of your own home and wonder if there even is an outside world anymore.



After a week I moved in and was looking for a job; the only listing I could find was for a gift shop worker at a national park I'd never heard of. I saw the ad in the surprisingly active newspaper asking for someone to work full-time running an old worn-down gift shop at the entrance of Mount… I—I can’t remember the name; it was something specific to the area. The mountain has a better-known name that I also, unfortunately, can’t remember. Not that it matters what the place is called; what's more important is the fact that I could barely make my way to the interview. There was no postage for this park, and there was no sign pointing in its direction. Heck, I even looked on Google Maps, and nothing, I had to ask a local, and the old disheveled man, named Hebert gave me a long list of complicated directions for me to get there.



“How is this place a national park? It’s like it doesn’t even exist.” Those were the only thoughts going through my head on the way there.



 

When I finally made my way to this mysterious park, I was greeted by nobody, only a single small building about fifty feet from the parking lot, that building I now know as the gift shop. In this place, I would experience things that I can never explain, and I now know it like the back of my hand. When I entered the gift shop, I was confronted by an explosion of cheap merchandise, crappy fridge magnets, postcards, and weird little tree-shaped keychains. Two rows of shelves full of these knickknacks were on either side of me as I walked in. After walking by the keepsakes, I found myself in front of an old, beaten-up till surrounded by the same junk that lined this place. The whole room had a smell; it was like a thick smog that ended up stuck in my nostrils for the rest of the day. The place reeked of expired rot, you know those old cans of food you find when clearing out your pantry, only to open it up and find it's gone completely rank? Yeah, that’s the best way I can describe it, after taking in all the eccentricities this small wooden box had to offer. I finally noticed a white letter sitting near the cash register; it was addressed to me, and upon opening, it read:



“Hello, Rob! I hope you don’t mind me calling you Rob, right? Ah, who cares?

If you’ve found your way here, you got the job. Please write down all the information requested in the included form. You’re free to look around the shop, but until I can give you your orientation, stay off the trails. I’ll call you when I can make it out and show you how this place works, but until then go no farther than the gift shop.

 Cheers 

 \- Denis Hayley”

 



After reading the letter, I pulled out the form he mentioned and filled it out. I didn’t spend too much more time in the shop, looking at the merchandise and noting where the only bathroom was; it wasn’t exactly like I wanted to take in its special scent any longer. Apparently, it had taken me so long to get to the shop that the sky began to turn that familiar shade of deep navy blue I fondly remember from those summers when I was younger. Oh, how I miss those warm nights. 



Upon getting home that night, I struggled to go to sleep; somewhere along my drive home, it had begun to rain, and pretty violently at that. I think something about the combination of the rain and having just driven out to a park in the middle of nowhere kept me up. I flinched at the sound of my old wooden walls creaking, and at some points, it even felt like I was being watched. I think that feeling lasted for a couple of hours, and at some point, I got up to check around the house to ease my nerves. 



“There’s no way someone got in; I’ll just check things and that’ll be that.” It was what I think was a pretty obvious lie I told myself to justify my anxious actions; after the day I had, I was ready to just lie down and rest, and once I knew my home was safe, I could finally get that rest I so deeply desired. I walked from the top of my stairs to the bottom. 



Now, I should probably give a brief description of the house's layout. There’s a relatively large area once you walk in the door, and because the place isn’t huge, the kitchen and the living room are the same thing. I have a small patio instead of a backyard, which overlooks the hill on which the house was built. There are two big windows overlooking the hillside and a sturdy back door with a prominent window you can see out of from the other side of the house, yes, even at night. There’s a staircase to the right of the front door leading upstairs, and at the top of the stairs in front of you is my spare bedroom, on your right, you will find the only bathroom in the whole house, and on the left down a small hallway lined with closets is my bedroom. With that done, let’s go back a bit to those stairs. I was just then walking down. 



To get a full view of the living room, you have to turn the corner at the base of the stairs, and just as I did, I saw through that fairly big back window, a man; he wasn’t bundled up; not a bit of him was dressed for the weather, yet there he was. I wanted to believe that he couldn’t see me back, but I think deep down I knew that he did, I could see his breath fog up the window, and as I motioned into the living room to get a better look, he dashed out of view, and I just barely heard the patio boards creek as he ran. Now remember how I only have a patio back there and how my house was built on a hill? I DON’T KNOW WHERE HE WENT.



I turned on my downstairs lights, grabbed my gun, and ran to the back door. I wanted to believe it was just my imagination, and maybe it was because when I opened that back door, I saw nothing, no man, and no footprints on the wet old wood boards I had sworn he ran across, no signs that ANYONE COULD HAVE POSSIBLY BEEN OUT THERE. BUT EVEN ALMOST A YEAR LATER, I KNOW WHAT I SAW. I KNOW I SAW SOMEONE, and I HATE that it wouldn’t be the last time I saw him. In the end, I remember waking up to the moist, thick, cold air of fall, on one of my two small couches in the living room, clenching my rifle; I don’t know how I got to sleep that night, but I knew that it was going to be a long year.
