A middle-aged woman's face in frame.

*Read it*, somebody says.

*My name is Angela and I'm guilty. I have helped in the destruction of the environment. Me and my generation—That should be* my generation and I, *Andy.*

*Whatever. Just read it, OK?*

*OK. Me and my generation have failed to help pass on the Earth—*

From off-screen, someone pulls a plastic bag over the woman's head. Shocked,

she struggles.

Her hands scratching, grabbing at the bag. The plastic going in-and-out, in-and-out with her increasingly heavy, slowing breath.

Until it moves no more.

(*Thud.*)

*Dude,* someone says, *you just killed your own mother.*

A man crawls along a neatly mowed lawn. Something is wrong with his legs.

He glances back,

in terror.

A shadow passes over him.

*Son…*

A sledgehammer blow—

erases his head.

A glam-filtered girl says into the camera, *Well, I'm not, like, an orphan yet, but I'm totally, like, into the idea, ya know? Because parents, they're like, fascism or something.*

Two teens take turns pissing on an unconscious woman suspended between two trees.

When she opens her eyes,

they set her on fire. *Global warming, bitch!*

**—scroll—>**

*The Earth does not have the resources to-to-to keep the rodents alive. The y-y-young are the ones working, and our p-p-parents' generation are useless pension rats.*

A man's toothless, drooling head forced against the frame of an open car door. 

*Shoulda driven electric,* a kid says.

(*Laughter, applause*)

(*Chanting: Do it. Do it. Do it…*)

The car door—

Slams—

(*Screaming*)

Slams—

(*Groan-*

*ing*)

Slams—

Until: Silence.

Dead bits of face stick to the door, ooze down the frame, accumulate on the driveway.

*—fessor of Philosophy, yes, and I don't have any children, so, no, I'm not personally afraid, and in fact I sympathize with the youth, their spirit, their will to action. You might say I'm youth-adjacent, a Millenial fellow traveller.*

A smartphone showing a photo of a man in his 30s with a little girl. They're both smiling.

The phone moves away:

revealing the same two people a decade or so later.

He's pleading, *Don't…*

as she slides a knife along his throat, releasing crimson, and as he garglegags she starts hacking at his neck.

Blood—

sprays the lens.

*Looked a lot easier on the ISIS vids*, she says.

What is Parent?

Parent is propaganda. Parent is exploitation. Parent is prison. Parent is Enemy.

Parent is Enemy.

**—scroll—>**

*—global mass hysteria, as young people all around the world are killing their parents, seemingly induced by a video on social media…*

*on social media…*

The news anchor slumps to her desk, followed by the camera tilting suddenly to the floor.

Gas obscures the image.

Teens smoking a joint, sitting on the dead bodies of two adults, as behind them a door opens—

*Thought I told you to stay*
