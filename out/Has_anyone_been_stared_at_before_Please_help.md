I’m hoping someone can help me figure out what’s happening. I (F, 24) live alone, I work from home 3 days a week, doing usual admin stuff. It was going fine until two days ago. I have a large window in my front room that looks out onto the street, it’s a quiet neighborhood so I usually sit with my blinds open. The light in my room is broken and besides, It helps to feel like I’m not alone if I can see people walking their dogs, and going about their day.   
  
Two days ago I was sitting on my couch, taking a break from work. The couch faces the window and I was scrolling on my phone when I noticed someone was staring at me. I froze, it felt like I was watching him for ages, but his expression didn't change. He didn't look put off by me noticing him. he was standing with his nose almost pressed to the window. his arms casually by his sides, just staring. His expression was neutral but his eyes were locked onto me. I looked back down at my phone, I couldn't move or look back up from it. I tried to slow my breathing as I pretended to answer a call and walk out of the room. I was terrified that my movement would make him move. I hunched down behind the wall and waited for the noise of someone trying to open the door, or knock on the window but nothing came. Eventually I got the strength to look again but he was gone. I immediately texted my friends, but they all agreed that he must’ve just been looking for someone and had the wrong house. They didn’t see the way he was looking at me though, it was a blank stare like he wasn’t really seeing me.  
  
I didn’t sleep at all that night, I was so terrified of him coming back, I had visions of him trying to break in. He didn't come back until the next day, which was yesterday. I was sitting at my desk in the same room, on a work call when I noticed him side-stepping from my front door to my window. I watched his eyes scan the room until he saw me. He had the same expressionless eyes and neutral face. I froze again, before slowly taking my laptop and walking out of the room. By the time I worked up the courage to look, he was gone. My friends don’t believe that it’s weird, they think he might need help or something but I’m terrified to approach him, or to ask him what he’s doing. A few minutes ago he stepped from my front door again and I can feel him staring at me as I type. I can't look at him, there’s something about the way he’s looking at me that's freaking me out. I’m walking out of the room now but please has anyone experienced this? Is he casing the house? What do I do?
