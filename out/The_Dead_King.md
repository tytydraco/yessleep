It’s common practice to appoint a new king when the last one dies. It’s believed to be the norm.“It’s what's natural” the wisdom of the people claimed. But that’s not what happened at the Empire of Caldoria.

The Great Emperor built Caldoria with his own hands. Born by simple means, it is believed the Emperor was raised by the streets, feeling cold and eating trash, in the now-forgotten kingdom of Eryndorn. Not much is known about this part of his life, but much is rumored.

When around 13 years old, it’s believed he killed one soldier, twice his size, for abusing and extorting underprivileged boys. At 17, it’s believed he grew up to be the leader of all underground crime that took place in the city. At 21, it is known that he brought the whole kingdom of Eryndorn to ashes.

The Great Emperor first built Caldoria with tall walls, so it could be a refuge for every person that had no place in the old world. The people came, and the realm prospered. Soon, he had to expand the perimeter of its walls. So the Emperor built Caldoria an army, and after their first battle, it was the old world who was building higher walls.

It didn’t take long for Caldoria to be pictured on every map of the world. Cartographers called it the ever-growing Kingdom, and at each iteration of their work, more ink was consumed drawing the Great Emperor’s home.

Time and time again Caldoria faced the attacks of the old world, each time emerging victorious. The one battle that the Emperor couldn’t win was the one with time itself. At the dawn of every new day, the hair on the Emperor grew whiter. His mind, once sharp as a sword, was now dulled by age, and he knew, one day he would no longer be there to lead Caldoria.

And so the Emperor had to think about the future of its people, a future he would no longer be a part of. The Emperor had no heirs, not that it would matter. “Child born in wealth had no business guiding the common folk” it’s what he used to say.

The Great Emperor could also not bring himself into naming a successor. People didn’t show their true nature until there already wasn't a need to hide them. And like the cards, sometimes the hands that look the nicest, are the ones capable of bringing the most suffering.

The only possible course of action was to postpone the time of his own departure. The Emperor brought healers from all kingdoms. Rituals were performed, all kinds of potions and recipes were taken but the King could still feel life escaping his hands. He then decided if healers could not save him, he was to find the solution to his problem by his own hands.

He led expeditions, bigger than the crusades, to find a cure for humanity's most common illness: death. He searched the old world, explored territories unseen by men, sailed to new continents based only on tavern rumors, and visited each wise man who claimed to have the answer to what he seeked. But on every one of his travels, he came back empty-handed, with only the promise to return to Caldoria with a cure.

During his last expedition, on the third night of the fall, the Emperor died, far away from Caldoria. The people, although, had great faith in the Emperor, knew this was bound to happen.

But death didn’t stop the Emperor from returning to his home. Mounted on his black horse the Emperor was seen crossing the desert, approaching Caldoria's gates. His skin was decaying and his eyes were gray, but his will was still the same. This time his expedition bore fruit.

Like with all kingdoms, all the people gathered to see their Dead King, but unlike the norm, this time there wasn’t a funeral. The King approached his throne and there his exposed bones sat.

Unburdened by mortal necessities and desires, the Emperor was free to devote all his time to Caldoria. He had no need for food, but more than ever, his people had plenty. All his attention was devoted to the wellbeing of his people.

Each citizen of the Ever Growing Kingdom had all their needs met, but as the King faced before them, death was still a part of their fate. And for the Great Emperor, this was unacceptable.

What type of Emperor sends a terminal child to face the destiny of the darkness unknown, when he himself wasn’t there to guide him on the otherside? So the Emperor took one last trip to the old world to bring back the cure he once found, willing to share it with anyone whose time in this world had passed.

But during this expedition, one thought consumed his mind. Is death a single event? Or it’s a culmination of a disease with its first symptoms shown already early in life? One could say death is present from the moment one is born.
And worse of it all, all people feared death. Thoughts of the nothingness ahead could bring even the greatest man to his knee. 

The Great Emperor first built Caldoria so the people would have a place where they could be free. Thus, the Emperor found it unacceptable that he would let his own people be enslaved by fear.

The Dead King returned to Caldoria with the cure and the knowledge of what had to be done with it. And on that night, like never before in Caldorian History, the city burned.

The people screamed, and for the first time in his life, the Emperor questioned one of his decisions. But after a while, the screaming stopped, and all that was found was peace.

The decaying bodies of the Caldorians rose from the debris, to meet their emperor in the post-life. In death, the King finally achieved his life’s work. The people of Caldoria were finally free.
