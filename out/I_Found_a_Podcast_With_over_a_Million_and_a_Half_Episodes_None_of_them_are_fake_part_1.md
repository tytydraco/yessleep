(Content warning: violence and gore)

I've listened to many podcasts in my time and I've seen an unfortunate trend that a lot of them end up following. I won't name names or point fingers and honestly if you've listened to/watched more than a few there's a good chance that you've witnessed this trend first hand and I won't have to identify any one podcast in particular.

Overtime podcasts tend to collect inside jokes. I don't think there's anything wrong with inside jokes. In fact I think having a few tumbling around and occasionally weaving their way into episodes is healthy for the longevity of a podcast. It's rewarding to long-time viewers/listeners who were there for iconic moments and so long as the rest of the humor is organic and easy to follow it will possibly even motivate new viewers to watch older episodes so that they can get in on the jokes.

But there comes a point where podcasts collect too many of these inside jokes, they become too reliant on tongue and cheek references to past events. Slowly but surely all the real chemistry that generated all those iconic moments is drained away and replaced by forced laughter from all parties as they parrot some meme that they just so happen to have printed on an overpriced T-shirt they're wearing and maybe even have framed on the wall behind them. In the worst cases the inside jokes become so dense and numerous that it almost becomes its own pseudo language that only long time loyal listeners will be able to decipher. And if hearing the same jokes repeated for hours on end doesn't entertain you then you'll probably eventually stop listening.

It's the unfortunate fate of many podcasts, strangled under the weight of their own iconic pasts. Thankfully with good podcasts it usually takes around 50-200 episodes to start reaching that stage which gives you plenty of good content to enjoy and makes starting them worthwhile. But whether or not reaching episode 987 so you can understand the inane baby babble the show and its dwindling fan base devolved into is worthwhile is up to you. And the journey through up to decades of out of date content will be lonely because the heyday of these ancient episodes were long ago and the closest thing to company there is occasional comments from months or years ago from some long time followers bemoaning the loss of the good ‘ol days. 

I've seen a lot of podcasts that go out this way, and the unfortunate part is that it often stops me from finding out what made them popular in the first place because it feels exhausting to invest my time into something that I'll have to strain my memory to understand and I know will eventually disappoint me. So when I see podcasts that have reached episodes in the range of 500-3000 I tend to just avoid them. I did that until I found one podcast that didn't have 3000, or 4000, nor even 5000 but 1,587,613 episodes each ranging from two seconds to four hundred hours long though the overwhelming majority followed a two to three hour format. I won't give the actual title of the podcast because I think this series is better off forgotten/lost and because it was just a bunch of random numbers and letters anyway, just like every single episode title. Well, all of them were like that but the last episode. The last episode was called “THE END”. According to the upload dates on every episode they had all been uploaded over the course of two minutes back in March of 2015 and as far as I can tell I'm the only person who has ever found it.

At first I was certain this was either some hacker messing around with the server or a weird bug. I tried to find any instance of this happening to anyone else but I couldn't find a single mention of a bug or hack like this in the past. Still, I'm not very computer savvy so I wasn't sure that if this was a hacker if clicking on any of the episode links could be dangerous. But I was too curious so I clicked on an episode perhaps thirty from the top anyway. I was surprised when a video began to play immediately. I assumed it must be AI generated at first but the longer I looked the more I was convinced it was real. I'm pretty good at spotting AI garbage and no matter how hard I looked I couldn't find a single sign of it anywhere. Besides, this was uploaded in 2015 when the most AI was capable of making were those weird Google dreamscape acid trip things. The idea that AI could produce realistic photage one day was around during 2015, but was relegated to science fiction nonetheless.

That being said, the dialogue threw me through a loop, as it definitely came off as AI generated. The cast consisted of three well groomed bearded young men sitting at a half crescent wooden table with expensive microphones dangling in front of their faces. I would tell you their names and perhaps describe them by their personalities if I, in the entire two and a half hours of this first episode I watched or any episode since, could derive either of those two things from the incomprehensible babble they spewed for its entire run. So instead I will be identifying these three men by the colors of their t-shirts: Red, Green and Blue. Truly the only consistent things about any of them apart from their beards, the strange thumb width scars at the center of each of their foreheads and (almost always) wearing some form of pants.

I remember one interaction fairly early on in the first episode I watched that stuck with me largely because it was the first time I experienced a taste of what would make up the bulk of any average episode. It was two minutes in and I was desperately trying to understand what they were talking about as they had begun with a cold start spouting out nonsense humor that was so esoteric they bordered on riddles when Red pointed to his smartwatch and shouted “Racoon Tuesday!” When the date on the watch clearly read that it was Thursday. The other two men burst out laughing and shouted back in perfect unison “It's Friday!” then a smiling assistant with strawberry red hair in a yellow dress and heels came pushing a cart on which sat the poorly taxidermied corpse of a three legged racoon on top of a T-shirt with the dead raccoon printed on it that was framed in garish red text that read, “It's Friday!” This was an event I would witness many, many more times with the only consistency about it was a taxidermied animal, the woman who rolled it in, the cart it rolled in on and it happening on any day but Tuesday or Friday.

Red began to speak at length about the racoon who was evidently their shared pet/mascot many, many, many episodes ago. “We wanted to thank everyone who showed up to the live stream last night and donated to save Turtle from my bitch ex-wife.” Red began as Blue began to openly weep happy tears, “This little dude means the world to us and we couldn't have saved him from the bitch dimension without your guys’ support.” At this point Red got too choked up to speak anymore and Green stepped in to start chanting “It's Friday!” Red and Blue soon joined in, chanting through their tears as they held hands.

Stuff like this happened without pause for every second of every episode. They always seemed to reference some vast and loyal audience that made some ridiculous project come to life or showed some massive amount of support that I was never a direct witness to. Every episode sat at zero views before I watched them and no matter where I searched on the Internet nobody was talking about it. Every single line seemed to be in reference to something hilarious that happened decades ago and has since been wrapped up in layers of dozens of other inside jokes. Every single little inside joke would trigger another even more obscure joke and no matter how far I went back in the episodes I could never find the origin point of any of them. Maybe I could have gone far back enough but unlike any other place on that website there was no way to go back to page one to see the beginning. I could search episodes but all the titles were just random letters and numbers so what was I supposed to search? The only way I could go deeper into the story was to scroll through a few pages at a time which I did for many hours over many days.

I even managed to go far back enough to find out where Turtle the racoon came from only to find out they named her after a fucking tortoise they ironically named Turtle who was also taxidermied. That tortoise died of old age and they claimed they got it as an egg they hatched under a heat lamp. I would never have found the episode Turtle the tortoise hatched in if Green didn't specifically mention the random series of numbers and letters that was the title of the episode like it just rolled off his tongue. I went back tens of thousands of pages to the episode in question when I searched it and wouldn't you know it they hatch a baby tortoise live on stream. A baby tortoise that they then named after a different taxidermied tortoise who also died of old age.

I also noticed as I went back that there was an increasingly gruesome looking scar on Green’s neck that got worse and worse as peeled back through what appeared to be decades of healing. As the episodes went along and the scar became more gruesome to behold I in turn became more afraid to learn what happened that caused it in the first place.

There were a lot, a lot, a lot of taxidermied animals named Turtle in that office and I never saw one that was an actual turtle. And no matter how far back I went, none of the clips ever explained why they kept adopting random baby animals, naming them Turtle, taking surprisingly excellent care of them, then horribly taxidermying them when they died naturally of old age. Neither did I learn why Red's seemingly evil ex-wife was so hell bent on stealing as many of them as she could through the court system and spontaneous acts of burglary.

After a while I kind of gave up on trying to find the origin of jokes and bits. The closest I ever got was finding the point when two previously irrelevant memes collided with one another to create something newish. But even then the jokes comprising it were themselves composite creations made of other yet more archaic references to hitherto unknown bits. So I began to watch how certain jokes progressed instead of seeking their origins.

There were some common themes like the taxidermied pets, Red’s horrible ex-wife, the seemingly endless number of code phrases that would activate a Dr. Doombot dance party which sometimes went off several times an episode and there always seemed to be an intern just off screen dressed up like a robot ready to dance, a generalized obsession with jokes and memes about The Bee Movie, and Blue weeping either out of joy or agony. But a few of them stood out to me as they seemed to consume entire episodes with their presence.

I remember clicking on a completely random episode and it was just Red and Blue standing next to their chairs at the table. Green was way in the back of the studio outside the light facing the camera but covering his eyes. At first I thought he was weeping but I saw the upward curve of the edges of his grin poking out either side of the palms covering his face. He wasn't crying, he was desperately holding back laughter and refusing to watch the spectacle in front of him to not lose control.

At the table, in the light, Red was shaking a pair of dice in his cupped hand and Blue was staring at them with wide and watery eyes. Blue looked terrified, and elated all at once. He didn't just want Red to toss those dice, he needed him to. Finally, Red rolled the two very regular looking six sided dice. I saw Green flinch and squeeze his palms against his shut eyes even harder while convulsing and I could tell he was laughing even though there was no microphone close enough to pick up the noise.  

Blue stared at the dice as they clacked and rolled over the table with a look like he was absolutely shocked that Red had actually rolled them. When they came to a standstill Red and Blue stared at the dice which read six and two. “Eight!” Red said with a devilish grin. Blue clutched his stomach like an alien was trying to claw out of it and doubled over gasping for breath. At first I thought he had been punched in the gut by some invisible force but then he finally managed to catch his breath and he began loudly cackling and screaming “Eight!” Over and over again like it was the most incredible punchline to the greatest joke ever told. Green fell over and flopped on the floor in spasms resembling a seizure before stumbling to his feet and sprinting from the room and vanishing without a trace for the next two hundred episodes.

It goes on like this for the entire episode and the two hundred episodes after. Red rolls the dice, Blue loses his mind with laughter while Red looks on satisfied with another bit well executed before rolling again. Not only did the dice rolling never stop being funny to Blue but it seemed to inexplicably become even more funny to him over time. There were times in later episodes as they devolved into Red just rolling dice for their duration where I was genuinely worried that Blue would die from the intensity of his laughter. He would laugh so hard that he would stop breathing for up to half a minute at a time and it could take half an hour for him to calm down enough for Red to roll again if he was even merciful enough to let Blue catch his breath.

Then, after 198 episodes, hundreds of hours of little to zero actual dialogue, almost nothing but dice rolling and manic laughter it happened: the dice rolled two ones. I hadn't realized up until that moment that the dice had never come up snake eyes. Statistically it made no sense, after so many rolls it seemed impossible that there was any combination of numbers that hadn't been seen three dozen times already and yet I could not recall a single time two ones showed up. Admittedly I was watching the videos at 2.5× speed and I was skipping large sections as I focused on just finding interesting parts, but even so I had seen those dice roll thousands of times. Were the dice loaded? I've heard of dice loaded to land on certain numbers but I hadn't heard of a pair loaded to avoid certain numbers. It made no sense. 

From the reaction of Red he was just as shocked as I was at the very least and in Blue's eyes I could see his entire world, his entire framework of reality breaking apart. Red, after taking in the shock of what he had just witnessed, folded his arms and cocked a sideways grin as he looked down at his magnum opus then said, “Two.” A stream of urine ran down Blue’s left pant leg, his eyes drifted independent of one another in opposite directions as they leaked a river of tears, then he fell on his back like an unsupported two by four being pushed by a gentle wind as Red stood grinning with pride like a well supported two by four and the episode ended.

The next episode began with a cold start, no introductions or title screen, as usual. Red was still standing at the table but Blue was sitting again for the first time in a very long time, pants notably clean. Both of them still wore their respective red and blue t-shirts but now they each had two dice with the one facing up printed on them with the word “TWO” written above it in flaming letters. Red looked like he was on top of the world, he was proud and full of pride with his chest puffed out and shoulders high as he shook a pair of dice, getting ready to roll again. Blue on the other hand was slack jawed and slumped in his chair, his eyes had yet to return to their normal position and hadn't ceased weeping. He looked like an idol of despair carved out of a once living man, his chest rising and falling in a rasping mockery of human breath.

Red finally rolled the dice and as they flew in spite of Blue appearing to have sunken to the very pits of hell within himself I swear I could see him sink ever so slightly deeper when the dice loosed from his old friend’s hand. The dice clacked against the table and Blue flinched as though someone much larger had just raised their fist in sadistic glee towards him, he squeezed his eyes shut. The dice landed on both ones. Red pumped his fists into the air like an Olympian accepting his first gold medal and began to shout “TWO!” over and over again. Slowly, agonizingly, Blue forced his eyes open and cocked his head to the left so his lazy eye could directly view the dice before him. He pulled in a long and strained gasp as his back arched against his chair and his head whipped back on his now painfully angled neck so that he was gazing wide eyed and open mawed at the ceiling letting out a silent scream. Then he slammed his head forward as hard as he could into the table and knocked himself unconscious. Red did not pause his celebrations as he ran victory laps around the table and his unconscious friend. Then, after a solid fifteen seconds of me wondering if Blue had managed to somehow kill himself, Blue finally regained consciousness and Red immediately stopped running, picked up his dice and started shaking them again as his friend returned to his drooling, crumpled, slump shouldered, vacant self.

This repeated for the entire episode which mercifully only lasted forty-five minutes. Blue slammed his head just as hard into the table every time Red rolled his dice and while he didn't bleed that much his face was still visibly more mutilated with every slam. Red celebrated with just as much gusto with every roll and every roll was coming up snake eyes. No matter how many times he accomplished the same feat with the clearly loaded dice and no matter how much despair and pain Blue was in, Red only ever cared about doing his new favorite bit again, and again and again.

Then after forty-four minutes the dice rolled wrong. They rolled a one and a two. Red prematurely began to celebrate but then did a double take and lowered his pumping fists as he realized what he was looking at. He began to shiver and I could see his face begin to turn bright red and beads of sweat formed on his brow, his fists clenched so tightly at his sides that his knuckles turned white. Blue’s eyes began to shake in their sockets then slowly returned to their normal position and the flood of tears ceased as he looked with both eyes at the two little white cubes in front of him. For thirty uncomfortable seconds the two shared a look of shocked disbelief at the dice. Then a wide, gap toothed grin began to split across Blue’s face and he began laughing a deep belly laugh while pointing at the dice. Red’s look of shock morphed into one of rageful hatred as his focus snapped from the dice to the heartily laughing, swollen faced man before him. Then, in the last dozen or so frames of the video, Red launched himself across the table at Blue with his arms outstretched and grasping hands flying towards Blue’s throat. The episode ended on a frame that appeared to precede the very moment Red’s hands got a grip on Blue’s neck.

I quickly went onto the next episode to see what happened, wondering if Blue would still be there. I let out a sigh of relief when I saw his blue shirt as soon as the episode began but as I took in the state of his face my sense of relief was cut short. He truly looked like he should be dead. His face was swollen into a caricature of what it once was. Every inch was black, blue, and red. His eyes were swollen shut and leaked what looked like pink pus. His nose bridge was flattened against his face. His lips were so swollen and split in so many places he could barely speak and when he did I could see he was missing most of his front teeth. And his throat was a map of Red’s strangling palms printed over his clearly broken trachea. In spite of all that, he carried on as if nothing was wrong.

Oh, also this was the episode Green returned. He was completely fine and was back to his normal happy self, having no explanation for his absence nor was he asked to give one. Red did not acknowledge what he had done, and Green did not even seem to begin to think to ask for an explanation as to why his friend looked like a walking, beaten corpse.

There were a few events like this where one or more of the cast members would lash out in bouts of deranged violence though the episodes always ended just as soon as it seemed someone would die or get grievously injured and they would all be back the next episode sporting horrific injuries while acting like nothing happened and everything was fine. 

There was one episode wherein Blue was missing for most of it as Red and Green carried on business as usual. Then at the last half minute of the video a banner unfurled from the ceiling in a rain of confetti reading in big blue bubble letters “KNIFE DAY!?!?” at which point both Red and Green began to chant “Knife Day!” While pumping their fists. Then, in the last two seconds of the video, in a blur of motion Blue came sprinting into the scene from out of nowhere clutching a kitchen knife and the video ended on a frame of a stainless steel blur racing towards Green’s throat.

The next episode all three members of the cast were sat at the table. Blue and Red looked comfortable and healthy but Green looked like his head was being held to his shoulders by the poorly wrapped gauze around his throat. Otherwise, he looked okay. Happy even. Green would not speak for many episodes after as his throat, impossibly, healed. During that time Red and Blue carried on with the regular ever rotating door of jokes with too much missing context to understand, letting the unfathomable number of bits the episodes usually consisted of come and go. 

While Green was in the midst of his very lengthy recovery he simply sat back, relaxed and watched with a pleasant grin as his friend’s continued to trigger bits from bits from bits from each other. I skipped through quite a few episodes at this point. I don't doubt I missed a lot of interesting events doing this but in my defense even if I made it my full time job to run through that entire catalog at the pace I was going through already it would take me several lifetimes to see something from every episode. 

I skipped far ahead, hundreds of episodes, maybe thousands. Green was no longer wearing his gauze but there was a ragged scar making a crooked grin out of his neck and the only noise he could make were rasping, croaking bouts of short lived laughter. I had never seen a scar like it and I doubt I will ever again because to grow a scar like that requires someone to survive something truly unsurvivable. 

The episode opened up with Red already stood up, and staring down intently at Blue who was reciting something from memory. The words were nonsense and the inflections were strange and inhuman. His teeth had grown back and his lips had scarred over at this point so at least he wasn't lisping that much anymore. It took me a moment to realize it but Blue was reciting something backwards. Curious as to what he was reciting backwards I skipped through the episode to see if at any point they mention what it is he was saying. Then near the end of the three hour long episode Blue stumbled over a single word and Red exploded with fury, slamming his fist into the table and yelled in Blue’s face, “It's ‘tub’! ‘Tub’! It's not that fucking hard, dude!”

Blue, frustrated, threw his hands up and responded, “Well if you know the script so damn well then why don't you do it?”

Red let out an exasperated sigh and raked his fingernails down his face as he trembled with rage and said in a growl, “Because she's your mom! It won't work if I call her!” as Red berated Blue Green continued to gurgle and giggle in his raspy way as he stroked his throat scar.

“Then why don't you just call your mom instead?” Blue retorted.

Red kneaded the bridge of his nose as he squeezed his eyes shut, I could tell he was barely restraining another episode of brutal violence. “Just start over.” Red said with a dismissive wave of his free hand without opening his eyes to look at Blue.

“Bu-” Blue began.

Red’s hand shot out and snatched Blue by his beard and dragged him over the table so he could press his face nose to nose with Blue and shout, “Just start over!” Again before throwing Blue back into his chair. Blue looked rattled as he rubbed his chin underneath the patch of beard Red almost ripped out. Then Blue pulled in a deep sigh and began to speak backwards again while Red looked on in contemplative silence and Green chortled.

I had been planning on ripping the audio from the episode and reversing it myself in an editing software if I couldn't find any explanations for what he was saying in that episode but after that scene I was admittedly a little too scared to find out. So instead I started skipping backwards through episodes looking for its origin, the first time I had returned to this activity in quite a while. I was hoping that if I could find the start I would find an explanation for what they were saying and why they intended to say it to Blue’s mom without reversing it. 

I believe I found the episode where it began but I found no answers in it. The episode opened with all three stars staring blankly at nothing for fifteen minutes straight. Then apropo of absolutely nothing Blue began to speak backwards, Green began to chuckle as if he immediately understood what Blue was doing, and Red stood up then crossed his arms while staring down at Blue as if he was a stern tutor ready to coach his pupil as soon as he needed to. I skipped back to the episode before hoping maybe they would discuss this project in detail there but the episode was bog standard and made no mention of some mysterious backwards script to be chanted to Blue’s mom. The episode before that and the twenty previous held no mention of this either. Stuff like this happened constantly and is why I stopped trying to find the origins of bits and eventually gave up on figuring out this one.

So instead I decided to see where it would go. The episodes were largely the same as Blue recited the script backwards, Green observed in joyous silence, and Red stood ready to give Blue hell the moment he slipped up.

Then, one episode Blue managed to finally finish reciting after three hours. Red and Green pumped their fists and cheered. Well, Red cheered, Green enthusiastically gurgled. Blue seemed to feel a wave of relief wash over him. “So can I call my mom now?” Blue asked.

“Nope!” Red announced and Green chortled in response. “You gotta do it in the right amount of time! Once you can do it in just an hour and a half perfectly, three times in a row then you can call your mom.”

Blue then began to cry for several minutes and Green ceased giggling as his throat fell apart from the inside again from laughing too hard but he continued to stare with gleaming eyes beaming with childlike glee at his distressed friend. Red stood stoic and unmoved like a stern teacher waiting for a frustrated child to work through his feelings before starting again. “Start over.” Red demanded.

Blue slumped back in his chair and looked ready to say something in response to Red other than his backwards script but Red tensed as if ready to pounce and Blue rolled his eyes before beginning his recital again. It went on like this for another one-hundred-fifty episodes. At first Blue would successfully finish the script maybe one out of six times. Then one out of three times, then half, and so on and so forth until finally, one day Blue managed to say the backwards script three times in a row within the timeframe given to him each time at the end of a grueling forty-eight hour stream, this achievement fulfilling Red’s requirements for Blue to call his mom.

For the first time I saw Blue pull out his phone. He walked up to the camera and announced, “Today we're going to be doing the ‘Talking Backwards’ prank on my mom. As you guys know my mom always has wild reactions to these crazy phone calls you guys have me do so I'm excited to see how she reacts to this one.” He then held his phone screen up to the camera and pointed directly at his mother’s entire phone number written out underneath her full legal name in his saved contacts. There were other contacts but they were all just random letters and numbers like the episode titles. “Just to prove I'm really calling her I will be pressing the call button on camera.” He then did just as he said he would before running back to the table giggling and putting the phone on speaker.

The phone didn't finish a single ring before Blue’s mom picked up and began begging her son to tell her what was happening and where he was. In spite of how soul wrenching and blood curdling this poor woman’s begging and pleading were, I found it oddly refreshing to have one singular voice in all this experience demanding and expressing some sort of normalcy and rationality. “Stop! Stop! Stop! Please, just say something normal to me! This isn't funny at all!  I just want my son back!” She begged when she caught her breath between sobs.

Blue was completely unphased by his own mother’s clear and screaming despair. He began, without skipping a beat, to recite the entire script backwards perfectly. No matter how desperately his mother wailed, no matter how deep she dug to find something of the son she knew in the man who was babbling nonsense backwards at her, he would not cease at all. All three stars were clearly holding back bouts of laughter. At one point Blue’s mother began to try and remind her son of who he really was by going over all the memories she had of him beginning with the day he was born and ending on the day she saw him off to a college on the other side of the country all those years ago. Her recounting was heavily abbreviated as she focused on reliving only the best memories and told them in between bouts of what sounded like body wracking sobs. This was so funny to Green that he had to run to the back of the studio to laugh into his palms so no one could hear his strangled laughter. Red was biting his hand to stop himself from laughing and tears were running down his face. Blue was in a similar disposition to Red in spite of his recital being flawless.

His mother, to my surprise, remained on the call for the duration. I couldn't bring myself to listen to her wailing for all of it, it was simply too heartbreaking. But I did skip through to the end when he finished the script and abruptly hung up on his mother while she was mid sentence. With her out of the way there was nothing to restrain their rockous childlike laughter. Green, who had just begun to speak in short sentences again, ruined his throat again with laughter. I could see the barely knitted strands of his vocal chords straining and snapping against the thin scar tissue on his neck until he could only silently cackle. Red and Blue shared similar reactions to one another, rolling thunderous laughter followed by breathless gasping until they finally brought in a full lungful of air and began laughing again. On and on the three bathed in the hilarity of their prank for twenty straight minutes before the episode abruptly ended just as another wave of insane laughter brought their madness to a new peak and Green vomited up chunks of his lacerated voice box.

To be continued
