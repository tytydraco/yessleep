Hey everyone, my name is Phil. I'm posting here because a lot of weird stuff gets posted in this sub and I'm hoping someone can help me figure some things out. I'll cut to the chase: my sister in law disappeared almost a month ago. It took me embarrassingly long to realize she was gone, but my wife (her sister) died a couple of months ago and everything’s been a blur. I feel bad for not checking in with my SIL more. Anyways, she didn't show up for Christmas like she was supposed to, and I called her parents and they hadn't heard anything from her either. I went to her house and it was locked, lights off, car still in the driveway. The mailbox was stuffed to overflowing. Called the police, etc. They found…well, you'll get a description of what the house was like later on, and no one was there. 

I went digging around online to see if I could find anything on her social media, and I found an account on a deactivated pet owner’s forum. There were a few posts about cat food and flea treatments and stuff from the past several years, all pretty spread out. Then there was…the weird stuff I need help with. I'm not a great writer and I don't even know how to summarize what I found so I'll just copy and paste all of her posts. I don't know if any of the past stuff she's posted is useful or not, so I'll include it all. The weird stuff starts on November 7th of this year, right after my wife died. Basically I just need help figuring out if all this is real. She’d texted me about a few weird things going on with her cats but I never really got much context. I’ve gotta admit, certain things make sense after reading the posts, but there's no way everything is true. Tried showing it to the police but they haven't gotten back to me on whether it's helpful or not. I'm going crazy here. My daughter misses her aunt. I just want to find out what really happened. Thanks in advance.

Any recommendations for a cat harness/leash? Want to get outside more with the lockdowns and I'm jealous of all the people who get to walk their dogs :)

June 30th, 2020 3:16 p.m.

Free cat harness and leash, used once, condition like new. Nothing wrong with it; I guess my cat just likes social distancing. Pickup on the west side of town.

November 12th, 2020 1:48 p.m.

Any tips for moving with a cat? He's not generally anxious, but I want to make the process as stress-free as possible. Just moving across town if that helps.

Catsitter canceled on me last minute. Looking for recommendations for boarding kennels in the area with availability over Christmas and New Year’s.

Saw a post about a month ago about flea treatments for cats but I can't find it. Does anyone remember which brand was the top recommendation?

February 12th, 2023 5:52 p.m.

Moving across town and getting rid of some old cat toys for free to declutter. Comment before the 15th if you're interested; I will donate whatever doesn't get taken to the local shelter.

January 14th, 2024 12:06 p.m.

Help! Stuck in my driveway because of the ice and only have two cans of cat food left. Anyone on the east side of town have any extra they'd be willing to share? I usually get Friskies but I'm not picky about brand!

Sister and her family found a white kitten at Brad Dawson Park. Looks to be only a few weeks old, no sign of mother. Anybody looking for him?

November 7th, 2024 3:34 p.m.

Hey, I’ve only posted here a few times, but I've got a bit of a long post. I hope that's okay! I need some advice on introducing a new kitten to a home that already has an elderly cat. My name is Angie and I live east of town at the edge of the woods. I've had my cat Edgar for seven years now, and he's adapted to change pretty well his whole life. I've moved twice while I’ve had him and both times he's had no problem settling in to new surroundings. He is an indoor cat and always well-behaved. This week I've had to bring a new kitten into my home. Pebble is about eight weeks old; my sister found him in the woods on a hike with her husband and young daughter when he must have been a newborn several weeks back. About a week and a half ago my sister passed away suddenly, and my brother-in-law realized he couldn't afford the house they were renting on a single income, especially since the lease is up next month and the rent for the place is getting higher. He is moving with my niece to a smaller apartment in Manzanita, but unfortunately they don't allow pets. I offered to take Pebble in so they can come visit him often. So far he hasn't been getting along well with Edgar. They keep hissing at each other and I'm afraid one of them is going to attack the other. Edgar can't see very well, but I know he would slaughter that poor kitten if it came down to it. Any tips on getting them to at least tolerate one another?

Sorry for the long post, just thought it would be helpful to have the context of why I had to introduce the cats so suddenly.

November 7th, 2024 9:14 p.m.

First off, thank you all for the condolences. It's been a difficult few days to say the least and this whole cat thing isn't helping, so it's nice to know this community is so supportive.

I did what a few of you suggested and observed their behaviors when they were in the same room. Edgar is always the one to initiate, and Pebble seems to only hiss in self defense. Edgar actually swiped at his face once; luckily he missed and they're now locked in separate rooms. I've done my best to keep their food, toys, and litterboxes separate, although my house is pretty small and there's not much space to keep them away from each other without being worried they’ll feel cornered. Edgar has never been violent. In fact, I put him in a kennel boarding place in Bay View a couple of years ago when I was traveling for a week and couldn't find anyone to catsit, and he did fine. (Great place if you're ever looking to board your pet, by the way!) The staff said he got along well with the other animals and was even happy playing with them for the last few days he was there. I'm worried about this sudden aggression, but he doesn't show any symptoms of rabies or anything. Should I take him to the vet?

Speaking of the vet, yes, I plan to get Pebble fixed as soon as possible, and Edgar has been fixed since before I got him. Pebble hasn't been spraying or anything, so he's not encroaching on Edgar’s territory that way. Maybe it will help to get him fixed, though. I’m going to take him in later this week.

November 8th, 2024 4:19 a.m.

I know no one will see this for a few hours, but something just happened that I have to write down. I had Pebble locked up in the bathroom with his food, water, and litterbox, and Edgar was in my room. Usually Edgar sleeps on the foot of my bed, but he wouldn't move from the doorway all night. It's like he's been keeping watch. I woke up about ten minutes ago to the sound of Pebble mewing from the bathroom, and right as I sat up, Edgar attacked me. He jumped up and scratched my face, and he was screeching this awful sound. I'm no expert on animal emotion, but he didn't sound scared to me. He sounded angry. I managed to grab him in my blanket and put him in my closet. He's still in there hissing, but he stopped clawing at the door and I don't think he's violent anymore. I went to the bathroom to check my face and see if Pebble is okay, and he was sleeping peacefully on the ground. Luckily Edgar missed my eye, but I've got a pretty nasty scratch on my cheek. I'm hoping it doesn't get infected. I don't know what to do. I have to go into work in a little over three hours and I don't know what will happen if I leave them both home alone. I'm debating calling out to take Edgar to the vet. 

November 8th, 2024 12:07 p.m.

I just now got back from the vet and had time to check the board. I ended up calling out for the day and went to urgent care to get my cheek checked out. It was swelling up pretty bad, but they said it was a normal amount for a cat scratch of that severity. So now I guess I've just got to monitor it for signs of it getting worse or infected on top of everything else. 

Once I got back, I took Edgar to the vet. It's weird, he usually isn't a huge fan of car rides but he was pretty docile in the crate on the drive over. He must have tired himself out in my closet. He was really calm at the vet’s office, too, and he even purred while I was holding the crate in the waiting room. The verdict there was that the new kitten coupled with aging symptoms must be stressing him out. (Just to clarify, he's 12; I've had him for 7 years but I got him when he was 5.) They told me to watch for signs of feline arthritis. I've always thought he's been surprisingly agile and playful for his age, and he sure didn't seem arthritic when he leaped at my face. He hasn't been struggling to get around or acting like he's in pain or anything, even in the past week. But hey, what do I know? I've only been his owner for over half of his life. 

November 8th, 2024 8:52 p.m.

My niece came over to visit Pebble this afternoon. She’s only eight and the death of her mom has taken a pretty big toll on her. It’s for her sake that I don't want to make him an outdoor cat if I can help it. That kitten is one of the last memories of her mom she has after having to move to a new town and downsize all of her stuff. She's worried that he wouldn't survive being outside for very long, and I've got to admit that she's probably right. His fur is white and it makes him an easy target for predators, and I live at the edge of the woods so there are plenty of predators to be found. Plus, my sister died chasing after this stupid cat when he escaped out their back door and tried to run away. I don't feel right trying to have him live outside.

I guess this has become less of an “advice needed” thread and more of an “I’m frustrated” thread. I've tried almost all of the tips you lovely people have suggested and none of them have made a difference. I completely understand if the moderators of this board wants me to stop posting if I'm not looking for advice; it's just nice to have a place to vent about animal problems!

November 9th, 2024 12:32 p.m.

A couple of you managed to piece together the timeline and details of my sister's death from my last few posts and have been commenting questions. Yes, she was the victim of the cougar attack that has been in the news. I suppose I'm not trying to hide anything deliberately, I've just been trying to avoid publicity in light of it being only the second recorded fatal attack by a cougar in Oregon. I'll give the details here because I know many of you are understandably curious, but I would appreciate it if everyone asked no further questions on the topic. It's obviously a painful thing for me to think about. This is your warning that the rest of this post is going to be very graphic. It’s hard for me to write, but maybe putting the experience into my own words might help me process everything.

On October 28th, Pebble escaped through the back door when my sister opened it to take out the trash. It was already dark and foggy and she just barely caught a glimpse of him disappearing into the trees. (Their house is just up the road from mine; it borders the same woods.) She yelled to her husband to tell him what happened and that she was going to go find Pebble. Half an hour later she hadn't come back, so my brother-in-law started searching for her. He found her about 200 feet from the house, her stomach ripped open and her face shredded to be almost unrecognizable. She was barely breathing, and Pebble was curled up asleep on her chest which must have made it even harder to breathe. She died in the ambulance. No one else actually saw a cougar in the area that I know of, but the autopsy found traces of fur and apparently the injuries were consistent with cougar attacks on livestock. 

I’m starting to hate this cat. First he causes my sister’s death, and now he’s disrupting the peace in my home. Edgar still gets aggressive whenever Pebble is in sight. He hasn’t attacked me again, but I feel like he could try at any second. I’ve got one more last-ditch effort I’m going to try before kicking Pebble out. One of you suggested getting them used to each others’ scents without seeing each other, so I’m going to have them switch spots from now on. Pebble will be in my bedroom while Edgar gets the bathroom. I’ll change all of their bowls and litterboxes and things, but I’ll leave the rug that Pebble sleeps on for Edgar to investigate. If this doesn’t work…I don’t know. I’m at my wit’s end. There’s only so much I can do to risk my own sanity in order to preserve my niece’s.

URGENT: emergency vets within an hour of Tillamook open after 5:00?

November 11th, 2024 11:35 p.m.

I just got back from a vet clinic in Hillsboro. Thanks everyone for the speedy recommendations; I ended up getting there just a half hour before they closed but a few of the staff agreed to stay a little late to help.

I guess I should explain what happened. When I got home from work today, the house smelled rancid. I was afraid something had died in some closet somewhere. I opened the bathroom to check on Edgar and found him heaving and crouching over the rug where Pebble had slept. There was vomit and blood all over the floor. I couldn’t get close to him at first; he had this crazed look in his eyes and I was afraid he would attack me again. That's when I made my last post asking about emergency vets. When I ran to my bedroom to grab a blanket to wrap him in, Pebble was once again sleeping peacefully through all of this. I'm not going to lie, I almost kicked him in the head but I managed to hold myself back. The sight of him laying where Edgar should be, acting so unbothered while MY cat is violently ill…I might sound crazy for this, but it seemed to me like he was almost spitefully peaceful. Like…I don't know, when my sister and I were little, whenever one of us was in trouble or upset the other one would act like a smug, perfect little angel and it always made the situation worse. That's what Pebble reminded me of. “Look at me, I'm sleeping calmly while the other one is having a crisis. Aren't I so wonderful and easy to take care of?”

Sorry. I'm frustrated. Long story short, I managed to grab Edgar and wrap him in the blanket. He still tried to fight me, but he was exhausted and didn't put up too much of an actual struggle. I got him to the clinic and they cleaned him up and checked a few things, but it looks like there's nothing physically wrong with him. I don't get it. He's vomiting blood and acting feral; surely there has to be some illness or parasite or something causing it. He was calm in the clinic again, but the vet said it sounds like he's under severe psychological distress. I cried the whole way home. I know what I said about keeping Pebble for my niece’s sake, but I can't take this anymore. When we got back, I set his food and water outside and put him out. I'm only half hoping he’ll stick around as an outdoor cat. 

November 14th, 2024 7:18 p.m.

Thank you to everyone who's been reaching out and checking up on the situation. I appreciate the sympathy you've all shown. To the one person lecturing me about “not owning animals if I'm going to act violently towards them,” I’ll just direct you to actually read the post and not just pick out words you want to get upset about. I didn't kick Pebble. I wanted to, but I restrained myself. I’ve been dealing with this nonstop for the past week along with the stress of losing my sister and I channeled my anger and frustration towards the closest thing that seemed to have any connection to my circumstances. Was it immature to have that urge? Maybe. But I didn't act on it, and that's all I will say on the matter. Do with that what you will.

On to the update. Edgar has much improved since Pebble’s left the house. He was still apprehensive for the first couple of days and tiptoed around anything with Pebble’s scent. I washed the rug, mopped the floors, threw my bedding in the laundry, threw out the second litterbox, and did everything I could to reset the house to the way Edgar is used to it being. Today he finally seems like his old self again. He's currently curled up on my lap while I type this. I wish this forum allowed pictures, he's adorable!

Pebble comes to the back door for food pretty regularly. Whenever I set out the dish, I make sure Edgar isn't in any of the windows with a view of the woods. I don't want him catching a glimpse and getting freaked out again. I did take Pebble to get fixed this afternoon. I feel bad about leaving him outside while he's recovering, but I just can't take the risk of letting him back in after making so much progress back towards normalcy. I put out a crate with some warm blankets around the corner of the house (out of sight from any windows for Edgar’s sake). Any other suggestions on how to keep him healthy while he recovers?

Oh, one more question. Despite owning a cat for several years I've never actually had to deal with a scratch. The one on my face scabbed over pretty quick and it hasn't shown any signs of infection, but this morning I woke up and it was bleeding again. I tried looking it up, but I don't have any symptoms of cat scratch fever or anything. My lymph nodes are fine and my temperature has been normal. Have any of you ever dealt with this? Any advice on helping it heal normally?

November 14th, 2024 9:20 p.m.

Okay. I see everyone urging me to keep Pebble inside while he recovers, but I just can't do that. Look back at my earlier posts for a myriad of reasons why. I'm sorry to say it, but I do have a bias towards Edgar’s wellbeing over Pebble’s and I just can't deal with the effects of him being in the house again. Any ideas specifically regarding keeping an outdoor cat outdoors but ensuring a healthy recovery?

November 15th, 2024 7:04 a.m.

After a bit more research and a couple of very helpful comments, I've put Pebble on crate rest. My niece is coming over again tomorrow and I know she'll be upset that he's outside, but hopefully it will ease her mind a bit to know that he's confined and other animals can't get to him. Honestly, it eases my mind, too. Last night there was a deer on the edge of the woods acting odd. I've never seen an animal with chronic wasting disease before, but I assume that's what was going on. I know prion diseases can get transmitted if you eat meat from an animal with CWD, but I'm not sure if just being in the same environment puts Pebble at risk. I'm glad to have him in the crate. The last thing my niece needs is to see him going crazy and dying.

Now that I think about it, there's no way something like CWD could have gotten to Edgar and then been missed at the vet, right? What if Pebble picked it up when he got out last month and then transmitted it without displaying any symptoms? But that wouldn't explain why Edgar is acting fine now. And they would have been able to detect a disease like that at least one of the times I took him to the vet. Right?

November 18th, 2024 2:08 p.m.

As expected, niece was upset about me keeping Pebble outside. I explained as nicely as I could that he was causing a lot of stress for Edgar and he acts happy to be outside, and that seemed to satisfy her for now. 

On that note, a few of you have commented on the fact that I seem so confident that Pebble’s presence is what's causing Edgar to act so strange and get sick. I've looked over all the evidence in my past posts and texts to my brother-in-law, and it all points to Pebble. Maybe there's a tiny sliver of a chance that Edgar was just sick for a few days and it coincidentally got worse whenever Pebble was close by. If it was just a few hairballs or acting a bit off, I’d be willing to try acclimating them to one another again. But a forum post can't begin to describe the sight and smell of my bathroom floor covered in blood and vomit and my cat’s fur matted with it as if he'd been living in filth for weeks. Seriously, if I hadn't been able to show the emergency vet the email with visit notes detailing Edgar’s clean bill of health from another clinic three days earlier, they might have reported me for animal abuse. It was that bad. Respectfully, you haven't lived my situation, so please refrain from telling me I'm jumping to conclusions for no reason.

Sorry. I'm a bit pent up. Not that it's relevant to a pet owner board, but I got sent home from work early today because I yelled at my boss and kicked over a trash can when he confronted me about it. I really don't know what came over me. It’s just so much to deal with. My sister’s death, whatever was going on with Edgar, diseased animals on my property (oh yeah, the other day a bird flew into my window repeatedly until it died), waking up every morning and the scratch on my face is bleeding again which means I have to wash my pillowcase every single day, having to worry about Pebble recovering from surgery even though I wish he would just run off into the woods and live somewhere far away from me…it's so much. Oh right, and I haven't had a chance to clip Edgar’s claws. He can sense when I'm stressed and gets squirrely if I try to pick him up. I haven't had the energy to hold him still long enough for me to trim those tiny knives on his feet. 

If you're still reading…why? Go do something else that’s not super depressing. But also thank you. The few people who have been commenting consistently over this whole thing…you have no idea how much that means to me. Maybe someday we can meet in person and get coffee or something. But not today. I need to take a nap.

Anyone have any experience with a male cat getting fixed and becoming \*more\* aggressive?

November 22nd, 2024 5:58 p.m.

Clarification on my last post: not aggressive towards me, but picking fights with larger animals.

November 22nd, 2024 6:01 p.m.

Two raccoons and a seagull. Sometime in the last 48 hours.

Also, maybe not the place to ask this, but what is the proper procedure in Tillamook County for safely disposing of wild animal carcasses?

November 26th, 2024 11:09 a.m.

Sorry for not updating. I've been so tired. Haven't gotten much sleep the last week because of the awful noises outside. Tried calling animal control, not much help. Apparently since I haven't actually seen the fights happening I can't prove it was the cat’s fault. He hasn't acted aggressive at all when he comes to get food. Even when I keep an eye on him he just watches squirrels and birds calmly. But I know it's him. This didn't start happening until I let him off of crate rest to wander freely. Animal control said to call again sometime after Thanksgiving if it's still happening and they'll try to send someone out to investigate.

Edgar's getting restless. Keeps growling at the windows and avoiding me.

Haven't officially lost my job, but was put on leave for “aggressive tendencies.” Whatever that means.

November 27th, 2024

Scratch still isn't healing. Any recommendations for cat scratch ointments or something? It's too big for a bandage.

Pebble came right up to the window today and Edgar lost it. Eyes wide, ears back, hissing, yowling, clawing at the wall, the whole deal. Dumb kitten just sat there cleaning his paws and looking through the window every now and then. 

Awful scratches on the windowsill. Edgar’s claws are way too sharp but there's no way I can trim them now that he's this worked up. I'll have to start closing all the blinds so he can't see outside. Still, I feel like he can sense when Pebble is outside without seeing him. I think I can, too.

I really need a nap.

December 1st, 2024 3:32 a.m.

Thanks once again for the concerned comments. Yes, Edgar is dead. Came home from Thanksgiving at my parents’ late on Thursday night to find more blood, vomit, and feces all over the house. Edgar was lying next to a window. Blinds clawed halfway off the wall. Twitching, heaving, barely alive. He had clumps of his own fur matted in blood stuck in his claws. Such sharp claws. Should have trimmed them long ago. Several open wounds. I would assume self inflicted. Saw me, tried to jump at me and attack again. Fell to the ground and stopped moving. He was so still and he

December 1st, 2024 3:58 a.m.

Sorry. Couldn't finish the post. Going to my brother’s, will update when I'm back. If I come back.

December 3rd, 4:50 p.m.

Condolences appreciated. I got back this morning and tried to clean up the house, but I just couldn't do it. As disgusting as it is…the body and everything he left behind is all I have left. It's sick. But I can't imagine my house without a trace of him. It's like the blood on the carpet is proof that there was something there to bleed. 

I haven't slept. Tried to take a nap on the couch, but I woke up vomiting. Probably the smell. I didn't look too closely at it but I think there was blood. My cheek scratch is open again, much worse than any other time. I think it's infected. There was dried blood and puss under my fingernails when I woke up. I've seen too much blood recently. I think I scratched it open in my sleep. Maybe I've been doing that for weeks. 

I think I understand what Edgar was feeling. In his last moments and all those awful moments leading up to it. I think maybe I understand what that bird was feeling. I think I've understood it for longer than I want to admit.

I'm going out into the woods. I'm going to kill that smug little demon. Forget the ER. They'll admit me to a psych ward or something. But I know what it is. I know it's that cat. It killed my sister, it killed my Edgar, and it'll kill me if I don't get out there and kill it first. I won't be posting here again, no matter the outcome of my mission. I'm done with this town. I'm done with everything that ties me to what's happened here. Phil, if you ever come across this account, I'm sorry. It's not your fault. You couldn't have known. Tell Ivy I'm dead when you think she's ready to hear it. It probably won't be a lie. If it's not, it’ll be kinder than the truth. Don't tell her how it happened, though. At least not for several years. I can't imagine the pain of a child knowing her mom and her aunt both died because of something she loved.

If I am alive, you'll never know it. I'll change my name or something. I don't know. I'll figure that all out later. I have more important things to worry about. Don't try to find me. It'll hurt more when you fail.

To the people who've been commenting on my posts for the past month…this is all a joke. I made up a creepy story to cope with my sister’s death. It’s easier this way. Laugh about it and move on with your lives. Thank you for reading my story. It really does mean the most.
