I tried to run away, of course. I assumed if I wasn't there to hear it, I wouldn't have to do it. My two friends, Jay and Amir, were excited to as well, we talked of having adventures like all the kids in the books we read.

My sister told me I had to play a game of Magic the Gathering with her every night at 6, and then I was stuck forever. I kept up appearances with my friends, acted like we'd all be running away, thought maybe I'd even get to skip some school before I had to go back home.

But when it happened, during recess, having slipped into the woods while the teacher wasn't looking, I felt it in my gut, in my pain, in my bones. I had accidentally done exactly what I was supposed to. If I returned what my friends had taken from my master, no one would ever know.

Orders from them weren't like orders from my sister, I didn't have to do it no matter what I thought, I wanted to do it. It almost felt like hunger, but I've mostly forgotten what that felt like. It was something that would satisfy me, maybe closer to solving a Rubik's cube. I could tell I was only a few turns away from solving it, I wanted to so bad. My master's emotions filled my soul, pushed all other thoughts away.

I fell behind them as they trudged through the fallen leaves, talking of magical destinies. My magical destiny was getting closer. The sun filtered through the trees, casting us in dim light. The farther we got from the school, the more it fit into place. Amir looked back, asked if I was okay, if I wanted to go back. I shook my head and smiled.

I look back on this memory a lot, try to transplant melancholic and loving thoughts into my head. Imagine a version of me that understood the gravity of what was happening. I just felt good.

As soon as we could no longer see the school, I took off my beanie, and started to peel my skin down, even the pain felt good. My friends didn't notice for a few moments, until Jay glanced back at me. My skin was down to my shoulders, my bones were unfolding and reaching out of me, grabbing onto trees, taking over the peeling. They screamed and ran, smart enough to try to circle back towards the school, with a headstart too as I finished correcting my skin. But I moved so quickly through the trees, propelling myself between them with my bones. I caught Jay first, screaming at the sight of my body, upside down and inside out. I stuffed him into the earth, he slipped so easily between the grass, didn't leave a trace. Amir wasn't too far away, he begged for me to remember that we were friends, then vanished into the ground. My master would come for what was theirs, my friends flesh and blood fed the grass and trees.

I walked on two feet back out of the forest, told the teacher we had all planned to run away, but I chickened out, that I was already heading back when I heard their screaming. There was a search party looking through those woods for weeks, they never found anything. The local news spoke sadly of them for months, nobody ever suspected a 9 year old girl killed them.

My parents asked why I had wanted to run away; I just told them I wanted to go on an adventure like Percy Jackson. My sister knew what really happened, she called me cool. I felt proud.

That story, I think, actually happened after the next ritual I have to tell you about. This one's more of a game, even more of a game. I was 9, my sister had told me we were having a sleepover in her room that night. Our parents were home, they thought it was sweet we spent so much time together.

Before they maybe saw 1 in every 20 hits or threats. They'd scold her, of course, but then she'd just do it again. Now, there was nothing to see. I don't really blame them, but I never really loved them. They were nothing to me.

Her room was on the second floor, the only room on the second floor. The roof made her ceiling slant down in multiple places. A messy bed she never slept on sat under a slant. I sat on the couch bed she did sleep on while she paced, always pacing. The rest of the room was filled with junk, the steps to the attic blocked by it, her dresser she never used covered in it. The table for magic and D&D the only thing ever clean. Her closet was filled with it too. It was an unusual closet, two doorways leading into it, the ceiling's slant causing one door to be smaller. We used to play games in there, glow in the dark stars spotted the slanted closet ceiling.

I hated sleepovers, she'd always make us stay up until at least 2, sometimes the whole night. That night, she snuck back downstairs and stole a bottle of our parents' wine. She wouldn't let me have any, said I wasn't an adult, she was 14. After a few sips and telling me about the boy on her bus that she liked, or one of her wet dreams, I can't remember which, she started telling me about a game from that site.

She called it the real 7 minutes in heaven, that it would transport you and another person to a higher plane of existence, a paradise. I could tell she was scared to try something else from that site after last time, but this one seemed so safe from her description.

My sister asked me if I wanted to try it with her. It was a question, I could've said yes or no, but I knew what happened when I said no to my sister, and besides, who wouldn't want to go to paradise. I said yes.

First, you have to be wearing makeup, it doesn't matter what as long as you think you look good. For the first time, my sister shared hers with me. I put on light purple lipstick and mascara. I didn't want foundation or anything on my face, because I liked the way my freckles and bright red cheeks looked. My sister said I looked ugly, so I let her put whatever she wanted on me. My sister looked so beautiful, bright red lipstick, contour and blush just right, lash extensions, our mother's small black dress, she almost looked like an adult.

We pulled enough clothes and old toys out of her closet that we could stand in it. Then she wrote in blood above the big doorway 'stairs'. I remember smiling about how unscary it was. The radio was turned on, a big silver boombox, it doesn't matter what channel. My sister and I held hands in front of her closet, we said together, loudly, looking at the ceiling above the door, "hey, let us in, password's albatross, we brought meat," then we let go of each other and stepped into the closet.

So, the game part of it is, once you're there you have 7 minutes until you're automatically kicked back out, every second in there is supposedly intense pleasure, but some beings in there can see you, and you don't want to be caught by them. My sister didn't explain that last part to me.

I think I saw it for a second, or maybe I only felt it: paradise. The sun setting over a beach, an ancient city among the clouds, a crowded party in an apartment, but then it collapsed into me. 1000s of places, filled with 1000s of people or creatures doing and feeling countless things all in my body, in my bones. If you want an explanation, the paradise is a place for souls, it doesn't have any physical space, so when something physical enters it, it's more like it enters you. Obviously, I didn't know that then, all I knew was what it felt like, a cacophony of pleasure, so many different ways of feeling happy, so many different activities causing feelings I think were supposed to feel good. I didn't understand most of it, my pain felt so small then, but the feeling that overwhelmed it made me feel uncomfortable. I wanted it to stop, tried to focus on the people talking to their friends, and not the things that clearly weren't people and whatever they were doing, but their feelings were so much stronger.

I didn't notice where I actually was, where my body was, for a while. The closet was empty of my sister's clothes and junk now, the old glow in dark stars the only thing from our world that remained. I could see the old dark blue paint that covered every surface. I could see the path to the left, where the ceiling slanted down, leading to the other smaller doorway back to her room, but when I turned back to look through the big doorway there was only another closet where her room used to be. We were stuck in her small closet, two of them, but still so small. I felt trapped, tried to retreat back to the endless space inside of me, but that feeling wasn't any better. I didn't know what else to do, I focused on the pain inside me, my destroyed organs, broken bones, at least I understood that feeling.

My sister called out to me, her smile was wider than I'd ever seen, looked wrong. I didn't want to look at it.

"Do you feel that? A god is giving birth."

I didn't want to think about that, but my sister put her hand on my shoulder. The space between our bodies ceased to exist. They were the same body then, both of us at once. When I looked down, I couldn't comprehend it, I think I saw myself. Our minds shared the same space too. I think we were supposed to both be thinking at the same time, to have equal control over our body, but I had to do everything she said, I had to think everything she thought. I didn't exist anymore.

The setting sun hurts Slloh's eyes. They stare to distract from the other feeling, a piece of themselves has come alive, a piece of their happiness, overflowing from themself. The tearing is unlike anything else, as a part of who they are gets away from them. My sister likes the feeling. Slloh stares harder at the sun.

The moment leaves her mind only a moment after our bodies collapse. She marvels at the way I move, how it feels to be small again. She didn't hesitate to explore every corner of my thoughts and memories. It didn't surprise her to know I feared her; she was my big sister. It didn't surprise her to know I loved her; she was my big sister. There weren't any juicy secrets for her to find, but she stayed for a bit in the memory of my destruction and rebirth, finding some pleasure in experiencing it for herself.

We're seen, she couldn't tell who, from where, or how she knew they had, no one in paradise had seen us. It took her too long to realize we were looking right at it, through the doorway, in the other closet a naked white woman stood in front of us. She was older than us but looked young. Her long black hair fell carelessly over her face, her blue eyes flat, expression gone.

My sister knew this would happen, the site said there would be guardians, bouncers, that they could sense us by our pleasure, which meant there was no choice but to run. It had said if they caught you, you wouldn't die, you'd still leave after 7 minutes, but you'd never be the same. She was curious what that meant, but that feeling was quickly lost in the cacophony, replaced by a quiet, rising fear.

The bouncer started sliding towards us, not moving a muscle. It almost looked like levitation, but then we saw she wasn't moving, she was elongating. Her body stretched towards us, between where her front moved and where her back still was, was just smooth flesh and dangling hair.

My sister ran down the closet, used my smaller size to only have to duck below the slant and through the doorway. The other closet slanted up to the right. It wasn't a circle; it was a zig zag. We would've been screwed otherwise. She ran towards the other end of the closet, glanced back quickly before stepping through. The bouncer's head and torso were stretching through the doorway.

She kept running and ducking and glancing. The bouncer was faster than us, halfway down the closet by the time we went through the doorway then. We weren't running out of breath for some reason, she could run forever, but that wouldn't work. She needed to think of something. That uncertainty, a less singular focus, let the cacophony crash back in. Someone was feeling a joy she had always wondered about.

Grace was killing someone, Cesar, but she didn't know his name, she just knew how to tear his soul apart, and wanted to. Cesar tried to get away, to dodge past her, but she just tore another piece off and he fell. She felt in her hands as someone became no one, it was like an intense, beautiful energy filled her. 1000s among the clouds watched, amused, curious, like my sister. She had fantasized about it quite a few times, even planned out a few ways to kill me. It'd be so much easier now, but she didn't want to anger Bone God.

There was another bouncer in front of us, identical to the other, standing at the tall end of the closet, the other surely close behind. The site had said there were multiple, she hated herself for not considering that, for getting distracted. There was nothing she could do, except maybe what Cesar did, dodge past the one in front of us before she became never-ending.

My sister waited a second, for the new bouncer to start stretching towards us, then moved up against the wall to its right. She never touched the wall, she was sure she moved all the way up to it, but it was still an inch away. The hallway was wider now.

My sister ran as fast as she could towards the wall in between the doorways. She never touched it, it moved away as fast as she ran. She realized, of course we weren't actually still in her closet, we must not have any other way of understanding this space, there were no walls or doors. The bouncers were far behind us.

Another could appear in front of us. Would it just slip through the wall, the one chasing us crawled through the small doorway though. Did they have to follow the rules as long as we did, or maybe they weren't and that's why they were faster, but we couldn't understand them moving through walls, so we saw it like that. That meant that one could appear right in front of us, but it'd look like she came through one of the doorways, almost certainly too quickly to react to.

My sister started moving through two doorways every so often, hoping to avoid anything being able to come at us from straight on. She had figured it out, which meant she didn't need to think about it. She felt the cacophony drowning her out but didn't want to fight it. What was the point of being here if she didn't enjoy herself?

I don't really want to talk about what scene she focused on. I'm sure you can imagine plenty of things that would be horrible for a 9 year old to feel like she was experiencing. She stayed in it for a while.

The bouncer had stretched almost in front of us as soon as she came through the door. My sister stumbled back, fell onto the floor. She was so close, but she didn't touch us. Two more were right behind us, blocking the long path back to the other wall. She crawled towards the smaller doorway. Hair moved out of it towards us, her head blocking the last wall we could've escaped through.

We were surrounded, she was panicking. She didn't want whatever they would do to us, something like what happened to me. She felt bad in that moment, there was an urge to protect me too. I think about that moment a lot.

The bouncers weren't getting any closer, because my sister was drowning in pure fear. They can only sense our pleasure. She just needed to stare at the sun, so she looked into my body, focused on all the pain of every single part of me dying constantly.

They didn't get any closer, until they were gone, and we were standing in her closet staring at old clothes. My thoughts didn't come back at first, I just stood there waiting for her to think. Her memories had all stayed in my head, but there weren't many and I was in most. So they felt like things I had learned about her, instead of a new part of myself. I couldn't get myself to think like her.

Sometimes, in the years after, I would think a thought that felt like hers. I felt proud of them for a bit. Then they'd make me angry and annoyed. Now they feel almost nostalgic.

I was sick to my memory of a stomach, uncomfortable in my bones, I didn't want to exist. I didn't want my thoughts. I tried to push them out of mind. I stepped out of the closet.

"That was amazing" my sister touched my shoulder again, and I flinched away. She looked annoyed. "Why are you scared, I just saved you?"

I apologized and thanked her. Her smile returned. "That feeling, I can't even imagine it anymore. How could something that amazing be possible?" Her mouth widened into that wrong smile.

"Wanna go back?"

I didn't. Every feeling I didn't want to be having came rushing back up, I thought I would actually vomit. But it was a question, I could say no.

She didn't wait for my response. "We should go back."

No longer a question, my body moved whether I wanted it to or not. I tried to resign myself to it, but the feeling wouldn't go away. I felt like I was peeling my skin off and climbing away through the trees, but I was turning on the radio and rewriting the blood.

We stepped through the door again, and paradise again tried to drown my thoughts. I stepped away from my sister, but she wasn't trying to touch me. If I focused on the pain as hard as I could, it wouldn't be so bad.

I watched my sister's wrong smile for a bit, filling myself with another kind of pain. Then the guardian appeared, it didn't see me, only her. I called out to warn her. My sister turned her smile to me and walked over. I readied myself for her to touch me, but she just looked at the guardian with me.

"You know, I'm really curious what they do when they catch someone, aren't you? It's gotta be something really fucked up."

I wasn't curious, I didn't understand that curiosity of hers. She wanted to destroy and be destroyed, without doing either. This place was perfect for her.

"Go get caught."

I knew she was going to say it. My legs walked me towards the woman stretching towards me. I tried as hard as I could to make myself nothing again, but there was no one to hide behind. I stopped just before her, crying silently. I tried not to scream as she finally stretched into me, but I failed.

We collapsed into each other. The guardian was Eudice's corpse. She died 100s of years ago, she lived for 100s of years before that. Eudice was a powerful witch, made deals with beings like Our Internal Perfectionist for immense power and long life. She did whatever she wanted, whatever she felt would make her happiest, shaped everyone she came across how she liked, influenced society so she'd have power. Having power felt good, but she didn’t really care about using it, she just wanted to have fun. So she dedicated the rest of her life to getting enough power that she could create her own heaven, a place of eternal happiness for herself and whatever lucky souls found their way there. The spell she cast ended with her killing herself to create this paradise, her soul is ruling over it to this day. Her body laid nowhere, still connected to her soul, every thought of hers still being traced into it, but without any way to be a part of anything. So the body reached out, tried to escape, created the ritual for people to get in so this exact thing would happen. Our bodies collapsed into each other, the thoughts and memories traced into it, traced into me, almost 1000 years, a cacophony of memories to drown out mine. The body couldn't really think for itself though, so its plan doesn't work at all, it stays in that place forever, only another copy of Eudice gets to leave.

We both stood there in agony, terrified, because neither of us were leaving this place. I had gotten my wish to be hidden, but I didn’t want to stop existing forever. I remember thrashing and screaming as loud as I could, trying to remain in focus, but Sage's and the body's pain were so unpleasant, why would anyone focus on that?

I thought about all the things I could do out in the physical world again, a world where you control everything is only fun for so long. I liked the idea of climbing to the top again, fighting the other Eudices trying to do the same.

I said goodbye to my little world, looking over the simple or brutal pleasures. I almost didn't want to go, but I could always visit.

I was standing in a closet with my new sister. "So what happened, you were just standing there?"

I looked through Sage's memories of her and didn't really want to spend any more time with her. I looked further to find the easiest way to kill her and remembered everything that happened with Our Internal Perfectionist.

My soul was a different shape, I knew no magic I could do like this. I was in service to one of the more primal beings, couldn't seek help from others, I was theirs. And I was this teenage girl's too, I couldn't harm her in any way. There was nothing I could do. I was as trapped as before, in no control whatsoever. I could only wait for my two masters to tell me what to do.

I started to panic but looked to Sage's memories for how she lived with this, how she coped. Eudice's memories were worthless to me, she was a fantasy, I was Sage.

"I have the memories of an ancient witch now." I had to tell her the truth.

"So, do you know, like, a lot of rituals and spells now, anything that could help me?"

Eudice's confidence faded away, my dread and discomfort were creeping back. "Yeah."

She almost wanted to get caught herself, but I told her it only didn't kill me because of what happened with my master, which was the truth. We went to sleep then, on her couch bed. She cuddled up to me from behind, discomfort filling my body again. I didn't know how long she stayed awake, but I couldn't fall asleep for what felt like an hour. I was so scared that she'd whisper into my ear at any moment "wanna go back?"

She did make me go back a few more times after that. I tried to get Eudice to drown me out when I did, but it didn't work. Eventually she stopped bringing me and went with whatever boy she was fucking. I was relieved, and worried for them.

If you want to try this ritual, I'd recommend you do it with someone you love, or at least trust, and that you both know exactly what's going to happen. You should probably only do this if you're an adult, but I think that should be obviously true of all of these.
