I don’t know if I’ll have time to finish this.

If someone finds my phone, the password is 2746. You can take everything, just… please, post this somewhere. Anywhere. They can’t do this to anyone else.

His name is Renan. When I moved in, he was just a quiet guy with a black backpack and hollow eyes. Never smiled. Never left his room after 2 a.m.

I thought he was just an introvert.

But last night, while he was in the shower, I heard something coming from his room. Not music. Not a conversation. It was… a prayer. Repeated, almost sobbing, in a language that shouldn’t exist. I recorded a bit of it. I’m too scared to listen again.

There are symbols scratched beneath his bed. I found my name in one of them, written in blood. I didn’t know how to react — I freaked out and tried to ignore Renan.

Earlier tonight, the doorknob turned slowly. No knocking. No calling my name. Just turning, like he was checking if I was still awake.

I ran and locked the door. Pushed the dresser against it.

The sound stopped.

But now there are footsteps in the hallway. He’s pacing back and forth. Sometimes he stops right in front of the door. Just stands there, silent. Then goes back to the kitchen.

Except…

I heard two voices.

One was his.

The other one… I don’t know. It couldn’t be the TV — it’s impossible. There’s someone else here.

Maybe more than one. I didn’t hear the front door open, let alone close. Someone got in, and I don’t know how.

Renan isn't alone. I don’t know what they’re planning. I don’t know if they’re planning something for me. I never should’ve found out.

I live on the third floor. No one gets in through the window.

But maybe I’ll have to go out that way.

I just called the police. The operator told me to stay calm. Said they’re sending a patrol. But I know this neighborhood. It’ll take time. Maybe too much time.

I tried texting my sister. Just a simple “something’s wrong,” but the message wouldn’t send.

Then, my screen froze.

Not cracked. Not glitched.

Just... stuck. Like something didn’t want me to speak out.

When it finally cleared, all my past messages with her were gone.

Like I never had a conversation with her in the first place.

I told myself it was panic. That I was imagining things.

But then the lights flickered.

Not like a power surge.

Every bulb dimmed at once — slow, deliberate — like the entire apartment was holding its breath.

The window’s too high to just jump. I don’t know if I’ll make it.

So I’m leaving this here.

They’re trying to break in — pounding, like they’re ready to tear the door off its hinges.

If I disappear… I want someone to find this. I want someone to understand what’s going on. What they’re doing. I can’t be the only one.

One more time: his name is Renan. We live at 1342 Hollow Creek Drive — Building 3, Apt 204, in Portland, Oregon. He’s white, 5'10”, blonde hair, and eyes that never seem to blink. He might look harmless… but he’s not. Please, find them.

The dresser won’t hold much longer.
