 I can’t remember what age but when I was young my family moved to a small city, and because I still live there to this day I will not be sharing the name. But I will be sharing my story and how I grew up. 

⚠️Blood warning⚠️

Our city had one rule, and one rule only. On the last night of every month we are to be asleep before 6pm. We were never told why but our neighbors told my parents it’s best to just sleep all together in a big closet. At first my parents laughed it off until one day, my cousin had decided to come stay with us for a week. One night, the night of the last day of the month, She slept in my room which had a big window. We had so much fun we didn’t end up laying down until 8pm. That’s when we heard it. “Tap tap tap” three very long taps on my window. We stayed quiet but looked at each other, that’s when we heard it again. “Tap tap tap” this time more impatient. And the knocks just kept going. I eventually went to sleep. But my cousin, I don’t know why but got up to see what the taps were. I don’t know what happened but that morning when i woke up, I remember feeling so cold. Waking up I saw that my window had been shattered and blood was everywhere. I didn’t see it at the time as I was scared out of my mind, but a note was left in what seemed to be my cousin’s handwriting but in what looked, and smelt like blood. But when My town heard about it. They told us that that was the warning. And the cops can’t do anything about it. So eventually we started sleeping in our closets on the last day of the month.

I am now 27 and I still do this. I have two dogs and a cat. Well it was like any other night of the last month. I got my pillows, blankets, water, and pets. Well my cat is only a month old. She’s never done this before, and it didn’t help my mom got her a toy that makes tapping sounds too, and she loves that toy. So when we heard the tapping she ran out. To the window. Now the door was only a peek open, but i know what i saw. Something broke my window, and all I saw was a claw grabbing my cat. It’s head peeking inside. It didn’t see me thankfully.
But I still think to this night, if i had gotten my cat back in the closet before it saw her. She might still be here, or we’d both be gone. 

I now train my dogs to automatically go into the closet. I think it didn’t see me, I don’t know for sure. If it might come back for me. It haunts me. It seems strange now. But growing up, it wasn’t.
