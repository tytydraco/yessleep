I'm writing this from my dorm room in college, on the 5th floor of my building. I live on campus at a small college in Arizona.

At the start of the semester, it's HOT here. Like 105 degrees type of hot. The type of weather you keep your AC on at full blast, with as much water as possible. During these first like eight weeks of the semester, I was trying to keep my room as cool as possible for obvious reasons. But every morning, when I woke up, I found my mirror unlocked and slid open. The first couple times it happened, I figured it was a fluke and I just...forgot to close it. But that didn't sit right with me. What reason would I have to open the window in this heat, even at night-time? The more confusing part was that my window locks from the inside.

As I grew more paranoid, I spent a couple weeks trying to "catch someone in the act," by staying awake as long as I could, pulling all-nighters, just chugging energy drinks. With these measures in place, the frequency of times I found my window ajar decreased. I was exhausted, sleep deprived, and wary of my surroundings, but at least I was sure there were no intruders or whatnot in my room. Not that there could be. I always made sure to lock my door when I was in my room, and had even began to barricade it out of fear someone was sneaking in.

Fast forward to yesterday evening. Obviously Halloween weekend is coming up, so I wanted to get ahead on my homework before I spend the rest of my free time with my friends, going to parties or binging horror movies. I was writing a paper well into the evening, pulling a really late night working on my homework. I had all my protective measures in place. My window was locked, blinds were closed, and my door was locked and barricaded with my dresser.

All this and I still must've passed out at some point. I jolted awake, and looked at the clock. It was 4:16 AM. The barricade was still in place, and my window was still locked. All good, all clear. I looked back at my desk and saw a Post-It note stuck to the wall in front of me. I didn't remember placing it there.

In my handwriting, it read:

*You have to escape.*

I stood up, looking around frantically at my room. Escape from what? Was there something in my room all this time? What was going on?

"Who's there?!" I shouted, frantically peeking into every crevice of my room. I heard something clatter at my desk, and I turned around slowly.

My body, still asleep at the desk in the same position, had let go of a pen, and a new post-it note was on the wall.

*You have to escape. It's coming for you. It's not a dream.*

As I processed what I was looking at, something began to thump against my door, like someone trying to get in. Thumping and scratching. Almost like a bear, or something, clawing at the door. The barricade rattled, and my dresser tipped over, slamming against the floor.

Now silence. The lock slowly turned on my door, and I frantically looked for any place of escape.

The window. Frantically, hands trembling, I clawed the locks of my window open and leaned out the edge. As my door was flung open, I made the choice to leap out.

I heard my voice shout "Wait! Don't jump! They were lying!" As I plummeted towards the pavement of my dorm's courtyard.

*They?* I thought before I hit the ground.

This morning, I jolted awake, soaked in sweat. But I was in my room. Everything was in order. My dresser hadn't fallen, and there were no post-it notes on the walls. But my window was open.

So I'm writing this looking for answers. I'm scared to go to sleep tonight. Am I even awake right now? Please help me.
