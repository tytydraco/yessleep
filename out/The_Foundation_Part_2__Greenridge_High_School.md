Healing has been extremely rough. I was hoping for some special healing or something, but I wasn’t so lucky. Not completely anyway, but I did have to wait for a few days to be able to move around without crying. 

Kelsey and I have been getting along well enough, though it has been awkward. She basically had to nurse me back to health. It was weird because I had never had anyone do that for me before, and she was more than happy to answer my questions about the town. She isn’t hearing the calling anymore, but we think that town and the monster inside are still there. 

Finally, I decided to call my mom using a burner phone Kelsey got me. She didn’t recognize my voice and couldn’t recall who I was, even after I explained it to her. Whatever, she left me long before I left her. 

\-

The phone finally started ringing, and  I could hear it from my office, which surprised me because it was down on what Kelsey and I are calling the first floor. Kelsey is extremely interested in the building, and she feels more comfortable navigating it than I do. She told me that she would sketch maps and help get things organized. 

I made my way downstairs as fast as I could, but my leg made things difficult. The building changed again, too; the hallways became a little more organized. We also have chairs and tables; the biggest area is starting to look like a lobby of sorts. 

As soon as I got to the phone booth, the same wave of tension and fear washed over me again. I limped to the booth and opened the door. As I took the phone into my hand, I took a deep breath and leaned against the glass. 

\-

“Hello?” I mumbled as I licked my lips. 

“Sky. You did well. We know you retrieved Kelsey. The building will be in good hands under her. You both have special skills, but you must keep her out of the field.” The man on the other end of the phone says. 

“Okay.” I agreed, but I didn’t really agree, or rather, I didn’t fully understand. As we sat there in silence, it became clear that they weren’t going to explain anything to me. 

“Caleb is next. You’ll need him to help clean up the various areas where other people like you have been killed. You need to be careful, Sky. There are not many Marked people left. As for further staff, we are working on it.” The man said before I heard the phone get passed to someone else. 

“Sky.” A woman said. Her tone made my blood run cold. There was something different about her. 

“Yes? I’m here.” I whispered as I nearly put my head down. 

“Sky, you have an additional task. Caleb will be found at Greenridge High School. It is an extremely dangerous site that is overflowing with paranormal energy and so much more. His skill allows him to pull people back from a state of death. You mustn't allow him to do this. No more people are to be rescued from the high school or otherwise. Do you understand?” The woman said without taking so much as a single breath. 

“I understand.” I paused, remembering something important. 

“Is it possible that I can get a weapon?” I asked softly and slowly, knowing that I wasn’t supposed to be asking questions. 

“If your Marked Ability has been triggered, you will find a weapon in either your car or office.” The woman said before hanging up. 

\-

I told Kelsey where I was going and who I had to find, and went out to my car. The more I stayed up and moved, the more the pain faded away in my back and chest. Though my leg was still throbbing from time to time.

As I got into my car, I groaned and reclined the seat before noticing a briefcase in the passenger seat. I quickly reached over and popped open the briefcase. Sitting inside was a thick blue belt, a large flashlight, a set of keys, a badge, and a wallet. No weapon, but I suppose the flashlight would work in a pinch. The badge didn’t have a logo or anything on it aside from an image of me and my first and last name. Interestingly enough, the badge also contained a job title, “Secretary to the Director.” I scoffed and tucked the ID into the new wallet. A black credit card with no logo and $400 was waiting for me. I put the blue belt on and clipped the keys to it before starting the car and making my way to Greenridge. 

I set the GPS and started to drive, taking a moment to watch the technology. It was unlike any other GPS I had ever used and had a ton of input options. I could look for cities, towns, people, animals, but not items. Greenridge pulled up four different results. Greenridge (Town), Greenridge Private Academy, Greenridge (High School), Greenridge (REDACTED). I clicked the high school button, but made a note about the rest. 

\-

**The Curious Case of Greenridge** 

As soon as I approached Greenridge, I could tell something was off. I figured it was because I smacked my head, but the area around the town had a faint glow to it, purple. I’ll have to get more specific with the colors and remember what I’m seeing. 

I slowed the car down as I drove down the road and locked my doors. The houses looked as normal as you’d expect; if anything, they were each gorgeous to look at in their own way. Everyone had perfectly cut lawns, and if they didn’t have a lawn, the pavement was well-kept. No chipped paint, no dirty windows, and no dirty cars. People walked down the sidewalk or drove past me, but I didn’t notice anyone leaving the bounds of the town. 

It took me a minute to notice how perfect the roads were. There wasn’t a single pothole or pebble out of place. The more I looked around, the more I noticed other signs of perfection. The street lights were perfectly spaced apart, and each one looked brand new. The sidewalks looked fresh, and there was no graffiti. What stood out to me the most was the style of the town and the stores that I drove past. Everything had color, everything popped. The more I looked at the signs, the harder it became to continue driving, as if my brain was being actively pulled like a rubber band. I was able to fight the feeling for a little while before giving in and pulling over. I was drawn to a large, DONUT sign featuring a cartoon donut with large eyes and big white gloves. He had large yellow shoes with sprinkles on them. 

Charlie’s Donut Shop & Dougies Coffee Place sat next to each other, a shared pink building decorated with sprinkle decals. The windows were brought blue, and the sidewalk leading to the building was decorated with a frosting walkway. It was one of the most inviting buildings I had ever seen, and I couldn’t help but want to check it out. 

As I walked into the building, light music hit me like a soft wave. I slid my hair back and walked around slowly, trying to take in all of the atmosphere. The tables were shaped like large donuts, each with different frosting on top. The chairs were large coffee cups with cartoon characters on the label. The floor had smaller donuts and other breakfast decals on it, while the walls were decorated with various donut and coffee characters.

I walked over to the pink counter and smiled at the man behind it as I eyed the donut prices behind him. Everything was $1, so I wanted to order a dozen. 

“Hi! What can I get for you today, sweetheart?” The man said as he moved back a little to showcase the donut selection. 

Being called sweetheart made my skin crawl. His voice was a little too high-pitched to make me comfortable. As I blinked, I could see the light purple hue around the donuts. 

“Um.” I paused as my head throbbed. 

*Don’t eat anything until it’s been tested.* I heard in the back of my mind, it was not my voice nor the voice that my conscious normally presents itself as, weird, I know. 

“I’ll take 12 donuts of different flavors. I am feeling adventurous, so please surprise me. I would also like one cup of coffee.” I smiled at the man before shifting on my feet. 

He grabbed a bag to put the donuts in without taking his eyes off me. He bent his arm back a little and slowly took one donut off the back rack at a time. He never broke eye contact and never blinked. He put the bag on the counter and moved to get the coffee, finally breaking eye contact. 

“Are you from here?” He asked me in a low tone, completely different from when he called me sweetheart before. He sounded almost like a different person. 

“I am visiting my boyfriend,” I answered as he placed the coffee down, and I handed him $13. 

“Enjoy your time.” He said plainly as I took my goodies and quickly jogged back to my car. I put the items into the passenger seat and cupholder before starting the car and continuing to head to the high school. 

Something was definitely wrong here. 

\-

Once the high school came into view, I was shocked for two reasons. First, the place was gorgeous and looked like it had the backing of some extremely wealthy people. Second, I wasn’t expecting the place to be open. I could see kids leaving to catch their buses and decided to hang back. As far as I could tell from where I was, they looked completely normal. 

It took till around 5:30 PM for the place to clear out, and that’s when I spotted the car. A white buggy with a man sitting in the driver's seat. As soon as he started getting out of his car, I followed suit. I guess it was pretty obvious, but then again, I am not used to doing this. 

“Why are you watching me?” He shouted from across the parking lot. 

“Are you Caleb?” I called back as I tucked my hands into my pockets, trying to seem as calm as I possibly could. 

I watched him look both ways before jogging over to me. As soon as he got closer, he put his hand under his jacket, and I threw my hands up. 

“I am not here to-” I stopped talking the moment his gun was flashed to me. 

Caleb wasn’t anything like I was expecting him to be. He was a touch bigger and more rough looking. His facial hair was well-managed, and his wavy brown hair was combed back in such a way that he looked really official. 

“Who are you and what are you doing here?” Caleb asked me as he walked just a little closer to me before pausing. 

“I came looking for a man named Caleb. I was told that he would be here. I have no idea why the people who called need you, but I really need you to come back with me. Otherwise, I could die or something; they weren't specific.” I said as honestly as possible, I could feel my hands start shaking as I spoke. 

I watched him put the gun away with a sigh. 

“You must be like me if you can even exist here in a normal capacity.” He said as he put his gun away and walked closer. I motioned for him to follow me to my car, and he got in the passenger seat after moving my donuts. 

“I hope you’re not eating the food here,” Caleb said with grave seriousness. 

“Nope. I bought it to bring it back to uh the Foundation for lack of a better name.” I said as I proceeded to explain everything I could. I told him everything I could. I told him about Simon, the phone, Kelsey, and the monster. Eventually, I even slipped up and told him about my father before leaning on my car door and apologizing for oversharing. 

In return, Caleb told me everything he knew about this place.

“When I came back here, I left a lot behind, like a lot. Important people that I had grown to really care about, but I knew I had to come back. It was as if my body was begging for it, as if I didn’t come, I would go crazy. So my group and I had to split up, and those people were mostly like me or like us. Special.” Caleb paused as he slid a cigarette out of his jacket and lit it. 

“The first time I came back, everything was as I left it when I was younger. When we left, after we thought that we had destroyed the high school, the town was still normal. But when I came back, the town was as you saw it driving in. The stores were full of brands I had never heard of, and the high school was back and better than ever. My house was gone and replaced by what I have taken to calling Imposter Humans.” Caleb said as he inhaled before blowing smoke out of the passenger side window. 

“Okay, so what the hell happened?” I asked him as I reclined my seat back and watched the sun set behind the high school before it abruptly paused in the air, sending chills down my spine. 

“That’s what I am investigating. As far as I can tell, we are not the only people here who are not impostors. This school, though, is drawing the erm special kids. I had rescued a few before, but I think these are different. I’m sorry, I don’t have the words to describe what I mean.” Caleb apologized as he took another drag of his cigarette. 

“I was told not to let you rescue anyone else,” I told Caleb as I turned to face him. 

“I need answers, and if I can save even one person, I will. If you want to bail now, you can.” Caleb said. 

\-

“Can you tell me about the high school?” I asked as I got more comfortable. I wasn’t leaving without Caleb. 

“The groundskeeper told me that sets of 4 kids were killed here originally. 5 kids were supposed to die in each set. Each time a murder happened, the next one was guaranteed to be more gruesome. He told me that people were divided over the murders, but I never found a single newspaper about the incident. No murderer was ever caught after 13 murders.” Caleb shook his head and proceeded to tell me about the killer teachers found inside the building. 

"The strange thing is, he told me that the last two that were supposed to be killed were two girls. I met a woman named Cassandra who was looking for her sister, Hannah. Her brother had died, and on my way back, I thought about the murders. I think more people died here than I was told about, and I think the history is twisted.” Caleb said seriously. 

As I listened to him speak, I felt a sharp pain slide down the back of my head. It was as if a row of pins and needles consumed my brain. I turned my head to the school as my head throbbed and I balled my hands into fists. 

I had to be here. 

\-

Caleb and I waited for a while before deciding that we would go to the school together in the morning, and for now, we would move our cars closer to the trees. We decided to camp for the night, not knowing just how horrifying this experience would really be. 

\-

“Sky, get ready,” Caleb said as I opened my eyes. I pinched my nose and put my hair in a bun, tucked my shirt in, and tried to make myself look as presentable as possible. 

As we walked into the school, my headache got worse. At its peak, it felt like my brain was going to explode, but the feeling went away as soon as we walked through the front door. 

We were greeted by large groups of people and a large gecko decal on the floor. We could hear the band playing in the auditorium just to our left. Caleb looked at the area longingly. As the teenagers walked by us, they seemed to ignore us completely. No one turned to look at us, but strangely, they did walk around us. 

They were all dressed like they fell out of an old school movie. I tried to listen to some conversations, but it seemed like they were speaking complete gibberish, at least to me. Though Caleb did pull out a notepad to write down what we were hearing. 

\-

“Mine as well make her drink toilet water. Dirty Heretic. God Weeps.” 

“Molten Rocks Set Us Free.” 

“Bet She Tastes Like Liquid Gold. Clean. Diamonds.” 

“Cats do not football. East. East. North. West.” 

\-

I made a face, I couldn’t help it. Something about the words was unnerving, and I was eager for Caleb to lead the way. 

“We should go classroom to classroom,” Caleb suggested, and I could only nod. He seemed like he knew what he was doing. 

Following Caleb felt right, like filling in the piece of a puzzle in a way. 

\-

We walked into the auditorium to see what was going on, and we made sure to stay in the back. The song was horrible, like what someone might think good music sounds like. The wind instruments sounded like they were dying. 

The teenagers playing had elongated fingers that seemed to have bones in weird places. It made me cringe. I watched as they attempted to play their instruments before slowly backing out of the room with Caleb. 

\-

We checked out the gym next, and I was not prepared for what we found. Boys with elongated legs played basketball with what I can best describe as a bloody meatball. As it bounced off the floor, it left bloody circles on the ground. They spoke the same nonsense as the others, but their voices were much deeper. We exited quickly and continued to walk around. 

Eventually, we found ourselves in a classroom labeled “Astronomy-1.” 

“Something feels off about this one,” I whispered to Caleb as my headache came back, though much lighter. 

“We will be quick,” Caleb mumbled as he slowly opened the door. 

I nearly had a heart attack. 

They were looking at us; some had eyes that were too large, while others had eyes that were too small. Some had longer fingers, while others had fingers that were far too short. I watched as one of the boys, if you could call it that, smiled at me. It was a crude smile, teeth on top of teeth, and a brown tongue greeted me. It made me want to puke. 

“Can I help you?” The teacher said as she put down her instruments and turned to us. She was tall and lacked knees. Her shape was something like what you might find in a child's drawing. She was so misshapen that I briefly wondered how she was speaking. 

I took one last glance around the room before getting ready to speak, and that is when I saw the girl in the corner. I watched her write in a notebook; I could see the tears running down her face. She was shaking. 

She had to be human. 

“We are here to pick up our daughter for a dentist appointment.” I spat out without much of a second thought as I motioned to the girl. The other students all quickly turned to look at her. 

The teacher smiled a little and got a little closer to me before saying, “Astrid, your mother is here to pick you up.” 

The girl looked up at me. We couldn’t be that far apart in age, but I was hoping the Imposter Humans wouldn’t notice. I was trying to get her to go along with it, and luckily, she did. She got up and moved to us like her shoes were on fire. She didn’t even bother to bring her notebook, just her backpack. 

“Have a good day.” The teacher hung onto her last word a little too long for my liking as she watched us exit the doorway. 

\-

“Are you okay?” I asked Astrid the moment the door closed. It was a stupid question. She looked like he had been crying for hours. 

“No,” Astrid said as she rubbed her eyes, and Caleb motioned for us to hurry up and follow him. 

“We can’t leave yet. My sister is still here.” Astrid informed us as we rushed to the front door. This time, the other students were looking at us; they didn’t take their eyes off us. They just stood there, unblinking. 

The feeling of unease that had been slowly growing in my stomach was getting too intense to ignore. 

“Where is she?” Caleb asked in a hushed tone. 

“The library,” Astrid said as Caleb motioned for her to lead the way. 

\-

I had been on edge this whole time, and I thought that I was better at hiding it. Maybe I was getting used to all of this? But then the intercom kicked on, and I knew that I wasn’t getting used to anything. 

“Astrid. I know that you are with people who are not supposed to be here. Come to the main office right now, or there will be severe consequences.” A man said. His voice made me pause, but only for a moment. 

Caleb continued pushing forward as the man continued to speak. 

“Astrid. Do you remember what happened to your mother when she tried this? Do you remember what she smelled like?” He pushed. 

“Ignore it,” Caleb said, but it was hard to ignore. The look on Astrid's face made me want to cry for her. 

\-

As soon as we reached the library, a putrid odor hit my nose, making me gag. Astrid did the same, and I could hear Caleb grunting. We quickly made our way around the bookshelves until we could hear crying. 

We took a sharp left, and my body froze. I was too scared to move. Too in shock to pull out my flashlight. We were standing before a man in a black suit, his body had been completely torn open, entrails strewn across the brown carpet. Half of his skull was missing, his fingers looked like they had been chewed off. 

A girl sat next to the man, her hand intertwined with her long blonde hair. 

“Stella,” Astrid whispered as she went over to force her sister to stand up. 

\-

“Holy…” Caleb trailed off as he examined the books. 

“Look at this.” He said as he tapped me. It was clear that he was trying his best to keep his eyes off the body. 

As I faced the bookshelf, I paused and had to do a double-take; there were hundreds of yearbooks. Greenridge High School 2000, 2045, 1834, 1995, 532, 3000, and so forth. 

“That can’t be right. I went to this school, and it was never like this.” Caleb mumbled as my eyes landed on a book with a blue spine. I slid it off the shelf and read the cover, “Greenridge High School 2000: Origin.” 

I turned to Astrid and asked her to open her backpack so I could put the book inside. She did without any hesitation. 

\-

“Who is that?” I asked Stella as I glanced down at the body. 

“He said he was here to help,” Stella whispered as her lip quivered and she turned away from the body. “The Librarian took care of him.” She continued as I bent over to check the body. It took everything I had not to throw up. He was still warm. 

I used my foot to move his jacket; he was lying on a red folder, so I carefully took the folder out from under his body. 

“Greenridge” was printed on the cover. I slid it into Astrid’s backpack before pausing. Something was breathing around us. It was loud, heavy, but also sounded wet. Like someone had phlegm caught in their chest. 

I quickly looked around before getting a sinking feeling in my stomach. I grabbed Caleb’s arm as I slowly glanced up. Staring down at us was a grossly disfigured woman. Her hair sat on one side of her skull; it looked almost like melting ice cream. Her eyes had completely sunk in on themselves, and her nose looked like it had been peeled off with a potato peeler. She only had one ear, and her fingers were long enough to reach over the top of the shelf. 

I screamed, I stood there screaming as she opened her mouth to reveal rows of human and what could be animal teeth. She moved so quickly that the bookshelf she was balancing on started to give way. If Caleb didn’t force us to move, we would’ve been crushed. 

We ran down the hall so quickly that the pain in my leg started coming back. Though it was duller than before, it still hurt like hell. It didn’t matter, though. I had to keep moving. 

“There's an exit! But I could never open the door!” Stella called to us as we ran past more books. 

My heart was going a million miles per second, or at least it felt like it. 

\-

The Librarian gained on us quickly. Caleb and Stella led the charge, but I could feel myself getting slower. I could see tears gathering in my eyes as Astrid passed me, and before I knew it, I felt something grab my good leg. 

I cried out as I fell forward, slamming my nose on the floor. I could hear it break; it's a sound I’ll never forget. I broke out in screams as the creature dragged me backward. I moved my arms as fast as possible to try to grab the carpet. One of my fingernails was pushed back into my skin while another was broken, and I could feel my hands bleeding. 

I was flipped over onto my back to meet the creature's distorted face. She let out an awful hiss, something between that of a growl and the hiss of a snake. I felt its hand tighten around my legs as I struggled to break free. 

My mind was a buzz, my heart felt like it was hitting my chest like a rock hitting a window. Tears poured down my face as I spat blood out; I felt it land near my eyes. It pulled me a little closer before pops rang out from behind me. The creature let go as a hand dragged me backward. 

“Come on! My bullets won’t kill it!” Caleb screamed as I turned my head to see Astrid dragging me back. 

I was forced to my feet as we charged across the library and right out the back door. I was moving so fast that the world around us became a blur. Caleb took us to my car and had me hand over the keys. As we drove away from the high school, I watched the area around us. People who were walking on the sidewalk or driving past us looked right at us. We were being watched intently. Stores we drove by flipped their signs from open to closed. I told Caleb to use the GPS, enter Home in, and take us there. 

At the time, I forgot that I was told not to let him use his abilities. 

\-

As soon as we got back, I raced inside. I wanted to be alone, and I figured that Kelsey would show them around. I was still shaking and crying; it felt like I couldn’t breathe. I made my way to my office and shut the door to try and decompress. 

Once I was able to breathe again, I did what I could to clean the blood from my face. I’d have to buy new clothes because this shirt was trashed. I exhaled before I noticed the sound of a phone ringing. 

As I exited my office, I noticed that there were more office doors, way more. At least 7 new ones. I didn’t bother to see what Kelsey had done to her office; I limped down to the phone as fast as possible. 

\-

“Sky.” A man said to me as soon as I picked up the phone. 

“Yes?” I coughed before cleaning some blood from my lip. 

“Did you retrieve Caleb?” The man asked. 

“Yes,” I answered, thinking that it was weird that they even had to ask. They just knew Kelsey was here when I brought her back a few days ago. 

“Good. Your services are no longer needed. You will be terminated by the end of the week.” The man said before hanging up the phone. 

A feeling of looming dread pushed into me as I put the phone up and pushed my body into the glass. It felt like I was about to be hunted, like eyes were on me that I couldn’t see. This wave of fear was different; it was primal. 

I stood there in contemplation for a moment before the phone rang again. I reached over to grab it, cleaning the fresh tears from my cheeks slowly. 

\-

“Hello?” I coughed as I tried to steady my hand. 

“Skyler, I am with the Board. You need not be in distress. You need only to find the Director. Instructions have been left at your desk as well as some fresh clothing for your journey.” A man said before the line went dead. 

\-

I clenched the phone and screamed as hard as my body would [allow](https://www.reddit.com/r/SpectralsMegaverse/).
