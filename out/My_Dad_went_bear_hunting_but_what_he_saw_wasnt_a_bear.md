This story takes place in the autumn of 1977 at a camp that belonged to a friend of my father named David. Dad worked with David at one of the automobile factories owned by General Motors in Michigan. David had a camp in a swampy area in the U.P. (Upper Peninsula of Michigan) and had agreed to let my dad bear hunt out of it. Dad wasn't alone in this bear hunting trip, his fellow companions were; his wife Samantha, little sister Whitney and her husband Clive, and his hunting buddy Randy. There are many stories I could tell you about, but I will refrain. Both he and Randy brought their bear hounds with them, as that is how they hunted the renowned Michigan Black Bear. The hounds pick up a scent and run the bear until it "trees" and then the hunters move in to the tree for the kill. My father has been very successful hunting this black marauder of the U.P.; he has bear skins and mounts to prove it. This story is transcribed from my dad telling it, so it's written as if he's actively telling the story in real time. The actual text of this story was typed down by my half brother from a video I took of my dad telling this story. He then had it printed into a little book that he gave to my dad for his birthday. I then used google lens to copy paste the text since I didn't have a digital copy. I will be altering names and locations. I have also done editing to the format and added details that I remember from my dad's retellings that weren't in the video/transcript. 

Here we go! Hope you enjoy it!

“It was in September, bear season opened September 10th, and we were up for a two week hunt. We had gone out bear hunting that morning and we run a bear but we didn't get it. So, we went back to the camp, there was me, Clive, Whitney, and Samantha. Me, and Randy, and Clive were sitting there and we got up and started a fire, it was about 4:00 or 5:00 in the evening. We just sat around chit chattin'; the girls were in the cabin making dinner from a raccoon Randy had shot the day before. We fed our hounds and just before the girls called us in, it was getting a little dusky, everyone of my dogs, I had five dogs tied up around the edge of the swamp and Randy had four dogs in a dog pen. All at once my five dogs jumped up and went right to the end of their chain. And started barkin' and growlin', and snarlin' and lookin down in that swamp. We were lookin' down there and couldn't see anything and all at once, I'm tellin' ya, every dog but one went back to the tree I had them tied to and laid down except one. They were all shakin' and shiverin' except for one dog, that little Shotgun. She was my little bluetick hound, she finally laid down but she didn't act so scared as the others. Every one of Randy's dogs ran right in their dog house, they were in a pen. It was weird, I mean a really weird ordeal, I couldn't figure it out, if it had been a bear they wouldn't have acted like that, they would have wanted to chase'm. 

We went in and had dinner. Then we went back out that night and talked about the events of the day around a fire. The girls made dessert and called us in, so we went in and played cards. We played Euchre, that's what we play in Michigan. It was real warm in September and it was a real hot day, and after we got done playin' cards, we all got ready for bed. It was about eleven o'clock. We left the back door open because it was so hot. We never thought about latchin' the screen door, it was a screen door with a hook on it. So we went to bed and at about one o'clock in the morning, I heard that screen door open. I heard it open and thump shut. and I heard something stirrin' in the kitchen and the way the cabin was situated, it was just two rooms. It had a big room and the dining room, living room and kitchen was all one room, it had a big picture window and it had a table in front of the picture window. And there was no electricity so it had a gas lantern or gas lights hangin from the ceiling, it had nine foot ceilings. And it hung down about a foot or so. About one o'clock in the morning there was a full moon and that cabin was really lit up, and it was facin' east and the full moon was shinin' real bright into the kitchen. There was a full size bunk bed and Randy was in the top bunk and Samantha and I were in the bottom. You could see almost like daylight in the kitchen. 

All at once I could hear somethin' movin' around and then it walked right in front of that table and turned just like it knew right where we were. It turned right around and looked, it was standin' right under the light and it was humped over so it wouldn't hit its head on the light. I remember his arms hangin down; they seemed like they were way past his knees because he was leanin' down bent over. And he was just standin' there starin' at us and he would look over at Whitney and Clive, they were in a day bed, and we were in the bunk bed. He'd look over at them and look over at us, he looked right at me and then I raised up on one elbow and was watchin' him and I thought at first it was a bear, you know? Then I realized, it couldn't be because its ears, I could see them real plain, were on the side of its head like a human, not on the top like a bear. And he just stood there starin' and then he'd look up and then look down at me and then back at Whitney and Clive. They had a window right beside their bed and light was comin' in there. He just stood there starin' at us and I said, "oh Lord." I didn't know, every one of our guns were out, we always leave them in the trucks. We never had a gun in the cabin which was probably a good thing, if I had turned on the flashlight we all might have got killed. 

I laid there and he kept lookin' at me and then he would look at them, but he would just stand there. He would move his head and shift himself but then he would just keep starin' at us. And my dogs were just out there whinin' and carryin' on, ya know, scared to death. If it would have been a bear they would have been goin' nuts but they were just whinin' out there. And I remembered I had a big eight cell battery flash light that we would sit between the bunk bed and the day bed. It was there just in case someone had to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night they could just reach down there and get that light. They could go out and I reached and it wasn't anywhere around and I thought, what in the world. It was always there. I was gonna turn it on because I wanted to know exactly what it was. I didn't know whether Whitney had gotten it and went out earlier to go to the bathroom and didn't put it back or what because it was always put in that one spot. And he watched me while I was reachin' around, you know? He just stood there watchin', and then ah, I just thought, well, we were all Christians so if he attacks we would all go to heaven. He stood between us and the only door out of the cabin. We would have had to go through him or around him there was no other way out of there. 

I then tried to wake Randy up. He was on the bunk above me. I tried to gently shake the bed and said, “Randy, Randy,” but he wouldn't wake! But anyway, I laid there and finally I pretended like I was sleepin' and I'm layin' there and I peak and he is still standin' there lookin' at all of us. I finally laid back down and I heard him walkin' and I didn't know if he was comin' towards us or what. Then I heard the screen door open and that time comin' in it must have been restin' against him so it didn't hit the door frame hard but when he went out that screen door when it shut, they had carpet all around the frame so the mosquitoes couldn't get in around it, so it was quiet, it just kinda went thump thump thump, and then he left. And the dogs they were just, just, scared to death but he never bothered any of the dogs, he just left. Walked back into the swamp. So I just laid there, I couldn't go back to sleep, and I, one thing I did do was, I laid there for about fifteen minutes and I got up and tip toed in the kitchen and shut and locked the screen door and shut the inside door.

I went back to bed and about 2:30 in the morning Whitney woke up and had to go pee. She said, "Wyatt, Wyatt, what in the world is wrong with those dogs?" Because they were just shook up, and I said, "I don't know, why?" She said, "Just listen to them", she said, "They're out there cryin' there's something wrong." And, she said, "I got to go pee; will you walk out to the outhouse with me?" I said, "Yeah, I will." I reached out for the flash light again and I said, "where's that flash light, it was here", and she said, "Oh, I put it on the night stand." And I reached and instead of putting it between the beds, she had set it on the night stand. And, she said, "I just, I just set it up there." And probably for a good reason, there's no tellin' what could of happened if I shined the light on him. But anyway, I walked her out, I walked her and she took the flash light and I stood halfway between the outhouse and the cabin. I was kinda looking around to make sure he wasn't coming back. She went to the bathroom and we went back inside. The dogs were still all shook up. She said, "I wonder what's goin' on?" Well I didn't want to tell her anything, I was the only one that saw it. We went in and went to bed, and the dogs did finally settle down. I slept a little and I got up about five in the morning because we like to leave at daybreak to go out lookin' for bear tracks. 

I started breakfast while the others woke up; we had eggs, potatoes and some kinda meat. I started it, but the girls finished makin' it. While they finished makin' breakfast, I put the dogs in the dog boxes on my truck; I don't think I had the trackin' collars at that time. After breakfast, about 5:30 A.M., we all headed out. Whitney and Clive were in their truck and the rest were with me in my truck. David had a cable across his drive and after we got through the cable and down the trail about 300 yards, I got my dog Sport out. I would always put one dog down out in front of the truck, I just drive slow behind him and he goes down the trail windin' and when he smells a bear he starts barkin'. He would go after the bear and I would jump out of the truck and get the other dogs out and send them after him. And we took out down this one trail and he acted squirrely, like he didn't want to be out. He usually would drift back and forth, this time stayed right in front of the truck. He would go down a ways and he'd stop and look back, but he wasn't driftin' back and forth, he was as just nervous as a cat. 

We went out, it's about two and a half to three miles to the west out to the highway on a little two track back to the cabin. We made it all the way out to the highway and I got him and loaded him back into the truck. Then we went south on the highway toward town about three quarters of a mile and turned left on a trail that headed toward the lake. And there is a big wild cherry orchard and the bears just love them cherries, that time of the year they are dead ripe. I went over to the cherry orchard and took Sport all through that, we almost always would start a bear in there, and he just didn't act right, just didn't act right, so I loaded him back up in the truck. And we went back down the road and turned south about an eighth of a mile to another little trail, when we went, there is a little lake that I mentioned before, about a twenty- twenty five acre lake, we went up and around, because it gets hilly, that lake and there is a little trail that goes all the way across about three miles across the road behind us, the south side of the road. I loaded him up and drove northeast around the lake, got him out and put'm down, and he's doin' pretty good, he's windin' and goin' down the trail and he stopped. There's a little foot trail that went off that trail and he started down that foot trail and I thought he winded a bear. 

So, in the mean time, I'm sittin' on the hood of the truck so I can watch him better and Samantha was drivin' the truck. So, I had her stop and I slid off the truck, and I'm walkin' and Sport goes down this trail and I walked down the trail behind him. And he's comin', and the trail follows a ridge, and the trail comes to a point and it's on the back side of that lake. And that swamp ran all the way from the cabin down to the lake and across, it had to be five miles across that swamp. But anyway, I followed him all the way to the end of that trail and he comes out to the end of that point and then that trail dropped into the lake. It was a game trail, and he came to the end of that point and threw his nose up in the air and just stopped, and he just froze starin' down at the lake. And he kind of growled a little bit and all the hair jumped up, I mean all of his hair and the day was just breakin day good, and his hair jumped up from his tail to his nose. I mean it just bristled right up and he just stood there starin' down in there, and I'm lookin' down in there and I can't see anything. But he was windin' and he might have saw the creature. 

He looked at me and he just turned around and started back out that trail, just stiff legged and kind of trottin'. And I following him walkin' just as hard as I can go and I know somethin' bad, he saw something bad, the hair on the back of my neck stood up, and I know if it had been a bear Sport would have went right down there after it, but he didn't. He headed right back to the truck, and when we got close to the truck he took off runnin' and jumped right into the truck and run right to the dog box, he was tryin' to get in the dog box. I opened the dog box and he ran in and laid right down, with his head down, just layin' there. I still hadn't told Randy and them anything about the night before. I shut the dog box and shut the tailgate.

I got in the truck and drove back down the trail toward the road. We used to check it first in the morning because it had a lot of cherries off through there too. I figured we would strike a bear through there, anyways, we went about three quarters of a mile down the trail and we had another couple of miles to get out to the end, and I had Samantha stop and I got Sport back out of the dog box, he didn't want to get out very bad. I got him out and he started down the trail but he wasn't actin' right. So, I let out my little bluetick female named Rose that would stay right with him, the other dogs wouldn't but she would. Anyway, I let Rose out, put her out with him, and he started actin' a little better because she was out there with him. I jumped on the hood and Samantha started drivin', Sport went down the trail about another half a mile and threw his head in the air and started howlin'. He could smell a bear. Rose couldn't smell it but he had a better nose than her, I had Samantha stop the truck and I got three other dogs out, Shotgun, Tennessee and Joe, and I was holdin' them. Sport and Rose went across and when I heard Rose start howlin' I knew it was a pretty good track so I turned all the dogs in with them. Randy never turned any of his dogs out. 

They ran across the ridge and the bear was jumped, they ran about a half a mile and treed the bear. It was a sow and a cub that was about a year and a half old cub, and me and Clive went to the tree, I said, “Clive grab your gun.” He got his thirty-thirty Marlin out of the case and loaded it and we started in to the tree, the dogs were just hammerin' that tree. Anyways the cub for some reason jumped out of the tree and took off runnin'. My lead dog, Sport seen it jump and went after it, well, when he went it pulled every dog to run with him because he was runnin' hot and hard. Me and Clive were probably half way to 'em, and that sow got nervous and came out of the tree so Clive didn't get to shoot her. Anyway, the dogs run, every one of 'em was runnin' and there was a guy up there we knew named Ian. He asked me when we was out huntin' once that if the dogs run a bear by him was it alright for him to shoot it. He was a nice guy so I said, "No, I don't mind it. Just let me know because I would like to take pictures of the dogs with it."

The dogs were runnin' and I heard a gun go off, and then I heard another shot and we headed toward the dogs. We hollered for the others to bring the trucks and we got over there cuzz the dogs were still barkin' and Ian had shot that bear. So we got pictures with it and after that, when we got done huntin' that day and got back to camp that evening I told Whitney and all of 'em what had happened the night before. Whitney wanted to go home and I said, "It never bothered us. It came in the cabin but we'll make sure we shut the doors now." It never did bother us. It just stood there lookin at us. Anyway, we stayed up there, we had another full week to hunt. He was just observin' us, he never bothered us and I never bothered him. If I would have turned on that flashlight there is no tellin' what might have happened. So then, anyway, it was four months later that there was a Bigfoot sighting of him crossing the road about six to seven miles from where I had saw him. There was a car coming from the north and another one coming from the south and they slowed right down and he came up out of the ditch. He crossed right over the road and went down the other side, he didn't run and they said it was Bigfoot.

That's the whole story of it."

Whether or not this creature was actually Bigfoot, I don't know. All I know is, something was in that cabin with my dad that wasn't human. My dad always swore that this story is true. He has since passed, but he never recanted this story. I believe him. I guess it's up to you if you want to believe or not.
