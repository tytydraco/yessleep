I’m sorry it’s taken me a little while to update you guys, but to be honest, I wasn’t sure that I would be *able* to and I’m honestly convinced it’s even a good idea. I need to talk about it, though, and I need to make sense of it.

I screwed up, guys.

I broke the rules.

Before I get to that, though, if you haven’t read the first part of my story, I suggest you do that because it’ll make much more sense, as much as any of this can make sense.

I really wasn’t planning on going to the viewing on Saturday, because I still thought it was a hoax of some kind. I mean, it had to be right? There was no information on the film that was showing. No title, no genre, no director, no cast and not even a year of release. In other words, it was exactly what I had been searching for. I knew I’d regret it if I didn’t go. I made sure to write down the directions given to me in the email and left my flat long after sunset that evening.

Let me just say right now that I’m not going to divulge the exact location of the event. Besides, I have a suspicion that if you went there, it would already be gone. Best I can give you is that it was in an industrial part of the city.

I found myself standing outside a large red bricked warehouse. There were no parking spaces, no signs of any other people or anything remotely suggesting that this was the right location. I felt so stupid and was ready to give up and go home when the sound of music caught my ear. It was a soft beat that made me feel like I was at a rave. When I turned around again, a door that I swear wasn’t there before had appeared. It was only ever-so-slightly ajar, but I immediately knew it was the right door.

As soon as I stepped over the threshold, the door closed behind me and I was too afraid to turn around to see if it was still there, so I kept walking.

Eventually, the light illuminated a glass podium where a person stood. They wore a smart black and white suit and had raven black hair tied up into a high ponytail and what must have been contact lenses because their eyes were a deep shade of red.

“Phone please.” they said, politely enough.

I got the impression that it was more of a demand than a request and so I reached inside my pocket and handed them the phone.

“Ticket.” they continued, carefully eyeing me up and down.

“Uh I wasn’t given--” I stuttered

“Your right pocket.”

“Oh.”

I dug into the right pocket of my jeans and was surprised to find a ticket that very closely resembled an ordinary cinema ticket, with a few differences. There was no age rating and the only words written on it were:

**The Violet Rooms Presents:**

*“Iudicium*”

No director.

No run time.

Nothing at all.

My heart sat in my throat and I wondered if it was too late to turn around.

“Your screen is door no 3, seat 6.” said the host

“What if I need the toilet?” I asked, trying to lighten the mood

“You must not leave your seat for the duration of the film.”

“That’s a no about the toilet then. Right, thank you.”

I walked through the corridor, which was only barely illuminated for me to see where I was going, but as I passed a couple of other doors, I thought I saw a familiar face outside them. He stared into the void and I knew that face. One I had seen only a few days before.

“Benny!” I said, “Benny what are you---”

My lips froze when Benny turned around and I saw that his eyes were just white and his face looked empty. I stumbled backwards into another person who grabbed me by the shoulders.

“Do not speak to other attendees even if you think you might recognise them!” the host hissed

“What’s wrong with him?” I asked

“He’s one of ours now.”

“What? What does that mean?”

“Screen 3 is on your right. Enjoy the film.”

Just like that the host was gone again and I couldn’t see Benny behind me. I hesitated for a bit before I pushed the door handle and entered the screen. There was a large projector screen and only one single seat was illuminated and I sat down.

I wish I could tell you about the film itself, but it’s like the more I try to think about it, the harder it is to remember. It was like….distorted fragments and images that made no sense at all. Some of them were vaguely familiar, like puzzle pieces that I’d seen somewhere before, but couldn’t really remember them.

I was so focused on the film and couldn’t take my eyes off the screen that it took a while before I noticed it. It was faint at first, but then I realised I heard footsteps. Something about them was off, though. It was far too heavy to belong to a normal person and the way it moved seemed like it was, maybe not injured, but like it trudged, like it was…hoofed.

Then I heard the grunting and then came the stench.

Oh god the stench was almost overwhelming. Like rotten eggs that had been left out in the heat and I had to close my mouth. Whatever the thing was, it moved through the screen, stopping every now and then to sniff and when it was close to me, I closed my eyes, too afraid to open them. The person - or the creature - was right next to me, breathing into my face and I dared not move. The film was still showing on the screen and in the background, I swear I heard Benny’s voice crying out in agony, and my heart would not stop racing.

The creature’s breath was hot in my ear, and then suddenly - it stopped. The smell was gone and when I was sure the creature wasn’t there anymore, I opened my eyes. The film was still running and I remembered the rules, but I didn’t care. I got off the seat and ran for the door, through the hallway and past the host. I didn’t even care about my phone.

I jumped into the closest available taxi and went home.

I know I shouldn’t have left before the film was done, but I couldn’t stay. Even if I can’t remember exactly what was shown, I know it was something I’d rather forget and I know it made me uncomfortable.

Benny’s gone, I know that for a fact and I think I am on a ticking clock. Ever since I got home and every time I’ve looked in a mirror or anywhere with a reflection, I’ve seen eyes in the background. I’m afraid of what’s going to happen when the clock stops ticking.
