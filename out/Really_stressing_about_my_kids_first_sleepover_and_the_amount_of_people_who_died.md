“…so your dead weird friend Oscar is the one we buried in the woods, and even though you killed him, [he’s crawled out of the ground to find us](https://redd.it/15i09dt). Do I have that right?”

“No, Dad,” my son answered, his shoulders falling in disappointment.

My heart soared. I’d never been so glad to be wrong.

“His name is Oliver, not Oscar.”

I stopped breathing and waited for him to continue. “And?” I gasped after several tense seconds.

He looked up at me in confusion. “And what?”

My jaw slipped. “Was I wrong about anything else in that fucked up explanation?”

He scratched his head. “No, the rest was pretty much spot-on,” he replied, folding his arms. “I think it’s kind of hypocritical that you always get mad when I say the ‘fuck’ word.”

“Well it’s a fucked up situation,” I countered. 

“So do you want to un-fuck it?” ugly kid asked, his eyes wide.

My head spun. “How do you un-fuck a zombie back into the grave?” I stammered.

My son stared at me. He won the blinking contest. “Do you trust me?” he asked.

Something about the way he glared at me sent shivers from my tongue to my butthole and back. I nodded, unable to speak.

Ugly kid forced the shovel into my hand. 

My son still didn’t blink. “Let’s move.”

That’s how I found myself driving back to the God-forsaken woods where I’d been an hour before. I was grateful that my son had told ugly kid he didn’t need to come along, that we could take care of things ourselves. On top of getting away from the creepy child, it would provide a desperately needed opportunity for a father/son discussion about the horrible things that had led us to this point.

We drove in silence. 

I didn’t need him to tell me when we’d gotten close to the place where we’d buried Oliver. I could tell by the sheer creeping sensation that amplified as I drew nearer, like I was seeking the source of a particularly unnerving sound. 

I got out of the car and walked to the mound of fresh dirt I’d recently left. It looked undisturbed.

“Dig it up,” he ordered.

“I… I thought the kid crawled out of the ground,” I offered as a weak reply. 

He cocked his head. 

Hands shaking, I started digging. I moved efficiently until my shovel hit something solid.

We both froze. 

I tossed aside the shovel and knelt down. Brushing the dirt away with trembling fingers, I soon recognized what I was seeing. “This… is the rug from our basement,” I whispered. “I would have thought he threw it away as he crawled out of the ground.”

My son didn’t speak.

So I turned back to the dirty, stained carpet. One corner was accessible; I could see “1913” and our street name, and cursed myself for leaving evidence that could be traced back to us.

No more mistakes.

I held my breath and pulled the rug back, ready for anything.

A tiny vomit chunk hit my uvula as I recognized Reverse Pizza Kid’s blue face looking back at me. Dirt covered part of his half-open eye; as I watched, an ant crawled out of his nose and into his mouth. He smelled like microwaved fecal lasagna. 

“I… I…” the words didn’t work right. “You said he came back from the dead, that he crawled out of the grave and came to our home.”

“It’s time for the truth, Dad, and you’re not gonna like it,” my son replied. 

I looked up at him from the hole where I stood.

“It would be best if you stayed where you are.”

So I stopped to type this up and post it before listening to [what he had to say](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).
