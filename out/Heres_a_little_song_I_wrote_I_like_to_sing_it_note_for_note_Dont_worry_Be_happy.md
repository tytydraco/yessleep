The thing is it's not going to matter in a few days. the Dummy warhead on the satellite unusually positioned much further away than the majority of satellites used for communication and information sharing.

 a Russian satellite we have requested info on for   the longest just being told its nothing but gathering data from its space environment. Denying all questions except the one about a dummy warhead. It's a violation of the space warfare agreement. To keep nukes out of our atmosphere. 

Which technically it is outside the atmosphere. Almost the same range as the one the US detonated in 69' and discovered the range of the emp was still able to make lights flicker in Hawaii which was right under it. 

The 10 Megaton warhead submarine/drone that Russia used as a threat of a nuclear tidal wave for Europe. Particularly the UK. Is actually nothing compared to the nuke outside our atmosphere. They recently discovered some of the most crucial Internet connections that are ran deep underwater in between continents to allow for high speed data transmission to be intercontinental. 

Since it's kinda like a big loop if one is damaged. It just slows the data transfer down due to rerouting back from the way it came. But i doesn't interrupt the data completely. But if another one is damaged before repair on the other is complete. Then you have to rely on the satellite transmission of data to provided us with a idea of what's going on over seas. 

In a few days. That dummy warhead is going to show who the dummy really is. It will be conveniently located over top of the eastern  USA. It's going to detonate. We will all see the radiating ball of fire I that is temporarily going to fuck our weather up. And blind thousands. 

 From the unreal amount Of heat. During the first blast. It's going to be late at night around 3am eastern time. It will be blinding. You might see it through your walls and ceilings. 

Immediately after the space detonation about 30 seconds later. The underwater nuke that was placed conveniently near the the largest of the bundles of this intercontinental data tranfer cables on lower side of the gap between the US and Europe. 

Now within a minute they will have effectively disconnected US from high speed data transfers. The emp blast from the space detonation will completely destroy 95% of the satellites withing its a direct unobstructed path of sight. 

The emp and physical destruction of the tsar they detonated underwater to destroy the last line of communication betwee nations. May even cause a shift of the plates. Causing a massive scale earthquake then a few hours later the water will rise tremendously followed by a surge of water so large it will destroy all of the low country lands of its own continent. Meanwhile we will he in the dark.

 Ukraine will launch its long range missiles Russia will fire eye for a eye until Ukraines population is less than $5k. If we are lucky it ends there. If we are unlucky then we will be very VERY unlucky. As in 2-4k nuclear warheads headed towards every possible location to cripple our country. Our power plants, military installations, possible nuclear launch silos.

 Major resources and supply chains. All traffic will come to a dead stand still. Most our children will likely be in schools while we are out working. All.service.has been lost. We just want our loved ones. 

As we are frantically panicking to get home. The news is finally spread that intercontinental and hypersonic missiles are headed our way. So we do the only thing left to do. And launch all our 4k warheads towards theirs country effectively mapped to completely leave no Russian land unscorched. 98% of Russian occupants will be dead in the next 96 hours. 80% of all Americans in the USA will be dead in 96 hours. With 40% dead from the blast. And 30% from fallout
 The last 30% will be the ones that starve or die of sickness or injury. It will not be a dignified death. It will be painful. And it will be lonely or worse it will be at the hands of the wicked preying on the weak. 

We will not recieve proper burials as the death toll and body count will continue at a rate so quick that we have to start tossing our babies, siblings, children, parents, loved ones, into body piles. Leaving them a small token of memory to take with them back to the energy from which we came. The smell of burning bodies is only slightly more bearable than the smell of rotting ones.

The worst is hearing the screams of those toward the center of the piles. The one or two who were presumed dead but were alive there would be one at least in every 3rd or 4th pile. All our emergency services that we slaved away at work to pay the tax to have will no longer exsist we will be on our own. 

If your lucky a family member will have the decency to save you your humility and dignity and treat you to a decent day the best they can give before the radiation sickness begins really run its course. Maybe they will just find the best meal they can and make it for you under the darkness of the soot filled air. And talk about all the good times yall shared. 

Find enough power via batteries or generators or the last of Gas in the car to run a invertor. Play a game with the kids and watch a loving movie with a happy ending. If we are lucky enough the kids will have gone to sleep just before the gas is out and the darkness takes hold again. Then a loud pop ensures they are forever dreaming the best and happiest of dreams. You and your partner remain. To mourn. You hold her until she too crys herself to sleep. You rub her back and comfort her until she snores and with another pop it becomes silent. 

You cant bring yourself to finish the job. You give them all a proper burial and even prepare your own. But just cant pull it. You become sick from all the radiation you took on to give them a proper resting place. But you know It can take as long as a month for It to kill you and is known as the most painful death possible you accept it as punishment for the acts you had to do. Where is your god you wonder. After a few more days you find you cant move to much or it will cause your flesh to crack as it breaks down and sloughs off of you in random slabs. You finally manage to make your way to your final bed beside your family. There is no peace or warmth. Only thing with you is the pain. You can feel every single cell as it dies. The blood as it builds pressure inside some and  withers in the other organs until they all shut down one by one the pain has been too much your mind is unaffected. You have laid in this grave but don't know how long. You are blind. And too week to move. Everything burns your heart feels like a stone filled sack of leather as it struggles to pump. You feel it stop. Suddenly you feel slightly euphoric. The pain begins to fade. You imagine your family all waiting to embrace you with a hug. Your floating to them. Weightless. You feel nothing but excitement and joy to meet their warm embrace. You reach them and you all begin to hug. But you don't feel it your body is gone there is no light, nobody, no place, no sound, no touch, no smell, no Taste, no life nothing. It's over. 

Just empty space where a soul once was. Billions of them. Some fast some slow. The planet is rebuilding the safest places are also.the worst places.

Good luck though. Waiting for you to join the nothing. The void, the end. 

See you, space cowboys.
