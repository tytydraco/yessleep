Gigantic cities upon the seas — that is how many describe the ships of our time.
And I can hardly blame them. These are colossi, reminding one of Zeus himself.
Yet they leave a different mark on each soul.
Some hardly notice the ship’s precious rise and fall with the ocean’s breath.
Others feel the lurking threat beneath, a shade of danger — even their reflection in the mirror grows uneasy.
But the story I remember is of another kind.

It was a voyage through the depths of night.
At first glance, nothing special — a crossing from the Port of Dover to the French Calais, a return from a school trip across southern England.
But at the stroke of midnight, something unusual happened.
I wasn’t alone; I knew many aboard — schoolmates, mostly.
There was one of them, Vladislav, the one of whom I am to write.
A boy full of strength, resolve, friendship, and wit —
but lacking one crucial thing: the ability to restrain his id on caffeine.
And that, as it turned out, became his fatal sin.

At the fateful tick of the clock, as if Death herself had pulled the marrow from his neck,
he collapsed.
Not swiftly, not slowly —
he fell to his knees, then onto his side, rolling onto his back like a great whale gasping in sweet water.
He lay there, nearly motionless — yet breathing.
Then came the laughter.
Not the soft, heart-born laughter of joy or innocence —
but the laughter of a devil, mingled with the sobbing of angels.
He laughed and laughed, but not from the heart — one could hear that plainly.
Perhaps it came from the depths of the watery abyss,
or from the lightless corners of his restless mind.

He tried to rise — truly he did.
But for a long while, he could not.
He twisted from side to side like a chicken with its head cut off.
He covered his face like a terrified clown,
kicked his legs like a child struggling to reach the surface of an unyielding sea.

His agony lasted for a quarter of an hour, perhaps longer.
Yet, as the length of this tale suggests,
Belzebub’s torment had not yet ended.
But his power was waning; the caffeine’s grip was loosening.

Vladislav managed to stand — to resist the call of the sea below.
But his mind was not free.
He was not confused — not as one might expect.
He knew who he was, and where he had come from.
On the contrary, it seemed some higher knowledge had been unlocked within him —
or better said, higher sight.
He saw the unseen.
When he looked at you, he did not look at you —
but at the figure standing before you.
What figure?
The figure of the dead — the ones mortal eyes cannot perceive.
Some would call it a hallucination.
He called it a spirit.

He began to speak — in a tongue not born of mortal throats.
He spoke to those spectral figures of the un-living.
Then suddenly, he turned, took two steps toward the wall, and stopped.
He reached out his hand with a sigh.
"They fear me," his lips whispered. "They run."

We wanted to help him,
but awe and terror froze us in place.
No one moved. No one dared.

He began to sway.
From side to side.
Not at random — in rhythm, with the ship’s gentle rise and fall.
He moved with it, one with the vessel itself.
We did not follow him.
We feared his power.
We only watched,
lest he become his own victim.

He circled the ship three times
before we were all forced to retreat to the lower decks,
bringing Vladislav’s body with us.
He still responded, walked on his own, heard us —
but it was no longer him.
It was as though his thoughts were ruled by another.

Terrified, we sat in our bus seats below deck.
His eyes blinked once — and he slept.
According to his words later, he had slept through the entire crossing.
He remembered nothing — as if someone had erased his memory.
Or perhaps someone had added something to ours.

What remains certain is this:
his mind had wandered somewhere far beyond the rest of us.
