A man named Girard was walking home from work, suddenly felt a sharp blow to the back of his head. He stumbled and fell to the ground, barely conscious. A shadowy figure loomed over him, searching through his pockets and taking his wallet and belongings. Girard tried to fight back, but the assailant hit him again, and everything went black.

When he woke up, he noticed he was in a hospital bed. He could hear the beeping of machines and the hushed voices of doctors and nurses. He felt a throbbing pain in his head and a strange numbness in his limbs. Furthermore, Girard tried to move, but he was strapped down to the bed.

The doctors told him that he had suffered a severe traumatic brain injury and needed emergency surgery. They explained that there was a risk of permanent damage, but they were doing everything they could to save his life. The man nodded weakly, too stunned and scared to say anything.

As the surgeons operated on his brain, he felt himself slipping into unconsciousness. But instead of drifting into the darkness of sleep, he found himself in a different world altogether. Girard was then surrounded by an endless expanse of blackness, with no sight or sound. He couldn't see anything, but he could still feel a sense of time passing. It was as if he had been transported to a different universe, one where color didn't exist.

He felt a strange sense of calmness in this void. He didn't feel any pain or fear, only a peacefulness that he had never experienced before. Girard could feel the blackness calling to him, inviting him to stay in this timeless place. But just as he was about to succumb to its pull, he felt a jolt and was suddenly back in his hospital bed.

He woke up to find the doctors and nurses surrounding him, looking relieved and pleased. They told him that the surgery was a success, and that he would make a full recovery. Girard was grateful, but he couldn't shake the memory of the void and the feeling of the blackness calling to him. He felt a strange pull towards it, as if a part of him had been left behind in that other universe. As he lay in his hospital bed, Girard couldn't help but wonder if he had truly been to another world, or if it had all been a hallucination brought on by his injury. 

He was trying to remember details of this other world, but he found it difficult trying to remember details about a dark void. Girard does remember himself trying to talk out loud, but no sound escaped his lips. He was completely and utterly alone, adrift in a sea of blackness. He was not terrified like others might have been, but he also felt a strange sense of curiosity. He wanted to know what was out there in the void, what secrets it held and why it felt so comfortable.

He didn't know if he would ever find out the truth, but he couldn't shake the feeling that the void was still calling to him, inviting him back to its peaceful embrace. Then after a few weeks in the hospital, now home, is when the dreams started...
