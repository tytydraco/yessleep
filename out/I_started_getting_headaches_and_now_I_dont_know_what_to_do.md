Hey, I’m not familiar with this subreddit but I know it’s vaguely about getting advice for some strange shit that happens so I’m posting this because I’m running out of options. I’m not even sure if there’s anything anyone can do; I just need to get this out there.

A little background: I’m 23, pretty healthy, and I don’t usually get headaches or migraines. The only medication I take is 20mg escitalopram for mild depression, and I’ve been on it for two years with zero side effects


It started a few weeks ago. At first, it was nothing bad, just a dull ache. I thought I was dehydrated, so I drank some water and took ibuprofen. It went away, so I forgot about it. But later that night, while eating dinner, the headache came back, this time a bit worse. Once again, I took an ibuprofen and continued with eating and the rest of my nightly routine. Then, at about 2 or 3 am, I was suddenly awoken by a throbbing pain in my skull. It was of an intensity I have never had before in my life. It was like someone was constantly squeezing and pushing into my brain while it was inside my head. Stupidly, I took some stronger painkillers to see if that would do anything, but the pain didn’t go away. It only got worse. I could feel my brain pulsating as it reeked with this hot, searing pain. I ended up throwing up due to the severity of the pain.

 

I decided that I couldn’t wait for my GP to be open, so I woke my partner up and got him to drive me down to a nearby 24-hour medical centre. Apparently, we decided to pick the one night where everyone had a medical emergency because the place was full of people. So, we had to wait for probably hours while I was rolling around in pain. Finally, the doctor called me in to have a look. I think I leapt out of my chair I couldn’t wait.

I described my symptoms while he checked for other abnormalities. The only thing noted was that my blood pressure was slightly lower than normal. He said nothing seemed seriously wrong, prescribed painkillers, and told me to come back if it didn’t improve, so he could refer me to a specialist. A massive waste of time, I thought. But I tried the painkillers, anyway, figuring it couldn’t get any worse.

After a few more days of dealing with this near-constant headache, I tried to see another doctor. This time, they managed to refer me to a neurologist who ended up giving me a CT scan. Having to wait nearly 2 days to get the results back was one of the most anxiety-inducing experiences of my life. By then, I was throwing up nearly every day and felt exhausted all the time. I hoped it was just from the pain.

 

When I got the call from the doctor, my stomach dropped. She told me to immediately admit myself to a hospital because the CT scans had indicated brain swelling. She said that at this point, they wouldn’t need any surgery, but I needed to be kept for monitoring, and they needed to give me an MRI so they could get a better look to see how bad the swelling was.

My time at the hospital blurred. I waited a whole week for the MRI results while my symptoms worsened. I couldn’t keep food down, could barely see sometimes, and my blood pressure kept dropping. I even thought about suicide, but a hospital is the worst place for that.

When the results came back, I knew they were bad. The doctor, while trying to keep a calm exterior, was failing miserably. A slight look of fear was painted all over her face.

 

“Good afternoon, Marcus, how are you feeling today?”

 

“I just want to know about the results, I can’t wait any longer”

 

“I’ve reviewed your MRI results with our radiology team and the findings were a bit…. unusual.”

 

“What does that mean?”

 

She swallowed dryly

 

“Marcus, we were wrong about the initial assumption about your brain swelling. It’s not. It’s growing.”

 

“Growing? What do you mean growing?”

 

“I mean that the overall volume of your brain has slowly but measurably been expanding. Specifically in the frontal and parietal lobes. There’s no fluid build-up, no tumour, no signs of infection of any kind…. The tissue itself seems healthy. It’s just growing”

 

“How is that even possible?”

 

“We don’t know. The human brain doesn’t grow in adulthood, certainly not like this. Neurons don’t regenerate that way. We’ve checked the images and even re-scanned to rule out errors. But it’s definitely grown, just a few millimetres.”

 

“What does this mean? Is it going to stop?”

 

I can tell she’s choosing her words carefully.

“We don’t know. This isn’t a known condition. Right now, we’re focusing on managing the pressure in your skull and tracking the growth rate. If it continues... we may need to surgically relieve the pressure to prevent damage.”

 

“You’re talking about cutting into my skull.”

“Only if it becomes critical. For now, we’re monitoring closely, giving you medication to reduce intracranial pressure. But I want to be honest — this isn’t something we’ve seen before. It’s not textbook.  We’ve had to consult with other neurologists and research hospitals. No one's seen anything like this. Some suggested rapid-onset gliosis, but your markers don’t match. One of them floated a prion-like process, but... that doesn’t explain the organisation. Or the *activity*.

 

“What is that supposed to mean?”

 

She gives me a hesitant look before divulging further

 

“There are coordinated signals. Patterns we don’t typically see in those parts of the brain. Or in tissue that has recently formed.”

“So, it’s not just growing. It’s working.”

“We don’t know what it means yet. But whatever this is, it’s not inert. It’s functional. And that’s what concerns us.”

 

That was yesterday

 

I keep asking questions, but they’re not telling me much. I can almost *feel* it growing and pushing against my skull. I’m scared. I think I’m going to die.

If anyone has any idea what this could be or what I should do, please help. I’m desperate.
