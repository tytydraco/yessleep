# Being a single dad isn’t easy, but I’ve always done my best. Since Sarah, my daughter Emily’s mom, disappeared two years ago, it’s just been the two of us. Emily was only eight when it happened, and though she never says it, I can see the quiet sadness in her eyes—the way she clings to her old stuffed bunny, the way her voice trembles when she talks about her mom.

Every night, I tell her, “I’ll always be here for you, my angel.” And I meant it. I still mean it. I’d burn this world to keep that promise.

But things started to change. It started with the lullaby.

One night, as I passed by Emily’s room, I heard it—a soft, lilting tune drifting out, gentle but chilling. It wasn’t like the usual hums she’d make when she tried to fall asleep. This was different. It was too clear, too melodic. Something about it made the hair on the back of my neck stand up.

At first, I thought it was just her. Maybe she was singing in her sleep, but when I peeked inside, I saw her lying motionless on the bed, her face serene and still, eyes shut tight. The music continued, faint but persistent.

I froze. It wasn’t her voice.

I rushed into her room, flipping on the light, and Emily stirred, blinking up at me in confusion. “Daddy?” she whispered.

“Sweetie,” I said, trying to steady my shaking hands. “Did you hear that? The singing?”

She gave a small smile, brushing her golden curls out of her face. “Mommy sings to me at night.”

My heart dropped. “Sweetie, Mommy isn’t here.” I swallowed hard. My voice cracked. “Mommy’s not coming back.”

Emily’s smile only grew. “I know. But she still sings to me.”

I convinced myself it was just innocent imagination—a child’s longing for the one who left her. That night, I kissed Emily goodnight and tried to sleep, but something was off. I couldn’t shake the feeling that there was something wrong, something I couldn’t explain.

The next night, I heard it again.

The lullaby.

This time, I wasn’t going to let it slip by unnoticed. I grabbed my phone and sat outside her door, my breath shallow, my heart pounding. I hit the record button, my hands trembling. The voice was clearer this time—unmistakable. It wasn’t just any lullaby; it was *her* song. The one Sarah used to sing when Emily was a baby. A song only she would know.

But there was something else. A rasping breath, too deep and unnatural to be Emily’s, followed by a whisper—a voice that was not my daughter’s.

“My name.”

I barged into her room, the panic rising in my chest. Emily was sitting up in bed, her eyes barely open, groggy. “Daddy?” she asked, confused.

I checked every corner of her room, the closet, under the bed, behind the curtains. Nothing. But then, I saw it.

The stuffed bunny.

It was sitting on the rocking chair in the corner, facing me.

“Did you move Bun-Bun, my love?” I asked, trying to keep my voice calm, though my heart was racing.

She shook her head, her eyes half-lidded, her voice barely a whisper. “No, Daddy.”

“Okay, monkey, let’s get you back to sleep.” I tucked her in, kissed her head, and tried to force myself to sleep. But the recording… the words still echoed in my mind.

I sat in the living room, playing the recording over and over, trying to convince myself it was just my exhaustion, the stress of raising her on my own. But deep down, I knew. I couldn’t deny it anymore.

The next morning, Emily looked pale. She barely touched her breakfast, trembling as she held her spoon. She whispered to me, her voice faint, “She was closer last night.”

“Who, sweetie?” I asked, trying to mask the rising dread in my chest.

“Mommy. But… her face was wrong.”

A cold shiver ran down my spine. I felt my throat tighten. “What do you mean?”

“She smiled too big. And her eyes… they weren’t looking at me, Daddy.”

A chill gripped my chest. “Where were they looking?”

Emily hesitated, her small voice barely audible. “At you.”

I didn’t sleep that night. I couldn’t. I sat in the rocking chair beside her, holding Bun-Bun, eyes never leaving Emily’s face, waiting. Watching.

Then, at 3:12 AM, it came.

The lullaby. Soft at first, then building—filling the room with an oppressive weight.

I froze. I saw her. In the doorway. Half-shrouded in darkness.

She looked like Sarah, but… wrong. Her head tilted unnaturally to one side. Her mouth stretched impossibly wide, pulling into a jagged grin that cracked across her face. Her arms hung limp at her sides, fingers twitching like they were being controlled by invisible strings.

Her eyes—empty black voids—stared directly at me. She was closer now, standing right there in the doorway. I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t move.

Then, in a voice that sent a shiver through my bones, she whispered, “I want my daughter.”

The air grew thick, suffocating. I couldn’t tear my gaze away.

Emily stirred beside me, her eyes fluttering open, groggy. The figure turned, its head snapping toward her.

The lullaby changed—turning into a high-pitched, ear-piercing screech, a wail that made my ears ring.

I leaped toward Emily, throwing myself on top of her, shielding her with my body. The room grew colder, the lights flickering violently. The air felt dense, as if it was alive. I couldn’t breathe, my chest tightening with panic.

The figure lunged toward us.

I squeezed my eyes shut, preparing for the worst.

And then—

Silence.

When I opened my eyes, the figure was gone. The room was still, save for the quiet sobs of Emily against my chest. “I got you, baby,” I whispered, stroking her hair. “Daddy’s here. I won’t let anything happen to you.”

We left that night. I packed our things in a frenzy, never once looking back. We moved far away, into a new house—away from whatever haunted us in that old place.

But it wasn’t over.

Weeks later, in the new home, Emily began waking up with bruises—small, finger-shaped marks on her arms. She whispered that she could still hear the lullaby at night. It seeped through the walls, a constant presence.

One night, I woke up to find her standing in the corner of my room. Her back was turned to me, her body stiff. She was humming softly, the melody hauntingly familiar.

When I touched her shoulder, she turned. Her eyes were vacant, her mouth stretched into that same grotesque grin.

In a voice that wasn’t hers, she whispered, “I want my daughter.”

The lights went out.

And then, the singing began again. But this time, it was coming from right behind me.

I didn’t turn around. I couldn’t. But I knew now. She would never leave me.

I had taken care of that.

If she haunts me for the rest of my life, so be it. At least now, she will always be mine..

I will kill and/or die before Em finds out what really happened.

That I was the one who killed her mother when I buried her alive in the basement of our old house in El Paso.

She begged as the dirt hit her face, frantically telling me that she would never do it again, that we could still be a family, and that she would be nothing but submissive from now on. She promised she would do anything and everything for me, and some other things I couldn’t quite understand through her crying.

I never knew you could still hear a body scream even after they’re buried.

but She was going to leave with MY DAUGHTER...

I told you guys, in the beginning, I will burn this world to keep my baby.  
And now… Sarah too will never leave me.

But you’ll never believe me. It’s just another Reddit story...
