I stopped setting the alarm without realizing it.
It wasn’t a decision. It was a symptom.

The sound had already embedded itself inside my head. I woke at the exact minute every morning, my body alert before consciousness arrived. Thinking about the alarm—its redundancy, its insistence—produced a dry, anticipatory anxiety. The body learned to brace itself against a noise that no longer needed to exist. So I removed it. Sleep improved. Vigilance did not.

Months later, my work began to erode. Not dramatically, but through attrition. Meetings without consequence. Problems without origin or resolution. Endless email threads in which I was copied out of habit rather than necessity. One day, I forgot to log into the system.

No one noticed.

For two weeks I appeared sporadically at the office, an administrative ghost. No one asked questions. No one requested explanations. I wasn’t invisible—I was unnecessary. My presence had never been required. That realization settled quietly and did not leave.

The idea arrived without spectacle:
What if someone else took my place?

Not as a joke. Not as metaphor. As logistics.

I searched casting forums, closed groups, professional databases. After weeks, I found Félix. From a distance, he was indistinguishable from me: same height, same neutral posture, the same way of inhabiting silence. The difference was bureaucratic—he was Portuguese, I Mexican. Both of us living in Canada. Félix had once enjoyed moderate success as an actor. His career had stalled. Mine had already ended.

We rehearsed every afternoon. At first, I paid him little. Then more. Félix didn’t imitate me—he absorbed me. He learned my pauses, my minor speech errors, my chronic fatigue. After months, it was no longer clear who was training whom.

The substitution was seamless.

Voice, posture, skin tone. Everything aligned, except my moles and my asthma. Félix mastered my professional field with unsettling ease. He spoke fluently about cartography, navigation systems, specialized software—better than I ever had. He was a superior version of the original.

One summer morning, he went to the office wearing my glasses. No one hesitated. For an actor of his caliber, the workplace was an undemanding stage. We shared an apartment, routines, even occasional partners. There was only one rule: never attract attention. Our deception was not exceptional. It was simply more honest than most.

Years passed.

Then Félix fell ill.

A necrotizing bacteria devoured his face. He survived, but his features were no longer usable. We were no longer interchangeable. He had not acted in years. I had not fully existed in just as long. My supervisor described me—us—as irregular but extraordinarily productive.

We assumed it was the end.

Until I researched further.

I learned that his altered face could be replicated on mine. The risk was severe. Death was a real possibility. But the body no longer felt like property. We found a surgeon in Colombia who asked no questions. The procedure was precise, violent, successful. When I returned from vacation, Félix and I were once again identical. Only our mothers—had they been alive—might have sensed the difference.

I returned to the office. By then, thanks to Félix, I held an executive position. No one questioned it. There were rumors about my fluctuating temperament, but my capacity to resolve crises was unquestioned. They trusted me. They trusted us.

Retirement arrived quietly.

Félix was tired but peaceful. He spoke of returning to Portugal, of founding a community theatre in Nazaré. Perhaps he would tell our story disguised as fiction. I did not know who I was without a role. Work had consumed the architecture of my identity.

Months later, I traveled to see him without warning.

Nazaré. The violent ocean. An open-air theatre facing the sea. Shakespeare by the Water. The setting felt deliberate, almost accusatory.

The performance began.

During Hamlet’s soliloquy, Félix stepped forward.
“To be, or not to be—”

The wind rose. The sound came instantly. A wave lifted itself like an ancient verdict and took him.

The play did not stop.

I took the bloodied skull from the stage. It was heavy. Literal. I walked forward as the audience held its breath.

“To be, or not to be. That is the question.”

And in that moment, I understood what I had resisted for years:

I was never the original.
Only the one who remained.
