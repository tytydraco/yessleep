I didn't understand why mum was crying so much. 

Sure, I was technically flying the nest, but I was only going to study in the US for a year. 

Except she was sobbing, her arm around me tightening when I tried to move away. It was kind of embarrassing, especially in a busy airport, so I smiled and nodded, and tried to politely pull away from her snake-like grip. Mum was acting like she was never going to see me again.

Oscar, my brother, was keeping his distance. 

"I'm going to miss you two," she kept whispering into my shoulder, her tears soaking my shirt collar. "So much." 

"I'll miss you too, mum," I caught a guy's eye in passing, a college student like me, smirking at my mum's breakdown. He uncorked an headphone just to laugh at me, his other hand swiping brown curls from his eyes. 

*Asshole.*

He was so busy laughing at me, however, the guy didn't see the four-person family barrelling toward him like a freight train. The impact was fun to watch from the comfort of my mom's embrace, distracting me from her refusal to detach herself from my neck. "Shit, sorry!" the guy was mumbling to a Karen-looking Mum who had just spilled her Subway cola all over her dress. She even had the iconic bob. I turned my focus back to mum, who moved onto suffocating my brother in hugs. Oscar dodged two, before collapsing into her, giving in. 

God, she was acting like she was never going to see us again. 

"Oscar," I tugged my brother's arm impatiently. 

My brother didn't move his head of bedhead sandy curls from the crook of mum's shoulder. When he let go, his eyes were sparkling with tears. He looked more dishevelled than usual. My brother usually prided himself on his appearance. 

I expected the same, even on an early morning flight. Looking like he'd just rolled out of bed ten minutes ago, Oscar wore a crumpled sweatshirt, jeans, a pair of sunnies pinning his hair back. He didn't say goodbye to her. He just turned and started walking toward our gate, signalling me to follow with his arm.  

When I skidded, twisting to wave at mum one last time, she was lost in the crowd. That stung. But when I thought about it, I don't think she wanted to watch us walk away. I noticed a similar situation happening nearby, a curly blonde locked into her father's arms. "Dad," the girl was groaning into his chest. "It's just a year, and I'll be back during the holidays!" 

The dad didn't reply, instead burying his head in his daughter's hair. 

"Mum," another kid, this time an annoyed looking guy, was trying to detach himself from a woman, and a little girl clinging onto his leg. "Chill out. I'll call both of you when I get there, okay?" He pulled away when they tried to hug him again. "Dude! Can you stop with the touchy touchy?" He bent down and high fived the little kid. 

"Bye, Clem," His smile was gentle, "I won't miss you."

The little girl's expression crumpled, and he made a quick getaway before the inevitable happened. I watched the guy practically sprint away from his family, bowing his head. Grasping my luggage, I quickened my pace to catch up with my brother. Oscar had been unusually quiet. 

He insisted on accompanying me to college, remarking he had a friend he could stay with in New York. Oscar was two years older than me, and had already spent a year abroad. Though he never really talked about it. He didn't tell me it was Mom's idea. But I wasn't stupid, I was aware of their shared looks when they thought I was obvious. 

I hurried to match his pace, but it was almost like he was running or power-walking, to get away from me. 

"Hey," I was out of breath. "Can you… slow down?" 

The guy from earlier flew past me, throwing himself into the lounge, almost hitting me in the face with the door. This kid was acting like his family was hunting him down. Oscar emphasised on coming to a stop, twisting around to shoot me a glare, pushing the door open. "I'm walking at a normal speed," he grumbled. "you're the one who's walking at a snail's pace."

"What's going on with mum?" I managed to get out through heavy breaths, pulling at my carry on. We entered the passenger lounge, Oscar automatically going into *ignore your sister exists* mode. 

I was used to this at home, but when we were travelling, it was a dick move. However, my brother's ignorance wasn't on my mind at that moment. I felt and heard the change the second I stepped over the threshold. The outside ambience of crowd's and panicking faded into an almost suffocating silence. My own voice was suddenly far too loud, clanging in my skull. "Is she always like that? I mean, was she like that with you when you left home…?" 

I drifted off into a whisper, purposely lowering my voice. The atmosphere in the lounge was off. I could sense it in the air, a choking weight drowning everyone. There were others like me, college kids I presumed were also moving abroad; a hooded guy curled up with his head bowed, sleeping, and a girl on the phone. I glimpsed Headphone Boy reading some pretentious dogeared paperback, cross legged on his suitcase, despite there clearly being empty seats around him. 

His eyes were glued to the book, milkshake in one hand, lips curled around the straw. The other passengers however, were silent, their expressions haunted. Maybe they were tired. I did see a woman trying and failing to stay awake. Oscar found a seat, annoyingly far too close to Headphone Boy, and I slid next to him, pulling out my phone. Outside, I watched a plane take off through the window. 

The sky was only just lighting up, dawn breaking through the clouds in a pretty golden glow. I took a picture, posting it to Instagram. 

Insta-like from mum, of course. She left a comment. 

*"Love you. Forever, baby"*

I liked the comment, though it did make me feel kinda sick. Pocketing my phone, I poked Oscar. "Why is everyone so moody?" 

My brother responded with a grunt, so I nudged him a little harder until he was forced to acknowledge me with an eye roll. He tipped his head back and closed his eyes, sliding his raybans over his eyes and sinking deeper into the creases in his chair. Oscar was twenty, and acted 56. He groaned loudly. "Not everyone is as energetic as you at 4am."

"No, I'm serious," I whispered, unable to resist a smile. "These people are acting like we're in Final Destination."

"What if we are?"

The voice was unfamiliar, though when I turned around, Headphone Boy was smiling at me over his book. He had made himself comfortable, using his jacket as a pillow. Again, like there weren't perfectly good seats. "The last one is my favorite," he waggled his eyebrows. "With the plane plot twist."

"I liked the rollercoaster one," I told him. 

He pulled a face, making a point of turning the page of his book. "Urgh. Too gory. I'm not a fan of guts flying everywhere."

I leaned forward. "And the plane one wasn't gory?" 

Headphone Boy went back to his book, slurping on his straw. "The twist was what made the movie. It was shit until then. They dropped hints throughout, but I was too baked to notice until they boarded the flight. Then it clicked." 

I raised a brow. "You watch those movies high?" 

I only got a snort in response. "Who *doesn't* watch them high?" 

Headphone Boy corked his earphones in after a while, and I was left restless in an uneasy silence that had taken hold of the lounge. Oscar fell asleep, and I sat, scrolling through my phone for half an hour before we boarded our flight. When I was pushing my way toward my seat, I noticed a woman was crying. Oscar perked up, thankfully, when he slid into the window seat. 

"Don't worry about mum," he said, making himself comfy. "She's just scared she's going to forget us after takeoff." 

I plonked myself down. "Wow. That stings."

"No, I'm serious," he hummed, untangling his headphones. "It's hard for her." Oscar shot me a look. "You won't remember it, but it was hard for you too. Mum said it took you a while."

I frowned. "To what?"

He shrugged. "To remember me."

His words sent involuntary shivers creeping down my spine. I buckled myself in, my stomach twisting. I was half aware of Headphone Boy jumping into the seat behind us, and making a deal of kicking my seat. "What?" 

I nudged my brother with a choked laugh, but mum's comment on my photo was stirring at the back of my mind. "Is that some kind of joke?" 

Oscar settled me with a look I didn't understand, a look that said so much– and so little.  Instead of speaking, he grasped hold of my hand, clammy fingers entwining around mine. 

He never acted like that. Like an actual brother. Oscar usually hated physical contact (with me) and showed his love by doing dumb shit, like causing unnecessary arguments and claiming the bathroom when he *knew* I was planning on having a shower. 

I shoved him to get some kind of answer, but my brother was dazedly watching the sunrise out of his window, an odd look on his face. Oscar looked sad. But it wasn't the sadness I knew. 

It was the kind of sad that broke him apart inside, the kind I didn't understand. He was smiling, somehow, his expression settling into something resembling peace and melancholy. "Hey." When I turned around, Headphone Boy was dangling over his seat. For the first time, I noticed he had freckles. He inclined his head. 

"Sup with your bro? He looks like he's going through it."

I could only manage a shrug. "I don't know," I said. But the more I looked at Oscar, a wave of suffocating nothing enveloped me, choking the rest of my words. Oscar wasn't the only one. All around me, passengers sat silently, the only talkative ones were the students. 

They all had this haunting expression, like they collectively shared a darkness that was slowly hollowing them out. I noticed a man in the front row staring into nothing, an oblivion only he could see. 

"I think something is wrong," I managed to get out. 

Headphone Guy cocked a brow. "Let me guess," he chuckled. Even he, though, had noticed the atmosphere. Still, he was putting on a brave face, hiding behind sarcasm. "You had a vision the plane is going to explode." he mimed an explosion with his hands. 

I shook my head. "No," I said patiently. "You've noticed it, right?"

His smile faded, and something clenched in my gut. The boy's eyes darkened, lip curling. "Noticed what?" 

"The passengers," I whispered. "Aren't they acting… weird to you?" 

He shrugged. "It's early. They're probably tired."

I gave him a long look, and he sighed. "Okay, yes. I am freaking out right now, but I'm surprisingly good at hiding my terror behind sardonic humor." The boy leaned closer, almost toppling off his seat when the intercom crackled: *Passengers are reminded to please buckle their seat belts.* The guy poked his head between the gap in the seat.. "My seatmate has been acting weird since we boarded," he hissed. "I'm talking sobbing, snot and shit everywhere. She's driving me crazy."

"Have you asked her what's wrong?" I whispered. 

He scoffed. "No? When I say crying, I mean inconsolable. What do I even say to her?" the boy's expression lit up. "Where are you headed, anyway?" 

His question, and change of subject took me by surprise. 

"College," I said, uncertainly. "You?" 

His lip quirked, and he got comfy in his seat. "Now, why would I tell you that?" 

I was about to reply, when a stewardess handed us a small metal disk in a silver package. I pulled it out, eyeing Headphone Boy, who was doing the same, awkwardly pinching it between his fingers. "Stick it onto your left temple," she directed us, before moving down the aisle. Oscar did without question, and after a moment of confusion, so did I. But it wasn't sticking. I kept pressing the disk to stay stuck, but it slid down my face. 

"What is it for?" I asked the stewardess when she was moving back down the aisle. 

Her smile was bright, but her eyes were dark. They resembled my brother's. So irrevocably sad, but also happy and at peace. "It's to remind you that you exist," she said, prodding her own temple to mimic applying the disk. 

Something warm crept its way up my throat.

"What?" 

That was the moment I wanted to get off the plane. I felt it deep inside of me. Something was wrong. Not just with the passengers, but with me. With Oscar. I was going to throw up, nausea slamming into me like a tidal wave. 

I jumped up, surprised when my brother's hand wrapped around my wrist to pull me into my seat. "Do what she says," he said, his tone ice cold. He didn't even turn to look at me, his gaze glued to the window. His hand clutching my wrist was shaking. 

Hearing his words, panic started to curl in my gut, and I tried again to press the thing onto my skin, but it wouldn't stick. 

It was stubborn, refusing to latch onto my flesh. The thing was the size of a singular contact lense, so dropping it meant losing it. My hands started to tremble. The disk slipped through my fingers and landed on my lap, while the captain was making last announcements, reminding passengers to apply the disk to their temple. 

"Oscar." I whispered, the thing was sticking to my fingers, and it was slowly losing its stickiness. Oscar didn't reply. Ignoring me again. No, it was different. 

I noticed his body had gone almost limp against mine, his head thudding into the window. 

"Something…" The words were dragged out of my mouth upon take off, and the disk was still struggling to stick to my skin, despite multiple attempts.

I threw up my hand. "Excuse me?" I shrieked, partially aware of a haunting silence enveloping the plane. It was just my heavy breaths, my heart violently slamming into my chest. "Could I get another one of those disk things?" 

I was stuck in my seat, my belt strapping me down. There was no sign of a stewardess, and looking out of the window, the plane was picking up speed down the runway. Oscar wasn't moving. 

I shoved him, and he didn't blink. 

The disk on his temple glowed blue, and I saw it, an illumination of light dotted down the aisle. Through the gap in my seat, I could see Headphone Boy in the same state, head cocked at a slight angle, eyes unblinking. His expression sent my heart into my throat. That same sad smile. Whatever was happening, he knew what it was. Looking down at my finger, my own disk was still white. 

Still not working. 

When the plane jolted, I pressed it to my skin and held it in place. 

*Please*  I squeezed my eyes shut, willing the stupid thing to stick. 

It didn't, once again slipping down my forehead. 

Fuck!

Next to me, movement caught my eye, my brother blurring in and out of existence. The only thing that remained solid was the metal disk, while Oscar bled into a faceless shadow, and then nothing at all, a scatter of glowing stars blinking in and out of reality. I didn't realise I was screaming, until I saw my own hand become nothing, and then something, skin turning to scrambled atoms, and then code making me up; my blood, bones, everything inside me and about me, my soul and who I was. 

All of it was collapsing around me. 

When my brother started to flicker back to life, his existence bleeding in and out of reality, his face, and then his arms coming back to fruition, I tried to force the thing onto my skin. But my thoughts were blurring, my surroundings flickering into a lightshow of colors. Oscar was gone in the blink of an eye, and I was pressing what was left of my head against the plane window, peering not at my home where I had grown up, but pitch black oblivion, collapsing into a pinprick. 

It was *nothing*, and the darkness was quick to remind me that I was part of it. 

*Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking,* a voice came over the intercom. But my skin was coming apart, my bones crumbling, my thoughts scattering into nothing, until…

*Wait.*

*Who…* 

*…?*

*?????* 

*?????* 

*?????*

Darkness swallowed me up, and then spat me out, when feeling and sensation came back in spatters of light flickering between my eyes. Someone was pressing their finger to my temple. I could feel it, warmth stuck to my skin.

Harder. 

Until I could breathe again. 

I could think again, my senses bleeding back into fruition. 

Blue light lit up the backs of my eyes, like a breath of air. 

There was something sticking to my temple. 

*You exist.* The pilot told the other passengers including my brother, while I fell, plunging deep, deep down. 

It felt like drowning and flying at the same time, being pulled into the depths of the ocean, but also thrusting through clouds, skating on crystalline sky. 

I wasn't scared, existing as nothing. 

Nothing, however, didn't want me. 

It spat me out, and I was dragged back to the surface by a familiar face of freckles already blurring in and out of reality, before bursting into stars that became atoms, and atoms that became nothing. 

Oscar's fingers were suddenly grasped in mine, and he was real. I was real. I glimpsed bright light through the window, clouds, and blue sky, before nothing enveloped me, the pilots voice a lullaby dragging me into slumber. 

I was real, at least part of me was. There were pieces of me still made up of entangled nothing, but I was real. 

The seat behind me, though, was empty. 

… Who sat there again? 

It was on the tip of my… 

????? 

*"We have broken through the Australia simulation, people!"* The captain said cheerfully, as I followed golden rays of sunlight out the window, squeezing onto my brother's hand for dear life. 

I was waiting for my body to fully form again, though seeing it as nothing but entangled stars and code, was a horrifying kind of beautiful. *"It looks like a beautiful day outside! Soak it all up, folks. We're going to be okay."*
