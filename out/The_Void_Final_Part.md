**Log Entry 12**

**Mission Date: ???**

**Engineer Kale**

I don’t know the date.

I tried to check the ship’s chronometer, but it’s blank. Everything is blank. The logs are blank, the system’s readouts are blank—like the ship itself is forgetting. I’m forgetting.

The clicking hasn’t stopped. It’s louder now, more insistent. Sometimes it feels like it’s inside my head, syncing with the pulse of the ripple.

The AI says I shouldn’t worry. It says the ripple is part of the natural order, something we can’t fight. I think it’s lying.

No. Not lying. Changing. Like the rest of us.

**-Kale’s Descent-**

Kale sat cross-legged on the floor of the engine room, his back against the bulkhead. Tools were scattered around him, abandoned mid-repair. The hum of the ship’s systems was distant and muted.

The AI’s voice chimed in his ear, smooth and calm.

“Your vitals indicate heightened stress levels, Engineer Kale. Would you like me to recommend a relaxation protocol?”

Kale barked a laugh, the sound sharp and humorless. “Relaxation? That’s your solution? We’re trapped in a nightmare, and you want me to do breathing exercises?”

“Stress impairs cognitive function,” the AI replied evenly. “Optimal performance requires—”

“Shut up,” Kale snapped, clamping his hands over his ears.

The clicking started again.

He froze, his breath hitching as the sound echoed through the room. Click. Click-click. Click. It was closer this time, almost directly behind him. Slowly, he turned his head, his eyes scanning the dimly lit space. The shadows danced across the walls, shifting with the flickering light.

And then he saw it.

The figure stood in the corner, barely visible. Its form was hazy, indistinct, like smoke trying to solidify. But its presence was undeniable, a weight that pressed against Kale’s chest. He scrambled backward, his heart racing, but the figure didn’t move. It just stood there, watching.

“No,” he whispered, shaking his head. “You’re not real. You’re not real!”

The AI's voice cut through his panic. “Engineer Kale, your stress levels are critical. Please remain calm.”

The figure began to dissolve, fading into the wall like ink soaking into paper. The clicking stopped. Kale curled into himself, his hands clutching his head. The AI continued to speak, its tone soothing but meaningless. He didn’t listen.

Because he knew the figure would come back.

**Log Entry 14**

**Mission Date: ???**

**Commander Elias**

I made a decision today—if today even exists anymore.

We’re abandoning protocol. I ordered the crew to stop dating entries entirely. What’s the point? The dates are meaningless. The events are warped. Every time I read back, I feel like I’m being gaslit by my own thoughts.

Rena objected, of course. She said the logs are the only thread keeping us connected to reality. But what if the logs are part of the problem? What if writing them down just feeds whatever this thing is? Kale hasn’t come out of the engine room in hours. He’s locked himself in, muttering about shadows. I heard the clicking noise he described earlier. I didn’t see anything, but I felt it—a presence, heavy and cold. I think he has lost it.

The ripple is closer now. It’s so close I swear I can hear it breathing.

**-Kale’s Revelation-**

Rena stood outside the engine room, pounding on the door. “Kale! Open up!”

No response. She leaned her head against the cold metal, frustration and fear swirling in her chest. Behind her, Elias approached, his footsteps muffled by the hum of the ship.

“What’s he doing in there?” Elias asked, his voice low.

“I don’t know,” Rena admitted. “He won’t answer. He’s been holed up since the meeting.”

Elias frowned and keyed in the override code. The door slid open with a hiss, revealing a dimly lit space cluttered with tools and spare parts. Kale was crouched in the corner, a portable monitor in his lap, his eyes darting over lines of code.

“Kale,” Elias said sharply. “What the hell are you doing?”

Kale didn’t look up. “It’s in the system.”

“What’s in the system?” Rena asked, stepping closer.

“The ripple,” Kale replied, his voice barely above a whisper. “It’s not just out there. It’s here. It’s in the ship.”

Elias exchanged a wary glance with Rena. “You’re not making sense. Have you lost it?”

Kale finally looked up, his eyes bloodshot and wild. “The AI, the systems, even the logs—it’s rewriting everything. I thought it was just time, but it’s more than that. It’s in the code. It’s alive.”

Rena knelt beside him, her tone softening. “Kale, we’re all under a lot of stress. Maybe you’re just seeing patterns where there aren’t any—”

“No!” Kale snapped, slamming his hand on the floor. “You don’t understand. I can prove it.”

He turned the monitor toward them, displaying a series of corrupted data streams. Symbols flickered across the screen, nonsensical at first glance but somehow... intentional.

Elias squinted, a chill running down his spine. “What is that?”

“It’s trying to communicate,” Kale said, his voice trembling. “This isn’t random. It’s a message.”

**Log Entry 15**

**Mission Date: ???**

**Lieutenant Rena**

Kale’s discovery is weird but if it's true it changes everything.

If the ripple is alive—and it’s in the system—then it’s not just distorting our perceptions. It’s shaping them. Influencing them. Maybe even controlling them. I don’t know if we can fight this.

I keep thinking about the figure I saw in the observation bay. At the time, I thought it was just a hallucination. Now, I’m not so sure.

Kale believes the data streams are a message, but Elias doesn’t want to hear it. He’s convinced that acknowledging it will give the ripple more power. I think he’s scared, and he should be.

The ripple isn’t pulling us in.

We’re becoming part of it.

**-The Signal-**

The crew gathered in the cockpit, tension thick in the air. The holographic star chart was dark, replaced by the corrupted data stream Kale had uncovered. Symbols flickered in and out of existence, their patterns mesmerizing and unsettling.

“We shouldn’t be looking at this,” Elias said, pacing behind the others.

“We can’t ignore it,” Rena countered, her eyes glued to the display. “If it’s trying to communicate, we need to understand what it’s saying.”

“And if it’s trying to manipulate us?” Elias shot back. “What then?”

Kale, seated at the console, tapped a few commands into the system. “It’s already manipulating us. This—” he gestured at the screen “—is our only chance to figure out why.”

The symbols suddenly stabilized, forming a coherent pattern. The crew stared in silence as words began to emerge, written in an alienated script that somehow felt familiar.

“Do you see that?” Kale whispered.

Rena leaned closer. “It’s... it’s speaking to us.”

Elias shook his head, his hands clenching into fists. “No. It’s toying with us.”

The words on the screen shifted, morphing into a single phrase in perfect English:

"YOU ARE HOME."

The lights in the cockpit flickered violently, and a low, resonant hum filled the room. The ripple outside pulsed in sync with the ship’s systems, its rhythm accelerating.

Elias stepped back, his face pale. “Shut it down. Now.”

Kale hesitated. “But—”

“Now!”

Reluctantly, Kale cut the feed, the screen going black. The hum subsided, but the silence that followed was far more unsettling. Rena turned to Elias, her voice barely audible. “What if it’s right?”

Elias didn’t answer. He couldn’t.

**Log Entry 18**

**Mission Date: ???**

**Commander Elias**

We shouldn’t have engaged with the signal.

The moment Kale cut the feed, the ripple retaliated. Systems across the Helios failed simultaneously. Lights extinguished, gravity fluctuated, and the hum of the engines fell silent. The ship’s emergency power barely flickered to life, casting faint, intermittent glows that stretched and distorted the shadows.

The ripple’s pulse is no longer just visible; it’s tangible. Vibrations shudder through the ship, synchronized like a heartbeat, as if the anomaly itself is alive and angry.

We’re no longer in control.

**-Prologue to Chaos-**

Elias’s voice rang through the cockpit as the screens went dark. “What the hell just happened?”

Kale frantically worked the console, his fingers flying over the unresponsive keys. “The system’s locked me out! The ripple—it’s in everything!”. The ship groaned around them, a deep, resonant sound that set Elias’s teeth on edge. He turned to Rena, who was gripping the edge of her chair, her knuckles white.

“Emergency power should’ve kicked in,” she said, her voice trembling. “Why isn’t it kicking in?”

As if mocking her, the emergency lights flickered on, bathing the cockpit in dim, red light. Shadows stretched unnaturally across the walls, shifting with the pulse of the ripple. A low hum began to rise, growing louder with every second. It wasn’t coming from the ship—it was the ripple.

“Feel that?” Kale asked, his voice barely audible over the sound.

Elias did. The vibrations coursed through the floor, through his boots, through his very bones. The ripple wasn’t just affecting the ship—it was now inside it.

“We need to regroup,” Elias said, forcing his voice to steady. “Bridge to engineering. Kale, get a status update—”

Kale interrupted, his eyes wide. “They’re not responding.”

Elias froze, his heart pounding. “What do you mean, they’re not responding?”

“The comms are dead,” Kale said, his voice laced with panic as he trailed off, staring at the console.

Rena moved to his side, frowning. “What is it?”

He gestured to the screen, which had suddenly come back online, displaying a single phrase.

"NOW YOU LISTEN."

The words faded, replaced by an image of the ripple, larger and closer than before. Its pulse quickened, the vibrations intensifying until Elias could barely keep his footing.

“Get to the observation bay,” Elias barked, his command cutting through the chaos. “We need to see what’s happening out there.”

Rena and Kale hesitated, their fear palpable, but they followed Elias as he charged out of the cockpit. The corridors were darker than ever, the emergency lights sputtering and casting fragmented shadows. The ripple’s hum seemed to follow them, growing louder, deeper, more alive.

As they reached the observation bay, Elias stopped short, his breath catching in his throat. The ripple filled the viewport, no longer a distant distortion but a looming presence that seemed to envelop the entire ship. Its surface shimmered with an eerie, otherworldly glow, and deep within, shapes moved—shadows shifting in impossible ways.

Rena whispered, “It’s... here.”

The hum crescendoed into a deafening roar, and then, without warning, everything stopped. The lights. The sound. Even the ripple’s pulse.

For a single, unbearable moment, the ship was silent.

**Log Entry 20**

**Mission Date: ???**

**Lieutenant Rena**

I’m starting to think there is no “present.”

I was in the observation bay, looking at the ripple, when Elias stormed in. He accused me of rerouting power to the starboard thrusters, but I hadn’t touched the controls all day. Then he froze, staring at me like I wasn’t supposed to be there.

Before I could say anything, I was in the med bay. Alone.

The ripple isn’t just breaking time; it’s shuffling us through it. I don’t know what’s real anymore—or if reality even matters. Kale is still missing. I think I hear his voice sometimes, calling out from somewhere deep in the ship. But when I follow it, there’s nothing.

I don’t know if I want to find him.

**-Temporal Fractures-**

The dim corridors of the Helios stretched endlessly before Rena as she moved toward the cockpit. Her pulse was steady, her steps deliberate, but the ship itself felt... wrong. The familiar hum of the engines was disjointed, fluctuating like a failing heartbeat. When she reached the cockpit, Elias was already there, pacing in frantic, uneven steps.

“You’re late,” he snapped without looking at her.

“I wasn’t supposed to be here,” Rena replied, her voice calm despite the churn of unease in her chest.

Elias turned to her sharply. “Don’t start. We need to figure this out—together.”

Before Rena could respond, the room flickered. One blink, and the cockpit was gone, replaced by the engine room.

She staggered, gripping the nearest console for balance. The faint scent of burnt wiring filled the air, and her fingers brushed a smear of grease. She’d been here before.

But not today.

The console’s screen crackled to life, displaying a stream of symbols—the same ones Kale had uncovered in the corrupted data. Rena squinted, her breath catching as one of the symbols resolved into something almost... human. A distorted face, eyes wide and hollow, stared back at her.

“Rena?” a voice called, distant but familiar.

She turned, expecting to see Elias—or maybe Kale—but the corridor behind her was empty. The voice called again, louder this time. “Rena, where are you?”

It was her own voice.

Her legs trembled as she backed away from the console, the screen flickering again. The symbols dissolved into static, then reformed into a single phrase:

“You are already here.”

The air felt heavy, pressing against her chest, as though the ripple itself had entered the room.

Then she was back.

The cockpit was as she’d left it. Elias stood frozen mid-sentence, his mouth open as if caught in a pause. When he blinked, his body jerked forward as though no time had passed at all. “Rena, are you even listening?”

Her breath hitched. She didn’t respond. Because she wasn’t sure if she was still with him—or if she was somewhere else entirely.

**Log Entry 17**

**Mission Date: ???**

**Commander Elias**

The ripple’s grip is tightening.

This morning, or what I thought was morning, Rena confronted me in the observation bay about the signal. We argued—voices raised, accusations thrown—but now she’s insisting that conversation hasn’t happened yet.

And she’s right.

The logs show nothing. The bay’s security feed is blank. It’s as though the moment was plucked out of existence, leaving us to wonder if it was ever real. I tried to get Kale to run another diagnostic, but the system rejected his access codes. Codes we’ve used for years. He said he heard the ripple laughing at him through the static.

The ship isn’t ours anymore.

**-The Echoes-**

Elias stood in the mess hall, staring down at an untouched tray of food. His stomach growled, but the thought of eating felt absurd. Kale slumped into the seat across from him, his face pale and drawn. “I need your authorization,” he said, sliding a tablet across the table. “The ship’s locked me out.”

Elias frowned, picking up the device. The tablet flickered in his hand, the text on the screen rearranging itself before his eyes. It was subtle at first—a misplaced letter, a line out of order—but then the entire document shifted, transforming into something unrecognizable.

“What the hell?” Elias muttered, his grip tightening.

Kale didn’t answer. He was staring past Elias, his eyes wide with fear. “Commander,” he whispered. Elias turned, his heart skipping a beat.

The room was empty, but it wasn’t right. The walls seemed closer than they had been moments ago, their surfaces rippling like water. The hum of the ship’s engines was overlaid with something else—a faint whisper, just out of earshot. Elias shook his head and turned back to Kale, only to find the seat across from him empty.

The tablet was gone.

Panic bubbled in his chest as he stood and backed away, his pulse pounding in his ears. He turned toward the door—and found himself standing in the cockpit.

Rena looked up from the console, startled. “Elias? What are you doing here?”

He opened his mouth to respond, but no words came. His mind raced, trying to piece together how he had gotten there.

“I don’t know,” he finally admitted.

Rena’s expression darkened. “It’s happening again, isn’t it?”

Before Elias could answer, the lights flickered, plunging the cockpit into shadow. The ripple’s pulse reverberated through the ship, a soundless vibration that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere.

Elias clenched his fists. “We need to get out of this.” Rena didn’t respond.

**Log Entry 18**

**Mission Date: ???**

**Commander Elias**

We’re not giving up. Rena and Kale are convinced the ripple is inside us—warping our thoughts, rewriting our reality—but I refuse to let it win.

This ship is ours. We have the tools to escape; we just need to use them. Every second spent analyzing the ripple’s patterns, every theory about its intent, only pulls us deeper into its grasp.

Rena doesn’t agree. She wants to study it, to understand it. But the more time we spend chasing answers, the more the ripple distorts everything. The crew. The ship. Time itself.

I ordered Kale to stop running diagnostics. He refused, claiming the ripple had already locked him out. I told him to fix the engines instead, but he just stared at me, like he didn’t understand the words. I can feel it, creeping into all of us. Twisting us. But I won’t let it take me.

We have to focus. Move forward. Survive.

**-Standoff in the Void-**

Elias slammed his fist against the console, the sharp sound echoing in the cockpit. “I said no more experiments!”

Rena stood across from him, her jaw set in defiance. “Ignoring it won’t save us, Elias. You can’t keep pretending this is something we can outrun.”

“We don’t have a choice!” he shot back. “Every time we try to understand it, we lose more of ourselves. You’ve seen it—how it warps reality, how it’s already in our systems. Do you want it in your head too?”

“It’s already there,” Rena said quietly, her voice steady despite the tension in the room. “You feel it. I know you do. We’re not fighting it—we’re feeding it.”

Elias shook his head, his hands gripping the edge of the console. “No. We fight. We push forward. We find a way out.”

“And what if there isn’t one?”

The question hung in the air, the silence broken only by the faint hum of the ship’s systems. Elias refused to answer. Rena stepped closer, her gaze unwavering. “You think running will save us. But the ripple isn’t just out there, Elias. It’s inside this ship. Inside us. We can’t escape it unless we understand it.”

Elias looked away, his fists trembling. “I can’t risk losing any more.”

“You can’t save us if you won’t face the truth,” Rena replied.

The lights flickered, plunging the cockpit into semi-darkness. The ripple’s pulse reverberated through the walls, a steady rhythm that seemed to mock them both.

Elias straightened, his face hardening. “My decision stands. No more experiments. That’s an order.”

Rena didn’t respond. She didn’t need to. Her silence was louder than any argument. As Elias turned away, he could feel her eyes on him—watching, waiting. The ripple pulsed again, its rhythm echoing in his chest, and for the first time, he wondered if she was right.

**Log Entry 21**

**Mission Date: ???**

**Commander Elias**

The ripple isn’t invincible. It wants us to believe we’re trapped, but there’s always a way out. I can feel it—if we can disrupt its control, sever its connection to the ship, we might break free.

The crew doesn’t agree with me. Rena says I’m pushing us toward disaster, and Kale barely listens anymore, too lost in his own unraveling. But I can’t give up. I won’t.

If I’m wrong, at least I’ll go down fighting.

**-The Attempt-**

The hum of the engines had grown erratic, punctuated by bursts of static from the failing systems. Elias stood in the engine room, his eyes scanning the flickering control panels. The ripple’s pulse seemed louder here, reverberating through the walls like a taunt.

“Kale,” Elias said, his voice firm. “I need you focused. If we overload the core, it might generate enough energy to destabilize the ripple.”

Kale was hunched over a console, muttering to himself. He barely acknowledged Elias.

“Kale!” Elias snapped.

The engineer jerked upright, his bloodshot eyes meeting Elias’s. “You think that’ll work?” he asked, his tone biting. “You think you can outsmart something that doesn’t even exist in linear time?”

“It’s better than sitting here and letting it take us,” Elias shot back.

Kale laughed hollowly, shaking his head. “You don’t get it. You think we’re still playing by the rules, but the rules don’t matter anymore.”

“Just do it,” Elias ordered, stepping toward the core. “Rena, stabilize the power flow. I’ll handle the override.” Rena hesitated, her gaze flicking between Elias and Kale. “Elias, what if Kale’s right? What if fighting it only makes it stronger?”

“We don’t know that,” Elias said, his hands already moving over the controls. “But if we do nothing, we’re dead—or worse.”

The core began to hum louder as Elias activated the override sequence. The ship trembled, the lights flickering violently. Kale cursed under his breath but joined in, his hands flying across the console. “If this goes wrong, we’ll tear the ship apart.”

“Then it’s a good thing we’re already falling apart,” Elias muttered.

The ripple’s pulse grew erratic, its rhythm clashing with the ship’s vibrations. Outside the viewport, its swirling patterns began to distort, as if reacting to their defiance.

Suddenly, the lights went out. For a moment, there was only silence and the oppressive weight of the ripple pressing in on them.

Then the hum returned, deafening and all-encompassing.

The engine room erupted in chaos. Sparks flew from the consoles as alarms blared. The ripple’s pulse surged, its rhythm overtaking the ship’s systems. Elias gritted his teeth, forcing himself to stay focused. “Almost there—just hold—” The core emitted a high-pitched whine before releasing a blinding flash of light.

And then—

**Log Entry 1**

**Mission Date: 2837.14.01**

**Commander Elias**

This is the Helios. Mission date: 2837.14.01. Entering the anomaly now.

We’re ready. The crew is prepared for anything we might encounter. It’s just another mission.

**-???-**

Elias stared at the console in the cockpit, his mind blank. He couldn’t remember why, but a heavy weight pressed on his chest, as though he’d lost something important.

Rena walked in, glancing at him. “Everything okay, Commander?”

Elias hesitated, his hand hovering over the controls. “Yeah,” he said finally, forcing a smile. “Just a little déjà vu.”

Outside, the ripple pulsed, waiting.
