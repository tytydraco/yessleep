A few weeks ago, my Israeli friend—let’s call him Eliav—did something simple that shook me in a way I can’t explain.

He took off his glasses.

His piercing blue eyes, suddenly naked and sharp, met mine—ice-cold, unblinking. I froze. My whole body trembled, and I started muttering to myself in Mandarin, “天啊，太可怕了…” (God, this is terrifying).

He frowned. “Angel, get over yourself,” he said dryly.

But his eyes—those eyes—reminded me of Leon Trotsky’s in those old portraits: intelligent, defiant, but somehow cursed.

That night, I had a dream.

Eliav, my boyfriend Antonio, my best friend Alexa, and I were inside the Kremlin. The hallways were endless and drenched in a strange red glow. On the walls hung massive portraits—Stalin, Trotsky, Grace Kelly, Henry Kissinger—watching us as Swan Lake played faintly from somewhere far away, the violins echoing like ghosts.

Eliav stood before Trotsky’s portrait. The painting seemed to breathe. As he stared, his skin began to wrinkle, his hair turned white, and before my eyes he transformed into an old man.

Antonio stepped toward Stalin’s portrait—his face hardened, his jawline aged, his youth drained away. Alexa wandered toward Grace Kelly and Henry Kissinger, and the light shifted—her reflection in the golden frame flickered, showing her face changing with each note of the ballet.

Then—Antonio shoved Eliav down the grand staircase. His body shattered into a pile of bones that clattered across the marble.

Alexa gasped and stumbled backward, uncovering a hidden compartment behind one of the walls. Inside was an old black-and-white photo of my maternal grandpa when he was twenty-six, wearing his PLA uniform. On the back was a handwritten note:

 “我们不一定需要男孩子来当领导，女孩子照样可以当不错的领导。”
 "We don’t necessarily need boys to be leaders. Girls can be great leaders too."

Before I could process it, my *paternal grandma* appeared out of the shadows, her voice soft but urgent:
“孩子，快走。” 

She handed Alexa a golden apple. Alexa ran toward the window, leapt—and a black swan swooped beneath her just in time, carrying her away. In the distance, a red swan flew over the water, dropping bright red berries—czerwone jagody—as a Polish folk song began to play.

Then I woke up.

The next morning, I met up with Eliav for coffee. I couldn’t look him in the eyes. I even dressed up—bougie, like Audrey Hepburn—with a dress and sunglasses, trying to look like someone untouched by nightmares.

Eliav was particular as always—about his food, his clothes, his cologne... and maybe, I realized uneasily, his women.

He let me sip his coffee. Later, we shared a drink using one straw.

And as I tasted the mix of caffeine and his cologne, I caught a glimpse of his reflection in the café window.

For a second, he looked like Trotsky again.

And I swear—he winked. 

Today, we hung out and grabbed a whole pizza. He insisted that he got it. After we sat down, he and I shared airpods and watched gilmore girls together. After an hour or so, he had to go. He requested for a hug. His cologne was quite strong and after he let go, it was lingering on my clothes.
