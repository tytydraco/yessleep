My name is Joy Allen. I'm a night owl, just like my co-workers (and friends), Isaac Lam and Brandy Delisle. We live in a small town, so most nights are super slow. Well, *were*. I don't know what the hell is going on, or what I believe; I just want it to stop.

-

So, like the title told you, freaky shit has started happening. To be precise, it started happening 8 days ago.

-

It's around 9 PM, and I'm doing a shift with Isaac. I usually work the till while Isaac cleans. Why? Because I'm... more palatable, so to speak. Isaac's got a wickedly deadpan sense of humor that he just loves to spring on our poor, unknowing customers like a damned bear trap. It's definitely hilarious, but I don't want him to get fired, you know? And I really don't want to drive away what little "business" we get. I like‚Äîwell, *liked*‚Äîworking here.

-

I watch Isaac as he finishes mopping up slushie vomit someone's kid egested onto the floor. "Enjoying yourself?"

-

"Mhmm," he replies. "Cleaning up stomach acid flavored with artificial sweetener is my favorite. Try it some time, it's great fun."

-

My lips curl into a smirk. "I'll take your word fo‚Äî"

###ùêíùêåùêÄùêÇùêä

I jump as something hits the window to my left, hard. Immediately, I turn to look at what the hell had just taken 2 years off my life. There's a small crack in the glass at the point of impact, but the counter is obstructing my view of the ground outside.

-

"Can you see what that was?" I ask Isaac. I'm a bit spooked. If it's some odd, small-town crackhead, I won't be able to take him. I'm a slim, 5' 3" woman with absolutely zero knowledge of any sort of combat, aside from putting my keys between my fingers or whatever it is braver women do.

-

"Hate me that much, huh?" Isaac says. Still, he plants the mop in the bucket and makes his way to the door, taking a brief, cautious glance around the parking lot before stepping outside. I watch him approach whatever is on the ground, feeling goosebumps dot my arms when the door swings shut and blows cold April air on me.

-

Isaac's expression is unreadable as he looks down, which doesn't tell me much. He's quite the stoic, so for all I know, it could be something rather grievous.

-

I rap on the glass and yell, "What is it? A bag of fingers?"

-

Isaac shoots me a quick glance before looking around the parking lot again. Then he bends down, picks up the object, and power walks back inside.

-

"What is it?" I ask again. Instead of responding, Isaac turns away and fumbles with the mysterious package in his hands.

-

I stare at him, slightly uneasy, awaiting his response.

-
-
-
-

It feels like actual minutes pass before he says, "The fuck?"

-

His voice is calm. I'm expecting a joke about how it really is a bag of fingers before he turns around to show me a rock. But he doesn't say anything else. He just keeps looking at whatever's in his hands.

-

"What *is* it?" I say again. "Isaac?"

-
-
-
-

A moment of silence, and then he finally acknowledges me. "It... it's a... I... don't think you want to see this. Why the..."

-

"I want to see it," I say, feeling a pit form in my stomach. *This could still be a joke*. No... I don't really believe that. The guy's deadpan humor is convincing, but this feels different.

-

Isaac says nothing. He doesn't move.

-
-
-
-
-

After maybe 10 seconds, he starts fumbling with the object again. Growing antsy, I watch him for just a few moments before speaking up. "What the hell are you doing?"

-

"Here," he says. His voice is quieter than usual. He turns around and shows me what's in his hands.

-

It's a burlap sack. Small, no bigger than the palm of my hand. Tied at the top with a bit of rope. And it's soaked with what appears to be blood.

-

"What the fuck?" I exclaim, recoiling a bit. "Is it... it's not actually a fuckin' bag of fingers, is it?"

-

Isaac places the sack on the counter. "It's a dead bird."

-

An awful coldness runs through my veins. "It... what... are you serious? Is this a bit?"

-

Isaac stares at me. His face betrays nothing, but his amber eyes are more intense than usual.

-

I look away, back down at the sack. Someone killed a bird, put it in a tiny sack, tied it up, and threw it at the fucking window. Hard.

-

My eyes dart to the clock. 9:06. Isn't shit like this only supposed to happen during the *spooky* hours? Like, past midnight? It hasn't even been 45 minutes since the sky turned black.

-

I bite my lip. "We should call the police."

-

"No," Isaac says immediately. "This is... this is *interesting*, Joy. Something *interesting* is happening in this fucking hick town."

-

I shake my head and sigh. "You're... ugh. God... you know, I'm not even surprised. You love this shit."

-

"Joy..."

-

"Isaac, we could be in danger. You're aware of that, right? People don't just throw sacks with fucking dead birds in them at gas station windows hard enough to crack the glass. I mean, sane people don't, at least."

-

Isaac held my gaze. "Joy‚Äî"

-

"No. Stop." I raise my hands. "We're calling the cops."

-

"Fuck, Joy, please," Isaac says. He's... begging? That's... extremely uncharacteristic. I stare at him.

-

"You're right, I absolutely love this shit," he continues. "I can't remember the last time I was this... excited. Joy. Let me worry about this. All right? No one and nothing will hurt you. I'll make very sure of that. It's probably just some crackhead Brandy and Ricky brought back from one of their little adventures."

-

A small smile finds its way onto my face. "*Your* adventures. Don't act like you don't partake in that shit."

-

"Occasionally," Isaac says. "We're rarely off at the same time."

-

I exhale loudly and exaggeratedly. "God, I wish we had some blinds."

-

"Stop worrying about it." Isaac comes around the counter and stands close behind me. "I'll work the till tonight. Next to the scary window."

-

I shake my head. "Am I seriously letting you talk me into‚Äî"

###ùêíùêåùêÄùêÇùêä

"FUCK!" I shout. Thinking I might be the second person to vomit here tonight, I shimmy past Isaac, away from the counter. I feel a primal, self-preservative need to be as far away from that window as possible.

-

Then, just to make things worse, Isaac starts heading for the door.

-

"Don't go out there!" I shout. I'm scared that if he does, something very bad will happen to him. I don't know what, specifically. But something. Something.

-

"I'm just seeing what it is," Isaac replies. "I'm not going out to get it. Take a breath, Joy."

-

"No, please," I beg, but evidently, my words are falling on deaf ears. I watch helplessly as Isaac opens the door and leans outside, craning his neck to take a look at what was probably another dead bird in a bag. I stare into his blind spot, countless tiny sparks dancing in the darkness.

-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-

"Fucking get back in!" I whisper-yell. I'm so close to running up and tugging him inside by his shirt.

-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-

Finally, he leans back and closes the door. Then he takes out his key and locks it.

-

"Go to the break room," he orders.

-

Now I'm really about to puke. "Why? What is it?"

-

Isaac places his hands on my shoulders and turns me around. "It's a fucking human tongue."
