I have to tell someone about this.

Not because I feel particularly guilty, though there were times when I did- moments of weakness where I felt as if my existence itself was a mistake on a cosmic scale. But rather, because I feel that if I don’t, this story will be wasted.

This story will join me on my deathbed, as I choke on some tepid hospital food and watch the mountains on the monitors turn into flat roads taking me down to hell.

And I would hate for this story to be wasted like that.

I think that someone needs to know it.

Do you?

 

A few years ago, I lived in a detached house at the end of a road, surrounded by enormous trees. Those houses went cheap, you understand — too far from the city for most people.

Not that it bothered me, I could handle the commute, enjoy myself and continue my hobbies without every haggard IT worker and their screaming children worming their way into my life. And the ‘undesirable’ location meant that I got a huge two-floor house, with under-floor heating, a large wooden attic and basement, alongside the greenest garden you would have ever seen.

Of course, as I worked on the garden, it gradually lost that vibrant green colour and became a mess of piles of dirt: seeing as I didn’t exactly want to make it into a beautiful lush paradise and, to be truthful, I didn’t have the greatest green fingers on my soft, sterilised hands.

But this doesn’t matter, what matters is that there were these huge trees in my garden, covering all of this small corner of solace in shade and privacy. Often in windy days and nights the branches of these trees would stretch towards my conservatory door, scratching and scratching- forever desiring to get inside.

By my second year of living in the house, the sounds of these pervasive branches faded into the back of my mind, lost in the hum of my work and the power tools I used in my free time.

I enjoyed working with them- crafting raw material into something new, it’s so chaotic but I love it enough to enjoy the mess and chaos of the process as well.

The day the thing I’d like to talk to you about happened was a chilly November evening, I had come back from a long night’s work- extended by the train journey, busy, loud and hateful-  I only wished to go home and sleep, undisturbed.

I think you can imagine that that wouldn’t happen tonight.

I walked for a good twelve minutes to my house, dodging the trash littered about the street and looking around at the houses- all full, all lively, seeing as it was a Friday night.

There were silhouettes painted on the window, faceless and two-dimensional. I stopped at one and looked at its windows. They were partying.

They lived in a different world to mine, I realised (not for the first time in my life) that they were in a different world- they might as well have been a different species to me. They cared about their relationships, they wanted the best for their fellow man; I was lonely, I doubted I would ever have any real friend or connections.

I’ll admit that I was so full of myself and my angst that I cursed under my breath at this sight.

And then I wished, deep in my mind, that some of them would come to my house.

Yes. Mister Well-Adjusted and Cool, I know.

But I’ve changed.

I hope.

Anyway, as I moved past that house and another, I lost count of these generic buildings, shrouded with curtains and filled with people who would never know who I was.

I counted the numbers on the doors, eventually casting my eyes to the ground when I got a rhythm into my head of when one house of strangers ended and when another began.

68.

70.

72.

74.

84.

86.

8-

80, that was my house.

I stepped past it, in a trance state from the endless pattern of the sidewalk- getting halfway down the hill that my house was situated in until I realised that my lone, imposing monolith of a house was now behind me.

I think that if I had just stopped at my house- just noticed that my empty, loveless home was in front of me- he wouldn’t have seen me.

Just as I began to walk back, I saw the man.

He was standing in the front yard of a house that had its lights off.

A shade of darkness in a greater darkness still.

He seemed to be holding a sprinkler, holding it forward.

I’d seen people on social media who preached about this, about how at night, the plants would absorb the water more efficiently… or something.

He seemed like a strange guy, not that I could comment but-

It wasn’t connected to a tap.

He seemed to be holding it as if the mere idea of water would sustain the grass in front of the house.

I stared at him.

He stared not at me but my house.

This is hypocritical of me, I know, but I don’t like people looking at my house: I guess other people have personal lives that just don’t matter, as such- nothing would happen if I looked in their window and saw them watching TV or whatever. But this guy couldn’t just stare at my house like that, what if he saw me doing something that was personal?

Weirdo.

I moved forward to my door, taking out my keys and shaking my sleeve up in the air to signal to the man that maybe it was time to stop watching my house.

Slowly, I inserted the key and turned it, holding down the handle- to find it jammed. I rushed into the door, pushing against it until it opened, leaving me turning on my excess momentum.

On the other side of the street, the man was gone.

The sprinkler lay forgotten, the house’s lights were still off and the house’s door remained perfectly closed.

Did the guy even live there?

A little confused, I walked into my house and pushed my door shut.

Maybe I’m paranoid. I waited for a few minutes, half-expecting someone to bang on the door with a gun or a knife. Nothing came.

I let out a deep breath; nonetheless, I locked the door to my basement and both conservatory door and the double checked the door to the attic. That was what I did every day, I didn’t want anyone breaking into my house- more than the idea of theft, I hated the possibility that they would poke their nose into my business, taking away my privacy. Until then, I thought that this was enough.

I know now that it was not.

I went to sleep at eleven- reassured that I could sleep in as late as I wished.   
As I idly leapt over my plans for tomorrow, or lack of plans, and my daydreams were replaced with much more frenetic, faded dreams.

I saw visions of my garden, my inaesthetic mounds of dirt waiting to sprout flowers, sights of all those encounters I had had late at night, including this one.

Though in this state of limbo between reality and madness, the man with the sprinkler was out in the open, in front of some endless, warped tower block. His face looked fake- as if it was made out of generic shapes smashed together to make an altogether unnerving composite whole. I stared at the man in my dream for a long time and then, I looked down.

There, on the floor, there was a knife, waiting for me to pick it up- almost calling me. I turned my eyes back up and the man charged.

I only remember this because this was when I woke up.

One of the branches had scratched the downstairs window particularly hard.

Normally, I wouldn’t be woken up by this but I assume the stress of seeing that man looking at my house, watching, and the absurdity of that dream hadn’t exactly helped to keep my mind confined to dreams and slumber.

I got out of bed with a jump, as if there was something I needed to do right then.

As if it was a matter of life and death.

I couldn’t feel the cold.

I could only hear that scratching.

Yet it sounded different.

Were those branches?

I slowly tiptoed down the stairs, painfully aware of every creak that the carpeted floor handed out in complaint of my movement and wished that I had a baseball bat, as both the kitchen and basement were too far away from me for me to get any real weapon.

I took in a deep breath and let it out, I could handle this, I had handled bigger things, worse people and I wasn’t going to die tonight, not tonight, I had so much to do, so many people to meet. I wasn’t meant to be the guy dying.

Something told me that Fate hadn’t intended for me to be the guy dying.

I calmed myself.

Whenever I watched horror movies as a child, I’d always come up with logical steps to escape any situation, yet I never expected that I’d be on this side of the big screen. I had always muttered to myself how *I* would have survived or, more often than not, how I would have killed all the annoying teenagers. Yet, now, my mind came up blank.

I could jump out of the window and run, I supposed.

But then what if someone came into my house and searched it, or what if he waited here and…

I took another step on the staircase, turning the corner to the landing.

Slowly, I stepped down and headed down the hallway.

Through the kitchen.

Turned the key to the conservatory.

Turned the knob.

Opened the door.

And nothing.

It was just the branches.

Swaying and hitting the windows to some gleeful beat.

No one was there.

I would love to tell you that was the end.

That I laughed it off and went back to my hobbies in my own privacy without anyone bothering me.

That I met the guy and his name was Paul, or something, and I included him in my hobby group and we became close acquaintances.

That I locked the kitchen door,  went back to sleep and that was the end of that.

But I woke up a second time that night.

I went to sleep and dreamt of fun and games, by my standards- anyhow, and was in the middle of a game with my colleagues when I heard the sound.

It sounded like a tinkling of chimes and then the sound of a dog wailing, there were thuds downstairs, drumbeats that were followed by mewling sounds.

I got out of bed.

I walked down the stairs quicker now and I walked into the kitchen.

There was the marking of a face on the kitchen door’s pane of glass, the kind that you make as a kid on a bus drive: the kind that comes when you lean on glass and just breathe on it for a long while.

I opened the kitchen drawer and took out a knife.

I don’t think I even questioned what I was doing.

It felt right.

It felt calming, it reassured me that I could make it out of this.

It was natural, just like the tools in the basement.

This is just another tool.

This is just like another project.

Yes, I was still in control here, still in my zone of expertise.

Walking over to the door, I turned the key and opened it.

From the kitchen, I couldn’t see him.

Now, I could.

There, crouching in the corner of the room, holding a piece of shattered glass- most likely coming from the broken conservatory door- and looking at me, wide-eyed and grinning, was a man.

The man sat there for a few seconds, as I regarded him and he regarded me.

He saw the knife.

I looked at the shard of glass.

He nodded, as if he acknowledged me.

He got up slowly and moved towards me, I didn’t flinch or cower back- transfixed by this peculiar man.

He moved as if he was dancing the hokey-cokey, hands in front of him.

He stank, his shirt was practically just a thin film of fabric smeared in a much thicker layer of dirt and what seemed like mud.

There were rolls of flesh on his forehead and every time he smiled two ripples of fat dove across his face.

He wouldn’t stop smiling.

He seemed to be salivating, licking his lips and whispering something under his breath every few steps that he took.

His steps were also comically exaggerated, he walked on tiptoes, covering the tiniest of distances.

When he got a few steps away from me he regarded me with some semblance of childish wonder, gawping and opening his mouth,

“Oh-ho.”

He raised his hands to his mouth, like a wife from the 1950s admitting she had made a surprise for her dear, precious husband.

I lodged the knife into his stomach.

I didn’t get a chance to pull it out, as he had jumped off it- leaving the knife, bloodied, in my hand and a hole in the stomach.

The man doubled over and began to shriek, not scream, just shriek, like some strange animal you’d find in a dark field.

Slowly, with betrayal written in his eyes, he pushed himself off the ground.

He charged at me.

I turned to run; the kitchen door was closed, I turned the doorknob; he was on top of me, yelling and hitting my head with his fists, which felt strangely moist.

I raised the knife over my shoulder, nicking the nape of my neck, and stabbed him in the head.

Once.

Twice.

He let go, rubbing his hands on his head, as if that would fix it.

Some part of my mind chimed up and overlayed an illustration of Humpty Dumpty over the bald, writhing man with a variety of holes in his head.

To be fair, my head was ringing from his percussion-themed attack on my head, that idiot.

Thoughts ran through my head.

I just needed to get to the basement.

I would be safe in the basement.

I couldn’t die in the basement.

I turned the doorknob and entered the kitchen, closing the door firmly behind me.

I dragged myself out of the kitchen, towards my place of rest- the basement.

I heard a muffled cry of anger, then a crash and then that same cry of anger, resumed and amplified.

Desperately, I turned, the thing had managed to crash through my kitchen door’s window.

I dully wondered how much money that would cost.

He ran at me.

I saw the shard of glass in his hand move and I moved my hand up.

His transparent, jagged weapon embedded itself in my palm and remained there.

He grinned at his victory.

I slashed my knife through the air.

A ribbon materialised on his throat; he moved back- still with a slight smirk.

I leapt on him.

I lost track of how many times I stabbed him.

In.

Out.

In.

I stopped when the knife hit bone and got lodged.

Only then did I regard what I had done.

Looking at the mess and mistake I had created.

He looked like a  fat, popped bug.

He did manage to gouge my arm with his little dagger of glass; ask his fingers and face and stomach and neck, they’ll tell you that I won.

I’m not sure when I called the police but it was after I wrapped his head in cellophane- just to make sure.

I was more scared when the police came, early that morning- or late that night, because the adrenaline from the night before had removed any fear I might have felt towards that grinning insanity plea; this was a calm, cold realisation in my gut.

That stupid man had ruined everything.

I was going to get arrested for murder.

They were going to slap on their handcuffs and take me to prison to rot.

It wasn’t my fault, I thought, as I sat on kitchen table- ignoring the suited officers swirling around me- he had broken into my house.

It wasn’t my fault, this time.

I should’ve buried him.

Why me?

Why did he pick my house?

I couldn’t go to jail.

Certainly not for him.

He had ruined everything.

Everything.

Once I calmed down enough, however, I was greeted with the fact that they had only figured out the self-defence part.

The police later told me the truth, or the official truth, five days prior, a man had fled a nearby sanatorium and broken into the house next to mine. He had killed the house’s owners- not at once, they said. Slowly. He had slowly taken them apart, styling their remains in the kitchen. This man hadn’t once turned on the lights in that house, he had stayed with his victims, or- rather- their remains, for three days. He had come outside and- who knows- liked the look of my house. He had broken in and… you know that now.

The rather sympathetic male officer placed a hand on shoulder, the other busy clutching a cup of coffee, and tried to reassure me,

“Don’t worry, he deserved it. Okay? You wouldn’t have been the first guy he tried to kill.  I know I’m meant to be impersonal and professional, but that sick freak deserved it.”

I suppose he did.

He did deserve it; there are so many who didn’t.

Little parts of them are in my basement, bigger bits in the garden.

Tiny smears of them left on my kitchen knives, that man joining them.

If that police officer came back with proper sniffer dogs (these ones don’t seem to catch the scent) and a large digger, maybe he’d realise that I ‘deserved it’ too.

There are power tools in my basement, do you know that?

And pretty sizeable bits of tarp and plastic.

All very useful.

I wish I hadn’t moved house- I feel like I left parts of myself, or- to be honest- them behind.

Maybe I wasn’t the first guy that creep tried to kill but he wasn’t anything special to me either.  
Not the first. Not the last.  
I’m on thirty-five now.  
And I think this story needed to be told.  
Do you?
