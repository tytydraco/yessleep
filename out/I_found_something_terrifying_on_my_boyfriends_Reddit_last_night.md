Hi Reddit,
I’m not really sure where to post this or even how to explain what I’m feeling right now. 
I’m honestly terrified. 

I feel like I’m living in some kind of nightmare and I don’t know who to talk to.

I’ve been dating this guy, Eli for just about a year now. We met at a comic book convention and I really hit it off. I’ve never had the best luck with relationships with lots of casual stuff, nothing that felt meaningful. But Eli was… different. Charming, funny, incredibly thoughtful. The kind of guy who just gets you.

There was one moment early on that really stuck with me. My dog had gone missing, and I was a complete mess. Eli showed up at my apartment uninvited but it felt comforting, not creepy. He brought me all my favorite things: blue tulips, vanilla flavored coffee, those red box Ghirardelli chocolates I always buy for myself when I’m sad. We just cried together. It felt so intimate, so real. I remember thinking, This is it. This is the person I’m supposed to be with.

Now I can’t stop thinking about how weird it was that he showed up so fast when I hadn’t posted about it or told anyone yet. He just knew. I thought it was so sweet.

But now I don’t know what to think. 

Because last night… I found his Reddit account.

He uses the same username everywhere. I don’t even know what I was looking for just being curious, I guess. He has a ton of karma (like 42k), and I spent a while scrolling through his post history. A lot of it was harmless nerdy stuff, sarcastic comments, some arguments on r/movies. 

Typical Eli.

But then I found a post from two years ago.

It was on r/offmychest. The title was something like

“I’ve been following a woman home every day. I watch her constantly. I feel like we’re destined to be together.”

I swear to God my heart stopped.

I clicked on it my hands were literally shaking and as I read, everything just… clicked. The way he described her. Where she lived. What she wore. Her job. Her apartment building. Her dog. It was me.
It was definitely me.

In the comments he talked about how he was planning to “bump into” her organically. He said he knew what kind of flowers to get. Someone mentioned how emotional vulnerability can be a way to build intimacy. He replied saying, 

“Tragedy brings people closer.”

And that’s when I thought about my dog.

My dog went missing under the weirdest circumstances. No broken gate, no signs of digging, nothing stolen, just… gone. And I remember thinking it was strange that he’d never wandered off before, not even once in five years.
Eli helped me search for him for hours that day. I cried, he held me, and he said

“Maybe this is the universe pulling us closer together.”

And now I can’t stop thinking that Eli did something to him. That it wasn’t an accident. That he made it happen just so he could be there for me.

He’s at work right now. I’m just sitting here in the apartment we share, staring at my laptop and feeling like I’m going to throw up. I don’t know what to do. I feel paralyzed. I want to run, but I’m scared. What if he’s watching me right now? What if he finds me?

I don’t even know if this is the right place to post this. I just needed someone to hear me

Wait…I think I found a camera.

Please..What do I do?
