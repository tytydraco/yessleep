This happened to me about 9 years ago. 

When I graduated highschool, I moved out into a small studio appartment two hours away from my hometown to go to college. 

A few months into living on my own, I watched a video about lucid dreaming and decided I'd give it a try. I would randomly ask myself "Am I dreaming?" during the day to try and trigger the same question while I was asleep and dreaming. This supposedly was meant to make me aware of my dream and be able to control it. 

A few weeks later, it works. 

I am now standing on water, holding a fireball which I shoot towards the sky. I then attempt to fly, laughing excitedly at my newfound dream powers.

Then it stops.

I am now laying on my bed unable to move a muscle. I try to move my legs or my arms to no success. I try to scream but my lips are frozen. All I seem to be able to move are my eyes. It felt like hours until I am finally able to move. I jump out of my bed screaming and call my best friend, a fellow night owl. I explain everything and he tells me it's most likely sleep paralysis which is comfirmed by a quick google search. 

I am terrified to go back to sleep but after a few hours of reading into it, I learn most people get this only once in their life. Much calmer now, I go back to sleep and a few days later i've forgotten about it.

Until it happens again.

Now I am not only completely paralyzed, but I am seeing hundreds of black butterflies that are, I kid you not, disappearing like pacman dies. It was extremely unsettling to watch this happening inside of my locked room. I wake up (around 3am) screaming and decide to just stay awake for tonight, too scared to go back to sleep.

This becomes a habit and I now sleep during the day when it's less scary.

A few weeks go by and it happens again. This time when I open my eyes, there is a wolf sitting on my chest, mouth wide open inches from my neck. I try to break free so hard but I am stucn on my bed, in my room, with a wolf on my chest about to kill me, until I wake up hyperventilating. 

This led to a very irregular sleep schedule and missed college classes for a couple of days until I managed to get my fear of sleeping under control. 

A couple of months go by. I am finally sleeping at night again, sleep schedule slowly returning to normal. I am confident now after a lot of reading about the subject and learning strategies to break free from it. I thought now I am free, then it happened again. 

I opened my eyes, stuck to my bed and, beside it stood a beast I can only describe as a taller, lankier big foot. Very similar to the beast titan of attack on titan (before I even watched the show). He was so tall he was phasing through the roof, like a glitch in a video game. It's arms were so long, it's clawed hands dragged on the floor as it walked around my room like it was looking for something. It 's fur was light brown and it's feet looked like a monkey's but with long claws. It felt like I was paralyzed forever there as It walked back and forth in my room. It finally disappeared and I thought i had broken free of the paralysis and was now awake.

But the beast walked out of my bathroom and started walking around my room again. Eventually I woke up hyperventilating and called my best friend once I calmed down, vowing to never sleep again. 

Now, the scariest part wasn't even the paralysis or hallucination or the fact i thought I was awake when i sawit again.

The scariest part was when I called my mom the next day and started to explain that I had gotten sleep paralysis again. I started to tell her how I saw a beast and, before I could even describe it, she described it to me exactly as I saw it.

My mom is a devout prothestant christian. She begins to tell me a story about how she saw the exact same beast while praying in church days before my sleep paralysis.

This shook me to the core. I had always gone to church with her but never really believed in more than I can see. Even something as paranormal feeling as sleep paralysis had a scientific explanation.

But this didn't.

I slept exclusively during the day for years after that and even had to quit college due to severe sleep deprivation. Regardless the sleep paralysis continued but it never shook me like that did.

There is another case where I saw a headless midget beside my bed which then jumped out the window. This happened three days after I moved into a new appartment. 

That one is scary because, this is an appartment i lived in for a short while and moved out. A year later I moved back to the same complex on another floor and, days later after moving in I saw the exact same headless midget jump out the window on another sleep paralysis episode.

Another episode of note was a dancing ghost. The rest have been all only paralysis with no hallucination.

All of this is a true story that I lived and have never been able to explain. 

Has anyone else seen the bigfoot during sleep paralysis?
