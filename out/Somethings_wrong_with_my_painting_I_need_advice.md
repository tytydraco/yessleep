Hi. My (fake) name is Charles (29, M). I’ve been an oil painter since I was a small child. I got my BA in Fine Arts after attending Goldsmiths University for 4 full-time years, then received a Master of Arts in Teaching after attending the School of Visual Arts for 2 years. I’ve been working as a high school art teacher for the past four years whilst creating my own work at home, specifically during the summertime. Some of my paintings have been in museums, but I’ve yet to find a gallery to showcase my current series as of writing this. 

All this is to say that I’ve been a professional artist my whole life, and this weird crap has never happened to me before. It started right before I had a studio visit today, where a few representatives from different galleries came and toured the pieces I’m working on. It was supposed to be a great opportunity. However, there was a problem with the main painting.

I need some sort of input from fellow artists, because I have absolutely no idea what’s going on. I woke up around 7:15 this morning- Saturday, no work, Shabbat, etc etc- and went on as I normally did on the weekends. Shower, get dressed, make some tea (I was born and raised in New York, but my Mum’s from Hackney and I live in London now, so having three cups of tea per day is the norm), feed the cats, do last night’s dishes, eat breakfast, and set to paint for the rest of the day. 

The problem arose when I walked down into the basement, where my art studio was set up.

Something was… *off* with the main painting. It was a depiction of Dionysus, the reference photos commissioned from my favorite model. They (yes, they, nonbinary people exist, up yours if you’ve got a problem with that) were poised on a wooden table, their hand covering their mouth, dragging the bags of their eyes down. They wore a wreath of grapevines, metal cuffs adorned on both wrists, with a circular brass horn balanced between their left pinkie finger and right hand. Cloth was draped carefully over their thighs and down their legs, a strip of fabric tightly wound around their chest. The painting had my favorite Caravaggio-style lighting that illuminated the brightness in one eye and the shadow in the other. It was my best work.

But it was wrong.

I’d spent over two hundred hours toiling over that 100x120 inch stretched cotton canvas, carefully blending each and every stroke of my miniscule brush. My back ached, my hands spasmed, my neck cramped. I’d almost become addicted to painkillers due to the pure agony of making art on such a large scale. I knew every single molecule in that painting as I had placed it deliberately. It *wasn’t the same painting.* Somewhere deep down, I knew that. I couldn’t place it anywhere specific- on the surface, it looked identical. But the way the hair stood up on my arms, the chill that ran through my veins, the feeling of my insides turning to ice… it was all wrong. It wasn’t the same.

I don’t know what the hell could’ve happened. I hadn’t taken any photos of the completed piece yet. I kept a dark cloth draped over it during the day to protect it from any UV rays. No one had seen it, the first appearance I’d intended it to make had been today during the studio visit. Yet somehow, the painting had been replaced.

I didn’t end up cancelling the studio visit. It was too late, and too much hung on the chance of a gallery exhibiting my work. One by one, representatives came to survey *Dionysus’ Grief*. One by one, they walked around the room, stopping at each painting, tilting their heads at the incomplete ones (the series was due to be finished in five months), and standing in awe at the largest, most magnificent painting. The wrong painting.



It looks the exact same. The *exact* same. But I know it can’t be the same painting, because it’s missing the rip my girlfriend Leah made with her nails, and the little splatters of blood in the bottom left corner, and of course the large spot of gore she annoyingly made in the middle. I’d left the ruined painting as it was- there’s no way it could be salvaged. So how was it standing in front of me, perfect and clean? Reddit, please help me. I don’t know what happened to the original painting and how- or who- replaced it. There’s also the annoying little detail of how Leah came to the studio visit and served all the representatives tea, healthy as a horse, despite her being dumped into the Thames last night. I’ve killed her four times now, but she just keeps coming back. What a bitch. The point is, Reddit artists, I need you to explain what the hell is going on. I feel like I’m going crazy. How has my painting been replaced, and who’s the culprit?!

Any help would be appreciated. Cheers.
