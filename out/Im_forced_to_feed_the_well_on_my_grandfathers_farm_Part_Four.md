Over the course of the next week, Mandy spent more and more time at the farmhouse. By the weekend, she had practically moved in. I felt like I was engaging in some shameful and depraved act of perversion, but like an addict, I continued to indulge. There was something about the way Mandy would look at me that made it impossible to even think of saying the word “no.”

Each time I began to consider the horror of what she was putting into motion, I would picture my brother going over the edge of the well. That's how I ended up sitting at my kitchen table while Mandy talked with the sheriff over the phone. Apparently, he was a Wisher too.

I tried my best to ignore what was taking place with my consent. I failed miserably in that endeavor.

Mandy had arranged a prisoner to be brought up to the farm under the guise of a work-release program. I closed my eyes and forced myself to not think about what would happen this evening. I failed at that as well.

Mandy must have sensed this, because after she hung up the phone, she walked to where I was to lift my chin up with a gentle push of her index finger and kissed me deeply. It was almost supernatural how the words entered my mind as she pressed against me.

I suppose if it's just criminals...

I knew it was only the first of many rationalizations I would have to make. Still, I let myself be drawn into it. As she pulled away, I only barely registered that I was condemning a man to die.

Life with Mandy was dream-like. After the months of solitude, waking with her by my side didn't feel quite real. I'd reach out and brush my fingers along her black hair, pulling the strands from her ivory shoulders and watch as she'd smile in her sleep. If this was a dream, I never wanted to wake from it.

I'd wake up early and have coffee with her as she would get ready to leave for the bar. Not long after she left, Otto would appear and talk for a while. I didn't have the courage to tell him what Mandy was doing, but he also didn't ask. Instead, he'd tell me how much happier I looked and that he was looking forward to meeting Sarah and Blake when they came to visit.

I'm ashamed to admit it, but Otto was right. I was happier. Even talking with my mother had become easier. When she'd hold out hope that Danny might come back someday, I found myself smiling and thinking that he actually might. Mandy had told me that I could have anything I wanted so long as I was willing to provide the flesh the Well would desire as its price. More and more, that price didn't seem as steep as it had.

When the evening came that day, Mandy and I were waiting in the driveway as the sheriff pulled up in his SUV. He tipped his hat to Mandy and I, and even though he was wearing sunglasses, I was sure I saw a wink. He then went to the back of the vehicle and led out a man that couldn't have been older than twenty. The sheriff held the young man by his handcuffs as he walked him towards where Mandy and I were standing. We wordlessly turned and began leading the way to the Well.

“I just want to say that I appreciate the opportunity to-” the young man began to say nervously, only to be cut off by the sheriff's sharp voice.

“No need to talk, son. They're about to go over orientation. Better listen up.”

I realized this was my cue and swallowed hard before speaking.

“Don't worry, it's an easy job. We had some damage to the interior of this well and just needed someone to get lowered down to repair the masonry. It won't take long.”

We arrived at the well just as I finished speaking, a contraption of wood and cable suspended above it. It was a simple pulley system I had rigged up the night before. There was a hand crank at the base of the structure which would either draw a cable up or down depending on the way you moved it. At the end of the cable was a harness held in place by a metal spring-clip.

After he had his handcuffs removed, the young man nervously pulled it towards himself and put it on while the sheriff, Mandy and myself watched him wordlessly. After he had pulled the last strap tight around his thigh, he looked out at us expectantly.

“Okay, go ahead and step into the well,” Mandy urged with a pleasant smile.

The young man suddenly looked confused.

“Where's the tools?”

Oh shit.

“What?” asked Mandy, the pleasant smile suddenly replaced by irritated confusion.

“You want me to go down there and fix something, right? Where's the tools? I don't see any around here. It's just strange is all,” he he said slowly, eyes going from one person to the next and a look of trepidation darkening his features.

In response to this, the sheriff pulled his pistol from his holster with a slow and deliberate movement accompanied with an irritated sigh. He pulled back the slide chambering a round as the young man flinched backwards and began to take breaths in rapid secession.

“Come on, don't do this! I just took some stuff! Pleas don't do this!”

“Whoa, calm down! The tools are down there already, there's no need to freak out, okay?” I heard myself saying as I lifted my arms with my pams out in a disarming gesture.

The kid seemed to calm down a little, turning towards the well while the sheriff lowered his gun. The kid let go of the side of the well and was hanging over it, nervous sweat beading on his forehead.

“Okay, so I just go down there and fix the well, right?”

I smiled at him, my hand reaching past the lever of the pulley system and instead grabbing the clip joining the harness to the cable.

“That's right kid. You're gonna fix the well.” I said reassuringly while my stomach churned.

I pressed down on the release and the clip came away with a loud snap. For just a moment, the kid's face contorted into a look of desperate terror as he sucked in air to prepare for a scream that never came. His gasp echoed up from the dark only to be followed by a meaty crunch. Then another. And another.

I stood there, bracing for the realization of what I had just done to settle over me with its totality, but the shock never came. Instead, I felt only relief mixed with cold acceptance.

When I finally did turn away, I saw Mandy and the sheriff both kneeling upon one knee with their heads down. Mandy was the first to lift her face up towards mine, her green eyes shining with renewed vigor. I had thought she was was in her forties, but the woman before me looked ten years younger than that. She stood to her feet and wrapped her arms around my waist with a coy smile.

“How many more,” I said, burying my face into her shoulder.

She laid a hand across the back of my head, her dark embrace a more complete oblivion than even the liquor could afford me. She pulled me in with those slow and deliberate movements, each smooth action reminiscent of a languid wave washing ashore... or a snake caressing its prey.

“As many as it takes, my love. As many as it takes for your dream to come true.”

I finally embraced her back, having made up my mind. After all, if it's just criminals that are being killed...

Sarah and Blake arrived a couple days after that. I picked them up from the airport with Mandy riding in the passenger seat. It was a three hour long drive back into the countryside, so we had plenty of time to get to know one another. I had been a little nervous that things might be awkward, but to my relief, it was the most normal moment I've had since I got the phone call about grandpa Silas's stroke all those months ago.

Sarah and Blake were standing next to the parking area as we pulled up. I got out and helped with their luggage, getting a good look at the two of them as I did so. Sarah had blonde hair that fell almost to her waist laced with a few streaks of premature gray. She bore the weight of the last few months admirably, but the wear of such exertion was clear upon her face in the dark rings beneath her eyes.

Blake stayed close to his mother, regarding me with a shy curiosity. When he met Mandy, that shy curiosity gave away to outright infatuation. He sat just behind her in the car, completely drawn in as Mandy described the veritable feast she would be preparing once we arrived home. She would look back at him and smile occasionally, those bright green eyes flaring with infectious excitement as she described the fun he'd have fishing and camping.

“Camping sounds amazing, I haven't done that in years,” Sarah sighed from the backseat.

“It's going to be great, there's a really cool campsite the town uses,” I said. “There's lots of families up there this time of year, it's a lot of fun.”

I saw Blake grinning ear to ear through the rear view mirror and laid my hand on Mandy's knee. I felt her hand slide over the top of mine and give it a squeeze.

We pulled up to the farmhouse as the sun was beginning to set. I walked behind everyone else with the bags and glanced towards the silhouette of the well standing black against the waning light of the sun, the pulley system looking like gallows, and realized that this was the longest I'd gone without feeding it since I had come here. I smiled and followed the others inside.

Blake was falling asleep before we had even finished dinner and was already snoring upstairs as Mandy uncorked a bottle of red wine. She settled in at the table with the bottle and three glasses and began to pour.

“So how'd you two meet?” Sarah asked as the ruby liquid splashed from the bottle into a glass.

“It's actually really cute,” Mandy began. “Do you believe in fate?”

To her credit, Sarah didn't roll her eyes, though I wouldn't have blamed her if she had.

“I'm not sure if I do or not, but I'm listening,” she said with an amused grin.

“Well, Ches would come in every now and again when he was in town, but never really talked much. So, one day, I decide I'm going to flirt with him.”

Sarah snorted a little and Mandy gave me a wry smirk. I could tell she was enjoying telling this story she had invented.

“Go on,” Sarah prompted with another laugh.

“I walk over to where he's sitting at the bar and tell him he looks like the first boy I ever kissed when I was eleven years old, and he looks at me like I'm crazy, but now I have his attention.”

She paused to take a sip of wine dramatically, masterfully building the tension. She finished and sat the glass down, turning to me to act out her next scene of the story.

“You know you never forget your first kiss, right? What was yours like?” She asked with exaggerated innocence and femininity, then dropped her voice into a mimic of my own. “My first kiss happened not far from here at the lake where everyone goes camping. “I was visiting my grandpa and met a girl up there over the weekend. On the last day, I finally got up the courage to kiss her by the lake.”

She paused again, looking at me adoringly and slipping her hand into mine, all the teasing and mimicry melting from her voice as it filled with emotion.

“I told him that's crazy, because that's exactly how I had my first kiss with old man Silas's grandson...”

I smiled at Mandy, staring deep into those implacable green eyes as she squeezed my hand. The story was a complete falsehood, pure fiction with no other purpose than to explain our meeting. Still, I lost myself in that fiction. I lost myself in Mandy's dream.

Sarah smiled at us fondly, then broke into crying with a sudden gasp.

“I'm sorry, I don't mean to-”

Mandy was already on her feet, an arm around Sarah's shoulders as she told her not to worry.

“It's just the wine, honey, it's okay,” Mandy soothed.

“I know, I just miss him...” Sarah whispered, turning to look into my eyes. “I know you miss him too, Ches.”

I nodded and laid my hand on her shoulder, unable to hold her gaze. I tried not to think of the fact that she was trying to comfort me, the man who had killed her husband. The only thing that allowed me to withstand that thought was the belief that I could also be the man who returned him to her.

The next day, we left for the campsite. I left the barn door open for Otto, in case he needed to borrow the tractor, and left to enjoy a week out at the lake. We had brought tents, fishing poles, food and about a dozen bottles of wine to enjoy over the next week. We all piled into the car and started on the short drive, no more than a few miles away.

We crested the final hill and could see Lake Meder in the distance, reflecting the brilliance of the sun upon its gentle waters. There was already a good number of tents around it and a few small boats on the water with fishing poles bristling over the sides.

We parked and retrieved all our gear to begin walking to our camping spot. On the way there, we passed families setting up their own tents, playing with frisbees or just sitting around their campsites. As we got closer to the water, we could see lots of kids Blake's age all playing on the beach or swimming.

“Can I go swimming, mom?” Blake asked excitedly.

“After you set up your tent. Where else are you gonna change into your bathing suit?” Sarah responded with a laugh.

We got to our spot and started setting up tents and unpacking gear. A short distance away was a family doing the same. There was a man and woman as well as a little girl about Blake's age. The man had a large build and dark brown hair. I recognized him from town as Calvin Larson, one of the managers of the feed store. I'd talked with him a few times and deduced that the woman must be his wife, Jennifer, and the little girl would be his daughter, Cary. I waved and smiled at them, prompting them to do the same.

For the first time since I had arrived in this place, I actually felt like I belonged in that moment.

We finished setting up the campsite and Blake wasted no time in changing into swimming trunks and running down to the lake. Sarah looked at Mandy and smiled.

“Thank you guys for this. It means a lot. It's the first time I've seen him this happy since his father disappeared.”

“No, thank you for being here,” Mandy said, giving Sarah a hug. “You two don't even realize how much we wanted to have you here.”

I let Mandy and Sarah have their moment. I decided I would go down to the lake and fish off the dock. I had my rod and reel in one hand and my tackle box in the other as I followed the little trail that ran down from the hill we had camped on. I arrived at the dock and flicked my rod through the air, hearing the satisfying splash of my baited hook hit the water as I sat down.

I had been sitting out there for a few minutes when I heard foot steps echoing on the wooden planks of the dock. I looked up to see Calvin Larson walking towards me with his own rod and reel.

“Hi there, neighbor!” he exclaimed with a cheerful smile.

“Hey Cal, you're fishing too, huh?” I responded.

“Well, I hope to, but I'm gonna have to borrow some bait. I don't have any in my tackle box. I can trade for it though,” he said as he drew near, setting his tackle box on the dock and opening to reveal it had been filled with ice and beer.

“I think we can make a deal,” I laughed, grinning at him.

We cracked a couple cans of beer and sat there on the dock, lines in the water and the sun shining overhead.

“So, Mandy told me about your whole well thing you're dealing with. She wanted me to come down here and let you know that you're not alone and that I'm willing to help.”

I looked at Calvin with a raised eyebrow. I had ceased to be shocked by locals knowing about the worst kept secret in town.

“That's good to know, Cal. Seriously, it's appreciated,” I answered him and took another sip of beer.

From where we sat, we could see Cary and Blake swimming in the lake. I smiled, remembering how Danny and I would play out here as kids.

“I think it's going to be a fun week,” Calvin said next to me. “The wife and I are going to grill tomorrow night. You'll have to bring everyone over.”

“Sounds fun, we'll be there with a bottle of wine” I confirmed with a content sigh.

The stars that night were incredible, an explosion of light painted across the sky. Mandy and I watched them while laying next to each other in the grass. She was curled up against my side, head resting against my chest. I helped her to her feet and led her to our tent where she laid down and fell right to sleep. I stepped out to douse the fire and heard a voice coming from Blake's tent. I crept closer and peaked through the perforated material near the top to see Blake and Cary sitting next to each other.

“I like you too...” I heard Cary whisper.

Blake leaned forward and kissed her awkwardly on the lips. They parted and grinned at each other.

“I have to go back before they realize I'm gone,” she said after a moment.

“Okay, but I'll see you tomorrow, right?” Blake whispered to her.

“You better,” Cary said with a grin as she stood up to sneak back out.

I hid behind the tent as she left, smiling at the innocence of it all.

Danny would have been proud of him.

No.

Danny will be proud of him.

I next morning, Mandy surprised us by make pancakes and coffee. She had brought a French Press, which was already full of rich, dark coffee wafting through the air as we awoke. She made me jump by appearing right in front of me as I unzipped the door of the tent. I laughed at my own fright as she handed me a coffee cup and kissed my cheek.

“Oh my God, is that coffee?” came Sarah from the doorway of her own tent.

“It is, honey, and there's pancakes too!” Mandy tittered as she poured another cup of coffee.

“I like the way this day is starting,” I said wish a grin.

“Then you'll love what we're doing later,” Mandy said with a sly wink.

“What's that?”  
“We're having a picnic. I got a nice bottle of rose' and packed some bread and cheese for us.”

I took another sip of coffee, once again wondering if this could even be real. I decided I wouldn't question it too much, letting out an audible moan of approval at the quality of the coffee.

After we packed our provisions and hiked out to a little spot on a hill, Mandy and I sprawled on a blanket with a bottle of wine and a basket between us. We sipped and giggled as the light glittered off the tiny waves of the lake in the distance.

“Just so you know, I'm really happy with you,” I suddenly told her.

She wordlessly reached out and held my hand, smiling at me with those perfect eyes.

We laid there watching as the clouds drifted lazily through the sky with our fingers intertwined. I thought back to the Harvest Moon and my sheer panic and horror as I fed a dead body into the well. Here I was after killing a living man and condemning him to the well, and I felt serene. I didn't feel an inkling of guilt. If there ever was any, it had been swallowed up the twin emeralds that shined out from Mandy's eyes.

By the time we got back to the camp, it was already sunset and we could smell the smoke of the Larsons beginning to grill. As promised, Sarah, Blake, Mandy and I arrived with a bottle of wine. Before long, we all sat around the fire, eating and talking.

“So, what do you think of our town so far, Sarah?” Calvin asked her courteously with a smile.

“I like it a lot! I wish we would have come down earlier.”

“What kept you from visiting?” Jennifer, Calvin's wife, asked.

“Mostly my husband's job,” Sarah said, then stopped suddenly, clearly having tripped over small patch of pain she hadn't seen.

“Yea, Jenny and I heard about what had happened with your husband. We're real sorry to hear about it,” Calvin said in a sympathetic tone.

“Thank you. I pray to God everyday that he comes home,” Sarah added in a voice scarce above a whisper.

“We'll make sure to pray as well. God works miracles everyday,” came Jennifer's reassurance.

“Yes, he does,” Mandy said, looking at Blake with a smile as she did so. “If you keep your eyes open and look, you'll see a miracle.”

Looking back now, I shudder when I think of her saying that. However, at the time, I smiled at her and enjoyed my food and wine.

The night air was cool but not cold, and as the night wore on, we all entered a comfortable stupor of well fed euphoria and decided to call it a night. Blake and Sarah went to their tents with sleepy smiles on their faces and Mandy and I lounged by the fire.

There, in that moment, I'm pretty sure I was the happiest I had ever been in my entire life. That being said, I can't be certain that it doesn't just seem like that when juxtaposed by the events that came after.

I woke up in the dark. I looked over to where Mandy should have been, but she wasn't there. Feeling confused, I got up and walked to the open door flap of the tent. There was a stillness to the air that felt... wrong. I looked around, but Mandy was nowhere to be seen. As my eyes scanned the dark around the camp for a human form, I noticed Blake's tent was open as well. When I looked into the opening, I could see that Blake was missing too.

I began to get a bad feeling, but pushed it down. I instead walked towards the Larson campsite to see if maybe Mandy and Blake were over there, but when I arrived, I found their tents all empty.

The foreboding sensation boiling in my stomach began to evolve into a blooming sense of dread in my chest. I spent the next few minutes jogging to where I parked the car only to find it gone when I arrived. I tried to ignore what my mind was beginning to put together and began walking.

It was a few miles back to the farm by road, but with cutting through fields and hopping a few fences, I could make it back there in about an hour and a half. Every step I took, my mind began to race faster and faster.

“So, Mandy told me about your whole well thing you're dealing with. She wanted me to come down here and let you know that you're not alone and that I'm willing to help,” I could hear Cal saying.

I walked a bit longer.

“The well doesn't accept dead flesh for this. It needs to be a live human, the younger, the better,” I could hear Mandy saying in my mind.

I walked faster now, my heart thundering in my chest.

“If you keep your eyes open and look, you'll see a miracle,” I could hear her saying to Blake now.

I ran the last bit of the way from there. I jumped the fence and entered into the massive cornfield that led up to the farmhouse. The corn pressed in from all sides, but I knew to keep the fence to my left as I followed it up to where I could see firelight dancing in the distance.

The first thing I arrived at was the barn. I crept up to the doors, trying to open them as silently as possible. I could hear voices in the distance, down by where the well sat silent and hungry. I went to pull the door open, but found it locked. It was at that moment that I realized I forgot to grab my keys from the camp.

I crept around the side of the barn until I could see the well and the crowd that had gathered around it. At least three dozen people were holding torches and all facing the well, seemingly waiting for something.

“Chester...” I heard a rumbling voice speak from just behind me.

I turned and was relieved to see Otto standing there.

“Thank God, Otto, we need to do something. I think they're about to sacrifice Blake to the well.”

“Don't worry, Chester, they would never do that. Blake is the next caretaker.”

My blood froze in my veins and I took an involuntary step backwards.

“What are you saying... Otto, that can't be what's happening.”

“We must feed the well, Chester.”

Otto began to change in front of me. His features became less defined. He still looked like an old man, but there was something else there now too. It was like looking at something with 3D glasses, but the second image was something grotesque. Too many eyes and a mouth that was more of a mandible than anything human.

“What the fuck!” I shouted and jumped back.

I wasn't fast enough and Otto grabbed both of my arms in his and held me in place. I struggled, but his iron grip held me there.

“Come, Chester. Come witness a miracle.”

He began marching me towards the well, hauling me as I kicked and scrambled uselessly the whole way.

I recognized some of the people gathered there. There was Henry, a regular at the bar. Jordan, the girl who ran the sewing shop in town. Jennifer Larson, who's husband and daughter were noticeably absent.

Oh no.

I realized what was happening them. I looked over to the farmhouse to see Mandy leading Blake towards the well with a hand on either shoulder, the boy beaming with a toothy smile. Behind her was Calvin similarly leading Cary. I twisted hard in Otto's grasp to no avail.

“Do you know how long I had endured you grandfather's meager rations? How long the most I could look forward to was a desiccated corpse to be thrown down my gullet?” He leaned in near me, his voice a low snarl. “Do you know how much I've hungered in the dark?”

I was crying now, tears streaming down my face.

“Please... please, let me go...”

Otto responded with stony silence as he turned me towards the well and held me in place by my shoulders. I watched as Mandy led Blake to where he could watch. I could hear her as she looked down and spoke to him.

“If you keep your eyes open and look, you'll see a miracle.”

Calvin lifted Cary up and sat her on the edge of the well, giving her a kiss on her forehead. She looked up at him serenely, not a hint of terror on her face. That's when he turned and looked at me expectantly.

“You have to choose, Chester.” Otto whispered behind me. “You have to choose to make this trade. Ask for your brother to be returned to you and he shall be.”

I closed my eyes hard, then opened them and looked into Mandy's green orbs that looked back at me with a smile. I looked back over to Calvin with his face of grim expectation. Finally, I opened my mouth and I spoke.

It's been a while since all that happened. I'm sitting in the airport now, waiting to board my flight, writing this on my laptop. I'm flying back home to the farm after picking up Susan.

I met Susan on a message board about the paranormal. She's only seventeen, but she wants to start her own paranormal YouTube channel. I went out to meet her and we're flying back to the farm so she can research the well.

I told her there's some kind of weird artifact at the bottom of it.

It's wrong, sure, but I'm going to have my brother over soon. He was found a couple weeks ago with amnesia a few towns away. No idea how he got there, and with him having no memory of how it happened, it looked like a mystery that would never be solved. I wasn't able to see the tearful reunion between him and Sarah, but I was definitely happy to hear about it.

It was definitely something Blake needed. After he got back from the camping trip, he had been really quiet and withdrawn, but his dad's reappearance seemed to have brought him out of it.

Sarah just seemed happy to have her family back.

I'm having all three of them as well as a bunch of other guests out over to the farm for the wedding. Mandy and I still haven't decided where we want to go to for our honeymoon, but at least we know the well will be okay in the meantime.

Well, Susan and I are boarding the plane now, so I have to go. She's so happy and bubbly that I almost feel some guilt for what I'm about to do. Almost.

At the end of the day, I have to do what I was always meant to do. I have to feed the well.

And the well shall feed me.
