 While I'm writing this, my hands won't stop shaking. I desperately want to get out of here, but I know that if I don't write what's happening, no one will believe me. I have to stay calm.  
   
 It was just the two of us. Me, Hangar, a grumpy widower, and Romeo, my only and beloved child. It was only the two of us since my wife passed away four weeks ago. Those were rough times for me and my boy, that kept himself on his room for the most part of these weeks, which felt like an eternity.   

 I respected Romeo's time to heal, as well as my own, which lead me to start smoking again after being sober for six years. At the second week, we had to face the hard reality that knocked on our door and blew in our window. I got back to working at my family's car wash and Romeo got back to school.  
 
 As hard as it is, I got to admit that I've never been as present as I should've been to my son, but I tried to compensate the lost years by getting closer to him during our grief. He had a hard time opening himself, but he was noticing my effort.   

 At the end of the third week, Romeo told me he had shocking news: He got a girlfriend! I got really excited for him. He described her vaguely, just pointed out some of her characteristics, like her pale skin and droopy brown eyes, and her name: Rosemary. That was the name of my now dead wife. God, I miss her so damn much. Even though I'm a tough man, I ended up crying in front of my own son, that held me and promised everything would be okay eventually for both of us. We ended up drinking some beers and talking about our lives, and I knew my son was a good kid, even though he had no friends at school and spent most of the time on his computer.   
   
 Life kept going. Romeo started going out a lot more, probably spending more time with his girlfriend, which made me proud and happy that he finally found someone that loved him. I wanted to meet Rosemary, but my son never would let me. He told me she didn't post herself on social media and wouldn't let my son take pictures of her. I knew that we would have to meet one day, so I kept my guard down.   

 Time kept passing, and no sign of Rosemary. I started to think that it was all a lie and my son was making excuses to go out and get high, but he didn't seem like the type to do so.   

 Until one late night, I heard Romeo opening the front door and going upstairs, whispering and giggling. He probably was with Rosemary. I pretended to be asleep, but had a huge grin on my face. I waited for them to get inside the bedroom and knocked on the door, anxious. My son shouted that I should get away because his girl was naked and wanted to sleep. I got the message clear and went back to bed, feeling a little guilty, but looking forward to meeting her in the morning. When I woke up, she was no longer in the house. And then, it kept happening. They sneaked in, slept on his bedroom and she left before I could see her. I started wondering if I was being too rigid.   
   
 In one specific night, I knocked on Romeo's door, and heard a loud "get out" from him. I stood still and demanded that he came out of the room along with his girlfriend. He tried to make me give up, but I didn't. After a lot of arguing, he got out of the room, alone. I asked him to call Rosemary, but according to him, she was asleep. I tried forcing my way inside the bedroom, and I could see her silhouette under the blankets, asleep, and then my son pulled me out, yelling that I was being super creepy and wasn't respecting Rosemary's privacy.   
 
 We went to the living room to have a clean talk, and I told him I was fine with their relationship, and that she didn't have to hide from me, I wasn't some kind of monster that would kick her out of my house. I knew she was coming, so there was no need to for her to hide and sneak out like in some kind of forbidden love movie. He seemed nervous, and told me he already knew about all this, but Rosemary was insecure about her looks. I said that she was sneaking in and out of the house for nearly one week now, and I never even saw a glance of her face. He affirmed it was a matter of time until she'd loosen up, and that she talked a lot of good things about me and the way I raised Romeo. My son knows that I feel really flattered when people compliment me, so I let my guard down once again, and reassured that she'd be always welcome at out household. My son thanked me, and I did something that may sound stupid, but I reached out to my wallet and gave him a condom. It was a desperate try to make it look like I was this liberal dad that would let his son fuck a girl right under his own roof. It seemed to work, because my son thanked me and got upstairs quickly.   
   
 A few weeks passed by. Now, they've discovered what "sex" meant. They had sex all night like rabbits. Our house had two floors and the walls were thin, so I ended up hearing everything.   
 
 Normally, my shift went from 1 PM to 8 PM, but my uncle, who was also my boss, had to close the car wash early due to some personal matters that I didn't really care, so I went home at 6 PM, something unusual. I was feeling really down in this particular day because I found an old note from my wife in the pocket of my jacket, since I didn't wash any of my clothes since she passed. The note said something so silly and ordinary that I can't even remember right now, but it was something like "your lunch is inside the microwave, don't forget to heat it up". Something so silly made me tear up so damn hard.   
 
 Anyway, I went straight to my bedroom. Didn't even bother to have dinner. I was feeling really depressed, and usually I tried brushing it away because I hate feeling sad, but that day was different. I wanted to enhance my sadness as much as I could. So I figured I should get inside my wife's closet and smell her scent. It was a little room, full of her clothes, because they didn't fit inside our regular wardrobe. I haven't got inside the closed since she passed, because she would be all over the place and I didn't knew if I could handle it. But, fuck it.  
 
 When I opened the closet's door, I saw something moving in the shadows. I swear I had the biggest goosebumps of my life. I searched quickly for the light switch and, when the lights were on, I saw Romeo going through her dresses, and holding some of them. I instantly asked him what the fuck was he doing with her clothes, and I could see he was shocked to see me. He told me he was trying to feel closer to her, and I can't explain why, but I had this gut feeling telling me it wasn't true, so I said I didn't believe him. Then, he started crying really hard. I've never seen anyone cry this hard my entire life. Then, he started saying that he wanted to give those dresses to his girlfriend because she didn't have money to buy one, and according to him, his mother's dresses were "useful now since she's dead, so we should give them away to people that actually need them". We had a huge fight, and I'm not really in the mood for giving details, but we came to a deal: he could give his girlfriend one of my wife's dresses, but we would keep all of her other clothes. He thanked me, and said if I kept like that, Rosemary would eventually show herself to me.  
   
 In another one of my lonely nights, Romeo and Rosemary were upstairs. I bought some bottles of whiskey in that same afternoon, and drank a whole bottle right when I came home. My metabolism is weirdly fast, so it never took too much to get me drunk. While wasted, I made a bet with myself: I had to see Rosemary's face. Even though I was a grown adult, I couldn't resist the temptation. Me and Romeo shared the same balcony, which meant that I could see the interior of his bedroom if I went to the balcony. I walked slowly, a little apprehensive. Maybe she was just ugly and didn't enjoy her own appearance, but that didn't make any sense, since my son is not even close to being ugly, so he wouldn't hook up with someone below his level.   
 
 While I was walking towards the balcony from my bedroom, I heard the house shaking again, and I immediately understood what was going on. I got even more curious and tempted to see, and I felt like I was a teen again, fooling around like the old times. I opened my window silently and started crawling towards his bedroom window, but then I felt a weird, putrid smell, like if an animal had died a few days ago and was rotting, but I ignored it. The more I got closer to my son's bedroom, the worse the smell got. After two minutes, which felt like an eternity to me, I saw Rosemary's face. Her body really was pale. Her mouth was violet. Her hair was dry. Her body anorexic and motionless.   
 
 That girl wasn't his Rosemary, it was my Rosemary. My dead fucking wife. There she was, naked, humiliated and defenseless. My own son was fucking my wife's dead body. I couldn't move, I was shocked. My whole life fell down right in front of my face. I was still grieving, and I thought he was too, but I slightly noticed that he stopped bringing her up. This was happening right under my roof. I took all the strength I still had and got up. He hadn't noticed my presence, and was enjoying himself. His face had no signs of guilt or regret, he seemed happy.   
 
 I walked slowly towards my room, too shocked to cry or attack him. After all, he was all I had left. I opened my window and got inside my bedroom, and locked all the entries. I opened my wardrobe and searched for my gun. Adrenaline was popping out of my veins and I was desperate.  
 
 After I had the gun in my hand, I knew what I had to do. I'm sitting on my wife's side of the bed to make me feel closer to her, even though her body is in the room right next to mine, and I can still feel the walls trembling. Now, I'm holding the gun against my forehead and praying to God one last time, wishing that He can lead me to where my wife is, so I can live the eternity by her side. And also, I'm begging Him to make my body rot before my son can find me.
