I didn’t think much of it when the police knocked. At first.

I live alone in a quiet suburb where nothing ever happens. That’s not exaggeration — I moved here specifically because it’s boring. Same houses, same cars, same people walking their dogs at the same times every day. You notice when something breaks the pattern.

That night, I was working out in my garage. Door open for air. Phone on a shelf playing one of those loud motivational videos because I was exhausted and needed the noise to stay focused. I remember counting push-ups, losing count, starting again. My muscles felt heavier than they should have, like I’d already been there a long time.

I remember hearing my breathing echo off the walls and thinking it sounded wrong. Too slow. Too deep.

Then the sirens started.

Two police cars pulled up with their lights on. Neighbours came out of their houses. Someone had called because they thought someone was being hurt. The officers asked me multiple times if anyone else was inside. I laughed it off, showed them the weights, the phone, the empty garage.

They left after a few minutes. Embarrassing, but harmless.

I closed the garage door and went inside.

That’s when I noticed the blood.

At first I thought it was dirt. A dark smear across my forearm, tacky when I touched it. Then I saw more — streaked along my wrist, speckled across my shirt. My heart started racing. I checked myself for injuries. No cuts. No pain. No reason for it to be there.

I washed my arms in the sink. The water ran pink for longer than it should have.

I told myself it was a nosebleed. Or maybe I’d scraped myself and didn’t notice. People miss things when they’re tired.

I tried to sleep.

Sometime later — I don’t know how long — I woke up on my side with my jaw aching like I’d been clenching it for hours. My sheets were twisted around my legs. My heart was pounding like I’d been running.

I could hear breathing.

Not mine.

It was coming from the garage.

Slow. Measured. Like someone deliberately trying not to be heard.

I lay there frozen, counting breaths. One… two… three… They didn’t line up with mine. When I held my breath, it kept going.

I grabbed my phone and turned on the torch. The house was empty. Every door was still locked. I stood at the door to the garage for a long time before opening it.

The light inside was already on.

The weights had been moved. Not knocked over — arranged. Neatly stacked in the centre of the floor. My phone was on the shelf where I’d left it, but the screen was cracked now, spiderwebbed like it had been dropped hard.

There was a handprint on the concrete wall.

It was dark, smeared, and too large to be mine.

That’s when I noticed my forearms.

Bruises were blooming along the inside of both arms, deep and purple, shaped unmistakably like fingers. They were sore when I touched them, tender in a way that told me they weren’t old.

Someone had grabbed me.

I locked myself in the house and didn’t sleep again that night.

The next morning, my neighbour was waiting outside when I took the bins out. He smiled and said, “Rough night?”

I asked him why he said that kind of thing the day before.

He frowned. “You don’t remember?” he asked.

I asked him what happened after the police left.

He went quiet for a moment before saying, “You were screaming.”

I asked him who he thought I was screaming at.

He looked at my arms.

Then he said, very carefully, “The same person you were begging to stop.”
