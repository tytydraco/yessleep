I was an adventurous kid. I liked practically anything that moved. Snakes, beetles, birds, and some types of plants. By ten, however, I'd given up my interest. I just wanted to fit in and be happy with friends. So I screamed at the sight of the average garden snake and ripped out my bug journal. I started focusing on friends, and I made them. 

So many of them. 

In eighth grade I still liked things like that. Snakes, bugs, other things. I liked spiders. However, I found only kids who were afraid of them, so I was too. Still, there were bullies. Mom said to ignore their jabs at my self-esteem. Dad said to quit being a baby. So I tried, but I was still verbally abused by kids bigger, better than me. I accepted this as part of life, something I couldn't ignore or stop. And that's what it was. But It wasn't all it was.  

Some were worse than others. Some hurt me physically. Pushes, hits, punches. All because I liked spiders. Liked bugs, liked plants. I cried so much to my mom she just started rolling her eyes and telling me to walk away, hit them back or something. But I didn't. I couldn't. Finally, we moved schools. 

10th grade was better than any other. No one looked at me weird. No one knew me. When they approached me to say hi, ask what I liked, my favorite color, I lied. My favorite color was red, I liked doing my mom's hair, I was someone else. And I kept saying those things. Asked them what they liked. Oh really? I like that too. I liked so many things. Hair, nails, cars, bikes, dogs, cats, farms, cities. I liked dancing. I hated dancing. I liked hiking. I hated hiking. I hated spiders. I like Emma. I hate Emma, she's annoying. I'd do anything for friends. 

Up into adulthood, I lied. I got a husband out of it. "You're so likable, we are perfect for each other," he'd smile. It feels so good I keep lying, for his own good, I think. I jump at the sight of spiders now, just like everyone likes. Huddle next to my husband, beg him to kill him. I think I liked the color green, but It's whatever color anyone else likes now. Blue, purple, pink, orange. I like those now. I don't know what I like now. Spiders? Hiking? Board games? I stared at a color wheel on google the other day, looking for a color I liked. I looked up popular hobbies. I don't know what I like anymore, and it's killing me. Everyone compliments me, saying how easy it is to get along with me. But It isn't a good thing for me. I thought I liked plants, snakes, but now I jump at them. My therapist says people change, I am changing. But since I've ten I've been changing. Changing me. 

There are voices in my head now, telling me to find a new hobby or quit. "Be yourself," everyone always says, but what if I can't be? I see things, black figures telling me to just go away. My nightmares say to be myself. But I don't know myself. I am trapped in a cycle of not knowing anything. So I'm trying to write this as those figures close in. I have a feeling I won't be alive tomorrow. If I do, I don't know If i'll like it. I just want one person to read this, tell me It'll be okay. Whatever you like to believe. I thought I liked spiders. I did. I loved them. But not now. 

I'm scared of spiders.
