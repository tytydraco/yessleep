I'd finally hiked to the top of the cliff I wanted to. The warm summer heat made the trek a bit more difficult but it was all worth it. 

To commemorate a milestone of pursuing photography as a hobby, I wanted to take a picture of the sunrise at a national park about an hour's drive from my city. I was going to camp out overnight, building a shelter out of branches, mud and rocks. I had a bit of time to kill so I took in some of the scenery. 

The valley below was a grassland with nothing but rocks and shrubs. It was pleasantly silent. There was something that caught my eye down in the valley, however. It looked like a pile of rubble from afar, but it was difficult to make out the details from afar. The cliff I was on was at least seventy feet high. I decided I'd take a picture. 

I took my camera and zoomed in on the pile. To my surprise, it was actually a strange layout of polished and carved rocks. Most of them were perfect blocks, with a long slab in the middle that looked the size of a banquet table. I snapped the photo, thinking maybe someone online would know the history behind it.

I began working on my shelter. I was savvy enough to bring rope, a hand saw, a settler's wrench, and a small shovel to dig up clay with. I was disturbed by nothing and got myself settled into a shelter of primarily clay walls. It was snug in there, I could roll over and stretch, but just barely. I'd drilled holes into the shelter to let some fresh air in. They doubled as peek-holes, too. After three hours, I'd built a trap door that I could access from inside and outside the shelter. It probably looked like an anthill from the outside, I was completely concealed.

I gave myself a pat on the back by gorging on all my snacks. I was pretty stuffed by the end, and even got a few pictures of the setting sun to go with the sunrise photos that I initially wanted. I forgot to charge my phone. It was sitting at a good thirty percent. It would hopefully last me if I was responsible. I shut myself in my shelter not long after the sun went down and passed out.

I was awoken by noise coming from the valley. It was a mix of cheering and shouting. Odd thing to have so late at night or early in the morning. I opened up the trapdoor so I could crawl out and investigate.

I got a good view of the commotion from where I was positioned atop the cliff. The sun wasn't even rising, yet. No, instead the glow came from little bouts of fire floating down in the valley below. Torches, I was certain of it.

The torches moved around the strange block formation that I had eyed on my way to my camp not all that long ago. I could barely make out figures carrying the torches. I could see silhouettes below the lights.

An idea popped into my brain, my camera could zoom in. I had already snagged a good photo of the formation before!

I crawled back towards my shelter and opened up the hidden door. For a brief moment I was cozy. Couldn't I just ignore the weird shit happening down below me? No, no I was far too curious. I got my camera out of my bag and cleaned the lens as quick as I could.

The grass atop the cliff was long enough that I was partially concealed to most. I crawled to the edge of the cliff once more, camera in hand.  I was fortunate enough to have a nighttime shooting mode as a preset. I did my due diligence to shut off any sort of lighting as to not give myself away. I peeked into my camera and began zooming in.

The torches were being held by men in robes. I quietly chuckled, was this some sort of secret role-playing party? I'd heard of similar things in Burning Man, but I didn't see any drugs or LED lights anywhere. Still it was pretty unsettling, and I carefully kept my eyes on them. They turned over some of the stones to reveal braziers that they lit. All the while they were still chanting something I couldn't understand. I did a quick count, nine of them. 

The group went into a formation surrounding the largest slab dead center of the block formation. With all the braziers lit, one of the robed members blew a horn that made the sound of what I could best describe as a screeching sheep. It was a sickly sound that echoed beyond the valley. If I didn't know any better, I'd say the thing was screaming in my face. 

Then nothing. Silence, with the odd breeze swaying the grass I was in. The robed figures stared deeper, completely silent, into the valley where nothing showed until five minutes later. More torches illuminated in the distance on my left. However, I could very well hear something distinct, and horrific:

A woman screaming her lungs out. She sounded like she was in agonizing pain. I zoomed in the best I could, and found that she was being carried by four more robed figures. They had one for each arm and leg, restraining her thrashing effortlessly.

I watched helplessly as they carried her to the slab. It dawned on me that this was no weird role-play in the valley...this was a cult. A cult that performed rituals, no less. The woman was begging to be let go, as they put her on the large slab. They chained her to it, and that's when I noticed she'd already been hurt. I couldn't tell from the distance whether it was a burn or a carving, but an enflamed, horned sigil was marked on her stomach quite crudely. 

I needed to do something. I looked back at my shelter and realized how hidden I was. I could help, then retreat to the shelter and hope for the best. If I were to cause a distraction, maybe the woman could escape? The chains that bound her to the rock didn't seem that tight. She could probably wriggle out if she tried hard enough. 

The chanting started up again, louder than before. It drowned out the woman's screams. I decided to swiftly and subtly act. I threw a rock off the cliff. I could hear the echoes of the rock hitting the bottom, and a few of the cultists took notice. They stared at the base of the cliff, before resuming their work. 

They splashed a dark liquid on the woman, coating her stomach completely. I think the poor girl was in shock, for she barely reacted to it. I could see her movements were slowing down. One of the robed figures turned around and picked up a crudely made stone hammer. He brought it above her head, and she stopped screaming. Instead, she just wept, defeated. 

I had to do something. The rock wasn't going to be enough. I sighed, engaging the flash on my camera.

I took the photo.

The flash lit up the valley like a comet had graced the sky above us. I quickly ducked down as the chanting and all subsided. I reluctantly peeked through the camera again. 

All the cultists were staring from where the flash came from. From me. 

Then they started screaming, charging towards the base of the cliff.

I scrambled back into my shelter, sealing the trapdoor shut. They were gonna have to go a long way around to get to where I was, and that gave me a perfect chance to try calling for help on my phone. I could still hear the screaming, and it began sounding more feral and inhuman. I shuffled around my bag for my phone. 

Fourteen percent. I had to risk it. As I began dialing, hoping my signal would reach, I felt something shaking. I could hear the screaming get louder, as well as rocks falling from down the cliff. A knot in my stomach formed as I realized what I was listening to.

 I didn't think it possible, but, they were scaling the cliff face. They were climbing fast, too.

I couldn't afford to make much noise. I stuffed my phone in my pocket and prayed that I wouldn't be detected. I inspected the roof of my shelter. If someone stomped hard enough, they'd probably cave it in, and I'd be discovered and mutilated. 

Through the peek-hole I drilled earlier, I saw the first of the cultists reach the top of the cliff. He was wheezing but he was persistent. He simply ran deeper into the forest, right past me. More of them came, and soon it was like a stampede was galloping past me. I didn't even risk looking through the hole anymore. I simply held my breath, pepper spray in hand.  

I could hear them trampling through the brush in front of me, but there was one straggler who had just finished the climb up the cliff. He did a rallying screech and charged right towards my shelter.

Smash

His boot stomped down on my shelter, missing my face by inches. The shelter's ceiling had caved in, but the monster didn't seem to care, charging onwards. I began hyperventilating, paranoid more would come, or worse that they'd come back. 

Thankfully they never did, but I could still hear them for a good ten minutes afterwards, charging towards nothing. I took out my camera and crawled out of the shelter towards the edge of the cliff. Risky, I know. I zoomed in to see if the woman was there. 

She was gone. 

It appeared she'd freed herself from the chains and made a run for it. I panned around the valley, and eventually I spotted her running back the way she was carried in from. It was the closest to a highway, so I'd hoped she'd find salvation from this nightmare. 

I stayed still until the sun began to rise, and I got the picture that I wanted of the rising sun. Only this time it wouldn't bring a good memory, but a memory of a nightmare. A memory of people that had evil inside them, functioning on the outskirts of town. 

I made it out of there, and I'm home safe now. I hope that poor woman is, too. Nobody knows about the rock formation yet, what's affiliated with it? I hope to have answers soon.
