It was the last week of summer. That, I knew. We all knew it. We all felt it. The kids in town were going to bed each night tossing and turning, knowing they’d soon be fighting for that extra fifteen minutes of sleep. Soon, we’d no longer be waking up to the sun gleaming in our eyes, but instead a cacophony of alarms tearing our dreams in half. Back to early mornings, and tyrant teachers sucking the lives out of our poor, captive souls.

What I didn’t know was that final week of summer would be the last time I’d ever see my friends that I had never even met.

Kevin and Jordy were my best friends, my brothers. They were in my life for as long as I could remember. Kevin was a year older than me, and Jordy was a year younger. Our bond was nearly that of twins, or triplets for that matter. We were there to witness each other’s first steps, words, laughs, everything. Even before the universe could switch on my consciousness, it was like they were always by my side, floating in some eternal void I could never make sense of.

From what I can remember, my childhood was normal. I was well fed. My parents told me stories at night. They loved me enough to kiss my wounds when I took a spill. I got into trouble, but not too much trouble. My bed stayed dry—most of the time. Things were good. It wasn’t until I was about nine when my “normalcy” came into question.

*Our son is going to grow up to be a freak…*

*I bet the Smithsons’ boy doesn’t go to his room and sit in total silence all day and night…*

*It’s not his fault, I’m a terrible father…*

*If he grows up to be the weird kid, we are going to be known as the weird parents…*

*The boy needs help…*

My father’s voice could reach the back of an auditorium, so “down the hall and to the left” was no chore for his booming words when they came passing through my bedroom door, and into my little ears.

From outside looking in, sure, I was the weird kid. How could I not be? It’s perfectly normal for an only child to have a couple of cute and precious imaginary friends when they are a toddler, but that cutesy feeling turns into an acid climbing up the back of a parent’s throat when their child is approaching double digits. Dad did his damnedest to get me involved in sports, scouts, things that moved fast, or sounded fast—things that would get me hurt in all the right ways. Mom, well—she was Mom. I was her baby boy, and no matter how strange and off-kilter I might have been, I was her strange and off-kilter boy.

As I settled into my preteen years, the cutesy act ended, and act two, or the “boy, get out of your room and get your ass outside” act, began. For years I had tried explaining to my parents, and everyone around me, that Kevin and Jordy were real, but nobody believed me. Whatever grief my parents gave me was multiplied tenfold by the kids at school. By that time, any boy in his right mind would have dropped the act, and made an effort to adjust, but not me. The hell I caught was worth it. I knew they were real. Kevin and Jordy knew things I didn’t.

I remember the math test hanging on our fridge. A+…

”I’m so proud of you,” my mom said. “Looks like we have a little Einstein in the house.”

Nope—wasn’t me. That was all Kevin. I’m not one to condone cheating, but if you were born with a gift like us three shared, you’d use it, too.

The night before that test, I was in the Clubhouse with the boys—at least, that’s what we called it. Our Clubhouse wasn’t built with splintered boards and rusty nails, but with imagination stitched together with scraps of wonder and dream-stuff. It was our own kingdom; a fortress perched on top of scenery of our choosing, with rope ladders dangling in winds only we could feel. No rules, no boundaries, just an infinite cosmic playground that we could call our own. It was a place that collectively existed inside our minds, a place we barely understood, but hardly questioned.

Kevin was soaring through the air on a giant hawk/lion/zebra thing he had made up himself. He had a sword in one hand, and the neck of a dragon in the other. Jordy and I were holding down the fort. We had been trying to track down that son-of-a-bitch for weeks.

I heard my mom’s heavy footsteps barreling toward my room. Somehow, she always knew.

“Guys,” I said. “I have to go. Mom is coming in hot.”

“Seriously?” Jordy wasn’t happy. “You’re just going to leave us hanging like this, with the world at stake?”

“Sorry,” I said. “It’s 2 a.m. You know how my mom gets.”

“Lucky you,” said Kevin. “My mom only barges in when I’m sneaking a peak of Channel 46 at night.”

“At least your mom knows you like girls, unlike Tommy’s mom,” said Jordy. “Isn’t that right, Tommy?”

The vicious vernacular of the barely prepubescent boy—the usual Clubhouse talk. Kill, or be killed. I wasn’t up for the fight—next time. “Alright, that’s enough for me, guys. I have a quiz in the morning, and it’s already too late. Kevin, can you meet me in the Clubhouse at 10 a.m.?”

“You got it,” said Kevin.

I landed back in my bed just in time for my mom to think she saw me sleeping. I only say ‘landed’ because leaving the Clubhouse—a place buried so deep in my mind—felt like falling from the ground, and onto the roof of an eighty-story building.

The next morning, I walked into Mrs. Van Bergen’s math class. She had already had the quiz perfectly centered on each kid’s desk. Ruthless. She was in her sixties, and whatever joy she had for grooming the nation’s youth into the leaders of tomorrow had gone up in smoke like the heaters she burned before and between all classes. As I sat at my desk, I watched each kid trudge on in with their heads hung low, but mine was hoisted high. I had a Kevin.

As soon as all the kids sat down, I shut my eyes and climbed into the Clubhouse. Like the great friend he was, Kevin was already waiting. Question by question, he not only gave me the answer, but gave a thorough explanation on how to solve each problem. He was the smartest kid I knew. Math? No problem. History? Only a calendar knew dates better than him. Any test he helped me take was bound to find its way to the sanctity of mom’s fridge.

We were getting to the last few problems when Jordy decided to make an unwelcome appearance.

“Tommy? Kevin? Are you guys in there?” Jordy yelled as he climbed the ladder. “Guys, you have to check out this new song.”

“I don’t have time for this right now, I’m in the middle of—”

Jordy’s round face peeked through the hatch. “So, I’m driving to school with my mom today, and this song came over the radio. Fine Young Cannibals—you ever heard of them?”

“No, I haven’t. Seriously though, Kevin is helping me with my—"

“She drives me crazy…Ooohh, Oooohhhh…”

“Jordy, can you please just—”

“Like no one e-helse…Oooh, Oooohhh…”

“Jordy!” My patience, which was usually deep, but quite shallow for Jordy, was used up. Jordy froze. “I’ll hear all about your song after school, I promise. We are getting through my math test.”

Academically, Jordy wasn’t the brightest—socially, too. To be honest, all of us were probably socially inept. Hell, we spent most of our free time inside our own heads, and up in the Clubhouse. Jordy had dangerous levels of wit and could turn anything into a joke. Although his comedic timing was perfect, the timing of his comedy was not. There were far too many times I’d be sitting in the back of class, zoning out and into the Clubhouse, and Jordy would crack a joke that sent me into a violent fit of laughter. Needless to say, all the confused eyes in the physical world turned to me. And just like that, the saga of the strange kid continued.

…

If I close my eyes tight, I can faintly hear the laughs from that summer reverberating through what’s left of the Clubhouse. It was the summer before eighth grade, and it began as the summer to remember. The smell of fresh-cut grass and gasoline danced through the air. The neighborhood kids rode their bikes from dusk until dawn, piling their aluminum steeds into the yards of kids whose parents weren’t home. They ran through yards that weren’t theirs, playing tag, getting dirty and wearing holes in their jeans. Most importantly, they were creating bonds, and forging memories that would last and continue to strengthen among those lucky enough to stick around for the “remember when’s”—and maybe grow old together.

I participated in none of it.

While all the other kids were fighting off melanoma, I was in the shadows of my room, working on making my already pale skin translucent. Although my room was a sunlight repellant, no place shined brighter than the Clubhouse.

As the boys and I inched towards that last week of summer, we laughed, we cried, we built fantastic dreamscapes, rich with stories and lore. We were truly flexing our powers within the endless walls of the Clubhouse, but soon, the vibrant colors that painted the dreamscape would darken into unnerving shades of nightmares.

Unless one of the boys was on their yearly vacation, it was abnormal for the Clubhouse not to contain all three of us. Our gift—or burden—had some sort of proximity effect. The further one of us traveled from one another, the weaker the signal would become. But something wasn’t adding up.

Each week that went by, Kevin’s presence became scarcer. He wasn’t out of range—I could feel him nearby, sometimes stronger than usual. Kevin began going silent for days at a time, but his presence grew in a way that felt like warm breath traveling down the back of my neck. I didn’t understand.

By the time the last week of summer arrived, our power trio had turned into a dynamic duo. Don’t get me wrong, I loved Jordy, but I could only handle so many unsolicited facts about pop-culture, and his gross obsession with Belinda Carlisle, even though I was mildly obsessed myself. The absence of Kevin felt like going to a dance party with a missing leg.

It was Sunday evening, the night before the last time I’d ever see my friends. Jordy and I were playing battleship.

“B6,” I said. A rocket shot through the air, and across the still waters. The explosion caused a wake that crashed into my artillery.

“Damnit! You sunk my battleship. Can you read my mind of something?” Jordy was flustered.

“No, you idiot,” I said. “You literally always put a ship on the B-row every single time. You’re too predictable.”

“I call bullshit, you’re reading my mind. How come I can’t read your mind?”

“Maybe you need an IQ above twenty to read minds.”

The bickering swept back and forth. Right before the bickering turned hostile, a welcomed surprise showed itself.

“Kevin!” Jordy, ecstatic, flew across the waters to give Kevin a hug. Kevin held him tight.

“Where have you been?” I asked.

Kevin just stared at me. His bottom lip began quivering as his eyes welled up. He kept taking deep breaths, and tried to speak, but the hurt buried in his throat fought off his words.

We all waited.

With great effort, Kevin said, “I don’t think I’ll be able to see you guys anymore.”

The tears became contagious. My gut felt like it was disintegrating, and my knees convinced me they were supporting an additional five hundred pounds. The light in the Clubhouse was dimmed.

“What happened? What’s going on?” For the first time in my life, I saw sadness on Jordy’s face.

Kevin responded with silence. We waited.

After some time, Kevin said, “It’s my parents. All they’ve been doing is fighting. It never ends. All summer long. Yelling. Screaming. I’ve been caught up in the middle of everything. That’s why I haven’t been around.”

Kevin went into details as we sat and listened. It was bad—really bad. The next thing he said opened the flood gates among the three of us.

“I just came to tell you guys goodbye. I’m moving away.”

God, did we cry. We stood in a circle, with our arms around one another, and allowed each other to feel the terrible feelings in the air. Just like that, a brother had fallen—a part of us who made us who we were. A piece of our soul was leaving us, and it wasn’t fair. We were supposed to start families together, grow old. Our entire future was getting stomped on, and snuffed out.

Kevin’s head shot up. “I have an idea,” he said. “What if we all meet up? Tomorrow night?”

It was an idea that had been discussed in the past—meeting up. Why not? We were all only a few towns apart. Each time the conversation came up, and plans were devised to stage some sort of set up to get our parents to coincidentally drop us off at the same place without explicitly saying, ‘Hey, can you drop me off so I can go meet my imaginary friends?’ the idea would be dismissed, and put to rest. It wasn’t because we didn’t want to meet one another in person, it was because…

“Meet up? What do you mean ‘meet up?’ Where?” Jordy nearly looked offended.

“What about Orchard Park? It’s basically right in the middle of our towns. We could each probably get there in an hour or so on our bikes. Maybe an hour-and-a-half,” said Kevin.

“Orchard Park is over ten miles away. I haven’t ridden my bike that far in my life. Tommy hardly even knows how to ride a bike.” Jordy started raising his voice.

“Shut up, Jordy!” I wasn’t in the mood for jabs.

“No, you shut up, Tommy! We’ve been over this. I’m just not ready to meet up.”

“Why not?” I asked. “You’re just going to let Kevin go off into the void? See ya’ later? Good riddance?”

“I’m just not ready,” said Jordy.

“Not ready for what?” asked Kevin.

Jordy paced in a tight circle. His fists were clenched.

“Not ready for what, Jordy?” I asked.

“I’m not ready to find out I’m a nut case, alright? The Clubhouse is literally the only thing I have in my life that makes me happy. I’m tormented every day at school by all the kids who think I’m some sort of freak. I’m not ready to find out that none of this is real, and that I am, in fact, a total crazy person.”

The thought nearly collapsed my spine, as it did many times before. It was the only reason we had never met. Jordy’s reasoning was valid. I also wasn’t ready to find out I was living in some fantasy land, either. The thought of trading my bedroom for four padded white walls was my only hesitation. But, there was no way. There was absolutely no way Jordy and Kevin weren’t real.

“Listen to me, Jordy,” I said. “Think of all the times Kevin helped you with your schoolwork. Think of all the times he told you about something you had never seen before, and then you finally see it. I mean, come on—think of all the times you came barging in here telling us about songs we’ve never heard before. Do you really think that’s all pretend?”

Jordy paused, deep in thought. Anger took over his eyes as he pointed at Kevin and me. “How about this? What if you two are the crazy ones? Huh? What if I’m just some made up person inside of your head? How would that make you feel? Huh?” Jordy began to whimper.

“You know what? It’s a risk I’m willing to take,” I said. “If you think I’m going to take the chance on never seeing Kevin again, then *you* are crazy. And you know what? If I get to the park and you guys aren’t there, then I’ll check myself right into the looney bin with an ear-to-ear grin. But you know what else? I know that’s not going to happen because I know you guys are real, and what we have is special.

“Kevin,” I said. “I’m going.”

…

It was 11:30 p.m. the next night. I dropped into the Clubhouse.

“Are you leaving right now?” I asked.

“Sure am,” said Kevin. “Remember, the bike trail winds up to the back of Orchard Park. We will meet right off the trail, near the jungle gym.”

“Sounds good. Any word from Jordy?”

“Not a thing.”

We had spent the previous evening devising a plan. Was it a good one? Probably not. It was the typical ‘kid jumps out of bedroom window, and sneaks out of the house’ operation. I didn’t even know what I was going to tell my parents if I were to get caught, but it was the last thing on my mind. In the most literal sense possible, it was the moment of truth.

The summer night was thick. I could nearly drink the moisture in the air. During the day, the bike trails were a peaceful winding maze surrounded by nature, but the moon-blanched Forrest made for a much more sinister atmosphere. My pedals spun faster and faster with each howl I heard from behind the trees. In the shadows were creatures bred from imagination, desperately trying to come to life. Fear itself was chasing me from behind, and my little legs could hardy outpace it. I was making good time.

I had never been so thirsty in my life. Ten miles seemed like such a small number, but the deep burning in my legs told me otherwise. *One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight… One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight*. It was my mantra. *Keep the rhythm tight. You’re almost there*.

I saw a clearing in the trees. I had reached Orchard Park.

I nearly needed a cane when my feet hit the grass. My legs were fried, and the jungle gym was right up the hill. I used my last bit of energy and sprinted toward the top. Nobody was there.

I checked my watch. I was early. God, I hoped I was just early. I rode fast. I had to be early. Surely, Kevin was coming.

As I waited, I thought about what life would be like in a strait jacket. Were they hot? Itchy, even? Was a padded room comfortable and quiet enough to sleep in? More thoughts like these crept up as each minute went by.

A sound came from the woods. A silhouette emerged from the trees. Its eyes were trained on me.

The shadow spoke, “Tommy?”

“Kevin?”

“No, it’s Jordy.”

“Jordy!” I sprinted down the hill. I couldn’t believe it. I felt weightless. Our bodies collided into a hug. There he was. His whole pudgy self, and round cheeks. It was Jordy, in the flesh. He came. He actually came.

“This is total insanity,” said Jordy.

“No—no it’s not. We aren’t insane!”

With our hands joined, we jumped up and down in circles with smiles so big you’d think we had just discovered teeth, “We aren’t insane! We aren’t Insane!”

Tears of joy ran down our faces. The brothers had united.

“I’m not going to lie to you,” said Jordy, wiping a mixture of snot and tears from his face. “I was scared. Really scared. This whole time, for my entire life, I truly thought I wasn’t right. I thought I was crazy. And to see you’re real—it’s just…”

I grabbed Jordy. “I know.” The tears continued. “I’m glad you came.”

“Have you heard from Kevin?” asked Jordy.

“I’m sure he’s on his way.”

Jordy and I sat on the grass and waited. It was surreal. I was sitting with one of my best friends that I had seen every day, yet had never seen before in my life. He looked just like he did in the clubhouse. In that moment, whatever trouble I could have possibly gotten into for sneaking out was worth every second of the experience.

From right behind us, a deep, gravelly voice emerged. “Hey, guys.”

We both shuddered at the same time and seized up. We were busted. Nobody allowed in the park after dark, and we were caught red-handed. Once again, the adults cams to ruin the fun.

“I’m sorry,” I said to the man. “We were just meeting up here. We’re leaving now.”

“No, guys,” the voice said cheerfully. “It’s me, Kevin.”

I don’t know how long my heart stopped before it started beating again, but any machine would have surely said I was legally dead. This wasn’t the kid I played with in the Clubhouse. This man towered over us. He was huge. What little light the night sky had to offer was blocked by his wide frame, casting a shadow over us. His stained shirt barely covered his protruding gut, and what little hair he had left on his head was fashioned into a bad comb-over, caked with grease. I can still smell his stench.

“This is incredible. You guys are actually real. You both look exactly like you do in the Clubhouse. I’m so excited.” Kevin took a step forward. “Want to play a game or something?”

We took a step back. There were no words.

Kevin took the back of his left hand, and gently slid it across Jordy’s cheek. Kevin’s ring sparkled in the moonlight.

“God,” Kevin said. “You’re just as cute in person as you are in the clubhouse.”

There were no words.

Kevin opened his arms. “Bring it in, boys. Let me get a little hug”

I didn’t know what was wider, my mouth or my eyes. Each muscle in my body was vibrating, not knowing which direction to guide my bones. ‘Away’ was the only answer. Jordy’s frozen posture made statues look like an action movie.

Kevin grabbed Jordy by the back of the neck. “Come on over here, ya’ big goof. Give me a hug.” Kevin looked at me. “You too, Tommy. Get over here—seriously.”

Jordy was in Kevin’s massive, hairy arms. Fear radiated from his trembling body. There were no words.

“Come on, Tommy, don’t be rude. Get on in here. Is this how you treat your friends?”

Jordy began struggling. There were no words.

Kevin’s eyes and mine met. I could hear his breathing. The moment felt like eternity.

With Jordy dangling from his strong arms, Kevin lunged at me. Like a rag doll, Jordy’s feet dragged across the grass. Kevin’s sweaty hands grabbed my wrist. I can still feel his slime.

There were no words—only screams.

I panicked. I didn’t know what to do. In that moment, there was no thinking. The primal brain took over. I shook, I twisted, I turned, I shuddered, I kicked, I clawed. The moment my arm slid out of his wretched hand, I ran.

The last thing I heard was Jordy’s scream. It was high-pitched. Desperation rushed my ears, its sound finding a permanent home in my spine. The wails continued until Kevin, with great force, slapped his thick hand over Jordy’s mouth. I’d never hear Jordy’s laughter again.

I pedaled my bike like I had never pedaled before. The breeze caught from my speed created a chill in the hot summer air. I pedaled all the way home. God, did I pedal.

When I got back home, I sprinted into my parents’ room, turning every light on along the way. They both sprung up in bed like the roof was caving in. I begged them to call the police. I pleaded in every way I could.

“Kevin isn’t who he said he was,” I said it over and over. “He took Jordy. Jordy is gone.” I told them everything. I told them Kevin was moving, and the thing we shared didn’t work at distance. I told them I had snuck out to meet them. None of it registered. I was hysteric.

To them, the game was over. The jig was up. My parents weren’t having it. They refused to call the police. When I tried picking up the phone myself, my dad smacked me across the face so hard he knocked my cries to the next street over. There were no words.

*Enough is enough!*

*It’s time you grow up!*

*I’m tired of this fantasy bullshit!*

*We’re taking you to a specialist tomorrow!*

*I refuse to have a freak under my roof!*

They didn’t believe me.

The look in my mother’s eye told me I was no longer her little baby boy, her strange and off-kilter boy. She covered her eyes as my dad gave me the ass-whooping of a lifetime. I had no more tears left to cry.

…

The Clubhouse. I miss it—mostly. I haven’t truly been back in over twenty years. I don’t even know if I remember how to do it. It’s probably better that way.

After that terrible night, I spent the next couple of days going back to the Clubhouse, trying to find Jordy. I prayed for a sign of life, something—anything to tell me where he might be so I could save him. The only thing I caught were glimpses, glimpses of the most egregious acts—acts no man could commit, only monsters. I don’t care to share the details.

On the third day after Kevin took Jordy, my parents and I were on the couch watching T.V. when our show was interrupted by the local news. Jordy’s face was plastered across the screen. His body was found in a shallow creek twenty miles outside of town.

My parents’ faces turned whiter than their eyes were wide. They looked at me. I couldn’t tell if those were faces of disbelief, or guilt. Maybe both.

There were no words.

Every once in a while, I muster up the courage and energy to walk alongside the Clubhouse. I can’t quite get in, but I can put my ear up to the door.

I can still hear Kevin calling [my name.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DreadfulIncorporated/)
