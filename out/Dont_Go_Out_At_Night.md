My friends asked me not to share this story due to how bizarre it was, but I just can't help but want to tell someone about it.

Last week, my friend and I, let's call her Agnes, were at a skate park on a Wednesday. We have a daily routine of going to the gym together, but we go late at night on Wednesdays because nobody else is there.

We finished skating and got back in the car. We stopped by the house to get our pre-workouts and drank them on the way to the gym. 

It was going fine at first, we both had headphones on, doing our workouts, when Agnes tapped me on the shoulder. I turned around to face her, and she pointed to a corner of the room. Most of the building was lit up, but there had always been a corner where the lights just wouldn't turn on.

I strained my eyes attempting to find something in the darkness, when I lock eyes with a tall, lanky looking man. I wasn't very scared, as much as I was confused. What was he doing?

He sort of looked like he was hunched over, folded in half almost, looking at both me and Agnes. I stared for a moment more, when he, it, that thing whatever it is, stepped out of the shadows. Now that he- it wasn't hunched over anymore, I could see it more clearly.

The thing was tall, at least 6'11". It towered over us as we started in horror. It's skin was completely black, almost like staring into black paint. Its torso was measurably shorter than its legs, but still large in itself. It's arms were disproportionately long as well. They stretched down past its knees and dragged on the floor.

Its eyes were purely white, as if it had no pupils or iris, just the sclera. It's mouth gaped open, hanging past where the chin should have been, with little black strings of its skin holding it together.

I screamed, louder than I'd ever screamed before, and ran to hide behind Agnes. What is that thing??

It was still for a moment, and i thought, maybe it's harmless, but oh, boy I could not have been more wrong. I held in a gasp as it lifted up its long arm and scraped it's fingers across Agnes' face, leaving 3 deep gashes in her skin. 

We ran. Faster than we've ever ran before. We picked up our bags, still in a full sprint. As soon as we exit the building, we spot the car. The only one in the parking lot.

We got into the car and I put it in drive, reaching into the glove compartment to hand Agnes a first aid kit. And as I back out of our parking spot, the thing is suddenly in front of our car.

It chases us until we can get to the police station. Just incase it followed us home and hurt us there. We get out of the car and run into the station, panting, and desperately trying to explain what happened.

Officer Charlie, Agnes' older brother, walked into the back to look at street cameras, and they could see the thing lurking, but it had vanished as soon as we got inside the station.

They looked for whatever it was but never ended up finding anything. The scariest part about this story, is that I still see it, lurking outside the windows of the apartment I share with Agnes.
