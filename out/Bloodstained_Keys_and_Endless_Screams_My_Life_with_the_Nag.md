The Nag writes this, not I. I am simply an instrument played to the tunes of the Nag’s desires. Once, I was a person with his own thoughts, feelings, and life. I had a wife and children. Friends. Everything a man could ever want in life. Now, they’re all gone. 

I am in the basement. It is where the Nag feels the most comfortable. It loves the cold darkness. It reminds of its home. I do not like the cold. If I beg for a blanket or space heater, the Nag takes my hand and slaps me across the mouth. The Nag doesn’t allow me comfort or rest. 

The Nag came at a moment in life where I was least expecting it. I’d always liked reading and writing. While everyone else was yawning and wanting to kill themselves during English class, I was involved in the discussions, did all the reading, and looked forward to writing papers for the teacher. I hadn’t done it in a long time, so I decided to try writing some short stories and see how I felt about them. Just for the fun of it. 

The words didn’t come. The document remained blank while I went off to check my emails, social media accounts, and watched videos online. Then suddenly, I felt an itch. It wasn’t on my head, but inside my mind. It was telling me I needed to fill those blank pages with the most exquisite prose the world had ever seen, and I went back to it.

The stories I wrote were awful pieces of garbage which never should have seen the light of day.

(The Nag forced me to write that)

Once the Nag took over, my hands shot up to the keyboard and my fingers started moving automatically. Things like words appeared on the screen. None of it made sense. It was nonsensical. Gibberish. Malarkey. Incoherent. Dreck. Junk. Trash. Shit. 

(Don’t mind, the Nag. It loves synonyms)

After a while, the words on the page became legible. I wish they hadn’t. The Nag wrote of inconceivable terrors beyond the grasp of human understanding. The images described within the text were horrifying and grotesque. The stuff of living nightmares. Sickening. Maddening. Disturbing. There was so much violence and suffering within those pages, it made my blood run cold with fear. 

The Nag does not stop. I’m only allowed two hours of sleep a night. I eat with a single hand while I continue writing with the other. Believe me, I’ve tried to stop myself from writing. The mere thought of stepping away from the computer upsets the Nag. If I try to force it to stop, it takes a hold of me by the balls and squeezes them tightly until they feel like they’re about to burst. As I recover from the horrible pain, it takes my hand back to the keyboard to continue writing its malevolent words. 

The Nag doesn’t allow me time for bathroom breaks or hygiene. There’s no time for defecation or urination. Only creation. This is what drives it. I wish it would stop and leave me alone. Please leave me alone. I’m begging you. Give me back my life. I don’t want to be alone anymore. I want to see my family again! I’m in pain. I don’t have any fingers anymore. Just shards of bone poking and pressing at bloodstained keys. Please let me see the sun again. HELP ME! LET ME GO!
