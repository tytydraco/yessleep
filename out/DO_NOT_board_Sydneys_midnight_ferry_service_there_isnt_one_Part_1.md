*There are very few hard and fast rules at play in this universe. Certainly, fewer than we would like to believe. Sure, we have built ourselves a comfortable little modern society, under the false pretence that we are ever truly in control of any of it, overly confident in the knowledge that nothing which exists outside of our realms of understanding can ever harm us. I’ve had an experience which suggests otherwise recently, one that I will recount to you. A lot of it, I’m still processing. Still mentally working through. As such, I will not come at this retelling all at once, but rather, one step at a time. I feel it important, not only for my own mental wellbeing, but for your own awareness, that I ensure no detail is missed. I know it sounds cliche, but there really is something of a lesson in all of this… at least… I think there is. This began a little over a week ago, on a hot summer’s night in Sydney City…*

Late was the hour as I finally shuffled my way out of the office, capping off yet another entirely monotonous work week. This was not unusual, of course. A corporate career in Sydney’s CBD may seem like a dream for some, and it probably is for the overlords on the top floors, but the reality for most of us shit kickers is long hours that our pay packets rarely match. Tonight, I had been lucky enough to ***only*** give up 2 hours and 15 minutes of my own time. I had long since learned to consider this the norm and not complain, so without another thought to it, I made my way out to the elevator and hit the call button. A resounding ding signalled its arrival to the 7th floor, and I stepped on in before swiftly pressing the button for ground. I wanted out of this dreary old building, it had been a long week, and I was keen to head on over to the Helm Bar for a few cold ones before making my way home for the night. Once again, another ding from the elevator’s digital display, and I stepped on out. I gave a quick nod of acknowledgement to Barry, the night guard, before scanning my keycard and opening the door to a blast of hot, humid air.

And so concluded the last day of normality I would ever know. As planned, I strolled on over to The Helm Bar, one of my favourite haunts, and always a good spot for happy hour. I ordered myself a drink, grabbed a booth, and I just sat back and looked out over the harbour. The water is beautifully calm this time of night, with not a great number of vessels still operating. Sipping my beer, I raised an eyebrow as I noted something strange. A fog. That was certainly not usual this time of year, and yet there it was, a clearly defined fog settling in over Darling Harbour. I continued to watch it over the next hour or so I was there as it steadily grew denser, continuing to expand up and down the surface of the water. At this point though, I would have been prepared to put it down to the effect of the one too many schooners I had been knocking back. The bar keep’s cry of “last call” finally got me thinking it may be time to make a move and get back home. I gave a wave across the bar signalling my departure, before heading downstairs and making my way back up to the docks to catch the ferry back home. 

I decided to walk along the water this time, the steady breeze across the harbour was a nice break from the insufferable heat. As I strolled, I couldn’t help but notice that fog again. It had grown thicker still, and I wondered if the ferries would even still be running with this lack of visibility. I stepped up my pace a bit, breaking into a jog and running down the ramp at the Barangaroo docks, I didn’t want to miss out on potentially the last ride home. Thankfully, there it was, just pulling in as I made my way down the ramp, swiping my card at the gates. I waited for the departing passengers to make their way off, before stepping on board and taking a seat inside. Looking out the port side window, I watched as the crew pulled back the ramp and latched the gates, before the ferry pulled away from the dock and made its way out onto the harbour. As it did so, I realised I had majorly goofed. This ferry was going the opposite way. Dammit, I thought, I’d either have to sit on board for the long trip up and down the Parramatta River, or get off at the next stop and change. I chose the latter, it would be hours before I got home otherwise. In hindsight… that would have been preferable…

I got up from my seat, making my way out to the open air, glancing out across the dark waters as the lights of the ferry cut through the thick, foggy night air. We could barely see ten metres or so ahead, and I honestly wondered how safe this actually was. The thought of crashing head on into another ship in the middle of the harbour was a harrowing thought, and as I gazed down into the black foggy depths I shuddered just to think of it. That had always been a fear of mine, the idea of deep water. I was fine on boats, strangely enough, but when it comes to actually swimming in water like that, that’s a whole other story. Not even touching on the bull sharks, just the fact that you’re floating above what is essentially a giant hole in the ground if not for the liquid keeping you suspended above it. Thalassophobia, they call it, and I had been cursed with it from a young age. I still recall the first time I watched Jaws. That scene with the girl’s legs dangling haplessly in the water gave me nightmares for weeks on end.

I breathed a sigh of relief as two blasts from the ferry’s horn rang out through the night, and we began to dock at Balmain East. With a loud clang the ramp was wheeled out and I quickly made my way off the boat. What a monumental screw up this had been, I would be waiting at least another half hour for the return trip, and I still had to change services before I would be on my way home. It would be long past midnight before I finally made it back. On the bright side, it was a weekend, so I could at least have a sleep in tomorrow. I took a seat on a small wooden bench that looked like it probably should have been replaced years ago and waited for the next ferry to come along. I sighed, checking my watch and noticing the time was ticking closer and closer to midnight. I paused for a moment, I actually wasn’t sure if the ferries even ran after midnight. I glanced up and down the harbour, getting a little worried now, but I couldn’t see anything. Just fog. I turned my head and listened carefully for any signs of an approaching vessel, but no luck. All I could hear was the soft lapping of the water against the docks. 

I sat there for a little while longer, feeling more and more uneasy as yet more time ticked by with not a single indication that any return ferry was coming my way. I stood up, ready to try my luck with Uber or a cab, I pulled out my phone, noting the clock reading 11:58pm, and prepared to open the Uber app, when what do you know? Along came my ferry. Thank goodness, I thought to myself, that would have been a very expensive ride home, especially at this hour. Scanning my card for the second time that night, I climbed on board and once again grabbed a seat inside the air-conditioned cabin. I rested my head against the glass window and watched outside, taking in the sights of the distant city lights beyond the foggy harbour. I could have dozed off right there and then, to be honest, and I may have were it not for the almighty ***bang*** that startled me out of my relaxed state. The ferry gates had been absolutely slammed shut with a force well beyond necessary. This guy must be having a bad day, I thought, and I made a mental note to stay clear of him. I sat back again and continued to gaze out the window as the ferry’s engine powered up and we were out on the open water again, this time in the right direction.

Two resounding blasts from the ferry’s horn woke me from an unintentional nap. Dammit, had I missed my stop? Wiping my bleary eyes, I stretched and took a look around. The first thing I noticed was the fog, it was beginning to clear a little, but it was still hard to see outside. The second thing I noticed was a fellow passenger. I don’t know how long I was asleep, but I’m sure I would have heard if we had stopped. I took a glance out of my peripheral, I’m sure this guy was not here before. I suppose he could have come down from upstairs or something, but that wasn’t the weirdest part. No, what was weird, was his seemingly undivided attention squarely on me. There was no mistaking it, he was staring intently right at me. I tried to ignore him, to look out the window, but even then I could see clearly his wide eyes in the reflection. He was giving me the creeps. I decided to get up and get some fresh air, primarily I just wanted to get away from him, to avoid a confrontation with what looked to be a person strung out on some kind of substance. That wasn’t entirely uncommon in the city at late hours. I quietly slid out of my row of seats and made a bee line for the rear doors, sliding them open and stepping out on deck into the fresh air. It took me a minute to comprehend what I was feeling, as it was so far outside the realms of normal. The air was freezing cold. Bear in mind, this is smack in the middle of an Australian summer. Just moments before the air had been miserably hot. 

***Bwooooooom! Bwooooooom!***

Another two blasts from the ferry’s horn rang out in the now bitter cold night. The ferry jerked a little from side to side, so I grabbed hold of the railing as I walked around to the front of the vessel. The lights carved a path through the fog, and I could see we were pulling into Milson’s Point. Glancing down at my watch now, I froze in disbelief. It was now 2am in the morning. That was not possible. For one thing, this stop should be a 5 minute ride at most from Balmain East. And secondly, this ferry route definitely did not run this late. In fact, when I really thought about it, I was surprised there was even a ferry coming back this way in the first place. I couldn’t recall, as I was not usually out that late, but I didn’t think they ran past midnight, not as far as I knew. As for one running back and forth across the harbour at 2am… no way. Never has been, likely never will be.

***Crash!***

I jolted back as the ferry came to an abrupt stop. Oh my God, we had hit something, I knew it. My anxiety kicked into full gear as I glanced around for the nearest life jacket. Merely seconds later, however, an announcement came over the P.A system.

*“Please relax. We are simply adjusting our heading. Return to your seats please.”*

I slowly made my way back inside, my heart still racing. I decided to take a seat up front this time, so I could keep an eye on what was going on. I caught sight of that weirdo on the way past, and there was no mistake, he was staring right into my damn soul. What frightened me though, was not just the fact that he was staring, but the look in his eyes. It wasn’t anger, it wasn’t fear, it was concern. He genuinely looked like he was troubled to see me there. He finally looked away as I passed him by and shot him a stare right back, letting him know that he had long since crossed my boundaries. He didn’t look annoyed or offended in any way though, he just looked down at his feet sheepishly. Honestly, that gave me more of a chill than if he had gotten out of his seat and started throwing fists. I continued on up to the front of the ferry and took a seat right next to the window facing out over the bow. There I sat, and waited, and watched.

Onwards we sailed, past the Sydney Harbour Bridge, past the Opera House, and I almost breathed a sigh of relief as we made the turn headed back out to my final stop. But here’s the thing… we ***didn’t*** stop. Instead of continuing on around the bend to Manly Beach, the ferry made a hard right, sailing out beyond the boundaries of the harbour, sailing out into open waters. The fog began to thicken once again, and the frosty air of the night started to seep its way inside the cabin. The ferry was rocking back and forth more violently now as we disappeared into the open ocean, away from the safety of the harbour lights, away from the calm waters within it. My stomach dropped as I felt the boat lift up and over one of the many looming dark waves outside before coming crashing down again. It was of course at this point I knew something was very wrong. Lifting my watch up again I noted the time… 3am. Another hour had passed since we had drifted away from Milson’s Point. My head began to spin as I wondered as to the possibilities. Had this ferry been hijacked? I ran up the stairs and I bashed on the captain’s door, I screamed and shouted trying to get someone’s attention, but no response came.

There was nothing more I could do. Defeated, I staggered my way to the back of the vessel, my legs like jelly now, and I collapsed to the floor. I just stared outside, my line of sight from here a straight shot out through the upper rear doors. Darkness. That was all I could see. There was not even any sign of the vibrant city lights anymore. We were far beyond where any city ferry should be sailing. We were slowly disappearing further and further into the darkness of the South Pacific. So there I laid, and there I watched, as the hours slowly ticked by. Eventually, my eyes could remain suspended no longer, and sleep finally took [me...](https://www.reddit.com/user/Creepy__Oz/comments/1hc8ay2/my_stories_master_list/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
