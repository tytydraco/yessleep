If you thought the world couldn't get anymore insane and drowning in doom, well you're dead wrong, my dudes and dudesses.

So to put it simply(ish), I'm part of a secretive task force for shadow governments around the world to destroy things that do not belong in our realm of reality. And by things, I mean seemingly sentient alien forces that are not humanoid figures that go "ayy lmao" but that are abominations to what is the normal and sane laws of the universe.

So our last mission that quite lead to possibly dooming us all occurred last week on pizza Friday. Boy, am I glad that we had pizza before-hand because it helped ease the tension when we were informed that there had been a Level 5 Breach. Sarcasm. Here is a simplified list of the Levels so you can have a better understanding:

Level 1: Mild damage and violation of laws of reality in secluded area due to Outsider force (the unspeakable alien horrors outside our fabric of reality) entering our dimension to be expected.

Level 2: Mild damage and violation of laws of reality in secluded area to be expected.

Level 3: Mild damage and violation of laws of reality in public area to be expected.

Level 4: Average damage and violation of laws of reality in public area to be expected.

Level 5: Catastrophic damage and violation of laws of reality to be expected. Use of nuclear weaponry is granted. DO NOT LET IT TRANSITION TO LEVEL 6.

Level 6: Apocalyptic. Global ritualistic sacrifice must be done in order to contain and destroy the threat. 

&#x200B;

So what caused the Level 5 Breach? Well a doomsday cult in a rural part of far Northwestern Canada decided it was time to speed-run the entire world of humanity to the end. I guess they weren't too happy with how slow climate change is taking, so they took matters into their own hands. They pretty much performed a ritual of incest, sexual assault of their 45 hostages they abducted a while ago, murder and spilling the blood and semen from it all into a large octagon shape around their private property. Then they read a deeply forbidden passage in a forbidden book that is forsaken by every shadow government we work for.

Our task force; which was of 300 highly trained specialists, arrived at the outskirts of the property as the Sun was beginning to rise. Once we stepped foot into the perimeter of the property, I already felt this overwhelming sense of wrongness and almost nausea-inducing intensity of evil in the atmosphere. And the sky did not look right, which obviously wasn't a good sign. The sky was as if you blended the colors of blood red, dark pink and dark violet together, yet rather than them taking the form of one color, they remain like some twisted river of colors that are copulating with and without consent at the same time.

The Sun was not the welcoming white it's always been before, instead it was a deep fathomless black with a ring similar to that of the sky above us. The clouds were gradually turning black and started raining down blood and violet raindrops that had the same consistency as semen. Yay. Then the air started being filled with disembodied moans and whispers and screams that altogether sounded like it came from a horrific wet fever dream. A psychotic unholy symphony, if you will.

The dread I felt was greater than any feeling of fear I have ever felt in my life. We got to the mansion the cult resided in and we could see all of the naked bodies of their violated victims in the shape of the octagon surrounding the mansion. Black lightning was crawling and even slithering like centipedes and spiders across the sky and the valley this abominable site was in. We breached into the mansion and managed to eliminate most of the deranged cultists on the first floor. Squad 3 kept watch outside the mansion, Squad 1 went up to clear the second floor, Squad 2 investigated the first floor, and my Squad; Squad 4 got the lovely privilege to go down into the basement.

The bottomless pit in the center of the basement blatantly gave everyone there the feeling that they should not be even close to it. So since we couldn't really do much there anymore, we left the basement, sealed the door with obscure occult symbols of containment and regrouped with the rest of the Squads in the mansion.

Everyone cleared their assigned areas in the mansion and we ended up finding out that this demented doomsday cult had been doing smaller yet equally malevolent rituals in various areas of the world. They were so calculative and good and staying under our radar that they managed to do so without gaining even local police attention. Where we were though was their main base of operations or as they themselves called it "home."

When my squad exited the mansion, we received word from Squad 3 that they had contacted every military in every country about the fucked up situation to put them on all alert and prepare for the worst. Oh, the worst was to come, alright alright alright.

Just as Squad 3 told us the public hadn't been made aware yet of the amount of doom possibly coming, we heard the most terrifyingly disturbing sound I have ever heard. Take the unholy symphony volume up, distort it and then combine it with a horrifying thunderous roaring groan like some foul horror just orgasmed with too much reverb.

Every single squad member fell to their knees dry-heaving, shivering and screaming due to the now unbearably vile feeling that followed. This may be triggering for you guys but this is the best way I can describe it: feeling like we were sexually assaulted by everyone we loved and cared about in multiple moments of time simultaneously and forced to orgasm from it. It was too horrible for words to adequately describe it. Aw hell, I feel even awful writing it down.

We then looked up as saw what had breached into our reality. Um, ow, this hurts my head trying to even jog my memory of whatever the hell that was or is. Nightmarishly warped and fused image of naked people, tendrils, tentacles, insect legs, jelly fish, eyes, drooping trees and genitals. But something else was there. I can't find any right words to describe that last part, I've never seen anything like that in my life.

My memory is fuzzy of what happened next, but I do remember these terrifying scenarios that had to do with that abomination. Landscapes that weren't all too familiar and that felt equally as foul. Our loved ones and us and everyone on Earth in endless non-consensual orgies with that thing hovering above us in the violated sky.

I woke up in a helicopter on the way back to base. From what my squad leader told me, we managed to contain the threat through detonating 8 nuclear warheads in an octagon-like outline around ground zero of the breach. The nuclear warheads weren't too big to cause even the people living in Alaska or Vancouver to notice, especially with the help of Canada itself making sure any news of the event would be silenced. So we temporarily contained the abomination and news of it.

Yet it's still there and we have no idea why it hasn't bothered violating the rest of the world. You see, the nuclear warhead method is theorized to only contain these Outsider abominations for so long. But something like this has never happened before. This is the first time in known history to where it's gotten close to a Level 6 Breach. I don't know why it's remaining ominously still in that same area of the doomsday cult's "home." It's waiting for something and we don't know what. I think all it needed was a door to be opened for it to enter our reality and do whatever it pleases. These kind of beings just don't make sense, no rational sense in any comprehensible way. 

The Sun is still white where I am right now, but for how long? How long do we have until this thing decides its time to turn the whole world into a planet of mass violation? I don't know, but it's getting harder to sleep at night or at any time really. I still have nightmares of the visions it showed me. Is that our fate; what I saw? Luckily for me and you guys, my boss doesn't care if I spill this info because they know there's an extremely low possibility of the public believing some random person on the internet talking about unspeakable horrors that entered our world. I have evidence of it, but I value my job, my life and your guys' own sanity to not share it. Things like that aren't meant to be seen by any civilian. But if you start seeing the world act more demented than it normally should, you'll have a pretty good idea why.
