I never told this story before. Not because the memory would be too painful or the secrets contained in it too dangerous to be known. I simply did not want to be ridiculed.   
  
Men of faith have claimed to be in immediate contact with the divine since the dawn of civilization. Miracle healers, shamans and alchemists have existed in every culture and still do to this day. Some do this for their personal gain, because they are con men and others may actually believe it, although they are usually found to be delusional.   
  
Being a man of faith in this modern day and age means walking a thin line. On one hand you see yourself as a cultured and educated person, but on the other you do believe in supernatural forces. Belief in these forces is socially more accepted if such a belief is embedded in the context of a major religion, like Christianity.   
  
None the less, most priests these days would probably define God as something rather vague and metaphysical than an enlightened being influencing the comings and goings of this world in such a literal fashion as it is described in the bible.   
  
I was raised by atheist parents who were always focused on teaching me science and culture and made sure I would receive a proper education; something I was, and still am, grateful for. I do not „hate“ science or dispute it and I don’t believe the world was created by God with a wave of his hand 4,000 years ago. Still, religion fascinated me since I was a teenager and even though I was interested in philosophy as well, I was always looking for a higher purpose – a meaning beyond worldly concerns. I felt like we truly were stuck down here in the miry clay and that a different perspective was needed to set our feet upon a rock.   
  
When I declared I wanted to study theology and become a priest my parents were bewildered, to say the least, but they still supported my decision.   
  
"Look, if that is really what you want, we will support you of course. You are our son, after all, and we love you.“   
  
That’s what my mom told me the night before I was leaving for college and I still remember it to this day.   
  
For our fifth semester, that would start in October 2014, we were offered a unique opportunity to travel to Africa in the winter to do social work for a catholic mission in Malawi. These trips would offer us a chance to do some good, help people and also learn how our faith is practiced in other places of the world. These travel opportunities were very popular among students and thus each college was only granted one spot per semester.   
  
I was one of 75 students who wanted to apply. That number shrunk drastically when our professor handed out a list of all prerequisites for the trip, like taking an additional class for preparation and learning the history of the country, writing a formal letter of application on top of a motivational letter, getting the proper vaccines, etc.   
  
Eventually there were 21 of us left who still really wanted to do it and even though I did not expect to be chosen, I wrote my application as earnestly as I could.   
  
I was thrilled to find a letter of acceptance in my mailbox on October 3rd, that said that I would be flying to Lilongwe on January 1st 2015 and would return June 1st of that same year. Further instructions were to follow.   
  
Over the course of the next three months I was briefed in more detail about my trip and where exactly we would be going. I would stay in Lilongwe, the capital, for 10 days where I would get to know the Archdiocese, seated in Maula Cathedral. Afterwards I would be sent out by Bus to a remote Town, far out in the countryside and from there it was a 36 km hike to the mission (ca. 22 miles). I would have to hike alone, but I was told the trail would not be dangerous if I didn’t leave the path and made it all in one night. The prospect of this long journey did give me pause, but it was an adventure after all and overcoming adversity builds character. Or so I thought. When I asked why I had to travel there alone, since this program was apparently so popular they informed me that there were many missions in Malawi and also in other countries and the participants were distributed as needed.   
  
My time in Lilongwe was enlightening and I learned a lot in my ten days at the Archdiocese. Over 80% of the population are Christian, although most are protestant and only about 17% are catholic. The first catholic missionaries where the White Fathers who arrived in the late 19th century, but the first priests were not ordained until the late 1930s.   
  
The day before my drive to the woodlands I received my final briefing. Father Tarci Moyo, who was responsible for me during my stay sat down with me after service to give me some final advice.   
  
"All right Casey, you will leave tomorrow and I just wanted to see if you have any questions?“   
  
"Thank you Father Moyo, I actually do have some questions. First of all, how do I find the right trail once I get off the bus? And how do I know I am still on the trail and don’t get lost? Are there signs?“   
  
He nodded. "I brought you a map that will show you where to go.“ He reached into his frock and pulled out a hand drawn map of the village with a red circle marked ‚Bus station‘ and an arrow pointing between two buildings with the word ‚trail‘ at its tip.   
  
"You can also ask the people from the village to point out the way. Everyone knows it and most people speak English, even in the countryside.“ He explained, while I was folding up the map and putting it in my breast pocket.   
  
"Are there not dangerous animals in those woods? How can I avoid being attacked?“ That was actually a larger concern for me than getting lost.   
  
He smiled slightly. "Don’t worry. Large animals avoid these paths, as they are frequented by people in the area a lot. You won’t have a guide with you but you will run into other people once in while.“ He reached under the wooden bench he was sitting on. "In case a snake gets too close or you run into a centipede, I got you this…“   
  
He put a machete on the table that seemed brand new. Light brown, wooden handle, and a shiny, straight blade. I lifted it gingerly. "You probably won’t need that, but just in case.“ He smiled assuringly while I put it back onto the table.   
  
As I was about to leave Father Moyo got up as well. "Remember, go straight to the mission, don’t leave the path and be vigilant not to get lost. The Sun sets at 6.15 p.m. You should reach the mission before then.“ I nodded.   
  
I had everything packed up and woke up with my alarm at 6 a.m. to get ready. I had a quick bite and thanked everyone for their help, guidance and hospitality before being on my way to the bus station. The bus arrived at 6.50 a.m. and was an older model that was relatively small. I counted 16 seats that were all occupied and two passengers were already standing, so I had to stand as well. Once we had left Lilongwe the number of passengers had dropped to eleven and I could finally sit down. We drove from suburbs to fields, from fields to open desert and eventually the road was beginning to incline upwards and I could see the mountains in the distance. The landscape became greener and more trees started to grow along the road. We only made three stops after the capital and once we were on the last stretch the number of passengers had dropped to nine. The meadows and small lakes had been replaced by lush forests now and I could hear birds singing.   
  
By now temperatures had risen beyond a comfortable level and the air was more humid. I began sweating profusely and tried my best to stay cool by sitting next to a cracked window.   
  
About 3 hours after I had left the capital the driver announced our final destination and everyone got ready to grab their bags. The village was small and buildings were arranged in a circle around a central plaza with a well between some palm trees.   
  
I got off the bus and tried to orient myself using the map. It was very straight forward and I immediately found the place Father Moyo had indicated on the map. Still, I did not want to take any chances and approached a woman tending her vegetables in the yard of one of the houses. "Excuse me Ma’am!“ I pointed between two houses. "Is this the right way to the mission?“ She looked up and me and smiled. "Yes, this is the way to the mission. But watch out for snakes!“ I smiled and turned around to show her the machete dangling from my backpack. She nodded approvingly. "God be with you.“ She said and turned her head towards her vegetables again.   
  
I looked at my watch. 10.20 a.m. – less than 8 hours till sunset. I was very sceptical that I could walk a stretch of 36 km in that time, even if the trail was a straight line; but then again it would not immediately get dark at sunset, so I should be fine. I started walking.   
  
I sprayed myself with mosquito spray and made sure my equipment was well secured as I entered the jungle. Weirdly enough, entering this enormous, dense forest felt like entering a church. There were sounds, but it still felt more quiet than outside. I was entering a world where I was merely a guest, passing through to reach my destination. I felt I was tolerated here as long as I stuck to the rules. Never leave the path and don’t linger after sunset.   
  
I walked without rest for hours and the trail was quite easy to make out, but one thing was not as Father Moyo had claimed. There were no other people walking there. Even after four hours of walking I did not meet a single soul.   
  
The jungle was dense and humid and I was sweating so much that I became worried my water wouldn’t last. Yet, it felt even damper and wetter somehow and water started dripping from the trees. The dripping turned into a downpour and I was drenched to the bone in minutes. I could barely see through the rain and now the path began a steep incline. I slipped several times and by the time the rain let off I was caked in mud and very much regretted my journey. Having a nap in my college dorm sounded like heaven on earth to me at that point. But I couldn’t turn back now – I was in it for good.   
  
I had been walking for 7 hours now and still no sign of any mission. It was supposed to be in a valley somewhere, so the last stretch should be a decline, yet the path wound itself upward. I became increasingly worried as the clock approached 6 p.m. and when the trail finally emerged from the thick vegetation I found myself on a hilltop overlooking a huge valley. Still I could not see anything other than jungle. No smoke, no clearing and no roads or lights anywhere.   
  
Frustration and fear crept up within me. I needed to make a decision: Go back and look for a fork in the path, I might have overlooked or keep going? Going back wasn’t really a great option as the sun had almost set and I had an hour worth of light at the very most.   
  
The path I was on had to lead somewhere though, so I scanned the edges of the valley and the surrounding hilltops for any sign of human activity or man made structures. One hilltop next to the one I was standing on had large rocks on it, piercing the dusk. I looked closer. Could it be? It looked almost like a building. I estimated it would not be much longer than a ten minute walk to get there and since I was very much out of options, I started walking again.   
  
As I came closer my heart jumped. It really was a building! It was small and I could not quite place it. The architecture seemed old but not colonial. It was made from sand colored bricks und clay and a small tower was attached to the base of the building, that had an ornate roof with a cross on top. Could this be an hermitage? Refuge for a hermit priest? The main part of the building was a rectangle and maybe 20 meters long and 12 meters wide. The tower was very small, not taller than 4 meters. The windows were narrow, almost slits in the wall and the front door made of wood with iron hinges. It did not look new but not rotten or dilapidated either. It was still sturdy.   
  
If it was abandoned I had a place to sleep and if not, then maybe the person living there could offer me lodging and some food. I decided to knock.   
  
The knock did not reverberate much, so the inside was probably not completely empty. I listened further, but there was no sound. I knocked again, harder. Then, there was a sound. The rustling of clothes and the shuffling of feet were followed by the sound of a latch being opened. I took a step back, in nervous anticipation. The door swung inwards and before me stood an old man, wearing the garments of a priest.   
  
"Hello! I am very sorry to bother you. My name is Casey and I am looking for the mission. I am afraid I got lost.“ I waited for him to reply, but he just stood there staring at me. Maybe he really was a hermit who just wasn’t used to interacting with people anymore. I gave him a few more seconds to respond, but he just glared at me. His short, curly hair was completely grey and his face wrinkled. He had to be at least in his late 60s and his garments had seen better days as well. His robe had holes and tears and the wooden cross around his neck had splintered and was stained. I thought he might have taken a vow of silence, but that would be very unusual for a catholic priest.   
  
I decided to give it another try, maybe he did not speak English? The White Fathers, the first missionaries, were French, so maybe he was with them. "Excusez moi, monsieur, je suis… uh… perdu et je cherche…“ He cut me off. "I understand you perfectly fine!“ His demeanor didn’t change. I was even more uncomfortable now. "Oh, I’m sorry, I was just wondering if you could help me out? I am lost and I really need a place to stay. Maybe some f…“ He cut me off again. "No!“ he barked. "You cannot stay here!“ I wanted to argue, but I also felt creeped out and the prospect of sleeping outside seemed less scary than staying here with him. I nodded in defeat. "I understand. Thank you none the less.“ I was about to turn away, when he raised his hand a little and his features softened, slightly. "There is a small village, just behind this hill. Walk further on the path and you will find it.“ His hand dropped again. "You shall find food and shelter there.“ I looked back at the path to see where exactly he had pointed and when I turned back to thank him he had already closed the door.   
  
The sun had set and it would be dark soon. The lone priest had given no information about the duration of the trip to the village so I walked as fast as I could. About 30 minutes later it was too dark to see and I pulled out my phone. I had used it on the bus ride and had only 42% left, but it should be enough to keep the flashlight going for a while.   
  
Finally, after about an hour the jungle opened up and the trail became flatter. I had entered a huge clearing and in the middle, between some trees, I could see lights and a few buildings reflecting it. As I came closer I saw movement. Some people walking about, talking amongst themselves. They became quiet when they noticed me and it seemed like they were calling someone over.   
  
A tall man in colorful garments, carrying a flashlight, approached me. Some electric lights turned on and I could see there were other people standing behind him. He turned off the flashlight.   
  
I stopped and raised my hand in greeting. The man smiled.   
  
"Hello Stranger. Lost, are you?“ He spoke kindly and I could not detect any hostility or even weariness in his voice. The people behind him looked relaxed and a bit curious. The man must be the headman of the village, a chief who acts as a kind of mayor.   
  
"Hello. I am indeed lost. I was on my way to the mission. I must have made a wrong turn.“ I smiled apologetically. The headman burst out laughing and the small crowd behind him snickered a bit as well.   
  
"Wrong turn?“ He laughed again. "My friend, the mission is over 30 km away from here.“ His laughter faded into a pitiful smile again.   
  
"Come. You stay here tonight. A car will take you to the mission tomorrow. You must be hungry. Eat with us!“ He stepped to the side and gestured towards the village in a welcoming manner, prompting me to join them.   
  
The small crowd scattered and only some children and teenagers lingered, trying to get a glimpse of the lost stranger. The village was truly small. I counted eight proper buildings and eleven wooden huts. The headman brought me a plate with Nshima, a type of corn meal, with several relishes and a piece of fish. A simple meal but I still count this as one of the best meals I ever had. A true blessing after my arduous journey.   
  
I sat before the headman’s hut on a little chair in front of a little table and after he brought me the food he went back in, came out again with a tea pot and two cups and sat down next to me. He asked about my journey and why I wanted to visit the mission. I explained everything to him. How I studied to become a priest and about my six months in Malawi. He seemed content with my story and told me that this village was mostly catholic as well.   
  
I asked him about the village and the surrounding area. What life was like so far out in the forest and we talked for a little while. Later, a few of the young men from the village joined us and I repeated my story about how I was becoming a priest and why I came to Malawi. Remembering my encounter on the hill top earlier, I wanted to ask if they did not have a priest in their village, but the headman stood up before I could say anything.   
  
"We have to rest now and you do too.“ He looked at me and I stood up. The others got up as well and went back to their homes. The headman showed me a small hut next to his house. "You can sleep here.“ I nodded, thanked him and tried to settle in for the night.   
  
The hut was frugally furnished, containing a bed, a nightstand and nothing else. It would suffice. I looked at my watch: 9.55 p.m. – I was tired. The bed was more like a cot, but I fell asleep immediately.   
  
I awoke from a soft knock on the door. I sat up and checked my watch 11.52 p.m. Who could that be? A second knock, a bit more forceful this time. "Yeah? Who is it?“ I said sleepily. The door opened just a bit and one of the young men from the village poked his head inside. He seemed nervous and I gave him a questioning look.   
  
He came inside, closed the door and explained. "My father died today. I did not want to say anything before, because I did not want you to feel obligated to perform a service or partake in the ceremonies.“ I was not sure why he felt it was necessary to wake me just to tell me that, but he continued. "We are leaving now for another village, as it is custom. You have to come with us.“ This confused me even more and I could only blurt out "Why?“ The young man stuck his head out of the door for a second, as if to see if anyone was listening. When he spoke again he came a bit closer and his voice was hushed. "Bad things befall the people who stay.“ He said with a look of gravity on his face that made me uncomfortable. I did not want to leave and I definitely do not believe in demons, ghosts or any superstition so I thought about it for a moment. If I would promise to stay behind and watch over the corpse and say some prayers it might strengthen their faith if they come back and all is well. A bit of selfishness crept up in me as well, because the thought of being the hero was also something I would certainly like. Especially after my unsuccessful adventure the day before.   
  
"Do not worry“ I said. "I will watch over your deceased father and protect him with my faith. I will say some prayers for him to aid his passing into the afterlife.“ I felt a bit stupid saying that and guilty as well, as I was indeed deceiving them, even if my motives weren’t entirely selfish.   
  
His incredulous eyes went wide. "No! It’s dangerous! You need to come with us.“ I assured him my faith was strong enough to keep any ill minded spirits at bay and that he could leave me behind in good conscience. He was catholic, after all, but I felt the old heathen religions still had hold over these people. Finally, he gave in and we went to inform the chief.   
  
When I stepped out of my hut, everyone was out and about and some had already left. The headman was concerned about my idea as well, but he eventually gave in. He told me he believed in my faith, but that I should not take this danger lightly. Of what nature this danger actually was, he could not say. Or did not want to.   
  
I was led to a hut, similar to mine, but bigger, where the deceased was laid out. Candles were burning around him and a cross hanging behind his head on the wall. In contrast to this Christian symbol there was a table with offerings at his feet. He had a cloth draped over his body that only left his head exposed. His eyes were closed. He looked pale, as his blood had begun to pool in the lower parts of his body.   
  
By 12.42 a.m. the village was empty and nothing could be heard, but crickets and the occasional bird. I went into the hut and said some prayers before going outside again to keep watch. An hour passed. Then another. I was so tired.   
  
Finally I decided to just lay down next to the corpse for a while to get at least a little bit of sleep. Hopefully the villagers would not catch me sleeping, but then again, I saved the corpse from being stolen by demons. Or whatever it was, that they were so afraid of.   
  
The ground was hard, but I was just as tired and thus sleep swept me away in no time.   
  
It was a sound that woke me up. Like something was being dragged along the ground. My first thought was, that the villagers had returned and I felt smug because I managed to wake up before they could catch me sleeping. A glance at my watch, however, revealed that it was merely 3.41 a.m. – long before dawn.   
  
I sat up straight. Alert. The dragging sound came closer until it stopped right before the door that separated me from the outside. It must be an animal. An alligator, maybe? But I had seen no river.   
  
The door didn’t have a lock, just a thin, metal latch. I could hear a low growling coming from behind the door.   
  
Then **BAM!** The door was punched with force and I scrambled backwards, now leaning against the wall.   
  
The next punch ripped the latch from the wall and the door swung open. I stared into the most hideous, red eyes I had ever seen, embedded into the head of a disgustingly deformed creature. Apart from a few strands of hair the abomination was bald. Its form hunched over and seemingly decaying. The dim candle light made its rotting skin seem even more yellowish. It was covered in sores and blisters and some parts of its body were so badly affected by the apparent decay, that muscles were showing. The arms were strangely elongated and its hands thick and claw-like. I wanted to scream but no sound emerged from my throat. I wanted to jump to my feet, but my body would not listen. I was completely paralysed.   
  
The creature crawled forward and put its gaze away from me, focusing now on the corpse before it. A meaty claw swiped away the small table with offerings and it began to crawl on top of the deceased man until it was completely on top of him.   
  
Its mouth opened, revealing a set of pointy, rotten teeth. For a second it seemed like it was about to kiss him, but then it ripped off the dead man’s cheek and started do devour it gleefully.   
  
My paralysed body lay still beside it, witnessing the ordeal, while my mind was screaming. I could not look, nor could I look away.   
  
It tore the body apart, devouring it until nothing was left, not even a single bone.   
  
The abomination crept away afterwards, only looking back for a second. And then it was gone.   
  
When dawn came I began to feel normal again and my paralysis vanished. When I finally managed to get up and stumble out of the hut, I could already see the villagers returning. I ran towards the headman and the young man, still shaken deeply.   
  
I told them all about what happened, expecting them to be terrified, but they just nodded wistfully. "I told you it was dangerous.“ Said the young man, passing me to inspect the hut. "We appreciate your service friend.“ Said the headman and put his hand on my shoulder. "No one performs a proper, religious service here for our dead. We are grateful.“   
  
I was still taken aback. "But why don’t you let the priest up on the hill perform the services?“ I said. The headman frowned. "There is no priest up on that hill my friend. You are mistaken.“ I could not make sense of what I had witnessed during the night, but I know that I had met that priest. How else would I have gotten directions? "But I saw him! I met him yesterday – up on that hill“ I pointed to where I had come from. "He was the one who gave me directions to your village.“   
  
The headman had this pitiful look on his face again, like he did when I had told him I was lost. "There hasn’t been a priest here for over 40 years and the one who was here did not live up on this hill.“ He finally concluded. Still, I was not satisfied. "But the hermitage up on the hill – the building with the little tower, surely you know it?“ I asked, hoping that he would at least confirm that.   
  
He shook his head. "You have been through a lot. Maybe you should sort your thoughts at the mission. I can assure you, however, that there is no building up on that hill.“   
  
I looked at the headman. He was about 50 years old and must know the area pretty well. Besides, what reason would he have to lie now, after everyone was so upfront about the demon, or whatever that thing was. A shudder went through my body just thinking about it.   
  
"Look, friend, a car can take you to the mission later today. You will find some rest there.“   
  
I nodded and agreed, but asked the headman if he would mind me going up the path again, just to make sure the hermitage did not exist. He was indifferent and told me he would hold on to my belongings until I would return.   
  
I was still sleep deprived and shaken, but I needed to know if I was crazy. I needed to know who the priest up on that hill was.   
  
In the daylight I could find the path back up easily, but now it went uphill, which slowed me down. After 1,5 hours I finally managed to reach the top. And there it was.   
  
The hermitage was sitting there, just like I remembered it. The sand colored bricks, glowing in the sun.   
  
My heart was pounding when I knocked on the door again. Just like the day before I heard the rustling of clothes and the shuffling of feet before the old priest opened the door again.   
  
He recognized me immediately and this time he did not just stare, he stepped aside to open the door a bit wider and said "Please. Come in.“   
  
The hermitage had a little "lobby“, a room before the main room with a staircase to the left that lead up the little tower. He opened the second door into the main room and closed both doors behind us once I was inside.   
  
The room looked rather nice. A big bed with mosquito curtains stood in the corner, couches to sit on in the middle of the room and a desk against the wall. A little kitchen was there as well. It seemed really homely for a place so remote.   
  
He pointed towards the couch and I sat down. He did the same, across from me.   
  
His demeanor was sad and guilty. He looked towards the ground before he began to speak. "I owe you an apology. I did not intend for you to witness what you did last night.“ I was frozen in my seat. "I never intended for you to see my true form.“ I was still frozen, staring incredulously at the old priest. "I lived a long and selfish life. As a priest I only cared for one member of my community and that was me. All the food and clothes I was given, I took it for myself. Knowing all too well, that others needed it more. That’s why this curse befell me and after I died I turned into… Well, you saw what I turned into.“ I began to wake from my stupor, only slowly comprehending the fantastic tale I had just heard.   
  
"But, how long have you lived like this? After your death I mean.“ He pondered for a moment. "I do not know what year it is and I don’t much care anymore.“ He paused. "My death happened a long time ago and I deserve my punishment.“ I still could not understand how he managed to elude the villagers for so long. "I asked the headman about this place and he told me that there was no building on this hill. How could you stay hidden for so long?“   
  
He smiled for the first time. "Because only a man of faith can see my abode.“ I thought about that for a second. "But I am not a priest yet?“ He nodded. "Not yet, but you have already decided in your heart, that you want to dedicate your life to worship. That is enough, I believe.“ It started to make sense to me. The headman had told me, that there hadn’t been a priest here for a long time, so no one could have seen the hermitage. Yet, I was still in denial that this was truly happening. Maybe I actually was insane…   
  
He looked at me and began to speak again. "Could you free me from this curse? I do not know if it could even work, but could you try and perform a service for me? A requiem. A mass for the dead.“ I pondered the idea but finally nodded in approval.   
  
„All right. I will do my best to release your spirit into the afterlife.“   
  
I did what he had proposed and kneeled before him, saying my prayers and performing the mass. As I was done I opened my eyes and looked up.   
  
He was gone and the hermitage nothing more than some rubble and a few loose stones spread around the hill top. In front of me was nothing but a tombstone that read:   
  
*Mahavir Renault – 1861 to 1949*   
  
I don’t know what this means and if this was a sign from god or the devil or something in between. But it has strengthened my faith ever since.
