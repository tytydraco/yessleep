So there I was, aiming my rifle at a spot in the treeline when out comes this three-eyed buck. 

It was dipping its head low, skimming its nose along the grass. I peeked out from behind an oak tree about a hundred fifty yards back, at a slight incline. I was stunned. All I could do was watch. 

The buck found its spot and began nibbling at the grass. While its natural eyes focused on what it was eating, its third eye rolled around inside its socket, back and forth, back and forth, scanning its surroundings. It even blinked at its own rate.

It was an incredible genetic mutation. The exact kind of thing I was looking for.

I was laying flat on the ground behind my rifle. I glided my point of aim off its eye, up its neck, and placed it just above its right shoulder. Right over the heart. I couldn't help but smile. Because today was my lucky day. This head would make a remarkable trophy. 

I brushed my index finger over the trigger. And took a breath. Over the trees, the sun was setting. Everything bathed inside a golden glow. The air was crisp and the heat of my breath rose and fogged the glass on my scope. I held it in. Steadied my aim. Blonde highlights streaked in the buck’s chocolatey-brown fur. It was gorgeous. And its life was at the tip of my finger. 

The buck crept forward a little, quartering off to the left, decentering my shot. As it angled itself, I saw a fifth leg protruding out its backside. I pushed that out of my mind. Focused. I floated my point of aim right back to its heart. Then I counted a few beats and shuffled in place to get comfortable. A few leaves crunched underneath me. 

The eye flicked up. And then narrowed. 

I squeezed the trigger. 

Within the half second it took the bullet to strike, the buck jerked left. Then it stumbled, snapped around and darted back into the treeline, brushing by a faded sign that said “Radiation Zone. Keep out.”

My eyes lingered on that sign and on the empty spot in the trees. A sense of failure sank down into my stomach like an anchor in water. Then, a burning sensation blazed inside my chest. I exhaled sharply through my teeth.   
  
*Stupid, worthless piece of… I had that shot. I had it. I had it. I had it. Why the* hell *did I move?*

I stood up, glaring at the oak tree and winded my rifle back. I was ready to break it in half and chop wood while I was at it. I hated missing. I hated it so bad. A split second before my swing, I was struck with a realization. 

I paused. Let the rifle drop to my side. That was a good hit. I’d hit that dead on. I glanced through the scope. Against the fading light, a spot of blood was glistening. 

I sank down against the tree and folded my rifle across my lap. Beside me, my bag also leaned against the tree. I dug inside and pulled out my flask. Took a drink. And began thinking.

The buck was on the run, but I bet it didn’t go far. I bet it didn’t go far at all. But that being said, if I chase it immediately, I could scare it off. Make it run even deeper into the woods. That would be stupid. When this happens on a hunt, the standard wait time is thirty minutes. Minimum. 

I glanced up at a sliver of sunlight disappearing behind the trees. 

In thirty minutes, there would be no more sunlight. I would be tracking inside an unfamiliar forest in total darkness. 

I took another drink, then started thinking about my dad. He’d hate this. To him, hunting was purely for sustenance. Shoot *only* what you can eat, and nothing more. I’ve always disagreed. 

When you feel the rush, the excitement, the thrill of hunting an animal down and earning its life, it’s unforgettable. It’s like a high. It’s intimate. It is the most delicate exchange you can ever have with another living thing. Even more so than sex. I’m not kidding. Nothing compares. 

But like anything else, novelty fades. 

In my twenties, after dad died, the thrill was gone. What once was my main source of happiness became routine. It's like when you first start driving. When you turn the wheel for the first time, it's like you’ve discovered fire. It’s magic. But let a year go by…well, like I said. It’s just like anything else. And you can only regain the magic by finding a new way of doing things.

And that’s when I discovered this place. Enterprise Radiation Forest. 

During WW1, the U.S. government used a small area inside this forest in Wisconsin to test the effects of radiation on wildlife. They wanted to observe the horrible ways it would alter the trees, insects, and animals, so if the U.S. was ever hit, we’d know what to expect. 

The locals hated it. Politicians fought them at every turn to shut it down. So even though the project was set to be funded for twenty years, the money was cut after one. 

This site is no longer radioactive. But when I read that its wildlife was permanently altered, I had to see for myself. Of course, *hunting* here was highly illegal. But that was all part of the fun.

So that decided it for me. I wasn’t mad that the buck ran. I was happy. This was all just build-up for the main event. Now it was a real hunt. Sunlight or no sunlight, I was taking home my trophy. 

I set a thirty minute timer on my watch. 

Then I pumped another bullet in the chamber, loaded a fresh battery into my infrared scope and, for good measure, also popped a fresh battery into my red-bulb headlamp. When you hunt at night, you have to use red light because animals are less sensitive to that color.

Thirty minutes passed, and my watch beeped. I was good and tipsy by then. I slung my rifle over my shoulder and started down the slope toward the blood. Now it was dark.

A freezing pocket of wind snapped by and tore through my jacket. I rubbed my hands together, blowing into them to regain feeling as I reached the bottom of the slope. I looked down at the blood.

It was dark brown and had already coagulated because of the cold. A rancid smell permeated upward, and several tufts of brown hair were curled up inside. These were good signs. 

Dark brown blood with an awful smell means a gut shot. A gut shot means a quick death. Honestly, I was shocked it even made it inside the woods. It guessed it was close by. 

Several beads of blood trailed into the woods. I followed, passing by the warning sign, and stepped into the forest. 

I walked alongside a few more droplets, then the trail cut off. I scanned around, looking for a continuation. The red beam of my headlamp swept across trees that grew into one another, their trunks twisting into hideous formations. In front of me, a maple tree broke out with hundreds of red-capped mushrooms that erupted across its bark out like a rash. 

Off to the right, I spotted a leaf with several droplets of blood. I crunched in that direction for several yards and hit a second large patch of blood. 

Based on how it was pooled, the buck probably stopped there to rest. That floored me. The fact that it could stop, rest, then keep going with a gut shot was an absolute marvel. This thing was tough as nails. Then I noticed something inside the blood. 

Several more clumps of hair were curled up, but they were a different color than before. This hair was red. It was the hair of a completely different animal. How was that possible? The odds of another wounded animal crossing this exact path was astronomically low. 

My best guess was fox hair, but I knew that was a stretch. The texture was off. I moved deeper into the forest. I had to be getting close. Had to be. 

Sure enough, I picked up more trail and followed it a few yards. I stopped when something was glowing in front of my face. 

Stretched between two trees about ten feet apart was a spiderweb so big, it must’ve taken an army to build. A network of asymmetrical patterns spiraled inward to form a web. In its center, a plump spider hung there, twitching. Inches from my face. 

It looked like it was having a seizure. Its legs were long like fingers. Its skin was translucent, and inside its body I could see these little blue veins pulsing. Expanding and contracting. 

I backed off, slowly. And as I did, the spider’s body quit quivering. It just dangled there, motionless, bouncing lightly in the wind. 

Then something burst underneath it and hundreds, maybe thousands of baby spiders flooded out. They crawled all over each other to get out from underneath their mother. Then they were spreading out, exploring the web. 

I’ve been an outdoorsman for a long time. I’ve seen a lot of crazy things in the wild. But nothing like that. That messed me up. I made a wide berth around those trees and tried to forget what I’d just seen. I wished the buck would just show up already. The more forest I saw, the less I wanted to be there. 

I continued along the trail, picking up a drop here, a drop there. And to my amazement, I had to walk another two-hundred yards before I hit a clearing in the trees. Then I found it.

The buck’s body lay flat on its side, crumpled into a heap. I studied its belly, watching for a rise and fall. But it laid still. Finally, it had dropped dead. “There you are,” I whispered.

A twig snapped behind me. 

I turned, sweeping my light across the trees. There was nothing there. I turned back. 

Based on where I’d shot it, most other bucks would’ve folded instantly, if not several feet later. But this buck. This buck traveled the distance of about three football fields with a hole blasted through its intestine. It was absolute insanity.

I could only assume that the animals in these woods had to be unnaturally tough because people made them that way. People imposed forces on them that should have made life here impossible. They should have been erased. But instead, they adapted. That’s what life does. Above all else, it wants to exist. 

Suddenly, I felt an immense respect for that buck. Then I felt guilty. I never should have come here. Life for these creatures was hard enough without me coming along and dipping my thumb in. Lesson learned. Once again, Dad was right. I kept realizing that the older I got.

However—

Since I was already here, and since the buck was already dead, shouldn’t I do my best to honor it? Commemorate its perseverance against impossible odds? The natural answer seemed to be yes. I would bring its head home and mount it on the wall for all to see. 

I stepped into the clearing and, while I approached, dug around in my bag for my bone saw. Because I wasn’t field dressing the entire buck, this wouldn’t take long. I only needed the head.

Before I found my saw, my headlamp flickered a little bit, which surprised me. It was on a fresh battery. Luckily, I had spares if I needed them. 

I stood over the buck and sensed something odd in how it was laying on its side. Something was unnatural about it. Then I realized that it wasn’t laying on its side at all. *It* wasn’t even there. Only its skin. 

The buck skin was slumped over a rock which created an illusion of mass, but its body was actually missing. Gone. I could see now that its cheeks were hollowed out, its stomach was stretched over the rock like a blanket over a chair, and its legs were coiled underneath it like ropes. My heart jumped. *The buck had shed its skin.* 

Then my light flickered, dimmed, and died. Everything turned black. I tore my headlamp off my head, clicked the button a few times, and then banged on it. That did nothing.

I needed those batteries. 

I dropped to my knees, tore my bag off my shoulder, and fumbled around for the zipper. After a few passes, my fingers brushed metal. I zipped it open and fished around, feeling for the plastic packaging.

The teeth of the bone saw nicked my arm, sending up a bright jolt of pain. My skin was now slick with blood. I forced out a laugh to calm myself down. *We’re alright. Everything’s fine. I’ll just find those batteries, load them up, and leave. Simple and easy.* 

Something moved behind me. 

I stood, snapping the rifle off my shoulder. I used my thermal scope to glass the area where I heard the noise. If anything was there, its body heat would be highlighted in white. But I only saw a landscape of deformed trees and a bed of dead leaves below. Something was definitely there. It just didn’t want to be seen. 

All my senses shifted into overdrive. My brain was scrambling, trying to take in everything at once, attempting to pinpoint the threat. I was losing it.

I took off in the direction I thought I had come from while using my rifle scope to see which made running fast impossible. I stumbled over tree roots, dead branches, protrusions in the ground that hid underneath my field of vision. Then my foot struck something solid. I stumbled forward, dropping the rifle but catching myself against a tree. My hands squished on something. Then it began moving around. 

I shoved against the tree and threw myself onto the ground, then began feeling around in the dark. I had to get that rifle. I swept in front of me, turned left, swept some more, turned again, and struck the butt of the gun. I snatched it and shot back up into a run. 

Behind me, something also started running. Four legs pounded the ground with incredible speed. Once I heard it, I twisted around and fired off a warning shot to let it know that I was still a threat. That I still had power. 

When I turned back around I hit something sticky. I felt tickling across my face and inside my scalp. I glanced down. Dozens of glowing dots crawled all over my jacket. I’d run through that spiderweb. 

I swiped at my body and tore at my hair, fighting to get them off. But their little bodies stuck on like glue. I tore into my backpack and yanked out the flask, then sprinkled whiskey on my head and smeared it around. Once the alcohol soaked in, the tickling slowed to a stop.

I had totally lost control over this situation. If I kept running like this, I was going to die. I didn’t know these woods. Whatever was chasing me did. I needed somewhere to camp. I needed *it* to come to *me*. 

I scanned around. Several yards away was a rockface. If I put my back against that, I could cut off at least one angle of attack. It wasn’t much, but it was something.

I sprinted over to it. The position was even better than I’d initially thought. Because a little hole was carved out at the bottom. A hole I could tuck my body into. And wait. 

I dropped down and scooted in back-first, clinging onto my rifle. The fit was tight. But it was just big enough. I settled in. Then scanned outside the hole, testing my sights. 

I was on my left side, at a tough angle. But I was positive I could still make something happen. As soon as I had a visual, I’d aim for the head and take a shot. I’d already spent one bullet, so I had four more left. Four chances. 

I’d have to be quiet now. I knew its hearing was sharp. It heard me crunch a leaf earlier from a hundred fifty yards away. To catch it by surprise, I’d need to lie perfectly still. 

So I became motionless, watching through my rifle, listening to the quick thud of my heart. I was barely breathing.

From somewhere off to the right, I heard the crunching of leaves. Coming from right outside the hole. I wanted to scope in that direction. But I was scared that the shifting required to do that would make too much noise. Instead I waited for it to move into my scope. 

The footsteps grew closer. To check where it was in relation to me, I inched my eye out from the scope. A dark shape crawled into view. Only this wasn’t the shape of an animal. It was the shape of a human being. Crawling on all fours. Their head was hunched low to the ground, staring at something past the hole, but creeping right in front of me. 

Even though we were no more than two feet apart, it was unaware of my presence. I remained motionless. It was almost directly in my line of sight. I hovered my finger over the trigger.

Then something tickled out from my hairline, and tiny legs prickled down the center of my forehead. When the spider reached the point between my eyes, it paused. Its body was glowing in my periphery. My reflexes screamed at my hand to swat at it, to smack it dead. But that would mean an almost certain death for me. I had to remain perfectly still. 

As the humanoid creature crawled directly in front of my gun, the spider climbed to the tip of my nose, then hung down by a web. Needle-like legs brushed against my lips and then walked around, exploring the soft flesh around my mouth. I didn’t move a muscle. It traveled down my chin, then down my neck and into the front of my shirt.

Outside the hole, the creature was looking off to the left. Then it paused, like it was picking something up. Its ears were twitching. My gun was now aimed too far to the right. I was so frozen in fear, so paralyzed, I didn’t dare move. It was too close. Its head turned toward the hole,  by just an inch. I held onto the air inside my lungs for dear life. Then it turned another inch, and another, and then it looked directly at me. Right inside the hole. 

Then it turned the other direction and crawled away, showing me its back. It must have been hunting me by sound. 

I let it get its distance. Then I moved my eye back inside the scope. There it was. Right in my sight. I drifted the reticle onto the back of its head. Its neck rolled left. I followed. Then waited. After it stayed there a few seconds, my finger touched the trigger and began applying pressure. Something sharp stung my chest. 

The reticle veered and I fired off target. Its head twisted backwards, straight at me. That was the first time I got a good look at it. 

It was wearing my face.

My hands trembled as I lined the reticle up again, right between the eyes and fired off a second shot. It ducked right, sprang back up and charged forward. 

I fired off a third. 

It cut left, like it knew exactly when I’d shoot before I pulled the trigger.

It darted within five feet of me. 

I aimed straight for the head and squeezed out the final bullet as it sprang up from the ground. It landed head-first inside the hole, twitching on top of me. Then it stopped twitching, and its body became very still. A warmth started seeping into my shirt. It was bleeding out. 

I struggled against the dead weight and finally pushed it far enough from the opening to squeeze myself out. 

I stood to my feet, then doubled over and vomited. Then my legs gave out at the knees and I buckled back onto the ground. I had to struggle to pick myself back up. A pressure was building in my head. I felt like my eyes were going to pop.

Once I was steady enough, I lifted the rifle to look at what I’d shot. It was lying on its back, and I could see I’d tagged it directly in the heart, completely by accident. It was a lucky shot. A miracle.

\*\*\*

I am now sitting in my wheelchair by the fireplace. I’m in my hunting room. Save for the light flickering off the fire, the room is dark. Because of the migraines, this is all my eyes can handle.

Fire has a funny way of painting a room. I’m noticing things on my walls that I haven’t noticed in years.

The fire sparkles inside the dark eyes of my trophy mounts. It gleams against the shiny metal of my first rifle. It glares off the picture frames which display past hunting trips. All these things represent the good times. This room is an extension of myself. These relics are all pieces of me. As I look around, I wonder if I’ll ever get to add anything else, or if my final addition has already been made.

See, my health hasn’t been so good these past few weeks. When I was stung, a poison was injected inside of me that my body can’t seem to fight off. 

First, I lost the fine motor skills in my hands, so now I can’t aim a rifle. Then I lost the use of my legs. I can’t go to work or even leave my house without help. And now my vision is on the way out. The migraines are so bad, I’m seeing double. When they flare up, it feels like two icepicks pounding against both my temples, over and over again.

My girlfriend has stopped coming around. She won’t even answer my calls. I guess she finds this all too depressing. I can’t really blame her.

Maybe I brought this on myself. Maybe this is punishment for treating hunting like it's a game. If so, I accept it. But I wish my repentance would lighten the pain, even if just a little. I’m hurting all the time now. It’s all I can think about. 

I’m just glad Dad isn’t around to see this. It makes me want to cry, thinking about him and our days we spent hunting together. When I close my eyes, I can still hear the sound of his voice as he took me hunting for the first time. He was so young then. We both were. There we were, on our elbows, peeking over a dead tree and studying this buck. It was a thing of beauty. 

I had my rifle on it, and I felt him whispering from over my shoulder, telling me exactly where to aim, exactly how to breathe. To stay calm. My fingers were shaking so badly I could barely hold the rifle. But he told me that everything was alright. He told me not to be afraid, because what we were doing was all part of a cycle. It was an act of violence, but it would be followed by an act of love. Once I took the buck’s life, he said, our family would have food for six months.

Dad’s been gone a few years, but he still talks to me. The sound of his voice is so clear in my head now. It comforts me. It's like hearing the words of an angel. 

But what would he think of me now? All these mistakes I’ve made? These trophy heads on my wall? Would he forgive me? 

Mounted right in front of me is my own head. All three of my dead, cold eyes stare back at me. They mock me and how I’ve lived my life. A sick paradox. It's like nature is getting the last laugh. What would dad think of that? 

Sometimes, I can’t even explain to myself why I do some of the things I do. I look within, but the answers are in some place that’s too deep and too dark for me to reach. Or maybe I just don’t want to look. 

Somehow, I think things will work out the way they’re supposed to. Maybe my pain will be gone soon. Maybe I’ll see my dad again. And by then, maybe I will have found some answers for him. 

Then maybe he can find it in his heart to forgive me. I’ll give him a hug, and I’ll tell him how sorry I am. That he was right about everything. Then, finally, we can grab our rifles and go hunting together again.
