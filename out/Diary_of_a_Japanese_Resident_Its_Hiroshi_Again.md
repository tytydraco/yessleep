Hey, it's me again, Hiroshi Nakamura. Things are worse now, much worse. When I wrote before, I talked about Minakami and how strange everything was, but now... it can't be denied anymore. Everything is out of control, and I feel like every day we're getting closer to the end.

Two days ago, I noticed something strange with the tap water. We haven't used it since what happened with Mr. Tanaka, but I tried to check it out of curiosity. It looked murky, with a strange color, like something floating in it. There was also a weird smell, something like stagnant water, but more sour. I told my wife not to touch it, to stay away. But this morning, I found her in the kitchen, standing in front of the sink, the tap running. She wasn't doing anything, just staring at the water as it flowed, her lips moving, whispering something I couldn't understand. Her eyes... they were like Mr. Tanaka's. Empty. Lost.

I had to shake her to snap her out of it, and when I finally turned off the tap, it was like she woke up from a bad dream. I didn't say anything to her, but I'm scared. It's in the water. I know it. And it's calling us, little by little, all of us. Sometimes I catch her looking at the sink again, and I don't know how to bring her back. We used to laugh together, even at the simplest things, but now we barely speak. When I see her like that, I feel like I'm already losing her, and that hurts more than any fear.

Today I saw something that made me realize how bad everything is. There were soldiers on the street, all in special suits, blocking access to the Sumida River. I saw a woman with them. She was bound, screaming like she'd been doing it for hours. Her eyes were an eerie red, and something black was coming out of her mouth, like thick, dark vomit. The soldiers didn't try to help her. They just took her to the water, pushing her toward the river. One of them muttered something I barely caught: "She's not human anymore." It made it clear to me that there's no hope for those taken by the water.

My wife and I have sealed the windows and doors, but sometimes I feel it won't be enough. Every day that passes, the water feels closer. The government keeps saying on TV that everything is under control, but it's a lie. I've seen people vanish, hospitals overflowing, and soldiers acting like they know there's no solution.

Last night I heard someone in our building's hallway, banging on doors and shouting for water. No one opened. No one wanted to get close. I went to the door and looked through the peephole. I saw a man, his hands bloody from all the banging, his eyes completely red. He was murmuring something, but I couldn't understand it. In the end, there was only silence. I don't know if he left, if he died, or if the water took him, but the silence was worse than the shouting.

I don't know how much longer we can hold out. Sometimes, when I close my eyes, I think I see something in the water, moving. A shadow, something small, like a thin tentacle disappearing before I can focus on it. Maybe there is no hope for us. If anyone reads this, please, do everything you can to stay away from the water. Whatever is in there, it's stronger than we thought. It's taking control.

Please, is this happening in your countries too? Is it only here in Japan? Can someone respond, please please?
