It’s kinda based of the elements in fantasy games/the elements and if they were people… -> Please leave pointers for me to read and improve on! (I don’t write much..)


“Me and Eve went into the battle against shades confident, we really did. I was going to propose to her that evening so I thought this battle would move on quick as me and my wonderful wife were the best in spells of that era… Oh how I was wrong. The gore, the.. the pain of that war. It lasted the longest out of any we have been in, it was a year and five months. Eve went out with her tropes to well kill the last of them off, now I wish I went with her… when the final horn went showing we won this devilish war I went searching for Eve. It was a happy search before… I saw it stabbing her in cold blood… It just looked at me as it plunged its dagger through her heart, it had such an evil grin that I just was lost in a rage… I killed it with decay, but that… that monster took my only love away from me.. my light… my Eve… I won’t say I didn’t get her to a healer and even tried healing my love myself but.. it was to no avail, she was killed. I’ve lost her to the sick monsters of that war, to that monster. I guess loosing her made me loose myself, I’ve been told I lack empathy. But never been told it wasn’t my fault, or it’s okay… it’s always yelling and screaming. Bold of me to think this school would be a safe place… I miss my sun.. I wish, I just wish I got there sooner and maybe she’d still be here and not just an energy floating around with the rest of ‘em…” 

That’s when I finally seemed to take a breather, and seem to relax enough to drink my wine. Looking up at the gentleman across from me, Adam. The nature guardian, who seemed to be leaning back almost… to tears? He’s a strange one, out of the two of us I’d say I’m the hotter one really since I have red hair and he has boring brown to green hair. His eyes are like a mossy brown I’d give him that they are pretty, while mine are a dark sapphire that seem to get darker shades of red closer to winter, and his just light up with colours. What a show off really. Not even a show of erosion on his arms from the magic we have; it’s so unfair. 

“Lilith, I was there… Remember? We took her to Sam the healer, and it failed. I remember it, your… voice the scream it was covered in the pain of loosing her. But don’t go mad…” He sunk more into his chair at that, what was he going to say? He look scared? Worried? 

“You need therapy, and not more adoptive children… Therapy. With a real therapist…” Oh. Thats what it was, how bold of him to say that. I’m fine, just needed a drink.. 

“Trust me Lilith you need one… You can’t keep telling this story everytime you get to go out drinking, it’s not a healthy-“ 

I don’t want to hear more of this, guess I… May of over reacted a smudge… I mean I did tell the tale. “Adam! I just want to drink along with telling the story. But here, take the shells. I’m going home..” Okay, okay… I admit I’m wrong for leaving him after dumping the tale onto him again, and leaving him with more than enough shells to pay for our drinks. But I can’t do therapy again… I’m what now… 18 thousand years old? It’s the modern ages for Christ sake! No one even remembers the fight at all now, they only know the tale of the Dark killing Light… I wish that wasn’t what was remembered… but rather our burning love and the pain of the years without her. I miss her honest, therapy burns more of a gaping wound where she is missing. I won’t feel that again. Never again. That’s the last time I’ll drink, my work needs me. The academy needs me… I’ll email Adam later with an apology, right now. I need sleep…
