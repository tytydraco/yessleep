No one ever tells you how difficult it is to scrub blood from white walls—how the stains sink in, a permanent reminder of what was lost. I learned this from waking up in a body that wasn’t mine, with a mind that buzzed with life not of my own. The world around me smelled of earth and rain, and I could taste the residue of sweet bread on a tongue unfamiliar to me. For a moment, I struggled to remember who I was, what I was.

But then, it came back—the mission. To observe. To study. To report. And in doing so, to protect my own kind by researching signs of resilience and quality of life. I was sent to this world, this place where life teemed and thrived in ways, unlike my own dimension of light and energy. But something had gone wrong, and instead of simply observing, I had entered a vessel—a human boy.

The boy’s name was Arthur. He was young, his mind still forming, full of thoughts and dreams as delicate as the lace curtains in the small white house he called home. A house filled with books and the scent of roses, where time seemed to slow down and wrap itself around the walls like ivy.

I hadn’t meant to stay, but the boy’s life was too fascinating to leave. Each day brought new sensations, emotions, and experiences I had never encountered before. Through his eyes, I saw their world in vivid detail—the soft light of dawn streaming through the window, the texture of paper beneath his small fingers as he turned the pages of a book, the sound of his mother’s voice, warm and melodic, as she called him to supper.

But there was something darker, too, something that pulsed beneath the surface. I could feel it in his thoughts, a quiet fear that lurked in the corners of his mind, a dread of something he couldn’t quite name. At first, I thought it stemmed from my own consciousness, a warning of the destruction I had witnessed in other worlds and now began to fear for my human. But as I settled deeper into his mind, I realized it was something else—something that had always been there, waiting for the right moment to reveal itself.

As the days passed, I became more enmeshed in Arthur’s life. I attended his lessons at the old stone school, where the scent of chalk and ink filled the air. I felt his joy as he ran through the fields outside the village, the grass cool beneath his feet. I even shared in his quiet moments, when he would sit by the fire and lose himself in a book, the words forming pictures in his mind that I could almost see.

But there was a disquiet within me. I was no longer just an observer. I was living his life, feeling his emotions, and slowly, I began to forget the boundaries of where he ended and I began.

It was on a particularly quiet evening when I noticed the first sign that something was wrong. Arthur had been playing in the garden, his laughter echoing through the trees, when suddenly, he stopped. His small hands trembled, and he looked around, eyes wide with fear.

“What’s wrong?” I thought, pushing my consciousness forward, trying to soothe him. But instead of answering, he ran to the house, slamming the door behind him. His mother looked up from her knitting, concern knitting her brow.

“What is it, dear?” she asked, but Arthur couldn’t answer. He simply stood there, shaking, his mind a tangle of terror and confusion.

I felt it then—a presence, forceful and abstract, pressing against the edges of his mind. It was unlike anything I had ever known in any world. It had been waiting, lurking in the shadows, feeding off his fear. And now, it had noticed me.

“Who are you?” I demanded, but there was no response, only a low, menacing hum that reverberated through Arthur’s mind, sending shivers through his—our—small frame.

In his music class, I noticed his enthusiasm change into a dark obsession. Arthur had always been a diligent student, his small fingers skillfully playing the notes on the piano. But now, there was a trembling in his hands, his movements erratic. He would stumble over the keys, his face contorted in frustration, as though something was pushing against him over the edge.

His professor, an elderly man with kind eyes and a soft voice, noticed as well. One day, as Arthur lingered after class, the professor approached him, laying a gentle hand on his shoulder. “Arthur, my boy, remember—it's not practice that makes perfect. It’s perfect practice that makes perfect.”

Arthur nodded, but his eyes were distant, clouded by the dark presence that had begun to take hold. The professor’s words were meant to encourage him, but instead, they deepened his anxiety, pushing him to work harder, to strive for a perfection that now seemed impossibly out of reach.

At night, the dark voice whispered to him, filling his dreams with images of failure, of endless, futile attempts to achieve something that would forever elude him. It escalated into macabre scenery; visions of violence committed by his unwilling hands. I tried to comfort him, to push the voice away, but it was stronger now, more insistent, wrapping itself around his thoughts like a bloodsucking leech.

The days were a blur of confusion and fear for us. Arthur’s once-bright mind became clouded with dark thoughts, images of things he could not understand but that lingered like a haunting operatic choir. At night, he would wake screaming, his body drenched in sweat, as the presence crept closer, whispering horrors I could barely comprehend.

His mother grew worried, her eyes dark with sleeplessness as she watched her son grow paler and more withdrawn. She took him to doctors, to priests, but none could help him. None could see the battle raging within his mind, the struggle between the alien visitor and the grueling darkness that had lain dormant for so long.

The dark presence began to manifest in ways I had not anticipated. Arthur would find himself drawn to the bleaker corners of the house, to the basement where the air was thick with the scent of mold and decay. He would sit there for hours, his eyes glazed over, as the voice whispered to him, urging him to do things—terrible things.

One late afternoon, as the sky darkened and the first stars appeared, Arthur took a knife from the kitchen drawer. His hands quivered, but the voice urged him on, pushing him toward something I could not stop. “It’s perfect practice,” it whispered. “Make it perfect, Arthur.”

I fought back, using every ounce of energy I had, but it was futile. The presence was too strong, too deeply rooted in this world. And as I struggled, I felt myself weakening, my hold on Arthur’s mind slipping away.

In the end, I knew what I had to do. I could not save him. But I could save my own kind. I could stop the presence from spreading beyond this small, white house.

With a heavy heart, I withdrew, pulling my consciousness away from Arthur, leaving him to face the darkness alone. I retreated into the void, my mind echoing with his screams as the presence took hold, twisting his thoughts into something monstrous.

I watched, helpless, as Arthur turned the knife on himself, the blade cutting deep into his flesh. Blood sprayed across the walls, spattering the white paint with crimson. He staggered in and out of the house, through the rooms, the blade slipping from his grasp as he fell, leaving a trail of blood behind him. The roses in the garden, so carefully tended by his mother, were stained with red as his life drained away.

Arthur’s mother found him that evening as she returned home from work, his small body cold and lifeless, the once-white sheets folded around him on his bed stained with blood. She screamed, a sound that pierced the air and sent the birds fleeing from the trees. But there was nothing she could do. The presence had won.

But it was contained. I had seen to that.

As I drifted away from the house, from the world, I could only hope that my kind would never find this place, that they would never know the horrors that lay within the fragile minds of these creatures.

And yet, a part of me remained. A small, silent fragment, forever tied to the boy whose life I had lived, whose joys and fears I had shared. A part of me that would forever haunt the white house, where bloodstains never quite fade, and the scent of roses mingle with the harsh tang of dread.

His mother spent days scrubbing the walls, her hands raw from the effort, but the blood never fully disappeared. Outside, the roses bloomed in shades of red that seemed darker than before, as though they had absorbed the last remnants of Arthur’s life.

As I drift away from the house, I realize the irony of my mission. I was meant to study resilience and quality of life, but in the final moments of Arthur's life, I found a depth beyond my understanding. The bloodstains on the white walls will never fully fade, just as the haunting reality of his life will linger with me. It is a truth that transcends the mere data I was meant to collect—that even my kind cannot comprehend—that humans live in a paradox of beauty and horror.
