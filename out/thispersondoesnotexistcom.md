A friend showed me this website, where you can view hi res images of people who don't exist. the images are generated by artificial intelligence and look so real, like photos of people you might know, taken with basic cameras, phones etc, in situations that seem like they could be your backyard, your favorite pub, a park etc.

I scrolled through the images on this site, and for a while it was fascinating, yet uncanny. I constantly felt myself thinking, "hey this person looks familiar" or "hey this looks like so and so"

The experience was fun at first-- novel, somewhat strange: like, how did someone come up with this, and why?

i don't know how long i spent on this site, a few minutes maybe an hour.

Id had my fun and decided to exit the page. "one last one i thought" as i clicked the 'page reload button'

The next face loaded.

Did it? did I accidentally exit the page?

Am i on facebook or something?

I was staring at myself on the screen. 

I looked at the address bar: [thispersondoesnotexist.com](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com)

I looked at my picture for a while. There i was, there was the shirt i was currently wearing, pierchings, glasses. Everything. Even the little scar above my lip where i fell off my bike when i was 8.

What were the odds? i mean people come to this site every day, what were the odds that it could generate a perfect pic of myself?

I was a little shaken, but ftmp undisturbed. I closed my browser and went to bed.

My problems had only begun.

When i woke up, i got ready to meet some friends for coffee, i showed up and everything seemed fine, we all chatted like usual, told funny stories and showed each other memes.

At first i didn't notice, but after a few times it became apparent each one of them were ignoring me more and more, i would speak and no one acknowledged me. I was usually pretty funny, and would tell some very effective jokes. I told what i thought was a banger, and no one made a sound, they kept talking amongst themselves. I practically screamed it again.

"Oh. sorry, I forgot you were there, what was that?"

I had enough, i was pissed so I went home.

I had the week off work, so i wasn't doing anything. I decided to open up yt and watch some stuff.

I would just click on recommended vids and sometimes type stuff in.

Sometimes my mouse wouldn't register a click, so i would have to click several times to get a vid to load. Sometimes as i typed, the keyboard wouldn't register a letter every now and then.

Stupid cheap technology, i remember my old dell keyboard could probably be dropped off a building and still work.

whatever.

I spent the next three days watching vids, and just eating what i had in the fridge.

I was feeling lonely when a friend of mine called. I was so happy to see her name pop up on my caller ID.

I picked up the phone: "god im so glad you called, iv been having such a shit week."

silence.

"hello?" she said.

"yeah, hi, i was just saying how happy i was to hear from you, can you here me?"

"hello? Jay? are you there? hello?"

I screamed in to the phone.

silence.

"okay Jay, its been a few days i dont know if your phone istn working or whatever, but im coming over"

she hung up.

I felt relieved, i think seeing here might cheer me up a bit.

Half an hour later, i heard her key in the lock, why didnt she knock?

The door opned and i greeted her

"oh my god, im glad your here, things have been so wierd--"

"Jay? are you here?"

she looked right past me.

"Jay, this isnt funny, no ones heard from you in weeks?"

Weeks? WEEKS? i thought i was only watching vids for a couplke days.

i went right up to her and screamed in her face.

"IM RIGHT HERE? WTF IS GOING ON?"

i felt i was pretty loud, but then i saw my cat sleeping on the couch, loud sounds usually scare her.

This was getting messed up, my friends aren't the pranking types, and i didn't take them for the type for elaborate jokes.
