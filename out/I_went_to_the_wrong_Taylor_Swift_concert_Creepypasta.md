You wouldn't believe how excited I was to see Taylor Swift. I'd been dreaming about this concert for months, planning every detail, from the glitter on my cheeks to the way I'd scream her name. But let me tell you, that night... it wasn't at all what I expected.  
The concert was at the old Sterling Amphitheater, a place that always gave me the creeps. It was this massive, ancient-looking structure with crawling ivy and crumbling walls. They said it was historic, but to me, it felt haunted. The way the shadows played across those old stones, like they were alive, watching you.  
I went with my best friend, Lily. She was this bubbly, vibrant thing, always laughing, her hair a wild cascade of curls. We wore matching Taylor Swift T-shirts and had these cute, homemade glow sticks. We were so ready for the time of our lives.  
The crowd was massive, a sea of excited faces and sparkling outfits. We pushed our way through, giggling and apologizing, heading for the front. But as we moved, I couldn't shake off this feeling of unease. The air was thick, almost suffocating, like a heavy blanket thrown over the crowd.  
As we found our spot, I noticed this guy standing a few rows ahead. He was tall and lanky, with this long, greasy hair that clung to his scalp. He kept turning around, staring at us, or maybe just at the crowd. His eyes... God, his eyes were the worst. They were like these empty pits, void of any emotion, just cold and dark. I nudged Lily, nodding towards him, but she just laughed it off. "It's a concert, weirdos are part of the package," she said.  
The lights dimmed, and the crowd erupted into cheers. The excitement was infectious, and for a moment, I forgot about the creepy guy and the oppressive atmosphere. I was here to see Taylor Swift, my idol, and nothing was going to ruin that.  
But then, the music started. It was one of her hit songs, but it sounded... off. The melody was distorted, the rhythm uneven. I thought it was a technical issue at first, but then I saw her, Taylor, on stage.  
She looked different. Not in a bad way, but there was something in her eyes, a kind of wildness that wasn't there before. She moved erratically, her dance moves sharp and unpredictable. It was mesmerizing, but also... unsettling.  
The atmosphere in the amphitheater changed. The crowd started swaying, not in the usual concert rhythm, but in a strange, almost trance-like way. I looked at Lily, and even she seemed caught up in it, her eyes glazed, her body moving oddly.  
I tried to join in, to lose myself in the music like everyone else, but I couldn't. The air felt thicker, harder to breathe. The lights on the stage started to flicker, casting grotesque shadows across the ancient walls. And then, I saw it again, the guy with the empty eyes, but now he was closer, just a few feet away.  
He was watching me, I was sure of it. His gaze was fixed, unblinking, and there was something in his expression, a kind of hunger, that sent shivers down my spine. I tugged at Lily's arm, trying to get her attention, but she just swayed to the music, oblivious.  
The song ended, and there was a moment of silence, a heavy, suffocating silence. Then, the next song began, and with it, a feeling of dread settled in my stomach. I knew, somehow, that this night was going to be nothing like I had imagined. It was going to be something much, much worse.
