DFJ@#DHI

This is to inform you that by law, this document has been censored in the interest of national security.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Some well-dressed people in sunglasses flashed government identification and guns in my face and said to me: “letter for letter, that will be your fucking introduction or so help your doomed soul, I will stuff drugs up your fucking ass and abandon you at a foreign airport without your passport.”

What would you have done in this situation? Would you type “DFJ@#DI” and a quick censorship blurb on one little reddit post or would you go to international prison for probably the rest of your life? 

Anyway.

My best friend is an r/nosleep fanatic. The best way to get this person’s attention is to write here - do not concern yourself with it - unless of course you want to. The more the merrier.

Let’s get on with it, then.

Dear Friend,

This is what happened. So I’m reading a book at night time, sitting comfortably in a comfy chair. It is indeed a comfy chair and the book is interesting.

Across from my comfy chair is a relaxing beverage that has spontaneously caught fire and the ghost of my dead roommate appears before me, one person's distance away from my own body. You didn’t believe in ghosts, eh? Neither did I - and then I saw one. It sounds a little paranoid, actually. Maybe it’s just carbon monoxide poisoning.

Either way, one way or another, the ghost of my dead roommate stands before me. The ghost is less elegant than I had expected a ghost to look but then again, I know nothing about ghosts.

“Hello,” to me says my dead roommate. “I’m here to warn you that powerful people are coming to murder you violently and it will be worse than you can imagine. It’s too late for me but you still have a chance. Get the fuck out of here while you still can. Go. Go now. They are like actually in the elevator right fucking now and they are about to enter your fucking apartment. Get the fuck out NOW. Don’t lock the door behind you - you do not have enough time. LEAVE!!!!!!”

Yikes, this is not at all how I had expected my evening to unfold and yet here I am. I slip on my nearest shoes and move swiftly enough to have my phone, wallet and keys and leave near-instantly. Just as I close the door behind me, I hear the ding of the elevator.

Could it be them? My enemies?

I turn around the hall way just in time and hear them enter what I'm certain is my unlocked apartment.

"Look everywhere," I hear them saying, and they are trashing the place loudly and unapologetically. Shit has gotten real. I'd better get used to the idea of not living here anymore.

As silently as possible, I run silently to the nearest staircase and make my way to the bottom of the apartment complex that is my home. I’ve been here lots of times.

Discreetly, I exit the complex and get a glimpse of several trucks all parked together with lots of people nearby, all concentrated on a task. I wonder what this task could be.

I consider the hour. My next shift at work is tomorrow morning. It is close to midnight while all this is happening.

I consider my location. I am at the bus stop, blending in with other people who are waiting for a bus. I have waited at a bus stop lots of times and not once have I ever been murdered by an angry mob. Will today be the day that something different happens? I must wait and see.

Why would anybody kill my roommate? My roommate was such an excellent person. Who in their right mind could possibly hate my roommate to such an extreme so as to commit murder and torture? It is a vulgar thought. The murder and torture involved to have turned a my roommate into a grotesquely haggard ghost in such a barbaric manner is beyond my imagination.

Perhaps I am hallucinating and my roommate is actually alive, which would make a lot of sense considering I’m sort of sure that we had played a game of cards just hours ago. I have a pretty good idea of how this hallucination could possibly have happened, but I’m a little embarrassed to say it in public.

Just in case it wasn’t a hallucination, I decide to get as far away from my residence as possible. I get on the next bus that comes my way. Many times before, I have not been murdered nor tortured by anybody on any bus. I hope that today will go that same way as well.

I disembark at a mall and grab a seat at a café.  In the distance, I can hear ambulance and police sirens.

There is a vibration in my pocket. It is my phone. I have received a text from my roommate. I wonder what it will say. I can’t wait to find out.

The text message reads: “how do you use a phone?” This is an extremely weird thing for most people to say, including my roommate or dead roommate.

I receive another text: “nevermind, I figured it out.”

The phone rings, displaying my roommate as the person trying to phone me. My roommate has never ever ever phoned me, never while alive. I evacuate the café and a brigade of fire trucks speeds down the street in the direction of my apartment building.

I receive another text from a different person a few minutes later reading: “are you ok?”

I reply to this text: “yeah, why?”

A moment later, there is a reply: “read the news. Your apartment building just exploded.”

I read the news and indeed, there has been a major explosion in my apartment building. I wonder where I will live now and how long it will take to acquire new clothes and dishes.

Whatever.

From now on, I will cherish my remaining days, knowing that my roommate suffered and died horribly with their last action being to save me from sharing their fate or that I narrowly avoided a carbon monoxide explosion. I may never know.

I’m actually typing this at my local library on a pc. I am the only person there. It is relaxing. There is a coffee. 

I would love to know your opinion on the whole thing. Message me the usual way. Tell the cat I say hello.
