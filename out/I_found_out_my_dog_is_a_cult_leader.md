Dogs.
Ordinary, dumb, four-legged creatures.
They wag their tails, eat grass, sniff their own crap and somehow find joy in it.
Their lives are simple: walk, bark, wrestle with a toy, then pass out asleep.
We have no idea what’s going on in their heads. Maybe... nothing at all.

Lili was the chihuahua of my best friend, who died three years ago.
She was found torn apart in the basement of his house (her heart and some organs were never recovered).
No one knows who did it, but in the basement, they found what looked like remnants of a ritual—candles, a pentagram, and a jar full of cat ears.

Lili and I always got along really well. She’s a sweet and affectionate dog.
With her pink ribbon and little pink shoes, she charms anyone who sees her.
She never had a habit of biting and was generally a calm dog—
At least, she used to be.
After what’s happened recently, I can’t say the same anymore.

My dog, who never barked at night, suddenly started barking in strange patterns—like she was trying to say something.
I don’t like getting out of bed at night, so I never went to check on her while she barked.
But one night, while watching Midsommar, I heard her again. I glanced at the clock—past midnight.
She was barking again, but it wasn’t normal. It was... deliberate. Meaningful.
I heard her getting closer, so I paused the film.
Focusing on the sound, I heard my door creak open slowly.
My heart was pounding.

Lili—the sweet, calm Lili—was standing on two legs, staring into my soul.
When she realized I was awake, she suddenly went back to acting like a normal dog, hopping around playfully.
I was too tired to process it all, so I let it go.
She kept making those strange barks for a few more weeks. But the difference now was...
I started hearing whispers. Human whispers.
And I noticed some of my candles were missing.

One night, the whispers got louder.
I knew I had to end this nonsense.
Gathering my courage, I got out of bed.
My basement door—which I always keep locked—was open, and dim candlelight was flickering from inside.
I went in.
As I walked down the stairs, I saw the nightmare unfold before me:
Mutilated cats.
Candles.
Pentagrams.
And people, dressed alike, all kneeling.
The worst part? They were all kneeling before Lili.

When the stairs creaked under my foot, every cult member—and Lili—turned to look at me.
As my eyes locked with Lili’s, I felt it again—that soul-piercing gaze.
I was frozen. Breathless.
Then I heard the door slam shut behind me.
Two of them grabbed me by the arms.
I think... I finally understood what had happened to my best friend.
And I knew what was about to happen to me.

But there’s something I hadn’t told you: I’m a hunter.
There’s a hidden compartment under the stairs leading to the basement.
Inside that compartment—my shotgun.
Luckily, we were still on the stairs.
And thankfully, I’d trained in Muay Thai during college.

Using a few quick, acrobatic moves, I threw both cultists down the stairs and grabbed my gun.
The magazine was full.
You can probably guess what happened next.
I left Lili for last.
Tied her up.

I tried to question her.
She seemed like she was speaking—but I couldn’t understand a word.
It must’ve been some language they used in the cult.
Realizing I’d get no answers, I did the same thing to her that I did to the others.

I’m still trying to uncover the truth with the books and records left behind by the cult.
Maybe one day I’ll regret what I did.
But for now—thank you for listening to my story.
