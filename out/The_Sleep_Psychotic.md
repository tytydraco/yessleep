 

I don't understand, it feels like I'm falling into myself. This has to be fake. When I tried to wake up from my bed I saw nothing. Blackness. It felt like an empty void, except it wasn't. I felt a pause in time. It felt like something arose from me. I saw an apparition, but this spirit was not like the others I'd encountered before. I think I am in a sleep paralysis, but I also think I'm in a psychotic state. I felt everything that soul felt. It would bang itself against the wall like it was trying to torture me. I fell back asleep to make it all go away

I woke up and it was gone, but it all happened over again except this time it tried to kill me. I tried to stop it but when it came charging at me, it phased through me. After it phased through me it felt like it was trying to re-enter me. I had no strength, considering I had just woken up. It was successful in gaining control over me. I felt like it was trying to eat me alive.

I woke up

It was all a dream?

What

This can't be happening

So much happened in such a short time

I don't know

I need to go back to sleep to get this all over with

I woke up from the psychotic removing sleep I tried but it didn't go away. I kept repeating and it hurt more and more every time. I blinked and it was gone but I still felt the pain. I didn't know what to do. The only thing that came to my mind was to get a glass of water and try to make it go away.

I went to sleep after getting my glass of water.

No

I can't

It will happen again

But I was too tired

I went back to sleep and the night was horrible. I was feeling lightheaded. I didn't see the soul. Was It gone? Where is it? why is it not hereafter haunting me for the past 3 days? I didn't seem to know but the school bus was here and I needed to hurry. I arrived at school and everything felt off. There. The soul It was standing right in front of me. I screamed. Everyone was looking at me, wondering why I looked so petrified. I didn't know either. I knew it wasn't real but whatever it did still hurt.

I walked home from school in the terribly cold wind and rain

When I arrived home it did not look right. My house was covered in a shadow from above. There

THERE. NO THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING. There it was the only person left in life, my mom. Gone by that hideous soul. I tried to hide but it found me every time. I had to find a way to get away.   


I went to sleep on the grass hoping it wouldn't find me. I woke up in the restaurant across the street with the employees wondering what happened or if I needed help I told them what happened and they laughed. Their laughter got deeper and lower pitched. They faded into that soul.   


  
I woke up.   
This time it was all a dream.   
These psychotic dreams are not fun.
