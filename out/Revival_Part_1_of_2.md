Police department, tape found on the scene, playing…

Track 1

Please don't turn off this tape, I recorded it as a warning to whoever may listen to it.

On Friday 30th of may me and my then wife arrived at this cabin with the idea of spending the weekend alone to try to reestablish the affection we once had for each other, after years of marriage the dislike between us started to grow and the last straw was a couple of months before when I lost my job as a high school biology teacher, the job didn't pay well and she constantly remind me of that but I felt good doing that job, teaching was my passion, I was able to cover the bills and that was good enough for me since I have never been very ambitious. I felt how she looked at me, not only as a heavy baggage to her but now unemployed as a completely useless add on to her life, even though she denied it I could feel the constant rejection on her look. Life was better when we just thought of the present and enjoyed each other's company but as soon as marriage came and long time planning got in the door then she could tell I was not enough for her.

The day actually started well we were not talking much on the way to the cabin because we just had a big fight the night before where I thought it was all over but strangely the plan remained to spend this weekend together and I felt some suspicious about the situation, why would she continue to go ahead with this trip after all the things said during the fight?, I stayed on the house because it was my house my mother left it to me so she is the one that needs to leave and I never mentioned this loudly but I thought that she was now after my house, she would try to take it from me and that was probably the only reason why she never openly confessed what she really wanted that was to take my house and live in there with someone else. While we were going through the woods I couldn't stop some part of my brain from thinking this was some kind of a trap designed by her and the other one, was I safe? Could she go that far?. The woods were thick and the many trees did not allow me to walk in a straight line and also I started to feel threatened by the noises around me, I could hear all these insects walking and all these shadows moving around me.

It started to rain a little, it was a 2 hour walk to the cabin, no roads near and that was the beauty of it.

I noticed how the first drop of rain started to hit me in my hands and when I looked up to all those tall trees I saw the drops flowing through their leaves all the way down to me and for the first time in a long time I started getting this scent of wet threes and dry earth on the floor getting water on it and bringing this fresh smell in the air that brought me back to my childhood where I would stand on the front door of the house when the rained started just to smell this odor, is funny how the smell is the sense that hits the more with nostalgia, my favorite word how it infects our brain with an idyllic past that never existed but we feel so warmed in thinking about, we can almost touch the image we get.

Track 2

We had been looking for a place like this the whole year. We live around 3 hours by car from here and she found the place on a website, it was cheap but it was perfect for our budget. We were looking for a place in the woods, first we thought of just going camping since it was the most inexpensive way of getting away from the city but after some jobs here and there I was able to get some money so we upgraded to a cabin, I was always afraid of this because of the movies but we weren't actually that far away from the nearest town so I thought we could probably get there in an hour walking fast in case of an emergency and no bridges that could be torn up and leave us isolated, it is a small town but had everything we could need.

Track 3.

We arrived and everything looked worst that it had looked on the website pictures so that was probably the reason it was so cheap, it didn't had any running water or electricity, it was cold outside and the only way of getting warm would be if any of us knew how to burn a fire but we didn't had any way of starting a fire and it was getting late so we didn't wanted to go to the town because it was already getting dark. The cabin was only 2 rooms and later discovered it had what you could call a basement that had a small stair and a big room down there that was the same size as the whole cabin but there was no construction at all so the walls were just dirt and also had no built floor so it was basically just a hole. One of the rooms had a chair and that was all the furniture in the room, we settle in the other room but soon we started to have problems again, the conditions of the cabin was a constant reminder of our own money struggles and no real future and so anything turn into an argument until I decided to sleep in the next room and leave in the morning for good.

Track 4.

I took my sleeping bag to the other room and just lay there for the next hour and it wasn't as cold as I thought it could be but cold enough to be noticeable, I stayed there for hours wishing I could be able to sleep but it didn't happened so I used this time to plan my next steps, in the morning we were going to leave together but as soon as we arrive home it was going to be over between us, I always knew she blamed me for his living style but she knew my conditions since we were going out and at no point I mentioned I had a lot of money or a bright future and even with that she decided to stay with me and later get married but I have noticed in recent years how she has been changing her attitude towards everything and I know deep down she thinks she is attractive enough to get a more wealthier man and enjoy a better lifestyle, at some point this annoyed me but is over now and I too can start over.

I saw the room getting more visible by the light of the morning coming through the window and ceiling space between wood bars and I remember I was thinking of going to the room to wake her up and end all of this when I heard his scream, I have never heard her scream like that a scream full of fear not anger so full of despair, a part of me hesitated but I went to the room anyway and when I opened the window there she was laying on the floor crying quietly more a sound of defeat like when you know and expect the worse from now on, she was with her arm extended and at the end of it I saw that thing round and full of red flesh, meaty and bloody like if it was an organ exposed the size of a basketball and a second circular extension that was the head and from this orifice a long black and thick tube that was attached in a bite to her hand, I could see this black fangs through the transparent flesh and it was standing with this four black spider like legs, it was horrible to see that and I understood that the crying was not for pain but for feeling attacked and defeated by this strange animal or insect that I had never seen before that thing then released her and starting to come my way you could almost make a human face in the head and I was able to kill it before it attacked me by using shovel that was left in the cabin, I cloud see how the black orifice opened up and I could imply that he was going to trow me that black tube against me so I acted fast and it felt like a water balloon when I hit it but all the blood started to come out in all directions and the thing continued to move after after a couple of more strikes it just stay down.

She continued to cry and just lay there so I went to try to console her and she continuously looked at his wound and said that she felt something went into her body and it was not just the bite so we agreed we should leave now and go to a hospital because if we go into town they maybe have seen an animal like this around here and would now what happens if it bites you.I have not seen her this vulnerable and glad that I was around in the last years.

I looked for bag to take the insect with us, it was heavier than I thought and as soon as we had everything we started to walk out the cabin, we had taken 3 steps out the door when she just collapsed, I drag her back as I could inside the cabin  and lay her down in the floor, I checked and she was still breathing so I tried to wake her up but she was completely unconscious, no movement, no response of any kind so I took some blankets out of the luggage and put it in the floor and then I lay her down on top, it was still pretty early in the morning so I though of give her a couple of hours to recover if she did not then I could go to town and bring a doctor with me, at first I thought it could be something as simple as low sugar or because of the extreme scare of the “bug” and I remembered the disgusting image of the “thing” with his long tube connected to her hand and I wanted to believe it was just a spider but the tube was long and the face of the thing was something I hadn't look at before it was like it was trying to emulate a human face, I searched in her arm for the injury but found only a red spot and nothing that could worry me to much I did not know by then that her transformation was just starting to happen.
