This is going to be a long one, so sit back, relax, and enjoy the (crap)show. Also, English is not my first language, sorry in advance if anything sounds odd.

I met this woman on social media, I had been single for a couple of months now and was trying to get back into the dating market, she seemed fine, cute, we shared some similar interests and conversation was normal, nothing out of the ordinary, a little flirting here and there and some cringeness that comes with our ages (early 30s), but no red flags were raised. After a couple of weeks of this, she invited me to her apartment, and something felt off. I thought I was imagining things and tried to give a second change, only to confirm my suspicions. She started rambling nonstop, out of nowhere, about things that happened to her, about unsolved issues with her ex, A LOT of oversharing and overall TMI about stuff that you simply don't tell people you're just meeting. She weirded me out enough that I came up with an excuse and basically bolted out of her apartment. She obviously noticed that, and by time I arrived home she had already unfollowed me and removed me as a follower on Instagram.

I thought "well, that sorted itself out", because I was ready for the "yeah, we are not seeing each other again" conversation. Later that day she reached out to me and said that wasn't comfortable with how things ended, and wanted to end on a better note saying that we could still be friends. I agreed with that, but mostly because I had an impression that things would turn out way worse should I just go no contact with her. Next day she's still talking to me normally and says "hey wanna hear some gossip?", I was like "yeah, sure, whatever", she replies "I'm gonna send you some voice messages, this is so funny", and then she proceeds to send me TWENTY FIVE MINUTES of voice messages, all these messages she recorded herself and sent to an aunt of her ex, badmouthing EVERYONE, talking smack about EVERYONE, basically airing out all the dirty linen they might've have. In some of the voice mails she was crying, in the others talking gibberish, it was like listening to the Joker's audio log. I was speechless, and just told her that I wasn't intersted in that kind of drama and didn't want to know anything about that anymore. She started to apologize and tell me that everything was fine, that I had nothing to worry about, that those people were crazy but harmless. She didn't realize I was actually afraid of her.

After that, for a week she kept sending messages and I kept giving her short answers and leaving her on read, in hopes that she would eventually get tired or simply take the hint. After a few days, she realized something was wrong and asked me if I was OK or if I was mad at her, I took the opportunity to come clean and said that I didn't want to talk to her anymore. She apologized and blocked me. A few minutes later my ex-girlfriend sends me screenshots about someone following and sending texts to her. The woman tracked down my ex-girlfriend (and several friends of mine, through stalking) and started to talk smack about me. She told my ex that I was crazy, possibly narcissistic, and that she should stay very far away from me because she'd dealt with men like me and things could even end with abuse. My ex-girlfriend was (understandably) FURIOUS with me, it took me a whole day of back-and-forth with her for her to come to her senses and realize that the woman was nuts and just trying to create drama. Later the woman unblocked me and came to talk to me, apologized, said she probably had Borderline Personality Disorder, saying things like "you treated me well" and "you don't deserve a crazy person like me", but at this point I was having none of it. I told her with very strong words that by that time she knew what she had done, and there was NO WAY that we could be anything even close as friends, and she should just leave me and everyone around me alone. She apologized, again, but kept going on and on with her rambles, to the point of sending something like 40 messages back to back, until I got fed up and let her know that I was going to block her on WhatsApp.

A couple of days passed, and she followed me again on Instagram. I thought no harm could come of it and let her, but didn't follow her back. She started liking all my posts together, that bothered me so I blocked her. Next day she sent me an invite on Facebook, I rejected and blocked her there too. A few days passed, and a random Twitter account liked 40 of my tweets together, blocked it just in case. Another day passed, this time the woman's account (with her name and picture) starts doing the same, blocked it too, and locked my Twitter. That situation was becoming mildly infuriating, and at this point all my friends knew about it, and we all made jokes, despite I always raising the concern that one day she might show up at my doorstep. Bear in mind that she didn't know where I lived, she only knew my name and the town I live in, which is a very small town where everyone knows one another, my town is 25KM from her town, and she doesn't have a car, but despite all of that it wouldn't be very difficult to track me down should she choose to do so.

So, almost three weeks after I firstly blocked her on WhatsApp, it was 4:30PM, I had just came back from the gym and was picking up some laundry from the clothesline, when I hear a noise and turn around. There she was, standing on my porch. She was wearing a gym/fighting outfit, holding a plastic bag with her cellphone and some belongings, and flip-flops on her feet. Keep this information because this will be important later on. I freaked out instantly, started to berate her, asking her what was she doing here, if she was out of her mind, if I hadn't been clear enough that I DID NOT want to see her ever again, and most of all, telling her to get the hell out of my house. Apparently that caught her off guard, she didn't expect that I was going to freak out just by the sight of her, she started claiming that she didn't have any money or phone charge to call a cab. I gave her a 50 bill and told her to get the hell out, if she was able enough to track me down, she sure was able to go back to where she came from. After 15 minutes of arguing she left, claiming to go to a "friend" that would take her back home.

When she left, the first thing I did was to go to a police station to file a report. I didn't press charges because she hadn't committed any crime, but I filed a report anyway just in case something else happened, explained all the situation at the station and left everyone on alert. Came back to my house, put my wireless headphones and went on Discord to talk to my friends and tell them that all my fears came true. I was inside my bedroom, folding my laundry, when I turn around, and there she is standing on my bedroom's doorstep. Small town, used to never locking doors. Once again I start to berate her, screaming for her to get out of my house, but then I get the BRILLIANT idea, of turning on my webcam, and having my friends record everything that was going on inside my bedroom. She blatantly refused to leave, and while laughing started messing with my stuff. I realized that she was just trying to get a reaction out of me, and I bolted out of my house and went screaming in the businesses nearby, telling people what was happening in order to get witnesses. Meanwhile my friends were telling me that she was laying on my bed, trying on my sunglasses, messing with my stuff, just plainly acting deranged. After a while she came out of my house and started chasing after me, ignoring all my pleas for her to stay the hell away and to not touch me, to point that I had to actually run away from her, in front of all the people that at this time were bystanders. She kept saying that she wanted to talk to me, and telling me she loved me.

This went on for maybe close to an hour, I had already called the police about 3 times, but there was a situation in the countryside and there were no cop cars available, again, small town issues. I was around people, waiting for the police, when out of the blue the woman comes out from my house, look at all the people that gathered to see the drama, ignored everyone, and started walking towards a lake that is located near my house. It's a private property, owned by my cousin, they use it to fish and stuff. She started walking towards the lake, very nonchalantly, I thought she was going to get mauled by my cousin's dogs, but after a little barking they just ignored her, she went near the lake, and jumped in, swam all the way to the middle (the lake is 7 meters deep), and after that went to the shore were she just hung on, doing nothing. One of the men that was watching all of this unfold went after her, talked to her, and helped her out of the lake, later he told me that she was crying and saying that "wanted to die because she loved me so much and I didn't want her anymore". She tried to go back to my house, but this time I had locked all the doors. She asked to go to the bathroom, I vehemently denied, and after this she went away a second time, soaking wet from lake water.

By this time, pretty much the whole town, the cops, and my family were aware of what was going on. It was about 8:30PM, I was sitting outside of my house, waiting for the cops, door wide open, when I look up, and see her coming back. I bolted the hell out of there with my car keys in hand, she tried to grab me but I escaped, got into my car and managed to turn it on and lock the doors, but unfortunately wasn't quick enough to close the windows, so she basically started to climb into my car through the windows, while laughing all the way saying "take me with you hehehe". I left my car and started walking away. She exited the car and went back into my house. I came back to my car and drove to the police station, there was NO ONE there (small town smh), so I raced to another cousin (not the owner of the lake), to go back home with me because there was no way in hell I would be alone with that psycho. When we arrived at my house, she was in my bedroom, sitting in front of my PC, she had logged on my Instagram account, had unblocked herself, and was liking all her posts with my account. We managed to convince her to go outside to talk, my cousin sat her down and had a very strong conversation with her, trying to find a cab or something to take her back, and warning her to NEVER come back again. She even got offended by all of this, and got up and left saying "I can't believe I came all this way just to be treated like shit", and so she went away for the third time.

Everyone was advising me to go away, to sleep in another house because surely she would come back. But I just couldn't leave my house nor my pets behind. So I hid my car, turned of all the lights, locked everything, and just stayed inside, quietly. The woman passed my house a couple of times, this time accompanied by two dudes (my cousin saw them on CCTV and said they were pretty bad apples), laughing and talking loudly. I just went on with what was left of my day, updating my friends on discord about the whole ordeal. At 11:30PM I hear a knock on the door. It's her. But this time she is crying and screaming. She's begging me to let her in, to talk to her, saying things like "why did you leave me? I didn't do anything to you! I want my cats! Why did they take my cats away?". After maybe 10 minutes of these, my house in complete silence and darkness, she gave up and went away.

My family came rushing in my aid, we tried to search for her around my house to see if she wasn't hiding. Later my family found her in front of a gas station, crying, barefoot, and without her bag with her cell phone (a brand new iPhone 14). They took her in and managed to convince me to pay for a cab to take her back home. I wanted the police to settle this, but they were nowhere to be found, and my family just couldn't hold a batshit insane woman rambling nonsense all night long, so I paid for the damn cab, and they told me that while she was boarding the cab she said "you can take me home, but tomorrow I will be back". The cab driver told us later that he drove her to the police station of her hometown, they asked if she needed any help, she told them no, and walked away. The next day, it was about 10AM, I started to receive warnings that she had been spotted around town, still wearing the same gym outfit. But this time things took a turn for the craziest.

I have no idea how she managed to get back, but my plan was the same. To lock myself in, and pretend no one is home. It was around noon, and it was a holiday, so everyone was pretty much busy with their lunches and gatherings. At about 12:30PM she came to my house and tried to get in, but unfortunately this time she noticed I'm home. I yelled with her for a little bit, and she went away without much struggle. She started to go the same path to the lake she took the other day. There is a recreation area near the lake, a very nice place where people have family and company gatherings and lunches. She walked in there, sat at the table, served herself, drank soda straight out of the bottle, asked for more when finished, and most important of all, was BLOWING EVERYONE'S MIND with her craziness. After she ate, she got up and went away, came back to my house, hung around for a minute or two outside, and went away. Later I found out that she went a few houses up the street from mine, found a mattress laying on the porch, and just laid down and slept. 

Not much later than that the police finally arrived. I explained the situation again, this time my cousin also came to give his side of things, about a crazy woman sitting at his table like she belonged there, the cops pulled her file and apparently she is booked for home invasion, her ex has a restraining order on her, and at one point he had to prove himself innocent of a false accusation of aggression. The cop even made fun of the situating while reading her file and said "it says here that she cut a guy's dick at some point", I screamed "WHAT?" and the cop started laughing and said "haha just kidding". Now I laugh, but at the time I got pissed. The cops filed another report, but explained there wasn't much they could actually do. The girl was sleeping at a house, and unfortunately that is not a crime, unless the owner of the house reports her for trespassing. And they also explained that they couldn't take her back home, because if something would've happen to her, if she harmed herself, the fault would fall on the officers. But they advised that if she came back into my plot, I could call them and they would have the grounds for a proper arrest.

Now comes the cherry on top. All of this that I just told, were the things that happened from my point of view. Later on, when word spread around of what was going on, I managed to pick up the pieces and paint the bigger picture. So here is an accurate timeline of events:

1 - When we searched her social media, we found out that the day before she showed up here, she posted a few pictures having a fighting routine workout (hence, the gym attire), and apparently her confidence/self-esteem was boosted enough and she thought she was so pretty in that outfit that she didn't even bother to change before coming.

2 - We found out that SHE WALKED, most of the 25KM (15 miles) to my house, but someone saw her walking, took pity and gave her a ride, apparently it was the second time she was doing this, but this time she managed to get a ride. The person that gave her the ride told us that the woman said that she was "visiting friends" and "following her instinct".

3 - She arrived here at noon, and spend almost 4 hours walking around town, talking to random people about me, trying to find out where I lived.

4 - The next day when she came back, she TERRORIZED the entire town, she started trying to break into cars and houses, there was a house that she manage to break in (open doors, small town), took a shower, stole panties from the house's owner's daughter, and while half-naked picked up the pictures from the walls pointing at them screaming "I'm your daughter, don't you see? You have to believe me!".

5 - The owner of the house that she slept on the porch tried to take her to the police station, but there was no one there, so they took her to the hospital, she was there for maybe 10 minutes and then left (she refused to be admitted), and started wandering aimlessly around the hospital's neighborhood, trying to pull the same break into houses and cars routine.

6 - This time, the town's health department alongside the police managed to pick her up, and admit her into the psych ward of a hospital in a neighboring city, where she will stay for 30 days. While she was being detained they told me that she kept saying "take me to my husband, take me to my husband's house", and when asked who her husband was, she gave my name.

In hindsight, despite being one of the scariest experiences of my entire life, I think things went incredibly well for me. At first I was scared shitless that she might make some weird claim against me, harm me, herself, or break my stuff, but fortunately she was never violent, just really really weird and creepy. I have tons of evidence, videos, texts, and witnesses, and I intent fully on keeping my charges against her, in order to protect myself, and preventing this from happening ever again.

If she had arrived at my place an hour later, she would have had my house unlocked, all for herself for hours, she could've even gone into one of the spare bedrooms, and could've take a nap and I would be ever so oblivious about someone being at my place. I could have realized someone was there, I don't know, at 3AM when she would probably crawl into my bed.

I don't think I want to date strangers ever again.

Mental health professionals, what went down?

PS: I left a few details out, otherwise this would be much longer that it already is, if there's something missing, or should you guys want additional information, fell free to ask.

PS 2: Even though I have photo and video evidence, I will not be sharing any of it, for it's very easy to identify both of us and where we live. Also I'm not going to post the police report because it's not in English, and a printed piece of paper isn't the strongest of evidences, so you're free to make your own judgment, but let me tell you, I WISHED that all of this was just a tall tale.
