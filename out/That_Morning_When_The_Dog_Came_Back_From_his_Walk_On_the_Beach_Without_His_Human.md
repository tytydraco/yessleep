Coral (not his real name) jerked his eyes open, flailing his arms wildly. His tail was trapped, and his lower body was immobile. He twisted about wildly from the waist, memories surging back.

The party last night had been wild- pufferfish, dolphins, seals, and then of course someone made the stupid suggestion to surface.

That was the last thing Coral actually remembered. The shock of the sudden cool breeze on his streaming wet face, the white moonlight bouncing off the heaving black waves. 

Now here he was, buried up the waist in sand, the terrible morning sun already striking impossibly bright rays from the sea into his eyes.

He tried to move his tail, but the weight of the sand over it was too much for more than the slightest twitches.

Cursing his friends who must have thought it hilarious to bury him on the beach and then leave him stranded, he started digging with his bare hands, removing fistfuls of sand from around his torso and scattering it feebly away from him. The night before had left him weak, and despite his muscular upper body and powerful swimmer’s arms, he was not making much progress. His fingers were becoming sore against the rough sand and sharp pieces of shellfish.

And then he heard a seal- no- a dog barking.

Oh fuck.

He tried digging faster to free himself, but the dog was free and bounded up to Coral easily. Coral tried to move his tail again, but hampered by the great weight of sand piled over it, he was helpless.

The dog was big furry beast, and sniffed at him with interest, while Coral tried to twist away from its big wet black nose. He liked playing with seals generally, but now was not a good time. He frantically clawed at the tightly-packed wet sand, trying to free his long strong tail.

Just as the pronged silver tip of his tail began to gleam through the dull sand, the human walked up. “Scrabble! Scrabble! What have you found boy?”

Scrabble leapt with delight between the pair of them, trying to get them to make friends.

Coral made one last effort and heaved himself out of the hole, his very long steely-black tail curling and twitching around his smooth humanoid body. He lay panting, then slowly turned and locked eyes with the human, his fatigue giving way to the imperative of the ancient rule of the sea.

Scrabble barked urgently, his delight turning into fear at the deadly alien look in Coral’s cold greenish-pink eyes.

Realising too late they had stumbled upon something not meant for us to see, the human gasped and turned.

Coral easily reached out and wrapped his tail around the human, their efforts to free themself wholly futile. One of Coral’s translucent tail fins covered their face entirely, so they were silent and bound tight as Coral crawled on his hands rapidly back to the waves, dragging his prey behind him.

Scrabble barked. But there was no one on the empty beach to hear him.
