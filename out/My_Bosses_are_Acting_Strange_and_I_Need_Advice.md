I work overnight at a retail hardware store that I won't name. I'd rather not risk someone hearing about this and writing me up or something. My job title is receiver/stocker. Essentially, I unload semi trucks, sort the freight out onto their designated pallets, and then work the freight that corresponds to my departments. I do the best I'm able to, and I'm told my team is the best in the region in terms of speed and safety. Not that we see any reward for that, though.

I also want to mention that I do not like my bosses. I have one direct supervisor, Rich, who is the laziest and most delusional man I've ever met. Above him is Trevor, an assistant manager who I rarely see. He's the type of guy to smile and ask about your weekend only to have you fired after. 

Usually, if I do my job, keep my head down, and give them nothing to complain about, they leave me alone. But it's a bit of a balancing act. If I do too little, they'll try to get me in some sort of trouble. If I do more than is expected of me, they will begin to expect that regularly. So, I do my best to do just enough. 

Rich plays around constantly with my hours, which is a pain. He'll add as much as he can when he has work he doesn't want to do himself. But other days, he'll remove me from the schedule. I'm convinced he uses this to manipulate me. You know, like, “do what I want or no hours for you.” He often makes me show up early or stay late, but I'd rather have that than the opposite.

A normal shift for me goes like this; show up at 6pm, set up the receiving area with pallets and a conveyer belt, unload the semi, pull out the pallets to their aisles, work on whatever department Rich sends me to, throw excess product into top stock using an order picker, and then clean up and go home at around 4 to 5am. However, this all depends on if there is a truck. If not, my supervisors will essentially have me as an errand boy for that shift while they themselves sit on the lawn chairs in the garden section and play fantasy football. There are 3 trucks a week so this happens twice a week, usually.

It was on a Monday night shift a few weeks ago that I first felt that things were a bit off. It was around 1am, meaning the truck had been unloaded and I was just about done with freight. Rich walked by me with a bag from Burger King. He often leaves for long periods and comes back with food. He walked by me as I was loading cardboard onto the empty pallet to take back to the bailer.

He smiled at me and said, 

“Finished with freight already? Good work.”

 This guy has never complimented my work before, not once. I think I'd almost have preferred it if he had fired me, I was so creeped out. After he said that he went on his way, presumably to go do nothing in the training room for a good chunk of his shift. It was weird, sure, but I figured he was just in a good mood or something. But it started happening more regularly, with him and Trevor both. They've been complimenting me, giving me consistent hours, even an extra break, once. Again, normally this wouldn't be too bad, but there are a few things that feel off. 

Firstly, it seems to be just me. There are 5 other employees who work the same job that they still treat badly. But, suddenly, I'm their favorite. Next, it feels forced. They'll be wearing their normal sour expressions and yelling at my coworkers until they see me. It's like a switch goes off or something. They both put on this big toothy grin that doesn't quite reach their eyes and they speak with this odd tone. It's almost like a customer service voice, if that makes sense. Fake and overly sweet. As soon as they or I leave, the smile drops instantly. 

Writing it here, it seems like nothing, but it gives me chills. The other night, one of them snuck up behind me. I usually work with headphones. Podcasts and music makes the shift go by quicker and I tend to zone out. I turned around while I was working and saw Trevor standing at the end of the aisles. He was just standing there, hands by his sides, smiling at me. After a few seconds of awkward eye contact I asked him,

“Uh…hey Trevor. Everything okay?”

“Sure is!” He said excitedly. His voice was a little too loud. Like how people talk in commercials.

 After another awkward amount of time he asked me with the same tone,  

“Hey, can you stay later tonight?” They had been cutting hours from some others, so it was odd that he was offering me more. 

“Yeah if you need me to, sure.” I replied.

“Great! Let me know if you need anything!” And then he turned around and left.

I'm paraphrasing, of course, but the interaction really got to me. Something about how he spoke and moved. Specifically how he walked away. It was very slightly off. He seemed stiff almost. Like someone forcing a marionette to march.

 A coworker who I get along with, George, came up to me afterwards. His department is across from mine, meaning he could see Trevor from where he was working. He asked me if I was on thin ice or something. When I asked what he meant, he told me he figured Trevor was assessing my value to the company, watching to see if I was working fast enough. Apparently, before I noticed him, Trevor had been standing still at the end of the aisle for upwards of 20 minutes, just watching me work. 

I've been asking around about my bosses. No one could relate. To everyone but me, they've been their usual selves. Hell, they even fired a guy last week because he wasn't working quick enough. We've never gotten along; they've written me up or tried to get me in hot water every chance they've gotten up until now. And I’m a very average worker, admittedly. So why am I getting special treatment? 

I've been thinking about quitting even before all this. The job has too many downsides considering the people I work for. It’s not just that, though. I’ve been liking this job less and less as the months go by. Just getting bored of the same tasks over and over, I guess. Recently, the place has had a faint odor of rot that I can't escape. It drives me crazy. But we have rats. One of them probably just died in one of the aisles. But those things, plus my boss's recent creepiness is really wearing on me.

But, as much as I want to quit, now that I've been getting more hours, I don't think I should. The money has been really helpful. Has anyone else experienced something like this? Are they trying to be nicer to me because they want something from me, or am I being paranoid? 

I'll keep updating if this goes on.
