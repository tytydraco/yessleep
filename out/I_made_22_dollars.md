I was just wrapping up my orders for doordash and about to go home. It was late maybe 2300, I did most of my dashing at night due to the hot summer days in Southern Arizona. I got off the highway and as I went to log out I get an order for 22+ dollars which is considered very high for where I was. I accept the order and go pick up enough food that could easily feed 2 or 3 people.

The route it takes me for the drop off was in a place I was familiar with. As I was approaching my location I missed the turn onto a dirt road I've never noticed before. Arizona trys to minigate light population and it had been raining so the clouds covered the moon and stars. I turn around and start driving down this wet dirt road it feels like it stretches for miles and I dont see any lights in the distance. I noticed shadows in the distance that looked like cactus, but they were moving. Its hard to say I know night in the desert can play tricks on your eyes. Not enough to deter me form my 22 dollar order however.

The end of the road there was a ranch gate all made of wood that looked to be decades old. As I kept driving I dont know what they were but some sort of sheds or cabins which also looked as if they would collapse any second. As I finish my drive there looks to be a more developed building up ahead with all the lights off. I pulled up next to the only vehicle there a large Grey or white van. Its midnight. I look at the customers instructions on the app and as most times they are completely useless. I look around as I message and call the costumer but with lack of service I'm lost.

I think I see the walkway they had mentioned and with an uneasy feeling I walk down the path brushing agenst overgrown plants. I come to a set of doors that look like the entrance of a lobby. As I walk in its dead silent and know one is around. Im about to just leave the food at the desk as, I kid you not, a ghostly pale women about a foot shorter then me with midnight black hair approaches. I compose myself and hand her the food and complete my delivery. She apologized for the complicated delivery and threw in a couple extra dollars for compensation. I tell her "ive been in the area for months now and ive never even heard of this place before." She said "its very popular with people booking reservations years in advance." We talk for a little longer but things were starting to get to me.

There was creaking coming from the ceiling in a rhythmic pattern which this women claimed "oh that's just Bob he's a friendly ghost that walks on the roof." She tells me the place is haunted not to my surprise but she says its fine just watch out for skin walkers. Growing up in the north the only criptids I knew were windigos. As she explains skinwalkers I look around and I see a photo that is just pure static. And as I look out the windows there are people looking in. Everytime I do a double take though its all completely normal. No static, no people nothing strange just my imagination. 

She tells me she enjoyed our conversation and thanked me for the food but said I should probably get going. I smile and wave as I leave. As I get in my car I take a shot of fireball I had picked up earlier and light a cigarette to calm my nerves. As I get off the dirt road and head back home I turn on some music and I see the time. 0259. I did not spend 3 hours there. I question how the time went by so quick as I drive home. I noticed all the shadows on the way back home. Most were caused by shrubs or the what i asume to be the homless people walking around. I got home safely and when I looked I had made 27 dollars from that delivery.

I didn't plan on telling this story ive joked about it with friends but its late and my mind is full of questions. Where did the time go? She asked me to leave and it was just before 0300? Was my mind actually playing tricks on me? And were there skinwalkers as cactus and homless? Idk but it does feel better after ive writen it all down.
