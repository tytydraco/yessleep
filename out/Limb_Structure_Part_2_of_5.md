I sat on the cold, rough stone, feeling the chill seep through my jeans. My thoughts replayed the day with a restless, sour note, furious echoes ringing in my ears. Uncertain musings mingled with Kara’s sweet, soft voice. Her shrill outbursts of contempt were sharp and jarring. She had looked so confused, her eyes wide and brows furrowed, outraged by my insistent pleas for time off. *‘Time off from what exactly?*’ A hammer of regret lodged itself in my chest as I remembered the hurt in her voice when she asked that question.

I kicked at a crumpled piece of trash, the motion aimless and half-hearted, not even sure what I’d been asking for. Her words still knocking around in my head hours later. *‘Why are you doing this?’* She had repeated that simple question over and **over**. The confrontation had grown until it clogged the school hallway, each of us arguing ever louder to gain purchase and ***‘win’*** our side. 

I had meant to ask for space to figure things out. Time, everything was so muddled now. My fingers picked at random bits of dry weeds clinging to my shoelaces.  *But things…*

“Yo. Take it.” Kyle shoved a can of warm beer against my face, prodding with the gift until I snatched it from his mitts. “You good, *man?* That was a helluva fight. Reminds me of my folks.”

“Less fist fighting.” I watched Kyle smirk at me as he cracked open his stolen can, the hiss of carbonation filling the air. “Thanks…”

“You…” Kyle began to say something but changed his mind, guzzling his alcohol. “I checked out Pete’s place. Stood here for eons waiting to tell you all about it. Pair of patrol cars front and back. Asked ‘em what was going on.”

“I just need to find something to help. *You asked?* The cops? They’ll know you **were around**. We can’t go there now!” My words hurried out faster than my thoughts could keep track of them. An oil slick of frustration smeared the ground between the two of us.

Kyle brayed like a horse, spraying booze across the field just to elicit a laugh from me. “*Never the plan.* Besides, they’d be looking for a Kyle, not a mangy mutt.” He flopped into place beside me, his shoulder bumping mine. “You’re more the kind fellow. I’m the B and E guy.”

“B and E?” I asked incredulously between careful sips, agitation crawling out of my stomach as Kyle continued to sit beside me.

“My point **exactly.** But you were desperate. *‘You can’t do this, Kyle. You can’t be a part of this.’* FINE. I can still provide my professional opinion. Locked up square and tight. Miles of police tape, **BUT** window above the back porch, stuck half open. Hard to close all your windows on a hundred-year-old house.” Kyle's voice was smug, a glint of mischief in his eyes as he bragged about the entry point.

“Open window in the middle of winter?” I tilted my head over, a tingling apprehension sinking into my bones.

“My house has three. Year-round. Old carpet and duct tape keep the coons out. Most of the time.” He noticed me squirming and took it the wrong way. “Chillax, dude. Taylor house is on the way to mine. Strolled by and made myself seem like a lookie-loo, made the cop interrogate me. *Classic tactic.*” He gave a nonchalant shrug, taking another swig of beer.

Frustration seethed in my clenched fingers, the tension boiling until it burst out of my mouth. “You fucking told them **everything!**” I couldn’t keep the words behind my tongue. “I need to know what Pete knew! I have to have some ***answers.*** You don’t know what this is like! I can’t believe you!” My vision blurred with rage, and I was seconds away from clawing at his throat.

“**Chill!** ***Dude!***” Kyle huffed at me, pushing my beer toward my mouth until I finished it off. “I made the cop tell me things, *while* he thought it was his idea to chase me off. I’ve done a bunch of sketchy shit. This is my area of expertise. You know how to be a great guy, and I know how to be **a scumbag.** We both have our skill sets. Take a frigging breather.”

My hands wouldn't stop rattling no matter where I put them. I spent long days distraught over everything I didn't know. Bags formed under my eyes, chasing sleep that wouldn't be caught. A creaking ache needled into every muscle and twitch, as no position let me rest or relax. Focusing my mind on any task had become **hopeless**, except for thinking about what ***Pete*** might be hiding for me to find. What treasure? What grimoire might still be in his home? *Something.* Anything to provide a clue to the mania Primus was aiming at me. "I NEED some answers, man. Just to get there... find something..."

Kyle grunted before cracking open another pilfered adult beverage. “Any idea what we’re…?”

“Not you, *me*. **Me.** Guthy. Everybody’s favorite doormat. *Guthy the shithead*. I’m going in, **not you.** You are not coming with **me**. I need you to… I want you as far away from this fustercluck as possible. Lead me there and *go home,* Kyle. **Forget** about me.” I snapped, my words injecting venom into Kyle as he leaned backward to avoid them.

Kyle flinched, his shoulders slumping as he avoided my gaze with practiced indifference. Nobody liked being treated that way, but some people got well and truly used to it.

“Sorry. You just don’t know.”

“Well, I would know if you’d let me! If I just *looked* at the notebook.” Kyle tried to share in my misery, his voice tinged with frustration and concern.

Instead of hitting him or leaping headlong over that chasm of no return, I stalked off. It took ages to calm myself down, to fight against mountainous rage and internal tumult. But I managed it, *somehow.* “You don’t want to.” I insisted, more for myself, and to keep him safe from it, than anything else.

“Well, because you won’t tell me. If you would just explain…” Kyle floundered tossing his half-drunk beer off into the woods to keep from hurling it at me.

“You don’t want to know, **Kyle!**” I cut him off with a glare of warning.

“I do want to know!” Kyle's brow furrowed sharply. “For fuck’s sake, we’ve been best friends forever, Guthy. After all the times I stuck my neck out for you… All the times you covered for me. Every shit idea you talked me out of. You think I’m just gonna abandon you?” Kyle struggled against a rising tide of his irritation, emotions beaten and whipped into his hide, etched in stone by monstrous parents who never let up on him or gave him an inch. He yanked his sleeve across his eyes, turning angry, reddened orbs upon me. “Let me take on some of this. Let me carry some of it!”

“**NO**. You can’t just pick this up and put it in *a backpack.* It’s a… I don’t even know. That notebook is the most dangerous thing anyone has ever seen, Kyle. Worse than the bloody Ark of the Covenant! *Melting Germans and all.*”

“I can handle it, Guthy.”

“This isn’t about handling it. It should **not** *be*. At all!” I paced off, bashing my fists against my sides. Hard enough that the sting of impact paid in a down payment. “Putting it in a box and hiding it in a warehouse isn’t enough. I shoulda just **burned** the frigging thing.”

“Why didn’t you if **not** to include me? Didn’t you think I’d want to be a dog or a mountain lion or something?”

“Jesus, pud-thumping Christ, Kyle? *Is that what this is?*” We bellowed at each other. “It’s not cool, Kyle. This mess has a serious cost, and you have to **STAY** away from it.” We traded long, willful stares. “Promise me, Kyle! **Promise me!** Now, or we are done!”

“I promise.” Kyle waited to see if that was enough but continued when I made it clear he should keep going. “I promise I won’t ever touch the notebook or look at it. *Alright?*”

“**Fine**.” I vented. Kyle didn’t respond.

“You still want me to show you the house?”

I thought about it. Long and hard. “I don’t even want you around.” The words hit Kyle like an arrow.

He took a step back, scowling. “How many times have you broken into someone’s house?” Kyle deflected, trying to hide the hurt.

“*Less than you*.” I snapped, my temples throbbing. I needed to get to Pete’s house. Everything else felt like an obstacle. A target and a goal. **Answers.** Lack of sleep and the sensation of eyes on me made every thought harder to voice.

“We don’t have to hang out, but I’m *your friend.* I want to help you through this.” Kyle clenched his fist, stepping forward. His determination clashed with the dread swirling in my mind.

I sidestepped toward Pete’s house. Pushing whatever tangible sound would emerge through the putrid sludge of my brain. “I… Just stay away from this mess Kyle.” Two belligerent rams bashing horned skulls. I had to keep him SAFE. He couldn’t be involved more than he was. ***Primus.*** There was no telling what it had in store for me. I couldn’t bear the thought of what it might do to Kyle.

“How are you going to get there?” Kyle charged forward with a shout. Struggling with his hectic emotions just as angry as he was disturbed. “You’ve been avoiding the woods ever since, whatever you won’t tell me about!” His face reddened as he realized *how little* I had described what occurred. “Like if you don’t tell me something… What am I supposed to do!” Kyle’s internal anguish boiled over as he closed the gap to snatch at my arm.

There weren’t any thoughts. Kyle’s hands never reached me. The change was **instant.** One moment, a confused teen; the next, a dog fleeing for the hills. His hands hit empty air as I darted through the field, gone in a flash.

Yes, I was running. Fleeing. I thought about attacking him—biting, clawing. *Kyle.* It wasn’t just an impulse; it was a **need**. To rend flesh from bone. To gorge on meat. Dogs don’t cry.

Dirt and dry weeds flicked into the air behind me, leaving a trail of cold dust. Smells bombarded my nose and mouth as my tongue lolled to one side. The trees rocketed by. Distant warbling shouts reached me, mutating as they hit my pointed ears. *Charlie Brown parents.* You feel the sound more than recognize it. It touches your spine and stomach before you grasp it.

The running. The freedom to bound over any boulder. Leaping to hurdle a bush. Stop. Satellite ears. Prodding sniff. Squirrel. *I’ll get you later.* Huffing, panting. Pointed face over there, just as a car sprays stones on an old dirt road, heavy metal blaring a screech into the distance. Sniff, sniff. Someone peed here. Dog. 5, 6 years old? Sniff. Sick. Hungry, tired. A stray fending for itself. *Be careful.*

Sprinting. Pete’s house. I sat in a clearing, heaving. Tucked into dry golden grass, shielded from the chill wind. Two police cruisers, cops in heated seats not looking at anything. Where to go? What to do?

A plain, rundown home with a maintained front yard but a backyard strewn with children’s toys and plastic trucks. I vaguely remembered wanting those as a kid but never receiving them. Lights flashed on one cop car, making me tense and fuse into the low grass, fearing the worst. But the cop drove up the lane and out of sight.

I sat up, noting how the house mostly obscured the other car. Loping down the hill into the backyard, I scanned for the window Kyle had mentioned—above the back porch. From the shed? *Too far.* I pawed a wobbly grill, my first attempt impossibly loud. Tucking into a manicured bush, I waited, but no one came to check.

After countless moments of worry, I jumped onto the back roof, scrambling and clawing for footing but managing to make it. As a dog, there’s no room to worry about the consequences of **failure**. The choice had been made, and the event was in motion.

The powerful smell hit me, overwhelming my senses. I could taste the rotting embers of a previous encounter, but the exact nature of the stench eluded me. My ears lowered defensively, a primal reaction to the undefinable yet terrible odor.

I padded up to the window, prodding the carpet with my face. One corner was already open. *‘Keep the raccoons out most of the time,’* Kyle's words echoed in my mind. Shifting back and forth between paws, I dove inside. A blunt jab drew a pained yelp from my maw—a chair, splayed toward the window. An inconvenience to a person, almost a tragedy to a dog. My ribs ached where the metal support had struck during the landing, but the pain faded quickly, distant and **muted.**

As I surveyed the dim room, the reality of my limitations hit me. Fast, small, and durable, but no match against a person—almost any person except a child. A tense moment of inaction. Pacing in a small circle of worry until courage rebooted in my skull. I left the upstairs bedroom, which had been completely trashed long before the cops searched it. As I quested through the house, sharp tension prickled along my hackles.

The upstairs was empty, save for a few bare beds and dressers missing clothing. Turning toward the stairs, that smell **assaulted** my brain again, like a cloud of smoke from a forest fire. Thick, painful, billowing bright danger in the distance. Descending the stairs, dark blotches riddled the walls in random spots. No rhyme or reason to their placement. No surface or scene spared from the splattered stains.

*Blood.*

I bent my head low at the realization, letting out an automatic frightened whimper, not at the sight, but ***the volume***. There’s only so much blood in a person. I jumped in shock, a sensation between my back legs sending me sprawling awkwardly in the living room. Scrambling claws struggled to find purchase on the highly polished floor.

Twisting my head, I huffed—my tail, tucked under my body. *Dumb.* I sniffed around. My nose picked up a tingle of something fresh and flowery under the blanket of decay spreading through the house. Toward the kitchen at the back, I froze in the central hall. A limp fuzzy form.

Shivering and cautious, I approached, pushing at it with my nose. Dead. Fresh. Headless, gutted cat. A whine escaped me. ***It shouldn’t be here***. A headless cat couldn’t have walked into the house on its own. My head swerved back and forth, ears angling for sounds of danger. Nothing. Not a sound besides the creaking floor shrinking in the cold winter night.

A worry, a concern to be certain, but no clear source of threat in residence. That smell tickled its way into my nostrils again. Birds, flowers, fresh-cut grass, a stream in the distance. *In a house?* I gingerly padded into the kitchen, stopping dead in my tracks. **Primus**, or something that could only be the influence of whatever it was.

Above the kitchen counter stood a window looking into darkening skies. Beside that window, cut into the solid wall, shone a view of high noon glare. Birds called for mates in glorious joy, insects buzzed around blooming flowers, and a copse of trees stood in the distance. A few tangled roots curled like fingers around the countertop.

I almost leapt in fright again, backing up against the fridge. The alien sight of roots gripping silverware in the fumbling grasp of disjointed digits made me fight the urge to wretch. **Such disgust.** Leaning against the cabinets with one paw, I prodded the longest root with another. The roots fled in shock. It felt so unnatural that I barked with hate at the horrible creation. Realizing my mistake instantly, I began pacing, wondering what to do.

A sound. **Metal on metal.** I shook with sudden terror. *Damn it.* I needed more time. The cops had missed this, of course. *Maybe I was the only one who could see it?* I had no idea how this worked. I couldn’t be found **here.** I had to search the home for clues. Leaping onto the counter, I tumbled onto my side as I heard a door open. *Why did I have to bark like an idiot?* Scrambling, I crawled into the gleaming hole, hiding among the grass as the officer explored the house, flashlight and **gun** drawn.

There was nothing more to do but wait and watch. Several tense minutes crept by as the man searched, his light bobbing up and down, disappearing up the stairs and coming back down. He spoke into his radio, his words indistinct, just noise without purpose. Clearly shaken, his scent a mix of coffee, cigarettes and distress, sweat trickling down his face, he holstered his weapon and left.

I pushed to leave the meadow, stretching into eternity with the kind of beauty and splendor reserved for visions of heaven. I wanted not a moment more to be drenched in this obvious lie and fabrication. My paw swiped against a **plastic box**. I paused, gazing around the clearing. It was the only human thing in this fragment of altered reality where darkness never fell.

***Pete***.

He put it here. This was his house after all. *Technically*. Attached to his house at the very least. Flipping it over with a swipe of one paw, and after several attempts, the hard grey plastic tumbled to reveal an old tape player with a tape inside. *Well, I’m here now.* Another long stretch of mismanaged paw swipes later, the tape began to play. I wasn’t sure what to expect, but then a random, almost agonized squealing erupted from the recorder.

It took a long while to figure out the problem. *Words still meant nothing to me.* I shifted back. A thought, a will, and a rush of exhaustion.

“Pleaseeeeeeeeeeee! I… need… stop… you can do whatever you want to me. Please. **Please.** Please. No more.” My tongue swelled in my throat. I bent my face toward the player. A woman’s voice begging in the most desperate fashion. A squelching tear of something and screaming. The loudest, most horrible screaming I’d ever heard.

A heavy thud, followed by a clatter. Bashing. An object slammed against the floor. ***Gurgling***. I cringed. My stomach emptied as I realized what had just happened.

“No more… Please… Pete. *I’ll never tell anyone*…. Please… You’ve had enough.” I pushed the tape player away into a flower. The blooming bulb tilted toward yet more sounds of screaming torment. Some of the plant's slender roots wrapped around the device, growing thicker and stronger with the passing of each jet engine's loud shouts of suffering.

I wanted nothing to do with any of this but… to my infinite despair, I didn’t move to stop the tape. Even after several minutes of labored breaths and splattering sounds. “***Please***… *Please* let me go.” She sobbed in a vain attempt at release. “I won’t tell them. **I won't.** I won’t. *I’ll never tell anyone…* what you did to me.” Sobbing. A shattered broken being holding out a forlorn hope of escape.

“What about what I’m going to do **to you?**” Pete’s wicked voice leaked with vicious intent. She screamed again while Pete giggled. From the play of sounds alone it felt in that horrific way that Pete might be dancing with joy while stabbing the woman.

“Please…” She begged weakly.

“Pwease wet me go.” Pete mocked her with a wicked laugh. “But the feast hasn’t even begun. Do you want some quivering breast Bridgette? It’s **ever so** *delicious*.” I fought hard to keep an empty stomach from surging out of my nether regions. “*No?* More for me.” Pete giggled again happy as can be.

Muffled cries through cloth. Dull slick **pounding.** Moans. Teeth grinding loud as a van backfiring. Spluttering splash. *Drips.* I couldn’t move. Frozen under the pressure of witnessing this ghastly crime. Ripping. Wailing. Gurgle. Foamy spluttering.

Pete bent low to the tape recorder chewing into the microphone. Wet crunch of skin and sinew, slapping teeth and smacking lips. ***Sickening*** crack of bones. Slabs of quivering flesh squeezed to dapple drops of blood into a waiting mouth. Chewing, loud open maw clacking tongue echoing through the meadow.

I came back to my senses after a short while as Bridgette continued to whimper and **curse**. Screaming endless swears while Pete sliced at her young flesh. He spent ages relishing the experience of the meat. Exclaiming at the feel while rubbing it on his face and chest. He kicked her. Spat on her. Laughed while he hacked off her fingers and forced her to choke on them. Describing the most minute detail of his heinous actions to his hapless bound victim. *She didn’t seem conscious anymore.* No more words. Barely any sounds.

I wanted to set the bastard on **fire** and watch him burn. Do it again. *A thousand times over.*

I rushed for the tape, no longer able to stand the evil I was witnessing. That poor girl. The horrific things done to her. ***For what?*** What had **Primus** turned Pete into? My hands clutched the recorder, *but the flower*, as tall as a sapling, fought back. My fingers gripped the player so hard I worried it might rip apart, like so much of Bridgette’s body. “Fuck!” The plant stabbed me in the shoulder, a spear right through my shirt, impacting bone. A fiery jolt of pain, followed by a slash across my face.

Rolling away, I watched in disgust as the screams **erupted** again. The tape player sank into the dirt, the bright tulip expanding with a sickening bloat. *Fertilizer.* The shard of insanity fueled by suffering. Terror. Cold, bleak power seeped into my bones. Ignoring the wound in my shoulder, I clawed out of the small gap, falling with a thud onto the floor.

Shifting back to a dog, my vision blurred. The reflex saved my life, the pain dulled but ever-present. I had to escape the house and the horror within.

Cool moonlight shone through a frosted window, casting an ethereal glow in the dim room. Foggy breaths condensed against the tile floor as I tried to center myself. My tail hung limp, and the house seemed to shift around me with a gust of dark, howling wind. Suddenly, the stench of fermenting urine and the rush of fecal fluid were all the warnings I received.

Instinct *took over.* I bounded in any direction that would have me, my face colliding with the counter. My body spun in a flailing sprawl, a splintering crash of shattered cabinets mere inches behind me. Furious rivers of panic surged through my veins, my heart pounding wildly in my chest.

**A boar!** It twisted with a scrape of tusks in the space my fur had occupied a second ago. Jitters of dismay rattled through my frantic paws as I scrambled toward the hall. The boar rocketed into the wall where I had just stood. I landed on its back, my paws dancing wild hysteria steps, pushing off before its mouth of spears could twist enough to impale me.

I lunged past it into the living room. Flashing lights from outside rushed toward the home. I perched on the couch to view my foe, only to feel claws slicing through the fabric. Black and orange stripes ripped through the loveseat, sending dread speeding me away from the emergent predator. A pause as the tiger tore a spring from the old cloth couch. I tossed a glance at the carnage in the kitchen.

Empty. The boar had vanished.

A musky, iron-laced roar tweaked my ears back in terror as the massive predator pounced from the couch into the hall. With nowhere left to flee, I trundled up the stairs, repeatedly slamming my face into what felt like every step. Adrenaline surged, fueling my frantic escape as my doggy brain raced for a source of safety.

A hesitant glance toward the impending thunderous threat revealed... *a ferret?* It practically glided up the banister. I did a double take and sidestepped in distilled confusion. What fell upon the top of the stairs boggled my mind beyond repair. With a calamitous impact and a cavernous snapping crush, a bulbous gargantuan hippo threatened to bring the entire house down on our heads. Fleeing in abject terror down the short hall, I entered the first open door.

I found myself amidst a strewn array of disheveled home goods, *my initial entry point*. Shouting and roaring erupted from various sources behind me. The hippo minced the half-open door in a split second, its impressive maw tossing obstacles out of the way as it hurtled toward my piss-stained position.

**Onto the roof!** I was there before I finished the thought. **Gunfire** erupted. Too scared by my current predicament to worry about where it was aimed, I shot my night-vision eyes this way and that, looking for a soft spot to land. A bumbling human was close enough. I struck the cop square in the face, sending both of us rolling in a heap of limbs. Already off at full tilt into the nearby woods, a handgun fired wildly after me. The screeching call of some sort of bird echoed across the black skies.

I had no idea how much time had passed or how much ground I had covered as my compact furry form raced through the woods. The **crack of thunder** skidded me to a halt. Panting in the night air, I realized I had been running toward a human outline. A smoking metal chamber lowered from the heavens, the acrid scent of sulfur and charcoal bombarding my lungs. Unconcerned about a human, no matter what implement of destruction they wielded, I turned toward a red, dilapidated house.

“Guthy?” My best friend Kyle's terrified voice reached my ears, sounding like he was debating whether to fire more accurately for the sake of his sanity.

I stood before him in my human form, grown to sixteen years of pig-headed stupidity. “I... I don’t know what to do, Kyle. It just keeps getting...” I never got to finish my admission. Exhausted, terrified, and bleeding from a dozen grazes and gashes, I collapsed in a heap.

As I lay there, I noticed one of my wounds, blood oozing from it. Stealing a droplet with a wandering finger I tasted the sharp faintly metallic fluid, feeling a tingling rush of slight energy. "When was I struck?" I wondered aloud, the realization of my injuries dawning on me.

I tried to push Kyle away, to keep him out of this realm of insanity. But at the first sign of death-defying fright, I had run right back into his care.

“Oh my God, **you’re bleeding**! Come with me. **Come on.** To the shed.” Kyle wrapped his arms around my shoulders without question, dragging my limp, dazed form languidly into the tool shed.

“Where’d you nab a gun?” I asked him partway through his fumbling fingers doing their best not to increase my dull injuries.

Kyle paused reaching to check that the snubnose hadn’t migrated from where he placed it. “My dad thinks he lost it a few years ago.” Kyle smiled slyly, watching my head flick toward his rundown home. “Don’t worry, he’s sipping swill off the floor of whatever bar he was closest to. Ma … *well,* if she hears anything in one ear out the needle. Almost done.”

I found a slight comfort in Kyle’s general disdain, his ease, the casual manner he handled pretty much anything, even me charging at him from the black night. I wish I could say the same for myself.
