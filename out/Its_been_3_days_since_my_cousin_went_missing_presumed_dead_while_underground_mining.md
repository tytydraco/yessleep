 They searched the caverns for weeks, searching for any plausible clue or evidence of what had happened to him. When one of the investigators was almost crushed by a dangling rock from above, they called the search off, claiming it was too dangerous and he was likely deceased. I still remember the funeral, my aunt too numb to cry anymore, the hope she once had that he would be found by somebody and brought home safely, an astonishing rejoice of the man we once knew with celebratory dinner cooling warmly at the dinner table. All of it had appeared and vanished at once like fire. 

  She stood up to the podium in frozen grief as she tried to speak on the life of her only son. Her eyes darted around the room, looking at everyone collectively frowning. She looked at me, who was stone-faced but clearly broken. 

 “Fate has brought us here today,” she staggered. “We’re not supposed to be here right now, in this room, mourning my son, yet here we are.” The microphone in her hand seemed to slip from her grasp as the sweat of fear, sadness and anger all at once protruded around the sleek material. She raised her voice again and spoke, but I couldn’t hear it. I couldn’t listen, I wouldn’t listen. How could this have happened? How could a kid I’ve known my whole life, the kid I would throw dodgeballs at when we were six to the man that told me he was going to live in Australia for six months because he wanted to travel the world, suddenly go missing under a bunch of rocks in the ground? 

   It wasn’t fair. It truly wasn’t. I turned around and left without anyone noticing. I snuck out the back doors of the church and slipped into the small town streets. I shoved my hands in my pockets and trudged back to my house, eyeing the ground as I walked. At first my mind was blank, simply reiterating the sound of my footsteps hitting the ground over and over again, and soon I started to think. 

  I worked as security at the mine, and my cousin worked underground. He went missing while I was there, sometime in the day around 4 PM. But how? By 4, the underground workers came back up to get dressed and be home by 5.

 So why was he still down there at that time? And why was he alone? “Underground miners usually move in groups,” he told me once. “And if there’s an off-chance that someone does get separated, they almost never stray too far away from the group.” Something bobbled around in my head before I finally was able to grasp it, like finding the keys you dropped down the car seat. 

*(What if he isn’t/wasn’t lost?)*

   I shuddered at the thought, and tried to batter it out of my head but couldn’t. It was a definite possibility. Someone may have been down there with him (*alone?)* and may have steered him *(kidnapped him)* the wrong way? Then again, they all hopped on the elevator and left at 5. 

*(a ghost)*

   I took my balled up fist and slammed it into the side of my head. I was starting to come to ridiculous conclusions. *(Fuck off, you know that shit doesn’t exist.)* My mind and I seemed to separate from each other like a detached wire. I was thinking of the most absurd possibilities and yet it all seemed like it could be true. I got to my house, shut the door and lied in my bed with the lights out and curtain shut. The room still dimmed a covered shade of blue from outside, it was only 6 PM. I dozed off angrily.

  I awoke in a straight-forward dirt tunnel. I felt the ground carve itself into my hand as I stumbled forward into the nothingness. There was no light source, but I could see the top of the oval-shaped tunnel. It was maybe 8 feet tall, with rocks falling occasionally onto my head. In front of me, it was simply black. I looked behind me and saw a dead end. Everything behind and above me was sealed off with groupings of thick dirt, it was hard like clay and wouldn’t budge. I had no clue how I arrived here, so I pushed on forward with steeled nerves.

 An irregular thumping sound was placed in the distance. Was it my heart? I listened closely.

*THUMP!*

 It was coming from above and far away, like hearing someone call to their friends on the shore from the lake. It was loud and quick, like kicking open a door with your foot. 

*THUMP!*

 It got closer the farther I got down the tunnel. I noticed eventually that I couldn’t hear anything else, let alone my own footsteps. The only source of noise was that thump. 

*THUMP THUMP!*

 It was directly above me now, it had to be. I dashed, but every time I ran the noise got closer.

*THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP!*

 They were footsteps, I was sure of it. They had the subtle squeaking sound when the middle part of the foot connected with the ground. I paused, frozen in statue-stance as I listened again for the footsteps. 

 Nothing. 

 I took another step.

*THUMP!*

 It was moving with me, like everything I was doing was scripted. I paused and waited to see if the figure would go away, standing in a frozen stance for about five minutes when I heard:

*SCREECH!*

 It sounded like a door opening. I realized that whoever that was just opened a possible manhole from above, and was climbing down to greet me. Every sound they made was as if it was ingrained in my skull, as I knew this mysterious figure was climbing down a ladder at a rapid pace. I had to shake it, had to keep moving as there was no other way out. So I ran again.

 My feet carried themselves as I bolted to the end of the tunnel, if there was an end of the tunnel. As I ran I noticed my shadow bouncing off the quiet lighting of the tunnel walls, my silhouette looking almost mysterious, like it didn’t look like me. This caused me to stop, and I realized the sound wasn’t coming anymore. I checked behind me, and saw nothing. Maybe they left. Reminding myself about the silhouette, I looked at my arm.

 I had darker skin and longer hands than I thought. They stretched longer than I imagined. I peered down at my blue shoes with white laces.

 I don’t have blue shoes with white laces. My cousin does. Then I knew.

 I was him, alone in the mines. This was a dream, but real all at once. 

 And then the noise came again.

*PANG! PANG! PANG!*

 The figure was digging through the covered dirt with a shovel. It was coming for me. 

*WHUMP!*

 Sounds of dirt falling from the hole it dug. And then the pacing. It was running after me in the dark.

*THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP TH-*

 The noise cut off like the swing of a knife. I walked forward with my head on a swivel. After walking in silence for about 10 minutes, I saw a door. *(A door? In a completely unknown part of an underground mine?)* I had to open it. I jetted forward and latched my hand on the knob.

*Thump.*

 I woke up in my bed. I jumped and bolted to the mine across town. Here I am. I know where my cousin is.

And he’s not alone.
