I’ve had just about enough of this. A lot of you in the comments of my earlier updates have told me just to quit- that this craziness isn’t worth it. I should’ve just listened to your advice. 

I’ve been trying to rationalize everything over the past few days, and maybe I’d be able to succeed in this rationalization if less had happened. But there are too many pieces, too many incidents that make this impossible for me to explain away as something normal. Trevor had some sort of mental break, the rats are unexplainably flooding the store this season yet I haven’t seen a single one, only heard them, the noises in the aisles are either rats or some other type of pest, the strings are just pieces of plastic that are, for some reason, swarming the store from an unknown source. It’s too much. Something is going on and I don’t want any part in it. I think this will be my last shift. They can keep their raises and their extra hours, I’d rather struggle with my finances than go on working every day in fear. 

It isn’t just my bosses anymore, it’s everyone. Every single one of my coworkers walk with the same unbalanced march and the same wide grin. They all speak to me in the same, fake, sickly-sweet voice that drives me insane. I feel like a cell under a microscope.

Every shift is worse than the last. I work 2 sections now, given the extra hours I’ve been able to finish more. I begin with home décor. It’s an easy department made up of 2 aisles and it usually only takes about 30 to 40 minutes for me to finish it. Unfortunately, it’s dead in the middle of the store, meaning I’m completely surrounded when I work here. It’s become normal for me to lift my head up while working only to see either my boss or one of my coworkers, sometimes multiple people, standing at the end of my aisle grinning at me.

The noises haven’t gone away either. At this point, I’m sure it’s not rats. They're too loud. Whatever is in there is much, much bigger than a rat. The smell also has changed proportionally to the sounds. The entire store reeks of rot and decay. And something else too- a sort of acidic, bile-like smell. Have you ever been at a county fair and walked by someone's vomit? It’s like that but far stronger. It mingles with the stench of death to make working inside almost unbearable. 

Luckily, after this 30 to 40 minute period, I go outside to work in my other department, the garden section. Being outside gives me relief from the smells, but it has its own unexplainable horrors to terrorize me while I work. 

I see things out there that I'm not sure are real or not. And, I'm not sure if I'm being paranoid with this, there seems to be a perpetual layer of thin mist every night. The lights outside are motion activated, and they'll shut off by themselves if they're left alone for about 10 minutes. 

A few nights ago, I was working outside. The only illuminated area was where I was working- located in the middle third of the department. Long, dark alleys were to my front and back. I kept hearing these noises from both sides, but when I checked, I saw nothing but blackness. This went on for about 20 minutes until the light behind me flicked on. I turned around to see my other manager, Rich. He was standing at the end of the dim hallway, smiling at me. I couldn't make out many details, he was a good few feet away. At this point I was fed up and I clocked out and left early that shift.

Over that weekend, I was doing my normal list of chores; cleaning, organizing, and doing laundry. There were so many plastic strings on my work clothes that I needed to use a lint roller to remove them before I could wash them. I talked to my friends about all that's happened and they all told me I'm being paranoid. Again, they told me everything is explainable and I'm freaking out when I should just be accepting the easy pay. I let them convince me, but that was before tonight. 

I was working in the truck and nearly finished. I don't think I can include images, but I'm sure you all know what the inside of a semi looks like. Its dark and dusty, with a wall of boxes to my back that I'm meant to throw onto a conveyer belt for the others to organize.

I was deep in the truck, give or take 30 feet from the entrance. To give some context, the conveyer is quite heavy and usually requires 2-3 people to move in or out of the truck. Normally I'm facing away from the entrance in order to move the products onto the conveyor. Also, I can usually see my coworkers moving to and from the belt, organizing freight by their respective pallets. 

But tonight, there was a good amount of time where I felt alone. I saw no one, heard no one talking, no footsteps, not even music from the store. I turned back to the wall of boxes behind me, grabbing one off the floor, when the conveyor belt was yanked out of the semi in an instant. I turned only in time to see the door of the truck slam shut on me, leaving me in complete darkness.

I expected to hear footsteps, or the same noises that I had been hearing in the aisles. I expected to smell the same rot and decay that had been plaguing the store for weeks now. But I didn’t. It was completely silent.

I reached for the phone in my pocket to use it for light but before I could, something grabbed my wrist, pinning it to the wall. I yanked against whatever had my hand stuck, but I felt like a fish fighting against fishing line. I used my other hand to grab my phone. I turned the flashlight on and pointed it to my wrist. It was ensnared by what must have been hundreds of thin, glassy wires. I turned the phone to the truck door and my stomach dropped. snaking across the floor towards me were more strings. They moved independently from any controller or source like  sentient beings.

I used my box cutter to free myself, slicing the ropes off my wrist with difficulty. I think the acidic smell was coming from them. I ran to the truck's door. Luckily, there's a handle on the inside, otherwise I'm sure I'd still be trapped in there. I flung it open to see my coworkers moving freight from the belt, which now stood across the receiving area, as if nothing had happened. 

I shouted at them, asking them why they hadn't helped me. I don't know why I bothered asking, I was answered only with grins and overly friendly apologies that I knew meant nothing. 

I went outside to gather myself a little bit. I think I'm done. I'm going to go tell Rich I quit, get my last paycheck, and be done with all this craziness. Hopefully, I won't be updating you guys about this place anymore. Thank you all for your advice. I'm only sorry I didn't listen to you guys sooner.
