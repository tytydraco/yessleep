Let's start with a refresher: my job is to clean up scenes before they become known crime scenes. I clean up murders, drug dens, and brothels from time to time. Being told to clean a crack house or something doesn't phase me much but when Bossman said to clean up an aquarium before opening, I'll be honest, I had to think about that. Last time I cleaned an aquarium, I was like sixteen? And it was my little sister’s after her betta died so Mom could replace it. I guess you could say I've been doing this job for a while. Well, when Bossman said I was headed to an aquarium, I had a bad feeling. Dilapidated houses and abandoned buildings are one thing; a functional business that people are expected to visit in a few hours are another.

When I pulled up, there were a few stragglers leaving the aquarium at closing; families, friend groups, maybe some couples on a date, but they all looked at the windowless, white panel van with no logo, phone number or even number plate with the same face, concern and disgust. Once the final car departed from the lot, I loaded up my caddy, piled my supplies on the gurney and headed toward the entryway, where an employee stood waiting for me.

“Thank you for coming on such short notice,” he said, shaking my hand with an appreciative smile. I noticed his name tag said “Greg.”

“Part of the job,” I replied, taking note of his strong shake. “So, what happened, the octopus made an escape and strangled somebody?”

He chuckled politely but I could see in his eyes that it had happened in the past, maybe more than once. He gestured for me to follow and we spoke as we walked.“No, no, we, um… found something in the shark tank exhibit that we couldn't explain.”

“What, an arm? Number plate? An Air Tag?”

He shook his head and unlocked a large door, the words “Great Barrier Reef” painted in wavy letters over it. “No, it wasn't from one of the sharks or in the tank.” He held the door open and I saw an enormous, green tentacle laid out across the 16 meter room, hanging against the plexiglass by a single suction cup. “We found this when we opened up this morning. We don't know where it came from or how it got here. The security cameras went down all night last night and when they came back up, this was here.”

I stared wide-eyed at the tentacle then turned slowly to Greg and asked, “What kind of animal is that?”

“We had some of our biologists take samples and try identifying what it could've come from. The DNA doesn't match any cephalopod we have here or any fossils we've studied. The largest cephalopod is the Giant Pacific Octopus but no one has found one this big. That largest one found had 30 feet long tentacles and this is at least 20 feet longer.”

I looked down at the severed end of the tentacle, a pool of dried, green blood spanning at least six meters across. Then I froze.

Green blood? I thought, looking down at my current blood cleaner, wondering if this'll even make a dent in whatever biological makeup makes green blood. “Well, it's not going to clean itself,” I sighed, pulling my gloves out of my caddy.

“I'll be in the security office,” Greg mentioned. “Just let me know when you're finished and I'll lock everything up after you.” He then left me alone with this giant tentacle and the personal quest of What the Hell Cleans Green Blood? I started with the easy stuff, the suction cup stuck to the plexiglass, and focused on what I could do and handle. Eventually the clean up job became just like every other job; clean up the stuff and move on.

After an hour or two, multiple chemical concoctions and one mental breakdown, the tile was back to its weird, not-white color with no evidence of some supernatural tentacles just appearing out of nowhere. I gathered up my supplies and trash on the gurney and headed for the door.

But it didn't open.

“Umm… Greg!” I called through the door. “The, uh… door won't open?”

No answer.

Okay, there's got to be a way out of here, I thought and scanned the room around me. There was only one other door in the room labeled “Employees Only.” I figured I might as well and tried to open it. Unlocked, and not just a room but a hallway. Perfect. I dragged my gurney with me down this dark hallway, seeing only a light at the end of the hall. Maybe this leads to the security office?
The light was shining through an ajar door and voices came from the other side. Multiple voices… weird since Greg was supposed to be the only one still here.

“I told you,” a woman's voice hiss-whispered, “we drew the summon wrong! You're just lucky we closed it in time before something else came out!”

“And I told you,” a man's voice responded, “we should've just given it Kyle! No one would've missed him!”

“Hey,” I'm guessing Kyle whined. “I said I was sorry. I didn't know it was Cthulhu’s summon when I printed it.”

“The website was still on the page, Kyle! It said ‘Cthulhu’ in the web address!”

“Well I got the right one now, right?”

The woman sighed heavily and answered, “One way to find out.”

I leaned against the wall and peered out the crack in the door to see three tour guides laying out offerings and drawing a paint outline on the face of a large, empty tank. A woman with brown hair in a high bun, two men with shaggy brown and black hair, all wearing white collared shirts with the aquarium logo on the left breast pocket and khaki pants. The woman was painting a large circle on the tank with wiggly sigils inside while the two men put out shark teeth the size of their hands on the floor corresponding with the sigils on the tank, all under the light of blue and green candles surrounding them on the floor.

I've seen a Cthulhu summoning circle and can see how Kyle could've gotten the two mixed up once the woman got it all done. But at the same time, if the web address had Cthulhu in the name, you really need to check your logic skills, guy.

They stood outside the shark tooth circle and started chanting in a language that almost sounded like they were drowning. I took my phone out and started recording, poorly since it was a crappy phone, as they swayed slowly, chanting loudly. The air started to feel cold around me, the sound of a low rumble filling my ears. My lungs began to burn and I tried suppressing a cough, suddenly I felt like I was drowning. I held my breath and watched as they started spitting up water while chanting. The feeling of cold water flowing surrounded me and the rumble got louder.

The three employees fell to their knees and started coughing up onto the floor. “Kyle,” the black haired man choked out. “This better be the right one.”

The blonde man, I guess Kyle, fell flat on the floor, water pouring from his mouth steadily. The woman looked from Kyle to the other man, coughing harshly, her face was red, her eyes were watering and her lips were turning blue. The closest candles to them were extinguished by the splash of water and the tank face started crackling. I held the door with one hand, ready to close it when the glass eventually broke, starting to feel lightheaded from lack of air. The cracks started to grow in the glass, the remaining employees watching the cracks connect in the painted circle when the glass shattered, raining shards down on their heads. The water never moved though, it remained in the tank like nothing happened.

The remaining two fell to their knees, heaving water from their lungs continuously, and a  Great White Shark head poked slowly out of the water, black eyes immobile in their sockets.

“G-great Enceladus,” the woman spoke between bought of coughing, “We, your servants, beg your aid in our war with your celestial brother, Pluto.”

The shark stepped out of the tank, his lower half resembling a human man, and stood around three metres tall. His skin was a grey/blue color with a pure white chest, a shark fin protruding from his back and fins hanging from his sides. “Pluto has been stripped of his power,” the shark man explained, his voice a deep low rumble, almost a growl. “He has no power over your world.”

“I have heard rumors of acolytes gathering in his name, my lord,” she explained. “Rumors that they gather and attempt to revive him through sacrifice but one lone man has been stopping them. We wish to aid in his endeavor to ensure Pluto remains banished from this system and peace continues to reign for you and your celestial brethren.” The water stopped choking her and just spilled from her mouth like she was gargling. She watched the shark man lift his head toward the ceiling and blink a few times, either thinking or listening to something silent. 

He looked back at her, his glassy black eyes keeping her gaze locked. “I will convene with the other celestials and, if we come to an agreement, Pluto will no longer be of the humans' concern.” He then knelt slowly and, with both fins or in front of him, he lifted Kyle's body toward himself and began to devour his body whole.

The last thing I saw was the woman covering her mouth with her hand before I turned away, the sound of flesh tearing and bones breaking invading my ears. I grabbed my gurney a little to steady myself, slowly turned and crept away, careful not to alert the woman or man-eating shark god. This is way above my pay grade, I reasoned as I returned to the previous room to see Greg standing in the open doorway, looking for me.
“Oh, there you are,” he sighed, relief washing over his face. “I thought you left or I was crazy cause it looks like nothing happened here.”

I took that at a mental pat-on-the-back. “That is our job.”
He then guided me back to the entryway and out to my van in silence.

“Oh,” I said after starting it up, “before I go, does the name “Enceladus” mean anything to you?

“The Roman giant or the moon orbiting Saturn?” He asked.

I braced myself and answered, “A shark god?”

“A god? Uh… I never took religious studies in school and the closest thing I know to a shark god would be King Shark from DC comics. Why, did you find religion there or something?”

I'm honestly surprised I didn't get called back in to clean up the second summoning I saw. I didn't bring it up to Bossman what I saw considering his reaction to the basement cult and his new prescription for nitroglycerin pills after the asylum summoning.

Sorry I've been gone so long, we finally got a new guy and since he's a little older than me, he doesn't feel the need to listen when I tell him something or remind him or anything. Training someone who thinks they know what they're doing already seems easy until you realize this man has only worked office jobs and still leaves all the cleaning to his mommy. So he THINKS he knows what he's doing and doesn't care to listen. I give him a week.
