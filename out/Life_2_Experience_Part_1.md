 I'm writing the below in third person, because I'm still processing, and it's too difficult to write in the first person. Here is part one of my brother's disappearance.

  
James took a sip of codeine, melted into the couch, agitated over the phone call his brother was having in the other room. It'd grown more serious as of late, Eric's belief in what he was peddling. Or was Eric just a great salesman? A good person who wanted the best for his customers? James had to tiptoe around the subject of belief, Eric needed something to grasp on to. Some hope while sitting at home on house arrest, awaiting trial for something he definitely did. James was two weeks into rehab when he learned his brother had gotten into trouble. He left rehab as soon as he heard. He wanted to help, but each day it seemed his brother was disappearing. One of those crazies. Shit, after all that'd happened? Who wouldn't?

A half-drunk bottle of codeine sat on the coffee table in front of him, the last of the five he'd gone through in the three weeks he'd been here, out in this fucking ramshackle town in this ramshackle house. It helped with sleep. It helped to make him feel a little warmer, too. It did not help with his sales pitch, because he hated the people that called in. He took another sip of the codeine, mixed in with seven-up.

Then the red phone rang, an old school landline on the coffee table. He let it go through. Eric was probably giving some pathetic pleading look, *answer the phone*. But nah. James pointed to the clock, then looked over, and saw Eric wasn't even paying attention, too engrossed in whoever was speaking on the other end of the line. You can't connect with people when you're beyond the point of reproach.

They played xbox, really just James playing and Eric sitting there with a glint in his eye. James dared to ask where Eric's head was at.

Eric thought a moment, a flicker of a smile. *It's like, really connecting with these people, hearing their life stories, and then dreaming together about Life 2.*

*So that's all well and good until you admit you're frauding these people,* James said.

And then Eric didn't say anything. And James shot a look at him.

*Yeah, man, I don't know -- is it fraud?*

*Selling a ticket to an experience that doesn't exist?*

*It's not about that, it's the conversation we get to have.*

*So now you're the therapist? Well, let me tell you from my experience, as an actual therapist, lying to your patients and indulging in make-believe isn't the recommended kind of treatment.*

*Well. There's many ways to heal. And you didn't finish.*

*I don't need a phD to feel a little concerned about ripping people off.*

Their conversation ended there. But it hurt James more than he let on.

The red phone rang again. James felt his brother staring at him. Fine. He leaned forward. Whoa. Codeine really doubles gravity's powers. Funny. But by the time he picked up the phone it had stopped ringing. James collapsed backwards. Eric returned to his notebook, noting the sales he made, and whom he needed to call back. After, he walked through the cold room making sure the windows were properly shut, in a buckskin coat since their heat didn't work. James knew it was for him -- Eric didn't really get cold.

*Why didn't you pick up?* Eric suddenly asked.

*They'll call back if they really want my help committing suicide,* said James.

*What the hell, man?*

*Yeah. It's called suicide -- no matter how you mask it.*

*If you're moving onto live another life? That's not -- you're wrong.*

*Say you're right. You leave this life to go to something called Life 2 experience. You're gone. I'm here but you're gone. What am I supposed to call that? What happens to your body? Do I have to bury it? Where'd your conscious go?*

Eric bit his lip. Clearly uncertain. Good, be anxious, James thought.

Without an answer, Eric went outside. James called his name, and Eric smiled and said he just wanted to look at the stars. Then, he said, *people just want to feel good, man. And if I can do that for them...then...Cause I would want someone to do that for me.* And then Eric left and shut the door behind him.

James sat still for a few minutes, in and out of a blissful, syrupy nothingness. The damn red phone. Who would answer *his* calls? Shoved the phone off the table with the bottom of his foot, the phone falling off the hook. He went to the window and watched Eric, who sat outside. Rain drizzled down.

*Eric, come inside,* James stood a few yards behind him on the grass, as Eric stared up at the sky, surrounded at all sides by trees.

*It's nice out here.*

Forget it, James thought, turning to go inside. But Eric continued:

*Can I tell you a theory, that's probably not true?*

*Uh. Yeah.*

*It's not my theory.*

*Just say it, dude. I'm curious.*

*Rain drops are tears from a loved one in another life.*

*That's...* James felt his stomach turn. The hope in his brother's voice. The quiver of hope. *That's nice, Eric. I like that theory.*

*Yeah.*

*Sad tears or happy tears?*

*Huh. I guess it depends.*

For a moment, they both looked up at the dark sky from which an infinite number of tears fell.

James went back inside. He picked the red phone up off the ground and put it back on the table. The cord had pulled out, and he had to jam it back in. Maybe he'd answer the next call, tomorrow, after the payment finally arrived.Â 

But it never came, which pissed James off. They argued, because Eric didn't want to ask the secretive Mr. Silverstein, their boss, about it, so they agreed to play the tortilla game. If James won, Eric would ask. The tortilla game was simple. One person took a mouthful of water. The other took a big flour tortilla and slapped it across the water-holder's face. If they laughed -- due to the hilarity of the slapping noise -- and spit out their water, the water-holder lost. Each would get a turn.

James wound up bigger than he ever had before, and Eric's eyes went wide. The tortilla cracked hard and loud against Eric's freckled face. Eric spit the water out immediately, dying laughing. And then actually dying. James froze. What's happening? Eric couldn't breathe. Couldn't intake air. Choking on water? How do you choke on water? James looked around, as if someone were there to help. Grabbed his phone. Call 911? For what? Choking on water? How's he actually choking? *Should I call 911?* Eric didn't respond, grabbing a paper bag and breathing into it. And slowly, breath returned. Looking it up later, it had something to do with a spasmodic reaction from your throat protecting you from drowning. James appreciated the body's protective instincts. Did he not have any himself? He didn't even call 911. He just stood there.

He vowed to answer the next call that came but there was only silence, and he fell asleep on the couch. But at 3am he jolted awake to a blaring ringing. Oh. The phone. He pushed himself up onto an arm. Rubbed his eyes. Laid back down. The ringing bouncing around his skull. Reached over, banging his hand against the table til he found the phone and brought it to his ear, eyes still closed.
