This is a true story and it haunts me every single night.

It all started on a Tuesday night around 2:00 in the morning. I'm lying alone in bed in the dark and my window is cracked open. I prefer having a breeze at night to stay cool. I open my window every single night. It doesn’t matter if it’s hot or cold or windy or rainy I will open my window. 

Anyways, I had to make this post because it is really haunting me.

To explain, all of a sudden the noise started. I Remember my eyes rapidly opening and the shivers being brought down my spine. It was very paralyzing and it made my whole body jolt like a shockwave running through my nerves. This sensation is especially intense at night when you are startled by a noise like your old house resting. But this was unlike anything I’ve ever experienced. 

To start, the noise that scared me seemed to be a man shouting from a quarter of a mile away. I thought to myself that this was extremely unusual. I live in a desolate area and I don't have many neighbors around. So it couldn't have been them. I live in a woodsy area in a humble neighborhood.
Most people who live here are hermits and don’t leave their homes unless it’s for the biweekly grocery shopping or leaving in the morning to go to work. 

But, the screams were very specific and were arranged in a pattern. They almost sounded inhuman. A loud but faint yell would sound about every 2 seconds and the yells were unintelligible words and lasted for about 1-2 syllables. It was almost perfect sounding like a recording of a shout played again and again and again but for hours. The dreadful sounds stayed in place for 3 hours of non-stop yelling and the man never seemed to move locations except for when the noises slowly got farther away, and that’s when it seemed to stop. The sounds lasted from 2:00 am to 5:00 am.

I assume the man making the disturbance is in his early thirties. It haunts me to think of someone just standing in the forest blatantly yelling words for 3 hours straight in the middle of the night.

The sounds didn’t appear like they were desperate as If they were in need of any help. The only drastic thing would be if a bear mauled you to death but no one’s stupid enough to go out at night like this. The shouts sounded emotionless and of course very terrifying. 

I eventually was able to catch my breath and peek out the window. It wasn’t the wind causing the noise and most definitely wasn’t a branch scraping my window like someone would try claiming in order to debunk me. But I was too afraid to go outside and investigate. I had to debate whether calling the police would be the right thing to do or not. I’m a short woman and I’m not the absolute strongest and I know if I investigated on my own I would be the avid kidnapping victim. From watching and reading horror stories I know the person who investigates always dies in the end.

I kept my ear close to the window for a few minutes and I was starting to decrypt what he was saying. It sounded like it was in a different language or a gibberish word being spoken but it was very strange.

I know I’m not crazy, and I know what I heard.

I will probably never open my window ever again since I don't wanna find out who or what was making those sounds and I definitely do not want them to come back.

Does anyone know what this could be? I asked my neighbors if they heard and only one out of 4 claimed they did. We both don’t know what it was.
