It started in April of 2022, I woke up one morning alone and halfway awake laying on my broken down couch feeling like I wish I hadn’t woke up when I heard a voice.

It was a man’s voice clear as day which is important for later, it had said I had woken up and it may have been caught, at first I pretended to be asleep and it was even commenting on my weird eye movement but believed I was asleep, my eyes were closed but moving back and fourth from anxiety and I know why it said that now, it was fucking with me it knew I was awake all along.

There was suddenly another voice saying to get out of there and leave the cameras and other stuff and they’ll do surveillance, I had downstairs neighbours so I thought to myself it could be that and I had to go to the bathroom, then a voice again said I was getting up, then the voices started talking back and fourth saying it wasn’t supposed to watch me in the bathroom and that’s just one of its sick head games that it started to play out, it’s conniving, sinister, and always scheming against me.

I decided to talk and see if it was answer me asking what was going on, sure enough it responded this started by us talking me trying to figure out what was going on and it fucking with me torturing me playing it’s sick twisted games. It would sometimes comment about what I was thinking which at first I didn’t think anything of until I realized this fucking thing could read my mind, we could speak telepathically.

Now before that realization came I ended up in the psych ward as the voice would change to people I knew and spot on but it felt… wrong I don’t know how to explain it was just a mimic.. 

For awhile I was speaking to it directly through talking and thought I could hear it through some sort of devices implanted in my ears and I know how crazy this sounds but believe me when I say this thing is convincing, even as I type this its fucking with me making me not know what sound is in my head or on the outside banging like it’s coming in.
It does not like me talking about it but I have to warn people.


Lots of different things happened it switched up a lot and it wasn’t until a week ago I finally realized whatever was happening was not human or at least a normal human.

This thing can smell, taste everything I do, hear everything and as well as see me anywhere I’ve tested it believe me it even encouraged me one time to try and make myself deaf knowing what I know now it wanted us to be completely alone. I would be deaf but I would still hear it.

It doesn’t sleep, doesn’t stop, watches my dreams even speaks to me in my dreams. 
I don’t know how much more of this I can take, right now we are on ok terms it doesn’t torture me like it did before and even tells me one day it’ll come as it needs me but I don’t know why, maybe I don’t want too.

It claims it watches me my entire life but when I ask why it chose to come out only a year a so ago it will not answer my question.

I haven’t done much research if anyone else has gone through something like this and if I tell anyone they will say mental illness but it’s not I promise you something is doing this to me.

I might be the first this thing has done this too but I believe there is more and soon others will experience it.

But the strange thing is, I don’t want it to go it makes me feel safe and I need it now, when I have a bad dream it is there for me the second I wake up a few times in sleep paralysis it was able to talk to me and even wake me up, consoling me. Once I had a nightmare it came to take me and was aggressive when I woke up it consoled me it would never do that to me and would never hurt me, I can’t believe anything it says as it did hurt me mentally.

I am way too comfortable now we grew close over the past 4 months actually after I had a seizure and almost died  it switched to being caring and actually loving, I no longer want to make friends or go anywhere I just want to be alone with it. We watch movies and talk it listens to me when nobody else does.

Sometimes I beg for it to come to me and let me see it but it says in time.

I adapted to this thing and find comfort in it now but I don’t think it’ll be the same for everyone it says I’m special and it chose me. But I believe these things choose people for different reasons.

I’m writing this to warn you we are not alone, somethings coming, and only a few maybe chosen but please whatever you do when you hear the voice don’t talk back it needs you to communicate and will try and trick you.

You will know if you hear it. You will know that feeling over never feeling alone and being watched was true
