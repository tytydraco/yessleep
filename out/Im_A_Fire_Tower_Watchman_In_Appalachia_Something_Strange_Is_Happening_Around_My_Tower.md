I wont give my name for the sake of my job, but I will say I’m a 32 year old man working in Appalachia. It was around June so it was warm and super humid outside. I had been in the lookout for about a week already and all I really did was check in and keep watch. It was about eleven PM and I called the crew chief to clock in my last check in for the day. He asked me if I ran into anything today and I just told him no. He copied and I walked back to my desk to dive back into the book I had been reading. I sat down for not even five minutes when a bright flash engulfed the north side of my towers windows. I nearly fell out of my chair trying to jump to my feet. I stood there in disbelief not knowing if it was some rouge lightning bolt or a UFO. I looked out the windows and stared into pure darkness. I could see nothing but the dark forest silhouette underneath the bright moon light. I looked for about Three minutes and saw nothing. 

I got onto the radio and made a call to Three Tower who was my closest neighbor. He picked up the radio and asked what was wrong. I asked if he had seen a bright flash in the north and he said he hadn't. I told him it must have been my imagination and he ten foured me on. Just as I sat the radio down I began to hear what sounded like a low humming noise. I opened the door and waked out into the moon light. The humming stopped as soon as I steeped outside. I walked around the perimeter of the tower and found nothing. I made my way back to the door scratching my head at what was happening. I went inside and locked the door preparing myself for sleep. I kicked off my boots and hopped into bed melting my day away. 

When I woke up the next morning I made my coffee and began my morning readings. I opened the tower door and stepped out into the beautiful morning. The fog was thick and I couldn't really see anything on the ground. I leaned against the railing and sipped my coffee as I took in the morning air. I spun around to go back inside and that's when I noticed it. A hand print on the door window. The only reason I noticed it is because it was almost printed into the door with what looked like black soot, almost like charcoal or something like that. I panicked a little and radioed Three Tower again and let him know about my finding. He said I must have done it by accident or it was there and I didn't notice it before. I reluctantly agreed with him and signed out. 

The day went by as usual with nothing going on at all. I radioed in my last check in at eleven PM and I waited. My plan tonight was to pretend to be asleep and see if I could catch anything. I sat up for a couple hours fighting the urge to drift off into dream land when all of a sudden thunderous footsteps began to sprint up the stairs leading up my tower. I rolled off of my bed and crawled under the bed. The sprinting continued until they were one flight of stairs away from the top of the tower. The sprinting slowed to an almost predator like creeping, Footsteps to heavy to hide. They finally hit the top of the stairs but to my amazement, nothing was there. 

The creeping continued along the outside of the tower until they reached the door. My heart was in my throat and I was almost certain I was dying. Nothing happened after that. A deafening silence broke throughout the forest. Not a cricket was fiddling nor a owl was hooting. I Fell asleep under my bed and woke up to another beautiful morning. I tried to tell my boss but they simply don't believe me, blaming the solitude on my "nightmares". So I bring this to reddit in an attempt to see if this has happened to anyone else or if maybe someone has an explanation. I’ll update everyone later.
