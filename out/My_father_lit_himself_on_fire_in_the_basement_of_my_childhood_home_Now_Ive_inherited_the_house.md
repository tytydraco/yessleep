*Of course*.

If my father were going to leave me the house, of course, he’d leave his stain on it. In this situation, the stain was literal, ash black cement in the centre of the basement marking where he took his last gurgling breath. The sickly-sweet smell of him lingered. The single air freshener I had packed wouldn’t do, and I’d have to go into town eventually, no matter how much I dreaded it.  

The basement had been the first place I checked. I ended a call with my older brother, one of my many relatives who thought they were more deserving of the house, as I made my way down the plank wood stairs.

Now looking at the burnt smear in the centre of the room, too deeply marked for even the local cleaner to scrub away, I imagined I was the only one of my family who could stomach it.

I would have to find a rug to cover it up, and I hoped that there was a spare somewhere in the house. If not, it’d be an hour driving into the nearest non-hick town to try and find one, and I’d done enough driving for today.

*This part of my father would have to stay in the house*. *For now*.

The rest of the house lifted my spirits. The familiar birdsong greeted me as I crested the stairs. Some of the only fond memories of my childhood were accompanied by those noises.

Dark mahogany floorboards and bookshelf walls in every room. What was contained in the books I couldn’t tell, recognizing some more recent purchases, but with the majority being in other languages, I did not know. The smell of old books and their leather-bound covers was enough for me.

The fireplace sat squat on the wall opposingly.  So close to the musty kindling surrounding it. I probably wouldn’t be lighting any fires for a bit anyways. It would seem in poor taste, no matter how I felt.

The family home seemed right out of a movie set in the Victorian Age. From outside, the crimson panelling and gray rooftop meant the building looked best when under a gloom. The large, rounded turret at the corner of the manor, stretching a story higher into the sky and tipped with a pointed spike, only accentuated this feeling.

And despite all that, and even though I had not seen it in seventeen years, I felt more comfortable than I had ever been in it before. With only myself.

My phone rang again, ripping me out of my moment of peace.

“Hey sis—“

“What the actual fuck Thomas,” Emma snapped, cutting me off.

Honestly, that was better than the insults or threats I had been receiving from the others.

“I know none of us were close, but I at least sent cards. You never reached out, not once.”

“I don’t think birthday cards qualify you for real estate, Emma,” I said, sharper than I meant it to be.

“Thomas.”

To be fair, I didn’t have an answer for her.

“I honestly don’t know Emma,” I sighed, pacing through the house. “Maybe, it was one last middle finger to us. Maybe he grew a heart. Or maybe he just picked me right before lighting himself on fire. Whichever it is, I don’t know.”

“So, what’re you going to do with the place?” she asked. “If you’re planning on giving it up, at least give me first dibs.”

“Will do, sis.” I had made my way to the kitchen window that looked into the backyard. “I have some stuff I have to figure out first.”

I looked out the window. The fresh patch of dirt at the far end of the yard had my attention, and I flashed it the finger.

*Why me?*

*\*\*\**

Unpacking came next. I hadn’t brought too much, just the essentials, but even that took me the rest of the afternoon. My speaker comforted me, with the screaming and strumming of the bass guitar keeping me company. Still, it had taken me well into dusk to get it in a state that I could fall asleep with.

Turning down the music to prepare myself for bed, I heard it. Knocking. I didn’t know if I just hadn’t heard it before or if it had begun as I lowered the volume, but there was someone knocking on the front door. I checked the clock quickly: 8:47 pm.

It was gentle, polite despite the hour. After two minutes of its persistence, I realized whoever was out there wasn’t going to be leaving on their own. They had heard the music. They knew I was home. Maybe they were coming to give a noise complaint.

Whatever. It would take five minutes to sort out. Teary-eyed grief or a smile and a chuckle of misunderstanding would keep it short. I strode towards the door, preparing, and realized the lack of a peephole. In fact, there weren’t any windows around the door. The thick lacquered door obscured everything about who was on the other side. I would have to open it to check.

Crocodile tears on the edge of my eyes, I opened the door.

“Oh,” was all that she said at first. She hadn’t expected me to answer. Maybe not like that. Her wrinkled hand was still awkwardly raised at the door, holding something made from sticks. The other held a Tupperware container with what looked like lasagna inside.  

There were two of them,

The woman, dressed in a knit sweater, was stood right at the door. So close that I almost bumped into her.

The man, whom I assumed was her husband, was further back. Staying off the porch, down the steps, looking off at something further down the dark road.

“How can I help you?” I asked, wiping my eyes.

“Sorry to intrude,” she started. Her tone was gentle; I imagined in hopes of comforting me. “I’m Linda, and this is my husband, Paul,” gesturing at the man further down the stairs.

I realized this would take a bit longer. “Is there anything I can do for you?” I asked. “Was the music too loud? I’m done for the night anyway.”

“Nothing of the sort. We just wanted to do our neighbourly duty and introduce ourselves.”

“Well, it’s appreciated, thank you,” I said. Food was another thing that I would have to go into town for. I waited for Linda to hand over the lasagna, but she didn’t.

“You don’t look like how I expected. Nothing like your father.”

The dyed black hair and piercings helped that.

Her husband, Paul, finally spoke. “Be respectful, Linda. He’s his father's son, no matter how he looks.” His eyes were still focused elsewhere.

“No offence taken,” I said with a smile. If anything, what Paul said was worse.

“Apologies, Thomas. Paul’s right, you’re to be respected. In any case, here you go,” she said, handing over the lasagna and the strange bundle of sticks. “Do with it what should be done.”

After a few more long minutes of pleasantries, Linda turned, and the two of them made their way back down the rural road in the direction of what I assumed was their home.

Inspecting the sticks, I saw that it was intertwined with vines. Hair woven in. A bird, maybe? I had no idea what was to be done with the thing. I also realized I didn’t remember ever introducing myself to Linda.

\*\*\*

The couch wasn’t comfortable, but it had been the only option. Anything that could generously be considered my room was repurposed, and my father’s master bedroom was out of the question. So, the couch it had been.

I made myself a coffee and started to plan the day. Town was inevitable. There was a handful of things I would need if I had any intention of staying here, and I had just eaten through the last of my meager rations. The inevitability of speaking with a local was also very real and if Linda, Paul, and my faint memories were anything to go on I wasn’t enthused.

The question of how long I could survive if I never left the house flittered to my mind. If the water worked, surely, I could get past the first few days. Food would be another issue, but I’d been resourceful in the past. Other than that, what else? Shelter was easy. Warmth was easy. Social Interaction?

It was stupid. The deeper question was how long until I’d have to interact with people like my father. *In a perfect world, never*, I thought. Still, I grabbed my car keys and locked the door behind me. It was a nice thought.

Calling it a town was generous. The most interesting building was a crafts store, its exterior adorned with birdhouses and other handcrafted knick-knacks. Other than that, the place sucked. There was no church, no cemetery, no history. Thankfully, there was a liquor store because, of course, there was.

The gas station doubled as a general store simply called Clark’s. It supplied the residents with the necessities, and now that I technically fall under that description, it would do the same for me.

The middle-aged cashier, whom I assumed was The Clark, lit up seeing me.

“Thomas! An honour”

*Was this going to be a thing?*

“Nice to meet you too,” I said, walking through the store. Trying to pick out what I needed, Clark took my silence as an invitation to speak.

“I think it’s a damn good thing. You coming here.  Not the store I mean, the town,” he said, laughing. I meanwhile focused on the fact that the candles were tucked at the back of the shelf, having not been restocked.

“Your father was a great man. Big shoes to fill, I reckon. It’s a tragedy what happened to him, but that’s the life of people in his position. Always a tragedy.”

Now that was funny. However, I realized, listening to Clark speak, I didn’t know exactly what my father did. From what I remembered, our family had been entrenched in the community. In what way, I didn’t actually know.

I decided that Clark might be the perfect person to ask.

“So, what exactly did my father do for a living?”

For the first time since meeting me, Clark went silent.

“What do you mean?”

“Aside from the obvious,” I said, chuckling. “I hadn’t seen him in a while and wanted to know how he spent his last days.”

“Oh,” Clark said, seemingly appeased. “Well, your father was taken care of by the community, rest assured. By our Lord as well. He kept up.”

Realizing something, Clark quickly fished around under the counter and fetched a small wooden object.

“Could I give this to you now?” he said, handing me the carving.

Looking it over in my hand, it was another bird. It had been whittled out of wood, stained dark with something that flaked off in brown pieces. Long stringy hair, I hoped from an animal, had been attached to the head.

“Save me the trouble of going to yours,” Clark said.

I looked him in the eyes. It didn’t seem I had a choice.

“Thanks, and don’t worry about paying. On the house.”

Halfway down the road, I opened the car window and threw it. Whatever my father had been up to, I wasn’t participating.

I reached the front steps of the house, birdsong filling my ears and the smell of burning filling my nose. I would be searching the house top to bottom and intended on figuring out what was going on, but my foot was blocked.

*That’s where the candles went*, I thought. Small crafts were littered in front of my door, all like the ones Clark and Linda had given me. Dozens of bundles of sticks, vines, hair, and feathers were spread. Some were hanging from the porch roof; most were arranged in circles. Wax candles were melting onto the wood, and bowls of dried bread covered the porch.

“Fuck,” I muttered, brushing past it to the kitchen to fetch a garbage bag. As I entered, I saw something even more concerning. The patch of dirt at the far end of the yard was no longer a patch. It was a hole. A deep, open grave.

Someone had dug him up.
