I was told today would be the end of the world. I had wondered how I would feel when it finally came to it: the destruction of everything we know. I imagined a thousand times how I might react, but somehow I was still wrong.

I feel nothing. No remorse, no hope, no regret. It’s so…mundane, so commonplace. Like when I hit the button for the nuclear warheads. I might as well have hit the on switch on my electric toothbrush.

There was no emotion to be felt. It was over faster than I could comprehend. The thick concrete and lead walls of my bunker prevented any sound transmission. My boss had programmed a little computer gif animation of a mushroom cloud for me to make up for the lack of fanfare. I appreciated him for that. 

I’m not really that high up in the military. My position is necessary but I myself am expendable. I’ve only lasted this long by going unnoticed. Mediocrity is my shield. I exist to make others look good but to do so without being perceived. As someone with autism, I find it particularly delightful. So when this job was discussed, I volunteered immediately, without hesitation. 

The internet has an interesting dichotomy when it comes to neurodivergence. We are either grouped together as completely innocent little babies who cannot make mistakes or as morally superior stalwarts of the honor system. Neither is true. After all, I am a part of the demise of the free world. I pressed the button. 

I could have taken this fact to my grave. But there is a sick delight in knowing I will post this and no one will see it. Knowing that I will remain unperceived except by the bots on the internet, to forever be recorded in human history as the destroyer of the world. 

You might wonder, why? There is so much good in the world? How could you end everyone’s lives? Well, there is also a lot of bad. Evil people hurt many more people than the good can heal. I see it as a reset button.

Plus, the world deserves it. After all, I was denied a chance. Being autistic made it particularly hard to date. Being short made it even harder. When it came to the genetic lottery I struck out. Women didn’t want to talk to me, and refused to give me a chance. Maybe if I’d found someone, I wouldn’t be in this cement hole, ending the free world. Maybe if everyone had been a little nicer, it wouldn’t have come to this. 

This is what they deserve. I smiled. It has been twenty three hours and fifty minutes since I pressed the button. I imagined what she would look like as she realized her life was going to end. Jennifer. I bet she was looking at wedding dresses to marry that douche bag in. I thought about the coffee she threw at me when I offered it to her. I imagined it bursting into flames in her hand and the fire engulfing her entire body.

At least, that is what I learned would happen when a nuclear bomb goes off. I wondered how close she was to the epicenter. Or would she get cancer and slowly die a painful death later? I smiled. 

The military assured me this box would protect me. It was barely large enough to fit my chair, a desk, a monitor/keyboard and a big red button. I assume the computer is inside the wall or something. Above me is a large hatch door with a valve latch. I was instructed that once I pressed the button, after 24 hours the military would send a team to retrieve me.

As the ten minutes started ticking away, I pulled up reddit and started posting. I giggled in excitement at all the bots who would like and comment on my post without ever knowing what it was. 

EDIT:

Five minutes passed and I heard a notification from the secure military email. I opened it.

Dear soldier,

We regret to inform you that the heat from the blast has sealed you into the safety bunker. Please remain calm as we search for other ways to retrieve you.

Sincerely,

General Bob

Ok. No biggie, I thought. Just gotta wait it out.

Twelve hours have passed. No updates so far. I’ve eaten through half of my snacks merely out of boredom. There are 4K likes on this post so far. I’ll keep updating as I go along.

EDIT:

It’s been three days since I pushed the button. I have no more food left. I haven’t heard anything despite sending a dozen emails. I wonder if the military died as well in the blast? Could the email have been by a bot? Or auto triggered if the bunker didn’t open after a specific number of hours?

Luckily there was a ventilation and heating system. I’ve been comfortable and am not at risk of running out of air. The lack of food, water, and bathroom have become an issue. At first I just refilled old water bottles with my urine, but soon I’m going to need to shit and I don’t want to be trapped down here with this.

I stepped away from the monitor. The entire room is five feet in diameter. Just me, a chair, a desk, a monitor, keyboard and cabinet with snacks. And that big red button. I imagine it is starting to talk to me now.

“Why did you do it?” the button asks.

“Do what?”

“Why did you press me?” 

“I had to. I had to end the evil.”

“But you killed so many people.” For a hallucination, this button sure as fuck was judgemental. 

“I didn’t kill them. If it wasn’t me, the military would have used someone else.”

“But you could have chosen not to. You could have stood for something.”

“I did stand for something” I screamed. “I survived.”

“No one is coming to get you.” The button softly whispered. “You need to find a way out.”

“How?” The tears started now but ended quickly. I was too dehydrated. 

“Check the computer”. 

I sat again at the monitor. There was a survey popup replacing the entire screen. I looked but I couldn’t shut it. CTL ALT DELETE  did nothing. The text read like a survey 

Thank you for your participation. Please answer the following questions to the best of your ability.

Please rate your attractiveness on a scale of 1 to 10. 

“Um, clearly I am a 10.” I pressed the submit button.

A new pop up.

Are you sure? In bright yellow letters.

I sighed. I selected 5 and submitted. It progressed to the next question.

Does anyone love you?

Yes or No?

I answered no.

Will anyone miss your absence?  
Yes or No?

No again.

Did you tell anyone about where you currently are?  
Yes or No? 

Why didn’t I tell anyone? I racked my brain. Wait, I sent an email to Jennifer. I told her it was her last chance to be with me.

I clicked yes.

The screen flashed and the next question appeared.

Did you tell anyone OTHER than Jennifer?  
Yes or No?

It was at that moment that I realized something was off. I stood up quickly and looked at the hatch. The only thing between me and my freedom. It was at that moment I realized. It was tack welded shut, from the outside. I could a bit of the weld dripping down.

The button started talking again. I realized, I’m not hallucinating. It’s coming from a speaker system.

“Finish the survey” It demanded

“What happens if I don’t?”

“Only good things happen if you do.”

I sat down. No. I didn’t tell anyone other than Jennifer.

They asked me more questions about my childhood, my emotions, if I hurt animals, how I felt about cartoon characters getting hurt. 

I answered them.  
The pop up went away. I got back to reddit to document.

EDIT:  
It’s been five days since I pressed the button. I wished I never had. I strained my voice screaming for hours until I passed out yesterday. I woke up in my own shit. I can’t stand the smell. No one has responded. Not to email, not to screaming. The button is silent.

If you are reading this please stop commenting. Send help. I don’t know where I am but I know I’m somewhere in rural Texas. Please. I don’t want to die. Please.
