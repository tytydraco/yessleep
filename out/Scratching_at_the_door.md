2:14am glows on the alarm clock as I finally slump into my apartment like a shuffling zombie and drop my keys into a bowl beside my door. Another grueling late shift is finally over. I struggle to take off the lanyard around my neck that holds my ID, before discarding it along with my keys I examine the new but poorly exposed photo of myself next to my details which read “Sophie Gonzalez, Nurse, St. Helens Hospital.”

I consider turning on the lights before my eyes adjust to the sliver of moonlight emerging through the back windows of my studio apartment and decide not to stimulate my brain any more before bed. Piles of mess scatter the lounge and kitchen, a buildup of forgotten time before I go to work and a reminder of the energy I don't have when I get home.

A shiver possesses my body, the apartment is cold from sitting dark all day, so I put off cleaning again for another night and quickly get into my normal routine before bed. I walk the short dark hallway to the bathroom and brush my teeth in the dim light while decompressing and unwinding from the stresses of the hospital. Clean flannel pajamas shield my body from the chill and I let out a relieving sigh when my head hits the pillow.

It doesn't take long for a dream-like state to wash over me and I’m not sure what's real or not when a scratching noise awakens me. I lay still staring at the ceiling, quietly trying to discern if the sound moves around, which would probably mean rats or some other type of vermin that occasionally enters the walls, But it doesn't. 

The sound is consistent, static in position and it takes me a moment to realize it’s coming from outside my bedroom. I get out of bed, still exhausted, leaning out of the bedroom door frame and peer down the now even colder hallway. There's no movement or sight of anything dangerous so I slowly creep into the lounge when the hairs on the back of my neck stand at attention and I turn stiff with fear.

The source of the scratching is from the other side of my front door…

It takes what feels like a lifetime to break the spell of fear that had taken over me, I catch my breath and regain control of my body. No movement in the door handle gives me some morsel of relief but I’m still on edge as I approach. Bracing the door with my trembling hands as I lift my eye to the peephole.

Fear switches to confusion when I see nothing but a dark, empty corridor. The lights in the public areas are automatic, so they should be on if someone is out there. I watch for a while and it's only when I realise I’ve been holding my breath in anticipation that I also notice the scratching noise has ceased.

*“Was there something out there?”* I wonder.

*“Or am I just hearing things in my delirious state?”*

Scurrying back to bed like I’ve watched a terrifying horror movie late at night, I pull the sheets up high to my chin which makes me feel warm and safe. I chuckle and shake the silly thoughts from my mind as I close my eyes and try to return to a slumber.

Only a few moments go by when I hear the noise again, the sound of persistent scratching at the front door, like fingernails deeply carving into the wood, trying to get in. This time I rushed out of bed, making it to the lounge in time to see light peering through the bottom of the door frame. Someone is out there…

Despite getting here with such confidence and haste I’m still cautious and too afraid not to just swing the door open at this time of the night. I check the peephole again, the automatic lights now illuminate the corridor but no one is standing there on the other side looking back. Slowly unlocking the deadbolt, the door creaks open and I suddenly hear a loud noise which makes me jump out of my skin.

My eyes adjust to the influx of light, I can see some neighbours from a few apartments down have stumbled home drunk and are struggling to put their key in their door. They notice me and apologise in a half laughed and slurred speech while picking up the bundle of keys they had just dropped on the ground, frightening me. 

Aligning the little silver key into the lock with their current inebriated motor skills seems impossible and they are scratching all over their front door.

I take a look at my door and notice that all the wood around the handle and lock have deep gouges in it, the once nice olive green paint has been completely scratched off with the light timber underneath revealed. Anger boils up in me, I turn to start yelling at the drunken neighbours who obviously tried to open the wrong door but they had already managed to finally unlock and escape into their apartment. I consider storming over there and explaining that they ruined my property and It will have to be repaired but I realize that arguing with drunk people in the middle of the night is futile. I swallow my anger and let out a deep sigh.

Heading back inside and locking the front door I’m still in a foul mood as I stomp my feet down the hallway to bed, falling asleep is going to be difficult while imagining the heated conversation I’m going to endure tomorrow. Even the bed sheets don't feel as comfortable anymore.

I don’t remember falling asleep but I’m awoken by a noise all too familiar to me now.

The scratching reverberated through my house like an relentless alarm clock forbidding me to rest.

I stomp down the hallway like a rampaging thundercloud ready to strike at the idiotic neighbors who have kept me up all night. I check the peephole just to be sure it's them but I can't see anything. Not like before when the lights were out but a darkness deeper than when you close your eyes. It's like something is covering it from the other side. The scratching continues and my anger quickly diminishes back to fear and anxious thoughts flood my tired mind.

*“Is it just the neighbours at the wrong door again?”“But why would they be covering the peephole?”*

I grab the keys from the bowl beside my door and put a key in between each finger as a makeshift weapon and build up the courage to open the door. I quickly flick the deadbolt and swing the door open and I'm left stunned…

The outside lights activated brightly to my presence but the corridor was mysteriously empty, devoid of any sounds or sight of any other people. How was that even possible? I opened the door as the scratching was happening. Surely they couldn't have gotten away that quickly?

I step out into the corridor and silently wait, frozen in time like a statue using all of my remaining sleepless energy to heighten my senses to hopefully gain some new information about this scratching sound that has been taunting me all night.

Without movement, the corridor lights switch off and I’m left standing in the dark. Almost instantly I hear the door behind me slam shut sending my whole body into a fearful spasm. The sound of this quick occurrence echoes down the corridor like a replay in time and my heart is pounding out of my chest.

I lunge for my door so fast that the reactivated lights barely have time to touch me before I yank the door handle and charge inside. I slam the door shut this time and try to lock the deadbolt in such a rush I fumble and take longer than I would have if I was calm. Behind the protection of my door I lean against it and take deep breaths to reduce my heart to a sustainable rhythm.

*“What was that? A draft in the corridor maybe?”* I wonder.

I don’t remember feeling anything like that while standing out there. Whatever it was, it scared the absolute hell out of me. Walking down my apartment hallway for what felt like the 10th time tonight I made my way back to bed. Despite all the fear and confusion of the night, the bed still feels like a safe place where I could hide from everything going on. My eyes close and I start to feel weightless as I relax into the soft sheets. 

And then I hear it again…

After everything that's happened tonight my emotions are numb, I almost ignore the scratching sound when I realize it's not coming from down the hallway now, it's coming from my bedroom door.

A black void appears and widens as the bedroom door creeps open and I lay there watching, paralysed in fear.

I see it now, the thing that's been hiding behind the doors all night taunting me.

No, not taunting me… haunting me.

Barely visible by the moonlight I can see its freakishly wide and jagged mouth, Olive green wood chips protruding from gums that are only visible because of the highlights of glistening saliva connecting its crooked and serrated teeth.

Now I understand, this thing that had been trying to get in all night, trying to chew through the door to get to me, and when I went out into the corridor and let the lights go out.   
  
I let it in…
