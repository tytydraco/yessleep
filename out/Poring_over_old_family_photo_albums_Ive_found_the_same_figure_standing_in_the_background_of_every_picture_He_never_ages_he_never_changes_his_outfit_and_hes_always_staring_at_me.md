After my dad’s funeral, my sister and I went back home to pore over old family photo albums and reminisce. It’d been years since we hauled them out of storage. Their pages were yellowed, their covers coated thickly with dust. This was due in part to the divorce, not wanting to parade memories around our mother, who held fast to her resentment for many years.

She’d softened since his diagnosis, though, expressing her well wishes in the beginning, her sympathies toward the end. When we came back to the house from the cemetery, she fetched the albums from the basement for us, laid them out on the coffee table in the living room. Even hovered at the archway for a few minutes as we began our stroll down memory lane.

Before long, she receded down the hallway, however, leaving her children to their mourning. “Hey, look at this, Jay,” said my sister, pointing at a particularly old photo. It featured all four of us, shortly after we’d moved in, posing in front of the living room window. “I forgot about that nasty green carpet.” She rubbed her feet along the tan replacement. “Everything looks completely different now, huh?”

“Who’s this lookie-loo?” I asked, pointing at a darkly dressed man rubbernecking from the street. He wore jeans and a green bomber jacket, plastic-frame sunglasses and his dark hair short. With his fists stuffed into the pockets of his jacket, he stood alongside the mailbox, peering into the house.

Vicky laughed. “Oh, *weird!* I never noticed that before.” She leaned in for closer inspection. “I don’t recognize him, does he look like one of our neighbors from back then?”

“None I recall.”

A curious find that might otherwise have been shortly forgotten — if not for the fact we seemed to spot him lurking in the background again just a few pages later.

“Hold up,” said Vicky, index fingering the man once more. This time, he stood a few yards behind my father and I posing alongside the shark exhibit at the aquarium downtown. “Is that the same dude?”

We flipped back and forth to compare. Same jacket, same shades, shame ‘do. It even looked like the same pair of lightwash jeans. “That’s crazy,” I said, ignoring the gooseflesh creeping up my forearms.

By his third appearance, we became fixated on his mystery. He showed up in vacation photos from places as farflung as Greece and England, in backyard barbecues, pictures from my college graduation. Always the same outfit, same blank expression, watching us from the background. He never aged, despite the years separating the memories, an unchanging, omnipresent figure.

With a nervous chuckle, Vicky said, “This is kinda freaky, Jay. You think this is, like, some kind of prank?”

“An incredibly elaborate one if that,” I replied. “Who would’ve done something like this?”

We were at a total loss. We discussed sharing our find with Mom, but chose to delay that conversation. Despite the acrimonious divorce, the open wound of their separation that never healed, we sensed her private mourning for her ex. He was the father of her children, the man with whom she’d spent two decades of her life. And perhaps because of the unresolved conflicts between them, she felt his loss especially hard.

Besides, what did we have? A weird coincidence, nothing more. Yet, anyway.

Days later, when I returned to my life in Chicago, I took the photographs with me. I sleuthed to the best of my abilities, conducting reverse images searches, making use of facial recognition software, even reaching out to my father’s old business partners on a lark.

It was this last tack that bore fruit. A retired partner at the consultancy firm where dad worked returned my email, suggesting he might have some materials for me to review. So the following weekend I trekked back to Michigan and paid the old man a visit. He told me about how he and my father attended these conferences together, which I had a vague recollection of from my youth, dad flying off a handful of times each year for business.

After an exchange of friendly pleasantries, he supplied me with a box of old photos, awards, sundry other knickknacks from his lifetime of consultation. I sifted through the collection to find a handful of four by sixes of Dad.

At the sight of him, I felt the warmth of longing and affection, the twinge of absence, soreness like a bruise in my chest. A farrago of emotions quickly routed by disquiet when I came upon the man. Bomber jacket, light wash jeans, dark shades, short-cropped hair. He was sitting at the end of a hotel bar, seven or eight stools down from my father, who was enjoying a cocktail with his coworker.

I set the photo aside, went digging again. Sure enough, the man appeared in no fewer than six images, in the background, looking on like some kind of spy. Except in the final picture. In the last photograph, my father looked about mid-fifties, which would have been about ten years prior. He was on the deck of a boat, out in the middle of the ocean, no land in sight. There were a handful of other middle-aged men aboard, apparently deep-sea fishing, based on their attire and the fishing lines.

Among them stood the man, outfit unchanged, only he wasn’t in the background, but in the fore, shaking my father’s hand.

I brought the man to the attention of the firm’s former partner who merely glanced at each image, flipping between them with indifference. “What am I looking at here?”

“The man,” I said impatiently, “the man in every photo. He’s in the background except—except this one here.” I tapped the picture in which he shook my father’s hand with urgency. “Who is this man?”

His brow furrowed, he gave the image another once over, holding it near to his face, before ultimately giving up. “I don’t know,” he replied. “Doesn’t look familiar.”

“You don’t remember this meeting?” He shook his head. “Don’t you find it odd he’s in all of these pictures?” But no matter how stridently I hammered the point, he seemed incapable of absorbing it. He offered banal explanations, that the man’s style was not uncommon, that he could be many. Or, perhaps in a bid to offend me and thus drive me from his home, suggested it might’ve been my father’s paramour.

“I don’t know who the guy is,” he said with finality. “To be honest, I don’t much care for the past, which is why I keep it in an untouched box. Never spent much time looking back. Frankly, I don’t spend much time looking forward, either. I’m a man of the present, living his life one day at a time.”

We left things at that. I thanked him for his time and drove back home. In the course of that trip, I heard from my sister, who lived in the next town over. She said she would meet me at home. That she had something to show me.

She arrived at dusk, carrying a disc with her into the living room. Without explanation, she fed the disc into the DVD player and pulled up video of our father’s funeral service. After a bit of fastforwarding, she froze the frame. “There!” she said, stabbing a finger at the screen.

Seated in the pews, nonchalant among the others gathered in the church, was The Man.

And in the seat directly in front of him: me.

Chills. Terror. Cold sweat. “What is going on?” I muttered.

I returned to Chicago without answers. Days passed. Weeks. Minutes slid inexorably into hours, the lot of them conveyed swiftly into the graveyard of the past, and the ghosts they left behind contained echoes of a single visage, stonyfaced, middleaged, eyes hidden behind sunglasses. The Man.

One night, after a few drinks with coworkers in Streeterville, I went ambling through twilight, for a moment distracted by the transitional hour. When the beers finally caught up with me, I dashed into an alley to relieve myself. As I washed the backend of a dumpster, a silhouette appeared at the far end of the alley.

I cursed, quickly stuffed myself back into my pants, and when I looked up again, saw him. The Man. Looming over me, maybe six feet tall, maybe sixty. I froze while he raised his left hand to his glasses. He lifted them above his eyes, or what should have been his eyes. Instead, they were only the hollow orbits, shadow pooled in their empty cavities.

“I see you,” he told me. “Do you see me?”

I could only nod in reply.

He smiled. “Good. That’s one time. You’ll see me two more times. And the third time you see me, I’ll give you my eyes.” Here he dipped his fingers into the hollow sockets and laughed, the sound inhuman, fire chewing through kindling.

As he turned to leave the alley, he added, “Have a nice one, kid.”

I’ve yet to see him again. I don’t know his name. I don’t know how he knew my father. I don’t know his intentions, but I fear him now. I’m always looking over my shoulder, looking back to see if I’m being watched by [The Man](https://www.reddit.com/r/JulianVoss/).
