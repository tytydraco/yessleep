There was this hole in this tree out in the woods behind my trailer and it disappeared. I know it's the right tree because it wasn't that far back from my yard and I'd go here a few times a day. I'm really worried and I don't understand how the hole disappeared. It's like it was never there and it's driving me crazy!I live alone and I don't really have anyone to talk to. I talk to myself and sometimes I'll pretend there are other people or things in my house that I'll talk to. Sometimes it gets a little out of hand and I'll stop.I was dog sitting for my brother and it was great! I had someone here and we'd talk and have a lot of fun together. But after he left, the loneliness was just too heavy and I decided to leave my trailer. I was walking around in the woods when I found this tree. It had this hole in it and I started talking to the hole. Now I'm not saying the hole was responding to me I was just pretending that it did but I felt better. I stayed out there for maybe an hour just talking and laughing with the hole in the tree and it was a lot of fun; it reminded me of hanging out with old friends.So I started going back every day to talk to the hole. I normally don't let myself carry on for that long talking to something that isn't real but the hole in the tree could surprise me, somehow. It would make me laugh, ask me questions no one else thought to, and I feel like maybe it enjoyed speaking with me too. But now the hole is gone and I'm freaking out.I won't talk to anyone or anything else in my trailer anymore. I want to find out where the hole went or why it would leave. If I knew what happened, I feel like I could move on but until then it's all I think about. I've been lonely for a long time but this is different; it actually hurts. I just want to talk to the hole one more time and maybe say goodbye or something.I've had dreams that it's back and we're talking but I always forget (in the dream) that it's not there in real life so I don't ask where it went or why it left. I always forget to say goodbye. I've checked other trees and there are some holes but they're not the same. I can tell. They don't reply in the same way. They're not real.Does anyone know what could've happened? Tree's can't just close up like that can they? I saw online that you can 'repair' a hole but it looks fairly obvious that a repair has been done. That's not it. If it is it and I find the person who did it I might hurt them.I don't know what to do. Any ideas?
