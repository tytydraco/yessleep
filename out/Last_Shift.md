I clocked in at 9:58 p.m. sharp, rain coming down in silver sheets over the glass doors. The lobby was warm and too bright, smelling like carpet cleaner and the sour edge of old coffee. Linda was already shrugging into her coat, telling me goodnight with that look she always had—the one that says better you than me, Eddie.

Just me, her, and Frank the security guard now. Frank never leaves the front desk—eyes half on the monitors, half on whatever paperback he’s chewing through this week. He glanced up as I rolled my mop bucket past.

“You got the fourteenth tonight?” he asked.

“Sure,” I said. “Hope the ghosts help mop.”

Frank didn’t smile. “Don’t joke about the fourteenth, Eddie. Not here.”

He had that way of saying things like it was part warning, part habit—old stories too old to be true and too close to skip. I waved it off, swiped my badge, and took the elevator up.

The elevator groaned all the way to the twentieth, panel light buzzing like a fly trapped behind glass. First pass: trash cans, quick vacuum, wipe the breakroom counters. I’ve done this fifteen years. Office buildings at night all smell the same—stale coffee, printer toner, the faint sting of window cleaner. You learn the music of empty places: the hiss in the vents, exit signs that hum, the long pause before a relay clicks and a light wakes up.

On eighteen, a desk chair at the far end of the hall was turning when I came in. No open windows, no vents strong enough for that. Just a slow swivel, like a clock hand. I caught it and set it straight. It didn’t feel like anything, not yet.

Seventeen: the breakroom TV snapped on while I was wiping the counter. No channel, just a snow of dead stations. Then it shut itself off. I thumbed my radio. “Power flicker?”

Frank crackled back, bored as ever: “Not that I see. Cameras look fine.”

When I left, the elevator at the hall’s end dinged open on its own. Empty car. Doors staying wide like it was waiting. The panel showed the fourteen button lit.

I didn’t get in.

Back when I started, the older guys told me things about this place. Said the tower went up on top of a warehouse fire back in the ’20s, some bootlegger turf war. Fourteen men trapped inside. “Fourteenth floor for fourteen souls,” an old guy told me, then laughed, then checked behind him anyway.

The lobby’s got a plaque about post-war steel and modern design. It leaves out the strike in ’49 when four men fell on this floor and died quick. Leaves out the secretary in ’61 who jumped after-hours. Leaves out the guy in ’77 who swore someone kept calling his name from the stairwell until he… didn’t come back to work.

No one likes the fourteenth. No one says why. They just don’t.

On twelve, Frank keyed the radio. “You been up here yet?”

“Not yet. Why?”

“Thought I saw someone by the copy room.”

The hallway was the same as always—gray carpet, framed prints of blue skies nobody ever looks at. The copy room door stood half-open, light buzzing. Nobody inside. Just the smell of fresh coffee, too strong to be imagination. The pot was cold and empty. I checked the drawer for filters. Full. I touched the burner. Cold.

Ten floors down, the conference room screen was unrolled like it had been waiting. Across the white surface, in thick black marker: HELLO.

The capless marker sat in the trash with a ring of ink blooming around its tip. I put the cap back on. It felt like tidying up after a kid. I left fast.

“Frank?” I said on the radio.

Static.

“Lobby, you there?”

Nothing but the faint hum of a channel that refuses to admit it’s dead. The phones on the walls didn’t have dial tones either. The elevator at the far end lit up again: fourteen and three, both buttons glowing red. The doors slid open. Waiting.

I took the stairs.

The fourteenth was wrong from the second the door pushed in. The lights here always feel half a watt dimmer, but tonight they looked like they were trying to dim themselves. The air was warm and heavy, smelling of bleach and something underneath it—hot metal, maybe, or old smoke risen out of old paint.

Wet footprints led down the main hall. Bare. Heel, arch, toes. Water beading in the tread, not yet soaked in. They came from the elevator, arced past three cubicles and a copier, and stopped at the supply closet.

I followed. It’s my job. You follow mess to where it lives.

The closet was empty. Mop sink dripping slow into a half-full bucket. The water gray as dishwater. My cart was with me. I touched the bucket. The plastic trembled to the drip. It looked like it had been filled a long time ago and then only ever moved by the building breathing.

The footprints ended at the drain.

I wiped the rim with the corner of my rag for no reason at all. Habit. Someone else’s bucket shouldn’t be here, but here it was.

Down the hall, the elevator chimed again. Farther away, a relay clicked. The exit sign over the fire door flickered and steadied. I stood very still and listened. The building has a voice if you let it talk. Tonight it was saying something in a language made of air and humming and the sound of water finding ways to be where it didn’t belong.

I cut down to three. The fire doors there were propped open with a chair, though I’d checked the bar earlier. The clocks on this floor all pointed to 3:03—wall clocks, someone’s desk clock, a battery thing shaped like a cat. My watch said 12:31. The second hand on the cat’s tail wasn’t moving at all.

There’s a little breakroom on three where HR does birthday sheet cakes and awkward clapping. They’ve got a tiny security monitor in the corner—grainy black-and-white feed, one camera per floor, cycling fast enough to make you sick if you stare too long.

Every floor was empty. Even the ones with the cleaning lights still on. Empty chairs, empty doors, empty halls. Then fourteen came up: someone standing in the center of the corridor, between the two beige planters and the abstract painting of a blue wave. Too dark to see the face. Too steady to be a trick of the lens.

The screen flipped to fifteen. Empty. Sixteen. Empty. Back to fourteen. The figure had turned toward the camera, head tilted like it was listening through the walls.

The radio on my hip hissed. Not Frank’s bored baritone. Not anything I recognized. Low. Wet. It said my name.

I didn’t answer. I turned the radio off and put it on the counter like it might contaminate anything I kept touching.

I went to the lobby. The mop bucket rattled behind me on the stairs like it didn’t want to come either. You learn to feel when a place is watching you. I felt watched.

The lobby was empty. Frank’s chair at the desk was slowly spinning. His paperback lay on the floor as if he’d let go of it and someone else had put it down, not dropped it. The monitors above the desk showed every camera at once, a grid of ghostly halls. Fourteen was empty now. Three showed the lobby. Me, standing at the desk, in black and white.

And something behind me.

I turned. Just the glass doors and the rain and the dark. No shape. No breath. But on the monitor the thing took a step closer to the me on the screen.

“Frank?” I said. “Where are you?”

The monitor grid flipped without my touching anything. Fourteen. The figure again, closer to the camera now. It had the suggestion of a face the way a burn mark on a beam looks like a face if you stare too long. It looked like it had been waiting a long time to be seen.

My radio hissed back to life without being on. A voice I knew this time, whispering like he’d cupped his hand around his mouth in a closet somewhere. Frank. “Eddie,” he said. “Eddie, don’t take the elevator.”

“How do I—where are you?”

The grid flipped to the stairwell between thirteen and fourteen. The camera angle is bad there, high and pointing into the gloom. Someone was standing with their back to the door. The outline looked like Frank’s—wide shoulders, the slouch of a man who’s sat too long. He didn’t move.

“Frank,” I said, into an empty room. “Walk down.”

“Can’t,” the radio said. “It’s… crowded.”

The monitors ticked through floors. Three-oh-three on every clock I could see. Fourteen came up again. The figure was gone. The camera shook a little. Static. The feed flashed to white for a hiss of a second—like the old TV upstairs—then came back.

A wet footprint appeared on the lobby tile behind me. Not the monitor. Real tile. I watched the water bead in the tread.

Then another. Closer.

I faced the doors. The glass fogged at my breath. Behind me, another footprint. The air smelled like bleach and something underneath it—smoke baked into paint too many coats down to scrub. The kind of smell that never leaves a building, not really. It just gets taught to keep quiet.

The elevator dinged. Fourteen lit on the panel. The doors slid open and waited. The lobby lights dipped and came up again and made every shadow look like somebody’s idea of a person.

“Eddie,” the radio said, close and far at the same time. “You’re not alone on cleanup tonight.”

I took a step. The footprint on the tile matched it, a half-beat off, like it was learning my rhythm. Another step, and the damp print pressed next to my heel. You can feel eyes on your neck even if they belong to something without a face.

I didn’t want to die in a lobby. Not under a security camera and a framed print of a sailboat. I picked up my radio. I picked up my keys. I left the bucket where it was. I walked past the spinning chair and the paperback and the monitors that didn’t bother pretending anymore. The elevator waited like a mouth.

My hand went to the seam of the doors. Cold. I looked up once, at the plaque with its neat little paragraph about post-war steel and modern design. It shined. It left out everything.

The doors started to close on their own. I put my hand in and they opened again, polite. The red light on fourteen glowed steady and patient.

There’s a superstition cleaners have, one we don’t say out loud because it makes you look like a fool. Don’t follow wet footprints if you can’t see who’s making them. Don’t answer a door held open by no one. Don’t believe a clock that says three-oh-three unless it belongs to your own wrist.

I stepped inside anyway.

The doors slid shut without a sound. The panel did not ask me what floor I wanted. It already knew. The car lurched in a way I’ve never felt in all my years. Not up. Not down. Somewhere that felt like inside the building’s memory.

As the numbers blinked over the door for no one at all, the radio breathed once, then went quiet. The last thing I saw before the doors met was my reflection in the glass—my face and, a step behind, something that looked a little like me if you let the smoke erase the parts that make a person recommend themselves to other people.

If anyone finds this on the desk in the morning, wipe the prints up. Tell Linda I was on time. Tell Frank I listened. And if you’re reading this before your shift and the panel is already lit for fourteen, take the stairs and go home sick. Some floors don’t want to be clean.

And if the clocks say 3:03, you’re already late.
