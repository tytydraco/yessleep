For context, I work as an archivist in the University of Trier. Overall, it's usually a pretty dull job. Going through documents written by countless people who's faces and lives have been crushed under the constantly turning cogwheels of history. I joke about it with colleagues sometimes, but in truth, the thought of it saddens me a bit. All these people with lives and experiences as complex as anyone here today, reduced to nothing but letters on a page.

About a week ago, i was approached by the owners of the "Karl-Marx-Haus" Museum. It's the house that Marx was born and lived in with his family until they moved into a smaller house when Marx was only around 1 years old.  They claimed to have found never before seen manuscripts written by Marx, apparently written between the 17th of January and the 9th of March, 1883. As i read the email in which they informed me of their discovery, i was beyond perplexed, considering that Marx was incredibly unwell at the time, having died on the 14th of March, 1883, a mere 5 days after the last supposed writing, and the fact that Marx was living in and died in London, and there is no record nor any real possibility that, given his health and financial situation, he could have somehow returned to the house he spent the first year of his life in mere days before his passing. The whole thing felt deeply wrong, like it should be impossible, but i just had to know what was going on.

As i made my way to the house-turned-museum, my mind was churning with thoughts and any possible explanations for the whole ordeal. \*Could it just be a very well-made forgery? An elaborate joke?\* Try as i might to convince myself that there had to be some sort of logical explanation, nothing added up.

Finally, i arrived at the museum. The house looked like every other old house in the area, all packed together like Sardines. The only thing distinguishing it from every other house was the sign outside about the museum itself and a plaque of Marx's head, looking sideways towards the old, darkened, pinewood double doors that served as the entrance ominously watching over the centuries-old street.

I was greeted at the doors by two men who worked at the museum, both looked stern but at the same time, i could tell that they were just as perplexed and somewhat disturbed as i was. They introduced themselves as William and Henry respectively.

"We trust that you know why you're here, correct?" Henry asked, trying to keep up his professional facade, but it wasn't working. I could see it in his eyes, they were unsteady, looking side to side slightly as i saw a droplet of sweat trickle down his forehead, which he swiftly wiped away with a paper towel he had stuffed in one of his pockets.

"Yes, i'm aware" I replied, stuttering somewhat. I swallowed as i felt a lump of anxiety form in my throat. The situation felt so surreal, everyone thought that the last of Marx's works had been found following the publishing of the 1844 manuscripts by the Soviets in the 30s. It made no logical sense that these new manuscripts that the museum had supposedly discovered, written when Marx was essentially on Death's doorstep, had only been found now, and in the house that Marx had only lived in for the first year of his life, and had no means of or any record of visiting since.

With no more words, the two men led me inside. The entrance area of the museum was decorated with pictures, art and quotes from Marx, contrasted by the old Victorian architecture and furniture present throughout the house. The two men led me past the visitor areas and into an area at the back of the house. It was clear that the parts visitors weren't authorized to enter were not as pristine and up-kept as the rest of the house. The walls progressively grew more and more derelict and neglected looking as we strayed further from visitor areas. The soft red carpet transitioned to rotting floorboards that felt as though they might snap if one applied even the slightest extra pressure, their creaks and occasional snaps echoing, like bones being slowly and agonizingly bent and crunched, through the increasingly dilapidated looking halls, termites dancing between the decaying furniture and decor scattered through the area.

The unease i felt in the deepest regions of my soul whilst traversing this neglected area of the house was only heightened as we reached our destination. A large opening at the bottom of one of the deteriorating walls that looked as if it had been hastily dug out, just large enough for the average person to crawl through.

"You do the honors," William said as he swiveled his head towards me, this being the first words either of them had spoken to me since greeting me at the door.

Begrudgingly, i got down on my hands and knees, the rotting floorboards feeling like a bed of tiny nails beneath my unsteady hands as swarms of termites maneuvered between my fingers. I'll admit, i threw up a little in my mouth, but alas, i had to know what lay beyond. And so i began crawling through the crude opening, my hands and knees under constant assault as the decaying floorboards filled them with splinters. The termites continued to dance beneath me as i endured the wooden shrapnel that was waging all-out-war on my hands and knees.

Though it was at most 10 seconds, it felt like an eternity, my only company the schools of termites, engorged on the rotting wood that consumed this unseen area of the house. As i emerged and heard William and Henry follow suit behind me, i broke into an immediate coughing fit as the dust that had lay dormant here for god-knows-how-long filled my lungs. As my lungs finished evicting the dust from their caverns, i took in my surroundings. Similarly to the rest of the restricted areas of the house, the room was falling apart as the walls and floors had spent more than a century alone and decaying, and droplets of water with a disconcerting green hue periodically feel from the ceiling, startling me as they hit the floor, their faint splashes amplified by the otherwise almost complete silence hanging over the room. The thick, musky scent of mold and the damp air created a dense, palpable atmosphere of neglect and abandonment, as if the room itself had been forgotten by history and frozen in time until this moment.

As i haphazardly plucked the splinters from my hands, wincing from the dull pain now permeating my palms and fingers, William and Henry emerged from the opening and began to provide some backstory for me.

William began, "The museum's overseers had been considering expanding the visitor area for quite some time in order to breathe new life into the place, but the majority of the staff, myself included, saw no point. I mean, just look at this part of the house, it would be way too much time and money. And anyway, you couldn't pay anyone to put up with \*this\*" He gestured around the room, not that he needed to, you couldn't have paid me a million dollars to hang out with the termites all day.

He continued, "While they were doing some closer inspection of the more, uhm, \*neglected\* areas of the house, they found the opening, behind a rotting cabinet."

Again, i was totally dumbfounded and at this point somewhat creeped out by the whole thing. There's no possible way or any evidence that Marx ever did or even could have traveled back here, and even if he did somehow, the question becomes \*why?\*, why would he spend time while in such a poor state of health to write entirely new manuscripts and then travel all the way back to his childhood home which he hadn't been in since he was a baby, just to put these final manuscripts somewhere they would never be found for years and years? And where did this room even come from? The discernible entrance was the tiny crudely-dug opening and there seemingly had never been another entrance from any other point in the house?. My mind was spinning, nothing here mad any sense, i began to feel nauseous as i racked my mind for any logical explanation, but was left empty-handed.

William once again continued, "The manuscripts are sitting there on the table, however....", He cleared his throat and wiped his brow before continuing, "Well, we were told to contact you because the manuscripts themselves are not in German, English or any language that any of our staff members can understand. We were told you are experienced in many languages not widely spoken in the modern day."

"Uh, I- uh, Okay?" I replied hesitantly, once again completely at a loss, stumbling over my words.

Thoughts danced rapidly through my mind as i approached the table in the corner of the room. The only other furniture was an old armchair, the fabric unrecognizably contorted by over a century of decay, and a surprisingly in-tact desk, with the cabinets strewn across the floor surrounding it, both stuck in time and forgotten by history. As i grew nearer to the table and the manuscripts, my chest felt tighter and tighter, as if an invisible hand was reaching into my chest and grabbing my heart, slowly strangling it. As i slowly picked up the collection of pages, the paper now a disgusting shade of yellow and blackened around the edges, my hands trembling, my mind racing, i felt as if whatever this was, i was somehow breaking some unspoken, cosmic rule, it felt forbidden.

The writing was incredibly erratic and messy looking as if it had been written with a chicken's foot. The language being used in the writing was constantly shifting between Latin, Ancient Greek, Sanskrit, Biblical Hebrew and Old German. I had studied all of these languages as part of my job, often having to decipher incredibly old texts from various parts of the world, reading in tongues forgotten and crushed in the unfeeling mortar and pestle of the constant movement of human society, but even for me, it was hard to decipher Marx's writing due to the atrocious handwriting. The title of the first page was "Diu Letzistu Forstuand", which i understood as being Old German for "The Final Understanding".

"God has been right here, looming all around us, in every aspect of our existence since the dawn of society. It is omnipotent, all-powerful, and we are merely its puppets. It knows all, it experiences everything that has ever been or will ever be all at once. The deities of all human beliefs, Abrahamic, Dharmic, Sinitic, Pagan or anything in between, are merely attempts by this god to explain itself. Capital is god, and we are it's creator. Capital is self-sustaining, moving, thinking. In creating capital, we have destroyed sapience. It seeks only to grow itself, it is the ultimate power, and we are merely its limbs, by which it uses to eternally grow. We are merely the mouths of a colossus which we will never be able to comprehend. In creating capital, we have unknowingly created an entity more horrific than any beast from the depths of fire and brimstone. And most of all, in creating capital, humanity committed collective suicide, we are merely empty husks possessed by our own creation."

Upon reading the above passage, the first paragraph of the first page among the manuscripts, i felt the air constrict further and further, as if being slowly strangled by an invisible hand. I saw the walls and the floor morph into the most horrific forms, laughing at me, the room spun round and round as i became acutely aware of every cell in my body, moving, interacting, in constant motion, i felt myself shatter into a million pieces as i came to the final understanding. Humanity died long ago, Capital is all that remains.
