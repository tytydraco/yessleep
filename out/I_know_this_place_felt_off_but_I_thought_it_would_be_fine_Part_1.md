He had been living here for undoubtedly a month now. This place is, strange. A suburb made of streets and houses all identical to the next.

Houses pushed together so tightly they could make room for more and more. Because these houses were so narrow they made up for this in height. Each house stood 6 stories tall.

I guess this was just a way to make more housing instead of having apartments. Before moving out my younger brother lived with me and my best friend Hardy in a normal suburb, in a normal house but I think it was time for him to move out when he decided too after finding out about Arcadia Square.

My brother was only a few years younger than me and had finished college 2 years ago, he wanted his own place now.

We both checked out the house together and I will admit it felt a bit weird having all these brand new houses only been built a month ago with no one around except the real estate woman, my brother and me. But these streets were filled with cars. Old cars that looked like they had been here years before this place was even built.

The houses being so tall blocked out almost all the sunlight making the whole suburb dark and faint, like a faded dream. The street lights were also beaming with an unusual blue instead of the ordinary yellow which filled most streets. Each house looked identical to the next, they were made fully out of concrete which gave it a very industrial feel as Arcadia Square was quite far from any stores or for that matter anything else. It stood as a single big block of land with nothing to surround it except stale dirt.

Around the border of this place were cameras which gave a sense of security to this immense area made up of many streets that all looked the exact same to one another, even the doors on all the houses, making it somewhat hard to miss as there were no door handles, a single key hole and no differences except the small carved in number to each door, 77 was the one we were viewing. The houses have slim rectangular windows on each story, weird I thought but I guess with nothing to look at except your own house across the street there isn't much need for a nice view.

The real estate woman, Jannette, was nice to my brother but didn't talk to me much, and wouldn't even look at me unless I spoke first. She had a large smile and I mean large showing every tooth in her unrealistically wide jaw. Felt like a fake smile, like literally looked like she had too many teeth that were all out of place. She had blonde hair that curled at her shoulders, she wore a full white dress that looked to be a 80s nurse dress just without the medical symbols. Jannette took us inside to view the house.

The first floor of this house was the kitchen and dining room. The inside of the house was completely different, it was warm, opposing the cold outside, lit with yellow lighting, dark oak walls surrounded the interior, a modern light that hung from the ceiling in each floor, a marble bench in the kitchen and glass stairs leading to the next floor from each.

The next floor was a lounge floor with a small box tv and a green single person chair facing the tv. Bland looking but nice. The 3rd floor was the bathroom. Small white bath tub at the end of the room with the bathroom and sink leading towards the stairs. Not much room but enough, if you lived alone. Then the next 2 floors were bedrooms in the same layout. Just a single bed next to a tall lamp in each room. The last story was just for storage. It was a nice place. Cozy, comfy and better of all it was cheap.

My brother loved it. He had been wanting his own place for ages now but was holding off for a good deal. He told Jannette he’d take it. He offered to pay by card but she politely declined.

“Cash only here sir, remember” Jannette said with a stiff back

The catch of a good deal. Joel looked at me. I could see him asking with his eyes for my cash. I got my wallet out and gave Joel $100. All that I had in my wallet. 

“Thanks man, I’ll pay you back when I go to the bank next” Said Joel

Joel turned around and handed the cash to Jannette. She took and didn’t even bother counting. She took out the single key with a rectangle keychain made of polished metal that had 77 engraved on it.
