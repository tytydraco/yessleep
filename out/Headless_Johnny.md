Growing up, my family and I would always visit this cabin on a lake during the end of summer around august.  Nearby, there was a town called boulder junction.  It was like one of those quintessential little perfect american small towns but with woods surrounding it on all sides which I think made it look real nice.  I remember my dad and I would always visit there and go to this corner store that sold bait and tackle all the fishing essentials ya know? 

I remember being real excited at about the age of 12 because my dad would always get me some beef jerky and maybe a piece of candy or two.  One time we went there on a perfect sunny Saturday during the summer and I went to look at the fish on the outside of the store you could buy as bait for bigger fish.  My dad went inside the store to buy the paper or whatever and I noticed this man on a chair wearing a blue winter jacket.  Keep in mind it was like a hundred degrees outside so this was definitely a little weird.  I didn’t pay much attention to him and just stared at the fish when he goes hey kid wanna hear a story.  Now keep in mind I wasn’t an idiot and being from the city I knew not to talk to strangers but this was a small peaceful town in the north woods and I loved stories so I didn’t think anything weird would go on.  I say sure and stand about five feet away when he starts.  

So i guess 40 years ago during the winter there were several different disappearances in this small town.  All the people were men in their early 30s.  Long story short, there was this crazy woman who would lure them into her cabin with her good looks and then murder them.  That shit really freaked me out but the worst part is how the police found out.  

So her cabin was on a lake way up far in the trail so definitely somewhere you could murder people and get away with it. A police car got a call about an animal maybe a black bear or something when the guy driving hears a voice in the distance right as he drives by this trail leading into a small lake.  He reverses and starts to go down the trail which was super dark and the only light was the moon and his headlights.  So the guy is driving for what was probably two miles when he sees a small cabin lit up with only one light.  The screaming dies down at this point and now all he hears is this fast talking nonsense maybe english maybe not and it’s super monotonous  doesn’t really have a rhythm to it.  You know how all people that talk use a tone and kinda change pitch and all of that well this voice has none of it.  Obviously the guy is super freaked out so goes to knock on the cabin door and the voice keeps getting louder.  It is just repeating the same thing and nobody answers the door.  He asks if everything is all right when all of the sudden a super loud scream throws him back and he damn near falls over.  He obviously kicks the door down and what he saw was some real fucked up horror movie shit.  

I guess this young lady is in the middle of a candle lit room and on the sides of her are these shelves stocked with like ten heads and she’s just going around screaming at each one about how they didn’t treat her right and how another didn’t get her flowers.  The smell in the cabin was absolutely putrid I mean this lady was probably doing this crazy shit for days.  The bodies of the heads were chopped up and stacked neatly in the corner some of them had to have been there for months.  So understandably the officer flees and calls for back up and they take her in and she ends up getting the electric chair.  Right after he said this I hear the store door open and I quickly run up to my dad and we go in the car.  I look back to where the fish bait area was and the man who told the story was gone. 

Obviously hearing that shit at 12 freaked me out but I didn’t say a word to my dad, didn’t want him to get mad or freaked out or anything like that.  So night comes and I’m still a little shook but quickly forget about it and get distracted with something else.  I’m about to go to bed when I gotta use the bathroom real bad but since the water was out I had to use the outhouse.  

For those who don’t know, an outhouse is basically a bathroom outside away from the cabin and is just a hole in the ground.  Even worse, it started raining.  So i go outside and it’s like pitch black but I had my flashlight and i follow the trail and eventually open the door.  Right when I sit down and I shit you not, all the noise of the rain and the trees and the wind just completely stops.  I could literally hear my heart beating which at this point was super fast.  Not even a bit of wind.  I feel this super uneasy feeling of dread so I hurry up and do my business when i hear this faint noise coming from the hole the toilet leads to.  Now any normal person would quickly get the fuck out of there but I can’t explain why I didn’t.  It was like I was entranced and I even moved my ear closer.  It was like all my senses except hearing shut off.  And the noise too.  It was this monotone rapid way of speaking that sounded human but was extremely unnatural.  I move my head closer to the hole when I hear a knocking sound behind me.  I turn around and on the floor of the outhouse I see a fucking skull with two candles on either side.  This breaks the trance and before I know it i’m sprinting as fast as I can up to the loft to go to sleep.
