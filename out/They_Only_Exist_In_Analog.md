It wasn't how I'd imagined starting my day. Every pothole and rock on the dirt road hit my body as I sat in the back of the police car. I'd been enjoying a leisurely cup of coffee. Now, all I could see was the back of Skeeter's head, wondering how much longer he'd cling to his thinning hair.

"Skeeter, where are you taking me?" I asked curiously as we turned onto a bumpier road lined with trees still shedding their leaves in anticipation of the approaching frost.

"It's Deputy Monroe, Ned," he replied, his voice tinged with annoyance as we crossed a narrow bridge over a creek. "And this is official police business."

"Official police business?" I repeated.

"Yes, Sheriff Winston requested your presence."

"So I'm not being detained?" I asked, as he turned onto a winding driveway with a Coleman mailbox. The neatly cut pastures and the two-story house on the hill came into view.

"Nope, you're not," Skeeter replied.

"Then was it really necessary to put me in the back of the car like a criminal?"

"Yes," he chuckled. I looked out the window to see a patch of nothing but dirt and dry hay laying in the middle of a field, perfectly squared, as if something used to be there. We pulled up to the house, which stood tall overlooking the pastures. It was a red brick structure with a spacious front porch and big windows, all but one of which were closed.

I noticed it because I could see multiple camera lenses pointed in the same direction. Skeeter stopped the squad car and hopped out to unlock the door. As I stepped out, I saw an older man, wearing a white cowboy hat, handlebar mustache, and wrinkled tan skin, standing on the porch.

"Ned, thanks for coming by," Sheriff Winston said.

"It didn't seem like I had much of a choice when Skee—I mean Deputy Monroe picked me up," I replied as I began to walk towards the porch. "So why am I here exactly?"

"Do you know Rusty Coleman by chance?"

"Not personally, but I've seen him around town. Is he under arrest?" I asked as the Sheriff opened the door and led me inside. "And I don’t see what any of this would have to do with me, honestly.” 

"Well, Rusty isn't under arrest. We don't even know where he is," he replied as we walked inside. My nose was filled with an unpleasant smell. We walked into the kitchen, where a pot of what looked like cement with little dark black chunks. It was a pot of sausage gravy, one that had been sitting there for days. “His brother said he missed their card game the other night.” 

"So, you're telling me Rusty is missing?"

He nodded. "Rusty has never missed a poker game. His brother said he's been trying to reach him for days and finally called us for a wellness check."

"I still don't understand why I'm here, Sheriff," I replied as I watched Sheriff Winston head toward the living room and up the stairs, signaling me to follow him. I did, still confused about my involvement. I'm not a police officer and have never been asked to assist with anything like this before.

Sheriff Winston's footsteps were heavy, making the floorboards groan. I followed a few steps behind. "Aren't you a photographer, Ned?" he asked as we entered the upstairs hallway.

"More of a hobbyist," I replied.

"Then that makes you more qualified than anyone I have," he continued, walking toward a room on the left. The door creaked open as he stepped inside. "I want you to see something."

I noticed about six video cameras pointed outside, ranging from newer digital models to ones nearly twenty years old. It was the window I had seen outside, but that wasn't all. On a small, round rug lay a pile of tangled camera film as if it had been pulled directly from a camera in a hurry. Little black pieces of plastic littered the film. I noticed smashed VHS tapes scattered around the room.

"What the hell happened here?"

"Honestly, that's why you're here. I think you might be able to give us an idea of what he was filming and taking pictures of," Sheriff Winston said, pointing to a wall. It was an industrial shelf loaded with all sorts of cameras, both video and still.

My eyes lit up at the sight of the collection. They varied from the cheap ones you find at a local Walmart to more expensive professional-grade models. "I didn't know Rusty was into photography and film," I marveled, walking to the shelf and examining the wide variety.

"I didn't know that either, and I've known Rusty for almost 30 years," Sheriff Winston noted, standing beside me and watching me admire the collection. "I wonder if he's been peeping."

"You think Rusty was into voyeurism?"

"Lord, I hope not, but he seemed a bit strange the last time I saw him."

"How so?"

"He seemed skittish. He didn't even tell me he took down his barn."

"Why did he take down his barn?"

"I didn't know the barn was gone until I pulled in," he replied. "We're forming a search party to check the woods for him."

"So what do you want from me?"

"I want you to go through all these cameras," he answered, eyeing the shelf. "I want to know what he was filming and why he smashed everything up. Maybe he left something on one of them."

"Alright, so I'm an honorary cop now?"

"Heavens no, just a good member of the community helping us non-tech savvy folks out," he chuckled, turning toward the door. I stood there looking at the cameras. "Now I gotta get going. I have a feeling it's going to be a long day and even longer night."

“So I am supposed to just stay here for how long?” 

“I will have Deputy Monroe pick you up in about two hours.” 

– 

I scanned multiple pictures on the various digital cameras. Nothing was inherently creepy—mostly pictures of his pastures and where his barn once stood. The photos seemed low effort and quickly shot, making me wonder why he had such a collection.

There was a pattern, though: many of the photos focused on the barn, where the video cameras in the window were pointed. I turned on the digital cameras first. They seemed to have been erased.

I walked over to an older Panasonic camcorder that used VHS-C tapes. Returning to the shelf, I found a pile of untouched tapes. As I placed a small tape in the camera, I accidentally started recording. "Dammit, it's going to erase it," I said, noticing the small display indicating it was recording.

It filmed the area next to the barn, but cigarette burns started to appear in random areas, followed by brief glimpses of static. I tried to adjust the settings, but noticed someone walking toward the house and then stopping to look up at the window.

An older man with a thick, graying beard and dark hair emerged from the woods, wearing mud-stained dark blue denim and a dark blue flannel shirt. I recognized him instantly.

It was Rusty Coleman.

He wasn't missing; he was on his farm, probably wondering why someone was in his house playing with the cameras in the window. I stopped what I was doing and ran downstairs, opening the front door. I stepped outside onto the porch and looked toward where Rusty should have been, but nothing was there. "Rusty, are you out there?" I yelled, but no one responded.

I went back to the house and called out, "Rusty, did you come in already?" as I quietly walked around his home. "Sheriff Winston is looking for you. Maybe you should give him a call."

Could I be seeing things? I headed back upstairs, being mindful of Rusty, as I went back into the room of cameras. I looked back at the display to see Rusty was still standing there looking directly at me.

"Maybe it isn't recording," I mumbled to myself as I looked outside from the window to see that nothing was out there. But the display acted as if it was recording, perhaps a busted camera. The static noise started to worsen, beginning at Rusty's feet and slowly climbing up his body before he disappeared completely from the display.

The camera had to be busted.

I grabbed another tape and another older film camera, this model was a JVC, one that reminded me of one I had when I was much younger. Back at the window, I pointed it to the exact spot I saw Rusty and hit record. Looking at the display, I could see the spot where the barn used to stand. The cigarette burns returned, a huge one taking up almost a quarter of the screen. To my shock, something strange happened as it slowly faded away.

A structure made of unpainted wood, a large metal roof, and a large opening appeared. It was a barn. As I looked up from the camera from the window, I could see that there was definitely no barn there.

I turned on one of the digital cameras, a DSLR model from Canon, pointing in the same exact location. Everything normal, no barn, no Rusty Coleman, just an empty spot where the barn previously was. I felt as if I was going crazy, but I turned my eyes back to the older camera to see someone else was now standing next to the barn.

He was dressed in a three-piece black suit, wearing a bowler's hat, but where his face should have been was only static noise that would move erratically, shielding any distinguishable features.

I turned off the camera in a panic.

I looked out the window, no man in a bowler hat, no Rusty Coleman, and definitely no barn. I grabbed a Fujifilm instant camera and a Canon DSLR from the shelf and headed outside. I stood a distance away from the barn and pointed the DSLR at the barn, snapping a couple of pictures. Scrolling through the camera, I didn't see anything odd.

The Fujifilm camera reminded me of the one my parents used to take pictures with. A quick snap and a lot of flapping as the picture appeared. I carefully took a picture and heard the sound of the camera pushing it out. I grabbed it like my parents would and flapped it fiercely.

I lifted it up, staring at it as the image slowly started to appear fully. My eyes widened as I could see the barn as if it were there. But that wasn't what concerned me. It was the man in the bowler hat, his face still behind the static noise, his hand in the air as if he were waving at me.

I quickly took another picture, my heart jumping with each flap, hoping that he would be gone. But that didn’t happen, something much worse had transpired as the picture became clear to see that he had moved closer in my direction. 

"Fuck this!" I yelled as I ran back into Rusty's house, locking the door behind me and heading upstairs. The JVC camcorder was still recording. A brief burst of static was followed by the strange figure, as if he had teleported right outside the house. He may not have had eyes, but I felt his gaze piercing through me as I smashed the camcorder onto the floor.

I stood in the room, sweat beading on my forehead, my legs shaking. Strange noises hissed from somewhere, sounding like white noise on an old television. They started to get louder, almost making my head throb in pain.

Something was off in the room. I knew I wasn't alone. As I lifted the instant camera in front of me, I took one last picture. When I looked at it, the man with the static-filled face was standing in front of me, both in the picture and physically.

The hum of the white noise grew louder, and all the analog equipment in the room started beeping, hissing, and crackling as the two of us stood there. I thought I was done for, but in a flash of static, he disappeared.

It's been a day since that happened. Both Sheriff Winston and Deputy Monroe treated me as if I was crazy, but things have only gotten worse. I now see the static noise even without the cameras. He's toying with me. Because soon, it will happen.
