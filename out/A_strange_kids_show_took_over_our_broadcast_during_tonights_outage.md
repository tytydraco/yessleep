The radar wall looked sick.

Red and yellow blotches spread across the map like bruises, swelling outward every time new data came in.

The projected storm path widened again, stretching farther north than it had ten minutes earlier. No one in the room was sitting down anymore. Chairs were pushed back and forgotten. Everyone was standing, leaning, pacing.

“Rotation tightening near our station,” Marissa said into her mic. “If you’re in the warning zone, you need to be sheltered now. Interior rooms. Lowest floor. Storm-shelter. Away from windows—”

Her voice cut out halfway through the word windows.

The sound meters froze.

Three of the big wall screens went black at once.

A sharp beeping started from the equipment racks behind me.

“Substation dropped,” someone yelled from the back.

The overhead lights dimmed, then snapped back on in emergency mode, turning everything pale and flat. You could feel the building change when the power shifted — a different hum, a different pressure in the air. 

Outside, the wind slammed into the station hard enough to make the walls creak.

I was already moving.

I sat down at the broadcast controls and stared at the main status screen.

No connection.

No signal going out.

“Switch to the backup,” the director said behind me.

“I’m trying,” I said, clicking through screens. “It’s not answering.”

“Try the satellite,” Marissa said, pulling her headset halfway off one ear.

I hit the button.

It loaded. Thought about it. Then stopped.

Phones started ringing at the assignment desk.

“The emergency line’s dead. The main phones are still working.” Our producer yelled from the back

That meant parts of the city still had cell service. Enough power to complain. Enough power to panic.

I restarted the main broadcast computer.

“Generator’s holding,” someone from engineering said. “Building power is fine. The tower’s not responding.”

“So we’re talking to ourselves,” the director muttered.

I checked the small TV we used to see what viewers saw at home.

Static.

White noise crawling across the screen.

“No signal,” I said. “We’re off the air.”

For a few seconds, nobody said anything.

Then the director rubbed his face. “Keep trying.”

We kept trying.

Restarting systems. Switching cables. Flipping backup switches. Doing all the things you do when machines stop behaving and you don’t have the luxury of understanding why yet.

The storm kept moving.

The sirens outside went off again.

About twenty minutes later, the producer slowly lifted her head from the phone.

“Okay… this is weird,” she said.

“What?” The director asked while surveying all the main monitors.

“Someone says a cartoon came on instead of the tornado coverage.”

A few people laughed weakly.

“Probably their TV rebooted,” someone said. “Streaming app opened.”

“That’s what I told them,” she said. “Then another person called. Same thing.”

My eye brows furled as the confusion set in.

“What kind of cartoon?” I asked.

“Farm animals. Singing. Bright colors.”

“Which channel?”

She hesitated. “They said it was us.”

That didn’t make sense.

If we weren’t broadcasting anything, there was nothing to interrupt. Nothing to hijack.

Unless something was filling the silence.

I turned back to the recording system and rewound to the moment the signal dropped.

Static.

Crackling noise.

Then the picture snapped into color so fast it made a few people lean forward.

Blue sky.

Red barn sliding into view.

A cartoon pig waving at the camera.

“What the hell is that?” Marissa whispered.

“That’s not ours,” I said immediately. “We’ve never aired anything like that.”

The pig opened its mouth.

“Hi, friends!” it said happily. “Welcome back to Sunny’s Farm!”

Cheerful music started playing. Too cheerful. Too clean. Like a loop that never breathed.

The producer covered the phone. “More calls. All describing the same pig.”

“How many now?” the director asked.

“Eight. All blackout areas.”

“So only people without power are seeing it,” I said, butting in.

I leaned closer to the screen, looking for the kinds of flaws I was used to seeing when something glitched. Distorted colors. Broken frames. Signal tearing.

But it wasn’t glitchy.

It was stable.

Almost… comfortable.

“What channel number are they getting?” I asked.

She asked the caller and lowered the phone slowly.

“They’re saying our channel.”

The room went quiet.

“That’s not possible,” the on-deck engineer said. “We’re not getting anything out.”

“I know,” I said. “Which means this isn’t coming from us.”

“Then where is it coming from?” Marissa asked.

I didn’t answer.

In my head, I ran through the obvious explanations.

Some illegal broadcast.

Some old emergency system malfunction.

Some bizarre technical overlap.

None of them explained why it only appeared when the city went dark.

On the screen, the pig walked toward the barn. The background didn’t move right. The edges of the scene wobbled slightly, like the picture was being held together by something weak.

The barn door creaked open.

Inside was dark. Too dark compared to the bright sky.

The storm sirens outside started up again.

On-screen, the pig turned back to the camera and smiled wider.

“Let’s learn about our animal friends,” it said.

And that was when I understood something important.

We hadn’t lost the broadcast.

We had made space.

And something else had stepped into it.
