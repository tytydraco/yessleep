I used to believe fear was loud. Screaming, running, gunfire. The obvious stuff, I was wrong.

Real fear is quiet, It’s procedural. It shows up in emails with neutral language and checklists, and by the time you realise what you’re afraid of, you’re already doing what it asked.

I worked in civilian logistics on a joint base in the Middle East. Officially, my job was asset recovery, retrieving sensitive equipment after incidents so it didn’t end up photographed, looted, or explained. Unofficially, we were the people who arrived after something went wrong and made sure it couldn’t be talked about clearly ever again.

Most jobs were wreckage. Burned vehicles, collapsed structures, sometimes bodies. You learn to compartmentalise, you learn to treat horror like inventory.

Then we were assigned Site H-19.

No combat report, no incident description. Just coordinates and a timestamp labelled: 
EVENT CONCLUDED.

That should’ve been impossible. Events don’t conclude themselves.

We arrived at dawn. The site was a shallow ravine cut into stone, surrounded by low hills that reflected sound strangely, like the place didn’t agree with echoes. No scorch marks, no debris. Just disturbed ground, long, smooth impressions in the dirt, as if something massive had been pressed into it and then lifted straight up.

No tracks leading in, no tracks leading out.

The air smelled wrong. Not rot, nor smoke. Something metallic and dry, like the inside of an old battery.

We found the equipment first. Rifles stacked neatly, packs lined up, helmets placed beside them, all facing the same direction. It looked organised, respectful. Like someone had taken care with how things were left behind.

There were seven names on the manifest, we found  only six sets of gear. No blood, no signs of struggle. Then one of my team stopped walking, he was staring at the rock wall.

At first I didn’t see it, then my eyes adjusted. There were impressions in the stone. Not carvings, or damage, impressions.

Like bodies had been pressed into the rock while it was soft. Arms too long, torsos stretched thin, heads tilted at angles people don’t hold when they’re alive. The stone had flowed around them and then hardened again, preserving the shapes with uncomfortable precision.

One impression was smaller than the rest. Someone whispered, “They were put there.” No one corrected him, our radios crackled, it was not static, breathing. Slow, deep, patient.

Command came through a moment later, voice carefully calm. “Recovery team, acknowledge.”

No one answered.

“Do not approach the rock face,” command said. “Do not photograph. Do not touch. Proceed with removal.”

“Removal of what?” someone asked.

There was a pause, long enough that my stomach dropped. “Anything that looks like it doesn’t belong.”

That’s when we heard movement, it didn’t come from the ravine. It came from above.

Stone shifted, not collapsing but adjusting, like a person resettling their weight. Shadows bent the wrong way along the ridge line, stretching toward us despite the rising sun.

One of the impressions in the rock… blinked, I swear to you it blinked. The breathing on the radio deepened.

A voice joined it, not through the speaker, but inside my head, formed with the clarity of a thought I didn’t remember thinking.

“You finished leaving yourselves.” It echoed in my head. I dropped my headset.

Around me, people were frozen. One man was crying silently, mouth open, eyes fixed on the rock. Another was repeating the same phrase under his breath, over and over: “It wasn’t supposed to set yet.”

The ground vibrated, not shaking, just humming, like tension running through a cable. The smallest impression in the stone moved. It didn’t come free, it didn’t step out. It looked at us.

I don’t know how I knew, it had no eyes. But the attention was unmistakable, heavy as a hand on my chest. “You remember too much,” the voice said. “That can be fixed.”

Command screamed over the radio then, actual panic breaking through. “All units evacuate, now, leave everything.”

We ran. Behind us, the ravine filled with sound, stone sliding like wet clay, deep cracks opening and closing, something adjusting its shape to the world again.

When we reached the transport, one of us was missing. No one could say when he’d fallen behind.

Back at base, they debriefed us separately. Asked careful questions, offered careful explanations. Geological anomaly, stress response, shared hallucination.

Then they made us sign forms acknowledging memory disruption protocols, I laughed when they said that. I stopped laughing when the headaches started, I still dream about the rock wall.

In the dreams, the impressions are empty, but the stone is soft again, slowly sagging inward, like it’s waiting to be used.

I was discharged six months later. Medical, non-disclosure, generous compensation. But here’s the thing. Last week, I received an email from an address that doesn’t exist.

SUBJECT: FOLLOW-UP REMOVAL
BODY: Site H-19 is no longer stable, additional impressions have appeared. We require personnel who remember the initial extraction.

I haven’t replied.

Because sometimes, when my apartment is quiet enough, I hear breathing, not in my ears, but in my thoughts, slow and patient, like something checking whether I’ve finally forgotten enough to come back. 

And I’m terrified of what will happen if I do.
