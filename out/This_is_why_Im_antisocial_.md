I’ve always been one to say that can’t be true or prove it when something iffy happens but I’m now a believer.

 It wasn’t to late maybe 6 or 7 about the time kids get home from after school activities, but it’s winter so it is still pretty dark outside. I’m home alone watching scary movies (cuz why wouldn’t I be) when I hear a knock on my door. Not gone lie it kinda got me cuz it happened at the perfect time. I go look and it’s my neighbors kid he said his phone died and he left his keys in the house and he wanted to call his mom. He calls and we both talk to her (at least I thought so) I tell her not to worry I’ll give him a snack make him do his homework and we can watch some tv till she gets off work.

 I’ve always been like an uncle to him and a brother to his mom so taking care of him is normal for me. (he’s like 16 btw so being home alone wouldn’t that big of a deal) a few hours goes by almost time for her to get off work we finish the show and I pack him some food to take to his mom. We tried to call to see when she’d be back and no answer, so I figured we’d wait till we saw her car pull up to the garage. Another hour goes by and I’m a little worried cuz of how bad it is outside, but that’s also why I’m assuming it’s taking so long to get home. I make a joke about how maybe she got pulled over and he can just sleep here tonight so he can go to school in the morning.

 A few more hours goes by and now I’m really worried. While he’s in the other room sleep I start calling hospitals and jails to really find out what’s going on but no one has her there tonight, so I call her job to see if she’s still working only to find out that she didn’t show up today. Now I’m really getting scared thinking something happened to her on the way to work and no one has found her yet. I get ready to go do a search by myself (I know I might not find anything) but it’s worth a shot. Glad I did cuz I see her car so now I’m thinking she probably got home and didn’t wanna wake him and somehow we just missed her. I go back inside and go to ask him if he wanted to stay or go to his own bed but, he’s not there anymore. (so that answers under question) something still feels off but since all the boxes are checked I never mind.

 It the next morning another knock on my door wakes me up it’s ur police asking if I’ve heard anything last night. I’m confused cuz I was up till about midnight and didn’t hear a thing, so I ask why did anything happen and he informed me that my neighbors ex husband picked up his son from school at 3 took him home then proceeded to kill the son ex wife and then himself. I’m in shock but, not trying to sound like a crazy person I kept last night to myself thinking they got the times wrong somehow and it happened after I went to bed. 

 I knew that bad feeling happened for a reason but I could never image this. I go to the kitchen to get some water, and the container that I’m sure I put in his bag was still on the counter. I go through my phone and the call that I was a part of yesterday wasn’t logged (the second one was but not the one he dialed). Honestly I think I’m going crazy so I go to take a shower and try to get my mind busy on something so I’m not so disturbed. when I get out smudged on the mirror reads goodbye and thanks for taking care of me one last time
