Hey everyone. Names George. Ever since I was a little boy, I’ve wanted a pet cat. My parents however are allergic so I was never able to get one. Now that I’m going off to college. Ive been given the opportunity to finally have one! 

I have already gotten myself a place to myself that allows pets. And after setting up the small apartment with my things. I get ready to head off and get myself a cat!

I get to the place that I have forgotten the name of. I think it was a local shelter. But anyway I enter the building and give them the information about who I am and everything and that I want a cat.

After getting information settled. We head back and I start looking for a cat. In the corner of the room in a small room full of cats that is located behind a window. There’s two cats. The woman showing me the cats says.

“Here we have Callie and Sadie. They are inseparable and it appears they have an interest in you.”

“This is good yes?”

“Oh yes! It’s good to have them interested. Now if you want one of them you will need to get them both. We tried separating them and well, I’m not allowed to tell you what happened.”

“Um ok thanks for the information. I guess I will take them both.”

“You’re in luck because you get one for free!
Here’s your paper and your crate to take them home.”

“Wait only one?”

“Never separate them keep them in the same crate.”

“Alright don’t separate them, thanks.”

I head back over to the case with my cats and the woman helps me open the case and the cats jump out and just sit there. Just staring up at me. 

“They do that. They are very well behaved.”

Says the woman helping me.

I put the crate onto the ground and they look to the crate and then back at me then the woman.

“Go on you two. Get in the crate.”

Then they both got into the crate and just sat there. 

I got the rest of things taken care of for cat adoptions. Then left to go home. 

After getting to the apartment building and going into my room. I open the crates door and they both walk out. Sit in front of me and just look up at me. I feel almost compelled to talk to them. And so I do.

“Alright you two. This is your new home. I hope you two like the place. It’s nice I guess.”

Callie and Sadie both look around in unison. Then lay their eyes on the couch in front of my tv. They then shift their eyes back to me like they are asking permission almost.

“You want to sit on the couch with me?”

Both cats chirp in unison with my answer and start walking over. I sit down and they both jump up. Go to each side of me as close as they can get and start loafing. Just watching tv. And that’s all we did for the rest of the day.

Call me whatever you like, I don’t think this is normal for cats to do. In my research about cats I found they are independent and are normally mischievous. So why are my cats just sitting in front of me just staring? And why can’t I seperate them?

Please tell me what you think. I don’t know cats enough to know if this is normal. Am I possibly in danger? I don’t know. All I know is, My cats keep staring at me in strange ways.
