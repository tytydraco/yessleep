There was a period from the end of 2022 to the middle of 2023 that was the absolute worst couple of months of my life. You don't need to know the details of it, but let's just say a lot of things happened all at once and, at some point, certain substances became heavily involved, even more than they already were. Writing was literally the only thing I had going for me—the only thing I felt like I was halfway decent at. You could argue how much those external factors ended up influencing me, but it was around that time that I got this idea for a story that I became obsessed with writing.

The narrative follows a renowned Sicilian painter in the 1950s, who also happens to be a staunch atheist, getting commissioned by his local church to depict none other than God himself. He was doubtful at first, but the pay was surprisingly decent and his benefactor had given him complete artistic freedom. He wasn't told which version of "God" to depict or even how to depict him. Sure, he could've just drawn an old bearded man floating above the clouds and called it a day, but the painter valued his talent far more than that. He decided to earnestly approach the challenge with his own skeptical perspective and see where it took him. 

In most religions, humans are the terrestrial echoes of their creator, so it wouldn't be entirely unreasonable for a human to try and put themselves in God's shoes. Say you are the first thing to ever come to be. Just like that, you simply appear, lacking any explicit direction or purpose. For a while, you probably just exist, teetering on the realm between slumber and awareness, for what good is consciousness in a realm of infinite nothing? But then, you start to wake up to the fact that you can actually make things happen, and you see the emptiness around you for what it really is—not a void, but a blank canvas.

So, you start getting creative. You create things, beautiful things—things that fill your heart with pride. After a while, you realize that beauty quickly loses its meaning if there's nothing to contrast it against, so you begrudgingly begin sullying your own creations, until you achieve what you perceive to be the perfect balance—a self-sustaining cycle of inception and entropy, wherein you alone are the everlasting constant. 

But that's precisely the problem. No matter how intricate the painting, its painter will always be the outsider, unable to truly experience the world that they've so painstakingly crafted. And so you conceive of the next best thing: proxies—creatures capable of higher reasoning mirroring your own, yet still prone to the natural laws you've put into place. 

You observe with increasing curiosity as these creatures, these pale reflections of your omnipotent self, begin perceiving and rationalizing the world independently from you. Initially, you can't help yourself but interfere and aid them in their times of need, for you're eager to see what path each of them may choose to take. In turn, they acknowledge you, even venerate you, and for the first time in your fathomless existence you don't feel so isolated. 

As millennia elapse, you start noticing a growing sentiment spreading amongst your pet project. While the majority may be content with simply thriving in the sandbox you've made for them, there are those whose imaginations strive to reach beyond it. Beyond you. They crave not your approval, but to rather confront you as equals, and ask what the meaning of all of this is. 

You are likely pleasantly surprised, at first. Finally, a turn of events that you genuinely couldn't have predicted, for you've never had to ponder such things yourself. You are all there is, after all. Your enthusiasm is soon quelled by a growing realization, however:

These creatures are all, ultimately, iterations of you, for you cannot create something that you don't understand. Given enough time, they may just achieve their goal of becoming your equals. But what then? Their limitations are the very thing that make them distinct. Once they transcend them, they will, in a sense, become you, and you will be back where you started—alone in an unthinking, predictable universe.   

And so, you distance yourself, becoming increasingly disengaged from  their daily toils in hopes that they would forget you. When that doesn't work, you introduce even more adversity into their lives, with the goal of inculcating within them an appreciation of existence for its own sake. Plagues, famines, natural disasters—you raze the very foundations of human society again and again. And yet, the outcome is always the same. Once the immediate threat is overcome and relative stability is achieved, their attention inevitably turns back towards you, or rather, what you symbolize. The unknown—a chance at something greater. 

In your frustration, you ponder whether you should just wipe the slate clean and start over, despite already being aware of the outcome. Again, you can't create something that you don't understand and trust that probability will guide them towards a different path. If that were possible, you would've already done it. Much like a Pacific salmon's programming compels it to reproduce itself, even at the cost of its own life, an intelligent being will always seek to expand its knowledge, no matter how self-destructive said knowledge may turn out to be. With all of its terrestrial needs met, it will inherently seek out new problems to surmount, among which the cosmic reason behind its own existence.

And yet the paradox lies in the fact that knowledge, by its very nature, is finite. What worse fate for a sentient being than to exist in a universe where no unique thoughts exist? Where every concept has already been understood and categorically delineated countless times over? Where every form of artistic expression has been thoroughly exhausted, and where every sensation has been rendered trivial?

There's a paragraph where the painter explains his train of thought thusly:

"Imagine a hamster that's suddenly been given the capacity for higher thought. Upon understanding the limitations of its enclosure, it prompts it to aspire for more and to contemplate beyond its immediate surroundings. Leveraging the advanced problem-solving capabilities of its newly-acquired intellect, combined with time and perseverance, it inevitably finds a way out. Now imagine realizing that the outside world is merely a continuation of the same, complete with its own bigger hamster that's been observing you this whole time."

The story was supposed to end with the painter's cousin going over to check on him, as nobody had seen him leave his apartment in months. Her worst fears come to pass when she discovers him deceased and decaying at his desk, with a Bible spread out in front of him. While the exact cause of the death remains unspecified, the woman deduces that, consumed by his fixation, he had simply expired from either exhaustion or lack of nourishment. 

Adjacent to the grim scene, his nearly-completed artwork still sits upon its easel, left to bake in the warm midday sunlight filtering through the window. Initially puzzled by the abstract nature of the piece compared to the painter's usual style, the woman isn't quite sure what to make of it. The more she stares at it, however, the clearer the overall picture becomes, and the tighter the invisible hand around her heart begins to squeeze. 

What from a distance she perceived as hundreds of small black dots reveal themselves to be the tiny silhouettes of people, all congregated in front of a grand ivory gate adorned with angelic motifs, as though waiting to be let in. On the opposite side of that same gate, a larger and more detailed silhouette sits alone in a crooked chair, surrounded by an empty room wherein only he resides. He holds aloft a sign slightly angled towards the viewer, enabling the clear reading of its message inscribed in bold Latin.

To this day, I've always known what I intended for it to say, but I just can't bring myself to finish the story. I've tried on several occasions, believe me. It's been sitting in my drafts for nearly two years now. I just can't. Writing about the things that go bump in the night is one thing, but this is a different kind of horror. It encapsulates the existential nihilism that has been a persistent presence throughout my adult life, and then compresses it into a single sentence, barely six words long. 

I know it probably seems insane to you. I'm well aware. Yet I can't shake the feeling that if those words ever left my head, I'd be somehow proven right.
