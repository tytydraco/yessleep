I was three years old. That year, I had become an avid reader thanks to my leap pad that I got for Christmas. Soon, I started to look over my parent's "big-kid" books. One caught my fancy... It was *The Dark Tower* by Stephen King. Now you might be saying that I could not comprehend what was happening in the book. And I think that too, from time to time. But this nightmare puts that out of the question. 

It was late when I woke up. Everyone was asleep, as I could hear my parents snoring. The room was poor light, with only my night light emitting light. I couldn't move my body, and soon, I couldn't breathe. 

I saw something, no someone, start to walk into my room. It was a boy, a bit older than me at the time. He walked into the center of the room and just stared at me. His face is something that will scar me for life. His eyes were sewn shut with his mouth sewn open into a big smile.

Scared, I reached for my teddy bear, Beary. But, Beary was nowhere to be found. Still, not able to move my body, I turn my eyes towards the floor where Beary lay. 

The boy followed my eyes and saw Beary laying there. In a second, he grabbed Beary and sat down in the middle of my room. Soon, he was playing with it. All I could do was look at that boy playing with my bear and scream. 

After a few moments, I heard laughing. Looking again at the boy, I notice this time he has a pair of scissors. Seeming to know his plan, I start screaming at him to let go of my bear. Instead of letting go, the boy looks at me dead, with a blank expression, and cuts Beary's head off. 

In a second, I was able to move, so I rolled out of bed. The boy was faster, as he ran down the hallway toward my sister/parents' room. 

Taking time to investigate Beary, I hear a scream coming from my sister's room. This time, screaming my head off, I run full speed towards her room. 

Before I even walked in, I saw the head on the rope. My sister was decapitated, with her body laying still in a defensive position. The boy was nowhere to be seen, so I try screaming for my parents. No result came from that, and ultimate fear came through me. 

I was paralyzed for what felt like hours, but in seconds, I was out of my sister's room and running toward my parents. Laughter filled the hallway as I heard the scream of my mom, then dad. 

Running into their room, I see all the blood. There was blood all around their bed, and I could see my dad's slashed throat, with blood spurting out of his cut. Looking over at my mom, I see only blood, no head. Hearing laughter, I snap my head toward the source. It was the boy, holding my mother's head by her hair. 

I hear someone calling my name, and I call back. Quickly, I wake up trying to crawl over my baby gate. It was all a dream...
