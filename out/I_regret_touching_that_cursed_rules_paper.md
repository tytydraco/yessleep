 I was walking back home after a hard work day, but I noticed that it's really quiet here. Not even a car or even the wind. Something was off, indeed, but I didn't care.

As I was walking, trying to hear something in paranoia, I tripped and fell on the ground. I found a piece of old paper sitting in front of my face while I was trying to get up. Once I got back on my legs, I took that paper and felt something weird, like goosebumps... but cold?

The paper turned out to be some weird set of rules:

*Welcome lost stranger... If you wish to increase your chances of survival, I'd recommend you to read this rules paper. After you're done reading it, simply leave it back where you took it,* ***~~because you will leave it there anyways.~~***

1. *Finding the way home isn't possible, but finding the way out is.*
2. *Don't kill the mosquitos. There are actually quite a lot there. Just let them take what they want.*
3. *Don't look at the spiders. They don't want to be looked at.* ***~~they just want food~~***
4. *If you see a big shadow figure, just ignore it. It's a lost stranger,* ***~~that will never find the way out of here just like you.~~***
5. *Never, I repeat NEVER, look at the the sky.* ***~~They are always above you, waiting.~~***
6. *Don't trust anyone,* ***~~or anything.~~*** *Even that paper. =)*
7. *Technology doesn't work here. Nothing does.* ***~~Even you.~~***
8. *Don't enter any buildings. Neighbors aren't neighbors, and home isn't home.* ***~~It's their now.~~***
9. *Run away from any sounds. Silence is the best thing you will see here, trust me.*

*You probably have a lot of questions, but they can't be answered yet. Remember to put the paper down. Remember to find the exit.* ***~~REMEMBER TO DIE~~***\*.\*

After reading that paper I decided to put it down since it told me to do that 2 times... I kept on walking, thinking that paper is some kind of a prank made by some edgy teenagers, but things kept getting weird. The more I walked the more I started to feel that... feeling when you're scared.

I felt like I'm getting stared at from every single angle. I started shaking and my neck couldn't look up, even though I was sure it was a prank. What if it wasn't?? What if I looked up and something happened?? A question I couldn't answer myself.

I saw my house, but something was different. My son's bike wasn't on the front like it used to, and the lights weren't on (which wasn't normal for my family). I yelled "Hello!?" in fear thinking that that old paper was real.

A minute or 2 passed, I froze in fear, until I heard a whisper in my right ear. It sounded like someone "shh" at me. I immediately turned and screamed, but no one was there...

Was I hallucinating?? Is it all fake??

I decided to keep walking to check is there any neighbor there. As I was walking on the empty street, I heard some weird noise. I turned around, and saw a spider bigger than my house. I immediately closed my eyes thinking I will die.

It's been like 5 minutes, and I finally decided to open one of my eyes. Luckily, the spider was gone.

I started screaming and then I heard the "shh" whisper again. I froze in fear. Half an hour of crying and regretting life decisions, I got up and continued to walk. I saw a child running, but I immediately turned around and took an another path.

I realized that the street was endless. All houses looked the same. Was it a loop or endless? No one will know. I just laid down in the grass, and tried to sleep. I couldn't. Even the floor was staring at me. After so much time of waiting, I screamed "I can't anymore!" and looked at the sky with hope to die and free myself from that.

And now here I am... I woke up in a mental hospital. It's been one hour since that happened, and now I'm writing it down. There's only one problem... ***~~ITS STILL STARING AT ME.~~***

Thanks for reading!

A QUICK NOTE: I might make a second part of that, but I'm not sure about it.

Please LMK if I gave that post the wrong flair.

Share your opinion in the comments, It's my second story btw. :)

Have a nice day!!
