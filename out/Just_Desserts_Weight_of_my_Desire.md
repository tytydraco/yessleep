I always thought I had control—of my career, my life, my women. It started as a game in my younger days, figuring out how to walk the line between ambition and indulgence. I liked women who admired me, women who needed me. They always made life… easier.

Mary had been one of those women. I hired her directly. She wasn’t my type—older, frumpier, and carrying the kind of weight most men ignored. But Mary had a warmth about her, a sense of humor that could make even the most tedious office day tolerable. She was smart, grounded, and kind. She believed me when I told her my marriage was falling apart.

I told her I needed someone who understood me. Someone who wasn’t cold and dismissive, like my wife. She filled the gaps my marriage had left behind, and for a while, she made me feel like I wasn’t the failure my wife always accused me of being. Mary believed we had a future, but when the India trip came up, everything changed.

India was supposed to be a simple business trip—a chance to connect with our remote team and build morale. That’s when I met Priyam. She wasn’t just beautiful; she was intoxicating. Her skin was flawless, her hair a cascading waterfall of silk. She moved like she knew every pair of eyes in the room was on her. She knew her power, and she wielded it without hesitation.

I should have kept my distance, but Priyam had a way of making herself the center of attention. She laughed at my jokes, her lips curving into a smile that promised everything. She leaned in closer during conversations, her perfume wrapping itself around me like a spell. She was younger, hungrier, and more sensual than Mary could ever hope to be.

By the time I returned from India, I was obsessed. Priyam wasn’t just a fling; she was a revelation. She made me feel alive in a way I hadn’t felt in years. I avoided Mary for weeks, dodging her texts and emails until she finally cornered me in the office.

“*Roger, what’s going on?*” she asked, her voice trembling. “*You’ve been distant since you got back.*”

I couldn’t lie to her—not entirely. “*We’re not going anywhere, Mary*,” I said, cold and detached. 

Her face crumpled, and I remember the way her shoulders sagged as if I had physically struck her. She resigned a week later. I didn’t even tell her I fell for someone or that someone was Priyam. What would have been the point? 

Priyam was everything I’d ever wanted. She was submissive yet fiery, seductive yet playful. She kept me on my toes in ways no woman ever had. I loved the way her lacy pink bras teased me, the way she could turn a simple glance into a promise. She was married, too, but she justified our affair as life balancing itself out. She said her husband neglected her, that she deserved to feel wanted.

I told myself the same thing. We deserved each other. But what I didn’t tell her—what I couldn’t admit even to myself—was that Priyam wasn’t the first. She was just the first I’d fallen for.

It all came crashing down in a single night. My wife found me in the study, the door ajar, Priyam’s naked body on the screen. I hadn’t even noticed her standing there until she slammed the keyboard in rage. The screen flickered, and before I could react, the video call broadcast to everyone on our company network.

“What is this, Roger?” my wife screamed, her voice cutting through my panic. “Cheating is one thing, but with some hussy from work? Priyam, of all people?!”

Her voice echoed through the speakers as my colleagues logged in one by one, their shocked faces filling the screen. Priyam’s name was out there now, her reputation shredded along with mine.

Priyam broke soon after. I heard she was admitted to the hospital after trying to harm herself with shards of a mirror. I wanted to visit her, to tell her I still loved her, but what could I have said?  
That night, I drank myself to sleep in the Airbnb. I thought the whiskey would drown the noise in my head, but it only amplified it.

I woke—or thought I did—to Mary sitting beside me. Her face was calm, but her eyes were sharp, accusing. Then my wife appeared at the foot of the bed, arms crossed, her lips twisted in a sneer. Finally, Priyam joined them, her thighs bloodied, her hands clutching glass shards.

“You’re nothing,” Mary said, her voice low and venomous. “I wasted my time on you.”

“You’re overweight and unappealing,” I snapped, the words spilling out before I could stop them.

“You’re useless as a lover,” my wife said coldly. “I was better off with my vibrator.”

“Shrew. Cold. Frigid,” I retorted, my voice rising in anger.

Then Priyam spoke, her voice breaking. “You’re a coward, Roger. You let them destroy me. You let me destroy myself.”

She began slicing her thighs with the glass, her blood pooling around her. “Save me, Roger,” she cried, her voice desperate.

I turned to Mary and my wife. “Help her! Stop her!” I screamed.

“Why should we?” Mary replied, her voice dripping with contempt. “You did this.”

Their voices grew louder, overlapping, drowning me in accusations. I begged, pleaded, but they didn’t stop.  
I woke up screaming, my throat raw, my body drenched in sweat. The banging on the door didn’t register until I heard the voices—neighbors, police. They broke it down and found me on the floor, clutching my head, muttering incoherently about blood and glass.

I lost everything that night—my career, my reputation, my sanity. My bosses didn’t care about my past contributions. The police report of my alcohol-fueled breakdown in the rented house became public and in such a small industry, I was suddenly too toxic and now, expendable.

I thought I could control my life, but the truth is, I was never in control. Not of my career, not of my women, not even of myself. Now, all I have left is the weight of my own actions, crushing me day by day.
