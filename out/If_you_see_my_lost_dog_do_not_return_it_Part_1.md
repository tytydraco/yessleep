My name is Claire. I remember the day I bought Fen. He was so cute and cuddly. A German Shephard puppy barely a month old, he was my best friend. He was my comforter during the hardest times in my life. Boyfriends come and go, friends leave, but Fen was always there. All of this makes it even harder as I cry with the shovel in my hands, burying him. Although some part of me knows this isn’t the last time I’ll see him. 

I should back up, not from the very beginning but close. Fen and I were sitting on the porch listening to the winds. The cool Norwegian air blew a bit colder this night. Not temperature cold, a different kind of cold. It felt wrong, it felt evil. I knew all the stories of giants and trolls and all the other mythical creatures the Edda and other poems. I never believed any of them of course, but still creepy. I thought nothing of it until Fen sat up. He was laying down at my feet and he hit me getting up. 

"Fen!"

He didn't even look at me, usually saying his name made him look at me expecting a treat. He just went to the end of the porch and stared. We lived in the woods of Norway, the front of my house opened up into massive amounts of trees. Fen started to woof very quietly. Just then a light came from up the driveway, it was an immensely bright blue light. It was blinding but Fen stared into it. He darted off into the woods. I've never seen him run so fast. It wasn't a chasing kind of run, or like he was running after something. It was like he was running joyfully. It was a fast run but looked like he was running to me. I yelled after him.

"Fen! Come back!" 

All I got was a far off bark. I waited for hours for him to come back. Soon after he ran off the light seemed to turn off. I figured it was headlights and he ran to see what it was, and Fen was dognapped. Like I said I waited for hours, I was almost morning light when I thought I saw Fen. I swore I saw him, he was in the tree line and he just looked at me. He woofed then ran off. I know that run anywhere, that was Fen. I waited a little longer until going in and going to bed. I figured I would put up missing posters later in the day, but for now I need to rest. 

I am a freelance writer so I work from home thankfully, I could do my work whenever I wanted to. I went to bed around 6:30am and woke up around noon. I wrote up some missing dog posters for Fen and went into town to post them up. I went to the post office of my small town first. 

"Missing dog Claire?" It was Turid the sweet little post office lady asked.

"Yeah. Fen ran off last night."

She knew Fen as did everyone in the town. He was everyone's best friend. Every business in the town allowed me to bring Fen inside, even the restaurants. The reply of he ran off broke Turid as she heard it. 

"Oh, well I'm sorry to hear that sweetie."

"It's okay. I'm sure he'll be back soon."

"Let's hope so." She walked off with her walker.

I posted a few more posters around the town. I saw him again, he was following me. Not close at all but he was. I saw him in the corner of my eye, when I looked he would tuck behind a car. Peeking at me. I will always remember his eyes, they aren't his.
