I wasn’t really sure I was ever going to tell this story. To me, there are much better ways to spend my time than recounting the one time in my life I felt real fear. To be honest, I was content to have kicked this memory to the far reaches of my mind, but unfortunately it didn’t stay there.

Recently, I’d made the mistake of trying to get rid of my surplus of random junk, and ended up cleaning out my closet. I happily combed through the various jackets, sweatshirts, and hoodies I owned, content to separate them into various piles as I decided on what to do with them. I went to reach for another, firmly grasping the collar of a dark coat as I wrenched it out into the open.

The second I saw what it was, I almost dropped it.

My fingers numbly pulled at the collar, turning it over in my hands until I was looking square at it. It was my old blue peacoat, a hand-me-down from my father that I’d received years ago. It was heavy, and had kept me warm for quite a few cold winter nights. Normally, warmth would bubble up inside me at the memory of a gift like that, but no, the only sensation that flooded me was fear like an icy hand, gripping my heart so tightly I thought it might burst.

Fear at the memory of the last time I’d seen this coat.

But I’m getting off track, enough about the coat for now. I’d rather switch focus to the reason you’re here, the story. I graduated college last year, and I’m happy to say that unlike most people who went to school during the pandemic, my years at college were some of the best in my life. I’d been lucky enough to land an offer at a pretty famous school that was in state, and once I’d made it there, it was only a matter of time before I fell into a great friend group. I’d ended up in a quad with a couple guys that I was proud to call my best friends, and we spent night after night having the time of our lives in Oakland hall. We were lucky enough to end up there. Oakland was a way better dorm than most others. There was air conditioning, private bathrooms, and even a lavish glass lounge that we frequently took over to shoot the shit in the evenings. 

While my social life blossomed, that was only part of college. The academics were tough, and that’s saying something considering I majored in Finance. It wasn’t the toughest major, but I struggled, and frequently found myself needing to postpone parties or kickbacks in order to study. There was only one small problem with that, I had trouble focusing in most places. I needed quiet in order to study, and the raucous buzz that constantly filled my dorm room was definitely less than ideal. 

The lounge didn’t work out either. Sure, it was quieter than my room, but being the extrovert that I was, all it would take was seeing one friend walk past the glass windows and the next thing I knew I’d be chatting with them for hours, my schoolwork long forgotten. No, if I wanted to really buckle down and get some good grades, I needed to aim higher. Thankfully I found my sanctuary in the school’s massive library. Sure, it was a bit of a walk from my dorm, but the serene atmosphere and quiet study halls made it absolutely worth the trip. Once I started committing my evenings to studying there, my grades began to skyrocket.

If the library itself was my sanctuary, then the seventh floor was my oasis. It was perfect. Unlike the first few floors of the vast library, the seventh floor was a designated quiet area. The first and second were usually bustling with activity, and floors three through five were usually packed to the brim with angsty and stressed college kids. Not my kind of setting. 

Somehow, the seventh always seemed to have an open spot for me. 

It also had water fountains to refill my bottle, as well as a relaxing air that put me at ease, which was invaluable during midterms and finals. Usually the only thing you ever had to worry about were couples trying to hook up in the bathrooms, but that was about it.

It quickly became the only place I ever studied at on campus, and as more and more high test scores came in, I really grew to love the place. It became a part of my college experience. Looking back on it now, I really do miss those calm nights, but that doesn’t matter now.

I can’t ever go back there.

And I’ll tell you why.

It was a cold winter night during my junior year. One of those nights that made you question why you even set foot outside the dorm. Sadly, I didn’t have much of a choice. I was in desperate need of my seventh floor study hall. I had two finals the following week, the twin banes of my existence, intermediate accounting and business finance. 

As I made the long walk to the library, I could help but resent my situation. Yet another night in with the boys I was going to miss. But it had to be done. I needed these exams done and dusted. A ragged sigh tore its way through my exasperated lips as I continued, watching my breath curl out in front of me, a cruel reminder of just how cold it was. Thankfully I had my dad’s peacoat wrapped around me, bundling me up against the elements. My heavy backpack also helped to keep me warm as I continued to trek through campus. It was pitch black out, the streetlights doing well to keep my path illuminated. There weren’t many people out, and as I began to make my way around the massive stadium that marked the halfway point of my journey, I couldn’t help but feel a bit creeped out by the silence that had descended over campus.

It was around 12:00 am. Maybe 12:15. I had always been a night owl, and I’d be damned if I was going to waste daylight cramped up in a study hall. Finally I arrived at my destination, rubbing my hands together to warm them up as a burst of wonderfully hot air hit me. I flashed my school ID to the person working the front desk as I’d done so many times before, deftly strolling through the library’s main floor, punching the elevator button. There were two elevators on the first floor. The main one that took maybe eight hours to reach your floor considering just how many people used it, and the side elevator not enough people knew about. I took the side elevator, waiting patiently as it carried me up through the building, letting out a polite *ding* as I made it to the seventh floor. 

It was as it ever was. Quiet. The floor was empty, as usual this time of night, a fact that I took quite a bit of pleasure in. No distractions. The faster I could knock out these practice exams the better. I walked down the halls, making a left from the elevator until I made it to paradise. That being two packed rows of desks tucked away in a corner. There were maybe about ten per row, and there were four rows. The desks included a little shelf attached to the top. The rows in the middle faced away from each other, and the other two framed the walls. In the corners were two desks that faced the entrance. I opted for one of the desks on the left, plopping down my bag and slinging my heavy coat over the chair. 

Shortly after, I began to work, carving my way through accounting problem after accounting problem. Nobody bothered me. Not that I was expecting anyone to. No, I just popped my airpods in and listened to whatever music I had on my playlist. Now, I’ve definitely sung the praises of the seventh floor, and while I really did love it, there were a few things I *really* didn’t like.

The main one being the lights. The lights were hooked up to a sensor, and if the sensor didn’t detect movement for an extended period, the lights would dim for a brief second, then shut off entirely. It was pretty spooky the first time it happened, but it quickly morphed into more of a nuisance. I only needed to stand up and wave my hands to trigger the sensor, and before I knew it the fluorescent lights would come back to life, bathing the room in that classic gas station convenience store lighting. 

As I was working, I saw light begin to dim, the telltale sign they were about to shut off, and sighed. I stood up, waving my hands as they flicked back on. I took a moment to stretch, before deciding I was going to have a well deserved bathroom break. I walked back down the hall, making the turn and passing the elevator. My eyes roved over the various bookshelves that framed my walk to the men’s room. Sadly, the seventh floor wasn’t exactly a great place for reading material. Only court records and historical texts. 

As I made my way towards the bathroom I heard what sounded like a scraping noise from ahead of me. I’m a little ashamed to admit it, but I jumped. I’d always had a hair trigger, and try as I might, I couldn’t really parse out where the sound had come from. It could’ve been from one of the bookshelves, or maybe it was further down. I chuckled to myself, chalking my reaction up to too many late night horror movies with the boys as I continued down the hall, finally arriving at the bathroom.

In hindsight, I never should have gone in. I should’ve just packed up and left.

But I didn’t. I pushed through the deep blue door and began to make my way towards one of the urinals.

Then I froze. 

Someone was there, standing in the middle of the bathroom. I’ll never forget what he looked like, not until the day I die. He was a big guy, maybe 6’3. He wore a deep brown hoodie with the hood drawn up, and cargo pants leading down to black sneakers. I couldn’t really tell his age. He looked around mine, but I wasn’t sure. The thing that got my attention though was the K-N95 strapped to his face. It was black, and looked pretty rough, like it had been shoved in a pocket one too many times.

“Sorry, I didn’t know anyone else was here.” I joked as I tried to shake off the surprise. It wasn’t like the guy was doing anything wrong. I just hadn’t been expecting to see anyone here. Like I said, the only time I ever really saw people here was when I’d interrupt horny teens hooking up.

The guy didn’t respond, instead electing to just stare at me. His dark eyes seemed to bore into me as he sized me up. The lower half of his face moved, but I couldn’t tell what expression he was making with the mask covering it. It wasn’t unusual to see someone with a mask. It was 2022, and the pandemic was still pretty recent in everyone’s minds.

Regardless, I couldn’t help but feel strange as I stared back at him. The first thing that struck me as odd was where he was standing. He wasn’t in front of a urinal, or leaning over the sinks. He was standing square in the middle of the room. It didn’t look like he was going to use the bathroom or leave it either. He just stood there, like he was rooted to the spot. 

Alarm bells were beginning to ring in my head. I was a firm believer in the men’s public bathroom code, a sacred oath every guy swears. You don’t make eye contact, you don’t stand next to each other at the urinals, and you don’t talk. Sure, I had just violated the code myself, but it was more to mask my nerves at seeing someone else that late at night. But something about this guy unsettled me. Something about the way his eyes followed me as I continued walking into the restroom.

I’m not sure what came over me, but I remember leaning forward and asking. “Hey man, are you good?” 

Once again, he didn’t say anything. He just stood there, not once breaking eye contact with me. Hindsight being 20-20, I should’ve just turned around and left, taking a leak somewhere else. But I didn’t want to make him feel uncomfortable, so I stepped forward, my plan of using the urinal long forgotten as I walked towards the nearest stall. As I passed him to make my way over to one of the stalls, the man turned around and began to follow me. I sped up, wanting to put some distance between us as I felt a cold chill settle on my skin. But it turns out he wasn’t following me. No, he changed course, choosing instead to stand at one of the urinals.

I stepped into the stall, closing and locking the door. I did my business as quickly as possible, straining my ears for the sound of a door opening and closing. Any indication that he was gone. Unfortunately, I wasn’t quite that lucky. As I buckled my belt, I couldn’t help but pause as my fingers hovered over the stall door’s handle. I realized I didn't want to go back out there. Something about that guy was off. Why did he wait for me to head to the stall before he went over to the urinal? How long had he been standing here in the bathroom? I’d been on the seventh floor for well over two hours at this point. How had I not heard or seen him? He wasn’t exactly easy to miss.

My chest began to rapidly rise and fall as my breathing quickened, my fingers twitching over the stall door’s handle. Was I about to get jumped? Was he going to rob me? Was he waiting for me? Why was he here? I forced myself to take a deep breath, driving those thoughts away, trying to dismiss them as simply me overthinking. Maybe he was just weird, or maybe even special needs. I was no one to judge. But I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t ready for a fight the second I pushed that door open. 

To my dismay, he was still at the urinal, his back to me. I strode forward, quickly throwing the handle to the sink, trying to ignore my nervous expression in the mirror directly in front of me. He was a few feet to my right, the urinals directly beside the sinks. As I scrubbed my hands, the unsettling feeling returned, and on a gut feeling I hazarded a look through the mirror to see what the man was doing.

What I saw threatened to make me sick, my stomach dropping as I made a horrifying realization. 

He’d been watching me the whole time through the mirror, with that same expression on his face. 

To this day, I think that moment was the first and only time in my life I felt true terror. I shook my fingers dry frantically as I stomped towards the bathroom door, throwing it open as my fight or flight senses finally kicked in. I had to get out of there. I couldn't stand being stared at by him anymore. I swallowed past the lump in my throat as I nearly ran back through the halls, wiping away the cold sweat that accumulated at my brow. I finally made it back to my pack and coat. I quickly shoved my laptop back into my bag. But as I went to do the same for my notebook, I hesitated. 

I really didn’t get much work done tonight. And you’re more than welcome to call me an idiot, but as I held my notebook, I came to the conclusion that I couldn’t just wrap up my study session here. But I also was still on guard, so I took my stuff and stood up, electing to walk a few paces deeper into the hall, setting up my stuff at one of the two corner desks that faced the entrance. As long as I had eyes on the entrance, nobody could sneak up on me. Against my better judgment, I set up my computer and resumed studying, trying desperately to shake off the encounter I’d had minutes prior. I would frequently glance up, still a bit rattled by the guy in the bathroom. But thankfully, I didn’t see anything.

For another hour, nothing happened, and finally after wrapping up a second full practice exam, I was ready to call it quits. Just as I slid my laptop into my bag, the lights began to dim. I cursed as I went to stand up, missing the window by only a few seconds. The study hall went dark, and after the night I’d had, it was more than enough to creep me out. I stood up immediately, waving my hands like a madman to activate the sensor. Thankfully it registered the movements, and the lights flicked back on.

But not before I saw something disappear behind the corner of the entryway.

I had only seen it for a split second, but a glimpse was all I needed. Whatever it was, it was a deep brown. The same color as the man from the bathroom’s hoodie. My heart sank as I put the pieces together. He’d been watching me. He’d been watching me while I put my stuff away.

He was still here. 

I’d been hoping against hope that he’d left. But once again, I wasn’t so lucky. Needless to say, I was regretting my decision to stay, and was ready to rectify that. I slung my pack over my shoulder. Grabbing my coat with the other as plans began slamming into my brain, escape routes, diversions, anything I could do to get away from this guy as quickly as I could. I waited for a few beats, for him to come blazing around the corner like something out of my worst nightmares. But he didn’t, and after a few minutes of waiting, I began to creep forward. My heart began to pound against my chest, battering my ribcage with every throb. Blood roared in my ears as I clenched my heavy peacoat tightly. It didn’t put it on, the last thing I wanted was to be weighed down. Finally, after mustering up some courage I definitely didn’t have, I exploded around the corner to find–

Nothing. 

There was nobody there. My shoulders slumped as the tenseness left my body, but only for a second as I began to jog down the hallway, back towards the elevator. I crossed the first bookcase, looking around in all directions frantically to make sure I wasn’t being followed, any element of stealth gone as my feet pounded against the linoleum tile. I passed another bookcase. Only a few more to go.

Then finally, I saw him.

It was just as I passed what must’ve been the fifth or sixth bookcase. It was impossible to miss him out of the corner of my eye. I skidded to a stop, my eyes sliding over to him. I should’ve kept running, but I couldn’t. Call it morbid curiosity or just pure fear, but my feet were rooted to the ground, as if they’d been encased in concrete.

He stood in the middle of the row of bookcases, looking down at a book he’d plucked off the shelf, thumbing through the pages. If he had heard me, he didn’t show it, content instead to continue looking down at his book. He was angled away from me. I couldn’t see his expression. I was thankful for it, it meant I didn’t have to feel those eyes on me again. His shoulders bounced as he chuckled to himself, finding whatever he was reading amusing.

My eyes widened. That didn’t make any sense though. This was the seventh floor. There were only court records and historical documents here. There wasn’t anything here worth reading, let alone laughing at. But I wasn’t going to stick around to find out. But just as I went to sprint towards the elevator, he turned towards me, and I almost screamed. He was staring directly at me, his eyes just as foreboding as they were back in the bathroom, but there was one key difference. 

His mask was gone, and in its place was a smile. 

A smile that I’ll never be able to erase from my memory no matter how hard I try. It was stretched almost unnaturally wide, as if he was purposefully trying to pull his lips as far apart as he could. He let the book slip from his fingers as his eyes roved wildly over me. We stood there like that for a few seconds, I sat there, trembling as for the first time in my life I experienced what it was like to be frozen with fear. It’s a sensation I don't recommend to anyone. Your body locks up, your breathing becomes labored, like your lungs just can’t get enough air. I wanted to curl up and cry, anything to get away from that smile.

Then he took a step forward, his grin never wavering. I was able to move again, rearing an arm back and throwing the only thing I could in a desperate attempt to ward him away from me. My old blue peacoat sailed through the air, but I didn’t stick around to see if it hit anything. No, I sprinted like I’d never sprinted before, dragging in ragged breaths as I crossed the seventh floor in record time. I threw open the emergency stairs door, leaping down steps, sometimes four or five at a time. The sound of a door slamming above me sent chills down my spine as I sailed down the several flights of stairs until I reached the bottom floor. I shouldered through the door and sprinted back through the library’s lobby and into the cold, dark night.

Despite the freezing weather, I can’t recall even feeling cold as I sprinted through campus. The lack of a coat didn’t even cross my mind as I tore down street after street, checking over my shoulder constantly for any sign of the man in the brown hoodie. My lungs burned, and finally I gassed out, stumbling towards the stadium’s outer wall as I dragged in agonizing breath after agonizing breath. I only let myself rest for a few seconds before I continued.

I finally made it back to my dorm, getting inside and heading to my room as quickly as possible. My roommate Zack greeted me as I opened the door, wearing his classic tired smile. It ran away from his face pretty quickly as he took in my appearance.

“Dawg, are you good?” 

I mumbled something out as I dropped my stuff at the foot of my bed. Trying to get my heart rate under control. Thankfully, Zack’s voice did a good job at cutting through my thoughts of the man in the brown hoodie.

“It’s freezing out there man, where’s your coat?”

I just shrugged, not really in the mood to relive what I’d just dealt with. It hurt to lose my dad’s coat, but it served its purpose. It had protected me when it really mattered. Zack ended up dragging me into whatever shenanigans our other two roommates were engaged in, and it really did help take my mind off of things. I finally went to bed around 4:00 am. It didn’t take a genius to know I’d have trouble sleeping that night, so I popped a few melatonin tablets and before I knew it I was fast asleep.

/

I woke up sometime in the early afternoon, my head swimming from the sleeping pills I’d taken the night prior. Unfortunately, the grogginess I felt wasn’t enough to distract me from my encounter with the strange man on the seventh floor. I had told my roommates about it, and despite their early twenties male bravado, even they struggled to conceal just how unsettling the story was. But I didn’t have to dwell on it for long as Zack extended the invitation to go hit the dining hall with him and get ourselves some good ol’ 1:00 pm breakfast.

We made idle chit chat as we relaxed in the elevator, talking about the latest soccer matches and funniest memes we’d seen the night prior. As we pushed through the glass doors of the lobby to the brisk outside air, I went to make another joke, something about a mario kart game we’d played last night. But Zack wasn’t paying attention, no his vision was directed over towards the wall of our building.

I followed his gaze, and my heart stopped as my eyes fell upon a small blue bundle that had been laid against the brick dorm wall.

“Dude is that–” Zack began, but he only made it a few words before I cut him off.

“My coat.” I breathed, my voice barely above a whisper. There it was, my dad’s blue peacoat laying in a heap at the base of the building. I don’t remember much else after that point. I recall sprinting over to it and turning the mass of cloth over in my trembling hands. Weirdly enough, one detail I cling to is just how hot I was. It felt like my skin was bathed in scalding water as I tried desperately to swallow past a lump in my throat. I could’ve *sworn* I wasn’t followed. But then again, I had been so terrified I hadn’t exactly been thorough. But regardless, that didn’t matter.

He knew where I lived.

The rest of the story is a blur. I remember staying in my dorm for a few days, doing my classes from home. Every time I set foot outside my dorm room I was afraid, terrified that the next spot I looked I’d see him leering at me. That every corner I came across he’d be waiting right behind it to do whatever the hell he was going to do to me that night on the seventh floor.

But nothing ever happened. Eventually, our time at our dorm hall ended, and me and the boys got an apartment slightly off campus. After a few months, I slowly forgot about the smiling stranger. I never went back to the seventh floor though. Hell, I didn’t go back to the library for almost a year. 

Like I said before, I’m not sure why I’m telling you all this, but after seeing that old peacoat as I cleared out my closet, I knew I just had to let somebody else know.  If you end up in a situation like I did, tell someone. Notify security, take a video of them, anything to keep yourself safe.

Or do what I did, run and hide, and try to forget just how wide that damn smile was.

I did have one more thing for you guys. I'd asked my roommate Zack to do this for me. It's a picture of the bathroom. I couldn't stomach it to go myself, thankfully he went in my stead.
