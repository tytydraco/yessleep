No one noticed the day the sign showed up outside the gas station.

"This is not a public bus stop. Private coaches only."

It looked professional, but no one was aware of any bus company operating through our town. Nor would anyone expect a bus company to be interested in making a stop here either. 

Our town sits in the middle of flat prairies, an hour in either direction from the larger towns along the main highway. The secondary highway that crosses here travels much farther before there are any towns or cities. The only reason this is a town at all is because of our gas station. Our gas station also serves as the local coffee shop, restaurant, grocery store, hardware store and hub of all social gossip.

The sign was odd, and of course started all manner of local rumors. A new bus line was going to start offloading here, or this was the nearest city planning on installing some tourist attraction. 

The speculation went on for weeks before the first passenger came.

The passenger was wholly unremarkable. Average height, average weight, wearing a light jacket, jeans, sneakers. This person was so average it could be described as being so vague as to be "the most useless police description ever"

The passenger appeared to be dropped off as though they were a hitch hiker, which was common enough in our town. But instead of heading into the gas station,  they walked over and stood by the bus stop.

Within 10 minutes a large white motorcoach pulled up, picked up the passenger and drove off. The windows were all tinted, and there were no charter company logos on the bus, so we all just sat back in confusion.

9 days later there were 6 passengers waiting at the stop. All the passengers were dressed very similar to the first, and all of them were equally as unremarkable in description, and all of them were dropped off like hitchhikers or just walked up from out of town. None if them spoke to each other, or did anything beside queue up and wait. Again, within 10 minutes of the last passenger arriving, a non descript white coach pulled up, loaded the passengers, and left. This happened twice more in the following weeks, with more people showing up each time

My friends and I made wild speculations amongst ourselves as to what was going on. We were young, and had that belief that all 18 year-olds have in their final summer before college; we were invulnerable. Armed with this belief, we agreed that I was going to be the brave hero and get to the bottom of this mystery bus.

7 days later the first of the passengers arrived for the next bus. Showtime.

I grabbed my phone and set it to FaceTime one of my friends from my breast pocket. The volume was silenced for me, but my friends could see and hear everything happening in front of me. I then walked up slowly mimicking the unhurried, yet purposeful pace the passengers usually took. 
"Excuse me, where is this bus headed?" With how nervous I felt, it was a miracle my voice didn't crack.

The passenger ahead of me didn't acknowledge me at all. Turning around, I asked the same question to the passenger that had just queued up behind me. The response was an annoyed and dismissive little shake of the head as if to say,
"Don't ask that question. You know better."

Despite being such a tiny reaction, the effect was devastating. I felt like a kindergarten child who was just scolded by the teacher in front of the class. I turned back and waited for the bus, nervous, anxious, but no longer willing to disturb the other passengers. 

The bus eventually pulled up. It seemed to be a normal, modern, white, coach. Nothing about the bus seemed immediately ominous other than it was perhaps odd that the windshield was tinted dark enough to obscure one's view of the driver. 

We began to file on. Inside was dark as the windows were not tinted as I had assumed, but were completely blacked out. The driver's compartment was also closed off and no light came in from the windshield.
 The only light was from the interior lights that allowed all the passengers to find a seat and sit down. There was no specific order to where people seemed to sit. Just like a normal bus, people sat wherever, unlike a normal bus though, was what people did when they sat down.

Once each person sat down, they retrieved a blindfold from the pocket on the seat ahead of them. On each seat there was a large pair of headphones as well. Each passenger dutifully tied on the blindfold then placed the headphones over their ears. I hadn't yet sat down and seriously considered just exiting the bus as the door wasn't yet closed. It seemed like an open invitation, you can choose to sit down, and join in the sensory deprivation, or simply walk off the bus and leave.

I remembered my phone in my breast pocket, and that my friends were watching all of this live. That confidence that gave me was two fold; I had come too far to chicken out now, and if anything got too wild, they could follow and help me.

I chose an empty row of seats and sat near the aisle. The door closed as soon as I sat. I hadn't even realized yet that I was the last person to do so, but the bus didn't move. I looked around to see what the reason might be for the hold up. The bus normally left fairly quickly after loading it's unusually usual group of passengers. Maybe it was because I wasn't wearing the blindfold or headphones yet. I found my blindfold and tied it lightly around my eyes. To my surprise, it was a very thin fabric and I could see through it quite easily. Odd. It was also made even more odd by the fact that the headphones didn't actually inhibit sounds. The whole facade of sensory deprivation was a tricky bit of theater. As soon as I had put the headphones over my ears, the interior lights shut off, and the bus started it's journey.

Now in total darkness, all I could sense was the deep rumble of the diesel engine and the vibration of the road beneath.  Remembering the phone in my pocket I tilted my head down to whisper to my friends,
" I hope everyone is enjoying this. This is scary as shit. I can't see anything and no one seems to notice I'm not one of them." My whiper was low enough that I could barely hear myself over the engine, but hopefully it was just loud enough to narrate for my friends. The bus drove for some time. I couldn't tell exactly how long in the darkness, maybe 20 minutes, maybe an hour. I could tell that the bus had taken the secondary highway soon after departure, but beyond that I had no clue how far or fast we were traveling.
To keep myself occupied, kept trying to look around for any light whatsoever. Nothing. I also narrated some thoughts to my friends and gave updates when I thought the bus might be slowing or turning. 

Finally the bus slowed more than usual and made definitive left turn. The paved road sounded like it gave way to gravel or dirt. That lasted only a minute or two before the bus came to a complete stop, and turned off.

Nothing happened. Everyone just continued to sit still on the now silent bus. No jostling or stirring of passengers, no snoring or heavy breathing to indicate anyone had fallen asleep. Everyone was just...still.

With some trepidation, I took the phone out of my pocket to use as a flashlight. 
Shit!
There was no signal so I hadn't been on FaceTime. No data either. I had no idea how long I was out of communication, and now had no clue if my friends were still tracking me. Stupid, stupid, stupid. Still, my phone would still function perfectly well as a flashlight in the interim.

With the light on, I removed the blindfold and headphones. I could see everyone sitting patiently, not moving a muscle. Standing up, I stretched my legs a little, cautiously made my way up to the driver's compartment. It was walled off with black plexiglass and gave no clue as to who was driving the bus. In the plexiglass there was a recessed window, but the handle to slide it was apparently on the inside. Turning back I faced one of the seated passengers. I reached out and put my hand on their shoulder,
"Excuse me, I know you can hear me. Can you- "
The passenger curtly pushed my hand off their shoulder and grunted a sound of disapproval, much like you would a stranger's child that was being rude or bothersome. It was enough to stop me and make me step back. Once again I felt the childlike dread of having just been scolded.

I shone my light down to the door of the bus. There was no manual door control visible and no emergency handle either. For the first time, I began to let my mind race with dread about my situation. 
Rude or not, I had to try something. I faced the little recessed window to the driver and tried to see if it was possible to slide from this side. It slid easier than I expected and opened completely. Looking in, I could see the driver, or what I think was meant to represent the driver.

The awkward shadows cast by my phone's light showed what appeared to be a mannequin in the driver's seat. I got my face closer to the window to get a clearer view when the mannequin's head swiveled to face me. The movement was enough to make jump back, but the face was wrong as well. 

The face of the mannequin had semi realistically painted eyes, but the rest of the face gave the impression that a young child was given a make-up kit and told to finish the face. The mouth was down on the chin the nose was off-center, and the shading gave the illusion that the whole head was deformed. The shock of the head moving and the distorted face made me jump backfill across the lap of the nearest passenger into the empty seat beside them. 

In a panic, I pulled off the headphones and blindfold of the passenger, 

" Hey! Hey! Please, help me get off! I need off of this bus!" I shouted, starting to lose control.

The passenger threw their hands over their face and began sobbing. It grew in intensity. Louder and louder, more animated untl the passenger was bawling wildly. Their hands clutched at their head and rubbed their eyes as they continued to bawl. I could finally hear more movement from the rest of the bus as well. More passengers were now removing their own blindfolds and headphones. As they did, they too, began to wail, sob and cry. The bus was soon a deafening cacophony of sobs and wails. I was panicking now trying move myself away from the hysterical passengers. I pushed across the passenger whom I had fallen over, and tried to stand back up next to the driver's door again. In a fit of wailing, the passenger had struck me while trying to clutch at their head.

Instinct took over in that instant and I punched at the passenger, glancing a blow across their brow with my free hand. Immediately the passenger changed from crying and wailing to screaming. As soon as the first passenger began screaming, all others began to scream as well. An emotionless, piercing, ear-splitting blast of sound coming from every direction.

It was as if every passenger had been filled with screams their entire life and it was all being forced out as fast as it could. I was taken by my own screams of terror and disorientation as all around me the passengers lost their minds to the screams.
 I punched my arm into the driver's compartment and began wildly flailing at controls hoping to open the door. My panic and fear were reaching a breaking point at which I thought I might lose a level of sanity I could never recover. 
Finally a small hiss could be heard under the insanity that echoed around the bus, and the door swung open. I jumped at the now open door with only a very dim light shining in. As I jumped I also fell in my mindless bid to escape. When my hands and knees hit the dirt under the bus to signal my body that I was free of the bus, the screaming stopped. Every passenger seemed to finally exhaust their screams at that exact instant.
Silence.
The silence was worse. I Was frantically crawling, trying to get away from the door of the bus  the door that opened onto the insanity of those...passengers. then another hiss.
The door swung shut. The bus now seemed inert. No sounds, no movement. Nothing.

In the instant it took me to scramble away from that bus, it dawned on me that it wasn't the dark of the afternoon, we were in a building. Wide eyed and still breathing deep panicky breaths, I noticed were in a dirt floored barn. Sunlight outlined a door just 20 feet away. I clutched my phone tightly in my hand as I stood and raced to the door. A deep fear boiled in me telling me that the door was locked. Luckily that just a bad thought and the crash bar of the door gave way and flung open the unlocked door.

The light blasted across me, blinding as I burst out of the barn. I was free. Out of the bus, out of the barn, away from the passengers. Away. I saw the driveway the bus had taken to get into the barn and ran back along until I saw the highway. I didn't stop running until I was at the highway, and only then I only slowed to a brisk, worried walk constantly looking back to be sure the barn and the bus it contained stayed where it was and kept itself inert.

I managed to get a weak signal on the phone and called my friends immediately to come find me. I turned right onto the highway and began walking, hoping to see another car or hopefully my friends as I aimed for the town. Aimed for home.
