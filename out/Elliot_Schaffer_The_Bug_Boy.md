I’ll never forget the day he brought a jar of earwigs to show and tell in the second grade. That writhing, black mason jar displayed between LEGO sets and American Girl Dolls was enough to make any child squirm. Hell, it makes my arms itch just writing it.

 This was one example of how strange an individual Elliot Schaffer was. Most people only knew him because of the soft noises he made almost constantly. You couldn’t make it through a whole class period without hearing anything from high whimpers to low, guttural growls emanating from his desk. Assuming he had some kind of mental disorder, most people left him be and did all that they could to stay out of his way.

 Outside of school, every clique has their own tall tale about him. Some cheerleaders swore they saw him snatch a spider off of its web and eat it whole. Some other kids claimed that in 5th grade, he was openly crying during a video about the disappearing honeybee population. 

I personally had only one encounter with him. In seventh grade, I went to the band room one day to ask the director about something. Finding his desk empty, I decided to wait for him in the windowless, cramped hallway leading to his office. I sat down on the dusty tile floor and listened to the quiet ticking of the clock. As I waited, my eyes fell upon the instrument lockers lining the wall opposite the band room doors. A piece of paper caught my attention. from between the bars of one of the trombone lockers, a shiny exoskeleton and wickedly large mandibles jutted out as if trying to escape. It was the most realistic drawing of any beetle I’d ever seen. I hadn’t noticed I’d been walking closer to the locker until the band room doors banged open, causing me to jump almost to the ceiling. I turned, expecting to see the band director. Instead, a hunched figure wearing a glistening black nylon ski jacket bee lined straight towards the locker. Hoping to avoid any interaction, I shuffled back to my original position and avoided making eye contact. I listened to him furiously fumble with the lock for a moment, then snatch up his drawing and slam the locker. I heard his light, quick footsteps make their way back towards the doors, but the sound of the doors opening did not follow them. It was silent, save for the clock and Elliot’s heavy breathing.

 “You know I don’t like bugs.” 

His resonant, nasally voice caught me off guard, and I lowered my eyes to his. Through his thick, matted, greasy hair his amber eyes seemed to almost glow.

 “What?” I managed to croak. 

“I’ve never been interested in insects. Not in the slightest.” Phlegm caught in his throat, and he cleared it a little too loudly. 

“They chose me.” And he was out the door.

 In the fall of my senior year of high school, Elliot Schaffer disappeared. Not even the teachers paid much mind to it at first. His desk sat empty for a couple days, and students began setting their backpacks on it before class. A missing persons report was filed. A search party was dispatched, but nothing came of it. When it came up in conversation, people acted sad and said they wished he would be found soon. It didn’t take a detective to know they were lying, and deep down many people were relieved he was gone. 

That is until he came back.

Our evening band rehearsal had just started, and it was hot on the football field. Not just hot for October. Hot by most summer night standards. That’s one thing I remember. The second thing I remember were the bugs. The night was chokingly humid, and thousands of mosquitoes and midges swarmed around the enormous white floodlights. The lights almost appeared to shift and wriggle, like a pillowcase full of cobras. 

The last thing I remember was the deep, gut-churning feeling that spilled over me when on the track, I saw a figure stumbling towards the trombone section, dressed in dirty blue jeans and a bulky black ski jacket that glistened under the stadium lights. Every other section noticed, and whatever exercise we had been doing abruptly stopped as we watched Elliot set his trombone down in the same place he always did, and shamble out to his place in the block. His section was petrified, as were the rest of us.

 “Water Break!” Our band director’s voice came over the megaphone. His voice cracked on the word “break”. Me and the rest of the drum line huddled close together as we sprinted towards the sideline. We were met with a cacophony of hushed voices all whispering at once. I couldn’t make out a single complete phrase anyone was saying. I overheard Adele, the freshman who stood next to Elliot in the block, sobbing. I could make out the words “...smell…” and “...it was moving!” Between her sharp inhales. I felt as though I might lose my lunch all over the artificial turf. That was when one of the majorettes screamed. The heads of every band member snapped to her, then followed her trembling finger to the 50 yard line. I heard a faint humming sound. 


Elliot lay crumpled on the field, convulsing with his back to us. As he rolled over, I nearly started crying myself. Hundreds, if not thousands of insects were spilling out of his ears, mouth, and eyes, which were now nothing more than black caverns in his sunken, pallid face. mosquitoes swarmed from his neck, where his papery skin had given way. It all happened so quickly. The insects covered his body, pouring over every inch of cloth and skin until only the vague outline of a human was visible. Then all at once, they took wing, forming a black cloud over the stadium before vanishing into the night. Nothing remained on the field. No trace of the Bug Boy. 

They found Elliot’s body three days later, on the bank of a creek in the neighboring town. Cause of death has yet to be determined. I pray for a ruling of accidental drowning, or even foul play. Thinking of any other alternatives makes my skin crawl.
