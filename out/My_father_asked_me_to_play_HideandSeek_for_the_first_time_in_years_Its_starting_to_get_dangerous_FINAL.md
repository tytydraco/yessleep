I dug my heels in, a surge of fight left in me. ***“No—Dad, let me go!”*** I cried, trying to peel his fingers off my arm. He responded by effortlessly scooping me up over his shoulder. I kicked and pounded on his back, but he carried me as if I weighed nothing.

Back inside the house we went, through the back door I’d escaped from. He kicked it shut behind him. The locks clicked once more. My hope of escape extinguished like a candle flame.

He set me down on my feet in the living room, but kept a tight hold of my wrist. I was sobbing openly now, my entire body shaking with adrenaline and exhaustion. He shushed me gently, wiping a tear from my cheek with his free hand. ***“Don’t cry,”*** he murmured. ***“It’s all okay. It’s just a game, remember? Just playing our game.”*** His voice had that sing-song lilt again.

I looked up at him, searching his face for any sign of the dad I knew. ***“Please… please, let’s stop now,”*** I begged softly. ***“We can just sit and talk. I-I won’t tell anyone, I promise. Let’s just stop…”***

He cocked his head, smiling kindly. For one heart-stopping second, I thought I’d gotten through. But then he brought a finger to his lips. ***“Shh. No more talking. Only hiding.”***

Fresh tears spilled as he began pulling me toward the hallway. I dug my heels in again, sobbing, ***“I don’t want to hide, Dad. I don’t want to play anymore!”***

Without warning, he whirled on me, eyes flashing with blind anger. ***“You WILL hide!”*** he snarled, the sudden rage in his voice like a thunderclap. I cowered, stunned. He had never shouted at me like that in my life. He immediately composed himself, smile returning as if nothing happened. But his grip on my wrist tightened until I winced.

In a gentle tone, he continued, ***“You will hide… and I will seek. One last round. And no more running away, okay? If you do, I’ll be very cross.”*** He wagged his finger again, lightly tapping the tip of my nose with it. I flinched.

He then covered his eyes theatrically with both hands and started to count once more: ***“10… 9… 8…”*** His voice echoed down the dark hall.

Numbly, hiccuping back sobs, I realized I had no choice. If I ran or fought, he’d overpower me again easily—and who knows what he’d do. My only hope was to hide, let him *“find”* me, and pray this final round would satisfy whatever bizarre compulsion had overtaken him. Maybe then he’d stop. Maybe then I could reason with him, or escape if he let his guard down.

So I ran. Not out the door, but deeper into the house, to hide. He counted cheerfully behind me.

I dashed into my bedroom and slid under my bed. It was childish, obvious—but my options were limited, and I was running on pure fear. I used to hide here when I broke something. My childhood safe space. I scooted as far against the wall as I could, among some forgotten shoes and dust. Then I forced myself to breathe slowly, quietly. My body ached and my mind was screaming at me that this was a terrible idea, but I didn’t know what else to do.

***“3… 2… 1… ready or not!”*** I heard him call out. His voice had a sing-songy glee again. The final hunt had begun.

••

I squeezed my eyes shut, trying to calm the shaking of my limbs. This has to end, I thought, it has to.

Footsteps padded down the hall like a hungry wolf. Unlike earlier, he wasn’t being stealthy now. He wanted me to hear him coming, to stew in fear. The deliberate steps stopped outside my door.

I heard the door slowly squeak open.

*Silence.*

Then, in the darkness: *tap… tap… tap…* He was knocking lightly on my door, in a mocking, otherworldly rhythm. ***“Honey?”*** he called softly. ***“Are you in heeere?”***

I bit down on my hand to keep from making any noise. Through the bedframe slats, I could see just a sliver of the room, lit faintly by the streetlamp glow through my window. A dark shape crossed the beam of light — he was inside.

I held my breath, not daring to peek properly. The heavy footfalls moved to my closet. I heard the closet door creak open. Hangers clattered as he pushed aside clothes. ***“Not here,”*** he whispered, and I could hear the smile in his voice.

A drawer slid open — he was checking my dresser, absurdly. He was toying with me, searching everywhere except the most obvious place first, drawing it out. I clenched my jaw, body rigid.

The footsteps came closer to the bed. My heart was a jackhammer. I saw his feet appear, inches from where I lay. He crouched down. The bedsprings above me groaned slightly under his weight as he leaned on the mattress. I could make out his face now, upside-down as he peered under, smiling.

Our eyes met. I will never forget that look in his eyes — triumphant, wild, hungry. Like a man possessed.

***“There you are,”*** he sing-songed.

A strangled scream ripped out of me. In a flash, his hands shot under the bed and latched onto my ankles. I was yanked out with astonishing force, nails scraping the floor as I tried to hold on to anything. He dragged me out from under the bed as easily as if I were a doll.

I thrashed, kicking at him, but he didn’t let go. One of my kicks caught him in the chin, and his head snapped back. For a brief moment I thought I might have hurt him, but he only laughed — a short, giddy sound — and tightened his grip painfully.

***“No more cheating,”*** he hissed, pulling me fully into his grasp. He wrapped his arms around me from behind, pinning my arms to my sides. I screamed and bucked, but it was like struggling against iron.

He hauled me backward, out of my bedroom. I was off the ground, feet flailing uselessly. He was carrying me down the hall, toward the living room again. I could see the front door directly ahead, still locked and bolted. My vision blurred with tears and dizziness.

***“Shh, shh, shh,”*** Dad murmured in my ear as I writhed. ***“It’s over. Game over.”*** There was a strange relief in his voice.

We reached the living room. He let go of me, and I collapsed onto the carpet, scrambling away from him on all fours. He didn’t chase this time. He just stood there, breathing hard, watching me with that detached curiosity.

I backed myself into the far corner of the living room, near the fireplace. There was nowhere left to run. I was trapped. My whole body quaked and my breath came in ragged sobs. Dad loomed a few feet away, turning his back to the doorway. Just… watching.

***“It’s over,”*** he repeated softly to the empty doorframe. He turned and took a single step toward me. In his hand, I now noticed, he held something shiny — *the fireplace poker.* I hadn’t seen him grab it, but he must have as we entered the room. He dragged it lightly on the floor beside him, almost casually.

••

I pressed myself tighter into the corner, my hands up defensively. ***“Dad… please…”*** I croaked, exhausted and terrified.

He lifted the poker, twirling it in a showy way. ***“You know,”*** he said conversationally, ***“when you were little, you used to hide in this spot all the time.”*** He pointed the iron poker right at the corner where I huddled. ***“My little girl, curled up like a kitten by the fireplace. So predictable.”*** He tsked, shaking his head with a smile. ***“And here you are again. I used to pretend you disappeared when you hid here. That maybe the house took you.””***

I had nowhere to go. He stood between me and any exit, and I was too weak to fight anymore. My eyes darted around for something — *anything* — I could use as a weapon, but he was already raising the poker high.

I closed my eyes, a whimper escaping.

There was a sudden loud BANG on the front door.

Both of us startled. Dad’s head snapped toward the door, poker still raised. Another bang, then a voice: ***“Police! Is everything okay in there?”***

Through my haze of fear, I realized the neighbor had called the cops after all. That single scream and porch light must have spurred them to call.

I mustered every bit of strength and screamed, ***“HELP! I’m in here! Help me!”***

Dad’s face contorted with rage. He lunged toward me, but then— ***CRASH!*** The front door burst open, splintering as two officers rammed through it. Light from their flashlights sliced into the living room.

***“Drop it! Drop the weapon!”*** one officer shouted, gun drawn.

Dad turned to them slowly, *calculated*, the poker still in his hand. For a terrifying second, I thought he might charge them. He took one unsteady step forward, raising the iron bar. The officers yelled again, ***“Drop it now!”***

He halted, looking from them to the poker as if confused how it got in his hand. Then the metal clang echoed as he let it fall to the floor.

They rushed him. Dad didn’t resist. He just sank to his knees, laughing softly as they forced his arms behind his back. ***“Just playing a game,”*** he murmured to no one in particular, as they pinned him down and cuffed him. ***“They wanted to just play a little game…”***

••

One officer quickly moved to me, wrapping a blanket (from where, I don’t even know) around my shaking form and guiding me out of the corner. I collapsed into sobs, trying to explain in broken gasps what happened, but she gently shushed me. ***“It’s okay now. You’re safe,”*** she said. Those words unleashed a flood of relief-tears that I thought might never stop.

As they led my father away, he turned his head to look at me one last time. His eyes were clear. His face was streaked with tears. In a small, broken voice, he said, ***“I’m sorry, baby. It wouldn’t stop counting down. It wou…”*** And then he was gone, guided out into the flashing red-and-blue lights beyond the busted door.

That was three days ago. 

I’m staying with an aunt now, and I haven’t slept since. My dad is in a psychiatric hospital for evaluation. They think he had some kind of psychotic break. They’ve found no drugs in his system, no obvious cause. When I visited *(accompanied by two orderlies and my aunt)*, he looked at me with hollow eyes and said he doesn’t remember much of that night. Just bits and pieces of a *“bad dream”* where he was chasing a shadow that had stolen his little girl. The doctors think he was acting out some kind of delusion. I don’t know.

Part of me wonders if something else was in the house with us, something that used my dad to get to me. I know that sounds crazy… but I watched my dad change into someone — *something* — else over those days. And I can’t explain it.

They tell me he’s responding well to medication, that he might be able to come home in a few weeks once he’s stable. I want to believe that. I want my dad back. But I’m also terrified. Every time I close my eyes, I see his face inches from mine in the dark, hear that gleeful whisper: “Found you.”

What if he’s never truly *“back”*? What if that part of him comes out again?

I don’t think I could ever play hide-and-seek again. Not with him. Not with anyone.

***I’ll never feel safe hiding.***
