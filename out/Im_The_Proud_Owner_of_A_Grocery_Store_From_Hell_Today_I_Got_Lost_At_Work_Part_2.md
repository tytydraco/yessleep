I began remodeling Pop’s Grocery the very next day. Maybe it was foolish to hope that whatever haunted the store I’d bought could be exorcized by a few coats of fresh paint, but I had to start somewhere. Besides, in the back of my mind, I still secretly hoped that there might be a logical explanation for what I’d experienced. My wife theorized that what had happened to me was a hallucination caused by stress–and there was definitely enough of that to go around. 

Steve Kelch had claimed that nothing in Pop’s Grocery had been updated since Reagan was president–and he hadn’t been exaggerating.

The first thing I wanted to replace were the ancient fluorescent lights, which (as I’d already experienced) would flicker and go out unexpectedly. The PA system was a close second.  

I’d already had two electricians take a look at it, but neither could explain the unnerving, metallic groans that sometimes emanated from the speakers, or the way they seemed to pick up other frequencies…like the screaming man.

“Russell Hughes, 315-45-17!” the frantic voice would boom, warbled and chopped with static. “This is Russell Hughes, 315-45-17! If anyone can hear this, send help! Russell Hugh…” Sooner or later, the man’s plea disappeared, swallowed up by shopping muzak. 

At first, I thought it was just the staff playing a strange prank. The third time it happened, I called a meeting in the break room and told the seven employees on duty that we needed to talk about the noises coming from the PA system. When I did, every face went pale. Erica Hawkins, a skinny redheaded teenager who’d only been at Pop’s Grocery for two months, immediately raised her hand to speak. 

Erica said that she’d been opening the store one morning when she’d heard a female voice humming softly from the speaker above her. Erica recognized the tune: it was a song her mother, Tanya, had hummed to her when she was a baby–

And Tanya Hawkins had been dead for years. 

Unnerved, Erica had hurried to the other side of the store…but the humming followed. It went from speaker to speaker, getting louder and more aggressive until Erica was curled up beside the ice chest with her hands pressed over her ears, sobbing. When her co-workers shook her and asked what was wrong, none of them could hear a thing. Seconds later, the humming ended as mysteriously as it had begun. Erica had taken her fifteen-minute break, chugged an iced frappuccino, and went back to work as though nothing had happened. 

When Erica finished her story, the break room was so quiet I could hear my own heartbeat thundering in my ears. I looked nervously from face to face.

“Has anyone else experienced anything…unusual…while working here?” I asked. “It’s okay–just raise your hand.” All seven employees looked at one another, then lifted their hands slowly into the air. I blinked. “Well, I just want you all to know that I’m going to look into it.” 

No response. Irene coughed.

“Are we done here? I could use a smoke…” 

I broke up the meeting and hurried back to the Manager’s Office. Like the break room, it was an insult to interior designers everywhere: gray-green carpet, hideous yellow walls, and three generations of chipped fake-wood furniture. I tried to place a call to the previous owner, but Steve Kelch wasn’t available for comment. Apparently, he’d followed through with his plan to sell everything and move to Florida, without leaving any forwarding address. 

Steve Kelch’s voicemail wasn’t set up, either. As I listened to the dial tone, I drummed my fingers irritably against the desk–and noticed something odd. The manager’s desk sounded almost…hollow. I ran my thumb along the edge until I felt a click. A latch released and the top of the desk lifted upward, revealing a pile of yellowed papers. Most of them were business documents, but at the bottom of the pile I found a handwritten list going back all the way to when Pop’s Grocery first opened in the sixties. It was a list of names and dates.

There was Frank Kelch, the first owner of Pop’s, who’d died of a heart attack while opening the store. There was Russell Hughes, the mysterious voice in the PA system. 

Then I saw a third name that made my blood run cold: Edgar Lee,. My grandfather!

I’d been told that he’d gone missing while on a fishing trip in 2005…so what was his name doing on a weird list hidden in the Manager’s Office of Pop’s Grocery? 

He wasn’t the only one who’d run into bad luck, either: a quick online search revealed that every one of the eleven individuals on the list were either missing or dead. A chill ran through me. 

Just what kind of “list” was I looking at here? 

Suddenly, I heard a creaking sound overhead. The ceiling tiles above me had warped and bent…like something heavy was crawling right above me. I looked up and realized that the door to the manager’s office had shut…even though I couldn’t remember closing it myself. I felt as chill as I remembered Irene’s warning:

“It’s not a good idea to be all alone in a big store like this. You never know what might happen…” 

Something that might have been drool dribbled onto my shoulder from the black gap between the sagging tiles. I grabbed the strange list, sprang out of my chair, and bolted for the door. Dust rained down as the thing in the ceiling gave chase. I burst out of my office and into…

My office. Again.

The ugly yellow paint and fake-wood furniture were identical to the room I’d just left, only this time, there were four doors instead of one. I couldn’t help but wonder where they led…and what might be waiting for me on the other side. 

A sudden SLAM knocked my hand off of the doorknob; the wood behind me splintered. Something was trying to knock down the door! I went into the room on the left, and wasn’t surprised that it was yet another version of my office, again. No matter how many doors I opened, the result was always the same.

Twelve rooms later, the noises behind me had gone quiet. I pressed my ear against the cool wood of the door. Maybe whatever was chasing me had given up…or was it just sneaking up on me from a different direction?

 I could see it as clearly as one of my childhood night terrors: the door across from me would creak open theatrically, revealing only blackness. A grinning, red-eyed thing would walk out of those shadows. It would take its time, enjoying this, knowing that I had nowhere to run. It would pull me apart and devour me right there on the pea-green carpet, and that would be the last anyone would hear of the out-of-towner who tried to save Pop’s Grocery. 

The room spun. I leaned back against the wall, trying to get control of myself, and felt something odd: someone had strung a fishing line along it! 

The wire led to the door on the left and continued on the other side. I followed it left, then right, then right again. As I did, I noticed how large, sinister “X’s” had been carved into several doors.  Even more disturbingly, a few had been barricaded shut with furniture. I kept following the fishing wire: it occurred to me that it might be a trap, but what choice did I have? Continue wandering through those hideous offices until I died of dehydration or the thing in the ceiling finally caught me?

Finally, I staggered into a room whose walls were splattered with gore. The fishing line dragged loosely along the floor, as though whoever had been placing it had been injured–perhaps fatally. Their bloody trail through the middle door.

The corpse in the next room was so fresh that the man could have been killed just seconds ago–but his outfit was from another era. He wore bell-bottom jeans, a striped shirt with a wide, open collar, and a shag hairdo that was sticky with blood. His eyes, ears, nose, and tongue were missing.

The fishing wire that I’d been following through those nightmarish rooms ended in his right hand, and his left arm was reaching toward the door across the room. 

I had just stooped down to inspect the body when I heard a familiar creaking in the ceiling.

I didn’t think twice. I fled through the door the dead man was pointing to–

And found myself back in the version of the Manager’s Office I recognized. 

Here the only door was the one I’d just walked through, and when I opened it for a second time, I was back in Pop’s Grocery. The mutilated corpse and infinite rooms were gone…but the weird list was still in my hand. I asked Irene to cover for me and headed for the sheriff’s office.
