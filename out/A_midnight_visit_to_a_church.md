I sat in the mud and leaves, trying to see if anyone was around. My head, being pulled into a hundred different directions by invasive thoughts, every bird call, every car passing, a cop about to see me, I couldn't focus. The growl of my stomach centers me slightly. I take a glance at the building in front of my hiding spot. 

Its massive marble framed door shone as a beacon. I had to get inside. I had broken into so many houses and stores and malls in the past, been doing this same routine for so long, this would be just another building, just another hit. A passing car causes me to duck further into my hiding spot.

Bramble and thorns smacked my nose and got caught in my hair. I didn't know if I was bleeding, I didn't have a mirror to check. I am so hungry and cold and tired of being dirty. The money in there could pay for a hotel for a night, a heated room, a bed, a shower. 

I need to focus. 

It's darkest now, the moon is covered by a cloud and there are no cars or people or eyes, I need to go. Now. I move across the parking lot, it's a lot further than I assumed from my hiding spot but I clear the gap regardless. Once at the doors I look up. The steeple hangs over me like an executioner's axe. 

Its mossy stone tiled roof looks ancient, the whole building an ancient being with a parking lot and a city built up around it. I focus. The door. I don't know if it is open, I assume it is but the thought of it being locked shoots into me. 

What then? 

Do I just run? 

Find another way in? 

What if there are cameras or an alarm and I am about to be arrested again and I just can't... the door opens.

The door opens and I follow her inside. The heat of the day finally relents as I am met by the cold embrace of the air conditioning. I see old women wearing pullovers and cardigans and I see men, their brows free of sweat. I see those same women appear shocked at my appearance, those same men’s brows furrow and study me. 

She tells me to pay them no mind, that the Lord sees us all the same. But these people, they are not the Lord, I think, no they are people who are horrified by my presence, a rat in their pantry, a snake in their garden. Sister assures me that they can get me cleaned up here, they can help me, I’m no junky, she sees that, I’m no drunk, she sees that. I’m just… 

I lose track of her soothing words as another siren’s song pierces the fog. 

We pass it for but a moment, and nobody pays it any mind. A simple glass box, and within holds my future. I lose the sister, I lose the gaze of the parishioners, I lose sight of the church as I flee back into the inferno. I do not deserve redemption, because the thing on the other side of redemption is not me.

I head inside. It's dark in the narthex. I see some, but not much. Statues of saints and the Virgin, paintings, bronze candelabras, I think they are called candelabras, it was a long time since I went to Mass and they never taught me the name of the candle holders. 

I focus.

I focus. 

There, before the door leading to the nave is the prize. The donation box. Given by the parishioners to benefit a worthy cause. I determined a while ago that that worthy cause was me. In my hand I held the key to this box, a smooth stone from the parking lot. It's not like I'm letting these people's money go to waste. They gave it to the needy, and I am that. 

Before I enter I look around the narthex again. The saints glare at me with contempt. The Virgin looks as though she will rip me apart in hell. The statues are held to place by their pedestals and if I enter I only need to stray slightly off course for one to grasp me and sink their fangs into me and drain my blood. 

I focus. 

I enter, the door closes behind me, and I am in darkness. It's cool here. Cold. Not uncomfortable, but noticeable. I cannot see the statues, the candelabras, or the donations box, but I know where it is. I move slowly, my bare feet touching the cold granite floor then the carpet. It's soft. It feels like it could be warm if I just gave it some time. 

I keep moving, my hand outstretched and in a few steps my fingers reach my prize. I huddle myself around it. I cannot see the money within but I know it is there and I feel as though I finally have control over my life. I think I might cry. It's ok, I need to focus. I lift the rock up and I pause. 

Am I about to do this? 

Rob a church? Is this truly what I want? 

The last few years have been nothing but hills and troughs, mild highs and terrible lows, never getting ahead and now here I was about to take money from a church. I focus. 

I need to focus. 

I feel a tear in my eye but I squint it away as I swing my rock into the glass box. Silence. The rock connected with the glass, I felt it, but what happened? I focus? I drop the rock. Not a sound. I cough, it might have been a sob. Nothing. 

I am about to speak when a brilliant light ignites the room. The light hurts my eyes as I am sent tumbling backward. Crawling back I turn to get up but stumble, I crash into the statue of the Virgin and when my hand touches her face it runs with blood. 

I recoil as hot blood flows from her eyes and I suddenly can't feel my legs. I try to look down but I can't. I can't move. I can't move I can't move and I can't focus. The light grows brighter and now there is a scent of flowers and rain but it isn't pleasant. It's overwhelming, I want to vomit but I can't. 

I can't move. I start to turn around but I don't feel it and I can't stop it. What am I facing? I am forced to my knees but I don't know why and I see my arms lifting from my sides to extend before me, my hands drenched in the blood of the Virgin. 

I want to cry. No tears come. I am facing the shattered box, my last act of free will, and there it glows with an intensity that fills my body with fear. My brain races, trying to figure out how to get out of this but then suddenly that voice is silenced. My soul is subdued. I hear a voice.

*Be not afraid, for I am Gabriel. You will be witness to the coming of Christ, and you will act as His soldier.*

The voice is not soothing and it does not bring me peace, but it is not a suggestion. It is not a task. It is a law. It is as fact as my need to breathe. I cannot deny, not because denial is not an option but because I simply cannot deny. The light is gone. The scent dissipated. The blood on my hands is dry. 

The voice of Heaven has spoken. My life before no longer exists. Because when the voice of Heaven speaks, the world changes to match what it says. It is never wrong. It is. When Heaven speaks, it is never a whisper.
