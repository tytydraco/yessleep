We ran on for what felt like an eternity, until we couldn't move anymore, I had barely kept my eyes on George and Kasey had gone so far ahead that I didn't see her. Hopefully, she managed to make it this far and not run into anything else. After running to the point where it felt like my heart would explode, I saw George trip and fall down. He started sobbing and I knew now his mind was finally catching up to the horrible reality, if you can even call it that, of the situation.



“We are all going to die, we are all going to die! They're monsters, fucking monsters!” He was ranting and holding his head in his hands.



I decided to do what a person in movies or TV does when dealing with a hysterical person, I slapped him in the face.



“Look George!” I pointed back, there are no monsters following us, Joanna led them away at the cost of her own life, you are not going to waste that sacrifice and neither am I.”



I started to feel my own emotions welling up again, but I needed to stay strong to convey the message.



“Kasey is somewhere ahead; we need to find her and get out of here first and then try and find Mark and Rachel and I can’t do it alone; I need your help alright?” I put a hand on his shoulder and tried to reassure him.



“All...alright.” He managed to sniffle out and after a moment the trickle of lucidity began, and I saw the gears in his brain turning again.



“I am sorry Nick; shock is a terrible thing and I guess it can render the smartest of us helpless prey if we let it overwhelm us. I won’t let it happen again, let's go find Kasey.”



A determined look replaced the terrified visage from moments before and I believed what he said. We moved on further to look for Kasey.



We stumbled through the forest for another hour, afraid to call out too loudly in case something else heard us and found out where we were. We mostly looked and saw with sinking dread the slow descent of the sun on the horizon, it would be dark soon and we had no light. Our gear was dropped back where the monsters attacked us from the trees. George had said he was confident he would be able to make a homemade torch from materials nearby. I hoped it wouldn't come to that but if we had anything it would be better than being stuck in the dark.



As we moved on, we found we had gotten turned around and somehow made it back near the trail leading up the mountain. I didn't know how it was possible, I thought we were leaving back in the other direction before. Suddenly we heard a familiar voice.



“Please help! Jo, Nick, George! Someone, anybody help!”



It was Kasey’s voice. We ran in the direction we had heard the voice, and we found a small alcove like the mouth of a cave and saw Kasey sitting down on a raised stone platform in the cave. She was holding her foot, she might have twisted or broken her ankle somehow in her retreat. She saw us and almost screamed for joy.



“Oh my God finally, help my ankle I think it's sprained I need help out of here before the things back there catch us.”



We immediately moved into the cave to help her but were stopped suddenly as we moved in, and our legs were immobilized before we had stepped more than two feet into the cave.



“What the hell?” I shouted almost in tandem with George who had yelled the same thing with additional expletives.



I looked down and noticed a fine thread had enveloped our legs and as we tried to move it seemed to tighten and bind our lower bodies, spreading up to our knees. As we struggled to break free a miasma of thick foul-smelling vapor blew into the cave from outside. It was so horrible I tried to hold my breath against the olfactory assault but had to breathe eventually as I struggled with the binding on my feet. The vapor was noxious and burned my lungs and I hoped it was not poisonous.



George was not so lucky and after inhaling a portion of the fetid fog he threw up first on the floor and then he fell over and threw up on himself, managing to roll over but unable to stand due to the tightening strands on his legs.



I managed to pull my shirt in front of my face to form a makeshift mask against the horrible air and pull the small pocketknife I carried out and I set to work cutting the strange threads from my feet.



It was odd, it was very fine thread and almost seemed like some sort of large-scale spider web, but it was not possible for even the largest spiders I knew of to produce a tripwire web that could snare humans like this, it had to be artificial, at least I hoped it was.



I managed to free myself and bent down to get to work freeing George from his binding when I heard a low rumbling sound and the disturbing rhythmic pattern of movement, it sounded like many feet moving or scurrying, like a horde of rats. No, not rats something larger. I was frantically sawing at the thread but because he fell down, George was bound in the sticky webbing all over and was practically stuck to the floor. He finally heard the thrumming footsteps as well and mumbled something inaudible in between gagging.



As we struggled on the floor, I finally freed George and helped him up. I almost fell back in disbelief when we heard cruel laughter and saw something horrible. Ah voice spoke in the shifting haze of vapor,



“Oh my, look who has fallen into my little old web. You boys really will do anything for a damsel in distress.” Kasey was no longer there and a woman we recognized as ranger Jessica stood in her place. She was dressed in a strange robe with odd symbols on it and she held out her hands and smiled as we writhed on the ground.



Another figure in a black robe emerged near the stone circle. The figure raised its head, and I could not make out its eyes, but I saw pale almost emaciated skin and jagged yellow teeth glinting in the dim light of the cave. To our surprise this figure spoke but the words were not in English. It sounded like Latin or some older language perhaps, it said,



“Vivunt. Gravissimae, affer ad me.” Then the figure pointed at us and the rush of footsteps finally stopped. Jessica nodded to the hooded figure and said,



“It will be done.” She turned to us and gave another laugh and said in a mocking tone, “I hope you boys don’t have arachnophobia.” She made odd gestures with her hands that caused a strange shimmer in the air. Then there was a palpable sense that something had just happened, but we didn't know what until I heard a strangled gasp from George and knew he saw something behind us near the mouth of the cave. I did not want to take my eyes off the figure, but I knew there was likely a new threat in the cave. Against my better judgment I slowly turned around, and my heart caught in my throat.



The thing couldn't be real, and I pressed my hands against my eyes and blinked hard to make sure I was really seeing what I was seeing. What it was, was a monstrous, bloated shadow with a horrifying spider-like outline standing before us. It was looming high enough to reach the ceiling of the cave at around eight or nine feet tall. It had large urticating hairs like that of a tarantula, but the thing was not any true genus of spider I knew since despite the obviously impossible size, the head where the eyes, mouth, and fangs would normally be had a single burning eyeball and a large maw containing rows of serrated teeth like that of a shark.



The sheer impossibility and horror of the sight almost drove me insane, and I fell back from the sight as if literally struck, landing hard on my side but never taking my eyes off the impossible sight before me. After an awful pause, it exploded into motion, before I could process my thoughts on what to do it had George and was enveloping him in fresh webbing.



Faced with the second nightmare in one day, I did not freeze in shock for as long and promptly wheeled around and tried to leap after the figure in the robe in hopes that if it had some control over the horrible creature, it might not risk hurting its master. As I jumped up to try and reach the robed figure and Jessica. I thought maybe if I could stop them this thing would vanish. I fell back in horror as a sentient wall of smaller spiders formed between us and the hooded figure. The figure muttered something inaudible and to my disbelief it had vanished in the blink of an eye, along with Jessica.



“What the fuck is going on?!” I screamed aloud.



The living carpet of smaller spiders had vanished but as I turned around to my horror, I soon noticed the giant arachnid remained. George was a heaped bundle of webbing at that moment, and I was unarmed. I knew I would likely die but I was determined to not be an easy target. I grabbed several jagged rocks from the stone circle and readied them in a madness-fueled last stand.



The spider reared back as if to lunge but then stopped and drummed its front legs as if sensing something. I heard an odd clicking and then something like the striking of a lighter and suddenly the dim cave came alive with a wash of orange flame that engulfed the spider and sent it flailing its limbs and crashing into the walls. I tried to evade but was struck by one of the limbs and crashed hard into the cave wall but suffered no serious injury.



The blasphemy against nature died shriveling into a clump of burning foul-smelling embers after what felt like several minutes of horrible immolation. Dazed, injured, horrified, and confused I looked on to see what the hell had just happened. I heard footsteps and my heart leaped when I saw a familiar form entering the cave.



It was Joanna, she was covered in blood and her clothes were torn to pieces, a large strip of cloth was covering her right eye like an eye patch and she was holding some sort of makeshift lighter/hairspray flamethrower. I couldn't believe my eyes.



“Jo....Joanna, is that really you?” I asked aloud, not believing my eyes.



She stepped forward and managed to shake the stoic look of desperate resolve in the face of overwhelming horror long enough to give me a familiar smile.



“Hey Nick, couldn't stay out of trouble while I was gone eh?” I tripped over myself and rushed to her grabbed her in a bear hug and promptly began crying I was so relieved. She winced and I loosened up a bit.



“Sorry Nick, think I may have some broken ribs so hugs will have to wait.” She laughed and a pained wheeze came out. Come on, let's check on George.



I was so excited to see Jo I felt guilty for forgetting George, webbed up like a giant fly.



We started cutting through the thick webbing and managed to free him. He was not breathing and I started to panic again. After a terrible moment of fear and CPR attempts, he sprang to life and began hacking and coughing and gasping for air.



“Oh, thank God you’re alive.” I said as I tried to help George to his feet.



“What happened? I had a horrible dream I was ensnared by a giant spider.” George said clutching his head and continuing to cough.



“Yeah sounds like a bad dream for sure," I said, not wanting to explain the reality of the situation to him and burst the comforting bubble of sanity he constructed for himself in this pandemonium of madness we found ourselves in.



We exited the cave and to our misfortune we realized it was starting to get dark.



“What do we do?” I asked Joanna, hoping she had some idea.



“The camping supplies are not far, we can try to hide a tent in the outcropping of the mountain. The forest itself might not be safe, there might be more of those things out there.” She winced as she said it and I figured she was referring to what had attacked her earlier.



“Look, you guys.” She asserted with abnormal fear plain on her face.



“We know we need to get out of these woods, there's some strange force keeping us here. We cannot escape just by running and I fear that we are being hunted not just for these psychopaths in the robes to kill us, but to take us alive for something worse.”



George and I both gulped as we considered the implication of our three missing friends and how George and I likely would have been the fourth and fifth.



“I don't know why they want us or why no one else seems to be able to enter this part of the forest to help, but we have to assume we are on our own. The creatures they control are horrible, but they are not invincible and the people who control them are at the end of the day just human as well. If we can find their camp or base of operations, we can try to sneak in save our friends and maybe kill as many of these fuckers as we can along the way.” There was a gleam of righteous anger in her remaining eye that despite the insanity of her plan had to my surprise, genuinely inspired.



George didn't speak, I knew he was doubtful of the plan but didn't want to contradict his rescuer.



“Come on then let's go, we can try and find a safe place and get some small bit of rest then we press on. We have to at least try, Rachel, Mark, and Kasey could still be alive. Come on!” She said as she led us further into the darkening gloom of the forest to an uncertain fate.



Surprisingly we had managed to find a tent and some provisions and took them up to a small alcove under an outcropping on the hillside of the mountain. We rested in shifts and only took a few hours of total rest. There was no attack mercifully, since we all suspected there would be. We packed up and pressed on.



As we walked, I was struck by how incredible it was that Joanna was still alive.



“How did you survive back there?” I asked her rather bluntly with amazement still in my eyes.



“You don't want to know, I would like to say I gave as good as I got but that might be a lie.” She laughed and raised the bloody cloth on her face to reveal the ruin of her right eye. It was terrible and I winced both at the terror of the injury and the implication that such a thing had happened to my best friend.



“I am sorry I didn't stay,” I said sullenly.



“Don't be, I wouldn't have let you. I barely got away, those fuckers were fast, and you have never been as fast as me.” She said winking and nudging me on the shoulder.



“Come on let's go we have a long hike to reach the top”.



We trudged on up the mountain with a chill breeze at our back. After a while we reached a summit that had an odd series of standing stones circled around a small body of water. It was too small to call a lake but too large to call a pond. We did not know how such a large body of water was up on the mountain, we hadn't seen anything about it in the guides, though I guess considering all the insane things we saw the guide was sort of useless now.



We saw more of the robbed figures near the stones, and we moved forward as carefully as we could. Joanna had her knife in hand and was stalking ahead trying to get behind one of the stones and get to the source of this madness, or at least what we presumed it to be. The large group of assembled people, or revelers, or druids, or cultists, were here. Whatever they really were it didn't matter they had abducted our friends and clearly, this was some sort of bizarre ritual involving them.



As we inched closer and listened, I heard several mentions of a word ˈbelˌtān or Beltane. George mentioned that, "May Eve was also known as Beltane, the day was a pagan holiday and one of the eight Sabbats. It was also regarded as Walpurgis night and occurred opposite its other more famous Sabbat day of Hallows Eve." The sudden realization of the current date at that point struck me like a blow. It was April 30th, May eve that very night. The mention of a gathering that the rangers had told us about, made me realize that these monstrous cultists were the other celebrants and the invitation was no coincidence after all.



A new figure emerged from behind one of the stones, they wore a large ornamental headpiece and seemed to hold a position of authority over the throng of fanatics. The figure addressed the crowd and made odd gestures with its hand and then to our horror it pointed directly at where we were hiding, it knew we were there. The leader figure spoke with a booming voice that reverberated through the channels and ravines of the mountain.



“Subditi, vae victis!” They said while turning to the body of water and casting a handful of brightly colored dust into it.



“Oh shit, what is it this time?” George said aloud as if reading my thoughts as well.



Joanna’s knuckles turned white gripping her knife and I could see she meant to throw herself at the lead figure in the next moment.



We looked on as the figure was suddenly flanked by two then four then six then twelve other people. They all began chanting and a stone dais began to emerge from the center of the body of water.



Three of the robbed figures were pulling large burlap sacks that writhed as if......as if people were alive and thrashing around inside. Then my fears were confirmed as they removed them from the bags and we saw the bound and prone forms of Mark, Rachel, and Kasey. They were stripped down and had their hands and feet tied and were gagged as well.



I looked around to see what possible hope there could be, but I saw the multitude of hooded figures all chanting and circling us, and the terrible scene was highlighted by the shine of a waning gibbous moon.



George pulled out a tent stake he had on his belt and attempted to charge the person closest to him. There was a loud splashing and rippling in the water and we heard pounding footsteps on the ground near the water. Its source was not seen but suddenly just as George attempted to stab one of the chanting maniacs, he was drawn up into the air by some invisible force and his body was engulfed in gravity-defying water.



I couldn't believe what I was seeing, and I reached out and screamed for them to let him go.



“What do you people want from us!?” I yelled to the mass of celebrants but no one paid any heed to my words. I couldn't see Joanna, but I saw George's limp form slowly placed on the dais in the middle of the water by the same invisible force that had knocked him out.



I was panicked and awestruck by the sheer nightmare lunacy of the situation and only my imminent peril roused my mind into conscious proactive action. I saw the figures converging on me now. Three celebrants holding rope and weapons were closing in on me. I was unarmed but I ran forward and hurdled myself into my would-be attacker and managed to knock them to the ground.



I proceeded to smash my fists into the attacker's face and the effort caused their hood to come off and I was not prepared for what I saw. It was a sickly pale, almost albino man. His eyes looked like two giant cataracts yet somehow, he could see and his other senses seemed not active at all beyond whatever instructions he was given by the leader. The man seemed like an empty shell. After the disturbing revelation, my shoulders were seized by the other two attackers who bore down on me and tried to bind my arms. They almost succeeded but again for the third time in that horrible nightmare, Joanna saved my life. She lunged forward and proceeded to slash the throat out of one of my attackers.



There was a jet of arterial blood and the figure fell to one knee, not grasping at the free-flowing wound on their neck but merely kneeling down as if politely acknowledging their own impending death by blood loss.



The chanting was growing louder, and Joanna screamed in rage as she killed the other figure a pallid woman by the looks of it, who just like the man gave little protest to their own violent death. The leader, apparently aware that we actually posed a threat, drew up to the water's edge and produced another handful of that strange dust, but Joanna was quicker, she threw her knife, and it found its mark. The leader dropped the dust and regarded the knife in its arm. It backed up a step and pointed to Joanna.



"Mors huic uni.” The leader shouted a furious-sounding direction and the formerly dispassionate celebrants went into a frenzy of aggression and began assaulting Joanna and beating her to the ground punching kicking and stomping. She threw several of them off but was already badly hurt and couldn't hold them off forever. I saw the scene and ran as fast as I could to intervene. I got there and kicked two of them off her, but I was tackled to the ground and punches and kicks started falling on me. I thought we would be beaten to death, but I saw an odd thing as I lay on my back being pummeled mercilessly. It was a large, unsettled pile of that odd-colored dust resting on the ground. I reached for it and grabbed the handful, then in a half-baked plan I forced my body to move under the weight of assault and threw the dust into the edge of the water. There was a terrible crashing noise from beneath the water and the fanatics stopped briefly looking out to the water. I quickly pointed at the lunatics who had been assaulting Joanna and shouted.



“Subditi, vae victis!” The leader flinched back, and I looked on in horror and amazement when the bodies of the fanatics around Joanna and I were wrenched up and off the ground and moved into the water. Several of them seemed to escape but after they had been elevated up into the air they fell landing horribly and, in a few cases, audibly breaking limbs, backs, or in one case a neck.



I fell down near Joanna, she was badly beaten and bleeding all over, but she was still breathing. I knew I couldn't move her so I held her hand and prepared to face our fate but as I looked up I saw the leader make a sign with their hands and the celebrants started vanishing, then the water started vanishing, then to my horror the dais with the prone forms of our friends on it still, then finally the leader of the loathsome cultists.



We were alone on a mountaintop covered with our own blood and that of the maniacs who had attacked us, our friends were gone and we were alone, alive but alone.



It has been over a year since it happened, I have tried to write an account of it before, but could never summon the courage. Yet now I feel I must because others need to know the dangers that lie in the hidden shadows of Mount Deception.



Joanna survived and we were rescued by a park ranger who oddly knew nothing of the madness that had occurred there. He simply stated that he found an abandoned campground in the park and a trail leading up the mountain and found us both there bloodied and broken but not dead. We were in such bad shape Joanna had to be airlifted to the hospital. Out of fear and paranoia I asked him if he was working with any of the park rangers here named Kyle or Jessica. He had said that no one was currently posted there by those names and that the station had been closed down for over a year.



While recovering we talked a lot about what happened to us, we could not believe the insanity of what had occurred and we spared the most unbelievable details from our stories to the authorities. Those same authorities believed that our friends got lost and since their bodies were never recovered a more declarative statement would not be made yet. They stressed that unfortunately when people went missing in the wilderness recovery was very unlikely after a certain point. They said it can happen to the most experienced of campers, but they don't know the truth, they don't know what we know. Though what did we really know? We had no idea where they had gone or the deranged celebrants for that matter. We had no idea if they were still alive or if they had been sacrificed to some unearthly force.



After months of recovery and emotional turmoil Joanna made a decision. I begged her not to go, but Joanna is going back, she is going back to that hellish mountain. Over a year from the date to try and find those demonic fanatics, their leader, and more importantly our friends if they still live. I don't think I have the courage to go with her but I can't let her go alone. She just keeps insisting she needs to try.



In the end, I know I will not let her go alone, I can't convince her to stay, so I have accepted the fact that I must go with her. The idea of returning is almost more than I can bear. Returning to those nightmarish woods and the impossible mountain.



I will do it though, I have to do it, for her, for them, and maybe for myself as well, if only just to prove that I can.



Maybe we can save them, or maybe they are lost forever, there is only one way to know for sure, even if it costs us everything we have left.



So, I must leave this account of what happened before so that if something happens again there will be a record. But in the meantime, whether we return or not please do not go near Mount Deception on Walpurgis night, they could still be there........
