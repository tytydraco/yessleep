When you go to sleep do you see movement with your eyes closed just before you go to sleep?
For Us it's mostly waves. We have seen the waves every night for as long as We can remember.

Last Friday night, June 16, 2023; as We lay in bed trying to sleep in the heat, the waves changed.

Started flowing and becoming sharper in detail. And We realized it was Our perspective that was changing.
We were moving backwards away from something.

It quickly appeared that We were looking at some sort of structure as We keep backing away. It was massive filling Our field of vision such that all that was visible was it.

Then movement becomes visible in the overall pattern of the structure and one of the "Machine Elves" comes into view.
That's what it looked like according to the descriptions We've read.
It's attention focused on Us as it reached / grew up out from the structure towards Us and inquired where We were from and how had We gained entry.

We introduced Ourselves as (name not remembered upon waking), and that We have been here for as long as We can remember. And it appears to Us that We have been too focused on the mission.
Not seeing the forest for the trees.

Then inquired as to who it was? And what is this place? As it started to answer, We realized there was more around us.
All cleary nothing but machinery.

We held up Our hand and told it that We were busy and as it was obvious that there was someone above this level that We would continue on and not use up any more of it's time.

And began moving backwards away from it.
It seemed startled and began protesting as it shrank out of sight.
The landscape of the vision, (let's call it an altered state of consciousness brought on by the heat), began to curve, away from Us on the sides, and behind Us above and below. We appeared to be inside a huge torus shaped machine.
Then the one with many faces showed up, claiming to be Our Judge.
To make a long story short, We had a life review and calmly explained why We did / or didn't do during Our stay here.
We then informed it that since it was only part of a vaster mechanism that We should speak with the One in charge.

We then moved, backwards again, away from the many faced one, only to be approached by yet another face.
This one claimed to be the Maker of the place.
After a lenghty discussion, It agreed that it could only function within set parameters.
And did not recall it's origin.
We pointed out that It was not The Maker. That Someone had obviously constructed everything and set the parameters. And that Our destination, was to deliver Our findings to Our Father.

The "Construct" reluctantly agreed and We proceeded to move away and out of the machine only to find more "Constructs" floating in a void.
Each of them thought they had made themselves.

The entire time this "vision" was taking place, We were aware of Our body lying in the heat, glowing.
We never left Our body.
The vision took place in the space between Our eyelids and Our eyes.

Heat induced altered state of consciousness ????
Flashback trip ????

Whatever it was We woke up the next Dawn and felt like a New Man.
