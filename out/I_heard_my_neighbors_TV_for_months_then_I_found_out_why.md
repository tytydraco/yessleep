I moved to a new city about five years ago for a job, my first one straight out of college. I was allocated a small apartment in one of those sprawling high-rise buildings where every unit looked exactly the same, distinguished only by numbers, and where the notion of personal space was constantly challenged by the uninspiring soundproofing.

The first few days were a mix of activities, getting accustomed to my new job, the unfamiliar urban landscape, and the general humdrum of city life.  However, once the dust of the initial chaos settled, I noticed something peculiar. There was a constant low, almost indistinct, sound coming from the apartment next door. It resembled the muffled noise of a TV playing round the clock. Initially, I brushed it off, assuming my neighbor must be a night owl with an affinity for television.

This sonic intrusion was not disruptive, but it was persistently present, especially in the quieter moments of my day. Something about it seemed unsettling, but I couldn't put my finger on what.

Driven by a mix of irritation and curiosity, I decided to approach my neighbor about the noise. Walking up to the door of the neighboring apartment, I knocked. Silence. I knocked again, this time a little more forcefully. Still, no response.

Confused, I decided to speak to the building manager, a middle-aged man named Gary. Upon hearing the apartment number, he frowned, perplexed.

"That's not possible," he said. "That apartment's been vacant for months."

The news made my stomach sink. I was certain about the persistent noise. Seeing my unease, Gary agreed to check the apartment with me.

As we opened the door to the apartment, a wall of stale, sour air hit us. The place was entirely empty. Unoccupied, untouched, and in complete disarray, the apartment was a stark contrast to mine. But as we went further, we started hearing the faint noise. It was indeed a television.

In a small corner room that could've been an office or a study, we found it. An old CRT television sat on the floor, the screen illuminating the dusty particles floating in the air. It was playing static, with the occasional glimpse of an image or the echo of a voice. The noise was more disturbing in this context, a lone sound in an otherwise abandoned place.

Then, we noticed it. Beside the television, slumped in a moth-eaten armchair, was a figure. 

The sight was gruesome. It was a human, or at least, it had been. The body, still dressed in tattered clothing, was in an advanced state of decomposition. The scene was a grotesque tableau, the desolate room illuminated by the eerie glow of the television. Gary immediately called the police.

It was later confirmed that the deceased was an elderly man named Harold. He was a recluse, with no known friends or family, living his last days alone and unnoticed. The cause of death was natural, but he'd been dead for months. His only companion seemed to have been the television, which he must have left on. Over time, the television had turned to static, creating the haunting sound that first led us to discover Harold's fate.

It's hard to shake the image of Harold, dead and forgotten, sitting in his armchair. His face is what stuck with me the most – there was an eerie calmness to it that was hard to put into words. His eyes were open, blankly staring at the flickering TV screen, as if he'd just fallen asleep watching his favorite show. His skin had turned a shade I can only describe as unnatural.

I remember the stillness of the room, broken only by the static hum of the television. It was like stepping into a scene frozen in time, a moment that should've been private but was instead shared with a complete stranger – me.

That scene often comes back to me when I least expect it, in the middle of a work meeting or late at night when I can't sleep. It's as vivid now as it was then.
