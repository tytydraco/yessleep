When I was six years old I lived in this big house that had belonged to my grandparents. My room had this old wooden door there that lead to my closet. One day I woke up in the middle of the night, needing to use the bathroom. I'm not sure why I even looked at the closet door when I walked past it, but I did. I was unlucky enough to have turned on the bedside lamp before I got up that gave me a good view of the horror that was there.


In the dark wood of the door was a pair of eyes. Not a mark, not a hole, but real eyes that were wood. Their uncanny look made me stop, and I felt them staring intensely at me. Those eyes terrified me so much that I ran out of my room. What I did next is something I still regret to this day â€” I went back to the room. I creaked open the door slowly, holding my breath as it got closer to revealing the closet. When I finally laid my sight on the eyes, they were staring back at me. Their gaze followed me as I walked to my bed. They stared as I climbed into the sheets and pulled the cover up to my neck. They stared as I reached towards the lamp. Right before I turned it off, they blinked. They blinked and I shut the light off and threw the blanket over my head, praying for it to be morning.


Although they never did blink again, I saw those eyes every time I went into my room and every morning when I woke up. I averted my gaze and stayed out of that room as much as possible, though it didn't do much. The fear never subsided, but, when I was twelve, my family moved and I finally left that door behind. We moved to a new state, with a new home, new school, and new friends. I tried hard to suppress those memories and think of them as just something I made up. With all of the new things the move brought, I eventually forgot all about those eyes.


I'm in my mid twenties now, I got my own place and I'm doing pretty well. I moved back to my home state and got a decent job. The problem is that the walls in my room here are made of wood. Yesterday morning all the suppressed memories from my childhood flooded back when I saw those eyes again in the walls. It was only for a brief moment, but I know it was those eyes. Although that freaked me out, I swear there was more of it this time. Instead of just those familiar eyes, there was a face with it. And this morning I know I saw a hand reaching out, too.


I don't know what this thing is, but it's trying to get out of those walls. You guys seem to know about all sorts of horrible creatures, so I'm hoping one of you can help me. Is there anything out there that can keep it from freeing more of itself? Or even a temporary solution to slow it down?


I know it hasn't done anything bad, but you guys didn't see its face. It wasn't some emotionless mask, there was something sinister in that lifelike wooden face. Something that I really don't want to meet.
