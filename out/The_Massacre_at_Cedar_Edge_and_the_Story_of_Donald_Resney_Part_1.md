It was a dark and stormy night. Wind howled through the trees. Alex was all alone in his house, and couldn't help but feel a sense of dread.

As he sat there, staring out the window at the storm raging outside, he heard a knock at the door. At first, he thought it was just the wind, but then it came again, louder and more insistent.

Alex reluctantly got up and made his way to the door, heart pounding in his chest. It was near enough to Halloween that it may be a prankster, Alex thought. He was just being silly. When he opened it, he was greeted by a figure standing on the doorstep, shrouded in a dark cloak.

He breathed a sigh of relief, and mentally chastised himself for being so childish. "Who are you?" He said, an irritated edge in his voice. 

"I am Death," the figure replied, its voice cold and hollow. "And I have come for you." Something about the tone the stranger had taken sent a chill up Alex's spine. It wasn't that of a prankster, trying to freak someone out. It was empty and matter-of-fact. Another thing, their intonation was all wrong. It sounded like an animal imitating speech. 

Alex tried to slam the door shut, but everything happened so fast. The figure reached out and grabbed him, pulling him into the darkness while he flailed and screamed.

As he struggled, Alex felt a cold hand wrap around his neck. Suddenly, a sense of calm washed over him. This was it. His time had come. No point in fighting it now. Alex's thoughts turned to the night sky, and his efforts to escape slowly faded away.

"He was never seen or heard from again. The only trace of his existence was a scream that neighbors reported hearing." Said Johnson, gesturing to the picture on the white board. "It started with Mr. Richten, but it didn't stop there." 

"The people of Cedar Edge locked their doors and windows tightly, thinking a murderer was on the loose. But no matter how much they tried to protect themselves, 'Death' always found a way in. Everyone in Cedar Edge was killed in a week." 

Donald was stunned. How? Nobody - not even the worst, most brutal serial killers - could kill a whole town in a week. Especially not individually, without guns. Without evidence. Without survivors.

"One by one, people disappeared, never to be seen again. Each time, the townspeople could hear the chilling sound of someone screaming in the night." Johnson continued. "Eventually, people stopped reporting it to the police. Probably because they were all gone, too." 

"Nobody knows what happened at Cedar Edge. Our best guess is a mass murderer, maybe a serial killer with an extremely fast cooldown period." Agent Wilson, Donald's partner, drew in his breath. He could hardly believe the briefing. Whoever this was had to be stopped. With Cedar Edge dead, they'd have to move on to another town. The Bureau had to work fast.


---

Donald and his partner had been investigating Cedar Edge for months now. As they delved deeper into the case, Donald began to uncover disturbing details. The victims all reported hearing a knock at their door on the night they disappeared, and they all described the same cloaked figure claiming to be Death.


Agent Resney was skeptical at first, but as the evidence piled up, he could no longer deny the truth. The killer was not human, but some sort of supernatural being. Agent Wilson wasn't exactly on the same page. At first he dismissed Donald's idea as a joke, then as superstition, but as Donald continued insisting, he began to worry. Maybe Donald needed a break. 


Donald didn't care what Wilson thought. Even after being reassigned, he tracked the movements of the killer. Using the reports of sightings and disappearances to try and pinpoint its location. After months of work, he found himself standing outside a small, rundown house on the outskirts of town.


He cautiously entered the house, his gun drawn. The place was dark and musty, and the air was heavy with the stench of death. As he made his way through the rooms, he heard a faint sound coming from the basement.


He crept down the stairs, his heart pounding in his chest. And there, in the dim light, he saw the cloaked figure standing over a body.


"Freeze!" Agent Resney shouted, pointing his gun at the figure.


But the figure just laughed, a cold and hollow sound. "You cannot stop Death," it said. "I will claim more victims, and there is nothing you can do to stop me."


With that, the figure disappeared, leaving Agent Resney standing alone in the dark basement. As he looked at the lifeless body on the ground, he heard a noise upstairs. It was Wilson. "Donald, what the hell are you doing here?" He said, confused. "We both know you were reassigned." Donald started to answer before Wilson looked past him, at the body on the ground. It was still warm. A fresh bruise circled around the young woman's neck. 


Wilson's confusion turned to shock and anger when he pieced together the available evidence. He put his hand on his holster. "Donald, give me your gun." He said slowly. "What? Wait, no, I didn't-" "Give me. Your. Gun." Wilson said with a firm voice. Donald panicked. He'd be arrested. Charged. Somehow he knew all the evidence would point to him. He charged down the stairs and through the basement's back door, slamming it shut. He just barely dodged the bullet that flew through the window as he made for the woods behind the house. He could hear Wilson calling in for backup.

The killings continued. Resney tracked them, obsessed with stopping the killer. The CEDEDGE Task Force was established after Resney's escape, dedicated to stopping the "Grim Reaper." Wilson, now a Special Agent and the head of the task force, fully believes that Donald is the killer. 


—


Donald knew he had to act quickly. He had to find and stop the killer before it claimed any more victims, and he had to clear his name before the task force caught up with him.


He spent his days tracking the killer's movements and piecing together the evidence. He knew he was getting close, but he also knew that time was running out.


One night, he found himself outside a small, isolated cabin deep in the woods. He could sense the presence of the killer inside, and he knew this was his chance to finally confront it.


He cautiously entered the cabin, his gun drawn. As he made his way through the rooms, he could feel the air growing colder and colder. And then, he heard a voice.


"Agent Resney," the voice said, its tone mocking. "You have been a thorn in my side for too long."


Donald turned to see the cloaked figure standing before him, its eyes glowing with a sinister light.


"Who are you?"  Resney demanded.


"I am Death." the figure replied, in the same matter-of-fact tone that had terrified Alex Richten nearly two years ago. 


Donald knew he had to act quickly. He raised his gun and fired, but the figure just laughed and disappeared into the shadows.

Nearly a year had passed since that day in Cedar Edge. Wilson had changed. He had trusted Donald, and his trust had been broken. Horribly. It all made sense now. Why Donald had taken sick leave the same week Cedar Edge was massacred. 


He looked out the window of the SUV, watching the moonlit mountains in the distance. He didn't like it out here. It was cold and rainy and empty. A perfect place for a monster like Resney, he supposed. The population of Allentown, a medium-sized township in northern Oregon had been the Grim Reaper's latest victims. But this time it was different. It was taking longer. Two weeks so far, instead of one. Maybe Resney was getting sloppy, Wilson thought to himself. 


They had managed to track Donald to a hotel in the next town over, which he had reserved under a fake name. Hunter Blackwell. "Hunter" was fitting, Wilson thought. 


Once they reached Allentown, Wilson and his team set up surveillance of Resney's hotel, surrounded the building, and started waiting for him to show up.

Donald was tired. Exhausted. He felt broken. His life had been uprooted, and even after all his work, whatever the fuck he was hunting had simply disappeared. He knew it wasn't human, but he refused to believe it was Death. No, Death didn't work this way. This was masquerading as Death and killing people in his name. 


Donald resolved to do some research on supernatural beings, and look for any that fit the bill; pretending to be more powerful entities, often ones invented by humans, and massacring communities.


But that could wait. For now, he was tired. He needed sleep, badly. He got into the old, GPS-less Chevy he had bought in cash, and headed for the warmth and comfort of his hotel room.
