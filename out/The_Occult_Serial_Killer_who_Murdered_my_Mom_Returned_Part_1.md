The Sun King Killer returned to Bisu Valley one week after I graduated high school. By that Friday night, when the first murder in years occurred, I had already grown bored of my time out of school. The appeal of laying on the couch in my pajamas all day was gone. Without a job or any exams to study for, I grew restless. I awaited my dorm room assignment, which wouldn’t come for months. I frequently wrote in my diary about what I planned to do at college and how I planned to lead my life on campus.

The night of the first return killing, I sat on the couch surfing the channels on television. I lazily held the remote control in my hand. None of the programs held my attention for longer than a minute. My dad sat in his chair across from me, putting on his boots. The leather squeaked as he jammed his foot through.

“I’m so glad you got rid of those old ones,” I said.

My dad only ever owned one pair of shoes, his work boots. He wore them everywhere - to the store, to dinner parties, to church. He even wore them when he took me to the beach as a kid. He would take off the laces so the tongue could flap around in the sand. His boots served him well as a handyman, however. He would wear his boots until they totally fell apart. Only then would he reluctantly replace them.

“Oh I kept the old pair, just in case,” he said. “I just bought these to get you off my back, always saying I need new shoes. So, how do I look?”

I put the remote control down. My father stood over me. He shook out his limbs before he put his hands on his hips and smiled. He wore a flannel shirt tucked into blue jeans. His clothes were freshly washed, but still contained silhouettes of past stains. The colors had faded.

“Like you’re going to break some hearts tonight,” I said.

“Oh I don’t need that.”

He leaned down and kissed me on the top of my head.

“Get in the shower and wash your hair, kid,” he said.

“Whatever,” I said. “Don’t have too much fun.”

“Only so much trouble a man can get into at a church event.”

Bisu Valley was a small place. If someone knew of the town, it was likely for one of two reasons. In the first place, it was a getaway destination. There were resorts and spas and wineries for out-of-towners to enjoy. Being in the foothills of a national park, it was also a special place for nature enthusiasts. All of this gave the town a reputation for being off-kilter and funky. There were crystal shops and tarot readings in the park. Alternative spiritual practices were mainstream here. One of the biggest churches in town practiced Gnosticism, a type of early Christianity which had some followers in the first few centuries of the Common Era. It posited a complex cosmology and held that there was a higher ultimate divinity beyond the creator god. It was considered a heresy by Early Church Fathers. If people knew of Bisu Valley, it was either for these reasons or for the occult murders that plagued the town two decades ago.

Beginning in the mid 2000s, a series of bizarre and unexplained murders baffled and terrorized the community. People turned up dead in their homes, in parks, and on lonely side roads. A visual depiction of a sun and a man in crown accompanied each victim. Sometimes these images were drawn on scraps of paper, other times they were painted with the victim’s blood. Fifteen years earlier, when I was three years old, my mother and her brother, my uncle, were murdered together in their parent’s home. An image of a king and a sun was painted on the wall.

Profilers from the FBI could not come up with a coherent idea of who the killer or killers might be. Local law enforcement was at a loss for any tangible evidence. This opened the door for self-appointed experts in satanic cults and occult murder to descend on the town. The quirkiness of the town which most considered charming became sinister in the tellings of these supposed experts.

Accusations flew of complicity and secret allegiance to esoteric satanic sects. Those few conservative Christians in the town who only barely tolerated Bisu Valley’s eccentricities totally believed the idea that the murders were evidence of spiritual battles spilling over into the physical world. According to them, the people of Bisu Valley had brought the bloodshed upon themselves by tolerating heathenism. After my mom and uncle were murdered, my dad became the target of their speculation. He was the son of a veteran of Army intelligence and a self-help author. The more conspiratorial among the mob alleged that my dad was brainwashed by his parents as members of a generational satanic cult to carry out the murders. In his quest to disprove them, he joined their church. He became a faithful member of their parish and attended church for over a dozen years.

He left that Friday for an event sponsored by the church, one intended to connect devout singles. A flyer for the night advertised board games and Bible trivia and music which honored God. My dad never considered dating or remarrying while I was in school. It was only after I had grown up and entered adulthood that he expressed an interest in finding love again.

“I’ve just got to check in with Ed before I get there,” he said.

Ed was a friend of my grandfather, my mother’s father. Shortly after losing their only two children in such a brutal and inescapable attack, my grandfather and grandmother took a handful of sleeping pills each and locked themselves in the garage with the car running. My father made a point holding together what little remnants of family remained. Family friends were made family and friends of friends became closer too. Ed lived up the street from us, on a lonely wooded road which ended in a hiking trail.

The front door creaked open. My dad smiled at me before stepping out into the golden evening. After the door clicked shut, I fell over sideways and regarded the television screen from an odd angle. Before long, I was asleep.

I woke up hours later in the dark. Flashes of red and blue lights painted the wall behind the television, which still played a sitcom. I turned it off and sat up, rubbing my eyes. Through the window behind the couch, I saw police officers standing around their cars in the road below. They talked to each other with their hands on their hips.

“I bet you it’s that Bouchard kid,” my dad said. I jumped at his voice. I turned to see him in the room, wearing the same clothes as when he left. I checked the grandfather clock next to the television. It was close to midnight.

“What’s going on?” I said.

“Rosa’s dead. Her boyfriend’s the one that called it, but you know how he was with her, Tyler Bouchard. Hot and cold, one minute all lovey dovey, the next shouting and berating her and threatening her.”

Screaming pierced through the walls of the house. I again looked below and saw two police officers gripping the arms of our neighbor and my dad’s former apprentice, Tyler Bouchard. He kicked and flailed like a fish on the line.

“Stop, stop, no, stop,” he shouted. His voice gargled and shrilled through tears. “Babe, no please I didn’t do this! Babe, please. Baby!”

“I should know better than anyone what that kid’s like,” my dad said. “He’s unstable. Couldn’t even crack it as my apprentice. That poor woman.”

The next morning, while my dad was doing yard work, I dressed and walked down the hill to the police station where the chief was scheduled to hold a press conference on the murder. The room where the press conference was held was all overhead lights and wood paneling. There was a table on the opposite side of the room as the podium with coffee and water. Fold out chairs were organized in rows facing the front. In attendance were a couple of local reporters and engaged citizens, some of whom I recognized from church. One couple in particular focused on me. A woman with short, curly white hair turned to me as I entered the room. She swatted at her husband, a tall man who sat with his arms crossed. She pointed at me. The man turned and shrugged. I took my seat.

The people in the room settled into their seats as the chief of police approached the podium flanked by two other officers. One unfolded an easel.

“Good morning,” he said. The chief summarized the incident, that the night before officers responded to a 911 call on my street. “Officers quickly identified a suspect, 24 year old Tyler Bouchard.”

One of the officers placed a printed out mugshot on the easel. The man depicted had puffy red eyes. His mouth hung open. He had messy strawberry blonde hair and a scraggly beard.

“Bouchard was romantically linked to the deceased, 22 year old Rosalita Maldonado. Acquaintances described their relationship as volatile. One the scene, officers observed Bouchard behaving erratically, holding a hammer and wearing work boots, both of which were covered in the deceased’s blood.”

My chest seized. One of the officers swapped out the poster of the mug shot for a picture of the boots in a plastic bag. They were the same ones my dad wore the night before. I recognized the stitching and the color and the laces. My stomach twisted and sent a wave of nausea through my body.

“Bouchard was taken into custody and will be arraigned on charges at a court hearing Monday morning,” the chief said. He paused and gripped the podium. He then nodded to his fellow officer.

“Officers also found a symbol painted on the wall of the house,” he said. The officer placed a picture of the house’s living room wall on the easel. The woman from church gasped. A king with snakes for legs faced the sun. He wore a crown and cloak.

“Long time residents of Bisu Valley will recognize this symbol. It bears resemblance to what was left at the scene of so called ‘Sun King Killings’ in the early 2000s. Detectives are aggressively pursuing all possibilities, including a copy cat killing, the work of a satanic cult, or the return of the original killer. Rest assured, the safety of the community is our top priority.”

The reporters in the room shot up to ask questions. The police officers exited the podium, bringing the posters and easel with them. The church couple swiped their hands in the air at the chief. I got up and sped for the exit.

When I got home, my dad was still in the front yard. He was hunched over a lawnmower, sweating. Half the grass was trimmed.

“Hey kid,” he said. He had a smile on his face which fell away when I approached. “Is something wrong?”

I looked down and saw my dad wearing his old pair of work boots.
