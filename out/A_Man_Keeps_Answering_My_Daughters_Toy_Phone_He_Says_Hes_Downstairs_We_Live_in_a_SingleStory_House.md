I don’t remember who gave my daughter the phone. 

Perhaps Mia found it abandoned after the school fete, a grubby plastic prize forgotten on a trestle table, or maybe she simply took it, small fingers closing around its cheap pink body when no one was looking. 

It appeared one afternoon, clutched in her hand. It looked harmless enough: garish pink plastic, oversized buttons, a receiver attached by a tight coil of wire. 

Harmless, until the dial tone started. 

A thin, persistent electronic buzz emanated from its hollow core, a sound that had no right to exist in a toy lacking any battery compartment, any mechanism at all beyond molded plastic.

Mia pressed the buttons with solemn concentration. 

*Beep. Beep. Beep.* 

The dial tone hummed again. 

"See, Mama?" she announced. "It works!" 

I forced a smile, watching dishwater drip from my fingers onto the worn linoleum. It probably has a tiny battery compartment I missed, I reasoned, already mentally turning the toy over, searching for seams. Kids' toys were sneaky like that. 

"That’s lovely, bug," I said, aiming for lightness. "Who are you calling?"

But Mia wasn’t pretending to have a conversation. She lifted the receiver to her ear, her small face shifting into an expression of intense, unnerving focus. Her eyes widened slightly, pupils dilating in the dim kitchen light. Then she lowered the phone. 

"Mama?" she asked, her voice dropping to a near-whisper. "The phone-man says he's downstairs."

*Downstairs?* Boxgrove Cottage, our weathered sanctuary, the place David built stone by stone with his own hands before the cancer took him, stood defiantly on the ancient flint foundations he'd chosen. 

A single story. 

I knew its bones like I knew my own, David had shown me every joist, every beam, every compacted inch of earth before the floorboards went down. No cellar. No basement. Not even a crawlspace. 

"That’s just pretend, sweetheart," I managed, my throat constricting. "You know there *is* no downstairs here. Silly phone-man!" 

The ritual became dreadful. 

Mia would lift the receiver, press *any* button. 

The impossible dial tone would buzz – a hungry, metallic drone. Then a silence would fall. 

Mia’s face would go still, her child’s features absorbing words I strained to hear but couldn’t. 

"He’s downstairs," she’d state flatly, returning the receiver to its cradle. 

Her small brow furrowed with an uncertainty that felt strange on her face. One grey afternoon, as rain lashed the small windows, she shivered violently after listening. 

"He says it’s cold down there, Mama. Really cold." 

A shiver traced its way down my own spine.

One afternoon I had enough and snatched the phone from her hands. 

The plastic felt unnaturally frigid, as if it had lain in snow, sucking the warmth from my fingers. Its hollowness mocking me. I hurled it into the kitchen bin, the cheap plastic clattering against the metal sides. 

Mia’s reaction was immediate she screamed a wail, small fists pounding my legs with surprising force, tears streaming down her face. 

"My phone! My phone!" she screamed, the sound raw and desperate. The fight left her trembling and hiccuping on the kitchen floor, her eyes huge and swimming with betrayal. 

Defeated, trembling myself, I retrieved the hateful thing from the bin, wiping greasy coffee grounds off the plastic. 

Fine.

That night, I hid it. Properly hid it. 

Wrapped in an old tea towel, shoved deep into the cold, dark recesses at the back of the rarely used linen closet, behind stacks of yellowed towels. I locked the closet door. I checked on Mia twice, her breathing soft and even in sleep, her hands empty. 

The next morning, Mia padded in, her hair sleep-tousled, pyjamas rumpled. 

And clutched tightly in her small hand, its pink plastic garish against the soft flannel, was the toy phone.

My blood turned to ice. 

I whirled, stumbling towards the linen closet. The door was still locked. I fumbled with the key, my hands shaking violently.

Inside, everything was undisturbed. The stacks of towels sat exactly as I’d left them. I shoved my hand deep into the dark space at the back, fingers scrabbling against the cold wall. 

Nothing. Just dust and the smell of forgotten fabric. The tea towel bundle was gone. 

"He missed us," she said.

That day, I called Tom.

My brother. 

"Kids, Sar," he boomed down the line. "Remember Brutus? My invisible wolf who supposedly ate my geometry homework?" His chuckle died when I didn’t join in. 

"This isn’t Brutus, Tom," I whispered. "She *knows* there’s no downstairs. She asked me yesterday why the phone-man lies to her." 

Silence crackled down the phone line, heavy and sudden. 

"Right," he said finally, his voice losing its easy confidence. "Bring the bloody thing over. Let’s have a look at this demon phone."

Tom’s apartment smelled of stale pizza and damp laundry. 

Mia proudly held out the phone for her uncle. She pressed a button. 

*Beep. Beep. Beep.* 

Dial tone. Silence. She pressed another. 

*Beep. Beep. Beep.* 

Dial tone. Longer silence. Relief washed over me. 

"Thank God."

I sagged against his cluttered countertop. 

Tom, however, frowned, turning the inert plastic over in his large hands. He shook it near his ear. Nothing. 

"Or," he said slowly, his gaze meeting mine, serious now, "maybe it only works... *there*? At the cottage?"

The drive home was filled with a thick, unspeakable dread. 

As I turned the key in the heavy oak door of the cottage, a sound shattered the suffocating quiet – a shrill, mechanical *RIIIIIIING* ripped from the toy in Mia’s arms. 

Impossible. 

Mia answered before I could move, before I could scream. 

"Uh-huh…" she murmured, listening intently. 

Her small face showed no fear, only a strange concentration. 

"Okay…" She held the receiver out towards me. Her voice was flat, devoid of its usual childish lilt. "He says *you* have to talk now, Mama."

My lungs seized. I took the plastic receiver. My hand shook violently as I slowly, dreadfully, raised it to my ear.

Static roared, not the white noise of a dead channel, but the rasp of countless dry leaves scouring ancient stone. 

Then, beneath it, cutting through the chaos, came the voice. Resonating within the cheap plastic shell yet feeling impossibly vast, cavernous, like stone grinding against stone deep within the earth:

"Sarah." It knew my name. "Can you feel the cold seep up? Let me in. I am... downstairs."

The phone clattered from my nerveless fingers, striking the flagstone floor with a sharp crack. Mia jumped, her eyes wide. 

"Mama? You’re all white." She sounded scared now, finally sensing the terror radiating from me.

We had to get out. The thought screamed in my head. 

Now. I swept Mia up, ignoring her startled cry, and ran for the front door, fumbling with the deadbolt I’d just thrown. Cold air hit us as I burst outside, stumbling down the path towards our old Volvo parked beside the cottage. 

I yanked the passenger door open, practically shoving Mia inside onto the seat. 

"Stay there!" I gasped, slamming her door and lunging for the driver’s side. 

My hands shook so badly the key scraped metal before finding the ignition. Turn. Turn. Please. I twisted it. Nothing.

No. No! 

I twisted again, frantic. Dead. The engine was lifeless.

A wave of cold washed over me then. It felt like icy fingers brushing the nape of my neck, a silent, palpable presence watching from the doorway I’d left gaping open. The flint walls seemed to loom darker, the empty windows like watching eyes.

We couldn’t stay exposed out here. 

With a choked sob, I ripped Mia back out of the car, her small body limp with confusion. I sprinted back towards the cottage, the sense of something pursuing, something reaching, propelling me forward. 

I slammed the heavy oak door shut behind us with all my strength. Only then, gasping for breath, did I bolt it with trembling hands, then race to the back door, throwing that lock too. Finally, I yanked curtains closed across every small window, plunging the cottage into premature twilight, shutting out the world and the impossible cold that had followed us back inside.

Night crawled in. I huddled on the worn sofa, Mia curled tight against me, her breathing eventually slowing into sleep, lulled by the frantic, hammering rhythm of my own heart against her small back.

Exhaustion dragged me under into a fitful, nightmare-haunted sleep. 

I dreamed of roots, thick as my wrist and glistening with dark moisture, forcing hairline cracks in the cottage’s foundation stones. I dreamed of something patient, something older than the flint itself, *uncurling* in the absolute, suffocating dark far below, shifting with the slow deliberation of continents.

I snapped awake. Not from the dream.

*From the sound.*

*Scritch-scratch… Scritch-scratch…*

I take a few minutes to try and locate it. Not at the door. Not at the window.

*Under the floor.*

Directly beneath the threadbare rug in front of the cold hearth. The sound of something hard and sharp – claws? Stones? – dragging across solid rock. 

*Scritch-scratch… Scritch-scratch…* 

Mia slept on, her face peaceful in the gloom. 

I lay paralyzed, every muscle locked, breath trapped in my frozen chest. I stared fixedly at the worn rug, the floorboards beneath it, willing the sound to be a dream, a trick of the wind, anything but what I knew it was. 

It stopped.

Then it rose.  What I could describe as a low-frequency vibration that hummed in the marrow of my bones, a pressure building inside my skull, pressing against my eardrums. The voice, stripped now of any echo of humanity, resonated with the crushing weight of strata, the groan of tectonic plates, the absolute void of deep places:

"Sarah..."

My breath stopped. The cottage itself seemed to hold its breath. The scratching did not resume. 

There was only the heavy, waiting silence, and the terrible, unspoken knowledge of what lay beneath.
