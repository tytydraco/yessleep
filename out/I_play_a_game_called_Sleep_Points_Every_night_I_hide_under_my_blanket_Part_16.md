As odd as it was that my watch wasn’t changing back to normal after I tapped it, like it usually did, I tried not to really focus on it, since it just didn’t seem like that much of an immediate threat, and nobody else could seem to notice it anyway.  Nobody except Anastasia, that is.  And somehow, she could even see The Sandman’s face in my watch even while I, myself, couldn’t.  She only tapped on the face of my watch to make sure I could see him too.   Somehow, The Sandman’s face was always visible in my watch, even when it wasn’t to me.  And now, ever since she had given me my watch BACK, it didn’t matter what I did anymore.  Just like with Anastasia, I could now ALWAYS see his face, whether I gave my watch a tap or not.

7th period breezed by, uneventfully as usual.  Which was great because it meant that I didn’t make a scene by passing out in the middle of class or doing anything else to arouse suspicion.  I guess by the end of the day, everyone’s pretty tired anyhow, so I must not’ve stood out.  I headed over to the bus and guess who I saw?  I don’t blame you if guessed Ezra, but it actually wasn’t him, thankfully enough.  Instead, it was Truman.  It was time once again for him to hound me for Sleep Points answers on our way to the bus.  The guy just would not let up.  And I was starting to get annoyed as hell.  

I know that probably seems pretty shitty of me, given how much help I, myself, had been getting from Anastasia.  But the difference there was the fact that she was willingly offering me help.  And practically demanding I take it at that.  I’d like to think I would’ve just left her alone if she didn’t feel like helping.  But then again, maybe I’d be no better.  I guess there’s no way to say for sure, since that just wasn’t the way things shook out.

Either way, I still didn’t really wanna help.  But deep down I knew that so much of the reason behind why I couldn’t sleep at night was because of all the guilt I had been harboring over these past few days for telling him about the note.  Part of me felt like I owed it to him since it kinda felt like it was my fault he ever joined Sleep Points in the first place.  Maybe giving Truman some helpful advice would turn out to be the one thing I truly needed all along to finally get myself some sleep.  

“Yo, Stanley,” said Truman.  “I dunno what Annie mighta told ya, but whatever info she gave you, ya can pass it on to me aight.  She trusts you.  She isn’t gonna feed you a loada bullshit like she would if I asked.  The only question I have now is ‘Can I trust you?’”, said Truman.  Surely being the trustworthy and reliable person that Truman was expecting me to be would help me sleep at night.  It couldn’t’ve hurt to try it out.  So, I told him a quick rundown of what I knew.

“Okay, so first things first: don’t let your phone die.  That’s one of the rules.  And don’t try breaking the clock, either.  The clock doesn’t actually break every night like you think it does: only the glass.  Breaking the clock is the only way out of the game.  At least as far as I know.  But it comes at a cost: you never sleep again.  And soon enough, that’ll kill you,“ I said.  “So yeah,” I continued.  “Do whatever you want with that information, I guess.  If you would seriously rather take the whole death-by-no-sleep route, then go right ahead.  Just break it.  I honestly couldn’t blame you,” I said.  Truman seemed sincerely grateful for what I told him, and then we both headed over to the bus.  

Another thing keeping me up was my new Kingdom Hearts game.  I figured if I got that off my chest to my parents, maybe that’d do the trick too.  I knew they probably wouldn’t get the full refund for it.  But I had to make sure I had tried everything I could think of before going to bed.  I tried to savor the ride home since I decided that as soon as I got home, I was gonna have to tell my parents about how I had been on my phone when I shouldn’t have been.  And they were probably gonna ground me again.  They’d almost certainly take away my Kingdom Hearts III.  But I had bigger problems.  And I had to try everything I could think of to tackle them.

When I got home, I thanked the bus driver and hopped off.  Just like with trying to help out Truman, I figured I could use whatever good karma I could get my hands on to help myself drift off.  I half-contemplated playing Kingdom Hearts III one last time before saying goodbye to it.  But I decided against it.  I had to get this all over with now, before I gave myself some excuse to bitch out.  I saw my Dad sitting in front of the TV.  I didn’t quite know how to broach the subject to him and start my confession and all that, so I just kinda walked right up to him.

“What’s up?  Anything wrong?” he asked, pausing his show.

“I just wanted to tell you something…” I said, awkwardly.

“Well, what is it?” he asked.

“So, y’know that new game you and Mom got me?” I asked a bit timidly.

“Of course.  How ya been likin’ it?” he asked.

“Oh, I mean it’s great.  I’m really glad you and Mom got it for me.  But the thing is, you got it for me because I followed the rules of my grounding, right?”

“Yup,” Dad said.

“Well, I never went on my switch, or my laptop, but I might’ve snuck some time on my phone now and then,” I confessed.  But I still didn’t feel comfortable with how I was phrasing things.  If I was gonna have a hope of meeting my sleep requirements tonight, I was gonna have to be a little more thorough.  

“Well, it was more than JUST now and then, if I’m being totally honest.  Pretty much every morning before school, I’d sneak into your guys’ room and play on my phone while mom was in the shower.  No, not pretty much.  Literally every school morning.  And then over the weekend.  I snuck into your room while you and mom were asleep and took my phone.  I kept it the whole weekend.  You didn’t really lose it.  I-I had just taken it,” I confessed.  “And then I snuck it back to make sure you could still give it back to me on Monday,” I said.

Dad certainly looked surprised to be hearing all of this.  And a little disappointed too, which always hurts.  He was quiet for a bit, but eventually spoke up.  “Well, I’m proud that you did what was right and told me the truth. Even though you broke the rules your mother and I set for your grounding, you still came forward and confessed.  So I’ll tell ya what:  I’ll let ya keep the game,” he said.  

“Besides, at this point, I can’t return it to the store for a full refund.  May as well keep it anyhow, kid”, he said with a bit of a chuckle.  “But I’ll need to take your phone for the week.  You can keep your laptop and switch, since ya stayed off botha those,” he said.  
“Alright, I’ll go upstairs and get my phone,” I said.

While I was climbing up the stairs, I came to the uncanny realization that, while it wasn’t doing it yesterday, my watch was now starting to glow, ever so slightly.  I was willing to ignore the fact that The Sandman wasn’t going away when I tapped the face of my watch, like it was supposed to, but now my watch looked like it was going through the same stages as my clock when The Sandman would come out.  Would I still be protected by hiding under my blanket, even WITHOUT the watch on?  What the hell was I even supposed to DO about this?

Since I STILL wanted to convince myself that I wasn’t seeing what I thought I was seeing AGAIN, I went into the bathroom and turned the lights off.  In spite of everything that had happened so far, part of me was still seriously hoping that the lack of sleep I had been getting and all the paranoia that came with it was just making me see things that weren’t there.  If I tested the watch by putting it in a completely pitch-black environment, that’d let me prove my eyes right or wrong.  And they were right.  Sure enough, when I switched off the lights, there was an undeniable, though faint, glow from the face of my College High watch with The Sandman’s ominous gaze piercing through.

I didn’t have time to freak out about all that since I still had to give dad my phone.  I took it off the charger and rushed it downstairs, trying to make sure it would lose as little as possible of its battery.  When I got downstairs, I asked dad if he could keep it on the charger for me, and he agreed.  But then, just after I handed it over, I had another fear.  What if he and mom needed to use both chargers in their room at once again?  What if, just like last time, he took my phone off the charger and didn’t put it back?

Dammit.  In that case, I’d have to sneak it out AGAIN.  And, since I already confessed to doing it once, dad would already know to suspect it of me.  It’d be so much harder to get away with it this time around.  Even if I DID abide by the rules of my NEW grounding by refusing to use it, there’s STILL no guarantee the plan would work, now that dad knew what to look for, thanks to my confession.  Great.  This was just great.  WHY did I think admitting to sneaking out my phone from my parents’ bedroom was a good idea again?  Ugh.

Anyway, that was that.  I had done everything I could do.  I had earned my Good Samaritan points for the day by helping Truman as best I could with HIS Sleep Points problems (as if I didn’t already have enough of my OWN), confessing to my parents that I had been on my phone while I was grounded, thanking the bus driver, donating 3 dollars to Wikipedia, the whole nine yards.  And if even all of THAT wasn’t working, I STILL had the melatonin gummies Anastasia gave me in case of an absolute emergency.  And maybe I wouldn’t even need them.  Maybe clearing my conscience would be enough on its own.  So, I went upstairs to my room to take a nap, keeping a good distance away from my watch.

I had absolutely nothing to feel guilty about.  No reason to ruminate on any negative thoughts at that point.  Surely sleep would come perfectly naturally now.  And sure enough, it still didn’t.  After a little over an hour, it was 5 o’clock and time for dinner.  I went to check my phone to see if I had made any progress.  I couldn’t.  I wasn’t allowed to use it.  But it didn’t matter.  I had to check my watch for that anyway, not my phone.   My watch was the one with my number of minutes on it. I must’ve gotten my portable screens confused, for whatever reason.  

I got out of bed and took a look at the watch.  The number at the bottom was still stuck at 17, just like it was when Anastasia checked.  Just like yesterday, I knew there wouldn’t be enough time in between when I got home at 3:30 and dinner at 5 to meet my required number of minutes slept all at once.  Not unless I got extremely lucky and somehow managed to fall asleep immediately.  Which, let’s face it, was never gonna happen.  But I still needed to feel like I had made progress towards 90.  I still needed to feel like everything I had done to help myself sleep wasn’t all for nothing.  But it sure looked like it was.

Dinner, however, was a much more pleasant affair than usual.  And certainly, a whole hell of a lot more pleasant than all my miserable failures at sleep over the past two days.  Or at least, it had started out that way.  Instead of my parents grilling me on this or that, they congratulated me once again for being truthful and said that it was a good sign of character.  Which honestly made me feel better than I had in a long while.  I had done something honestly good.  Something I could take pride in.   But then Dad told me about a phone call he and Mom had gotten.  A phone call from Mrs. Bagfield.  Oh no.

“When we got a call from school saying you weren’t eating your lunch and falling asleep in class, we were worried sick.  Listen, Morgan:  we’re glad your conscience made you do the right thing. But you always deserve a good night’s sleep and a good meal at lunch.  We never would’ve wanted you to feel so guilty that you couldn’t sleep or eat.  We care about you.  We really do.  Breaking the rules when you were grounded wasn’t THAT big a deal.  Ya didn’t have to beat yourself up so bad.  Really.  It’s okay,” said Dad.

I guess this wasn’t entirely removed from reality.  On the one hand, the main reason I wasn’t getting any sleep at night was because of Stage Two of Sleep Points.  But on the other, my guilty conscience wasn’t doing me any favors either.  It was like Anastasia had said: most people in my position would’ve gotten more sleep by now.  All the guilt I had over all sorts of thing’s must’ve played a role, somehow.  I just couldn’t understand why else I would have so much more difficulty going to sleep than anybody else in my position.  And now all the guilt was gone.  And yet, I still wasn’t sleeping any better than before.  So, maybe the guilt didn’t matter as much as I thought it did.  It was tough to say.

One GOOD thing about breaking the rules and owning up to it, though, was the fact that now I had a reasonable explanation for why I wasn’t getting any sleep.  As awkward and cringey as my confession was, it had the important benefit of explaining away why I had been so sleep-deprived in class that day.  Without it, I dunno WHAT my story would’ve been.

When dinner was over, I went back up to my room to try and sleep.  I figured I didn’t have to worry about sleeping with my head under the blanket because there would be no way that I’d sleep long enough for The Sandman to catch me with my head out from under the covers once midnight came around.  And I was right.  But only because, once again, I didn’t get any sleep at all, no matter how hard I tried.  
I tried for like 5 and a half hours to get sone sleep and got nowhere.  As midnight got closer and closer, The Sandman’s face in the clock grew more and more twisted, becoming more and more frightening than ever before.  

Again, I thought maybe it was another sleepless paranoia thing, but his face just looked so much more menacing than usual.  He seemed to have a bit of a deranged and twisted smile now.  And this was new since I had never once seen The Sandman smile before.  The hellish grin slowly but surely started undeniably taking shape.  He knew.  The Sandman knew my time was almost up.  And boy, was he was about to rub it in my face once midnight struck.

I checked one last time to make absolutely certain I didn’t have my watch on.  I knew consciously that I would’ve felt a burn by then, but I still felt the need to check.  The glass broke.  And with a thundering, monstrous voice, The Sandman got right up next to my head, just outside the blanket, with a sense of knowing triumph: “Still Not Asleep. Only 6 hours left.”

It wasn’t just his voice now.  There will terrible, hugely pained shrieks that I could hear all too well.  I had never heard anything like it before.  Or at least, I THOUGHT I hadn’t.  After a moment, they had almost begun to sound oddly familiar.  And then it hit me:  these were the same strained shrieks of pain and agony that I had heard walking home from Anastasia’s.  

Back when I had been walking home in her blanket to keep warm, I had heard them just after all the power on my street went out and the Aurora suddenly switched off out of nowhere.  Just as the sky was turning red with that damn blood-tinged smoke that had been coming out of the chimney of the house that I had stopped in front of while this was all taking place.  Back during all of THAT.

I almost jolted with fear when I finally realized it had been the same voices screaming at that moment as back then.  And that would’ve been terrible since it would’ve compromised my blanket shield completely if I had moved a muscle.  All the voices were the same except one, that is.  There was a new voice added to the choir of cries.  If I really tried to listen for it, I could just barely pick it out. Was it mine?  It couldn’t be.  I might not’ve exactly had the world’s manliest voice, but I’m still a guy.  Even though my voice dropped quite a bit since 9th grade, I still sounded, if nothing else like a boy.  And this new voice sounded distinctly feminine.  I didn’t scream like a girl, did I?  How would The Sandman even KNOW what my screams sounded like?  As much as I had WANTED to scream like a girl, I still WASN’T.  If I had made even a sound, that would’ve ALSO amounted to giving myself up.

And then, soon enough, it was 12:01 and The Sandman had left. Nothing had worked.  Nothing.  Had.  Worked.  No matter how long I stayed up, no matter what exercise I did, no matter what sins I confessed to, NOTHING was letting me sleep.  Up to this point, I was still desperately clinging to the notion that I would just fall asleep naturally.  That I wouldn’t NEED any outside help like Anastasia’s melatonin gummies.  But they were the last resort I had left.  I had nothing else to turn to.  After The Sandman left, I took 2 gummies, the amount a person’s supposed to take in one night.  I still had to see if a normal amount would be enough.

I checked the watch.  It was still glowing.  It was glowing more than ever.  Now the number at the bottom read 26.  Well, I was at least making SOME progress.  Even if nothing was letting me get the amount of sleep I NEEDED, that number 26 beneath the timer meant that I had now successfully slept 26 minutes straight.  It was an improvement.  It was something.  But not nearly enough.  Too little, too late.

An hour and a half passed, and I wasn’t any more tired.  But I decided to give it another hour.  It was now 1:30 AM.  I now had 4 hours and 30 minutes to sleep for 90 minutes straight.  Meaning I had 3 hours to fall asleep.  I had to take the melatonin.  I took two, the recommended dosage.  Another half hour passed.  2 AM.  Still nothing.  I took 3 more.  Anastasia HAD recommended 5 to 10, after all.  2:30 came and I still wasn’t asleep.  If anything, I was more awake than ever before.  More wide-awake than ever before in my LIFE.  Now where was THIS when I needed it, back during Mrs. Bagfield’s class?

And soon enough, it was 3.  I was too terrified to even come CLOSE to sleep.  I was just 3 hours away from death.  This was gonna be it.  This really WAS gonna be how I died.  No.  It couldn’t be.  I had too many melatonin gummies to give up.  This wasn’t over until I had gone through the entire container of 60.  I still had 55 left.  I hadn’t even reached Anastasia’s upper limit of 10.  No, no, no.  I was in no position to give up.  Not yet.

I immediately took 5 more, bringing myself up to 10.  But I couldn’t help thinking back to what Anastasia had said.  17 minutes, even 26 minutes by then probably, was worryingly low.  Would even 10 be enough?  But I calmed down a little when I remembered that her 5-10 gummies recommendation probably took into consideration how badly things were going for me. So it was probably gonna be enough.

And then 4 o’clock came.  I was REALLY supposed to be asleep by then.  Given that I only had 30 minutes left to fall asleep, I tried another 10.  15 minutes later, I was still up.  Time was starting to SERIOUSLY run out on me.  At that point, I had to go big or go home.  I knew it was a bad idea, but I took ALL of the remaining 40 melatonin gummies. I figured that, if nothing else, that obnoxiously blaring alarm would wake me up.  Anastasia had made it sound like that thing was gonna wake me up no matter WHAT.  And I believed it.  After having heard it both Sunday and Monday morning, I was ready to believe that thing could wake me up through ANYTHING.  Even an entire container’s worth of melatonin gummies probably.

  
And then the fateful time 4:30 AM had finally arrived.  And I was still not asleep.  I had no choice but to come to terms with my mortality now.  It was too late.  I had my chance to sleep 90 minutes and I had officially blown it.  I checked the watch.  Even though the number below the timer had crept up to 29, it was still all over.  The Sandman had already won.

Given that I had officially lost all hope for survival, I was honestly surprised that The Sandman hadn’t taken me right then and there.  It was already over.  4:30 had already come and gone.  And with it, my last chance for 90 minutes of sleep before 6 AM.  But this got me thinking.  Maybe there was still a way out of this.  Maybe there was still a way out.  I didn’t bother trying to fall back to sleep anymore, but I did realize that there was at least SOMETHING that could keep me alive.  Well, alive for the short-term anyway.  Past 6 o’clock, if nothing else.  I would have to break the clock.

Immediately, I got up off my bed and set myself onto the task of breaking the clock.  At first, I was afraid that I would make a lotta noise and wake up mom and dad.  But then I remembered that they could never hear it when the alarm went off, they could never hear it when The Sandman broke out, and they couldn’t even seem to SEE the clock at all.  And even if they DID.  Even if they DID hear me, I had bigger things to worry about.  

Surely, I was allowed to make myself into somewhat of a nuisance if it meant evading impending death.  If not then, then when else?  
So, I picked up the clock and rammed it against the floor.  It didn’t break.  That seemed surprising, since it seemed like the clock should’ve been pretty easy to break if I really wanted to.  I tried it again.  Still nothing.  But then I realized what the problem must’ve been:  The Sandman was still in my watch.  Clearly, I had to break that first.  So I tried it.  But still, I couldn’t.

I must’ve been at it for at least a good 45 minutes trying to break both my watch and the clock.  It was already 5:18 by the time I finally called it quits.  Nothing, not even attempting to break the clock, had gotten me out of what was about to happen at 6 AM.  Surely it had to be at least POSSIBLE to break the clock.  Surely Anastasia wouldn’t’ve warned me against doing it if it simply couldn’t be done.  So I figured I must’ve just been too much of a wimp.  How embarrassing.  How utterly fucking humiliating.  I was gonna die WAY before I had to, all because I had no muscle whatso-fucking-ever to speak of.

I spent the next 40 minutes or so just trying to come to terms with everything.  I was gonna die.  This was really gonna be it.  I was done for.  I was really just gonna die, and that was all there was to it.  Or, if not that, then I was still gonna be in The Sandman’s clutches until my dying days.  Which, if anything, might’ve proven even worse.  By 5:57, I took a deep breath and closed my eyes.  There was no use hiding anymore.  Even if I remained motionless under my blanket, The Sandman was gonna have his way with me either way.  I didn’t bother hiding under it by then.  All I could do now was just wait for the three minutes to pass and for it all to be over.  But that plan got somewhat foiled when I heard a voice.  A very unwelcome voice indeed.

“Hey, gooooyyy,” said Ezra’s annoying drawl.  “Ya wanna maybe NOT die today?” he said.  5:59 AM.  Just one more minute left.  As badly as I didn’t wanna put up with Ezra’s bullshit during my last minute on earth, he did at least CLAIM to have a way out.  He was probably trolling me.  Probably just having one last laugh at my expense before The Sandman finally did me in.  And god only knows how he managed to break into my house THIS time.  But given everything that was about to happen to me, I figured I had no choice but to give the guy the benefit of the doubt, just this once.  Anastasia did say he could be helpful..
