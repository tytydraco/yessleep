Hello, I’m not sure why I’m posting this I guess I just needed to get this off my chest and I could use you guys advice , I’ve been a member of this subreddit for a long time and until recently I didn’t believe any of the stories on this sub reddit I just assumed everyone else thought it was fake as well and was just playing along but after recent events you could tell me you cat is actually a alien demon from mars and I would I would hear you out.

I’m not good at telling stories but I’ll try and make this as easy to read as possible, so anyway I should probably get to talking about the hell portal in my garbage bag, which I still have though I doubt I’ll ever use it
For context I was fourteen at the time and it was the long holiday between when one year of school ended and another began and unlike the other three holidays my friends where off on vacation leaving me along with my mother for weeks on end, which is wear the previous mentioned trip to hell happened 

I first saw the portal in a dream after a heated argument with my mother where I said some things I wish I could take back, god the last thing I told my mom was to get out of my life, anyway one night I was sleeping in my bed and I had a dream that felt different 

I was fully lucid in my dream but I was knew I was dreaming I don’t know how I knew but I did, I think it was mostly little things that tipped me off, things in the wrong place extra and in that dream I don’t know why but I went into the trash and just stood there, I could’ve moved if I wanted to but I didn’t 

The best way I can describe it is like when your really invested in a good tv show but have to leave the room to do something else and you linger in the doorway for a while, eventually I started to climb into the trash when my mom throw me away from it and something pulled her in

I woke up the next morning believing it all to be just a very strange dream and went to my moms room to check on her and saw the bed empty, my heart started racing at this moment as I went to grave my phone and call her

But when I made it to the phone I found my moms right next to it, I panicked realising my mom wouldn’t have left the house without her phone so went out back to see if she was doing yard work

It was unlikely considering the time but at that point it seemed more likely then something dragging my mom into the trash can half her size

But sadly she wasn’t there so I ran to the trash can and dug through it and found nothing, I then went back to retrieve moms phone to find it gone it, this actually filled me with hope as I thought I must of imagined moms phone being home or she was on the toilet and had left to go shopping out the front door when I was out back

My hope quickly diminished when I called it only to hear the ringing coming from the kitchen, I won’t lie and say that I immediately jump into the trash can to fight whatever beast took my mom

But I do hope you people can understand me lying to myself that my mom was just shopping and she must have left without her phone which she must have dropped into the trash

It was about a day later when I texted everyone I knew if they had seen my mom and got the same story from everyone, none of them had seen her for the past few days, I told them about the fight we had and they called the authorities to go on a manhunt for my mom

It was no use of course I knew where my mom was, I wasn’t sure what was in the trash so I put on the thickest light weight durable clothes I had and grabbed a broom and added a knife to the end a idea I had come up with when planning for a zombie apocalypse 

I eat dinner which was all the food I had left just a miss match of random meat products that didn’t require cooking and two hotdogs with no buns, sorry to any vegans reading this

Anyway after staling for a while I knew it was now or never as my grandparents where on their way to pick me up, the first thing i did was take the trash bag out of the can to figure out how the portal worked, after I figured out the portal was in the bag I put my makeshift weapon in and it went in all the way before touching a solid surface 

I then poked the stick around to see how big whatever solid ground was down there to make sure I could stand there, then I pulled the broom out and felt it, the part of it that had been inside the portal was hot and had some dust or something on it

I walked out to go grab some goggles and a Halloween mask to cover my face, it I sat  down next to the bag and threw my legs in lowering my shelf till I could touch the ground with just my head poking out

I took a deep breath and pulled my head down into the portal and felt the dust like stuff hit my uncovered ears and it you’ve ever burned plastic then you know the feeling of tiny hit particles hitting you face and going down you lungs

After I had grown accustomed to the feeling I looked around and there’s no easy way of saying this but I was in hell, red hot rocks, fire and the distinct smell of something burning

I quickly realised that I could reach the portal and pull myself up quickly if I had to which as you will see I had to, after a few seconds I looked down from the platform I was perched on to see a tunnel with what I can only guess are imps, I’m not too familiar with demon lore and stuff most of what I know is from doom and hellava boss and other post on this subreddit

They were a little smaller then me and had horns and a tale and looked like a mix between the imps from doom and their more cartoony interpretations 

After my eyes adjusted so I could see better I saw what I now know as a succubous (I’m not sure how to spell it but don’t google it unless you want to see more rule 34 then the chica has) but anyway what you need to know is this demon looked like the most beautiful girl I could imagine and as a hormonal teenager I tried to move closer to get a better look but when I did I saw what she was  nibbling on and swore out loud

She was eating some poor basted’s private parts and my swearing at normal speaking volume was enough to get all the demons down there’s attention, I almost immediately jumped up and out of the portal landing hard on the tiled kitchen floor

I sighed a breath of relief but the things weren’t done with as the sucubis grabbed my leg and began pulling my back, a friend of mine who’s mom was a religious nut saw me and thanks to her and her obsession with the Annabelle franchise I’m able to post this

Me and her then closed the trash bag and tired it shut with her necklace that had the cross on it, I thought about throwing the back into the garbage bin but leaving a unattended portal to hell didn’t sit right with me

After a short stay with my grandparents I moved in to my one of my friends house and brought the trash with me him being a huge believer in the paranormal didn’t question it

Me and a couple friends are planning on opening it up again and going in crosses and holy water guns blazing to retrieve my moms remains, if anyone knows anything that could help us while we’re their now’s they time to speak up
