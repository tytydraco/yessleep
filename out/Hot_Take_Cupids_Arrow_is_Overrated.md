Ok so you know how there’s always that one hot girl in school you would give anything to be with? 

For me that was Morgan. Long legs, great curves, dreamy eyes; she knew she was sexy and so did everyone else. 

Of course I was the exact opposite, a loner and outcast at our college. The chances of us ever even laying eyes on each other was next to nonexistent. I could only be a creepy stalker and nothing more. 

Or so I thought. 

Last weekend I got an invite from one of my buds that lives upstate to spend time at his uncle’s house. I haven’t seen him in quite a while and he said that we would have the place all to ourselves. His uncle was going out of the country for business and wouldn’t be back for a whole month. The weekend was one of the few times I had time to get away from college so I took him up on the offer and drove up there. 

One thing that I always really liked about the house was that his uncle didn’t really lock up the liquor cabinet. He had so much variety that I knew if we drank a few bottles he wouldn’t be able to tell. 

After a few such drinks, Rob and I started shooting the shit and that eventually led to talking about our body count. At first I tried to act macho and claim I was getting laid all the time but Rob saw through that charade. 

That led me to sulking and drinking even more. 

“What you need to do is be more like my uncle here. You see these all elaborate items and trophies from around the world? That’s because he didn’t just sit around and mope. He actually changed his life,” my friend told me. 

The different relics and artifacts that adorned his walls were impressive. They were a window view  to a life that I never got to have. 

It just made me angry and frustrated, thinking that I was wasting precious time. I tossed the bottle I was drinking toward the fireplace mantle, but I misjudged my throw and it hit one of the items causing it to fall on the floor. 

It was a bow made of strange sinew and wood, with what looked like rubies and bone encrusted along its sides. There were two arrows, one of lead and another of gold that also fell to the ground and when I saw it I was immediately intrigued.

“What is this thing?” I asked, picking up the bow and getting a good look at it. 

“I don’t know man, like I said my uncle collects a lot of weird shit,” Rob said with a shrug. 

“These markings look like they are Roman or something don’t you think?” I said, trying to figure out what it meant. I had studied a few of the classics during my first college semester. 

“I think that’s the symbol of the heart, and that’s the symbol of desire,” he said pointing toward the one that looked like a dolphin. 

A few things clicked into my head and I asked, “Do you think this is supposed to be a model of Cupid’s bow or something?”

A door slammed behind us and both of us jumped. I dropped the bow immediately when I saw that his uncle had returned unexpectedly. 

“What it is, is not yours. I think you would know better than to touch other people’s property,” he growled as he marched over and snapped the bow up, placing it carefully back on the mantle. 

“Uncle…! I’m so sorry…” Rob was blubbering like an idiot. 

“I don’t want to hear it boy. Just pour me a drink, I’ve had a long trip,” he said as he relaxed into my chair. 

My eyes never left the bow, a dark curiosity filling my soul. I needed to know more about it and I had a plan to do exactly that. 

We sat down and offered him some of the strongest whiskey and I started to ask about some of the other trophies, their origins and how he’d obtained them. 

Once he was sufficiently drunk, I focused back on the bow. 

“Is it really designed to make someone fall in love with you?” I asked. 

His eyes were hazy and dark and he mumbled about how it was cursed. “That is how I loved quite a few women. It will make them have such a passion for you that you’ll not walk straight for days!” he declared. 

My eyes brightened and sparkled, thinking of only one woman. Morgan. 

When his uncle passed out, I told Rob what I wanted to do. 

“I’ll just borrow this, temporarily. I want to see if what he says is really true,” I told him. 

“Dude are you crazy? If my uncle finds out you took his stuff, he’ll go ballistic on me,” he snapped back. 

“Is he really going to notice though? I mean he’s got so much other shit here. One thing going missing shouldn’t be a big deal.” 

Rob sighed. “Let me get him out of the house. Then you double back and take it. I can figure out an excuse. But you better bring it right back you hear me?”

I promised I would and we set our plan into motion. Rob drove his uncle into town to handle errands and I pretended that I was returning to the college campus. 

Once I was sure they were down the road, I went back up to the house and snuck in through the garage. When I got to the bow, I held it next to me and felt an overwhelming power surge through my body. 

This was going to make me a very happy man, I thought selfishly. 

I put it in the trunk of my car and hurried to campus. 

For the next twenty four hours I puzzled over how to make sure I could fire the arrow at Morgan. It wasn’t exactly something I could do in broad daylight. 

Then I remembered that she liked to go to the school gym late at night sometimes and so I stashed the bow in my backpack and went there. 

As luck would have it her and a few of her friends were doing a workout together. I tried to remain inconspicuous. It was late so naturally they noticed me because there wasn’t anyone else there in the gym. We made a little small talk and her friends announced they were heading for the showers. I told Morgan I could be her spotter for a few lifts. 

“Sure why not?” she said with a perky smile. It was so beautiful. 

As she laid down on the bench I dropped my bag next to it and pretended to get everything in place. Once she started lifting the weights I felt my heart pounding as I realized now was the opportunity I’d been waiting for. 

I reached down to my bag, telling her I needed to grab a watch to time her; and took out the bow. She was distracted, her back to me. I strung the arrow of gold against the bow, watching as she powerlifted in front of me. God she was so perfect. How could I resist her? 

She turned to me, asking if I was ok; and her eyes widened when she saw the strange contraption. I took that moment to pull back the bow and let the arrow fly. 

It struck her straight into the heart and I held my breath. Her eyes got as big as dinner plates as she clutched her chest. The arrow had gone in deep. My own heart dropped as she fainted to the floor and I frantically ran to her side. 

What if I had miscalculated Rob’s uncle’s story and just killed the girl I was in love with? Would I go to jail? I tried to pull the arrow out; but to my surprise it sunk deeper into her flesh. Her skin burned and she screamed for help, but the gym was empty save for the two of us. 

Then I watched as the arrow began to dissolve, melting straight into her body. She shook violently, gasping for air as she tried to scratch at me. Then she became very still. 

I held her close, watching for signs of life. Cracks formed amid her wound, splintering across her upper chest that I could see like wildfire. 

Behind me somewhere I heard her friends chattering. They were almost back to the main floor. What if they saw her like this? 

Abruptly Morgan’s eyes bolted open and she locked her gaze with me. 

At the same time her friends stepped out of the shower and saw me crouched to the side, and asked me what the heck I was doing. 

Before I could fumble a flimsy excuse, Morgan grabbed my face between her hands and kissed me passionately. 

My heart fluttered in shock. I was so surprised by it I didn’t even know how to respond. 

As the kiss ended she gasped for air and then mumbled an apology. “Sorry… I don’t know what came over me,” she admitted as she sat up and felt her heart. 

“What just happened?” her friends asked. 

“We were doing some squats and Morgan got lightheaded… I had to do some cpr when she passed out..” I scratched the back of my neck sheepishly. “I tried to call out for help but I guess the showers were too loud.” 

Morgan confirmed she was fine and stood up, brushing her clothes and looking a bit confused. 

“Are you okay?” I asked her. 

She nodded, unable to stop looking at me. 

“Hey… it’s uh… Trent right?” she asked as she got her gym bag. 

“Trenton, but yeah you can call me Trent,” I said. 

“Thanks… um. I feel like I should repay you somehow… can I get your number?” 

I was trying my best to not grin ear to ear and offered it to her. 

All of us left the gym together and I noticed Morgan’s ride hadn’t shown up so I took a risk and offered her one. 

To her friends surprise she accepted. 

As we drove back to the dorm, I saw she kept staring at me. 

“Something on my face?” I asked. 

“I think I know how I want to repay you,” she said seductively and then reached over to my pants zipper. 

Before I knew what was happening she took my dick out and started stroking it as i drove down the road. 

I was at a loss for words, watching as the girl of my dreams gave me road head. 

By the time we got back to the dorm, I was ready for round two. And she gladly accepted. 

That night, I scored big with her. It was wild, it was raw; and I was on cloud nine. 

In the morning while Morgan slept in my bed I called Rob excitedly to tell him the good news. 

“Well, I’m glad that worked out for ya bro. So when you gonna return the bow?” 

I promised I would that same day after class. It would be a long drive but I didn’t want his uncle to find it missing or I would be in hot water. 

We met about halfway to the property to save time and when I passed him the bow and arrow he asked me why there was still an arrow left. 

“I used the gold one. I don’t know what that’s for,” I admitted. 

Rob shook his head, still a bit perplexed that the legendary bow had worked. 

“I guess you’re gonna have quite the Valentine’s Day tomorrow huh?” he chuckled. 

I laughed and smiled, thinking of more wild sex with Morgan. Than I remembered I had a bunch of school work to finish. 

“That shit can wait man. You better make Valentine’s count,” Rob argued. 

“What do I need to do that for though? Morgan is mine. I can have her anytime I want her,” I told him. 

“Whatever bro,” was his only response. Maybe he was a little jealous at my new love life. 

I drove back home and got straight to finishing my papers. Morgan had already gone home, although I did see she shot me about twenty texts asking when we could hook up again. 

It was everything I wanted and more. 

But I’m sure you must have guessed by now it didn’t last. 

Valentine’s Day came and I focused on school just like I said I would. It wasn’t easy. Morgan kept telling me she wanted to sneak out and do something. But I was so busy I forgot to even text her back. 

I was so sure that I didn’t need to even do anything anymore, that I just let it all slip by. 

That led to today. 

I woke up and reached for my phone, expecting a lovey dovey message like usual. 

Instead there was nothing. Except one call from Rob. 

I listened to the voicemail. 

“Hey man… uh so my uncle told me he knew the bow was stolen all along and said some weird shit that kinda has me worried. Call me when you can.” 

I called him back, walking to my dorm window to get some fresh air. 

“Trenton, hey. How are things with Morgan?” he asked. 

“I mean… I haven’t gotten a chance to see her since Tuesday but it’s great. So what’s going on?” I asked. There was tension in his voice. 

“Listen; my uncle said some stuff about that bow last night that has me thinking you made a mistake. Something about love will go sour if unkindled, he said the dreams of your heart will ultimately become your nightmare,” Rob said. 

“What? What is that supposed to mean?” I asked as I grabbed some cigarettes and looked down to where I parked my car. 

Then I saw that someone had smashed it up with a baseball bat, the windows shattered and the tires flat. 

“Hey Rob, I’ll call you back,” I said, hanging up the phone. I ran downstairs to get a better look. 

“Jesus Christ,” I said as I got to the other side of the car and saw whoever the vandal was had scratched a word into the passenger side door. 

In big bold letters it read PERV

Was it one of Morgan’s friends, upset that we were now sleeping around?

Did she have a boyfriend I didn’t know about?

Then I heard a noise from behind me and I turned to see her driving up toward my dorm in her corvette. 

I smiled; a bit relieved to see her at first. Then I realized she wasn’t slowing down. 

And her car was heading straight for me. 

As I realized she was throttling the vehicle toward me I ran to the house, just barely jumping out of the way as she spun her vehicle around in our dorm parking lot. 

I slammed the door to our dorms and tried to calm down. What the heck just happened?

I heard the car die and she shouted my name. 

“Trent we need to talk!!” she yelled. 

I felt her try to open the door but I held it shut, demanding she offer an explanation. “Why did you just try to run me over??” 

“Why?? Why?? Excuse me?? You fucking idiot you know why!” she screamed as she kicked at the door. 

Behind me several of the other guys at the dorm saw what was going on and pushed me out of the way to let her in. 

Morgan looked different now, angrier than I had ever seen her and hellbent on trying to punch me in the jaw. 

“How the hell could you forget valentines?” she snarled as she picked up something and tossed it to my head. 

“It was an honest mistake!” I told her. 

The guys in the hallway were laughing at first and then she pulled a Glock out of her yoga pants and shot the closest one square in the face. 

Abruptly the mood changed to one of terror as we ran to the next room, immediately barricading it with furniture. 

“Fuck! That bitch is crazy. What the heck did you do to her Trent?!” one guy asked as we heard Morgan start banging on doors and firing bullets randomly. 

“She’ll run out of ammo soon,” another guy reasoned. 

A second later a sharp blade smashed through the door and struck him straight in the back. She had grabbed one of the medieval swords from our display at the front, brandishing it as a weapon. 

I scrambled toward the back door as she pushed her way through. 

“Trenton don’t you dare fucking run from me!” I heard her shout as I made it to the car garage. 

My mind was racing. I needed to get out of there before she killed me. My first thought was to get back to Rob’s uncle. He would surely know a way to stop this. 

As I ran; I heard Morgan cooing my name. It sounded exactly like when we had slept together. 

“Come on Trenton, don’t be shy. I just want to have some more fun,” her voice echoed as I hid behind one of the cars. She was still carrying the medieval sword, waiting for me to slip up. Despite how sweet and sultry she sounded I knew it was a lie. The Morgan that had briefly desired me was replaced with a yandere psycho. 

I heard a car alarm buzz behind me and jolted my head to see another guy returning to the dorm. 

“I need to your car!” I said to him the moment I knew Morgan was out of sight. 

“Dude. Who the heck are you?” 

I grabbed at his keys and he just pushed me back, angry for the sudden outburst. 

“Lay off dude before I drop you,” he barked. 

“Trenton are you still running?” Morgan said from the next aisle over. She was heading our way. 

“Please, I'm begging you! That bitch is going to kill me!” 

The jock looked confused, laughing when he saw Morgan marching toward us. 

“Is this some kind of lover’s spat? Count me out,” he said as he began to walk away. 

I dove and tackled him to the ground, wrestling the keys from his fingers. At the same time I saw Morgan about to impale me and used the jock as a human shield. 

Pushing him on top to take the brunt of the stab, I crawled away as he gagged for air. Morgan screamed in frustration as I ran to his car. 

I switched to drive and got out of there without looking back. 

I knew she would be hot on my heels. Less than a mile down the road I heard the roar of her corvette. She was going to run me off the damn road. 

I swerved and tried to call Rob, but Morgan was already right on my bumper. We had to going at least ninety down the Highway. 

She finally got right next to me and jerked her car hard trying to make me lose control. 

I jerked my steering wheel back just as hard, trying to get her off my side. I saw a passing diesel truck and knew this might be my only chance. 

I did the same maneuver, forcing Morgan toward oncoming traffic. She had little choice but to run her vehicle off the road. In my rearview mirror I saw her peel into the grass. 

I had a head start now. But I knew it wouldn’t be enough to stop her madness. Terrified of what would happen if she did catch me, I sped to the manor. 

When I got there I didn’t see any signs that Rob’s uncle was even at home but I didn’t care. I started banging on doors wherever I could, desperate for help. 

Finally one of them opened and the old man looked at me scornfully. He knew why I was there. 

“Love’s sting has turned on you eh?” he said knowingly. I pushed past him, frantically searching for the bow. 

“You have to help me reverse this shit. She’s going to kill me!” I begged him. 

“And it’ll be what you deserve for toying with fate. Selfish and arrogant you thought such magic would get you true love. Don’t you see the folly of your ways?” he scoffed. 

“Look old man I don’t give a damn about a moral lesson right now, I need that bow!” I said shoving him into the wall. 

Then I saw it, hidden away in the corner of the den. I ran to it, but halfway across the room I heard the doorbell. 

“Don’t answer that,” I told him. Rob’s uncle didn’t even care what I had to say, he let Morgan in with a smile. 

Her face was a picture of pure evil. Her hair was crazy and her eyes full of tears and blood. 

I grabbed the bow and pointed it at her. I placed the arrow of lead into the strings and let it fly as she plunged for me. She tackled me to the ground, the arrow going straight through her heart. 

Blood trickled from her mouth as she looked down at me, the tears in her eyes turning a muddy brown. 

She straddled me and shook like a doll again, the lead infecting her quickly as she fell unconscious. 

I lay still, unsure what would happen next. 

Morgan returned to life again, looking confused about the past few hours and then staring at me. 

“Trenton?? What the fuck are you doing?”

She crawled away from me in disgust, standing up and looking around. “Where the hell am I?” 

I kicked the bow away before she could see it and tried to think of an apology or excuse that would make all of this go away. The uncle had a solution that made me turn pale as a ghost. 

“Your friends drugged you and raped you. They used my house to do it. I was fortunate enough to catch them before they tried anything else,” he snarled. 

Morgan looked at me, appalled at that statement. 

I couldn’t deny that was somewhat accurate given the past few days. 

“And to think, I was just starting to like you,” she said, spitting in my face and leaving. 

My day ends with a few more bottles of wine and regret. I foolishly thought I had found an easy way to love. But it was meaningless. I barely survived and now will face the consequences forever. 

Even if I had kept the charade going I know it wouldn’t have been real.

I keep staring at that bow and thinking of how I could use it to end my own life. I deserve to die honestly, after what I did to Morgan. 

But no. That would be the cowards way out. 

I’ll leave this here as a warning. Don’t make the mistakes I did with love. 

There is no magic recipe.
