Growing up we all know this feeling, watching tv as a kid and laughing as you see what happens on the screen and thinking to yourself "Now that **CAN'T** happen." And things were no different when it comes to me, being a 25 year old guy living with my parents I still watch horror vids of creepy internet stories and just laugh about them with that thought playing in my mind as i do.

All i really do right now is workout at the local gym across from me, and play video games at home as i wait to hear back form an assisted job program as being disabled makes it hard for me to find the job. And it was a normal Friday, just heading out to the gym stopping at my friend's house ~~kidnapping,~~ picking my best friend from back in highschool up to drag him to the gym with me, I'll call him Nate for his privacy, and I'll write it how i remember it but my memory on it is already hazy as it is.

I remember pulling into the driveway of his house, a poorly made road barely qualifying as a driveway as it didn't even have gravel in it, in my parent's 2014 Veloster, seeing him on his porch but his car not there, I didn't think much of it as maybe he was letting someone borrow it as he tends to as he was just that kind of person and i walked over to him after exiting my car calling out to him. "Somethin going on man?" i asked as seeing as he didn't have his car i assumed that there was something up. And then he spoke to me, and i should've known something was up as he just sounded ever so slightly different. "Yeah my dad needed to borrow my car today what's good man?"  his voice just sounded deeper, i even remember bringing that up. "Ah shit everything alright, also man you sick or something you sound off." and after i brought it up he coughed a couple real loud and hard coughs. And simply said to me "Yeah i'm sick is all man i'll be fine, what's good man?" sounding completely normal until he repeated himself, but he did have a habit of repeating himself anytime he was sick back when i was his roommate so i didn't think nothing of it and just simply said back to him "Ah well, i was going to ask if you wanted to go work out together today but if you're sick you don't have to come." Before starting to walk back to my car turning my back to him.

And then I heard him call out. "Nah its cool man i can come its nothing to worry about." sounding off again, and i was already in my car as i looked at him following me, he certainly did looked fine, but something about how he sounded just told me he wasn't so i just rolled my windows down yelling out to him "Don't worry about it man we can always work out later." Before turning the car on and beginning to back up out his driveway. I remember that there was this split second on the rearview camera that the car came with that their was this twitch in his head, but it didn't fully register in my mind back then and he just waved to me as i backed out of his driveway, and drove on the gym.

Fast forward to me being at the gym, i am running on the treadmill finishing my workout for the day and i am just running there thinking about what happened and how off Nate sounded and I sigh and say to myself "I'll just call him in the car and apologize for ditching him like that" And get off the treadmill putting the gyms stuff back before walking out and into my car then i get my phone out of my pocket and call Nate. I remember him picking up and everything he said to me, and the thoughts i still have even now of these things can't happen.

"Yo man I'm at work what's up?" He said to me and it was like my entire body was shutting down in a cold panic, every hair on my body stood up on end as i shakingly spoke out "I...weren't you sick?" Nate instantly knew something was up as he's known me for practically 15 years. "No man i'm fine, at work why what's wrong?" And i just simply stated "No, no i talked to you at your house and you said you let your dad borrow your car and that you were sick." And the silence between the two of us felt like hours, but wasn't even a minute i bet before he spoke out "You're fucking with me right?" And I felt i should lie, i felt that i needed to lie to him and say that i was else he think i'm crazy, but i didn't i just simply told him the truth. "No man i swear i talked to." i was cut off by Nate saying he was getting a call from his current roommate. "K hold up one sec Jon is calling me." he said sounding more annoyed than anything so i just sat in the parking lot with this racing around in my mind.

Five minutes later i get another call, from Nate again and i pick up the phone still shaken "What?" was all i managed to say before i heard Nate speak, more fear in his voice than he ever has shown to me in his entire life as he simply said to me. "Jon says he hears you and me out on the porch..." and we were just left thinking the same thing i hope, that these things don't happen.
