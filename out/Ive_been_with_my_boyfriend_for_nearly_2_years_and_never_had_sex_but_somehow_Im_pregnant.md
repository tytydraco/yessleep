 

I first met Jake at the gym I worked in as a personal trainer, he had asked me to recommend a workout routine. He told me it was his first time in the gym, but I knew he was lying by his physique; you don’t get a six pack like that sitting on the couch all day playing call of duty, like he insisted he had been doing. I just played along and gave him advice anyways, he tried flirting with me, but I kept it professional, and he soon got the message and left me alone.  

About a week later he came back asking me to take him on as a client, apparently, I was recommended to him by a friend. Usually, I would be happy to take on a new client, but something just felt off about this guy. Don’t get me wrong, he was charming and easy to look at. But every time I looked in his eyes, I felt a shiver go through me; his eyes were so dark that from a distance they looked completely black, it was unnatural.  

I told him I had too much on and recommended another trainer, George. He was very understanding even though I am sure that he knew I was a little creeped out by him. I was convinced he was only trying to pick up women and I didn’t actually think he was going to take my advice, but he did, and he started to come to the gym, almost every day. It didn’t take long for him to find out I wasn’t as busy as I stated to him previously. Which was a little embarrassing. 

To make it worse Jake became best friends with George, which made things more awkward since George and I hung out in the same circles, so I saw Jake a lot. At first, I tried to avoid talking to him and when I did, I was only giving him one-word answers. But he made it hard to keep it up, he always tried to make me laugh by making these stupid jokes, and it worked. I nearly wet myself every time I was around him. I think that's what first attracted me to him, we both had the same silly since of humour.  

It didn’t take long before we became friends, then one drunken night, one thing led to another, and we became more then friends, we have been dating ever since. He has been an amazing partner; I could talk to him about anything, and he always knew what to say to make me feel better. Even when I was having, how do I say it... Having my diva moments and being a real handful, he was so patient. Plus, he never forgot anniversaries or birthdays, and gave the most thoughtful gifts, it's like he knew what I wanted before I did. 

But we did have some issues, first of all he refused to tell me anything about his life before we met. Most of the time I respected his privacy, but every now and then it would get to me, and we would fight over it, usually ending with him walking out before things got too heated. I thought he might have been in prison and was ashamed of it, I didn’t care if he was, I just wanted to know the truth. The Jake I knew was a good person and deserved a second chance anyways. 

Oh yea, there was the other little problem; he didn’t want to have sex, at all. Well, he said he did, but he was waiting for the right time. Another problem that he didn’t want to talk about. I often wondered if it had something to do with his past, maybe he came from a religious background, or even a cult, which would explain a lot. But he never showed any signs of being religious in any way. In fact, quite the opposite, he was big into science and technology, you wouldn’t believe the amount of documentaries he made me sit through. 

He loved everything on the discovery channels, from how it's made, to blue planet, soo boring. Other than that, he was very easy going, never watched sports or stayed out late with his friends and never refused to take me out whenever I asked him to, even when it interfered with his own plans. He was the best partner anyone could ask for. 

The only thing he felt really strongly about was having children. Which didn’t make any since as I told him a thousand times, “You need to have sex to have kids.”  

“Soon baby” he’d reply, “just please, trust me,” If I tried to pressure him, he would just get upset and walk away and I’d end up feeling bad. 

Despite everything he kept planning our unborn child's future. I never understood why, even if we did have a sex life, I certainly didn’t want children. But I didn’t tell him that, I thought by the time we got around to it, I might have changed my mind. 

The weeks leading up to my shocking news, I started noticing strange occurrences around the house; like footsteps in the hallway outside our room in the middle of the night or whispering coming from the walls. One night I woke up, and Jake was in the corner of the room having a full-blown conversation with himself.  

The next morning at breakfast I told him what I saw, he laughed, “I was probably sleep walking, it used to happen a lot when I was a kid.” He then stuffed his face with a piece of toast and walked out. The weird thing was he didn’t even tell me where he was going, he mumbled, “Back soon love you, bye,” as he nearly broke his neck trying to get out the door. 

At the time I had no reason to be suspicious, I was thinking he was just embarrassed to talk about it, so I left it off. But as the days went by he started acting more peculiar; he was always staring at me with this weird grin on his face like he wanted to tell me something. But when I'd look over at him he would turn away nervously. When I asked him about it, he said, “Looking at you just makes me happy.” How could I argue with that. 

It was only when I found him standing over me while I was sleeping one night, that I began to worry. Another night I woke up drenched in sweat and dying with the thirst, he was sitting in front of me with a glass of water in his hand, “Here” he said shoving the glass in my face. 

I was half asleep and didn’t take much notice of it until the next day, he was gone to work and by the time he got home I had forgotten about it. Besides I was starting to get used of his weird habits by then and didn’t take any notice. 

The day before I was due to go to the doctors for a routine check-up Jake was acting strange, well... stranger than usual; he couldn’t sit down, he was pacing over and back the living room all day. When I asked him about it, he said he was just worried about me. I told him there was nothing to worry about it was just a routine appointment. But he wouldn’t listen. I don’t think he slept that night either, every time I woke, he was sitting up staring at me. 

Despite all the weird things that were happening I had no idea that anything was wrong. So, when the doctor told me I was pregnant, I thought he was joking.  Ironically when I told him I didn’t have sex, he thought I was joking and laughed it off. When I realized he was actually being serious I nearly died and was too embarrassed to say any more about it. I don’t remember much after that, I was in a daze; I don’t even remember getting to the car. 

The whole way home I was freaking out trying to think of a way to explain it to Jake that didn’t make me seem like a psychopath. I had hundreds of questions going around in my head, like, what would he think of me? Would he leave me?. By the time I got home I was bawling my eyes out, begging him to believe me when I told him I didn’t have sex with anyone. 

The fucked-up thing was, he wasn’t the least bit surprized by the news; I was expecting him to accuse me of cheating, instead, he was crying with happiness.  

When I asked him how this could have happened, all he replied was, “It's a miracle, can’t we just leave it at that.” I was in shock, who was this man? 

I knew instantly he had done something to me, there was no one else it could it be. So that night when he was sleeping, I packed what I could and left. I didn’t even know where I was going, I just got in the car and started driving.  

The whole time I went over everything in my head to try make since of it all, “Could he have done something to me while I was sleeping, or even drugged me. Had I drunk too much one night and just not remembered having sex. But if we did” I thought, “surely he would have said something to me about it. Unless it wasn’t with him, Jesus I hope not.” But the more I tried to figure out what was happening the more confused I got. 

Before I knew it, it was morning, and I was lost. So, I pulled in at this little motel at the edge of a forest, called Harry’s to ask directions. It wasn’t opened, but there was a sign saying ring the buzzer and wait, so I did. But no one came, so I went back to the car, when I turned the key, nothing happened; the battery was completely dead. I didn’t know what to do, that was the first place I had seen for miles and there were no cars on the road. If I had known the hell that was waiting for me in there, I would have walked away, left my car and never looked back.  

But instead, I went back to the office. This time the door was opened and there was a small elderly woman smiling at me from behind the counter. “Here you go miss, its cabin 11” she said leaving a set of keys on the counter, “now what time will your partner be joining you?” 

“Oh no. You must have me confused with someone else ma’am” I replied in a panic. “I am alone, my car broke down, I was wondering could I use your phone, please?” 

“Let me double check” she opens her book and puts on her reading glasses, “I got a reservation for a miss Marie Conway, and a note saying, ‘car broke down and you're waiting on a mechanic. You are miss Conway, right?” 

“Yes.” 

“And that is your car outside there in the parking lot?” 

“Yes but...” 

“Look miss Conway, the car will be picked up tonight like my husband said on the phone, but it will probably be tomorrow before its fixed, it being a Sunday and all. I don’t think you have much of a choice but to stay, unless you want to wait in your car.” 

Fine I said angrily, "Can you at least tell me who rang?”  

“I am not sure who rang about the car this morning my husband answered the phone, but the reservations were made at 9 o clock yesterday morning.”  

“But by who?” I said in frustration. 

“By you of course I answered the phone myself. Now look miss Conway, I need to do my morning rounds, I will show you to your room on the way if you’d like?” 

I didn’t know what to say, she had to be lying; I didn’t even know I was pregnant at that time, never mind plan on staying in that shit hole. “It must be Jake” I thought, “he must have known I was coming here and somehow convinced her to lie about it. It had to be, or else I am losing my mind.” After finding out the truth, I would prefer the latter.
