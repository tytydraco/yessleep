I live in a small town in western Colorado. There’s a rule every single person follows here: Our curfew. The alive ones do at least.

**May - August Curfew: 9 PM**

**September - April Curfew: 6 PM**

For the longest time I thought it was dumb. Stores, bars, and even gas stations were closed before the curfew. So, it’s not like there were a lot of reasons to stay out that late anyway. Who was enforcing it? I’m not entirely sure. Cop cars would patrol the streets thirty minutes prior to the curfew, offering rides home to anybody who, otherwise, wouldn’t make it home in time. But they, too, were home before the curfew was fully in effect.

Regretfully, it’s not dumb. It actually makes a lot of sense. I just wish I had believed someone when they told me why the curfew was enforced.

I moved here a few years ago to get a change of pace. I edit videos for a big youtuber, and most of my time is spent holed up in my house, so location isn’t wholly important for my work as long as I have a decent WiFi connection. I saw a listing for a house up here and always loved the mountains, so I thought *why not*. 

I won’t disclose specifically where I live for the sake of idiots on the internet stalking me, but it’s really pretty here. Large, evergreen pine trees stretch across the mountains and loom stoically over the edge of cliff faces as you traverse the winding roads desperately dodging whitetail deer crossing the road. Occasionally, you’ll find a cluster of aspen trees with pale green leaves that shimmer like sequins in the wind. The only sign of fall is the temperature dropping, and the aspens changing from their calming green to fierce tones of red, yellow, and orange, like a fire had been set upon them with the sole intention of dying the leaves. Every so often, you’ll even see a black bear rummaging for snacks among the rich foliage, or hear the petrifying wail of an elk late at night. So when I learned about the strict curfew, the pros far outweighed the cons.

I made friends with a guy about my age who lived down the road from me pretty quickly after moving in. We met at one of two bars in town and found out that we liked a lot of the same video games. Within a few weeks, it became almost a ritual to meet up on the weekends, smoke a joint, and play whatever new indie party game had dropped in the Steam store.

On one of those nights, we were working through a level of UnRailed, and I decided to ask him about the strict curfew.

“Hey Calvin?” His name was Calvin.

Calvin kept his eyes on the screen, but responded with a slightly delayed “Hmm?” after his brain finally logged that I was talking to him.

“What’s up with everyone needing to be inside their homes so early at night?”

Calvin took some time to respond. One third focused on the game, one third considering my question, one third drifting towards cloud nine.

Finally, he said, “Honestly… man, I don’t know. Like, there’s probably a reason. Maybe it has to do with all the sudden disappearances that happened, like… ten years ago or something.” 

Calvin then dug his hand into a bowl of Doritos sitting between us, shoving them into his mouth.

“No, that makes sense. Probably just to protect people from wildlife.” I postulated.

Calvin, still chewing, nodded his head, agreeing with my theory.

It made sense. So I stuck to it. There wasn’t really much else to consider. It’d be weird if it was some eldritch horror haunting the mountains looking for any poor soul too clueless to know not to be out late at night. 

Over the next year or so, only a few people went missing, so my theory was only further confirmed by this. I assumed that they were out too late at night, happened upon a bear, and got mauled to death. Until Calvin came bursting into my house one day. 

Calvin shouted my name as loudly as he could, “Mark! We were wrong! MARK!!”.

I was still in my room, getting clothes on before heading to my office to work, but rushed out in only my pants when I heard the panicked tone in his words.

“Wrong about what?” I said, rifling through conversations we’d had that would incite this kind of reaction to being wrong.

“We were wrong about the bears.” Calvin said in an exhale.

Now looking at him, his eyes were bloodshot, and his hands were shaking. He looked like he had seen something that had really spooked him, and he hadn’t slept all night because of it.

Still confused, I just said, “Bears?”

“Yes, bears.”

“Dawg, I don’t know what you mean by bears.”

“Th-Th-The fucking curfew. It’s not bears attacking people. When it gets dark.”

I nodded my head, feigning understanding. He looked really freaked out, and I didn’t want to make him think I didn’t believe him. Calvin looked out my window towards the direction of his house, closed the curtains, and sat himself down on my couch, taking a few deep breaths to calm himself down, but they clearly weren’t working.

I ran upstairs to grab a shirt before coming back down and sitting across from him, hoping he had enough time to collect himself and tell me what it was.

Calvin began, “I took an edible last night, and got super fuckin’ hungry for specifically a chocolate-coated payday. But I didn’t realize that it was already past curfew.”

As soon as he mentioned him being high, I didn’t really give much credence to everything he told me, but I thought it important to, at least, let him tell me the rest of his tale.

“When I got there, that was when I realized the store was already closed and it was past curfew. But as I started to drive back…” Calvin’s eyes, which were originally trained on me as he spoke, darted around nervously. He even peeked out my window again.

Calvin slowly turned back to look at me, and as if there was gravity to this next sentence he added a hissing, whispery tone to his voice, “Something followed me all the way home.”

The whole time Calvin regaled me with his story, the corners of my lips were fighting to stay down. With his final sentence, I let out a chuckle, and I couldn’t keep it together any more. I burst out laughing.

“It’s not funny, Mark.” Calvin pleaded, disheartened by my disbelief in him, “This actually happened.”

“Calvin, buddy,” I said, as chuckles leaked through speech, “you were way higher than you thought you were last night. What were you doing driving high?”

Calvin, who originally had been very visibly upset, began to realize how stupid he sounded, and began to laugh with me, “Okay, yeah, but I swear I saw something.”

“Brother, you were baked,” I responded, “it was probably just tree branches or something.”

“Scariest tree branches I’ve ever seen.” Calvin added before we both burst into peals of laughter over Calvin’s story.

We laughed for a while. Calvin laughed exceptionally hard because of how tired he was. Once we got over ourselves, I let him crash on my couch, letting him catch up on sleep and then he could walk home after he was well rested.

That was the last time I ever saw Calvin.

The police came to my house after his place of work had reported that he hadn’t come in for several days and wasn’t answering his phone. They informed me that I was the last person to see him before he disappeared, but I didn’t have much information for them. The day he crashed on my couch: I was in my office late into the night. I went out on my porch for a break from the screen and a cigarette at 10pm but Calvin was already gone at that point, so I assumed he had just gone home.

I wasn’t particularly close to Calvin. We spent a lot of time on the weekends, but beyond that we didn’t know much about each other’s personal lives. I told the police about our last conversation together and the “thing” that he claimed had followed him home that night. They noted something, but showed little reaction to whether that piece of information was important or not.

The following weeks floated by. Whatever time I had, when I wasn’t editing, was spent playing video games or watching TV. Calvin’s story perpetually eating at my conscience. Had his eyes really not been playing tricks on him. Was something out there in the dark of night following those who stayed out past curfew? The more I thought about it, The more it felt like a crappy goosebumps story to scare kids into following the rules. I tried to shove the thought out of my mind and chalk the whole thing up as one big coincidence. But it never fully left the dark recesses of my mind.

I drove to town occasionally to get groceries, but other than that, I rarely used my car to get places. Which was probably why, after what happened to Calvin, I hadn’t been paying enough attention to the gas gauge on my car.

It was the middle of July, and I had just finished and sent out a video when I realized I had forgotten to go shopping earlier that day. I checked the time. 7:30. Which should have been plenty of time to run to the store, grab some food and head back home before the curfew started. I had done tons of runs like this before, and knew I had plenty of time to make it home; it was about 20 minutes for me to get to town, and 20 minutes back. As I pulled out of my driveway, I drove past Calvin’s house. The lights were all off in his house, and his car sat in his driveway. Every time I passed it, it gave me an eerie feeling. As though the house sat waiting for him to return some day. 

The sun was low in the sky, casting fiery red beams across the rocky landscape and through the towering pines. Fractal beams of light fought through the needles of the trees and splayed across the ground and onto my car as I neared town. I grabbed some bread, cheese slices, and butter, with plans for a grilled cheese while I played Powerwash Sim to unwind after the long day. Once I got back in my car, I made it about 10 minutes back to my house when it finally sputtered to a stop. For the first time in a month I looked at the gas gauge and swore.

“Fuck this shit, man. I just wanna go home.”

Pouting about how I need to be more aware of my car, I grabbed a jerry can from the trunk of my car and started the long walk to the nearest gas station, which was all the way back in town, funnily enough, next door to the grocery store. The sun had already set, but I assumed the police would understand why I was walking around so late at night, hoping they’d even give me a ride back to my car.

When I finally made it to a gas pump, the store owner was locking up, saying that I was his last customer, and should fill up and then head home as soon as possible. I thanked him for letting me know and I filled the jerry can as full as I could. It held enough gas that I could drive home, and then take it back to the gas station in the morning. I wasn’t so lucky to see any officers patrolling near where I was as I filled up, and resigned to making the walk back myself, praying I didn’t have any unfortunate meetings with the wildlife. 

The walk was long, and boring. I used my phone flashlight to see where I was going, and watched time tick further and further past the curfew with nothing out of the ordinary happening. By the time I finally made it back to my car I was just relieved to go home. It was only when I poured the gas into my tank and shut the cover when I started to hear the sound of hooves clopping. As it grew louder I realized they were not the cloven hooves of a deer, but bare feet slapping on the ground.

Running. Growing louder. Running towards me.

I jumped in as fast as I could. I quickly started the car and accelerated with my pedal pressed to the floor of the car. No longer caring about the little gas I had put in my car. I’d walk the full way back to the gas station as long as I could get away from whatever was coming for me. My heart was practically beating out of my chest. The winding roads did not lend me the luxury of going fast, unfortunately. I was experienced with the treacherous path, but driving full speed was a death sentence. I assumed I had already put enough space between me and whatever was chasing me. But I wished with everything in me that I was just already home. My eyes were fixed on the road the whole time, too afraid to look behind me. Yet, as I drove, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was peering at me from the passenger window. With only a few minutes till I made it home, I glanced to my right and nearly veered my car off the road. It didn’t react at all to my acknowledgment of it. It simply stared back, keeping pace with my car.

Stare is an inadequate description of what exactly it was doing. It didn’t have any eyes to stare with. They were simply two black spots on its white circle for a face, with one slightly large hole for its mouth. It seemed almost as if it wore a mask, but the spots were neither holes nor painted on. They blended like shadows into the white circle which, in turn, blended into its thin and otherwise featureless body.

The worst part, however, was how it moved. The thin road provided just enough space for two cars, so the thing was clambering beside me on the shoulder of that road. Which was cluttered with rocks and the occasional small tree. These meant nothing to the thing. It clambered around, through, and between in an impossible manner, all of which was completely inaudible to me over the rumbling of my car’s engine. Its head stayed perfectly still the whole time, keeping its empty eyes trained on me, never moving an inch forward or back, and never rotating. Like a camera on the end of a gimbal.

I would have driven the whole night, but while I was terrified of it, I was also acutely aware of how much gas I had in my car. So, regretfully, I resigned to pulling into my driveway, parking the car, making sure the doors were locked, and killing the engine. The thing stayed in my window the whole time.

After several agonizing minutes of it staring at me, I saw the thing’s head slowly retreat downwards. After it had fully disappeared from sight, it made a new noise. A deep, empty, sloshing noise. Like liquid in a very large can. While it looking at me sent horrific chills in every direction along my spine, I hated even more that I couldn’t see it, but I was completely petrified with fear, thus I made no effort to see where it had gone.

The hours were long, fear caught in my throat the entire time. I felt like I would be trapped in my car forever, hearing that terrible slow sloshing from the horror outside my car. As the sun rose, the sloshing sound faded away. I waited many more hours before even attempting to peek through my car window to see if the thing was still there. But there was nothing. I opened the car door slowly, preparing to close it as soon as I saw a hint of movement, praying I could close it faster than it could grab me, but again, there was nothing. I stumbled, exhausted, out of my car and into my house. Sleep was tearing at my eyes and body, and I wanted nothing more than to sleep forever now that the thing had finally left. I crashed into my bed, and was asleep before my head even hit the pillow.

As I awoke, the sun had fallen again. I slept through the entire day, and it had returned to night once more. The clock beside my bed read 9:00. I rolled out of bed, and decided that I should just edit for a little while and then sleep some more. I walked towards my office and decided to look out my window facing the driveway. Some morbid curiosity pulled at me to see if everything I had experienced the night before was just a nightmare brought about by sleep deprivation and lack of socialization. 

My car remained in the place I had parked it the night before, I made a mental note to remember to go to the gas station tomorrow but the thought was cut short, and I felt my blood turn to ice. 

Curled up beneath my car, its thin body almost flat to the ground, was a hollow, black gaze from a white face looking back at me.
