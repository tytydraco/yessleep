The Death Parade

The Metropolis shimmered in the heat of late afternoon, streets alive with murmurs and distant music from A parade. A boy clutched his grandfather’s hand, peering down avenues that seemed to stretch endlessly.
“Don’t go,” the old man said, voice low and wary. “The parade it will take you, and you will not return the same.”
The boy nodded, but his curiosity tore at him. When the old man’s back was turned, he slipped away, drawn to the glittering chaos that shimmered like a promise in the distance.
At first, it seemed like a grand festival. The leader came skipping through the streets, tall and radiant, in a suit stitched with gold and silver threads. He waved and smiled, calling to anyone who would follow. The people did, as if his beauty alone were reason enough to abandon caution. Behind him, the drums began — loud, irregular, and insistent. They pounded over the city, drowning out voices of reason, covering screams in their rhythm. The boy’s heart raced; the noise was a thrill.
Soon, the clowns appeared, one in red, one in blue with red noses and grinning maliciously ear to ear. They bickered and smacked one other with mallets, tossing pies in spectacular arcs. The crowd roared, choosing sides, laughing at the fuede, forgetting that the streets beneath their feet were trembling with A unspoken threat.
Above them, ropes stretched endlessly into the sky. Rope swingers twirled and leapt, impossibly graceful, shining with luck and skill. Beside them, hanged men swung silently, lifeless, and cold, their faces a mirror of those who had tried and failed. The boy’s eyes widened. One was enough to shock him awake ; ten would have terrified him, but hundreds—hundreds swayed above him in mute warning.
And then the giants came. Inflatables: elephant, donkey, bull, bear, and a golden dragon. They loomed over the crowd, immense and silent, carrying power and mass. The city seemed microscopic beneath them, insignificant. The crowd cheered, craning their necks, laughing, clapping. Few noticed the danger in their size, the shadows they cast on the buildings, or the trembling windows.
On stages moving through the streets, dancers spun, their bodies illuminated and hypnotic, ever in motion. Their rhythm pulled at hearts and eyes alike. The boy’s stepped closer, drawn toward the spectacle, away from the warnings that lingered in memory.
Candy falls from above. Children scrambled, claws and fists meeting for the smallest, sweetest morsels. Some of the children taken — whisked into the stage by faceless men and vanished into rooms that smelled of metal and fear. Never to be seen again.
Above it all, the mayor of the grat Metropolis sat in a purple chair, a grotesque monument himself. His blue suit strained across his girth, a red tie stained and smeared with spills, a button screaming VOTE over his heart. He waved and chewed and gorged, stuffing more slop into his mouth as he drooling down at the people, as if the city itself was his meal.
The Mob appeared, eyes glowing yellow. They ran through the streets, hurling fire and glass, smashing whatever dared to stand in their path. People screamed, but the drums, the dancers, the rope swingers, the leader—they all made it part of the fun.
Slowly, a terrible change came. Faces in the crowd twisted; eyes flared yellow. Hands once innocent became claws. People joined the rabid Mob, racing and jumping, screaming and tearing. The inferno leaping higher. Glass shattered against buildings, against bodies. The cameraman ran, filming everything, but even he was swallowed, leaving only screams and flickering light behind.
The inflatables began to fail. The bear slumped first, hissing and collapsing, crushing streets beneath it. The bull followed, a groaning leviathan, then the donkey and elephant sagged, their forms deflating with pitiful finality. The city trembled and broke.
Only the dragon remained. It rose above the ruins surveying the devastation. It grew larger, heavier, floating impossibly, untouchable. Below, the Metropolis burned: streets melted, towers toppled, the boy and all he had followed devoured in flame.
 In the clouds, the dragon watched, immense and eternal. Its gaze glowed brighter than the fires it overlooked, the only witness to the ruins of a Metropolis that had danced willingly into its own destruction.
