My husband Sean and I drove from Seattle to visit Glacier National Park.

“This here is God’s country, boys,” said a park ranger we met on the trail.

“Here we go,” muttered Sean under his breath.

“It’s beautiful,” I said. “Just the escape we needed.”

“Yesiree,” he said, resting his hands on his hips as he admired the scenery. “Hand painted by the Lord himself.”

Sean scoffed and I nudged him with an elbow.

“You okay there, son?” asked the ranger.

“I’m fine,” said Sean. “It’s just you can’t be serious, right?”

“Sean!” I said like a nagging parent.

The ranger held up a hand. “It’s okay, son. I’m a firm believer of folks believing what they want to believe.”

“As are we,” I said. “Right Sean?”

“Absolutely,” said Sean. “So, you believe all of this was made by a big man who lives up there?”

“Okay Sean, let’s go,” I said.

“No,” he said. “I want to hear what he has to say.”

The ranger looked a little surprised but indulged us. “Well, that’s not exactly how I’d put it, son. But yes, I believe in a higher power. I’ve seen things…”

“Like disabled kids standing up from their wheelchairs?” mocked Sean. “Cancerous tumors miraculously disappearing from a preacher’s touch?”

“That’s enough!” I snapped.

“That’s not what I...” said the ranger as Sean continued to rant.

“Go ahead and believe in a God that persecutes people like us and allows monsters to run the world. But when someone you love is taken before their time, you come and tell me if you still believe in your God!” With that he stomped off.

“I didn’t mean to upset you, son,” the ranger called after Sean.

“I’m not your son!” Sean yelled back.

I stood awkwardly with the ranger for a beat before breaking the silence.

“I’m sorry about that. I love him but we’ve had more than a few disagreements of our own in the past. He’s passionate, you know?”

“What’s your name, son?” he asked before holding his hands up. “Sorry, habit.”

“It’s fine,” I said. “Dylan.”

“Good to meet you, Dylan,” he said, holding out his hand which I shook. “I’m Jacob. I respect your… boyfriend?”

“Husband,” I smiled, flashing my white gold band.

He nodded and smiled warmly. “I respect your husband’s opinion. I understand he’s hurt and angry.”

“We both are,” I said. “I'm just better at hiding it. We’ve been dealt a few bad hands, it gives perspective.”

Jacob put a hand on my shoulder. “I’m sorry to hear that, Dylan. I don’t have all the answers, but I’ve seen things in these parts that I can only describe as an act of God. You be sure to let him know I meant no offense.”

“I appreciate that Jacob and I will. While I’ve got you, how serious would it be if we were to camp overnight in the wilderness?”

“You mean outside of a designated campsite?” he asked.

“Maybe,” I said with a mischievous smile.

Jacob chuckled. “I was young once, believe it or not. May have camped wild a few times myself. As long as you boys are respectful, clean up after yourselves and all that, I can turn a blind eye.”

“I promise you’ll never know we were here!”

He nodded. “I trust your word, Dylan. You didn’t hear that from me though, of course.”

“Of course,” I grinned.

“You boys be careful out here, okay? She’s a beaut for sure, but not completely immune to ugliness.”

I nodded. “Have a good day, sir.”

Jacob left with a tip of his hat. I continued on the trail and found Sean sitting on a rock looking sheepish. My expression must have said it all.

“I know,” he said. “I’m an asshole. Shall I apologize?”

I shook my head. “He understands.”

He stood up and put his arms around me. “You know I can’t listen to that garbage. I’m sorry I left you like that, Dylan.”

“It’s fine,” I said. “He’s a little into the God thing but he’s good people.”

After a couple hours hiking we stopped by the Flathead River to refuel with chips and granola bars. It looked like a potentially good spot to camp, so I left Sean and investigated our surroundings. There was a clearing up from the river bank sheltered by trees that looked like a good spot to camp for the night. The gentle running river could be heard too which offered great ambience.

When I went back to Sean I saw him talking to a man. Not just talking; the man was stroking Sean’s forearm. A very attractive man I hasten to add. I won’t lie; I went into jealous husband mode.

“Hi!” I interrupted with a phony smile. The man let go of Sean as if taken by surprise. Sean turned to me like he was on a delay, looking a little dazed.

“Oh, hi!” said the man. “You must be Dylan?” He held out his hand but I ignored it, instead going to Sean’s side and linking arms.

“That’s right,” I said firmly. “And who are you?”

“I’m Quinn,” he said with a smile that lit up his stupidly handsome face. “Sean was telling me you guys are camping for the weekend.”

“Yep,” I said. “Speaking of which, we need to find a spot so…”

“He also said that you’d be up for some company,” said Quinn with a wink.

I was fuming as I turned to Sean. “Is that so?”

Sean turned to me. “What?”

“You told him we’d like company?”

“I…” Sean looked confused. “I did. I’m sorry Dylan, I shouldn't have.”

Quinn stepped closer and reached out. His fingers lightly touched my arm and it felt like static. His eyes sparkled like crazy in the sun and I temporarily forgot how annoyed I was.

“I’d sure love to hang out with you guys, I think we could have a lot of fun.”

He started to rub my arm and I pulled away. “I don’t think so, but thanks for your interest.”

He let out a laugh, flashing his perfect teeth. “That’s a real shame, you guys are cute!”

With that he continued on the trail. We watched him until he was out of sight.

“What the hell was that?” I asked.

Sean shrugged. “I don’t know! Believe me, Dylan. I can’t explain it.”

I sighed. “If you want to invite other men into the relationship already I’d appreciate a conversation first.”

“I don’t!” he snapped, then took my hands. “Look, I think the fresh air has gone to my head. I’m sorry.”

“I’ll get over it,” I said. “I was gonna suggest we camp here but I think we should keep going for a bit. He made me uncomfortable.”

“Are you sure?” he asked. “We’ve been walking for a while, perhaps we should stop…”

“I’m fine, honestly.”

He nodded. “I love you, Dylan.”

I smiled. “I love you too, just a little bit.”

Sean motioned to the direction Quinn had just left. “He was hot as fuck though, right?”

I playfully slapped his arm as I laughed. “I hate to say it but yes!”

We followed the river for another hour or so, admiring the backdrop of snow tipped mountains. A few kayakers passed by and we waved hello. Apart from them we never saw another person on the trail. It was so clean and peaceful, just the escape I needed.

Sean noticed I was slowing down and suggested we stop for the day. He also pointed out that it would be a particularly beautiful spot to watch the sunset. We found a clearing for the tent that was hidden from the main path, then had some more snacks. I excused myself to pee, finding a secluded spot away from the tent.

When I turned back I had a clear view of our makeshift camp. Sean wasn’t alone. He was with Quinn again, and they went into the tent together.

My stomach dropped. I couldn’t move for a while, a part of me wanting to avoid confrontation. But then I saw red and stormed back to the tent. As I got closer I could hear groans coming from inside. I felt sick. Part of me just wanted to grab my backpack and leave. After brief consideration I decided to gatecrash.

I dramatically threw open the entrance to the tent. Sean was sitting upright, his face in an expression of pleasure. Quinn had his back to me but held one of Sean’s arms up. I could hear a crunching sound before he slowly turned his head. His eyes looked darker than before but had a shimmer to them. He smiled, his lips and teeth stained red. He held Sean’s arm at the wrist and I could see he was missing a finger.

“Hi Dylan,” said Quinn as I stood frozen in terror. “Want some?”

I screamed as he leapt at me and I was forced onto the ground outside our tent. He bared his bloody teeth as I struggled.

“Help!” I yelled, hoping to be in earshot of other hikers. Quinn gripped my wrist and I felt that strange static sensation again.

“Shush, Dylan,” he said. “Everything’s fine. Just look into my eyes and you’ll see.”

I did all I could to avert his gaze but couldn’t help myself. They were almost black and sparkled as if coated with diamond dust. His thumb began to massage my inner wrist and I felt a calmness wash over me. He smiled as his other hand began to stroke my face.

“There you are. This is what you want, isn’t it?”

My body began to tingle with a feeling I can only compare to sexual desire. All I could do was nod.

“Good boy,” he said, lifting my hand to his open mouth. As he was about to bite his expression changed to one of curiosity. His other hand touched my chest and he grinned wide. “Oh my, there’s a darkness in you. Delicious.”

A blood curdling scream came from the tent. Sean had no doubt come to his senses and realized what had happened to him. Quinn was taken off guard. I snapped out of my trance enough to pick up a nearby stone and smack it against his head. Then I was running, screaming for help. I could hear Sean’s intermittent cries and Quinn roaring my name somewhere behind me. I felt such relief when I spotted a ranger truck through the trees and Jacob running towards me. I practically threw myself into his arms.

“It’s alright, Dylan,” he said, patting my back firmly then holding me by the shoulders. I was so out of breath I could hardly get my words out.

“Jacob… there’s… a cannibal… and…”

“No, son,” he interrupted. “That ain’t human.”

Quinn roared my name again, but it didn't sound like Quinn anymore. I felt like my legs were going to collapse under me but Jacob held me in place.

“Lure it to the river,” he said, pointing through the trees.

I shook my head. “I can’t... We need to get Sean and…”

“Trust me!” he said. “You can do this, son. Run straight down to the river, I’ll meet you there. Go!”

He pushed me away and I gave him a helpless look as he ran back to his truck. I had never been so afraid in my life, running as fast as my legs would allow as I heard Quinn hunting me. After a few minutes I emerged from the trees at the river bank, my chest on fire. The sun was beginning to set but I had no time to admire its beauty.

The wind was knocked out of me as I hit the ground by the river’s edge. Quinn was once again on top of me, looking furious.

“You want to do this the hard way?” he spat. “Fine by me!”

He bared his teeth which no longer looked human. In fact not much of his formerly handsome face looked human at all. His cheekbones were so prominent that the skin was beginning to split around them. His hairline vanished before my eyes and two weathered horns grew from his scalp. I screamed as he motioned to bite my neck.

“Hey!” shouted Jacob from nearby. Quinn looked up as a gunshot exploded, then he was no longer on top of me. His body rolled into the river. I turned and my feet were fully submerged in the river, the cold water filling my hiking boots. I felt Jacob’s hand on my shoulder.

“You alright, son?”

I looked up at him and quickly nodded, my body trembling. “I… I think so.”

“Dylan!” yelled Sean, emerging from the trees behind us. He had a spare t-shirt wrapped around his hand which clung to his chest, blood seeping through it. He fell to my side and I held him tight.

We all gasped as what was once Quinn burst from the river. A large pair of wings spread from its back, tearing the hiking ensemble to shreds. Standing before us, knee-deep in the Flathead River, was some kind of creature straight from a horror movie. Sean and I shook as we clung to each other. It began to laugh in a deep tone.

“Your weapons are useless!” it roared. Its arms opened up as if inviting an attack. “Take your best shot, you’ll see.”

Despite its offer, Jacob calmly re-holstered his gun. “I’ll take your word for it.”

Sean and I looked at him like he was crazy. The creature was taken aback for a moment before grinning.

“How novel. I never encountered a mortal who gave up so easily.”

“I’m not giving up,” said Jacob. “You’re right where I want you to be.”

Steam began to rise from the water’s surface around the creature. It looked down and back towards us with a panicked expression. It attempted to fly and a single beam of light shone down from the sky, forcing it back into the river with a splash. It screeched as it writhed around, its skin dripping like candle wax. We couldn’t stop watching as the creature became nothing but a fleshy pulp and washed away with the gentle current.

After a few minutes it was as if nothing had happened. We were left with the beautiful sight of the sun setting behind the mountains, the river’s surface a shimmering golden orange. Jacob crouched down next to us, a look of awe and appreciation on his face as he looked over the water.

“You see, boys? This here is God’s country.”

This isn’t the only strange thing that happened to us. Something I haven’t mentioned was before our trip, after months of discomfort I was diagnosed with a rare incurable illness. I was given weeks. It was to be my swansong of sorts, a final getaway from the busy city to be in nature with Sean; my rock. When that thing was boiled alive in the Flathead River, my feet were constantly submerged. I felt something that I can only describe in hindsight, like a weight was being physically lifted.

I’m no longer sick. I don’t know what to believe anymore.
