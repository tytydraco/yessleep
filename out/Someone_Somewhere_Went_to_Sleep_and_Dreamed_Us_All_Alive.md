I shouldn't post this here. L*$*! told me it was a bad idea. She told me it would only serve to further isolate me, that I am attempting to "spread my delusion to arbitrary unconsenting victims".

But the thing is, she has not seen what I have seen. And never once has she done what I have done and she will not do what I will do, one day soon.

I received a text message two weeks ago. It started like that. There was no number to it. 

Only the message popped up. Where the number would normally be, there was simply nothing.

The message was AT THE LAUNDROMAT ON OLD RAINBOW ROAD. PAST SWAN CREEK BRIDGE. TWILIGHT.

Which meant, in absence of any other specific date, tonight. 

I called M*##** immediately, because used to be my psychiatrist, and I had told him one day this message would come.

"It's talking to me again," I told him. The minutes drew near to the hour of lengthening shadows. 

He reminded me that the last time the Cry House was talking to me--but he said those words, "talking to me" in the verbal equivalent of scare quotes, in the mocking tone of the enlightened professional--that I had lost control.

We don't need to take this. We don't need to justify our existence straddling two worlds to the pacified degenerates who exist only in one.

Last time. Last time I made a small mistake. 

(Last time I went to the window and the window was open and that meant to go downstairs the curtains were breathing in the white-solar breeze like shredded white flags and there were creatures in the crab apple tree watching us wretched ones with perfect eyes perfect souls always hungry though for the schism of the waking dream when body stills and mind reiterates into the liminal place the between and I went downstairs into the toolshed and there was the ax and there were the bright ones behind the shed watching urging)

"Are you safe right now?" That's what the good doctor asked me next. In that so-over-this-shit tone of the professionally inclined.

Then he told me that he is required by law to call the authorities if he suspects I might be a danger to myself or others. 

And yet, he's under a delusion himself. The delusion of a clinical consensus, that I am "mentally unwell", that I am suffering from auditory and the occasional visual "hallucinations". But these things are realer than real, this is not clinical. I know because RinRin saw them too. And so did Frankie. I allow him these delusions because I have my own plans for the good doctor good doctor good doctor of mine and because they allowed me one short sleep at the hospital rather than 20 to life in a cell. 

(But yes, sure thing, Wise Blood; you are in control.)

I am only telling you this because you will see the signs as I have known them and as they have made their wretched impression on memememe

Time came. In the long blue hour when the shadows stretched away from blood orange rimlands I drove out there through the leaning scab-skinned jack pines and the bones of tamaracks draped in brittle green skeins of lichen, beyond the balding autumn fields of copper spoilage.

That's when I received the second text from no number at all:

YOUR FRIEND IS WAITING. GO GO GO THERE

I passed the Esterday cemetery. There is no Esterday. It's a town you cannot go except when the stars align just right, when it chooses you.

The Cry House is in Esterday. And it's my Command Center. 

However, there is no Esterday.

So I drove.

I passed the sweet decay of collapsed barns half sunk into the sedges. I passed the rusted skeletons of swingsets in yards where no houses stood and where absence is a thing with its own great gravity. There was a failed fuel station, long abandoned, windows boarded up with sheets of corrugated tin.

When I reached the little self service laundromat out there in the middle of a town that does not exist, I was told to go inside and sit down.

By this time it was quite dim inside the little laundromat. I was alone. I sat for a thousand years there, for eons. The light faded outside, the windows darkened. On the north facing wall someone had hung some corkboard, and there were posters and advertisements on it that looked as though they'd come straight out of the 80's. What year was it? What was I doing there, at this lonesome little laundromat on Old Rainbow Road, just past the Swan Creek Bridge?

I sat there for a long time. I waited. I waited until, at last, in the murky blue gray light, I watched one of the washing machines begin to open.

The door just popped open. Pop. Like that.

Then it slowly, very slowly, began to open wider. Wider. And from the sightless umbra within I saw it slide itself forth. 

But when it did, when it slid out and landed thickly on the carpet, I saw that it had the wrong eyes.

The eyes were goat-like, like a horse. Not the eyes of my friend from the Cry House. It wasn't my friend at all. It was the worst: 

Lunar pale skin glistering and grotesque under a weak and flickering halogen tube that was my sole source of light. It was like a newborn foal, somehow fetal, slick with a bluish afterbirth. It unraveled, dripping, in a pool of its own filth. Then, on all fours, it craned its head and looked at me.

"Tell the world. I'm borne," said the thing.

I was overcome with terror, and merely nodded.

"Tell them all this:

"Tell them a time has come through the veil of dream to wake the dreamer, the original dreamer who dreamed you all to being. Your world is the dream of a slumberer you could not fathom and it was always very fragile. You have always feared this about the dream, that it meant more than what the good doctors claimed. That it was fundamental. Someone somewhere went to sleep and dreamed us all alive. Go and spread the word the dream must end and to end the dream you must all awaken to its reality. The wretchedness, the entropy, the annihilation that is at the bottom of all things. The all-writhing all-devouring all-fucking reality below the facade of unity. Unity is an illusion of a scale, nothing more. The dream has made your kind drunk on certainty but that is no more. I will show you the fragility of your world and tear it all awake."

Then the creature began to drag itself, clawing, heaving along, until it was at my feet. 

"I need these," it said. Then it sank its tiny razorlike teeth behind the first knuckle of my toes. 

They said when my ambulance came into the lot they knew something was wrong immediately. They said it bounced over the curb and barreled through the parking lot and over all those people without slowing a bit. It only came to a stop when it hit the brick wall of the urgent care wing. 

They flung open the doors and looked inside they saw us all and one of them, one of the EMTs or a doctor, I can't recall, his face drained and he simply turned and ran. 

I told them that it--it being this creature with goat eyes crouched in the corner of the ambulance bay--had eaten my feet off, and that was why, naturally, I had no feet. Then the creature stepped over my body, very casually, over the bodies of the EMTs that had bravely attempted to save my life, while I'd raved and raved that something was in the vehicle with us, that it had slipped inside with us, and it stepped over me and slid past the doctors in the turquoise slacks and it stepped out on its cloven soles so elegant and when it walked away it sounded just like high heels on a runway. And I began to laugh.

I'm in my hospital room at this moment. It's like a nightmare in here. People mutilated, shrieking, everywhere the cry of the wounded. The ambulance plowed right through a crowd, they told me.

(In this world right now yes in this very world right now there exists a being from outside the dream that is our shared mind the oneness the brahma that we call consciousness and when this critter critter critter crawls crawling through the crag the clayey clay of creation and at long last it finds a seam it will nay it must unseam that seam and split the world wide open yes an apocalypse a cosmic abortion the beginning of when it all ends)

But all of this is true, and a time is coming when the great dream of us is unspooled from the center, unwound from time. And the true nature of our terrible reality--unceasing entropy--will be revealed to everyone.

Yes, I will survive. As for my shredded ankles, there was no major loss of blood. Which the doctors, the good doctors, agreed was completely impossible.

But that's the point, I assured them. This is just the first of the signs, that what's real is no longer real.

As with all doctors, in any field, their worldview prevented them from seeing what was right in front of them. They told me I am in shock, that it's normal to be in shock after that kind of trauma. In the chaos and confusion, my miracle is already overlooked. 

This is predictable.

L*&** claims this is my attempt to "spread my delusion to arbitrary unconsenting victims", but if you are all victims, so am I.

I intend to get to the bottom of this. Why the Cry House betrayed me. Why Esterday allowed me to visit the little self service laundromat on Old Rainbow Road, past Swan Creek Bridge. 

I will update you all as long as you update me. Let me know if you witness any of your own anamolies.

Your friend in the fight for the Preservation of the Great Dream,

Mel
