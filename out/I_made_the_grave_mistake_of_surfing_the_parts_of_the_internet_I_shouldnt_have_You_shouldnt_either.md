It was the middle of the night, I surfed the web clacking at my keyboard. I've always been a huge fan of surfing the parts I shouldn't. Booting up the Tor browser and putting on my VPN, I accessed the dark web. I didn't have much access to precautions like extra security, so it was a thin sheet of a free VPN protecting me against the monstrosity lying beyond.

Now, in terms of the dark web, you would find just about anything and everything on it. Things no human, nay, nothing should ever witness. I could not fathom how people were so fucked up. It was beyond me and yet curiosity killed the cat.

I surfed countless fucked up articles until one, in particular, caught my attention. ***"Free yourself from shackles of the world, Click here to find enlightenment!"*** written in a bold, eye-catching font. I hesitantly clicked on it, but if only I knew how much I'd regret it. A minute, two, and three went by as it showed a loading screen. Nay, I would not even call it a loading screen. It was just an eye, staring at me, I could not help but stare back at the eye on the monitor screen as I waited for something to show up. And it did. Not on my monitor screen, but rather on the dark reflection, right beside me. A figure I couldn't quite make out and behind it, my broken window, I knew it wasn't human, The figure wasn't human, It was almost translucent. An entity is the best way to describe it. I shuddered, I dared to look back. There was nothing but darkness, and with the faint light of my monitor screen, I saw nothing either.

Looking back at my monitor screen with the eye, yet again, staring at me, I thought it was just mind games. But that was until I heard scratching. I turned back, got up, and made my way toward the light switch. I fumbled in the dark to find the switch and I froze. My hand lay upon what wasn't the light switch, it was another hand. I jolted backward and my heart was nearly caught up in my throat. I rushed back to my monitor in hopes that closing it will make it go away. Stupid decision. Not only did I expose myself in the monitor light but my attempt at finding the X button dwindled down the drain, I tried everything, esc, alt f4, nothing worked. I desperately tried everything, as a last attempt I pulled out the computer cords, and it hit me. Just as I pulled it out I felt a warm sensation of blood trickling down my waist, I ran to the door. It was dark but my muscle memory paved the path. I tried yanking the door but to my horror, it was closed from the outside. I didn't understand what was happening and as a last effort, I climbed out of my window. Thankfully, it was right on the ground, but perhaps it being that way was what had caused it to break in. 

I ran, banging on my neighbor's doors, clawing at them in hopes anyone will open up. I couldn't stay waiting in one place as I knew it was following me. Lurking behind me. Savoring my fear while it hunted me down. I was nearly going to collapse with the amount of blood gushing from my side when someone, as though a guardian angel, rushed me in and called an ambulance. Once I was in their house, I felt its presence fade away and I could finally breathe, but it hurt, it stung, to even breathe. My hand was grasping the wound, trying to make it stop, I didn't want to die. Not like this.

To my surprise, not long after, an ambulance arrived and I was rushed to the hospital. It was a close call but I made it. The police had brought me in for questioning, but really, there was nothing much I could provide them and I rather not mention the dark web. I've made a full recovery and currently staying at a friend's house. I'm afraid to go to my own home as I feel it's there, waiting for me.
