My confession. I will tell it as it happened, in my natural voice. Sit in judgment of me if you must. *No one is more hated than he who speaks the truth*.

 

I bought a two-bedroom condo in a mid-century development called Huntington Square. However, I swiftly discerned that the HOA board was certainly failing to address the pitiful nonchalance by which our building was tended. I knew the neighborhood did not appreciate our building. Children even whispered that it was haunted. Preposterous, albeit a stucco horror I grant. But good bones, I knew; and a solid structure supports a stable frame of mind. I became HOA president when the outgoing one, a droll man not up to the task, decided to move to Florida, and I ran unopposed.

At first the lack of participation played to the benefit of all, if I do say so, as I organized projects to improve the exterior walkways and grounds. Opposition soon arose. My next-door neighbor Mandy, our HOA secretary and longest-tenured resident, was a gossip who likely served on the board so that she could be first to hear new salacious tidings. One morning, as I returned to my unit from a stroll through growing sweet viburnum that I’d had planted before dissent from a particular resident took hold in our meetings, Mandy intercepted me.

“Hey!” she said as I approached my door. 

Her eyes looked at me as if seeing through my skull to the wall behind, awaiting her turn to say whatever it was that burned her tongue so.

I sighed intentionally, which did nothing to deter her.

“Yes, Mandy?”

“Willard Meyer is mad at you,” she blurted, falling over herself proverbially. “After that last meeting.”

“What of Willard?” I demanded, impatient. “The man can’t have a conversation without becoming a pomegranate.”

“Didn’t you hear? He’s going to try to get your new roof proposal voted down.”

“Buffoonery,” I said. “It has been 25 years, we’re due.”

“’Doesn’t leak’, he says,” said Mandy. “’Waste of money’ he says.”

“The man’s a caper. Let him stew. In the meantime, we must act to prevent leaks that are not happening, not wait until they do. Any reasonable person would see that.”

“There you go,” she said. “But he’s all bent about it. You should…”

“What, Mandy? Please, I have a tea and reading awaiting me in my nook.”

“Just check your e-mail. Goodbye!”

Once in my condo I locked the door and proceeded to the second bedroom, which I had christened a study. I sprayed water over the Greeks, my plants, named for whom I consider the ineffable leaders of Antiquity: Sophocles the ZZ plant, Anacreon the snake plant, and mighty Ptolemy the monstera. I sat at my computer and swapped my glasses with readers.

I clicked open the e-mail and stilled my gut. It read:



**RE: Vote on The Need to Replace Huntington Square Roof**

**Mr. Board “President”,**

**You are WAY out of line to force your agenda on the residents on this condominium. Not only is the roof FINE, but everything is fine. IF IT’S NOT BROKE DON’T FIX IT.**

**You might hold that stupid title but you’re just ONE owner of 33, and I think I speak for all the residents here when I say that we cannot spend this kind of money, especially NOT IN THIS ECONOMY. Our dues have already gone up 22% this year, 15% last year. How are we supposed to sustain this and replace the whole roof? Should we open an organ transplant clinic in the basement? I DON’T THINK SO. I’m an electrician but you know I’m on disability and semi-retired. WE WONT PAY.**

**With sincere contempt,**

**Willard Meyer**



I stared at the screen without blinking. This man, this cantankerous buffoon. I cracked my knuckles and hit ‘reply’.

Just then came a knock at the door. Exasperated, I rose to answer it.

It was Mandy.

“Hello, Mandy. What can I do for you?”

“Well, since I knew you were home. I’ve been meaning to fetch my space heater from storage, with winter around the corner. I was hoping you could accompany me.”

I sighed, deeply and exaggeratedly to demonstrate to her my conviction. 

“Can’t you fetch it yourself, Mandy? There are lights aplenty.”

“It’s like a haunted house down there.”

“Buffoonery,” I said. “You take fright too easily, Mandy. And you mustn’t regurgitate such nonsense. I mean no ill will, but it makes you a blabbermouth.”

“Oh, please come, it’s not like we’re taking the stairs!”

“Fine.”

I fetched my jacket, as the basement always proffered a proper chill, even in summer. We proceeded to the elevator and called it. When the doors opened, Willard Meyer stood there. He became more erect upon observing me. His jaw clenched visibly.

“Mr. President,” he snarled.

“Oh Willard,” scolded Mandy as she entered to stand next to him and ushered me to her other side such that she formed a rampart between warring nations. It made me think of The Seven Against Thebes and I chuckled.

“What!?” his voice brokenly yelled as the elevator car descended. Mandy jumped and she looked annoyed more than frightened.

His face was red but eyeballs unsure where to look, as someone who hadn’t meant to confront but somehow had.

“I shall respond to your correspondence,” I said. “I did you the honor of reading it. Would you afford me the grace of a retort in the same medium?”

“Who talks like that?” he scowled. “Nuts! We can’t afford a new roof.”

“It’s the board’s responsibility to—”

“—fuck off!” he said just as the doors opened onto the lobby, and he stormed off.

Mandy looked up at me, rolled her eyes.

We proceeded to the basement where the doors opened to a cool atmosphere. I do not judge Mandy for her timidity. Even I felt it. A draft that draws a chill across your face the moment you exit the elevator. It gives out onto a concrete floor that must have had asbestos glued linoleum at one time in the past because the black residue, hopefully sufficiently abated, was still randomly caked over part of that floor like fossilized blood stains. A hallway led you down the full length of the building to its far end where a red glow from that ubiquitous exit sign marked the door to the stairwell back up. 

There were no windows here, just the long hallway, and its sidelong doors like pigeonholes for each unit’s storage room, numbers matching apartments of all six stories. Despite the individual halogen bulbs hanging at intervals all the way down, it is true that it felt oppressively dark. I do not fault Mandy for her caution or her trepidation at the thought of coming alone. Even as we stood there, I forgot my companion and felt deeply alone, like Sisyphus and his boulder, only my weight was the crush of lightless earth and brick and concrete all around.

“Well,” Mandy said suddenly. 

“Gods almighty!” I started. 

“Oh, I’m sorry I thought—”

“—No, no it’s alright. Forgive me I was lost in thought, and it is true this place feels…”

“Haunted,” she said.

“Why do you insist on hearsay?”

Mandy snickered and eyed me.

“You do speak funny you know, Willard’s got your number there.”

I am aware, I did not say. *To thine own self be true*, is it not beseeched? *I am that I am*.

“It is haunted,” she said. “You haven’t heard the story.”

“Must you recount it now?”

Mandy shivered and looked pale in the unnatural light for a moment. Perhaps she was afraid. But the eagerness in her face prevented her from staying quiet on the matter. She just had to prattle.

“Nineteen ninety-five, around that year. Five neighbors of mine came down here during a big, big winter storm to play poker in one of their storage rooms (I don’t know which). They smoked, can you imagine, down here? I had an uncle who smoked too; I could barely stand it outside, can’t imagine down here!”

 “Mandy, I haven’t the entire day,” I pleaded.

“Well anyway,” she beamed, looking at my face intently, as if my reactions could sway whether she’d tell this tale, but of course she must. 

“So, the storm’s storming and they’re down here and KAPOW the lights go out. They’re fumbling around and one of them has the bright idea to use his generator that he stores here, and some camping lights. So, they’re all happy with the get-up and they play their poker and drink their beer and smoke their cigarettes and it’s a merry party.

“Well, it turns out they were five bachelors who lived alone in their apartments. No one comes down here for two weeks after the storm, when the smell finally reached the lobby and someone decided to investigate. Found all five of them rotting in the chairs where they died. Carbon monoxide poisoning. All five of them dead. Some say they still had cigarette butts between their fingers. Some say one held a royal flush in a death grip.”

“’Some say’,” I scoffed. “Mandy you must still your heart, I surmise. If that story were true, would it not have been in the papers? I found no such mention when I researched this condominium before purchasing my unit.”

“I know it’s true! Some say,” she jeered, “that their spirts haunt our building.” 

As if upset, Mandy grimaced and hugged herself against a renewed awareness of how silent the basement felt, how cold, and how dark.

“Let us fetch your space heater and be gone.”

With renewed energy, Mandy counted the doors from zero, ignoring their posted numbers, such that when she said, “And here’s mine” at 504, she had counted it as “twenty”.

“And there’s you,” she said, pointing at 505. “What do you keep in yours?”

“This and that,” I said. I did not want to share facts with Mandy, who had a way of taking mundane information and making it conspiratorial.

“Come now, open sesame,” I demanded.

She jimmied her key and opened her storage door, holding it slightly ajar. 

“Stay,” she ordered uncharacteristically. “Don’t look. It’s embarrassing.” 

“Do you hoard?” I inquired.

“Yes,” she said.

She disappeared, and then a few moments later kicked the space heater out, shutting the door behind. She wrestled with the space heater for several moments before guilt forced me to assist. I have a bad back and therefore I am careful to maintain proper posture when towing heavy items. Together we hefted her heater and walked back to the elevator.

After delivering the heater, and Mandy, to her home in unit 504, I returned to my study and powered my computer, which opened to a reply window still open as if waiting. Willard’s miscreant fruit-red face entered my mind’s eye. Voluntarily, I huffed my indignance and began to type.



**RE: Vote on The Need to Replace Huntington Square Roof**

**To the Resident in 607,**

**It is the consensus of roofers and generally accepted by homeowners that roofs of the flat variety that are sheathed in rubber, a description befitting of Hungtington Square’s roof, require replacement on a regular schedule, typically every twenty to thirty years.**

**If you insist on challenging this incontrovertible analysis, I will not entertain it unless you proffer some alternative solution through which the treasury might amass additional reserves for a future when not only must we replace this roof but also the decking and joists that leaks will by then surely have occasioned to rot.**

**On a personal note, Mr. Meyer, I find your comportment regrettable in our HOA meetings and encourage you to imagine yourself capable of more than obtuse blathering. It suffices that Mr. Spaulding’s flatulent dog fouls the air, must you compete with him?** ***Wise men speak because they have something to say; fools because they have to say something***\*\*.\*\*

**At your service,**

**Your President**



Click. Sent.

“That will teach him,” I said aloud.

Do you not approve of my correspondence? Well, what did you expect from this confession? I am not an unreasonable man. On the contrary I find diction of utmost importance because when it is accurate, it serves the magnitude of deeds. O! What deeds. O, unspeakable deeds!

Thoughts of the Greeks and Mandy and Willard and the roof roiled my mind ceaselessly, and so I found myself in need of an escape. That weekend I went into the woods and camped alone. There is nothing like the employ of one’s muscles to reinvigorate one’s mind. Across fields and meadows, I drew myself into nature, breathing its magnificence. Aristotle wrote that *in all things of nature there is something of the marvelous*. How can we deny nature? How can we deny what is in our hearts? *Sweet is the breath of the woodland*, writes the poet. *Nature does nothing in vain*, writes the philosopher. Woe to man who suppresses his vigor and glory!

It was late evening when I returned to Huntington Square, still buoyed by fresh vigor that nature imparts. I buzzed myself into the empty lobby. When I selected my floor in the elevator, and the doors shut, I was surprised to find it descending. A moment later, the doors opened onto the cool chill of the basement hallway. While my floor remained illuminated, I pressed the close door button. But this was to no avail, as the elevator doors remained open.

By now, the cold air dealt its smite upon my vigor, and my skin hissed with a thousand tiny welts of fear. I consciously chose to suppress this sensation and resolved to walk to the other end of the basement where the glimmer of the staircase exit sign beckoned. A vision of my ZZ plant came to my mind’s eye, with Sophocles’ intonement: *fear nothing; for even dreadful things are disarmed by courage*.

“Courage,” I told myself, in a thick French accent. “Courage, bon ami.”

I stepped over the blackened, caked linoleum glue, my muscles tensed against falling as I imagined it slick. The halogens’ buzzing pinged off hard surfaces and filled the empty space like depth charges blooming underwater. At least that is how my ears communicated the sensation. I stepped forth and began walking more briskly toward the stairs.

My peripheral vision saw the door begin to open before it made a sound. By the time my head began to turn, I had registered the numbers 607. The squeak of its hinges, the height I gained when my heart jumped inside my chest, and the cold sweat sent instantly to my palms all happened the moment I clocked Willard’s reddened face looking at me as if I’d drowned the man’s daughter.

“By God!” I stammered. “Dastard!”

Willard’s face twitched but he didn’t say a word. Not a word. His eyes were as red as his face, and I noticed a faint odor coming from his storage room that made me think he was want for air.

“What are you doing down here, at this hour in the night?”

Finally, he spoke.

“If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.”

“Now we’ve the elevator to fix, too,” I said.

“Elevator’s fine,” he rejoined.

I considered this for a moment and then replied.

“You. You somehow rigged the elevator to deposit me here?”

“You got it, Mr. President.”

“To what end?” I said, searching his boiling face.

“To have a little chat. I read your reply. If anyone speaks just to say something, it’s you. You with your words and your phrases.”

“Mr. Meyer—”

“—You called me a fool. You called me a dog.”

By now the storage room door of 607 was open completely and I could see over Willard’s shoulder into a space crowded with boxes, tools and parts organizers stuffed with electrical miscellanea. He was an electrician, that’s right. Good with elevators it seemed.

“Willard,” I said, resting a hand on one of his shoulders. He jerked back but I insisted, then placed another hand on the other shoulder. “You think you have trapped me here with you. In your dungeon, is it? You intend intimidation, Willard? Is that what this is?”

“I—I,” he stuttered, eyes darting around. Perhaps my height advantage turned this meeting onto its hind legs and forced it to yelp. 

The color went from his face. Looking back now, perhaps the man realized everything before even I. Perhaps his instincts picked up a scent on the frigid air, some pertinent pheromones that his nature identified by piercing that dusky basement aroma and stale odor from his moist boxes and oxygen-deprived storage room. For it is nature that bears my confession. I ascribe this transformation to some intimate amalgamation of the vibrating joy I brought home from my weekend in the woods, where, as always, I sought to remake myself and lighten my heart; and the pressures of philosophy as board president where I strive to elevate Hungtington Square. As Willard’s eyes widened, my hands wrapped around his neck and squeezed. All in a moment.

We fell into his storage room where I was on top of him, his hands flailing at me when he failed to unclench mine from his throat. My mouth salivated. His eyes bulged as his color faded like a sunset from burning passion for life, to a violet capitulation, to death grey.

As the last breath wheezed from his mouth, I lowered myself to whisper knowledge for him to take to Hades.

“Heraclitus wrote that *nature loves to hide*,” I purred. “I reveal myself to you.”

Willard was dead. Wire cuttings and spade terminals that had jostled free from their little plastic drawers fell onto his face, into his gaping mouth, against an eyeball. I found the sight disgusting.

I regained my feet and my composure. I gathered Willard’s keys from his pocket. Then I shifted his legs beyond the door’s threshold and shut it and locked his body therein. I stood alone under the buzzing lights, my shadow cast below, far below, cutting the concrete like an endless crevice into the unknown.

At this point, you may be anticipating my confession over. That I later rid the body, wiped my prints. Nay, reader. The body remains in storage room 607. I have not returned. I suspect the smell has begun to permeate, enough perhaps to draw notice. Some other poor sod may yet wander into those depths, but it shall not be me. I shall not go back down there willingly. As I straightened my sweater and smacked off errant bits of dust and debris from my slacks that night of Willard’s demise, I must tell you about Mandy’s storage room.

I noticed that the elevator doors had closed, the elevator car no doubt summoned to its ferrying duties by a Huntington Square resident. Had they descended then to the basement, they might have seen a disheveled HOA president and wondered, if only for a moment, before being distracted by the oppression our basement never fails to conjure.

Inscribed at the Temple of Apollo in Delphi are words that have long stayed with me, as indeed they ought to stay with all who seek meaning in how they live: *Know thyself*. I seek to know myself; I seek cognizance of who I am. I cannot confess to you here that I had always known myself before the moment I heretofore described, a moment to which I owe Willard’s sacrifice. Thereafter, perhaps better… 

Do you recall my mentioning storage room 504? I am an honest man, and I have recounted things as they happened. I have painted a window into my soul, an exercise not only for your judgment but for my edification; remember—*know thyself*. I learned about myself that night, and in my chest, pride blossomed like an orchid deep in moonlit jungle. 

But sudden chill seized me as another door in the hallway began to open, its hinges catching on themselves and spitting that creaking cacophony intrinsic to terror. Atoms seemed to pause, electrons to slow, my heart to thump against all odds. Peering back toward the elevator, I saw storage room door 504 opening into darkness.

Against my will, I approached. I recall my elbows bent and hands held aloft in defensive posture. All reflex, all instinct. I remembered Seneca, who wrote that *we suffer more often in imagination than in reality*. I prayed.

I prayed as I reached storage room 504. I prayed as I extended an arm to press the door open the rest of the way. I prayed then and I pray even now as I transcribe what I saw. The gods will hear my prayers, for the gods do not forsake their creations. Herodotus writes *that prayer is the voice of hope to the gods, a bridge between mortal and divine*. I prayed as the door opened to reveal five chairs in storage room 504, and upon them five clothed but rotted human skeletons, jaws agape in terror and sitting upright. Along the back wall shelving were lined pickle jars filled with milky liquids the color of urine in various stages of dehydration, and in each an unmistakable organ in decay. A heart, pieces of lung, pieces of liver, snaked intestines blackened and catching the gleam from halogens in the hallway. As my sight translated its findings to scent, I wretched. My eyes fluttered, glistened.

Perhaps it was the play of light on my tears as they blurred my vision, but in the same moment that panic overcame me, I saw hovering above the corpse quintet wisps of white air like slicing paper, visions that faded in and out in the dank draft that somehow penetrated storage room 504. I tell you, I could make out faces even, like mountain crags and snow-white cornices, mouths stretching like black holes screaming unspoken secrets—alas!

I ran from that place, slamming 504 behind me, sprinting past 607, pounding open the stairway door and running all the way up to my apartment where I shut myself away and cowered a craven.

Days have passed.

It takes courage to do mundane tasks, like watering the Greeks. I stare at the fleshy tendrils and wax-sheen leaves of Sophocles and pull Oedipus’ words into consciousness: *Alas, how terrible is wisdom when it brings no profit to the man that’s wise!* I feel burdened, like a stone sinking in a bottomless sea, the pressure mounting endlessly but unable to crack.

And so, I write. As the great men of Antiquity did. And I confess.

I must flee Huntington Square. An hour ago, I submitted my resignation via e-mail to the HOA board. 

But just now I received a reply. From Mandy. It reads:

**RE: My resignation as HOA president**

**Come downstairs.**
