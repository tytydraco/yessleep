Hey, no sleep! While rummaging through my old pc files I found this update post from the now-defunct subreddit r/neighboradvice , which got taken down in the latest unmoderated ban wave. I saved this story a couple of years back and I think it fits the other paranormal stories in this subreddit. I don't have the original post from OP and I didn't manage to save their username, but it seems like they included it at the beginning of their update. Here's the archive of the post!:

UPDATE POST: Something in my neighborhood took my dog and I don't think it was an animal.

Hello neighbor advice, it's Jade here again. I know there was a lot of clamoring for an update to my post from a couple of days ago and it's been one fucking hell of a couple of days. The update I wrote ended up being too long so I had to make the update separate. [Here is my original post if you want to read it in full](http://www.reddit.com/r/neighboradvice/comments/nothing/something_in_my_neighborhood_took_my_dog_and_i/), but for those who don't want to leave this post, I'll give a brief summary of the initial events, if you want to just read the update then just skip down.

Hey, neighbor advice. I just moved into a developing suburb in Femi, Pennsylvania (southwest of Pittsburgh but still in Allegheny County). The neighborhood is basically empty at the moment, with the only other occupied house being about 3 blocks over. My house was the first built and neighbors should be coming in after winter. So for now it's just me (F23) and my dog Farrah (F9), she's a small yellow lab corgi mix the sweetest dog I've ever met, with a soft lab coat and face, and the stumpiest little legs. The house is a new build with a small fenced-in backyard right on the edge of the dense western PA forest of white pines, hemlocks, and maples.

Yesterday I let Farrah out to do her business in the backyard after I got home from work. I'd say it was no later than maybe 5:30 PM, and if any of yinz are from around here you'd know that in late November it might as well be midnight out, but my eyes have basically been trained to see in this dark so I've never really had any trouble seeing her, plus she normally stays in the glow of the patio light. As I got dinner prepared I heard her growling slightly, which is nothing out of the ordinary for an older dog seeing something in the nothings of the dark, but then it just stopped. Not it slowing down to a stop or her just quitting it. It just went silent like someone hit the mute button on a T.V. remote, and then a small thud. I quickly dried my hands ran over to the sliding glass door and briefly strained my eyes through the glass before opening it. I flicked on my phone flashlight and slowly wandered the backyard "Farrah?" "Farrah come on girl, let's get inside!" I called in that high whining voice that people use for dogs. There was no trace of anything inside the backyard, but outside the fence by the deep chasm of the woods were a pair of what looked like human footprints. They weren't like the prints of someone's track shoes or something, but bare human feet, if slightly off. Again I live on the absolute edge of this development and even the construction workers have gone home(not that they'd even be barefoot). So neighbor advice what the fuck do I do? I searched that night and in the morning and I found absolutely nothing, is there anyone I should call or something? I'm going to search again after I get home from work and I'll make a new post if anything changes, but if not thanks for the help, -Jade.

Neighbor Advice, I can't believe what has happened since my original post. I'm writing this update not just to tell yinz what happened but to clearly write down my thoughts before I give my statement to the police, a sleep deprived scraggly 23-year-old unloading 6 shells into nowhere in the middle of the night is not the best look to police, so I'll start off where I left off.

When I got home I immediately glanced outside the invisible wall and saw... someone? something? It was this tall pale naked shadow? Maybe it was just the perspective or distortion from the glass but it looked like some 9-foot hairless man, with the only hair I could see was what looked to be a scarf wrapped around it's neck. A light yellow. Fur-like. Scarf. By the time I grabbed a knife off the kitchen counter and hurried my fat ass outside the man was gone, but on one of the tips of the fence, I saw a familiar blue floral ring, with a slight tinge of red, Farrah's collar. Laid almost intentionally for me to see, a taunting malice thing. I took the collar and went back into my house and took out the 20 gauge and the small box of shells my father had purchased me as a housewarming gift. I originally thought this was a strange gift to give something capable of killing a damn bird for someone moving into the suburbs, but I'd rather have it glued to my hip in case that big ass mother fucker decided to come back toward my house, "Man or beast, that'll be simply a corpse in my yard".

As the sun began to greet the rest of the country I started to set up shop in front of my glass door, I moved over a dining room chair, made a pot of coffee, sat that big iron on my lap, and just waited. After 3 hours or so my eyes already began to feel like lead as I stared off into the abyss of the unpolluted night. When the clock struck 12 I felt as if I was just going mad, maybe that collar had been there since she went missing, maybe there was no man and it was simply a trick of the light. At 1:30 I was about to just leave it for the night, but as I was about to start moving my chair, I fucking saw it, I saw that tall lanky motherfucker, but as I opened the door and trained my gun he fucking vanished, although I got a slightly better look at him this time. I got the chilling confirmation I had made when I saw the soft yellow fur on his neck, on the edge of the inner fence was a pile of pinkish sticks and a larger mass, her bones were picked fucking clean. I called the police as I had no other idea of what to do, but the 2 officers they sent over were no fucking help what so ever, the one a short stubby man with a mustache, also a caricature of a police officer simply said "Well, not much we can really do about this, could've just been an animal. maybe you just didn't notice them yesterday?", I tried to reply but they cut me off and firmly stated "Just try and gets some sleep ma'am." then they turned tail off the property. I knew now that I was solely alone, far from my friends and family, I sat back at my post and waited.

By the time the sun returned to sting my eyes, I was exhausted. Mentally, physically, emotionally, fuck probably spiritually too, so I called off work that day, and then the next, that day and night there was no sight of the monster and maybe those officers were right. The second day one of my co-workers, Nancy, decided to stop by. It was 3:40 pm and 3 days since my dog went missing, and my door was grazed by 3 knocks. I was started and dazed, I don't think I've gotten more than maybe 2 hours of sleep over this week and I quickly dragged my disheveled ass towards the door, 20 gauge still in hand, as the door swung open I heard her chipper almost speed-up voice ring through my ears like a dog whistle,

"Hey Jade! I haven't seen you at the office lately and we've been worried sick, what's up do you have a stomach bug or something? You really look like shit- I mean like not well not like. You-y- you know what I mean...",

she seemed distressed by my appearance, my normally carefully maintained hair had become greasy and sheened like an oil slick, combined with my wrinkled work outfit, the dark bags, messy makeup, and ya know 20 inches shotgun in my hands really doesn't spell out

"I'm doing well and am in a good mood". "I'm.. I'm fine Nancy, just- really worried about my dog she went missing.",

I winced through a morning growl as I wiped the crust off of my eyes and smudged the remnants of eye makeup I had put on days ago at this point. Nancy spoke again, obviously disturbed by my current state kind of half-hearted blurts out

"Welp, I guess I really- um think I should get going back to work... Good luck with you.- ah dog.. yeah o- oh- okay I'm just gonna go". She fumbles around with her hands as she spits out the last few words and I go back to my post. If it doesn't end tonight, I'm just going to give up my hope.

11:43 pm, a time I'll never forget, 11:43, it came back. I had dozed off but had awoken when I heard tapping against the glass, I quickly fumbled with the gun as I saw its face nearly pressed through the glass. Blank, expressionless, it almost looked like the plastic white masks that Joey Jordison used to wear, its eyes were dark and sunken, with a slight yellowing to them, its hand bony and joints near impossible. I raised my gun fully ready to blast a whole through my sliding door but the man seemed to do it for me and slammed its hand into the glass and across my body as I was flung over to my left,  and over the living room couch and into the glass coffee table, the gun rang off and into a neighboring wall. Shards of glass littered my back and one especially large piece went all the through my rectus femoris and out the front of my thigh and dress pants,

"YOU MOTHER FUCKING S---sssss SON OF A B-BITCh"

I whaled and scrambled for my gun, and reloaded it as the man pulled itself through the shattered glass door. I raised the gun once more and fired but I fucking missed, spraying the guts of a peace lily over my kitchen floor and into my microwave. I quickly searched my pockets for another shot and loaded in another. I had the bastard right in my line of sight and right as I pulled the trigger he backhanded the barrel and just my luck the shot hit the only light I had on in the room. I heaved myself back up, a pain shot up from my knee as it was basically locked due to the giant piece of coffee table sticking through it and I hobbled my way around the corner as the man crawled around the floor. I slid in another shell and BANG, the shot deafened me and shot right into the man's back leg, briefly toppling the man before he flung himself at the corner I shot from, pushing me back into a corner. The Man slowly pushed himself through the tight hallway, and I raised my gun back at his head. Nowhere to run. No way to pull any shit, directly to his fucking dome. I stared deeply into his eyes as he froze. I realized this was no man, this wasn't a monster of human intelligence, but not that of an animal, its eyes did not show the malice that could be shown by humans, but that purely animalistic will to survive. It was no man, it was purely a beast. I pulled the trigger, and BAM, the shot went cleanly through the middle of its forehead. The Beast slowly raised its hands towards the newly formed orifice in its expressionless face, as it slowly backed out of the hallway. I followed it gun still trained as it simply dropped the coat of my dog from its neck and crouched through the glass door. I fell to my knees and screamed in pain and despair

"NO YOU MOTHERFUCKER, GET THE F-FUCK BACK. HERE"

I clicked back the trigger over and over again, but there was no shot to be fired, and my house was filled with nothing but the empty clicks of the gun, and my cry, and then slowly, sirens. As the police entered about 30 minutes after the beast left the house, they could still hear the clicks of the gun. By that time I was already gone, I don't really remember them busting in my front door nor do I remember being loaded onto the stretcher or being admitted to the hospital. They'll probably think I just had a nervous breakdown, and killed my dog or something, but I know what really happened, and I'd rather be locked in a padded cell for the rest of my days than go back into that hell house with it still in those woods. Thank you all for the advice, I was just called back for questioning, and I'll do another update if anything else happens. - Jade
