Hello, I am Charlot.

I am writing about this experience because it still haunts me to this day. It all started one night in November.

 

I was living alone at the time, happy with my own house. It was a bit big for my standards, but I often had friends over, so it wasn’t really a problem. On said night, I was alone, going through my normal routine: eating dinner in front of the TV, showering, and then going to bed. I am really into reading and was reading an interesting book that night.

 

I started dozing off, which turned into sleeping. At 2:28 AM, a noise woke me up. I grabbed my phone and called my friend Dan. I was always scared of the dark. He reassured me it was nothing to worry about. I told him I had no one over that day, so it couldn’t have been one of my friends. He heard the fear in my voice and told me to keep calm.

 

I begged him to come over and call the cops. He agreed. About ten minutes later, he and the police were knocking on my door. For one moment I zoned out, concentrating on every noise that wasn’t them. Standing in my bedroom doorway, I heard a noise behind me. I turned around and saw a three-meter-tall man standing there, in my room. Terrified, I ran downstairs and told the policemen to get their guns ready.

 

Dan asked what was upstairs. I told him exactly what I saw. He looked me in the eyes, his face worried.

 

"Are you sure?" he asked. I nodded, shaking.

 

"Yes, I’m sure."

 

Dan looked worried. "The tallest man ever was 2.72 meters, and you claim to have seen a man taller than that?"

 

I tried to explain. "I’m guessing, but my room’s ceiling is two meters high, and that guy was crouching down a bit."

 

Dan’s worry deepened. "Should I take you to the doctor?"

 

"What?" I asked. "Do you think I’m insane?"

 

He hesitated, then nodded. "You’re joking, right? Insane, crazy? I’m none of that!"

 

Before he could answer, some policemen came out of the house.

 

"We searched the whole place, Sergeant," one of them said.

 

"What did you find?" the Sergeant asked.

 

"Nothing, sir."

 

The Sergeant turned to me. "You shouldn’t be making prank police calls. It’s a federal crime."

 

"I KNOW WHAT I SAW!" I shouted, tears forming in my eyes.

 

"Stay calm," the Sergeant said. "We don’t want this to escalate."

 

Dan intervened. "What if I stay with you tonight? I have my gun, so if there really is an intruder, I can protect you."

 

"That would be okay," I said, my voice trembling.

 

"Alright," the Sergeant said. "Call again if something really happens."

 

"We'll do that.," Dan replied.

 

We went back inside. I showed Dan where I saw the man. He told me he’d stay in my room, gun ready. I tried to sleep but saw him again. He was taller, all pale white. It was disgusting.

 

"DAN, SHOOT!" I screamed. He didn’t. I pushed him and asked what was wrong. He asked what I meant. The man was gone. Then Dan screamed, "HOLY SHIT, THAT IS WHAT YOU MEAN!"

 

He saw him, but I didn’t. He shot multiple times, but it seemed like he missed. He said it was in front of him. I asked why he could see it and I couldn’t. He didn't answer.

 

Then, everything went quiet. Dan stopped screaming. It started getting colder. I called his name. "DAN?" No answer. Whatever it was, it, it had killed him. I had tears in my eyes and about to start screaming in anger and frustration but then. In the corner of the room, it appeared again.

 

I ran to the nearest police station and told the Sergeant what happened. He looked at me, skeptical. "We searched the entire place. There was nothing."

 

"Dan saw it, but I couldn’t," I insisted. Suddenly, the door behind me opened. Turning around, there it was again. I tapped the Sergeant’s shoulder and asked if he could see it. He started screaming, "WHAT IN THE NAME OF GOD IS THAT?"

 

I turned, but it was gone again. This was a curse. It passes on to the nearest person upon the death of the current holder or by touch. I realized this after the Sergeant passed. I ran and kept running.

 

It was slow, but it always caught up. I booked a flight to Europe, knowing I’d be safe there for a while. As long as I didn’t touch anyone, it would need to walk to me. In Europe, I pretended to accidentally fall and touch someone without them asking why. This would give me plenty of time to find out what that Thing is. Later that day, I returned home.

 

Two years later, while shopping for dinner, I saw it again. The three-meter-tall man was walking towards me. I shook a lady’s hand and ran home. I wrote this to inform you of what it can do.

 

Please stay safe out there. Once you’re cursed, you can never escape. And because of this recent encounter, I know I’m next.
