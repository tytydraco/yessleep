People say small towns hold onto their stories longer than they should. If that’s true, then I’m sure Maywood Mills has white-knuckled its grip on theirs.

You probably haven’t heard of this place. I don’t blame you, I hadn’t either. Not until a couple of weeks back. And now that I’m here, I understand why. It’s as if the rest of the world quietly agreed to forget Maywood Mills ever existed… 

…and my gut says the town prefers it that way.

As I write this, I’ve locked myself in a rented room above a bar. It reeks of dried liquor and bleach in here. I’m trying my best not to think about the people who’ve stayed here before me, or what they did between these walls. If that wasn’t enough, the neon sign outside my window keeps sputtering in and out, painting the room sickly green. It’s going to give me an epileptic seizure any minute now.

I also jammed a chair under the doorknob… as I was instructed… just to be sure.

Before I go to bed, I’m going to try to lay out everything that’s happened in the last twenty-four hours. I apologize if I sound dramatic. I’ve covered some dark shit in my life, met a lot of broken people. But honestly… I’m… I’m lost. I’ve never seen anything like this. I can usually tell if there’s a rational spine running through a story within the first hour of digging into it. But here… I can’t find it.

There’s a legend buried in this town, A story that’s been told so many times it seems to have hardened into truth. Yeah… the story doesn’t just seem to live here. It seems to fester.

It’s easier if I start from the beginning.

It was Carla who found the town first. My colleague. She drove in yesterday, texted me the route, said she’d find a place to stay. We were supposed to drive up together, but life happened, I guess. I screwed things up. That’s the short version. I ended up spending the night in the hospital. Broken arm, three places. Don’t ask. 

Anyway, I said I’d meet here in the morning instead. Our plan was simple: find Maywood Mills, dig into the string of disappearances that had plagued the area for nearly two decades, and, more than anything, reopen the case that once had the town in the papers. 

Nadine Willes. Thirteen years old. 1998.

Poor girl had been stabbed… many times. More times than anyone who worked the original case ever felt comfortable saying out loud. The photos speak for themselves. They found her laid out on a flat rock deep in the woods. Whoever did it didn’t even try to hide their work. There were no leads. Cops couldn’t name any suspects which left the community without any answers. Rumors took over. That buzzing hearsay that creeps in when humans realize they don’t know what’s lurking in the dark. Eventually, the case went cold. Officially forgotten. We came here to open it back up.

Or at least… that’s what I told them.

Maywood Mills isn’t on most maps. You take the ferry out of Seattle, drive west past Port Angeles, and somewhere along the Olympic foothills the road ends. After that, it’s old logging routes that snake through fog-chocked forest. Narrow lanes, cracked asphalt, and treacherous curves. I never thought “praying for guardrails” would be on my bingo card, but there I was, wishing for them.

“Blink and you’ll miss the turnoff. Keep driving and you’ll dead-end at some old dam.” That’s what Carla texted me.

So obviously, my GPS gave up halfway, and she wasn’t answering her phone. So I had to navigate the foothills by myself, one hand on the wheel, the other in a cast, playing chicken with blind corners. I’d like to see Schumacher try.

Somewhere outside the town limits, I nearly wrecked my Porsche. The pavement was slick from yesterday’s torrential rain. A turn came up fast, I got distracted by a message on the phone - some legal bullshit that’s been chewing on my ankles for weeks - I got angry. Lost focus. Swerved. Came a few feet shy of turning myself into tree decor. 

That’s when I got my first real sense of the place.

I hadn’t even reached town yet, but something already felt… off. I staggered out of the car and threw up on the shoulder, then, everything went quiet. Not peaceful quiet, more like an eerie silence. The kind of silence I imagine falls in a jungle when a predator stalks its prey. The trees… insects… birds… even the nearby river. It was like the entire forest held its breath.

Then, somewhere in the distance, the dam released a sheet of water with a thunderous roar. I nearly leaped out of my skin.

That’s when I saw it: a moss-covered sign slumping in the brush. WELCOME TO MAYWOOD MILLS. I looked through the case files scattered across the passenger seat. I had an old photograph of the same sign, from thirty years ago. Back then, the paint was fresh. The letters straight. Someone cared back then, but I guess they had every right to stop.

I’ve always had a strange pull toward towns like this. I couldn’t tell you exactly why. Maybe it’s because I grew up in noise. Traffic, sirens, shrieking subway brakes. I’m a city rat by design. But places like this… they hum with a certain promise. You could disappear here. You could be nobody. No headlines, no pressure, no past dogging your heels. There was peace to be found.

However, that charm wears thin the longer you look. Because underneath the quiet, there’s this… weight. Like the atmosphere itself wants you to shrink. To stay small. To forget there’s a world beyond the woods. Nobody says it out loud, but you can feel the rules immediately. Dreaming is illegal here. Curiosity is an offense. They don’t like people leaving… and they like people arriving even less.

That’s what kills the dream for me. Not the isolation. Not the decay.

The people.

As I drove in, nobody waved. Nobody smiled. They just watched me roll past, faces blank and weathered, carved like worn gravestones. The only thing alive was their eyes, full of resentment, and something else, something heavy I couldn’t place at first. Suspicion. Grief. Maybe fear? Or maybe it was just the big yellow letters FBI on my jacket that spooked them.

Maywood Mills itself didn’t offer much to look at. A couple dozen houses, most of them sagging or boarded up. A handful of stubborn businesses clinging to life. There was a school and a church that had seen better days. And, of course, a bar. As if the depressing atmosphere wasn’t poisonous enough.

However, there was one thing that really caught my attention… 

The graffiti. 

Spray-painted across abandoned storefronts, rusting garage doors, and brick walls, was the same image, over and over.

A face… a crude drawing of a tall, skeletal figure in a long coat and top hat. His eyes were black, empty hollows. On some of the portraits, he was almost a skull. Then he had this wide, childish grin that stretched ear to ear… it really got under my skin for some reason. Most of the time, he was drawn holding a ring of keys. Not a few keys like the ones you and I own. No, it was a massive, jangling hoop of them. If you remember the Keymaker from The Matrix, you’ll know exactly what I mean.

I parked outside the bar. The whole building looked like it was one good gust away from collapsing. I doubted they’d cleaned the taps since the Reagan administration, but hey, beer is beer, and I’m not picky. Plus, I noticed they rented out rooms upstairs. If Carla was anywhere in this town, odds were she’d be here. 

The very moment I stepped inside, the ongoing conversations died mid-sentence. It looked exactly the way I imagined it. Wood-paneled walls, floorboards that stuck to your shoes, a few regulars slumped around the edges, and a jukebox that clearly lost the will to live. The floor creaked as I approached the bar. I flashed my badge, ordered a beer, and slid a photo across the counter. Carla’s face stared up between the bartender and me. 

“She came in yesterday,” I said. “Have you seen her?”

The bartender, her name was Lucy, took her time with the photo. Meanwhile, I studied her, she was way too pretty to be marooned in a town like this. Finally, she shook her head.

“Can’t say I have.” Then, after a beat.  “Sorry, but no outsiders have come through here in weeks. Maybe months.”

Her eyes came up to meet mine.

“What brings the FBI to Maywood Mills?”

“We’re reopening an old case,” I told her. “Nadine Willes.”

That name hit the room like a bell tone. Conversations that had just started picking up fell silent again. I could hear the drunks in the corner shift in their seats, glasses paused halfway to their mouths. I felt their eyes burn in the back of my neck. One of them even stood up like he meant to leave… then thought better of it.

Lucy didn’t react much, but something shifted behind her eyes. Sadness, I think. She was hard to read. Then , she nodded slowly, like she'd been waiting for this to happen.

“Figured someone would come back around eventually,” she said. “Why didn’t you and your partner come in together?”

I glanced down at the cast around my arm and tapped it lightly.

“Got delayed. Long story.”

She glanced down at it, said nothing. It almost made me uncomfortable, so I steered us back to the subject.

“So… Nadine Willies. You knew her?”

“Sure. Everyone did.” she said. “We went to the same school. Or, I mean, all of us did.” She gestured to the drunks in the corner who were still staring at me.

“Listen, you’re not exactly digging through pleasant memories. Countless investigators have been here over the years. Cops, journalists, crime junkies.”

“And none of them got anywhere?” I asked.

“We already know who did it,” she said.

“Who?”

She nodded past my shoulder.

“He’s right behind you”.

I turned. Out the window, across the cracked parking lot, sprayed across the brick wall - that painted face stared right back at me. 

“That?” I said, trying not to sound amused. “You’re saying that thing killed Nadine?”

She nodded. One of the drunks, a handyman, barked a laugh and swiveled on his stool.

“Hell, he’s behind all the weird shit that happens around here. Half this town swears they’ve seen him. Especially after a few drinks.”

He laughed. So did his friends. Lucy leaned a little closer, voice low enough to cut under the noise.

“Ignore them. They’ve been here since breakfast. But, unfortunately, they’re not wrong.” She held my gaze. “I’m sorry, Agent. But you’re chasing a ghost.”

I didn’t know what to say. Lucy pointed toward a map taped beside the register and showed me the quickest route to the nearest motel, said Carla might’ve checked in there. It felt like a nice and subtle way of saying “leave.” 

So I didn’t. 

There were vacant rooms upstairs, nothing close to five stars, but if Carla had checked into some motel miles away for a bit of luxury, she had another thing coming. This town is where the conversations were. This was where work was. 

So instead of heading for the door, I ordered steak and eggs and a room for the night. While Lucy disappeared into the kitchen, the handyman peeled himself off his stool and shuffled over. He was in his mid-forties, with a bloated red face, breath sour with Miller Lite. He sat down beside me without asking.

“His name’s Mr. Jangles,” he said, jerking his chin toward the fogged window. “Nadine Willes was his first. Back in ‘98, all the kids said it was him. Lives out in the woods past the dam. Nobody ventures out there alone anymore.”

“Mr. Jangles’?” I repeated. Trying not to let the skepticism show too much.

“That’s right. That’s what they called him. They say he has keys to every house in Maywood. That’s how you know he’s close. You hear’em.”

He mimed the sound, shaking his wrist a little. *Ch-ching, ch-ching, ch-ching.* More barking from his friends.

I looked back through the window. At that damned face. The top hat. The smile. The black, empty sockets. I have to admit, it creeped me out a little.

“So the Bureau’s chasing campfire stories now?” he asked, squinting.

I let the question hang.

“Urban legends don’t bother me. Lies do.” I said eventually. “We’re here for the truth.”

He let out a dry, smoker’s chuckle and tapped the bar with his dirty finger, right on the badge I’d left resting beside my glass.

“Might wanna get that fixed.” he said. “It’s chipped.”

I glanced down. He wasn’t wrong. The edge was scuffed. The cheap laminate curling just a little. I palmed it without saying anything.

Lucy came back and set the plate down in front of me.

“If you’re serious about digging into this,” she said, “talk to Mrs. Willes. She’s still out on the edge of town. Pink house. You can’t miss it. She… keeps to herself.” She hesitated, then added. “And do me a favor. Don’t tell her I sent you.”

I finished my food and headed back out. The sky looked bruised, like the rain was thinking about coming back. I followed Lucy’s directions along a cracked road, snapping a few photos of Mr. Jangles on the way. I couldn’t wait to hear what Carla would make of all this.

Lucy was right. The house was impossible to miss. Faded pink siding, shutters hanging crooked. Even in the middle of the afternoon, the curtains were drawn. The yard was crowded with the remains of a life that used to be loving and busy: material for an abandoned tree house, rusted tools, a collapsing stroller, a weather-beaten swing set.

It broke my heart a little.

I’ll fast‑forward through most of it; you’ve seen the scene before. A grieving mother loses her child, blames the world, and shuts the door on it. Nothing new there. But I walked away with two things… or three, if I’m being honest. 

First, she gave me a USB drive. Said it contained everything they managed to pull from Nadine’s old computer. According to her, Nadine recorded a message the day before she died. Second, Mrs. Willes didn’t talk about Mr. Jangles the way the guys at the bar did. No jokes. No eye‑rolling. No… She spoke of him like any other suspect I’ve comed across. 

And then there was the last thing. While she went to her bedroom to look for the USB, my eyes wandered around Nadine’s room. I found her old diary from the summer she died tucked in the back of a shelf. I shouldn’t have taken it. But I did.

Mrs. Willies came back a minute later and pressed the USB into my good hand.

“You should barricade your door tonight, Agent” she said. “Shut your blinds. If someone knocks, don’t answer. Stay still. Don’t look out if you hear anything.”

So… that was my day. By the time I headed back, the sun was dying behind the tree line. I called Carla again. She didn’t answer. What the hell is she up to? I’ll drive out to that motel tomorrow if I have to. I’m going to need her on this. She’s the charming one - the one people usually open up to. I’m better at the technical stuff… and pushing people over the edge.

Oh, and one last thing. I checked the USB.

I’ve only ever seen photos of Nadine with nineteen stab wounds in her body, so it was strange, wrong almost, to see her alive. I felt like I was watching a ghost. But there she was on my screen, sitting cross-legged on her bed like any other kid after school. She looked straight into the camera.

“He came back today,” she said. “During break. He wanted me to introduce him to the other kids.”

She smiled.

“I wrote a poem,” she said. “For him.”

She began to read:

As I was walking through the park,

I saw a figure in the dark.

His mask was white, his eyes like coal,

A chilling sight that froze my soul.

He wore a hat upon his head,

And from his mouth, no words were said.

He danced for me with jangling keys,

And whispered secrets in the breeze.

Mr. Jangles, tall and grim,

Would find the children, calling him.

He’d come for those who dared to stray,

To never see the light of day.

I think someone just tried the handle on my door. 

I couldn’t hear any footsteps in the hall, but the door definitely rattled… someone tried to get in. A moment later, I heard a set of keys jingle downstairs… Maybe Lucy’s locking up the bar and wanted to check on me… I mean, what else could it be? That’s the story I’m choosing. Anyway, I need to fix the badge before I go to sleep.

They say small towns hold onto their stories longer than they should. Out here, I’m starting to think that the story holds onto the town.

Tomorrow, I’m going to find Carla. I’ll probably swing by the school, too. The teachers must know something.

I need to gather as much material as I can before someone figures out who I am.

Before someone catches me in the lie.
