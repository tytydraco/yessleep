Imagine being able to transcend the boundaries of the physical world, to leave behind the shackles of the mundane and enter a realm where the laws of reality are but a distant memory. A realm where the veil between the worlds is thin, and the secrets of the universe await those brave enough to venture forth. This is the realm of the astral plane, a mystical dimension that has long fascinated and intimidated those who dare to explore its mysteries. 

For years, I had been drawn to the allure of the astral plane, sensing that it held the key to unlocking the deepest secrets of the human experience. And so, I embarked on a journey that would take me beyond the veil, into the very heart of the unknown. In this post, I invite you to join me on my eye-opening journey through the astral plane, as I share with you the revelations, the challenges, and the transformative power of this mystical realm. 

Traversing the astral plane is an endeavor fraught with profound risk and peril, reserved only for the most seasoned and intrepid of explorers. As a seasoned practitioner of meditation and mysticism, I'd spent countless hours studying the ancient tomes, pouring over dusty texts and seeking out wisdom from gurus and sages. And finally, after years of dedication, I felt ready to take the plunge.

I settled into my favorite armchair, surrounded by the familiar comforts of my dimly lit study. The flickering candles cast eerie shadows on the walls as I closed my eyes, focusing on my breath. The air was thick with the scent of incense, and the soft hum of a mantra echoed in my mind. I felt my body begin to relax, my mind quieting like a still pond.

As I slipped deeper into the trance, I became aware of a subtle vibration, a tingling sensation that started in the crown of my head and spread down through my spine. It was a sign, I knew, that I was approaching the threshold of the astral plane. My heart raced with excitement as I felt my consciousness begin to detach from my physical form.

I visualized myself floating above my body, watching as my limbs grew limp and still. The room around me began to blur and fade, replaced by a swirl of colors that seemed to pulse with an otherworldly energy. I felt myself being drawn into the vortex, pulled through a tunnel of iridescent light that seemed to stretch on forever.And then, suddenly, I was somewhere else. 

My own inaugural encounter with the Abyss of Eternity was a harrowing, psychologically shattering experience that left an indelible mark upon my psyche. As I drifted aimlessly through the all-encompassing, inky blackness, a palpable sense of isolation and dread consumed me, enveloping my senses and leaving me utterly unmoored. There were no discernible markers or points of reference to guide my way - just an endless, overwhelming void that seemed to stretch on into infinity. 

Time itself lost all meaning, leaving me unanchored and adrift in a nightmarish expanse, consumed by a primal terror at the thought of being trapped, separated from my physical form. I strained desperately to locate even the faintest glimmer of light, some sign that I had not been swallowed whole by an eternal nothingness. But the darkness was all-consuming, suffocating any ember of hope and leaving me profoundly, existentially alone. I have never experienced such a profound sense of isolation and abandonment, severed from the familiar tethers of the material world. The Abyss of Eternity stands as a harrowing reminder that the astral realm is a domain not to be trifled with. One wrong step, one moment of losing one's bearings, and you may find yourself irretrievably lost, just like I was - condemned to drift through an endless, soul-crushing oblivion, bereft of any means of escape. 

The weight of my own mortality hung heavy over me, a crushing burden that threatened to consume my very essence. I felt like a fragile, forgotten leaf, torn from its branch and left to wither in the void. The silence was deafening, a oppressive shroud that wrapped around me, squeezing the life from my astral form. Every attempt to scream, to cry out for help, was met with an eerie, unsettling silence. It was as if I had been erased from existence, left to wander the desolate expanse of the Abyss, forever trapped in a state of perpetual limbo.

The thought of being trapped in this abyss for eternity was a constant, gnawing terror that gnawed at my very soul. I was a ghost, a specter, a fleeting shadow of a life left unlived. The abyss seemed to stretch on forever, a boundless, endless chasm that yawned open before me like a hungry, devouring mouth. And I was its latest, helpless victim, powerless to resist its crushing, all-consuming gravity.

In that moment, I knew that I was staring into the very face of madness, my sanity teetering on the brink of collapse. The abyss had claimed me as it's own.

I opened my eyes, disoriented and confused. The last thing I remembered was being trapped, confined in a dark, cramped space. But now I found myself in an unfamiliar place, free from that oppressive feeling. How had I gotten here? I looked around, trying to piece together what had occurred, but there were no clues, no explanation for my sudden release. I found myself back in my body, the astral plane no longer my prison, and the fear of it diminished  felt abrupt, unexplained. I was left grasping for answers, uncertain of the events that had led to my liberation. All I knew was that I was no longer confined, but the how and why remained a mystery.

Caution, preparation, and an iron resolve are paramount when venturing into the unknown territories of the astral plane, for the consequences of failure are truly unimaginable.A sense of unease crept in as I realized I had no idea how I I was free of that prison and the relief I felt was so much greater than anything else I had ever felt. I returned back to my physical form with a new respect and fear of astral traveling. Out of all the experiences from others not one person had mentioned the Abyss. Maybe I was the first and I hope the last to go through it or maybe others had and they are still stuck there. I  shuddered and felt sick at the thought. Astral traveling was so freeing at first, the exhilaration over filled me and now all I feel when I remember is dread. There is one thing I know, that isn't what I had signed up for and I would never travel again.

As I settled into my everyday routine, the fear of revisiting the astral realm lingered. It was like an open wound that refused to heal, a constant reminder of the terror I had faced. Days turned into weeks, and the memory of the Abyss never faded. Instead, it haunted me at every turn. I avoided anything related to astral travel, fearing it might pull me back into that horrorshow. But fate has a twisted sense of humour. One exhausting night, after a gruelling day at work, I craved nothing more than a peaceful slumber. As I drifted off, my worst nightmare came true.

I found myself back in the astral plane, my soul separated from my body. Panicked, I looked around, expecting to see the Abyss at every turn. The familiar dread returned, and I realized with a jolt that I had been here before, and worse, I couldn't control my destination. I was drawn towards a dimly lit realm, the very embodiment of unease. As I penetrated the gloom, the surroundings grew darker still, and an eerie silence enveloped me.

I could feel a presence that threatened to swallow me whole. I had never encountered a dark, malevolent entity before, thought I have studied them in depth. These beings seemed to feed on fear and suffering, manipulating emotions to amplify terror and despair. As I ventured deeper, I felt an unseen force closing in around me, sending chills down my spine. I was alone, vulnerable, trapped in their domain. The air grew thick with a palpable malevolence, and I could almost hear the whispers of the entities, taunting and tormenting me. The dark entity created from illusion is a powerful and malevolent being manifested from the collective fears and nightmares of sentient beings.

Formed from the shadows of the mind, this entity has no true physical form, instead taking on a shifting, amorphous appearance that reflects the darkest imaginings of those who witness it. Its very existence is a testament to the power of the human psyche, as it draws strength from the darkness that lurks within the hearts of all creatures. With the ability to manipulate the perceptions and emotions of its victims, the dark entity can instill paralyzing terror, induce vivid hallucinations, and even consume the very essence of a being's soul. Those who dare to confront this malevolent force often find themselves overwhelmed by its sheer, otherworldly power, as it can seemingly bend the very fabric of reality to its will.

Only the bravest and most resolute of individuals, armed with unwavering courage and a strong sense of purpose, stand a chance of confronting and vanquishing this nightmarish creation of the mind. Their illusions were powerful, distorting my senses and perception, making it difficult to discern what was real. I felt my heart racing, my mind consumed by a growing panic, as I struggled to maintain my composure and find a way to escape their clutches. The presence of these dark beings was overwhelming, their very essence seeming to sap the life and energy from the surrounding environment. I knew I had to find a way to confront them, to break free from their grip, but the fear of the unknown paralyzed me, leaving me feeling helpless and utterly alone.

I had heard whispers of such malevolent beings that lurk in the astral realm, but confronting them directly was a heart-pounding, nightmarish ordeal that I would not wish upon anyone. The sheer malice and hunger for suffering that radiated from these entities was truly chilling. I fear what other dangerous encounters may lie in wait as I continue my journey through the astral plane. They subjected me to a torment that went beyond the physical, feeding on my fear and suffering. They manipulated my perceptions, distorting my senses and dragging me through a gauntlet of their own design. Hallucinations assailed me, the reality warping before my eyes. I felt my soul being slowly eroded with each step, the very essence of my being drained away. These entities thrived on my anguish, growing stronger with each cry of pain.

They kept me enclosed in a prison of darkness, a place with no escape. Torment and despair were their tools, and they used them expertly, whispering in my ear, taunting me with visions of a reality that would drive me mad. The more I suffered, the more they fed on my pain, each experience leaving me weakened and them ever more powerful. It seemed as if the very fabric of reality was warped in their presence, bending to their will. But amidst the terror, a glimmer of hope emerged. A mysterious force, one that I could not see or understand, began to counter the entities' power. It worked its way into my psyche, giving me a fleeting sense of clarity and purpose. With each assault, instead of succumbing to fear, I found a wellspring of courage within me. It was a force that seemed to repel the entities, and with each burst of fear that they instigated, I met it head-on, using the strength they so generously gave me.

Eventually, the entities retreated, their illusions fading away like the morning dew. 

This wasn't the last time that I traveled the astral plane and isn't even close to the most horrifying experiences I've had on my journeys. I'll post again and recount a few more of my experiences, just know the dangers and horrors of the astral realm are beyond comprehension. Be careful and safe travels
