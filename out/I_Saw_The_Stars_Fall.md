Ten years ago, I went missing for three days.

Nobody ever believed my story, and I’ve gone through so many different treatments, and therapists that tried to convince me that something else happened. No matter what, my story never changed. I know what happened, and nothing will convince me otherwise.

My friend brought this thread to my attention, and has even lent me his account to be able to write out my story. If there is anyone out there that will believe me, they’ll be here. Of course, there’s no guarantee of this, but at least the truth will be out there.

For starters, my name is Emily.

This happened when I was 10, back when I lived in Darkthorn, Ontario. I grew up in a small farm house a couple of miles on the outskirts of town, leaving us somewhat isolated. I liked the house because of the large field in the back, and all the animals we had.

The town itself was fairly isolated, I doubt anyone really knows of it, but the community was nice, with everyone practically knowing each other. The place even has its own legends. One of those originated from what happened to me.

In the early evening of June 16th, my father was doing roofwork when he fell off the ladder. He insisted he was fine, but when my mom saw him limping, she took him to the hospital, leaving me home alone for the third time since I turned 10.

It was exciting for me, as it meant my parents trusted me enough to keep an eye on things, even if it was only for an hour or so at a time. The only rules were to stay out of the gunsafe (which my parents kept the only keys on them), and don’t go out if it was dark.

That second rule was to avoid the risk of running into wild animals, but now I see it in a different light. I feel that anyone from Darkthorn that’s reading this would see a pun in the way I phrased that. It wasn’t intended.

My parents were gone so long that the sun had set, with my mother calling every hour or so to make sure I was okay. I never told her I was watching a 50s horror marathon on TV, instead swearing that I was watching some cartoons on Teletoon.

There were leftovers in the fridge, so I wasn’t worried about food, and the animals had been tended to before my dad fell off the ladder, so I just had to sit tight and wait for my parents to get home.

It was 9:00pm when I went to get myself a can of pop, my eyes drifting to the window in time to see stars moving in the sky. I did a double take, at first thinking it was the glare of the kitchen light playing tricks on me. 

When I saw the movement again, I ran upstairs to my room. My window overlooked the field behind our house, and with the light off I could clearly make out the stars in the sky. It took a moment for me to see it again.

The stars moved downwards like fireworks had just gone off. Five flickering lights slowly descending into the corn field, their light bright enough to cast shadows of the stalks across the backyard. As they reached the ground, they went out, leaving darkness behind.

I watched the field curiously, although it was too dark to really make anything out aside from the vague shape of the cornstalks swaying in the breeze. My eyes went back to the sky, expecting more stars to fall.

I opened the window to see if there were weird noises, getting a low snap from the cornfield in response. My eyes darted to the darkness below. Listening closely, I could hear the noise getting louder. 

Dim lights were moving through the corn towards my house. At first I thought it was a trick of the mind, like I had stared at a light for too long, and now it temporarily seared itself into my vision.

I reached for a flashlight I kept in my drawer, aiming it towards the cornfield. I didn’t turn it on right away out of fear that I’d attract attention. Five of the lights seemed to change direction as they got close, two going towards the barn, while two others went towards the road.

My heart nearly stopped when I saw the fifth stop right on the edge of the cornfield, just before going into the backyard. I could just barely make out its slender shape through the corn, the light of its body getting dimmer. My hands shook, the flashlight rattling.

The shape took a step forward, triggering the porch’s motion light, and giving me a clear look at it. It was human in shape, with glistening gray skin. Its head was round, with two black pits that stared up at me, its thin mouth curled in a smile.

I screamed, the flashlight falling from my hands, and clattering on the floor. I reached for the window, pulling it down as fast as I could. Unfortunately, it jammed with a few inches left. A noise downstairs made me crawl under my bed, pressing myself against the wall at the other end.

I had to cover my mouth when I heard the window open, the scent of melted plastic flowing into the room. It carefully slid its leg in, the floor not even creaking beneath its weight as it entered. Its other leg came in shortly after, stepping on the flashlight for a moment before pulling away. 

Its hand came down, long, clawed fingers wrapping themselves around the plastic handle to pick it up. I could hear it examining the flashlight, before turning it on, getting a startled clicking noise in response. It turned the flashlight off, then back on, then off again, before turning its attention to the closet.

As it opened the door, it turned on the flashlight, shining it around my clothes and toys, before turning it off. I saw it lean forward, the rustle of clothes audible as it touched them. It turned its attention to one of the toys, a teddy bear if I saw right, examining it for a moment before dropping it.

Its legs moved to the bedroom door, stopping just before exiting. I heard it finicking with the mirror on my dresser, before its waist twisted in my direction with a small clicking sound. Carefully, it walked over to my bed, and lowered itself onto its knees.

I pressed myself harder against the wall as its smiling face came into view. It stared at me for a moment, letting out a noise that sounded like a chuckle as it aimed my flashlight towards me, and turned it on. I screamed, fighting against the wall, but only sliding myself into the corner my bed was against.

The thing’s free hand slid under the bed with ease, grabbing my leg to pull me out. I kicked its hand, trying to make it let go. Instead I was forced onto my back, the thing kneeling next to me. It looked down at me with its small smile, tilting its head before slowly opening its mouth, a stinger tipped tongue slithering out from its thin lips.

I screamed, turning my body away before the tongue darted towards me, embedding itself in the floor. My hand went up, punching the thing on the top of the head. This caused its hand to let go of my leg, which I quickly brought up, and connected with its neck.

As the thing reeled in pain, I scrambled to get to my feet, running into the hall, and towards the stairs as fast as I could. I went down quickly, missing the last two steps, and twisting my ankle as I reached the bottom. The searing pain almost stopped me, but with tears in my eyes, I ran for the front door.

Another one of those things was waiting for me when I opened it, its hand held up at the doorknob’s height.

Screaming, I slammed the door shut, and stumbled backwards, tripping over my feet. I fell, landing head first on the hardwood floor. Stars filled my vision, the pain now too much to bear. One of the last things I remember is a shape coming into my view, kneeling next to me with its small grin, and its tongue embedding into my neck.

When I woke up, I was outside.

I could see the tops of trees, and I could feel the cool dirt beneath my fingers. After what felt like hours, I slowly sat up, seeing that I was in fact laying in a forest. I was wearing the clothes I had before, although they were slightly torn in places.

It took me a while to move, instead pulling my knees to my chest, and beginning to cry. My foot hurt, and my head was pounding. A small bump was formed on my neck, almost like a mosquito bite. A dull ache emitted from it.

Finally, I heard cars driving around. With pained effort, I got to my feet, and limped my way towards them. Taking breaks along the way to let the pain subside, I eventually reached a highway.

I practically ran to it, falling on my side as I reached the side of the road. A truck screeched to a halt as the driver saw me. A burly man came out in a hurry, with a blanket in hand. My vision blurred as I began crying again.

The man spoke in a low voice, comforting me as best as he could as he picked me up, and rushed me to a hospital. I remember him asking questions, but I wasn’t able to answer. Not even the doctors could get me to speak.

A few hours later, I was reunited with my parents, who had to drive three hours to get where I was.

I finally told my parents and the cops what happened, but when I told them about the things I saw, they assumed I was suppressing something much darker. The papers called them Starfolk, based on my earlier description of them descending.

We moved away from Darkthorn a few weeks later, and I haven’t been back there since. I never remembered what happened after they took me. 

The most I get are nightmares where I am laying on a metal table, the Starfolk smiling over me. I’m not sure what they were doing. I don’t even know if this is a memory, or an image of what might have happened.

After many frustrating therapy sessions, and stays in the hospital, I finally gave in. I told everyone what they wanted to hear, and they left me alone. It wasn’t until recently that I started opening up with people, and even then I don’t always tell them everything.

This is the first time in years that I’ve given people the full story. Part of me wishes I could tell you what happened after the Starfolk took me. The other part is grateful that I can’t.

But I will never forget the night I saw the stars fall.
