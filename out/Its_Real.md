I can feel my heart racing as I recount the events that unfolded last night... It's been weeks since I first saw that shadowy figure in my dreams, and now I am convinced that it's no longer just a figment of my imagination. It's real, and it's following me.

It all began with that dream a month ago. I remember lying in bed, paralyzed with fear as I tried to move my feet and look around. That's when I saw it - a dark, looming figure outside my window, grinning at me with a twisted, half-formed face. I woke up in a cold sweat, my heart pounding in my chest, as my mom knocked on my door, having heard me scream.

&#x200B;

At first, I tried to brush it off, convincing myself that it was just a nightmare, a trick of my subconscious. But the figure's presence never faded. I can feel it every night its always there, lurking in the shadows, watching my every move. Eventually I started avoiding going out at night, and I kept my curtains drawn in my room at all times, afraid that it would somehow find its way inside.

But last night, my worst fears became a reality. I was abruptly jolted awake by an eerie screeching sound that echoed through the darkness...

I strained my eyes, trying to figure out where the sound was coming from, and that's when I caught a glimpse of the figure, right beneath my bed  staring back at me, was a woman's face - ghostly pale and devoid of any facial features except for a gaping mouth and hollow eyes.

My body froze with panic as I watched it crawl slowly along the edge of my bed, inching closer towards me. I closed my eyes and prayed, feeling utterly helpless. I could sense its presence on my bed sheet, moving ever closer, and then...nothing.

This morning I woke up, feeling exhausted and shaken. I must have fallen asleep out of sheer fear, but I know that what happened last night was all too real. The woman is not just a dream, it's tangible and malevolent, and it's still out there, lurking, watching, waiting. I can't shake off the feeling of being hunted, and I fear that I may never be able to escape that woman's grasp.

I'm posting this in the hope that someone, anyone, will believe me and help me figure out how to rid myself of this torment. I can't go on like this, living in constant fear of this woman that seems to have taken a liking to me. I need answers, I need a solution, and I need it fast.

&#x200B;

I know that tonight will be another sleepless night. I'll keep my lights on, my eyes open, and my senses heightened, hoping to catch a glimpse of the figure before it catches me. I don't know what it wants or why it's chosen me, but I won't rest until I find out. I refuse to be a victim, and I'll do whatever it takes to rid myself of this shadowy nightmare that has become my reality.
