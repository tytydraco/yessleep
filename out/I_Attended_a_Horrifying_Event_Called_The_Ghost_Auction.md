"Are you ready, Ash?" Esther appeared at my door, wearing her favorite nightgown. She was grinning from ear to ear, clearly excited. Tonight, we were headed to an event she had described as "The Weirdest You'll Ever Attend."

About a week ago, Esther, my roommate, asked if I’d like to join her at something called "The Ghost Auction." The name immediately hooked me the second it left her lips.

"I’m sorry. The what auction??" I asked, frowning.

"Ghost," she replied.

I lived in a shared apartment with two other women. Esther and I enjoyed binge-watching horror movies so much, while Elly, the third one, avoided anything remotely spooky. Despite our differences, Esther and I bonded over our love of horror. It started with movies, but soon escalated—we visited haunted houses, wrote a script for an indie horror film, and even tried an Ouija board once.

Our horror-related experiences got weirder, darker, and creepier each time.

So you can imagine my excitement when she asked me to join her in attending The Ghost Auction. It sounded more bizarre, unsettling and, as expected, had to be creepier than all of our previous experiences combined.

"It's an event where ghosts—or spiritual entities—are placed inside glass tanks and auctioned off to the highest bidder," Esther explained.

"Define ‘best ghosts,’” I said skeptically. I mean, they were 'ghosts.'

"I have no idea," she replied. "That's exactly why I was curious to attend. What I just explained to you was the only information available on the event's website description on the dark web."

Our journey there wasn’t easy. We had to follow a strict set of rules. We switched cars several times, each driven by someone from the event’s crew. All the windows were painted black, so we couldn’t see where we were headed. By the time we arrived, I was thoroughly disoriented.

The building was like something out of a movie. Everyone was dressed in tuxedos and gowns, like they were attending a high-end gala. It was surreal.

"Esther Calloway, invitee number 201?" asked the man guarding the gate, scanning a list of names.

"The one and only," Esther replied confidently.

We walked in after the man pinned a red, strangely-shaped ribbon on her dress.

"Why didn’t he pin one on my dress too?" I whispered.

"Because the invitation is under my name, and I’m allowed to bring a plus one, a companion" she said with a shrug. "In fact," she added, "I have to bring a companion. It's mandatory for the first-timer's invitation to be accepted. "

The main hall was breathtakingly grand, like an auction house for priceless art. I couldn’t believe so much effort was put into bidding on ghosts.

The ghosts themselves were displayed along the walls in cylindrical glass tanks about the size of a one-liter soda bottle. Each tank had a mechanical lid on the top and bottom, as if designed to keep something dangerous from escaping. Inside, each ghost floated like a misty, translucent figure.

Each tank contained only one ghost. I examined them one by one, dead curious about how they were different—what made people willing to auction for them.

"How are they special?" I asked Esther. "They just look like regular human ghosts to me. Sure, they seem to be of different ages, races, appearances, and attires, but that’s about it, from what I can tell."

"What's special about them," Esther replied, seeming excited, "is simply the fact that they are ghosts."

Esther grinned. "Ashley, imagine having one of these in your house—on a desk next to your TV. When guests visit, they won’t see a goldfish in a bowl or a cat in a cage. They’ll see this. How many people do you know with a ghost as a conversation piece?"

I had to admit, it was a strange and intriguing idea.

We took our seats in the front row, right near the stage where the auctioneer would soon present the ghosts. As I settled in, I realized I needed a quick restroom break.

"Before it starts, I think I need to get to the restroom first," I told Esther, as I stood back up.

"Take care of yourself, Ash," she said, her tone oddly serious.

In our three years of friendship, I’d never heard her sound so attentive.

In the restroom, I was inside one of the stalls when two women entered. Their voices echoed as they chatted right outside of my door.

"It's really crowded tonight," one of them said.

"There are a lot of new invitees today," the other responded.

"Aren't there just about twelve or so?"

"The new invitees, yeah. But they have to come in pairs to be accepted for their first event, remember? That’s how it was for us back in the day. So that makes twenty-four in total."

"Oh, yeah, I remember now. It was so long ago for us—I almost forgot."

I could see their heels through the gap under the door as they washed their hands and adjusted their makeup.

"It’s mandatory to bring a plus-one for you to be accepted to attend your first event," one of them continued.

"Secrecy is everything," her friend added. "We all have to hold the same secret to make sure nothing gets leaked."

My chest tightened. Something about their conversation made me uneasy.

"Yeah. Understandably," her friend replied. "For our first invitation to be accepted, we first-timers are required to bring our very first future ghosts with us to this event."

"Our companion's soul would be extracted at the event, turning them into ghosts and placing them inside a small glass tank."

"We first-timers are only allowed to watch, not to participate in the auction."

My blood ran cold.

"But we are allowed to bring home a souvenir, though. The companion we brought to the event—we are allowed to take them home as a ghost, inside a small glass tank."

I shivered. Horror consumed me almost instantly.

One of the women continued speaking as they turned off the faucet.

"I still have mine at home."
