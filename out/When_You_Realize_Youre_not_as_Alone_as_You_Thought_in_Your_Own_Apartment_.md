I’ve always been the kind of guy who gets by with the bare minimum, not by choice, but by necessity. I work the night shift at a supermarket, a dead-end job that barely pays enough to keep a roof over my head and some food in the fridge. My apartment is a rat hole on the top floor of an old building that seems ready to collapse every time the wind blows. But it’s cheap, and honestly, I can’t afford to be picky.

The walls are so thin that I know my downstairs neighbor, a woman named Madeline, always goes to bed at 10PM because I can hear the theme song of her favorite show echoing in my room. Hot water is unreliable, leaks are everywhere. At least there’s an elevator (broken for months, of course lmao). In short, it’s not the Ritz, but it’s home.

It all started on a Tuesday night. I came home from grocery shopping, exhausted as usual, my back aching. I dropped the bags on the wobbly table in my tiny kitchenette, took out the trash, and when I came back upstairs, I noticed something stuck to my apartment door. A yellow post-it.

It made me smile at first. “A welcome note ? A message from the agency ?” I peeled the paper off and read it.

“I know what you’re doing.”

No signature. No context. Just that. I crumpled it up and tossed it in the trash.

“Great, some bored neighbor,” I thought. By the next day, I had already forgotten about it.

A few days later, another post-it. This time, it was inside my apartment, stuck to the mirror in my bathroom. The yellow paper stood out against the foggy, grimy surface. The message read :

“You think we can’t see you ?”

A strange sensation ran down my spine. It was clearly a joke… but my bigger concern was to know who had access to my apartment ?

I tried to rationalize it. Maybe I’d forgotten to lock the door ? The neighborhood is a dump ; there are teens hanging around in the hallways, sometimes junkies. But it didn’t make sense. Why just a post-it ? And why me ? I’m just a nobody, no money, probable no future, unless I win the lottery lol.

I convinced myself it was just a stupid prank and doubled down on my habits. From that point on, I checked the door lock religiously. Once. Twice. Sometimes three times.

The third message appeared a week later. This time, it was on my pillow.

“You should stop doing that.”

I wasn’t laughing anymore. Someone was breaking into my apartment. Someone knew how to mess with my head.

I contacted the building manager. A greedy, unpleasant guy who barely glanced up from his phone.

Here’s how our conversation went:

“— Are you sure it’s not your girlfriend?” he asked, smirking.
“— I don’t have a girlfriend.
— Then maybe it’s a neighbor. I can’t keep track of everyone, man. If you want cameras or a new lock, that’s on you.”

So, I installed an extra lock and bought a cheap little camera on sale. I pointed it at the front door. Every day, I reviewed the footage. Nothing. No noises. No shadows. And yet, the post-its kept appearing, always in blind spots the camera couldn’t see.

Then the messages started changing tone.

“You shouldn’t do that with the bags.”

What bags ? My groceries ? My trash ?

“This won’t end well for you.”

I wasn’t sleeping anymore. The idea of someone entering my space, touching my things, was unbearable. But that wasn’t all. I began noticing other details I hadn’t before: objects slightly moved, footprints in the dusty floor.

One evening, I came home earlier than usual. I wanted to catch this person in the act. Grocery bag in hand, I unlocked the door slowly. Everything was silent. But something felt off. There was a smell I didn’t recognize. A metallic, sweaty smell.

And then I saw him.

A man. Sitting in my chair, in the shadows. He was wearing dirty clothes, a faded beanie. His hands rested on my papers, his nails black and cracked. He looked at me with an almost friendly smile.

“Hey” he said, like we knew each other.

I froze, unable to speak.

“We need to talk” he continued.

That’s when I noticed what he was holding in his hand: my kitchen knife. He was gripping it so tightly that his knuckles were white.

“I know everything, you know. I’ve been watching you for weeks. You’re not very discreet.”

“Who are you?” I managed to stammer.

“Me ? Nobody important. Just a guy like you. But you… you’ve got things to hide, don’t you?”

I shook my head, trembling.

“No… I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

He chuckled softly.

“We all have secrets. And I like finding out other people’s. And you… you’re my favorite.”

I didn’t wait for him to say more. I threw my grocery bag at him and bolted out of the apartment, screaming for help.

When the police arrived, he was gone. No trace of the man. No post-its. Nothing, except my bedroom window, open.

The neighbors heard nothing, as usual. Without any evidence, the case was closed.

Since then, I’ve moved. I found another apartment in another city, barely better than the last one. I haven’t heard from the guy, and I hope I never do. But ever since that night, just the sight of a post-it is enough to make me break out in a cold sweat.
