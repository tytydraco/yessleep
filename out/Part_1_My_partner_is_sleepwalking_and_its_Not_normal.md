Hi. I’ve never made a post like this before. I never thought I would have a reason to. But things have… Escalated, and, honestly, I’m scared.

For some backstory, my husband and I recently moved into a historic home. It’s a beautiful fixer-upper, painted in the weary shades of a long-forgotten storm, all water-stained grays and peeling, muddy browns. Pre-war, though our real estate agent neglected to specify *which* war.

Huge kitchen with lots of natural lighting, and the perfect study for my husband’s projects, which I selfishly love because it keeps him home more.

It is, for all intents and purposes, our dream home.

Sure, there’s been some weird things you expect with an old house; random cold spots and a faint, sweet-rotten smell, kind of how old people smell, honestly. Nothing to worry that much about, right?

It started out with him forgetting things. And I’m not talking about his keys (which I found in the refrigerator thrice), I’m talking about things like *how to brush his teeth.* He told me that it was like the muscle memory of his morning routine had just been… Erased.

Then, the recurring dream we’ve both been having. I will try to describe it as best I can.

The dream always starts with a deceptive normalcy. We’re on the couch, the worn fabric familiar under my hands. My husband is beside me, his fingers laced with mine.

At first, the room is just… Our living room. That’s our wedding photos on the wall, our diplomas on the mantle, our TV we rarely use. And then the silence presses in. Not as an absence of sound, the way you might think of silence, but as a *presence,* a low, sub-audible hum that vibrates in my teeth, even in my dreams.

Then, the far wall seems to soften, the pattern on the wallpaper bleeding like wet ink. And—and this is the part that scares me the most—the room begins to *breathe.* I don’t know how else to describe it. It is like our home has become a living, breathing thing. And it’s hungry.

The walls don’t rush away; they simply recede, the ceiling lifting into a formless, starless black. The couch beneath us becomes an island adrift in a vast, dark sea. The light from our lamp shrinks from a warm pool to a desperate, shrinking coin of yellow, illuminating nothing but our clasped hands and the terror on my husband’s face.

And then I wake up. Night after night, the same dream, with the receding walls and the devastating loneliness, even though my husband is right next to me.

I finally got the courage to talk to my husband about it last week, and he told me he’s been having the same exact dream ever since we moved in.

Does anybody know what that’s about? Could it be something to do with the house being so old?

Now, back to the point of my post. The sleepwalking. He’s never sleepwalked before, but again, the stress of a move, right? I didn’t think anything of it. But last night, when I found him, he… He scared me. The man I love, the man I’ve been married to for ten years, actually scared the shit out of me.

He was standing in the center of our living room, staring straight up at the ceiling, scratching at his arms until he bled, feverishly repeating the same phrase over and over again:

“There’s a quiet place behind everything. I think I’m almost there.”

I remembered you’re not supposed to wake sleepwalkers, so I tried to grab his hands as gently as I could, to prevent him from causing more harm to himself. He didn’t react. He just kept repeating that damn phrase, about how there’s a quiet place behind everything.

Eventually, he woke up, and I… I’ve never seen him so scared. He just kept shouting my name, even though I was holding him, asking where I was. I finally got him into the bathroom to clean and bandage his scraped up arms, and then got him back into bed.

He’s still sleeping as I type this all up, but I can’t stay in the bedroom. I’m sitting in the kitchen, and the smell of old flowers and wet soil is so strong it’s making me nauseous.

I tried to look up the previous owners online. It was hard to find anything, but I did find a scanned newspaper article from 1972. The headline was: “Local Man Found Wandering, Claims He ‘Lived in the Walls.’”

The article said he was the sole resident of this house. When they found him, he was malnourished and kept repeating that he’d been “trying to get back to the quiet.” He was committed to a state hospital. He never spoke a coherent word again.

I think I’m going to call the neurologist in the morning. But I don’t think this is a problem a doctor can fix.
