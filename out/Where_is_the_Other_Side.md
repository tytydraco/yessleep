I bought my house after my husband died of suicide 6 months ago. I couldn’t afford our house together anymore and couldn’t bear to stay there with the feeling of emptiness in the halls and rooms where my husband and I used to laugh and have deep conversations. I miss him with all my heart and I can’t go a day without thinking about him and the 6 years of our young lives together. 

My new house is very small and empty, it feels like i’m leaving room for him to come back and move in. There are three bedrooms, a living room, a modest kitchen, two bathrooms and an open basement. It sounds like i’m boasting about the comfortable home I have but I need to write down the happy things in my life because it feels like there is only sadness left. The only reason I can afford this home is because of savings my husband left behind from his very supportive job. I now work as a waitress at a local yacht club. I’m so lucky I got this job, the rich old men that eat there every evening tip young women like me very well. I get uncomfortable whenever a 60 year old man calls me baby as a 24 year old woman but money is money.
I had a day off today so I continued unpacking my things, the only room I have unpacked at the moment is my own. I decided to unpack what would be my “library” room, the room up the stairs, where I will keep my bookshelves, computer, my legos and all my little posters and knick knacks. I have an insane amount of comic books my husband and I used to collect, as well as my favorite HP Lovecraft books and classics like Dracula, The Divine Comedy and Poe’s poetic collections. I know, I am a nerd. 

It hit 2 am when I noticed something, something I didn’t notice even though I’d been in that room all day. A door had appeared. Yes I made sure it wasn’t the door that led out of the room, but this one is locked. I’m so confused. No one mentioned another room, I have never seen this door a day in my life, and why is the door on the wall where there is nothing but the sky behind it. 

I opened the door. Nothing but pitch black darkness existed past the threshold, not even the sky with the ground below, there was nothingness. There existed nothing but an ethereal cacophony and a strong rush of cool air. I dropped a pen to see if a floor existed past the door, there was. I didn’t dare to walk through the threshold until I was completely sure there was room for my feet. I ran down the stairs and out the door to my house to look at the outside of the wall where the door existed. There was nothing but the paneling and windows that had already existed on the outside of my house. I ran back inside and to my horror, the door seemed to have a dim light at the end of the tunnel. I could hear my husband whisper my name with a thousand voices. This can’t be real, I must be dreaming. I decided there is nothing left but curiosity left in my life and I stepped through the threshold. 

I don’t know how to explain it but there wasn’t a floor, it felt as if I was walking on clouds. Was I drugged? What’s happening? My husbands whispers suddenly turned into hellish screams of my name like a million voices of tortured souls. I started running toward the light but the closer I got, it never got brighter but the door I had walked through continued to get further away. The screams continued to get louder and turned into ear piercing screams as if they were right next to me. I started crying because I could hear the pain of the voices that sounded like my husband screaming my name. I was grabbed by ankle and descended through the clouds I’d been running on.

I screamed and cried and continued to fall for what felt like HOURS. My voice gave out from screaming my husbands name, but they never stopped screaming mine. I fell onto another cloud in the sea of darkness but, this wasn’t just darkness. The light was right in front of me in the form of another door. I walked through it. I million eyes were on me, shadows of souls with eyes all on me. I began to cry again and I felt the weight of the pain of every soul in that room. The souls formed a hallway for me to continue walking forward. As I reached the end of the souls I fell on my knees as the sight of my husband, lifeless laying on the couch he shot himself on, came into view. The room was white and the only color was the brown couch, the blood from my husbands head, and the black shadows of the screaming souls. My husband was one of those souls now. 

He suddenly sat up and faced me, “Katrina” he said in the weakest, shakiest voice I had ever heard. It was barely his own, it sounded like it was the last breath he ever took and it was all he could get out. The walls melted around me and the souls disappeared. Another door appeared infront of me and I walked through it. A man sitting in a chair with a single spotlight on him came into view. “Who are you?” I asked him, no response. “Hello??? Who ARE you?” I started getting upset and then he spoke. 

“ Your husband is dead, you have joined him.”
“But I’m not with him? Why can’t I reach him?” I cried.
“You’re not to the other side yet.”
“Where is the other side?” I screamed and cried in confusion.
“Purgatory, the souls of those who left their world, to the agony of their own hands, are sent here to renounce their sin and the pain of the life they left behind to hopefully gain recognition of those in paradise and to join them in the happiness their life didn’t give them.”
 “I killed myself?”
“Yes.”

The pain of my own decision had hit me like a wall. Those I left behind, the life I had left to the relentless pain in my heart, was gone. How long did I have to wait here? How do I get to the other side of purgatory? When do I see my husband again? Will I ever get to see him again? Will I ever make it to paradise?

The souls I have joined in purgatory are all people who have been through hell on earth only to feel isolated on the other side because of their decision. The void that is purgatory feels like an eternity of isolation and the only thing you have is your own thoughts. How do I renounce my sin and pain of my life if all I can think about is my regret and the suffering I am currently in? Purgatory looks like the garden of eden, although I am alone and the sky is grey. The color has been washed from the garden, grey and barren plants, and I can’t imagine the beauty of what the garden could be because all that is left in my thoughts is what I have done to cause the garden to lose color. The only color is the redness of the apples on the apple tree. I choose not to eat the apples here and I wish I chose not to eat the apples (the bullet and the wrong decisions I knowingly made) in my old life. If I could do it all over again I’d live my life in the light of my lost husband and live by my happiness and the choice I have in the decisions I make in my own life. Sin and wrong decisions are inevitable but the effect they have on me and those around me are left to my own hand. I wish I could’ve weighed my decisions in my life with the heavier weight of their effects on my eternal body, my soul.
