I've always had trouble losing weight.

I've tried everything. From the most classic diets to the latest fads. And I really mean « tried », because I never lasted very long before slipping back into my old habits.

Vanessa had been my best friend since high school, and she too was in the same situation as me and had endured the mockery of others all her life.

So when I had a drink with her on a restaurant terrace one Saturday afternoon and saw her radiant and happier than I'd ever known her, I knew something had changed.

"Listen, I've just found the miracle weight-loss product," she said excitedly. "We've always been led to believe that we had to suffer for months on end to lose weight, but that's over and done with.

"Vanessa, are you talking about liposuction? Because otherwise I’m not following you and you know I'd never do that, I'm too scared of the anesthesia".

She simply smiled at me and turned to take something from her bag and show it to me.

A white pill.

"What's this?" I asked suspiciously.

"The famous miracle pill darling, the one that will finally free us both from all these pounds" she said, staring intently into my eyes.

Even though I was suspicious, I asked her for more information. She had lost 10 pounds in 1 week without changing her diet. Side effects? None whatsoever. The pill was the result of years of work and experimentation by a laboratory belonging to a huge pharmaceutical group. And it was now being tested on people.

"What the hell's inside it? Are you sure it's legal?" I asked.

"They showed me what was inside at the institute where the tests are carried out and monitored by professional doctors. There are just lots of tiny little hard white balls in it. That's all. Obviously they didn't tell me exactly what it was, they have to protect their formula," she said, scratching her arm carelessly. 

I pondered her words in silence, watching people stroll down the street.

A gorgeous girl, blonde, with slender, firm legs like I'd always wanted, walked past me, laughing at a joke her boyfriend had just told her. Yet another thing I didn't have either.

"You know what? Fuck it, I'm in," I said smiling and full of confidence.

-

The institute's premises looked brand new. I looked around, already in awe of the cleanliness and organization of the place. A charming lady had welcomed me and given me a whole bunch of forms to fill in, mainly information about my health and weight.

Before I sat down, she looked at me kindly and said, "You can't imagine yet how much this will change your life." 

I smiled, and sat down in the waiting room to carefully fill out my forms. I was determined to take part. There was no way I was going to get recalled for not taking the experiment they were conducting seriously enough.

-

After returning my forms to the lady at reception and waiting for about an hour, I found myself in a small room with a doctor in a white coat and teeth of the same color.

"Well, I think you'll be happy to know that you have exactly the profile we're looking for in our tests," he said, smiling.

My heart squeezed with joy.

He explained the experiment to me. All I had to do was take a white pill every week, weigh myself and come to the institute at the end of the week for a few tests and physical diagnostics to see if everything was going well.

I could expect to lose between 10 and 15 pounds a week, without changing my diet or physical activity. It sounded impossible, but after all, what was I risking by trying?

-

I didn't feel any difference the first few days after taking the white pill.

In fact, after a few days I even told myself that I was probably stupid to have started this test, which was probably a scam.

I weighed myself to put an end to my illusions once and for all, and what I saw on the scale made my eyes widen with surprise. I'd lost 6 pounds in 3 days.

"Shit, it really works!" I exclaimed in my bathroom.

-

In the days that followed, I felt incredibly well. I continued to live my life as normal and didn't pay much attention to what I ate. I honestly didn't feel any difference. Just a slight tickling sensation from time to time in my lower abdomen, but it was so subtle. I wasn't going to worry or complain about it.

At the end of the week I went for my follow-up at the institute and they were delighted, as was I, to see that everything was going well.

Even the doctors and nurses seemed overexcited and seemed to move faster and more eagerly to deal with these incredible results.

I went home after taking my new white pill for the week to start the 2nd week of testing.

And that's when my nightmare began to come to life.

-

From day one, I could feel that something was wrong.

I felt muddy, my arms and legs itched like I had hives. I could scratch all over, but the ticklish sensation that I'd only slightly felt in my lower abdomen the first week had now spread to almost all my body.

I also felt like I had a full belly, as if I'd just stuffed myself with burgers and fries. And yet, it was just morning and all I'd eaten the day before was a noodle dish with a bit of chicken.

Was this a deliberate effect of the pile? After all, the last thing I wanted right now was to eat.

As my discomfort wasn't going away, I decided to call Vanessa to see if she too had experienced the same sensations in week 2. After all, she was in her 3rd week now and hadn't died yet.

The phone rang.

"Hi Vanessa it's me, how are you doing?" 

A silence, and the sound of a throat struggling to breathe.

"Vanessa? Hey are you okay?"

"I'm fine," she finally replied in a pasty voice.

"You don't sound like it," I said, starting to worry more about her than about me now. 

I kept trying to chat with her, but she seemed almost out of it. After a while I told her I was going to come and see her to make sure everything was all right and have a little chat. I didn't even tell her how sick I felt too.

-

"Come in," Vanessa said from the sofa in the living room after I knocked on her door.

I took a few steps in the unusual darkness of the living room.

"Vanessa, don't you want me to turn on the lights?"

"No!" she yelled. "No... When the light's on, I feel like I can see things moving all around me. Leave it like that, it's better." 

I approached her while forcing myself not to scratch my arms, and I gasped.

She'd lost at least 60 pounds. She'd been really overweight before this so you couldn’t see her bones yet, but if she kept losing weight at this rate, that was what was going to happen.

"Vanessa what the fuck? What happened to you?"

She slowly turned her head towards me and said with a weird smile on her lips, "Am I not beautiful?"

"Vanessa you have to stop taking those pills now, can't you see you're killing yourself?"

She grunted something in disagreement and scratched her left arm so hard. I could hear the sound of her fingernails almost digging into her skin. I got goose bumps and held back the sudden urge to scratch my whole body, the tickling of which was becoming more and more unbearable.

I gave her a glass of fresh fruit juice and chatted with her while holding her hand to comfort her. After a while she seemed to come to her senses. She told me that she too had had the same sensations as me, and that as I could see it was getting worse by the 3rd week. 

We both finally agreed not to continue with the experiment and to go to the institute the next morning to inform them and ask them to take care of all the treatments we would need to recover physically from their "miracle pill".

It was late by the time we'd finished our chat, and we both dozed off together on the sofa, sharing a blanket.

-

Something woke me up.

A viscous sensation on my left hand.

I opened my eyelids and took a while to remember where I was and why. Then I looked down at what was strangely tickling my hand.

It was some sort of slimy, gooey mass now beading against my leg.

"Yuck!" I yelled, rising from the couch with a jerk.

Vanessa still seemed to be sleeping peacefully, her face turned to the left.

What the fuck was that?

My eyes were still misty with sleep, so I slowly took a few steps forward to bring my eyes closer to the shapeless mass that was now on the floor and continuing to drip from the sofa.

And suddenly I realized what it was.

Worms.

Dozens, hundreds of wriggling white worms.

My breath caught in my throat and the hairs on my arms bristled with disgust.

"Vanessa wake up!" I said, rushing over to her.

She didn't react.

No.

I slowly walked around the couch to see her face.

"No!" I screamed, sobs blocking my throat.

Hundreds of slimy white worms were in her mouth and seemed to be spilling out of it onto the floor like some kind of foul waterfall of horror.

Not only were they coming out of her mouth, but also out of her eyes, nose and ears. It was as if her whole body was full of them and the overflow was now pouring out of every possible exit.

She was dead, I didn't need a coroner to tell me. The only movements still going through her body were those of the worms that continued to pour out of her onto the floor.

I vomited what little I had in my stomach, acidic bile burning my throat.

As I caught my breath and opened my eyes, I looked down. 

And there, in the liquid I'd coughed up, I saw them. White worms. They were inside me too. 

That was their famous weight-loss pile. White worms that hatched inside people to feed on what was inside them. But obviously, they had underestimated their reproductive capacity.

Was it already too late? I could now feel them swarming inside me, in my stomach, my intestines. My arms, my legs. 

This tickling sensation all over my body...

I called the police and an ambulance, and prayed it wouldn't be too late. At least for me, I said to myself, looking at Vanessa's shell.

-

Help arrived.

I was hospitalized and the doctors administered a shock treatment to treat the parasites infesting my entire body. They told me they'd never seen anything like it.

A week later, I was discharged from the hospital, only to realize that the institute had simply disappeared. The premises had been completely emptied, and a "for rent" sign was visible on the door. No telephone number worked, and the website no longer existed. It was as if it had never existed.

I've since lost weight on a healthy diet, as a tribute to Vanessa and in fulfillment of what we both wished for.

But sometimes, I feel a familiar sensation in my lower abdomen. 

And I can't help but wonder.

Is this just an illusion of my mind.

Or did the doctors forget to remove some eggs from my body?
