As soon as Kevin entered, his first action was to collapse into a seat. I could suddenly feel a short, but powerful sense of fatigue emanating from him. It was clear he had experienced things like this before, but perhaps he wasn’t entirely used to it yet. 

I took a seat in front of him.

"Explain."

He sighed and paused for a moment. Then he began to speak.

"What you just saw is one of the many... Creatures, I guess, that have been following me for years. I don't know their origin, why they're following me of all people, or why they even started to do so, but they've been trying to hunt me down for years. They're the reason why I live alone, why I keep selling the apartments I live in, why I keep moving as frequently as possible. Ironically, It's why I left Austria in the first place. I just thought I should clarify that. In case you were wondering why I didn't explain my reason for moving."

"Many? There's more of those things? Are they all stretched out versions of you?"

"Some are indeed deformed versions of me, but many are far worse. You're lucky one of the deformed ones arrived here. If it was the one that followed me to the airport... Well, let's just say you wouldn't have recovered from the shock as quickly. I can assure you I didn't."

I shivered at the thought of how he described this this being.

"Can you explain what these things are? Are there any patterns in their appearance? Do you know their origin?"

"I have no clue what their origins are, however I wouldn't describe them as "monsters". More like deformed humans. Or maybe I’m just too used to them to call them monsters.

Many resemble me. They all have human characteristics with something off about them. Some more prominent than others. So far, I've encountered five of them. Three were de-formed versions of me, the fourth the one that found me at the airport after stalking me for weeks, and a fifth."

I stared at him, but he didn’t react. Something was making him reconsider mentioning the fifth creature.

„And what the fuck possessed you to drag me into this? You could have rented a house and had the same results! I don’t need to be a part of whatever demonic shit you’ve been experiencing.”

He continued to stare at me, almost expressionless at this point, but after what seemed like painful consideration, he spoke.

„It’s because… They started following me the moment I entered your house.”

„Now? You lied to m-”

„No! Of course not! Before I moved, remember? I forgot what it was. Maybe you owed me money, but I came to pick something up from your house. When I left, someone called me, and when I hung up…. The fit one was there. Staring at me from the parking lot.”

He exhaled slowly.

„If only I could have appreciated how unspeakably lucky I was to be alive and sane. If only I knew what that thing could do. If only I fucking knew so I could have left immediately….”

He was panting by this point, so I sat there in silence for a few seconds, waiting for him to calm down.

„I’m sorry…. I’m-„

His words were cut short by a squeal emanating from my backyard.

„KeEeEeeeEEviiinnnnNnn! III FOUND YOOOOUUU!!!!”

I watched blood drain from his face as the morbidly high-pitched scream rang out. He stood up, accidenrtially kicking the chair from below him, and sprinted over to my window to close the curtains.

„Kevin? What was that?”

„The fucker followed me from the airport. Oh god… Why that one? Of all of them why that one? Why now? „

„KeeeEEEEEViiiN! I knoooww you’ree iinnN Thhereee!!! You’re STILL RUNNING! I thought you would have GIIIVVEnnnn UPPP since I LAAASSTTTT CHASED YOUUUUUUUUUU!!”

„NOOO! NO! NO! YOU FUCKING MONSTER, I'M SICK OF YOU. I'm NOT running! I'll be safe here, SO GO TO FUCKING HELL!”

Kevins rage surprised, and to an extent, disturbed me, but I didn't want to judge him. I had no way of knowing when I would have reached this point in his place.

"NooOoooOO!!! KeeeEEEvviiIIInnn..... YOU DAMN COWWWAARDDD!!!! You'reeerree CURSED!! CURSED!!! THAT'S IT! SoooOOooooo.... How about YOU ACCEPT IT YOU WEAK BAG OF FllleeeeeSHHHH."

The screeching reached a crescendo.... And stopped.

I finally forced myself to look at the window. The curtains were still drawn, but I could make out the creatures rough silhouette through the thin fabric. It was far shorter than I expected it to be, although its small, seemingly compressed legs added to that more than its actual body structure. A large piece of.... Flesh, perhaps? Was visible in the place of one pf it's arms. The other seemed normal enough with the exception of it's seemingly fingerless hand. It's neck was what truly disturbed me. It jutted out of it's torso like a pole, reaching at least three meters in length before curving back down, adorned with a face with a similar structure to Kevins.

Then the painfully obvious fact hit me. We were on the second floor. The thing was that fucking large.

"Kevin.... Can anyone else see that thing?"

"I wouldn't know. It only appears for seconds at a time... But in that timeframe, it moves fast. Unnaturally so."

"Since it has a need to do that, I'll assume they can. Can we just call the police to deal with this."

Kevin grinned and let out a small, sarcastic sigh.

"If only. It will kill both of us the second I dial the number. He told me as much when I first saw him."

"Have you ever considered recording any of them?"

"How dumb do you think I am? Of course, I did. They fuck up pixels wherever they go. My phone hasn't recovered from when the stretched one first came to my door. The videos gone too."

"Let's see what happens then. It's obscured by the curtains anyway."

I pulled out my phone and opened the camera.

"NO!! NO!! Stop for fucks sake! This isn't an experiment! That thing knocked down a fucking shack a few years ago! I watched it!"

CLICK

It was gone.

It was fucking gone! So quickly it was almost comedic!

I put the phone away and stared at Kevin, shrugging sarcastically.

"I hope you didn't lose too much money when it destroyed that shack. All it would have taken to get it back is some extra space in your camera roll!"

"You think you're being funny? You think you can mock years of my life wasted by these beings, and dismiss it as a joke?"

"I can dismiss it as a few pixels instead if you wan-"

"SHUT THE FUCK UP YOU NARCISSIST!!"

Silence

Pure silence. 

"I'm... Sorry.. I... Whatever. Fuck it."

We sat on the couch in complete silence for what seemed like hours. I attempted to break it.

"Didn't you say you had a dog? Why isn't it here?"

"I don't. Why would you think that?"

"You asked me if I had food for it multiple times. What happened to it?"

"In the chat?"

"Yeah. Where else?"
