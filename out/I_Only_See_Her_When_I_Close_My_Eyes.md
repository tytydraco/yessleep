She first started showing up in my dreams. 

Each dream was the same. 

I'd be watching from above, spectating something I didn't quite understand at first. 

It was always the bedroom of a child. In the middle of this bedroom, resided a bed, where a kid would always be fast asleep. 

The first time I had this dream, I was deeply confused. I had this uncontrollable feeling of dread, digging deep into my chest. 

Impulsively, I looked around. That's when I first saw her. 

A woman. Just standing in the middle of the room. Watching the child sleep. 

This woman had long, mangy black hair. Skin snow white and neck tilted an impossible degree to the side. 

Every time I'd have this dream, I'd always be behind the woman, at just the right angle where her face was shielded from view. Despite this, however, her entire, horrifyingly tall body was still visible. 

Wearing only a raggedy white shirt, length going down past her knees, I noted how bruised and dirty her calves and feet were. 

Then, as my eyes traced her shoulders, I noticed them moving up and down, almost mesmerizing and always constant. I kept following down to her arms, where I made a terrifying realization that made my blood run cold: she was holding something. Within her right hand, with fingers bloody and cracked, fingernails long and shaded dark yellow, was an object. 

A knife. 

In every dream, the woman would inch closer to the child. 

In every dream, the movements would be so slight, so subtle, that each step would fail to make a sound. 

As she'd get closer to the kid, she'd slowly raise the knife above her head. Ready to strike. 

Then just like that, the dream would end. 

And I'd be back in the same spot again, in another child's room. 

That loop continued for months. Every time I fell asleep I'd be transported to the same spot. 

I'd watch the same woman. 

Helplessly, I'd see the sequence unfold: 

The steps. The knife in the air. The sudden cut to the next scene. 

It was as if my mind was protecting me from what I'd witnessed, protecting me from the truth. 

Then, last week, something strange started happening. These "dreams" started transcending my night time sleeps. 

Last week, I started seeing the woman, the scenes, every time my eyes were closed, regardless of the time spent shut. 

It got to the point where every time I blinked, every time I rested my eyes, every time my eyelids shut, no matter the time elapsed, I'd see her again. I'd be stuck watching her cursed, horrific appearance, and the unrelenting loop that would follow. 

I wish that's where the story ended. 

Last night, in my dream, I once again found myself in a room. 

Except this time, something was different. 

I immediately made the connection. 

This wasn't some random kid's room. 

This was my room. 

My more terrifying discovery however, came when I noticed the second abnormality from my usual dream. 

I was in my bed. 

I already knew what I'd see next. 

Apprehensively, I lifted my head, terrified of what I'd see. 

Lo and behold, I saw her. 

The woman from my dreams. 

Except this time, I could see her face. 

Her eyes were darker than anything I'd seen in my life. Blood was trickling down from her forehead, and her nose, seemingly attempted to be torn off, hung on for dear life. 

The woman's most petrifying feature, however, was her smile. The corners of her mouth had been sewn to her cheekbones, stretching her lips and creating an uncanny, inhuman grin that spanned the entire width of her face. 

I hadn't been able to tell from behind, but now that I was facing her, I could unmistakably identify why her shoulders were always moving. 

She was giggling. Not enough to make a discernible sound, just enough to push me over the edge, wishing in that moment I just died instantaneously instead of suffering through whatever would happen next. 

The woman, giggle growing more maniacal as she inched closer, slowly made her way to my bed. 

I was going to die. 

Then, by some miracle, I awoke. 

I was in my bed, in total darkness, except the woman was gone. 

In my dazed state, my eyelids shut for just a second longer than an instantaneous blink. 

In the blink of an eye, the woman was back, knife in the air, arm coming down at terrifying speed. 

Just before it pierced my chest I shot my eyes open once again. 

I sprinted to my desk and ripped out a roll of tape. 

I taped my eyelids open and sat there, praying the woman wouldn't return. 

It's been 30 hours. As my bloodshot eyes get heavier, and the bags under my eyes get more swollen, I don't know how much longer I can resist. 

I've tried caffeine. 

I've tried exercising. 

I can feel my eyelids getting closer together. 

It's only a matter of time.
