I held on tightly to the document in my hand, certain that I was leaving fingerprint-shaped sweat and oil stains on the faked referral. The fluorescent lights overhead, while threatening me with a headache, luckily didn’t highlight the minor details that I obsessed over in my mind.  

The intake worker in front of me scanned my face briefly with a tight-lipped smile as she clicked away on her keyboard, the computer monitor facing away from me.  

“Any other non-psychiatric medications? Just the insulin?” she asked. 

“Just insulin,” I said quickly, noticing a catch in my voice and clearing my throat. 

She nodded rhythmically, never looking away from the monitor.  

“I’ll take you for your phone call if you’re ready?” She said with an inflection that felt forced. 

I followed her down the corridor to the common area. Patients and staff passed in my periphery, but I kept my head down. I was no stranger to depression, but I’d spent weeks researching the chronic, affective disorder I needed to emulate and suppressing my journalist’s instinct for eye contact and polite smiles.  

My brother picked up after the first ring. 

“Hello?” 

“Abe, it’s Clara,” 

“Ah, you’ve arrived. How’s it going so far, Nellie Bly?” 

“I’m not amused. Anyways, I’m just checking in. Don’t forget to let Lenny out or he’ll piss in your shoes again,”  

“Clara,” 

“What? I gotta go and I can’t—” 

“I get what you’re doing. I do, but do you think this is healthy? She’s gone, Clara, and maybe—” 

“Are you finished?” I asked, tapping my nails against the counter in front of me. 

“I just think you need to let yourself grieve,”  

“I’ll grieve when I know what I’m grieving. Let Lenny out,” I whispered and firmly clicked the phone down. 

My room was a paradox of sterility and decay—the stinging scent of disinfectant unable to mask the age-stained walls and the heavy air of a thousand former occupants. I wondered if a building this old could ever truly be clean.  Splitting the room in two was, in my opinion, a child-sized bed with a grey metal frame and a thin mattress dressed in ‘we don’t trust you’ white. 

As I restlessly arranged my belongings, a young nurse with her hair pulled back too tightly moved into the frame of my door, tapping softly with her fingertips.  

“Hi Clara, I’m Wendy. I’ll be your nurse this evening,” she said warmly, her words pulling upwards at the ends.  

Trying to be subtle, I studied her face—contemplating if I’d seen her during my time as a visitor. I smiled briefly and nodded. 

“I’m going to check your blood sugar quick. Insulin if you need it, and your Effexor, okay?” 

“Sure,” I replied, swallowing into a dry throat. 

She pricked my finger, wincing subtly as the lancing device clicked. I watched the tiny bead of blood form on my fingertip, feeling contemptuous. 

Wendy seemed nervous—new, maybe. I decided any resentment or grudge I held toward the hospital would likely be unfairly projected onto her if I didn’t change my attitude. 

“Thank you,” I said quietly.  

“You’re so welcome!” she replied in a sing-song voice, making me instantly regret my shift in tone. Still, I offered her a lukewarm smile.  

She pulled the clear viscous liquid into a syringe I’d never seen before. 

“20 units?” I asked. 

“Yes, newer company. Smaller barrel, but same dose,” she said, smiling with squinted eyes. 

I came to group therapy with a queasy stomach and an anti-depressant lodged uncomfortably behind my second molar—eyeing the decorative box of tissues and biding my time like a predator. Sweat began beading on my forehead, a fluish feeling building in my head. I grabbed a tissue quickly—one stone, several birds.  

From the corner of my eye, I saw a soft, curious gaze... A man around my age with soft brown eyes and cheeks that vaguely reminded me of childhood, tilted his head mischievously.  

“I saw that,” He whispered, smiling gently. 

I froze, embarrassed and worried, but kept my composure.  

He waved off my concern with a lazy gesture. 

“Patient autonomy,” he said and shrugged. 

In the dining hall, I sat quietly with my tray, focused on calming the rising nausea. Nurse Wendy scuffled over, bending down to meet my gaze. 

“Blood sugar check,” she said. 

I turned over a clammy palm and stared queasily at the gritty tabletop.  

“Yikes, still a little high,” she said, “I’ll grab your insulin,” 

After the clumsy injection, sinking into brain fog with my eyes growing heavy, I rested my head on my hand and leaned my elbow on the table. I believed I was likely coming down with something, but I wanted no extra attention from the staff.  

In my haze, I watched Caleb walk over steadily to where I was melting at the table and slide into the seat across from me.  

He smiled sympathetically, tilting his head in the childlike way I’d noticed before.  

He took two fingers to his lips in a gesture that said “smoke?”, and I desperately needed a change of scene.  

Outside, the warm, dry air prickled against my clammy skin like static. 

“Clara,” Caleb said, his words too direct and urgent for someone I barely knew. 

“You’re not well. Have you considered that they might be messing with your meds?” 

“I—No, I’m not—I’m not even taking them,” I whispered, leaning into him. 

“Your insulin,” he said, eyebrows raised. 

“No. No, I watched her pull it,” 

“They’re giving you too much,” he said. 

“Why do you—” 

“Look where you are right now,” he said hastily, his voice distorted. 

I gasped awake on the cold tile floor of my room, a layer of cold sweat covering my skin. My head was swimming, and my vision was blurred, but I just barely made out the figure of Nurse Wendy peering through the glass window on my door before she quickly walked away.
