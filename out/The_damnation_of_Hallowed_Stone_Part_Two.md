Nolan put his hand out. "That's far enough. I told you we're not interested. Now fuck off before I drop you right here and now!" The Black-eyed man halted abruptly again and snapped his head to look at Nolan. His vulpine grin dropped and instantly morphed itself into a scowl before his pointing his fingers in an "evil eye" gesture at him and blasting the most inhuman sort of bellow I'd ever heard. Imagine hearing every creature on the planet, man and animal, screaming at the same time while coming from the mouth of a dragon, that's the best way I can describe the sound the man made.

It all happened instantaneously. I closed my eyes and covered my ears. The Black-eyed man's demon screech continued ringing in my ears, but I still heard Nolan's screams cutting through. Faint, but there, nonetheless. My eyes opened to see that the other two had him pinned to the ground. Nolan wrestled furiously against them, but he might as well have been laying perfectly still for as much good as it did him. I made to rush for him, to help him or... or I don't know, *something*, but whenever I did, I couldn't make my muscles move an inch.

It was like I was somehow frozen by the man's voice. I don't just mean by fear or anything, either, but rather like the guy's voice was somehow hypnotizing my muscles or maybe blocking my mind's connection with my body. Think about a computer being remotely accessed. You see it happening right in front of you, you know it's happening, and you can't do a damn thing to stop it. That's exactly what this was, my mind was a computer being hacked, essentially.

The two hooded figures jabbed a needle into Nolan's neck, putting him to sleep in less than seconds. I kept pushing myself to do something. I didn't care what, but *something*, to just *move*, but it was useless. The whole time this was happening, too, Black-Eyed man stared directly at me, grinning in this shark-like manner, showing off an impossible amount of razor-like teeth on both the top and bottom of his jaws.

As he did this, too, I could hear them, all of them, call out to me, saying, *"Join us in the End, Hank... He's waiting..."* The two figures arose, each taking up one of Nolan's arms in one hand. Still frozen, I watched them begin dragging my friend down the street. The Black-Eyed man held out his arm in a summoning gesture to me again and said, *"Take my hand, child."*

Shaking, I saw my hand start to raise on its own. This time, though, my own mind started to take the wheel again and I forced my arm to go back down. Seeing this, Black-Eyed man's smile dropped again into that scowl from before. My body seized up, expecting him to blast out another sort of gathering call or whatever to sic his two cronies on me like they had with Nolan, but he didn't. He just stood there, glaring a me before smiling again and moving backwards in the direction the other two went, still facing me with his arm still outstretched toward me.

I stood there, watching him disappear into the distance. This time it *was* fright alone that caused me to remain frozen stiff for at least a good ten minutes or so. When I finally managed to break from entropy, the first thing I did was break off into a sprint for the nearest neighbor's house. I remember hammering like a maniac on the door. When the old, haggard looking guy answered the door, I instantly broke into a panic, dumping everything that'd just happened onto him while he stood there, tiredly staring at me like I was fucking crazy.

"Sir, please, you gotta help!" I cried. He didn't say or do anything, just continued eyeing me like nothing I'd told him meant a damn thing to him. I sighed then and just settled for asking if I could just use his phone. He sighed and told me to make it quick. I ran inside, grabbed the phone, and smashed the 9-1-1 buttons.

**-- "911 Operator, what is your emergency?"**

\-- "Hello? M-My friend's j-just been kidnapped by--"

My mind was running a hundred miles a second. I couldn't focus on a damn thing I was supposed to say.

**-- "Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to calm down and speak clearly, okay?"**

I took a deep breath.

\-- "O-Okay..."

**-- "May I have your name and current location?"**

\-- "My name's Hank Resner. I'm in Creekdale Dr. My friend's been abducted in the street."

**-- "Alright Hank. Are you somewhere safe right now?"**

\-- "Y-Yeah, I'm in a neighbor's house closeby."

**-- "And what's this location's address?"**

\-- "Uhh..."

I covered the receiver and turned to the guy. Whispering, I asked him, "Hey, what this address?" He raised his eyebrow at me. I pointed to the phone and he sighed in annoyance. I'm guessing he wasn't a big fan of cops at the house, likely due to the messy, borderline hazardous looking state the inside of the place was in. Regardless, he gave me the address and I relayed it to the operator.

**-- "Alright, I've dispatched a unit to your location. You said you are somewhere safe, correct?"**

\-- "Y-Yes ma'am."

**-- "Good, and is there anyone with you?"**

\-- "Yes ma'am, the owner of the house."

**-- "Alright, the unit should be there in about two minutes. I want you to remain inside until they get there, okay?"**

\-- "Y-Yes ma'am."

I hung up after that. Ironically in a way, I could almost hear the sirens coming while she was actually telling me this. They showed up in the guy's driveway just a minute and a half later. I ran outside to meet them, where I more or less did with them the same as what I did with the guy before by belting everything out that happened in a frenzy. Just like the guy and the operator, both, the officer looked at me confused before telling me to slow down. I couldn't help it. Every second that passed, I knew, was another second that Nolan spent having God only knew what being done to him by those freaks.

"Look, me and Nolan were just walking down the street over there," I pointed to the area of the street where we'd been, "when these three guys in hoods came up to us and attacked him."

"Did you see any of their faces?" he asked. "Any of them remove their hoods or anything, maybe in the struggle?"

"Y-Yeah..." I shuddered. The officer looked attentively at me. "H-He was thin, bald, and had black eyes."

"Black eyes?" he asked.

"Yeah, like *pitch black*. He had sharp looking teeth, too, and--" He stopped me.

"Okay, and where did you say these people went with your friend?" I pointed down the other side of the street. "Down toward the edge of the neighborhood where the cemetery's at?" I nodded, shaking. I thought then of the other bodies that were always found in there. He told me to stay where I was while he went to radio something to the dispatcher. I stood, quivering in raw terror.

I looked in the distance. In the back of my mind -- at least that's what I *hoped* it was -- I could hear, just faintly, *"Come with us, Hank..."*

The officer came back soon after. "Alright, son, here's what's gonna happen. You're gonna take a ride with me to the station where we'll take your statement and have you help give us a composite sketch of the guy, okay?" My eyes grew in alarm. He held up his hand, half-grinning, and remarked, "Calm down, sport, you ain't in any trouble here, we just need your help."

"B-But my M-Mo--"

"We've already contacted them, they'll be waiting for us down at the station." My body calmed down, though my brain and heart were both still kicked well into overdrive.

"Wh-What about Nolan? He's still out there, we have to--" He held up his hand again.

"Again, it's being taken care of. We got a couple K-9 units looking into the place as we speak. If they *did* go there, the dogs'll catch 'em." I shivered for a moment, turning back to the distance. The officer's words were, of course, of little to absolutely no comfort to me. He gestured for me to get in the car and he drove us out of the neighborhood to the station.

Sure enough, he wasn't lying when he told me that my folks would be waiting for me there. Hell, I can still feel how tight Momma squeezed me when she ran up to hug me. "Oh my God, are you okay, Hank?!" she cried frantically.

"Y-Yeah, Momma, I-I'm fine." Admittedly, I knew even then I wasn't fooling anybody, let alone my mother with that bullshit, but I was also less worried about myself in any case. I was there, at the station, for my best chance at saving Nolan, not for me. The officer led us into the interrogation room and we sat down.

"So, start from the beginning. You were with your friend, yes?" I nodded my head. "What happened then?"

"We were just walking down the street and--"

"Where?" I shrugged.

"N-Nowhere. We were just walking when they showed up."

"When who showed up?"

"I-I don't know who they are."

"Okay, and did they say anything to you?" I grimaced. I didn't want to answer this, not because I thought I'd be in trouble, but because I wasn't sure *what* to tell them.

"Come with me..." I said in a hesitant whisper. He leaned in closer.

"Come again?"

"He told me to come with him or something, I don't know..."

"Where?"

"The... The cemetery..." My heart started jumping in my chest now. I felt Momma's arm wrap around me tightly.

"Hallowed Stone?" he asked. I nodded. "He say why?"

"No. I don't know. He kept saying some shit like *"Come join us in the end"*, or something crazy like that." He furrowed his eyes at me for a moment before clearing his throat.

"Okay, so these people show up, tell you to come with them," he paused, looking at me with eyebrows raised, "You don't, and then..."

"He starts coming toward me, telling me to come with him."

"Did you try to run?"

"N-No... I... I wanted to, but..." I trailed off. My stomach began to turn. "Nolan stepped in front of me, telling him to go away when they jumped him. I couldn't help him, either."

"Were any of them armed?"

"They had a... a needle..."

"A needle?" he asked. I nodded.

"Yeah, and they used it to put Nolan to sleep before dragging him away."

"And that's when you ran to the neighbor's house to call us?" I nodded. He nodded, then stood up. "Wait here for a moment, I'll be right back." He then left the room and it was me and my parents.

I turned to Momma. She had tears in her eyes."Momma, I--" she cut me off by bear-hugging me tightly. I could hear her sobbing and Dad joined in, squeezing me even tighter. I said nothing then, just huddled myself close to her like I was four years old, watching a scary movie late at night again. Yeah, Noah, if you're reading this, this's your chance (Probably the last) to laugh at me for the same shit I gave you such a hard time over.

Anyway, we stayed like this for about three minutes before the door opened again and in walked the officer and another holding a sketchbook and pencil. "Okay, bud, now what I want you to do is try to tell us anything you can remember about them; how they were dressed, any marks, like scars or tattoos, anything like that. Think you can do that for me?" I poked my head out from Momma's arms and nodded.

Turning to the artist, I described, in vivd detail, the Black-Eyed man. In about 15 minutes, the artist had a damn near perfect likeness of him, admittedly causing a shiver to sprint down my back. Even just looking at a *drawing* of him caused me to faintly hear his deep, demonic voice again, beckoning me, commanding me, to come to the cemetery. "This him?" asked the artist.

I nodded. "Y-Yeah... Yeah, that's him."

"You sure?" asked the officer. I nodded to him, unable to take my eyes away from the eyes on the drawing. The officer stood up again and nodded to the artist, who also stood up and made for the door. "Alright then, thank you for your help. We'll be in touch, if you see anything, give us a call." he passed a card to Dad and looked at me, "And in the meantime, Might I suggest staying indoors for a while? They might still be after you."

"What do you mean?" Momma chimed in. The officer exchanged glances back and forth between me and her before clearing his throat.

"Well ma'am, it's possible that this little stunt was a ruse to lure your son here to Hallowed Stone." My heart stopped dead for at least the fourth time that day. Somehow, right up to the moment he said that, I hadn't even considered that.

"How do you know?" asked Dad. "I mean, why would they be targeting him?"

"Why, I can't say, but this isn't the first time this particular situation's happened." I saw Momma's eyes double in size along with my own. "You folks remember the incident a while back, Pastor Kincaid's daughter?" They shakily nodded. "Well, little known fact, but she wasn't ever found, and leading up to the incident that night, she'd already reported a few instances of people harassing her." He turned back to me and said, "And from what your son's just told me, it sounds like this is the same people in his case as well, and if that's the case, it's possible he ain't done with you."

He turned and left the room after that. My mind was completely blank. The world felt like I was dreaming, like none of this was real. That suddenly, everything would be normal again, my friend would be home again, safe, and I wouldn't have some crazy cult or whatever the hell they were after me.

The three of us left and went home after that. The car ride was silent. A few times, I caught Dad and Momma both darting their eyes in the side and rear-view mirrors. I probably would've done so myself if my brain wasn't essentially a crashed computer, blank and hollow. Lifeless almost, completely numb to the world around me.

*An empty vessel.*

*"Come join us, Hank..."*

I remember snapping my head around wildly. Looking around, nothing was there, nothing that wasn't supposed to be, if you take my meaning. Momma looked up to the rear-view mirror, "You okay, honey?"

"Um... I, uh..."

*"Join us in the cemetery, Hank..."*

*"Join us in the End..."*

My head snapped to the right. "What is it, you see something?"

"N-No..."

"What's going on?" asked Dad.

"Nothing, I... I thought I heard something."

"Like what?"

"It's nothing, I promi--"

*"Hank, I'm so lonely, come with me..."*

My head snapped to the right. This time it was Nolan's voice crying out to me. “Hank, what’s going on, talk to me, *please!*”

I looked again at Momma. Her eyes were full to the brim with tears. It broke my heart to see her like this.

*”Hank, don’t you love us? Aren’t you lonely without us?”*

This time it was Aunt Rosa’s voice, coming from the right. Two things happened then at the exact same time. I swung my head in the direction of Aunt Rosa’s voice at the exact same time Dad swings the car over to the right of the road. The car came to a screeching halt that sent whiplash through all three of us.

For a moment, we were all stuck in a state of shock, adrenaline running rampant through all three of us, prompting us to want to go into a frenzy, yet being too out of your own damn mind to move a single muscle. Dad was the first to break, looking around at both me and Momma. “Are y’all okay?” Both of us just looked at him, blank and panic-stricken.

Attention was then refocused to the passenger side window, facing the road. Directly in front of us, staring straight through the window, was one of the hooded figures. My eyes doubled in size. *Oh Jesus, he’s RIGHT on top of me!*

Dad blared the horn. “Hey buddy, come on, you can’t have the whole fuckin’ road!” He just remained a statue outside of the window. Dad blared the horn again. Nothing.

Dad started unbuckling his seat belt, grumbling under his breath. Without even thinking, I shot out my arm, “Dad, wait, don’t!” He paused for a moment, raising his eyebrow at me. “He-He’s one of them.”

His eye darted back and forth between me and the window. “He’s one of the guys that took Nolan, Dad.” Both his and Momma’s faces drained of color as they stared back to face the figure in the window. The figure slowly moved, raising its right hand to the window in a gesturing manner.

“Wh-what’s he doing?” Momma asked, shaking. Dad put his hand on her shoulder, not taking his eye off the figure.

“Stay here, don’t move.” He opened the door and stepped out before I could stop him again. Momma quickly clicked the locks on the doors. I blankly watched him stomp over to the passenger side of the car. The figure stayed still, staring through the window, not at all noticing Dad, even when he began shaking their shoulder.

My heart began cutting cartwheels, hearing Aunt Rosa and Nolan’s, as well as a few other people’s voices again. They were even louder, though, clearer, almost *deafening*! All of it seemed to be coming from the hooded guy himself. I slowly shrank down in my seat, as if that would somehow keep me from being seen.

*”You know you have to come, Hank...”*

I squeezed my eyes shut and shook my head. *Stop it, I’m not going, leave me alone!*

*”Alone?”* I hear Nolan’s voice cry out. *“You are alone, Hank.”*

I then hear Aunt Rosa chime in, *”We are together, Hank. We are, all of us, one in The End.”*

I hear voices I didn’t even recognize, all of them children, start calling out to me. *”Come on, Hank!”* I heard them cry. *”Come with us into the End, Hank.”* My head shook violently. I hear them surrounding me, all centering from the window.

*Stop it! Go away!*

The figure had his hand up in the window, curling his fingers in a beckoning motion. *”Take our hand, Hank. Come to the cemetery...”*

My attention was snapped back to reality at the sound of Momma’s shriek of terror. I looked to see her facing the window, watching Dad get the absolute shit stomped out of him by the figure, along with a newcomer who I hadn’t even seen beforehand. Dad was twitching on the ground, coughing up blood. “Dad!” I cried, fumbling frantically with the door handle.

“Wait, Hank, don’t!” But it was too late. I was bounding out from the back seat, hurling myself like a panther into the one repeatedly stomping Dad’s chest in. It did absolutely nothing and, from what I could tell, despite being as rail thin as he looked, the son of a bitch wasn’t even budged an *inch*!

He continued hammering his foot down on my father’s chest while his partner delivered a swift kick straight to his nose that, from the sickening *crack* I heard immediately afterward, snapped his neck. His head lolled like rubber to his left side staring at me with glazed eyes that were forever frozen in a state of shock. “Dad!”

I looked up to see the hooded figures now aim their focus at me. The one directly in front of me extended his hand and once again, I heard, *”He will be delivered unto the end. Join us. Take our hand, child.”*

Now, more so than the last time, I found myself mesmerized by the voice. I couldn’t’t understand why — hell, I couldn’t tell you *now*, decades later — but *something* in it caused me to become completely paralyzed where I stood. *”Come on... you can be with us. All of us.”*

In a mix of all the voices, I heard, *”We are one, in the End!”* I wanted to cover my ears. I wanted to shout, scream, *something*. I couldn’t, and I was stuck, an ejected consciousness, almost, staring through an empty shell that was my body. It almost didn’t at all register to me that my feet were actually moving forward, bringing myself closer and closer to the hooded figure in front of me.

One step, then another, and then another. Time slowed to a complete stop. Nothing my body did was of any will or action of mine. *”Come, Hank.”* I hear Aunt Rosa’s voice say. *”Come with us to Hallowed Stone, to the End.”* My body takes another step forward.

In Nolan’s voice, I hear, *”Come be with us, Hank. Join us in the End.”* I took another step to the figure. My arm unconsciously raises up toward his. I’m about a foot away from him now. I’m about to do it, about to take his hand, when I felt my arm get roughly jerked backward toward the car.

My head snaps over to see Momma. She pulled me close, bear hugging me, covering me with her arms. The figure took another step forward, not lowering his hand. Momma started backing us up toward the car. For some reason, I couldn't make my feet want to cooperate. God knows every OTHER part of me did, but I just *wouldn't move*. Momma jerked me and I was pulled to the car.

She began shoving me into the car. I stiffly watched the figure approaching her from behind. She didn't notice him. I could see him getting closer and closer. I stayed staring into his hooded face, into his extended hand. *"Come with us, Hank..."*

He came about half a foot away from Momma when I finally got my mouth to open and I was gonna cry out to warn her, but it was too late. In seconds, he had Momma by the hair, forcefully jerking her away. I was frozen in the car, numbly watching as the two figures proceeded to stomp her into the road just like they had with Dad.

I could hear her crying out in pain with each blow after blow to her face, stomach, arms, *everywhere*. They were relentless. All of this, and I couldn't do a goddamned thing but watch. I know I keep saying it, but my body wouldn't move, no matter how hard I tried, how much I *desperately* tried, I WOULD NOT MOVE! I *couldn't.*

Unlike my father, these two weren't content with stomping Momma into the ground. No, they sought to use her as their next sacrifice. They rolled her over onto her back before one of them revealed a small blade and cut her shirt open, revealing her bare chest. Momma wasn't moving, except to writhe slightly from left to right. The figure raised the knife high into the air while the other proceeded to position her in a way that had her in the something like the shape of a star.

The one holding the knife was staring right at me. I couldn't see his face, sure, but I could knew he was looking at me. I'm almost willing to bet money he was *grinning* at me behind that hood. I could hear the voices from him, too, all of them, all coming from him.

*"We take thy body, that is thy vessel."* The figure plunged the knife downward, square in the area just above her navel. Momma's body thrusted upward reflexively upon impact, her eyes doubling in size as she began gasping desperately for breath. I watched the figure then start sliding the blade down her stomach in a straight line, pulling it out once reaching just below her chest. *"We take thy spirit, that is thy mortality."*

Momma's eyes locked onto mine. I could see it in her eyes, the beckoning. The silent pleading, begging. I didn't move. The knife came down again, this time just to the right of her left shoulder and was dragged all the way across her chest until connecting with the tip of the previous cut. Blood was now water falling from the front of her and her frantic gasping intensified. Her eyes were bugging, still fixed on me.

*"Help me, Hank..."* I could almost hear her say, among the rest of the voices surrounding my mind that seemed to be keeping my limbs locked in perpetual entropy. *"Save me!"*

*("I can't! I'm sorry, I'm so sorry momma, but I can't move!")*

*"We take thy blood, that is thy life."* declared the figure before finally plunging the knife down for the final time in the other shoulder. This time I could hear Momma let out a pitiful cry of pain, with her body seizing and convulsing upward for a second before relaxing back on the ground again. I saw her eyes flutter, still trying to hold onto life, still pleading to me. I remained perfectly still. Neither my mind nor body reacted to any of this. I could neither think nor move. I was *empty!*

Both of the figures raised up from Momma's bleeding body before raising their hands to the air and proclaiming, *We take thy heart, that is thy purity, to join us all, in The End!"* That last line, I could hear an echo to it, like if it was coming from a crowd of people, all at once. The one then raised the knife again, like he was about to use it on my mother again, when out of nowhere, I hear a deep voice shout, "FREEZE!"

The figures snapped their heads to look to the right of them where the voice came from. This, for some reason, caused my head to turn as well, though I could tell that it was done out a reflex that wasn't exactly my own, if that makes any sense. Basically, it was like my mind was somehow linked with theirs, and so therefore when *their* attention was shifted to it, so was mine. Confusing, believe me, I know, but its ironically the only thing that made sense for me to explain why I wasn't responsive; why I wasn't running away -- both before or now -- and most importantly, why I didn't so much as lift a finger when I was watching my parents get brutalized right in fucking front of me.

The voice shouted again, "Drop the weapon and get on the ground, arms and legs spread. NOW!" Neither of them moved. "I'm not gonna ask again, drop the weapon and--"

Quicker than I could blink, the one holding the knife hurled it in the direction of the officer, nailing him in his shoulder. Instantly, the officer reeled in pain, but not before firing two reflex shots which, sure as hell, actually managed to hit one of the figures in the chest. He was knocked to the ground and his body immediately went lifeless. When this happened, for at least a good five seconds, I could hear over a thousand collective deafening screams fill my head. It was like when the bullets hit the figure, they'd also hit by extension every living thing on Earth. They were maddening, excruciating, and they were *everywhere*!

The other one, the one with the knife, took off at break-neck speed down the road, back toward Hallowed Stone. The officer began radioing for back up while shouting at his partner in the cruiser to head off the other one. I stared blankly at my mother's body. That's when I could actually stop around me. No voices, no pleading, no hypnosis, nothing.

I was completely numb, hollow, lifeless almost, just like she was now. As maddening as the voices were, as psychotic as they were, driving me more and more to a veritable state of complete mental prolapse, it felt *wrong* somehow to be without them. I couldn't understand it, both because of the fact that the lights were busted upstairs, you could say, as well as the fact that there was no connection, it seemed like, between brain and body in that moment.

It had just as much a physical effect on me as well as mental. By this, I mean that I couldn't actually *feel* anything that I touched or that touched me -- like, for instance, when the officer was shaking me, asking me if I was alright. I could *see* him, could *hear* him (even if just barely), so I knew he was there, but I couldn't actually *feel* his hand on my shoulder. His voice, too, sounded like he was talking to me after having stuffed balls of cotton in my ears. All of this, and it was like my brain could register it, but couldn't respond to it. At all.

I watched the officer turn the body of the hooded figure he'd shot over on his back where I got the first look at the truth. Behind the hood, was Nolan. His eyes were still wide open, but were now as black as the man's were when he was abducted. His teeth were likewise just as sharp, jagged and needle-like. This all horrifies me now, almost 15 years later, far more than it did then. Of course, at least for now, it's because I actually *have* the capacity to feel disgust and dread like that.
