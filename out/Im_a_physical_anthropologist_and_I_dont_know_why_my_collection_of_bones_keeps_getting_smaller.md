I work as a physical anthropologist at a pretty well known university, together with a team of PhD students.

It was about 3 months ago that the first bones started to "get lost", if I recall correctly. 

I was working with one of my students, Paul, sorting my collection of bones. We had to move office to a smaller space, because well, with all the new technologies being developed the need for hands-on skeletal- and anatomy research sadly is decreasing rapidly.

The new office was small, and located in one of the far-away buildings on campus grounds. The building was very old, and apart from us, no one was using it except for storage of the history department.

We were working on the final crate of the day, ticking off every piece of inventory on our lists, when Paul asked me: 

"Sir, do you know if the gorilla skull with label 155 is maybe in another crate? It's supposed to be here but I can't seem to find it".

I came over and looked at the plastic crate, which was empty with its previous contents neatly layed out in groups besides it. I noticed that indeed there was no gorilla skull. 

"Ah well, I must have put it in another crate. We'll see if we can find it tomorrow when we process the last few boxes." 

After this we went home, and due to a sudden flu that struck Paul we could only finish the boxes a week later. We completely forgot about the missing skull, and other than that nothing else was missing.

Gradually over the next few weeks small things started being lost. A couple of the ribs were suddenly not in their drawer anymore. Six lumbar vertebrae that, according to the inventory, should have been there. An entire box of human incisor teeth that were gone. 

I thought that maybe one of my students was trying to play an elaborate joke, or maybe they needed them for their own side-project research. All of them denied both of these allegations, though.

Until a couple of weeks later one of my favorite bones disappeared. I have a large human femur bone on a kind of stand in my office (I'm a very grotesque-weird nerd, I know). Apart from the obvious bone collection, I also collect various other medical specimens, which also reside in the storage room.

One day I was late at night grading a paper and out of habit gazed up at the bookshelf across my desk. There was the stand, but the bone that used to rest upon it was gone.

"Okay guys, it's really not funny anymore. I get that you may have your own research projects, but you do not steal from my personal belongings. We have enough femurs in storage to use, but please just freaking ask first. This is not okay. I want it back by tomorrow!" I typed in our groupchat. Once again everyone either said they had nothing to do with it, or tactically kept their mouths shut. It was late after all, and no one else was in the office.

Still pissed because of the missing femur I walked towards our storage room to see if I could find a suitable replacement for the time being. When entering I felt a weird chill, but I brushed it off as it being late at night in a cold storage room surrounded by bones.

Suddenly my heart stopped as I saw what could only be described as a gruesome scene. My collection of medical specimens were toppled over, their preservation fluids spilled all over the floor. Various organs lay scattered on the floor, the pungent smell hitting me in the face.

On closer inspection, I noticed there was something wrong with the organs. They were incomplete. It looked like something took a bite out of the lungs and the heart, the walls of the organs torn to shreds.

Almost immediately I heard something scuffle on the other side of the storage room. I kept as silent as I could and then I heard the most chilling sound:

A crunching snap. The breaking of bones. Gnawing.

Trying to see where the sound came from I peered past one of the shelves. What I saw made my heart drop.

A tall, slender grey figure was standing over a box that contained five Native American skulls. The humanoid creature reached into the box and pulled out a skull, while it made some sort of horrible static humming sound. It then made the same sound as before.

A crunching snap. The breaking of bones. Gnawing.

The creature, almost instantaneously, bit straight through the cranium of the skull. It cracked like a wallnut.

Finally, I partially overcame my dread and I made a run for the door of the storage.
I heard the creature reacting as it's long arms accidentally knocked over one of the shelves.

I could hear its footsteps right behind me as I opened the door and sprinted down the stairs to my car.

In a panic I started my engine and watched how the creature stood in the doorframe of the building. It was standing completely still and it's white eyes were peering straight into my soul. It was the most unnerving sight I have ever seen.

While driving through the forest that encompasses the campus I swear I saw it stand behind trees in my rear view mirror. I think it is stalking me. I don't know what it-

I just pulled over on the side of a road to write this memoir in case anything happens. I have no idea where I am going but I feel like I can't stop for longer before it finds me again. Please help me, I have no idea what this is or what I should do...
