“Do you enjoy knitting, Mr. Pendle?” 

I looked up in surprise from where I was seated across from Dr. Vitus, sheepishly smiling as I unspooled and respooled the small loop of thread in my hands. It was ruby-red, the wood underneath a fine cedar.

“Always have,” I admitted, a bashful smile on my face. My gaze darted between Rowan, the thread, and Rowan again. I’d always had a weakness for pretty faces, and Dr. Rowan Vitus was one of the prettiest I’d ever seen. “And please, call me Lucius.”

*Please call me Lucius so I can hear my name on your tongue.*

Rowan grinned. It was affable, and I felt a sort of thrill at the thought that I’d been the one to make him smile like that. His dimples were more prominent under the clinic’s fluorescent lighting, making his dark skin seem almost glowing. 

“Of course, *Lucius,”* he said, and I gulped, crossing my legs underneath the desk, frantic in rolling the spool of thread within my hands. It was the accent. That *stupid, insipid,* awful British accent that I wished to record and fall asleep to every night, whispering soft nothings into the ears of my phone’s voice-recorder.

“And you can call me Rowan in return. I find that dispensing with formality often leads to a more open atmosphere. I trust I will be seeing you often over the next few weeks?” he said, leaning towards me.

His eyes were a dark shade of brown, like chocolate. I had the distinct desire to reach into his sockets and yank them out to eat.

I *really* needed to calm down.

“R-Right,” I stammered, pulling back so he couldn’t hear the thumping of my heart. In my hands, the spool of thread was almost completely unrolled, a pile of crimson in my lap. I turned the wooden spool back and forth. It was a nervous habit; one I’d had since I was a child.

“N-New house and all, probably has all sorts of diseases, being as old as it is- “

“I have the lab reports you requested, Dr. Vitus.”

I jumped in my seat, spinning around to find Kieran in the doorway. He was a scrawny man, short, with a head of messy black hair. I hadn’t even heard him come in, and even now I had to strain to hear the soft cadence of his voice. He walked closer, his steps soundless on the clinic’s tiled flooring.

“Splendid!” Rowan beamed, standing up to take the report away from his assistant. Kieran passed him a clipboard, his expression monotone as it had been when I’d walked in here for the first time, just a few hours ago. Did he ever smile? I wondered.

Maybe. At funerals. For baby puppies.

“You have a remarkable genetic history, Lucius,” Rowan declared, a surprised expression on his face as he looked up from the clipboard. He dwarfed me and Kieran easily, a colossus amongst men. “I hardly see why you’d want a doctor at all.”

“Anything can happen,” I shrugged. Rowan nodded; his smile ever-present.

“Well, nothing you need to worry about right now,” he said, placing the report on his desk. “This has to be the cleanest bill of health I’ve ever seen this side of the globe.” I shrugged again, feeling self-conscious.

“I grew up with the best doctors and nutrition that money could buy, *Rowan.*”

I was bragging a bit. *I can be a provider, you idiot. Notice that I want to lick you all over.*

Alas, dreams do not come true. Rowan and I chatted a bit more, we shook hands (I vowed to never wash them again), and I walked out, narrowly dodging Kieran’s sullen frame. It was only when I turned to look one more time that I noticed he was smiling.

I hurried away moments later.

 

 

Later that night, I got a package delivered to my front doorstep. A box of thread and a pair of knitting needles, exquisitely crafted. I swivelled my head back and forth, hoping to catch a head of curly black hair somewhere around the aged townhouse. My smile faded when I realized there wasn’t any, but I wasn’t stupid. I knew who’d sent it to me.

I *had* to pay him back somehow. Not wasting a second, I headed inside the mansion. It was a large one, dating back to the 1900s and pretty far from the rest of town. Cost me an arm and a leg, but after Mom and Dad died, everything else just had too many memories.

I’d have to hire servants soon, I reflected, walking through the seemingly endless hallways. There was a Groundskeeper, which was why the gardens and lawn weren’t overgrown and the gates were still well-oiled, but I’d need more if I wanted to live here by myself. I’d always liked the solitude. The peace and quiet that came with it.

 It wasn’t that I couldn’t handle social situations; I just didn’t like them.

*Rowan* being a rare exception, of course.

I took a sharp left and headed into the knitting room, wanting to put my new toys to use. It was a room I’d designated specifically for any sort of fabric-work, with fancy machines, all sorts of colours and fabrics and threads, and potted plants lining each of the three windows, basking in the sunlight. The walls were painted pink, blue and purple. I took a seat by the old rocking chair, excitedly wondering over what I should make.

Blankets were cliché.

A heart?

Ehhh, maybe for Valentine’s Day.

Scarves? Everyone likes scarves, right? A scarf it was!

 When I opened the box a second time, I noticed something odd. All the threads were different shades of red and pink, save for a roll of white in the centre. I blinked, before shrugging it off. He was a doctor. If I had to guess, this was some weird niche thing he’d brought. Flesh-themed threads *were* pretty on brand for a ‘Dr. *Vitus’*.

The needles were ordinary, at least. Metal, gleaming underneath the warm golden lights of the chandeliers. The somewhat odd thing about them was the grooves. Bizarre, spiralling indentations that looped around the needle, growing closer and closer together until the tip of it. For grip, maybe?

I couldn’t be sure. Still, they were needles, I had the thread, now I just needed to knit something.

It’s funny. I can barely remember it now. Knitting’s always been a solitary companion to me, something to suck me out of the world and into a peaceful, quiet pocket of space and time. Every movement is something I give my full attention to. Memorize, and execute flawlessly.

I barely remember knitting that scarf. I barely remember what I was doing that night. All I know is that in the morning, when the sun began to shine into my face, I jolted awake. The rocking chair creaked ominously when I did so, breathing heavily, forehead covered in a thin sheen of sweat.

I let out a slight gasp as I looked down, mouth falling open at the sight of the most beautiful work I’d ever done. In my hands was a long, wide strip of silk-like fabric. It seemed to undulate over my lap, crimson threads roiling back and forth like waves of blood. There were lines of white and patterns of pink, all in spirals.

It snatched my breath away.

I got up and stumbled, eyes wide as I tried to steady myself on the closest window ledge. My hands slammed into a sunflower pot and it *crashed* to the ground, dirt spilling out of the shattered terracotta. The scarf fell to the floor, pooling over my left foot. I crouched down to pick it up.

My big toe was gone.

In its place was a mound of crimson *thread.* I stared at it, in shock. In horror. In disbelief. Almost experimentally, I tried to wriggle it. I couldn’t. I crouched lower, careful to balance myself on the balls of my feet, and tugged ever-so-slightly at the wet, grisly fibres. 

It came away like an avalanche, unrolling all around the floor. I screamed, trying to get it to stop but it just *wouldn’t.* By the time it was over, my floor was covered in the stuff. Splinters of bone had been caught in the mix, and now they were scattered all over the room. 

The copper stench of blood filled the air, and the wet strands *squelched* when I stepped on them.

There was only a stump left. A goddamn purple *stump* where my toe had been. I ran to the nearest bathroom and emptied my guts into the toilet. Chunks of dinner from last night spilled from my mouth, the scent of vomit making me puke all over again. I clutched at my stomach, moaning in pain as the rancid smell made my eyes water.

I staggered towards the sink, washing my mouth out, staring at my face in the mirror. There were bags underneath my reddened eyes. I clutched the porcelain harder, panting heavily. I chanced a look down, hoping this was all a bad dream. It wasn’t. The stump was still there, purple with lines of infected blue in intersecting spirals.

And it was spreading. My other toes were all black and purple.

“Rowan,” I breathed, because I *knew* this was his fucking fault. It had to be.

I needed to talk to him.

 

 

Have you ever tried walking without toes? It’s not a pleasant feeling. By the time I reached the clinic, pulling up towards that ugly, sterilized building with “The Vitus Clinic” emblazoned over it in big, stupid, bold lettering, I couldn’t wiggle most of my toes. Balancing on the heels of my feet, I ran into the clinic.

“Rowan!” I screamed. It was too early in the day for patients. I got no response. Kieran wasn’t there. Rowan wasn’t there. *Nobody* was there and *nobody* was making a goddamn sound. “Rowan!”

I stormed past the reception, searching wild-eyed for any sign of him. The doors were gone. All of them. The door to Rowan’s room, the door to surgery, the goddamn *bathroom,* all of it! I turned around, but the reception was gone. In its place was just a white, sterile wall. I turned back and saw nothing but spirals. Endless beige walls, twisted and contorted into a spiral nightmare.

“Show yourself, you bastard!”

I screamed again, and I saw him! His stupid handsome face, that stupid goddamn height. He looked alarmed when he saw me, features blanching in pure, unadulterated terror. He turned to run. *Oh, he wasn’t getting away that easy.* “Get back here!”

I roared, lunging at him. I shouldn’t have made the distance, but space and time didn’t seem to apply, wherever I thought I was. He raised his fist. I was faster, slamming my fist into his lip. Again and again, pummelling him to a bloody pulp, spittle flying out of my mouth. I yelled out curses and demanded to know what was happening to me.

“Get off my son, you *psycho!”*

Someone yanked me off and I turned around to punch her too. Her face was twisted in horror, her eyes wide and mouth growing slack. Behind her, I heard a high-pitched wail. I froze mid-punch, heart pounding, frozen in fear. I turned around. I wasn’t in the clinic anymore.

I was in the middle of an empty street. Beneath me, a *five-year-old boy* snivelled, his face covered in blood. His blood. He opened his mouth, trying to say something, but he couldn’t. There was too much blood, just gushing out of his mouth. Pieces of teeth all around him.

*Oh my god.*

No, no, no, no, no-

“Get away from him!” The woman screamed, shoving me to the ground. I tried to steady myself but my left hand was gone and I shrieked as the stump hit the asphalt. Viscous, white pus began to trickle out of it. Like cake frosting. Disgusting, bleached, foul-smelling cake frosting.

I ran.

The streets began to rise and fall. Like something alive. Something *breathing.* Suddenly, I was back in the clinic. Then I was in the street. I let out a whimper of pain as the stump on my hand continued bleeding out that noxious pus. Street. Clinic. A dark cavernous place where the ground was just pink, *squelching* wet flesh. My left leg unspooled and I tumbled to the floor, scratching my elbows on an empty road somewhere I’d never been before. 

 

I’m on the side now. No car’s gone by. My lips and ears unspooled a few moments ago. I don’t even want to know what that looks like. My eyes are going to be next. There's redness is the periphery of my vision, and black lines no matter where I turn. Like I’m looking into the world with broken contact lenses. I tried to touch them and I swear they feel like jelly.

I don’t deserve this.

I don’t want to die here. Alone. Insane.

As I’m typing this my vision is turning red. I wipe my eyes and they come away with blood dripping from my fingertips. The threads are all around me, strips of bone, flesh, and soft, white tissue.

 

 

I always wondered how much thread it would take to stitch together a human body.

I suppose now I’ll find [out](https://www.reddit.com/r/The13thWorld/).
