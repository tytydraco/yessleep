It was 11:45 PM. My phone started to ring, jolting me awake. I groggily reached for it and saw Victor’s name flashing on the screen. Annoyed that he was calling me at this hour, I answered the phone, irritation evident in my voice.

“Do you realize what time it is?” I snapped.

“Oh right, sorry,” Victor replied, sounding unapologetic. “Anyways, do you have a few minutes to spare?”

“Seeing as I’m up now, yes,” I grumbled. “You better make this worth my time.”

“Alright, I’ll make this quick,” Victor said, his tone surprisingly upbeat. “While exploring today, I found a cave not far from the city. I’ve never seen it before. It’s not on the national caves map, so it’s very new. I was in this area a month ago and it wasn’t there. I think it may have opened up after the 5.7 magnitude earthquake last week.”

“Go on,” I said, sitting up in bed, my curiosity piqued.

“Well, I didn’t go in yet, not with work and all,” Victor continued. “But I figured we could explore it tomorrow, since it’s the start of the long weekend. How does that sound?”

“I don’t know,” I replied, concerned about the risks of exploring an unknown cave. “How do we know the cave is safe to explore?”

“That’s the beauty of it. We don’t,” Victor said with a hint of excitement. “Besides, you and I have been bored out of our minds. We don’t have the money to travel abroad, and we’ve explored every park and cave here multiple times over the past five years. Buddy, I think we need to try something new.”

I remained silent, weighing the risks and the thrill of a new adventure.

“Come on, buddy. We’ll be so prepared for everything. We won’t be in any danger whatsoever,” Victor said, trying to convince me.

“Yeah, right,” I said jokingly, but I knew he was really good at overpreparing for anything. I mean, he did get me out of that mess last year when I got stuck in that narrow cave passage.

Victor’s enthusiasm was infectious, and despite my initial hesitation, I felt a growing sense of excitement. “Alright, let’s do it,” I finally said. “But we need to make sure we have all the necessary gear and safety measures in place.”

“Absolutely,” Victor agreed. “I’ll take care of everything. Meet me at my place at 8 AM sharp tomorrow.”

“Fine. See you then,” I replied, hanging up the phone. As I lay back down, I couldn’t help but feel a mix of anticipation and apprehension. Tomorrow’s adventure could be the thrill we’d been seeking, but only if we were careful. Especially since no park official had inspected the cave yet.

It was 10:20 AM on a Saturday. After leaving Victor’s place and parking in the middle of nowhere, we found the cave in no time. Victor was really good at taking notes. If we hadn’t found it, I would have yelled at him.

We saw the opening on the ground. Indeed, it looked like it was created by the earthquake. Trees, still green, had been knocked into the cave, and the ground looked freshly disturbed. I was worried that we might fall to our deaths while climbing down this hole.

Unsurprisingly, Victor was well prepared. Due to his extensive geological knowledge, he was able to find a safe spot to climb down. There appeared to be a part of the opening that was next to solid rock. A sturdy tree near that area could also be used to tie the rope and use it to climb down.

Victor secured the rope around the tree, double-checking the knots to ensure they were tight and secure. He handed me a harness and helped me put it on, making sure it fit snugly.

“Ready?” he asked, his eyes gleaming with excitement.

I nodded, trying to suppress the nervous flutter in my stomach. Victor went first, testing the rope’s strength as he slowly descended into the darkness. I watched as he disappeared below the surface, his headlamp illuminating parts of the cave walls.

“Your turn!” Victor’s voice echoed from below, sounding distant and hollow.

I took a deep breath and gripped the rope tightly, my knuckles turning white. Slowly, I lowered myself into the cave, feeling the cool air envelop me. Despite my experience in climbing, the descent was nerve-wracking, each movement calculated and cautious. The rope creaked under my weight, and the harness dug into my sides. A mix of excitement and nervousness churned in my stomach—thrilled by the prospect of exploring an uncharted cave, yet uncertain about what lay ahead. I focused on Victor’s reassuring voice guiding me from below, his words a steady anchor in the midst of my apprehension.

As I descended further, the cave’s beauty began to reveal itself. Sharp crystalline formations glistened in the dim light, creating a surreal and otherworldly atmosphere. Jagged stalactites hung from the ceiling like ancient teeth, and dark, murky underground streams flowed silently beneath us. The air was thick with the scent of damp earth and minerals.

Finally, my feet touched solid ground, and I breathed a sigh of relief. Victor was already exploring the cave, his headlamp illuminating ancient drawings on the walls. The images depicted gruesome scenes of sacrifice and torment, sending a shiver down my spine.

“Look at this,” Victor said, pointing to the drawings. “These must be thousands of years old.”

I nodded, feeling a sense of unease. Sure, these drawings were made ages ago but imagining that people could do this to other people was just too gruesome for me. Looking around, I saw two human skeletons near the wall. Their chest cavities appeared to be damaged in such a way that it looked like a knife had ripped them open. Based on one of the crude drawings of a man holding another man’s heart, I could only imagine that these two suffered that horrific fate. I felt a little nauseous thinking about it.

While I was pondering this scene, I noticed that Victor had gone ahead and was exploring further down the cave system. He called my name, and I followed his voice through a labyrinth of narrow passages and expansive chambers. The walls were covered in shimmering mineral deposits that reflected off our headlamp beams like stars in the night sky. Stalactites hung from the ceiling, dripping water that echoed through the cavern, while stalagmites rose from the ground like ancient sentinels.

Victor had found another drawing, though this time, it was quite confusing. We both saw a crude depiction of a man holding a sword—a warrior, perhaps. He appeared to be dragging a corpse towards a circle. There was an opening in the circle, and straight lines were drawn all around it, making me think of a bright object like the sun.

“I wonder what that means,” Victor said, pondering the unusual drawing.

I looked around, searching for any artifacts that might provide insight. To my surprise, I found something metallic on the floor. It was circular and somewhat shiny. After fiddling with it, it opened, revealing itself to be a pocket watch.

“What is that?” Victor inquired, noticing that I was holding something in my hand.

“A pocket watch,” I said. “That’s strange. If this cave is very old, then this thing shouldn’t exist.”

I saw a portrait inside the watch. It was a black-and-white photo of a beautiful woman with curly hair. The date at the bottom said June 12, 1906.

“Damn,” Victor exclaimed. “I thought we were the first ones here.”

“I guess not,” I remarked. “But I’m sure the park officials would be interested in your finding.”

As I turned to face Victor, I saw that he had ignored me and was further exploring down the cave system. He seemed fixated on something. Following him, we entered a large chamber. The walls of the chamber were covered in reflective minerals, creating an almost blinding light that seemed to emanate from nowhere. The light was so intense that it felt like the sun was illuminating the chamber, yet there was no visible opening where sunlight could penetrate.

Victor stood in awe, his eyes wide with wonder. “This is incredible,” he whispered.

I nodded, equally mesmerized by the surreal beauty of the chamber. Although I was somewhat unnerved by the unexplained phenomenon that illuminated this chamber. Maybe when we continued our exploration, we would find the source.

The chamber was relatively empty, with only a few stalactites hanging from the ceiling and stalagmites rising from the ground near the walls. The floor was smooth and devoid of debris.

While Victor explored the center of the chamber, taking photographs and jotting notes, I continued to explore its walls. As I moved closer to the far end of the chamber, I stumbled upon a pathway that was somewhat hidden by several large stalagmites. The pathway was narrow and winding, leading deeper into the cave system.

Curiosity got the better of me, and I decided to follow the pathway. The air grew colder and the light from the chamber faded, replaced by the dim glow of my headlamp. The walls of the passage were rough and uneven, and the sound of dripping water echoed through the narrow corridor.

As I ventured further, I felt a growing sense of unease. The passage seemed to stretch on endlessly, with branches leading off into other dark, narrow tunnels. Each step forward felt like a step deeper into an abyss. The light from my headlamp barely penetrated the darkness. The air grew thicker, and the silence was punctuated only by the sound of my own breathing and the occasional drip of water.

I glanced back, but the entrance to the chamber was no longer visible. A sense of disorientation set in, and I realized that I could easily get lost in this labyrinthine cave system. The passages seemed to twist and turn, leading me further away from the safety of the main chamber. My heart pounded in my chest, and I gripped my pickaxe tighter—the cold metal a small comfort in the oppressive darkness.

Turning a corner, I came face to face with something I had never seen before. I froze. Sitting on the ground in a meditative pose was a figure. It was a grotesque blend of human and something unnatural. Its skin had a metallic sheen, reflecting the dim light of my headlamp. Tendrils of white light wove through its flesh, creating a mesmerizing and eerie effect.

The figure's eyes were closed, but they glowed faintly, casting an unsettling light on its face. Its muscles were unnaturally defined, and its presence exuded a sense of power and menace. The being's attire was a mix of ancient armor and something otherworldly. The armor consisted of a bronze helmet adorned with intricate designs, a leather cuirass reinforced with metal plates, and arm guards decorated with swirling patterns. However, strange patterns of lines and circles were etched into the metal, glowing with a faint white light.

I stood there, paralyzed by fear and awe, unable to tear my eyes away from it. The cave around me seemed to fade into the background, and all I could focus on was the figure before me. The sense of unease grew stronger, and I realized that I was in the presence of something far beyond my understanding.

Then, its eyelids appeared to open slowly. Yet, I saw no eyes, but rather bright light emanating from them, as if they were replaced by flashlights. Its expression changed from a calm demeanor to something far more aggressive. I saw it grab something off the floor—a sword or something that appeared to illuminate brightly as it grasped it tightly.

I ran before it could stand up, my heart racing and my breath coming in short, panicked gasps. The narrow passages twisted and turned, and I quickly lost my sense of direction. The darkness seemed to close in around me, and the light from my headlamp barely penetrated the oppressive gloom. My screams echoed through the cave, a desperate cry for help that seemed to go unanswered.

I stumbled through the labyrinth, my footsteps echoing off the walls. Each turn led me deeper into the cave, and a strong feeling of doom kicked in as I realized that I was hopelessly lost. The passages branched off into other tunnels, each darker than the last.

Suddenly, I found myself at a dead-end, the walls closing in around me. Panic set in, and I frantically searched for a way out but found nothing. My hands shook as I pulled the flare gun from my backpack, hoping for the best. The sound of footsteps grew louder, and I knew that the figure was closing in on me.

I could now faintly see the figure. With trembling hands, I aimed the flare gun and fired, the bright light illuminating the darkness for a brief moment. The figure dodged, and I quickly reloaded. I fired again, missing once more. My heart pounded in my chest, and I felt a surge of desperation. Just as the figure was about to reach me, Victor appeared behind it, following the screams and the lights.

Victor fired his flare gun, striking the figure. It stumbled to the ground, dropping its weapon in the process. Seizing the opportunity, I mustered up my courage and struck it in the head with my pickaxe. The blow landed true, penetrating the skull with a bone-cracking sound that echoed through the passages. The figure collapsed, but its death triggered a violent electrical discharge.

The discharge felt like thousands of bugs crawling over me, biting me along the way. Pain exploded in every nerve, and I screamed in agony as the electricity seared my flesh and muscles. My vision blurred, and I felt my heart falter under the intense shock. The pain was unbearable—a burning sensation that felt both fatal and endless. My body convulsed uncontrollably, and I collapsed to the ground—barely conscious. The last thing I saw before losing consciousness was Victor's horrified face as he rushed to my side.

I woke up, finding myself on Victor's back. I could hear him sniffle. I would have teased him about it if not for the dull, burning sensation overwhelming every part of my body. He seemed to have stopped in the lit chamber and carefully laid me on my side near the wall.

Tearfully smiling, he saw that I was awake. “Hey bud. How’s it hanging?”

“Could be better,” I chuckled weakly.

“I can help with that. I have first aid and painkillers in my backpack. I’ll go fetch them for you,” Victor replied, quickly rummaging through his backpack for anything that would help me.

I could hear him muttering to himself. He kept blaming himself for bringing me here and saying that he would never forgive himself if I  die. I wanted to comfort him and tell him that everything would be okay, but I was too weak to say anything.

Suddenly, I felt a throbbing pain in my head. Not quite a migraine or headache that I would normally experience. Maybe this was a warning sign. Maybe I was dying. I looked back at Victor and noticed that he had stopped rummaging through his backpack. He seemed to be in pain too, holding his head.

Then, somehow, I saw visions. Visions of a man—a warrior wearing ancient armor—entering a cave. He seemed gravely wounded, bleeding to death. He went into this chamber where we were now. Then he followed the passages where I met that monstrous creature into a passage that was overly bright. I saw him enter that passage, disappearing into the light. Then he exited it, seemingly healed from his wounds.

After being healed from his wounds, I saw the warrior in my visions living through countless ages. Going from ancient to medieval, to industrial, then to the modern age. His physical appearance changed into the monster we fought earlier. I saw in the visions that he was praying to something, though I could not see it. He held in his hand a bloodied human heart. Suddenly, it started to pump on its own.

The visions stopped, and so did my headache. I saw Victor suddenly turn towards me.

“Whoa. I experienced something strange. Maybe I was hallucinating,” Victor said in a puzzled voice. “I thought I saw a wounded man earlier, enter the cave, and heal his wounds.”

“I… I saw that too,” I said weakly in a shocked tone. “What does that mean?”

“I don’t know. Maybe it’s real. I mean, if that thing we fought was once an injured warrior, then he somehow found a way to heal himself.” Victor paused for a moment, contemplating its implications. “Maybe—”

“Stop right there,” I interrupted him. “I don’t want to go that route. Don’t do that to me. Let me die in peace if that is my fate.”

Victor remained silent. He handed me some pills and said, “This should help with the pain. You will feel drowsy though; they are quite strong.”

I took them. In an hour or so, I felt sleepy and the pain seemed to disappear. I saw Victor walk around the chamber but not leave it, seemingly trying to get a signal on his phone.

Suddenly, I felt weak, every single fiber of my being numb. I was losing control of my body. Before I fell asleep, I said to him, “It’s okay to leave. Just make sure you don’t forget about me.”

I saw him rushing towards me, more tears falling down his cheeks as I uncontrollably fell into darkness.

I admitted that that was the most peaceful slumber I ever had. Memories came flooding back to me. Memories of rock climbing and hiking. Memories of celebrating New Year’s Eve with friends and family. Even memories of meeting Victor for the first time when I was but a mere 8-year-old child. Then, I was in an empty room that seemed to be made of bright light.

It felt soothing, relaxing, peaceful. Then, I felt that something was watching me. But it wasn’t a dreadful feeling. It felt neutral, non-threatening. I turned around and saw nothing. However, it felt like it was right in front of me.

Then I saw beams of light brighter than the room itself shine on my body. It felt like I was being massaged everywhere. More than that, it felt like I was being treated, but I inspected my body and saw no wounds.

The room suddenly became pitch black, as if someone had turned off the lights. I felt a hand touch my right shoulder. I turned around but couldn’t see anything. Something touched my right shoulder again, and I turned around again to meet it.

Suddenly, I found myself laying on the floor in the passages where I first met the monster. Looking around, I saw that I was in front of a cave entrance that emitted extremely bright light. It was too painful to look. As I turned around to shield my eyes from it, I saw Victor lying beside me, seemingly unconscious.

I laid my hand on him, shaking him, trying to wake him up, but he did not stir. I laid my head on his chest and heard faint signs of a heartbeat. He was still alive.

As I stood up, preparing to carry Victor, I noticed that I didn’t feel any pain in my body. I seemed to be fully healed. Realizing that Victor went against my wishes, I cursed under my breath. I carried him slowly out of the passages, all the while cursing at him. When I arrived at the entrance that we came from, I saw first responders at the entrance. Victor’s signal must have gone through.

I hailed them and told them that Victor needed help. They quickly responded by getting Victor out of the cave and taking us to the hospital.

We were both in the same room, with me sitting next to Victor, who was on the bed near the wall. He still lay unconscious.

As the day drew to an end, I could see patients and medical staff walking in the hallways. However, they appeared darker than usual, despite the bright sterile light. There seemed to be shadows, not of themselves, following them. The older the person was, the more dreadful and closer the shadows were. These things were not humanoid in shape; they twisted and writhed in confusing, grotesque forms.

Some of them even stopped and looked at me before continuing to stalk their prey. Their gazes unsettled me. Sometimes they revealed sharp teeth in the center of their bodies, trying to elicit a reaction from me. Most of the time, it worked.

I walked to the window to see the beautiful morning and to turn myself away from these shadow beings, only to find a purely black, cloudless sky with the sun still high and bright. I thought I saw the trees in the distance smile at me, unsettling me further.

I turned around, trying to shake off these visions, only to find a shadow being right in front of me. It twisted its body around, inspecting me. It seemed to laugh and growl simultaneously. I stepped back from it. It came closer. As I was blocked by the wall, the shadow being stopped a foot in front of me, floating two feet above the ground. Its form was amorphous, constantly shifting and changing, with tendrils of darkness reaching out like grasping hands. Then, it formed an appendage, seeming to point somewhere in the trees—in the direction of the cave we came from.

“No!” I screamed at it, “No! I belong here! Not there!”

It laughed at me, a chilling sound that reverberated through the room. Suddenly, I saw a mouth forming at its center, jagged and grotesque, filled with sharp, needle-like teeth. The mouth opened wide, and before I could react, it lunged forward and bit my right arm. Sharp pain coursed through my arm, feeling like a thousand needles piercing my flesh. I screamed in agony, the sound echoing off the sterile walls, as I fell to the ground.

I called for help, my voice desperate and panicked, but no medical staff came to my aid. It was as if they couldn’t hear me, my cries lost in the void. The shadow being loomed over me, its form shifting and writhing as if mocking me. I struggled to stand up, my arm throbbing with pain with no visible wound, and managed to regain my composure while avoiding its gaze.

Then, I heard Victor shuffling in his bed. He was awake. The shadow entity disappeared all of a sudden. Victor looked at me cheerfully. Then he stopped smiling, his expression turning to one of sorrow.

“I am so sorry,” Victor said to me, his voice trembling. “I am sorry for everything. We never should have gone to that cave.”

“It’s not your fault,” I replied, trying to reassure him. “You did what you thought was right. We both wanted the adventure. You tried to save me.”

Victor shook his head, tears welling up in his eyes. “I doomed us both, didn’t I? We don’t belong here anymore. Everything feels wrong.”

I nodded at him silently, unsure how to feel. The weight of his words settled heavily on my shoulders.

Suddenly, I saw him flinch. I turned to look behind my shoulder and saw the shadow being standing there, its form shifting and writhing ominously.

Victor's eyes widened in fear and recognition. “I can see it now,” he whispered, his voice trembling. “The shadow... it's real. I thought it was a dream.”

I felt a chill run down my spine as the shadow being loomed closer. Victor looked at me, his eyes filled with regret and desperation. “What do we do now? Where do we go?”

I took a deep breath, feeling the gravity of the situation. “There’s only one place we can go,” I said to him. “We need to go back to the cave. Maybe we can find answers there.”

Victor nodded in silent agreement, wiping away his tears. “Alright. Let’s go.”

With that, we left the hospital, determined to face whatever awaited us in the cave. The shadow being followed us, its dark tendrils reaching out as if encouraging us to continue. We pressed on, driven by the hope that we could find a way to escape the darkness that had enveloped our lives.
