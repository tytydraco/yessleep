She first appeared at the funeral. I saw her through the corner of my teary eyes. It was unmistakable, standing behind a tree, at her own funeral……this was my Catherine.
Those cheerful eyes, now consumed by an endless void, the face that once held the smile that could cheer you up even on the darkest days, now pale and…. empty. Wearing a black veil that covered her entire body.
Without a second thought I ran up to her, going for a hug, but found nothing, except for the piercing gaze of those present at the funeral.
Some of it filled with pity for me, like I’ve lost my mind, while some filled with frustration, like I’m ruining this moment for them.  


I still think about that night, one thing led to another and there she was, opening her car door, after a heated argument.
She never made it home. 
It was some…. drunk guy, intoxicated, with pockets full of daddy’s money, ready to take away everything I’ve ever had.
I got the news in the morning, at which point I was just getting ready to go and apologise. I never got the chance to, I still remember the days we talked about growing old, sitting in that fancy front porch, seeing our grandchildren play... and yet there she was last night, bleeding out in the cold while the person she loved the most was sleeping in his bed, angry over stupid little things.

I should’ve stopped her, I know I KNOW. And there hasn’t been a single second when that thought didn’t cross my mind.
The pain, the regret... the guilt.

Life hasn’t been easy without her, the house….it feels haunted by her memories. Each step I take could’ve been a step taken with her. 
I’ve just been spending my days on the couch, praying to God that is just some super realistic dream that I will eventually wake up from. The darkness keeps me company and the endless noise from the TV never lets me think. And honestly…. its better this way.

That was when she appeared again.
Not my Catherine, can’t be. It just followed me, observed every single one of my moves, but did nothing.
I never told anyone that I was being followed by a ghost…. or demon or whatever. You see around town I was already known as “Junkie Jake”, the guy who lost his mind after the death of his girlfriend, who spends his days in his cave doing all sorts of drugs. 
My health started getting worse when she was around, it started with mild headaches and fatigue, nothing a cup of coffee and some marijuana can’t fix.
Eventually it evolved into nightmares and loss of appetite.... still not a big concern for me. 

Though I eventually realized that I was in real danger.
It was raining that night, the noise of the raindrops combined with the fatigue of not sleeping for days made me do the impossible, for the first time in weeks…. I slept in peace.

“You’re right, I can’t do this right now, im leavin-’ I jolted awake, to see nothing but darkness, not because my room wasn’t lit up, but because the void in those eyes was way too close to mine. 
I could feel her sitting on me, breathing heavily, almost as if leaning in for a kiss.
That was when I got my senses back and felt a sharp pain run down my spine, her claws… she was digging me open.
I screamed but to no avail, as if the even the words were too scared to come out, as the claws made their way to my heart, I felt my senses fade out again.

And through the void, a voice spoke.

“You know this one time when I was in eighth grade, there was this boy in my class and he was just SO cute….” It was Catherine.
“Not a care in the world, picking fights with the teachers… making weird jokes in class….”
I remembered this day.
“That boy was you…. Jake.”  She said, with a face as red as a tomato.
I stood there, watching the past us sit on a beach, watching the sun paint the blue sky golden. That was the day we confessed our love to each other.
Even though I had lived this moment before, and even though I stood in a corner, my heart still pounded faster than ever. As I watched her lips slowly come closer to mine, both too shy to kiss.
I saw it again, the black entity… watching from another corner.
She finally said  “So to answer your question…. of course— ”

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“-- I HATE YOU!!” Catherine screamed, different…. Catherine.
 “You started smoking that SHIT AGAIN?!” This was…..from our very last conversation.
I jolted back to my senses, “Cath sto-”
My speech was abruptly stopped by the deathly gaze of that entity, still standing in the corner, menacingly….

Past me spoke, “Babe it’s just, it’s been har-”
“YOU PROMISED JAKE!!” Catherine continued to lash out.
“Look…. I- I’m sorry.” I stood up from the couch.
“Is this what you have been doing behind my back? All this time?”
The room went silent, and past me tilted his head down in a losing pose

“WHAT THE FUCK JAKE!! YOU LIAR!!”  I could hear her voice start to tremble.
“Take a deep breath Cath, let’s forget this, go get changed…. I’ll put this away”
“Forget what Jake?? Forget what? You’re the one who’s-” Tears start to stream down her eyes.
I sat in horror as I watched myself make the biggest mistake of my life.
“NO STOP YOU IDIO-” The gaze intensified, and paralyzed me.

“Why…. why Jake, why. Everything was good”
“YEA, EVERYTHING WAS GOOD, EVERYTHING WAS GREAT” past me lashed out.
“THEN WHY THE FUCK DID YOU HAVE TO GET ASTHMA” 
“IT’S BULLSHIT ISN’T IT, ITS --”

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“-- gonna be okay” Past Jake said, while kissing her forehead.
Both sitting on the same dinner table, exactly a year ago.
I wasn’t afraid anymore, just confused.
“Where are we going with this” I asked the entity. No reply.
“We’ll deal with this, together” Past me said, with a reassuring smile on his face”
“And what if we can’t?” Catherine asked.
“As long as we’re together, we will.” 
“Thank you…. Jake, for being here with me” Catherine said while wiping her tears.

There was a change this time, rather…. No change. The moment didn’t abruptly change and I was just left here, wondering.
“Seems perfect, doesn’t it?” The entity spoke from behind me, for the first time.
It’s voice was…echoey, full of pain. 
“And you threw it all away, for what?” It continued.
The entity pointed his finger to something, and as I looked, I realized we were back.

“This disease it…. It ruined everything.”  I saw more tears form in her eyes but I didn’t stop.
“You made me quit, you moved in, wanted to get married, have kids and i- it’s just too much for me to handle”
“I’m sorry Cath, we were together but things still changed, this disease it…. It changed us, you grew tired and I grew bitter, and there was nothing we did to stop it.”
At that point she wasn’t even facing me, I could only hear her sob.
I suppose that was when I realized what an idiot I was, and shamelessly went to hug her, as if that would fix all the damage I had caused.
“No No NO fuck shit- I’m sorry babe I didn’t…. I didn’t-“
“I get it Jake… I mean, an asthmatic girlfriend…” she replied, trying to hold back her tears.
“You’re right, I can’t do this right now” she grabbed her keys and began walking towards me.
She tried to kiss my cheek before leaving but…. she couldn’t. I could hear her quiet sobs near my ear, and that was the moment I  teared up too. “Go sleep Jake, you seem tired”
She walked out that door and I….from the past, sat down at the table, in defeat. 
As Catherine was starting her car, I was teleported again, but this time it wasn’t the entity that bought me here, it was someone else.

“Hey how long would it take you to forget about me if I die?” Catherine asked.
This was from way early on in our relationship, we were both sitting on a bench, in a garden.
“Honestly, I don’t think I ever would, I would probably chase you even after death.” Past me replied.
“Don’t worry you won’t have to, I’ll haunt you forever” 

Every single time I looked back at this conversation, It just seemed like those cute nonsense stuff couples talked about, but not today…..it was time for me to live up to my promise.
I closed my eyes and ran, not knowing where I would end up, but somehow I ended up exactly where I wanted to be.
Near the car, with her wrapped around in my arms.
“I love you babe, I’m sorry, I mean it… I’m sorry. I’m sorry that I let things change, I’m sorry for not fully being with you when life was hard, when you came into my life… all those years ago? It was like all the puzzles in my life solved themselves, you made me feel complete, but in return I- I failed you Catherine”
“And there is nothing in this world I wouldn’t give to make things right again, I don’t care about anything else, I just want you, and even all the problems that you have, forgive me…. please.”

As I finished apologizing I realized I wasn’t hugging anything.
Catherine wasn’t in my arms, she was infront of me, dead.
She was lying on the ground after the car accident, in the pool of her own blood, bones broken, throat slit from the debris.

“You thought it was that easy?” The entity spoke from behind me.
“To receive salvation…from the ones you failed, life doesn’t work like that Jake”
“You had your chance when she was with you, but you were engaged in the things you mortals love to engage in… anger, impatience, ego.” It continued.
“YOU HAD YOUR CHANCE JAKE BUT YOU DID NOTHING…. And now you shamelessly come here, and beg for forgiveness after you fucked up everything.” 

I didn’t speak, well… I had nothing to say, he was right.
“Let me give you a final choice” The entity looked at me and we were teleported to our final destination.

It was me, sitting alone in a small apartment room, high.
There was moss growing on the ceiling, and the room smelled like a junkyard. I looked miserable, obese…. barely fitting in my chair, bags under eyes like I haven’t slept in decades. 
And looking at my current situation… I wasn’t too far off from this.

“You like that?” The entity asked.
“Ofcourse not” I replied.
“But that’s all that is left for you from here”

I looked as the other me struggled to stand up from the chair,  he took a few steps towards the kitchen and then stopped again to catch his breath.

“As for your second option, turn around.”
I turned around to see void, and in the middle of that was a fan, chair and a rope. 
“The choice is yours Jake.”
Without a moment’s hesitation, I knew what my choice was, I started walking, and it grew darker.
“Damn, what a lame ass way to go out, huh?” I chuckled to myself.
And as I went further the darkness consumed me more, the final light went out soon enough and the sensations with it, I was left all alone in darkness, it was… cold, colder than what you’d think dying feels like.
I was scared.


“Giving up so soon?” 
As I heard those words the darkness pulled away, to reveal a bright dreamy sky. The pain, the cold, the fear all went away as I felt the warmth of her hands on mine.
It was catherine, and this time I was sure she was MY catherine, she was glowing like a star, and looked absolutely beautiful.
“This isn’t one of my memories, is it?” I asked.
“Which one of your memories involves me looking like… this”
“Only all of them” I smiled.

“I missed this Jake” She said while holding my hand tighter than before.
“You saw it? Me… after you died?” I asked.
“Ofcourse I did, and it absolutely broke me, I wish I could’ve reached out sooner” 
“Listen I’m sorry-” 
“I already heard your apology, I gotta say it was pretty solid” She interrupted.
“So…. Do you forgive me?” 
She didn’t reply, instead she leaned in and kissed me on the forehead, that’s all I needed to know, tears started flowing down my eyes and I fell down to my knees.
“I’m sorry too you know… I should’ve known how you were just as much, if not more stressed than me, after all… we promised to always understand each other” She said.

“So what now? I was the one who made the choice”
“And are you happy with it?” She asked.
“Well it does seem better than being a miserable fat old man, who cant even walk 5 steps without catching his breath”
 
“But what if those weren’t the only choices?”  
“What do you me-” before I could finish speaking, catherine held both my hands and for a split second…. I saw it.
A life where I wasn’t miserable, where at the end I sat on my porch, satisfied that I didn’t give up on life.
I saw what wasn’t meant to be seen, I saw hope.

“NOW make your choice, Jake… ” 
“What if I don’t wanna go back, what if I wanna just stay here, with you” 
“The pain of waking up everyday, knowing I have to live without you,,, its too damn much” 
“I miss you… Cath.”
“And what’s wrong with that?” She replied.
“There’s nothing wrong with missing someone… Jake, but one day the hurt will stop, it’s gonna take some time but when that time comes… be willing to let that pain go.”

“And until that time comes, just know that every time you feel the hurt, I will be there”
“I will be in the air you breath, and in the music you listen”
“On a sunny day I will be the sunlight and on a cloudy one, I will be the raindrop”
“I will be in the breeze on that summer night, and in the starry sky you always admire”
“On the days you feels low, when the pain takes over, I will be the jokes that cheer you up”
“And on the days you feel victorious, I will be the cheering”
“I won’t leave you Jake, whenever you miss me, just look around”

And with that, she kissed me one last time and the void in my heart was filled, the scars healed.
I was back in my room again and realized I was holding a bottle of pills in my hand, I looked at the morning sunlight, smiled, and threw it away.
I moved on with life, without ever looking back, because this time… she wasn’t being left behind.
