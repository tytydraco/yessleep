Don't know if this is the right sub, but here we go. Apologies for the long read. I've never been a believer in the supernatural. I did spend time in high school with friends exploring cemeteries at night and abandoned buildings, never saw anything. But I did had an encounter when I was 12 that freaked me out for a couple of months making it difficult to sleep or even be in my house at night, but eventually convinced myself it was an extremely vivid nightmare. I honestly hadn't thought about in probably 20 years. Then I had a very real dream last week about that same incident and I'm starting to second guess it.

The dream was odd, almost like an out of body experience where I just kind of hovered above my 12 year old self and everything played out just like I remember. It was late at night and I woke up to go to the bathroom, but could hear static coming from my step-dads office. We had just got back into town from my his dads funeral (who I had really only gotten to know in the last year) and we had brought back an old radio he owned that we thought the speakers we broken on, but parents thought it looked cool and wanted to try and fix it. He had put it on his desk and as soon as I rounded the corner to the hallway, I could see all the down into the room. I listened for a while and could hear static and what sounded like radio stations going in and out. This is what really freaked me out though. It was pitch black but I couldn't keep from staring into the room. I couldn't even move. Through the static I started to hear a repetitive voice asking a one worded question, but I can't remember what or if I even knew what it was saying. Maybe a name? As my eyes adjusted and I could make out the shapes of the desk and the radio, I felt like someone was staring back at me. As soon as I opened my mouth to ask if my parents were in there, a shadow appeared next to the radio. I stared and it felt like it stared back, and it felt like this went on for a few minutes. As soon as it began moving towards me I ran to my room and hid in my sheets for a long time until finally screaming for my parents. They talked me down, and eventually I forgot about it and was never afraid of the dark after a few months.

Until last week when I had that dream. I woke up the next day thinking "huh, had almost forgotten about that" and carried on with my life. That night, my wife and I fell asleep in bed with the tv on. Sometime during the night, I woke up and rolled over to turn the tv off. As soon as I did and it got dark, I got that feeling again that someone was staring at me. I focused on the doorway and again felt like I couldn't look away. Then the shadow was there again, perfectly silhouetted. I couldn't make out any features other than it being at least as tall as the door frame, and that it was shifting back and forth. I stared at it for a long time considering waking my wife up to see if she could see it too, but didn't want to freak her out. It was almost like it couldn't decide whether or not to come into our room. I didn't feel the fear this time though, just that it was 'there'. I thought "maybe I'm just tired" and rolled over to try to sleep. It was at least 2 hours until I felt like it wasn't there and finally fell asleep. 

It's been a week since the night I had the dream, and every night since, at some point, the shadow is either pacing at door or leaning through. I told my wife about the dream and the first encounter the following night, but haven't said anything since. For now I'm just living with it and have started to ignore it..
