As I'm sitting in my office, I began to notice strange things tonight. It's really foggy, like I'm talking silent Hill foggy and the warehouse I'm security at is off of an exit ramp with nothing but a gas station next to it. 

There are sometimes where homeless people camp out at the station next door so seeing someone walking past on the cameras isn't something unusual. It's also Florida so there are the typical crazies here that come past. I've learned to pay them no mind. So having some action on the cameras isn't new. 

But anyways, i was watching cameras and checking my emails. It's around 6:45am. My shift is almost over, so I just have to waste another 15 minutes. All was going smoothly until out of the corner of the camera that faces the trucks on the yard I saw movement. Now it's new years day, the warehouse is closed and all the drivers are home with their families so there isn't anyone here but me. So there shouldn't be any movement on the yard by the trucks as it is all fenced and gated in. 

Due to the fog though, I couldn't see who or what it was on the yard, Now I'm white, but not go check out that strange thing on the camera white, so I figured I'd just try to get a better view with the camera. That was until, the camera connection cut out. After that I tried to use the other cameras on that side of the property to see what happened but all camera connects were off on that side. 

Soon after I heard the alert for a door being opened. Shortly after that the lights went out in half of the building. So I went to go check on the service room to flip the breaker, that's when I found out what had caused the door alert to go off. There was a tall dark humanoid figure in the hallway between me and the breaker. 

The figure almost looked like a tall man with elongated arms and legs. I could barely make out any facial features but it looked like it had sunken eyes and a flat nose. And when it moved it was almost like a stop motion picture of just like, snapping it's body into place. 

That was until it started to move quicker towards me. Luckily there is a secondary security office next to the service room to use when the building is staffed and there is two of use security on shift. I quickly opened the door and locked myself in it. 

What a joy, starting 2023 with this luck, sometimes things just never go my way. I'm now sitting in our secondary security office as that thing is still out there. Making these strange creaking and groaning sounds. 

I love working night shift, but sometimes these things make me question if it's really worth the $32 an hour. I'm unarmed security so I have no way to defend myself from anything that goes bump in the night on my shift. 

First shift still hasn't came to relieve me yet and the clocks still say 6:45am. It's going to be a long 15 minutes.
