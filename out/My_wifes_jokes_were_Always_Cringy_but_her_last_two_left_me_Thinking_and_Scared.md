On November 23th, the world took from me the sweetest, funniest and kindest person to have ever lived.

My luck was extreme the moment I met her.

"What do you call an animal who couldn't get into college?"

"Excuse me?"

I didn't know this girl but there she was. Trying to obviously make a bad joke as an attempt to break the ice between us. Never happened to me before so I was speechless. About the joke though… I was no expert so it might have been the most hilarious thing I've ever heard for all I knew or the cringiest thing in the world.

"A sloth." She started laughing at her own joke. "Get it? 'Cause they're slow?"

Joke was bad but her laughter was contagious so I started giggling

She seemed a bit tipsy but not enough to just be going out around hitting on random people.

"Are you OK, miss?" I asked out of concern. Who knew who she could've approached next if I didn't intervene. Bar was full of sketchy people after all.

"I have a car, I'll drive you home." I offered.

"That was quick, I'm not that easy you know?" She replied while winking at me.

"Easy enough to get snatched up by that bunch." I pointed at a gang of bikers at the bottom of the bar

"The fuck?" She snapped at me. "They could just be enjoying a drink just like you and me… judgy male."

"Ummh."

"Haha, just kidding. Let's get the fuck out of here." She grabbed my hand and walked me out of there.

One year later I was holding her hand and putting a ring on it. It was a family heirloom. 6 people had worn it before her.

We lived 3 amazing years together. No kids. Not for the lack of try; of course. But that never put us down.

Unfortunately tragedy struck. She fell from the roof of a building trying to safe a suicide jumper. Motherfucker survived. It was her childhood friend. A friend with no mental health history.

Now how do you move on from the loss of a loved one?

Two inseparable souls.

Two people who used to do everything together.

How can you move on from that?

I've come to the conclusion that you can't.

You just gotta learn, or at least try, to live with it.

For me, it's been getting easier day by day. She died two months ago.

I don't know what's worst, to be honest.

Living without her happy, funny personality.

Or this version of her breathing down my neck all night while I try to sleep telling me her awful dad jokes.

"You know, babe? I was wondering why the baseball ball was getting bigger and bigger… and then it hit me."

There's no "funny" on it. They're just empty words.

She was there. I ran to hug her. It was actually her… but cold. I started freezing. My fingers. Frostbite.

When she disappeared I went to the emergency room. I was fine. No lost limbs.

But despite her being at home. Almost killing me with her presence. I never asked for help. It was the love of my life after all. How could I?

The freezing cold did take my toe. That's when I got scared. Did she not mean it? Or was I with…?

All I saw when I met her and in all the time we spent together was a girl who had the heaven's gates open for her. There was no way. No way.

But she was my baby. Maybe she didn't mean to hurt me and just came down because she missed me.

She was just a little blue.

"Can a kangaroo jump higher than a house? Of course, houses can't jump."

I cry every time she tells me one of her jokes. Cry myself to sleep. But she's there to hug me. Every single time. And every single time I gotta call emergency services. They were surprised how a person almost freezes to death several times in 3 weeks.

"Close the damn windows due"

It was summer.

As she got colder I got thinner.

Like I mentioned before. I had my doubts. Is she really my girl? Or something else feeding off my grief.

Shall I seek advice?

I'm pretty weak now. But her color is coming back.

I wonder: should've my love died that day with her? Or should I die so she can live.

Last night she told me two more of her jokes.

"I'm afraid of the calendar. Its days are numbered."

"What do you do when you propose to somebody?"

She waited for my answer. But nothing came out of my mouth.

"You make sure it's a new ring… who knows? Old things might have… stuff."
