I'm writing this the next day after it happened, I'm still pretty shook about it, I couldn't sleep at night, but I'm not going to let this drag on so here it is.

Last afternoon/ early evening I was going home in the dark as usual (It's a 20-minute walk roughly, but I manage) when I got really paranoid, I walked home in the night regularly at this point, so it was quite strange that this happened, first I thought nothing of it. but as I went on the feeling got worse and worse, like an aching wound it got more and more unbearable.

The first thing I did was to hit an immediate stop, got the earbuds out of my ears, and I noticed a weird growling, and an odd dripping sound. After that I looked around to see where the noises were coming from. To my right there were suburban houses, some of them had their lights turned on and from some you can hear people speaking and enjoying themselves, however the noises that I was searching for were nowhere to be found. To my right the street opened, this place was usually busy but, it seemed like there weren't any cars driving around.

I finally looked behind myself and saw it. The creature that was 30ft from me and was nothing like I have ever seen. It was tall, I mean really tall, like twice the size of a regular person, it had greyish fur, stood on two legs while its arms stretched to where its knees could have been, with sharp claws at the end of each finger. Its head was like an alligator’s but instead of scales it had that awful gray fur. Its eyes fixated on me while its mouth was dripping with drool. I hit the immediate realization, I was its next meal, I don't know how long it had followed me or how long it had growled behind me.

I was frozen in time, unable to do, well anything, the fear had gone to me, and it was impossible for me to turn around or to even choke myself with my own hands, but I didn’t have time to think much, because it had started running to me. My legs got unfrozen, and I started running to the opposite direction. Hopely I wasn't far from home, it was only two streets, two agonizingly long streets.

That thing quickly followed behind with ease. As I was getting close to my home, the thought had gone to me that I wouldn’t have the time to open my fence door with my keys because it would be too slow, I opted instead to climb my own fence (which is 6 feet tall). Hopefully the climbing was wasn't as hard as I thought, but the creature had grabbed my leg, first I struggled but quickly I managed to escape it's grasp, but because of that, I didn't stuck the landing, my right ankle cracked pretty hard and now I can barely stand up on it, hopefully I was able to crawl into the house and shut as many shades as possible. As I said I didn't sleep at all, I checked the windows hourly while thinking about its dead eyes.
