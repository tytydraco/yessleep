I swear to fucking god I am telling a true story right now. I know this is a fictional sub but I have nobody to tell this to and I am fucking scared. 

I got in a minor accident the other day and my car is in the shop, so I have to walk to the grocery store when I want food. It's only around 3 miles round trip. I was walking home tonight, about 20 minutes ago and in the woods to my right I caught a movement. I wear noise cancelling headphones but I took them off. I heard some rustling and then it stopped, I stopped. The thing I saw stopped moving when I did. Then it started moving again, veering towards me. It was tall, about as tall as I am, about 5'11. But it had these fucking legs, these long fucking legs and its neck was disproportionate. It had a long snout, it kind of looked like a dog at first. I started walking, quickly. It started keeping up. That's when I started running and I heard it fucking running in the woods beside me. I got to an intersection with some lights and stopped running. I'm pretty out of shape. And I saw this fucking thing *peek* at me from behind a tree. I swear to fucking god its eyes looked human, they were white around the edges. And then I saw a FUCKING HAND gripping the tree trunk. I swear to fucking god. I ran all the way back to my apartment with a heavy backpack of food and beer on. I locked all my doors, I even locked my room door which is something I never do. I turned on all the lights. Now I'm sitting here writing this, with a beer to calm down. What the actual fuck was that thing. It had 4 legs, it ran on all fours in this loping, completely unnatural way. It was chasing me, I felt like I was being hunted. What the fuck was that. Does anyone know? I'm rambling at this point because I'm scared out of my fucking mind, I have never seen something like that, ever. I guess I'll stop writing now. 

Apparently this subreddit has a 500 word minimum rule so here I am filling that out. Gotta love the policies. Blah blah doobity dah. I'll just paste what I've written above. I just want to know what the fuck was it that I saw. I'm fucking scared dude.
