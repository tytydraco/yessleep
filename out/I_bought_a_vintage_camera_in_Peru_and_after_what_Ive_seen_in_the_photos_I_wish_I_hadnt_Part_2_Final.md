We donned our bags and headed towards the door.  I picked up the terrible photos and the camera and shoved it in my bag. Janice plugged in the closest police station into her google maps and we called an Uber to go there. A few moments later, we were at the police station, in the city center. 



The police officer listened patiently, took photos of the camera, and photocopies of the photos and took down my testimony. He asked questions I expected him to ask, and listened thoughtfully.  



At the end the questioning got weird. 



“Do you remember when you were in the park if there were people surrounding you while you were viewing the photos? How many negatives did you get from the film? Are you part of any occult or other groups or organizations?” the officer suddenly asked. 



“Uh, what people? No. I was alone.  I didn’t have negatives which is weird because I usually get them from my photos, I’m not part of any religious groups.” I responded.  



“Hm, well you call us if you have any issues,” the police officer said, getting up, and handing me his business card. “Good luck.” 



Janice and I looked at each other quizzically due to the strangeness of the conversation.  I reached into my bag and left the camera on a chair in the police station, hoping someone would either throw it away or take it, as we walked out the door. 



Janice punched in the address to our hotel and we waited for an uber outside. Then, I saw her. I saw a woman standing across the street in a white floral pink and purple set, watching me.  



“Janice, do you see her?” I asked, not breaking eye contact with the woman, her hands were held out towards me like she was pushing something towards my direction. Her teeth were yellow, and she had been adorned with gold jewelry that glinted under the glowy street light she was standing under.



“See what?” 



“The woman, right there,” I said pointing across the street as a large bus passed by.  When the bus passed, the woman was gone.  Janice shrugged, she didn’t see her.



We got home, and Janice’s stomach was upset.  She had gone and gotten some “fresh” ceviche at a farmers market when I was out looking at the photos in the park. Janice had terrible IBS;  but she loved to try new foods in spite of her stomach issues.  I guess she couldn't resist another round of ceviche. She left to check herself into an outpatient clinic to get some medicine.



I didn’t realize how quiet it was without her in the apartment until she was gone. All I heard was the buzzing of the air conditioner and the fridge in the background. 



I walked to the fridge and pulled out a bottle of water and took a long gulp. I didn’t realize how thirsty I was either.  When I closed the fridge, I saw something in the dark fridge reflection on the table. It was the camera, facing me.  I turned to look at it and I heard the mechanical whirring sound as it snapped a photo.   



“What the actual fuck?” 



I angrily picked the camera up, looked at it, opened the film canister and saw that somehow it had another roll of film inside of it.  I was confused, I didn’t put any new film in the camera.  I looked around the apartment briefly and stayed motionless to hear if anyone was in the place with me.  



Maybe someone broke in and was playing a prank? Maybe I was being stalked? There was nobody in the apartment with me, it was silent. 



At that moment, something compelled me to look through the viewfinder on the camera. I put the camera up to my eye, and looked through the viewfinder into the living room from where I was in the kitchen.  



There were two people sitting on my couch, dressed in neat pink and purple floral outfits.  They were sitting down looking at each other, and I heard the camera click on its own, after the shutter snapped open their faces twisted in forced smiles, they were looking at me now. 



I took the camera away from my face, and saw that there was nobody sitting on the couch, only when I looked through the viewfinder. My knees felt wobbly, my fingertips felt cold and so did my lips, I felt the pinprick of sweat starting on my chest and forehead again. 



Again, something compelled me to keep looking through the viewfinder and see what else was in the apartment with me. 



I turned to the dining room table right in front of me and saw that it was full of terribly strange looking food, with people wearing floral, seated on each and every chair seemingly waiting for instruction.  The camera clicked again on its own and they turned to face me. 



I took a step back, and felt the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. I was feeling nauseated, and heard the click of the camera again. At the head of the table a black hooded figure appeared with the crown on its head. A wave of nausea rose from the bottom of my toes to the back of my throat.  That’s when I dropped the camera. 



I ran to my room and slammed the door shut locking it, I felt wetness on my chest and realized I’d vomited.  My neck was wet with sweat and I felt the same uneasiness I felt when I was at the park. 



I dug my phone out of my pocket and with shaky fingers dialed the police officer's number.   It rang a few times. 



“Hello?” I asked when I heard someone pick up.  “Hola, me llamo Matthew, I talked to you today,” I said frantically.



There was heavy breathing on the other line, then the sound of choking, then laughter. “We are so grateful you’ve used the film,” the voice said, the tone was split into a high and low octave when it spoke.



I tried to breathe, putting my hand on my wet chest. 



“It’s almost ready for you now, and we are so hungry,” the voice said. 



“What? Hello?” I hiccuped. 



“Hello, Officer Gonzalez speaking,” the voice from the police officer earlier rang through on the line. 



“Did - did you say something just now?” I choked out.  

“Excuse me? Is this a prank call? Can I help you?” the voice of what sounded like the offider I spoke to at the station said, rather annoyed. I must have been hearing things. 



“No, no this is the person you spoke to earlier about the camera, can you please send someone over to my apartment number.  I think there are people here, or someone is stalking me and has the key to my apartment.  Someone must have broken in and left the camera I left at the station here.  There’s people in the living room,” I said desperately. 



“Ok, we will send someone over right now, try to stay calm.  Are you able to exit the area?” the officer asked. 



“No, they’re in the living room,” I said looking for somewhere to hide in my room. “Please, just come quick.  Please.” 



I pulled myself under the bed of the room, closed my eyes and tried to slow my breathing down.  



I heard what sounded like clinking of knives and forks in the dining room, and footsteps.  I didn’t hear any voices, but all the sounds of dinner, the cups being lifted to mouths, the fridge being opened and closed.  I scooted myself as far under the bed as I could and I felt my foot hit something small, plastic, brick-shaped.  



I looked down and saw the lens of a camera facing me, I heard the mechanical snap of the camera, and saw a bright flash, before I passed out. 



I woke to the fluorescent lights of the paramedics, I was sitting with a foil blanket wrapped around me.  



“Matthew, are you okay?” Janice’s voice said, I felt her beside me. Apparently she was discharged from the hospital.



“They said that you were lying under the bed, staring into the viewfinder of that weird camera.  You were catatonic, you weren’t responding to anything.  They pulled you out here, and here and you passed out again.  



I don’t remember any of that.  But I felt terrible.  I wanted to get out of Lima.  



After the commotion, we had some rest in the apartment. I was determined to speak to the woman that sold me the camera in the first place.  



I didn’t want to get Janice involved, so I stopped telling her what was going on, and made sure to keep the camera away from her and hidden.  I told her I was feeling much better and was going for a walk. 

I took a trek to the vintage shop where I got the camera from.



I entered the shop with all the old electronics but it was different.  The kiosk I purchased the camera from wasn’t there anymore.  In its spot was a person selling used Barbie dolls, the fish tank was there, but instead of cameras it was filled with Barbie doll parts, like strollers, hats, and headless doll bodies. 



I went over to the stalls to a person that was selling toys next to the lady and in broken Spanish asked where the lady that sold the camera was.  I even pulled out the camera that I purchased and pointed to the area where she sold it to me. 



The man just shook his head and shrugged, apparently the shops were rotating and the woman that was there didn’t have enough to make her rent for that space, and had left.  I tried to ask where she went, but I got nothing. 



Maybe, the man that developed my photos knew something about what was going on.  It was a random guess but what did I have to lose at this point? I plugged in the film print shop to the address in my GPS, and walked over and what I saw there shocked me.



I saw police tape in the area, and the shop was blocked off.  There was no way to access it, and my heart sank to my bowels when I saw the purple and pink flower motif painted on the front of the film development place. Out of frustration I took the camera out of my pack and threw it into the middle of the street. I saw a car run over it, smashing it to bits. 



I’m back home in my room now, with the door locked. I guess I’m writing this to let anyone know to heed warnings. I’m not sure what to do.  



I found some more developed photos underneath my bed when I got in. I know I didn’t take them.  Someone must have taken photos of me when I was hiding under the bed.  It showed me looking through the viewfinder of the camera, my mouth was agape, a puddle of drool pooling at my chin and on the floor. 



I was surrounded underneath the bed by bare feet, next to each pair of feet was a purple and pink floral plate, empty with chrome silverware on top. The next photos showed hands pressed flat against the floor, next to the plates.  The photos after that were the strained smiling faces that joined the hands that stared at me underneath the bed. There was a photo of a pink tongue that touched the viewfinder, and there were photos of the hands touching my body.  



The last photo was a photo of me under the bed still looking through the camera viewfinder, stupefied.  There was darkness around my body, like I was being enveloped in a vice grip-like hug of black.  Was that the creature? I felt myself smiling and a tear rolling down my face because right behind my head was the indecipherable face, donning the ornate golden crown.  I was being swallowed under the bed by its suffocating embrace. 



I’m really not sure where to go now, I guess I’m writing this as a last shot in the dark. My Spanish is terrible, and it's so hard to ask people for help when I can’t even verbalize in English what’s going on. 



I don’t think the police believe me and I’m at a loss at how to get rid of the negatives now that the camera shop seems like it’s being investigated.  



If anyone is out there, with ideas please give me suggestions.  After I finish this post, I’m going to book a flight out of Lima back to Los Angeles. My last hope is that this camera won’t follow me home.
