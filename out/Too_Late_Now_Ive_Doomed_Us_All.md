**Mog is dead.**

Which is inconvenient.

Grok stands over him, breathing hard. Chest tight. Hand still red.

Brain still catching up.

Didn’t mean to kill him. Not really.

Mog pushed first. Grok grabbed rock. Now Mog’s head looks… wrong. Like smashed fruit.

Not fixable.

Shit.

Grok looks around. Camp still. People sleeping. Fire low.

No one saw.

…Right?

He wipes his hands on his fur, which does nothing, then looks down at Mog again.

Big problem.

Dead Mog means questions. Questions mean talking. Talking means someone figures it out.

Okay. Okay. Fix it.

Step one: Make Mog not be here.

Grok grabs Mog’s arms. Pulls.

Mog is very heavy. Heavy before. Somehow heavier now.

Drags him toward the trees. Gets about three feet before he’s soaked in sweat.

Halfway there, stops. Thinking.

…Does he need to move him?

Maybe Mog fell here. Maybe Mog just… stays here.

That’s better, right? Less weird?

Grok drags him back. Puts him exactly where he started. Steps back.

Still looks bad.

The blood. The rock.

Grok grabs rock. Flings it into trees.

Crack. Too loud.

A voice.

Behind him.

“What was that?”

Grok freezes.

Shit.

By the fire, a man shifts, groggy. Thick. Tired. Scratching his face.

Squinting at the trees.

This is Ool. Mog’s brother.

\--

**Meanwhile – A Different Tribe Sleeps**

The fire burns low. Only embers now.

A man stirs. Scratches his beard. Rolls over.

Then —

Crack.

His eyes open.

A sound. Distant. In the trees.

He blinks. Listens. The wind? An animal?

Nothing. Silence now.

Probably nothing.

He rolls back over. Sleeps.

\--

**Back at First Camp – A New Problem**

Ool blinks sleep from his eyes. Frowns. Rubs his face.

He squints at the trees—then at Mog. Then at Grok.

“…Mog sick?”

Grok grabs onto that like a drowning man.

“Yes,” he says. “Mog sick.”

Ool squints. Nods. Thinks.

Then—suspicion.

“How sick?”

Grok did not think this far ahead.

Behind them, the camp stirs. People waking. Stretching. Looking. Seeing.

And just like that—this is no longer just Grok’s problem.

It’s all of theirs.

The sun is rising.

Grok is still standing over Mog.

The camp is awake now. Everyone is looking at the body. No one is talking yet.

Just staring.

Scratching. Thinking.

Which is bad.

Thinking leads to questions.

Questions lead to problems.

Ool kneels next to Mog. Pokes the body.

Nothing.

He pokes again. Still nothing.

He sits back. Scratches his beard. Nods.

“Mog dead.”

Everyone nods.

Yes. Mog dead. That is clear.

Grok should feel relieved.

He does not.

Because the next question is coming.

The one he does not want.

And then it happens.

“Why?”

Shit.

\--

**The Cover-Up**

Grok steps in fast.

“Mog sick,” he says. Firm. Final. Like it was always true.

Thog. Old wise man. Frowns.

“Sick how?”

Grok did not prepare for follow-ups.

He thinks. Hard.

“Bad sick.”

Ool tilts his head.

“Sick fast? Or sick slow?”

Grok’s brain is melting.

“…Fast?”

“Like Haga?”

Haga is very old. Has been ‘dying’ for many moons.

Grok shakes his head. “No.”

“Like Bo’s brother?”

Bo’s brother ate wrong berries last spring. Died screaming.

“…No.”

Ool squints.

“Then what kind of sick?”

Grok wants to die.

The tribe is watching now. Waiting.

Then—Haga speaks. The oldest, most wrinkled woman in the clan.

She leans forward. Sniffs the air.

“Mog smell bad,” she says.

Everyone nods immediately.

Yes. Mog does smell bad.

They did not notice before.

But now? Yes. Definitely.

Haga leans closer.

“Maybe sickness in body.”

Another big nod from the group.

Yes. Sickness inside.

That sounds right.

Grok lets out a slow, shaky breath.

He has survived.

…Until someone says something worse.

“Sickness spreads.”

Pause.

Everyone takes a very small step back.

Just in case.

Grok clenches his jaw.

This is getting away from him.

Fast.

He should stop it. Say something.

But they’re already talking. Already deciding.

Then Ool squints at the ground.

A frown. A pause. A slow, awful moment of realization.

“…These not Mog’s feet.”

\--

**The Bad Conclusion**

Grok blinks. What?

Ool points at the dirt.

“Mog feet big. These feet small.”

Grok looks.

It is just footprints.

Their own footprints. From when they stood here yesterday.

But Ool has already decided.

“These feet not Mog,” he says again.

Now the others are looking.

Frowning. Thinking.

Someone mutters. “…Then who?”

Silence.

Someone hisses through their teeth. A warning sound.

Then—a new idea.

“They come in night.”

The group shifts. Eyes scanning the dark spaces beyond the fire.

Another voice. “They kill Mog.”

And just like that, the sickness is gone.

This is no longer a problem about Mog.

This is now a problem about Them.

Grok watches, stunned.

The murder he committed?

Now belongs to someone else.

\--

**Meanwhile – Other Tribe**

Other tribe wakes.

The fire is low. Only embers now.

People stretch. Yawn. Scratch.

A father lifts his child onto his shoulders.

“Too high,” the father warns.

“Not high enough,” the kid grins.

A man tests the weight of his fight stick.

Another watches the horizon. Squints.

“…Smoke.”

They are living their lives.

They have no idea they’re about to be accused of murder.

A man points to the distance. “That fire bigger than normal.”

Others look.

They don’t know it, but they’re watching Mog’s body burn.

A man shifts. Uneasy.

“That’s not normal.”

A woman squints. “Could be.”

“Maybe they’re just… burning something.”

“Not our problem.”

Silence.

Then—

A man kneels by the fire.

“…Where’s the meat?”

Heads turn.

Someone shrugs. “Maybe someone ate it.”

“No. It was for today. Nobody would’ve touched it.”

A slow look at the trees.

A flicker of doubt.

Then—one of the men scratches his beard.

“I thought I heard something last night.”

Another man, rubbing his eyes: “What?”

“A noise. In the trees.”

“Probably an animal.”

He nods, but slower this time. “…Yeah. Probably.”

Pause.

Then—movement.

The morning moves on.

The conversation doesn’t.

\--

**Back to Grok’s Tribe – Now It’s a War Problem**

Ool has fully made up his mind.

“Mog strong,” he says. “Mog not die easy.”

“Mog killed by them.”

A new energy runs through the tribe.

Fear. Anger.

Grok watches it grow. Spread.

Become something he can’t stop.

Someone picks up a rock.

Someone grips their fight stick tighter.

Someone starts talking about revenge.

And Grok realizes—

He didn’t just kill Mog.

He started something much bigger.

\--

**Nightfall – The War Party**

They move quietly.

Not because they know how to move quietly. They don’t.

They are big, clumsy, breathing hard, stepping on every dry branch possible.

But they think they are quiet.

And that matters more.

Ool leads. He has the biggest fight stick. That makes him in charge.

Behind him:

Bo, who just likes hitting things.

Sulla, who’s not sure why they’re doing this but also doesn’t want to be left out.

Grok, who absolutely knows this is a mistake but has zero control anymore.

They march toward the rival tribe.

In their minds, the war already happened.

Mog is dead.

The enemy must pay.

None of this is true.

But the more they repeat it, the more real it feels.

Grok grips his club. Thinks.

...What happens if they get there and realize the enemy didn’t do it? ...What happens if they kill someone anyway? ...What happens if this never stops?

Too late now.

Ool raises a hand. They stop.

The rival tribe’s fire glows ahead.

“Soon,” Ool whispers.

Grok exhales slow.

This was never supposed to happen.

\--

**Meanwhile – The Other Tribe**

Their fire crackles. Their people eat, talk, live their lives.

One woman tends to her newborn. She is exhausted.

Two men squat near a pile of food.

“You bring this?” the first man asks, holding up a handful of withered berries.

“Yes.”

“These are bad.”

“They are food.”

“They are bad food.”

“Well, you bring nothing.”

“I was hunting.”

“You have no meat.”

“You have no berries.”

A long pause.

“…I hate you.”

The hunter snorts. The gatherer grins.

An old man sharpens a new kind of weapon.

A stick with a sharp rock tied to it.

A younger man watches, curious.

“Why?” the young man asks.

The old man turns the weapon in his hands.

“…Easier to kill,” he says.

They don’t know it, but they’ve invented the first spear.

It was just a random idea. A passing thought.

But tonight, it will change everything.

Because tonight, someone will see it.

And tonight, someone will misunderstand what it means.

\--

**The Bad Attack**

Ool’s group watches the rival tribe.

The fire flickers. People move in the orange light.

Ool grips his fight stick.

Grok closes his eyes. He knows this is wrong.

Then Bo moves.

Too soon.

He steps on a branch.

Loud. Way too loud.

The rival tribe looks up. Sees them.

A long, awful moment where both sides just stare at each other.

Not sure what to do.

Then—

One of them stands.

He is holding the spear with the tied rock.

The first weapon like it.

Ool’s tribe sees enemy hold it. Holding proof.

That’s it. That’s how they killed Mog.

Not with normal rock.

With stick-rock.

That’s what made the hole in his head.

And now, the enemy is holding it.

Right there.

Proof.

Ool roars.

And history bleeds.

\--

**And All Because of a Lie**

The rival tribe barely has time to react.

The first-ever battle between humans begins.

It is not graceful. It is not tactical.

It is stupid.

People swing clubs. At nothing. At each other.

Someone throws a rock. Hits the wrong person. Claims it was the enemy.

A man charges, trips over his own feet, slams face-first into a tree.

Another grabs an enemy by the hair, realizes mid-swing it’s his cousin.

Too late. Already committed.

Someone tries to run away. Gets clubbed for being a coward.

Someone drops their weapon.

Immediately picks up a fight stick that is somehow worse.

Nobody knows what they’re doing.

They are inventing war badly.

Grok swings. Misses. Gets tackled.

Ool swings. Misses. Hits Bo instead.

A man from the rival tribe raises his hands. Tries to surrender.

They don’t know what that means yet.

So they kill him.

A burning stick arcs high, vanishing into the brush.

The brush catches fire.

And just like that—their world is burning.

All because Grok picked up a rock.

\--

**But the Damage Stays**

People crawl away from the fire.

Some dead. Some dying. Some missing fingers. Some missing eyes.

One man holds his own tooth in his palm.

Just stares at it.

No one won. No one ever will.

Both sides just stop.

Because there is nothing left to fight for.

Grok leans against a tree.

Breathing hard.

Looking around.

Mog is still dead.

Bo is missing.

Half the tribe is wounded.

The other half? Will never stop thinking about revenge.

Ool sits next to him.

Silent.

Covered in blood.

They watch the bodies burn.

The rival tribe watches too.

Nothing is said.

Nothing ever will be.

This is the world now.

\--

**Regret**

A woman moves through the aftermath.

She steps over bodies. Past smoldering embers.

The air is thick.

Smoke. Blood.

Something worse.

Then—she stops.

A rock.

Small. Stained. Out of place.

She kneels. Picks it up. Turns it in her hand.

It doesn’t belong here.

She looks at the battlefield.

Then back at the rock.

For a moment, she considers keeping it.

Proof. Truth.

The first real evidence of what happened.

Then she looks at Grok.

Across the fire. Watching.

Neither of them speaks.

They don’t have to.

He knows. She knows.

And she will say nothing.

Her fingers tighten around the rock.

Then—slowly, deliberately—she drops it.

Kicks dirt over it.

Burial. Erasure.

The first cover-up in human history.

The fire burns.

Grok turns from it.

And steps into the dark.
