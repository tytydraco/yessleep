If there is a job that no one actually wants to do, it's call center work. I firmly believe any claims of there being contract call center companies that are on the level and not hell to work at are manufactured to trick people into applying.

​

What you take calls for may vary, but the experience is the same, you start each day hoping that it won't be back-to-back calls, and end the day kicking yourself for hoping working conditions would be fair this time.

​

Eventually, the client catches on to the company half-assing their work, and they get dropped.

​

That leads to scrambling for a new client who if they’re working with us, that’s an indicator of shadiness right off the back.

​

In my case, the trouble began when our client UltraSAT, was acquired by another company called “IFTV”.

​

None of us could find much about the company, but everyone was worried about what could come from this.

​

Pay cuts were expected, along with possible relocation, or INFTV deciding they didn’t want to pay the lease on the building and make us work from home. We did find out that they would be making changes to programming available, so that meant tons of calls where people would be asking “where did these channels go?”.

​

The changes were said to go into effect that Friday, at the end of our work week.

​

That Friday, I sat down at my cubicle and readied in.

​

Within half a second, I was on a call, it was a pretty basic one, an older sounding customer asking why his screen was stretched.

​

I started out asking probing questions, then explained that older TV shows are in a different aspect ratio, and his receiver was trying to correct the resolution to make it fit.

​

It sounds simple, but for our customer base, I might as well be explaining quantum physics in another language.

​

Little did I know my first call of the day would be one of the last normal calls I’d get for the rest of my shift.

​

The next call came in, I’m going to try my best to recall it and the other ones I received that night from memory.

​

“Thank you for calling UltraSAT. How may I help you today?”

​

All I heard at first was the sound of someone sobbing, then he spoke.

​

“I… I can’t see my TV.”

​

I checked my knowledge base and got ready to play twenty questions to get to the problem.

​

“Alright, have you checked to make sure the TV is plugged in and turned on?”

​

“I can’t… I can't see anything.”

​

Visually impaired customers weren’t a rare scenario, so I had to pull up what we did to troubleshoot with them.

​

“Okay, sir, is there anyone who can help you?”

​

He started to sob again.

​

“No, they’re gone… he took them from me.”

​

“He?”

​

He started to sound frustrated.

​

“The TV man you sent over, he said he was here to update our cable box, but instead he took my family away!”

​

“Sir, please calm dow-“

​

He cut me off with angry shouting.

​

“The bastard knocked me to the floor while another one ran at my wife, and he dug his thumbs into my eyes!”

​

That last part caught my attention.

​

“I’m sorry, did you just say one of our technicians stuck his thumbs in your eyes?”

​

“YES! While he held me down, I heard the other one dragging my wife away! I don’t even know how long it’s been. I had to feel around for just the shape of my phone, and when I asked Siri to call 911, it just kept calling your fucking company!”

​

He was just yelling. I would have rerouted him to emergency services, but we can only transfer to other departments.

​

“Help me! There has to be someone you can put me through that can at least get an ambulance out here!”

​

I finally went to Slack and asked for help. I saw that I wasn’t the only one getting customers screaming for help, every single one was responded to with “transfer to supervisor line.”

​

I hated that, because normally all that happens is , they just go to another department because we don’t have a supervisor line, which means they eventually call back even angrier than before, but I was starting to get messages to get off the phone, so I told the customer I said that I would get him to a supervisor and transferred the call.

​

This became a call type I would get, and that was how they would end most of the time.

​

The second type of call I got would be people complaining about the new channels and programming, which included:

​

The pain channel, whose programming consisted of shows about people being severely injured with names like “That should have killed ‘em”, “extreme animal mauling's”, and “Who wants to be a pile of red goo?”.

​

The Monster Network, these shows all revolved around monsters ripping people apart.

​

And one that most would just describe as “the staring channel”.

​

These were also resolved by transferring to a “supervisor”.

The last type of call, I dreaded getting again.

​

It would go like this:

​

“Thank you for calling UltraSAT-“

​

“Please! Send a technician, something is wrong with our TV!”

​

“Okay, calm down, ma’am. What’s wrong with your TV?”

​

“It’s trying to eat me!”

​

“What?”

​

“It’s trying to EAT ME!”

​

That’s when I heard the sound of banging on a door.

​

“You’ve got to send someone! Please! It’s about to-“

​

Her pleas were interrupted by the door being broken down, the remainder of the call consisted of the customer screaming. Per our rules, I had to hang up after she failed to respond after I reached out to her three times.

​

10 hours of these calls, with my only reprieve being 2 15-minute breaks, lunch, and one final 10 minute break.

​

We weren't allowed to use our phones in the breakroom, so I just walked in, bought a snack, and walked out. I didn't notice at the time that more and more of my coworkers were just sitting there at the tables.

​

It was near the end of my shift, so to spare myself from going into overtime with these calls, I did an old trick:

I made sure that as soon as the call was over, it went to break.

​

From there, it was just a matter of luck, I was hoping the next call would not end before 11:50.

​

I got very lucky, it was one of the now rare basic troubleshooting calls, a welcome change from what I had been experiencing all night. After helping the customer with his TV input problems, the call ended, and I went right to break.

​

It was when I arrived at the break room for the last time that I noticed something was wrong with my coworkers. They were all just standing in a circle in the middle of the room, most of them I remember seeing on my prior breaks and lunch, they clocked out hours ago, they shouldn't still be here. I walked over to them, a little confused.

​

That's when I noticed the smell, well smells, tandem odors competing to see which one would make me gag first, what I can now identify as Sulfur, and Flesh.

​

“Um, hey, what's going on? Is there a meeting or something?”

​

My question hung in the air, it was like they didn't even know I was there.

​

“Hello? “

​

I got in front of one of my coworkers, and immediately recoiled… his eyes were missing, I turned to see that everyone on the other side of the circle were missing their eyes as well.

​

I looked down and saw in the center a pile of human eyes.

​

“What the fuck?!” I remember shouting and backing away from the circle

​

“What is wrong with all of you?!

​

Nobody answered, instead, they all started holding hands and whispering.

​

I backed up to the door, and I saw the time on the clock, it was midnight.

​

It starts becoming a blur from here. I remember the temperature getting higher, and an orange light coming from inside the circle of coworkers.

​

And what looked like the silhouette of a person rising up from the floor, then clear as day, it spoke:

​

“Hello former UltraSAT employees, and welcome to the start of your new career as an employee of Inferno TV! Now hold on tight, as you will have to relocate.”

​

It was when the ground began shaking violently, I finally felt like I was able to leave the break room and ran out the exit door to my car, I sped out of the parking lot, in my rearview mirror I saw my now former place of work continuing to shake, before what i could only describe as large red fingers emerging from the ground.

​

They wrapped around the building and began to pull it down. The last thing I remember was driving home, locking all of my doors, and sitting in the corner of my bedroom holding a bible to my chest.

​

I woke up the next morning and felt compelled to go back to work, or at least the building.

What I found was the aftermath of A giant demonic hand pulling a building into the ground, looks like I'm unemployed.

​

In between job hunting, I found an article that had been written about UltraSAT, that my building had been built on top of limestone caves and that a sinkhole had formed and caused the collapse, and no bodies could be exhumed at this moment.

Looking at the national news confirmed it was not confined to just my building.

I did get my last paycheck, though, well, I got a stack of  money  with slightly burned edges on my coffee table with a note that read.

“We’re sad to see you go, but if you're ever in the neighborhood, you're always welcome back and we will be waiting for you. Inferno-TV, formerly UltraSAT.”
