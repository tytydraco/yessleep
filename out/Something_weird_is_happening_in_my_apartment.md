  In case anyone finds this post, the reason for its creation is to keep track of what I have been experiencing lately in my apartment. Recently I have been noticing some strange things happening here, for instance I have a sort of routine I go through every day. I wake up, I shower, brush my teeth, and eat before leaving for work. A simple routine however on three occasions this week I noticed my clothes I set out to be moved from where I put them, but not far from where I had them just far enough to make me question. When it first happened I just figured I forgot I placed them there but when it happened again later in the week I considered someone is fucking with me. I checked my front door and it was still locked, the door latch was still connected since I feel a lot more comfortable having it on then not.

  I never bothered checking the window since I live on the fourth floor and I don’t have a balcony. The door is the only entrance and since it was still locked I just figured I was going crazy, I mean yeah it’s entirely possible to relock a door but to reattach the latch when exiting is surely difficult if not impossible.  So I went about my usual schedule until I noticed more, food kept being moved now. Not like being left out but inside my fridge a couple items would be rearranged, and the pantry would have a couple items misplaced into a cupboard. I feel like I am going crazy so I am writing this all on here to maybe vent or clear my mind if that makes sense. I will write some more underneath this when something else happens or if I feel like I need to vent.

   Today I found my bread had been moved into my cupboard that I use to store my plastic containers. This is surprisingly not too weird but I figured I should at least write it down since it would be good to at least catalogue it even if it was such a minor occurrence.

   I woke up shivering a good 20 minutes ago due to the ac in my room being set to 38°. This is a first since only objects in my apartment have been messed with, not any appliances. Feels like since I started paying attention to whatever is happening the more things start to happen. None of this feels real though like I am dreaming, I think I need some more sleep.

   I just recently woke up and hadn’t even realized I had been asleep for about 17 hours since I woke up earlier. I didn’t even realize I was so tired or that I could even sleep so much, I’m starving too and feel like I haven’t eaten in days. Could that even be possible? I need to eat something so I will be back when something happens again.

Nothing has happened in three days. I just feel like writing here. It helps destress myself from this whole situation. That sounds weird like I am in danger of being hurt, no threats have happened, no secret injuries. Nothing.



Nothing

I can’t explain it but have you ever felt like you’re being watched? Not like oh something is behind me, more like no matter what you do whether you hide under the blankets or change rooms. Closing the door behind you and checking every corner, cabinet, and drawer. That there is someone just watching your move.  You know now that I think about it, when did I last follow my daily routine? When did I last eat, brush my teeth, or even go to work.  No one has called, I haven’t even heard someone moving outside my hallway. Has the world gone quiet while I remain vocal or am I simply losing it. I need sleep

Something is shuffling around my room. I look for the noise and yet I see nothing there but I know what I heard. I heard it moving. Where is it. WHY CAN’T I FIND IT.



Maybe it’s in the pantry

I don’t remember writing anything here a couple days ago. Which is weird cause I vividly remember that day too. Nothing happened that was strange, I hadn’t even noticed I wrote anything on here until today cause I noticed something new.  My apartment. I can’t help but feel like it’s bigger somehow.  The reason I say this is because walking to my door has me take two extra steps. I could of course be overthinking but now that I see an entry I didn’t write. I don’t know what to think anymore. It’s been silent in my whole building, no upstairs neighbors walking around, no loud music from down the hallway. Not even the sound of cars driving down the road. Something is off with either the world, my apartment, or me.  Looking at what is written I mention my pantry.  I will go see if I left anything there and be right back.

I am currently outside of my apartment. I don’t even know what to do anymore but I refuse to go back to that place.  I can assure you all that I am safe, I am currently a good thirty minutes away from the building. Let me explain what happened because I need to still wrap my head around what happened before I force myself to forget.  I went to my pantry and at first everything looked alright.  The pantry still had everything I had placed inside it like usual, bread, cereal, cans of food, etc.  However I couldn’t help but feel like something was off so I began to move stuff aside to look deeper, and that’s when I saw that my pantry was in fact bigger than before. So much bigger.  I removed more items so I could get an even better view but that only made it more apparent that my pantry’s back wall went further back than possible.

I grew curious so I checked my cupboard and sure enough it was similar. It took me about a good hour checking in different spots around my apartment to see what changed.  The places that had been changed were my pantry, cupboards, and my bathroom cabinet.  Each of these places I frequented constantly so how I managed to not notice was concerning. I began to pace about my room when I heard this sound, it was like a shuffle as if someone was dragging a heavy blanket across the floor.  I couldn’t pinpoint where it came from but it was growing louder as it went on.  I began to panic so I grabbed some of my belongings like my laptop and shoved them into a bag. Just as I was leaving the room I heard the doorknob to my pantry begin to jiggle. I ran without even closing the door cause I was terrified. I don’t know what was going to come through there but I can only imagine. I am currently writing this in my car, every so often I see a car drive by me. It feels like a huge weight has been lifted off my chest since I hadn’t heard any signs of life for a good while now. One thing for certain I will never go back there, I just want to forget it all.
