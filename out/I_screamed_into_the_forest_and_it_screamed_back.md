I'm writing this here in case someone can make sense of it. I know I can’t, and God only knows where my friends are.

We went camping last weekend. Me, Yves, and Mark. Just us three, like it always was back in college. It wasn’t anything elaborate; just a quick trip to a thick patch of forest Yves had read about on some obscure blog. “Undiscovered,” the post claimed. “Still wild.” That should’ve been our first red flag.

Yves was always scrolling through the internet for places like that…*off the grid*, *untouched*, barely documented. He’d say things like *“That’s where the real silence lives”* or *“If Google doesn’t know where you are, neither does your anxiety.”* He liked the idea of being lost, I think. Or maybe he liked watching the rest of us squirm when we felt that creeping helplessness he seemed so at ease with.

It was a Thursday morning when I got the call. I’d just closed my laptop after a brutal meeting and slumped back in my chair when my phone buzzed. Yves, of course.

“You coming?” he said, no greeting, just right into it.

I sighed, rubbing my eyes. “Yves, I have two deadlines and a busted AC. My weekend plans were to cry into a fan.”

He chuckled on the other end. “It’s untouched land, Zulfi. No campers. No kids. No goddamn Instagram tags. Just trees and sky and our dumb asses under it.”

I hesitated. I always do. Yves knew how to fish my interest with just the right kind of bait. The words *untouched* and *no kids* had their hooks in me.

“Mark’s already in,” he added. “Don’t make me come drag you out of that airless apartment.”

I rolled my eyes, grinned a little in spite of myself, and said the words I always seem to regret:

“Fine. One weekend. And if I die of mosquito bites, I’m haunting you.”

“You say that every time,” Yves said. “Maybe this time it'll stick.”

We met up at Yves’ place the next morning. Mark showed up last, as always, with a lopsided grin and a six-pack swinging from one hand.

“Still alive, huh?” he said, giving me a quick side-hug.

“Barely,” I mumbled. “But I brought bug spray and the crushing weight of adulthood, so I should be good.”

“Damn, you bought your virginity too?”

Yves was already tossing our gear into the back of his Jeep. He looked at us like a parent trying not to yell at two kids holding him up.

“You girls done gossiping?” he smirked.

“Bite me,” I said, and we all laughed.

We drove in silence after the first hour. The roads got smaller, then narrower, until they weren’t really roads anymore. Just stretches of gravel broken by roots and the occasional deer carcass. Eventually, we reached the dead-end; the supposed “entry point” from the blog. No parking lot. No trail markers. Just a rusted metal gate that had collapsed under years of disuse and a wooden sign so faded I couldn’t tell if it once had a warning on it.

“Is this even legal?” I asked adjusting my backpack.

Yves shrugged. “Define legal.”

Mark locked his car and gave a low whistle. “Eight hours, huh? Better not be lying about that lake, Yves.”

“It’s worth it,” Yves promised; “You’ll see.”

The hike started off easy. The trail or what passed for one wound through thick trees and patches of mossy earth that felt like walking on a sponge. We talked less as the hours wore on, saving our breath. Occasionally Yves would point something out a strange mushroom, a clawed-up tree trunk, what he called “signs of healthy wildlife.” Mark just grunted and kept walking.

It was hour seven when we started hearing the water. That soft, rhythmic hush of a lake before you can see it. The trees opened up like a curtain, and there it was.

The lake was quiet. Too quiet. The surface smooth like glass, catching the greyish-pink light of the setting sun. It was beautiful, yes, but it didn’t feel still. It felt… held. Like the lake was holding its breath, waiting for us to get just a little closer.

Behind it, a ridge of mountains loomed jagged like broken teeth. The sky above them was a bruised color I couldn’t name, and for a moment, I felt something in my gut go cold. Like I’d just looked into a room I wasn’t supposed to see.

Mark let out a long breath. “Damn. Okay. Worth it.”

Yves grinned and dropped his pack. “Told you.”

We set up camp near the lake’s edge, close enough to hear the water lapping but far enough from the tree line that we wouldn’t get eaten alive by whatever came crawling after dark. The tents went up smoothly, the fire caught easily, and by the time night rolled in, we had beers in hand and sausages skewered over the flames.

*It was good. It really was.*

We sat on fallen logs, talking about old professors and the time Yves tried to flirt with that one barista who turned out to be married to a minor celebrity. We talked about how weird it was to be almost thirty and still feel like we were waiting for our lives to start. How quiet it had gotten in our heads lately. Like parts of us had gone missing and we hadn’t noticed until the world slowed down long enough to hear the silence.

The wind picked up a little. The fire crackled. The shadows stretched long behind us, curling into the trees.

Yves took a swig from his beer and looked out at the lake.

“Still wild,” he murmured.

I don’t know why, but that stuck with me. The way he said it. Like he wasn’t sure if that was a good thing or not.

Later that night, with our bellies full of Yves’ awful chili and our faces flickering red and gold in the firelight, I stood up on a whim. Maybe it was the beer. Maybe it was the eerie calm that had settled over the trees. Maybe I was just trying to break the silence that had begun to feel a little *too* thick. Either way, I stood and shouted into the woods like an idiot.

“We’re gonna die out here!”

It was meant to be funny. The kind of stupid thing people say right before the monster appears in some cliché horror film. I even expected laughter some groan from Mark, a sarcastic clap from Yves. But what I got instead… was an answer.

“We’re gonna die out here.”

Same words. Same voice.

*My* voice.

Only it came back too quickly far too quickly. Not like an echo bouncing off trees or mountains. No delay. No fading trail. Just clean, immediate mimicry. As if someone had been standing right there, just beyond the firelight, listening. Waiting. And ready to speak the moment I finished.

I froze. My breath hitched in my throat like a caught thread. The hair on the back of my neck prickled, slow and electric.

“Did you guys hear that?” I asked, my voice quieter now. Tighter. The humor had died somewhere between my spine and my chest.

Mark blinked up at me, chewing on a half-burnt sausage. “Hear what?”

“That echo,” I said, glancing toward the trees. “It sounded… wrong.”

Yves was still crouched near the fire, stirring embers with a stick. He didn’t look up. “You echoing yourself now?” he muttered.

“No,” I said, eyes scanning the black beyond the treeline. “It didn’t sound like *an* echo. It sounded like—like someone was out there.”

They both shrugged, already moving on. Mark cracked another beer. Yves tossed another log onto the fire.

But I couldn’t shake it.

That night I barely slept. There was something wrong with the silence;  it wasn’t empty. It felt full, bloated, like the woods were *holding their breath*. Around 2 a.m., I heard something just outside my tent. Leaves crunching, softly. Not animals. Footsteps. Careful ones.

Then a whisper.

My voice.

***“It’s watching you.”***

I didn’t breathe. Didn’t move. The whisper came again, only this time from inside the tent:

**“Don’t tell them.”**

I sat up with a start, fumbling for my flashlight. Nothing. No one. Just the nylon walls and my pounding heart. When I finally fell asleep, I dreamed of my mouth opening and sound pouring out, but not my own words. Just… noises. *Me* speaking, but not *me*.

The next morning, *Yves was gone.*

At first, we thought he went for a walk. He did that sometimes disappeared into the trees with nothing but a thermos and his smug sense of self-reliance. But as hours passed, worry turned to dread.

We searched. No trail. No broken branches. No footprints near the stream. Just his sleeping bag, still zipped, like he vanished mid-thought.

Mark didn’t talk much that day. Neither did I. We just sat near the fire pit, watching the forest lean in closer.

That night, I didn’t shout. I didn’t laugh. I barely said a word.

But the echo came anyway.

Soft at first like it didn’t want the others to hear. Like it was speaking just for me.

“I’m still here,” it whispered from the trees.

“I know you.”  
  


I didn’t sleep. Couldn’t. I just sat there, spine aching, eyes fixed on the dying fire. Watching the shadows twitch across Mark’s face as he dozed near the flames. Mark was tense. Too tense.

He paced the edge of the campsite like a caged thing, muttering and swearing under his breath while I quietly stuffed my gear into my bag.

“I’m going to find Yves,” I said, breaking the silence.

Mark stopped pacing. “What?”

“I said, I’m going to look for him.”

Mark scoffed and kicked at the firepit, scattering half-burnt wood. “He probably wandered off or pitched his tent somewhere else. That asshole does this kind of thing all the time.”

“No,” I said, standing up. “Not like this. Not without saying something.”

Mark’s mouth twitched. “You’re wasting time. We should hike back to the car, get help. Real help. Not this ‘hero complex’ bullshit you keep pulling.”

I narrowed my eyes. “Why are you so eager to leave?”

“Because *this place isn’t right,* Zulfi! That’s why!” he snapped, voice rising suddenly. “I haven’t slept. You’ve been staring at me like I’ve got three heads. And Yves? He’s probably already back in town, laughing his ass off. I say we get the fuck out.”

I zipped my pack, heart pounding. “I’m not leaving him.”

Mark glared at me, nostrils flaring. “Suit yourself.”

We didn’t speak after that. Just packed up in a sharp silence, the kind that makes every snap of a twig sound too loud.

We picked up the trail that led back down the ridge toward the lake. The sky was overcast, heavy with gray clouds. No birdsong. Just the crunch of our boots and the occasional sigh of wind moving through branches like a warning.

We reached the edge of the lake about an hour later.

It was beautiful in that haunting way; the water perfectly still, the surface like polished stone.

Mountains loomed behind it, draped in a quiet gloom, as if the world itself had gone solemn.

And then we heard it.

A voice. Faint, high, feminine. Carrying across the water like smoke.

*“Help… me…”*

We both stopped.

Mark turned to me slowly. “You heard that, right?”

I nodded. My skin crawled.

Then it came again closer now, but still far too thin, as if it were coming through a long, wet tunnel.

“Please… someone... help me…”

I scanned the lake, eyes darting. There was movement a ripple just beneath the surface.

But nothing emerged.

Then *slap.*

A sound from behind us. Wet. Heavy. Like a soaked cloth being thrown against a stone wall.

We spun around, but there was nothing there. Just trees. Damp, silent trees.

I whispered, “We need to move.”

Mark whispered back, “Yeah, I think—”

But something was wrong.

His whisper came back too soon.

Too clear.

*“—we need to move.”*

My voice. Whispered. Again.

We looked at each other, frozen.

Then my whisper came back again.

*“—we need to move… we need to move… we need to move…”*

Layered now. Overlapping. Not echoing, but repeating. Too perfectly. Too intentionally.

Mark grabbed my arm. “Go.”

We started running. And somewhere behind us, in that dark tangle of trees, our whispers kept speaking even though we weren’t.

We ran until our legs gave out through wet underbrush, over tangled roots, blindly ducking low-hanging branches that clawed at our faces and jackets. The forest didn’t feel like forest anymore. It felt like a maze. And every step we took felt... *observed*.

The echoes had stopped repeating by the time we reached a clearing a narrow break in the trees where the sky peeked through like a dying eye.

We stopped to catch our breath. Mark’s hands were shaking. Mine too.

Then, without a word, he pointed to the left trail and started walking.

“Mark, wait,” I called.

But he didn’t stop. Didn’t even look back.

I followed for a few minutes, stumbling through muck, my eyes locked on the back of his jacket. Then the trees shifted. I rounded a bend and he was gone.

Just... gone.

“Mark?” I shouted.

The trees swallowed his name.

“*Mark!*”

Only silence.

Or so I thought……until the whispers began again.

But these weren’t mine. Not anymore.

“Zulfi…”

The voice was thin, broken…..Yves.

“*Zulfi… it’s cold. I’m cold…”*

I turned on my heel, scanning the trees. “Yves?! Where are you?!”

*“Down here*,” he whispered. “*The water’s cold down here.”*

“No, no, no…..come out,” I said, voice trembling. “Come to me, don’t…don’t stay in the water.”

There was no reply.

Hours passed. Maybe more. I walked in circles, tried retracing my steps, but the forest never looked the same twice. At some point, I found an old firepit. Ours. The stones we’d placed. The tin can Yves had used for chili was still there, warped and blackened.

That was the first time I realized I wasn’t walking through the woods.

I was walking through *memories of it*.

As night fell again, I pressed myself against a tree, trying not to cry, trying not to breathe too loudly. The shadows moved differently now. They didn’t flicker they *watched*. I could feel it.

And then again….a voice.

But this time, it wasn’t Yves.

*“Zulfi,*” Mark said, softly. Just over my shoulder.

I turned.

No one.

“Come back,” he said. “*Closer.”*

I ran. I ran until my legs burned, until blisters broke and I tasted iron in my mouth. And then... something changed.

The trees thinned.

The air shifted.

A bird cried overhead, high and normal.

I stumbled into a field.

A road.

A *real* road.

And just like that it felt like the forest let me go.

Like it *decided* it had had enough.

It took me two days to get home. I must’ve looked half-dead when I walked into town. People stared, but no one said anything.

I tried explaining to the police. I told them about Yves. About Mark.

They asked for last names. I gave them. They asked for photos. I had them.

Or I thought I did.

The pictures on my phone the ones of all three of us standing beside the lake, the ones from the campfire *gone*. Only selfies remained. Me, alone.

They searched the ridge.

*Nothing.*

No tents. No gear. No footprints but mine.

It was as if Mark and Yves had never existed.

I called mutual friends. Some remembered vague mentions—“Didn’t you go on a trip?”—but no one could place Mark. Or Yves.

No one remembered them.

No one believed me.

That’s why I’m writing this. Not for sympathy. Not for justice.

But in case someone else hears voices from the lake. In case someone else is told by their friend that the tent is too quiet. In case they whisper—and their own whisper whispers back.

I’m writing this to *make sense* of it. Or try to.

I’m writing this because I need someone to believe me.

Please.

Tell me you remember them too.

*Tell me I’m not the only one.*
