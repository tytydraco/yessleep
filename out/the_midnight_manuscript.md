When the email from "The Hollow Archivist" landed in my inbox, I dismissed it as spam. Most writing commissions I receive are either laughably low-paying or scams. This one, however, offered $500 for a short story between 3,000-5,000 words.

I was skeptical until I read further:

>

Attached was a contract filled with legalese that essentially boiled down to: “We own your story, you get paid, end of transaction.”

I almost ignored it. But $500 was tempting, especially for something so short. I’ve done ghostwriting before, and this seemed no different—except for one odd requirement: all stories had to be written in a shared Google doc owned by them.

Curiosity won out. After signing and submitting the contract, I received the first prompt.

Predictable, cliché, easy. I could churn out something like that in a few hours. But the email contained a second document:

**RULES FOR WRITING:**

1. You may only write between 12:00 AM and 3:00 AM.
2. Before writing, check your mirrors for any abnormalities.
3. Keep a candle lit in your workspace while you write.
4. Do not leave your workspace while the document is open.
5. If you do not finish the story in one session, you must end by typing: “Archivist, hold the tale. I will return.”
6. When finished, type: “Archivist, take the tale,” and extinguish the candle.

At first, I thought this was some immersive, gimmicky roleplay. Maybe the “Archivist” persona was part of their branding. It was odd, but nothing that would deter me from making $500.

That night, I waited until midnight, lit a candle, and sat down at my desk. I opened the Google doc and began typing.

The story flowed easily at first. There’s something about writing late at night that makes everything feel eerie, so crafting a creepy atmosphere came naturally. The only unsettling moment was when I noticed another cursor in the document. It didn’t type anything, just hovered at the edge of the page.

When I finished the first session at 2:45 AM, I typed the required phrase, “Archivist, hold the tale. I will return,” and closed the laptop. The candle flickered violently as I extinguished it, but I dismissed it as a draft.

The next night, I returned. This time, the other cursor moved sporadically, almost as if it were pacing. My hands shook as I typed, but I finished the story before 3:00 AM. I typed the final phrase, “Archivist, take the tale,” and the text disappeared from the document.

Seconds later, I received an email: $500 had been deposited into my account.

# Prompt #2:

The second prompt arrived immediately:

>

This time, I noticed a new line in the rules:

**7. Do not question the Archivist.**

The rules were growing tiresome, but the money was too good to pass up. I lit the candle and began writing at midnight.

As I typed, the cursor returned. This time, it hovered over specific sentences, highlighting them briefly before moving on. It felt… approving.

At 2:50 AM, I typed the final words and extinguished the candle. The story vanished, payment arrived, and I breathed a sigh of relief.

That’s when I noticed my reflection.

The mirror on the wall across the room showed me sitting at my desk—but the candle was still lit in the reflection.

I froze. Slowly, I turned to look at the desk. The candle was out.

When I looked back at the mirror, the reflection was smiling.

# Prompt #3:

The next prompt was darker:

>

I slammed my laptop shut and emailed The Hollow Archivist, demanding to know what kind of twisted game they were playing. The reply came immediately:

>

That night, I didn’t light a candle. I didn’t check the mirrors. I didn’t follow the rules.

I wrote the story in defiance, fingers trembling as I typed. The cursor appeared again, erratic this time, and the room felt heavier with every word I wrote.

When the clock struck 3:00 AM, I closed the laptop without typing the closing phrase. The candle, still unlit, shattered in its holder.

The email came anyway: **Payment denied.**

# The Final Prompt:

The final prompt arrived the next day.

>

Attached was a photo.

It was of my apartment. My desk. The shattered candle.

Panic consumed me. I tried to reply, but the email bounced back. I unplugged my laptop and shoved it into the closet. That night, I didn’t write.

At midnight, the lights in my apartment flickered. The closet door creaked open.

The laptop powered on by itself. The Google doc was open.

A single line was written:

**“Archivist, take the tale.”**

The cursor blinked.

Behind me, I heard the sound of rustling paper, like pages being turned in a massive, unseen book.

And then…

I understood.

The stories weren’t fiction. They were offerings. Sacrifices. Each tale a piece of something larger, something alive, being built word by word.

The Archivist wasn’t collecting stories.

It was collecting us.

When I turned, the reflection in the darkened window wasn’t mine. It was the Archivist. And it was smiling.

I never finished the final story. But as you read this, know that it’s too late for me.

The candle on your desk? The mirror in your room?

Check them.

And if you hear pages turning in the dark, don’t look behind you.
