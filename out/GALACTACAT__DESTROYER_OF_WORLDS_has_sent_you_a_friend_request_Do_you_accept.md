When the world ended it was not with an explosion or with a flood.  There was no fire and no brimstone.    
  
Instead, a single white cat, much larger than the sky, appeared out of nowhere.  It sat upon reality and took a nap, from which no one could escape.    
  
Earth - specifically North America - was swallowed up instantaneously by the butthole of the titanic feline.  Thus, the last thing which anyone saw was a wrinkled, inverse starfish headed in their direction, growing larger until the ridges could swallow a city.  
  
The cat, tired as it was, barely noticed this intrusion, and promptly fell asleep.  
  
This would have been the end for everyone - and a smelly end at that - if not for the fact that inside the great beast was a power far stronger than anything witnessed on Earth.    
  
To say that things changed would be an understatement.  For, within the foul guts of that feline, a metamorphosis occurred.  The Earth and everyone who occupied it was suddenly transformed, as was the place we called home.  
  
Basically we all transformed into light energy, with no further need for food, air, or water.  Although there are still a few Starbucks, no one quite knows how that happened.

Reinfeld: That's the whole point!  There's SUPPOSED to be a horse in the bathroom!  Now what am I gonna use for material on the Tonight Show?  You killed my horse!  
  
Porridge: To be honest, Gary, you're not going on The Tonight Show.  This is all a hallucination.  You're in a mental institution right now.

Reinfeld: No, Tamer!  You still have my spatula I lent you last week, now get out!  I've got a lady over!  
  
Porridge: I'm not a lady, Gary.  I'm a frying pan you glued a pair of googly eyes onto.  And once again, this is all in your mind.  You're in Bellevue, good buddy.  
  
Tamer: Oh shit, looks like Rufus is out of his cage again…

"And he's done it!  The world record for how many keys you can insert in your anus has been SHATTERED!  ABSOLUTELY OBLITERATED!"  
  
"That's right, Jack.  Let's go down to the field where Ruth is standing with our winner.  What's he saying, Ruth?  Are those keys puncturing his insides yet?"  
  
"Most definitely, Bob.  I'm standing here with Flinty McDreglocks, the new world champion of rectal key insertion.  His whole face is turning white and I believe I see a small puddle of blood forming around the base of his shoes.  What do you say, Flinty?  You just achieved a world record!  What are you gonna do now?"  
  
"Hospital…"  
  
\*Flinty McDreglocks collapses face-first on the ground with a loud crunch that is probably his nose breaking\*

Narrator: …and so, the wild Fuckalope moves on.  He has exhausted all natural resources on this planet, and now he must find a new home.  After boarding his interstellar spacecraft, the Fuckalope settles in for a deep sleep, engaging the cryogenic unit with a majestic tap of his antlers against the control panel.  He has had a long day, and will require four to six centuries of sleep.  Fortunately for him, the nearest habitable planet is-

Announcer: Today on "Love it or Lose it" we travel to Eastern Pennsylvania, where the Bucktooth sisters are trying to decide if they should upgrade from their current, mid-sized dam, or whether it makes sense to stick with their hovel and make it work with a few renovations.  But Raymond and Sarah are gonna have their hands full with this quirky couple, as neither one of them understands English, and they're beavers!  Let's check in with the crew and see how things are going.  
  
Raymond:  Are you sure this is safe? I feel like we should have an animal expert with us.  
  
Producer (whispering): It's perfectly safe. Just go!   
  
Raymond: Hey folks, guess what!? You've been chosen for a home-

"There's nothing on tonight, honey. I'm going to bed. Long day tomorrow."  
  
"You work so hard," the giant white female cat said to the one sitting on the universe. "I love you."  
  
"I love you too," he said, on his way up the stairs.  
  
As the great cat settled into his bed, he let out a small, silent fart. And with it, all of creation was obliterated in an instant.   
  
Then he pulled out his phone and started looking at cat porn.
