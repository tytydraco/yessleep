\[Part 1\]

I woke up startled at the sight of the bright daylight. I looked around, not moving my tired head, and saw many empty rows of hospital beds.



I tried sitting up to see if I was all alone in the room. However, it felt like pushing a car forward as I couldn't move.



I started moving my hand towards the railing to grip onto, but suddenly, a red alert popped up on a screen next to the railing.



It read, "Movement Detected."



My heart pounded. Why would a hospital need a movement detector? The beeping noise from the monitor grew louder, sending sharp pangs through my skull.



Suddenly, heavy footsteps echoed through the hall. The metal door screeched open, the sound stabbing through my ears like a knife. I winced and shut my eyes, trying to endure the pain.



"Good evening, patient 5629," a deep voice greeted me. I opened my eyes and saw a man in a long white coat standing at the foot of my bed.



He had hollow eyes and a ***thin, unsettling*** smile. His name tag read "**Dr. Phil**."



"How are you feeling?" His voice was calm, almost too calm.



I swallowed, my throat dry. "I… I don’t feel well."



Dr. Phil gave a slow nod. "That is to be expected. You were in a terrible accident and have been in a coma for two years.



Your muscles are weak, and your nerves have become extremely sensitive to high-pitched sounds. But don’t worry...we’ll help you recover."



*We???? Who is we? I only saw Dr. Phil. There are no other doctors, nurses, or any assistants next to him.*



*On another thought... Two years? My head spun. That wasn’t possible… right?*



Dr. Phil stepped closer, placing a small tray on the table beside me. The tray was similar to a tray you would receive in prison which was disgusting. On it were a plate of bland-looking food and a cup filled with white pills.



"Eat. This will help with your recovery."



I hesitated but reached for the pills. As I lifted one to my lips, an itch crawled along my cheek. I instinctively tried to scratch it but felt something unfamiliar on my skin. 



**Something wrong.**



"Do you have a mirror?" I asked.



Dr. Phil's expression darkened slightly. "No need for that. Just focus on eating."



A heavy unease settled in my stomach, but I swallowed the pills, feeling their bitter taste linger in my mouth.



Days passed in an eerie monotony. Every morning, I forced myself to do simple exercises to regain my strength.



Dr. Phil visited at *precise times,* his presence unnervingly consistent. He always smiled, but his eyes never did.



He always kept that gloomy look in his eyes. It was as if the eyes had no iris. Almost emotionless...



The room remained silent, save for the hum of the monitors. I never saw nurses or other doctors, only him.



Meals were delivered through a slot in the door, and the only sounds I heard were distant, echoing footsteps and the occasional, chilling screech of metal doors opening somewhere in the facility.



I kept my mind occupied, memorizing every detail of my surroundings: the ceiling lights flickered once every ten minutes, the security monitor refreshed with a glitchy static, and the air smelled of antiseptic with a faint undercurrent of decay.



Occasionally, I would hear muffled whispers from the hallway. Once, I thought I heard someone crying. Another time, a gurgling sound that made my stomach twist.



But every time I asked Dr. Phil about them, he would simply tilt his head and smile. "You’re imagining things, Patient 5629."



A week later, I could finally stand on my own. My legs trembled, but I felt a rush of excitement. I was getting better.



Yet, the silence of the hospital haunted me.



One night, a sudden, deafening crash shattered the quiet. My ears rang painfully, and I collapsed onto the cold floor.



The sound had come from outside my room.



Ignoring the throbbing in my head, I pushed open the door and peered down the dimly lit hallway. A flickering light revealed an emergency staircase ahead.



I crawled towards it, my body screaming in protest. The stairs leading up were locked. With no other choice, I descended into the basement.



The air grew colder. The walls were rough, resembling those of a dungeon rather than a hospital.



A heavy metal door stood at the end of the hall. Peering through the small window, I felt my breath hitch.



Rows of cells lined the walls, each containing twisted, mutilated figures. A man sat in one corner, his empty eye sockets staring blankly, his own eyes shoved into his mouth.



Another patient lay against the bars, his limbs swapped. Arms where his legs should be, legs where his arms should be. The sight sent bile rising in my throat. 



They were all looking at me. Staring into my soul like they depended on it. They had hungry expressions. I shivered as one was drooling.



Outside each cell, a label read "Patient #" followed by a number. My trembling hand reached for a nearby shelf where stacks of folders sat.



I grabbed one at random, folded a page, and shoved it into my pocket.



I crawled further down the corridor. The numbers decreased, 5600, 5599, 5598. Then I reached a series of empty cells, yet each bore a sticker.



My heart pounded as a chilling realization hit me.



I was next.



Adrenaline surged through my veins. I forced myself to my feet, stumbling back towards the stairs.

My hands shook as I reached for the handle but it wouldn’t budge. The door was locked.

A slow, deliberate clap echoed through the hallway.

I turned, my blood running cold.



Dr. Phil stood there, his usual unsettling smile now stretched wider. "Going somewhere, Patient 5629?"



Panic seized me. I backed away, but he lunged forward, grabbing my arm with an iron grip.



"You shouldn't have come here," he murmured.



He dragged me into a hidden room. A single, rusted operating table stood in the center, its surface stained with old blood. 

Rusted scalpels and syringes lined the walls. The air reeked of decay.

"Lie down," Dr. Phil ordered. "Or I'll make you."



Trembling, I obeyed. My mind screamed for escape, but my body was too weak.



Dr. Phil held up a syringe filled with a thick, yellow liquid. "This will help you sleep."

Before I could react, he stabbed the needle into my arm. A burning sensation spread through my veins.

Darkness swallowed me whole.

I woke up in my hospital bed, gasping for air.

Had it been a nightmare? No. My body ached, and the back of my neck stung sharply.

Shaking, I reached for my back pocket. The folded paper was still there.



I wasn't crazy. It was real.



I took a deep breath, willing my mind to stay clear. Something felt different now. The movement detector was gone.

The security monitor wasn’t blinking. Even the distant footsteps that had haunted me every night were absent.

Something had changed.

And then, I felt it. A sharp, stinging pain at the back of my neck. Like something embedded inside me.

I froze, my heart hammering against my ribs.

They had done something to me.

And they weren’t going to let me go.

But still after all that, I see Dr. Phil as a great person.
