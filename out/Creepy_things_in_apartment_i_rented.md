Hello! 

Just wanted to share few real stories that happened to me in 2021. I didn’t take a closer attention to those stories, but as now i processed this experience i feel like i had contact with something outworldly.

English is not first language, sorry for possible mistakes, lol.

Also, i want for you to know, that i an atheist, i don’t give a fuck about supernatural stuff and superstition things. 

So, i was 25 and just moved to the biggest city of my country (geographically i’m from eastern europe)

My friend gave me a contact of her friend, saying that she has a free room to rent in a decent neighbourhood for a decent price.

The girl was nice, the apartment was great, that was only 30 mins to cousin’s house so i accept that offer and i moved in.

As i said the girl was great, we smoked weed sometimes, baked some cakes, sometimes going out to eat so i can say we became great buds.

One day i asked her in funny way if there’s any ghosts in this place, and she said “no, my mum picked the new apartment where ppl didn’t die”

It seems it’s not necessary to die for ghosts to appear.

The first thing i experienced is the sounds of glass jars rolling (???) on the hallway’s floor.

Like this sounds happened some nights, sometimes this shit was quite. I asked the girl if it’s okay, and she said something about “mistakes during building and thin walls, so we can see hear everything”

Also we were storing some glass bottles for recycling on the floor, but i didn’t connected it with noises. How can they roll by themselves?

The second thing scared shit out of me.
I was home after my cafe shift and came home, ate smth and started to listen some music on my laptop. 

The music is changing, 5 secs between songs and i hear banging sounds in my room
door. Like literally someone was loudly knocking on my door. I shut down the music (maybe that’s too late, ppl are sleeping and it can be a problem) and went to the door to open it. Nothing.

Dark hallway, me, and the feeling that someone is looking at me.

Okay maybe that was my landlord girl, so i went to her door and knocked. Complete silence. I opened it a bit, the pink lamp was on and she was obviously sleeping (that was 2am)

I came back to my room. Closed the door, shut down my laptop and went to the bed. What the actual fuck?

Then all this weird shit stopped, except for feeling of presence and that someone look at my back from the third empty room of the house.

Okay, a month passed, i forgot all of that happened and was just living my life.

Another summer night after a long break the sounds of bottles or jars continued.
That lasted for an hour and i was already pissed. I opened the door, turned on the light on my phone and started to look what the fuck happened.

The jar (must be one from recycle that were on the floor) was rolling on the floor. Then feeling of presence and then voice saying my name. Not just voice, but whispering and i don’t wanna know what that shit is. It felt more like a radio record, but more clear and right in my year (from the side of the third empty room).

I want you to believe it’s not made up, i can feel those goosebumps right now while writing this story.

The last thing that happened to me in this place made me change my mind about all of these ghost stories. Some of them can be true as i experienced this shit myself.

So the last thing was the end of all creepy stuff, but it was most terrifying. 

My flatmate/friend/landlord went to her countryside house with her mom and i've been there alone for the few days. 

That was a normal night, except for stuff
like botte-rolling sounds and presence feeling.

I got used it, but in my own room i felt safe
and nothing bad never happened there. 

I wanted to pee so bad, but the noises got louder, and i was so scared. I'm alone and this buddy is decided to fully annoy me.

I stayed in my room for about 30 mins more, and said out loud “i’m not affraid if you stupid ghost” (i was so affraid and i lied to
myself to be more brave)

I opened the door, went to hallway (feeling of presence is everywhere in the hallway, it’s so cold even if it’s summer) and ran to a light switcher. When i clicked it the lamp exploded. Not just turned off, but exploded into pieces. 

I ran back to my room, locked the door and stayed there until morning. Those episodes showed me that there is something that beyond of our understanding or just exists in the different world.


Also then my flatmate/landlady said that her dad passed away and she with her mom are in the legal process currently against his second wife about this dead guy money, lol.

What do you think, did i just went mad or i really experienced some supernatural stuff?

Also i have few more creepy stories from that place but from other ppl who lived there as well, and ofc i believe them. I can share their stories if you want, guys. 

Cheers!
