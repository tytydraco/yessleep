Five or six years ago, I had a really strange encounter as a teen that I have never been able to explain or make sense of. If anyone has any reasonable explanations for this story please comment below. 

Background: 

This story takes place in Raleigh, North Carolina. There is a nature reserve area near my old neighborhood that I used to frequent with friends that became our unofficial hang out/smoke spot. The nature reserve is called Schenck forest. The area is owned and managed by NC State University, and is home to some of veterinary school horses. It also operates as a teaching and research site for the university’s forrest management program. The land itself has an interesting history prior to it being utilized for university purposes, as there was a prison farm on the land pre - 1930’s. 

When visiting this area, even prior to this experience, my friends and I always would always joke about how the land had a strange energy/feel to it. In the parking area of the reserve, there was a small graveyard and abandoned house, which certainly further contributes to the interesting vibes. However, I never felt scared or uncomfortable in the space and would often go to the area alone. 


Actual Story: 

One night, I was about to meet up with my friend at the nature reserve park. She was getting off work that night, and I ended up beating her to there. While waiting for her, I parked my car off to the side of the road and turned it around to face the direction in which you would enter the park area. Behind me was the graveyard, and I could see the area decently well in my rear view and left side mirror. It is important to mention that my car was the only car there, and that there were no other humans in sight. The time was just past 7:00 in the middle October and sun was almost completely set and it was starting to getting dark outside. After arriving to the park, I sat in my car for a few minutes on my phone, trying to kill time while waiting for my friend. 

After sitting there for a moment, something caught my eye in the side mirror of my car. In the graveyard area, behind my vehicle. There was a small fire that had started on the ground. My immediate reaction was to get out of the car and to stomp out the flames, and that is exactly what I did. I found it a bit odd that this fire had started seemingly out of no where, but presumed that someone had tossed a cigarette out just before I had arrived. The fire was in an area where there were dry leaves on the ground, so this was a plausible explanation at the time. 

After stomping the small fire out, I got back into my car and continued scrolling on my phone. It was almost completely dark outside at this point and the sun had gone beneath the horizon. Again, something caught my eye in the side mirror of my car. The fire had seemingly reappeared instantaneously. I immediately presumed that I had failed to put out the first time, and got out of my vehicle once again to try to put out the flames. Upon getting out of the car, I quickly realized that this fire was separate from the first one that I had put out. It had started approximately a foot behind where the charred spot was in the leaves from the first fire. After realizing that the ground had spontaneously caught fire not once, but now two times (In a graveyard and at night), I started to get a little creeped out and sped walked back to my car to leave. I didn’t bother putting out the second fire. Just as I put the car into drive, I glanced back into my rear view to witness a third fire spontaneously start just behind the second fire, of which was still burning. This time, I saw the fire begin with my very own eyes. I sped off and left the park, as this whole situation made me quite uncomfortable and confused. 

The next time that I returned to the area after this experience, the ground was still charred in three places, in a perfectly vertical line. This occurrence was not a figment of my imagination or a delusion, and I have never heard of or experienced anything like this in the years after this. Ever since I had this experience, I have been trying to come up with a reasonable explanation for how this could happen but I have been entirely unable to do so. There were no other humans around and with the sun being down, there is no way plausible way that these fires could have just been brush fires started by direct sunlight. 

I’m not religious and do not actively practice spirituality, but I felt like these spontaneous fires were a sign that I was unwelcome there or at least at that time. The entire experience has left me confused for years, and if anyone has a scientific explanation or theory to how this could happen, I would love to hear it. 


Afterstory: 

This doesn’t really pertain to my story but is something that I find to be rather sad and creepy. Two years after I had this experience, there was an execution style murder committed in the exact graveyard where I had this experience. This was very surprising to my community, as we all considered our neighborhood to be very safe and nothing like this had taken place in the area prior. 

As of last year, this land around this nature reserve has become developed (there was previously no developments around the area whatsoever) and the dirt road that I experienced my story on is now paved. The abandoned home on the property has since been demolished, and now there has is a massive office facility that has been constructed next to the reserve. I wanted to include this information as I want to link the parks website for anyone who is interested in this story to reference, as an explanation for how the park is now different than how it was when I had my experience years ago. It used to be more remote and was not nearly as well known by hikers and nature enjoyers prior to the development of the surrounding area. 

I will also link an article about the murder that took place there. 

To conclude, I wanted to mention that myself and others have had other strange experiences at this same site as well, but this experience is the most notable one out of them all. If anyone would like to hear about these other experiences, I would be happy to share. Let me know what you all think.
