I was sitting at the dinner table with my eight year old son, when he told me about it.

"Dad, I know why." He said, his microwave dinner uneaten.

"Why what, Billy?" I said, chewing the last bite of mine.

"Why Danny's parents went away."

I knew what he meant by "went away," but those words didn't exactly do justice to what had really happened. Truth is, just a week earlier, Billy's friend's parents, The McClarrens, left their house, and ended up drowning in a river nearby. Leaving the walls of their apartment marked with the words "Drove she ducklings to the water" and their seven year old son parentless. And the scariest thing of all... police found no evidence of fowl play.

"Oh yeah, and why's that, Billy?"

"Danny typed the prompt three times."

"Prompt?"

"You know, the chatbot. That you ask questions to."

"Yeah, I know what it is, bud. I'm not that old. But why do you think that would make them go away?"

"Cause we were playing a game. Typing the creepiest things we could think of into it, three times each."

"Oh yeah? Well what did Danny type?"

Bobby paused for a moment, before telling me.

"The same thing that was written on his walls. "Drove she ducklings to the water.""

There was a deafening silence, as he then looked to me for my reaction, until...

...I suddenly burst out laughing.

"A chatbot? Really? Come on bud, you know better than that."

"But, Dad-"

"Don't but Dad me. Here, let me show you..."

"Wait-" My son called out.

But it was too late. I'd already pulled the laptop over, that I always kept nearby at dinner, in order to catch up on the day's work emails.

"This is the site, right?" I asked, pointing to the chatbot on the screen, as I began to type the words, "Drove she ducklings to the water..."

"Dad, don't do it!"

Enter.

"Drove she ducklings to the water..."

"Dad! Please, don't!"

Enter.

"Drove she ducklings to the water..."

"Noooo!"

Enter.

The room went quiet, as my son put his hand over his face, and sunk into his chair.

"See? Nothing happened. Everyone's still here. For now anyways." I said, ominously.

"For now?" Bobby replied, a sense of nervousness in his voice.

"Well yeah, cause it's bedtime." I said, my face turning from serious to a smirk, as I got a kick out of the gag.

"What the heck, Dad!"

Then, I picked Bobby up, moved his wheelchair aside, and carried him over to his bedroom on the first floor of the house.

"You know what scares me most about the chatbot?" I asked, as I tucked him in for bed.

"What, dad?" He replied, rolling his eyes.

"You using it to do your homework!" I called out with a smile, as I gave him a great big hug and walked over to the door.

When I looked back, the last thing I saw before turning off the lights was Bobby once again putting his palm over his face, embarrassed by his Dad's lame jokes.

—

The next day, I went about my morning like any other, meticulously flossing and brushing my pearly whites, carefully weighing my coffee beans, and ironing one of my many blue dress shirts, for reasons that didn't quite matter given that I was working from home.

But when I walked over to Bobby's room to wake him up, just as I did every morning, this time... he wasn't there.

*He must be pranking me.* I thought to myself, before scouring the house for wherever he may be hiding...

...But Bobby never revealed himself.

Beginning to get nervous, I then ran outside to check the driveway, front lawn, backyard, and even down the street...

...But no matter where I looked, Bobby was nowhere to be found.

And what made the situation even scarier, was that when I went back to his bedroom, I realized that his wheelchair was still sitting there.

"911." The dispatcher answered, as I frantically raced to sign into the home surveillance app on my computer.

But before I could reply, the previous night's surveillance footage played back... and I dropped my phone.

"911. How can we help you?"

"Um..." I said, scrambling to pick it back up, while replaying the video. "Sorry, disregard, this was totally an accident."

"No problem, sir."

"Thank you, bye." I said, before dropping to the floor, my eyes wide in disbelief and my mouth wide open, as I still stared up at the computer.

—

"Oh no, what is it, Connor?" My ex wife said with a stern tone, as she stepped out of her house and saw that I was alone.

I simply shrugged my shoulders, unable to find words that could properly explain what I was starting to think had happened. Until I finally conjured a few up. "Tiffany, let's just discuss this in the house."

Fifteen minutes later, we were sitting in her living room, arguing back and forth, like we were married again. It had been one of our most common past times back when we were together, but this conversation... was different.

"I can't believe you lost our child!" She called out.

"Tiff, listen to me! I didn't lose him. It was-" I replied.

"The chatbot? You really expect me to believe that?"

I had been waiting for the right time to show her the footage, but I couldn't delay it any longer.

"Here." I said, as I opened my laptop and pulled up the surveillance video. "See for yourself."

My wife took a seat next to me on the couch, and I hit play.

What proceeded to unfold on screen, was just as horrifying and jaw dropping as the first time I'd seen it.

From a ceiling mounted camera in the living room, the footage revealed my eight year old son, walking out of his room, with no aid from a wheelchair or walking device, writing the words on the walls with chalk, and leaving the house through the front door.

I turned to my wife, who had her hands over her mouth in shock, tears running from her eyes, and couldn't help but begin crying myself.

I reached my arm over to comfort her, and she immediately leaned in, and for the first time in years, we embraced. Sitting there on her couch, both balling our eyes out.

Eventually, our tears slowed, and we separated again.

"No wheelchair?" She asked.

"No wheelchair." I replied.

"But how?"

"I don't know."

"What did he write?"

"The same thing the Mclarrens wrote on their wall. And the same thing their son, Danny, and I, typed in the prompt. "Drove she ducklings to the water.""

"Play it back." She said.

But before I could replay the surveillance footage, I heard my phone buzzing on the table beside me.

I looked at it, to see my neighbor's name "Milton."

"H-Hello? Milton?" I said, unsure of why he'd be calling me.

"Wait what?" I called out, as my ex wife listened to my call. "You did? He's okay? Great, we'll, I mean I'll be there in about twenty minutes. Great, thank you so much."

I hung up the call.

"What is it?" Tiffany asked.

"Milton. He found Bobby. Trying to get into his backyard." I replied.

"What? Why? What's even back there?"

"Just a pool."

—

After Tiffany and I picked up Bobby from our neighbor's place, and brought him home to my house, things just felt... off.

We were relieved to find him and astonished to see him walking around on his own, unaided by his wheelchair, but at the same time deeply disturbed that he wasn't talking, in a trancelike state, and repeatedly making attempts to draw on the walls and leave the house.

"I don't feel good." Tiffany said.

"I don't either." I replied.

"No, I don't feel well. Like something is wrong. I feel… different." She continued.

But I was too busy staring at my laptop to think anything of it,

"I think I found something." I said.

"What do you mean?" She asked.

"Well, I did some searching, about the drownings, and the chatbot. Turns out there was an employee, a prompt engineer, that worked for the company, whose parents drowned."

"What? Like the Mclarrens?"

"Yeah but even weirder. The guy killed himself after he heard the news of their deaths."

"That must have been where it started. But how?"

"I don't know, but I found his address in his obituary information. I'm gonna head into the city and see if anyone still lives there."

"Okay. What should I do?"

"I need you to watch him. I'll be back as fast as I can."

—

KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK.

I had been knocking at the engineer's door for what must have been twenty minutes, in hopes that some sort of partner or relative would be there to answer my questions, but I should have known better. From what I know about the prompt, it made all loved ones go away.

And when I finally gave up, resolving to head back, his neighbor popped out of the next apartment.

"Hey, what are you knocking for?" An old man said, "Tenant died a little while back."

"Died? Did you know him?" I asked, jumping on any clue I could find.

"Who's asking?"

"An old friend. From college. He stopped answering my calls one day, and I thought I'd stop by to check in on him."

"Well, no need for that. Like I said, your friend's dead."

At that moment, I felt like I'd hit a dead end. Not knowing what else to do, I tried my best attempt at feigning sadness, staring down at the ground, before starting to walk away.

"Wait!" The old man stopped me.

Somehow, my plan had worked.

"Want to come inside?"

—

Despite the fact that it was now evening, I felt obliged to accept the coffee that he had prepared for me, with two cream and two sugar packets. And despite the fact that I didn't usually drink drip coffee, I kept the acting going.

"Thing is, Ryan, and the circumstances surrounding his death. It's all gonna sound a bit... far fetched."

"Try me. I'd believe  just about anything these days." This time I was serious.

"Well that's the thing. Ryan confided in me about what happened, 'cause no one else would believe him."

"Okay."

"Well you know his family died right? Drowned in a river."

"Yeah?"

"Well, as you also know, Ryan was an engineer for that chatboy company. Turns out, he had typed something into it the week before his family died..."

"Go on."

"...That he was pretty convinced caused what happened."

"Typing into a chatbot caused his family to drown?"

"Or so he thought. I tried to tell him otherwise, but the loss, and circumstances surrounding it, drove him mad. He started writing the prompt on the walls, and I'd often hear him cursing the  chatbot, until..."

"Until?"

"Oh, that's right. You don't know. Ryan killed himself a couple weeks later."

I didn't know how to react, so I simply hung my head in.

"Sorry for your loss," The man replied, before standing up, "Anyways, if you'll excuse me, I gotta use the bathroom. Feel free to help yourself to more coffee."

But after he left the room, rather than accept his offer, I instead seized the opportunity to run to the window, pop it open, crawl into the fire escape, and close the window behind me.

—

A couple minutes later, I was crawling into Ryan's apartment from the fire escape and, once again, closing the window behind me.

His place was quite dark, but rather than switch on a light, I opted to find my way around by the light of my cell phone, its brightness turned all the way up, so as to not draw any unwanted attention.

And when I illuminated Ryan's apartment, I immediately recognized something I was all too familiar with...

...The words "Drove she ducklings to the water" written all over his living room walls.

After some rummaging around, I eventually moved to his bedroom and discovered a journal, containing what appeared to be his last thoughts before the suicide. In it were written the words, "Drove she ducklings to the water" but also the words "Oh my darling."

That's new, I thought to myself, before closing the journal, folding it behind my belt, and exiting through Ryan's front door.

—

I had been so concerned with finding a clue, and keeping a low profile while doing so, that by the time I got back to my car, I had almost entirely forgotten about my ex wife and son.

*Tiff should be putting Bobby to bed by now.* I thought to myself. *I hope she locks the door.*

But when I checked the surveillance camera on my phone, I was terrified to discover...

...Not only was my ex wife not putting my son to bed, she was instead leading him out of the apartment.

*At this hour?* I wondered.

That's when it hit me, and I pulled up a video file from earlier in the night.

Sure enough, there was Tiffany, standing in the center of the living room, writing "Drove she ducklings to the water" on the walls, while my son pulled at the door, repeatedly attempting to let himself out of the locked apartment.

Luckily years back, before the divorce, like I believe most couples do, or should, we had shared our locations on our phone, just in case anything happened. And luckily, over all those years, I had never had to use it...

...Until now.

*Where is she taking him to?* I thought to myself, as I followed Tiffany's location, before seeing the bay closeby on the map, and remembering where Ryan's parents died, and Bobby had seemed to be drawn to.

I threw my car in reverse, backed out of the parking lot behind Ryan's apartment, and sped off down the street.

—

Not long after, I spotted Tiffany's car parked at the base of anearby bridge and pulled up beside her, my own car's tires screeching to a halt.

But when I hopped out and looked inside it...

...My wife and son were gone.

I looked out into the distance, squinting, trying to find them in the darkness.

And sure enough, under the moonlight, I saw two figures, illuminated by the moonlight, heading straight for the water at the foot of the bridge.

I sprinted in their direction as fast as I could, but quickly realized that I was too far behind. I then saw them enter in the water and slowly wade in, as their silhouettes submerged deeper and deeper into it.

Not knowing what else to do, I stopped in my tracks, huffing and puffing, and scrambled to pull out my phone and the journal.

I then opened up the chatbot and, referencing the new strings of words I'd found in the engineer's notebook, "Oh my darling," I typed them in the chatbot.

"Oh my darling."

Enter.

"Oh my darling."

Enter.

"Oh my darling."

Enter.

Unsure of whether it had worked, I ran over to the water, still out of breath. I dove in, and swam over to my wife, who was looking back at me, confused, as if she had woken up from a nightmare.

"Connor?" She said.

"Tiffany." I replied.

But before I could even begin to tell to her what had happened, I heard the sound of my son, struggling to keep his head above the water, and swamp over to help...

...Just barely catching him before he completely sunk into the bay.

"Dad?" He coughed, his dazed state, almost identical to that of my ex wife's.

"Hey, bud." I replied, leading him over to more shallow water and setting him back on his feet.

"What am I doing here?" He asked.

I paused for a moment, unsure of how to explain everything to my son, before I recalled the last conversation that we'd had.

"Remember when I told you that what scares me most about the chatbot was using it to do your homework?" I asked.

"Yeah?" He replied.

"I was wrong." I said with a smile, before guiding him and Tiffany back to the shore.

—

Just a week later, we were a family again, all three of us living together at my house, under one roof, reunited again after years of divorce and a tragic event that we were still working to put behind us.

"Hey, bud?" I said, knocking at the door to Bobby's bedroom.

"Come in!" He replied.

I opened the door and stepped in, gesturing for my wife to enter first.

"What are you still doing up?" Tiffany asked.

"Just playing on my phone." He said, without looking up.

Tiffany and I both looked at each other, wide eyed, before we both ran over, and I snatched his phone out of his hand.

Together, my wife and I both looked down at it, fearing we'd see the chatbot, but when we looked at his screen...

...He was just playing a word game.

"What did we tell you about using your phone late at night?" Tiffany said, with a serious look on her face, as she put his phone in her pocket.

"Sorry mom." My son called out.

"It's okay, Bobby." My wife replied.

"Goodnight, bud." I added.

"Goodnight, Mom and Dad." Bobby said.

Tiffany and I then turned off the light, and shut the door to Bobby's bedroom.

We looked at each other and both let out a huge sigh, before laughing it off.

"A little TV before bed?" I proposed.

"Why not?" Tiffany replied, as we both went upstairs to retire for the night.

"That was a close call." I said to my wife.

But when we stepped into the bedroom, we found something much more terrifying on the TV screen.

A journalist, reporting live from the scene with a breaking news story, its chyron reading, "Family drowns in harbor, boat recovered."

Tiffany and I both looked at each other, our eyes wide in horror.

CLICK.

I turned off the TV.
