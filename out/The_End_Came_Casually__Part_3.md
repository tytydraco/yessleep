Woke up on a Tuesday and everything was wrong.

At first, I thought it was just me. Maybe I was having a stroke. Maybe I’d hit my head in my sleep. But then I rolled out of bed and hit the ceiling, which wasn’t the ceiling anymore—it was just a direction.

I hung there for a second, my brain doing whatever the opposite of processing is. Then I fell again. Sideways, this time. Then up. Then in a direction that shouldn’t exist, like some cruel god had invented a new axis just to mess with me.

I landed in my bathroom sink. The faucet sighed audibly.

I tried to stand, but my legs had other plans. One of them bent forward, one bent backward, and neither of those were things they were supposed to do.

“Okay,” I whispered. “Cool. Normal. Love this for me.”

I crawled to the window and looked outside.

Bad idea.

The street had turned into an ocean of static, and floating chunks of sidewalk drifted like icebergs. A man stood on one of them, making a peanut butter sandwich that kept changing ingredients every time he blinked.

Buildings flickered between dimensions. Some were upside-down. Some were perfectly fine. One was on fire but the flames were cold.

In the distance, the sky was loading, like a bad internet connection. Half of it was still the normal blue I remembered, but the other half was just a placeholder image of a sky, complete with watermarks.

The laws of reality weren’t just broken. They had quit entirely.

Behind me, something cleared its throat.

I turned around, and there, sitting on my bed like this was any other day, was a golden retriever.

He wagged his tail. “Mornin’.”

I stared.

He licked his paw. “You look confused.”

I continued staring.

He tilted his head. “Y’know, most people would’ve said something by now.”

I made a noise. Not words. Just a noise.

He sighed. “Fine. I’ll start. Name’s Toby. Everything’s fucked. We should probably leave before things get extra fucked. Any questions?”

I blinked. “You’re a dog.”

“Excellent observation, genius. Wanna try for a second sentence?”

I rubbed my temples, which felt fuzzy, like my brain was being auto-corrected in real time.

“What is happening?”

Toby hopped off the bed and stretched. His back elongated three extra feet, then snapped back like nothing had happened.

“Short version? Reality is having a meltdown. Long version? Reality is having a meltdown, and you’re in it.”

“Okay. Cool. Great.” I nodded, ignoring the fact that my head was now on a slight time delay. “How do we fix it?”

Toby laughed. “Oh, buddy. We don’t.”

I stared at him. He stared back, tongue hanging out, like this was funny to him.

“Alright,” I said, forcing a deep breath. “Okay. Then what do we do?”

He turned toward my bedroom door and kicked it open telepathically.

“We go shopping.”

Before I could question what that meant, my door swung open to reveal a grocery store, right where my hallway used to be.

Fluorescent lights flickered overhead. Aisles stretched into infinity. Some were perfectly normal. Others were… not. One was stocked with bottled screams. Another had cans of pure regret, labeled Now With 20% More!

“Yeah, no, I don’t think I want to go in there,” I muttered.

Toby grinned, his teeth multiplying in real time. “Too bad, buddy. We need supplies.”

I took a step backward. The floor disagreed with me.

Then everything tilted, and I was falling forward, straight into the unnatural void of consumerism.

The last thing I saw before I hit the linoleum was a sign that read:

“BUY ONE, GET A FREE MEMORY OF A CHILDHOOD YOU NEVER HAD!”

Then I hit the ground, and the world rearranged itself around me.
