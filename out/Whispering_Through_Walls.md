It's the start of my college semester and I've been staying with this kid named Elijah. I shouldn't say "kid" he's a year older than me. He seemed like a pretty normal dude. He said he was a Christian, which I had no problem with. He never pushed his religion onto me either. Which I appreciate and respected. In turn I would say grace at the table if/when we had shared meals. Overall, not a bad roommate. 

However, during the winter break of my semester, I shifted restlessly in my bed, eyes darting to the glowing numbers of the my clock; 3:07 am... *I would have rathered stayed awake until 3am, not wake up at 3am.* I just laid there hoping sleep would seep into my bones once again. It never did. The walls seemed to hold their breath, listening to the soft whispers from the other room. Elijah. I rolled onto my side, covering my head with my pillow trying to drown out the deafing silence of the night paired with his eerie hummed choir songs. He usually recieted Bible verses or random prayers, but the hummed songs were rare and always unsettling.

Anxiety clawed so harshly at my stomach that night that I thought I was gonna be sick. The unease palpable in the air. Every night, that damn psycho returned from who-knew-where, trailing dirt and whispering cryptic prayers. It's grown to be annoying more than anything. It had been weeks since I had a solid sleep because of his damn whispering.

*Hell, I don't even know how I got myself in this situation in the first place. Sure, I am a broke college student and desperately needed a place to stay... Beggers can't be choserers, right?*

As of lately, he's brought back mud-streaked objects–dyed feathers, crude wooden crosses, and damp, torn pages from a Bible–seemed to multiply every time I saw the collection. Sunrise brought no answers, only more questions. I never asked about it. Some people have odd hobbies and its not like he was hurting anyone.

I further resisted the urge to confront Elijah. I was worried of what might unravel if I was to confront him. The thought lingered; what was he really doing with all those things?

But the curiosity sank it's lengthly claws into the deepest folds of my brain. The lack of answers for my unspoken questions became overwhelming as it finally consumed me.

One evening I decided to stay awake, keeping an ear out for the telltale, scuffing of feet. Slowly, and albeit, cautiously, I crept towards the door of my room, separating my room from the rest of the house. My heart raced as I cracked the door open and peered into the dim-lot room, the shadows caused by a single flickering light, a candle. My roommate, Elijah, kneeled among his bizarre collection, murmuring verses with frantic intensity. His eyes wide with a fervor that froze me in my place.

I cleared my throat softly, enough to break the spell without startling. My curiosity breaking through the confinments of my unease.

"What are you doing?" I asked, voice hushed in the oppressive quiet.

Elijah met my eyes, an otherworldly calmness in his gaze, followed by an uncomfortably long pause.

"Bridging heaven and earth," he replied as if it explained everything.

I hesitantly stepped out of my room, crossing the threshold into the sanctum of secrets. "Why the stange objects...?" I pressed, eyeing them with a mixture of feacinantion and dread.

Elijah titled his head, as if trying to see a truth I could not. "Tools," he intoned, "to guide the lost and bind the fallen." 

The air felt heavier, charged with something intangible that seemed to vibrate between them. I hesitated, again, unsettled yet intrigued by the cryptic response. "...and who are you guiding? Who do you bind?" I whispered, needing to understand. Craving to understand something of my roommate's bizarre behaviours. *Curse my need to know everything, why did I have to be so nosy?*

Elijah's smile was enigmatic, unfathomable. "Those who waders in the darkness," was all he gave, his fingers trailing over one of the wooden crosses.

I involuntarily shuddered, the words sending a chill skittering down my spine. "What darkness?" I foolishly pressed on, compelled by a mix of terror and morbid curiosity. 

Elijah's eyes gleamed with intensity. "They're around us. Unseen, but near," he breathed, his voice both a chant and a warning. 

I faltered, reeling from the overlapping reality and madness. I wanted to run but my feet remained still as if they had grown rootted into the hardwood floor I stood on. "Are you at least... protecting us?" I ventured, glancing at the ominous items strewn about in the new light.

Elijah nodded, closing his eyes as if in a trance. "In ways you can not imagine," he assured. For some reason that felt anything but reassuring.

Something shifted in the air, cold and breathy, whispering secrets too dark to share. My gaze was drawn to a mud-streaked doll lying among the eerie assemblage. Its eyes glanced under the candlelight, seemingly alive. Trembling, I stepped towards the doll to get a better look, the room pulsing with unseen energy, a force as ancient as it was malevolent. Suddenly, a shadow darted across the wall, not belonging to either of us.

I jerked back, heart hammering against my ribcage like a trapped bird. The shadow twisted unnaturally, bulging and compressing as if testing the limits of this realm. 

"Do you see it now?" Elijah's voice waders a low hum, resonant and grave. 

I nodded, throat dry. I saw it and I wish I didn’t. *Talk about skeptic turned to believer.*

The atmosphere cracked with electricity, thick with the presence of something unseen but unmistakably powerful. 

"What do they want?" I managed, barely above a whisper, feeling the hairs on the nape of my neck rise.

Elijah's eyes remained closed, his hands clapsed in fervent supplication. "They seek what all wanderers desire: salvation," he murmured, the words dripping with an unsettling devotion. 

I swallowed hard, the weight of the revelation pressing down on me. I understood now, at least a fragment of the twisted picture painted by my roommate's bizarre rituals and cryptic utterances. But what price would this salvation demand, and who was truly being saved? 

Suddenly Elijah spoke up, tearing me from my thoughts, "The doorway must open," he confessed, his voice like silken chains, binding yet soft. Desperation clawed at my insides, an avalanche of dread cascading his every thought. *I thought I might lose my dinner.*

"Can't we stop it?" I pleaded, searching the fervent eyes of my roommate for a tace of humanity,  glimmer of redemption. But all I saw was devotion detached from moral understanding.

Elijah shook his head, a resigned sadness flickering briefly before vanishing. "Its not for us to halt," he answered, each word a heavy toll. Outside, the wind howled, echoing the turmoil within mh mind. I felt trapped, a mouse in a twisted divine, machination beyond my control of comprehension.

"What happens when the door opens?" I whispered, dreading the answer but unwilling to escape this macabre dance.

"They come," Elijah replied, eyes distant, seeing horrors that are meant to go unseen.
