It was on an unusually warm Thursday night & I was leaning outside a convenience store, sipping a cold bottle of soda.

I still remember it. Clear as crystal. 

The carbonation made my throat tickle.
I coughed and accidentally dropped the bottle like an idiot.

I bent to pick it up, my gaze towards the concrete, when I saw a pair of red heels walk up to me.

I picked up the bottle and righted myself up.
My gaze continued, following a pair of pale, toned legs connected to said shoes.

A woman stood before me, pretty, dressed & styled for an occasion that seemed to be more than what I earn.

She took the bottle from my hand and tossed it aside, clattering unseen by a dumpster.

She told me that she wanted me to have a good time… A night to die for, and She handed me a folded piece of paper that had an address.

I took the paper from her pale looking hands & before my mind could process what just happened, she slipped into a heavily tinted car & drove off.

I looked at the paper and realised it was a playbill with a ticket slipped inside of it.

It showed an address, a theater downtown, alongside a time for a play.
It was in an hour.

Curiosity had the best of me.
I had to go.
But I wish I didn't

A single ticket to admission & I was ushered into an art-deco lobby lined with humanoid statues & red carpet floorings.
There were stairs leading up to the upper seats it seems, but they were blocked off with a VIP ONLY sign. 

The air was cold & still yet I could hear the faint sound of what seemed to be laughter.
My footsteps were silent in the lobby, muffled by the thick scarlet floor.

There was only one area not cordoned off by dividers; to my right, and to my right were a pair of stylized gold doors that seemed to be an entrance to an ancient temple.

Without hesitation but with a sense of curious indifference, I push it open.

A flurry of things filled my senses.
The sound of ragtime music & laughter filled the air, the scent of popcorn, champagne & what seemed to be this sweet cologne that piqued my sense of smell alongside a strange sense of warmth… 
I walked right in, a few hundred feet from the stage, behind roughly 14 rows of scarlet cushioned seats.

The music & laughter were coming from the stage, it seems like the Play was already ongoing, some sort of cowboy thing.

Some actors dressed as cowboys were fighting with some dirty looking actors dressed like coal miners, they were fighting like something out of a cartoon, with pots, pans, exaggerated punches & fake pop revolvers.

Laughter erupted from both stage & seats, the seats were practically filled too.
People of various ages laughing their heads off at the acts on stage.

I shot glances at the stage and saw the stupidity unfold.
I didn’t find it funny.
But I had nothing to do, so it couldn't hurt to stay.

I found a seat, a few rows closer to the front but still somewhat in the back, just right beside the aisle & beside this guy that looked about my age.

He paid no heed to me save for a courtesy nod. 
He laughed his heart out, occasionally slapping his knee or wiping a tear from his eye.

I looked around, curious at my surroundings.

The audience was packed. 
There was an upper floor as well, a balcony view, and it was covered by a layer of glass & there were people seated behind it.

The people behind it were dressed nicely, from what I could see, suits & the like.

They weren’t laughing at the“play" & they seemed to be looking at Us… 

I felt something twinge in the air and I turned to the exit door, noticing a ticket usher now standing by it, his hands clasped in front of him.

I stood up to get out.
I had to.
A loud noise.
The sound of air splitting. 
The laughter beside me abruptly stopped.

I slowly turn & see the laughing man earlier with a bright red spot on his shirt.
He was dead silent and began to clasp his chest.

He turns to me, raises a silent left hand soaked with blood that looked brown in the lighting & slumped forward, into an ever-growing pool of red. 

A woman screamed nearby.
I stood there, frozen, my sneakers already wet with the dead man’s blood.

My gaze went to the stage and saw that one of the cowboy actors had their prop guns pointed at where the man was seated.
It seemed like it wasn’t a prop, the muzzle still smoked.

And it was now pointed at me.

I drop to the ground, right onto the dead man’s blood & I see someone to my right get hit by the shot.

He falls and screams, and is shot again.

Chaos. Pandemonium. I remember it all.

I scrambled to crawl under the seats, all I could see were people's legs scrambling in every direction.
The sound of gunfire growing in intensity & frequency.

Screams, the sound of wet noises, whizzing bullets embedding itself into the cushions & floor.

I stayed where I was, not knowing how I stayed safe.

I could hear panic, primal fear in the voices of the people around me.

They screamed that the doors were locked and there was no way out.

I heard a voice from the stage point out my location.
I scramble to my feet & run to my left.

My gaze shifted all around me.
I couldn’t help but look.

It was far worse than I could imagine.
Lifeless bodies everywhere, draped on the seats, the floor, on each other, by the sole double door now nearly red.

It seemed to be that some of the audience members were in on this senseless, horrible slaughter as well.
Most of them brandished firearms, others seemed to use knives & machetes.

Everyone was scrambling to escape, others fought. 

I tripped, spun & fell on my back onto a dead woman that was missing her right arm.
I could see the glass covered balcony, the people behind it were nodding, others had a grin.

And before I could process it, someone was upon me, a skinny man with a large knife.

I kept him away, holding him away by pushing at his shoulders as the knife made a beeline for my chest.

I kicked his left ankle.
The knife loosens and he falls onto me, inadvertently falling onto his own weapon & plunging it into his own neck.

I push him off and scrambled to my feet once more as I felt adrenaline pulse through me.

“The boy’s got one! Ease up a bit, he’s a prime contender for Upstairs!" A voice from the stage yelled.

Ignoring the voice, I decided to go back & hopefully rush the exit.

A woman charges me with a machete.
She swings & I am nicked on my left forearm as I raised it to block myself.

She swings again, I fall back, fall on my ass and I begin to crawl backwards. 

My left hand touches something cold.
I quickly turn my head to the left.
A shotgun.

I grab it, instinctively pull back the forearm, point it at my assailant & I pull the trigger.

She flies back, a part of her face evaporates into red mist.

As she falls, just behind a chair, a man points a shiny revolver at me.

I point the shotgun, ready to fire, when a voice erupts from the stage.

“Okay, okay, that’s enough! That is a wrap!” The voice cries out." Love the audience participation, most of them kinda fell flat in the act, hell, there are like 5 of you left, but hey, You five proved yourselves. Let’s give ‘em a hand!"

Applause erupts from the stage.
Still seated on the floor in shock, I notice the man who just spoke was the one who attempted to shoot me earlier.

My hands shook.
I dropped the gun and felt a pain surge across my body. 

He was bowing & gesturing like an actor post Act.
Everyone else clapped their hands, and so did the people upstairs.

The Man stopped his showboating, saw me staring & made his way to me.

He walked over to me and held out a hand.

“Get off your ass. Welcome to the Upstairs."

With a shaky, bloody hand, I took it & he pulled me up to my feet.

That was a year ago.

Now, I'm upstairs.
Behind the glass. 
Seated in a nice silk suit as Gnossie No. 1 plays in the back.

It was Wednesday and the invites were being sent out.

The seats were already being filled.

And the show was about to begin.
