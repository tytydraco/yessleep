I recently moved into a new home, and it is only a little bit a ways across the same town. At my old house, I noticed that electric workers would often be working at poles around the property, but I never thought much of it. When I was much younger, we had a man in a dilapidated truck - with no company markings - parked on the edge of our property behind the bushes. We approached the truck, which had windows frosted with ice, and the driver was hunched over in the driver’s seat, typing carefully on his laptop. He drove off unidentified without looking at us once. We all knew he was up to no good, and I guess that experience prompted me to take notice of people doing weird stuff on devices near my house.
Fast forward to today, I looked out my window and noticed the local electric company here again, doing something with the pole directly outside of my house. It feels like they are always here whenever I pull on my street, but never anywhere else in the neighborhood. Worse yet, I caught the driver looking into my bedroom window from the street on multiple occasions. I fear I am being watched.

Update: I remember seeing a video online of a man who blew up his house because of gangstalking paranoia. I always thought the term “gangstalking” was unfair, just like “conspiracy theorist” unfair. People stalk in gangs, no? People conspire, yes? É o que é. This electric company is still outside my house again for the fourth time this week. That is more than half of the week! Even though the workers change shifts, they all still treat me the same. They all watch me. I *hate* being watched. 
Before this all started, I was watching a YouTuber called SomeOrdinaryGamers who instructed us viewers to enhance internet security. I installed a VPN, a Tor browser, a virtual machine, and something else which I can’t remember the name of at the moment. For about a week, I felt very secure in my online browsing. I never do anything criminal, and I even turned on the Anti-Corn blocks that came with the VPN. Seriously, I just want privacy.
But it must have been shortly after I made this update to my security that my new acquaintance, the local electric company which I cannot name for fear of being identified, appeared in my life. I tried calling the police once, but out of fear of being diagnosed insane or unfit for society, I never have officially reported this to authorities. After all, I am not sure who is really behind all of this. It would not be my first time making a bad impression with law enforcement. I have thought about the alternative vigilante justice route, of just directly confronting these workers, but something in me just won’t allow me to go out there. I feel like fainting and I never even make it to the bedroom door. At least I have the uphill advantage.
