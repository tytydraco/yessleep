I've lived in one house, one room my entire life. I always was an imaginative child, whipping up stories and drawings left and right, inspired by the real world, supernatural beings, my sister's beautiful paintings, and later, artists online. With imagination, comes fears. 

I'm a paranoid, anxious person. I've had anxiety for as long as I can remember, but lately it skyrocketed.

I live a pretty normal life, I wake up, get dressed, go into my closet, grab my coat. My closet isn't that big, you can walk into it and look around, grab stuff, and it's relatively quiet. A light is installed in the ceiling, and I always turn it on when I walk in. Again, with imagination comes paranoia, and the dark scares me, even these days. I don't know if this is just imbedded in my brain at this point, my instinct tells me to do this, or my parents told me, but I never *ever* enter that closet without turning the light on first.

I go to school. It's the same procedure every day, sometimes there's a half day or break and I get time to myself. Sometimes the principal makes an announcement about an upcoming update  to the dress code or some other shenanigans. I don't typically pay attention, as it's not important. Sometimes there's a lockdown, earthquake, or fire drill, but that's not important either because we learned the procedure for those years ago in elementary school.

Then I noticed the changes. It started with my parents selling a special plushie to me. It's a large, plump, pink and orange dragon that I lovingly named Melon. Growing up, every little thing terrified me, so I'd bring Melon everywhere- to school, at home, in shopping centers, even in restaurants. People would look at me funny, and I received a lot of mockery from kids at school, but it didn't matter. Melon and I were inseparable. Through all of our years together, I had convinced myself that Melon was a ward that would banish all of the twisted concoctions that I envisioned. I'd sleep with him every night, knowing that I was safe with Melon, because as far as I was concerned, Melon was a ward, he was perfect, and he'd save me from harm. 

When I got into middle school, my parents told me to leave Melon home instead of bringing him everywhere. I tried to resist, but when they threatened to sell him, I got terrified and started sobbing. When I entered high school, I stopped sleeping with him every night. He was still in my house, and I told myself, *maybe the ward will work if he's in the house.* I'd given up on my silly childhood belief, but touching back on that silly thing made me nostalgic. 

Perhaps now, upon telling you about Melon, you'll see how devastated I was. I was sobbing when they told me they had sold him, and when they told me it was to "free up storage space," I was raging, swearing, and sobbing. Melon was the only thing that kept me from the brink of insanity growing up, and the fact that they had just casually sold him to a random donation center so he could be sold for less than 10 bucks was infuriating to me. 

Then, a few weeks later, still somber about losing Melon, when I opened my closet, I noticed one of the corners was darker than normal.

Cautiously, with the lights on, as always, I inspected this dark corner, and found a little blob of dust. I shrugged off the dreadful sensation that my anxiety, helpful as always, delivered me, and swept it up. I paid it no mind. We don't clean my closet often because we have a ton of random crap stored in there, and cleaning it would be a nightmare of "oh no, looks like that expensive glass vase that your great, great, great grandma blew herself has fallen on the floor and shattered because there's too much stuff in here." I didn't pay the dust any mind.

A few days after that, the dust was back. I swept it up.

The next day, more of it than ever was there. A feeling of dread welled up inside me again. That night, I didn't sleep, hearing a faint tapping sound coming from that closet.

After a few weeks of suffering through this ominous dust buildup and gradually louder tapping, my closet started to look... larger than usual. Again, it's not big- it's tall, but by no means wide. I called my dad in, and he told me that this was unusual. That night, at midnight, the time where all wretched things happen, I came sobbing and screaming into my parent's room, traumatized by something I couldn't see, hear, or feel, but with a sensation that something had gone by- it felt like something slithering over my grave.

I begged them, crying, to get rid of my closet, told them about this weird sensation, and my loss of sleep because of it. They were used to things like this after years of me growing up, freaking out. I hadn't had a panic attack this bad since middle school, and they knew that something was serious. 

My parents compiled to my begging. We moved all the stuff out of the closet, thankfully not breaking great-great-great-grandma's handblown vase, filled it up, and sealed it. I slept better the next few months.

Then, the scraping started.

Quiet, at first, then gradually louder. It sounded like something- something massive- digging its way up to the air, clawing and scrambling to free itself. The strange, pitch black dust started to appear next to where the closet used to be. 

I tried to ignore it all, but my life started to feel to repetitive. Too normal. The people around me seemed too nonchalant, maybe just because my brain was desintigrating. My sanity crumbling. Everything I knew was starting to feel too surreal, too familiar, too easy.

Then, the windstorms started. I knew something was wrong now. I felt my survival instincts kicking in, trying to make me run, flee, flee from this place that was holding me in, holding me in with whatever was coming from where that God-forsaken closet used to be. The wind was here. It blew so hard it knocked an armchair off of our porch, slamming it into the ground, breaking it in two. I was even more scared now. I screamed to my parents that we had to run, we had to leave, we have to leave this city that will kill us, that thing is coming and it will kill us.

They dismissed me. They told me that this sort of thing happened from time to time. I was screaming and they didn't give half a cent. 

I know something is not right! The wind is louder than ever, everything is closing, school, stores, public transit- we're only alive because the government sends us food. It's like quarentine all over again but we're stuck inside. The gutter was ripped from our house. The scraping sounds closer than ever. I am losing my mind. The dust is here. It cloaks my room. At night I see two glowing white eyes staring at me. Watching me.

I have to run. I am not a mad girl, for I know something is not right when nobody else does.

Nothing is right.

I don't know what to do. I want to run, but the wind is hoarding me in. I see a twisted smile, glinting in the faint moonlight underneath the eyes. It watches me sleep. It knows who I am. It follows me everywhere around the house.

My parents don't see it. I do. When our dog died, mere days after the storms started, I know it is no coincidence. The **creature's** teeth are red. The vets dismiss it as a "natural death" they say he lost his battle with cancer. But I know. Only I know. The **monster** did it. Whatever has been following me, **it** killed my dog, **it's** causing this wind, and **it's** coming for me next.

I want to run. I try to. **It** catches up to me. The wind blocks me like an invisible wall, hoarding me inside this city. I can't take a plane to leave this place. I don't know what's happening outside of this place- this cursed, cursed place- and when I wake up, I know my escape attempt was futile. I am in the hospital. The nurses around me are sweating, and I see my **curse** hovering behind them, tendrily claws brushing their shoulders. The nurses are sweating, but I do not know if my case is severe or if they can sense the **monster**.

My dog could sense **it** just like me, before **it** took him. I know he could see **it**. I know that my dog knew something was wrong, just like me. My parents say that my anxiety is getting to me, but I know **it** is real. And **it's** coming for me next. Because I can see **it**, just like my dog could, and **it** is plotting something I cannot understand.

And somehow, I know that I am the only thing standing between **it** and destroying this city- this world that I'm convinced might not be real.

Help me.
