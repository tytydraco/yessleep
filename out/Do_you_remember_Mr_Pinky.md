I wish more people remembered Mr Pinky, or anyone for that matter, because I feel crazy whenever I bring it up to anyone. 

He was my childhood best friend and he was everyone else's best friend, too! He was always everywhere all at once all the time! At my house, your house, everyone's house! It was like magic or something, as a kid it blew me away how he could do that.

I remember my friends and I would share stories about him during lunch break, some of us would play with hot wheels, others would have pretend tea parties, and others would simply talk with him for hours, in their bedrooms while their parents waited downstairs.

Once we got to high school everyone just seemed to stop talking about him, but what's really strange, is that everyone seemed to want to forget him, and I have never understood why because Mr Pinky was the perfect buddy, and what's worse is he stopped coming to visit me around this time.

I remember when I was around 9 I started getting bullied a lot, and I was always pretty sad after school and my parents never really noticed or cared but Mr Pinky did, he asked what had happened, and after I told him he promised me that he would fix it.

Those bullies never came back to school, and as far as I know, they never went to a new school either, he always made good on his promises. Not like mum, not like dad, always disappointed me, always looked down on our friendship. 

The one thing that's really strange that has always sat with me is when I was a teenager I was at this party and after a few drinks I started getting a loose tongue, and talked about him, despite how anxious it seemed to make everyone, I just didn't care, I missed seeing him, I missed my friend. 

One girl broke down into tears, screaming at me, telling me not to speak his name, like it was a sin or something. I thought that was so weird. Everyone at the party looked terrified of me, of the idea of saying his name, but why?

Mr Pinky was so friendly. I miss him a lot. 

Do you remember him? The patchy fur, the hunched stature? He would hobble around on his strange feet, with a cloak around his body.

Sometimes he would smell like pennies, and when I asked him why he just said it was because he'd paid the "problem solvers" their fee, which was a hefty sum of coins. He seemed to solve a lot of problems for a lot of kids. He told me that there was a lot of sad kids in my neighbourhood that needed help. He was so nice. 

Whenever I brought it up to mum or dad they'd just hush me and drink wine. I'm sick of people pretending he doesn't exist! Please tell me somebody hear remembers him? Anyone?

Life hasn't been the same without my best buddy.
