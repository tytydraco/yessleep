Heel, toe. Heel, toe.


One step, then another. Asphalt radiates heat through the soles of my boots, a low steady burn that never quite fades. I look down. My little sunshine is still sleeping, breath soft and milky against my chest, her weight warm and real. I have to protect that. At all costs.


Can’t stop. Can’t rest. Don’t think about hunger. It coils low in my gut, sour and sharp, like copper on the tongue.


Weeks since the betrayal. Weeks.


What else could I do? She was just standing there, grunting, jaw hanging wrong, eyes red, not just capillaries but flooded, glossy, ruptured. I swear I saw tears cutting clean lines through the grime on her face.


No. Stop. Focus. Now.


The desert air bites my skin, dry and alkaline, carrying dust, old trash, sun baked piss. Every breath rasps. Streets are quieter than ever. No engines. No dogs. Just wind pushing paper and the faint click of a loose sign somewhere down the block. Thank God. She needs sleep.


I scan storefronts. Faded lettering, sun blistered posters peeling like old scabs. Nothing’s changed. This part of town was always empty. Shelter in place orders or not.


I have to chance it.


To the infected, I smell like them. Rot and iron and something sweet underneath, gone wrong. To the living, I use her. A baby shields me. Most nod, offer help. No words. They assume trauma. Strength. Mostly right.


Keep her safe. At any cost.


It helps that I don’t feel human anymore. My skin feels too tight, like it doesn’t quite belong to me, nerves dulled except where hunger sharpens them.


The things I’ve done, God, the things I’ve done. Every excuse clings to me, greasy, heavy, impossible to wash off.


Basics. Sustenance. One thing left in common with them.


Once I know she’s fed, once I smell formula on her breath and feel her relax against me, I can think of surviving too.


I’m not cruel. Never take more than I need. A limb or two will do. The sound is the worst part, wet and final, like snapping thick rope soaked in meat.
Keep walking. Don’t think about hunger. Don’t rest.


Nothing’s changed. She still needs me.


Edge of the parking lot. Boots crunch glass and sun baked gravel, each step loud in the open space. Broken, twitching shapes litter the ground. Half alert. Sniffing. Their teeth chatter softly, like insects clicking in dry brush. Broken toys.


Heel, toe. Not fast. Not confident. Worn down.
Look dirty, not dead. Alive, barely. Skin dry. Eyes hollow. Not enough blood to tempt. Not enough fear to draw attention.


The Amazon warehouse looms. Blue logo faded, sun bleached, peeling like a bruise. The building smells even from here, dust, oil, old cardboard, decay trapped in shade. Once buzzing with people, now maybe with the dead.


Doors sealed but busted. Bent metal screams softly when the wind pushes it. Scavengers? Survivors? Dinner?


Shift strap. Keep her steady. She murmurs, lips puckering in her sleep. One figure turns. Nose twitches, nostrils flaring wet and pink.


Freeze. Low, crackling breath rasps out of its chest. Not fear. Not excitement. Exhaustion.
It loses interest. Broken toys.


Loading dock. Risk. Inside, people. Things that were people. Nothing. Food. Formula. Something real.


She needs it. I need her to have it.


Inside, the air is cooler but stale, thick with paper dust that coats the tongue. Shelves stretch forever, bent, broken, casting long rib like shadows. Something skitters far off, plastic clattering. I move like I belong, like I’ve always been here.


Voices. Human. Warm. Breathing voices.
A whisper. “Wait, is that a baby?”


Three of them. Woman, man, teenage boy. Sweat, fear, soap, human smells layered together, intoxicating and painful.


Shift to be seen. Adjust blanket. Show her face. They freeze. Boy raises crowbar, knuckles white. Metal creaks. Man steps forward cautiously, boots scraping concrete.


“She’s not one of them. Look. Baby.”


They build a story. Trauma. Strength. Father who won’t speak. Mostly right.


Grunt. Nod. Eyes low.


Mike offers food. Water. The plastic crinkles loud in the quiet. I take it. Nod. Gesture matters. I can’t eat. Not anymore. My stomach tightens anyway, aching, angry.


They let me in. For her.


Night. Terra hums, low and cracked, feeds my daughter. The smell of warm formula fills the space, sweet and dizzying. Most peace I’ve seen since the world went quiet.


Mike sits, crowbar in hand. Watches. I watch him. His pulse ticks loud in my ears.

Approach. Sit. Gesture. Talk without talking.


“You’re not like us, are you?”


Pause. Nod.


No flinch.


“I was dead anyway. Cancer. Didn’t tell Reed. Didn’t want him carrying it. He’s got enough.”


Silence stretches. Dust drifts in the beam of a lantern.


“You’re keeping her safe,” he says. “That matters. More than how.”


Nod.


“If I go out,” he says, voice already fading, “make it look like it wasn’t you. He needs to think the world took me. Not you. You’ll keep her going. Like I did for mine.”


He leans back. Eyes closed. Breath rattles once. Then stops.


Later. Feed. Clean. Rinse blood in old trucker showers behind the loading bay. Cold water needles my skin, washing rust colored streaks down the drain. The smell lingers no matter how long I scrub. Sharp. Holy.


Human again, for the first time in weeks.


Morning. Reed finds lock broken. Blood near door.


“Something got in,” I rasp. My throat burns unused.


Flinch. “You can talk?”


“Lucky,” I say.


They believe it. Watch me. Notice coat. Boots. Mike’s things. The leather still warm from his body.


“Find them in the warehouse?”


Nod. Eat protein bar. Chalky. Dry. Useless. They think I’ll leave. I won’t. Just fed. Just rested.


Terra offers for me to leave. “Come with us. For her.”


Shake head. Look at my sleeping daughter. Full. Safe. Formula dried at the corner of her mouth.


“Safe here,” I say.


Reed doesn’t argue. Just nods, jaw tight, eyes wet.


They pack. Leave. Door shuts. Echo fades.


I stay. Quiet. Secure. Corners. Supplies.


 Eventually, someone else will come looking for safety. They always do.


I will keep her safe. At any cost.


Always.
