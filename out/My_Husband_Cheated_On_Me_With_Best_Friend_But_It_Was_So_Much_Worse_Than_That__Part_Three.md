Lilith wasn’t just a monster, she was more of a disease. One that I had unknowingly carried for almost twenty years.  
A disease that had infected everything in my life down to my soul.  
I didn’t know it exactly at the time, but I do now.  
I was so fucking scared.  
I’m still fucking scared.  
\-  
The Christmas lights.   
Those damned white Christmas lights that we had strung over thumb tacks all throughout our apartment. We loved the way it lit up our walls. Walls that had been touched up over the years with sheens that didn’t quite match the old paint. The lights made those spots shine more than the rest.  
The stained carpet was thin, and you could feel the coldness of the cement coming up through it.  
Lilith was constantly spraying Febreze because the smell of our neighbors smoking pot would pour through the vents and it drove her nuts.  


We had a small tree that year. Most of the decorations on it were made out of construction paper and glue. We also got a box of multi-colored candy canes that we hung from the branches that we would eat as the month wore on.  
I refused to let Lilith contribute more than me, so we lived on the cheap. Half and half.   
We loved it that way.  
Just the two of us.  


It was our second Christmas Eve together. I didn’t go home to see my parents that year.   
We had Bridget Jones on the television, our flannel pajamas on, and we were getting drunk and eating nachos. It was perfect.  
She insisted that we open our presents that night. She didn’t want to wait until morning. I didn’t have a lot of money that year. I got her a copy of “Girls Just Want To Have Fun” on DVD, and I made her a frame out of a bunch of mismatched puzzle pieces. On the bottom, I was able to piece together the word “Soulmates”. The picture I put inside was her favorite picture of us.  
She loved it. She put it up on the mantle.   
She handed me her gift.  


“Oh come on!”  
“No, seriously, open it.”  
“It’s a jewelry box, Lilith!”  
“So what?”  
“We had a twenty dollar limit! You promised.”  
“Well it hardly seems fair that I have to buy you a shitty present just because your’e poor as fuck! Quit being a bitch and be grateful that you have an amazing friend.”  
“Whatever.”  
“Are you going to open it, or are you just going to stare at it?”  


I tore the paper off. The box inside wasn’t like anything I had ever seen in a store. It looked like it was made out of a translucent jade, but the closer I looked at it, I could see that it was made from layers and layers of paper that had been treated with something that gave it its color and made it hard.   
“What is this?”  
“Just a box.” She smiled.   
“It’s gorgeous.”  
“It’s something I learned how to do a long time ago. I haven’t made one since I was a kid. I’m glad you like it… but… you know, it is just a box. There’s more inside.”  
I felt like I was opening some kind of ancient treasure. I pulled the top off and inside was a necklace.  
The chain was a white gold and at the end of it was a small stone.  
“Oh my God.”  
“Do you like it?”  


“Lilith, it’s… I mean…” I was dumbstruck. It was a perfect tear drop of Obsidian. I held it up in the white light. The black stone had two streaks running around it that were clearer than the rest. The streaks touched each other at only a tiny point on the front of the stone. Other than that point, there was the tiniest line of black that separated them around the stone.  “You definitely… I… I feel like…”  


“Ok, so this is gonna sound a little sappy, but I already committed to it and I’m drunk, so I have to own it. The two streaks are you and me. We’re surrounded by nothing but darkness. That darkness can come between us, but there is always this one point. The one spot where the darkness will never be able to separate us.”  
I put my arms around her. I didn’t want to let go. She finally pushed me away. I just stared at her. I wondered what I did to deserve someone like her. I couldn’t say anything.   
It got awkward.  


Lilith always had a problem with an awkward silence. She finally broke the moment in the same way she always did when she started to feel uncomfortable; by being crass.  
“Oh for heaven’s sake! I can’t tell if you’re looking at me like I’m your mother or you want to fuck me. Either way, you're never getting your mouth on my boobs! Turn around!”  
She snatched the stone out of the box and I pulled my hair up. The teardrop rested at the top of my breastbone. It felt warm against my skin, and I said as much.  
“That’s because there’s something special inside of it.”  
“What?”  
“A little bit of me.” I had no idea what she meant. I got up and walked to the small mirror we had on the wall next to the front door. I couldn’t stop touching it.   
“I feel like such an asshole.” I looked at her behind me in the reflection.  
“Why?”  
“Because you got me this and I got you Sarah Jessica Parker and Helen Hunt.”  
It was the best Christmas I ever had.  
\-  
There were Christmas lights on almost every house that I ran by. I had called 911 as I was running. Several people rolled by with their windows down and asked me if I needed a ride. I didn’t answer any of them. I wasn’t in my right mind. I kept thinking that any one of them could be her.  
The bar was probably just over a mile from my parent’s house.   


At one point, there was a dog sitting in the shadows on the sidewalk across the street. It watched me as I ran by.  
It looked like a dog I hadn’t seen since I was a little girl.  
It whined. I tried not to give it a second thought until I heard it running behind me. I worried that whatever Lilith put into my body to paralyze me was also making me hallucinate. It followed me all the way through my old neighborhood.  
I was almost to my street when my dad called me.  


“Amy?”  
“Dad! Are you and mom ok?!”  
“Yeah.”  
“Where’s Jessica?!”  
“She’s right here. Baby, what’s wrong? The police are here.”  
I rounded the corner and could see flashing lights in front of my parent’s house.  
\-  
Nothing was out of the ordinary. Not a damn thing.  
It had to have been Lilith on the phone. She had used my daughter’s voice.  
I wouldn’t let go of Jessica. She begged me to let her go back to bed while the cops were talking to me, and my mother finally had to pry her out of my arms.  
I told them everything.   
I told them about the dead man back at the bar.   
They took me in for questioning. They promised me that they would leave someone to watch over my family.  
\-  
I was questioned for hours. The same story, over and over again.   
The lead detective was a small guy; rail thin and a large nose. Detective Hopkins was middle aged and his hairline was starting to raise the white flag.   


His suit was crumpled and there was a small coffee stain on his shirt just to the right of his tie. I couldn’t take my eyes off of it while I answered his questions. He started to notice and every once in a while he would reach down and try to cover it up by moving his tie over it. He looked at me like I was nuts. I told him to call the cops back in Louisville, and they would corroborate everything I was saying about Lilith.  
Everything about that video.  


I asked him if anyone had a few cigarettes that they could spare.  
I quit smoking years ago. Lilith hated it. While I was sitting in the interrogation room, lighting one after the other, I wasn’t sure if I was doing it because it was something I used to run to in times of stress, or to somehow spite Lilith in any way I could. Whatever the reason was, it felt good. It gave me something to do besides just stare at the floor.  
\-  
The door opened and Detective Hopkins walked back in. He had changed his shirt.  
“Mrs. Taylor? I have a little bit of news.” He sat down. He had two cups of coffee. He pushed one of them toward me. “Why didn’t you go back to Louisville?”  
“I don’t know. I don’t know anything right now, I’m going to be honest.”  
“Ok. Um… here’s the deal. This is all very strange.” He took a drink of his coffee. “Your husband is still alive.”  
“What? No. He’s not.”  
“We have him using his credit card four different times in the last two days. In two of those places, we have him on video.”  
“That’s Lilith!”  
An awkward pause.  


“Whoever it is, they’re obviously following you. Now, no one can explain the video that was found in your home, but it’s kind of hard to deny that your husband is alive. There’s also no trace of this woman, Lilith.”  
“Are you fucking kidding me?!”  
“Please stay with me, ok? I’m on your side. What I’m saying is, that there is no record of her name anywhere. Obviously she’s been using an alias. If she’s following you as well, there’s just no trace of her.”  
“But I showed you the texts!”  
“We’re still trying to figure out who that phone belongs to.”   
“No one even saw her at the bar?!”  
“No.”   
“I don’t believe this.”  


“That wound on your hand. Are you sure the man at the bar didn’t do that to you?” He was concerned. He obviously thought I was disturbed, but the kindness in his voice was there. He was trying to understand.  
“I’m positive.”  
“We got the video from the motel. It’s clear that man was about to attack you. I got a name on him too. He has a very long history of violence Mrs. Taylor. Most of it towards women. You’re a very lucky woman.”  
“Well I’m not feeling so lucky.”  
“The reason I asked you is because he has the same type of burn on his arm.”  
“I told you how that happened.”  
“I know you did. We got a sample of your blood and we’re checking out his while we speak. If you were drugged, we’re gonna know. I’m on your side, uh, can I call you Amy?”  


“Yeah.”   
“I’m on your side, Amy. I’m just trying to make sense out of all this. ”  
“There isn’t any sense to it.”  
“I’m going to give you my card. I’ll be in touch, but if you need anything, you call me. I’m going to have one of my officers give you a ride to your parents house. I’m taking this very seriously. There’s going to be someone watching that house all day and all night. We’re going to figure this out. I promise.”  
I was about to lose it. I started shaking. I was holding back tears. He reached forward and put his hand on my shoulder. His eyes were blue. They were kind.  
Another awkward pause.  


“Do you even believe me?”  
“I know you believe it. For right now, that’s enough for me.”  
I looked back down at his shirt. He had another small drop of coffee in the same place as before. He followed my eyes and then shook his head.  
“I think I’ve got a hole in my lip.”  
\-  
It was after three in the afternoon when I was finally able to go back home. Two plain clothes cops drove me. I sat in the backseat staring through the window at the town where I grew up. Everything looked different to me, even though everything was the same. There was no comfort being in my old home because there was something out there lurking within it. Something alien and cruel.  


The cop who was driving the car kept looking back at me in the rearview. I didn’t like the way he was looking at me, almost leering. I looked at him in the rearview expecting him to keep his eyes forward, but he didn’t. He kept looking at me without saying a word.  
When we pulled up to the house, there was a police cruiser sitting across the street. The cop inside was looking down; writing or playing with his phone.  
He slowly looked up at me as we parked.  


My phone vibrated.  
It was a number I didn’t recognize, but when I opened it, the first words were,   
*“I had to get a new phone.”*  
I turned off the screen and when I looked back up, the cop in the cruiser was smiling at me. I swore he even winked at me.  
The cops said nothing to me as I got out of the car and walked toward the front door.   


My parents' neighbors, Homer and Joe, were sitting on their porch drinking their nightly cup of decaf. They had known me my whole life. Some of the best people I have been fortunate enough to know. They both waved at me; looks of concern were plastered over their wrinkled faces. As I opened the door and waved back at them, I had no way of knowing if one of them wasn’t who they were pretending to be.  


Jessica ran over and I picked her up. I started telling her how much I missed her while I pulled the shade on my parents front window. The two cops in the driveway and the cop in the cruiser were all looking at me.  


My parents were both standing in the family room. They weren’t saying anything.  
“Angel, I need to put you down for a minute, ok?”  
“But I missed you.”  
“I know baby, just give Mommy a minute. Why don’t you go climb on Poppy, ok?”  


I checked all of the locks on the doors and windows, and I made sure all the blinds were closed.  
My parents watched me run through their house like a crazy person until I finally made it to the sliding glass window that opened into the backyard. There was a sorry sight looking back at me; a bony old German Shepherd whose tail was moving just as wildly as I was. His tongue was hanging out of the side of his mouth and his ratty coat was covered in dust. He looked like something from my past and I thought I had imagined him the night before.  
He started whining at me.  


“What the hell is that?”  
“It’s a dog.”  
“I know it’s a dog Dad, what is it doing in your backyard?”  
“He followed you home. Real nice old guy. Doesn’t he look familiar?”  
“Dad. I can’t do this right now.” I pulled the shade down on the slider. I stared at the three of them. That’s when the gravity of everything came crashing down. I started blubbering in front of my daughter, or who I thought was my daughter.  
“Mommy, what’s wrong?”  
“Nothing baby.” I wiped my nose and tried to compose myself. I threw my hands in the air and smiled back at her. “Angel, what music did Mommy play you over and over on the ride down here? If you get it right, I’ll make you waffles!”  
“Princess and Frog!”   
“Yay! You got it right!” I put my hands out to her and picked her up. I looked at my parents. I remember praying to God they were both actually my parents.  


“Dad… what was the safeword I gave you?”  
“Truck. What’s going on?”  
“Mom… what was yours?” My mom’s eyes went to the ceiling.  
“Oh honey… I can’t remember.Um…”  
I swallowed hard.  
“Mom! What was the fucking word?!”  
“Amy!”   
“Hey! Don’t speak to your mother like that! Or in front of our granddaughter like that!”   
“Mom, please… what was it?” I was pleading.  
She was taking too long. I was terrified that Lilith had done something to my mother and it was Lilith I was staring at. I put Jessica down and behind me.  
“Oh! Frito Pie! It was Frito Pie.”  


I sank to the floor sobbing.   
My parents and my daughter were there with me.  
She hadn’t hurt them or taken them.  
At the very least I knew that. I finally broke down.  
\-  
Later that night, I was sitting in the recliner in front of my Dad’s ridiculously large tv. All the lights were off. I had done the monster check under Jessica’s bed for her before she laid down. After I put her to sleep, I did the monster check for myself through the rest of the house.  


My Dad was out in the backyard giving that old dog a can of Vienna Sausages before he went to bed. He was always a sucker for stray dogs, and since this one looked like our old dog Charlie, my Dad fell for it hook, line, and sinker. When he came inside, he knelt down and petted my head.  


“It’s gonna be ok, baby. The sun’s gonna come up tomorrow. You just try and get some sleep.”  
“I love you Daddy.”  
He kissed my forehead and walked down the hall.  
\-  
It was impossible to sleep. I walked to the sliding glass door and cracked it and had a cigarette. The dog just sat there.  
“What are you looking at?”   
The dog cocked his head and let out a low, grumbling answer.  
“Looks like you got a new home.”   
Another jowl flapping response.  
“You really look like Charlie. That’s crazy.”  
No answer back.  
“Are you Charlie?”  


I knelt down and put out my hand to pat his head, but then I drew it back. Something wasn’t right. I threw the cigarette outside and closed the door. The dog cocked his head and whined. I pulled the shade over the door and checked the lock.  


I remembered the text message that I didn’t finish and reached into my pocket.  


*“I had to get a new phone. I’m glad you’re back home. You’ll never guess who I am now. They were delicious. Better than Frito Pie ;) You’ve only got two days to figure it out, then we’re going to play a new game.”*  
\-  
I paced the house for hours. I tried to be as quiet as I could, but the dog must have heard me. He was always waiting for me, pawing at the back door whenever I was walking back through the living room.  
\-  
At one point, I stood in the doorway to my bedroom. I was staring at a life before I even met Lilith. Everything was exactly as it had been when I moved out. My eyes moved over everything, and they settled on my [bookshelf](https://www.reddit.com/r/tinyhorribles/).  
I started to shake.  


The last time I had seen the necklace Lilith had given me was in my jewelry box back in Louisville, but now it was draped over the puzzle piece frame. The picture inside was the same, but my face had been scratched out.   
Lilith had been in my parents’ house.   
I wondered if she still was.
