I was hurtling down the sinuous path, fleeing from my brother as it wound deeper into the forest. I could not look back, not after what had happened. Ahead, the trail opened up and led me to the maw of a grotesque cave. The cave’s abyss extended so deeply that it felt infinite, and the absence of any visible life or flora made it appear utterly lifeless. Panting heavily, I heard my brother’s voice now near from a distant calling for me, filled with grief and anger. Without a second thought, I plunged into the cave, hoping to find refuge in its darkness.

The cave’s depths were terrifying. It had a stark, repulsive stench, reminiscent of rotting meat, and the sound of mournful cries echoed from deep within the cave—distant yet haunting. I continued running until the light from the entrance became a distant memory. I collapsed onto my knees, drenched in sweat, trembling with fear, and tears streaming down my face, as if my life were about to end. I mustered the strength to stand, feeling completely lost and barely able to see my hands in front of my face. Driven by fear, I began to walk slowly, waving my hands to guide myself. The heat was searing and grew more intense with each step.

In the distance, a sudden, faint glow drew my eye. A tall figure, twice my height, wearing a black cape and rare glowing stone ornaments, with skin so pale it seemed almost lifeless—as if no blood flowed in his veins—was moving towards me. His eyes were as black as the cave itself, not even glimmering with the light of the fire. Fear overwhelmed me, and I turned to run for my life, but his menacing voice followed closely behind:

“Don’t run; once entered, no one has ever escaped. There are no exits. This cave is infinite.”

Despair clawed at me as I ran. I stumbled and fell, my vision blurring as I hit the floor. How could I believe there was no escape from this? Darkness overtook me, and I lost consciousness.

When I woke up, I was no longer in the cave but resting on my brother’s back, his steady footsteps carrying us towards a van parked just ahead. “Where am I?” I mumbled, still dazed.

“You got tired and fell asleep while we were out,” my brother explained. “So, I carried you back.” As we drove away, I struggled to make sense of the nightmare—the cave, the threatening figure, the endless darkness. It all felt too real to ignore. Surrounded by the familiar forest, my fear began to wane, but an unsettling feeling still remained. We drove home in silence.

As we arrived, a rush of fear and confusion hit me—our front door was wide open, and police cars lined the street. Something was seriously wrong. Inside, an officer approached us, his face ashen and his voice heavy with concern.

“Are you the homeowners' sons?” he asked, pausing as he searched us for any sign of understanding or disbelief. My brother nodded, his face blank with shock.

“I’m sorry to tell you this, but your parents were found dead. They were stabbed multiple times with a knife.”

A wave of terror suddenly froze me in place. I remembered the horrifying scene: blood smeared across the floor and on my clothes, the vacant, lifeless eyes of my parents. The gruesome slashes on their bodies with their mutilated limbs spread all over the place.

 The rest was a horrific blur, leaving me numb and disoriented. How could this happen? Who could have done something like this? Why would anyone commit such a monstrous act? Such questions ran through my soul.

An officer pulled my brother aside, his voice cold and authoritative. “We need to ask you some questions. You're the prime suspect. We have found evidence.”

My mind whirled. The police believed my brother was the killer. The weight of their accusation was devastating. My memories were fragmented and unclear—why couldn’t I remember what happened? The fear and confusion were intense. My heart thudded, each unanswered question worsening the fear and making the truth seem even more out of reach.

Days passed in a blur, blending together with no clear sense of time. My brother was taken away, charged with the murders. I felt lost, unable to grasp the reality of the situation. “Was this all real? If yes why was my brother chasing me?” I was left in complete disarray. On the day of his trial, I visited him one last time.    

He looked at me with intense eyes, his face tired and worn. His gaze was filled with a mix of fear and desperation, and the silence between us felt charged with unspoken words. I thought I do ask him what had happened but suddenly, he cut through the silence with fierce intensity: “Wake up! I warned you—the cave has no exits. There’s no escaping it. This place is endless!”

In a heartbeat, I was back in the cave, the suffocating darkness closing in around me. My heart hammered in my chest, each breath coming in shallow, quick gasps as terror gripped me. The oppressive blackness pressed in, making every moment feel like a battle against the consuming fear. Then, in the darkness, my eyes were horrified and helplessly drawn towards my hand, slick with cold, dried blood, gripping the knife.
