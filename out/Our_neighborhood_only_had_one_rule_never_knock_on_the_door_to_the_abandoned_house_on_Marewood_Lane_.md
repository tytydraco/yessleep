I stood on my front porch, staring out at the dimly lit street. An eerie silence hung in the air, accompanied by light fog and the last rays of the setting sun quickly retreating beyond the horizon. I glanced over at the neighbors’ houses, all lights were out, spider webs covered the corners, and dark banners draped across the walls. Even the rush hour traffic had vanished, not daring to interrupt the silence, nor did the children dare come out to play. After all, they would have to wait their turn.

“Come on, let’s go already,” Zander insisted, proudly donning his black robes, holding a scythe.

“We have to wait,” I demanded. “You know the rules.”

There were no laws disallowing us from wandering the streets. It was merely an unspoken suggestion that we restrain ourselves, giving families time to prepare for the festivities of Halloween. The vast majority of parents worked day jobs and would typically return home between five and six. Giving them an hour to clear the streets and prepare bowls of candy on their doorsteps seemed a reasonable demand. But at seven o’clock sharp, children, teenagers, and a few accompanying adults would rush onto the streets, ready for the annual round of trick or treat.

“Fine, five minutes, then we march,” Devon said. “But this year, as you know, we have something special in store.”

I groaned, “yes, I know. I’m sure it’ll be a perfectly embarrassing surprise.”

“Come on, don’t be so grim. We’re seventeen. This will be our last chance to celebrate Halloween the old-fashioned way before we grow old.” 

“So, eighteen is old now, is it?” I snickered.

“To old for this childish crap,” Zander argued. “I want to party next year.”

“You’ve never even had a drink,” I argued.

“Well, next year once we graduate, I’ll have the chance. I know a guy who can get us fake IDs.”

“There’s no person on this planet who’d let you pass for twenty-one,” Devon chuckled.

“Whatever.”

Then the clock stuck seven, and without hesitation, the entire street came to life. Thousands of spooky lights turned on, and cheap animatronics whirred to life. Then the doors opened, and dozens of costumed children and their accompanying guardians rushed onto the streets. Within seconds, chaos had emerged, and the houses with their lights turned on were flooded with eager little monsters scavenging for candy.

“It’s go time,” Zander announced.

“Yeah, and I’m super excited about your so-called ‘challenge,’ can’t wait…” I let out as sarcastically as I could.

Zander was the most heavily costumed of our three-man group, cosplaying death. Devon had opted for a cape and fake teeth, while I only wore a white, plain mask.

We ventured onto the street, standing tall above the kids. Few people our age still celebrated Halloween, most focused on getting alcohol from their older peers and partying the night into oblivion. But it was a scene I wasn’t yet interested in partaking in, neither was Devon, which held Zander back from dropping out annual celebrations in favor of his older peers. But this year, our quest was not to scare the children, nor to hunt for candy. No, this year we were heading down the street, turning onto Marewood Lane, much to my dismay.

“You’ve got to be kidding me,” I said, already having laid eyes on our target.

A house stood at the lane’s end, ancient, abandoned, not even worth a street number. For generations, the home had been left untouched, never shown any care, but also not displaying progressive deterioration. No one could tell exactly when the house had been built, just that it already stood there when our grandparents themselves were kids. A moment frozen in time even then. Though harmless on its own, there had always been one rule, *never* approach it, and *never* knock on the door.

It was a peculiar sight. The property was large, and the foundation seemed strong enough, if nothing else the building could have been torn down to put up a new home. Or at least the property could have been used for a small park. But for reasons unknown, no one had been given permission to utilize the area. So, year after year, the house would stand there, untouched, unused, every day of the year, except for Halloween.

Because on the eve on Halloween, every year without fail, at seven o’clock, a light would turn on, dimly visible through the living room window. It wouldn’t flicker or wave as if coming from a candle, but would stay static, as if a light switch had been turned on, an impossible feat seeing as the house couldn’t possible be equipped with functioning electrical systems. Yet, there it was, and to approach it had remained strictly forbidden for generations. A rule mindlessly followed, spawning many-an urban legend.

“You can’t be serious about this,” I said.

“Oh, but we are,” Zander said. “Every year there’s a challenge, and now its your turn. Unless you want to forfeit your right as a man, that is.”

I sighed, regretting that I had once taken part in deciding challenges for both Zander and Devon in the years prior. Each of us had to partake as a rite of passage before we turned eighteen. Last year, Zander had been challenged to steal our principal’s car keys from his office, wearing a scream mask as he did, and the year before Devon had been challenged to get us obviously fake IDs in a futile attempt at purchasing alcohol, all while dressed as a clown.

“So—what exactly do you want me to do? Spend the night?” I asked.

“No, of course not,” Zander began. “We’re not that devious. We just want you to go inside and figure out where the light is.”

“That’s it?” I asked.

“Don’t take this challenge so lightly,” Dale joined in, exaggerating a creepy voice. “You’ll be breaking the ancient rule of Marerwood Lane. Who knows what the consequences will be?”  

On its own, the task wasn’t exactly daunting, but we’d all heard the rumors of people going missing, though it had been more than two decades since the last incident, and that was a runaway teenage boy who’d taken the life of his parents and had more likely just fled the state. Though no one could confirm that the missing people had even approached the house, most of the regions missing person reports had occurred on the eve of Halloween, which had spawned the rumors.  

“Probably just junkies using the house for shelter,” I argued in an attempt at making myself feel better.

“Then why are they only there on Halloween?” Dale asked.

“To mess with us?” I went on.

“You’re stalling,” Zander said.

“No, I’m going right now,” I said, yet I hesitated.

“Yes, you’re going, I can see that,” Zander laughed.  

“Shut up.”

At that point, the teasing felt worse than whatever I could expect within the house. Worst case scenario, in my mind, would be that I might confront some poor homeless person just looking for a place to sleep for a night. If nothing else, I’d feel like a douchebag, which had never stopped me before.

So, I took a deep breath and stepped foot on the abandoned property, heading for the house. And no sooner had I crossed the threshold, than I could feel the atmosphere change around me. My friends were still teasing me from the sidewalk, but their voices felt so far away. The chatter and gleeful scream of children trick or treating faded from reality. The sky darkened, the air felt heavier, but I hadn’t even reached the house yet.

Before I knew it, I found myself standing on the front porch. My hand hovered over the door handle. I glanced back at my friends, who looked at me with anticipation. I then lifted my hand and knocked on the door, not sure whether or not I actually expected a response.

“Come on, just go inside!” Zander yelled from the street, his voice muffled and distant.

I knocked again and got no response. I put my ear closer to the door and heard nothing from within. My heart was racing, and I felt my chest tighten, but I remained far too stubborn to just turn back and demand another challenge. So, I twisted the handle, opening the door without resistance.

Before me stood a dark hallway with stairs leading up to a second floor. The wooden walls were rotten, with whatever paint had once occupied it turned a sickly green and dull brown. Picture frames hung on the wall, containing black and white photos that had faded almost beyond recognition.

“Hello?” I called out meekly as I took step inside. The floor beneath my feet creaked loudly enough that it certainly had to have alerted anyone that might be occupying the home, yet there was no response.

Again, I glanced back at my friends, who were wildly gesturing for me to continue inside. I obliged and moved within, peering up the stairs to see if anyone was hiding in the dark. As I reached the first step, the front door slid shut behind me, creaking briefly before banging loudly against the frame. Though a shock, I blamed on a light draft pulling through the building.

“Is there anyone there?” I asked again, ready to spurt outside if anyone replied.

“Okay,” I whispered to myself. “Just check the light out and leave. Don’t be stupid.”

The living room was situated to the right of the main entrance and was where the light had been turned on. It was short walk through another, narrow hallway, also separated by a closed door. I went to open it, but before I could twist the knob, I heard a faint cry coming from the top of the stairs, the unmistakable sob of an infant.

Redirecting my attention to the second floor, I wondered if I had imagined the sound, but then the baby cried again, louder than the first time. It didn’t just sound upset, but akin to a baby calling out in the midst of a fever dream. It was a sound I had heard frequently when my younger brother was a mere few months old. The baby was sick and needed help.

“Who’s there?” I called out into the darkness, hoping a parent would respond, but again my calls were left unanswered.

The baby cried out again, this time more intense, almost guttural. Panic rose within my chest, but the desire to help the infant overwhelmed any sense of self-preservation. I decided to head up the stairs and bring the baby out, damn the challenge. I carefully walked up to the second floor, step by step, ensuring the rotten planks didn’t give in under my weight. I held tightly onto the railing, wet from rot, chunks of wood breaking off from my grip.

Taking another step, a plank bent under my foot, causing me to slip. I grabbed onto the wall, now facing even more pictures lining the staircase wall. They were all family portraits from a bygone era. There were three children, all under the age of ten, wearing school uniforms from the beginning of the last century. An older man and a young woman stood next to the children, presumably the parents. None of them smiled, all wearing blank expressions that belonged to an age where cameras needed long exposures for even simple portraits.

I continued up the stairs, not letting myself take a proper deep breath until reaching the top. There I was faced with a long, narrow hallway extending deeper into the house, doors lining each side. Like the rest of the house, it appeared uninhabited. Dust and mold covered the floor, undisturbed for what must have been decades. But then the baby cried again. The sound was coming from the room at the very end of the hallway.

A section of collapsed floorboards left behind a hole leading down into a pitch-black void. Only a slim rim of planks provided passage to the other side. I pressed my back against the dirty walls and moved with smalls steps to the other side. Looking back, I realized just how far away the staircase seemed, as if the room had elongated since I entered it. My flight or fight instincts had begun to revert back to flight, but as the baby cried again, I redirected my focus to the door. Up close it looked oddly well-kempt, colored baby blue with what seemed like a fresh layer of paint, and a yellow, new moon hanging on the top. I reached out a trembling hand to open it, feeling a strange presence appear behind me, and warm breath washing over my neck.

“Shh,” a voice whispered softly as something tapped me on the shoulder. “You’ll wake the baby.”

Turning around in shock, I was met by an empty hall. Now, it felt even longer than before, as if it extended each time I turned my back to it. The voice, however, had been all too close, raspy, impossible to distinguish whether it had been a man or a woman, young or old. It was a presence, undoubtedly something malicious.

It had become abundantly clear that something about this place was wrong. Every fiber of my being was telling me to turn and run, but despite all my logical senses, I felt compelled to open the door and check on the infant, a creature I started to doubt was even human.

Again, I put my hand on the handle. But this time I had the chance to pull the door open, revealing another, smaller room. Without even setting foot inside, I felt myself getting pulled in by an unseen force, and once there, the door shut behind me. An empty cradle stood before me, brand new, handmade. It was rocking back and forth on its own, but the infant that had cried out for help was nowhere to be seen. The rest of the room was equally pristine, walls covered in the same, pale blue paint as the door, with cloud shapes covering the wallpaper. A music box stood on a shelf, playing a soft tune that felt eerily familiar—serene and comforting, a core memory from a time I had long since forgotten.

“Look what you’ve done,” the voice whispered again from behind, this time with an angry undertone. I turned again to find no one behind me, but no sooner had I redirected my gaze away from the crib, than the crying returned, I instinctively redirected my focus to the infant, but the crib still lay empty. The entire room had now changed. The comforting walls had faded, the blue replaced by the dark, underlying wood, filled with cracks and rot. The crib had broken down, now lying on the floor, broken and forgotten by time. The floor was barren, no more soft carpets to warm the feet, only cold, wet concrete.

Trying to process the overstimulation inside the ever-changing house, I was interrupted by the sound of raspy laughter emerging from all directions, mocking, threatening, evil. It came from behind me, from within the walls, from the floor, the ceilings, even inside my own head. I finally decided that I’d had enough. I turned around and hauled ass back towards the entrance, jumping over the hole in the hallway, and running down the rotten staircase two steps at the time, only to slip halfway down the steps, sending me pummeling to the ground.   

With my body aching, and possibly a few cracked ribs, it took a full minute before I dared to lift my head off the floor, and when I did. Before me, where the front door I had entered through once stood, existed only a solid wall. I was trapped.

“Help,” I called out in a mere whisper, my chest too injured to pull in enough air for a scream.

Using whatever remained of my power, I managed to get back on my feet, desperately searching for an exit. But only one path remained—the hallway leading into the only lit room in the house: the living room. I had half a mind to jump through a window, but any that had previously inhabited the walls had inexplicably vanished from sight. I had no choice but to proceed, walking through the damp, rotting hallways until I stood before the door to the living room. I opened it slowly, pushing it inwards as I tried to sneakily peer into the room.

On the other side I was met with a surprisingly warm living quarter. Fresh, wooden planks on the walls, a proper floorboard, dry furniture with a rug on the floor. A lit fireplace radiated a comforting heat throughout the room, but with how lively it felt, it couldn’t have been what we observed from outside. It was just too much.  

“Ah, Mr. Cranston, you’ve finally arrived,” a friendly voice called from inside.

I opened the door fully, met with a man dressed in a suit. His face was obscured by an impossible shadow, making it impossible to recognize him from sight alone. He was sitting at the far side of a short table, one glass on each side, as if he’d been waiting for a longtime friend to come visit.

“Who-who are you?” I stuttered.

“I am the Keeper of this house,” he said.

“There was a—there was a baby—” I began, unable to complete the sentence.

“Ah, yes, of course,” he said matter-of-factly, not bothering to explain the sight any further. “Why don’t you have a seat.”

His voice felt commanding yet comforting. Had it been any other setting, I would have believed him to be an ally. But finding such a man sitting obscured by darkness in a hellish house, I knew something about him was wrong.

“Trepidation—an understandable reaction to the situation,” he went on. “Still, I must insist that we talk.”

“Who are you?” I repeated, still not taking a seat.

“As I said. I am the Keeper.”

“I don’t—I don’t know what that is.”

“Let’s just say I make sure everything around here runs smoothly.”

“You’re in charge?”

“You could say that.”

“But the baby—" I went on, a question he kept ignoring.

“I think you’ve asked enough questions for now. After all, you’re the intruder here. Have a seat. Let’s talk,” he responded, the friendly undertone reduced just enough for his orders to hold weight. I did as commanded and sat myself down opposite him. With the man sitting directly opposite me, I could just barely make out his eyes through the shadow, piercing blue, and bleached teeth. A glass of whisky stood before me on the table, but I didn’t dare take a sip until the man on the other end lifted his glass, signaling for me to follow suit.

“What do you—” I tried to ask, only to be cut off by the man.

“Ah-ah-ah, first we drink,” reaching out his glass to gently tap mine. “Tell me, Mr. Cranston, do you know the history behind the toast?”  

I shook my head.

“Historians say it came about because of a man’s fear that his drink might have been poisoned,” he began as he lifted his glass demonstratively. “But quick of wit, the man held his cup up and clanked it towards those of his advisories, making sure his drink sloshed over into every single one of their beverages. The idea was simple—if he were to die that night, he would take each of them with him in death.”

I sat there; my glass firmly planted in my hands. I wasn’t sure how to respond.

“It was an inherent act of distrust by a paranoid man. And this—” he went on as he gently tapped his glass onto mine once more. “This must be a sign of trust.”

He took a sip, and I followed suit, coughing as I did. At the ripe old age of seventeen, I hadn’t yet had the chance to sample the finer vintages of life, but I didn’t dare reject his offer.

“Inexperience, but I admire your youth,” he said. “Now that we’ve established trust. Now we can talk.”

“Talk about what?”

“Well, what happens to you next,” he explained.

“What do you mean?”

“You’ve entered this house uninvited. By the laws of your own country, I could kill you and proclaim that I merely followed the ‘stand-your-ground’ principle. I’d get away scot-free, and you’d be dead for the simple crime of trespassing.”

He smiled, a friendly juxtaposition to what he was suggesting. I glanced behind me, looking for a window, or a door I could flee through, but where there had once been a window to peer our through, and a wall covered in comforting décor, now stood a solid, concrete wall.  

“How are you doing this?” I asked.

“Just a minute ago I told you the time for asking questions had ended. So, if you intend to keep asking, make sure it’s the right one.”

Following his suggestion, I kept my mouth shut as I mulled over what I needed to know. He didn’t strike me as a man fond of playing games. He clearly wanted something from me. 

“Oh, you know what the question is, don’t you?” he asked as his smile grew wider.

“What do you want from me?” I finally let out.

“And that—” he paused, “is the right question.”

He put his drink down, pulling a bundle of papers that seemed to magically appear from within his sleeve. Each was filled to the brim in printed words, all in a language and an alphabet I couldn’t even begin to comprehend.

“What’s that?” I tried to ask, only to be shushed once more.

“Patience,” he demanded. “All will be revealed when the mouth closes and the ears open.”

He sorted out the documents, skimming through thousands of unintelligible words in mere seconds.

“Your life was forfeit the moment you entered these premises—it’s not an opinion, it’s a fact. Whether you follow the laws of your lands or the rules from mine, you offered up your own soul once you crossed the threshold of our domain.”

Pearls of sweat had began forming on my forehead, obviously noticeable by the creature before me, who I started to understand was no man at all. The fact just seemed to widen his smile even further.

“There, there. I am offering you a bargain,” he explained.

“What kind of bargain?”

“Isn’t it obvious? I want you to work for me.”

“Work for you?”

“If you’re going to repeat everything I say, this is going to take a long time.”

“Sorry,” I replied out of instinct.

He sighed. “People don’t visit this place as frequently anymore. Not since the invention of the internet, smartphones, social media. You people have the attention span of ostriches.”

“Ostriches?” I had to ask.

“Ridiculously low brain to body ratio.”

Refocusing on the matter at hand, I kept pressing for answers.

“So, you want me to bring people here?”

“Ah, isn’t he the clever boy,” he let out sarcastically.

“Bring them here for what?”

“That’s none of your concern,” he said, his smile vanishing for the first time in minutes.

“You’re going to hurt them,” I half asked, half stated.  

“Yes. I’m going to hurt them a lot,” he said matter-of-factly.

“Why would I help you hurt people?”

“Because I can offer you the thing you desire the most.”

“And what is that?”

“Absolution.”

The promise of such a reward was enough to render me speechless, but the man didn’t seem surprised at all. He just stared at me, penetrating my eyes and entering the realm of my darkest secrets.

“That’s right, Mr. Cranston. I know what you’ve done. And while forgiveness is not in your species’ nature, it is a part of mine.”

I still couldn’t bring myself to respond.

“Ah, the guilt runs too deep. To find yourself responsible for the downfall of your fellow men. But fear not, young Mr. Cranston. These are not innocent people. While you will have free choice of subjects to provide me, I will aid in seeking out the worst mankind has to offer.”

“But… how am I supposed to get people to follow me?” I asked.

“You were convinced,” he replied. “You’ll figure it out. But first you have to sign your contract.”

He held one of the papers out in one hand, with a quill in the other. I hesitated as I reached out to grab it, but the man was patient, holding it before me without moving an inch, allowing me to contemplate my fate.

“You can bring me the worst people in the world, or the best, if that’s what floats your boat. But I don’t think it’s the latter. There’s something within you, something that yearns for justice.”

“What if I refuse?” I asked.

“Then you’ll get to see where I came from.”

I didn’t even dare ask what that meant, the malice that had appeared in his eyes spoke more than a thousand words. But the look of dread was quickly replaced by the same friendly smile he’d worn throughout most of our conversation, this time formed into half a smirk. He knew I was going to sign. I grabbed the quill, and quickly jotted down my name, feeling an intense burn within my chest as I did.

“Ow,” I yelped. “What was that?”

“Just a reassurance.”

I took a few deep breaths, waiting as the pain faded.

“Now, before you leave, let me give you some advice,” the man said. “I know you’re new to the job, so let me get you started with the names of possible subjects. I only require one subject a year, starting next Halloween, and the list follows your heart’s desire of getting rid of the more unsavory sort. These people, each of them, have committed actions deserving of a fate worse than death. Taking them to me, quite frankly, is more than they deserve.”

He produced a list out of thin air, as he had with the contract. I skimmed through, realizing that with names alone I’d have no idea of reliably finding the right person.

“I don’t even know who these people are,” I explained.

“Keep reading.”

There near the bottom of the list, stood a name I knew all too well, a person I had considered a friend since I’d been able to form memories: Zander Kevins.

“Zander…” I gasped. “But why—you promised—”

“I promised the people on the list would deserve their fate. I didn’t mean based on who they are *now* in this moment but based on who they’ll become within their short lifespan here on Earth. And your friend, Zander, is not a good person.”

“You can’t judge people based on what they might do. People can change.”

“It’s astonishing that you think you have a say in the matter. Every person on that list is a person you’ll encounter at some point during your life. You don’t have to choose all of them. You can leave little Zander to his own devices. But trust me, that once you see the man he’ll inevitably become, you’ll wish you’d put him out of his misery sooner.”

“One person a year?”

“On Halloween.”

I nodded in agreement.

“That concludes today’s meeting. I’ll see you in a year, Mr. Cranston.”

“Wait… what about the baby?” I asked.

He shot me a confused glance, though I could tell me knew what I meant.

“The baby upstairs. I heard it crying.”

“If you were ready, you wouldn’t have to ask.”

With that the room transformed back to its abandoned self. The light extinguished, and the doors, windows, and faded wallpaper returned. I got up from my seat and rushed outside, venturing through the markedly shorter hallway. At that point, the house of horrors had turned into what could be any old, unkempt building.  

Outside I was met by Zander and Devon, who seemed oddly disappointed at my presence back outside.

“Well, that was quick,” Zander announced.

“What?” was all I could ask, nervous sweat still dropping down my forehead, and my face pale as a sheet.

“So, you just went in and turned off the light? What was it? Was there anyone in there?” Devon inquired.

The Moon still hung low in the sky. I glanced down at my watch, noting that it was barely half past eight. I had only been in there for two minutes, yet hours had passed as I talked to the Keeper. I couldn’t tell them the truth, but I was too flustered to come up with a clever lie.

“It was just a lamp,” I explained. “Uh, battery driven. Probably left behind as a prank.”

“Well, that’s disappointing. But I suppose you’re off the hook, then,” Zander said. “Let’s go do something worthwhile, we’re getting too old for this shit.”  

I had escaped unscathed, but with a promise of servitude. Though I was in immediate danger, [things were only getting started. ](https://www.facebook.com/richard.saxon.author)
