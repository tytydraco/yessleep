I was the lead singer in a rock band. My intent was to get famous and eventually convert the band to a Christian rock group, using my influence and stardom to bring my listeners into the light of Christianity. I didn’t realize how hard it was to make it in the music industry until the bills racked up, and our group was just a name among endless waves of starving artists.

I called Lucifer knowing he was the only one who could grant me immediate success. I thought if I kept my intentions pure, the Lord could surely forgive me if I brought more people into the light. Lucifer came when I called, he stayed in the corner of my bedroom. His figure was concealed by darkness, but his black eyes somehow penetrated all that was dark and stayed visible, watching me, allowing me to see he had heard me.

I asked him for my band to become famous and influential in exchange for my soul. I truly believed God would forgive me and somehow save me for this. Lucifer never spoke directly, only a hissing sound in my head relayed the word “Deal”. I heard him snap his fingers, and just like that he was gone.

My senses drowned in fear when the judge sentenced me to death. I never remembered going to the celebration party for our newly released album, or taking the drugs they found in my system. I never even remembered holding a gun in my life, let alone blowing the brains out of every one of my band members.

Somehow it happened though. The witnesses said I just stood there, looking possessed. The incident hit headlines and my band’s music became famous, not for the true meaning of the content of its messages, but because every conspiracy theorist and satanist thought some hidden underlying message laid in there somewhere. They analyzed the lyrics, meant to be positive, as some hidden agenda for evil things, but it wasn’t.

My band’s name was talked about all over the media, they were famous for all the reasons against my intentions. I became influential, but not for what I wanted. I receive fan mail on death row from crazy kids and females that idolize serial killers, not the kind of people I could have ever converted.

My own parents and friends refused to visit me as I sat in my cell counting the days before I meet my inevitable end.  My thoughts spin in a whirlwind of questions every day, wondering if there can be any forgiveness for me when my intent was pure.   

I wonder if it will hurt when the day of my execution comes.  Maybe the injection that will eventually stop my heart and wipe my conscious from existence won’t be so bad at least, I hope. 

My ex-girlfriend was the only person who managed to give me a visit as I am nearing the final days until the end. 

 

She allowed me to borrow her phone and make my last goodbyes to anyone that would hear me as well as write out my last thoughts on whatever forum I could find. 

When the guard initially took me to the visiting area to meet my girlfriend, he looked back at me before walking away. His eyes turned black for the briefest second, and he winked.
