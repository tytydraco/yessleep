Has anyone noticed how weird google ads have been getting recently?

The other night, after coming in late from an activity, showering off, cleaning up etc., I sat down to enter my usual routine of searching up meme stocks and gaming news. 

I read up on a few tidbits here and there, caught up on some world events and was getting to the point where I was just about ready to log off for the night (before obviously reading more reddit posts and memes on my phone in bed) when my eye happened to catch one of those sponsored posts that now shows up at the top of every single search.

It read like this:

"hAVe you been TIRED LATELY? TRY this new (ILLEGAL) activity"

I smirked a bit. Guess advertisers have been getting better at imitating the worst youtubers.

Against my better instincts I decided to click it only to be brought to a blank page with a loading icon on it.

I sat around for a couple seconds, then a couple more, before eventually getting mildly bored but not quite enough to close the page.

Instead I decided to head back to the google page to read over the description for the ad.

It read like this: 

"yOU can GET MIND INSIGHT VARIABLE POWER if you just wAIT and watch!!!!!"

I would've worried about getting a virus at this point but my computer was already a piece of crap and I did all my secure browsing from my phone so I really didn't care.

I flicked over to the open tab and saw that it loaded and was showing a grainy video feed.

It was a normal backyard, that for a second I thought was my own, which made me very paranoid that I would be found out, but after looking at how the bushes were displayed and the various lawn ornaments, which included a horribly ugly garden gnome, I realized it wasn't.

It was a small yard, with white picket fences and was empty. The lighting made it appear to be night-time but the black and white of the video made it hard to tell either way.

There was no movement. 

My curiosity now suitably aroused, I sized the window over to one side so I could observe for any activity, while opening another google window to search for "weird google ad that shows video footage of empty yard." (the literal searches always work 10% of the time, sue me).

I didn't get much aside from some people complaining about security cam issues (like perhaps their complete lack of security and reliability, something with which I am intimately familiar).

But there was another ad:

"I SEE YOU, SEEING ME, WE ARE KIN AND I KNOW YOU ARE INTERESTED"

Below it the description read: 

"Where were you just now?"

I was suitably unsettled by this, but chalked it up to some sort of spooky horror movie ad campaign. 

I did always love those slasher flicks so I decided to click on this one too.

Another loading screen, another minute to render, and then a video feed of the same backyard showing that same ugly gnome and now the house, which was a single story bungalow that looked cheaply made in the 1950s.

Still no movement.

I audibly sighed. What was this wretched world coming to when even advertisers who had already gotten you to click on their ads still didn't deliver the fucking goods.

I resized some more windows so I now had a panoramic view of the mysterious house and backyard before popping open YouTube.

I'd be damned if I'd let this ad beat me and so I would sit there and watch movie clips until the fucking video actually displayed something of note.

Before I could even start playing a video on YouTube a pop-up ad jumped up.

All it said was "NOW LOOK."

There was a girl in the video feed. Except she wasn't alone.

She was being dragged by a large man with a hood on into the middle of the yard where the fences provided coverage from the neighbours.

I could see that she was screaming, that she was dirty and malnourished with stick-thin arms and legs streaked in dirt, like she'd been living in a hole or something.

The man slapped her twice hard before jumping onto her arm with full force, snapping it in two. She convulsed then stopped struggling.

Before she could get up the man had walked off camera. 

He came back dragging an axe.

As much as I'd like to tell you exactly how he dismembered this woman while keeping her alive for as long as possible, I'd prefer not to reveal the secrets of people like us.

Because you see, I had just come back from a very similar activity, having showered and cleaned off the remnants of gristle and gore from an ex of mine who I had just disposed of, in what I now consider a much less impressive way. I mean what's a slit throat and a couple stab wounds, to a calculated tearing apart?

I think I know why these ads were shown to me.

I think I've been chosen by the best of us and I think we like to share ideas about how to deal with victims.

I opened up google again and started buying streamer gear before purchasing an ad campaign for an old domain of mine. Funnily enough, google gave me the option to make the ad show to only people similar to me.

The ad reads:

"CLICK NOW TO SEE WHAT IT IS THAT MAKES LIFE WORTH LIVING"

"It's more fun than you think!"
