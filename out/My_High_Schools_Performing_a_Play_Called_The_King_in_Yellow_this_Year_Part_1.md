I'd never heard of *The King in Yellow* until they announced what the school play was gonna be this year. This was strange. It wasn't like our theater department to put on something obscure. Last year we did *Oklahoma* for the seventeenth time in our schools 80 year history.

But the theater department had changed hands sense last year. Our old drama teacher Mr. Woodrow  fell down his stairs last summer, and after the school realized that he wasn't leaving his coma in time to join us in the fall they replaced him with Mr. Castaigne.

Just from passing him in the hallway you can tell that he's strange. He's always muttering to himself, and sometimes he just starts laughing even though no-one said anything. His laughs are loud too. You'll be in a class with the door shut and then you swear you hear someone screaming outside, but then the scream stops and begins again and keeps stoping and starting until you realize it's not actually screaming just a pale, warped, imitation of laughter.

Creepy shit.

Anyways, I don't really like Mr. Castaigne, but I didn't like Mr. Woodrow that much either. He always wanted me to do warm up games with the cast, even though I was crew, which was pretty stupid. So the staff change was a pretty neutral experience to me.

Also I would like to clarify that, while yes I run the lights for the school play and have done for the past two years, I am not a "Theater Kid". I don't know the lyrics to *Hamilton*, I've never seen *Wicked*, and I don't randomly break into song for no reason. I don't even spend that much time with the Theater Kids in the cast. I just stay in my little booth and press the buttons when the script says it's my cue.

The talent in our theater department is pretty average for a high school by which I mean all of our actors are very bad. Even the people who get the leading roles are just kind of okay.

Frank's confident and jacked but he can't act, or sing, or remember his lines. He also misses a lot of rehearsals for sports practice of some kind. (I don't remember what he plays and I don't really care.) 

Chris can actually sing and maybe he can act, it's just hard to tell because he talks so quietly. 

Claire's alright as an actor but so annoying as a person it more than cancels out. She acts like one of those popular girl characters you see in movies even though no-one outside the theater department knows who she is.

The only person who's actually good is Emily. I mean she's not like a professional actor or anything but she's leagues above everyone else. She's nice too, if a little pushy. She kept trying to get me to eat lunch with the cast during rehearsals last year.

Anyways auditions were last week, and callbacks were a few days ago. Today I was eating lunch in the library when Claire walked up to me.

"Hi." She said like running into me was a surprise. Like she just happened to be in the library and saw a friend. I new this was false because I don't think Claire has read a book since she discovered S*park Notes* in middle school, and I know that she does not like me very much.

"What do you want?" I said.

"Could you talk to Mr. Castaigne for me?"

"Why?"

"We all wanna know what roles we're getting. There are two female leads and I know me and Emily are getting them because I mean who else? Lucy Inman?" (Lucy Inman is very bad at acting.) "The question is just which one of us gets which. I think I'll probably get the singing role because Emily, bless her, is-"

"No, I meant why do you need me to do it?"

"Mr. Castaigne hates us, remember?" 

I'd forgotten about that.

Almost everyone who signed up to do theater after school this year was also taking theater class during school. From what I heard Mr. Castaigne wasn't any less strange once you got to know him and apparently on the class group chat (because of course they made a class group chat) they were talking shit and he found out. I remember exactly what day it was too, because the chemistry classroom is right above the theater classroom and you could hear him screaming through the concrete floor.

So now everyone who was in that group chat is on his shit list.

"Why should I help you?" I asked.

"I mean what are you so busy with right now?" I decided that I would rather go and talk to Mr. Castaigne than tell Claire I was spending my lunch playing "Smash Karts" on my computer, so off I went.

I'd been in the room before, back when it was Mr. Woodrow's Office, but Mr. Castaigne had clearly redecorated. All  the pictures of Mr. Woodrow's loving family of four that had covered the walls were gone, as was any of the theater themed nicknacks that had covered his desk. The only things that had been added to the room where a large safe on top of his desk and strange painting on one of the walls.

I had a lot of time to stare at the strange yellow shape, because after letting me in, Mr. Castaigne said nothing. He just stared at me for what felt like minutes.

"Mr. Castaigne?" I finally said. Sixteen seconds of silence (I counted) followed. I noticed just how tall Mr. Castaigne was. Then suddenly he leaned in so close to me that I jolted back instinctively.

"You did the lights for *Oklahoma.*" His voice was quiet but his face was so close to mine that I could not only hear but feel every word that left his mouth. "They were good, but for this project" He smiled like he was telling me a very funny secret, "we will need to step things up."

Just then, as quickly has he leaned in he stood up from his chair and handed me a book from under his desk. It was a copy of *The King in Yellow*.

"Read it." He said. "It has changed my life, it will change yours, and soon it will change everything." 

I only realize that I'd forgotten to ask him about the casting now that I'm writing this. I was just so relieved to get out of there.

So that brings us to now. I'm mostly just posting this because I think everything going on is kind of strange and I want to document it, but if anyone knows anything about a play called *The King in Yellow* please tell me. I think I'll read the copy Mr. Castaigne gave me soon anyways, but if there's context I should know going in please tell me. I'll update if anything else happens.
