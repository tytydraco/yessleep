It started with loneliness and boredom. As most horrendous things I do start,   
  
Sunday nights make me feel particularly lonely - I live sort of in the middle of nowhere, the only company I get is crickets chirping and the occasional truck roaring with some insane death metal.   
  
Both of these are quite the opposite of the soft gentle voice that a girlfriend would have. I however didn’t have one of those. I know - typical redditor stuff, but I was actively trying to change that. Skincare routines and Sleep schedules can only help ya so much right? I mean I must have been missing out on something. And the loneliness gets to you, especially if your last girlfriend was with you fifteen years ago. The silent nights of just doom scrolling and strolls in the middle of bumfuck nowhere were sort of getting to me.  
  
Now being a redditor, I had also pondered the thought of a sex doll. Nothing to really be ashamed of for sure, but still not the best on the conscience. If I really wanted to fuck plastic and silicone, I would have done so a while ago - maybe even strap an AI to its head for that sweet sweet emotional support. But no, I still wasn’t ready to be that pathetic. At least that’s what I thought.  
  
A week ago, I noticed an ad on some random internet forum, it was a pop up one, akin to the ‘HOT MILFS IN YOUR AREA’ type of ads from some generic website along the lines of neck romance.je. I was about to scroll past it when I noticed something interesting. Out in the right corner of that square ad , it said in a crisp, clean font - 3D printed girlfriend - Feels just like the REAL THING! Added Emotional Support!   
  
What really caught my eye was the bottom text. It said something to the effect of being able to get a refund within seven days. Which was pretty unusual - The general company wouldn’t want your jizz and sweat returned back to the sender. This had to be something different.   
  
I violated my instincts and clicked on the link. It took me to a jarring neon green webpage. Just a single button   
  
ORDER NOW 60$ - CASH  
  
I clicked on it, I could cut back on the cigarettes for a week or two if I could get a girlfriend. And I could smoke packs more after the refund if she wasn’t what I wanted. The low-price tag rung several alarm bells in my head- but I was too excited to care. I would forever regret clicking that button, but a week older and much hornier me would have no clue.  
  
I went back to watching whatever pathetic show I was binging and thought nothing of it.  
  
I woke up to a series of rapid knocks, separated from each other at irregular time intervals.  
  
The LED clock above the door flashed 2 AM.  
  
I grabbed the pistol that usually sat under my bed. I should have used it on myself, but I wouldn’t know that then.  
  
The digital display showed me a tall man on the other side of the door- wearing a suit and a tie. In his hands was what seemed to be a box with some sort of metal brick thing. He didn’t seem hostile. Against my better instinct I opened the door.  
  
What the fuck ma-  
  
Your order, Sir.  
  
Which one?  
  
The 3D printed Girlfriend, Sir?  
  
Why the fuck would you be out here delivering it at 2 in the fuckin morning, my guy?  
  
My pistol was still hidden under my back, maybe I should have shot it then.  
  
You ordered it at odd hours, we delivered within forty-five minutes!  
  
Now if you’ll follow me to the assembly point!  
  
I looked at him, he seemed perfectly normal like a regular delivery guy - with a suit and tie, and a box with something metallic in it. He was pointing to a sort of truck in the driveway.  
  
My monkeybrain kicked in. Hours of soulless corporate - if I was going to be organ trafficked under the premise of a slightly better titled and returnable sex doll, at least I would die feeling something.  
  
I walked behind him and entered the truck. It was empty, almost completely - save for a little box in the back.  
  
This is a prototype sir, so you must be okay with some glitches here and there.   
  
I nodded along like a fucking idiot, not knowing that sentence was going to be my bane.  
  
He pointed to the box,  
  
That’s the core - it’ll be placed into the body of the girlfriend, you won’t have to charge it or anything - because of its completely innovative idea.  
  
My. Brain. Didn’t. Fucking. Think. To. Ask. What. It. Was.  
  
The truck rumbled to a start. The driver showed the suit guy some sort of hand signal. We were cruising dead silent along the small path in the woods, we landed at a sort of fenced area, The delivery guy jumped out with a shovel and the box in hand. I tried to peek out the window but all I could see was an eerie view of the foggy woods. The driver began whistling and walking toward where I was seated.  
  
He pulled out a shovel of his own and exited.  
  
I should have run then.  
  
I remember falling asleep somehow - in all that deathly silence and eeriness.  
  
I awoke in my bed. Surely a sort of surreal dream, I thought to myself. Until I turned to the side.  
A woman lay there. Staring at me with open eyes.  
  
I jumped out of bed and reached for the pistol.   
  
FUCK   
  
It wasn’t there. The woman got up, I mean at least a part of her did - skin and hair fell off along with some other grimy blue liquid. Inhumane  
  
Oh, that’s what the fenced post was.  
  
A graveyard.  
  
I was looking at a corpse.  
  
My mind snapped back to the gravity of the situation. In my pocket, where my pistol should have been, was a letter.  
  
The woman stared at me, like a corpse reanimated. One Iris twitching rapidly while her neck was convulsing. She crouched her entire spine, taking a wobbly - semi crawl toward me. Her neck hung at an odd angle and shook repeatedly.  
  
Good morning, babe!  
  
Her voice was surprisingly feminine, nearly human almost - except for the soft gurgling of fluids in her throat when she talked. She wore an oversized shirt, a NIRVANA one. She had these horrible eye bags and these long fingernails.  
  
Even I wouldn’t fuck that.  
  
NO!  
  
Snap out of it you dumb fuck!  
  
  
It took another shaking step, retching blood on my white sheets.  
  
Read the letter, Read the letter, Read the letter.  
  
  
REFUNDABLE IN SEVEN DAYS, ATTEMPTED DESTRUCTION OF PRODUCT BEFORE DATE WILL RESULT IN TERMINATION OF CLIENT  
  
Fuck  
  
Fleshy weave like strips fell off as she stood up.   
  
She must have been pretty when she was alive.  
  
But now, at 4 in the fucking AM,  
  
I didn’t know if I could stand there for a minute more.  
  
A tendon shot out from the corpse and latched onto me.  
  
Do you want to slow dance?
