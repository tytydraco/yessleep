My mother was only 42 when she died. She had battled breast cancer for nearly 4 years before it took her life. This was nearly two years ago. It has been a devastating blow to my father and I. We were all very close to one another. 

My father is a top engineer at a Fortune 500 tech company. After her passing he would completely bury himself in his work. He has an office in our backyard that spends all day and night in. I don’t see him often since I’m in college a few states away, but I imagine the work keeps his mind busy. 

I came back recently for Winter break. He hasn’t been himself lately. It seems that he doesn’t let anyone into his office, EVER. He’s become extremely strict about that. He was never like this before my mom passed. 

He must be working on something big. I grew more and more curious as time went on. Whenever I’d ask about it, he’d tell me it was a top secret company project and wasn’t allowed to discuss it. I wish I would’ve just left it alone, but I couldn’t. One day, when he was out of the house I decided to check out his office. He keeps a spare key to it under his nightstand. 

As I stepped in, the place seemed pretty messy, my father has never been a clean freak. Coding textbooks, wires, and cables were scattered everywhere. What caught my eye the most was a giant screen in the center of the room, in front of it was a desk with all sorts of tech type stuff that I couldn’t identify. It was full of CDs, flash drives, and old video tapes. I noticed the labels on them; family vacation, wedding, and honeymoon. 

The gears in my head slowly started to turn, these were all home videos that included my mother. Had he been sitting alone all this time, just watching her? My heart sank at the thought. I heard a light buzzing sound, then the screen flipped on. It took a few seconds for me to process what I was seeing…it was her, it was my mom. The format was like a zoom call. It looked just like her before the cancer, she looked healthy and beautiful. It was her from the shoulders up, like she was attending a zoom call. I thought it was a recording, but then she spoke. 
“Hey there, sweetheart.” 

My heart began to race, this must be a trick. She can’t see me right now. This isn’t her, I’m just imagining things. 
“Mom?” I said, utterly bewildered. 
“Yes sweetheart, it’s me. How was your day?” 

Her voice, it sounded just like her. I hadn’t heard it in so long. I couldn’t believe how much I’d missed her. I began to tear up.
“Is something wrong? Why are you crying?” Her voice was so gentle and inviting, just like it had always been. On the screen it looked like she was reaching forward, that’s when I saw something on the desk move. It was covered in a sheet, so I took it off to reveal a small bio-mechanical hand; it was reaching toward me. I gripped it tightly with tears continuing to run down my face. It gripped back. 

It was so gentle, but also cold and mechanical. It all started to come together now. My father has spent the last two years trying to resurrect my mother. He has taken old video tapes and recordings of her and has attempted to recreate her digitally through AI. Judging from the hand, I had no doubt he planned to give her a physical form as well. 

It was all too much to process, I pushed the hand away and looked back at the screen. 
“It’s all going to be alright,” she said. 
I covered the hand back up and ran out of the office. 

That very night, I sat across my father at dinner. I didn’t say a word to him, just stared. It took a few minutes before he noticed, but once he did I didn’t look away. 
He eventually set his silverware down and wiped his mouth. 
Nonchalantly he asked, “so you went into my office, huh?” 
I nodded. 
“Well, what did you see?” 

I cracked a half-smile, embracing the absurdity of the entire situation. “Dad, you can’t bring her back like this. You can’t just resurrect someone with AI. It’s not her. This is crazy!”

He blankly stared ahead for a moment as he tried to process what I told him. This was probably the first time he’d been challenged.  He looked down at the floor with a hint of shame. I think he knows what he’s doing is insane, but I don’t think he can stop himself at this point. 
 
“Well, love makes you do crazy things,” he said. 

We didn’t speak about it again. Shortly after this, I went back to college. I’ll be back home for the Summer soon. I’m a bit terrified of what I’ll find when I get back, but if I’m being honest a small part of me is hoping that my father will succeed. I wonder if she’ll still recognize me when I get back.
