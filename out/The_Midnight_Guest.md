The old farmhouse had been in my family for generations, each owner adding their own layer of history. I’d moved in to escape the city’s chaos, hoping the quiet solitude would offer some peace. But from the moment I arrived, I felt a presence, a subtle unease that I couldn’t shake.

It started with the footsteps. Each night, around midnight, I would hear them echoing through the empty halls—slow, deliberate steps that seemed to approach my bedroom. I told myself it was just the old house settling or maybe my imagination playing tricks on me.

One night, unable to sleep, I decided to investigate. I crept through the dimly lit house, the moonlight casting long, eerie shadows. The footsteps continued, leading me to the basement door. My heart raced as I opened it, revealing a staircase that descended into darkness. I hesitated but descended anyway, drawn by a mixture of fear and curiosity.

The basement was cold and musty. Old furniture covered in white sheets lined the walls. In the center of the room stood a large, ornate mirror, its glass fogged and cracked. As I approached, I noticed a peculiar detail—the reflection in the mirror seemed to show something different than the basement I was in. Behind me, within the mirror, I saw a figure standing still, watching me.

I spun around, but the basement was empty. I turned back to the mirror, my breath visible in the cold air. The figure in the reflection was clearer now: a gaunt man with hollow eyes, his face twisted into a mournful expression. His hand was raised, pointing at a spot behind me.

Fear gripped me, but I forced myself to look. There, on the floor behind me, was an old diary, its leather cover cracked and worn. I picked it up, opening it to find pages filled with frantic, scrawled writing. It was a journal of a man named Jonathan Gray, a previous owner of the house who had vanished decades ago.

The entries spoke of a sinister entity that visited him at midnight. It whispered promises of eternal life in exchange for companionship. Jonathan described how he had attempted to escape but was always drawn back to the mirror, where the entity waited, offering its dark bargain.

As I read, I felt a cold breath on the back of my neck. I turned to see the figure from the mirror now standing in front of me, his eyes hollow and accusing. He reached out with a skeletal hand, and I felt a cold, paralyzing grip on my arm.

Desperately, I slammed the diary shut and ran up the stairs. The footsteps followed me, louder and more urgent. I bolted to my bedroom, locking the door behind me. But as I lay in bed, shivering under the covers, I could still hear the footsteps pacing outside my door, growing closer and closer.

Suddenly, the door creaked open. I knew I had locked it. The figure from the mirror was now in my room, his eyes glowing with a ghostly light. His hand reached out toward me, and I felt an overwhelming sense of dread. I wanted to scream, but no sound escaped my lips.

The last thing I remember was the icy touch of his hand, and then everything went black. When I awoke, it was morning, and the house was eerily quiet. The mirror was gone, and the basement was just an empty room. The diary was nowhere to be found.

But the whispers have not stopped. Every night, at midnight, I hear them growing louder, promising me the same fate that befell Jonathan Gray. And every night, I wait in fear, knowing that the midnight guest will return, seeking another soul to join him in the mirror’s eternal darkness.
