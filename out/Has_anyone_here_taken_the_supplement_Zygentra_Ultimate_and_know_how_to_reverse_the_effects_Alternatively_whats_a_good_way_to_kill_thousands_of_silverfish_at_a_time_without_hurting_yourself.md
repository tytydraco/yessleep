I’ve made a few mistakes in my life. Hell, maybe more than a few. Somewhere between a handful and a fuck-ton is probably a good estimation. I think the issue is I put my trust in the wrong places, but I’m just trying to navigate the world as best I can - same as everyone else. I’ve been told I’m gullible, but I like the word “*suggestible”*. Let me put it this way: my beliefs and convictions can be like loose flower petals on a blustery day - they drift in whatever way the wind pushes them. One moment I’m floating east, the wind changes direction, and now I’m floating west. One day, I’ll believe in climate change, then I listen to a certain popular podcast, and now I think it’s a hoax. I know that it’s pathetic. If I can just make it through this year, I swear I’ll change, but my savings are depleted, and the pills are running out. I can hear them all skittering and slamming all around me, just out of sight, biding their time until the effects of the medication to wear off.

This all began a few weeks back. My life was unremarkable then, but at least it was normal. I had a cushy job at a local tech company, the same one I’ve had for the last five years. Reasonable hours, good benefits plan, 6 weeks of paid time off - I lived comfortably but noticeably alone. No wife, no girlfriend. I wasn’t born with a lot of charm. I was never very proficient at initiating pleasantries, and even if I did manage to start a conversation with a lady, I couldn’t find the words to maintain it. Of course, that would all be one thing if I was some hulking adonis, smooth and chiseled and all that - maybe then I could have compensated for my lack of a silver tongue. But I could never grow any muscle despite my efforts. I bought and tried a lot of different supplements that were supposed to help stimulate growth. Powders with names like “Muscle Matrix” and “Crazy Muscle”. They never did a damn thing, even put me in the hospital one time for kidney damage.

Retrospectively, I should have also been working out while on those supplements. I wanted to wait until the supplements started having an effect before I began really working out.

Terrible cystic acne was the icing on top. Red, painful craters had littered my face since I turned 16. Tried everything for that too - bee venom, reiki, power juicing. None of the online recommendations produced the desired effect. And it all gave me the impression that I was utterly unworthy compared to other guys my age. I could feel myself giving up on a life that was more fulfilling than the one I already had, and on companionship. Then, I saw the ad pop on my Facebook page. It promised to fix me, and I fell for it. Hook, line, and sinker. 

It read something like this:

*Do you have trouble attracting women? Unable to catch a vixen’s eye from all the way at the other end of the bar? Does your mere presence in a room inspire overwhelming, knee-buckling repulsion from any potential mates? Before the modern age, there were no solutions. Lonely devils would go to their doctors, looking for salvation, only instead to be told there was nothing else to be done - Western Medicine cursing them to die alone. But we don’t live in the past, do we, dear friends? With major advancements in natural attraction technology, L. Bartleby, Ph.D., is proud to announce: Zygentra Ultimate, the miracle medication for the misbegotten common man. With Zygentra Ultimate, even the lowliest bachelor has hope for a happy ending. One pill is all it takes to change everything about you.* 

In big, confident words, the bottom said:

*One payment, one pill - one solution to the problem of you.*

Even though the advertisement omitted what it would improve about me, I was intrigued. The ad had all the buzz words - “miracle”, “technology”, “happy ending”. Their distrust of Western Medicine hit close to home, too. As far as I was concerned, doctors were pill pushers controlled by pharmaceutical companies that pulled their marionette strings from the shadows. I mean, what was in the pills they recommended, anyway? And for that matter, why can’t I pronounce half the compounds that make up vaccines? Thiomersal, Polysorbate 80 - I mean formaldehyde, for Christ’s sake. It all felt so artificial and unsafe. But this advertisement seemed to promote something more “of the earth” and “organic”, the so-called “natural attraction technology”. Tired of being lonely and unworthy, I emailed the company. 

Like I said, hook, line, and sinker. Biggest mistake of my life.

In my message to the company, I tried to perform my due diligence in vetting the supplement. What was in it? How much was the supplement? Would it interact with the Chinese muscle-enhancing herbs I ordered the week before? 

This was their response, copy-pasted from my Gmail:

*Greetings Zach,*

*Thank you for your interest in Zygentra Ultimate. One pill, one payment, one solution to the problem of you.* 

*To clarify, Zygentra is a medication, not a supplement - though no matter what you call it, it is a miracle. Through a proprietary mechanism of action that utilizes the wonders of CRISPR technology, Zygentra enables the human body to naturally self-regulate the hormonal disequilibriums that are to blame for a variety of male inequities: it can resolve poor muscle growth, weak libidos, erectile dysfunction, and a bevy of disfiguring skin conditions including but not limited to: seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis, lichen planus simplex, and cystic acne.* 

*Unfortunately, the future is not always affordable, and it is rarely covered by insurance. Thankfully, this onetime cost can last upwards of a year, if not much longer. Zygentra teaches your body to produce life-changing pheromones that are genetically transplanted from the naturally occurring Lepisma saccharium species. In short, one pill is all you need.* 

*Zygentra Ultimate can solve the problem of you with a onetime payment of 30,000 US dollars. We do not accept payment plans. Also, for obvious reasons, we recommend all of our clients relocate prior to taking their dose; Antarctica is preferable, but Northern Canada is a reasonable alternative.* 

*Please let us know if you are planning to pursue a happy ending. If so, we can help set up a wire transfer.* 

*Amy,*

I had to pick my jaw off the floor after I finished quickly scanning the email, skipping the scientific mumbo-jumbo to find the price point. They seriously wanted me to pay 30,000 dollars, one lump sum, for this supplement. Not that I couldn’t afford the payment - I could, but barely, using a nest egg my mom left for me after she passed. It was just an obscene amount of money. But it was alluring - one pill that would fix my body, or I guess teach it to fix itself, naturally? Was that even possible? When I thought about it more, the exorbitant fee made it feel more legitimate, like I was paying for cutting-edge technology that actually could work. Wouldn’t the Better Business Bureau prevent a company from selling a product for much more than it was worth? Wasn’t that illegal? 

To speed things up, I’ll skip the part where I contemplated my options, did a lot of online research, and signed a waiver that Amy mailed to me. Two weeks later, the singular pill arrived in an icebox as an overnight shipment from the Delfoy Pharmaceuticals headquarters. Amy told me they needed to keep it cold. 

It wasn’t like any pill I had taken before. The supplement more resembled an extra-large piece of caviar - gelatinous and orb-shaped. The box had no instructions, so I shrugged my shoulders and ingested it, using a swig of the nearest open Mountain Dew to wash it down.

I was ready not to be alone anymore. 

No big change the first few days. Maybe I really was a sap, I thought. But one morning, while looking in the mirror, I noticed it - my skin was clearing up like it never had before. More than that, I felt virile and confident, out of the blue. My muscles even looked more toned. It was a state of being entirely new to me, and at first, it was incredible. For the first time, I felt deserving of love and happiness. Riding that sensation for all it was worth, I asked Stacy, an attractive coworker, on a dinner date. I had fantasized about asking her out for what seemed like my entire life. She said yes. The ecstasy I experienced after that moment was unparalleled. It was like some heavy, invisible weights had been taken off my shoulders. We planned a dinner date at a local Italian place later that week. With the supplement coursing through my veins, I felt unstoppable and was pleasantly surprised by the lack of side effects. I had experienced some new floaters in my peripheral vision and mild armpit pain, but that was it.

At first, the date was everything I could have hoped for. Stacy always had an aura of kindness about her - she was angelic, honestly. It’s what drew me towards her. Even though I secured the date, I was still nervous about my ability to keep up a conversation through the meal. To my surprise, it wasn’t difficult. Because I was different, improved by the supplement, I guess I just wasn’t as fearful of rejection anymore. I was stunned to discover Stacy had been secretly planning to ask me out too.

*“Over the last week? Since I started my new skin regimen, I mean.”* I said, choking on the last few words because I was never very good at lying. I didn’t want to scare Stacy off by volunteering the information that I had recently purged my bank accounts to pay for Zygentra. 

She giggled, a cute and tiny laugh that made my heart swell with affection.

*“No, nothing to do with whatever new moisturizer you invested in. And a lot longer than just this week. For at least a year, I think. I always found you handsome, and you were always polite to me and everyone else in the office - a good sign of character. You were just quiet and reserved. I couldn’t tell if you’d say yes if I asked, so I never did. A bit childish and cowardly, I know, but sometimes I just feel small and out of place in the world, if that makes any sense,”* remarked Stacy, eyes diverting from mine while she made this confession.  

Her words felt familiar - or maybe not her words; it was the way she put the words together. The underlying self-deprecation, I mean. She had some venomous monologue playing on a loop in her head, just like I did. Broke my heart at first, and I wasn’t sure how to respond. But I noticed at that moment that I felt a little less lonely for the first time in my adult life. I smiled, met her eyes, and came up with the most ornate, reverent statement I could to comfort her and let her know I understood.

*“You’re an absolute vision, Stacy. Like, you’re radiant. I’m sorry it’s hard for you to see it sometimes, but I really get that pain.”*

Her expression changed, now warm and relaxed, and I could tell I actually managed to console her. I got lost in that moment then, in the beautiful comfort of it. Even as I type it up, I find myself getting lost in the memory of it. But something hoicked me out of the moment then, and it’s the same thing that’s pulling me out of its memory now: terrible, skittering things on the outskirts of my vision. 

In the restaurant, I was experiencing worsening floaters in my periphery, but I was too transfixed on Stacy to notice something was off - that maybe they weren’t just floaters. As our dessert arrived, I felt something vibrating in the sole of my dress shoe. It really gave me a start, and I reflexively stomped my right foot onto the floor, surprising Stacy in turn. I took off my shoe to examine its contents, only to find the crushed body of a silverfish. Its greyish carapace was split into three asymmetric pieces from the force of my stomp. Each piece was still wriggling a little bit, and I felt nausea rise in my stomach. 

It was bigger than any silverfish I’d ever seen before, too. In my experience, they never grew larger than an inch. This silverfish was *easily* 5 inches long, if not more. I could count at least 20 other, equally large silverfish crawling around in a wobbly circle, with me as the center. Before I killed the insect in my shoe, the other dinner goers had noticed the bugs and were flagging down restaurant staff to complain. At first, I was with them - what kind of restaurant serves food with this type of infestation? It took the tickling, wriggling feeling of something crawling up my left pant leg to cause me to re-evaluate the situation. 

Wildly, I made a circle with my thumb and index finger and tightened it around my knee, pushing down the length of my calf in an attempt to expel what I knew were more silverfish before they found their way higher into my pants. When my palm first connected with my knee, I felt a sickening crunch under the tip of my index finger. The maneuver pushed out three silverfish - one headless from being caught in the crossfire of my hand meeting my knee. When I looked up, the restaurant was in a state of pandemonium. At that point, there were definitely over 20, maybe 100 or 200, silverfish radiating in a circle around me. It finally registered - whatever was happening, I was the cause, and I hadn’t been experiencing floaters before - I was seeing silverfish skittering around in my peripheral vision. 

I shot up from my chair, frightening Stacy again, accompanied by the sensation of another crunch in the shoe I hadn’t yet taken off. I said something to my date, couldn’t tell you what, and I excused myself from the table while moving towards the door. Outside in the parking lot, I began sprinting to my car with only one shoe on; but then I remembered I had driven Stacy here. I briefly turned around to get her, but I could see gleaming silver little bullets racing to catch up to me on the asphalt, lit up by the sparkle of parking lot lights. I U-turned and sprinted even faster to my car, got in, and just started driving. After 15 minutes, I pulled over and urgently emailed Delfoy Pharmaceuticals from my phone. I wanted to know how to reverse the effects of Zygentra Ultimate.

Not long after I parked, I saw silverfish on the front windshield, leaking into the car through whatever cracks they could find. I floored it, but it was in a park, so I went nowhere. For the third time that night, I again felt the snap of their brittle bodies against my foot, having just crushed another two silverfish. A moment later, I felt one making its way up my left earlobe. I whipped my head to the right so hard that my neck would later be painfully sore, but the force launched a silverfish off my ear to somewhere in the back of my sedan. Putting the car in drive, I exploded down the country road I had parked on. I kept driving, killing silverfish as I went, till I heard an inbox notification come from my iphone, which was about two hours after I had sent the email:

*Hello Zach,*

*I am sorry to hear you are disappointed with our product. Unfortunately, there is no reversal agent for Zygentra Ultimate. I thought I made this very clear in our introductory email, and you did sign a release saying you understood the risk-benefit profile of the medication.* 

*To re-explain, Zygentra Ultimate utilizes CRISPR technology to give the human body the ability to produce pheromones from Lepisma saccharium, the most common species of silverfish in America. Laboratory studies have shown that these pheromones can help with male sexual dysfunction and certain skin conditions due to an anti-inflammatory effect. As you must know, pheromones are designed to attract members of the opposite sex of the species producing them. It is basically a big sign around an animal’s neck saying: “I am ready to mate”. Therefore, we recommend relocation to Northern Canada or Antarctica in conjunction with Zygentra Ultimate - these are some of the few areas in the world that Lepisma saccharium does not naturally inhabit.* 

*The medication is not reversible, however, because CRISPR is gene-editing technology - the reason your body “learns” to create the foreign hormones is because Zygentra Ultimate inserts the pheromone-producing silverfish DNA into your genetic code. How else would one pill cause an effect lasting a year or more? Additionally, the armpit pain you are experiencing is most likely the rapid growth of modified glandular tissue responsible for producing the silverfish pheromones.* 

*I still recommend considering physical relocation. I hear the Yukon is wonderful this time of year! The alternate solution would be to invest in Zygentra Plus, which can help mitigate some of the silverfish-attracting side effects of Zygentra Ultimate. We recognize that this is an emergency situation, and Defloy Pharmaceuticals is always willing to help where we can! We have shipped a 48-hour trial supply of Zygentra Plus to your home, for free.* 

*Please consider your options and get back to us. If you would like to purchase additional Zygentra Plus, a week’s supply costs $750, with a 5 percent discount if you purchase the medication in bulk.*

*Amy,*

When I received this email, I had a grand total of 3,500 dollars to my name. Desperation hit me like an avalanche. A little under 4 grand was nowhere near the funds I would need to move from Miami to Northern Canada. Moving would also force me to quit my job, and I didn’t want to leave Stacy behind. Retrospectively, I should have just used that money to move myself and my shitty car as far north as it would take me. 

When Zygentra Plus arrived five days later, I was beyond sleep-deprived. I had called out of work that week, as I certainly couldn’t come in and work on code as the fucking pied piper of silverfish. I spent that time driving around, stopping only when I felt myself drifting into sleep at the wheel. Pulled over to wherever I could and close my eyes, but before long, the sensation of silverfish crawling into my mouth or between my armpits would wake me up with a start, like I had jabbed myself with an adrenaline shot - at which point I would resume driving. No amount of insect repellant spray or mouse traps seemed to prevent the legion from getting to me. 

I hastily unpackaged the box containing the pro bono Zygentra Plus. The instructions on the supplement were: *take four pills by mouth every two hours*. Every *two fucking hours*. It did work at keeping the bugs away, but only if I religiously took the medication as instructed, which only served to minimally improve my sleep deprivation. I needed to return to work, but that ended up being a mistake, too. I had ditched Stacy on our first date without explanation and then proceeded not to talk to her for a week while I was driving around in circles, waiting for the Zygentra Plus to arrive. When she saw me again at work, I had dark circles around my bloodshot eyes the size of trash bags, and I nervously scanned my surroundings for silverfish. She said hello to me, and I don’t think I said hello back. Instead, I opted to launch into a minute-by-minute retelling of my last week. What I told her was an incoherent mess. Stacy nodded along politely to my tale, but I could see fear and concern rising in her eyes. Eventually, I gave her mercy, excused myself in the middle of a sentence, and pitifully returned to my desk. I dragged my body through about half of a workday before the side effects of Zygentra Plus started.

Out of nowhere, I felt my mouth fill uncomfortably with saliva. When I tried to sip my morning coffee, dribble would involuntarily spill out of my mouth, down my chin and onto my shirt collar. Before long, I had a half-crescent of soaked fabric around my neck despite my efforts to keep my mouth closed. Next, my eyes began watering uncontrollably, making it look like I was quietly sobbing all morning. The final straw was when I took my hand off my coffee cup, only to have a thin layer of palm skin remain stuck to the grip, peeling from my hand and causing immense and immediate pain. I screamed. And then, of course, there was a lot of bleeding. In a panic, I hastily left my desk without saying a word, no doubt leaving behind plenty of tears, saliva, skin and blood. My boss caught up and confronted me about my behavior before I could leave the building. I tried to say something, but saliva just erupted from my mouth instead. I probably looked rabid.

I didn’t come back to work the next day, or the following day. A few days after that, a message on my cellphone answering machine told me I was fired.

Amy, resident miracle worker at Defloy Pharmaceuticals, wasn’t much help with the situation. I let her know that, although Zygentra Plus was helping keep the insects away, the side effects from it weren’t much more bearable. The excess saliva and tears were one thing, but pieces of my skin were sloughing off with the slightest manipulation, like I was some human danish. And I still wasn’t sleeping - I needed to set multiple alarms to get myself up every two hours to take the new medication; otherwise, the silverfish would be back. She explained to me that this was expected, as Zygentra Plus acted as a low-dose insecticide I was digesting and releasing into the surrounding air from my pores or what was left of them. At the brink of insanity, I demanded to speak with “Mr. Bartleby”, the supposed genius creator and mind behind the Zygentra line of products mentioned in the original advertisement. I thought maybe he would have an elegant solution to all of this. In response, Amy said, and I quote:

*“Well, that will be impossible. Mr. Bartleby is more of an idea than a person. Here at Delfoy Pharmaceuticals, we all aspire to achieve the goals that Dr. Bartleby represents. Also, it seems to help with sales.”*

But don’t worry, she said, there was still something to be done - Amy theorized that drastically increasing my zinc levels might mitigate some symptoms from Zygentra Plus. I spent my last 500 dollars on that supplement, unsure of what I would do next, even if it helped. But I needed relief. Moreover, I needed to keep taking the pills because I was terrified of what would happen to me when I ran out, and the silverfish came back. My car was out of gas, my skin was breaking down, I was jobless and nearly out of money. If they returned, I would have limited defenses and nowhere to hide. I’m not particularly eager to think about what would happen to me.

The zinc supplement was a purple-reddish liquid that I was instructed to drink once a day. I voraciously gulped it down, immediately experiencing excruciating pain from my lips to deep in my chest. I would come to learn that the compound I drank, Zinc Hydrosulfide, is a very strong acid. I stared at the words “strong acid” in the email, dumbfounded, with blood and saliva dripping from my scalded mouth onto the screen. Amy then offered a subdermal injection to help me tolerate the Zinc Hydrosulfide, and I just started laughing. Must have been laughing for a while, because when my laughing slowed down, I saw silver floaters in my periphery again, meaning I was due for my next dose of Zygentra Plus.

I could barely swallow the pills after what the liquid had done to my mouth and esophagus, almost passing out from the pain. Even if I had the money to pay for the 2,000-dollar subdermal injection, which I do not, I have no idea where I would even inject it into. Didn’t have much of a “dermis” left after the effects of Zygentra Plus, which had liberated me from a good portion of my skin.

Effectively, I am now stuck. The acidic liquid that was supposed to help with the side effects from the pills has now prevented me from taking *any* pills, or at least has made it a great deal harder and more painful. The medication that would help me tolerate the acidic liquid was no good either - the pills had dissolved the skin that it was supposed to be injected under. Perhaps most critically of all, I am now broke.

Thought about going to the hospital - some combination of fear and shame prevented me from doing that. Calling an ambulance may be my next move, but I’m not sure they can do anything for me now. The silverfish will find me no matter where I am. I’m sure there are plenty lurking unseen in the cracks and crevices of the hospital.

Plus, who knows if the medications they’d give me would interact with the supplements.

So, with about 12 hours of my oral insecticide left, I have decided to throw a bit of a Hail Mary. Has anyone else taken Zygentra Ultimate before and knows how to reverse it? 

Alternatively, anyone have a good way to kill thousands of silverfish at a time without hurting [yourself?](https://linktr.ee/unalloyedsainttrina)
