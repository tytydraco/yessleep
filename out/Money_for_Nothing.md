I work for a construction company down in Tennessee. My buddies and I like to hang out on Friday's at each others houses and eat pizza and play games together. We usually stay at Jacob's house, as he actually has an Xbox Series X, although we do occasionally go my house or Landon's. We had noticed though that we had never gone to Frank's house yet. We pressed him on it, but he usually said he was busy or couldn't at the time. One day, though, Frank offers to let us go to his place.

"I can actually host this time," Frank says.

"Yeah but we could play more Black Ops 7 at my-" Jacob says.

"DON'T!" Landon interrupts. "We have literally never gone to Frank's house before so let's go there." He's very passionate about this, I could tell, and I too wanted to go to Frank's house.

Jacob acquiesces and we all agree to go to Frank's house. Frank also says that he needs help moving some furniture in his house that he can't quite get on his own, and he's willing to pay us 20 bucks each to help. We all decide to help Frank out if he pays us the money and pays for the pizza that Friday, as we would all be tired after a long day's work from construction. And so the plan was set.

Frank is a bit of a loner. He's very shy and doesn't talk much. The guys actually feel a bit bad for him and think he might have some trauma. But he's a genuine dude and when he talks about his interests he's very fun to be around. He's into painting and optics and stuff, all artistic things. Oh, and roleplaying. Like a lot. Jacob is probably the most outgoing of us, he's mainly into cars and gaming. Landon's a quiet and reserved guy, and also into gaming and history.

The day of, Landon and I had been talking. He said he felt sick and that he wouldn't be able to come tonight, and felt terrible about cancelling since he was the one to insist on going to Frank's house. He couldn't quite speak to me straight, almost as if he was extremely nervous about telling me this. It seemed more than nervousness though: he seemed off. He couldn't look me straight. I told him that it's no problem at all and he shouldn't stress it. He was a little more eased but remained mostly tense and ended up leaving early from work that day. I hadn't seen Jacob or Frank all day, but Landon seemed very pale and I was hoping it wasn't a virus that could potentially infect me and then infect them, but I didn't worry much.

5pm rolled around, I got in my car, got me a snack and a sprite from a gas station and headed to the address Frank gave us to his house. I got there around 5:50ish, as we meet at 6pm and I didn't want to come super early, but neither Frank nor Jacob seemed to be there.

No car was in the front yard. The house was unkempt and disgusting. Why hadn't Frank asked to help with housework before letting it get this bad? His house was clearly the worst on the street. He had no fences on either side of his property, but both his neighbors put up extensive fences against his. Messed up window shades, terrible exterior paint job, litter, etc. Practically abandoned.

Frank pulled up at 6:02pm, late to the meeting to his own house.

"Frank!" I exclaimed, "Why are you late?"

"Oh haha my car clock says it's 5:59." He responded.

"Where's Jacob?" I asked.

"Gee, I don't know" Frank replied. "Let met text him. In the mean time, come on in!"

I went in as he suggested. As we wait for Landon to respond to the text, he gives me a cup of water, and I look around the house. The house was disgusting on the inside. It smells foul as all hell. Visible mold, probably with invisible mold everywhere, roots breaking into the floor(wtf??), dirt and dust everywhere. Various drug amalgamations were on the counters and spilled out over the floor. A painting of a sunflower in the middle of the wall, that tilted down a bit with dim lighting, creep-ish looking smile. It became clear that this was not the house of some introverted depressed loner, but of some schizophrenic maniac.

The clock strikes 6:30pm as we're still doing an extensive house tour. Jacob hasn't responded to Frank, so I decided to hit up Jacob. Jacob and I are closer than him and Frank, so Jacob might respond to my text and not Frank's. Even then, I don't get any response from Jacob.

"Was he mad about not going to his place to play Call of Duty?" I asked, ignoring the serial killer aesthetic of a house interior.

"Yeah I guess so haha." Frank responded.

"Why are you not mad or disappointed?" I asked, getting very impatient with him.

Frank looked at me angrily, then he looked down. "Well I don't talk to people much and I'm shy man if people don't like me, it is what it is."

It sounded feigned, as if he knew that people might view him in that way, but he wasn't truly like that. What the hell was going on here. Holy crap I'm actually starting to freak out is this guy going to acknowledge his house or is he going to kill me or what. I went to the front door to try to motion for me to leave. It was locked.

"Why are you opening the front door?" Frank asked, after hearing the knob buckle.

"I just wanted to see the front porch." I said.

"Well, let's just get this couch here into the basement," he said. "I'll pay you 150$ because it's just you. And I already ordered the pizza. We can eat and then since there's nothing much to do, you can go."

"Alright, deal." I said. I realized I might've overreacted. Frank is just a different guy, but he has his own ways of expressing himself, and I really shouldn't judge him that harsh.

We go to the room where the couch is. The room smells terrible. I realize that the source of the musty smell in the first room was actually from this room. It genuinely smelled like what I'd imagine a dead decomposed rat or squirrel to smell like. I looked around the room, but there was no place for Frank to have potentially hid a dead animal or anything. I genuinely can't tell if I'm freaking out or not. I check my texts, no response from Jacob. In addition to all this madness, my stomach is starting to ache. Maybe I should've just eaten dinner beforehand instead trying to save for pizza.

In the room, we have to take the couch down a set of steps. 2 man now. It is indeed a pretty heavy couch that should've been done with 3 or 4 people, but hey what can you do? We get the couch down, with him on the lower side. We get into the basement, set the couch in a chill place to put it, and then I look around the basement.

Frank remained behind me, regardless of how I rotate myself to look around the room.

"Will you stop that!" I yell, scared, "stop standing behind me that's so weird!" I realize I might've freaked out over him doing nothing, so I apologize. "Sorry. It's just weird that you do that I didn't mean to be mean. Just- when is the pizza coming?"

I look in the mirror in the room, and I can see in the faint reflection that I look visibly very scared and Frank might be pranking me hard right now.

"Let me check." Frank says, checking his phone.

I realize that the smell from the room above where the couch was had followed us in here. The smell is coming from the couch. I sit and try to sink into the couch, seeing if I can feel something. I press on something more stiff and I immediately jolt up. I look at Frank, who was already looking at me, even though I looked almost immediately at him after feeling that...*something*.

"What's in here?!" I shout, "what's in here!? What's in here?!"

Frank looks genuinely surprised. "Is there something in there? Maybe that would explain that SMELL hahaha."

I hadn't said anything to Frank about the smell. I start to feel nauseous from fear of his demeanor change and something in my stomach not feeling right.

"Ohhhhh God..." I said, swaying. I grab onto Frank to hold upright. He holds my shoulder and keeps me up, although I keep giving out. "Ohhhh what is going on ah" I start to struggle to make words.

I look at Frank and I notice that he looks genuinely distorted. His eyes are much wider than before, he's smiling and he looks like he's a full on maniac, his mouth is open and his tongue hanging partially out.

I suddenly regain my balance and stand up straight. I'm actually surprised at how fine I felt all of the sudden. I look in the mirror to see how I look, to see if I look as sick or scared as I feel. I looked pale, my eyes sunken, extremely exhausted, hunched over, and.... taller? *Wait.*

"Frank." I say. I suddenly can't speak. Frank grabs me, or someone, something, something grabs me, or someone or something is happening or some smell or something. My eyes start to manually close.

Frank. Frank that's not me. Frank that's not me in the mirror. FRANK. Frank that's not me. My eyes are completely shut. I don't know if I'm actually speaking or not. Something is hitting me... or maybe not. I don't know. 

Frank. That's not... me.
