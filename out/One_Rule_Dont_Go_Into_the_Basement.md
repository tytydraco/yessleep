It was supposed to be the perfect weekend getaway. Five friends, a secluded cabin in the woods, and no cell service for miles. Just us, nature, and a cooler full of beer. We’d been planning this trip for months, ever since Jake found the listing online. “Black Hollow Cabin,” he’d said, grinning like a kid on Christmas. “Totally off the grid. No tourists, no noise, no nothing. Just us.”

The drive was long, the kind of long where the trees start to look like they’re closing in on you. The GPS had stopped working about an hour ago, and we were relying on Jake’s printed directions. The road narrowed, the pavement giving way to gravel, then dirt. The sun was setting by the time we pulled up to the cabin, its orange glow casting long shadows through the trees.

The cabin itself was... unsettling. It wasn’t the rustic, charming kind of cabin you see in movies. It was old, the wood warped and dark, like it had been soaked in something. The windows were small and clouded, and the front door hung slightly crooked on its hinges. There was a smell too, faint but persistent, like wet earth and something metallic.

“Charming,” Sarah said, her voice dripping with sarcasm. She was always the skeptic, the one who rolled her eyes at ghost stories and horror movies. But even she looked uneasy as we unloaded the car.

Inside, the cabin was dim and cold. The furniture was sparse—a sagging couch, a rickety table, and a few mismatched chairs. The fireplace was filled with ashes, and the air smelled like mildew. We found the bedrooms upstairs, two of them, each with a pair of creaky twin beds. Jake and I took one room, Sarah, Emily, and Mark took the other.

That first night, we tried to make the best of it. We lit a fire, cracked open some beers, and told stories. But there was something off, something none of us could quite put into words. The firelight flickered in a way that made the shadows dance too much, like they were alive. And the woods outside were too quiet, like they were holding their breath.

I woke up in the middle of the night to the sound of scratching. It was faint, but persistent, like something was trying to get in. I lay there, my heart pounding, listening. The sound was coming from the window. I told myself it was just a tree branch, but when I looked, there was nothing there. Just the black void of the forest.

The next morning, we found the first note.

It was tucked under the coffee pot, written on a yellowed piece of paper in shaky handwriting. \*“Don’t go into the basement.”\*

We all laughed it off, of course. “Probably left by the last renters,” Mark said, crumpling the note and tossing it into the fire. But I noticed he didn’t suggest we check the basement.

The day passed uneventfully. We hiked, we drank, we played cards. But as the sun dipped below the trees, the mood shifted. The scratching came back, louder this time, and it wasn’t just at my window. It was everywhere—the walls, the floor, the ceiling. Like the cabin itself was alive.

Then Emily screamed.

We found her in the bathroom, staring at the mirror. Her reflection was wrong. It was her, but... not her. The eyes were too wide, the smile too sharp. And it was moving, just slightly out of sync with her. She slammed her hand against the glass, and the reflection did the same, but slower, like it was lagging.

We all saw it. None of us could explain it.

That night, we decided to leave. We packed up our stuff and headed for the car, but the keys were gone. All of them. Even the spare Jake kept in his backpack. And the car... the car wouldn’t start. The engine didn’t even turn over.

That’s when we heard the voice.

It came from the basement, faint but clear. A child’s voice, singing a nursery rhyme. \*“Ring around the rosie, pocket full of posies...”\*

We stood there, frozen, as the singing grew louder. And then the door to the basement creaked open on its own.

I don’t know who moved first, but we all ran. Out the door, into the woods, not caring about the dark or the cold or the branches clawing at our faces. We ran until we couldn’t run anymore, until we were lost and the cabin was nowhere in sight.

We found a road eventually, and a passing truck driver gave us a ride to the nearest town. The police went back to the cabin, but they didn’t find anything. No notes, no scratches, no singing. Just an empty, rotting cabin in the middle of the woods.

We never talked about what happened. Not really. But sometimes, late at night, I hear the scratching. And I know it’s not coming from outside. It’s coming from inside me.

And the worst part? I think it’s always been there.
