Eliza looked so alive. The makeup artist did a great job. Her skin seemed sun kissed, even pinkish, as if blood still flowed within. There was a slight blush on her cheeks and the tip of her nose.

I kept waiting for her to unshutter her eyes and spring up with a yell of “Boo!”

I wouldn’t put it past her to craft a grand prank like that, complete with a funeral, just to mess with us.

But her family was there, teary-eyed and forlorn. They weren’t the type to join in on such mischief.

She was dead. I knew that. I had read the newspaper articles, texts from her family, and spoken to our friend, Lynn.

Everyone and everything confirmed that she was dead.

Someone cleared their throat behind me. Shit. I had been lingering too long. I took a last glance at Eliza, bowed my head in a silent goodbye, and moved along.

The whole thing seemed incredibly macabre to me - having a line of people queue up to see your dead body on display.

Only her face and torso were visible through the open top half of the coffin.

They had to keep the lower half of her body hidden from view. I guess that’s just what happens when half your body gets crushed in a massive car wreck.

I retreated to my place in the pew next to Lynn. We sat in silence, listening to the overlapping sobs that echoed in the chamber.

I didn’t shed a single tear, and neither did Lynn. It’s not that I didn’t care for Eliza. Eliza had once been a dear friend.

It had been 2 years since we last spoke, but I had many fond memories with her. I knew Lynn did too.

I won’t speak for Lynn, but I just haven’t really been able to feel much in years. It might sound like a psychological condition, apathy, anhedonia, or something, but I know it’s not.

I know the exact moment I lost the ability to feel anything more than a whisper of emotion.

It was four years ago. A time when all five of us still hung out. We were in our early twenties then. We had been friends since our teens, and Lynn and I have been friends since childhood.

There’s only Lynn and I left now.

Sometimes I wonder how life could have turned out, if only we hadn’t torn up the floorboards. Or if we hadn’t broken into the decrepit house in the first place..

Four years ago, we were bored and drunk. As we often did while bored and drunk, we explored the town on unsteady legs, looking for a nice, secluded area to continue our drunken adventures.

We joked about breaking into the old abandoned house, the one just a little outside the edge of town. It was a running joke, one we never dared to fulfill. But we had just a little too much liquid courage that day.

So we made the fateful decision to finally walk the talk. We were going to break into the house, and make it our hangout spot.

We were excited. We talked about how, if it turned out to be a cosy little space, and if we’re not found out, we could keep coming back, and slowly do up the place with cushions, blankets, bean bags, stuff like that. We began to paint the picture of a secret lair just for us, somewhere dingy enough to be cool, but comfortable enough to actually want to spend time at.

We talked a good game right up until we finished clipping a sufficiently sized hole in the wire fence that surrounded the house.

Once we had peeled the dislodged wires aside, we fell silent. I think none of us had really expected us to get that far.

But buoyed by peer pressure and false bravado, I ignored the sudden chill that settled in the pit of my stomach. I followed them right through the hole we made, into the overgrown jungle of a garden.

We pushed our way through the tall wild weeds to the front door, and hesitated.

We should have turned back then, and run all the way home.

But we didn’t have hindsight, or even foresight, as stupid dumb younglings.

Joel smashed a window at some point, and we managed to unlock the door and make our way in. Joel bled from a cut on the broken glass, but waved it off in his typical gungho way.

The last one of us had barely made it into the house when the door swung shut with a bang. We nearly leapt out of our skins. I think I screamed. As did someone else.

Then, like the idiots we were, we laughed. We thought it was the wind, or that the door had those auto shutting mechanisms.

The lights wouldn’t turn on, which wasn’t surprising. The house had been empty for as long as we had known it existed. It had probably been abandoned before any of us were even born. We had no clue why it was never purchased and occupied again, but now I have an idea.

Anyway. We used the torch functions on our phones, and made our way to the stairs. The stairs were rotted, and even in our drunken state, we knew better than to try to make our way up.

We were silent as we explored the house. My nerves were stretched taut. In all honesty, I was sobering up and ready to hightail it out of there.

But the three girls weren’t running, and Joel was forging ahead, despite his bleeding hand. There was no way I was going to be the first to run. Joel would never let me live it down if I ran when none of the girls did.

Thinking back, I can’t help but want to punch myself in the face. I was a full grown man even then. I should have known better than to be worried about dumb things like being mocked. Like wanting to be a manly man. I should have just dragged every last one of them out of there, pride and ego be damned.

But I can’t change the past.

We wandered through the various rooms, until we made our way to a room near the back of the house. Joel’s shoe made an odd hollow thud on one of the floorboards in the room. He stomped on it again, then stomped on another floorboard, creating a dull, flat thump. After he hopped around more, we ascertained that three of the floorboards had hollow spaces beneath them.

It was Eliza who suggested tearing them up. I just wanted out. I didn’t want to be in the place. Something was off. There was a sick, heavy quality to the air itself. It wasn’t just the mustiness of old, rotting wood. It was as if I was breathing in ribbons of twisted energy draped across the entire space.

Joel had seconded Eliza’s suggestion immediately. He seemed disappointed that he hadn’t been the first to bring it up. Lynn and Ali seemed hesitant. Joel and Eliza both looked at me, the thrill visible in their eyes even in the low light.

I sighed, and nodded.

It took us less than a couple of minutes to get all three floorboards up and away. They weren’t tightly tucked in at all.

Joel angled his phone to cast its light down on the hollow space beneath, as Ali and Lynn backed away.

“There’s…handprints,” he said, frowning.

I took a closer look. He was right. There were five handprints. Above each, was a number.

1, 2, 4, 5, 7.

“Huh,” Eliza crouched down, studying the prints. She read the numbers aloud. “Wonder what that’s about.”

Joel pressed his hand against the first handprint, the one beneath the number ‘1’.

“This handprint is tiny!” He flexed his fingers to show the difference.

Ali knelt next to him. She placed her hand on the handprint beneath the number ‘2’.

“It really is,” she murmured.

Eliza pressed hers on the next handprint, under ‘4’. “I think the numbers are the ages of the kids who made these prints!”

I stared at the two handprints left, and looked uneasily at Lynn.

“Come on guys,” Joel said with a grin. He gestured towards the remaining handprints with his free hand. “This is like some Power Rangers shit.”

“Or some Tomb Raider type of puzzle. Maybe we’ll open up something if we cover up all the handprints!” Eliza joined in. She smiled a crooked grin.

I sighed and rolled my eyes. But I placed my hand on the handprint under ‘5’. Lynn chewed on her lower lip for a moment, then joined me, echoing my sigh as she placed her hand on the last handprint.

A deafening crack punched through the air like a gunshot. It came from above.

We all screamed then, and tore from the room. We barrelled towards the door, none of us bothering with any pretence of bravery.

Joel was first to fling himself from the house, followed by Ali, Eliza, myself, then Lynn.

Once we had struggled through the wire fence and sprinted a few streets down, I had the good grace to feel ashamed. I had shoved past Lynn in my desperation to get out of that damned house. Not the most gentlemanly thing to do.

I didn’t know what to say to Lynn, so I left it. If I recall correctly, I apologised to her via text a few days later. She didn’t hold it against me.

It’s only now, as I tell this story, that I realise we had escaped the house in the exact order that we had placed our hands on the handprints.

We didn’t speak of what happened for a few days. It was only after a week had passed, that we were able to speak of and joke about it. We concluded that some faulty part of the house upstairs must have snapped while we were messing around downstairs. We teased each other for our cowardice, and I remember everyone piling on Joel for being the first to run.

On the surface, life went on as usual.

But something was different. I couldn’t pinpoint it until Ali vocalised it, a few weeks later.

“Everything seems duller these days,” she had said, “muted.”

She was right. That was what I had been feeling. It was as if I had been experiencing life through a thick velvet curtain.

“I don’t feel much of anything,” Lynn had agreed. “Nothing gets me riled up, or scared, or happy.”

Pretty soon, we had all admitted to feeling the same way, even Joel. We came up with many hypotheses, and settled on the most logical one. We had probably endured a much too heightened state of emotion that one night, and so everything else after just paled in comparison. We also agreed that perhaps, we were lightly traumatised, and that had messed with our moods.

The thing about having flattened emotions is that socialising becomes a lot less enjoyable. It becomes harder to care about people, events, activities, hanging out, stuff like that.

Over the next months, I felt the veil that suffocated my emotions thicken. I think the same happened with the others. We began to drift apart.

I never regained my full capacity for emotions. In fact, my feelings still seem to deaden more with each passing day.

Then Joel died.

He died exactly one year after that night at the house. We didn’t realise it then, didn’t think much about the date of his death. We were more concerned with the how and why of it all.

Joel’s throat had been sliced open.

There was no sign of a struggle. No one was ever caught. The general consensus was that someone must have attacked him from behind, taking him by surprise. A quick slash to his throat, and that was it.

His wallet and phone were still on him when his body was found, so it wasn’t a robbery gone wrong.

We all attended his funeral. But we didn’t shed a tear. I wanted to. I sure as hell tried. I wanted to feel something, to honour the loss of a good friend. I wanted to grieve, to cry, to wail.

But there was only a heavy weight on my chest, and an all-encompassing numbness that soaked every fibre of my being.

By the time Ali died, another year later, I had gotten out of town. Lynn had moved overseas as well.

We didn’t keep in touch, not with each other, or with anyone else from our hometown. I only found out about Ali’s death when my parents texted. They thought I would like to know.

She had been skydiving, and her parachute didn’t open. Neither did her spare parachute.

It was only then that I realised that Ali and Joel had both died on the same date, just a different year. I hadn’t put it all together then, but I knew something was up with the dates.

I didn’t care enough to look too much into it. I didn’t go back for the funeral, but I was told Lynn did.

Two more years passed, and Eliza died. Her car had been crushed by an oncoming truck.

By this time, I had an inkling as to what was going on. Much as I didn’t really feel the worry or fear, I knew I should care. That I should try to preserve my life.

I called Lynn, and told her my theory.

They were all dying according to the numbers. Joel, handprint number 1, dead in one year. Ali, handprint number 2, dead in 2 years. Eliza’s hand was on the handprint labelled 4. Dead in 4 years.

I thought Lynn would laugh, tease me, or call me crazy. But she simply told me that she had figured that out as well.

We agreed to attend Eliza’s funeral, and talk things through. See if there was anything we could do. Anything to save ourselves.

After our unfeeling goodbyes towards Eliza, after leaving the funeral home, we sat at the bar we used to frequent.

I didn’t know what to say. Lynn talked about various possibilities. Exorcists, priests, monks, crystals, sage, we considered them all. We didn’t really know what else we could do. I think we didn’t have the motivation to try harder, to search more extensively. Life was pretty meaningless by then. Every experience brought nothing but the ashy taste of pointlessness.

But even through my lack of sentiment, I felt an intellectual respect and admiration for Lynn. Having been stripped of much of my feelings, I had spiralled and gone down the path of nihilism. I worked a minimum wage job, spent what money I had left after rent and fast food on games, and just stayed in the shitty room I rented blistering my hands on the controller, whenever I wasn’t working.

That was it. Wake, eat, work, home, game, sleep. Sometimes, I would shower. Sometimes, I would drop by the supermarket and buy frozen food in bulk. That was my miserable routine.

But Lynn, despite her apathy and steamrolled emotions, had done something meaningful with her life.

She had joined some humanitarian organisation, and spent most of her time in wartorn, poverty-stricken, warlord ruled places all over the world, helping to build or rebuild communities, run education programmes, work on securing clean water, stuff like that.

She told me about her recent project, which was helping to secure and deliver medical aid to the wounded in a warzone. She talked about working while bullets whizzed and explosions erupted closeby.

“It is kind of a blessing, the lack of emotion. I don’t feel scared, so I can think clearly. I can better see what needs to be done, in those situations,” she said.

I would have felt shame then, and maybe I did, just a tiny prickle of it. I would have been grateful to feel shame. To properly experience shame. I would have loved to have had any emotion that was more intense than a tiny prickle in my chest.

We parted ways after another day hanging out. She was needed back on her humanitarian project.

Over the next months, I carried out the plans we had made, though I honestly didn’t really want to. It was just so much effort, and I cared so little.

I saw the gamut of spiritual aides, from priests to bomohs to self-proclaimed witches. I also gathered a bunch of spiritual herbs and a large collection of crystals.

But I knew, deep down, that those wouldn’t help.

It was only last week that I lighted upon the solution.

I would break the curse. 1, 2, 4, 5, 7.

If I died before year 5, the exact date being only three months more to go, I would break the curse.

Lynn would live. Or could have a chance to.

It was an easy choice. I didn’t feel much fear, if any at all, of death. I didn’t feel much sorrow for my life. I didn’t feel any regret. It would, in fact, be the easy way out of a bland and gloomy life.

In ending my life, I would get to save Lynn. Someone who, despite being afflicted with the same emotionless nightmare of a life, had made something of herself. Had contributed to the world. Had sought to use the lack of emotions for good.

In saving her, I would too be doing good.

I planned it all out. Got my affairs in order. Quit my job, told my housemate I was moving out. Donated my stuff to charity or to my housemate.

Then I went to the tallest building in the city, climbed to the roof. I texted Lynn, told her to live a good life, and that I hoped I ended the curse. I didn’t even hesitate before I jumped.

I remember smacking hard into the ground, pain tearing through every cell, then all was black.

Until someone shook me awake. I was still on the sidewalk where I was sure I had pancaked myself.

But I was whole, well, without a single broken bone. Not even a scratch could be found. Meanwhile, my phone was smashed to bits.

A passerby had thought I was passed out drunk, and wanted to make sure I was okay.

I tried a few more times to end the curse. I’m still here, typing this.

I have a few more months to go.

I could keep trying to break the curse, or I could try to be of use to someone, make a positive impact on the world before I go. Especially since I can’t seem to die before my doomsday date.
