Where I come from there is a secret. A dark, ugly secret. Most of the time nobody speaks of it, the horror’s better left unsaid. Now that’s not to say some haven’t tried to reveal the truth of what transpires here every seven years. For all I know none have been successful. Yet today, I take that risk. I’m posting our secret for the world to read. Surely it will be disregarded as fiction, but that is no matter. I simply must tell my story whether you believe it or not.

My home is nothing more than a spec on your map. A rural farm town, far off the beaten path of modern America. 1200+ residents, secluded far from any highway. Few outsiders visit without a purpose, and most who live here were born here. And none will ever leave. It is a self imposed prison. It is paradise. It is where I was born, where my daughter was born, her son was born. Our line is rather young compared to the others. My parents were one of the few transplants to this magical place I call home. 

Nobody knows where the water came from or why. Legend has it a small band of Indians discovered it bubbling up through the ground long ago. A few of them are still around but I’m afraid to ask about it. Questions like that are mostly forbidden. All that is certain is the water naturally pooled there. Its source springing from deep within the earth. Early accounts tell of how those first Indians gathered large rocks in a ring containing the water and its source into a small pond. That is its beginning. 

Today it would look very different than in its long past. Now it looks like any ordinary Olympic sized swimming pool. One you would find in any recreation center across the States. Equipped with all the modern amenities one would wish for. However, you will never see anyone swimming in it. No one dares enter the dark murky water that fills its unimaginable depths but once every seven years. Long ago some brave souls tried to reach its bottom, but none returned successfully. That reckless behavior was abandoned for good.  

These days there are no inquiries, no experiments or explanations. It just is. And we all accept it as such. For in that water. That deep, unnatural looking water, all your dreams will come true. 

For a price. 

I am two hundred and seventy-three years old. Part of one of the youngest cohorts. My hair black as night, with skin as soft as cream. I’m strong as an ox with facial features envied by both men and women. I’m attractive and articulate. Successful and charming. I have a wonderful life. We all have wonderful lives. Long, prosperous and filled with pleasures. 

And all we must do is swim. Once every seven years all must bathe in the waters, crammed in like sardines. It comes then up then and counts. Far from below. How many miles down it lives can only be guessed. But all our bloodlines must enter the water and wait. Otherwise, we risk its anger.  

It doesn’t like clothes. How they figured that out I’ll never know. I’ve only seen it angered twice in my lifetime, but the last of the Indians say it was far more common long ago. Luckily our ancestors figured things out over time. Learned how to keeps its anger at bay. For It’s been 49 years since its last tantrum. We lost 314 that year. I can still remember the screams. Assumed I would join them, for the creature focused on me for a time. Its slippery touch probing every inch of my body, tugging and pulling, squeezing. Searching.

It even grazed my lips, searching for an entrance before suddenly releasing its grasp. I’ve never felt anything like that since. Its touch only glancing my skin to count. But I will never forget that moment, the foreignness, its alien touch. I was lucky that day, but 314 unfortunate souls did not share my fate. It took each down the deep end, plunging them into its murky lair below. 

On that occasion true sadness followed, not the euphoria of our standard encounters where only a handful of souls are chosen. On those occasions we erupt in joy as the water changes shade, and we drink until all our bellies are full. Praising the generous monster that lurks beneath. 

However, the day 314 of our community took their final breath I felt both anger and guilt. Yet, I still drank of their death, filling my stomach with the essence of their souls. Lapping it up until the bloat overwhelmed me. And in that moment as the power filled my tired body, rejuvenated once more, I felt something different. A regret perhaps. And as I looked around, I think I saw the same regret in some others. A questioning of our bargain? For although we’d go home tonight reborn into our youth, we’d lost something in their deaths. A part of ourselves. It stung, deep inside the meat of my chest.

Did I leave then? I could have. It is not forbidden after all. All who dwell in my town are free to leave. Go off and live a normal life. But nobody leaves this power. And neither can I.  

And so, I sit here and type, posting my story for the world on the eve of another seven years. Tomorrow me and everyone I know will strip down, including my own blood and enter the cool blue waters waiting for the shadow to rise. There we will wait, stepped in the mix of excitement and dread. Wondering who it will take this time? 

It is not understood who it prefers. Some believes it choice random; others believe it’s a deliberate selection. The oldest of the Indians claims to have lived 2400 years. Nearly 350 choosing’s and he is still here. Certainly, that cannot be luck, can it? My father still lives, he’ll be close by.  Watching if my sister or me is taken. Just as I will eye him and my own offspring hoping they too are not taken. It’s not likely. The odds are almost always in our favor. If nobody disobeys. It gets angry when we disobey. 

We are forbidden to ever speak of it outside of its waters. Only in its depths are we allowed to speak amongst ourselves of its origin and purpose without rebuttal. The elders say its only when we tell outsiders does it stir with rage and punish. 

With that said, I understand the cost of what I do to bring you this tale. The story of a place where one can live forever. Virile and strong. A place to be forever young. Yet I can no longer hold in this urge to speak. For remember what it took from me that day. After a its tentacle left my body, it found my mother. My sweet, kind mother. Eyes wide as the thick as the slimy appendage slid down her throat, deep into her body. She couldn’t scream, but tried anyway, thrashing in pain as the creature pulled her into the deep end. Slow and agonizing it hunts. Taking each person one by one below. We spent 16 hours in its waters before it was satisfied. That is what anger will do. I began to hate it then. Hate us for feeding it

What will it do tomorrow when we step into its waters? Will it know of what I’ve done? How many will it take in revenge? Will I be one of the unlucky ones? Or will it spare me again and gift me with everlasting life? 

I guess you will have to wait and see.
