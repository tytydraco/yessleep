The year is 2173 and the utopia is what Canada has been called, in just 2 years The prime minister, Kathleen Dylans, made crime go down and health go up with her desire for science and technology to bring humanity and longevity to her country and the citizens. All done at just 23 years old. But there was a secret that she had kept from her people, that was about to come out.



She was working late one night at her office and was wondering why she hadn't been able to get in touch with her friend and lead scientist Raymond, then she heard a gunshot and scream down the hallway in the cafeteria. “The hell was that?!” she said after she jumped out of fear. She grabbed her baton from her desk and went to investigate.



“Whoa!”, she exclaimed as she slipped on something wet on the floor. She realized it was blood when she saw the body of one of the guards. She saw that he had his shirt ripped off and his stomach cut wide open, empty of all his organs, “Oh no! One of them escaped!” she thought to herself, knowing who she was dealing with.



She entered the cafeteria where she heard clambering and eating noise in the kitchen. She saw another guard, lying on the ground with his throat cut wide open and his eyes gone from his face. She noticed his gun was still holstered so she took it to prepare herself for whatever confrontation would happen.



She held the gun up as she opened the door to the kitchen and saw 3 of the 5 cannibals she ordered to be hidden in the underground prison for medical experiments, eating raw meat and vegetables from the fridge. Their skin was covered with scars and bruises from all the torture they endured in the name of science and medicine.



“Jesus Christ!” she whispered as she was shaking the gun. “No, but close enough.” a voice she heard from behind her before she was knocked out. “I must say, Alice.” the same voice that knocked her out said as Kathleen was waking up, “you look ravishing in her clothes.” She was shocked as she saw the 4th and 5th cannibals standing there with a woman wearing her clothes.



She tried to stand up but she realized that her hands were handcuffed, stripped of her clothes except for her bra and underwear and with her mouth tapped shut. “Well, look who's awake!” the man in the suit said. She recognized him as the cannibal who was arrested in secret for the death of 7 people. “Lying to people to bring the crime rate down and using us as your lab rats? Naughty, naughty.”



It was at that moment she realized what they were doing, they were going to reveal her secret police and the human experimentation she committed behind the backs of her people. “There ya go, figured us out huh?” the man said. “This is our revolution and nothing will stop us. Open the freezer”. The other cannibals opened the freezer door as ordered by the leader.



“Oh! How could I forget.” He happily exclaimed. “We brought you some company to join you in the same hell you put us through!” He pointed to the man in the wheelchair that Alice was pushing, and Kathleen realized that it was Raymond. He wasn't moving but had tears running down his face, then she saw 2 holes in his forehead, he was lobotomized.



The man picked her up and threw her into the freezer with Alice pushing Raymond in with Kathleen. The man then told Alice and the others to get the car ready for the reveal of their torture and the living hell they were forced to live in. He looked at the scientist and prime minister in the freezer and then said some final words to them before closing the door and letting them freeze to death.



“I wish we could talk a little bit more but, we're gonna have some breakfast at your parent's house. Bye-bye.”
