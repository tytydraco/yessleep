Hey all,

After a very turbulent Christmas this year with my (27M) parents (oldMF) this year, I decided to finally seek therapy. Things for the past decade or so have been especially rough between us but they sorta hit a breaking point this year. They think I am some mentally ill loser, despite having a moderately high paying government job and have a cozy life with my cat and dog. I have really learned to stop blaming myself for something that happened when I was a child since I started going to therapy. He also suggested I share my story so maybe other people who have experienced something similar can learn, and maybe I could find other people who experienced what I have.

I spent a majority of my life living in the United States, moving to the suburbs of Indianapolis when I was 9 years old when my parents needed a fresh start.  I would say I grew up in a relatively loving home, though there was a clear and, even as a 9 year old, understandable difference between the atmosphere of our household in England and in America. My mother was a school teacher until she retired during the big pandemic and I have never had a clear understanding what my father did, all I know is that he helps develop software, when I was a child it was for banks, in my late teens it was for a smart appliance company, and now it is for some medical company that works with stool samples. I don’t think he is a computer programmer though, moreso a project manager. Either way, we were and still mostly are a normal family, despite my parents splitting a few years into moving to the states.

I still clearly remember our first house here. A two story, red-bricked home in the middle of a maze of looping neighborhoods. I remember the kids I would watch play baseball in the street, the systematic way they would part every time a car would come cruising around the curve of our street. I remember how territorial our neighbors were about their little square of land, fighting with my father for cutting the grass a little too far past the imaginary border between our homes. I remember my father laughing and drinking with that same neighbor while we had cookouts in the back yards of different neighbors. Of course, any laughter my father had went about as deep as his lips. 

My life in England was very different. I lived in a small town on the Isle of Wight called Sundown. Ironically, our town was located on the Eastern coast of the island, right between the ocean and a thick patch of forest that isolates our town from the rest of the isles farmland. Our town was by no means impoverished but it was a town whose economy consisted of fish and wood, so not nearly as fancy as the towns and villages of the mainland, or even those on the rest of the isle. We had a mainstreet, with shoppes and grocers, we had a movie theater that got all the big movies only a week or two late, we had spots that the big kids would congregate and cause mostly innocent trouble, we had our primary school practically touching our secondary school, so close that me and my friends would walk routes specifically to avoid being called f\*\*\* by the older boys. My friend Kyle and I would get flustered but ultimately get over it, but it seemed to bother my friend Adam way more than the rest of us. Many years later, I saw a post on Facebook of Adam celebrating the purchase of an admittedly beautiful home outside of London with his husband, and I understood why he made such a fuss about making such detours. My younger sister Lily had no clue we were even taking a longer route, by the time she was in primary school and could walk with us, we had our daily routine down to muscle memory and she would obediently follow us like a duckling following its mums.

In those few years that my sister would walk with us, we would whine and complain about our new responsibility in monitoring Lily and making sure she got too and from school safely. She would annoy us, ask too many questions, cling to Kyle in a pretend crush in a way that only makes sense for a six year old. The thing that annoyed me the most about Lily though was her incessant need to tattle on the three of us at the drop of the slightest *damn* or *hell.* She made sure the teachers and our parents knew what kind of rotten sailor mouthed boys we were. She was my little sister, she annoyed me, she did what little sisters are supposed to do and I wish every day now that I had done what I was supposed to do.

…..

The end of my life in Sundown started with a dentist appointment about a week after I turned nine. I won’t bore you here with the details of my 9th birthday party, besides I am not one for birthdays really anyways, but I do remember requesting one simple dessert: Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Ice Cream. Kyle had taken a holiday to New York City earlier that spring where he tried this delicacy and described it to Adam and me in almost a religious reverence and I knew I needed to try it. I don’t know where my father found it, but he did and it is was where my focus was that whole party. I didn’t care about inflatable bounce castles or balloon animals, I cared about the Ice Cream. 

The time came for dessert. I remember being almost sick with excitement. Guests murmured to each other about their excitement as well. My mum leaned all of her weight onto the scoop with every sphere she transferred from the tub into the bowl. She placed the bowl in front of me on the wooden table and everyone watched as I took my first spoonful from the bowl and up to my mouth. I don’t remember a happy birthday song, I don’t remember what I said, I don’t even remember the taste of an ice cream I have never had since, what I do remember is a miserable ice pick digging into one of my molars as soon as the ice cream entered my mouth. I did my best to look like I was in the bliss of this anticipated dessert. My mum scheduled a dentist appointment first thing Monday morning.

The morning of the dentist appointment came and it was to be Lily’s first time walking to school without me. She was still going with Kyle and Adam that morning, and would still walk with the three of us home after school. This was one of those dreaded *You still have to go to school after* appointments that every child secretly dreads, so my mum would drop me off at school after the dentist did his thing and Lily would walk home with us like she had done every school day for the last two years. Despite Lily being the age that Kyle, Adam, and I were when we first started walking to school, mum was still her usual nervous self with anything involving her only daughter. I was also her only son, so I never understood the different treatment between us, and maybe looking back now was the reason for my resentment of my sister. 

I don’t recall what the dentist actually did to my tooth, but I do remember a few injections, some laughing gas, and some cotton I had to hold in the back of my mouth all the way back into town and through my first few hours at school that day. Because of what happened that evening, I never felt it appropriate to ask what the dentist actually did, in-fact once we were in America, this day was never mentioned to or by my parents again. 

I got back to school and went straight to maths class, which for a nine year old was probably teaching us simple multiplication or division at the time. While Kyle and Adam weren’t in my normal class, we did go to the same separate teacher for maths in the late morning, which was lucky for me because I could do as mum asked and immediately ask how Lily did that morning. I asked and the first thing I received were annoyed looks from the both of them. It turned out while approaching the school, they had ran into one of the older boys and even though Lily had no idea what the words being said were, she must have figured they were using bad words purely based on the venom she sensed behind what they were saying. Kyle and Adam never told me what they actually said, but whatever it was earned both of them after school disciplinary time. I thought to myself *great, now I have to babysit all by myself, that's what I get for missing out this morning.* I didn’t realize until later that this was actually going to be the first time walking to or from school with just my sister.

While most of the students walked the main road to their homes after school, splintering off as they passed forks in the road that led them in different directions, my friends, Lily, and I took a road that ran through the western woods of the town, arcing around the town until we got to our homes on the southern edge of the forest. Most of our walk was under a canopy of some ordinary trees that provided a nice shade in the morning. During our walks home however, especially as late summer turned to early autumn, the shadows cast a more ominous filter over much of our routine journeys. The distraction of Adam and Kyle had never made me pay much attention but Lily clung to Kyle more than usual this time of year, and walking with her alone that afternoon, I understood why.

It was deafeningly quiet. There was no wind, no birds, no rustling of some critter through the underbrush, just eerie stillness. The glow of the orange sky through the tops of the trees only adding to the foreboding atmosphere in that tunnel of trees. I don’t know what I was afraid of but I was afraid.

….

Something special happens when siblings who don’t get along suddenly experience a rare moment of one on one time. They almost never fight in those moments. It’s like they can break away from their roles as annoyed or annoying brother and sister and can have fun being friends without the pressure of being siblings. I have seen it countless times in my work. Lily and I were no different. When we had quiet weekends when Kyle and Adam were busy and me and my sister had to keep ourselves from driving our parents crazy, we would explore the woods behind our house. Every creek became an uncharted river to follow, every old building or pile of rubbish was a ruin from some ancient and forgotten race of people, every hole in the ground was an entrance into a subterranean labyrinth. Me and my sister were explorers at heart, and nothing was more exciting than discovering a new mysterious feature of the woods. I would like to think that every batch of siblings that don’t get along have something like me and my sister had. One thing that was ours. I thought maybe I could use that to help us on this unusually creepy walk home.

….

All along this road we were walking on were little paths leading into the thick of the forest, almost like hiking trails but not as maintained as one’s marked as trails around the isle. Adam and Kyle were never that interested in seeing where any of these trails led, but I always had a nagging curiosity as to where they led. They appeared man-made and not too old so they have to lead to somewhere. I broke the silence.

“We should see where these trails lead. What do you say?” I notice Lily jump at the initial sound of my voice.

“I - I don’t know,” Lily responded, timidly. “Mum was awfully nervous this morning, I think we should just go home.”

I definitely detected a hint of intrigue in her voice, but the more I thought about following one of these paths, the more determined I was to convince her. The crescent shaped forest that surrounded our town was only a few kilometers thick at its widest part, so wherever these trails led couldn’t be that deep into the woods.   
  
“Come on,” I prodded, “Let's just go in a little ways to see if there is anything worth exploring. If we find something cool, we can come back this weekend and take a closer look. It’ll give us something to talk about on the rest of our way.”  
  
“Mmmm okay…” Lily said hesitantly, “But only for a moment. I don’t want mum to worry.”  
  
At that, we veered off the road onto one of these paths. The woods were thick and the trail was clearly not formed from anything natural that my nine year old brain could imagine. The path appeared to be made by a person, but there was only enough space cleared through the forest that two children could barely walk through comfortably. I couldn’t imagine an adult trying to navigate the trail. Just as I was about to declare that there is nothing worth seeing in this temperate jungle, Lily pointed out what looked like a clearing in the woods further down the path. Sure enough, it looked like there was light shining through another entrance to this cavern of overgrowth.  
  
We emerge into a very large, nearly perfect circular clearing in the trees. The only feature of this circle is the waist high grass that replaced the trees, forming this large round field. I did not have a very good idea of distance at that age, but if I had to guess, the field appeared to have a diameter of about four football fields, English or American. We stood there for a second, trying to imagine what caused this strange formation in the woods, when we heard a sound. Despite this sounds being ingrained in my brain to this day, I still find it hard to actually describe. When I first moved to America, we lived near a high school. During the American football season, we could sometimes heard the speakers making game announcements from our home. Despite not being able to understand any individual word, the direction and tone of the voice all but verified that was the source of that booming voice. That noise always caused me deep fear and dread, it sounded eerily like what Lily and I heard in that field. At the time though, we had no reason to be afraid, after walking through a silent forest the noise was a welcomed companion, even if we couldn’t understand the words it was saying.   
  
The strange thing was that this loud speaker, or whatever it was, was so loud that we definitely would have heard it on our walk home, or at least while we were walking through the path, but it only seemed to “turn on” when we entered the clearing. Without speaking, as if pulled in by the indistinct voice, Lily and I started towards the direction of the noise which appeared to be coming from the other side of the circle. We waded through the tall grass with no concern with what may be lurking beneath, or what bugs may be biting our arms and legs. By the time we reached the other side, the sun had dipped beneath the treeline and dusk was quickly setting in. The first thing we noticed upon reaching the other side of the clearing was another path like the one we took to get here, but this time the path left plenty of room if an adult decided to hike through. Actually, the forest was noticeably less dense on this side of the circle, perhaps that is why we could hear this phantom in the woods.   
  
Lily started in but I stopped her. “We don’t know what's in there, at least let me go first, just in case.”  
  
I led us in, and roughly another 100 meters down this new path, the trail turned sharply to the right through a chain-linked fence and towards the noise that had shifted to our right sides. The noise was getting louder and closer, but no matter how close we got, we still could not make out the words the voice was saying. We approached the chained fence, heeding the cautions of the “Keep Out” signs that lined the fence. Surrounding this sign were many similar signs that appeared to be in different languages. I didn’t know any other languages at the age but something in my mind told me that all of these signs had the same vague warning.  
  
Past the chain linked fence was a rusted building very similar in appearance to the ones I have seen in other parts of the forest, but this one was much bigger, and much more dilapidated. It looked like no one has worked here in fifty years, with rust and decay overtaking nearly all parts of any unnatural structure. There was no other signage, nothing to indicate who owned this abandoned operation, no sign of anyone stepping foot here in god knows how long. In front of the main industrial building was a pile of rubbish. Industrial waste consisting of metal, wood, springs, and something else… a statue?  
  
We were probably 50 meters (150 Feet) away from the pile of debris, but the more I looked the more I could make out something sticking out of the top of the roughly 3 meter (9 foot) tall pile. It looked like a large wooden head. It had two large, dark eyes like burnt out headlights, hair consisting of two copper wires sticking out of both sides of it’s head, and a mouth carved right into the wood like a…  
  
“It looks like a puppet, like the one on stings,” said Lily, dazed by what was in front of us.   
  
I looked at her, it was at that moment I realized that the voice, the sound, had stopped. We were again surrounded by silence. Just then, a deafening sound like bending metal engulfed the silence. We reflexively covered our ears and Lily started screaming. After a few seconds, the sound stopped as suddenly as it began. We were frozen in fear. I slowly looked back through the fence to see the dark eyes of “the puppet” fully lit and the head now standing upright, facing directly towards us, mouth partially opened. I managed to suck in a single breath in that moment of stillness.  
  
Then The Puppet jerked its head, cocking it slightly to one side and clumsily jerked it’s opposite shoulder out of the rubbish pile. We watched as this thing, in a jerking motion as if it was in desperate need of oil, began to free itself from its tomb. Suddenly the voice started again, as if the distorted voice came from the open mouth of this… thing. Lily was right, the more the puppet revealed itself, the more it looked like a towering marionette made of metal and wood, and the two bright headlight eyes stayed fixed on us, the head barely moving as the puppet struggled to free itself. Finally, in a series of unnatural movements, the puppet jerked upright, the whole entity appearing to be held up by a series of nonexistent stings. Then it started walking.  
  
One jerking step towards us was enough to snap me out of my daze. I grabbed Lily’s arm and yanked her away from the fence and back towards the path we came from. I ran with Lily’s arm in my hand until the metal bending noise rang through the air again, and I let go of Lily’s arm to cover my ears. When we reached the clearing, the metal noise stopped but the loudspeaker voice continued behind us. I removed my hands from my ears as we entered the tall grass. I was relieved to hear Lily running through the grass right behind me. I was too scared to look back, I was too scared to breathe, the only thing going through my head was \*Gotta get home, mum is going to kill me, dad is going to kill me, gotta get home.\* We charged into the tight tunnel of branches we had entered the clearing from.   
  
The narrow path was shorter than I remembered and the sound of leaves and branches brushing past me drowned out the sound of the voice over the trees, the voice of the puppet. Finally, I broke through the other side of the tunnel, back onto the road, now covered in the darkness of a dusk becoming night. I fell on my hands and knees, trying to catch my breath, embarrassing the silence I missed so much. But then the silence caused a realization, there shouldn't be silence right now at all. I should be hearing another set of panting, a whimper, Lily was being uncharacteristically silent after experiencing something like that. I looked over my shoulder.  
  
Lily was gone and I never saw her again. The last thing she ever said to another person was “It looks like a puppet, like the ones on strings.”

  
I don't know if any of you have experienced anything similar to that. Recently they started having an announcement after the monthly tornado siren tests that sounds like that voice from all those years before. No one ever believed what happened, my parents think I lost her on the way home, which is kinda true, but they act like I did something to her. I swear it was that puppet, and I think I am going to make it my goal for next year to save up the funds to take a trip back to Sundown, see if I can't at least find that old sawmill with all the signs again. Also if anyone has any idea of the area or where that might be, don't be afraid to reach out.
