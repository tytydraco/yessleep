This year, we spent Halloween at a theme park not too far away from where we live. Come October, the park always gets turned into this amazingly sinister ghost town. All the whimsical, colorful decorations are taken down and replaced with spooky ones. Cobwebs, skeletons, body parts, tombstones, what have you. The ride controllers and operators wear zombie make-up and their uniforms are torn and smeared with fake blood. They'll also give you little jumpscares occasionally when they're checking your seat's lap bars. All the eateries are selling "creepy" food and drinks—cupcakes with grimaces painted on the icing, chocolate coated grapes made to look like eyeballs and the like. I was actually amazed by just how creative and well-done everything was. My favorite part, though—my favorite part *by far*—were the actors patrolling the streets. 

They came out when it got dark, all marching up the main street in an unearthly parade to the tact of beating drums, accompanied by eerie, distant sirens. Their costumes and masks were way more thought-out than those of the other employees. Their makeup was obviously professionally done and looked downright horrifying. No two monsters were alike, and they all had their own personality, uniquely tailored to the roles they embodied. There had to be over forty of them. 

They walked around the park seemingly at random, but I figured they all had certain routes to adhere to. They'd push through the crowds, taking their chance to either suddenly appear behind or in front of you without warning. The ones who brandished "weapons" would suddenly raise them or swing them at you, stopping just before actually making contact. Some would creep up on you while you were waiting in line for something; others boldly carved their way through the masses, glowering and baring their teeth as they forced people to step aside. Of course, they'd sometimes stop for a picture if you dared to come up to them and asked nicely, but they'd never break character. Despite knowing they couldn't hurt me, my heart would be sent racing whenever one of them worked their magic on me.

Which happened a lot.

I was found fodder for the actors. I'm a huge horror nut, but I won't pretend I don't scare easily—I screamed, whimpered or yelped at every trick that was played on me. Just about every monster in the park managed to get me to jump at least once during my stay, and I won't pretend I didn't like it. The way my heart skipped a beat each time, the way my knees would give out for a split second and my voice ceased to obey me, my lips releasing a small cry before I could stop myself. I don't get that kind of a thrill from scary video games and movies anymore. 

I think my favorite monster was the guy with the bloodied face in the black leather duster and cowboy hat. He carried an axe—not a hatchet, a whole axe, which he at times raised high over the heads of visitors standing close enough or took swings with, causing those around him to quickly step back. He lifted his head to me when I got out of his way as he marched on by me. I simply appreciated the attention to detail there, even though he wasn't exceptionally gross or scary. He had also been the one beating the bass drum at the monster parade.

The whole time, I was walking hand in hand with my boyfriend. We had already gotten separated in the crowd during the day and I'd nearly pissed my pants, so now that it was dark and the actors were out and about, the prospect was even more harrowing—especially since he had both of our phones in his backpack. That left us with no easy way of finding each other again. Why didn't I have my phone on me, you ask? Well, I was being stupid that morning and put on clothes without any pockets. 

Either way, Conrad (that's the name of said boyfriend) and I had arrived at the park in the early noon, and from the beginning, I hadn't been able to take my eyes off a plushie I'd seen at one of those carnival game stands. It was a huge round pug with big, pleading eyes. I didn't intend to show Conny how much I loved it. After all, I'm a sensible, economically-thinking adult woman who likes grown-up stuff. To my surprise though, he ended up pulling me over to the stand in question. There, he whipped out his wallet and announced that he'd play until he got the pug. He did, after a while, and when he handed it to me my cheeks were beet-red. There's nothing hotter than when somebody just *gets* that your little heart is secretly set on something, is there? So you see, my emotional attachment to this stuffed animal not only hailed from its cuteness, but also from the fact that Conny had won it for me. His act of kindness simply made it feel thrice as great.

And that's how we continued our tour, carrying between us the oversized plushie. I was so goddamn happy. That was until we entered the maze. 

There are several uniquely themed horror mazes around the park this time of year. The one Conny and I chose was a rather classical haunted house type of attraction. "Losthope Manor", they called it—the name was painted on the arch above the doorway in white, squiggly letters. Again, I was astounded by the creativity put into the setup. There was a whole backstory to the mansion which was relayed to us by disjointed bits of text smeared in fake blood on the walls in the waiting rooms. It was a little hard to read, but definitely fitting and very immersive; not too mention that it helped kill some time.

*"No one has ever survived their stay at Losthope Manor. Be warned! It's not too late to turn back! You may yet be spared."*

Dozens of hangman's nooses hung from the ceiling of the first room, dangling eerily above our heads. High up on the wall to our right, there was another bit that read,

*"Algernon Blackwood, the wretched soul who built this house, opened the gates to the spirit world! Tormented creatures trapped in limbo crawled out and attached themselves to this godforsaken place!"*

"Kind of dramatic, don't you think?" Conny asked with a crooked smile.

"Yeah, but I like it," I replied, trying to reach up to touch a noose but failing. "Gets me nostalgic for some older horror movies."

"Sure." My boyfriend gave my hand an indulgent little squeeze. He didn't scare as easily as I did, but I had a feeling he rather enjoyed being the fearless type. He'd laugh his ass off every time I got spooked. 

The writings went on to reveal something or other about the various folks who'd lived in Losthope Manor over time, all of which had either been occultists, madmen or murderers. It was getting pretty tedious so both Conrad and I were relieved when it was finally our turn to walk the maze. Anticipation replaced boredom and frustration when our group was ushered into the first little hallway by a zombie in a messy park uniform. The door was slammed shut behind us. The corridor was dimly lit and narrow, forcing us all to uncomfortably squeeze together as we walked along. A fog machine, hidden somewhere out of sight, continuously poured smoke onto the floor. At the end of the tunnel, a pale blue light awaited us, giving the mist an otherworldly hue. It was pretty, in a skillfully disquieting way. Conny and I were walking in the front of the group, another couple and three teenagers trailing behind us, all whispering excitedly. No one dared to raise their voice, for it was deadly quiet. 

Just a few steps separated us from the glowing doorway when all of a sudden, a tall, dark silhouette appeared in its frame. Most of us, myself included, gasped sharply or stumbled back. The shadow vanished in a flash and we all started giggling—it was as if some kind of seal had been broken. The nervousness lingered, but we were ready for a scare. I hugged the plushie to my chest with one arm, latched onto Conrad with the other, and dashed forth towards the blue light. All hell broke loose the second we entered the first chamber of Losthope Manor. 

It was a small, cramped space with a couple tall, old wooden closets to both sides and a rocking chair in the corner. On it, with her back turned to us, sat a woman, clad in all white, stiff rags, rocking back and forth rapidly and with such force that the chair was producing pained creaking noises. In the background, a clock was ticking loudly, the sound of screams and maniacal laughter forming a nerve-racking undercurrent that by itself would have been enough to set my heart racing. When we were halfway through the room, the woman in the chair abruptly turned around and let out an ear-piercing shriek, causing me to jump once more. Conrad let out an unbridled laugh which quickly morphed into a shout of surprise when the closet door behind him was flung open from the inside and an actor reached out to grab him by the shoulder.

We darted out the door, squealing and cackling. The room we now found ourselves in was similarly small, and most of its space was taken up by the king-size bed right in its center. It was occupied by two skeletons. The pair looked authentic enough; tufts of matted hair hung from their skulls and bits of rotten flesh and faded clothing clung to their bones. But the thing that actually creeped us out was the large bulge moving under the blanket from one side of the mattress to the other. The stifled giggles that came out from underneath turned into high-pitched chuckles when the formerly hidden person dropped onto the floor on all fours and darted over to me. I didn't catch more than a short glimpse of them before they snatched the plushie from my hands and hastily lumbered off, hunched over, whooping and cackling. 

At the time, I thought it was all in good fun. I figured they wanted me to give chase; I fully expected the actor to be waiting right behind the next door frame to throw the pug at me, giving me one last scare as they did. Without thinking twice, I hurried after the figure into the next room, but irritatingly, they didn't stop there. They threw me a quick glance over their shoulder, revealing a horrid grimace—a grin that actually seemed to split their face in half, wide, bloodshot eyes bulging out of way too deep sockets. Their contorted features were framed by messy red hair. Their visage sent a chill down my spine, but I didn't stop my pursuit. 

"Give that back!" I shouted, reaching out to grab them but not succeeding as they turned away just in time. "Cut it the fuck out! I mean it!"

No response, just more giggles. I was starting to get pissed. This was too childish for my liking. I just wanted my plushie back and was hardly in the mood for playing catch with this admittedly athletic freak. 

Suddenly, they disappeared behind a curtain. I'd been so focused on the chase that I hadn't really taken note of the change in our surroundings up to that point, and I still couldn't be made to care. I sprinted straight after them, flinging the curtain aside and finding myself in a chamber that didn't quite look like it was part of the attraction. It was bigger, well-lit and full of boxes and props. I frowned in confusion. This was a dead end. There were no other doors in sight. The actor had apparently led me into a storage room. I was starting to get a really queasy feeling in my stomach, and not the pleasant kind from earlier.

The performer themself had come to a halt a few feet ahead of me and was now slowly turning around. They dropped the pug carelessly onto the floor, kicking it aside as they took a step towards me. I swallowed. My mind was running wild, trying to process what in the hell was going on. Something had changed. Something was wrong. 

The actor opened their mouth, revealing several rows of curved, needle-like teeth. 

I didn't jump, didn't cry out or squeal. I was too afraid to scream. This was a new, paralyzing type of fear, one that I had never felt before. I was seemingly rooted to the spot, suddenly unable to move. I wanted to run, but when I finally regained control over my body, all I could do was back off and stagger into a solid wall. I spun around, feeling tears come to my eyes when I realized that, impossible though it may have been, the curtains I'd entered through moments earlier were *gone*. Desperation gripped me, enmeshing my very soul. I wanted to pound against this wretched wall now, slam my fists into it until my bones would splinter, but I already knew it was hopeless. 

Where in God's name had this monster taken me? Where was Conny? Was he alright or had the rest of the group been attacked as well? I could only pray they'd make it out alive. I most definitely wouldn't. Tears were rolling freely down my cheeks as all kinds of thoughts ran through my head.

*I would have been so happy if I'd gotten to stay alive. It could have all been so lovely. Life had been great up to that point.*

The redhead inched closer, tongue lolling out of its gaping maw. It was the most disgusting thing I'd ever seen. Strands of thick saliva were dripping from its lower lip…

*I had to put up a fight.*

Sure, this thing was going to end up devouring me. But I would render its experience a thoroughly unpleasant one. 

Leaning back against the wall, I whipped up my leg and kicked the creature right in the teeth. The tip of my boot connected splendidly with the upper front row of its teeth, causing several of them to crack and break. The monster let out a warped howl that nearly made my stomach turn. It raised a trembling hand to its face, almost as if in disbelief. Spotting another chance, I decided to take it. Summoning all my courage, I took a leap and landed right on the creature's ugly, hairy naked feet. Another cry of pain, the underlying fury unmistakable. It jumped me, knocking me to the group and instantly going for my throat, wrapping its short, stumpy fingers around it and squeezing. I tried to kick and thrash around and wriggle free, but to no avail. In one last act of defiance, I craned my neck and hurled a ball of spit at the grimace looming over me. It sailed right into its open mouth. *Bull's eye.*

I knew it was over. I had no strength left to fight. I lost control of my bladder, somehow finding it in me to feel ashamed when I felt my pants get wet. As my vision blurred, I let my gaze wander the room, searching for something else to look at during my final moments. My eyes fell on the plushie, lying lonely a bit off to the side. A warm feeling settled in my chest as I regarded it. At that moment, I only wished for Conny to be there to hold me. I couldn't have that, of course, but seeing the prize he'd won me instilled an almost similar sense of comfort within me. My lips stretched into a smile before everything turned black. 

And then, all of a sudden, the monster's grip around my throat disappeared. Air flooded my lungs as I reared up, greedily sucking it in. Despite the ringing in my ears and the sharp pain in my throat, consciousness returned to me astonishingly fast. The creature that had been squatting on my chest moments prior was cowering on the ground beside me. It was groaning and whimpering in fear, covering its head with both hands. Gasping and wheezing, I looked up.

Standing above us was the man in the black duster. The axe in his hand was gleaming in the bright light of the ceiling lamp. He glared at the redhead with such hatred, such accusation and such immense authority that even I found it intimidating. He took a swing with the axe, hitting the floor with a clunking noise. The blade came down mere inches away from the needle-toothed monster's head, halving a couple strands of frizzy hair. The creature let out a high-pitched whine as it hastily scurried off, disappearing behind a stack of boxes where it curled up into something akin to the fetal position. 

The man didn't say a word. Instead, he took off his hat and pressed it to his chest before offering me a hand and helping me to my feet. I stared at him wordlessly. He stared back, not making a sound. I tilted my head to the right. He mirrored the movement. 

"What is that thing?" I pressed out, my voice sounding like I'd swallowed a fistful of gravel. 

I received no answer.

"Who are you? How did you find me?"

Nothing. He held my gaze. He started patting his neck, then pointed at mine. 

"I think I'm fine," I croaked. "If that's what you mean."

He nodded, then cocked his head and raised a questioning brow. 

"Yes! Yes, I wanna go, I gotta get outta here, I—" I fell silent, reaching up to bring a hand to my burning throat. 

He nodded again, putting his hat back on and motioned for me to turn around. The wall had been replaced by the curtains I'd come in through. I looked back at the cowboy in utter confusion. "What is this place?" I asked weakly.

The man merely shrugged and bent down to pick up the pug plush. He dusted it off before holding it out to me with a small, lopsided smile. I gratefully wrapped my arms around it. The stranger then placed a gentle hand on my shoulder, ushering me forth through the curtains. He led me through the remaining rooms of the haunted house, never lifting his palm from my back. I watched in a daze as *actors* sprang back to both sides as we passed through. The dense fog drifting at our feet drew back wherever he stepped, as though his boots sliced right through it. Everything moved by in a blur until we were finally back outside. The cool night air greeted me like an old friend. And there was Conrad, dear, sweet Conny, nervously pacing to and fro beside the exit. I wasted no time in throwing myself into his arms. He hugged me tightly, his warm breath caressing my ear and his heartbeat loud enough for me to hear through the sweater he pressed my face against. 

"Oh my God," he gasped when he let go of me, pulling back as if to look me over and check if I was still in one piece. "Are you alright?" Noticing the large wet spot on my pants, his face scrunched up with concern. "You must be freezing, let's… let's get you out of here. I'll buy you new pants in one of the stores, or—or you can have mine, if you want, I don't even care…" His voice trailed off. "Oh God," he repeated. 

"It's okay," I rasped out. "I'm fine, honey."

"No… no, you're obviously not… I'm so sorry. There was so much fog all of a sudden, I didn't see where you'd gone off to. I tried to look for you but then some actors came along and just *grabbed me* and dragged me into the next room…" He took a deep, trembling breath. "I guess I sort of knew something was wrong, but I figured you'd meet me by the exit, I *hoped*—but you weren't there, and I straight-up panicked. None of the actors would listen to me when I asked for you, except for… except for him."

We both turned to look back at the black-clad cowboy only to find that he was gone. Conny swallowed audibly before adding, "He ran right in when I told him. He made me wait here in the meantime. I didn't know what else to do. I wanted to come with him at first, but he pushed me back. So I stayed behind. What happened back there?"

I shook my head, still nauseous and dazed. "I really couldn't say. I'll… I'll tell you when we get home, or on the way, but I just need to collect myself right now."

"That's fine, too," Conny said, giving me a peck on the cheek. "I'm just glad you're okay. Let's go."

I gave him a slow nod, allowing him to put his arm around me and carefully guide me down the street back to the park entrance. We had almost reached the gates when the sounds of sirens and a beating drum began to draw closer from behind. 

"Is that the parade?" I asked confusedly, turning back around. 

"I think so," Conny replied, equally puzzled. "Looks like they're marching out earlier than planned."

We lingered on the sidewalk, watching as the ominous procession drew ever closer. I flinched when I laid eyes on their helmsman. Beating the bass drum, the man in the black duster led the trail of hobbling, growling, glowering creatures, more and more streaming out of the buildings and crowds to join them. His battle axe fastened by a belt on his back and his gaze steely and straightforward, my savior strode by us without paying us so much as a glance. I spotted the red-haired monster among the others, but I was grateful it didn't take notice of me. Its heavy footfalls aligned perfectly with the tact of the beating drum, just like the rest of the performers. They trotted along, obediently following their commander. 

My heart dropped into my stomach and I grabbed Conny's sleeve. At that moment, I understood. Not everything that had happened, but the dark cowboy's role in the ordeal. And that's probably the real reason he was my favorite monster at the theme park this year.
