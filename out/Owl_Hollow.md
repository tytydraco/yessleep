Firstly here’s the location of Owl Hollow as it doesn’t appear on most maps: 45.35988° N, 121.37571° W  , I honestly don’t know why I’m even writing this.
It’s not like anyone’s going to believe me anyway.
Maybe it’s just to get it out of my head. Maybe it’s some kind of warning. I don't know.

Last October, I went hiking alone near Mount Hood. I was trying to get away from everything, work, noise, people. I found this spot on an old forest service map called Owl Hollow, near Jordan Creek.
Sounded perfect. Secluded, quiet. Barely even mentioned online.

The first few hours were fine. Peaceful, even. Just the sound of the creek and my boots crunching gravel.
It felt good. Like I could breathe again.

But sometime in the afternoon, that feeling started creeping in.
You know the one.
Like somebody’s watching you.

At first, I tried to shake it off. Told myself I was being stupid. Big woods, alone, of course you’re going to feel jumpy.
But it kept getting worse.

around 3 p.m. I looked off the trail into the trees and there were a pair of eyes staring at me through the brush.
Not blinking.
Just... watching.

It wasn’t a deer. I know what deer look like. This was different.
Lower to the ground. Wrong shape. No sound at all.

I kept hiking. Probably faster than I should have.

About an hour later, I came around a bend and there they were.
A man and a woman standing in the middle of the trail.
I don’t know how to explain it, everything about them just felt off immediately. Their clothes were weird, like they’d walked out of an old photograph. Faded colors, stiff fabric, almost... dusty?

I tried to say hello, maybe ask if they needed help but my voice just kinda died.
They didn’t say anything either. Just stared.

And when they passed me, they both turned their heads at the same time and smiled.

I can’t even describe it right. It wasn’t human.
Their mouths stretched way too wide, and their teeth were... wrong. Sharp and dirty. And their eyes fuckin turned black. Not like dark irises black. Like bottomless pits.

I almost threw up.
I almost ran.
But they just kept walking like nothing had happened, disappearing into the woods behind me.

I should’ve left right then. I should’ve found a way around them and sprinted back to my truck, never looked back.
But I didn’t.
I kept going. Dumbass.

By the time I set up camp that night, my hands were shaking so bad I could barely get the tent up.
It didn’t matter. I wasn’t sleeping anyway.

As the sun went down, the woods around me got... wrong.
Too quiet.
No birds. No bugs. Nothing but the creek and the sound of my own heart pounding in my ears.

Then I started seeing them.

First one.
Then two.
Then more.

Seventeen or eighteen of them, crouched in the trees, peeking from behind rocks, half-buried in the tall grass.
All with the same twisted smiles. All with those black, black eyes.

I sat there by the fire, clutching my pistol, feeling like I was gonna pass out from terror.
They didn’t move. They didn’t get closer. They just watched.

I don’t know what snapped, but I stood up and fired two shots straight into the air.
The sound echoed through the trees, sharp and painful.

They didn’t even flinch.

That’s when I ran.
I grabbed my pack and ran like my life depended on it, because honestly, I think it did.

I don’t remember getting back to the car. I don’t even remember driving home. I just remember slamming the door behind me and sitting there in the dark for hours, shaking, gun still in my hand.

I haven’t told anybody until now.
People would think I’m crazy. Hell, I think I’m crazy sometimes when I replay it in my head.

But I know what I saw.
And I’m telling you
If you ever find yourself near Owl Hollow, turn around.
Get out while you can.

Some places are better off forgotten.
