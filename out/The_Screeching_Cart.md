Since I was a kid, I’ve been haunted by chronic insomnia. The doctors never found anything physically wrong with me, but the sleepless nights piled up, and the exhaustion became a constant companion. I’ve tried everything: medications, meditation, therapy; but nothing ever really worked. When you’re awake during the hours when everyone else is asleep, your mind starts to wander into dark places. Lately, those dark places have been consumed by something I can’t explain.

Growing up in El Salvador, everyone knows about *La Carreta Chillona* (in english: The Screeching Cart). The legend dates back centuries, whispered from generation to generation. They say the cart is a ghostly remnant of an old executioner’s wagon, cursed to roam the streets at night, searching for the souls of those who have sinned. The cart’s appearance is always a bad omen, a sign that death is near. But no matter how many times I heard the story, I never really believed it. Until last night.

It was one of those nights when sleep felt like a distant memory, so I sat by the window, watching the empty street below. My neighborhood is usually silent at night, not exactly quiet because the night itself seems to be alive, however this oen night around 3 AM, the usual silence of the night was murdered by an ominous sound. At first, it was just a faint creaking, like an old door being slowly opened. But the sound grew louder, deeper, until it felt like the entire world was groaning in agony. Then came the chains... heavy, rusted chains dragging along the pavement, clanking in a rhythm that made my skin crawl.

I forced myself to look outside, and that’s when I saw it.

The Screeching Cart emerged from a fog that had inexplicably rolled in, its massive, rotting wooden frame barely held together by rusted iron nails. The wheels were warped and uneven, each turn producing a hideous screech that pierced the stillness of the night. The cart’s planks were cracked and splintered, with large gaps revealing glimpses of something dark and writhing inside, something that I couldn’t, and didn’t want to fully see.

It was pulled by two skeletal oxen, their bones clattering with each step they took. They seemed to glow faintly, an eerie, sickly light that cast long, twisted shadows on the ground. Their empty eye sockets were dark voids, and their jaws hung open in a permanent, silent scream.

The driver was no less terrifying. Cloaked in tattered black robes, the figure slouched over the reins, its face hidden beneath a hood. I couldn’t see its eyes, but I could feel its gaze on me, cold and judgmental. The air around the cart was thick, suffocating, as if the night itself was being swallowed by the darkness that surrounded it.

The screeching... it wasn’t just a sound. It was a feeling, a vibration that rattled my bones and made my teeth ache. It was as if the cart was tearing through reality itself, leaving nothing but despair in its wake. The sound burrowed into my mind, each turn of the wheels sending waves of nausea and dread through my body. I wanted to look away, to run, but I couldn’t. I was trapped, a prisoner of my own fear.

As the cart passed beneath my window, I felt an overwhelming sense of cold, like the warmth was being sucked out of my body. My heart pounded so hard I thought it might explode, and every breath was a struggle, like the air had thickened into something solid. It felt like the cart was pulling something from me, something vital, but I couldn’t tell what. All I knew was that I was fading, becoming less, as the cart moved on.

Then, just as suddenly as it appeared, The Screeching Cart disappeared into the fog, taking its horrifying sounds with it. The silence that followed was deafening, oppressive, as if the world was holding its breath. I collapsed onto the floor, my body trembling uncontrollably, drenched in cold sweat. My chest was tight, my skin clammy, and my mind a whirlwind of terror and confusion. I could barely think, let alone move.

Today, the feeling hasn’t left me. My heart still races at every little sound, and there’s a constant chill in the air, no matter how many blankets I wrap around myself. I can still hear the faint echoes of the cart’s screeching in the back of my mind, like a distant, horrible memory that refuses to fade. 

I’m terrified to sleep, but I’m even more terrified of what will happen if I don’t. The Screeching Cart came for me last night, and I know it’s not done with me yet.

Please, if anyone knows how to stop this, I need your help. I don’t think I can survive another night like that.
