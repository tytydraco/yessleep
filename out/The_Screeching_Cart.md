Growing up in El Salvador, everyone knows about La Carreta Chillona (in english: The Screeching Cart). The legend dates back centuries, whispered from generation to generation. They say the cart is a ghostly remnant of an old executioner’s wagon, cursed to roam the streets at night, searching for the souls of those who have sinned. The cart’s appearance is always a bad omen, a sign that death is near. But no matter how many times I heard the story, I never really believed it. Not until a few days ago at least.

It was one of those nights when sleep felt like a distant memory, I sat by my room's window, watching the empty street below. My neighborhood is usually silent, not exactly quiet because night itself seems to be alive in a way, the sounds of the wind, night animals and a peaceful yet somber atmosphere is what one might expect; however, this one night around 4 AM, that  usual nightlife was murdered by a sudden and heavy change in its atmosphere. 

At first I felt an overwhelming sense of cold, like the warmth was being sucked out of my body and out of everything surrounding me, I saw my windows started to fog up, outside I also saw a heavy fog coming from what seemed to be nowhere. Then came that sound, an ominous sound. It was just like a faint creaking, like an old door being slowly opened; but the sound grew louder, deeper and heavier until it felt like the entire world was groaning in agony. Then came the sound of chains... huge, rusted chains dragging along the pavement, clanking in a rhythm that made my skin crawl.I didn't want to, but every cell in my body screamed at me to look outside, like an intrusive thought that just seemed to slowly take control of my actions. What happened next is something I will forever regret from now until the day I die, which may be sooner than I thought.

It was there, The Screeching Cart, I saw as it emerged from the fog that had rolled in, its massive, rotting wooden frame that seemed to barely hold together. The wheels were warped and uneven, each turn producing a hideous screech that pierced the stillness of the night. The cart’s planks were cracked and splintered, with large gaps revealing glimpses of something dark and writhing inside, something that I couldn’t, and didn’t want to fully see. It seemed, contrary to folklore, to be moving by its own, though I might be wrong given the fact that the cart itself drew on all my attention, what I am 100% sure is this: there was no driver.

There was this aura around the cart that seemed thick, suffocating, as if the night itself was being swallowed by the darkness that surrounded it.The screeching... it wasn’t just a sound. It was a feeling, a vibration that rattled my bones and made my teeth ache. It was as if the cart was tearing through reality itself, leaving nothing but despair in its wake. The sound burrowed into my mind, each turn of the wheels sending waves of nausea and dread through my body. I wanted to look away, to run, but I couldn’t. I was trapped, a prisoner of my own fear.

My heart pounded so hard I thought it might explode, and every breath was a struggle, like the air had thickened into something solid. It felt like the cart was pulling something from me, something vital, but I couldn’t tell what. All I knew was that I was fading, becoming less, as the cart moved on.

Then, just as suddenly as it appeared, The Screeching Cart disappeared into the fog, taking its horrifying sounds with it. The silence that followed was deafening, oppressive, as if the world was holding its breath. I collapsed onto the floor, my body trembling uncontrollably, drenched in cold sweat. My chest was tight, my skin clammy, and my mind a whirlwind of terror and confusion. I could barely think, let alone move.

Today, the feeling hasn’t left me. My heart still races at every little sound, and there’s a constant chill in the air, no matter how many blankets I wrap around myself. I can still hear the faint echoes of the cart’s screeching in the back of my mind, like a distant, horrible memory that refuses to fade. 

I’m terrified to sleep, but I’m even more terrified of what will happen if I don’t. The Screeching Cart came for me last night, and I know it’s not done with me yet. I know I’m going to die, so this will be my first and last log in here. I know I will die soon because when I started typing this post, I heard a screech.
