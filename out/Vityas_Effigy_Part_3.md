Sandra’s funeral was small.  I hadn’t expected a whole bunch of people to show up, but there were only seven of us, not counting the priest.  Victor, Curly, Alice and I all rode together, while Daisy showed up later.  The other two people were an older couple, wrinkled and round, their faces etched with sorrow.  Curly told me they were Sandra’s parents.  It was a short service, but very sweet.  Mr. and Mrs. Gulley each giving a short eulogy for their daughter, highlighting how kind and creative and loving she had been.  I reminded myself to call my own mother once I got home.  

The four of us went to lunch after the funeral, deciding to leave the gravesite proceedings to Sandra’s family.  Daisy said she wasn’t feeling well and went home early.  Victor didn’t let go of my hand the entire time we ate, constantly rubbing his thumb across my knuckles.  It was just as much a soothing behavior for him as it was comforting to me; he was never truly at rest unless his hands were occupied.  None of us really talked much, and by the time Victor and I got back to his house, he changed his clothes, went into his studio and didn’t come out the rest of the day, at least not until I went to tell him I’d made some food for us.  My mom had instilled cooking skills in me from a young age, so it wasn’t hard for me to whip up a batch of *bibimbap,* a traditional mixed rice dish, from whatever we had in the fridge.  I poked my head into the ground-floor studio, noticing him standing over a workbench with his back to me.

“Vic?”  He didn’t respond, tinkering with something on the workbench.  There was a sort of trance state he got into when he was working that wasn’t easily broken, but I’d accidentally discovered an effective way of snapping him out of it.  “Hey, Vitya,” I called again, softer this time.  

Something to know about Slavic names: most people don’t use a person’s government name unless they’re in a professional relationship or mere acquaintances, and will instead use a nickname.  The first time I called him that, Victor gave me a weird look and said no one had called him that besides his mother, and that was when he was a kid.  I felt a bit embarrassed and asked if I should not call him that, but he said he didn’t mind.  It made him feel safe, helped him ground himself.  This time, he glanced over his shoulder before turning around, hiding whatever he was working on behind his back.  I took a second to admire how he looked in his “working clothes”, a simple black tank top and a battered pair of jeans.

“What’s up?” he asked, trying to look casual.

“I made dinner, you hungry?”

“Huh?  Oh, uh, yeah, I’ll be right up.”  He waved me off and grabbed a rag to wipe his hands.  I didn’t question what he was working on; my birthday was coming up, and he’d been hinting that he might make something for me as a present, and I knew he’d want it to be a surprise.  

We ate dinner in silence, broken only by Victor telling me in a quiet tone that the food was good, and went to bed early, falling asleep with the TV on.  Both of us were exhausted.  Neither of us talked about Sandra.

There was a cloud over all of us at the next gallery night.  Curly didn’t wave at me this time, too focused on his banjo, and I noticed the fingertips of his picking hand were raw, almost to the point of bleeding.  I could tell Alice had been crying hard, and even the normally jovial Daisy was silent and sullen, her bruised arms constantly fidgeting.  Sandra’s animations were still playing in their usual place, and the grisly snapshot of her corpse had been replaced by a small memorial display showing a photo of her smiling.  Seeing it made me want to cry.  Maybe this is sick of me to say, but I almost preferred the crime scene photo.  I'd liked Sandra, even for the short time I'd known her, and the crime scene photo was just surreal enough that for a moment of looking at it, I could pretend she was still with us.

That was the first time the group of us didn't get dinner after the gallery closed.  Curly and Alice left together as soon as they could, while Daisy slipped out at some point before closing time.  I spent the night at Victor's as usual, but at around 3am I woke to find he wasn't next to me.  Inspiration tended to strike him at odd hours, but every time I'd stayed the night, he stayed in bed with me until the respectable time of nine in the morning.  

When I went to his studio to check on him, I didn't find him working.  Instead, I found him sitting on a block of granite he'd just purchased recently, still in his pajamas, his head in his hands.  His shoulders were shaking.  Trying not to make too much noise, I descended the stairs, tucking my housecoat tighter around me, and rested a hand on his back.

“You okay?” I asked.  Stupid question, I know, but I felt like I had to say something.  Victor flinched, looking up at me with bloodshot eyes before wrapping his arms around me and dissolving into sobs.  I'd never heard him cry before…and I never wanted to hear it again.  All I could do was hold him.

“Did I wake you?” he asked when he managed to calm himself a bit.

“No.”  I combed my fingers through his messy hair.  “Do you…do you want to talk about it?”  He took a long time to answer.

“Not really.”  Classic Victor.  He rarely wanted to talk about things that truly bothered or hurt him.  I figured I could ask again tomorrow when he was rested and not so upset.

“Let's go back to bed, all right?  It's late.”  He nodded, slowly and painfully unfolding his lanky body from the granite block.  He didn't always use his cane around the house as there were multiple surfaces he could lean on if his leg started bothering him, but I could tell it was stiff and sore, so I helped him up the stairs and back into bed before curling up next to him.

“You're too good to me, Livy,” he mumbled, grabbing my hand.  

“That's because you deserve good.”  I sat up for a moment and kissed his forehead.  “Get some rest, Vitya.”

The next couple of weeks were about as normal as I could get.  Work was plentiful, my roommate and I went to a movie on Thursday, and on Friday I stayed over with Victor.  Saturday night came, and I really didn't want to go to the gallery, but I also didn't want Victor to be alone.  He'd never really had many people that supported his talent growing up: his mother had died when he was young, and his father, an austere Ukrainian carpenter whom Victor spoke highly of, had been more concerned with maintaining his furniture store than actively fostering his son's love of art.  I wanted to be that person for him.  I didn't tell him that the gallery gave me the creeps, as he probably would have insisted I stop going, and I wasn't going to let him be alone in the same building as that creepy statue.

Seeing him in that room with it…I didn't know what to think.  Maybe I should have asked him about it sooner.  

Daisy didn't show up that night.  Or the next Saturday night.  I didn't know what to do.  None of the others knew where she lived, and I didn't want to make a nuisance of myself by calling the cops on her when she was probably just taking time to grieve.  However, after the third weekend in a row that she didn't come to the gallery, I had to do *something.*  So I decided to call up another old college friend, Andrew B.  I'd hung out with him and his twin brother Austin (Victor's freckle-faced buddy) a lot during my sophomore year, though they'd graduated soon after and I had lost touch.  As far as I knew from social media, Andrew had become a cop within the last few years.  He might be able to help me.  

It took him a while to answer the phone.

“*Hello?”*

“Yeah, hi, is this Andrew?”

*“It is, can I ask who's calling?”*  

“I don't know if you remember me, we went to the same uni a few years ago.  Olivia Song?”  There was a long pause.  

*“Oh, yeah, Livy!  Of course I remember you, how've you been, girl?”*  The small talk persisted for a while before I got down to business.

“I um…I didn't actually call just to reminisce.  There's something I need your help with.  Professionally.” 

*“Sure thing, whatcha need?”*  I knew I could count on Drew.  He'd always had a penchant for helping people.  Over the next hour or so, I gave him a summary of everything that happened.  I left out the part about the statue; Drew wasn't one to pooh-pooh the idea of the paranormal completely, but he was a certified skeptic.  He remained silent while I talked besides the occasional *“uh-huh”*  and “*yeah?”* to indicate he was still listening.  *“Ugh, yeah, the Gulley-Ransom case.  You didn't hear this from me, but I was one of the responding officers on that one.”*

“Really?” I asked.  

“*Sure was.  I'll never forget it…poor lady.  No one deserves to go out like that.”*  

“Agreed.  But now another one of the group hasn't shown up for three weeks straight.  I'm really worried, she seemed super upset the last time I saw her.”  I could hear Andrew scuffling around in a desk or something before he seemed to find what he was looking for.  “I just…I want to check up on her, but I don't know where she lives.  I think maybe somebody should do a welfare check or something?  Is that what it's called?”

“*Yeah, I can see if I can get somebody on that.  What's her name?”*

“Daisy.  It might not be her real name,” I warned, giving him her last name as well.  “You know, weird art people, they like picking some fancy pseudonym for their work.”  Andrew chuckled, and I could hear the scratching of a pen.  

*“No foolin’.  You remember Victor?”*  

“I mean…I've been dating him for the last couple months, so…”

*“You're* *dating* *him?”* Andrew asked, an incredulous tone to his voice.  *“Huh.  Always thought the dude had an angle grinder for a heart.  Anyway, listen, I gotta run, it's my fiancee's birthday and I promised to take her out to dinner, but I’ll take a look in the system.  I'll call you back if I find anything about your friend Daisy, okay?”*

“All right.  Thanks, Drew.  Tell Bridget I said hi and happy birthday, will you?”

*“Sure thing.”*

“Who was that?” my roommate asked as she came out of the bathroom, swathed in towels and looking like the star of a shampoo commercial.

“Old college friend.  We still on for the *Gilmore Girls* marathon?”  Kristen laughed, toweling off her hair.

“Honey, I will never pass up an opportunity to see baby-faced Jared.  Yes, we are still on.”

It took Andrew two days to get back to me.  He said what he’d found was serious enough that he couldn’t tell me over the phone, so I agreed to meet up with him at a local cafe.  I told Kristen where I was going and headed out, taking a jacket just in case.  

“Hey, it’s good to see you,” he said when I arrived at the cafe, pulling me in for a brief, brotherly side hug before we sat down.  We each ordered a drink before getting to the topic at hand.  “Before I tell you this, you need to promise me you won’t tell anyone else.  It’s against policy to give out details of ongoing investigations, and I don’t wanna lose my job over this.  Frankly, I’m only giving you this information because you’re the one who brought it to our attention and because you’re my friend.  I wouldn’t do this for just anyone.”  I promised I would keep the info to myself.  

“I just want to know if Daisy’s okay,” I said.  Andrew was quiet for a long time before he slowly shook his head.

“I’m so sorry,” he said.  “I hoped I’d have better news for you.”  He proceeded to tell me that he’d tracked down Daisy’s address (on the “bad side” of town) and gotten his sergeant’s permission to carry out a welfare check.  Unfortunately, Daisy hadn’t needed a welfare check for a good while by the time the police came around.  “The coroner hasn’t come out with the official report yet, but his initial estimate for how long she’s been dead is anywhere from a few days to maybe a week.  Again, we won’t know until he does the autopsy.  Probably.  She was um…she was in pretty bad shape, when we found her.”

“How bad?” I asked, my mind coming up with all sorts of horrible mental images.  He grimaced, taking a sip of his coffee.

“You don’t wanna know, Livy.  The general consensus is that she overdosed and went into a manic state before finally collapsing, but no one does all of *that,* even in a manic state.”  I leaned forward in my chair.

“So you think she was murdered–”

“Keep your voice down.”  Andrew shot me a warning look as another patron passed by on their way out the door.  I recalled just how much he was risking to tell me this and went quiet.  “It’s not my job to say or not, but in my opinion, based on what I’ve seen…there’s no way she did that to herself.”  I swallowed hard, suddenly getting a bit emotional.  

“Do you know if she has any family?”  He shook his head.

“Couldn’t find any.  I do know she had a baby when she was sixteen, but she gave the kid up for adoption pretty much as soon as it was born.  She really tried to clean herself up after that, got sober, went to rehab…” He trailed off, shaking his head again.  “I’m gonna level with you, Livy.  There’s something fishy going on here, and whatever it is, I think it has something to do with that art gallery you told me about.”  I stared into my latte for a few moments before getting an idea.

“What if you came to see it?” I asked.  “Not in an official capacity, obviously, but you could come check it out for yourself.  It’s pretty disturbing, but you might be able to catch something I haven’t.”  I figured I could show him where the statue was when we both went to the gallery; I didn’t want to tell him beforehand and risk him not taking me seriously.  He thought it over for a moment.

“Couldn’t hurt.  I can ask Bridget if she wants to come along, but I’m not sure she’d want to.  Honestly, weird art stuff was always more Austin’s thing.”

“Then why not ask him if he’ll come?” I asked.  “He and Victor were close back in the day, right?”

“Good point.”  I learned that Austin had managed to snag a job as a crime scene photographer at the same precinct Andrew worked at; it made sense, somehow.  Those two would likely have been inseparable even if they weren’t twins.

The gallery was busier than usual that night, the disappearance of two of its artists having caused a bit of a stir.  I met the twins across the street from the little stone church, and we headed inside, Austin looking about as nervous as I felt.  He’d always been fairly timid and introspective, only opening up if Andrew happened to be around.  Letting the twins take in the gallery at their own pace, I went to find Victor.  He didn’t like surprises, and I’d forgotten to text him that they were coming along.  I was sure he knew Andrew was a cop, but I didn’t want to point that out and give him the indication that something was wrong.  

Coming back to where the twins were milling around, I found Austin staring at a framed photograph on a pedestal, his face blanched and drawn.  Before I could ask if he was feeling all right, he called out for his brother, stuffing his hands in his pockets.  Andrew poked his head around a corner, a concerned expression on his face.  Clearly he’d heard something in Austin’s tone that he didn’t like.

“Let me guess,” he said, folding his arms.  “I’m going to want to see this?”  

“Yeah,” Austin said, jabbing one long finger at the picture.  “I think you are.”  He sounded equal parts angry and scared, and Andrew speed-walked over to see what had him so upset.  I did as well, peering at the photo and initially failing to understand what I was seeing.  Austin pulled Andrew to the side for a moment and whispered in his ear, frequently glancing back at the pedestal.

“What am I looking at here?” I asked, and both of the twins jumped, as if they’d quite forgotten I was there.  Austin ran a shaking hand through his hair before semi-calmly explaining that the picture in front of me was an autopsy photo, taken not even a few days ago.  

“Daisy \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*, thirty-six years old, cause of death…heroin overdose,” he muttered, unable to take his eyes off the photo.  So I’d been right; “Fay” wasn’t her legal surname.  “There was a ton of other shit that happened to her, but the coroner couldn’t figure out whether they happened pre- or post-mortem.”  I looked back at the photo, noticing strange tiny white lumps in the middle of the cut-open chest cavity.

“What are those?”  I couldn’t tell just from looking at them, or even what organ they appeared to be stuffed inside of.  Austin swallowed hard.  

“Over-the-counter ibuprofen.  We still don’t know how they got in there.”

“In where?”

“Don’t make me say it.  I’m never going to be able to unsee it.”  Andrew cleared his throat.

“I’m pretty sure, and don’t quote me on this, I wasn’t present for the autopsy, that that’s the victim’s uterus.”  I felt a wave of nausea squirm through my own abdomen upon hearing that.  “Whoever did this, they’re one sick bastard.  Creative, but sick.”  

“How do you mean?”  Now it was Andrew’s turn to fidget and look uncomfortable.  He stepped a bit closer to me and lowered his voice.

“When we found Miss \*\*\*\*\*\*\* in her home, she was um…listen, Livy, I’m not sure how PG I can be with this.”  I shook my head.

“Just tell me.  I’ve probably seen worse.”  He took a deep breath.

“We found her basically…*crucified.*  She was laid out on the floor with syringes through her wrists and ankles.”

“Jesus,” I muttered.  

“Pretty much,” Andrew answered.  I turned my attention back to Austin.  

“How do you know so much about the autopsy?”  Austin looked over at Andrew, tilting his head.  Andrew nodded.  Austin’s shoulders slumped.

“Because I took the fucking photo.”  

“*What?”*  

“Which means,” Andrew chimed in, folding his arms, “that somehow, someone broke into the police station and got the photo off the SD card.”

“Why the police station?” I asked.  

“I don’t take my work camera home with me,” Austin explained.  “Preservation of evidence is really important, so I put it in a locker at the end of the day.  Electronic locks, even, it should be impossible to break into.”  

“And there’s no way you could have left the locker open?”  I wanted to believe that my friends were better at their jobs than that, but journalists have to ask all the questions.  

“It locks automatically, so no,” Austin said, shuffling his feet a bit.  “It only opens if I scan my ID.  Or if the power goes out, but nobody is supposed to know that.”

“My brother is very particular about the handling of his camera,” Andrew said, patting Austin’s shoulder.  “Won’t even let anyone else touch it.”  Austin nudged his twin in the ribs with one bony elbow, grumbling something about people messing with the settings.  

The discovery of an official autopsy photo was what finally got the gallery shut down for a few weeks while the police investigated.  Of course, Victor and I had a visit from a couple of polite but very serious detectives who asked us a ton of questions about the gallery.

For a while, I thought that would be the end of it.  Now that he wasn’t constantly working on some new thing for the gallery every single week, I could finally manage to get Victor to take a break.  We went out for dinner more often, visited museums, went to a couple movies, and for at least a short period of time, we both went to bed at the same time each night.

But then one day, we were sitting on the couch, sharing a bowl of popcorn as we watched *Mrs. Doubtfire.*  It was one of my favorites, and he’d never seen it before.  Right before the scene where Mrs. Doubtfire absolutely beans the stepdad guy with a lime, Victor’s phone rang.  He picked it up with a deadpan expression, and I paused the movie.

“Hello?”  There was frantic speech I couldn’t make out on the other end.  “Curly, your Texas is showing, I understood exactly zero percent of what you just said.  Calm down.  No, don’t talk *louder,* talk *slower.*  Okay, I’m putting you on speakerphone, I’m with Livy right now.  Go take a drink of water, it will slow down your breathing.”  He put the phone on speaker, setting it on his knee.  “It’s Curly,” he said to me.  “He sounds upset.”

“Darn it, I *am* upset!” Curly’s disgruntled voice came through the phone.  I heard a gulp; he must have taken Victor’s advice about the water.  “Listen, V, it’s Alice.  She ain’t answered her phone for three days now, and she never does that.  Like, you know the settings on the phone where you can see if somebody read the text?  She hasn’t read her texts!  That ain’t normal, not for Alice.”  I raised an eyebrow at Victor.  

“Have you considered going to her apartment?” he asked, sounding less annoyed and more concerned by the second.  

“I’m there now, I’m outside the building.  I just talked to her landlady, and she says Alice ain’t left the apartment for quite a while.  No visitors either, just some old lady she thought was her grandma or somethin’.  I’ve got half a mind to call the cops, man, somethin’s wrong.  I can feel it.”  There was a long silence.

“All right, don’t panic.  We’ll come over, maybe she’s in a composing mood,” Victor said.  Curly gave him the address of Alice’s apartment building, and they said a brief goodbye before hanging up.  I set aside the popcorn as Victor went to grab his keys.  

“I’m coming with you,” I said.  If something was going on with Alice, I wanted to help.  I clearly didn’t know her as well as Curly did, but I still cared about her.  Victor nodded, and I slipped into my shoes before following him to the garage.  

“I suggest you call Sherri and Terri on the way.  It might be nice to have some law enforcement presence without swarming the place with police,” Victor said on the way.  I racked my brain for a moment before I realized he meant the twins.

“You know they have actual names, right?”  He shrugged.

“It’s funnier this way.  Besides, they’re the only pair of twins I’ve met who don’t have a weird sexual thing going on.”  I rolled my eyes and pulled out my phone.

The twins had already arrived by the time we got to Alice’s apartment building, and we found them talking to Curly, trying to calm him down.  I could hear faint cello music filtering down from an open window, which I assumed belonged to Alice.  It sounded…wrong, somehow.  Harsh and grating, not at all like her usual playing.  

“--dunno what the rules are for this kinda thing,” Curly said as we approached, “but is there any way y’all can just, y’know, go in there?  Do a welfare check or whatever it’s called.  I knocked on the door a little bit ago, but I don’t think she can hear me.”  

“Well, we talked to the landlady ourselves,” Andrew said, “and she told us that the cello music has been playing for at least forty-eight hours.  Non-stop.  That alone is enough cause for us to go in and check.”  He looked up at the building, tilting his head.  Austin mirrored the gesture almost subconsciously, something that had always freaked me out a bit.  

The music only got louder as we got near the apartment door.  Andrew knocked firmly on the door.

“Alice?  This is the police, can you come to the door?”  No break in the music, no indication that she had heard us outside.  Andrew tried a few more times, with no answer each time.  “Okay.  I think we’re going to have to break down the door.”

“Shouldn’t you call for backup?” I asked, but he shook his head.

“If she’s been playing continuously for an entire two days and then some, she hasn’t stopped to eat, drink, sleep, nothing.  She’s not gonna be in great shape, we need to get in there and figure out if we need to call an ambulance or not.”  He waved us off.  “Might want to stand back.”  The hallway wasn’t very wide to allow for a running start, but the door wasn’t very sturdy in the first place, and with a swift kick from both of the twins, we were in.

Immediately, we were hit with an intense, coppery smell, tinged with something acidic.  Curly barged in ahead of us, calling for Alice, and disappeared into a separate room for only a few moments before suddenly letting out a startled yell.  The twins rushed after him, and Victor and I followed at a slower pace to the living room at the back of the apartment.

“Holy shit,” said Andrew.

“Oh my God,” said Austin.

Victor said something in Ukrainian that was probably not repeatable in polite company.

I couldn’t say anything.  

Now we knew where the smell had been coming from.  

A cello lay broken on the red-stained floor, stripped of its strings and bridges.

And yet, Alice kept playing.
