Im currently in a remote location,far away from that godforsaken cave,its a miracle i made it out in one piece,or else i wouldnt been able to spread this story to more people.



Im a 23 year old,fresh out of college and needing money to atleast get an apartment.I found this job on a website,i forgot what its called,i tried to check for it but i couldnt find it.Either way,i find this high-paying job application at some industry,its called 'Wellerman Industries',and it works in caves.A normal folk would think it would be a minimum wage job for people who couldnt get a degree,but on the page it read that it payed 50 dollars an hour,which is alot compared to the other jobs here.



Naturally,i applied as soon as i could,there was a phone number on the page that i needed to call to apply,and of course i did.If i realized soon enough,i probably couldve avoided this nightmare of a job.Of course,i thought of it as sketchy at first,what mining job would get someone 50 dollars an hour?A normal job got you 16 dollars at best,50 was a dream come true.Nonetheless,i went on with the interview. It went good,great even,the interviewer was a decent guy,and he gave me a sheet of paper with the location of the job,startings hours and the day i would need to come.I of course asked if there was any danger,but he just replied with a ''Of course not,our company values safety first!Its upmost priority!'' He looked forced to say that,it didnt make me feel any better about this job,but oh well.



Nothing could go wrong,right?



I thought of the job,i felt something was wrong,the hourly pay seemed to good,i would be making more than a 100,000 dollars a year,it was a dream come true.I weighed the risks and the rewards,but i couldnt just chicken out,i needed the money,and finding an actually good paying job was like winning a lottery.



The place was an hour away,in the outskirts of a city,near a highway i dont know.Probably near the headquarters i thought. So,i drove there,arriving at a moderatly large building with the Wellerman logo on it.



I recognized it from the job application page.I parked my car and exited,the building on the exterior had a warehouse-like look,with black walls with dark grey posts on the corners of the building and sides,with the companies logo on one side of the building,and in the front,althought smaller. It looked like an Ikea or something,but modified.Yet i didnt pay much attention and went to the front,the room i entered wasnt that fancy,with bland and boring grey walls and sofas,with a empty information desk and posters with general rules of conduct.I sat on one of the sofas,until the doors opened and a guy came.He was my boss,and was waiting for me.He immidieatly instructed me to follow him,i did,we went trough several hallways with doors,most of them were office doors,until i arrived at a certain door,labeled 'Sector 2.',right at the end of the hallway.We both entered,and after a few more minutes of walking we reached a locker room,he gave me my locker and combination for it,the lockers number was '023'.I entered,and the guy closed the door shut as i was left to find the locker.After a few minutes of searching,i find my locker,i insert the locker code and it opens,revealing my uniform. It wasnt the fanciest,but it didnt matter at all. It was a normal dark grey shirt,with black cargo pants.There was also a tablet with a note one it,the note read the following:



*''This is your company designated tablet,it has multiple functions on it,yet the most usefull one is the map,you are not allowed to use this tabler for personal use,or you will be terminated.*''



I shrugged,thinking terminated meant firing.I ripped the note off and changed into the company uniform,i failed to notice the logo on the shoulders,the Wellerman logo,the logo was an encircled W,with the company name underneath. I then exit the room,and start up the tablet. It opens up,the Wellerman logo appearing for a few seconds,before the tablet boots up on a menu with several options,i press map.This place seemed large in the inside,yet i didnt think much of it.The map opens,showing sector-2,i look around,then suddenly get jumpscared by a man.For privacy purposes,il call him john.John worked in the offices,he had a different outfit than me,more formal and fancy.He knew the upper sectors,yet i was unlucky enough to work in the lower sectors,the caves.  
''So how ya doin kid?'' John was older than me,looked around 41 years old,so for him i was practically a kid.  
''U-uh good.'' I stuttered for some reason,i didnt know why.  
''You work in the lower levels,right?Based on your uniform and tablet.'' he responded light-heartedly.  
''Yeah...'' i responded more silently.  
John looks at his wrist watch  
''Hmm...do you want me to show you the elevator to the lower levels,your shift should start in a few minutes.'' He asks nonchalantly.



I was kinda weirded out,how did this guy know when my shift starts,i shrugged that thought off,he probably knows other workers in the lower levels,and probably knows shifts from other miners.I reluctantly agree,he then shows me around,he was quite chill and a likeable guy,after a minute of walking i arrive at an elevator,he stops and gestures for me to enter.



Which i do,he waves me goodbye and i press a button on the elevator with a downwards arrow.The elevator itself was an industrial one,it was a large platform held by wires with a small control panel in the middle,with 2 arrows. It didnt have any numbered buttons like a normal one,and the floor was steel grated,with metal fences acting as walls,at each corner of the elevator there was a steel post,the connected the lower half of the elevator with the roof of it,having the entire mechanism of it.The elevator comes to a creaking stop at the first floor,by now the walls were rocky and cave like,an indication i was in the cave systems now.The label 'Sector -2' at the entrance of the floor.I exit the elevator and enter the floor,i enter a room with my boss and 2 new colleagues. As placeholders,il name them both Max and Bob.I enter the room,nervous.Each one of them had their tablets by them,the walls of the room were light grey,with benches and a table in the middle of the room.There was a vending machine at one-side of the room,with various sodas and energy bars.I sat on one of the benches as i waited.The boss cleared his throat,before pulling down one of these large presentation billboards which was on the wall,he fumbled with a tablet and the billboard switched images to a large map of the cave system,the one we were working in.He then started to talk,first explaining the rules.



''Boys,today we present our new recruit,(my name here).As standard procedure,we will teach you about the rules of this place,this isnt childs pay.There will be no second chances,if you dont listen the first time then its on you.Either way,here are the rules:



1: Carrying your tablet around is mandatory,dont lose it,you wont get another one.  
2: Avoid going into blocked off areas,for gods sake they are blocked off for a reason!  
3: Do not go to deep into the caves,stick togheter and stick well.  
4: If you see a flag with jaw on it,turn the other way IMMIDIEATLY!we are not responsible if your idiocy gets you in danger!  
5: And the last rule,if you find anything foreign in the caves,mark it on the map and the cleanup crew will take care of it!'' Althought the rest of the rules were normal and generic,the fourth one was...eerie to say the least.What does the flag with the jaw mean?If there are bears in these caves then it would be shut down,but we are deep underground,deep.Atleast 50 meters underground,as the elevator took a few minutes to arrive to this level.I was snapped out of my thoughts when my boss continued



''Now,for todays mission,we will go through usual routine,we use our RC's to find crystals,we track the locations we find and mine it out,at the end of the routine we set up cameras and we head back up.''



'RC's?' i thought to myself,dam this company is advanced,they had custom made RC's to find crystals,and what are these crystals?I shrugged to myself,probably an ore. My other 2 partners were talking to each other.I joined in sence i had nothing better to do.



''Hey,what are the crystals the boss was talking about?'' I asked max.Both of them looked the same age as me,probably found the job and thought they won a jackpot becouse the price was so high.  
''They are some shiny pur-'' Max gets interrupted by Bob  
''Yeah,and theres a rare variant,called the red crystal,some say it was made from the blood of lost miners!'' Max looked visibly irritated that Bob interrupted him  
''Wait,are those real?'' I asked,genuinly thinking that bob was right.  
''No..their just a conspiracy around the company,there was once spotted a blood red crystal and people thought it was creepy.its an inside joke.'' Max said,annoyed.Its clear he has heard of this 'red crystal' thousands of times now.  
''You know their real!We saw one!'' Bob protests,yet to no avail as max shuts him own  
''No,they dont.Its a myth,it was just dark and the bad lighting made it seem red.''  
''Well good to know i guess.'' I say jokingly,then the boss interrupts  
''Lets get to work boys!''



The shift goes as normal,we set up some RC cars with trackers on them and cameras with an added flashlight,they looked like normal cars,yet with all of these features built into them. Althought this is a proffesional job,i joke around.Crashing my car into the others and acting like a kid.The boss scolds me for it,so i stop.We controlled the cars with the tablet,i occasionaly checked the map to see how close i was to my target.We find some of the crystals,and we go our way,After an hour of going trough the cave,we arrive at the location.We had some high-quality equipment,like drills,and if we want to go the old fashioned way we can use pickaxes.The boss supervised us,he didnt care aslong as we got the crystals drilled.Sence the caves were narrow and small,so no vehicles could go through,we had to manually carry the crystals back to the base camp,which was near the room i mentioned.There were several chests,which we loaded with these crystals.Once our shift is ready and quota is met,we load the chests onto the elevator and send it up,we arent told what the crystals are ment for and where they go,we just mine them and bring them to base. Me and my little group,me Bob and Max,occasionaly talk with each other and grow a friendship group,i grew to like them.For the following weeks,we continue our shifts as normal,if we are lucky enough we get a low quota.



Yet on one day,we arrived at the building. Me Bob and Max didnt live far apart,so we started to go often to eachothers house,and sometimes travel togheter.We go trough the halls of the building,expecting to be greeted by someone at the information desk or in the hallways: Nothing.We arrived at sector 2,at that old elevator,we entered it and went down for a few minutes,the elevator stopping as we arrive at Sector -2,i knew that becouse of the rusty label at the entrance of the cave.We entered the room with the benches and tables,nothing.Just a note that said something about boss not being able to come,signed by the higher ups.  
''Hey,doesent this seem eerie?'' Max breaks the silence.  
''Yeah dude,the boss never missed a day,and was never late.'' I responded  
''I know...should we leave or continue?'' Max adds  
''No,if we want to get payment we need to complete quota!'' Bob shuts him down,he was the braver off the 2.Reasonable for him.



Reluctantly,we agree.Then for the first time ever,we get a notification on our tablets.With a number only named 'Higher ups.' The message included instructions for our mission,everything was normal,the setting up the RC's,drilling the crystals and bring them to camp ETC.But on the last instruction,it said to find the red crystals at all costs,and follow the trail.We all thought it was a joke,but Bob was excited,thinking this confirmed his theory of the red crystals existing.



''Hey man...isnt this kinda weird?'' I say,breaking the silence. Me Bob and Max were walking to find the crystals manually,sence after an unfortunate incident the RC cars exploded.  
''Yeah...like why should we follow the red crystals?Are they even real?''  
''I dont know...but its the higher ups,we cant refuse orders.'' We continue to trek trough the  caves,after what seems like hours we find a batch of crystals.We put a tracker and start to mine them and transport them back to camp,on the way back i spot something: A blocked off cavern,with a blood red crystal on the other side of the wooden boards.I stop,and nudge bob and max to stop.  
''Dude...is tha-'' i get interrupted by bob  
''NO WAY ITS REAL!'' Bob says,overjoyed,he immidieatly searches trough his pockets,and shoves the tracker onto the wooden boards  
''WERE DEFINETLY CHECKING THIS LATER!''



Bob yells,it echoes through the cave.Admittedly i was frightened by him,i never saw someone so in joy,but good for him i guess.After transporting all the crystals to base camp and loading them onto the elevator,bob sprints with the company tablet with his head,me and max nod,following behind at a similar pace.After a hour or so,we arrive at the blocked off tunnels,bob got a hammer from base,and started to break down the wooden boards. It was eerie,a cold breeze flowing from the cave.We get a notification from all of our tablets: new orders. We are ordered by the higher ups to enter,track and retrieve the bodies. Plus some sort of artifact. Me and max were terrified.



''What the hell?'' i say silently as i read the message  
''Dude...why do we need to retrieve bodies?Isnt that the cleanup or hazmat peoples jobs?'' Max says with a terrified voice.



Bob is frozen from shock,we contemplated to run from there. It was creeping all of us out,but i had an urge to enter the cave and carry out the orders,it was getting increasinly stronger,i could tell from bob and max's looks they felt the same,we were preassured into entering by our own bodies...It was colder in there.We followed the red crystals,going trough the caves with our flashlights...then bob screamed.I immidieatly scrambled for my flashlight,pointing it forward i saw something straight from the deepest pit of heck...the caves walls were made of flesh.Pulsating and beating grotesquely,as i look around i see a flag: a flag with the jaw symbol on it.I was getting freaked out...bob and max too,yet we couldnt back out.I dont know why,i couldnt turn around and run away,i looked into the cave...pipes of meat covered and dangled from the fleshy ceiling,acting like veins for whatever this creature was....i dont even know what this is,yet we walked in. My body contradicting itself,changing from turning around and running away,from continuing forward.We were all terrified,but we treked on.We stepped on the flesh,grotesque squishy sounds as we stepped on the flesh beneath us filled the air.



We started to find bodies...or bits of them.With each body we find,the more we want to run out of there...but we had too.We couldnt run away,we were forced to keep going.Out of the blue,we heard a yell as we saw a bone shoot out of the wall into Bobs chest,we scurried to grab him,i take of my shirt to try and stop the bleeding,while max is trying to shove bob out the bone.Yet we cant,the bone is in a hook like shape,it retract into the ceiling,with bob in it,his final words are ''RUN!'' as he gets absorbed into the flesh...me and max run,max trips on something...the body of our boss.more tears started to run down our faces as we realize our boss and one of our friends is gone...we are force to run,and run,and run.We find some sort of bone,it was in a blood red color,with a sharp end.This was the artifact,we then started to run,hearing sounds of squishy flesh as eyes start to grow out of the walls,looking at us,we run and run and run...we arrive at the exit,me and max cheer as we finally escape this hell-hole!



*Stab.*



I turn around,to see flesh piercing max's chest.He drops the artifact,he looks at me,blood dripping from his mouth down his chin.''...Go on without me.'' He says,im to shocked to do anything before he gets pulled into the darkness.



I stare at the cave...a tear or two going down my cheek as i grab the artifact,I walk down the cave,following the red crystals to exit this hellhole.I manage to push trough and arrive at the elevator.I go up and see john,talking with someone before saying something like



''Hey!'' The guy he was talking to leaves,and i sit down.Explaining what happened.His face darkens almost immidieatly as i finish.  
''Look,do not tell anyone that.They have eyes everywhere,im sorry for your losses,truly.But if you want to survive dont tell anyone unless you go full anonymous,place that bone thingy at the information desk and leave as soon as possible,if you want to quit its up to you.''I do as he says,placing the 'artifact' on the information desk,and leaving right then and there.I sold my apartment and went on in the woods,somewhere far away from that goddamned company and its caves,i plan to post these notes as soon as i can,in the meantime il buy a new house,far away, and escape this hellhole.
