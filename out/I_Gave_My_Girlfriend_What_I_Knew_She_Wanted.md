Hey reddit I’ve found myself in a bit of an unusual situation.  It might sound pretty weird, but please hear me out and really consider what I’m saying. 

 

Basically, it all started when my girlfriend came over the other night.  We’ve been dating for a while, but she doesn’t get the chance to come over that often.  I should also mention here that my girlfriend can be a bit… weak willed.  She’s not always great at asking for the things she wants, so it’s up to me to figure it out. 

 

Anyway, It was pretty rainy that night, and she’d walked to my place, so we ended up cuddling near the fire.  It was so perfect.  She was warm and soft, and her whole body just seemed to radiate love and affection.  She told me that she loved me, and her eyes were so tender and sincere.  In that moment I just felt something click.  She was mine, she loved me, worshipped me, and right in that second, she was utterly perfect.  I knew that we were united in one goal, making sure we stayed together forever.  I just needed to give her what she wanted. 

 

My girlfriend has always had gorgeous golden blonde hair, long and healthy.  It was perfect.  So, I wrapped it around my finger, and then wrapped it around her neck.  To be clear, I’m absolutely certain that she didn’t feel any pain.  She was calm and peaceful, she didn’t struggle very much, and I feel like I definitely would have noticed if this wasn’t what she wanted. 

 

When I was done I opened her eyes again and she looked so much more peaceful than before.  No more stress, nothing more to worry about.  She was more beautiful than ever, her face was even a nice rosy red color, like she was blushing.  I spent the rest of the night with her head on my shoulder basking in warm feelings.  She was mine, and now she always would be.  Not to mention I’d made sure that she wouldn’t have to worry about anything else ever again. 

 

Nobody bothered us the whole night, and I felt really great.  But the next morning she was really cold, and I started to get a bit worried.  I’m confident that she didn’t feel pain, and I only did it because I knew it was what she really wanted, but did I go too far?  I feel like if it had really been that bad, I would have gotten some kind of a sign.  I don’t know, I feel like I made the right call, but what do you think?

 

 

Edit:  I feel like you guys aren’t really understanding my point of view.  I know it was a little out there, but I was trying to figure out what to do to fulfill her wish and this is just what came to me.  I knew that she was mine, and I knew that she wanted it to stay that way. 

 

I hear all of you all saying that she didn’t actually ask for me to do that, but you don’t understand her like I do.  Our relationship has been a struggle.  She’s from a pretty rich family and I’m not, and she’s had trouble pulling away from that fancy lifestyle to be with me.  I told you in my OG post that she was a little weak willed.  I knew that she loved me, and I took the steps I needed to in order to make sure we could stay together.  It’s a man’s job to take care of their woman.  And in a relationship the only thing I really look for is someone who makes me happy and wants to stay with me.  So we both did our part!  Besides, we can’t really ask her anymore, so I feel like I’m going to trust my deep understanding of her and our relationship over people who never even met her. 

 

You all seem to think that I’ve done some kind of awful sin, but I’m a religious man, and I feel that God would have found a way to let me know I was in the wrong if that was the case.  Women belong to their men, and I did my job of taking care of her wishes, so no real harm done! I just feel blissfully happy.  Porphyria is staying with me, and no one has come and bothered us since that night.  I feel like I did the right thing, and I hope you all understand a little bit more now that I’ve explained.  I guess I could still be wrong, but it’s been a couple of days and I’ve had no real problems.  Well, my girlfriend needs a lot more blankets to stay warm now, but that’s not a big deal to me.  If you want to reply, make sure you read through my whole post again and actually take in and consider all of my points.  I know it’s unusual, but it’s working out so far!
