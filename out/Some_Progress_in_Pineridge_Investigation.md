Hey—Sam again. A quick update. This one’s less breathless and more… tired, I guess. A few days have passed since my last post, and I wanted to put down what I’ve done and what’s happened.

First: I went upstream. I had to check the source of our water, just in case.

I hiked the whole damn way up the mountain that feeds our reservoir. Walked the access roads, checked the runoff points, the little inlets, everything you’d expect to find if something was being dumped in or leaching into the source. Nothing.

The water at the intake looked normal to the eye — sure, a little cloudier in places like after a storm, but nothing you’d point to and say “that’s where eggs are coming from.” If anything, what I saw made me more worried, not less: if it isn’t obvious upstream, then the contamination is getting into the system somewhere after the intake or it’s being produced inside the system itself.

Part of me hoped it was coming from upstream, and the plant treatment was just faulty or something.

After that, I started calling people. I called local authorities, I called the plant (from the outside—no way back on the floor), and I asked about sending samples out. That’s when things got complicated.

Doc Marlowe, before he left, apparently contacted a national disease agency. He wanted outside confirmation. According to what I’ve been told by someone who would talk to me, that agency involved federal investigators to coordinate testing.

I don’t have copies of their paperwork — Marlowe sent the remaining samples I'd given him along before he left, but the Board has been making it difficult for anyone to get anything out of the plant. They’re burying paperwork, dragging their feet on chain-of-custody stuff, and generally obstructing attempts to escalate. That’s why, in part, they haven’t been breathing down my neck the way they were — they’ve got bigger people to fight, and I think they’re using the delay to make the problem look less immediate.

Here’s the thing: the investigators are here in some capacity. But I’m getting the sense they’re treating this like a low-priority, oddball case. No one has come down from anywhere. My contact at the federal level — I’m not naming them like I mistakenly did before with Marlowe— said there are "other avenues they have to investigate first". I don’t know what those are. Maybe there are other reports. Maybe someone downstream with louder complaints. Maybe it’s paperwork and bureaucracy and a hundred meetings where nothing gets decided. And ultimately nothing happens.

I told them everything I knew. I told them about the weird stuff in the plant tests, the symptoms people are having, the way boiling didn’t break down the structures Marlowe saw. I gave them the lab notes (I have my own copy saved). I wasn’t going to make the same mistake twice and post the agent’s name online. I’m not interested in getting anyone else targeted or in burning bridges I might need.

But the Board hasn’t exactly been cooperative. They’ve stalled sample releases, questioned chain of custody, and insisted that any outside testing must be formally requested through their channels — which slows everything to a crawl. It reads to me like classic delay tactics: make the process slow and technical until the public loses interest or the story dies down. Meanwhile the water is still moving through pipes in people’s houses.

And there are other things that don’t sit right with me. There were always parts of the plant none of us floor staff had access to — doors that only upper management could badge into, but nobody really knew what was inside. We’d joke about it sometimes, chalk it up to record storage or some archive, but… thinking back now, I don’t know. And lately, I’ve noticed some of the Board members themselves coming down to the plant. That’s unusual. Normally, if you see one of them at all, it’s one at a time, briefly, and usually through a subordinate. I’ve seen two, even three together, walking through like they had business there. For people who normally sit in offices miles away, that feels… odd.

So I’m doing what I can while they shuffle paperwork. I’m snooping. I’m checking distribution lines in the places people have suggested — reservoirs in the distribution network, holding tanks, junction points, anything that could be an entry point after treatment. My plant access card is still suspended, so this is all I can do from the outside: walking access roads, asking the right nosy old-timers about maintenance schedules, watching trucks, looking for unusual activity. It’s petty detective work, but it’s all I have for now.

If it’s bypassing the plant and entering after treatment, that’s one thing to look for. If it’s being introduced at the plant because something upstream has changed (equipment failing, new contractors, contaminated supply), that’s another. And if — God help me — it’s being produced in the system, then I don’t even want to think about what that means for Pineridge.

I don’t have answers yet. The investigators aren’t moving fast enough for me. The Board is obfuscating and delaying. People are still getting sick, and the town looks at me like I’m shouting at clouds. I know how that looks. But I know what I saw in Marlowe’s notes, and I know boiling didn’t work. I don't know what does.

I’ll keep poking. I’ll follow any lead the federal people ignore. If you’ve got local knowledge — maintenance roads, old valves, private reservoirs, recent construction on the pipeline — tell me. Drop me a message. Be careful with what you post publicly. Don’t mention the people I might be talking to. If the Board is trying to slow everything down and spares a glance at my posts, I don’t want to give them a detailed map of my activity until it's already happened.

I’ll check in again when I have anything concrete. For now: keep avoiding the water. Find another source. If you can, spread the word without making it obvious to the people who are watching. I don't want anyone else being branded as crazy on my behalf, just knowing these posts are being read is some modicum of comfort.
