 

First of all , i am not sure if my friend views this sub reddit but i will try to be as vague as possible about the details of the story just in case.

This happened a few days ago. I was sitting with a different friend in class , lets call her x. We both knew that my other friend , y , was depressed and slightly suicidal. Me , who was also suicidal at the time tried my best to help her. Y seemed extremely upset that day. Me and x tried to ask her what happened but she refused to answer , so we left it.

A few minutes later she asks x if she had a pencil sharpener she didnt use. x and i immediately saw where this was going and told her to forget about it. She then stole the sharpener from x and tried to take out the blade. When she failed to do that she went around asking other people to trade sharpeners with her. Someone did so y then convinced 2 people to help take out the blade. The 2 innocent students had no idea what she was going to use it for. Around this time a teacher had told x to go to the staff room to get something. Y sat down hiding the blade in a paper ball. I still saw it and immediately tried to take it from her. She refused to give it to me. For some reason my dumbass thought it would be a good idea to go to the students who unscrewed the sharpener. I told them to help me. they honestly though that i was joking for a good 5 minutes or so. I think they only understood the danger of the situation was because i was almost in tears. The next few seconds were some of the worst in my life.

the teacher hears whats going on and askes y about it. y refuses to answer so she turns to me and asks me "What happened?" At this point i look at Y with a very apologetic look and while trying to hold back my tears i tell the teacher. The teacher took Y outside the room for questioning . They return a bit later and y threw away the blade. Or so i thought. Turns out she hid it in her pocket while pretending to throw it away. She did actually end up cutting herself in class.

That was probably the worst part for me. I did everything i could to stop her from cutting herself but in the end she still did. I cried for hours after reaching home. I have tried everything to make her feel better.I still worry about her every single day.

I honestly feel so grateful that it was that teacher who was there in the class that found out. If it was any other teacher i really dont know what would have happened to her. Most of the teachers in our school really coudnt care less if students were happy or not. Whenever they would hear about a depressed student the reaction would always be "depression isnt real. Its just a trend made up by teenagers to feel special". So no wonder she felt afraid when the teacher took her out of the class. To this day i get shivers in my spine thinking about what happened that day.
