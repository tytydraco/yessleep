You may think I’m mad, right? My mum, my dad, even my sister thinks I need to see a psychiatrist but I see her as clear as day. Her smooth grey locks of hair up in a perm as she always had it. Not too short but just enough to style neatly on her fragile head. These piercing blue eyes that could see right into your soul. She was a lovely woman. Funny, caring, an amazing grandmother. Everyone loved her. She was the most loving woman you could ever meet and would always call you just to ask ‘how are you? How’s your day? How is everyone?’ No one had a bad word to say about her.

And she had the most beautiful send of. Loads of flowers, limousines, even 2 white doves to represent the love between her and my grandad. To show that their love was eternal and she would be waiting on the other side for him. 

There was something odd about it though. As her coffin was brought into the church, I felt a cold sinister gush of cool air blow gently across me; through me even. But that’s not even the strangest part. It was the warmest day of the year yet at that moment, I felt like I needed to put my Woolly coat back on. It wasn’t like the breeze you would long for on a hot day. Almost as if someone had crept out of their grave and walked right through me

 Sometimes I think she wasn’t even dead when they lifted her coffin down into the ground on the 17th of may 2019. I could hear her silent screams as she was buried. And it sounded almost as if she was banging on the coffin to let her out. No one else seemed to be bothered by all the commotion but I know what I heard. 

It wasn’t so long after she’d passed until I started seeing her again. It was oddly comforting. But scary for everyone around me. How was I the only one who could see her, you might be asking? I’m not crazy. I’d blink my eyes and she’d be standing there in the corner of the room by my closet and would say ‘night night my darling, I’m right here.

When it first happened, it was quite a shock but then I got used to it and I had Nan back. 

Years have gone by, months of talking to different psychiatrists because apparently I’m not well but Nan looks after me. 

I remember I got my first day job a couple months after. My manager really had it out for me. He’d insult my work and criticise everything I did. Always had a word to say about everything. Not long after I left, I saw it in the papers he’d passed away. Died of a heart attack apparently. But I knew otherwise. Nan told me all about it. She stole the air from his lungs until he could no longer breath. Then whispered in my ear “Nan sorted it”
