I can’t even write this girl’s history up right now. I literally can't.

I don’t know how my boss thought it would be a good idea for me to talk to her, or why he’d think anything she said would make me feel better about anything or anyone.

The rest of her file will come later. Or maybe it won’t. I don't know.

And right now I don’t care.

**Interview Subject: The Cleanup Crew**

**Classification String:  Cooperative / Destructible / Khthonic / Constant / Moderate / Apeili**

**Interviewer: Rachele B.**

**Date: 11/25/2024**

On the day I died, I was 5’5” and I weighed 80 pounds.

That was the worst thing ever because just a week prior, I had only weighed 79 pounds.

*It can’t be*, I assured myself, ignoring the panic gnawing the boundary of my consciousness. *It’s wrong. It isn’t possible. You logged every gram of food, like you’re supposed to. You accounted for every fraction of a calorie, like you’re supposed to. You did everything, like you’re supposed to. You were in control. You are in control.*

I stepped off the scale, then stepped back on.

This time, the number was even worse: 80.2.

A panic attack roared in. I was a failure. A weak, idiotic, disgusting failure with no self control. I stared at myself in the mirror, loathing every line and contour of my body and despising everything inside it until I burst into tears. I cried so hard it made me dizzy. Too dizzy to stand. Too dizzy to even sit. I lay down as sobs wracked my body, curling up on the bath mat as darkness shredded the edges of my vision. My chest felt so heavy, like someone had stacked a hundred bricks and plopped down on top of it. Nausea roiled in, slick and all-consuming.

I blacked out, then juddered back into consciousness on the living room floor, screaming as a paramedic slammed my sternum down again and again, crushing my heart, my lungs, my spine. The pain was so overwhelming I couldn’t move, couldn’t see, couldn’t even think. I could only feel pain exquisite in its profoundness, and a mindless, primal panic because I just knew that each compression was cracking my bones and rupturing my organs. 

I tried to shove him off, but I was too weak to even twitch. Pressure in my chest surged, flattening my lungs, and pain swallowed me again.

I woke up in a hospital.   

I remember the words my doctor used. *Anemia. Critically low blood pressure. Bone loss. Kidney damage. Heart failure.* 

The heart failure was why I’d gained weight— all the fluid built up because my own heart was too weak, too damaged, to cycle its own blood. 

“Can you cure it?” I asked.

“No. It’s treatable but irreversible.” He looked at me sadly. “I told you, Courtney. If you don’t eat, you’ll die. And you died.”

By the time they drained all the excess fluid, I weighed 72 pounds.

When I was finally discharged a month later, I weighed 89 pounds and had racked up a ninety-thousand dollar bill.

In my defense, I didn’t expect things to end that way.

Then again, there are a lot of things you don’t expect about eating disorders.

For one thing, you don’t expect the exhaustion. How your mind slows down, how even a full year into recovery you still trail off mid-conversation because your brain can’t pounce on the right words.

 

No one tells you how every waking moment (and most of your sleeping moments too) are consumed. How the only thing that makes you feel pride, the only thing that makes you feel hopeful, the only thing that makes you feel good, is meeting your restriction goals. 

No one tells you how good it feels when people lavish you with compliments, or how confusing and devastating it is when those compliments dry up. No one tells you that most people eventually stop talking to you. You definitely don’t believe the desperate friends who tell you that you’re not fat, you’re dying, and you only think you’re fat because your brain is so fucked it can’t see reality anymore.   

You don’t expect the stench, either. The ketone miasma smells like a cocktail of nail polish remover and blood, with a tantalizing note of cat piss.

You don’t expect what happens your teeth, how you’re lucky if it’s only your back molars that crumble. 

You don’t expect the scarring that impedes your ability to swallow solid food. No one tells you that your stomach might never stop hurting, even after you get better. No one tells you that you'll sometimes get panic attacks when you take your acid reducer because the berry-flavored coating is sweet.

No one tells you how an eating disorder will turn you into an addict with everything addiction entails — the lying, the manipulation, the obsession, the ugliness, the destruction - only instead of alcohol or opioids or meth or fentanyl, deprivation is your drug. And no one tell you how people around you are okay with it up until the very end, because for some reason we all think self-deprivation is a virtue. I still think that sometimes.

No one tells you about heart failure. What it’s like to feel crushing pressure on your chest, to have lungs so impeded by fluid that they can’t expand enough to draw half a breath, or what it’s like when your heart stops, or how it feels to have a frantic EMT crush your sternum and crack your ribs to restart your dead heart.

And no one tells you about the time you lose.

I was sick for four years. Years that somehow feel like a fever dream and realer than real at the same time.  Years that mired me in place while everyone and everything I cared about left me behind.

But all of these things I didn’t expect happened in the middle of this story. The middle is the least important part. Now I’m going to tell you the beginning.

My big sister Carissa was the best person in the world.

She adopted two ancient mutts and sang lullabies to them every night. She made friends with the crows who lived in the courtyard behind our apartment and taught them to say my name. She donated money to food banks and animal shelters, and cried at TV commercials, and volunteered at Big Brothers Big Sisters until they found out what she did for a living. Even after they banned her, the girls she worked with came to her on their own. When our mom kicked me out, she drove over before I’d even made it down the street and took me to live with her. Didn’t charge me a dime. Didn’t even ask me to buy groceries or pay the water bill. 

I was jealous of her. Desperately jealous. I hated myself for it. I still do. I was a short, fat little wallflower who couldn’t get a second glance from anyone. No one talks about that, either. They talk about unrequited crushes, and the beauty industrial complex, and how pretty women get better jobs and make more money. But they don’t ever talk about how it feels. They don’t talk about that wild, sinking pit that comes with the realization that no one sees you. The despair when you understand you might as well not exist. 

Carissa had none of those problems. And I was glad. I didn’t want anyone to feel like me, least of all her. 

But I was still jealous.

One night after dinner, I realized I was way too full. And I didn’t like the way that felt. I looked across the table and saw my sister, looking beautiful. So beautiful that I felt jealous. I didn’t like the way that felt, either.

That was the night it started. From there, I launched headlong into my diet.

Carissa was my biggest supporter. She supported me in everything I did. Why would a diet be any different? She was my foundation. My accountability partner. My guiding light. That was what Carissa was at her core: Light. She didn’t brighten every room she walked into. She was too wild for that. So bright and so wild that whenever she walked into a room she burned it down. 

Men loved that about her, at least at first. Nick did for sure. 

Nick owned her club. He wasn’t her boss — too high up for that — but he had the final say in everything, especially the girls. 

That brings me to the last, least important thing about my sister:

She was a stripper.

I know that’s a shitty word. I know there are better descriptors. Exotic dancer, or just dancer. But Carissa chose and claimed the title of Stripper (specifically, the Best Damn Stripper in the Armpit of California) for herself, so that is what I’ll call her.

To me, Nick started off as some distant, vaguely threatening background character in Carissa’s rants about work. But it didn’t take long for that to change. For Nick to notice how bright she shone. How everything burned in her wake. 

I knew they were dating before she told me. What I didn’t know was that dating Nick came with expectations. Bad expectations. Expectations that terrified her.  So she broke it off.

He killed her for it, and he got away with it.

I was at work the night it happened. She called me at the end of my shift, screaming. *Don’t come home. Courtney! Whatever you do, do not come home!* And then I heard a crash in the background, and her dogs barking, and voices. And laughter.

And then she ended the call.

I didn’t listen. I went home immediately.

By the time I turned onto our street, firetrucks were there and the parking lot was barricaded. Our apartment window faced the road. It was wide open, and full of fire. An upside down waterfall of flame rippling up into the night.

She managed, somehow, to get her dogs out of the apartment. Our neighbor found them on the landing, howling and wailing at the door. I kept those dogs until they died. I sang them lullabies every night, just like she did. 

The sheriff ruled it a suicide. Everyone knew it was bullshit, but they argued that she had obviously planned it because she did it while I was at work and also got her dogs out of the way.

Naturally, the fact that the sheriff was Nick’s uncle never even came up. 

In the aftermath of my sister’s death, I hatched a million revenge plots against that slimy motherfucker, each less viable than the last. The fact that Nick was still here ate me alive. I literally dreamed of killing him. Stabbing, running him over with the car, drowning him, immolating him, shooting him, crushing him. Sometimes I even dreamed of eating him. Roasting him over the very same fire that killed her and tearing into his body as the hot grease dripped down my chin.

But I wasn’t eating him. If anything, he was eating *me*.

And there was nothing I could do about it.

 After that, my life spun out of control.

Nowhere to live, nowhere to go, and my best friend — my provider, my advocate, my champion, my protector, my sister — had been stolen from me. No light was left. Only darkness. Living, starving, ravenous darkness. 

I think that’s when my crash diet transformed into an eating disorder:

When it became the only thing in my life that I could control.

I didn’t listen to the people who told me to stop. I didn’t listen to my doctor no matter how many times he said, *If you don’t eat you’re going to die*. In fact, when he said that, the only thing I thought was, *Dying doesn’t sound that bad*.

And then my heart stopped, and I did die, and it actually *was* that bad.

When I woke up and the first thing that doctor said, *I told you if you didn’t eat, you would die,* I said:

“I wish I’d stayed dead.” 

They put me in inpatient treatment. They forced me to eat but no matter how much they fed me, I barely gained weight. Eleven pounds in three months. It was insanity. I was hungry all the time but repulsed by food. My body rejected every bite I took, like food itself was poison.

The doctors told me it was psychological and kept making me eat.

I hated food but I was so hungry all the time. So hungry that I cried. Whenever I ate, I cried more. They evaluated me for autoimmune disorders, metabolic diseases, cancer, allergies, celiac disease, Crohn’s disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and a hundred other things I can’t remember.

Everything came back negative. The hospital finally threw their hands up and discharged me.

I kept trying to eat, of course. I was so hungry  I tried until I cried every single day.

That became my life: Crying every day because I was so hungry, and dreaming of killing my sister’s dx-boyfriend every night.

I finally gave up and decided to kill myself. I put on Carissa’s favorite jacket, loaded her favorite album on my phone, put a bottle of painkillers in my pocket, and set off for her favorite bench overlooking the bluffs. I even ordered her favorite sandwich — those chicken bacon ranch things from Quizno's. We used to eat fifteen of them between us. I hadn’t eaten one since she died. The smell made my mouth water. 

I sat down, unwrapped the sandwich, and took a bite.

Immediately I retched.

That was the last straw. I threw the sandwich down the bluffs, sending up a prayer for some stray dog to find it, and took out the pill bottle.

“Don’t do that.”

I jumped, spilling the pills all over the concrete. 

A man stood a few yards up the trail, watching me with glittering eyes.

I had no idea how long he’d been there. I had no idea how I'd missed him. He was huge, taller than almost anyone I’d ever met.

And there was something else.

A long time ago, a dog jumped a fence and chased me. It caught me by the leg and dragged me backward, destroying my ankle in the process. I couldn’t walk for a month. I still have the scars, even now. 

This man made me feel like I was back on that sidewalk, screaming and running for my life as a big angry dog ran me down.

I did not question the instinct. I shot up, heedless as everything spilled from my lap, and ran.

I didn’t make it far.

That’s something else no one tells you about eating disorders: How very weak you get, and how very much some people love that you’re weak.

I was gasping for breath inside thirty seconds, light headed and dizzy within a minute. By the time I lost my balance and fell, dark spots were swirling through my vision and my heart felt like it was going to explode. Just like it had right before I went into cardiac arrest.

The man came up beside me as I lay there, wheezing. I saw his shoes. Fancy shoes so heavily polished I saw my own face reflected in them. I looked worse than a corpse.

I tried to crawl away, but he grabbed me by my sister’s coat and sat me up. Then he sat down across from me, right there in the middle of the sidewalk.

“We need to talk,” he said, in an accent so thick I couldn’t immediately decipher his words. “But first, you need to eat.”

He held out a styrofoam takeout carton.

Despite everything, the smell of whatever was inside made my mouth water. I wanted to take it.

Instead I spluttered, “Excuse me, sir, what the *hell*?”

“*You* are in Hell right now.”

I was sure that was his cue to drag me off and torture me to death. I even steeled myself. But then he kept talking.

"Everything smells good, but every bite you swallow comes back up again. You think of food all the time. You can’t sleep because you’re hungry, but you still can’t eat. This sounds familiar?”

“I…yeah.” *And in more than one way*, I thought.

He leaned forward and placed the carton in my lap. “This will solve the problem.”

I couldn’t think of any words to say or any actions to take or even any thoughts to think.

“I know, I know. Little girls aren’t supposed to take candy from strangers. But this is not candy, and we aren't going to be strangers for long.”

“How do you know that?” Painfully aware that my hands were shaking, I opened the carton. The smell hit me with almost physical force. Saliva flooded my mouth.

“I'm Mr. Wolf. See? Not a stranger. Eat before you faint. If you faint, I will have to take you home tonight.”

My insides froze.

“I will still have to take you home eventually. But if you eat, we can solve your other problem first.”

The smell wafting up from the carton was heavenly. I was practically drooling. I desperately wanted to eat, which was confusing because I was even more scared than I’d been thirty seconds ago. “What the fuck, dude?”

“I will tell you what the fuck while you eat. Is that fair?”

It was as fair a proposition as I could expect under the circumstances, so I took a bite. I was a little let down — it didn’t taste nearly as good as it smelled. But at least I was able to swallow it without urking it right back up again.

“Something is eating you. I smell it. It’s devouring you from the inside out.”

Unbidden, Nick’s face floated to the front of my mind, loathsome and loathed. “Not some*thing.*” 

Mr. Wolf smiled, wide as the Cheshire Cat. I saw then why his voice was so thick, words flowing together in ways that had nothing to do with his accent:

He had no teeth.

“I know it is someone, and not something. That is why I want to help you.”

I frowned as a million snippets of urban legends and morality plays and folktales and fairy tales and Bible stories flit through my mind in the space of a second. “Are you actually real?”

“Unfortunately.”

“Are you like…the devil?”

“I would be much more fun if I was the devil.”

“Then who are you?”

“I told you, I'm Mr. Wolf. Eat.”

I weighed my options. I could run again, but he would catch me and I would have to leave the food behind besides. I could scream, but he'd clap a hand over my mouth and carry me off before anyone came to help — assuming anyone actually did, which was far from a guarantee. He was probably crazy…if he was even real. It occurred to me that he may not be. For all I knew I’d managed to swallow the pills and all of this was just a dying brain’s last gasp before all its synapses popped.

Besides, I'd woken up that morning expecting to be dead at this very moment. Instead I was eating for the first time in years…and enjoying myself.

I had nothing to lose.

“So.” I took another bite. “You know something’s eating me. What else do you know?”

“I know that if you don’t eat, you will be in very big trouble.”

Just like that, the food turned to putty in my mouth. My stomach churned and clenched, trying to force each bite right back up. I thought of a hundred scoldings from my doctor and a thousand different readings on my shitty bathroom scale. My face curled into a snarl. “Yeah, I know. If I don’t eat, I’ll die.” *Been there, done that, fucker*.

“You won’t *die*. It will be much worse than death, and it will never end.”

“Sounds like a standard work week to me.”

“You’re funny. I like people who are funny when they’re scared, but there is nothing funny about this.” He watched me intently. “When you are done with your food, you are going to come see what will happen if you do not eat.”

A hundred dire warnings echoed in my heart. Don’t scream *help,* scream *fire*. Fight and kick. Spit. Vomit. Piss your pants, shit them if you can, and never, ever let them take you to a second location.

“Why don’t you bring whatever you want me to see here, instead of taking me somewhere else to see it?”

His face darkened. Fear curled in the pit of my stomach. Then his mouth fell into an exaggerated frown, and the fear eased a little. “Someone will see and I will get in trouble. They will make us go back home tonight, and then we will not get to take care of the thing that’s eating you.”

“About that.” Another bite. To my immense relief, the flavor had returned. “Where exactly is home?”

His hesitation made me scared.

“Tell you what,” he finally said. “First, you eat. Second, I show you what happens when you don’t eat. Third, we will solve your other problem. You'll trust me after that. Once you trust me, we will have another conversation about your future. *After* you eat.”

But by then, the carton was already empty. My stomach growled loudly enough that Mr. Wolf heard it. He laughed.

“I have more food. But first, I have someone for you to meet.” He held out his hand. “Let's go to the van.”

This made my stomach fall in ways that had nothing to do with the night, or his terrible voice, or the barely tamped-down panic roiling in my gut, or even the mention of a van.

Back before I was in recovery, my medical team staged periodic interventions. They had me meet people who had recovered from eating disorders right along with people who hadn’t. They were almost always ghastly. Shrunken, stinking, almost inhuman. Worst of all they were in denial.

Somehow I never made the connection that I was starting to become them, or that I already was.

Anyway, it makes me sound paranoid to say it now, but I started wondering if this whole insane encounter was just another intervention. If Mr. Wolf was on some medical team or maybe a therapist hired by my aunt. Whether he was going to drive me to a clinic or support group and make me gawk at some  other poor girl so ghastly skinny that her body didn’t look real anymore.

“I’m not going anywhere with you,” I said. “Especially not in a goddamn van. I mean, are you serious?”

He rubbed his forehead. “I will make you a deal. I will bring the van here if you promise you will not run.”

I agreed — because that’s what you do when you’re ninety-two pounds and weaker than shit, you capitulate to people stronger than you — and waited while he vanished into the darkness. I won’t lie: I thought about running. But it would be useless. I could barely even walk. I wouldn’t stand a chance.

Besides, I was scared of making him mad.

So I waited, distracting myself by licking the leftover sauce out of the food carton. It didn’t taste particularly good, but each drip gave me energy. Like I was a video game character powering up.

When a windowless white van pulled up to the sidewalk five minutes later, I stood up.

Mr. Wolf got out of the drive seat and waved me over. I immediately retreated. “No, not happening, you’re not getting me anywhere close to —”

Before I could blink, he grabbed me by the jacket again and dragged me to the back. Fear erupted, overpowering and almost transcendent. This was it. I’d gambled with my life because I was depressed, and was about to lose.

Keeping one hand tangled in my sister’s coat, he threw open the trunk.

The smell hit me first, crashing like the kind of wave that takes out entire lighthouses.

I reeled back, gagging. Bile burned my throat. The rubbery wet slurry of half-digested food tickled my tongue.

There was a crate in the trunk, the kind of reinforced steel box they use for vicious dogs. Mr. Wolf shoved me forward, pressing down on my neck until I was eye-level with the thing inside.

I burst into tears. 

He leaned down, so close I could smell his breath. “That is what will happen to you if you do not eat.”

The thing in the crate reached for me, wet flesh glistening. My mind felt jammed, broken. I was talking, but the words seemed to spill out without my input. “That’s a zombie. That is a goddamned zombie.”

“No such thing.”

I tried to bolt, but it was futile. He set both hands on my shoulders and held me in place. “Listen. When your heart stopped, you became something else. I don't like the word ‘vampire,’ but I think it's a word you will understand. This -" He pushed me toward the crate - "is what happens to vampires who do not eat. They rot. When people rot, they die. But you are already dead. I can teach you how to live when you’re dead, but only if you eat. Otherwise you will rot and rot and *rot* until you look like her. She is your future—”

The corpse in the crate wormed its fingers through the bars, coming within an inch of my face. One was puffy and wet, one black and shriveled, and one was stripped to the bone.

That was the moment I decided to believe him.

After all, I’d been rotting before my own eyes for months. Bruises that sank and spread, opening into sores that wouldn’t heal. Skin infections that left tissue too delicate to stitch. I was dying. In all ways that mattered, I was already dead.

“ —*unless you eat*.”

“But I’ve been eating!” I screamed. “I try. I try every day, and I’m so hungry all the time but no matter what I just throw it back up again!”

“That is because you’re eating the wrong things.” He slammed the trunk shut. “I can feed you the right things, and they will keep you from rotting any worse than you have. But they will not make you better because something is eating you faster than you yourself can eat. If you are going to get better, this thing has to die. You have to kill it.”

“I can’t.” I was sobbing and hated myself for it. I was scared of everything. Of the sores on my body and my papery skin, of a lifetime without my sister, of my future and my past and the living corpse in the van and above all of the monster in front of me. “I can't kill him”

“So this someone is a him? Tell me everything.”

Just like that, the floodgates broke, the dam cracked, and the valley flooded. My first and only true confession.

I told him *everything*. 

Things I’d told other people, and things I hadn’t told anyone, including things I hadn’t even told myself. All of it, right down to the way my sister’s ex grinned when the police dropped the charges.

After I finished, Mr. Wolf said, “I’m sorry. My sister is dead, too.” He heaved a great sigh. “I can make sure this man dies. I can make sure you are the one to do it, and I can make sure he knows why you are killing him.”

This was the capstone for the entire insane night. Insanity upon insanity. 

Even so, I believed him.

“What are you?” I asked. “Really, what are you?”

“Your friend.”

“You’re too fucking scary to be my friend.”

“You’re right. I am a bad friend, anyway. Much better as a brother. So think of me as your brother.”

I scoffed. “At your age? No way. Dad, maybe.”

He shrugged affably. “Okay then. I am your new dad.”

“Dads have done nothing but fuck up my life. No more dads.”

He rolled his eyes. “I'm too old to be your brother, and have not yet ruined your life enough to be your dad. What, then?”

I chewed on this a moment. I remembered my sister and all the ways I fantasized about killing her boyfriend. Whatever else he might have been, Mr. Wolf was an answer to a thousand desperate prayers. “I don’t know. Guardian angel?”

Something flickered across his face. “I've met two angels and I'm nothing like either. But I have another idea.” His eyes brightened and he leaned forward suddenly, like an animal about to strike. 

My stomach clenched. *Here it comes,* I thought. What always comes with these guys, no matter how nice they seem at first.

To be fair, this one hadn’t seemed nice at all.

“I can be your patron saint.”

This surprised me. I frowned.

He responded with a highly exaggerated moue. “Let me guess. Too religious?”

“No.” I squirmed. “I just…I thought—”

“I know what you thought. I know what you have been thinking. You are wrong.” He threw his hands up, slightly mocking. “And that does not mean you're not pretty, or that no one will ever want you. It only means this is not that.”

To my own amazement, I believed him. “Saint Wolfman.”

“If you like. I have no medal for you, but I do have this.” Before I could react, he pulled a bowie knife from a bag in the trunk and put my hand. It was heavy enough that my wrist buckled.

For the next three days, I held that knife and prayed to my patron saint.

Those prayers manifested as conversations. I think I talked more in those three days than in all the rest of my life put together. I prayed for strength, opportunity, intelligence, and vengeance. Most of all, I prayed for death.

Saint Wolfman transformed those prayers into a plan.  

He wasn’t nice about it. Saint Wolfman wasn’t nice at all. He was belligerent, rude, and unmistakably bloodthirsty. He thought up ways to hurt my sister’s ex that were so gruesome even I couldn’t stomach them. A couple times, I even wondered if he was a worse man than Nick. 

He kept the corpse close at all times, too. “You need the reminder,” he said when I complained. “If you don’t see and smell it, you will forget to eat.”

I hated that thing. I didn’t care if he refused to call it a zombie. That thing was a zombie. Saint Wolfman put its crate in the kitchen. The stench of it suffused my apartment, contaminating everything from the ceiling to the floor. I couldn’t look at it without crying. Without imagining myself, rotting and mindless and starving, staring between reinforced iron bars for the rest of an existence I was too far gone to comprehend.

At least I didn’t forget to eat.

On the evening of the third day, we finalized our plan. It was simple: We would corner Nick outside his club, load him into van, and drive him out of the city. We would keep him next to the zombie, because that would scare him. When we got to our destination, we would kill him in all the agonizing ways Saint Wolfman dreamed up for me. 

“Before we begin,” he said, “do you have any questions?”

“Yeah, actually. How did you know about me? Like…how did you find me?”

I didn’t expect him to answer, but he surprised me. “I found you because I smelled you. You smell like daisies and death. Any other questions?”

And then, before the thought even solidified, my mouth ran away: “What happened to your teeth?”

“I pulled them out.”

“What? *Why*?”

“Because wolves with teeth don’t go to heaven.”

On that enigmatic note, we loaded the zombie into the van (although I accidentally dropped my end of her crate when she scratched me through the bars) and drove to Nick’s club.

I was pretty sure Nick would be there, but not positive. Before he killed her, Carissa had told me all about his schedule. The days he was at the club, what he did when he was there and for how long. On Saturday nights, he always left at 2:30am.

Nick was clearly a creature of habit, because sure enough, we caught him leaving at 2:30.

When Saint Wolfman grabbed him, Nick reacted immediately. For a second I thought it was all for nothing, that we were lost, because Nick *fought.* He even pulled a gun and I was sure this was the end, that Nick would win again and kill my fucked up patron saint and me and even the poor zombie in the trunk.

Then Saint Wolfman grabbed his hand, gun and all, and crushed it. I heard the bones break, little cracks and pops.

Nick gagged, then screamed, then mewled. The gun fell from his hand. Saint Wolfman kicked it away, then loaded Nick into the van. He held him down while I tied him up. We put him right next to the zombie. The sight of her made him scream again. This time he didn’t stop. His screaming didn’t annoy me. It made me happy. I watched in the rearview mirror as the corpse stroked Nick’s face with its rotting fingers, leaving greasy streaks on his cheek.

Saint Wolfman drove us up to the state park. I chose it because Carissa and I used to camp there. I knew my way around, how to weave between the pines and scale the steep hills…and hopefully I would know how to hide a body. Of course before we hid the body, we had to kill it.

I couldn’t wait.

So when the van finally slowed down, twigs and tiny pinecones popping under the treads just like Nick’s bones had popped in Saint Wolfman’s hands, I jumped out before we’d even parked. I practically bounced around to the back and threw open the trunk. Absolutely giddy now, I reached for the bowie knife .

Saint Wolfman put his hand on my arm. “No.”

Outrage exploded. “You said we’re going to kill him!”

“We are. Horribly, and we are even going to torture him first. But we will be sportsmanlike. Fair hunters give prey a head start.”

“He’s going to get away!”

“Do you really think he could get away from me?”

“Well...no. But what’s the point of a head start, then?”

Saint Wolfman smiled so widely that I saw pale crescents of freshly erupted teeth glistening in his gums. “Because it will make him more scared.”

The corpse in the crate moaned as if in agreement. Nick squealed and began to sob.

“I don’t think he can get more scared than he already is.”

“That’s because you have no imagination. Luckily, I do.”

I realized he was changing before my eyes. Saint Wolfman was already a monster of a man by any metric, but there, in the moonlight filtering through the pine needles, he was becoming even more monstrous. His mouth seemed to have grown, spreading into a jackal grin that went too far up his face. I saw his new teeth again, glistening like moonlit ice.

He leaned down so he was eye-level with Nick, who shrieked. “I am going to untie you. You may do as you like when you're free. You may run, you may hide, you may beg. I suggest you fight, but the choice is yours. Are you ready?”

Nick mewled. The zombie reached through the bars again, blackened nail scraping his face.

“I hope that was a yes.” With that, Saint Wolfman grabbed Nick by the collar, tore his ropes off, and threw him onto the ground.

For a moment, Nick started up at him, eyes popping from his head as that ridiculous warble leaked from his mouth.

Then he lurched around and ran.

Saint Wolfman growled. “I hate them when they run.” Then he turned to me, snarling. “What are you waiting for? Go! Catch him!”

My heart fell. “But I thought you—”

“Not me! This is a fair hunt, not a slaughter! *You* go! *Catch him*!”

Equal parts angry, confused, and doubtful, I stumbled after Nick..

But I didn’t stumble for long. 

Every step was easier than the last, every moment more beautiful. The silvered pines, the fragrant mulch deadening my footfalls, the happy moonlight. Even Nick’s acrid onion stench was beautiful. I even liked the way his wet, blubbery whimpers pierced my eardrums.

I noticed other smells too — saliva and hair and sweat and fresh teeth erupting from clean gumlines.

Finally Nick stumbled and fell, smacking himself against a tree. He scooted away, sobbing and warbling “Don’t kill me. Please don’t.”

“Do you know why you’re here?”

He shook his head.

“Because you killed my sister." To my horror, a sob worked its way up my throat. "Carissa.”

His face froze. 

And then he laughed.

I didn’t know why. I don’t know why.

And I’ll never know why, because before I could ask, Nick collapsed in on himself, staring over my shoulder in horror.

I turned. Nestled between the pines were opaque lights. Small, cloud-shrouded moons. Eyes. Saint Wolfman’s eyes, shining through the trees.

“Take out your knife,” he said.

Nick somehow got even smaller. He wept and blubbered. “Blubbered” is such a good word. Wet and thick and slimy, just like the sounds exploding from his mouth.

Saint Wolfman sidled up beside me, so huge the moon cast his shadow halfway up the trees. "Take out your knife,” he repeated. “And do what you will.”

I did.

And I took my time.

I didn’t want to kill Nick. Once he died, he would be free. Once he died, he would be wherever Carissa was. 

He didn’t deserve that.

So instead I just…kept making him hurt.

Until Saint Wolfman suddenly surged forward, less wolf than a monstrous snake, and tore Nick’s jawbone off.

Hot blood splattered my face as Nick’s tongue lolled. He tried to scream again, but only choked.

I watched in shock as Saint Wolfman placed Nick’s jawbone into his own mouth, biting down experimentally until it crunched. “Look!” He leered. "I have teeth again.”

“Wolves with teeth don’t go to heaven,” I said.

“*This* is heaven. Kill him.”

I cut Nick’s throat. The look in his eyes and the smell of his blood made my mouth water.

As blood drained, Saint Wolfman plunged his hand into Nick’s chest cavity and extracted what I knew to be his heart. It was bigger than I expected, and uglier. He held it out to me. It glimmered in the moonlight.

“Eat,” he said.

I didn’t answer. I couldn’t.

“We must all perform our penance. Your penance is indulgence” Saliva sheeted down his chin, gathering in heavy ropes that swung from his jaw. The moonlight made them glow.  “Accept it. Celebrate it. *Eat*.”

I took Nick’s heart. It was hot to the touch, and firm enough to make me squirm.

Saint Wolfman watched me with his cloudy bright eyes, smile spreading upward even as I watched. 

I took a bite and almost fainted.

It was Saturday night Quizno’s and Mario Party marathons with Carissa. It was gorging myself on Halloween night while she sorted the remaining candy by flavor. It was jubilant post-game pizza parties on bitter gray days and homemade birthday cake in the house we lost and Denny’s on Christmas after Mom’s night shift and buttery popcorn at school carnivals.

It was heaven.

I finished it all, and then I ate the rest of Nick.

I don’t remember falling asleep, but I remember waking up with a full stomach for the first time in years. 

And for the first time in almost as long, I didn’t loathe myself for feeling full.

Saint Wolfman was there. He still had Nick’s jaw in his mouth, like dentures designed by Ed Gein.

“Thank you,” I said. “I was wrong. You’re definitely my friend.” 

“I'm not your friend.”

As ridiculous as this is, that really hurt my feelings. “Of course you are. You helped me.”

He gave me a bleak smile. “I am glad to help you. But I do not want the best for you. And do you remember when we first met?”

“It was like two days ago, so…yeah?”

“Then you remember that you ran.” 

I didn’t know what he meant. Something in his face made me sure I didn’t want to.

Then that blank look transformed into an expression I couldn’t read. For an awful moment, he didn’t look human. Then he snapped to attention, and his eyes crinkled. “Enough talk. It’s time for us to go home.”

I didn’t know what he meant, but I went anyway because after everything he’d done for me, I trusted him.

I guess I shouldn’t have, because “home” turned out to be this place.

It’s not the worst thing, I guess. I’m warm, I get fed, I don’t have to worry about being homeless or getting sick. And at least I’m useful. That’s why you call me the cleanup crew, right? Because I clean up some pretty big messes.

The problem is, though — and no offense — you guys make me eat a lot. Too much, if I’m being honest. And because of what you make me eat, I’m kind of right back to where I started:

Not liking how it feels when I get full.
