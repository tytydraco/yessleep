Last time I escaped from him, it was hard. Luckily, he took my mate and not me. But this time we're going to end it and erase him from existence.

Since we will kill him, it will not make much sense, but just in case, I wanted to give details for the ritual. To summon the Dream Man, you must first do the Enter the Same Dream ritual and be in the same dream with your friends. For the ritual of Entering the Same Dream, you must first fall asleep at the same time as your friends. You can also try this with your own self, but I say use drugs. After falling into the dream at the same time, you should realise that you are in the dream. When you realise that you are in the dream, you both need to try to perform the ritual. First of all, think about your home.

&#x200B;

 It is very important that you are in your home, where you are lying. Even if you cannot create exactly the same building, simulate it. Find a sack of salt in your room. No matter how big it is, it will never run out in the dream. If you run out, create a new one. It won't be difficult in a lucid dream state. Sprinkle the salt where you lie. The more the better. Then find candles and put them around your bed. At least 19. Make sure you light all the candles. Trust me, if you want to have the same dream as your friend, you don't want to be disturbed. Those candles will protect you from your subconscious.

&#x200B;

 Then take the clothes your friend wears to bed and put them in your room where they sleep. If they are more than one, do them all one by one. If you are not in the same house, find his house and do this. After putting the clothes, go to bed and try to sleep. It will be difficult to tell if you are asleep or not because after you fall asleep you will dream again and your house will look the same. The only way you'll know is if your friend does it too. If your friend has done this, he or she will be with you, so you will be able to enter the same dream, but remember that each time you try this ritual, your sleep time will be reduced by 20 minutes. 

&#x200B;

This will cause you to sleep less and not rest well. While searching for a way to kill the Dream Man in the forums, I came across a legend of a man. According to the legend, he couldn't fall asleep anymore because he was doing this ritual all the time and after a while he committed suicide.

&#x200B;

Now we come to summon the Dream Man. Gather in an empty field with your friends in the same dream. Imagine and build a mansion together. If you succeed, go inside and lock the door. Then you must pour blood all over the house. There should not be a place in the house that is not painted with blood. After doing this, say the following words in unison:

*Come, Dream Man, from beyond the veil,*

*Enter this world and do not fail,*

*To take us on a journey deep,*

*Into the land of endless sleep.*

&#x200B;

In this way, you have invited the Dream Man to home. After a while, you will hear a noise at the outer door. Something will unlock the door and come in. He... looks pale. His skin is white and he walks with a limp. According to rumours, the reason for his limp is that those who tried to kill him before were somewhat successful. The Dream Man will approach you and ask "Which challenge do you want?". Challenges can be different. I don't know all of them, but I will tell you the 3 challenges I know.

&#x200B;

1-Hot dog eating contest: In this challenge, everyone goes into the kitchen and sits down at the table and hot dogs appear out of thin air in front of them. Everyone except the winner of the challenge is taken away. The winner lives as many years as the number of hot dogs he eats. Just because you are in a dream does not mean you can eat infinite hot dogs, remember that. You can eat as many as you can eat in the real world.

&#x200B;

2-Running competition: In this challenge, everyone goes out into the garden and takes their places. They start running with a noisy hum that comes from nowhere. The first one to cross the finish line is the winner. The winner gains as much wealth as the metres he runs. Just because you're in a dream doesn't mean you'll run very fast. You will be as fast here as you are in the real world.

&#x200B;

3 - Asking questions: In this challenge, the winner is everyone. Because the prize is not given to anyone. In this challenge, people ask each other questions from random question cards distributed to their hands. The questions are in 3 levels so that the other person can know, has difficulty in remembering or has great difficulty in knowing. The person asking does not know which one is which. If even 1 of the challengers answers 10 questions correctly, the challenge is won. The prize is.... Dream Man's death. He will be visibly weakened and damaged with each correctly answered question. If all 10 of the 10 questions are answered correctly, he will die. If he loses, half of the total number of people will be taken. I don't know why this challenge exists, but I understand why no one does it. After all, why kill someone when you can get eternal life from it ?

&#x200B;

When I learnt about the first two challenges, I was very excited. My friends and I wanted to try it. But we didn't know that the loser was taken away. That's why we were happy when we called the Dream Man. Because we thought we were smart, we were dreaming of becoming immortal with the hot dog eating contest and rich with the running contest.When we realised the seriousness of the situation, it was too late for everything.

&#x200B;

Me, Ahmet and Jason were close friends since high school. We studied for the university exam together and went to the same university. So, we were living in the same dormitory. Ahmet was the first one to discover this ritual. He was a person who liked to deal with scary things, so when he told us about the ritual and said he wanted to do it, we couldn't break him. When we fell asleep, everything was normal. When we entered the same dream, everything was normal. When we summoned the Dream Man, everything was normal. But when I won the running competition.... things started to get ugly.

&#x200B;

Since we were in the same dormitory, it was not difficult to do the ritual of Entering the Same Dream. It surprised us a lot. We were in the same dream. It was like a co-op game. After we gathered in the same dream, we searched for an empty land to summon the Dream Man. Since we all studied engineering, it wasn't too difficult to build a house in our minds. When we entered the house and closed the door, we were still joking around. We said the words after we had bloodied the place.

&#x200B;

 There was a vibration at the door. When we all looked there, we saw the Dream Man coming in. He looked terrifying. We froze as he walked towards us. He came up to me and asked: "Which challenge do you want?". I stammered: "R-Running competition...". Dream Man looked at us, then a huge smile appeared on his face. It was not a human smile, a human could not open his mouth that much.I was shaking when the Dream Man walked away from us.Even though this scared us, Ahmet warmed up the atmosphere by making a joke.We discussed for a while. Should we really do this? Yes, it made sense at first, but after seeing the Dream Man, we hesitated. But finally we decided to do it.

I had won the running competition. We were all breathing deeply, exhausted. Then we heard a voice: "Congratulations, you won the race. Stay peaceful...". We turned round. The Dream Man was coming towards us. "The losers will be punished." He raised his hand. Ahmet and Jason slowly rose into the air and then disappeared.... I couldn't believe my eyes.

&#x200B;

 I didn't want to believe it, maybe they had woken up. After glancing at the Dream Man, the surroundings started to darken and tremble, then I woke up in my bed. After a few seconds of thinking about what I was going through, I immediately raised my head and looked at the other beds. The beds were empty....

I spent the next week looking for them. I called their families but they said they didn't have such children. I searched for traces of them, looked at the dormitory list, but their names were not there. Their phone numbers were unavailable and no one but me remembered them.

&#x200B;

 Even the teacher they had an argument with in college said she didn't remember anyone like that. This horrified me. Meanwhile, money was pouring into my bank accounts. The coupons I had played had paid off and my crypto coins were worth a lot of money.

So I spent the money looking for a helper to help me bring them back. I came across someone on a forum. His name was Ovme, and when I offered him a salary of $1,000 a month, he jumped at the chance. I told him what had happened and asked him to help me gather information about the Dream Man. He was really kind-hearted and agreed to help me.

&#x200B;

 We spent weeks travelling the forums together, looking for a way. But unfortunately there was no way to bring back those who had gone.So we started looking for ways to kill him, and that's when I saw the legend of the man who committed suicide.After some more research, we discovered a way to fight back. A way to kill him. The way of revenge.

Ovme and I agreed and entered the same dream. After I summoned the Dream Man, Ovme couldn't believe his eyes. When the Dream Man saw me, he put on his shapeless smile again. He came up to me and asked: "Which challenge do you want?".

&#x200B;

 I looked at him nervously and told him I wanted the challenge of asking questions. His expression changed instantly. "No one had ever tried this challenge before." he said and walked away from me. With each correct answer, the Dream Man was getting weaker and collapsing. As I got the questions right, he collapsed to the ground and could not get up. It was obvious that he was having difficulty breathing. After I got 9 questions right, I looked at him. He was whispering something, but his whispering was not understood. There was only one question left. Ovme asked a random question because he didn't know much about me. This question was about anime and I didn't watch anime. At that moment, a chill ran down my spine. 

&#x200B;

I looked at Dream Man. He kept whispering as he continued to look at me and smile. Damn it, he understood! I tried to answer the question, but... I gave the wrong answer. The Dream Man suddenly stood up. We froze in place, staring at him in horror. He approached us. He said, "The losers will be punished." Then he came to us. "You were dying, you bastard! One more question and you'd be dead!" I said. He looked at me and smiled and said, "I know." "That's why I asked them for help.". My eyes widened. That whispering.... was actually a call for help in a language we didn't know. We looked at the outer door, it was shaking.

&#x200B;

 Something was coming. Dream Man: "You don't want them to take you.". I looked at him and accepted my fate. There were two of us, so one would go. He chose Ovme, not me. Ovme levitated and disappeared. The Dream Man turned to me: "This is the only chance I'm giving to you. Use it well." Then he smiled.

When I woke up, I cried in anger. One more person had gone because of me. But it would be the last time.

&#x200B;

That's why I've found someone else and we're going to give it one last try. I'm confident I'll succeed and kill the bastard. But if I fail, please try this ritual and kill him. This is my last request to you.
