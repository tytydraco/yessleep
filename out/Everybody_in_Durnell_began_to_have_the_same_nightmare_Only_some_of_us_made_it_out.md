When I moved to Durnell a few years back, it was pretty much exactly what I expected it to be and exactly what I was looking for. A small, sleepy town tucked away in a foggy pocket of nowhere. It was one of those forgotten places you’d drive through on your way to somewhere more grandiose, nestled in the backwoods where time seems to slow. 

And I loved it.

My work allowed me to live anywhere so long as it was in-country and I had just come off the back of a three-year relationship after having moved from my own small town out to the big city for college. Durnell was smaller and quieter, but I was more than happy to settle in somewhere I could be a known entity. Somewhere without the anonymity of city life and without the baggage of *my* small town.

Main Street consisted of the typical essentials along with a few scattered mom-and-pop shops which looked as if they hadn’t seen a soul in many years. I often found myself perched up with a book or quietly getting some work done at my favourite window booth in the linoleum-floored, dimly lit and excellent-tasting *Durnell Diner* and as such spent quite a bit of time on Main Street. Perhaps it isn’t as important as it may seem, but in a town like Durnell being a familiar face on Main Street as neighbours and strangers went about their business was an important social lubricant and it helped me settle in quite well.

Over the next few months, I began to feel at home both within my small but comfortably cosy house and the town’s community at large. I’d spend my days working and my evenings and weekends in the little hideaway of a bar - *Starry Tavern* - which sat snugly between the general store and the diner on Main. Wounds from city life and all that came with it began to heal and I appreciated the creature comforts of small-town life in what felt like a simultaneously all-too-familiar yet completely novel environment. 

But then the nightmares wormed their way into our lives.

Over a period of a day or two, the town suddenly sprung to life during dark evenings and black nights. Where usually nary a footstep could be heard or light be seen, the buzz on Main Street could be heard from a mile away and neighbours’ windows filled with harsh light. I was swamped with work as an important deadline loomed and curiosity only seeped into my mind once the weekend rolled around. Besides, the fact that I had struggled for a good night’s sleep because of a nightmare I’d had twice in a row wasn’t helping my general state of timid grumpiness. 

I have a hard time recounting the contents of that nightmare ever since I left Durnell behind, but I will give it my best shot. My dream-state form would awaken to laying in a field of tall grass under a heavy, red-infused sky with the distinct feeling of being watched. Unseen eyes pierced my very essence from every possible direction, and yet my view remained the empty grass and sky for as far as my vision could stretch. I would try to find my way out - away from whatever had its eyes fixed upon me - but it felt like trying to wade through a never-ending river of molasses. After what felt like forever, a figure came into view of my periphery. Even then, without being able to see this figure clearly, I could tell that it was… *off*. 

But I was always unable to resist looking at it in all its detail. Limbs of grossly stretched proportions twisted in all the wrong directions, skin was pulled taut over a smooth and almost featureless face and a misshapen spine painted the image of a being that seemed as if it was perpetually on the verge of collapsing in on itself like a dying star. I say *almost* featureless because a jagged, hungry smile elongated itself across the creature’s otherwise blank canvas of a head. I could almost swear that smile was a being of its own, and it wanted *me*. 

The third night and the night that I first wasn’t distracted enough by the constant pinging of E-Mail notifications on my laptop to notice the hubbub as dusk whistled out of town and gave birth to darkness was a Friday night. I’d planned on heading over to the Starry Tavern for a celebratory tipple after getting through that stressful anyway, but I hadn’t planned on what I found when I got there. 

Instead of the usual Friday night crowd of the working men of the town, the bar was packed wall-to-wall with the concerned faces of elder men and women who wouldn’t be caught dead in a place like that at a time like this. I’d been around long enough by that point to know people’s routines - especially my neighbours - and this was little old Margaret and Dave’s quiet dinner-in-front-of-the-tv time, so what on Earth were they doing *here*? Through the next few hours, I came to understand something that seemed impossible. Everybody in the town was having that same nightmare. The same miscoloured sky, the same towering grass, and the same watchful figure off in the distance. Some said the figure was moving closer to them each night and that they had lost the ability to move in this strange world. It pointed at their paralysed forms with cruelly mangled fingers and closed the distance night after night. Some hadn’t even seen the figure yet. And others, myself included, lay in between these two states. I swore I heard an elderly voice whisper something like “Oh no, this can’t be happening again…”, but when I loudly called for clarification my request fell on deaf ears. 

Perhaps those of us who made it out of Durnell after what happened next should have insisted on an answer to that question.

Everybody in the town had that same nightmare, except we were all unwilling participants in different stages of it with the stomach-churning knowledge that those who were “behind” would soon be witness to whatever came next ourselves. Once the little logic we could take out of the situation had been established, the conversation moved onto an unrelenting salvo of questioning the impossibility of what we were experiencing, what would happen once the figure reached us and what, if *anything*, we could do about it. 

Somewhat naturally, given the topic, no real answers were found that night. The next night, though, did bring some.

Nobody wanted to sleep after that Friday night. I mean, who can blame us? So those of us who were able resolved to stay up and together for the weekend and see if we could break free of the synchronised cycle we found ourselves in. Others weren’t so lucky. After a night of theorising and entertaining ourselves through sleep deprivation at the Starry Night, I decided to throw in the towel and head home just as the sun began to slowly move above the horizon. Margaret and Dave hadn’t had the energy to join us at the bar that night as they had already skipped out on sleep the night prior and insisted they would be fine at home. “It’s just a nightmare, we all get nightmares don’t we honey?”, I remember Margaret telling me as I worriedly listened to their plan. They had been seeing the figure for a week by that point, by far the longest of anyone in town, and it was descending on them. Rapidly. Nobody knew what would happen when it reached them, and to this day part of me believes they wanted to show the rest of us that we would be okay. That it was all just a weird coincidence. I don’t think she believed what she was saying, but I desperately hope it provided her and her husband with a little comfort as they slept in each other’s arms on that fateful night.

I knocked on the neatly decorated eggshell white door for what must have been 10 minutes before a terrible instinctive feeling prompted me to grab the spare key from underneath the potted plant just to the left of my feet and venture inside. The silence inside smothered me like an oppressive fog. My gut continued to scream at me. This wasn’t the silence of a restful couple’s Sunday morning sleep. I slowly climbed the stairs and pushed the door to their bedroom open only to be met with a scene of… 

I still don’t believe words are able to convey the image that burned itself into my very core on that crisp morning.

Margaret and Dave lay there in their bed, but all of the life had been sucked out of them. The first responders couldn’t for the life of them explain how *all* of the blood in their now raisin-like bodies was just… gone. They can’t explain how the bed remained completely undisturbed as if they had been sleeping peacefully one moment and spontaneously morphed into what lay before them the next. 

They couldn’t explain any of it, but those of us who lived in Durnell knew. 

Immediately after, something of an exodus began. Those who were able and willing packed their belongings up throughout that same day and left the town behind. 

I was one of them. 

As I was driving through Main on the way out, I passed by the Mayor erecting a sign in large black lettering against a white backdrop. 

“STAY AWAKE. IT’S ALMOST HERE”.

If only it were so easy.

But we didn’t just leave the town behind, we left *people* behind. Some grew up there and refused to abandon their home, some were sick, some were old and frail and others just plain stubborn. After my departure, I thought it’d be over. That I’d rid myself of whatever disease was spreading through our lives. That distance was enough to end that chapter of my life. And for a short while, it was.

Until the nightmare came back. The figure picked up right where it left off. Like it had unfinished business. With the town, and with *me*. And this time, I could no longer move either and was forced to lock my eyes onto the part of the figure’s face it’s eyes *should* have been. I could only deprive myself of sleep for so long, and with each night its menacingly pointed finger moved ever so closer to my terrified form. Until it moved close enough for me to realise it wasn’t pointing at me anymore. It wanted me to turn around. 

And as if it had suddenly given me permission to, I was able. 

I saw Durnell. I saw my old house. 

And I saw my methodically dried, lifeless body lying in bed. I saw what should have happened to me. What would have happened to me.

Then it showed me the rest. All those who chose to stay. All who were forced to stay. I tried to scream, to run, to cry and yet I found anything except watching impossible. My mouth held itself agape but no sound was produced. My feet stuck to the ground as if they had grown roots and became one with the Earth. My eyes stung as if I had cried for hours, but no tears formed.

I woke up an indeterminable amount of time later and screamed until my vocal cords gave way. Almost as if I was being mocked, I cried until my tear ducts could no longer produce any more. The remainder of that day and the weeks following remain a blur of mental breakdowns, hospitals, police reports and grief.

I knew - no, I know, - that what happened to Durnell and its people was real. I lived it. And yet, the town itself doesn’t seem to exist anymore. Everything I own that even slightly references my once-home has been altered. Instead of being emblazoned with *Starry Night* in golden lettering, the coaster I once won after a game of darts in my old haunt bore the name of a city bar I frequented in my time before Durnell. The mileage on my car has decreased to roughly what it would have been before my big move from the city.  My lease documents for the house I lived in there now contain the details of my new house. I can’t find anything about Durnell on the internet and it doesn’t show up on any of the innumerable maps I have studied in the time since.

And yet, I know it was all real. 

Because last night, when I was deep into another night of restless and dreamless sleep, I found myself under that familiar red sky again.

And off in the distance, there it was again.

That same old smile.

I might have left Durnell behind, but I’m afraid I brought something with me. 

Maybe those who stayed behind knew something the rest of us didn’t.
