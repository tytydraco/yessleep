I don’t remember falling back asleep, only jolting awake when someone shook my shoulder. I turned, bleary eyed, to see Stephen’s beaming face, his red hair blinding me.

“Rise and shine, Niall,” he chirped, already dressed, munching on a cereal bar. 

I grunted and turned away, burying my face in the soft grass. I didn’t even care about the dew wetting my face.

“Come on, lazybones,” Stephen tried again, “You don’t want to sleep the day away, do you?”

I let the silence be my answer. Pulling my beanie down over my eyes, I curled into a ball, returning to the warm embrace of sleep. I wanted to cook in my sleeping bag.

“Alright,” I heard Stephen sigh, “We’ll let you sleep more, but come find us when you do eventually get up.”

I grunted, sinking back into the darkness. Before I did, I caught the tail end of the pair’s conversation,

“I’m missing a water from my bag,” I heard John Joe say, followed by the zip of a bag.

“Have one of mine,” then, the sound of chewing made me burrow further into my bag.

When the pair finally left, jumping over the wall, their shoes scuffing the stones, I never realised just how comfortable grass could be, even with the chill of morning dew. My cheek went numb, but the rest of me was blissfully warm. I turned my head, the dew followed. Teetering on the border between sleep and the waking world, I felt a cold droplet drip down my cheek, almost like cold fingers were tracing patterns on my skin.

“Lads, come on,” I grumbled, sleepily, “I’ll get up in a minute.”

The feeling was still there. That singular droplet danced across my face, I ignored it.

Eventually, I cracked open an eye. The sky was its usual grey; budding clouds bordered my vision. The promise of rain scented the air. Whilst rubbing my eyes, I noticed something next to me. A Pot Noodle, gently steaming. The other men were intent on feeding me something. The gesture should have been sweet, but it only angered me. The smell of curry sent my stomach into a familiar lurch. Ripping up a fistful of grass, I poured it out. 

As I did, a chill went up my spine, different than the morning dew. My skin broke out into goose bumps, the hairs on my arms stood up. I looked all around me, I was alone. Just the gentle, swaying grass, and a singular red bush, twitching by the cliff’s edge. Hiding the empty cup, I got up and stretched. The others left their bags beside me; I could tell from the bulky shape that Stephen had books more than anything. The wind was gentler today but I still put on a jumper.

Leaving the cottage, back into the Irish wilderness, I thought about what to do. It had just struck 12, and the boredom was waiting for me. Shoving my hands into my pockets, I gazed out at the barren dwellings. Just as eerie as yesterday. It was the silence that did it. That heavy, choking silence. The little remnants of homes, slowly being devoured by the land, the moss and bog growing like the scab of a wound. I leaned against the wall, dislodging a loose corner. 

As I sighed, I noticed something else. Nestled by the doorway was a stacked pile of rocks. Knee high, all different shapes, piled like Lego bricks. Wait. There was more. Every ruined cottage had its own little pile. The name lumbered into my mind like a sluggish drunk. Cairns. The namesake of the village. I didn’t need Stephen to explain it to me. They were burial markers. I tried not to look at the smallest cairns. It was a nice gesture, but I couldn’t shake a sudden feeling of unease as I gazed at them. I had that cold feeling again.

I shook my head, putting it down to the eerie setting. I couldn’t just stand here brooding, not all day. The only thing I could think to do was take a walk. As I put distance between myself and the cairns, my steps grew lighter, like a weight had been lifted. The tangled grass turned to muck; the ground softened under my feet. The wind picked up, it wasn’t strong but it had me shivering. It carried the voices of my friends, growing distant the farther I walked. The rough terrain eased up enough that I wasn’t tripping every second step. I wondered if I could circle the island, but judging from the ache already on my legs, it was a foolish thought.  

Kicking an errant rock, I thought about following my friends, but didn’t want to feel like a little kid trailing after their parents. How would I have helped anyway? Was I going to search every rock with Stephen? Wade through the water for fish with John Joe? No, I didn’t see myself doing any of that. As my feet stumbled and squelched, I took each sinuous path I found, the sheer boredom urging me on. The rolling hills encompassed me, looming over me the further I walked. I struggled up a steep incline, pulling myself up by handfuls of grass. The ripping sounds drowned out my wheezing, I was more out of shape than I thought. At the top of the hill, as I wiped the sweat from my brow. In this corner of the world, it truly felt like I was the only person left alive.

I don’t know how long I stood there, gazing down at the scenery. I saw more broken cottages, abandoned farms. A snapshot of life interrupted. I slid back down the grass, tripping over the ridge of a lazy bed. Returning to the hairpin path, I stepped off it and headed down to the shore. Stephen was still in control of the cliff, no doubt tearing up the ground to look for more bones. The dirt under my feet turned to sand, and I was soon met with crashing waves, and salt on my tongue. I stood in the empty cove, alone at the edge of the world, with nothing but the wind and the waves for company. Suddenly, I felt an urge, and I kicked my shoes off. The sand was soft, gritty between my toes. With two steps forwards, the cool water lapped at my toes, and a strange feeling overcame me, one I hadn’t felt in god knows how long. I felt calm. It greeted me like an unfamiliar relative. I tried to embrace it, knowing I would never feel this way again. As the wind blew through my hair, I closed my eyes. 

The calm I found was, of course, ruined. Ruined by a sound, the sound of someone hollering above me. I stood in the shadow of a cliff, Stephen’s cliff. At the peak stood a figure, waving down at me. Stephen must have finally took a break from his skull. His arm moved as slow as a pendulum. He hollered down at me, but it was lost to the wind. His sounds were like the hungry howls of a wolf. I sighed,

“What?!” I yelled back, annoyed at having my peace disturbed.

My own voice was an assault to my ears. Stephen didn’t answer, just waved, still in that lazy, slow movement. A lone figure blurred by distance and my near-sightedness.

“What?!” I cupped my hands over my mouth, thinking he couldn’t hear me.

Stephen just waved, his languid movements ticked away the seconds of this strange moment. Then, the waving sped up. With every blink of an eye, he waved faster, and faster, until his arm was a blur. I frowned. Was Stephen having a fit? No, the rest of him was eerily still. He let out another howl, a strange tortured sound, almost like a cry of pain. I sighed again, he must have went over his ankle or something. Picking up my shoes, I headed back up the path, grumbling all the while. 

Of course, the one time I was enjoying myself, it had to be ruined. The sand in my shoes put me in a fouler mood. Lost in my thoughts, I collided with something hard, John Joe. The dirt on his face highlighted how pale he suddenly looked.

“Hey Niall,” he greeted, rubbing his arm, “I was looking for you. Look, I caught something.”

In his hand was something hairy that twitched, I didn’t want a closer look.

“Cool.” I changed the subject.

“What does Stephen want? He’s acting like the island is going to explode,”

“Huh? I don’t know, go ask him,”

“No, he’s all the way up there,” I gestured to the cliff,

“Huh?” John Joe was distracted by his catch, practically licking his lips,

“He’s up at the cliff, probably kissing his new friend,” I smiled at my own joke,

John Joe finally looked at me, the thing in his hand stopped twitching,

“Stephen’s back at camp,” he glanced up at the cliff then back to me,

“What? No, he’s-,” the words died in my throat as I turned around. There was no one on the cliff.

I blinked, “He was just there.”

“No, he’s at camp, I was just talking to him,”

I mumbled, mind blank, “He was waving at me.”

I felt John Joes’ eyes on me, questioning, worried,

“Your mind is playing tricks on you,” his voice was distant, like I was the one on the cliff, and he was calling for me to come down,

“Maybe you’re just hungry, I know I am.”

“No, I’m not.” I mumbled on instinct,

John Joe didn’t listen, “Aye, you are.”

Without warning, he threw his arm around my shoulders, practically dragging me back to camp. His dinner dangled in the corner of my eye, a long, skinny hare, its amber eye empty yet piercing. I felt its gaze on me with every step. I ignored it, my mind in a daze. It had been Stephen waving, hadn’t it? Of course it was, John Joe had to be playing a joke. It had be. I held onto that weak hope, clutching it like a candle in a storm, not daring to think of the alternative, but of course, my being pessimistic, the question waited in the back of my mind, waiting to pounce.

What if we aren’t alone on this island?
