**Traveler’s Log**


Life’s not exactly fair, it can go from heaven to hell in a second. Picture this: you’re happily married to your best friend, you actually love your job, and you finally have saved enough money to enjoy yourself… Vivid enough? This is merely a factor in my life’s equation… Well, loose said job of thirteen years due to a random change in the position’s “requirements.” Of course, this will affect the partner. Your marriage starts to fail and your best friend becomes your biggest critic, love morphs into resentment and inadequacy latches onto every moment spent with her. “Till death do us part” becomes more of a hurdle than a bond. 

Maybe this bitterness was growing between us all along, lying dormant until the swollen bubble of discontent popped. Oh, it popped and it popped bad. I always loved Miranda and I knew she loved me but love isn’t exactly absolute. At least, our love wasn’t… Through a daily dance of passive aggressive remarks and hushed insults, my feelings for her grew cold and then blazing hot. Truth be told, I hate my wife. I hate her shrill voice, I hate her judgmental eyes, I hate her unearned beauty, I hate her snide personality, I just simply and utterly hate her… 

With an empty bed and a head full of doubt, my body began rejecting basic needs. I haven’t slept well since; stuck in a constant loop of waking up in the middle of the night to my own inner thoughts screaming at me. Why did you have to get married? You were happy single and now you can’t live without her… I feel sick… I feel weak… I feel ugly… I feel unhappy… Addicted to her touch like a drug, I needed to wean myself off from her poison.

Well, all of a sudden, she wanted to play hero and save our marriage… Of course, she just had to be the one. She was fine with our relationship being in ruin for months, she was fine without speaking to me for most days out of the week, and she was fine with making me sleep in the guest room for a better part of a year. But she was going to save it… The hero nobody asked for, savior of the relationship nobody wanted… Her answer for this was space, as simple as that… Space… After all that was said between us, some time apart could fix us in her mind.

Either some talentless internet therapist or one of her unbearable friends gave her the idea of a separate vacation, either or, I hardly pay attention to what she says anymore. We would “detoxify and create new memories to share with each other” or some other vapid way of describing getting drunk with strangers. Whatever… I didn’t care anymore, getting a week away from her would be good for me…

I threw some bags together out of spite, loaded up my car with the least amount of effort, and drove off into the distance with no direction in mind. I could see her waving in my mirrors… Though she shrunk with distance, her smile never faltered. Denial has taken her… When I finally stop thinking of her, that’s where I would stop and stay. 

A grueling six hours into the endless drive, it was well into the night and my determination was fading. I don’t know exactly where I am but I found myself in some southern mountain town. Well, I suppose you could call a few scattered buildings a town… I don’t really know what qualifies as a village versus a town, regardless, it was rustic to put it politely. 

The town’s sign was in horrid disrepair, faded beyond belief and covered in thick vines. “HOME OF MIRACLES” and a crude symbol was set in gold over what was left. Uncanny sure but I’ve stayed in worse; I’m not exactly a stranger to sketchy hostels. It was clean enough for a hick town I suppose… I am a man of my word and found my mind Miranda-less for a time. Worse comes to worst, I could just camp out in my car until morning. Maybe I could actually sleep without her lurking around, even the thought of her perfume makes me sick to my core.

Driving through the empty streets, my unease was replaced by some sort of comfort? This place just felt safe, I can’t exactly put it into words… I wouldn’t say it was charming but there was something about it… An allure, a breath of fresh air. It was odd but it felt almost euphoric just to be there, maybe I wasn’t cut out for city life after all. I need a place like this, my body needs a place like this. She’s killing me and this town felt like a cure. 

For as small as it was, the roads were maze-like and one wrong turn you’d be back where you started. I feel like I drove around for fifteen minutes, passing the same few buildings until I found the right turn. A brightly lit sign labeled “HERD’S GARDEN INN: ROOMS AVAILABLE” was sloppily displayed in front of an old building on the town’s furthest outskirts. Could this be a hotel? It couldn’t be… It looked like a church, steeple and all. An old, medium-sized church shoddily renovated into a dingy inn… That’s interesting at least. The steeple on top of the building was damaged and splintered, they must have torn off the cross… They can get rid of that but not the vines and ivy slithering their way up the walls.

For a second, an ember of doubt entered my mind yet again, only to be snuffed out by a thought of Miranda. This is the only inn in town it seems and on second thought, sleeping in my car would be the death of me. I will be fine…

Opening my car door, I was floored by the cold night air. I didn’t pack anything for this climate so I hurried into the Herd’s Garden Inn. Immediately, warm perfumed air wrapped around me like a blanket. It was soothing, borderline intoxicating . Tacky wallpaper of a deep purple, embellished in gold, carelessly lined the walls with carpet the color of wine that stuck to my shoes. It was visually pleasing in its own way, though objectively hideous. A bull’s skull, wrapped in vines, was mounted over what must have been the lobby. I will never understand Southerners…

“Welcome! Cold night, ain’t it?” a cheerful voice called from a makeshift desk. It was a stout, older man with a grin as infectious as the flu. Short, chubby, and with a balding head of frizzy red hair; this man looked like he couldn’t hurt a fly. Dressed in stained and frayed clothing, he looked almost homeless. Though an oddly opulent golden bracelet bearing some sort of token shone like the sun at his wrist. 

“Y-yeah, I can barely feel my fingers…” I said, forcing out a lighthearted tone through my chattering teeth.

“Well lucky for you, the Garden has just what you need! A nice room and something warm to drink!” the older man chuckled. Friendly, yes but he didn’t exactly look like he was on the job.

“That’d be nice… So, do you work here?” I asked.

That had to be the funniest thing he’s heard in years as he almost died from laughing. He had that loud, exaggerated laugh like somebody’s favorite uncle.

“Work here? I own it! Auggie McFalls, pleasure to meet you!” he laughed, clasping my hand with both of his palms in a soft and oily handshake. The stink of alcohol and scented oils clung to his shabby clothing; my eyes began to water as the scent somehow grew stronger.

“Well, nice to meet you Mr. McFalls.” 

“Mr. McFalls? That makes me feel old! Please call me Auggie! The Garden is my baby, me and my sister Amelia really shaped this place up! Oh, it was so tragic before we got here… You should have seen it! Well, I always loved a fixer upper…” he chimed, eyeing me up like I was something miraculous and unknown.

“To be honest, I almost thought your sign was mistaken. It just looks so much like a-“ I was quickly cut off by Auggie’s obnoxious chuckle.

“A church? Keen-eye, buddy! Well it was, funnily enough… Millpoint Ministries was its name… Real shame, the pastor was a sour character and just decided to abandon it. A lot of false prophets out there. Oh what was his name, Donny, Danny- well it doesn’t matter. It died soon after. I couldn’t help myself when I saw such a pretty little building in ruin.” He droned on, gently running his hand across the patchy wallpaper.

“It's definitely an interesting spot. Never can say I’ve slept in an old church before. Well, it's been a long drive so a room would be great. As long as you don’t expect me to get up early for a sermon.” I joked, only for Auggie’s smile to die for a second. Auggie McFalls was a man who looked like he wasn’t built for a frown, an unnatural labored expression twisted his face before twitching slowly back into a smile.

Auggie put a clammy hand on my shoulder. “You know friend, I used to preach a bit at the Eternal Jubilee… It's a church a few miles from here… Me and its pastor, Lysander Sinclair, go way back… Long, ancient history. I was one of his first followers in fact. Though I left the congregation over some… differences… We have an arrangement of sorts… I would love to set you on the right path, though. Salvation comes at its own pace. After all, we are in the home of miracles.” he smiled, gesturing to his bracelet.

“Lysander Sinclair? Like the rockstar? I thought he died of an overdose decades ago… That or beat a prostitute to death I can’t remember…” I may have sounded rude, but why would Auggie McFalls of Town No Name have connections to a Top 40-er. An especially controversial Top 40-er I may add. Holy Harem was more of my dad’s thing but I’ve heard about the scandals… Lysander Sinclair, Rico St. Wilde, Randy Raine, and Adam Swift were ousted from the spotlight, their reputations never recovered and before long nobody really remembered they existed. Not sure if the rumors were true but they should definitely stay under whatever rock they crawled under. 

“The very same! Tabloids do love their exaggeration… He’s still kicking but he prefers the seclusion of this town…  I started off as his roadie back in the day, oh enough about me! I’ve taken enough of your time. You will be staying in the first room down that left hallway, don’t worry about payment. We will sort that out when you decide to leave, feel free to stay as long as you see fit! If you’d like some warm spiced wine, just let me know… Amelia makes it just right.” 

“I’m good for now… I try to steer clear from alcohol…”

“Are you sure buddy? I simply insist! One sip wouldn’t hurt… We ferment it ourselves, not one to brag but you’ll never taste anything better! Warm in a nice mug or straight from the bottle…. Amelia’s special recipe has no equal… It’s like beauty in a bottle!” Auggie cheeped, simply astounded that someone might not want to try his mulled wine.

“Me and alcohol don’t mix…” I sternly replied, growing more impatient with every passing second.

“Well, friend, I just thought a vice or two never hurt anyone… Besides, it takes more than a cup to get you skunk-drunk. I’ll set out a cup if you change your mind! You just look so cold! I’d hate it if you caught something.” he bulked.

“Well that’s certainly nice of you, Auggie, but it’s been a long drive… The rooms have bathrooms with showers, right? I don’t don’t know how much of this place is, well, still a church…” I asked, probably smelling like absolute death from the car ride.

“Top of the line! We did all the renovations… The Garden is my baby after all,” he chuckled, proud as could be. Auggie then briskly handed me a room key before returning to his desk, humming the melody of The Krazy Kourt of the Kobra King. 

Like a loon claiming to have seen Elvis… He had to be crazy, right? Claiming to be close with Holy Harem’s lead singer and ranting about salvation… He’s harmless but crazy I’m sure… Maybe I should leave in the morning… No… I will not go crawling back to Miranda just yet. I feel free, I feel strong, and I feel alive… I don’t care if this place is odd, hell, even if it's dangerous. I would rather die than let her win…

My room was clearly once an office or classroom… Apparently to Auggie renovating meant faded wallpaper and tacky outdated furniture. The “bathroom” was merely a corner of the room, just slapped to the side… Top of the line, my ass. Beggars can’t be choosers… Briskly scanning the room; I locked the door and put a chair in front of it for good measure. 

“Crazy but harmless…” I reminded myself.

In that moment, I thought of Miranda again… Her beautiful hair, her silly little squeak of a laugh, her witty way of making everything a joke… I wanted to call her to see how her vacation was going… Well, fuck you Miranda. Your ratty tangled hair, your grating hyena cackle, and your impulsive need to tear everything down with a quick remark… She’s lived rent free in my head for far too long. A nice hot shower will take my mind off of her.

I tossed my phone onto the bed and got the shower ready. The water was cold, the shower was cramped, and the transparent curtain was riddled in black mold. Closing my eyes, I started to drift deeper into the inner recesses of my mind, I needed sleep… My body felt sticky? Opening my eyes, I noticed a purplish film gathering at the drain. Stinking of a vineyard, the water pouring from the showerhead gained a reddish-purple hue.

“What the hell…” I whispered to myself, quickly flipping the shower off. It had the strong floral stink of wine, though upon second glance, the purple stains were completely gone. My body was just wet… Not a single purple drop on me… Shifting my body to avoid the shower head, I turned it back on… Just water. 

My body and mind were failing me, all I could do was laugh at what I’ve become.  When out of the corner of my eye, a tall shape could be seen through the shower curtain. I recoiled and violently ripped it from its hooks. Nothing… Like a scared child, I frantically checked under the bed and made sure the door was untouched. Just an empty room… The lack of sleep must be catching up to me.

Under the dim lamp light, I saw my pale, sickly reflection in the mirror. Dark circles and heavy bags lined exhausted, bloodshot eyes…  I haven’t looked healthy in a while… The lamp started to flicker until a different shade of bright golden light blazed from its bulb. A strong musk of incense slithered into my room, as my body felt warm and as light as air. My form started to shift in the mirror as I was left in a drunken daze. I looked like I was five years younger- healthy, strong, and happy. Behind me a tall, pale woman appeared with a lithe body marbled with gold. Its hair was fashioned in delicate golden vines with the most exquisite jewelry wrapping around its frame.

It embraced me in a tender hug, resting its deathly pale head upon my shoulder, before revealing its face to the mirror… My God… It had Miranda’s face, down to the last freckle… Yet it had no eyes, a golden chain connected its sunken sockets.

“BEAR WITNESS…” it hissed through her voice, before fading into nothing. The lamp flickered back into the dull white light and I found myself staring at my gaunt reflection. A small, shimmering speck appeared in the mirror as it began to crack. It was almost like something was shoving it through the mirror. Violently shattering into a thousand pieces of glass, the shiny object fell with an audible clink. A golden coin now rested on the dresser, engraved with a naked man and a woman holding hands.

I spun around in a manic daze, arming myself with a large shard of mirror. The door was open with the chair clear across the room… Was I drugged? Did that bastard put something in the vents? This was too real to be a hallucination… Hours had passed in an instant… My phone and car keys were gone. I don’t know if I can escape but I have to try…

Naked and with mirror shard in hand, I ran into the lobby… Every piece of furniture, tall and heavy, was moved in front of the door to form a makeshift wall. I wouldn’t have time, even if I could move every single shelf and dresser by myself. My only option is to find another exit. Though window-less, it may have a different exit somewhere near the back. 

Loud, muffled music echoed deep from the main hallway. Holy Harem, of course… It was Auggie… If I had to kill him, so be it.


“WITH A RATTLE AND A ROLL, THE KING TAKES CONTROL,

IN THE KRAZY KOURT OF THE KOBRA KING, ROCK AND VENOM FLOW!”


The element of surprise may have been lost, but I quietly slinked down the hallway. I’m not the strongest man out there, but I could definitely take Auggie McFalls… My best chance would be to quickly overpower him, I have reach and youth on my side… Though, if he was armed, that’s an entirely different story. I just have to find him.

Passing several different rooms, an escape was nowhere in sight. The music was growing louder and louder, until it led me to the source. A set of large double doors were slightly cracked, revealing a dim glow of light… The sanctuary… Keeping the mirror shard extended in front of me, I peered through to make sure he wasn’t lurking in a dark corner. Shaking, I entered through the gates of hell.

Barely lit, most of the medium sized sanctuary was wreathed in darkness. Something awful happened here… Old, weathered pews were hectically scattered all across the room. Large wooden crosses were set into the walls, littered in a thousand knicks and hateful gashes. Under a harsh light, a golden calf was placed on the center podium. Dozens of red-purple bottles surrounded the idol like some type of offering.

“Dear god…” I mouthed, not even being able to muster a whisper. 

I steadily made my way around the pulpit, with my heart falling with every creak of its derelict wood. A side door was open. It was the back room of the pulpit, fully lit, with the sound of Auggie humming along with the song inside.

Peeking around the door frame, I could never forget what I saw. An older woman, thin and gray, was strapped to a chair. Sickly yet beautiful, she looked like every labored gasp may be her last. Her arms were slit, oozing a deep crimson into dishes placed under her. Stained wine bottles filled rickety shelves, each filled to the brim with darkly colored vintages.

“A-A-AUGSSSSSTTTTT…” she croaked, every sound seasoned with pain.

Auggie, wearing nothing but a golden wreath upon his head and a leopard pelt draped on his shoulders, gently ran his fingers through her brittle hair. She weakly recoiled against his touch, only for him to place a single finger upon her mouth.

“Sh-sh-sh-sh, my beloved maenad… I only need a drop more… The Bull will give you strength, as you give us strength… You are one… We are one… We knew the price,” he said bitterly on the verge of tears.

Grabbing a wine bottle, he poured a few drops of the bowl’s contents into the deep purple liquid.

“I know you’re there, friend… There’s no need to be afraid, I bear you no ill will. Trust me, there is no running at this point. Come…” Auggie called, never turning to face me. 

“WHAT THE HELL IS THIS!” I sobbed through intense fits of gagging.

He turned to me with glassy eyes and a forced smile. “Beauty in a bottle…” he whispered.

“I-I’ll kill you, you goddamn monster! I’ll slit your fucking throat without a second thought!”

“Monster? No… Just a man in debt… Miracles cost a heavy sum and by the looks of it, you’ve been given an offer.” Auggie grimaced, flashing the razor blade concealed within his hand.

“W-W-WHAT IS GOING ON!” I screamed, all hopes of escape extinguished.

“Well the Bull sees beauty in all of us, but is especially drawn to the physically blessed… He thirsts for beauty and requires a chosen harvest… A harvest all of his followers may enjoy. You are not beautiful, friend, you cannot be a blessed maenad and thus you are in no danger by my hand. But you may partake and as one of the coin, you will partake…” 

“You’re deranged…”

“You know I saw you in a dream… Lysander thinks he’s the only one with visions… A fool, but the favorite fool… I saw a pale, sickly runt coming to my doorstep in need of help. Well, friend. The Bull can help, at a price… He can give you anything you desire: youth, wealth, a new wife… Hell, he can give you a thousand wives, it doesn’t matter. His power is absolute yet you must repay your coin…” it didn’t feel as if I was talking to Auggie McFalls, but rather evil given flesh.

“What did you say…”

“Your whore wife brings you nothing but suffering, the Bull can give you everyth-“ I lunged at him with the shard in hand and every intention to kill him in my heart. I was set in a murderous daze; a frenzy of tears and clumsy slashes. Every moment spent with Miranda: every laugh, every cry, every kiss was a stab aimed at his throat. His arrogance fading, Auggie did his best to evade the jagged edge in a clunky panic. In a state of fight or flight, Auggie responded with heavy swipes of his razor blade.

Fat and awkward, Auggie wasn’t nearly as quick as he hoped- sustaining several cuts to his forearms. Aiming for his exposed neck, I threw myself at him with the shard’s point. Stumbling to the side, Auggie evaded the killing blow by slamming himself into the full shelves. Collapsing under his weight, broken glass and wine now littered the floor.

I crashed into the old woman with a gruesome thud.  Her eyes were weak and confused, but almost grateful… A deep red now stained my hands; the shard was lodged deep into her throat.

Her icy blue eyes never left mine, gently grabbing onto my side with scrawny bound hands. Choking on the taste of death, she tried to speak through horrid gurgling. 

“LEAVE… DO… WHAT… I… COULDNT…” 

Her grip grew weak, as her writhing slowly stopped. It was quick, in her state, she couldn’t muster more than a few moments of life.

Auggie hobbled over to her, desperately trying to cover the wound with his bare hand. Wailing like a pig, Auggie rested his head on her bloodsoaked chest.

“You… You… You have no idea what you have done…” he squeaked, squeezing her hand longingly. Trembling, Auggie desperately looked around the room, scanning every recess in pure terror.

The music abruptly stopped… A powerful scent of incense filled the room, sweet and appalling. The adrenaline was immediately sucked from my body, turning me into a shivering mass of fear and mortality. We were not alone…

The sparse lights of the sanctuary burst one by one, bathing it in true darkness. The back room’s lighting began to flicker, before gaining the sickening golden hue…The sound of bare feet on wood rang out from the empty sanctuary, heavy slow steps that rocked me to my very core. From the darkness of the sanctuary, a shape contorted its massive form to slide through the door frame. 

It was like a Renaissance statue given flesh, tall and terrible. Its body was pale as marble, silken and smooth yet shimmered with sickly-sweet oils and gold dust. Intricately chiseled, every inch of its impressive body was teeming with muscle. Heavy rings engraved with unspeakable acts lined its massive arms, ending in cruel hands bearing gilded fingernails. It had no genitals, save for a large coin wound to its crotch by grapevines, embossed with the signet of a wailing hoplite. Between its impossibly broad shoulders, a single golden bull’s horn grew from its neck, taking the place of where a head should be. Long and sharply pointed, its head-horn was vulgarly engraved in acanthus vine, with gaudy incense burners dangling from its curve.

“W-what is that…” 

“An Inquisitor… Reaper sevenfold of broken deals…” Auggie choked, turning even paler than the figure. Ripping the bracelet free from his wrist, Auggie threw it at the thing’s feet. Turning into a stammering puddle of tears and urine, Auggie fell to his knees.

“I HAVE BEEN FAITHFUL TO THE BULL! I HAVE GIVEN AND GIVEN AND GIVEN! BUT I WILL GIVE MORE I PROMISE! I WILL GIVE TENFOLD! HUNDREDS! I WILL FIND ANOTHER, I-I-I JUST NEED MORE TIME! A DEAL CAN BE MADE! A DEAL CAN ALWAYS BE MADE!” Auggie shrieked, groveling before the thing. 

You can’t argue with the divine… Reaching out its hand, it caressed his cheek gently with its knuckle. With a lackadaisical flick of its wrist, the thing sent Auggie flying into a wall with a deafening crunch.  Its knuckles turned his face into a cave of splintered bone and bloody mush. It proceeded to tear his battered body into seven different pieces, before picking up his coin. Turning to me, it slowly walked backwards into the darkness as the light flickered back into its normal hue.

I stayed there for hours, not even moving an inch, trapped in a cage of every emotion possible. No thoughts were left after that. I don’t know exactly how or when, but I eventually left the sanctuary. Everything after that is a daze… I remember finding an exit but actually getting there is a blur. Seeing the light of day gave me no relief, no happiness, nothing. My car was gone and off in the distance, a dozen naked people were staring from the treeline. I slowly inched back into the inn… There is no escape…

Miranda, if you are reading this, I love you.
