Cold, Friday morning. About mid-august. I had just finished brewing a cup of coffee and was pouring it into the mug with the creamer when the fog-rain hit.  
  
It wasn’t instant. It came gradually, as most storms. Problem is, I was still in my house when it did hit. I groaned in frustration. I lived in an area with not the best drivers, so having the fog block my vision on the highway was going to be painful.  
  
As I grabbed my backpack and opened the door, I felt a strangely warm wind brush over me. I don’t remember why, but feeling that very brief burst of air hit my face put me in a state of unease. The rain here was supposed to be cold, right? Why did I just feel like I opened my dishwasher a little early?  
  
Regardless, I walked to my car.  
  
As I set down my things and opened my car door, I heard a strange creaking noise from the apartment entrance. Looking over, I saw my neighbor, Tom, standing in the doorway, staring at me. This was… odd. Today was Friday, which means Tom didn’t have work. I called to him, but there was no response. Eventually he turned to face the sky for a few moments, then walked back into the apartment. That was weird, I thought. Maybe he’s got a hangover or something. I’ll call him later.  
  
As I drove, I couldn’t help but notice that there were no drivers on the road (At least, that I noticed). Usually this early there’d be at least a couple truckers on the road, but… nothing. The entire highway was empty, the only sound being the rain pit-pattering against the windshield. As you can probably imagine, it was extremely unsettling, and the unpredictable and thick fog certainly didn’t ease my senses either. At some point I even flipped on my car’s broken radio just to hear something. While it would have been a little more comforting to hear the sound of voices, the white noise created by the static did just fine.  
  
Nothing could have prepared me for what happened when I pulled up to my office building. The place had been abandoned-- not destroyed, abandoned. Vines lined the building like cobwebs. Parts of the walls were torn away, the cars parked next to it were destroyed, and, just like everywhere else except my apartment, there was not a single soul in sight.  
  
I walked through the front door and took the stairs up to the suite. I was trying to pretend everything was normal, because, quite frankly, nothing about what was surrounding me was normal. As I walked up and opened the door, I couldn’t help but notice the walls. They were covered in warnings, bloody smears and scribbles warning any curious people to “Turn back!” and “It never ends!” and so on and so on. I’m not exactly sure who wrote these things, but whoever they are, they’re gone now.  
  
It was then I noticed the office. The first couple of rooms were normal, where everything was supposed to be. After that, nothing made sense. Desks were randomly shifted over, cubicles were missing walls, and, as I later realized, the rooms themselves were much bigger, almost non-euclidean. Like the space was now bigger on the inside.  
  
Eventually, I found my desk, riddled with rubble and fallen ceiling tiles. I cleared it up and started my computer, and as I did, I heard a crash! from my boss’s office. I instinctively stood, as I realized I hadn’t actually gone and visited my boss’s office. As I stood up and walked over, I noticed a sound coming from the room. It was muffled, almost like there was still something in there. The thought of my boss still being alive overthrew my instincts, and I rushed in and opened the door.  
  
Behind my boss’s desk was a thin, black figure about as tall as me. Its face was bearing a set of long, yellow, grotesque teeth, and its eyes popped right out of its head. It’s long, lanky arms were reaching onto the desk, presumably to grab whatever was there. It turned to face me, not moving a muscle whilst doing so.  
  
I froze.  
  
My immediate reaction was to run. But seeing how long that thing’s legs were, I knew it could easily outrun me, so running was out of the question. I could attack it, but considering it could also probably just slap me aside, that was pointless.  
  
Those were my options. What did I choose?  
  
Run. FAST.  
  
I flew out of the door, rushing towards the stairs. I could hear the creature running towards me, it’s long legs slamming against the already-unstable floor. As I approached the exit, it let out a screech so loud it deafened me for a few seconds. I flung open the stair doors, rushed down, pushed open the front door and…  
  
More offices.  
  
“It never ends.”  
  
This realization that this office building quite literally never ended drove me mad, and as I heard the creature screeching towards me, I grabbed a fallen pipe to defend myself. I knew not if I was going to survive this encounter, but I was damn well going to try. As the creature loomed over me, and its arm reached out towards me, I felt a sense of sorrow wash over. All these people and places and things I cared about, in the span of a few hours, had been wiped off the face of the planet, and I was left, alone, to fend off whoever the culprit was.  
  
That was the last thing I remember.  
  
Because afterwards, I woke up in a hospital bed.  
  
I type this to you now, in that hospital bed, as a warning. Uncanny valley is a very real place, and be warned-- you never know when you might end up there.
