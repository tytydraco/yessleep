I was nine when we found out that Grandpa had osteoporosis. He got a bone fracture from tripping on a carpet. Dad says it was obvious in hindsight from his waning stature and complaints of back pain. Mom didn’t want me to be prone, so from the time I was nine, she encouraged milk and dairy products to no end. She kept emphasizing how I needed calcium so my bones would be supple and strong so that I wouldn’t fall victim to the disease that thinned my eighty-year-old Grandpa’s bones. To Mom’s delight, consuming copious amounts of meat and dairy eventually became habit. I guess it must have worked, since I’ve never broken a bone. When I left for college, Mom feverishly embraced me and cried. As I carried the suitcases which she helped me pack to my car, I heard Mom going back inside. She came out a few minutes later, brandishing more unnecessary cargo. As she saw the vague frustration clouding me, she said 

“It’s better to overpack than underpack! You know, no matter how big you get, you’ll always be my little koala.” 

The freedom of college was new. I was a housecat, seeing the outside world for the first time, curious, overwhelmed, and a bit scared. I never went too far from home, though. I couldn’t, not with Mom’s calls, which were almost daily. I don’t know why she bothered calling when I fed her the same stories every day. My dorm is nice, my friends are nice, everything is nice. Anything less would have made her emotional. Anything more might prompt a visit, which I desperately avoided. 

I’m getting off topic. I had kept the habit of eating a surplus of meat and dairy, giving myself plenty of calcium so that I wouldn’t get osteoporosis like Grandpa. It was last year, my second year of college, when it became a problem. 

Have you ever seen a piercing reject? The implanted metal slowly starts pushing itself out. The skin above becomes thinner and thinner, and eventually, you can see the piercing bar below, a dark, convoluted mass under delicate skin. After a while, there is only a thin strip of flesh left, holding onto the piercing by less than a thread. Eventually the skin snaps, the piercing falls off, and a thick scar is all that’s left. That’s how it started. At first, I didn’t even notice, my forearm was just itchy. A couple of days later, I saw something long and light below inside my arm. As it progressed, I began to see a clear outline, it was long, white, the length of my entire forearm. My skin bulged and swelled to accommodate it, and it began to look like an overinflated balloon. I scheduled a Doctor’s appointment, the soonest one available was next week. Halfway through the week, bone broke through the surface of my skin. 

The strangest thing is that it wasn’t painful at all. A bit itchy, especially around the place where the bone protruded, but besides that, it felt normal. Once it broke the surface of my skin, it started rejecting faster. By the end of the week, it was completely outside of me. I brought the creamy yellow bone to the Doctor’s office and revealed the dark red scar on my forearm, but according to the X-ray, no bones were missing. I just had an extra ulna, which my body had rejected, for some reason. There were a couple more appointments, a couple of tests run on me, but nothing really happened. I was fine. 

Of course, I told none of this to Mom. If I did she would threaten to visit, to make sure her little koala is alright, and she would demand a tour and introduction to my friends. She would fuss and jump all over me. I’d rather reject a dozen more bones than have that happen. And I guess I will. 

The next bone was my left femur. Again, just itchy, then something light, then my skin started to expand and bulge. It looked almost cartoonish, like when Wile E. Coyote got hit on the head, except instead of one sharp bump, it was the entire length of my thigh. It was hard to wear pants, especially when the bone broke surface. This time it started in the center. Just a white spot, with scarred, discolored skin hugging it on all sides. With time, skin drew back, like a receding tide. Eventually my femur broke free, and again, all that was left was a long, dark, red scar on the outer side of my thigh. There was obviously still a bone inside of me, I could still stand and walk regularly. I thought I had an extra femur too. I didn’t even bother going to the doctor that time. 

So far I’ve lost an ulna, a femur, a thoracic and lumbar vertebrae, several phalanges from my hands and feet, and several teeth. They are in a shoebox in my dorm, under my bed. They rattle when I move the box. 

I’ve been trying to cut down on dairy. My theory is that I’m consuming so much calcium that my body is making more bones, then it has nowhere to put them, so it rejects them. It’s probably incorrect. I’ll update you in a couple of months. Right now I think one of my ribs is starting to reject.
