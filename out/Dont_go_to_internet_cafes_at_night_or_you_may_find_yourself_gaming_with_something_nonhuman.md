Internet cafes were a core memory of my teenage years. In the early 2000s, home computers were a luxury rarely seen in Southeast Asian households, especially those in rural areas like mine. Fortunately, an old engineer in my hometown caught on with the demand and set up an internet cafe from bits and pieces of hardware he scavenged from work. 

Those computers were barely functional, but the place was all the rage for us curious teenagers. My friend group spent hours every day haunting the cafe, hosting LAN parties for Warcraft or Half-Life. The internet cafe was our secret hideout, our castle of dreams, where we lived out youthful days in fantasy worlds free of responsibilities.

Fast forward a few years, and internet cafes slowly faded into obscurity as PCs, smartphones, and wifi became widely available. The internet cafe was soon shut down, and most of us left for work or university. We tried keeping in contact at first, but life got in the way, making it too busy for us ever to see each other. That was, until one of my friends was found dead.

A few months ago, I received a call from my friend’s mom. “Nam is dead,” she said. “He got drunk, tripped, and fell into the river one night. No one found him until it was too late.” I was devastated and overwhelmed by guilt. Nam used to be my closest friend in the group, yet I haven’t called him once all those years. I wish to spend one more night playing games with him like in the good old days, or at least say a proper goodbye, yet it’s already too late. 

I immediately went back to our hometown for Nam’s funeral. The entire group was present, but most left right after the ceremony. I was the last one to stay, helping out Nam’s family. That was the least I could do after neglecting our friendship for so long. I was bitter toward others for not staying longer, but to be fair, I can’t really blame them for prioritizing their life over an old friend’s death. 

That night, after a dinner with Nam’s parents, I left with an empty, sorrowful heart. The bus wouldn’t arrive until the next morning, and with nothing better to do, I decided to take a stroll. Perhaps a quick nostalgia tour around town would lighten my mood. I visited our high school, which was already closed for the night. I tried some fast food stands we used to love, but they were also closed. “This is why I moved to the city, nothing in this shit hole of a town opens past 7 p.m!” I mumbled to myself in frustration.

I almost gave up and called it a night before stumbling upon an internet cafe. It was an old, shabby one-story house with an “internet cafe” banner so torn I couldn’t even read its name. Still, the front door is wide open, revealing two rows of PCs inside, with three guests playing at the time, so I knew it hadn’t closed yet. “No better way to honor Nam’s memory than a gaming night, eh?” I thought to myself and walked in.

The receptionist was a sleepy old man who didn’t bother responding to me, except for a slight nod when receiving my bill. Inside, the cafe seemed even more run-down, with the PCs looking like they had endured two world wars. Funnily enough, this shabbiness reminded me of the old engineer’s internet cafe, which made the nostalgia hit even harder.       
Among the guests, two were foreigners, sleeping soundly with music videos on their screens. The third one was a teenage boy sitting in the corner, hooked into his video games. Seeing a kid outside this late isn’t something rare, as I also sneaked out at night from time to time back in the day. But the game he was playing, StarCraft Brood War, seemed a bit too old for his age.

I picked a PC and sat down. As expected, this ancient relic didn’t have any of the newer games - no Fortnite, no PUBG, hell, not even League or Minecraft. There were only four games: GTA: San Andreas, Half-Life, Warcraft, and StarCraft. I tried connecting to the internet, but these games had been modified to local only, so I could only play with bots. I tried fooling myself into having fun gunning down NPCs in San Andreas, but to no avail. I didn’t miss these stupid games. I missed having friends around, playing together, yelling at each other.

As I lost in thought, a goosebump suddenly hit my neck. I turned around to see the kid in the corner, now standing behind me with an unnaturally wide grin on his face. “You want to play together? I’m looking for a friend to play Dota with!” He asked enthusiastically.

“Uh, yeah, sure…” I was a little spooked but quickly recalmed myself and agreed. “He is just a weird kid looking for someone to play with,” I thought to myself. “Maybe partying with him will give me that nostalgic feeling I’m looking for.”

For those of you who don’t know, Dota is a 5v5 player-made custom map of Warcraft 3 in which you control a hero fighting the opposing players and NPC monsters to destroy their base. This one was my absolute favorite. I invited the kid to the lobby, and his user name gave me a good chuckle. “D3vil69420? What a classic name for an emo teen.”

Since there were only two of us, we added four bots on each side to make the match feel more authentic. I noticed blurry images of real people replaced the hero portraits of those bots. “It’s probably just some homebrew mod to make bot matches feel less empty,” I reassured myself. 

D3vil69420 picked Terrorblade (TB), an illusion-summoning hero, while I picked Legion Commander (LC), a hero best suited for 1v1. We started trading blows, and his TB got the first kill. “Too easy, noobie!” The kid shouted, startling me. I was worried about other guests, but they still slept soundly, so I jokingly trash-talked back. After a few rounds of combat, I got hooked to the point of forgetting my surroundings. We kept fighting and yelling back and forth, as if I had gone back in time to LAN party with my old friends. 

It wasn't until I won the game that I realized the sleeping guests had woken up. Two new men had also entered the cafe when I didn’t notice. For a brief second, I could feel everyone in the cafe staring at me blankly. As if noticing my concern, all of them suddenly burst into laughter and clapped their hands, congratulating me on a good game.   

“Don’t think you have won yet, noob. This is a best-of-three match, and I will crush you in the remaining game!” The kid said, half-jokingly, half-sulkily. 
“Hold on, I never agreed to that! It’s already late, you should go home. Your parent must be worried sick!” I tried to sound responsible. Besides, the other guests were giving me the creeps.
       
“But we’re having so much fun! It has been ages since I last played against other people. You know how hard it is to find people playing games like these, right? And you don’t have to worry about other guests. They’d love to cheer us on. Come on, it’ll be a good time, I promise! Just like the good old days! Please! Pretty please!” D3vil69420 begged.

Anyone in their right mind would have realized something was off, but I didn’t. I still don’t know if it was hypnosis, magic, or some kind of airborne drug, but a sense of euphoric nostalgia clouded my consciousness, making me stay. It was the same feeling as when you decide to play one more game before bed, knowing full well of the consequences that would come tomorrow morning.

“Great, game on!” The kid replied enthusiastically. “Oh, by the way, should we add a small bet to our little game? The loser shall give the winner of this Bo3 something. That would make the competition so much more exciting, don’t you think?” His voice shifted into a much more sinister tone.

At the moment, I thought the kid just wanted a free soda or something, so I agreed. “Alright, but we play by my rules! Back in my day, the winner of each match earned a portion of the reward immediately, and then the complete prize after winning the entire Bo3. What do you say?”

D3vil69420 laughed out loud. “Deal!” He said. “So what will your first reward be?”

As an adult, I couldn’t really demand anything of that kid. Thus, I came up with a lame, cheesy one-liner: “I want to play with my old friend, like back in the day!”

The kid didn’t react to that silly request, and we entered the lobby for our second game. It was the same lineup as the last match, with me, D3vil69420, and eight bots. This time, however, there was a bot named Handsomeboy97 on my side, which was the exact user name Nam used when we still played together. “What a coincidence!” I thought to myself.

“The second game began. I picked Huskar, a hero who gains strength on low health, D3vil69420 picked Doom, a hero famous for disabling opponents’ skills and items, and Handsomeboy97 picked Dazzle, a support with death-delaying ability. Handsomeboy97 played really well for a bot. He kept healing me just like Nam used to do in our games. However, every once in a while, he frantically pinged me to retreat, even when I’m not in any danger.

You’d think I’m crazy, but I swear every time Handsomeboy97 healed me in-game, my real mind got a bit clearer. I started observing our audience, which had increased to seven guests. There was absolutely no way this obscure internet cafe got so many customers this time of night, so I immediately thought they were going to rob me. Fortunately, they only stood still, staring blankly at my screen. But then, something hit me. The guests looked exactly like the portraits of bot players in our game, all seven of them. 
“What kind of twisted joke is this? Are they all regulars of this cafe trolling me? There are seven of them, but what about the last one? What about Handsomeboy97…”

My thought was interrupted when I noticed a new figure who seemed to have materialized out of thin air behind D3vil69420. Darkness covered his face, but in my heart, I already knew who to expect. Still, as that person stepped into the light, I immediately broke down and threw up on the spot upon seeing the pale face of Nam, the friend I had just buried in the morning. Overwhelmed by fury and disgust, I slammed the table while standing up, yelling: “What the fuck is this!” at the kid. Or at least that was what I would have done if I could have moved.   

It wasn't until then that I realized my body was glued to the gaming chair. I could move my head just fine, but every muscle from the neck down wouldn’t listen to my command. When I tried moving my hand or leg, the only thing that moved was the on-screen mouse or my in-game hero.

“Haiz, so you have noticed the unique quality of our game.” D3vil69420 sighed. “Perhaps your first reward was too generous.”

“What the fuck is this, you sick fuck! What did you do to Nam’s corpse?”

“You see, Mr. Nam has agreed to a game not so different from our current one. I was the victor, thus attaining the prize of his very soul. But that was a story of the past, and I highly suggest you focus on the present.” D3vil69420 explained with a smirk.

Shocked by everything going on, I hadn’t moved my hero for a while, thus giving the enemy Doom a considerable lead. Capitalizing on his advantage, the kid, or whatever he is, quickly pushed and destroyed my base, winning the second game. As my castle exploded, a sharp pain hit my brain, as if someone was piercing through my skull with a chisel.    
 
“Time to collect my first reward!” D3vil69420 cheerfully brushed his hands, as if preparing for a meal. “Let's see, what should I take first? I won’t be too greedy, not yet! Hmm, ah, how about the memories of your high school friends? You seem to cherish them the most, don’t you?”

My headache intensified as I felt parts of my brain sucked out by an invisible syringe. The memories of my old friends, their names, their faces, the things we did together flashed through my mind before disappearing forever, all of them except Nam’s. The pain was unbearable, but I used every last ounce of willpower to stay awake in fear of what this devil could do if I passed out.

After what felt like an eternity, D3vil69420 was finally satisfied. I entered the third game half unconscious. Handsomeboy97 was on the other team this time. Perhaps the devil didn’t want any more shenanigans from us, or maybe Nam just tried to drag me to hell himself. The entity picked Shadow Fiend (SF), a hero that collects souls from fallen enemies to gain power. I randomly chose Anti Mage (AM), a hero strong against magic damage. Lastly, Nam locked in on Magnus, a crown control hero. 

The game was a bloodbath. Overwhelmed by agony, dread, and sorrow, I could barely control my hero, let alone come up with a winning strategy. D3vil69420 slaughtered me left and right, and each time he killed me in-game, I experienced the same physical wound on my real body. Handsomeboy97 didn’t bother going after me. He just hung around the bottom corner of the map, chopping trees or whatever.     

I gave up. I would never beat that devil, so what was the point of trying anyway? I spent the last few moments of my life before eternal damnation trying to think of any good memories, but it seemed D3vil69420 had taken them all. “Oh well, at least I still have memories of Nam,” I thought to myself. “Memories of the times we spent grinding Dota, discovering every cheat and glitch… Wait! Glitch! The one in the corner of the map!”

I awoke from self-pitiness and understood what Nam had been trying to do. As SF pushed on to my base, I abandoned everything and ran toward where Magnus was. Nam’s hero got a skill that pushes his enemy for a short distance. If you stand at the map’s edge, the skill can basically move you out of bounds. We discovered this glitch together back when there was still no internet to guide us. It served no gameplay purpose, but in this situation, the bug might be my only hope.

Nam had already waited for me at that exact spot. With Magus’ skill, my AM flew past the boundary, disappeared from the map, which also freed me in real life. I ran, as fast and far as I could, and didn’t stop until the sun shone brightly in the sky.

I went back to the city at once. My body sustained severe physical wounds, taking months to recover. The mental trauma, however, is permanent. I asked everyone I hadn’t forgotten about the internet cafe and the incident, but no one knew of that cafe, and they just assumed I got robbed.

I stayed off any electronic devices for a while. However, yesterday, I returned to work and had to use my laptop again. As soon as I booted it up, I received an email from an unknown sender that terrified me.

“Come back, finish our match! Nam is still waiting =)))”
