I was scrolling aimlessly when I saw the posting.  GET PAID TO PLAY GAMES. 
The picture was of a generic government style capital building with a person holding a controller in front. That’s what made me click it. It seemed so absurd and out there, I was mildly curious. 

I browsed the application and then scrolled to the pay rate. $150/hr PLUS BONUS. 

No way, I thought. That’s too good to be true. But I looked up at the address bar and the website had a .gov address. Aren’t those supposed to be like, super legit? I poked around researching the company too. It was [redacted], located in [redacted], which was actually not far away. 

I was so sick of my minimum wage job at a local supermarket that I decided, well, what the hell, let me apply. 
Within minutes, the application was on its way through. I’ll admit there was some questionable attributes to the app. For starters, they asked if I was a renter and if I could break the lease. They also asked about being in school. Fortunately for me, I took a semester off, and I was staying with my parents 

Some of these sketchy jobs reply within minutes. This one? This one took 3 days. 
I applied on a Monday and Thursday rolled around with an invitation sitting in my inbox. 
“You’re invited to an open interview.” It read. A doctor James Holand was the author of the email, according to the signature. The email gave a brief description, summarizing what we would be doing. The government has some new aircraft that they’re developing and want to test. They want to make the aircraft as easy as possible to pilot; drone style. So they’re enlisting the help of controllers, of video games, in order to successfully test the aircraft. 

It sounded like it was a simulated version of earth, where you have to navigate from point A to point B and complete objectives along the way. 

Even now it did feel good to be true, but on the following Friday I found myself driving over to the facility. It was smack dab in the middle of the city and looked like a generic office building. It was hardly the government style building from the ad, but whatever. 

I wasn’t the last to arrive, thankfully. There were 2 boys and a girl already there. I nodded politely in their direction. 

The room itself had plain white walls with high ceiling. There was one of those clocks you find in schools, black with a white face, probably stolen from some high school math teachers room. Modern art was displayed on the wall next to it, the artist splashing dulled down colors and mixing them together to create an intricate, modern design. 
In contrast, next to it was a poster that had a cartoon alien figure in a UFO style ship, with a man in a black suit and sunglasses pointing a finger at you. “WE NEED YOU”, it read, because of course it did. 

Black metal chairs, the uncomfortable kind, were lined up neatly in the middle of the room. In front of them was a projector screen standing strong against the wall. 

A bored looking staff member handed me a stack of papers, along with a cheesy “Hello my name is..” name tag with a pen.  I proceeded to scrawl my name on the tag and stuck it on my shirt. “Raya” it read, proudly against my generic white blouse I threw on trying to look presentable. 

The girl’s tag read “Gabby”. She had long blonde hair with pretty blue eyes and was wearing  blue dress that highlighted all the right features. She carried a purse that looked like one of those fancy brands that everyone was obsessed with. 

“Davon” was already sitting. Next to enter was Arjan, Saif and Brooklyn. 
Davon had on glasses, wearing a sports jersey for a nearby rival state. He smiled in my direction, and his smile contrasted nicely against his dark skin. 

Arjan was a shorter, tan guy, sporting a delicately shaved beard and mustache. He sat down next to the two other guys. 

Saif entered the room, looked around quickly before plopping himself in a chair next to me. He had a black full beard and mustache combo, sporting a blue long sleeve shirt with glasses hooked on it. 

Aran entered next. He was a surfer type, sporting blonde hair and ocean blue eyes. He looked like he just came from the beach, dressed in a Hawaiian shirt. He took the name tag and scrawled his name, then he looked up at the employee who was trying to give him the paper stack. He took it from her hand, thumbing through the stack, before finally taking a seat. 

Brooklyn entered the room, ducking her head and surveying the group. She spotted me and set herself up in the other seat next to me. 

The last one to enter was Brian. Brian looked like a typical scrawny gamer, glasses, a look of boredom on his face. 
He initially dismissed the stack of papers from the employee, before rudely snatching them from her grasp before plopping himself into a seat on the far end. 

Silence followed except for the ticking of the damn clock. Tick tick tick. 
On the eleventh set of ticks, another person walked in. He was tall, with pale skin, dark brown hair, and stern blue eyes. He had a lab coat on, with a blue shirt that read [redacted] underneath. 
James Holland, his tag read. He must’ve been the one from the email if he was important enough to omit the “Hello my name is” and include a last name, I thought to myself. 

“Good morning folks.” He addressed the room with a wave. “I’m here to tell you about this exciting opportunity.”
The next hour was those generic slideshows, starting with the company name, what they do, and how they came to be. 

Too many ticks of the clock later, a slide popped up sporting “what you’ll do”, and it felt like the whole room sat up in their chairs. 

“You will be our test pilots, so to speak.” James stated. “The aircraft we want to test are highly intricate with many special engineering functions, but we want to make sure our pilots have an easy experience when it comes down to it. That’s all I can say before you all sign the NDAs, but a word of caution.”

He paused dramatically, surveying the room. “The pay here is great. But if you don’t want to put the time and energy in to get to that level, please feel free to dismiss yourselves.” He gestured to the door. 

Silence followed for a few ticks before he continued. 

“You’ll have to undergo a physical and mental health assessment to ensure you are fit for the training.” James nodded in the direction of a separate set of double doors tucked on the other side of the room. 

“But on a high note, you’ll be provided adequate housing if you so choose to accept this position. Free, with personal bathrooms, a television, the works. You’ll even be provided clothes to live in for your duration here.”

James tapped a button on his little presentation remote, shutting off the screen. 

“If you could all please review the forms in front of you, fill out, and sign, we can get started.” 

The sound of a dozen pages turning at once joined the clocks ticking as everyone scrambled to find their forms. 

“Also to note, you will only get the evening for cell phone usage per day. Your work hours will be spent in the office most of your duration here.” 
I quickly caught onto the way he said “office”. It had a hint of nervousness, with his tone a little higher pitched. But I dismissed it after a second, hoping it was okay. 

“The final note is that you won’t be able to leave upon completing these papers and the physical examination. You’ll be able to return to your homes come end of the month.” James added quickly. 

Surfer guy, whose name I already forgot, stood up and jerked his chair back. “Fuck that! I have plans, man. All this bs book work and shit, I’m out.” He smacked his papers down on the chair behind him, stomping towards the doors and slamming it after him. 

I wish now that I had joined him.

The news blared on a television screen, sharing info about someone getting charged for counterfeiting laundry products, or something. I quickly looked away, turning my attention back to the waiting room door, anxiously awaiting my turn. 

Finally the doors opened, letting a quiet Saif exit, looking at the ground. The nurse peered at the clipboard, her brow furrowing as she read. “Miss Thomas?” She said finally, sounding defeated. 

Standing up, without missing a beat, I strode to her. “It’s Reya.” I told her quietly as we entered the doors, knowing she was struggling with my name. 

“Thank you, Miss Reya. This way, please.” She said softly as the news cast drone on in the background, as the clock continued to tick. 

Laying in bed, typing this out, I can’t say I remember anything that happened in that room. I know they did a generic evaluation and drew some blood. But she also ended up giving me a shot, and I can’t remember what it was for. I felt hesitant at first, but all I could think about was how this money was going to pay for college. 

I thought back quickly to finding my room and entering it for the first time. The room itself was hotel style, with a full size bed sporting (surprisingly) flowery bedding.  The bathroom was stocked with soap, shampoo, towels. Everything you’d need, just like they said. 

Outside the rooms, there was a generic hallway, white with florescent lights lining the ceiling. At the end of the hallway was a set of thick gray doors. That is where we would go in the morning, the staff member leading me to my room informed me. That’s where you’ll be working for the next few weeks. It loomed with anticipation as I had turned around and headed back to the room, as if it knew exactly what secrets we were about to get ourselves into. 

I’m going to update soon as to what exactly this job entails. My head hurts, and we have to be up at 6am tomorrow.
