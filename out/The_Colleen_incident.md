You would hear a ukulele playing, no words but the tune of the “toxic gossip train” song she sang for her apology. If you do hear this, and you look out a window, you will see it. However, it does not look like a normal person. Its arms will be outstretched, it’s eyes, wide open. Smiling ear to ear. If it doesn’t notice you, lock your doors and windows if you haven’t done so already. Cover them up and go back to sleep. It will get louder. And louder. Ignore and go to sleep, it will be fine in the morning. However, if it does notice you, you have to be quick, lock your windows and doors, and hide in a closet or somewhere hidden. It will try to get in, if it doesn’t, stay there til morning. If it does get in, don’t bother calling the police. They say they are coming, but every victim by this entity has died. If she comes into the room you are in, it will sing the “toxic gossip train” song. Hold your breath and don’t make a sound or move. If you do and it hears, you better pray to what ever god you believe in that it doesn’t know where you are. 

This however, is not the only situation that happens. There were other instances where it will just come into your house. If you can, you can hide and hope she leaves. If it does, you’re safe. if it doesn’t leave, just stay in the spot you’re in, if it comes into the same room as you, so move, don’t make any sound, don’t even breathe. It will hear you. 
Sometimes, on rare occasions, if you are unlucky enough, it can follow you home late at night. This following story was submitted from a neighbor who witnessed most of the event, who was not spotted from this entity. 

“I was just watching TV when I heard a faint scream. I was startled of course, it was like 1 AM in the morning? I went up to the window to see what had happened, My front porch light was on, so I could see easily. I made out the features and I finally realized, There was a mangled body of my next door neighbor Lizzie on the sidewalk. I watched in horror as I watched her body twitch, blood splurging out of her ragged slash marks, her blonde hair tangled and covered in blood, her joints all dislocated and brutally broken, and her face. Her face was the worst, her face was covered in blood, no, not blood, her entire face was caved in, basically a bunch of mush of blood and pieces of her face.”

“Right next to her, was that Colleen entity, it’s back was faced towards me, arms all the down to her knees, her hair, ragged and messy. It picked up its ukulele, and started singing that song. A song that I will never be able to get out of my head. The toxic gossip train. I watched as it played that damn song, sounding like she was struggling to breathe, wheezing and echoing loud enough to where I thought it would wake up at least a few people in the neighborhood. I watched as it dragged Lizzies body down an ally way, disappearing into the darkness. I will never be able to get this event out of my head. It will forever be in there. No matter how much I try. She was a very dear friend of mine, and I’m just scared. Scared that it probably somehow saw me, scared that it will come back and finish its job, scared that it will come for possibly my family or even more of my friends. I wish that I had gone to bed earlier, so that I didn’t have to witness it. I wish that Lizzie hadn’t gone out drinking with her friends that night, I wish she had gotten an Uber and got a ride home. and I wish that she was still here.”
