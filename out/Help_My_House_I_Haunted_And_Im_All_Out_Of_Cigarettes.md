This isn't the first time I've been on this particular part of Reddit, and I don't think it'll be the last time either. I've read some of your experiences, and I think it's time I shared mine. As things are starting to ramp up here, I believe this is the best time for it. So, I must encourage you all to keep an open mind like I have, and I'll get started.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's currently around 1 in the morning and I'm still awake, still hearing that damn robotic chirping of that *bloody* alarm clock. It's been going on and off for around an hour now and I'm starting to think it may be because of what's been happening to not just me, but my family as well. I'll try and start this 'tale' or whatever from the first thing that happened, at the start of the week. Remember, keep an open mind.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This all began on Monday the 25th of November 2024. 

I'd been up all night playing games on my old (still feels strange to say that) Xbox One, and I'd come downstairs to the kitchen to grab something to eat. It was around six or seven in the morning? My mother was sitting on the small kitchen island looking at something on her tablet, probably playing some form of Candy Crush or something. It was dark, and the back door was open; she'd probably let one of the cats out to piss.

I said good morning, and she replied in that same old groggy tone she'd always had in the mornings as I opened the fridge and looked for the milk and take-out leftovers from last night. After heating up some egg-fried rice and pouring myself a glass of milk in one of the small shot glasses we kept in the whine cupboard in the pantry, I walked back into the kitchen and started towards the entryway.

I heard my mother call my name so I spun around and poked my head back into the kitchen. She then asked me if I'd been drawing on any of the windows downstairs; they'd all been fogged up thanks to the cold weather and she knew *very well* I liked to doodle on the bathroom mirror after taking a shower. I'd written the word 'REDRUM' on many occasions in fact; we both love Stephen King.    

I told her no (honest), and she told me to go and look at the window on the open back door. I did and gently pushed it closed as the cat had finally came back in after it had done it's business outside. There, just barely visible on the foggy glass in the dull morning light was the number, or as my mind intercepted at the time, the year:

*1975*

Mom then asked me again if I was sure I didn't scribble that on there. And, again I told her no . . . and that was that. I retreated upstairs and returned to the game at hand while munching down on warm leftovers.

A few hours later, my mom got my little brother up and ready for school and she stuck her head into my room saying she'd see me after work.

I spent the rest of the day just gaming, occasionally smoking out of my bedroom window, and doodling on an app on my phone.

It had to be around 10. AM when I fell asleep, I was still tired after a long night of munching on chips and playing GTA and Minecraft. I think my body just forced me into a deep slumber. When I woke up I could hear a scratching sound coming from out in the hallway beyond my bedroom door; that might have been what woke me in the first place. I checked my phone; 1:56.PM.

When I looked out into the hallway I saw the cat, the same one from this morning (the one who liked to piss on everyone's beds). He was scratching at the small, two-door wooden closet in the hallway on the wall to the left. I could hear the boiler rumbling from inside it, we also kept all of our winter boots and hats in there. His tale was laying flat on the carpet behind him and he was poking and prodding at the closet doors; like he did with the back door when he wanted to go out and piss.

I made a '*psps'* sound to try and coax him towards me. But when it finally registered in his little cat brain that I was trying to speak to him . . . he bolted and ran down the stairs, like he saw me as a hungry Pitbull or something.

Strange. But he was the type of cat that lived up to the term 'pussycat' as he had been petrified by all of us when we first got him. So, I brushed it off and went back to sleep, still feeling exhausted.

Later that night, around nine or ten PM, I joined my mom on the sofa in the darkened living room; the faint glow of a string of fairy lights that hung above the fireplace mantle was our only source of light, Apart from the blaring TV near the front windows. We were watching one of those true crime docs. A few commercials began to play and we talked for a bit. She told me about work and I told her what I'd been doing whilst she and my little brother were out of the house. It was then that she brought up the number we'd both seen drawn on the glass of the backdoor this morning.

"It's an angle's number, Jude . ." She said in a rather poetic tone.

My mother has always been open to those kinds of things; like a hand is guiding us in life, or that karma is real. Even though she's an atheist and sometimes looks down on certain types of religions, saying that they can make people do horrible things . . . she still believes that there's something more that we are not seeing.  

"I looked up what it meant and it said," She paused, picking up her phone from the small coffee table in front of us. "Wait a minute."

I could see she was scrolling, the bright white glow was illuminating the heavy bags under her eyes; they were always there, they had always been there I think.

"Ah, come. Look here!" She says.

I scoot over to her and peer down at whatever website she was looking at. There was just a wall of text, and at the top of the page the words '*ANGEL NUMBER 1975'* In big pink letters.

"The number 1-9-7-5 is made up of energies and vibrations of number 1 and number 9, and the influences and attributes of number 7 and number 5."

I'd give her an 'ok?' look, not knowing where she was going with all this. But, this was like her. I mean, she did one time think the ghost of her father (my grandfather) was trying to communicate with her because she thought she saw his face in a piece of toast.

I nodded at her, wanting her to continue.

"Number 1 brings courage, willpower ambition, and new beginnings. Number 9 denotes endings and conclusions and relates to the universal spiritual laws, a higher power, and karma. Number 7 encourages spiritual enlightenment and awakening. And number 5 promotes personal freedom, major life changes, and life lessons learned through experiences?"  

She gave me a warm smile and a look that said 'oh would you look at that?', before continuing down the wall of text. She read the rest in her head as I sank back into my corner of the sofa, smiling to myself. She did tend to believe everything she read on the internet, even though she told me *never* to do the same.

A few commercial breaks later, and the ending of our crime doc, I went upstairs. I was still feeling the consequences from my all-nighter as my head hit the pillow

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nothing happened on Tuesday. When I came downstairs around lunchtime to feed the cats, out of curiosity I checked the window on the back door; nothing. The 'angel number of 1975' was gone. And, that would've been the end of all that . . . if it wasn't for what happened on Wednesday that is.

I'd stayed up all night again on Tuesday, so during all day on Wednesday I was practically forcing myself to stay awake. Normally I would've just taken a nap (of about 6 hours) but I had just ordered McDonald's on Just Eat and I didn't want to miss the delivery guy as my mother had gone to sleep on the sofa; she had a particularly long day at the office, she answers the phones in the complaints department. And my little brother was in the middle of an intense gaming session across the hallway in his room.

It was around six or seven at night when . . . black . . . the power had kicked off. I'd been watching old YouTube uploads of Top Gear episodes (the good Top Gear, not whatever was still airing) on my TV. That was off and so was my bedside lamp; everything was completely black . . . and deathly quiet.   

I heard my little brother mumble a few cuss words as I got up, feeling in a daze as I was still *very* sleep deprived (my fault, my sleep schedule has always been fucked). I poked my head out of my bedroom door and gazed into the dark, inky blackness that was the upstairs hallway. I let my eyes adjust to the darkness for a moment . . . that was when I saw a small blacker-than-night shape on the floor next to where the double closet doors were on the left. It was only when I saw his green-tinted eyes shine softly toward me I realized it was my cat; he was poking and prodding at the closet again like he had been doing on Monday.

Everything felt off . . like I was in a dream of sorts. Of course, it was just because I was in need of a long slumber but . . . with all of the lights being off . . . I was on edge and a bit jumpy.

Again, as I did on Monday, I made a '*psps' s*ound, trying to get my jumpy cat's attention. And, just like before, he took off running; although I could only hear his scampering pours darting across the carpet and could see literally nothing!

But, that was when one of the closet doors began to slowly (and I mean *very* slowly) open, like there was the smallest gust of wind that was pushing it open. There was something in there, I think I knew that as soon as it had begun to open. All those horror movies I'd watched growing up, all of those King books I've read and spoken about with my mother, they all came flooding into my mind, making me picture all types of horrific monsters and masked men.

And, when the closet door finally stopped, now fully opened, the shape of a man's head poked out from within. It was completely jet-black, no facial features, no nothing! Just jet fucking black . . .  but it was soo damn obvious  that it was someone's head!

I froze, as cliche as that sounds I fucking froze. There was a part of me that wanted to bolt past 'it' and charge downstairs. And a stupid part of me (the part of every stupid horror movie character that I liked to shit on soo much) that wanted to see what 'it' really was.

HE was looking right at me . . . right into me . . . I could feel his eyes ,or lack thereof, glaring into mine. Then. In a long, cold, low drawn out breath 'it' spoke to me . . .

"J . . . D . . ."

I lost it. I screamed. I ran straight across the hallway, barding into my little brother's room, he was craned over his PC with a pissed-off expression; the power cut had probably cut off the WI-FI. He jumped a mile when he saw me enter. I spun around and fell back first against the corner of his desk; it hurt like a bitch. Then, he began to scream; out of confusion more than terror I assume . . . the power kicked back on. Lights flickered to life, his monitor beamed brightly and the sound of the TV in my room echoed down the hallway . . . which was where I was glaring wide-eyed. The closet was shut . . . and HE was gone . . . like the blackness of the power cut had taken him with it when everything came back on.

"*Guys!, Guys is everything ok?*" My mom's voice boomed from down below.

The look on my little brother's face . . . that's what got to me as much as what I saw coming out of that closet. His eyes were wide and his hair was messy and sticking up; like a cat's fur does when it feels threatened. He was breathing heavily, I could tell his little heart was racing.

"Are you o-ok?" He asked sheepishly, his bottom lip trembling.

"Yeah! . ." I scoffed, breathing heavily, faking a smile. My lungs felt like they'd burst at any moment as the fear had begun to dissipate. "Just scared of the dark I guess . ." I said stupidly, staring off to the left . . . eyeing the now dormant and deserted closet.

Mom came upstairs, asking what the heck was all that banging around. I told her I got spooked in the dark and fell over; which was technically what happened. My little brother seemed to agree.

I told myself what I saw was just my eyes playing tricks on me in the dark; I was lying obviously, I'm not that daft . . . as far as this situation goes anyway. I just told myself that just so I could fall asleep that night, letting the Big Mac grow cold and unwanted on my bedside table as my brother and mother continued doing whatever they had been before the power went off. Sleep did come for me, whether it was just because of all of the late nights I'd been having . . . or the encounter with the 'thing' from the closet had simply just exhausted me to the point where my body had just shut down.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This next event happened on Friday night, yesterday as I'm typing this up for you all now.

It was around 8 at night and I was doom-scrolling on TikTok, trying to keep my thoughts from venturing anywhere near 'him' or the closet. Mom had recently gotten a new alarm clock from eBay and I could hear her setting it up in the next room; her room.  My bedroom door was open, it felt safer that way as if 'it' came back I could simply dash to or call out for her.

I know, massive pussy, right?

I was shaken by a loud *CRASHing pop* from somewhere outside of my room, like glass breaking or something? . . . shortly followed by my mother yelping in fear. I shot up and started out into the hallway, paying the closest no mind; it was shut anyway. When I burst into her room I saw her standing up in fright, cowering in the corner with her arms held up to her face as if she was shielding herself from something.

I asked her what the hell was going on and what that sound was. And, she told me her bedside lamp had blown up, the glass bulb inside it had exploded, sending shards of glass everywhere. She told me she'd been sitting on the side of her bed fiddling with her new alarm clock, trying to get it to work when she heard and saw the small bulb inside of the lamp burst.

"Don't! . . stay there, there is glass everywhere!" She pleaded, gasping as she had already begun scooping small pieces of bulb from her bed sheets and carpet.

She later told me how lucky she was that none of those shards were sent straight into her eyes as she'd been only a few inches away from the lamp.

So that was it, just a faulty or old bulb finally giving out. If that was all that happened I would be asleep right now.

Nope.

The next thing that happened . . was the thing that disturbed me the most, the thing that compelled me to write this post.  

Satisfied that my mom wasn't in any real danger (for now at least) I had closed my door and was trying (forcing myself) to go to sleep. I was drenched with sweat and I could feel eyes on me . . . *His* eyes. I knew whatever 'he' was . . . he was watching me from somewhere in the dark corners of my room.

And, just as my body began to give out from what I guessed was pure terror and exhaustion . . . I felt the touch of long. Cold. Boney fingers grasp my back . .  if even just for a second . . . I knew they were real.

Of course, when I shot up and turned on my lamp; nothing . . . just my cat curled up on my desk chair, sleeping soundly like I wished to be.   

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have no fucking idea what to do anymore. I know something is here, in my home, trying to do something to me and my family. While I've been writing this I've checked out multiple paranormal websites to find out what this fucker is and what he wants. But I can't tell what is legit and what is just made-up BS from so-called 'experts' online. I've always suspected that there are ghosts or beings that we can't see but can feel around us, but never ones like this, never something like this!

I AM fully convinced this is something demonic. I can still hear that chirping alarm clock that my mom told me she'd fix in the morning. She told me it didn't work and she'd taken out the batteries. So, I guess I can add that to my short list of spooky shit I've experienced this week.  

So, *Please* . . . I ask you all. I've read some of your experiences . . . now read mine. And please, someone give me some damn answers.

And cigarettes, I've just smoked my last one.
