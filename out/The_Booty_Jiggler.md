It started as a joke- just a meme passed around late at night. People would share grainy, VHS quality clips of a shadowy figure in a dimly lit room. The figure was unmistakably: a tall, wiry man wearing a tattered hoodie and sweatpants two sizes too small. His face was obscured, but his movements were eerily fluid. The man would start twerking- yes twerking- but in a way that was wrong. His motions were too smooth, almost inhuman. His hips defied the laws of physics bending and twisting like liquid.

The captions were always something dumb like: 
"He’s coming for that ass "
or 
"The Booty Jiggler strikes at 3:33 am"

At first people thought it was just a dumb trend, like Slender Man or Momo. But then, the stories started pouring in.

wasn't until my roommate, Tony, started muttering in his sleep that I began to worry, I'e hear him tossing and turning, mumbling, "No, stop….. stop shaking it.." He'd wake up drenched in sweat, refusing to talk about what he'd seen.
But one night, he told me everything.
"There was this.., this guy," Tony stammered, "I was in my room, but it wasn't my room, you know?
Everything felt off I couldn’t move, like sleep paralysis. And then he came in. He didn't walk-he just jiggled his way through the door"
Tony's voice cracked as he continued, "His face was all blurry, like static on an old TV. But his body... his body wouldn't stop moving, His hips, man. They shouldn't move like that. He got closer and closer, and I couldn't de anything but watch. Then he whispered.." Tony gulped, his eyes wide with terror.
"What did he whisper?" I asked.
Tony's voice dropped to a trembling whisper. "It’s jigglin" time..."

I laughed it off. I thought Tony was messing with me-until it happened to me.
That night, I went to bed as usual. But when I fell asleep, I found myself in my bedroom, only... it wasn't quite right. The walls were pulsating, almost like they were breathing. A faint bassline thumped in the distance, rhythmic and menacing.
I tried to move, but I was frozen. That's when I saw him.
The Booty Jiggler emerged from the shadows, his silhouette illuminated by an otherworldly neon glow. His hips swayed to the beat, his movements hypnotic yet horrifying. The air grew thick with the smell of sweat and something sweet, like rotting fruit.
He didn't speak at first. He just twerked-closer, and closer. His eyes—if you could call them that-glimmered like oily black pits, locking onto mine. I wanted to scream, but no sound came out.
Then, in a voice that sounded like it came from inside my own head, he whispered:
"You can't outrun the jiggle..."

I woke up gasping for air, my heart racing. My body felt sore, like I'd run a marathon-or been hit by a truck. I checked my phone: 3:33 a.m.
Tony was gone the next morning. His bed was empty, his phone left behind, still buzzing with notifications. The last thing he posted online was a single sentence:
"Don't let him jiggle into your dreams."

Now, I can't close my eyes without seeing him. The Booty Jiggler doesn't just invade your dreams-he leaves a mark. My friends have started noticing it too: the faint, rhythmic bassline playing in the background of their nightmares. Some say he only appears if you joke about him. Others claim you can summon him by playing twerk music at 3:33 a.m.
But I know the truth: Once you've seen him, you can't unsee him. He's in your head, waiting. And when the bass drops, so does he.
So if you're reading this, take my advice: Don't laugh. Don't joke about him. And for the love of all that's holy, don't watch his videos. Because when the jiggle starts... it never stops.

Last night, I heard the bassline again, faint but unmistakable. I'm scared to sleep, but I know it's only a matter of time before he comes back.
The Booty Jiggler isn't a joke. He's real. And he's coming... one twerk at a time.
