My name is Jack Oliver, i am currently 26 years old, and i am employed as a Gas Station Attendent in a small town in Colorado.  My job, is ehh.. I won't consider it bad nor good. I usually work overnight, but it would still be  barely enough to meet end's meet. The gas station which is where i am currently working was formelly a place where people would normally dispose their garbage. It was pretty normal hearing rumours about a "ghost" or something like that about the place. I didn't believe in the idea of "ghosts" or "spirits" at that time, so i usually brushed it off. Like i said, i usually go overtime till 1:00 P.M midnight but i didn't experience anything unusual.. Until one day, it was a pretty normal day for me, although we barely had enough customers.. Just as usual, i worked overnight. It was 11:00 P.M, when everyone except me and my manager had already went home, we were the only one's left, i was doing extra work such as mopping the floors, cleaning the windows, etc. Oh and  did i forget? Apart from attendents, we were also janitors. This was done  to save extra costs of hiring other staff. As i was saying, i was doing extra work, when i suddenly heard my stomach rumble, i thought to myself that it was probably the food i ate for lunch earlier.. Since i couldn't hold it anymore, i took a little bathroom break.  I  used the last cubicle at the very end of the bathroom. I was doing my business, until  i suddenly heard 3 knocks on the cubicle door. But i initially thought that it was my manager coming to check on me..

So i said:
"Oh, Sorry Manager. I didn't notify you that i was using the bathroom."

No Response..

The knock seemed to get louder and louder, as if someone or something was trying to break theough the door..

I replied, and raised my voice

"Uhh, Manager.. I am currently using this! Could you please go find another cubicle?"

Feeling annoyed,
I rushed to complete my business. I didn't even flush. And when i opened the door, i froze on what i saw.. I saw a lady wearing a white dress, her skin rotting, and her head decapitated.. She was facing the opposite direction of me, she let out a small giggle, feeling absolutely terrified, i tried to move, trying to run away as soon as i can, but my body was just frozen.. As she looked at me, i screamed and screamed, finally my body gave in, and i ran so hard that i almost tripped, then i saw my manager bursting out of his office.

He asked:
"What's all this commotion? Why are you screaming like a little girl?"

I replied:
"Manager, Manager! I saw it!"

He asked:
Who's It? What are you talking about?

I replied
"That lady with no head."

The manager froze in fear, struggling to comprehend what i said. Then he pointed his office. I immedietly understood what he meant, and went into his office with him following behind. He locked the doors, and closed the blinds..

He said with fear in his eyes:

"Your Lucky.."

I replied: 
"How am i lucky? I literally saw a lady with no head!"

He Replied:
"Your lucky to be even alive.."

I was confused on what he meant, so i asked:

"Why is that?"

He explained to me, that lady i saw was no ordinary ghost or spirit.. He explained, that spirit i saw was supposed  to kill me, and trap my soul in her world.. My heart froze when i heard him, if i haven't ran earlier, i would have been dead i thought to myself. My manager advised me to not go home for the night, and to go to a place with many people to prevent being followed by the entity.. I immedietly thanked him, and did what he has told, i didn't go home for the night and i went to the local 7/11 to prevent the entity from following me, As i am writing this as of now, i heard  3 knocks on the door of my house. It is currently 11:00 P.M. Before i look out the window, if something was to ever happen to me, i hope you will never see me, as if you do, i will be there fetching you to the other world..
