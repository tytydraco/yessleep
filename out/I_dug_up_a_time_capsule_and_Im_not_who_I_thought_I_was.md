Back at Catesby House, my phone safely charging, I called the police.  They were not too keen on visiting me for a second time that day, but when they heard what I had to report, they came quickly.

They sent officers to check on the dead man and my car.  While the sun set, they questioned me at my home, and I tried to stick as close to the truth as possible without sounding criminally insane.  I told them about the crash, exactly as it happened, about the horrifically mutilated man I had swerved to avoid.  I said I had searched for help around me, but had found nothing (there was no way they were going to believe me if I told them I had been escorted by three naked women to an unknown location for god-knows-what).  The sticking point was how I had returned to Druwich.  The entire town had seen me riding in bareback on a mysterious black stallion, and the police were extremely suspicious of my (true) story that I had simply encountered the animal whilst wandering the woods.

“How did the horse know where you wanted to go?” asked the police constable who had introduced himself as Owens.

“Luck, I guess,” I said.  PC Owens scowled.  “Listen, I have no way of determining the horse’s frame of mind.  Maybe he wandered away from his enclosure and was just as lost as I was.”

His frown deepened and he wrote something emphatically on his notepad.  Just then his partner, a PC Phillips, picked up her phone.  Her face twisted into a look of concern, which she quickly turned on me as she listened to the caller.  She hung up and sighed.

“That was the officer at the site of your accident, Mr. Catesby.  He found a body in the middle of the road, as you described, however…it appears that this individual has been dead for quite some time.”

“What do you mean?  It was only a few hours ago.”

“They found a skeleton, so old and fragile it was practically crumbling.”

“Were you lying to us?” PC Owens said, anger rising in his voice.

“No, I wasn’t,” I said, trying to suppress my frustration.  “The guy practically died in my arms!”

PC Phillips smiled condescendingly and placed her hand on my arm, as if to comfort me.

“Your car was in a rather bad state.  Are you sure you didn’t hit your head in the collision?  If you are feeling unwell, we can have an ambulance come.  You don’t have to feel shy or ashamed at all.  In that sort of downpour, I wouldn’t be surprised if your eyes were playing tricks on you.”

I wanted to protest, but I knew it would be useless.

“I’m fine.  I don’t need medical attention,” I said.

“There is no shortage of missing hikers and other wanderers in that forest,” said PC Owens smugly.  “Perhaps an animal uncovered an old skeleton and dragged it in the middle of the road.”

They gave me information about the recovery of my vehicle, reminded me to call my insurance, and other boring things before finally leaving me alone.  I tried to remember the last time I had eaten something and realized I hadn’t had anything all day.  While I lamented the loss of the wheel of Sarah’s cheese that was still in my car, I was actually not that hungry at all, a fact that surprised me greatly.  I suppose I might have attributed that to adrenaline or nerves, but at the moment I was calm, strangely so.

Once again, I found myself before the items from the time capsule, still on the kitchen counter, which the police had blessedly ignored.  I picked up the stiletto and ran my fingers along the blade and handle.  *What did you do, Richard?* I thought.

Just then I got a text from the owner of the gallery where my mother used to exhibit her art.  *Hey, Willy!  It’s Zach.*  I rolled my eyes.  It’s William.  Never Willy.  *Was going through some old stuff in storage and found a bunch of your mom’s old work from the mid-90s.  Heard you moved away, but I wanted to make sure you get it.*

I responded immediately, eager to shift my mind to more pleasant things. *Thanks. That would be great.  Which series was this?  Can you send me a couple pictures to jog my memory?*

Zach sent me five pictures of paintings that looked very different from my mom’s usual style.  She typically had done mostly still lifes, in the style of the old Dutch and Spanish masters, with food or fruit and household objects.  But these were landscapes, almost surreal, forests in dark browns, grays, and greens.  At first glance, the forests were empty, but in one of the pictures, something caught my eye and I zoomed in on my phone.  There was a man in the forest, tall, quite graceful looking with long, blonde hair.  His pale face, like other details in the piece, were impressionistically unclear.  I saw my mother’s signature initials in the corner, confirming that this unusual collection was hers.

I sent the picture back to Zach asking him for the title.  *Oberon*, he responded.  *Miranda loved Shakespeare.*  He was right, though that love began with my maternal grandmother, who named my mother after a character in *The Tempest.*  Oberon came from another play, however, *A Midsummer’s Night’s Dream*.

“King of the fairies,” I muttered to myself, bile rising in my throat.

I went upstairs to my bedroom and located a large cardboard box of family photo albums that I had not yet unpacked.  I dug through them, finally locating the one I wanted, with *Christmas 1993* printed on the spine.  My first and only Christmas at Catesby House.  I opened the album to a group photo: my grandparents and parents seated on a sofa in front of the Christmas tree, my mother with 10-month-old me on her lap.  It was a joyous picture, one of my favorites, everyone smiling, no indication of the rift that would form between the generations.  But I hadn’t pulled out the album to engage in nostalgia.  There were my father and grandfather, true Catesby Crows, as my father liked to say, dark hair, dark eyes, a long hawk-like nose.  My grandmother also had dark hair, though streaked with gray in the photograph, and brown eyes.  My mother’s hair was brown as well, only slightly lighter, her eyes also brown.

Then there was me.  An adorable baby with blonde hair and blue eyes.  My hair would darken as I age, my mother would say.  It never did.  I once dated a geneticist who told me that this sort of thing is not that simple, that plenty of children are born with distinctive features that might skip a few generations.  But looking at this picture alongside that painting filled me with dread, especially when viewed in the context of the other strange things that have been happening to me since I dug up the time capsule.  My heart ached thinking that I could never talk to my mom about this.

It was dark now.  I thought I should go to bed, even though I didn’t feel that tired.  I threw my clothes off, got a pair of sweatpants off the floor, and crawled into bed.  I stared at the ceiling and the house felt so empty, so stripped of life.  My eyes eventually closed and I found myself in the midst of another vivid dream.

I was walking through the forest, at the center of a procession, on either side of me were two lines of people with torches, dressed in the tunics, trousers and circular brooches of thousands of years ago.  We came to a clearing, the same clearing the women had lured me to earlier.  A stone altar was set in the center, stained a tell-tale deep red.  Behind it was a throne of woven branches on a stone dais.  I ascended and sat in it, the torch-bearers forming a circle around the clearing.

Two burly men came forward with a man, dragging him by a rope tied around his neck.  The man was young and strong, but did not struggle beyond occasional sputters at his rope.  His captors brought him forward to me and knelt, speaking in a language I did not understand.  I extended my arm, decorated with a braided gold torque, and gestured for them to approach.  The torch bearers around me murmured eagerly.

The men brought their captive to the altar.  I nodded and descended from the throne.  The men pulled the knot of the rope into the man’s neck, deeper and deeper, until he was gasping for air, his eyes bulging, veins in his eyes and forehead about to burst.  I raised a finger and the knot was loosened, the man choking, falling, but caught by his captors who hit him in the back of the head with a wooden club.  They placed the bleeding, unconscious man on the altar.

An attendant brought me a small elaborate knife which I raised to the onlookers with a smile.  I gazed down at the man before me, his eyes staring forward blankly, his face twitching.  With one swift, graceful movement I brought the knife down and sliced open the man’s throat.  The people cheered as I absorbed their adulation, and watched the rich, red blood pool around the altar.  The man was dead.  I carefully dipped my hands in his blood and raised them.  They began to chant, and I felt…powerful.

I awoke once again on the floor of my bedroom.  I brought my hands to my face, trembling, but saw that they were clean.  *Holy shit*.  My heart racing, I went to the bathroom and examined myself in the mirror.  Same hair, same face, same clothes.  I sighed.  But there was something about my eyes, something off in the color.  The blue burned with a new intensity, all too similar to those of the ladies in the wood.  The overhead lights flickered and went out.  I felt a hand on my shoulder and looked down to see pale, slender fingers.  I with a cry, I shook it off and the lights were back on, leaving me shivering.

I went downstairs, made myself a coffee and watched the sunrise over my garden.  I stared at the brown mound of dirt where I had reburied the skull.  I thought about who that unfortunate individual may have been; I thought of the man I killed in the dream, how it had felt when I plunged the knife into his flesh.  I shuddered at the memory.

“It’s time to end this,” I said.  I picked up my phone and dialed a number.  Sarah answered groggily.

“William, it’s six in the morning.”

“I need you to make an introduction for me.”

I agreed to meet Alan, Barbara, and Sarah at the pub.  I pulled on a turtleneck, some reasonably clean pants and, since my eyes were still looking…distinctive, a pair of sunglasses.  When I opened the door, I was surprised to find Sarah there, looking beautiful of course, but also strangely nervous.

“I heard about your accident.  I’m terribly sorry,” she said, fidgeting with the strap of her purse.

“I’m fine, though I can’t say the same about my car.  I’m sorry to say your cheese was inside.”

“I’ll get you more, free of charge.”

“As long as you bring it to me yourself.”

A smile flickered across her face, but she still seemed tense.

“Please, William, I like you.  Be careful.”

“I thought Alan and Barbara were lovely people, no need to worry.”

“They are.  They’ve just…been through quite a bit.  The whole town has.”

“So I’ve gathered,” I said.  “That is why we need to talk.”

She nodded.

“A little overcast for sunglasses, no?” She reached towards them, but I caught her hand perhaps a bit too forcefully.  Her eyes widened.

“Fashion statement,” I said, chuckling, giving her hand a playful squeeze.  I could see the sadness in her eyes.  *Does she know what I suspect is the truth?*  She didn’t release my hand, instead she held it tighter and we walked the couple blocks to the pub in silence.

Alan and Barbara were sitting on a bench outside.  Alan sat back, his arms folded, eyeing me suspiciously.  Barbara was smiling thinly, her eyes betraying undisguised hatred.  She noticed our hands and looked at Sarah with alarm.  I let go of Sarah’s hand and reached out mine in greeting.

“I don’t think we’ve properly met.  I know you know I’m William Catesby.”

Barbara stood and stared, ignoring my overture.  Alan sighed and took my hand.

“Alan Lewis.” He turned to Barbara. “Come on, Babs.  Let’s be cordial.”

Barbara closed her eyes, as though contemplating something unpleasant.

“Barbara Hill.  I would rather not take your hand.”

“Fine,” I said, shrugging.

“Shall we?” Alan said, gesturing to the pub.  As I was closest to the door, I grabbed the knob.  Nausea hit me hard, my head began to throb, and it was then that I noticed that it was made of a certain metal.  Iron.  I staggered back, but quickly steadied myself.  *Fuck.*  I don’t know what was worse, my reaction to the iron, or the fact that I had opened the door with ease only a few days before.  Before I dug up the time capsule.

“Actually, do you mind if we chat outside?  I noticed you have a table in the back.”

Alan, Barbara, and Sarah had undoubtedly observed my reaction to the iron door knob, but I tried to keep my cool.  Alan shrugged and we went around the back of the pub to a weathered wooden picnic table.  For a few minutes we sat in silence until I decided to cut to the chase.

“I need to know what is going on here.  No more riddles.  No more whispers.  Let’s start with the time capsule?  What was it?  Why were you so eager for me to dig it up?”

“We’re going to have to start a lot farther back than that, lad,” Alan said, his shoulders sagging with sadness.  He and Barbara looked at each other.  She nodded to him.

“Thousands of years ago, this was the land of the fae.  The people of the woods.  They ruled over the humans here as cruel gods, empowered by no less a sacrifice than human lives.  Men, women, even children they demanded.  The fae, in return, protected them, ensured a good harvest.  But the people chafed under the increasingly greedy demands of the fae.  They saw other humans lived prosperously without such dire consequences.  They saw that when the Romans came, the fae did not stop them.  So the people began to gather iron in secret, and the fae soon found their thralls less willing to volunteer captives for sacrifice.

We were one of the first areas to become Christian, not only because we desired to worship a God who did not demand our blood, but also in the Christian faith, we had found the greatest weapon against the fae: bells made of iron.  We took the entire village’s supply of iron and melted it down to a great iron bell.  When it rang, the effect was catastrophic for the fae.  They were driven away.  Weakened, they turned back to their own wicked world.  The people were free.  At least for a time.

Now the fae would occasionally sneak away for mischief, stealing a horse here, some grain there.  But they had slunk back to the peripheries and the humans forgot them, save in the old tales.”

“Let me guess,” I said.  “This is where Richard Catesby comes in.”

Alan nodded solemnly.  Barbara shifted on the bench, her face contorted in anger.

“My grandmother was there,” she said, practically hissing at me.  “She was there in 1923, on the night he did it.  Your family’s maid, she was, a lass of sixteen.  He had asked his valet, no more than a boy, to help him dig in the garden.  Told him he had heard there was something valuable buried there and needed an extra pair of hands.  My grandmother watched as they dug a deep hole.  Richard directed the boy’s attention to something and while he wasn’t looking, he took out a knife and slit the boy’s throat.  Until her dying day, my grandmother remembered how that terrible man smiled, how he thrust the knife into the dead boy’s eye and placed a piece of paper in his mouth, tying the jaws shut with a piece of cloth.

The sky then erupted and thunder shook the town.  My grandmother heard a violent clap and then the smell of something burning.  She ran out of Catesby House to see the belltower of St. Edward’s in flames, the people weeping bitterly.  She felt a menacing hand on her shoulder.  Richard was behind her, his lips at her ears.

‘Tell another soul what you saw and you’ll end up with the boy,’ he said.  Ever since that night, the town withered.  Suddenly people began disappearing in the woods, never to be seen again.  The fae were back, becoming stronger and stronger, luring people to their doom.  That’s what your family did.  Their blood is on your hands!”

“Barbara’s husband went missing in the forest twenty-five years ago,” Sarah said quietly.  “Alan’s son committed suicide after his wife went missing too.”

“I am terribly sorry for your losses.  For the losses of everyone here.” I said, not knowing what else to say.  My sense of creeping dread told me that sorry probably wouldn’t cut it.

“How about I bring out something to drink?” Sarah volunteered.  Alan and Barbara nodded.  I agreed.

“Thank you, dear,” Barbara said, as Sarah disappeared inside.  Alan was looking at his hands.  But Barbara glared right at me.  I met her gaze.

“Tell me what I need to do.  You told me to open the time capsule.  I did it.  As far as I can tell, it has only made things worse.”

“Richard covered up his crime by telling the town he had buried a time capsule,” Barbara said bitterly.  “That in a century, a Catesby would dig it up.  Bragging, laughing as we mourned our church.”

Alan put up a hand to calm her.

“When you came, lad, we thought that opening the capsule would break our curse.  That whatever evil pact Richard had made would come undone.  But as you said, that has not been the case.”

“The time capsule was the catalyst,” I said slowly.  “Not for the undoing of the curse.  But for…something else.”  *Something within me is changing.  Something that lay dormant for a long time.*

“You must give them what you owe,” Barbara said.  “We’ve been paying attention, William.”

“I’ve noticed,” I said coldly.

“I think that now both you and I know what that means,” Alan said, standing.

I stood as well.  I took a step backward, ready to run.  Instead, something cold and excruciatingly painful was clamped on my neck.  I howled in agony.  *Iron.*

“I am so, so sorry, William,” Sarah said behind me.

My knees buckled underneath me, my body weakened, and I fell into the dark.

Now, obviously, I’m writing this out, posting this here.  I’m alive and, perhaps more importantly, I have an internet connection.  Don’t worry needlessly.  But the next parts are hard.  Very hard.  I’ll post when I can.  Thanks for sticking with me here.
