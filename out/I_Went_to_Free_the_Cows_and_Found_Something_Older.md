I never imagined that a simple act of rebellion, something I thought righteous, could unravel reality itself. We were a small band of vegan activists, bound together by indignation and a thirst for justice. That night, the air was damp, the fog crawling low over the fields, muting the sounds of the countryside. We moved cautiously toward the farm, hearts drumming like ritual drums, each step a defiance against a world that seemed, at least to us, indifferent to suffering.

The fence came into view first, silvered by moonlight. I remember thinking how absurdly easy it would be to slip through it, how simple it all seemed. But the pasture beyond it… I wish I had never seen it.

At first, I thought the cows were hiding, pressed close to the ground. Then one lifted its head, or something that resembled a head, and the illusion shattered. Its eyes were vast, black, and wet, like bottomless wells reflecting nothing at all. The shape of its body seemed familiar, bovine in outline, yet the skin was translucent in places, revealing sinews that writhed like serpents, muscles that did not obey earthly anatomy. Veins pulsed with dark liquid that glimmered under the moon like stars trapped in a viscous night.

One of my friends stepped closer, whispering a name, her fear was almost polite, as if she could negotiate with whatever this was. Then the shapes began to move. Slowly at first, wriggling and stretching in ways no natural creature could. Limbs bent backwards, torsos twisted like wet clay. Faces… faces emerged, not where they should have been, screaming silently with impossible mouths, multiple rows of teeth glinting like black pearls. And the hum began, low and resonant, vibrating through the mist, through the grass, through our bones.

I wanted to run, but curiosity and horror chained me. One of the creatures leaned toward us, its skin rippling, and I saw it clearly: the bones inside were alive. They bent and reshaped themselves, skeletal fingers extending from ribs, twisting around the air as though grasping invisible prey. And then it happened, one of my friends reached out. His hand met the creature’s flank, and the flesh pulsed and adhered to him, black veins crawling up his wrist, merging him into it. His scream was inhuman, fractured across octaves, while his body began to warp, knees bending wrong, ribs elongating, his eyes ballooning into faceless voids.

I vomited, retched in the grass, but I could not look away. They were not cows. They were a breeding ground for something older than the stars, something that consumed comprehension itself. Every movement suggested hunger, not for meat, not for blood, but for *awareness*, for the fragile sanity of any who dared witness them. I felt my mind fray. Thoughts that were mine mingled with alien ideas, impossible geometries, cyclopean cities suspended beneath stars that weren’t ours. I understood, with crushing terror, that the farm was a gateway, and we had stumbled through it.

We ran. I remember the wet slap of mud underfoot, the metallic tang of panic in my mouth, the way the fog seemed to clutch at us, slowing our flight. Behind us, the hum followed, persistent, intimate, as if tracing our synapses. My friends, I don’t know if any survived in any recognizable form.

I returned to the world I once knew, but I am haunted. Shadows twist too quickly, shapes in the periphery of my vision move too deliberately. The world itself feels thin, like skin stretched over a void that hungers to tear through. And at night, when the fog rolls in and the wind carries the faintest, impossible hum, I hear it whispering.

We went to free cows. We found… worshipers of the void, cocooned in flesh we could barely comprehend. And now I understand: the universe is not merely indifferent. It is a predator, patient, and it waits in forms we mistake for mundane things. And I fear, every night, that one day it will come for me, not because I deserve it, but because it has always hungered for awareness, and for curiosity.
