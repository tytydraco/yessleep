I asked for extra hours because I’ve been saving to move out of state. My lease ends in three months, and I’ve been desperate to escape this town — you know how small towns are. Once something bad happens, everyone talks about it for a week, then just pretends it never happened. People go missing, and after the candlelight vigils and the posters fade, no one brings them up again. Not here.

Anyway, I’ve been closing the shop for fourteen nights in a row. I know it’s not healthy, but money talks. I figured it was just temporary — scrub down the espresso machine, wipe the counters, restock the pastry case. Lock the doors at 10, clean until 11:30, and I’m usually out by midnight.

The first time I noticed something weird was about five nights in. I heard a knock on the back door.

Not a customer door — the back door. The one in the alley we use for trash and inventory.

It was soft at first. Not aggressive. Just...persistent. Knock. Knock. Pause. Knock knock knock.

I thought maybe it was one of the local homeless guys. We have a few who wander that stretch of downtown. I even left some muffins and a warm cup out there once. But when I looked through the peephole, no one was there.

I opened it anyway. Nothing but the usual stack of empty milk crates and the overpowering stench of old coffee grounds. No wind. No cars passing. Just stillness.

I shrugged it off. I do that a lot — tell myself I imagined things. I’ve always had a vivid imagination, and being tired doesn’t help.

But then it kept happening. Every night.

Knock. Knock knock. Scratch.

Yes, scratching.

I started locking the back door as soon as we closed, keeping the lights dim so the front didn’t look too “open.” Still, around 10:45 or so, the noises would start. I’d turn the music up to drown them out.

One night, about ten days in, I found something tucked under the door: a crumpled receipt from our own register with the words “I LIKE YOUR SKIN” scrawled in black marker across it.

I called my manager. They said to call the cops. I did.

The officer who came out was nice enough, but I could tell he thought I was being dramatic. He looked around the alley, shrugged, and told me not to walk alone at night.

So helpful.

The next night, I brought a box cutter with me. I kept it in my apron pocket and tried not to look nervous.

That was the night I saw him.

I had just finished mopping when I saw something flicker past the glass door. I thought it was a reflection at first, but it stopped. Paused. Then backed up and stood there, staring in.

He was standing in the glow of the streetlight — this man who looked...off. His clothes hung too loose, like he’d lost a lot of weight fast. His face was mostly shadowed by a baseball cap, but I could see his mouth. It was open. Smiling.

I yelled that we were closed. He didn’t move. Just pressed his palm to the glass.

When I stepped closer, my stomach dropped.

There was blood on his fingers.

I backed away slowly, grabbed my phone, and called the cops again. He was gone by the time they arrived. No trace.

After that, I started getting paranoid. I’d come in and find the espresso machine turned on when I knew I left it off. One time the lights flickered, and the stereo started playing by itself — a scratchy, warbling version of a song I didn’t recognize. I thought maybe the place was haunted. That almost would’ve been a relief.

I asked to switch back to day shifts. My manager said no — no one else wanted to close.

I should’ve quit. But I needed the money.

The last night I worked was last Thursday.

It started the same. Quiet. Cold. I didn’t even hear any knocks. I thought maybe whoever it was had moved on.

At around 11:20, I went into the back to grab a mop head.

The light above the supply closet was flickering again. I opened the door, and as I reached up to grab the mop, I heard someone breathe behind me.

I spun around.

Nothing.

Just empty space. The closet was barely big enough for one person, but I swear I felt someone exhale, right behind my neck.

I ran out, heart hammering, and went straight to the front. That’s when I saw it.

Someone was behind the counter.

They were crouched low, rummaging through the cabinet where we keep the spare aprons.

I thought it was a customer at first. I don’t know why. I stepped forward and said, “Hey, we’re closed—”

The figure stood up.

And it was me.

I don’t mean they looked like me. I mean it was me.

Same uniform. Same hair. Same necklace. Same chipped nail polish on the pinky finger.

I froze.

She — it — stared at me for a long time. Then tilted its head.

And smiled.

The smile wasn’t right. It was too wide. The skin stretched at the edges like it didn’t quite fit.

I backed away, shaking. I reached for my phone, but it was gone. I must’ve left it in the back.

Then she — I don’t know what else to call her — spoke.

“I’ve been watching you,” she said, in my voice.

Perfectly mimicked. Except… hollow. Like a voice filtered through broken speakers.

“I like you.”

Then she raised her hand — my hand — and peeled something from her cheek.

It came off like a mask. Like wet fabric being pulled from raw meat.

Underneath, the face was... wrong.

Patchy, mottled skin. Red where it hadn’t healed. Threads. Needles. Bits of scalp sewn together.

She had stitched me into herself.

I don’t remember screaming. I must have, because when I woke up, I wasn’t in the coffee shop anymore.

I was here.

In this room.

It’s small. Bare. Concrete floor. One flickering bulb. The walls smell like mold and something worse — like rotting meat.

She comes in sometimes.

She’s still wearing my skin.

And she talks to me. In my voice. She practices it. Repeats things I’ve said. Gets better every day.

She’s gone back to work now.

No one knows I’m missing yet.

She’s got my phone. My keys. My face.

She’s writing this, too.

She wants you to know how easy it was.

How much she loves being me.

If you come into the coffee shop this week and the girl behind the counter smiles just a little too wide, don’t order anything.

Run.
