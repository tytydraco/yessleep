“Medic!”

I watched as the newest casualty was shuttled away on a bloodstained stretcher, the boy’s face covered in shrapnel. Both medic girls carrying him struggled just to stay on their feet, their eyes ringed with dark circles, their steps unsteady as they tripped over the rubble strewn sidewalk. Smoke filled the air to choke us, the nearby building already half-consumed with fire, and I tasted sour burnt flesh on the air.

*That’s five since we got here. I’m going to need more replacement troops from the resistance pool. If they even have that much to spare.*

If our advance into Black Oak had been lightning fast, the enemy seemed to get themselves together in the past three days, and had thrown up a stubborn defense that slowed our progress to a crawl. Their snipers were particularly effective, and only today had I managed to catch the enemy mortar team in a run-down condo, which they defended so stoutly that we were forced to burn it down. One of our trucks had been hit, and the mortar killed the driver, gunner, and wounded two others so bad they had to be sent back to Ark River. While we continued to make progress into the north, it was slow, and morale dropped steadily amongst our troops.

Taking out a slip of paper, I scrawled a short communique for Sean and handed it off to my runner. “Get this to Sean. When you come back, the farthest north we’ll likely be is the old fire station. Be careful.”

 Yawning in fatigue, the scrawny kid made a haphazard salute and took off into the ruined streets. Fierce combat had devastated much more of the central and northern parts of Black Oak than it had the south, and refugees flooded through our lines all the time to escape the fighting. Already they’d appointed delegations among them to talk to our leadership, begged for food, complained about the lack of services, and demanded that power and water be restored. We did our best to assure them such things were coming as soon as the fighting stopped, but they were insistent, and tireless. To make matters worse, the weather hadn’t improved, and many of the outer roads in the county were turning to muddy tracks, bogging down our supply convoys. Radio contact with Ark River was difficult thanks to ELSAR jamming, and all news relied on runners that had to travel to the city outskirts, where radio operators could still get through to the rest of our logistics chain. Meanwhile enemy aircraft seemed to have either run out or stayed grounded at the still-uncaptured airfield, though their artillery hadn’t let up, helping to reduce the city to cinders block by block. I hadn’t seen Chris in days, and hadn’t slept more than two hours at a time in the few instances I could afford to rest.

Shuffling back to my command truck, I reached behind the passenger seat to grab a cardboard box of nine-millimeter cartridges, and began to thumb fresh rounds into one of my depleted magazines.

“Anyone know where Lieutenant Brun is?” Shoes slapped across the asphalt on the other side of the line of trucks, and I sighed in exhaustion.

*I literally just sent a runner. This no radio thing really sucks.*

“Over here.” I tapped the back of my loaded magazine against the truck doorframe to make sure the rounds were seated, before sliding it into a pouch on my chest rig.

An oily-haired boy slowed to a stop in front of me, gasping for air, his face red from exertion. He’d clearly been running hard, and I figured from quite a ways, which meant this had to be urgent. “I . . . Commander Hammond says . . . you need to come . . .”

Putting a hand on his shoulder, I handed him a spare canteen from inside the truck. “Slow down, soldier. Catch your breath. Whatever it is, it can wait a few more minutes.”

He accepted the canteen and nearly drained it, the boy resting both hands on his knees in exhaustion. No older than Lucille, maybe thirteen, his greasy dark blonde hair was stuffed into a knit cap, a ragged corduroy jacket atop his shoulders. His right arm bore the green armband of our coalition, improvised by the resistance since even the dedicated women of Ark River couldn’t make new jackets that fast, and the only weapon he had was a scuffed old revolver in a leather holster on one hip. Judging by its scratches and worn finish, the gun must have been his father’s, or perhaps grandfather’s, and I wondered how many bullets the boy had for it.

At last, he straightened up and wiped his runny nose on one coat sleeve to give me a salute. “Ma’am, Commander Hammond needs you at the central headquarters right away. He said it’s top priority. He wants you to dig your platoon in at a defensive posture and come see him as soon as possible.”

Trying not to betray my nervousness, I hooked both thumbs into my war belt. “Did he say what was so important? We haven’t reached the prison camp yet, we still have five blocks to go. Is everything alright in the center?”

He shrugged, and the kid sighed in morose dread of what would likely be another long jog back to where he’d started. “I was just told to come find you. But everyone else is already there, even the yellow-haired people with swords. Must be something big.”

Nodding, I waved him toward the back of our convoy, where a truck sat stacked with supplies. “You can ride back with me. Get yourself something to eat in the meantime, okay? And keep drinking water.”

A grin of relief slid over his face, and he went without needing encouragement, while I wove my way around the truck to head for the closest intact building.

I found Sergeant McPhearson in a small room, peering through a set of binoculars alongside two of our machine gunners, their 240 propped up on its bipod between them.

“They’re moving into that old boutique shop.” Charlie lowered his binoculars to point as I approached, his face smeared with soot from the fire across the street. “That’s twelve new riflemen I’ve seen in the past half hour. They’ll probably have it covered in sandbags and wire by the time we get there.”

Keeping to one side, out of sight of potential snipers, I flexed my neck to crack it and breathed a little sigh of relief when it let loose in a satisfying *pop*. “Commander’s ordered us to stop. Something’s going on at headquarters, so I’m headed there. They want us to dig in and wait.”

The three others blinked at me, half in delirium from their weariness, and half from disbelief.

“Now?” Henry, one of the gunners, looked up from a bit of twine he idly twisted between his fingers. “But we’re close. You can see the guard towers for the prison from the third floor, and they’re giving every time we push.”

“He’s right.” Nick, the other man on the 240, looked up from inspecting a belt of 7.62 cartridges. “If we let up now, they’ll dig in real tight and we’ll never get them out. That store is solid brick, we’d need a direct shot from one of the howitzers to bring her down.”

*Probably two or three, actually.*

I held up a hand in acknowledgement of their points. “Headquarters wants us to dig in. I shouldn’t be gone more than few hours, and I’ll send a runner if it’s longer. While I’m gone, Sergeant McPherson will decide where to settle down . . . be that here, or a few blocks ahead. Understood?”

Charlie’s face twisted into a wolfish grin, as did the other boys, and they bobbed their heads, almost in unison. I’d found that being an officer wasn’t as difficult with good NCO’s and thus far, Charlie had been a lifesaver. He knew exactly the ‘loophole’ I’d just opened up for him, and if anyone could be trusted to lead 4^(th) in my absence, it was McPherson.

“I’ll grab more ammo and water while I’m out.” I adjusted the shoulder strap of my submachine gun on my shoulder. “Campbell, Brigs, and I will get the wounded to an aid station on the way. Anything else you boys need?”

“Sydney Sweeny in a towel.” Nick muttered what he likely thought was too low for me to hear, and Henry suppressed a snicker. Many rumors swirled about my various abilities thanks to the mutation, but my platoon often seemed to forget that I wasn’t as normal as they were, having grown used to my golden irises a long time ago.

*At least they’re laughing. Morale can’t be too bad if that’s happening. If only I could get them a pretty girl to talk to, then they’d take the rest of the town all by themselves.*

A smile flitted across my face, and I caught their eye to shrug. “She doesn’t answer my calls anymore.”

Nick’s face went red, and Henry threw a spent cartridge case at him. “Moron.”

“If you could get them to send us a mortar crew, it would help.” Unphased by their joking, Charlie nodded toward the distant buildings down the street. “Even if they want us on the defensive, we could smash enemy strongpoints before they form. Some more flares wouldn’t hurt either.”

“I’ll work on it.” I turned to head for the door and stopped to meet Charlie’s eyes one more time. “Be careful, alright? I don’t want to come back to more stretchers.”

Loading up one of the empty trucks with the wounded, I rode with Lucille at the turret and Private Brigs at the wheel, our truck slowly winding its way back through the smoldering wreckage of Black Oak. The runner fell asleep in the back alongside the stretchers as if he were snuggled in a feather bed, and I figured he too hadn’t slept much in the past few days. What should have been a ten minute drive took almost a half hour due to the shell craters, rubble, and a few downed electric poles.

Just as I felt ready to slip into unconsciousness myself, we pulled into the newest location for our central headquarters.

It had once been a public library, one of the older ones built in the mid 1900’s with two stories, pillars in the front, and walls made of stone. Much of the original assortment of books had been purged by ELSAR at the start of the occupation, and what had been left was mostly things that wouldn’t rouse the population to rebellious thoughts. Corny romance novels, innocuous children’s books, and old-issue gardening magazines were common fare; the adventures, science-fiction, historical records, and non-edited religious texts were long gone. A stack of local newspapers stood to one side, each page filled with ELSAR propaganda such as the dubious headline *Rural insurgents ‘Almost completely wiped out.’ says Sheriff Wurnauw*. These, however, still held a purpose in our hands; above them, someone had taped a paper sign to the wall with an arrow saying, ‘free toilet paper.’ A few kiosks for the corporation’s patented virtual reality gaming system had been installed, but these were smashed by resistance fighters when they stormed the building, on suspicion they could be used by ELSAR to spy on whoever controlled the place. Cots filled one room to hold yet another aid station, the researcher staff kept busy with their role as medics in the narrow rows between the beds.

“There you are.” From among the various medics, Eve strode forward, her battle armor covered in soot and speckles of blood.

Before I could say anything, she wrapped me in a warm hug, one that told me she needed a rest as well from how she swayed on her feet. Eve had always been open with her emotions, not bound by the cynical aloofness of our modern culture, and while she could be naïve at times, the genuineness of her people was refreshing. She’d tied her hair back and donned latex gloves instead of her metal gauntlets, moving from patient to patient in an effort to help the worn-out nurses. On Eve’s hip was a belt with pouches full of herbs, bandages, and little vials of Lantern Rose nectar that her people were famous for. Tasting of oranges and vanilla ice cream, the concoction was made from a Breach-borne variety of rose that glowed at night like a lantern, thus earning its name. While potent in small doses, it could only cure minor injuries and seemed to work best on the Ark River folk with their enhanced genetics. Still, the stuff was borderline miraculous in reducing blood loss, stimulating regeneration, and shock treatment, enough that many lives were doubtless saved thanks to the serum.

“It’s good to see you.” She released me to gesture at the room of wounded men with a sad frown. “Sean wanted to wait until everyone was here to start, so I thought I’d lend a hand. They just keep coming, one every hour. Most are too far gone for the nectar to help, but it eases their pain.”

I watched a cart trundle past us, another limp body under a sheet atop its flat deck, one hand sticking out as if in rigid farewell. “Where’s Adam?”

Eve pointed to where her husband crouched over a cot in the far corner, his bible in one hand, head bent in prayer. “I tend to those we can save. He cares for those we cannot. At least when they go, they will go in Adonai’s hands.”

Sucking in a breath to steel myself, I tried not to think about how uncertain that made me feel. Did I believe such things? I honestly couldn’t say for sure. Part of me was far more receptive to the idea than I’d ever been before, and after all I’d seen in this strange place, how could I pretend not to wonder? Yet, the disturbing notion that I might get it wrong, that the divine might not in fact exist at all, that we might be simply fired into the ether of nothingness after death was too horrible to allow me to commit to any one path. I wanted to have faith like Eve, wanted something to calm the creeping dread inside my heart with each passing day, but I didn’t know how.

*So many dead . . . please, God if you really exist, let this all be worth it in the end.*

“Oh good, you’re here.” Sarah Abernathy emerged from the hustle and bustle, her own white operating uniform stained red. She wore a stoney, impassive face, as if the head researcher had shut off all her emotions like a robot. “Sean’s waiting on us. I would be there, but one of our militia men started bleeding internally, so I had to operate.”

In this matter-of-fact tone, she peeled off her blue latex gloves with a pink mis of blood as the stretchy material released her fingers and led us down a hallway to the offices.

We filed into a conference room the back, with modern swivel chairs and a wide oak table that seemed out of place among the uniforms, armor, and weapons of the patrons clustered around it.

Adam and Eve found a corner for themselves, and I picked Chris out among the maze of faces to slip in alongside him.

“Hey.” One hand interlaced with mine, and he made a tense half-smile.

“Hey.” I did the same, wishing we had ten minutes alone. “What’s going on?”

Before he could speak, Sean’s towering super-hero physique darkened the door of the office. The handsome features of the former policeman were now lined with heavy thought, and a few gray stress hairs had appeared in his dark locks. Andrea was on his heels, her own face drawn and pale, and with her came Josh, a look of barely kempt rage on his thin features.

“Is everyone here?” Sean glanced over the room, and seemingly satisfied with his own answer, went on. “I know you’ve all got things to do, so I’ll make this quick; we’ve been contacted by ELSAR’s leadership. They’re asking for a temporary ceasefire, a prisoner exchange, and that we allow civilian evacuations from sectors under their control. As of right now, we have yet to issue our response.”

He glanced to Andrea, who seemed to take his cue to speak, unfolding her arms to place both palms on the conference table.

“We have received word that one of our chief operatives is among the prisoners held by ELSAR.” Her eyes landed on mine, and I felt my chest tighten. “Adhrit Veer Kabanagarajan was a key informant within the higher ranks of their corporate staff. I don’t know how long they’ve had him in their custody, but we last had contact six days ago, which means they have had more than enough time to work him over. Kaba knows a lot about the resistance, and if they break him it could jeopardize any assets we still have behind enemy lines. We need to get him back alive, if possible.”

From where I stood, I fought a wave of nausea at the memories of my time in Organ captivity, the screams that had come from the other cells, the stench of blood, the leering eyes of the guards. One of the few members of ELSAR who dared to go against the corporate agenda, Kaba had saved more lives than I had fingers or toes, feeding information about ELSAR’s movements to the underground from his position in the corporate office structure. He’d been the one to cut my tracker out after the resistance rescued me from ELSAR, and it was Kaba who told them where to look for me in the first place. I’d been lucky to escape Organ hands in less than a day; Kaba had been there for almost a week.

Folding my arms, I swallowed hard, and squeezed my eyes shut to keep the sour tide from rising in my throat.

*Maybe he got a heart attack and died quick. How much pain can someone endure before they just die? Good God, if they put him into on of those surgery machines . . .*

“If we accept, the exchange would take place in the town square, here.” Sean pointed to a place on the map that was still contested between our units and the enemy. “In return for the release of six resistance prisoners, we would turn over six of the ELSAR prisoners we’ve captured so far. We would also hold a conference with their leader, George Koranti, and his command staff, to discuss a potential diplomatic settlement.”

The room went silent for a moment as Sean straightened up.

“So . . .” He laced both hands behind his back, and I could see in his weary expression that he braced for the inevitable. “Thoughts?”

“It’s a trap.” Ethan glared at the map with distrustful eyes. “They’re losing, and they want to take out our leadership with either a missile or sniper. We go to this, and they’ll shell us into oblivion.”

“We can’t just leave Kaba behind.” Andrea frowned, her hands set on both hips.

“How do you know he isn’t dead already?” Ethan swiveled his head to fix her with a characteristically stern look, one that had seen too much in this bizarre world to have hope in fairy tales.

Andrea lowered her gaze, and I could tell she hadn’t wanted to consider such a possibility. For all the things she’d went through in the resistance, the eldest Campbell girl still seemed to want to believe in miracles, and while I’d seen a few myself, I doubted they were in good supply.

“If there is a chance to end this now, we should at least entertain it.” Chris his thumbs hooked in his war belt, fingers tapping idly on the main buckle. “Besides, not everyone has to attend the conference. I’m sure Koranti won’t put all his eggs in the basket either; even if he is there, I’m sure there will be more of their leadership behind the scenes watching to be sure we play ball.”

Leaning against the wall in the corner next to Eve, Adam flexed gloved fingers on the hilt of his sword. “In my experience, ELSAR hasn’t shied away from lies and deception. Mr. Sanderson is right, this smells of an ambush. At the very least, it could be a distraction so their forces could hit us elsewhere.”

“With how light the resistance to our advance has been up until the last day or so, I have to agree.” Eve reclined in her chair, looking rather tired after the day’s endeavors, and I wondered how much more energy her body was using, now that she ate for two. “Our scouts report lots of activity on the border, especially to the north of Black Oak. Besides, we haven’t seen any of their main battle tanks in combat yet. Those didn’t just disappear, which means they’re holding them in reserve for something special.”

Josh smirked at the room, as if disappointed that no one had thought to bring his point up yet. “It’s easy for you all to say we shouldn’t try, but Kaba has saved dozens of lives from the Organs. He deserves the same effort from us. If the Organs do get information out of him, they could find our tunnels, the Castle, and our non-combatants. Most of the tunnel entry points are in contested zones, and if we can’t get to them in time, ELSAR could slaughter our families.”

To my left, Sarah picked at some dried blood that had worked its way under one fingernail. “Even if they don’t genuinely want peace, a ceasefire could give us time to shuttle more wounded out of Black Oak, and back to Ark River. There’s too much shelling here, I’m seeing gangrene cases popping up from dirt in wounds, and we’re having issues with fresh water. We’re losing people to preventable deaths, and if we could just get a 24-hour standdown, we could save most of them.”

“If they keep their word.” Ethan shook his head adamantly. “Which they won’t. They have no incentive to. And besides, if we let them evacuate the north, that takes pressure off the loyalists among them to end the war, because their families will be safe somewhere outside the zone, while ours are still here.”

Sarah threw him a dirty look. “I thought you Workers were all about helping the common people.”

He shot an angry curled-lip snarl back. “Winning *does* help them. It’s the only logical choice. I thought your Researchers were all about logic.”

“That’s enough, both of you.” With a heavy sigh, as if he’d known it would get to this point, Sean leaned with his hands on the edge of the table. “We’re not here to fight each other. If we want to win this war, and do it the right way, we have to show both our friends and our enemies we are capable of leading effectively. That means justice, diplomacy, and self-sacrifice. We have to protect the people, and deliver on our promises, or we’re no better than Koranti is. Yes, it’s a dangerous gamble, but I’m willing to risk it if it brings our victory closer.”

Andrea’s ocean-blue irises shone like stars, and I noted how she held Sean’s gaze for a moment, the two of them positively glowing at each other’s side.

*Oh, to be on top of the world when someone who looks at you that way. Man, I’ve never seen Sean turn hat shade of red. They’d be good together, especially to unite Black Oak and the countryside.*

Sean’s dark brown eyes broke from Andrea’s to float across the room to me, and he cocked his head to one side. “You’ve been rather quiet, Brun. You are one of the only people who’s ever gotten close to Koranti, spoken with him, seen his operation up close. Tell me, do you think we’re walking into a trap?”

Stomach full of nervous butterflies, I adjusted the leather war belt around my waist to distract myself.

“Koranti sees himself as a protector of humanity.” Clearing my throat, I focused on the green, blue, and black lines of the map so as not to face the eyes of everyone else in the room. “He believes what he is doing is good, because it’s supposed to stop the Breach from spreading. In his eyes, the ends justify the means, but he never gives anything unless he feels he has something to gain from it. If Koranti is offering the ceasefire, it might be legitimate.”

“Was his decision to leave you in his dungeons with the Organs legitimate?” Adam raised an unconvinced brown eyebrow at me.

“He’s built an organization so big, he can take over parts of our country without anyone batting an eye.” I dared to meet his eye, not so much in challenge but trust, as I knew the sword-wielding preacher meant the least harm to me of anyone. “But that means his portion of control gets smaller with each new group he brings into his camp. Crow and the Axillaries flouted direct orders to keep me locked up like they did, and I don’t think Koranti will forget it. He knows he can’t see everything that goes on, he’s got factions within his bloc as well, and they’re only working together out of fear of us. If we could broker a peace, maybe the Organs and professional ELSAR would turn on each other.”

Brow furrowed in contemplation, Sean flicked his eyes to Andrea, then Chris. “Can we count on enough long-range overwatch to keep things from boiling over?”

Chris scratched his head and nodded. “I can pull some good marksmen from the west, and we’ve got a machine gun team in reserve we can use. If we had any drones that could get high enough, I’d say this would be a great time to use them, but ELSAR would just jam them anyway. Who’s going to be part of the delegation?”

Sean surveyed the room for a moment, rubbing the stubble on his chiseled jaw. “Dekker, we’ll need you in reserve. If Ethan’s right about the ambush, we don’t want all our military commanders wiped out in one go. Same goes for both Stirlings; your people have already helped us immensely, and I don’t want to see your church leadership decapitated. Sandra, we need you with the wounded, whether the meeting goes well or not, so that rules you out. I’ll go, along with Andrea as the resistance representative, and Ethan as my second. Brun, would you want to be our fourth?”

*What?*

I blinked, my ears afire with surprise, and glanced around the room. “I . . . I’m not really in a position to offer anything. Why not Josh, or one of the civilian leaders from Black Oak?”

“Any of the locals we could trust are already in the resistance.” Andrea made a sympathetic grimace at my discomfort. “The civilian delegates might have cheered when you rolled into town, but trust me, they’re only interested in the side that can get their lights back on, their toilet flushing, and their heater working. As far as Josh goes, if this *is* an ambush, both he and I can’t be in the same kill-zone, or the resistance won’t have a leader. You’re the only one whose dealt with Koranti face-to-face, and you’ve worked with both the resistance and the coalition. Sean’s right, you should go.”

At my right side, Chris caught my eye and gave me a slight nod.

Anxious prickles ran down my back, and I dropped my gaze to my boots. The last time I’d seen Goerge Koranti, I’d been a prisoner, his property, a girl with no future ahead of her save for laboratory tests in a gilded cage. I swore to myself I would never be in that position again, but even now, with my submachine gun on one shoulder, surrounded by our armed forces, I didn’t feel safe just thinking of him. I didn’t want to go anywhere near Koranti . . . but the war effort required it.

*This could be the key to peace. I’d be selfish not to try. Besides, Kaba’s life is at stake.*

Outside, another howitzer barrage rumbled in the distance, the deadly payload whistling down to demolish yet another building somewhere. I could feel the faint shudder of impacts in the floor under my boots, tasted the residue of soot on my tongue, and the groans of pain from the aid station still echoed in my mind. This had to end, one way or another, before there wasn’t anyone left in Barron County.

Gritting my teeth against the uncertainty, I drew a deep breath. “Okay.”
