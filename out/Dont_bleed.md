I grew up living with my grandma, three uncles and three cousins. My grandma was very ill she had total kidney failure and was on dialysis three days a week, she also had some heart problems, sadly she passed away at the start of last year.

On this particular day it was just me, my grandma, my three cousins and one of my uncles because my other two uncles were at work. Anyways i was awakened by the voice of my grandmother shouting my name, it was about 6am and she just finished having a bath before she would go for her dialysis. As I heard her shouting my name I quickly jumped up from my bed and sprinted into the bathroom. The first thing i saw was a pool of blood in the bathtub, i told her to turn around to check where shes bleeding from, as she turned around blood squirted on my face and pyjamas. The blood was coming from her arm it was a little above her elbow on her left arm. Covered in blood I grabbed her arm trying to stop the bleeding but it was just wouldn’t stop. While putting pressure on her arm i started to dress her at least put on her bra and underwear so that i could call my uncle for help but i couldn’t do it on my own. I called out for my little cousin, she could have been about 8 at that time. As she entered the bathroom i could see the horror and shock in her eyes. I yelled at her for her to help me so she did. Once her bra and underwear was on I screamed for my uncle when he entered the bathroom he was in shock as all the walls were covered in blood and so was i, he immediately called the ambulance and he took over by putting pressure on her arm and trying to wrap it in a towel. 

With the phone in my hand and the operator asking “what’s happening “? 
I go to the other room to talk because it was so hectic i couldn’t hear my self think.  
“Hello” I respond,  they kept asking “is she breathing is she conscious”? I kept thing what a stupid question of course she breathing. I didn’t know what conscious meant i was 12-13yrs. When the paramedics arrived i felt a sense of relief like i could finally take a breath. They wrapped her arm up and took her to the hospital, i went with her because she couldn’t speak English and my uncle had to take my cousins to school and i was her favourite grandchild obviously. I was at the hospital with her from around 6:30am to 9pm by myself. Honestly I wasn’t even scared i mean it wasn’t my first time in the hospital, it was more like a second home since my grandma was there most of the time. I know that hospital like the back of my hand. 

This wasn’t the first time she almost bled out either but those times were a little different. Firstly it was kind of my fault. Not this time thouwgh
