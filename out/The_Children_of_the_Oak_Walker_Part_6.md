*Rrrriiinnnggg.*  
I jolted awake at the metallic clanging of my alarm clock and fumbled for it in the shadows of my room.   
My fingertips brushed the cold round hunk of tin, and it slid off the nightstand to land on the gray carpet with a resounding thud. I heard the clatter of a nut and maybe a washer fall off it, the device made by hand in the market from scrap parts. It had been cheap, but I still needed it to run my life as an on-duty ranger, and I let out a groan.   
“Stupid piece of . . .”   
Sliding out from under the warm covers felt like pulling against gravity, but as I picked up the white-painted clock, my blood chilled.  
2:56.  
*You’ve got to be kidding me.*  
With a yelp, I tumbled out of bed in a tangle of limbs and sheets, only to right myself to fly across the room. Jamie’s bed lay empty, as she likely wouldn’t be back from Andrew’s until tomorrow, so I had drawn the curtains to try and sleep. In my usual fashion, I’d fought to shut my brain off for a good two hours, and then somehow blacked out, only to wake up to a terrifying reality.  
Chris’s dinner was at 3:00.  
I’d overslept on our first real date.  
*What do I wear, what do I wear, gotta find something.*  
Stumbling through the dark, I yanked at the handles of the closet Jamie and I shared and pawed through the few hanging bits of cloth with frantic hands. I managed to find the switch for the single bulb nestled inside the closet and swatted it into the upright position.  
*Ow.*  
A barrage of yellow light blinded me, and I swore under my breath. “Thanks lightbulb, I didn’t need those retinas for anything.”  
Colors danced before my eyes as I retreated to my dresser to snatch up a green blouse and some blue jeans from among the selection. With the urgency of a soldier under fire, I dragged a pair of old sneakers Jamie had loaned me from beneath my bed and tucked her makeup kit under my chin.   
The next several minutes were a half-awake blur of running to the bathroom mirror, blinding myself with the light again, tripping over the towel I’d forgotten on the floor, and almost pulling my hair out with the comb. My clothes were yanked on, ripped back off when I realized they were backwards, and jammed back over my limbs again. I scrubbed my teeth like a NASCAR pit crewman at the tire station, and swabbed on a basic layer of lipstick so I didn’t look completely wretched.  
At last, I threw myself out the door and sprinted down the hallway of the lodge to the stairs. I had no doubt that I was late, that Chris would be horribly disappointed in me, that I looked ugly in what I’d picked out, but still I ran.   
At one point I slipped on one of the carpeted steps, and pain flared in my right shin, not enough that I’d broke it, but enough that I limped on like a cartoon pirate on a peg-leg. Grateful for the empty halls of the sleeping lodge, I hobbled onward down the corridor, cursing myself the entire way.  
*Thud, thud, thud.*  
Out of breath, I pounded on the door to Chris’s room harder than I meant to and tried to push some of the stray hairs from my face.  
*Of all the times to get frizzy static, why now?*  
With an oiled click, the doorknob on Chris’s room turned, and it opened to reveal him in a light-wash pair of jeans and a blue-and-green checkered flannel shirt with the sleeves rolled up.  
“Hey, there you are.” He beamed and swung the door wide to let me in, an amused grin crossing his face. “You okay? Your face is all red.”  
Suppressing the urge to gasp for more air, I made a deliberate effort not to limp past him on the way in and put on my best smile. “I’m fine.”  
His eyebrow rose, and Chris angled his head at my waist with a twinkle in his eye. “Is that your underwear?”  
*My what?*  
Stunned, I craned my head around to see a pair of lime-green panties hanging from one of the rivets on my back pocket, like a flag on a golf cart. They had to have been swept up in the chaos, and I’d not taken the time to see them. At the very least, they were clean, but they were certainly not the sexy kind of stuff I would have wanted him to see, and not like this.  
My face burned in the same thermal range as the sun, and I jerked the garment free to stuff it into my pocket. “No.”  
Chris cocked his head to one side, and the corners of his mouth grew broader in heightened jest. “So, someone else’s then?”  
It hit me how that response sounded even worse, and I shut my eyes, mortified. “Yes. I mean, no, they’re not. They’re . . . ugh, they’re mine.”  
His arms circled me, and Chris planted a kiss on my cheek with a low chuckle. “I heard you running up the hall. Like the charge of the Light Brigade. Someone overslept.”  
Embarrassed, but intoxicated with the heady vanilla and caramel scent that seeped out of his shirt, I ran my fingers over the buttery-soft material with a long sigh. “I’m so sorry. I didn’t think I was that tired, and I’m pretty sure I broke my alarm clock, and—”  
This time, his lips met mine, and Chris tucked a strand of loose hair behind my ear in a way that turned my brain to mush.  
“It’s fine, Hannah.” He held my gaze the instant we parted and led me toward the balcony. “Come on. You’re just in time, the steaks are almost done.”  
One breath was all it took for me to taste the mouthwatering aroma on the back of my tongue, the seasoned beef hissing and popping in the little propane-fired camping grill on the exterior ledge. To one side of the room, a couch stood where Chris’s old roommate used to have his bed. Darren had been killed by a mutant black bear the night my first patrol went awry, and since he’d been promoted, Chris had been living by himself. It was nice that we didn’t have to tip-toe around another person for our dates, but there were times where I could see Chris go to move something on a shelf, seem to realize it was Darren’s, and his face would fall in regret.  
*This looks nice though.*  
Eager to distract myself from such thoughts, I let my eyes fall on a small round table in the center of the room that Chris had set up, with two chairs opposite each other. True to his word, he’s spread a lovely red velvet cloth over it, and a few homemade candles burned in candlesticks at the center. The old record player in the corner already had a vinyl disc seated in the turntable, and I couldn’t help but smile in anticipation.  
“More Glen Miller, huh?” With the embarrassment fading, I sidled up beside him at the grill, and my stomach rumbled at the sound of hissing grease.  
Chris turned one of the sirloins over with a pair of stainless-steel tongs, the meat seared with perfect little black lines. “One of my *oupa’s* favorites. He used to play this all the time in the garage when he taught me to box. I guess it was my dad’s favorite too.”  
His voice dropped off a bit at the end, and it hurt to see the flicker of loneliness in his gaze. Chris’s parents had been killed in an accident when he was young, and for the majority of his life, he’d been raised by his elderly grandparents. He rarely spoke of his parents; it still hurt him, even after all these years, and despite my suspicions of Chris’s loyalties, I somehow knew that pain was genuine.  
I pressed my shoulder to his and drank in the handsome lines of his face, hoping for the sadness to dissipate from them. “Sounds like your grandpa was a real smart guy.”  
“Smartest man I ever knew.” Chris let slide a whimsical half-grin, and seemed to stare through the steaks, far off into a different place I couldn’t see. “He loved camping and hunting, taught me how to do both. I remember when asked him how come his fires always burned so well. *Oupa* says to me, ‘Fire is like a woman, boy-o. She don’t want to do it on the cold hard ground, and she don’t like being rained on. Build her a nice cozy bed, out of the wet and wind, and she’ll keep you warm all night long.”  
His face reddened a little at that last bit, but I could see the memories in his blue eyes, the warmth there. For my part, I couldn’t help but find his sheepishness charming, and the imagery of the metaphor played over in my head like a fairytale dream.  
*Does he ever think of me like that? How on earth would I ask him? Maybe I shouldn’t, now’s not exactly a good time.*  
“Is he the one who taught you to shoot?” I pivoted the conversation instead, remembering how Chris handled a gun, and how he’d cut down mutants and men alike with a fierce prowess that frightened me at times.  
“Soon as I could hold a rifle without falling over.” He went back to flipping the steaks, more out of mechanical reflex than culinary necessity. “Grandpa was a cavalry scout during the Bush War in Rhodesia. He could drive nails with his Remington, and he had an old Browning Hi-Power pistol that he trained me on. With everything else, Grandpa laughed and joked, but he never laughed when it came to shooting. Always had this look in his eyes, like he was half-there, half somewhere else. I didn’t understand it then. Didn’t know any better.”  
He went silent, and a Chris’s lips pulled into a grim, brooding line on his face, his shoulders hunched in contemplation. It occurred to me, standing beside him, that the young Chris was long gone; this Chris knew what his grandfather had known, and I understood, to a degree. The old Hannah Brun had died a long time ago, in the murky depths of the southlands, and I didn’t look at the world the same way anymore. Death could come from any direction, at any time, and you had to make the most of every peaceful moment, even if it was just to think in silence.  
Still, I hated seeing him so solemn.  
“You okay?” I dared to circle my arms around his waist and rested my head on Chris’s shoulder. “You seem kind of tense. Did I upset you?”  
“I’m fine, *pragtige*.” Despite his words, Chris’s jaw worked as if against some internal struggle, and he sprinkled spices on the steaks with deft taps of his finger on the can. “It’s just . . . today’s my mum’s birthday. I didn’t realize until I went to the market and saw the date written on one of the shop price boards. My *ouma* and I would always go out and put flowers on her and dad’s graves. With her and grandpa gone, and me here . . . it won’t happen this year. I know its stupid, I know it’s wrong, but feel like I let them down, you know?”  
*I would sell both of my kidneys to get you a free ride out of here.*  
With gentle fingers, I pried the tongs out of his hand, and pulled him close. “There are over 400 people who are better off for you being here, including me. If your mom could see you, I’d say she’d be proud. I know I am.”  
I meant to cheer him up, to make him flash that debonair grin and laugh, but instead he wound his muscled arms over my shoulders to hold me extra tight, as if the words had rocked him to his core.  
“Thanks.” He whispered, and to my absolute shock, Chris sniffled.  
*Did . . . did I make him cry?*  
Stunned, and wracked with immense shame over my blundering words, I clung to him as if my embrace could drive away the hurt. I’d only ever seen my father cry once, at his brother’s funeral, and even then, it had been momentary. My mother had always been the emotional one, sometimes over-emotional, but as an only child, it had never occurred to me that my dad had to have a breaking point. He just seemed indestructible, like a mountain of confidence and safety. Chris had seemed that way too, but now I found myself plunged into a new wave of reality; he was as vulnerable as me, just in different ways.  
My thoughts drifted to the accusations of Rodney Carter, of my need to get information from Chris, of how clear an opportunity this was. It wouldn’t be hard to manipulate this moment, tug at his wounded heartstrings until I found what I needed to know. He might not even know it was happening until . . .  
*Are you serious right now? What kind of witch-pig thinks that sort of thing? Even Carla wouldn’t stoop that low.*  
Ashamed of myself, I gritted my teeth in resolute fury, and squeezed Chris in my arms. No way I would do that, not now, not ever. I would sooner face the firing squad myself than play with his heart like a cat to a ball of yarn. He deserved better, and I refused to betray the man who had dragged me out of a pile of moldy shoes and into his life, even if it ended mine.  
Soft lips pressed to my forehead, and Chris pulled back to wipe his nose on his flannel sleeve with a twinkle in his watery eyes. “Food’s burning.”  
I jumped back in horror and spun to find the steaks awash in bright yellow flame.  
Chris snatched up the tongs, and deftly flicked the meat onto a nearby plate, clapping another overtop it to smother the fire, small clouds of white smoke curling up around our faces.  
“I am so sorry.” I stammered, ready to melt through the floor. How could I screw something up like this? “Chris, I didn’t mean to, I—”  
“It’s no big deal, Hannah.” He lifted the plate, and prodded at the sirloins, which were now half-blackened on one side. “They’re just a little scorched. I’m sure it’ll be fine on the inside.”  
*They were perfect until I distracted you.*  
He must have sensed my dismal thoughts, because Chris shut off the grill, turned to me, and snagged my hand in his. “No, no, no, that pretty smile isn’t going anywhere. Seriously, they’re not ruined, okay? Come on, you can help me with the salad.”  
At the table, we worked side-by-side with a few wide bowls to coat the green lettuce in a light drizzle of oil and herbs. Chris chopped up a fat red tomato he’d got in the market, one of the last for the season before it all got canned for the winter, and I tossed it in with two big wooden spoons. Cooking with him, even if it was as rudimentary as preparing a salad, side-by-side, in silence, gave me a cozy sensation deep in in my core that I relished. I could almost imagine us in our own kitchen together, with the sunlight flooding in through small windows over the sink, a nice tile floor and a big wooden table. Our own house. Our own space. Our own life, separate and insulated from all this.  
“I have been meaning to talk to you about something.”  
The daydream flickered out of my mind at his words, and I noted the way Chris focused on his blade work, almost as if unsure about what he had to say. “Yeah?”  
He paused for a moment, and then Chris’s shoulders seemed to slacken in resolution. “I’m going to try and propose a ceasefire in the Assembly.”  
I stopped stirring, and blinked at him. “Like, for the war?”  
“Yeah.” He scratched at the back of his head, then realized his mistake as a tomato seed got in his hair and wiped his hands on a dish towel to pick it out. “I know it’s a long shot, but I think we should send a delegation to ELSAR and try to negotiate a truce. We would have to vote on it, and someone would have to volunteer to act as ambassador, but I think it’s necessary.”  
My skin prickled, and I tried not to make it obvious how sick to my stomach I felt. If Chris was the spy, then this could be a way for him to warn his superiors of our plans, to avoid a defeat for ELSAR, and maybe even escape before he was found out. Then again, what chance did this plan actually have for success? I could imagine Jamie’s face if he had said something similar to her, and how she would have argued with him for hours afterward. No doubt the rest of New Wilderness would react the same way.  
*And he might not be the spy. Wanting peace doesn’t guarantee that he’s the one. Either way, I need to hear him out to keep his trust.*  
“Do you think the others would go for it?” I focused on the salad, tossing the leaves with the spoons to keep myself occupied as my pulse quickened.  
“Honestly? No.” Chris turned to press his lower back against the edge of the table, his forehead lined with wrinkles that hadn’t been there two weeks ago. “But I have to try. When I was younger, I read every book I could find about the Rhodesian Bush War, because I wanted to be closer to my *oupa*. The more I read, the more I realized why he never wanted to talk about it. War isn’t always a clean, noble, simple thing. The Rhodesian government under Ian Smith wanted to keep communism out since they knew it would lead to chaos, but they refused to let the black majority vote, because most of the black population supported communism. The rebels under Mugabe demanded open elections for all, which was only fair if they were to really be a free country, but refused to give up communism no matter how many warned it would be an economic and political disaster. Thousands of people died in the war, but once he won, Mugabe killed far more due to the famine his policies caused. Both sides were wrong, but since neither would admit it, they fought until Rhodesia died.”  
He inched closer to me, and I saw a desperation in his sky-blue eyes that I didn’t know Chris had, as he lowered his voice in a conspiratorial way. “We’re in the same boat, Hannah. We can’t beat ELSAR in a straight fight. We don’t have enough firepower, the rains are turning the ground to mud, and if we storm Black Oak, the number of civilian casualties will be unthinkable. Even if we could force them out, ELSAR is the only force keeping all the freaks inside Barron County, and not spilling out into the rest of the country. At the same time, we’re the only ones in the interior keeping the mutant population cut down enough for them to operate, so ELSAR can’t wipe us out without making their border defenses untenable. They can’t get to us with all the mutants in the way, and thanks to Ark River, we’re getting stronger than ever, but all that means is that this war could drag on for another year or more. Who knows what the Breach could do by then? If we don’t end this, it could end us, all of us. We have to sue for peace.”  
I didn’t know what to say. All of Chris’s points made sense, but at the same time, we were talking about the organization that was responsible for the bombing of Collingswood, the funding of the pirates on Maple Lake, and the murder of who knows how many good men from our ranger force. How could we make peace with ELSAR?  
*And who’s to say they’d even agree to it?*  
“I get what you’re saying.” I did my best to be tactful as I put the salad spoons down, fighting the urge to bury my face in his shirt front so I didn’t have to think about such things. “But Chris, you’ve never been more popular in the Assembly than now. If you get up in front of everyone and call for peace, they’ll hate you. What about all those great dreams, building a school, a library, a music program? You can’t do that if you lose your seat in the council.”  
The hope crumbled in his expression, and Chris hung his head with a defeated sigh. “So, it’s a stupid idea?”  
Unwilling to let him wallow in that disappointment, I ran a hand over his back and rubbed the tight muscles between his broad shoulder blades. “It’s a good idea, maybe even the right one. Just not the one the Assembly will want to hear. Maybe once we find the beacon, we can use it as collateral. ELSAR might be more open to talks if we trade it for a ceasefire, at least until the winter is over.”  
I said nothing of the spy of course, as I couldn’t bring myself to look at him and think about my secret plan. Getting the beacon back meant catching the spy . . . and that would likely end in blood. ELSAR wouldn’t appreciate the loss of their inside man, and the odds of them negotiating weren’t great.  
Still, they weren’t zero either.  
Chris put on a weary half smile and hooked a thumb into my belt loop to draw me to him. “Smart and pretty. I knew I liked you.”  
I rolled my eyes, but the breath caught in my throat when his lips grazed my jawline and followed an arc under my left ear. “I look homeless.”  
“You look gorgeous.” With a hungry rasp to his tone, Chris’s next kiss found the soft skin of my neck, sending lightning bolts through my veins.  
My brain fuzzed over, and I let him wind his fingers in my hair, tilting my head back so he could continue, the warmth in my core turning to molten-hot tingles all over me. Chris had old-fashioned views of messing around before a ring was involved, but I hadn’t minded, considering my complete lack of experience in bedroom matters. However, we’d been having more and more moments like this, bursts of all-consuming need that pushed the boundaries of our carefully set rules. If I loved the way he watched me walk, I’d never realized how much I craved the sensation of his warm breath on the nape of my neck, his hands on my waist, the way he pulled my hair. I knew he’d never hurt me, that he would stop the instant I asked him to, but a ravenous, wild shard of me crouched in the back of my conscience that didn’t want him to stop.  
I wanted more.  
I wanted anything and everything, even if the heat inside melted me to a puddle. I wanted the scent of his cologne on my skin, I wanted the taste of his lips on my tongue, I wanted to be woken up by his gentle touch instead of a rattle-trap alarm clock. I wanted him, so badly it almost hurt, and the temptation to rip into Chris dangled before my mind’s eye like a perfect char-broiled steak.  
“What’s that?”  
All the wonderful tingles slammed to a halt as I felt curious fingertips tug at the cord around my neck.  
*No, no, no.*  
Before I could say anything, Chris pulled the tiny key to my collarbone, and examined it with confusion. “What’s this for?”  
My mouth opened and close, but no sound came out. Panicked sweat beaded on my forehead, and I struggled to breathe, as if an elephant had sat on my ribs. “I . . . it, um . . . it’s . . .”  
*Thump, thump, thump.*  
We both jumped at the sound of a fist ramming into the door with rapid-fire pounding.   
Chris strode to the knob, and I didn’t know whether to call him back, or stay where I was. My mind still throbbed from the high of our brief moment, and a new fear rose like an iceberg to replace the flaming desire. What if the spy was at the door? What if I was wrong, and the real enemy agent had been listening in the entire time? What if they stabbed Chris the moment he opened the door, and then lunged at me?  
Half-frantic, I stuffed the key back down my shirt, and looked around for something to use as a weapon.  
*A gun, a gun, where does he keep his freaking guns?*  
The door swung open, and Chris stood aside for someone to enter. “Oh. Hey Jamie.”  
Paralyzed with bewilderment, I stared at her, and she back at me. I watched Jamie’s emerald irises take in the room, with its extravagant table, delicious food, and beeswax candles. Just for a moment, her expression rippled, as if someone had plunged a blade into Jamie’s guts and twisted it. There I stood, with her makeup on my face, her old shoes on my feet, ready to dine with the man that stole every ounce of joy and confidence from her face whenever Jamie saw us together. No matter how I tried to deny it, a part of me was certain she still had some shred of feelings left for him, if there had ever been something between them at all. On one hand, it shouldn’t have surprised her. She’d been the one to give me the green light, encouraged me to go after Chris, and she’d known we were having our dinner this evening. But that wounded light in Jamie’s eyes didn’t make it any easier for my conscience to accept, especially when I’d been thinking such amorous thoughts about Chris not five seconds ago.   
*If there is a circle of hell reserved for people like me, it’s probably hot enough to melt steel.*  
In another heartbeat, Jamie seemed to shake it off, and pivoted back to the door with a quick duck of her head. “Sean wants us at the front gate.”  
“What for?” I took a few awkward steps closer, somewhat relieved that I didn’t have to answer Chris about the key just yet but feeling infinitely worse at having to meet Jamie’s eye.   
“A patrol just came in with something.” Her shoulders slackened as if in exhaustion, and Jamie beckoned for us to follow her. “You aren’t going to believe this.”
