The next few hours were torture. My parents maintained a calm attitude for a little while, but after about forty-five minutes of the church staff and other parents searching around the church, I could tell they were beginning to get seriously worried. 

I myself was also looking for my little brother. I was looking in hiding spots we had used the few times we got away with playing during worship practice, and hide-and-go-seek was our go to. But I couldn’t find him. No one could.

After two hours of searching my parents sent me home with Alex Benson. He was A close friend of my parents and he was only eighteen so he would often play games with me and Josh with the same youthful vigor. Eventually he became our go to babysitter, and he was genuinely me and Josh’s favorite babysitter.

But that day when he had driven me home, we didn’t talk. I don’t think he was equipped to deal with a shell shocked kid who was obviously not processing the disappearance of his younger brother. 

And I didn’t talk because I had nothing to say, the only thing I could think about was Josh. 

Alex and I arrived at my house, he walked me in and plopped on the couch, while I went straight to my room. It was only three o’ clock, but I tried to sleep. I think I was hoping if I fell asleep I would wake up to Josh being found. Or maybe I would wake up and Josh had never gone missing. It was just a dream.

But sleep didn’t come.

Hours later I heard the front door open. For the first time since I had come home I left my room. Alex was standing next to my parents at the front door. They were handing him two twenty dollar bills as they patted his shoulder and thanked him for taking care of me.

Alex left and I slowly approached. 

“Did… did you find Josh?”

My dad looked at me, I saw sorrow and tiredness in his eyes, “Not yet Andy, we’re gonna go back in the morning. But I’m sure he’s alright.”

I didn’t believe him and I felt nauseous again, but I nodded and gave him a hug.

That night I didn’t find sleep for a long while. It didn’t help that I could hear my mother quietly crying in my parents room across the hallway.

I don’t know how late it was, I think around midnight, but I left my room to get a cup of water, but I froze as I was passing the living room. My father hadn’t noticed me. He was sitting on the couch facing away, he was shaking and his hands were clasped in front of his face. I could hear what he was whispering, and I could hear the suppressed sobs.

“Please, please not my boy. Please not my boy. I’ll give you anything, you can take my life, just please let my little boy be alright.” There was a bottle of whiskey sitting on the side table next to him. I didn’t know what it was at the time, looking back it was obvious alcohol was unacceptable to the church. And this was the first time I had ever actually seen it, but I would see it very regularly in the coming week.

“Dad?” I said stepping into the living room.

His head snapped toward me and he was wiping his nose and the streaks of tears from his face.

“Hey Andy.” His voice had calmed down, “It’s a bit late to be up don’t you think.”

“I couldn’t sleep.”

He let out an empty chuckle, “Yeah, me neither buddy.” He motioned to a spot on the couch next to him, “You wanna sit with me for a little bit?”

I nodded my head as I walked over and sat next to him.

“Dad?” I didn’t know how to ask what I wanted to ask.

“Yeah buddy?”

“Did Josh go to the same place George went?”

My dad looked tired and broken, and when I asked the question I saw tears gathering at the corners of his eyes, “I don’t know buddy, I hope not.”

“Dad?”

He looked at me.

“Is George dead?” I don’t know where the question came from.

“What? Where did you hear that?” my dad seemed to compose himself more.

“I don’t know, I was just thinking, you know, he’s been gone for a really long time.”

“I don’t know buddy, I…” his voice trailed off, he looked like he didn’t know how to talk to me, “Maybe, I don’t know. But Josh isn’t.”

“How do you know?” I could feel the tears welling in my eyes now, I hadn’t cried since Josh went missing, the reality was finally hitting me. 

My father couldn’t answer, he just repeated, “your brother is not dead.” and as he said it the tears began to flow.

I had lost control as well, and my father pulled me into a hug as we both wept together.

We cried for a long time. We cried until we fell asleep.

Days passed. Every morning my parents would wake up tell me they love me, then drive to the church and they would stay there all day. They told me I could stay home from school, and would have Alex periodically visit me, make sure I was ok, and make me dinner.

I saw less of my mother, but when I did it always scared me, she looked pale and lifeless. She looked as if she had cried every tear she had. As if God himself had picked her up and rung her out like a paper towel, leaving her white as snow, and as skinny as a skeleton, I don’t think she was eating.

The next Sunday was quiet, I stayed for the sermon again. I didn't feel like socializing. There wasn’t any big miracle or a cheering crowd. But I actually listened to the sermon this week. I hoped he would mention Josh but he didn’t, at least not directly.

As I get older I understand more some of the things that Pastor Matthew talked about and what they meant in light of what was happening.

This particular week he told the story of the ninety-nine sheep.

For those of you who don’t know the story, I’ll give you the short version. There’s a farmer who had one hundred sheep, and one day one of his sheep ran away and got lost. The farmer then leaves his ninety-nine sheep to go and find the lost one. He finds it and rescues it.

“You.” Pastor Matthew commanded the room, “You are the lost sheep, and Jesus is leaving the flock to find you. Don’t run from God. Don’t be a lost sheep, a lost child.”

The lost child remark cut through the air. My stomach turned, was he really using Josh and George as just an analogy, just a bullet point. No one else seemed to react, and that disturbed me more.

After church, Pastor Matthew approached my family.

“Hello my friends, do you have any news about Josh?”

My father looked up at him defeated, “No, no we don’t”

The pastor wasn’t bothered, or at least he was really good at hiding it, “Don’t worry Michael, your boy will be found, all that is done is done for the glory of God.”

“Yes of course, you’re right” My father’s eyes dropped to the ground.

“Well, you all have a wonderful evening.”

I remember my dad making a phone call on the way home from church that day. I only heard one side of it, but It’s pretty clear what it was about.

“Hello.”

“Yes hi, I was wondering if I could get another week.”

“It’s just, my boy…”

“I’m sorry.”

“Yes.”

“Yes”

“Ok, I’ll see you tomorrow then.”

“Goodbye.”

The house was very cold that night. After my parents had sent me to bed, I tried to sneak out of my room and go into Josh’s room. I don’t know why but I wanted to be there, maybe it would feel more normal there, like he was still there.

What I found in my brother’s room still brings tears to my eyes when I think about it. I wasn’t prepared, I don’t think anyone could be.

My mother was on her knees in the middle of the room. If she heard me enter, she made no indication. I could see one side of her face and the moonlight shone off her sickly pale skin like a fluorescent bulb. She wasn’t crying, she wasn’t moving, I couldn’t even be sure she was breathing. Her face was tilted up slightly. 

I didn’t want to enter the room, I was still very nervous around my mother. She had been different since Josh disappeared, and it scared me. But I felt like I needed to see if she was ok. So I slowly entered the room. I began to circle her and I noticed her eyes were closed. I stepped closer and put my hand out to touch her.

I let out a breath and one single word left my lips, “mom.”

Her eyes fluttered open and she looked at me, “Andy,” she said, she seemed loopy, and something resembling a smile crossed her face, “I’m, I’m sorry Andy.” her smile turned to confusion, and turned from confusion to fear.

I backed up, terrified of my own mother, and when I bumped into the door I fumbled around the wall to find the light switch. I found it, and flicked it on.

The image of my mother has not left my mind since that moment. She was now turned, looking at me with a panicked expression, her eyes were the only part of her moving, and they flicked around every part of the room. Her body seemed even skinnier now, she didn’t look like a person, she looked like a ghost. Her arms had fallen to her sides. In one hand she held a kitchen knife. And down each of her forearms there was a dark red stream of blood that even as I watched her continued to gush.

I cried out to my father as I fell to the ground. I didn’t understand the implications at the time but I kept asking myself, ‘why did she do this’. Why did my mom hurt herself, and I didn’t have an answer. I mean what kid really could process something like this

My father had rushed in, and when he saw what had happened, he pulled out his phone, dialed nine one one and scooped my mother into his arms. I watched as he ran her out of the room, and I followed him as he took her out to the car. 

“Andy, go inside now.” That was the most commanding I had ever heard my dad’s voice, and I did what he said.

As I sat on our living room couch all I could do was cry, and so that’s what I did. I cried for hours, I cried so hard that every muscle in my body hurt. I cried until our house phone began to ring.

I picked up the phone timidly, wiping my nose. “H-hello”

“Hey Andy it’s dad, I’m so sorry son, we can’t come back home tonight. Mom’s gonna be ok, but she needs the doctors right now. 

“What did mom do dad?”

My father ignored the question, “I just need you to be brave right now champ, hopefully I’ll see you tomorrow, if not Alex will come to the house and help you get ready for school.”

“Dad Why was mom bleeding.”

He ignored me again, “I love you son, please get some sleep, I’ll see you soon ok?”

Before I could say anything the phone hung up.

My mind swirled and, I assure you, I did not get sleep that night. Alex did show up like my dad had said, in the morning. but after one look at me, he told me that I wasn’t ready to go back to school. I can only imagine what I looked like.

So Alex stayed with me. He made me a breakfast that I didn’t eat, and he tried to find a show on the TV to take my mind off of things.

“Hey Alex.”

“Yeah, what’s up Andy.”

“Could you take me to the church?” I had a plan, if I could find Josh, then maybe my mom would be all right again, and she wouldn’t hurt herself any more.

“I don’t know buddy, your dad just wanted me to make sure you were alright.”

“Please Alex, Please, I need to go there, Please I just…”

“Alright, calm down bro I’ll take you, just… don’t tell your dad.” Thinking back I’m not sure why he agreed, maybe he felt guilty and just wanted to make me feel better. Maybe some part of him hoped we would actually find Josh. He really was like an older brother to us. I’m sure Josh’s disappearance was very hard on him too.

The five minute drive to the church felt slow, everything had felt slow since the night before. 

We had pulled up to the church and that nauseous feeling returned. The small church seemed to tower over us.

I stepped out of the car and looked up at the building that should be familiar to me, but it felt so foreign.

The sun had just begun to rise and it was positioned directly behind the monolithic building, displaying a ring of fire around the structure that towered over my small frame.

I had been thinking about all the places I could search on the ride over. Making a mental checklist of all the places Josh could be. During the drive I was ready. Now, as I stood in front of the burning altar to an angry God, I was terrified. 

Alex rounded the car and stood beside me, “Listen Andy, I’m ready to look, but you can’t leave my sight alright. We stay together the whole time.”

I nodded my head, it comforted me a little that I wasn’t going to be alone at any point, but the feeling of dread was still more prevalent. 

We slowly approached the church, and as we entered the door, I felt as if the church was simply waiting for us to pass through, before it closed its gaping maw and consumed us.
