My dad died years ago. I still remember the trauma. He died because of a car accident. I was only 6. I barely remember my dad now, but I remember the day of his death.

The event changed my mother. From a sweet, kind woman, she turned into a bitter, rude one. She stopped worshipping God. She removed every picture, book, or anything associated with religion from our home.

Today my mother lies on her death bed. 
She passed away at 4 am. In her last breaths, my mother conveyed cryptic words, "Conquers.. 24 hours.. His name.. Key.. Attic.. 100 years." She could not speak properly. But when she said all this, I felt a difference - she seemed sweeter again for a split second, like she was 30 years ago.

Right after that, something happened. Before I could process the grief due to my mother's death, I saw Him. I saw Him right in front of me.

Maybe it was a vision, but I believe I saw Him with my own eyes - a demonic, pitch-black creature with a twisted, sinewy frame, sharp horns that crowned its grotesque head, eyes smoldered with malevolence and limbs that ended in claws. He was terrifying. I saw Him right infront of me. Then, in a split second - He was gone. The most terrifying thing is, I think I saw Him... enter me?

As I held my mother's frail hand, I tried to put together what she was trying to say - 'conquers', '24 hours' - and then it struck me like a bolt of lightning. He had concealed Himself within my father's body all along. With His death, He swiftly took possession of my mother's body. My father, and my mother after his death, were Him all along. My mother, in her last moments, regained possession of her body and passed me her message.

Now,
I was next.

If what I believed what my mother was trying to say was correct, I had 24 hours before He fully 'conquered' my body. The only way to stop this was to make someone read His name because of me, and this could only happen once in 100 years (if I pass on my fate to someone with this method, then this method cannot be used for another 100 years). 

Processing my mother's death and having to do all the post-death procedures took my time. At one point, I also sat down and cried for my mother for, what I think was more than an hour.

I had less than 10 hours left. I believe my mother meant that His name was in the attic. I went there. There were too many things in the attic. I was hurryingly moving all the boxes away. Before I knew it, I fell asleep.

I had more than 2 hours left. I had slept for way too long. I panicked. I moved all the boxes, shaking. I cleaned the cobwebs - nothing. Where was it? I did not want to be taken by Him. Then, after what seemed like forever, I found a book - a book that looked extremely old. It was in the corner. I picked it up, I flipped through its pages - it was empty. 

Then, I saw the floor. I discovered an ominous etching on the floor where the book was kept. The book was hiding the name below it all along. For a second, I was immensely happy. Then, I realised, I had only 30 minutes left for 24 hours to pass. It was 3:30 am - everybody was sleeping. The only person I knew who could be awake was my friend addicted to playing games. But I wouldn't want Him to take her.

I had 30 minutes left. I panicked - what do I do? I was feeling unhealthy, I was feeling dizzy. It was like He was ready to take over my body. Then, it hit me. I could do something.

I went on the internet. It wasn't 3:30 am for everybody around the world, and atleast one person on the internet would read it in thirty minutes. 

His name was too long â€” Mortisvorax Obsidius Infernalis Marcerator Vortilion Diabolus Exanimo Sanguinivorus Draconius. To whoever I have passed my fate on to, I am sorry.
