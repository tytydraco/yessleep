 Hi Diary, it’s me, Evie. I turned 8 years old last week and mummy said that means that I am a big girl now. I also have a new favourite food, it’s watermelon! Over the weekend I went on an adventure with my dad. My mummy had a migraine and couldn’t take care of me, so my Dad decided to take me away to see a movie and sleep over at a fancy hotel for the night.

I never like going on adventures with dad because I always feel homesick, and I miss my mummy too much. Dad said that he would buy me lots of lollies if I went with him and Mummy said I had to, so I went. The movie we watched was very boring, it was a movie that my dad likes to watch. It was about the war and had lots of soldiers running around, I got to eat lots of lollies and popcorn and fell asleep in the comfy movie chairs.

Dad woke me up after the movie had ended and said that we needed to do a grocery shop before going to the fancy hotel. He picked up some shampoo for himself and told me that I could pick out whatever soap I wanted. There were so many options in the store but I knew exactly what soap I wanted to get the watermelon soap. It smelled like watermelon.

When we got to the hotel room, I was so excited. There was a bunk bed over an adult person’s bed! I’ve always wanted to sleep in a bunk bed. I pretended to be a pirate and climbed up and down the ladder, calling out to the other pirates from the top bunk, and bounced around to dodge the flying sharks. Dad got angry at me for making too much noise and jumping on the bed, so he said I had to sleep with him in the adult person’s bed. I started to get really homesick when he said that. I didn’t want to sleep with him, I hate sleeping in the same bed as my dad.

I got into bed with Dad, and he pulled out his phone to watch another movie. This movie was also boring and made me feel funny. There were naked people in the movie, doing weird things. Dad said they were just massaging each other. Dad said it was time to change into pajamas after the movie had finished. He went to look for my pajamas in the bag that he brought, but he kept pulling things out and saying bad words. He told me that he forgot my pajamas and that I should just wear my undies and singlet to bed. I really miss my mummy. 

I got changed into my “pajamas” and got back into bed with dad. I can never remember what happens after that, it’s just like all my adventures with dad, I forget what happens once I get into bed with dad. After I forget, I’m back in bed with my dad and all my clothes are off and dad is smoking a cigarette. I can see his yucky yellow nails and my dad is naked too. My dad always looks like a dragon when he smokes, dragons scare me.

Dad said it got really hot so that’s why we aren’t wearing any clothes. My homesickness is getting worse, and I start to cry for my mummy. Dad got really angry at me for crying and said that I needed to have a cold shower as punishment. I hate cold showers, he pushed me into the shower and turned the water on, my skin feels yucky and I get really cold.

He opened my watermelon soap and started scrubbing me with it until my skin was red, just like the inside of a watermelon. When I got out of the shower I dried myself with a towel as dad went in for his hot shower. I changed back into my “pajamas” and went to bed. I fell asleep before dad came back from his shower. In the morning dad gave me lots of lollies on the drive home. He said I was a good girl and that he loves going on adventures with me. I just smile at him because if I say I don’t like them he gets angry at me. Dad smelled like yucky cigarettes and that watermelon soap. I smell myself and I can still smell the soap, I started to feel homesick again.

When I got home mummy was all better. She gave me a big hug and said she had a surprise for me. She held my hand and walked me to the kitchen, she picked me up and put me on the kitchen counter. Mummy had bought a watermelon! Mummy cut it up for me and put a bowl of it beside me on the counter. I ate the whole bowl quickly and then threw it all back up again. Mummy looked at me strangely and asked why I threw it all up when watermelon is my favourite food. I told her that I hate watermelon now.

Goodnight Diary, I’ll write in you soon!
