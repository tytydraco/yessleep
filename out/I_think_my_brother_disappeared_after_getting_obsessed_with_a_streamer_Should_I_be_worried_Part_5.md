Feeling pretty exhausted, these late nights are killing me, so sorry for not updating yesterday. You can find the last part (4) [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/26KksbIpc6)

The next day, I tried to stick to my routine. I finished work, but when it came time to read my brother’s journal, I couldn’t focus. The cryptic writing felt heavier than ever, my mind too scattered to make sense of it. I stared at the same page for what felt like hours, thoughts drifting aimlessly, until the sharp beep of my watch pulled me back.

The stream was about to start.

I shook myself from the fog, setting up the laptop with practiced ease. The stream had become a constant in my life, an anchor that felt as steady as it was fleeting. No matter how unsettled I felt, Caitlin’s presence would soon fill the screen, and for a few hours, I could let everything else slip away.

As the countdown ticked away, I whispered the numbers aloud, almost like a prayer.

There she was.

Her smile was back—bright, warm, and impossibly perfect. Her eyes gleamed with the same playful, feline quality that made it feel like she was daring me to look closer. It was a sharp contrast to the exhaustion I’d seen in her the night before. Now, she seemed lighter, almost too light.

She looked better.

Much better than she should.

I swallowed hard, my pulse quickening. Had I been wrong about her? Maybe something had upset her last night. But now, something about her seemed different. Her gaze lingered on the chat for just a moment longer than usual, her expression softening as she scanned the usernames.

I couldn’t help myself. I typed, “Caitlin, you look much happier today. Did you get enough rest?”

Her eyes flicked downward, then back to the camera. Her smile widened, and her voice rang out, clear and unburdened.

“I did! I feel so much better today!”

A wave of relief washed over me. She sounded genuine—like the Caitlin I remembered. But something tugged at the edges of my thoughts, a quiet voice urging caution.

I typed again, “I hope you took a break today. Your streams are fun, but remember to rest after work.”

Her gaze locked with the camera, sharper now, more deliberate. She spoke with a giddy energy, explaining how she had taken the day for herself and visited a museum. Her voice filled with excitement as she described wooden carvings she’d seen—symbols she called oghams. The way she spoke, with such reverence, made it feel like these weren’t just artifacts but something far more meaningful.

“I wish I knew how to make some for myself,” she said, her tone dipping slightly. “But my hands were never very creative.”

My heart skipped a beat. Make them?

My eyes fell to my hands, calloused and worn from years of woodworking. A rush of excitement—or maybe pride—washed over me. I didn’t know much about oghams, but I was certain I could make them.

I typed into the chat, “I’m a carpenter. Would you like some?”

Her face lit up, her excitement spilling over. She thanked me repeatedly, her enthusiasm palpable. But as she spoke, her gaze felt too sharp, too deliberate. It wasn’t just that she was looking at me—it felt like she was looking through me.

For a moment, I wanted to close the stream, to pull away. But I didn’t. I couldn’t. Her voice wrapped around me, smooth and certain, pulling me back in. She thanked me again, mentioning her P.O. box for the first time.

The stream carried on with an infectious warmth. Caitlin’s joy was undeniable, and by the time it began to wind down, my cheeks ached from smiling along with her.

And then came the riddle:

“I stand tall but am not a tree,
I speak without sound, a language unseen.
Marks I carry, not of pen or ink,
But of wood and stone, where spirits think.
What am I?”

The answer came to me immediately. I felt as though I was cheating—it was obvious after everything she’d said. Still, I typed into the chat, “Oghams, right?”

Her praise was immediate, and her smile grew wider. As always, my answer was correct. But when I glanced at the chat, I noticed no one else had even tried to answer.

Were they even paying attention? I wondered. Caitlin was beautiful, sure, but was she truly that distracting?

The stream ended, and while my excitement urged me to start planning the project immediately, I knew I needed to approach it carefully. This wasn’t something I could rush. If I was going to do this, it had to be perfect.
