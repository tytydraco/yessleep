I woke up crossing the road. I was in the middle of the street mid stride when I was struck in the head. It wasn’t a dramatic scene. I didn’t fall over, I didn't scream and curse. I checked the growing goose egg on my head and there was no blood, but it was the shock of unexpected pain paired with the blurred vision of a head injury that left me stunned. Looking around, I saw a black-walnut, the size of a clementine rolling on the asphalt and realized this was the first thought I had in years. I left the sidewalk behind in a state of wakeful dreaming, and now I am overwhelmed by vibrant lucidity. I remembered things, but they felt distant, fading like a dream in the morning. It felt like I was inspecting the life of a stranger. 

Then the sudden realization I was still standing in the middle of the street holding my head. The two cars on either side of the crosswalk waited patiently, their occupants staring out the windshield in a dissociated haze. I quickly crossed the street. Neither person honked, yelled, or even rolled down their window to say something. I tried to force my atrophied mind to think, to trigger some sort of recall. The town looked familiar, and I had the feeling I knew where I was, but not in any solid lucid way. I began walking south, simply because my muscle memory was telling me to do so. 

I needed to ground myself, so I listed the things I knew. “My name is Lillian, I know how to drive. I was a champion marksman and I–”Things came back in a frantic rush. I remembered coming to this town to investigate a missing person. I think. Who was that person? Did I have a partner? The memories drifted from the center of my mind, like sand through open fingers.

I tried to trigger memories with the locations, smells, and sounds, but the center of town looked like the MainStreet of any rural village. Only it was quiet. The only sound was the spring birds chirping, the ringing of firearm induced tinnitus, and cicadas. I passed people on the sidewalks, and I smiled at them, trying to see if anyone showed the faintest hint of recognition, but no one said a word. 

This was off. Something was terribly wrong, but I didn’t have the courage to stop and ask someone. I didn’t have the memory to know if the silence they gave me was some sort of town ritual, and if I spoke, it would be a major taboo. 

Instead, I walked the direction that felt right, letting the body’s memory take hold. I walked by people trimming their bushes, mowing their lawns, and everyone had the same pensive looks. As if in intense concentration, but with nothing behind the eyes. This strange behavior became the focus of my attention. Every single person was like this, and another thing I noticed was that nearly every woman was at various degrees of pregnancy.

It reminded me of sleepwalking. My brother did it when we were kids, and he had the same blank expression. Everyone in this town was sleepwalking through their lives, and did not know. I…had no idea. How did it happen? Was there some kind of gas leak? Some strange chemical in the water? I kept ruminating as I walked and before long I found myself standing outside of a duplex, with a door that felt like mine on the left side. 

I entered with a key that fit in the latch, only to find that the handle was unlocked. That was unlike me. I obsessively locked my doors, and would double check them constantly. Closing the door, I secured it this time. 

Motes of dust floated in the air, illuminated by the rays of sun shining through the partially opened curtains. I knew I had been living here, but I felt the edge of someone trespassing and not wanting to get caught. I slinked through the apartment, afraid to say anything out loud, and terrified of what was around every corner. 

The place was empty, and it looked unoccupied. If there weren’t groceries in the kitchen, and laundry in the bins, I wouldn’t have believed I was living here. There were no pictures, no decorations, no personal touches whatsoever. Just bare white walls in every room. 

I had no memory of living in this place, but it was obvious I had been. Traces of my existence were in every room. I recognized my clothes, food I liked, and there was mail in my name. I wandered around the place that I guess was my home, hoping to jog something loose.

It didn’t work.

I found a landline mounted on the kitchen wall, and for a moment I had hope. I thought I could call my supervisor, my family, my partner, but there was no dial tone.

I deflated into the bed in the master bedroom, defeated. At least the mattress was comfortable, but the darkness was complete. In the city, there was never quiet, or complete darkness. At all hours, people were out living their lives in the bright city lights, and there was always the background noise of traffic. It was almost peaceful, except for the overwhelming sense that something, no, everything, was wrong.

I pondered on my situation, and my next step. I wondered if every person out there had this paranoid in their beds or if I was the only one.

I fought sleep, fearing that I would end up walking in that state between the worlds of sleep and wakefulness, but I was losing the battle. I slowly drifted off into a fitful sleep until I heard something. My eyes shot open, and waited, not sure if it was hypnagogic hallucination.

Then it came again, a firm knock, like knuckles on wood. I didn’t stir. I knew anyone trying to coax me outside this time of night didn’t have good intentions. 

Or maybe that was the city girl in me talking. This was a small town, and don’t small-town people help each other? Although if this was someone seeking help, their knocks would be more frantic, and they would shout as well, trying to get someone’s attention. Maybe it was the wind blowing a loose shutter or something. Then it came again, this time louder, in the same interval of three. Thump thump thump.

I told myself I would wait for the next time and try to see who was out there. That I wouldn’t be the person who let someone get murdered on their sidewalk because they were afraid. I wouldn’t be just a bystander. Only the knocks never continued. Only the sound of crickets and wind for the rest of the night. 

The next day, after I made sure there were no bodies on my front lawn, I continued my investigation of the unfamiliar house that was my home. 

Did I even have a job? A bank account? A purpose at all? 

I searched through the mail, found an electric bill in my name. This meant I had to have a job to pay for this. I searched through the drawers, bins, everything, for any kind of hint of how I got here and what I did. 

I was an FBI agent. It was a passion. Justice was something that struck home with me. I was a latina after all and had experienced plenty of discrimination and had seen worse. So when I found a nametag for the local grocery store that said “Hi my name is” and scrawled in black sharpie was my name. “Lillian” in my recognizably ornamental cursive.

What the fuck. I didn’t give up my twenties in college to work at a goddamn grocery store. I did my time in those types of jobs and nothing would make me willingly go back. Yet, that was unmistakably my handwriting, and pinned on the refrigerator with a magnet in the shape of a cow was my work schedule. Thankfully, my meticulous tendencies carried into this new life and I crossed off the days as they went. Yesterday, when my mind was thrust into consciousness, I didn’t have work. Today, my shift started in a few hours. 

I thought of calling in, staying all day at home to figure out what was going on. Then I remembered the strange behavior of the surrounding people. If I was in this strange fugue, maybe the others were too. What would happen if they were released from their somnambulation? Would they be as calm as I was? Would they fly into violent fits? Did someone here cause this? What would be the motive?

My mouth grew dry and after the third cabinet I found the cups, then as I filled it with water, it occurred to me that the water could be the source of my previous state. Tainted sources to apply hypnotic drugs to the populous. I stared at the water, looking for any sign of contamination. There was no smell, no particles, and no strange gloss. I dumped the water out and searched the contents of the fridge. 

Thankfully, I found some unopened water bottles. I squeezed them to make sure the seals were secure and there were no pinholes.

I wondered if I was being paranoid. If I was going insane. My previous life seemed so far away now, but I could clearly remember it. It wasn’t a phantasm of memory; it was real. I needed to find out how I got here, and why I came here to begin with. 

I searched for food next, and in the fridge, all the produce had a fine powdered mold on it. I checked my pantry, and every opened container had this fine powder on it, and I didn’t know if this was mold or a hypnotic drug..

I was starving, though, and needed to eat. I washed some fruit and when I glanced out the window of the kitchen sink and noticed there was an apple tree in my backyard. The apples were bitter, but were clean.

I found my work uniform, a QikMart apron, and got ready for the day. I didn’t know what to expect, but the well worn neural pathways from my years of sleepwalking. Trying not to think, I let my feet guide me. The town’s folks were out going about their business, but in a stilted, mechanical movement. Like automatons. A man mowed his lawn, his stare never straying from the grass in front of him. A woman pruned a bush with robotic precision. A couple jogged down the road, their faces expressionless. No one talked, interacted, or emoted. Stoic as a statue.

I crossed roads at the crosswalks, and the very few infrequent cars dutifully stopped to let me cross. There was no waving, no nods of acknowledgement, and no smiles. I grew up in a small town and knew the status quo. Everyone was outwardly friendly and, and half of them were genuinely kind. People waved to you, they said hi. There was always laughter, children playing, there was always some kind of life happening. 

Then the realization struck me. Where were the children? It was school hours now, but I didn’t hear any buses this morning, no kids walking on the streets, no bicycles, no basketball hoops and no toys in the yards. 

I felt my skin prickle. What was going on here? Nearly every single woman looked pregnant, and there were no babies or toddlers? Actually, I couldn’t say I ever saw anyone that wasn’t an adult.

I made it to the QikMart grocery store, which was like every small town market I had ever seen. The glass door chimed, and the cashier at the first of three lanes turned to me and then turned back to staring at the wall. Their robotic gesture gave me a chill, but what unsettled me more was the pristine nature of the store. The staff had perfectly placed every box, can, drink, and candy bar. They even polished the floor. The eerie part was the fact there wasn’t a single sound other than the Muzak coming through the PA. 

I walked to the back, knowing where to go simply for having done this for years before. There was a wall mounted machine, where I typed in my employee code, my name popped up and the option to clock in. I then walked over to cash register two and mimicked the man at cash register one. I stood motionless, staring at ahead of me. 

I had to be careful. The conformity had a pretense of a subtle threat. I couldn’t help but wonder if these people like me, falling in line because they were scared? Scared of what, though? I had to be here for a reason. I tried to recall why the bureau sent me on assignment here. The last thing I remembered was a normal day. Paper work, coming home to my empty apartment, having Chinese delivered, and watching Netflix. 

Where was my cell phone? Was there even internet here? The phone line was dead in my house, and the TV only had static. I needed answers, and I would not get them standing here. Only I wasn’t sure what would happen if I didn’t fall in line. 

I stood still, trying my best not to fidget, trying to retrace my steps onto how I arrived here. Customers came and went, and every interaction was stiff, mechanical and concise. No one spoke, they gave exact change every time, and left without a word. 

I counted down the minutes to the end of my shift, and like everyone else, I robotically left, clocking out without saying a word. The outside air was growing cool as the sun sank towards the horizon and even with the uncomfortable chill, I took a longer route home. I turned onto the side streets, and my early observation continued to hold true. No signs of any children. Other people were walking or driving home from their jobs, or doing other evening chores. I could smell food emanating from homes as the residents made their dinner. I wondered if even in private they stared at the walls with that glassy-eyed vacant expression. If the people living here were even people at all. I had to know. I just needed an opportunity. As the shadows grew long and the sky darker, I turned a street and ended up in the center of town. 

It was a picturesque place, something out of a hallmark movie. The multicolored mixed-use buildings were bustling with people walking like ants in a colony. No one spoke, and no one touched. The same hive mind, perfect efficiency as ants. 

I tried to mimic them, to walk in the mechanical purposeful motion they did without my gaze drifting to either side. Mostly, I was successful, using my peripheral vision to scope out everything around me. 

From a far it would look completely normal, the street lights sending their warm sodium glow to the streets, the shop windows illuminated from within. Moths and other bugs were dancing around all the sources of light. This was a facsimile of a town. It wasn’t real, no matter how hard it tried to look like it. The most peculiar thing was the quiet. If it wasn’t for the storefront music, the only sound would be the town’s people’s footsteps. 

Then an awful howl of pain cut through the evening, and I nearly jumped out of my skin. I recovered and kept walking at the same pace as I was before, but my heart was racing and my eyes darted about, looking for the source. Then the scream came again, this time louder and unmistakably human. 

I continued knowing that I was going walking right towards the source of the pained shouts. No one else around me reacted to the sound, and the longer it went on without repeating, I doubted I heard it at all. I only had to wait a couple more minutes before I located the source and gaped in abject horror.

A man hung from a light pole, and at first I thought he had been suspended by a rope around his hands. Only as I got closer, I could clearly see there was no rope wrapped around his wrist. A large meat hook penetrated both arms between the radius and ulna. The weight of his body was ripping his arms in half as gravity pulled him to the ground. Blood ran over his body and dripped into a scarlet puddle on the pavement, shimmering from the lights glowed. 

I stopped, horrified by what I saw. A scream was building up in my throat until I heard a woman behind me whisper to keep walking, and to follow her. She walked past me, and I did as she said. The man screamed in pain as we walked down the street. The wind carried the copper smell of blood and I had to force myself not to gag. 

Once we were a suitable distance from the center of town, she pulled me aside off the street behind a house. She told me she lived here and had a very similar story to me. No memory of how she ended up here, only that one day she was aware for the first time. She had been playing along for a few weeks and her memories came back slowly. 

I asked her what was causing this and what was happening to that person. She said he was someone who just wandered through, and they always had executions like that because it would flush out others that weren’t hypnotized. 

Like I had observed, most of the town folks didn’t react to anything, and the only way to find intruders or people who could think was to lure them out. 

The woman told me to not answer my door if anyone knocked at night. She had seen some men walking down the street in the dark, but she couldn’t be sure if it was them. She thought it could be something far worse. There have been many executions since she woke up. People would come into town, disappear and either reappear as residents or suspended for everyone to see.

I asked her what we should do, but she didn’t know. So I told her to observe, and notice as much as possible and we would meet up again the next evening and come up with a plan.

I walked back to my unfamiliar home and felt like I was being watched the entire time. Every so often, I would gaze at a window but see nothing inside. Then at the sewer grates, and I couldn’t help but wonder if something lurked below. I stared so long at the darkness that it began to squirm and writhe. I walked away, not wanting to find out if it was my mind playing tricks or not.

When I got back to the house, I locked everything up tight and undressed for a shower. This was the first time I really looked in the mirror since waking up, and I looked older. Not significantly, but enough to wonder how long I had been a resident here. The most alarming thing I noticed was a strange yonic scar below my belly button that was never there before. 

I ran my fingers over the puckered flesh, staring at it in the mirror. It was fairly recent, but the incision was so small that it was barely noticeable.

What the hell did they do to me? How long have I been here? I scorched myself in the shower, trying to burn away any corruption this town put on me. Every time I shut my eyes, I saw the man suspended by those hooks. In the sound of water dripping on the shower floor, I heard his screams. In the quiet susurrations of the towel running over my skin, I heard his flesh ripping as the weight of his body fought against the fibers of his skin. 

I laid in bed and tried to remember why I was here. Some things were coming together, the memories stitching back together like an old wound. There was an assignment, something unusual. Yes. It was coming back to me. We had a tip about human trafficking. Missing persons, and other shady stuff. 

I came here with a partner, Agent Balcerski. Where was he? The knocking at the door interrupted my thoughts, and I remembered what the woman had told me before. Don’t answer the door. 

Only the knocking became louder than before, and more insistent. I looked around the room for something to improvise as a weapon. The next barrage sounded like a person slamming their fist against the door. I could feel the impacts through the floor. I grabbed the floor lamp and felt confident its weight would be enough to stop someone. I didn’t have a chance to test the theory, though. The knocks ceased, and the night was completely silent again. 

Sleep didn’t come easy, and when it did, I dreamt of my partner, crucified in the town square, and about a child being torn from my belly and given to a slithering darkness underground.

I took a different route to work the next day, trying to map out the town mentally, but also to look for any clues about the town. My observations so far were that everyone was robotic. There were no children, nearly all the women were pregnant, and they publicly executed people to find others like me. Also that I had a strange scar that I couldn’t explain. No matter how hard I tried, my memories of my life here were distant and vague. Like trying to look through frosted glass. 

I focused on the present. On the problem in front of me. Observations. The town was pristine. Every lawn mowed, every house clean, there were no shabby neighborhoods that I could see. No, obviously abandoned buildings. It was picturesque, peaceful, and quaint. It was also completely phony. The next thing I noticed was the abundance of mushrooms. The area was prone to rain, like most towns in New York. Yet it hadn’t rained here that I could remember and there were still these fungal growths everywhere. Not a variety either. They were all white opalescent puffballs, like thousands of spongy pearls grew from the earth.

I was no mycologist, but they didn’t look right to me. They were secreting a viscous white fluid that I didn’t dare touch. Once I noticed their presence, I couldn’t stop. Every yard had mushrooms. Sometimes just a couple, some formed rings, and other times dead trees were bursting with the things. I did not know what to make of it and didn’t know if it was even remotely relevant. 

I eventually meandered my way into the store right on time and took my spot, staring ahead of me. A short time later, out of the corner of my eye, I saw a car pull up and park. This wasn’t unusual, but what was unique was the fact that the woman that got out of the car was holding the first cell phone I had seen since I had awoken. 

She walked towards the store and then, like someone pressed play, the man in front of me came to life. He began wiping down his counters. Another person who was stocking shelves whistled and bounced to the tune. I took this cue and tidied up my work area, despite it being immaculate.

The woman that walked in was wearing a floral sundress, large sunglasses and was extremely pregnant. She expressed disbelief at the fact there was no service in this town. Not even a Wi-Fi connection. The man in front of me, who kindly introduced himself as Steve, spoke about how the town was behind the times. The woman said she just needed some water and snacks, then proceeded into the store. 

My hands were shaking. This could be the only chance I would get to talk to someone from outside the town. I didn’t know how to approach it with everyone watching. I ruminated over what to do, what to say. Should I write a note? Follow her out of the store? I spent so much time pondering on my next step I didn’t notice her leaving. There was no more whistling or any other sound. She was gone, but upon looking out the window, I saw her car. 

Where did she go? I looked around and the staff resumed their stiff facsimile of what humans do, and I did the same, hoping to blend in. I couldn’t help but wonder what had happened. Did she get attacked? Killed? I kept waiting, hoping that she turned up, but she never did.

The sun was getting low, and my shift was up. I walked to the back of the story to clock out, and instead of leaving right away, I wandered around to see if I could find any trace of the woman. Of course, I found nothing. Just rows of perfect items, all placed with their labels out facing the same way. 

I pushed open the free hinged doors into the stockroom to look around. Gratefully, it was empty, but I noticed something disturbing once I entered. There was a metal hatch on the cement floor, and I could tell by the discoloration on the handle that it was frequently used. I lifted the hatch slowly, and it opened noiselessly on well-greased hinges. The hole below is pitch black, and I had no flashlight, no phone, and nothing to improvise a light source. I knew I had to come back prepared. I lowered the hatch and had a quick glance around the stockroom. There was a bin of broken down cardboard boxes, and I used this as an excuse to use the back door. I took the bin out to the dumpster, but before I finished, I placed packing tape over the latch on the door so it wouldn’t automatically lock. 

I left and walked a different route than the night before. The other woman, I really had to get her name, said to meet on the same street around the same time. I took this opportunity to scope out more of the town, and I discovered little. All the houses looked similarly well maintained. Everyone went about their routines with robotic efficiency, not acknowledging me or anyone else.
