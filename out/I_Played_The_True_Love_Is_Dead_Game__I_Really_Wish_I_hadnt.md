"Pucker up, buttercup!" Zach said as he staggered towards me with the worst case of duck face I had ever seen.

"Gross, Zach - get off of me!" I said as I pushed him away. 

I had just recently discovered my boyfriend of nearly 2 years had cheated on me. As you can imagine, I was crushed. My small group of best friends had arranged tonight to cheer me up. 

After a bit of bar hopping, I had a fading buzz and felt no better. I was half way watching my much farther gone friends play a drunken game of "Spin the Budlight Bottle". Apparently, Zach's spin landed on me. 

"Cut it out, yall!" Darcy scolded, "We forget we're here for Janie! Not games we played when we were 13!" 

I smiled at Darcy. She was truly my ride or die. She chose to sit the game out and relax on my bed with me.

"She's right." Sammie said, getting up off the floor of my small apartment bedroom. "Let's do something different."

"Different?" Zach said, nearly slurring his words. "Got you! Let's play "The True Love Is Dead Game!" 

Slience fell over the group. "The True Love Is Dead Game" was based off of local legend. Apparently,  a man named Victor Swanson was killed many years ago after stalking his first ever love who cheated on him. You could summon him by playing the game, so they say.

"No way!" Sammie said as she now joined me and Darcy on my bed. "Sarah Diricoh lost her mind after playing that stupid game! Swore Victor was after her!" 

Jackson finally spoke up, "I'm with Sammie. That game is trouble."

"Oh, come on! Sarah was nuts long before the game! And Janie could use a man that's obsessed with her!" Zach said before taking another swig of his beer. 

Darcy gave Zach a look that could kill but he didn't even notice. "You're a prick, Zach!" She nearly yelled. 

The four of them started bickering while I sat in thought. "I'll do it." I said interrupting the growing arguments. Maybe I was drunker than I thought. 

"That's my girl!" Zach beamed with pride. "To the batmobile!"

The "batmobile" was really Jackson's second hand van. We were making the drive to the oldest cemetery in town after deciding Darcy was best to drive.

We pulled into the rough terrain of "Bastin's Cemetery" when Zach turned to look at me. "Remember, you have to lay directly on Victor's grave and chant "True Love is Dead, let it live again!" Three times at exactly 3:00am! The witching hour and when Victor was killed!" 

I rolled my eyes as I got out of the van. If Zach was sober, he'd know I knew the rules. As we walked through the old bone yard, I wondered if this was a good idea. We stopped at the grave the farthest from all the others. Years of neglect had made the crumbling headstone unreadable.  

"2:58am!" Zach shouted, "Hurry! You gotta lay down quick!" He finished. 

I threw myself on top of the bumpy, cold ground directly under the old headstone. "We'll be back after 3:00am! Don't forget the words!" Zach said as the group scurried away. 

I stared up at the stars before checking my smart watch. I watched as the time displayed 3:00am. 

I closed my eyes tight and shouted three times into the night:

"TRUE LOVE IS DEAD, LET IT LIVE AGAIN!" 

After the third and final chant, I stayed silent, eyes tightly closed. Waiting for anything.  

I listened for several seconds to the random sounds of the night around me. 

Just as I was about huff about how stupid this was and get up off the ground, I felt a tight grip latch around my ankle and roughly jerk my body away from the grave. 

My eyes flew open and I began screaming and kicking at the figure dragging me, "GET THE HELL OFF OF MEEE! DARCY! GUYS! HELPPPP!" I squalled! 

I finally felt one of my kicks land a successful blow to the figure followed directly by a familiar voice yell out "Shit, Janie! That hurt!"

Zach immediately released his grip on my ankle to hold his right hand he had been dragging me with. "Seriously, fuck you, Zach!" I screamed at him as I stood up off the ground. 

An argument between me and Zach started as the others joined us, trying to calm the quickly escalating situation. 

Just as Zach was trying to pull me into a hug while trying to also apologize, a rock came hurling through the air out of nowhere, striking Zach on the shoulder then falling to the ground.

Zach cried out in pain as I quickly backed away from him. "What the hell was that?!" I demanded as I looked at the others. They all looked genuinely shocked. 

"The rock.. it came from over there! None of us moved! It came out of the dark! Out nowhere!" Sammie was nearly crying. 

"It's true! Someone else has to be out there!" Jackson said looking terrified.  "Everyone get to the van, NOW!" Darcy roared.

We didn't hesitate to follow her command. We ran through the cemetery nearly tripping over each other. We dove into the van with Darcy jumping back in the driver's seat and flooring it onto the back road. 

Sammie checked on Zach's shoulder, a deep bruise was already forming. "I should've beat whoever was out there's ass!" He said, in between grunts of pain. 

The rest of the ride was a blur to me. All of us were very much sober by the time we arrived back at my apartment. Jackson took Sammie and Zach home and Darcy stayed over as planned. 

After climbing into bed absolutely exhausted, I soon felt Darcy slide in next to me and gently rub my back. I heard the words "My true love" whispered in my ear just as I fell into a deep sleep. 

My dreams were plagued with screams, the sounds of gunshots and a tall handsome man following me in every scenario. I awoke with start to see the sun rays slipping through the blinds of my bedroom window. 

I rolled over to find the bed empty. I slowly tip toed out of my room to find Darcy sitting up on the couch, still wrapped up in one of my spare blankets. 

"Mornin' sunshine!" She said while stretching. "Your couch is shit for sleeping."

".....you slept out here?" I questioned. "Yes, after showering, you were sprawled out completely out cold and I didn't want to wake you." She answered flatly. 

My thoughts went back to the night before, the back rubs, the weird whispers in my ear. I must have been dreaming. 

"Zach called..." Darcy continued pulling me back to reality. "How is he?" I asked. 
"Still banged up. He's pretty sore, but that's not why he called." She said while looking up at me strange. "Go on." I urged. 

"He got a weird voice mail. Lots of static and then a weird growling sound. He said whispers was also in the background but he can't make out what they are saying... he thought we did it as a prank." 

"Why after such a traumatic night would we do that??" I asked irritated. "Basically what I said." She answered. "What's really strange is he said there's no record of a missed call or anything. No call back number." She finished. 

"Crazy!" I said as I stretched myself. "We should go over and check in on him. Let me get dressed." I said as I turned to head back to my room.

I stopped dead in my tracks when I entered. There was a single handpicked daisy on top of my pillow. That was not there when I woke up, I wouldn't have missed it! Darcy was in the living room the whole time with me! How did it get in here! 

Darcy entered the bedroom then, "hey, can I borrow...." she stopped as she noticed me picking up the random flower. 

"I never should have played that game..."
