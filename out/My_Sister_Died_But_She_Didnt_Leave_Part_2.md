**My Sister Died… But She Didn’t Leave. (Part 2)**





Ella didn’t stop.

It began slowly, like a nightmare leaking into reality. We felt her everywhere—in the silence, in the dark, in the creaks and whispers that crept through the house at night. I tried to ignore it, hoping it was just my imagination, but deep down, I knew. She was still here, lurking, watching us, waiting for something.

The next was Sarah. My cousin was always distant, quiet. She didn’t join in the cruelty, but she never stopped it either. She told me one evening about the strange sounds she kept hearing—soft rustling from the curtains, footsteps on the stairs, faint whispers that seemed to follow her no matter where she went.

"I think I hear her," she said, her eyes wide and bloodshot from sleepless nights. "But it’s... different. She sounds angry. At me."

I didn’t know what to say. What could I say? We all knew what had been done to Ella.

The whispers started to plague Sarah constantly. She’d wake in the middle of the night to find her bedroom door cracked open, even though she always locked it. In the bathroom, when she looked in the mirror, she’d swear she saw Ella standing behind her—just for a second, before disappearing. She was afraid to tell anyone else. They would think she was going mad.

But I knew. I saw it too.

One night, Sarah woke up to the sound of someone crying. It was faint, almost childlike. She thought it was coming from the hallway, but when she opened her door, the sound was inside her room.

"Why didn’t you help me?" the voice whispered.

She ran out of the house that night, refusing to return.

She still haunts my aunt.

She had always been the worst. She locked Ella in the basement so many times, always screaming about how she was a burden, how she ruined everything. I wasn’t surprised when it came for her next. She had nightmares about Ella, about the basement—about being trapped down there with her. Every night, she’d dream of the door slamming shut, the lock clicking into place, and Ella’s voice echoing in the dark.

"Let me out."

She told me about the dreams over coffee one morning. Her hands were shaking, and she looked pale, gaunt, as if she hadn’t slept in days. She wouldn’t look me in the eyes, just kept staring at her cup like it held all the answers she didn’t want to find.

Then, the waking visions began.

It started with seeing Ella’s face in every reflection. In the windows, in the mirrors, in the TV screen when it was off. Always staring back at her with that cold, empty expression. But the worst part was the basement. The door wouldn’t stay closed. No matter how many times she locked it, she’d wake up to find it wide open, the darkness beyond beckoning her to come inside.

She swore she heard someone scratching at the walls down there, calling her name in the dead of night.

Then, one day, she found something scratched into the basement door:

*"Come play with me."*

The entire family was on edge. No one would say it out loud, but we all knew what was happening. Ella was still here, haunting us, tormenting us for the years of cruelty we had inflicted upon her. We were being punished.

My other uncle started hearing things in the attic—heavy footsteps, dragging sounds, like something was being pulled across the floor. At first, he thought it was just raccoons or rats. But when he went up there, he found nothing. Except for a single word, scratched into the wooden beams:

*"Guilty."*

He boarded up the attic after that. But it didn’t stop. The footsteps continued, louder now, as if something was pacing back and forth just above our heads, growing more agitated with each passing night. He started hearing whispers, too—just like Sarah had—only his were darker, more sinister. They didn’t ask why he didn’t help. They told him what was coming.

*"Soon."*

No one could sleep. No one could eat. My relatives jumped at every creak, every gust of wind, every flickering light. The house itself felt alive, like it was breathing—feeding off our fear. But it wasn’t the house. It was Ella.

My mother was the one who started all of this. She was the one who whispered to Ella before they closed her casket. She was the one who told Ella to take her revenge.

And she was the one who vanished next.

I woke up one morning to find her bed empty. At first, I thought maybe she had gone out early, but her car was still in the driveway. Her phone, her purse, everything was untouched. She had just... disappeared. No note. No sign of a struggle. Just gone.

I checked every room, my heart pounding, my skin crawling with fear. But there was no sign of her. Until I reached her bedroom.

The walls were covered in scratches, deep and jagged, like someone had clawed at them desperately. And written above her bed, in the same jagged letters as before:

*"She’s here."*

The rest of the family began to unravel. No one wanted to be alone in the house anymore, but even when we were together, the fear clung to us like a heavy fog. Every shadow seemed to hold something just out of sight. Every breath felt like it could be our last.

I tried to leave one night. I packed a bag and headed for the door, but when I grabbed the doorknob, it wouldn’t turn. It was locked. Not by a key, but something else—something unseen. I tugged and pulled, but it wouldn’t budge. And then, I heard her voice.

*"You can’t leave."*

The lights flickered, and in the brief flashes of darkness, I saw her standing there. Ella. Pale, lifeless, staring at me with hollow eyes. But she didn’t speak again. She just watched. Waiting.

Now, it’s just me. The others have all left, but I can’t. I don’t know why. Maybe it’s because I tried to help her once. Maybe it’s because I didn’t join in the cruelty like the others. Or maybe it’s because she’s saving me for last.

The whispers are louder now, more insistent. They follow me everywhere. At night, I hear her footsteps in the hallway, slow and deliberate, coming closer and closer. I feel her eyes on me, watching from the darkness.

And then, last night, I found something new. Scratched into my bedroom door, in those same jagged lines:

*"You’ll understand soon."*

The house is quiet now, but I know it’s not over. She’s still here. She’s always been here. Waiting. Watching.

I don’t know what she wants anymore. Revenge? Justice? Or something darker, something more terrifying. All I know is that I can’t escape. None of us can.

Because she’s still here.

And she’s not done yet.
