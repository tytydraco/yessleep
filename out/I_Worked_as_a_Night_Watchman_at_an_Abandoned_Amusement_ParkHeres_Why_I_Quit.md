My name is Jerry, I’m 36 years old, and for most of my adult life, I’ve worked various jobs. I’ve been a security guard, worked at gas stations, in warehouses, and even helped out at construction sites for a short while. But none of those jobs were as strange as the one I took a few months ago.

It all started when I lost my previous job. The security company I worked for went bankrupt, and I was left without a source of income. At first, I thought I’d quickly find something new – after all, I had plenty of experience in the field. However, after a few weeks with no solid offers, I started to worry. Bills were piling up, and I was losing hope.

Finally, while browsing local ads, I came across something that seemed too good to be true. "Night watchman wanted. Abandoned amusement park, immediate start. Attractive pay." The ad was short, but the salary offer was really tempting. There were no details, just a phone number. I figured this might be my chance, so I called right away.

A man with a deep, raspy voice answered.

"Bill speaking," he said dryly.

"Hello, my name is Jerry. I’m calling about the ad for the night watchman job at the amusement park," I replied, trying to sound as professional as possible, though I was a bit nervous inside.

"Ah, right. When can you start?" he asked, wasting no time on formalities.

His directness surprised me. Usually, recruiters ask about experience, references, or why you want the job. None of that here. The guy just asked when I could start.

"I can start today if needed," I quickly replied, trying not to sound too desperate.

"Great. Let’s meet at six at the park. You know 'Sunny Valley,' right?"

"Sunny Valley." Of course, I knew the place. Back in the 90s, it was one of the most popular spots around. Everyone knew it. Rides, a Ferris wheel, a haunted house, everything kids love. But ever since the park closed down about ten years ago, it had stood empty, falling into disrepair. Rumor had it that the closure had something to do with an accident on one of the roller coasters, but I never saw any official reports.

"Yeah, I know where it is," I replied.

"Great. See you at six," Bill said, hanging up without waiting for any further questions.

There was something odd about that conversation. On the one hand, a night watchman job at an abandoned amusement park sounded like an easy way to make quick money, but on the other hand – no formalities, no questions about experience – it all seemed suspicious. Still, I needed the money, and under the pressure of debt and a lack of prospects, my mind easily pushed aside any doubts. I decided there was no point in overthinking it. I’d just go, see what the job was about, and then decide.

At around six in the evening, I arrived at the park. "Sunny Valley" looked even creepier than I had imagined. The gate was locked with a padlock, and behind the rusted bars, you could see faded, colorful signs. The grass around the entrance was overgrown, and some of the buildings looked like they were about to collapse.

I parked my car in a small lot next to the entrance. The clock in my car showed exactly 5:55 PM, so I was a bit early. I got out and looked around. The whole area was completely silent, except for a light breeze rustling the leaves of the nearby trees. There was something strange about that silence. The park looked as if time had stopped. As if no one had been here for years.

I leaned against the hood of my car, took out a cigarette, and lit it. The sun was slowly setting, and with each passing minute, the park looked more and more unsettling. Just as I was finishing my cigarette, I heard the sound of footsteps on the gravel path.

I turned around and saw a man walking toward me. He looked to be about fifty years old, wearing an old leather coat and a hat on his head. His face was rough, as if it hadn’t seen a razor in a long time, and there was something in his eyes I couldn’t immediately identify. There was something... empty in them.

"Jerry?" he asked as he got closer.

"Yeah, that’s me. Bill, right?"

"That’s right," he said, extending his hand for a handshake.

His grip was firm, though his hand was cold. I felt an unpleasant shiver, but I chalked it up to the chilly evening.

Bill quickly pulled out a set of keys from his pocket and, without a word, walked up to the gate, which he opened surprisingly smoothly, considering the state of the lock. As soon as the gate swung open, he gestured for me to follow him.

"It definitely doesn’t look very inviting," he began as we walked deeper into the park, "but you’ll get used to the sight over time."

Indeed, the inside of the park looked even worse than the outside. Everything was ruined. The Ferris wheel stood motionless, its large, rust-covered wheels creaking slightly as they were moved by the wind. Many of the rides were overgrown with weeds, and some buildings had broken windows. Yet Bill didn’t seem to care about the decay surrounding us.

"So, Jerry," he continued, ignoring my silence, "your job is simple. The park has been closed for years, but occasionally local kids try to break in. I just want you to make sure no one gets past the fence. You’ll sit in the security building, sometimes take a walk around the grounds, and that’s it."

He said it with such ease, as if he was sure the job would be a breeze for me. Or maybe he was just trying to sell me the job in the best light possible. I stayed silent because I still had a gut feeling that something wasn’t right.

"And how often do these kids come here?" I asked, trying to keep my voice from revealing my unease.

"Rarely," he replied. "Besides, you don’t have to worry too much about them. In case anything happens, you’ve got a flashlight, a walkie-talkie, and a key to all the locks."

Here is the translation to English:


---

Bill spoke as if everything was already settled. He didn’t even ask if I really wanted the job. He just assumed that since I was there, I’d agreed. And he was right.

Eventually, we reached a small security building situated a bit off from the main area of the park. The building seemed to be in slightly better condition than the rest of the park, though it was still far from being in good shape. Bill opened the door and let me inside.

Security Building

The interior of the security building was small and cramped. On the left was an old metal desk with a telephone and a walkie-talkie, next to it stood a wooden chair that looked like it wouldn’t withstand too much movement. Next to the desk were monitors, but most were turned off, and the few that were on showed only gray, blurry images.

"This is where you’ll spend most of your nights," Bill said, patting the desk. "Simple job. You’ve got a flashlight, keys to all the gates, and over here" – he pointed to an old cabinet against the wall – "you’ve got sandwiches in case you get hungry. But I warn you – they’re not the best."

I blinked at the moldy food, which had clearly been there for more than a few days, but I said nothing. One thought kept circling in my mind: “Why did I get this job so easily?”

Bill must have sensed my uncertainty because suddenly his face softened, as if he wanted to reassure me.

"Look, I know this place looks run-down and you might have doubts, but trust me, it’s easy money. Most nights, nothing happens. You just sit and wait for your shift to end."

He paused for a moment, as if contemplating whether to say anything else, then added:

"And... people say all sorts of things about this place, but don’t worry. It’s just rumors. An old park, past tragedies. People like to make up stories. Nothing more."

What he said didn’t help. In fact, it made me feel worse. As soon as I heard the word "tragedies," my mind immediately started recalling all the rumors about Sunny Valley. They spoke of accidents, ghosts, and strange occurrences that led to the park’s permanent closure. But I was an adult – I wasn’t going to be drawn into kids' tales.

Bill looked at me as if he could read my thoughts.

"Remember, Jerry," he said, looking up and staring me straight in the eyes, "follow your duty list and in case of danger, there’s a shotgun in that cabinet" – he pointed to a shelf in the corner of the room.

I nodded, trying to believe his words. But there was something in them that didn’t convince me. There was something unsettling about the way he said it – as if he didn’t fully believe it himself.

Bill said his goodbyes, handing me the keys to the gates and the walkie-talkie, then left, leaving me alone in the security building. For a moment, I sat in silence, listening for sounds from beyond the door, but there was nothing. The wind had died down, and the park, despite its decay, suddenly seemed even more desolate.

On the desk, I found a duty list. Handwritten, in simple words, with only a few points:

1. At 10:00 PM, check all the gates.


2. Every two hours, do a patrol of the main area.


3. In case of problems, use the walkie-talkie to contact Bill.


4. Never enter the administration building after midnight.



I froze when I read the last point. "Never enter the administration building after midnight." I was sure Bill hadn’t mentioned that. The administration building was at the end of the park – I had seen it from a distance when we walked by. It looked abandoned, like the rest, but what could be inside that made it necessary to avoid it after midnight?

For the rest of the evening, I stayed in the security building, trying to calm down and not let my imagination run wild. After reading the duty list, I couldn’t stop thinking about the last point – the prohibition against entering the administration building after midnight. What could be there? Why just after midnight? It was strange, but I didn’t want to dwell on it further. I tried to convince myself it was probably just a prank, a way to scare the new employee.

Still, I felt my unease growing. At such times, I always remind myself that my imagination can play tricks on me. "It’s just a job," I kept repeating in my mind, trying to calm my nerves.

At 10:00 PM, I started my first patrol. I took the flashlight, walkie-talkie, and stepped out into the chilly autumn air. With every minute, the park became increasingly eerie. The night was windless, which only intensified the feeling of unease. Even though I knew I was alone in the park, I had the impression that someone was watching me from a distance. This feeling grew with every passing minute, and the sounds of footsteps echoing off the rusted structures didn’t help.

I walked between the buildings, trying to stick to the established route. With each moment, the park seemed to become more lifeless. The roller coasters and carousels looked like bizarre skeletons of bygone days. Every attraction I passed had something sinister about it – especially the haunted house. I stopped for a moment, looking at its faded, tattered sign. The "Haunted House" sign hung crookedly, and the entrance was overgrown with bushes. An inner sense told me to leave as quickly as possible, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that something or someone was watching me from the dark windows of that building.

I finished the patrol sooner than I expected and returned to the security building. As soon as I closed the door behind me, I felt a strange relief. I was alone, locked in a small room, but at least I had a roof over my head. I sat at the desk and lit another cigarette, trying to ignore the unpleasant feeling that something was watching me.

It was a few minutes before midnight when I heard the first sounds that gave me goosebumps. I was sitting at the desk, repeatedly looking over the same paper, when I heard a faint creaking. At first, I thought it was the wind – after all, the old park was full of such noises. But this sound was different. It sounded as if someone was walking on a metal structure – maybe one of the roller coasters.

Instinctively, I reached for the walkie-talkie.

"Bill?" I said, trying to sound calm, though my heart was pounding like mad.

In response, I only heard static noise. I repeated several times, but each time it was the same – silence. The walkie-talkie wasn’t working, and I couldn’t contact Bill. I wanted to reach him by phone, but I had left it in the car on the parking lot.

I stood up, listening intently. The creaking sound was getting louder. I grabbed the flashlight and went outside. The park was engulfed in darkness, and my flashlight illuminated only small patches of ground ahead of me. I quickly scanned the area, trying to find the source of the noise.

And then I saw it.

At the top of one of the roller coasters, the one that was most dilapidated, something was moving. At first, I thought it was the wind stirring some rusty parts of the structure, but then I noticed that it was a human silhouette. It stood there on top, motionless, as if it were staring directly at me. A cold shiver ran down my spine. I began to wonder if it was just a shadow, an illusion caused by fatigue and stress, but that “shadow” moved.

The figure began to descend the roller coaster structure. It didn’t move normally – its movements were wild, almost inhuman. Every step seemed unnatural, as if it moved in a way that no being I had ever seen could.

My heart pounded like crazy, but something inside me urged me to move. I turned the walkie-talkie on again, but it still emitted only static. I wanted to scream, but the voice was stuck in my throat.

The figure vanished. I stood paralyzed, unsure of what to do. If it were local teenagers, they would have fled long ago. But this thing... I felt it was not a child, not an ordinary person.

Eventually, after a few minutes, I gathered enough strength to return to the security office. I locked the door behind me and sat trembling in the chair. The flashlight I still held was shaking along with me.

I tried to collect my thoughts. What could it have been? Was it possible that my imagination was just running wild, and I saw something that didn’t really exist? Maybe it was just a shadow, a mirage caused by exhaustion?

I glanced at my watch. It was already past midnight. And then I remembered the last item on the checklist – “Never enter the administrative building after midnight.” At that moment, I heard something that made all my senses flare up like alarm sirens.

From deep within the park, where the administrative building was located, came a quiet, rhythmic sound. Someone, or something, was banging on the door of that building.

The quiet, repetitive noise came from somewhere deep in the park. The knocks were even, mechanical, as if something – or someone – was trying to get out of the administrative building. It wasn’t knocking, but more like tapping on wood with something hard and metallic. I had the impression that every part of my body was screaming for me not to go. “Never enter the administrative building after midnight,” I remembered the words from the checklist. Everything in me wanted to follow that warning, lock myself in the security office, and pretend nothing was happening. But something else, a strange, unsettling curiosity, pulled me in that direction.

"It’s probably those kids Bill mentioned," I thought.

I took a deep breath and made a decision. I had to check it out; that was my job after all. I got up from the chair, grabbed the flashlight and the keys Bill had left me, and went outside. This time, the park seemed even more sinister. Every shadow seemed to move as if waiting for me to turn away so it could step closer. I tried to ignore it, but I knew I was alone – or at least I wanted to believe so.

I headed towards the administrative building, listening carefully. The knocking did not stop, but it did not get louder either, which made me feel as if something was deliberately trying to attract attention but not enough to cause panic. I approached the building, lighting it up with the flashlight. It was even more dilapidated than I remembered. Bushes had overgrown the windows, and the doors were partially destroyed, barely hanging on their hinges.

The knocking suddenly ceased, as if something realized I was approaching. I stopped for a moment, trying to calm my breathing. My heart was pounding like a hammer, and my mind was in chaos. “It’s just some kid sneaking around again,” I kept telling myself.

I approached the building’s door and instinctively reached for the keys. I wondered if I should even try to open the door, but before I could make a decision, the door started to slowly open by itself. I froze.

The quiet creak of the hinges cut through the night’s silence as I watched the darkness inside the building slowly reveal itself to me. The flashlight trembled in my hand, and I held my breath.

Inside, it was cold, damp, and filled with the smell of mold. The flashlight illuminated empty offices, with furniture in disarray and papers scattered on the floor. I felt every step reverberate through the building, as if every move I made was being observed by some invisible entity. Suddenly, I heard a soft rustle behind me and turned around abruptly, but there was no one there. Only darkness.

With each step, I felt my nerves tightening more and more. Yet, I couldn’t stop moving forward. Something was drawing me. The knocking sound I had heard earlier returned, this time quieter, as if it was coming from the very bottom of the building. I descended to the ground floor, the flashlight illuminating the ruined doors at the end of the corridor. The knocking was now barely audible but persistent. I quickened my pace.

When I reached the end of the corridor, I saw an old elevator. It looked like it hadn’t worked in years – rusty and forgotten. Yet, the knocking seemed to come from it. I hesitated only for a moment before trying to open the doors. To my surprise, they slid open easily, though with a prolonged metallic groan.

Inside the elevator, there was nothing that could explain the noise. An empty shaft leading down into darkness. I crouched, trying to peer down, when suddenly...

...I heard a breath.

A quiet, gentle breath, but distinctly close. At first, I thought it was my own shallow breathing, but when I heard another one, so close as if someone was literally standing next to my ear, I jumped back. The flashlight fell from my hands and rolled across the floor, briefly illuminating the elevator’s interior.

I saw it.

It was there, at the bottom of the shaft, staring directly at me. A human silhouette, but strangely distorted. Its eyes were too large, too black. They did not blink. Instead, they stared at me as if looking straight into my soul. I couldn’t move. The gaze of that entity paralyzed me.

I don’t know how much time passed. Maybe seconds, maybe minutes, but suddenly the entity began to move. It didn’t move in a way that a human should.

It began to climb up...

With difficulty, I tore myself from the trance and, without thinking any longer, turned and ran. I sprinted through the dark corridor, crashing into walls, tripping over scattered objects. I heard soft footsteps behind me, growing closer, as if that thing was getting nearer. I didn’t dare look back. I ran with all my strength until I finally reached the exit doors of the administrative building.

I stumbled out into the night, slamming the door behind me. In the darkness of the amusement park, I suddenly felt a weight lift off my shoulders. The footsteps had stopped, and all I could hear was my own heavy breathing.

I didn’t stop running until I reached a safe place.

Sitting in the security building, gasping for breath, I realized I couldn’t ignore this feeling any longer. I knew I had to defend myself, even though I wasn’t entirely sure against what. In one of the cabinets, Bill had left an old hunting shotgun—just in case, he’d said when he first mentioned it. At the time, I thought it was overkill, something I would never need. Now, however, it seemed like my only hope.

With trembling hands, I reached for the shotgun and pulled it out. It was heavy and cold to the touch. I opened the chamber, but my hands shook so violently that the bullets fell to the floor. I swore under my breath, trying to pick them up and load them, but my mind was in chaos.

“Focus, Jerry, damn it!” I said aloud, trying to regain control.

Eventually, I managed to load the shotgun. At that moment, I heard something that made all my muscles tense. From behind the closed door of the security building, there were quiet, gentle footsteps. As if something was walking right outside. I held my breath, staring at the door, and then... the footsteps stopped. Silence fell for a moment, but it was even worse than the sounds.

I knew I couldn’t ignore it. Something was out there, just behind the door, and I knew I had to act. Without a second thought, without any plan—just in panic—I raised the shotgun, aimed at the door, and fired.

The blast was deafening. In the small security room, the sound of the shot echoed, and my ears were instantly filled with a roaring buzz. The door shook, and pieces of wood flew everywhere. For a moment, I saw clouds of smoke and nothing more. Adrenaline took over my body. My heart was pounding so hard I could almost hear it in my temples.

As the smoke from the shot began to clear and the sound of the shot finally faded, I stared at the door. My heart was racing, my mind was a mess, but then I saw something that made my body freeze.

Through the hole I’d made in the door, I saw something I hadn’t expected—a boy, maybe seventeen, kneeling on the ground. He was staring straight at me. His eyes were wide open, filled with terror. In that moment, it hit me that I had shot a child. Dressed in dark, tattered clothes, with blood slowly seeping from a wound on his shoulder, he looked at me with disbelief. A soft, painful sigh escaped his lips, and I felt something inside my head begin to crack.

I couldn’t breathe, I couldn’t think. What was he doing here? Why?

I wanted to say something, to help him, but then I noticed something else. Emerging from the darkness behind the boy was... her. The creature I had seen earlier in the elevator shaft. It was much closer now, much more distinct. Its deformed body moved in an inhuman way, and its terrifyingly large, black eyes stared at me, as if it were toying with my fear. As it stepped into the light of the flashlight, it smiled—or at least something that could be called a smile stretched across its grotesque face. There was something unnatural, something... grotesque about it.

The thing began to lap up the boy's blood. I froze, unsure of what to do as the creature grabbed the boy by the arm. The boy’s terrified gaze shifted from me to the creature standing right beside him. He tried to fight, but he was too weak. He reached out towards me, as if begging for help, as if wanting me to do something. In his eyes, I saw desperation like I had never seen before. But before I could move, the creature dragged him into the darkness with one swift motion.

It all happened so quickly that for a moment I couldn’t comprehend what had just occurred. The boy was gone, and I was left staring at the empty hole in the door.

I spent the rest of the night sitting in a chair, holding the gun, staring at the door. As dawn began to break outside, I realized I had to face reality. Despite everything that had happened, I had to come up with an explanation for what I had seen and, most importantly, figure out what to tell Bill.

When Bill arrived in the morning for his shift, I tried to stay calm, though inside, I felt every nerve was trembling. He looked at me with mild surprise, noticing my exhaustion.

“You look like you haven’t slept all night,” he joked, then glanced at the door. His gaze fell on the bullet hole. “What the hell happened here?”

I knew I had to say something, something credible that wouldn’t seem suspicious. I cleared my throat and tried to compose myself.

“It... was an emergency situation,” I started hesitantly, then added more convincingly, “Someone broke into the park. I heard noises during the night. I went out and saw some kid. It looked like he was armed. In a panic, I fired, but I missed. He ran away, and I... couldn’t find him.”

Bill frowned, clearly surprised.

“A kid? Armed? A break-in?”

“Yeah, he must have been young. I don’t know what he was doing in the park, but... I didn’t see anyone else. Maybe he was alone,” I said quickly, trying to build a coherent story.

Bill looked at the door, then at me, and sighed.

“You’re lucky, Jerry, very lucky.”

I felt my heart slowly calming. Bill bought my excuse. I managed to avoid trouble, but that didn’t change the fact that I had to leave this place. I couldn’t come back here. Not after what I had seen.

“Bill,” I began hesitantly, “I need... to quit this job. I know I just started, but after what happened last night... it’s too much for me. I can’t work here anymore.”

Bill looked at me for a moment, as if weighing something in his mind. He didn’t seem surprised. On the contrary—like he had expected it. Finally, he nodded.

“Understood. Not everyone is cut out for this job,” he said calmly. “This place... can evoke fear. Sometimes more than we can handle.”

His words sounded strange. I had the feeling he knew something more, that this wasn’t the first time someone had quit because of what happened in the park.

I gathered the courage to ask the question that had been troubling me since I entered the administration building.

“Bill, one more thing, what is in the administration building?”

As I spoke these words, Bill’s face went pale, and his usually calm expression disappeared. Fear appeared on his face, and Bill’s eyes seemed momentarily vacant, as if the memories I had invoked hit him with full force.

Bill took a deep breath, looking me straight in the eyes.

“This place is... evil, Jerry. Evil was born here.”
