I'd always been told that my grandmother, Agnes, had passed away when I was just a kid. My parents would tell me stories about her, about how kind and loving she was, but I never really remembered her. I was too young when she died.

But now, as I stood in front of her old house, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The house had been abandoned for years, but I'd received a strange letter in the mail a few days ago, addressed to me, with no return address. All it said was: "Come home, Elijah."

I'd always been curious about my family's past, and this letter had sparked something in me. I had to know what was going on.

As I approached the house, I noticed that the front door was slightly ajar. I pushed it open and called out, "Hello? Is anyone here?"

There was no answer, but I could have sworn I heard a faint whispering coming from upstairs. The whispering was soft and raspy, and it sent shivers down my spine.

I cautiously made my way up the creaky stairs, my heart pounding in my chest. As I reached the top, I saw a figure standing in the doorway of the room at the end of the hall.

It was Agnes.

But that was impossible. She was supposed to be dead.

As I stood there, frozen in shock, Agnes turned to face me. Her eyes were sunken, her skin was pale, and her hair was gray and brittle. But it was her. I could see it in her eyes.

"Elijah," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "I've been waiting for you."

I tried to speak, but my voice caught in my throat. I couldn't believe what I was seeing.

Agnes beckoned me to come closer, and I hesitantly approached her. As I got nearer, I could see that she was standing in a room that was exactly as I'd imagined it would be. There were old family photos on the walls, and a big, comfortable-looking armchair in the corner.

But something was off. The room felt... wrong. It felt like it had been preserved in time, like nothing had changed since Agnes had supposedly passed away.

"Elijah, sit down," Agnes said, gesturing to the armchair. "We need to talk."

I sat down, trying to process what was happening. Agnes sat down in a chair opposite me, and we just looked at each other for a long time.

Finally, Agnes spoke up. "I know you've been told that I'm dead," she said. "But I'm not. I've been waiting for you, Elijah. I've been waiting for a long time."

I didn't know what to say. I was still trying to wrap my head around the fact that my supposedly dead grandmother was sitting in front of me.

"Why?" I asked finally. "Why did you pretend to be dead?"

Agnes leaned forward, her eyes glinting in the dim light. "I had to," she said. "I had to protect you, Elijah. You were too young to understand, but... things were happening. Things that I couldn't control. And I had to keep you safe."

I felt a chill run down my spine. What kind of things was she talking about?

"What kind of things?" I asked, trying to keep my voice steady.

Agnes leaned back in her chair, a faraway look in her eyes. "Things that I thought were just old wives' tales," she said. "Things that I thought were just stories. But they're not. They're real, Elijah. And they're coming for you."

I felt a cold sweat break out on my forehead. What was she talking about?

Suddenly, I heard a creaking sound coming from downstairs. It sounded like someone was coming up the stairs.

Agnes's eyes snapped back into focus, and she leaned forward again. "It's too late," she whispered. "They've found us. You have to get out of here, Elijah. Now."

I didn't need to be told twice. I leapt out of the chair and made a dash for the door. But as I reached it, I felt a cold hand grab my arm.

It was Agnes.

"Don't go," she whispered. "Please, Elijah. Don't leave me."

I tried to shake her off, but she held tight. And then, I saw something that made my blood run cold.

Agnes's eyes had changed. They had turned a milky white, and they seemed to be staring right through me.

"Agnes, what's happening?" I asked, trying to keep my voice steady.

But she didn't answer. She just kept staring at me, her eyes seeming to bore into my soul.

And then, everything went black.

When I came to, I was lying on the floor, my head throbbing with ...pain. I was disoriented and confused, and it took me a few moments to remember where I was and what had happened.

As I struggled to my feet, I saw that Agnes was nowhere to be seen. The room was empty and silent, except for the sound of my own ragged breathing.

I stumbled out of the room and down the stairs, desperate to get out of the house and away from whatever had happened to Agnes. But as I reached the front door, I found that it was locked. I tried the handle, but it wouldn't budge.

I was trapped.

Panic set in as I realized that I was stuck in the house with... whatever was happening to Agnes. I tried to calm myself down, telling myself that I just needed to find a way out, but my heart was racing and my mind was filled with terrifying thoughts.

I started to search the house, looking for a way out or some kind of clue as to what was going on. But every door I opened led to more questions, and every window I looked out of showed me nothing but darkness.

As I searched, I started to feel like I was being watched. I would catch glimpses of movement out of the corner of my eye, but whenever I turned to look, there would be no one there.

I was starting to lose my mind.

And then, I heard a noise. It was a low, creaking sound, like the floorboards were shifting and groaning. I froze, my heart pounding in my chest, as I realized that the noise was coming from upstairs.

Agnes's room.

I didn't want to go back up there. I didn't want to see what was happening to Agnes. But I knew that I had to. I had to know what was going on, and I had to try and find a way out of the house.

I took a deep breath and started to make my way back up the stairs. The creaking sound grew louder with each step, and I could feel my heart pounding in my chest.

As I reached the top of the stairs, I saw that the door to Agnes's room was open. I hesitated for a moment, wondering if I really wanted to go inside. But then, I steeled myself and stepped forward.

What I saw inside the room made my blood run cold.

Agnes was sitting in her armchair, her eyes still milky white and unseeing. But it was what was around her that made my heart stop.

The room was filled with strange symbols and markings, etched into the walls and floor. They seemed to pulse with a malevolent energy, and I could feel their power emanating from them.

And then, I saw it. A figure, standing just behind Agnes. It was tall and gaunt, with eyes that glowed like embers.

I tried to scream, but my voice was frozen in my throat. I was paralyzed with fear, unable to move or speak.

The figure started to move towards me, its eyes fixed on me with an unspeakable hunger. I knew that I was doomed, trapped in the house with this... thing.

And then, everything went black.

When I came to, I was lying on the floor, my head throbbing with pain. The room was empty and silent, except for the sound of my own ragged breathing.

I stumbled to my feet, desperate to get out of the house and away from whatever had happened. I staggered down the stairs, my heart pounding in my chest.

As I reached the front door, I found that it was unlocked. I flung it open and stumbled out into the night, gasping with relief.

I didn't stop running until I was back in my own bed, locked safely in my own apartment. I didn't sleep that night, haunted by the memories of what I had seen in Agnes's house.

And when I finally did drift off to sleep, I was haunted by nightmares of the figure in Agnes's room, its eyes glowing with an unspeakable hunger.

I never went back to Agnes's house again. I never spoke of what I had seen that night. But I knew that I would never be able to shake the memories of that terrible night, and the horror that I had faced in Agnes's house.
