For context, this took place when I was in 4th-5th grade. I remember it was summer, and like most kids, I went outside during the days and wandered the streets and woods with neighborhood friends. Behind our street was a strip of power lines that I wasn't allowed back into. A few summers prior, a tick had given me Lyme disease, and I spent a few days in the hospital. So it's understandable why my parents wouldn't want me walking in tall grassy parts of the woods or climbing trees anymore.

One of these days that summer, my two friends and I were walking in the neighborhood when someone came up with the idea to go into the powerlines and explore. As we took the right off the street and began walking in the woods, I became hesistant. I was scared of getting in trouble with my parents; however, after expressing this, they told me to stay behind if I wanted and kept chugging along. Everything up to this point is normal. About 20 seconds go by, and I'm standing by myself in about 100 yards of woods between the powerlines and the road. This is where things take a turn. In bright daylight, I start hearing music like staticky radio music I've never heard before. This wasn't like an ordinary radio song by Kesha or Rihanna back in the early 2010s. It was instrumental and repetitive, if that makes any sense. I quickly wrote it off as a car going by, but the music was not moving from the source like a moving car would as it drove down the street. I also knew no car would be parked on that part of the road as it was quite busy, and I would have seen it through the brush. It sounded like a radio just sat there in the woods out of sight. Then it got worse. I began to hear children's laughter over the music of the radio. It was getting louder. All this happened in seconds. I looked in all directions. Nothing but woods, the road, and powerlines I could see through the brush about 40 yards out in each direction. My friends were only about 200 yards away, but they were out of sight.

Then I start hearing her voice. Plain as day... Coming from all directions as if she were in my head. She tells me to come to her in a creepy tone. "Come, my sweet little boy, come over to me" or something along those lines. She was beckoning me. Trying to lure me in like a child from Hansel and Gretel. I remember trying to tell myself this is in my head, while still grasping what is happening. This made no sense in the moment. I remember still looking around and seeing nobody. No source of the music or laughter, or voices that are plain as day. Then I start hearing footsteps behind me. Getting closer. Again, a plain day. I still hear the crunching of the leaves below her feet. I never saw anything; however, fight or flight kicked in, and I ran to my friends. As fast as possible. Not 10 seconds later, I catch them in my line of sight, walking as if they were just chatting. I was shaking as I caught up to them. I thought they could have been messing with me. But nothing adds up, maybe the speaker in the woods. But the footsteps were with no one there, and the voice was in all directions.

This is not something I made up. This was not a dream. I spoke to my friend years later, and she remembered me catching up to them. This was by far the scariest experience I can recall.
