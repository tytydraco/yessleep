[Hey guys](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/14nwmln/ive_been_stuck_in_halloween_2022_for_almost_250/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3),

Thank you for all your suggestions and help! I hope we can figure this out together. My phone is still allowing me to reach out to the present, so i can tell you guys what has been going on since my first post. I have tried moving the numbers and taking the calendar out of range, although they didn't seem to work. As u/Fax_006 suggested, I left a note the other night. I wrote, \*Trust me, I want this to end. Can you help me out?  Maybe give me a clue? When I woke up this morning, I got a reply: 

\*To help you break free, listen to me. In this town with a past so grand, Where legends of Halloween expand and a movie's tale holds secrets tight, Unravel them with all you’re might.

Buried beneath a leafy mound, A spirit rests, not lost but found. Seek the place where darkness veils And ancient lore forever prevails.

Within the depths of sacred lore, A lurking presence, evermore. Sam's mischievous tricks concealed, Unlock his secrets; they will be revealed.

So, explore the past of this haunted place. Unearth the tales with a careful embrace. As history dances with fiction's treat, Discover the ties, both subtle and neat.

Can you unravel the riddle's core and connect the film to legends of yore? Let local history guide your quest, And break the loop to escape the jest.

After I finish this post, I thought I might rewatch "Trick-or-treat", as it might help me figure out this clue. Although I'm hoping you guys could figure out what the riddle means, I did some research on anything Halloween-related in my local history and found this website called diedinhouse.com, and when I put in my address, I found this:

“In 2010, 16-year-old Devon Griffin came home on Halloween to play video games after attending church and spending the previous night sleeping out. He noticed the Michigan home was too quiet, so he checked on his family members, according to the Sandusky Register. Griffin proceeded to find his stepfather in bed, covered in blood. When police arrived, they found two more bodies: Griffin's mother and brother. Police eventually learned the murderer was Griffin's stepbrother, William Liske.”

According to the article, William had dressed up as Sam. This leads me to believe these murders, which occurred 38 miles from my house, may explain why the border stops where it does and what this has to do with the movie “Trick or Treat.”  I decided to see if I was right, and went to the house close to midnight, in case anything happened. 

As I approached the house, I heard wolves howl in the distance. This was odd, as this wasn't an area known for them. I slowly walked up the steps, and the door creaked open. The moon lit the interior of the house. The first room I saw was a study, with bookshelves almost bare, except for a few books. On the decaying desk, I saw newspaper clippings. They had the same article I had read online, with certain letters circled, spelling out a message: "I did not kill them. It was Sam."  

After looking at the books on the shelves, one of them caught my eye. It was called "A season with the witch" by J.W Ocker. It was filled with information on the areas nearby, including interviews, historical sites, etc. I looked at the time. 11:55. The book by my side, I searched the house for any more clues. As the clock grew closer to midnight, I heard a footstep. In the dim light, I saw what it was. It was the Sam characther I had seen at the party. Right before the day reset again, he started to run in my direction, and I heard him say "Have you seen Abby lately?" I couldn’t help but scream.

Once I had been teleported back to my bed, I knew the book I had found had to be of some importance, as though it had left my hands, it had been moved right next to the clock. 

What that guy had told me was terrifying, because I don’t know why I hadn’t noticed this before, but while I had seen both my parents and younger brother, my sister, Abby, had disappeared. I should mention she works a lot, but on Halloween, she got off at eleven, yet even on the nights when I had stayed up until midnight, she never came home from work. I’m worried about this even more because, in William’s case, he had killed his brother, stepfather, and mother. Without my sister, I have my brother, father, and mother left. Maybe it’s just a coincidence, but after what that guy said to me, I doubt it. I’m more worried than ever, not just for my sake but for my family's. Well, I hope I can figure out what's going on!
