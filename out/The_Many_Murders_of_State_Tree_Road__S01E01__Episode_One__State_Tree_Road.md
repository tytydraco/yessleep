TYLER [VO]

The road was quaint and inoffensive. Managing to hide in plain sight the reputation it has garnered in the last five years. Built in the 1870s, the road was originally used to transport workers during the Australian Gold Rush. 


[NATURE SOUNDS]


Along the side of the road you can still make out wooden structures that used to provide shelter to the gold miners. Old rotted wood crumbling under its own weight, the trees have grown over them. Keeping the history these buildings held all to themselves. 


This road, only about twelve kilometres long is the crime scene to seven of the most brutal murders to take place in Australia. All of these murders have been unsolved. However, all of the victims were subject to the same amount of visceral and brutal violence. Locals of the road, at least the few left, often keep to themselves, retirees looking to spend their remaining years in solitude. 


[CAR DRIVING OVER DIRT]


Sam

You think anyone is going to talk to us?


TYLER [VO]

That is my co host [REDACTED]. We have been covering the unsolved murders of State Tree Road on our podcast, [REDACTED]. 


TYLER

I don’t think so. 


[ROYALTY FREE SCARY MUSIC PLAYING]


TYLER [VO]

While none of the locals living on State Tree Road wanted to talk to [REDACTED] and I. There was still a small town only about thirteen kilometres south that was more than willing to converse with us. 


[INDISTINCT NOISES]


Sam

So you’re saying it’s a Yowie?


Woman

You bet. My brother seen him. He would take bear traps up there and hide them in the bushes. Trying to catch it. 


Tyler

But the killer used the bear traps, no?


TYLER [VO]

The mention of bear traps was interesting. Four victims were found being forced into bear traps. At least, that’s what forensics concluded. Scuff marks in the mud and multiple scratches on their faces or arms where they fought their attackers attempts to shove their victims into the trap. The traps were also left out in the open. No attempt to be hidden and simply used as a tool. Not as a trap. 


The town was small with a city like bustle hidden within the town the mountains surrounded. A warm and friendly community that welcomed my co-host and I with open arms. A far cry from the cold and isolated State Tree Road that sat just thirteen kilometres north. 


From [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] comes, [REDACTED]. A true crime investigation series hosted by [REDACTED] and [REDACTED]


If you've listened to [REDACTED] before, you probably know that our first episode was about the unsolved murders of Marcus Welsh, Tia Kinney and Phoebe Baker just ten meters off of State Tree Road. Ever since that episode aired, four more people have been murdered on the small stretch of road. With two more going missing in the area along with them. That’s nine possible victims in the last five years. 


[REDACTED] and I were able to sit down with the lead detective on the case, [REDACTED]. He sat across from us, stirring a black coffee. Bitter and colourless, the mans demeanour was a reflection of his coffee order. 


Lead Detective

I think it was about six months into my transferral that the murders of, uh… Marcus Welsh, Phoebe Baker and Tia Kinney took place. 


Tyler

What immediately stood out to you about the scene?



Lead Detective

I remember thinking my partner had taken a wrong turn. We had to drive for about an hour. I’m stationed forty five minutes east of [REDACTED]. So this whole place is a little unfamiliar to me. Not so much anymore. 


[LAUGHS] 


Sam

But with the scene. How the bodies were found. What stood out about that?


Lead Detective

I believed Marcus had done the girls in, actually. It seemed pretty open and shut to me at first. What seemed like a self inflicted head shot wound on Marcus. The two girls were killed pretty brutally. Middle of no where. Who else would be out there? My partner could not find the weapon Marcus used to shoot himself. I mean typically, you drop the gun in your lap when you shoot yourself from a seated position. 


Sam

You didn’t find the weapon? Your partner did?


Lead Detective

I mean, yes. I suppose. I was looking too. For any evidence really. 


Sam

Right. 


Tyler

At what point did you realise there was another person involved outside of the three victims?


Lead Detective

Not finding the weapon used to commit suicide stood out to me as suspicious. We found very large footprints in the mud as well, not matching any of the victims. 


Tyler

It’s said that the investigation into the case only lasted three days before being handed off and eventually forgotten. There hasn’t been any movement of the case since the month it happed. Why is that?


Lead Detective 

It has not been forgotten. Truth be told. The best criminals are impossible to catch. We had nothing to go off. 


Sam

Nothing to go off? How about ballistics on the headshot wound on Marcus or the footprint in the mud?


Lead Detective

It was a standard shotgun shell. Nothing identifiable about it. The footprint was simply a small clue. 


Sam

A small clue to crack the case?


Lead Detective

A small clue to put in some file. 


Tyler

What efforts were made on the initial triple homicide?


Lead Detective

I handed it off when I realised the case did not have enough evidence to pro—


Tyler

So you didn’t interview anyone?


Lead Detective

We interviewed many locals. No one saw or heard anything. Alibis all checked out. 


Sam

So what was—what about the cult located just five kilometres west of the crime scene?


Lead Detective

I said all the alibis checked out. 


Sam

[LAUGHS]


Tyler

Speaking of the cult. What member of the cult did you speak to?


Lead Detective

I think we are using cult a little liberally here, no? I mean it’s four people. Four people that worship a scarecrow. It’s not Waco. It’s not uh, Heavens Gate. It’s four people. 


Sam

Five at the time. Have you researched this cult at all?


Lead Detective

Of course I have. 


Sam

No, I don’t think you did. Its ties to satanic rituals are incredibly deep. It’s practically a branch of satanism. 


Lead Detective

I think the era of Satanic Panic died decades ago, Sam. 


Sam

But is it not worth looking into when three people are brutally murdered and they are one of the few people nearby?


Lead Detective

Of course it’s worth looking into. That’s why we did and we came back with nothing. 


Tyler

It was only four months later that Matt Page went missing after going for a hike on the trails outside of State Tree Road. Did you immediately know there was a connection between the two cases?


Lead Detective

There is still no evidence that makes me confident these cases are linked. 


Sam

He went missing from the same vicinity only four mon-


Lead Detective

Off a hiking trail. He may have went off the trail, gotten lost. There are still mine shafts hidden by the bush out there. He may have fallen down them during a misadventure. 


Sam 

I want to know why the police of [REDACTED] gave up on the triple homicide so quickly. Is there more to the story than you let on?


Lead Detective 

I joined the force to help people. I have solved over two hundred homicides in my career. At the end of the day, Sam. This is a career. I have to make moves that benefit my career. Quite frankly, I find your line of questioning quite hostile and rude. 


Sam

[LAUGHS]


Tyler [VO]

They continued to bicker about small details of the case. His dismissal of the Matt Page disappearance was annoying but expected. Truth is, the only links between the Welsh, Kinney, Baker triple homicide and the Matt Page disappearance was their vicinity. The connection to State Tree Road. The state of the scene of the triple homicide was horrific. Officers and forensics compared it to a bear attack with the carnage and complete ferociousness of the murders. Meanwhile, Matt Page disappeared without a trace. Vanished. There was still however the double homicide that occurred the following year. Involving a father and son duo who were camping on the national camp connected to State Tree Road. Anthony and Shaun Miller were attacked at their campsite. Shaun, fourteen at the time, had his head shoved into a bear trap. While Anthony had been whipped, tied to a tree and kicked so violently in the head, they initially thought he had been shot with a shotgun. This attack occurred only four hundred meters away from where the Welsh Kinney Baker homicides took place. 


Tyler

How about the connection to the murders of Anthony and Shaun Miller? 


Lead Detective

We do believe it is linked. 


Sam

Is it safe to assume there is a serial killer targeting people on State Tree Road?


Lead Detective

I don’t want to confirm or deny anything. What I can say is that it is believed that those cases are linked. However, to cry serial killer may cause a panic in a small community. There may be multiple attackers, there may be a copycat of some kind. These murders occurred a year after one anoth-


Sam

Matt Page went missing there just eight months before the murders of the Millers. 


Lead Detective 

I do not believe these cases are all linked. 


Tyler [VO]

The detective is an imposing figure. Even in his age, he has a certain gravitas. This is combined with a callous stare and a cold demeanour. I could already see my co-host becoming frustrated with the typical vague answers of a detective. 


Tyler

The cult is-


Lead Detective

I promise you the cult is not involved. The cult is a fear mongering tactic used by you radio people to exaggerate the story. Someone killed seven people. This cult, that you speak of, is simply blown out of proportion. They are a-


Sam

The sixth known victim…


[PAGES RUSTLING]


Here. Christian Leone. The sixth known victim was found murdered only two months after the death of the Millers. Christian Leone was a part of this cult. Is that any connection?


Lead Detective

Christian Leone’s death was ruled a suicide. 


Sam

Was it suicide though?


Lead Detective

Christian Leone hung himself. 


Sam

But the rope was tied around a seperate tree?


[SPEECH FADES]


Tyler [VO]

This next part is hard to explain. Christian Leone was found hanging from a noose in the national forest next to State Tree Road. Typically, in a suicide, the victim climbs a tree, ties the rope to a branch and wraps the noose around their neck before jumping. Christians suicide was suspicious as he had not tied himself to the tree he hung himself from. Instead the rope was tied to a seperate tree located behind him and the rope had been thrown over the branch he hung from. Meaning Christian Leone had to have tied the rope to the base of a tree and throw the rope over the top of another tree branch before walking over climbing the tree and putting his head through the noose and then finally jumping off the branch. A little convoluted, no?


Lead Detective

I am not going to try and rationalise the thoughts of a suicidal person. 


Sam

Is it not possible someone else hung him?


Lead Detective

Even if that was the case. Which I will add, it is not. This does not have any connection to the murder of the Millers and the Welsh Kinney Baker Homicides. The entire M.O is completely different. There was nothing to indicate, to us, the same viciousness of those attacks. 


Sam

The tree branch had such intense rope burn it had cut itself into the branch. 


Lead Detective

Christian Leone weighed ninety seven kilos at the time of his death. 


Sam

That’s still not enough to cause that. 


Lead Detective 

How would someone be able to pull him up so quickly he burns through the branch?


Sam

Four other people could probably do it. 


Tyler [VO]

I hadn’t even covered all the cases with [REDACTED] yet. My co-host was intent on calling him out for some lie. I had to ask my co-host to leave the room so I could question the detective about the remaining cases. 


[RUSTLE OF CLOTHES]


[PAPER SHUFFLING]


Lead Detective

I find him quite rude. 


Tyler

He is very passionate. We are just trying to get to the truth of what happened. 


Lead Detective 

Sometimes the truth is impossible to find. 


Tyler

I really don’t believe that. 


[PAPER NOISES]


I just wanted to ask you about, uhhh… three more cases here. We can get this over with quick if you’d like. 


Lead Detective 

Please do. 


[LAUGHS]


Tyler

Two years after Christian Leone committed suicide, James Howard went missing after his car broke down on State Tree Road. 


Lead Detective

Once again, a case of misadventure. 


Tyler

Ok. 


Lead Detective

People go missing in and around national parks all the time. Especially where there are gold mine shafts. That’s just… that’s just his it is. 


Tyler

One year after that, Lucas Dance was found dismembered and displayed on a tree at State Tree Road. 


Lead Detective

I have reason to believe the person responsible for that death is already behind bars. 


Tyler

May I ask who?


Lead Detective

No, sorry. 


Tyler

Finally, only six months ago, and six months after Lucas Dance was found. Sienna Tyson was killed at State Tree Road after being tortured. She was strangled with barbed wi-


Lead Detective

I do remember the details of that case. 


Tyler

My apologies. 


Lead Detective

No need. It’s for the audience for this uh… radio thing right?


Tyler

Well, podcast, yeah. 


Lead Detective 

Once again, I believe the murderer of Sienna Tyson is already behind bars. 


Tyler

Ok. 


Lead Detective

Will that be all?


Tyler

Ah yes, thank you for your time. 


Lead Detective

My pleasure. 


Tyler [VO]

The detective and I said our goodbyes. He didn’t look at my co-host while he left. My co-host carried the same attitude. We returned back to our hotel room and I allowed [REDACTED] to listen to the remainder of the interview. Where he had this to say. 


Sam

What the hell happened to hard hitting journalism?


Tyler 

We might need him for another interview later. I didn’t want any bad blood. 


Sam

He was hiding something. 


Tyler

I don’t know. You were very aggressive. 


Sam

I was asking easy questions. 


Tyler

You were accusing him of being a bad police officer. 


Sam

I never said that. 


Tyler

You implied it. 


Sam

I don’t think I was wrong. 


Tyler [VO]

Little did we know, we were about to crack this case wide open when we finally received a call from someone who lived on State Tree Road. Telling us they had something interesting to show us. [REDACTED] was the only State Tree Road Local who would talk to us. He had set up trail cams to try and catch foxes sneaking into his chicken pen and had a video saved for, the night Sienna Tyson was murdered. 


State Tree Road Local

If you look right here down in the corner. You see it, yeah, aye. Right there. 


Sam

What the fuck is that?


Tyler

That’s a man. 


State Tree Road Local

He sneaking around down there just at the back of the tree line. Those trees are about four meters tall. 


Sam

This guy is half of that. 


Tyler

Did you show this to the police?


State Tree Road Local

I did. Yeah. I thought you guys should see it to though. 


Tyler

He’s got to be like seven feet tall. 


Sam

The detective said he believes the guy responsible for this is already locked up though. 


Tyler

I found the only recent arrest in this area for a violent crime. I believe that’s the guy he was referring to. 


Sam

Can you please send us this?


State Tree Road Local

There’s more. 


[MOUSE CLICKING]


Tyler

Just for the audience right now. He scrolling ahea- oh wait. 


State Tree Road Local

That’s his face there.


Sam

He is dressed as a scarecrow. 


Tyler

Yeah. I don’t think that’s his face. He’s wearing a mask. 


Sam

Have you ever seen anyone that looks like this?


State Tree Road Local

Never in my life. When I saw this the first time. I sat up in my bed all night long with a gun. I was terrified. I truly don’t believe this thing is human. 


Tyler

That's ridiculous. 


Sam

Do you have any more?


State Tree Road Local

No. I check everyday. I showed the police this twice now and they haven’t done nothing with it. 


Sam

We are going to look into this.


Tyler [VO]

I’m sorry if the audio there didn’t quite describe what we saw. We saw a very skinny, very tall man walk out of the tree line dressed in a scarecrow outfit. He observed the chickens before disappearing off camera. He came back a few hours later, presumably after killing Sienna Tyson, and went back into the tree-line. My co-host and I headed back to our hotel room and shared the video to our instagram account at [REDACTED]. 


[INDISTINCT NOISE]


Sam

I mean, it has to be the cult. Worship a scarecrow. A scarecrow attacks them. 


Tyler

Do any of the members match the description? Are they that tall?


Sam

We have to interview them. 


Tyler

I think you’re right.
