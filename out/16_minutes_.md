For six years, I worked the night shift at a customer service center, a place known by the veteran employees as "Graveyard." Every time I swiped my magnetic ID to start my shift at 9:00 p.m., I remembered why it earned that name. After dealing with the last customer each night, I would head to the basement parking lot to pick up my old Volkswagen, just before four in the morning.

The place was oppressive, neglectful of its employees' well-being. They opened a massive building for just six workers, including one supervisor and a security guard. Four souls in a sea of phones that rang no more than a dozen times throughout the night. The hallways were long and deserted, illuminated by flickering fluorescent lights that cast shadows on the walls. The atmosphere was heavy, laden with a tension you could almost slice, as if the air itself was imbued with a sense of despair.

During the night, it was common to encounter a coworker at the bathroom door or the fridge in the common area, where there were only four containers of prepared food and a couple of generic brand soda courtesy of the "considerate" company administration. The common area was devoid of any comfort, with worn-out furniture and a gloomy ambiance that clearly reflected the company's indifference towards its employees. The vending machines were outdated and often malfunctioned, forcing us to fix them with whatever was available.

I had grown accustomed to the silence that reigned at those hours, broken only by the echo of my own footsteps or the shouts over the phone from some American citizen with a southern accent, seemingly designed solely to hurl racist insults at someone trying to help solve a problem from the other side of the world. Each call was a battle, a constant reminder of the lack of respect and disdain for our work. Often, I felt my patience wearing thin with every hurtful word and every unjustified complaint.

At the end of my shift, fatigue would take over my body, my eyelids heavy and my movements slow. The walk to the basement parking lot had become a monotonous and disheartening routine. Sometimes, I couldn't remember lapses of time, arriving home without the slightest recollection of how I got there. Whole blocks of life ran on autopilot, as if handled by someone who didn't want to be there at that moment, in that place. As I descended the stairs, the sounds of my own footsteps echoed against the concrete walls, amplifying the emptiness of the parking lot.

The basement was dark, with emergency lights always on but dim, creating a play of light and shadow that made me feel watched. The damp stains on the walls and the dirty floor gave a sense of abandonment and neglect. The distant noises of the building's machinery mingled with the sounds of the night, creating an eerie symphony that made me feel increasingly isolated, vulnerable.

At times, I thought about how I ended up in this job, reflecting on my lost dreams and aspirations while passing by the coffee machine, pouring myself a cup with a muddy taste that barely helped me stay awake.

The first time my car failed was on an unusually silent night. The motors and machinery usually used to maintain the emergency lights and other equipment were mute that day, like when you're underwater and perceive the sounds from the surface muffled. The air was filled with an inexplicable tension, a sense of expectancy as if something terrible was about to happen. I tried to start the car, and to my surprise, it wouldn't start.

I sat in the driver's seat, my trembling hands turning the key over and over. Each failed attempt increased my desperation. The minutes passed agonizingly slow, sweat dripping down my forehead in thick drops, soaking my shirt and running down my cheeks. My breathing became increasingly erratic, with short gasps breaking the oppressive silence of the basement. I could feel my heart pounding in my ears, a frantic rhythm adding to my growing anxiety.

The car seemed silent too, a dead machine that wouldn't respond to my pleas. The darkness around me felt increasingly dense, as if the shadows were alive and slowly closing in to envelop me. I could hear the faint hum of the flickering fluorescent lights, the barely perceptible sound of my own distress. I looked around, searching for any sign of life in the void of the parking lot, but all I saw were shadows lengthening and moving subtly in the corner of my eye.

Finally, after sixteen minutes that seemed like an eternity, the car roared to life with a sudden noise that echoed in the emptiness of the basement, bouncing off the concrete walls and amplifying the sound. The engine coughed, breaking the spell of silence that had dominated the place. I exhaled a sigh of relief, my hands still trembling as they rested on the steering wheel.

I sat there for a moment, trying to calm my breathing and convince myself it was just a minor glitch. But when the same problem happened the next day, a growing unease began to consume my mind. Each failed attempt to start the car became a ritual of desperation and fear, and the feeling that something was deeply wrong grew inside me, somehow connected to that car, slowly eroding my sanity. Every night, the drive home was filled with dark thoughts and unanswered questions, increasing my sense of isolation and paranoia.

With each passing night, those sixteen minutes became an endless torture. As I waited, trapped in helplessness, something strange began to happen. Through the rearview mirror, I saw flashes of lights in the depths of the basement, faint at first, but growing brighter as the days went by. At first, I thought it was a reflection, but they increasingly resembled two eyes, although they weren't really eyes. They were just two white lights that blinked three times and then disappeared without a trace. I could never see them directly; they always appeared in a brief moment of three blinks, always in my peripheral vision, always out of reach. But with the certainty that, day after day, they were there.

A chill ran down my spine every time I saw them. I tried to ignore them, telling myself they were just a product of my fatigue, but the reality was that my heart raced increasingly with a growing panic. The basement lights seemed to dance in the dimness, growing wider in their reach. The air grew heavier, and the feeling of being watched intensified with each night.

I felt my breathing become faster and shallower. Cold sweat began to bead on my forehead, my hands trembling as I gripped the steering wheel tightly, clinging to it like a branch about to break. I could feel the pounding of my heart in my ears, a frantic drumming that added to my anxiety. Each flash of light imprinted itself in my mind, leaving a lingering sense of unease long after the lights had vanished. The three flashes became a constant torment, a sign that something was wrong, that something was lurking in the darkness, playing with my sanity.

Over time, those flashes began to dominate my thoughts during the day as well. While working, I could feel a knot of anxiety in my stomach, anticipating the moment when I would have to face those lights again. My coworkers noticed my distraction and exhaustion, but I couldn't share with them what I was experiencing; they would immediately think I was crazy. They had already thought so when, in a moment of vulnerability, I told them about the four years under treatment with medication I had undergone with my psychiatrist. The feeling of isolation and paranoia grew each day, making my world shrink to those sixteen minutes.

I tried to convince myself that it was all a hallucination caused by fatigue, but each time I saw the flashes, my rationality crumbled a little more. I began to avoid looking in the rearview mirror, but fear and curiosity always won, only to confirm that the lights were still there in the corner of my vision, mocking my inability to understand what they were or where they came from. My mind filled with unanswered questions, and each night became a battle against fear and despair.

Each failed attempt to start the car left me feeling more vulnerable and exposed. The concrete walls of the basement seemed to close in around me, as if they were alive and wanted to trap me. The echo of the few sounds I could perceive, like the distant drip of a pipe or the creaking of the building, amplified in the vastness of the empty parking lot, making my skin crawl.

The nights turned into a succession of terrifying and exhausting events. Each time the lights flashed, something went with them. The isolation, extreme fatigue, and constant fear began to take a heavy toll on my mental health. Weeks ago, I even had a full block of time where I couldn't remember how I had gotten home, nor to whom I had lent my sweatshirt, the same one I had worn almost daily for the past three years to work. My eyes sank deeper into their sockets, the dark circles became more pronounced, and my skin took on a pale, sickly tone. The hallucinations during the day became more frequent, more vivid, and the line between reality and fantasy began to dangerously blur.

Those flashes watched me, and I stood there, with sixteen minutes of my day that seemed frozen, my heart pounding wildly in my chest. Anguish gripped my mind, spreading like poison through my body. I began to notice my hands shaking uncontrollably, my knuckles turning white from gripping the steering wheel so tightly. My breathing became a frantic pant, each breath a desperate effort to maintain control.

The accumulated fatigue and pressure of the night shift were affecting me more than I wanted to admit. Despite receiving only a few calls during the night, I couldn't help feeling completely drained. Each call was a small battle that left an indelible mark on my spirit. My thoughts grew increasingly dark and chaotic, as if a cloud of despair was enveloping my mind.

I felt that my mind was on the verge of breaking, a fragile barrier that weakened with each flash of light. My ears buzzed with the echo of my own gasps, amplifying the sound of my frantically beating heart.

I tried to concentrate on other things, recalling happy moments or thinking of rational solutions, but I always returned to the same point: the lights, the fear, and the feeling of being watched, of being singled out. My world shrank to that small space in my car, to those endless minutes that threatened to devour my sanity.

The extreme fatigue made me vulnerable, my thoughts crumbling and fragmenting into a thousand pieces. The deep dark circles under my eyes and the constant tremor in my hands were visible signs of my deterioration. Sometimes, as I turned the key in the car, I wondered how much longer I could endure before my mind finally gave way. Each night became a test of endurance, a desperate struggle to maintain sanity in the midst of a sea of darkness and fear.

At work, I began to have minor hallucinations: hearing voices whispering my name and seeing shadows that seemed to move out of the corner of my eye. The fluorescent lights in the building cast angular shadows that, when flickering, seemed to come to life, feeding my paranoia. One night, while trying to fall asleep after another exhausting shift, I dreamed I was on the road.

The dream was a completely dark scene, with no sound except for a diffuse, constant tapping that resonated in my head, as if someone were dulling pounding my skull from within. The flashes of light in the dream were blinding, appearing and disappearing with a disturbing cadence. I tried to drive, but the road vanished into the darkness, leaving me lost and disoriented. I felt a pressure in my chest, a suffocating sensation I couldn't explain. The shadows at the edge of my vision moved menacingly, and although I knew it was just a dream, I couldn't escape the feeling of impending danger.

I woke up drenched in sweat, my heart pounding with a force that seemed to shake my entire body. My breathing was an irregular pant, and my sheets were soaked. I tried to recall the dream completely, but only disjointed fragments remained in my mind: the total darkness, the dull sounds, and that omnipresent sense of terror that accompanied two lights.

Each morning, after those unsettling dreams, I woke up more tired than before going to bed. The days blurred with the nights in a haze of fatigue and anxiety. Each time I closed my eyes, I feared what I might see or hear. The whispers and shadows at work became more insistent, more real. My coworkers noticed my pallor and the tremor in my hands, but I couldn't explain what was happening to me. Fear and paranoia had become my constant companions, slowly eroding my mental health.

I felt trapped in a strange cycle. Each night, the walk to the basement grew longer and darker, and the flashes of light more brilliant and threatening. My dreams became darker and more disturbing, and the line between reality and fantasy dangerously blurred. Each day, I struggled to maintain a facade of normality, while my mind fragmented under the weight of constant fear and growing hallucinations.

Desperate to understand what was happening, I began investigating the flashes. I meticulously checked my car and the parking lot, hoping it was all due to a leak of some fuel or toxic fluid in the engine. I spent hours inspecting every corner, looking for a logical explanation that could alleviate my growing anxiety. However, I found nothing unusual, only the old dent on the front of the car that had lowered its price the day I bought it, although I couldn't even remember the price.

Each discovery, or lack thereof, brought fragments of fuzzy memories, flashes of repetitive dreams. In my mind, I saw myself driving on a dark road, while everything around me vanished into the darkness. The feeling of getting lost in that darkness was terrifying and constant.

The nights when I couldn't find an answer grew longer and more torturous. I began to question my own sanity, wondering if it was all a product of my exhausted and stressed mind. I saw flashes even during the day, small flickers of light that appeared and disappeared out of the corner of my eye.

The lack of answers consumed me. Each night I felt more tired and less able to face the normalized cycle of empty work and deep terror. The flashes became an obsession, something I couldn't ignore or explain. I felt my world slowly falling apart.

One night, after another exhausting shift, I decided to stay in the car, waiting. The fatigue weighed on my shoulders like a slab, and the anxiety twisted my stomach into knots of tension. The shadows in the parking lot seemed denser, more threatening, as if they were alive and closing in around me. Every dark corner of the basement seemed to harbor an invisible danger, a menacing presence moving stealthily beyond my visual reach.

I tried to move my hand to start the car, but I couldn't. My fingers felt like lead, immobile, trapped by a paralyzing fear. Every attempt at movement was futile, as if my limbs were bound by invisible strings. The paralysis spread through my body, leaving me completely helpless. The sense of powerlessness was overwhelming.

I was paralyzed, reliving something I couldn't fully remember. Fragments of images and sounds filled my mind: the dark road, the flickering lights, the muffled sounds. It was like being trapped in a nightmare of my own creation, one where the shadows and flashes were my jailers. My eyes were wide open, fixed on the flashes reflected in the rearview mirror, each blink a reminder of my terror.

Time stretched infinitely. Seconds turned into minutes, and each minute into an eternity. I felt the panic consuming my mind, my breathing growing increasingly erratic. I tried to scream, but no sound came from my mouth. I was trapped in a deafening silence, where I could only hear the frantic pounding of my heart and the echo of my own thoughts.

The lights flickered with a hypnotic cadence, three rapid blinks that seemed synchronized with the beats of my heart. Each flash was a stab of terror, a reaffirmation of my powerlessness. I knew I was on the brink of collapse, my sanity hanging by a fragile thread.

At that moment, something in the back of my mind struggled to surface, fighting to break the barriers of my subconscious. I could feel there was a hidden truth, something I needed to remember but my mind refused to release. It was an internal struggle, a battle between fear and the need to understand what was happening. But no matter how hard I tried, the truth remained out of reach, buried deep in my memory.

I felt more alone than ever, trapped in the darkness of the basement and the darkness of my own mind. I knew I couldn't go on like this, but every attempt to move, to scream, to escape, was futile. I was trapped in a never-ending nightmare, and the hope of finding a way out faded with each flash of light I saw.

It was then that my coworkers, alarmed by a blood-curdling scream that escaped from my throat and echoed through the entire parking lot, ran to the basement. The sound reverberated off the concrete walls, an echo of pure terror they couldn't ignore. They hurriedly descended the stairs, hearts pounding, fearing the worst. They found me in my car, immobile, my eyes filled with tears and my mouth twisted in a silent, eternal scream. The expression on my face was one of indescribable horror, as if I had seen something beyond comprehension.

They pulled me from the car, my body rigid and trembling, unable to move on my own. Every muscle was tense, as if petrified by fear. My coworkers carried me, whispers of concern and fear filling the air as they quickly took me to the hospital. As we neared the basement exit, the flickering lights seemed to intensify, as if they were bidding me a final, terrifying farewell.

In the hospital, my condition deteriorated rapidly. I lay in bed, my body weak and exhausted. The room was dimly lit, only illuminated by the cold light of the lamp above the bed. The shadows in the corners seemed to move with a life of their own, heightening the sense of unease. The lights on the lamp began to go out, one LED at a time, each emitting a faint buzz before succumbing to the darkness, all except two, which flickered in a three-beat rhythm each time. Those flashes, so familiar and terrifying, filled me with overwhelming panic. I tried to scream, but no sound came from my mouth. I was trapped in a deafening silence, with only those flashes of light for company. The three blinks were a constant reminder of the horrors I had faced, and of those I could not escape.

Paralysis enveloped me, and every attempt at movement was futile. The truth my mind had refused to release was about to surface, and I knew I couldn't go on like this. I was trapped in a never-ending nightmare, and the hope of finding a way out faded with each flash of light I saw. The two persistent flashes were a beacon of my despair, a symbol of my endless torment.

After the sixteenth blink of the pair of LEDs still lit, a memory flooded my mind: the federal highway, a dark and silent night, the empty asphalt stretching out before me. The lights of my Volkswagen began to fail, flickering intermittently in three flashes, plunging me into a darkness that seemed to devour everything. Amid the confusion, a dull thud, something that seemed to have come out of nowhere on the side of the road.

The sudden memory of how I avoided stopping while a roadside sign saying "Federal Highway Number 16" passed by. I didn't stop. I never stopped to see if she was okay. I just drove home in an automated state, my movements mechanical and devoid of emotion. Upon arrival, I inspected the dent on the front of my car, which had been intact until then, where there was a fresh bloodstain. With trembling hands, I cleaned the blood using my favorite sweatshirt, a garment I had worn on so many happy occasions.

I threw the sweatshirt into the trash bin on my block without looking at it twice, as if disposing of it could erase the memory of what had happened. I climbed up to my apartment, each step echoing in the empty stairwell, amplifying the sense of desolation. Entering my room, I collapsed onto the bed, exhausted and disturbed. The weight of what I had done slowly sank into my mind, a heavy burden my conscience tried to reject. My sense of self-preservation swallowed everything that had happened that night, burying it deep in my subconscious.

As this memory surfaced freely for the first time, I lay there, immobile, eyes wide open, staring at the hospital room ceiling while the events of the night played over and over in my mind. The flickering of the hospital lights synchronized with my memories, each flash a reminder of the thud, the fear, and the decision not to stop. The empty road, the dull thud, the road sign... it all blended into a storm of guilt and terror.

The realization of what I had done overwhelmed me, an inescapable truth my mind had tried to suppress for so long. Panic turned into an overwhelming despair, and I felt myself drowning in a sea of remorse.

I suddenly saw from an external perspective the memories of each attempt to start my car, each night. I saw from the outside how, in reality, it was an unconscious root clinging to not let me drive, to read the number 16 on the road each time, translating it into exact minutes of absence of any movement, it was my body trying to avoid the risk of having an accident like the one lodged in my subconscious. My face fixed in the void of the basement, the place where guilt decided to visit me every night, stealthily at first, but blatantly at the end of the terrible episode.

I heard the voices of my coworkers in the distance, worried about how to explain what they had seen to the police waiting in the hallway. The words were a distant echo in my mind, a cacophony of concern and confusion I couldn't fully grasp or understand. I was trapped in my own mind, slowly fading away.

In a final spasm of my body on the hospital bed, I contorted into a strange position, my body twisted at an unnatural but familiar angle. In an overwhelming image, I mirrored the exact position of the woman I had hit. And the sharp memory before falling into the eternal grip of madness from which I would never return: the memory of the rearview mirror showing that contorted figure by the side of Federal Highway 16.

I was lost to madness just as I had entered it, with the image of a body deformed by the impact of a car. But now, remaining in that position in a silent, spasmodic scream to stay in that prison until my last breath.

In my final moment of lucidity, I understood that my mind had created a prison from which I could never escape. Each blink of the lights was a reminder of my unforgivable act, a sign that my spirit was bound to that guilt forever. And so, with the last spark of light fading, I exhaled my final breath, letting the darkness envelop me completely, while saying "sorry."
