Broken World: The Dark Ending
Well here I am stuck in another room. 
Well I guess it's good that I didn't die from murder, or from hunger and thirst. Still. I don't know who these people are. We all stood up until a girl broke the silence.

"Who are you?! Stay away from me!"

The other person tried to calm her down until we came up with an agreement to introduce ourselves. The other man went first

"Ok. Um. My name is Martin and it may seem unbelievable, but before I ended up here I was stuck on an elevator. It was an elevator to hell and the moment before I died, I started to feel faint and ended up here"

With all the weird things I have been through, that guy's.. I mean Martin's story was not that unbelievable. I went to introduce myself next

"HI, I'm Dave, and my story is very weird too. We were trapped in a laboratory called the broken world. Very weird name I know. I had 2 other people with me, but they both died and somehow came back to life. A person told us that a demon was inside one of us. They tried to kill me, but then I ended up in here."

"No way Dave, I think the project I was working on before I was stuck in the elevator was named broken World too"

"What?!? The festival I was at before almost dying was called broken World too. Something weird is going on, but anyway my name is Ashley and I was stuck in a cursed room. I almost died, but like you guys this room we are in saved me from death."

Everyone had very similar experiences like almost dying and something about broken World. By the way, the thing you are reading right now is my journal if you haven't noticed yet. I will make a journal about everything that happens here.

Day 1 Hour 1
Martin and Ashley seemed like really good people, but I'm still traumatized of what happened to me when I had 2 other people with me in a locked room with little resources. These things make people crazy. Anyway, we tried to unlock the door. And guess what? It didn't open.... Wow! What a surprise!

Day 1 Hour 3
People were getting thirsty and the only thing we have in this room so far is 5 empty boxes and skeletons of people who previously died here.

Day 1 Hour 7
We checked box number 1 again and to our surprise we saw water inside. We were insanely sure there was nothing there, but we can't complain.

Day 1 Hour 8
We tried to get sleep, but Martin's snoring is was beyond loud.

Day 2
Both box number 3 and 4 had food inside when we checked. It was like what happened with box 1. Things just start to appear in boxes. 

Day 2 Hour 5
Water is gone. None appeared after the water in the first box. We started to get thirsty and tried to find ways to get water. The good thing is that we still have food and we kept trying to stay healthy to avoid insanity. All of us feel that something is watching us in this room. It feels.... Off. 

Day 2 Hour 6
Liquid. Not water. We found it on box number 1. It was colored red and we had a long discussion on considering to drink it. Ashley already felt dizzy from thirst and she said she feels she might faint. She volunteered to drink it. She opened the bottle carefully. She took a sip and....

I will try to update you all on what happens next
