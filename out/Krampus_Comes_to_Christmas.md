December 2024

“Alright, everyone, it’s time for ‘On This Day 10 Years Ago,’” our editor announced, kicking off our Monday meeting.

This was our weekly ritual: revisiting notable events from a decade prior and assigning stories. A niche concept, but people loved digging up the past, especially the dark stuff. Think of us as a “Whatever Happened To…” for those obsessed with reliving human misery.

December 21 – Winter Solstice – gave us plenty of material: darkness, survival, winter madness (The Shining, anyone?), and other morbid tales. After a rundown, we claimed our pieces.

“Jimmy, you’re on the ‘Jefferson Junior High Band Fire,’” Roger assigned.

I grimaced. “Can I hear the other options? Reporting on grieving families and band-aides isn’t my vibe today.”

“Too late,” Roger shot back. “Besides, you’ve got all year. Nothing says Christmas like Krampus.”

“Krampus is overdone.”

“You’re not the editor,” Roger said, dismissing the argument with a belly-cupping lean.

I spent the morning researching—refreshing myself on the band story and tumbling into the eerie rabbit hole of Krampus folklore. Later, I packed up to attend my daughter Erica’s holiday band concert.

The event was classic: dressed-up kids, proud families, and squeaky renditions of festive songs. With winter break officially underway, I promised my wife, Rowan, and Erica I’d take a week off work. I mostly stuck to it, though reading up on Krampus didn’t feel entirely like cheating.

By January 1, I was ready to dive back in.

\*\*\*\*\*

The Jefferson Junior High Band Disaster occurred on December 21, 2014, in Cordova, Wisconsin, a town known for its location between the North Pole and equator, music festivals, and a devastating fire at the school. The fire during a band concert claimed 56 students, 110 family members, and 8 staff members, trapping them inside an auditorium where the doors locked automatically. Despite footage being removed from the school’s website, it still exists online.

The band's last song, “Krampus Comes to Christmas,” included eerie narration before things went horribly wrong. Survivors’ accounts are unclear, but one person, Kel, the sound guy, filmed the disaster. His footage reportedly shows a giant flaming ball and Krampus appearing, followed by chaos and screams. Kel, now in a psychiatric hospital, accidentally knocked the camera, capturing only screams and a dark scene.

The official story was that faulty doors and an electrical fire caused the tragedy. Since then, the school’s band program has been canceled, and the auditorium remains untouched. I’m now heading to Cordova to investigate further, with a list of two people to speak to: Shelly O’Cavenaugh, the band director’s widow and Liesel Evans, the principal. There are a few more randoms I might be able to meet – not too many, but a few people responded to the Facebook Post we put out looking for leads.

\*\*\*



The North Woods in the winter are bleak. It is dark for much of the day – the sun usually doesn’t rise until 8:00, and it begins to set around 4:00. It’s also cold – the cold that drives people in – either to their homes or to bars. Snow blankets the ground and the buildings, and won’t melt until March. This insular quality can be charming if you’re up there for something like snowshoeing or cross country skiing. But, when you’re turning up stories about a mass child casualty, it can seal you like a tomb.

I got into town after the long drive, much of which was on two-lane country roads. I settled into my room in the town motel, and took the front desk clerk’s advice to have dinner at Otto’s – the local bar and grill. The building creaked, as the wind battered the old windows; ice was building inside the rooms. I’ll tell you, the entire time I was there, I don’t think I took off my coat. Obviously, I was an outsider. 

While this town had its share of visitors during the summer months and in the wake of the tragedy, my outsider vibe stood out like a banner. In a back booth, I sipped my Spotted Cow, and dug into my burger, while I read over some notes. 

“You busy?” a gruff voice asked from behind.

I looked up to see a middle aged man, full beard, a lot of camo, standing at my table with three other men, who could be related, or could have just adopted the same Wisconsin winter look. 

“No, not really,” I said quickly. “What’s up?”

“We heard you’re hear to talk about what happened at Jefferson. That Krampus stuff.”

He said it as a statement – which was slightly accusatory. 

“Well, yeah. I got assigned the story for my job. I wanted to see it, and talk to a few people.”

“No one’s left, you know. That wiped out our kids – most of our friends. Anyone who did live, we drove away. Don’t put your nose where it doesn’t belong, you read me? We let those others leave because they’re one of ours. I don’t think we’d treat you so kindly, if you catch my drift.”

With that, they strode away, and returned to their seats at the bar, turning back frequently, for effect – or to see if what they said was enough to make me leave. 

It was. I quickly finished, left some money on the table, and returned to my room. When i got to my door, I saw a piece of paper folded into the door jamb. I took it, and quickly brought it inside, double latching the door behind me. Taking a breath, I opened it. It was a faded postcard. A grotesque creature with horns and chains loomed over a terrified child. “Season’s Beatings!” it read. Beneath the cheap humor, the image stirred an unease I couldn’t shake. Probably those guys – punctuating the message.

I learned that Shelly and Liesel no longer lived in Cordova, likely because they weren’t welcome after the fire. My plan to get reactions from the townsfolk was now off the table. Instead, I'd visit the site the next day for photos, then head north to find Shelly and Liesel. 

That night, I barely slept, worried the men from the bar might come after me. The wind howled against the window, and the sound of a loose shutter kept waking me, making me think they were at my door.  My mind also kept drifting to Krampus. The terrifying images of him—half-goat, half-demon, leading a procession with flaming torches, chains, bells, and a bundle of birch branches—haunted me. The unsettling sound of his bells and the thought of the sack he used for capturing misbehaving children made the nightmares worse.

\*\*\*\*\*

Groggy, I woke up, thankful for surviving the night. It was early yet, no later than 6. I stopped at a gas station, got some coffee, and headed to the site of the junior high. The building stood – the area where the auditorium had been was changed into a memorial. Though it was still dark out, the memorial was lit brightly. All the names of the children, towns members, and staff were listed – except for Director Karl O’Cavenaugh. This was intentional, I found out. As I stood, taking pictures, I heard a light clicking behind me. I paused and listened, and heard the clicking magnified. Afraid I had been founded, I turned quickly.

Behind me, a herd of deer had gathered, their glassy eyes fixed on me. They stood motionless, save for the occasional flick of an ear. My breath caught—the stillness wasn’t natural. Somewhere in the back of my mind, a snippet of folklore surfaced: animals sense what humans can’t. Suddenly, they all began to slowly shake their heads, left and right. Motionless, I watched. I heeded their warning, and moved towards my car, avoiding the herd. As I drove away, they continued to watch me, in disdain, as I headed into the darkness. 

On the way, I had to see more than 40 deer. Many were mangy, fur coming off in patches. I couldn’t drive more than 40 miles an hour, straining my eyes as I watched the sides of the road. Each one did the same thing – shaking it’s head, as if telling me this was not a good idea. I was already 7 hours from home, and I was close, I could feel it. I’d talk to Shelly. Find a place to stay, head up to Liesel’s and see if I could at least get a “No Comment” in person. And, then I’d drive the 9 hours home and be done with this. 

\*\*\*\*\*

Shelly had returned my emails. As the widow of the band director, she had lost her husband in the fire – and should have been there. Her son was sick, so she stayed home with him, viewing the concert on TV. Shelly was well-liked – she was a secretary at the elementary school, and had grown up in Cordova. Some expressed their sympathies – it wasn’t her fault. But most expressed a persistent, persuasive controlled isolation that gave her the message she was no longer welcome in town. Her parents had died in the fire – they had gone to the Christmas Concert for as long as she could remember. With no one left but David, she moved an hour North, changed her last name, and took a job at the Walmart.

She had settled in Winterland, Wisconsin. The name was fitting as I worked my way through the narrow main road. Snow removal was a creative endeavor in small towns like this – mounds of white were pushed in the center of the road, and filled large parking lots, creating mountains among the squat building. Shelly’s home was on a side street, and I parked somewhat in the middle of the road. I had not seen another car the whole way up from Cordova, and there were no cars out this morning, either. Shelly was waiting by the window, expectantly, as I walked up, and met me at the door. 

“Quick, come in,” she said, pulling the door shut behind her. “Don’t want to let the cold air in,” she said nervously, taking my jacket.

The home was warm, and cozy. It smelled of soup and coffee. We sat in the front room, and Shelly wrapped in a crocheted blanket. She recounted, slowly, the evening. At first we focused on her – i always find you get to the story once you get them talking about themselves. We talked about her guilt – for not being there, and the way the townspeople treated her like she had a contagious disease, causing her and David to move up North. David, for his part, no longer a small child, but now an adult, passed in and out. He had on headphones – the large kind, and didn’t acknowledge our presence. 

“I think he’s had a mental break. Noises bother him – any noise. He wasn’t really like that before his dad died. I did keep the house very quiet after this happened. No music, no TV. I didn’t want to see the news, and any music reminded me of Karl. So, we lived in silence. I think it shocked Davey’s system – he went from a house full of of instruments and singing and dancing – to silence.”

Her recollection of the events were similar to what Kel’s video had shown. According to her, the lines read – mixed in to be narrated over the band, which played discordant chords, were written to summon the beast himself. It had been a rumor, among the music community. Something like this had happened before at the first performance. Only, in that case, the group performing were in a sound studio. But, that space had also caught on fire, and the doors to the studio showed marks from where the musicians had tried to claw their way out before they burned alive, being found in pugilistic posture with a clenched position due to the contraction of muscles in the heat. Karl had heard this – but, when he found the piece, he was convinced it wasn’t true. And, he reasoned, if it was, Liesel would have told him no.

In all my research, I had not heard of this case. I questioned her on this.

“They changed the name. It had gotten a little press in Nashville, I think. But, they just changed the name – not the words, not the song.”

She looked down, and I saw a teardrop on her folded hands.

“We ruined a town. We killed them. And, now I’ve ruined my son. We ruined Christmas.”

“No, no. These things happen. Really – look, I write about stuff like this all the time. There’s always a logical explanation – which doesn’t make it better. But, it’s not his fault.”

She looked up, her face suddenly changed. Her looked angry, her mouth drawn.

“I know it’s not. It’s Ms. Evans. If she hadn’t approved this song – had just said something, it never would have been chosen. She had the authority. It was her job. And, she told him to play it.”

“So what you’re saying is, Karl had to have his music approved? And, Liesel, gave him the greenlight.”

“Yes – it was her. She was the evil one. She’s the one who told him to try something new. She’s the one who gave him the idea to check out the warehouse. Do you know this music was over 75 years old? It had been stored for a reason. But, since she got out – she goes on. And, no one cares.”

This was interesting. I hadn’t heard anything about Liesel, other than the fact that she had escaped. It made more sense about how she had reacted to my requests. There wasn’t much more to talk about, and I timed it out so I could make the couple hour drive during daylight to Lake Superior. I thanked her. 

As I made my way to the door, she handed me an envelope. 

“Just open this when you get where you’re going.” I nodded.

Getting back into my car, I turned on the defrost. The heat I generated on the way up had left a sheen of ice on the interior of my car. Opening the envelope – she couldn’t see me anyway in this ice box, I found the narrator’s lines for the Krampus song. According to her account – as soon as the final line was read, the fire began. How these words ever made it into a middle school band concert are beyond me:

In the cold of winter's grip,

A shadow stirs with frosty lip,

Hooves that echo, chains that clink,

Krampus comes with eyes that blink.

Fur like night and horns like stone,

He moves through towns where lights have grown,

A whistle sharp, a chilling sound,

A monstrous figure, creeping 'round.

With a sack to carry children’s cries,

He steals away beneath dark skies.

The bell’s harsh jingle rings the doom,

As flames rise high in endless gloom.

He knows the weak, 

he knows the sin,

And haunts the hearts that dwell within.

A cruel laugh splits the silent air,

For Krampus seeks those who despair.

Beware the night, the cold and fear,

When Krampus’ steps draw ever near. 

No prayer will save, no door will lock,

His cold embrace the final shock.

In neat script, Shelly (I assume) had written:

*These are the words that were read;  I don’t believe any copies remain. You need to see the words, you need to understand that this is what brought Krampus. If they’re uttered aloud, he comes. Please do not print, and please destroy.* 

So, these words were read – and the town ended up dead. It was chilling. I imagined the kids – screaming, as the fire spread. The parents, trying to find their children, and having these words be the last thing they heard – aside from the anguished screams engulfed in smoke and flames. I looked up – and my windshield was clear. I put my car in reverse, and stopped immediately – flagged by the back up detector. 

Looking through my rearview mirror – I caught the reflection of a buck. Its horns stretched outward, it had to be a 14-point buck. He stood there, steam emanating from his nostrils. Like all the deer before him, he slowly shook his head. Again. I kind of waved my acknowledgement, and went as quickly as I could to the main road to take me out of Winterland, and on to Baycliff.

\*\*\*\*\*

Liesel had been a little less forthcoming in our discussions. Liesel was also at the concert – she had left before the final song, checking her cell phone. She too had a sick one at home – her other two boys, though, were in band. The babysitter had called, asking if Nate could have some ice cream – he had made a miraculous recovery – and while explaining no in five different ways, she heard the doors click behind her, and then the screams. When interviewed about it, she had tired to get it – reports indicate she actually scratched into the heavy wood doors with her nails in an attempt to pry them open.. Liesel had left town not long after the fire; she resigned, and headed even farther north, to Lake Superior, with Nate. They too took new names. She was not willing to do an interview – but, I can be pretty convincing. And, the benefit of sparsely populated places – you can find people pretty easily.

Baycliff was almost in Michigan. On the most northern point of the state, it was even colder, and even more bleak. There was no motel in Baycliff – in fact, it was not even a true town, and from what I had gathered, Liesel didn’t live in town. I made my way into Ashland, found a room, and quickly got fast food. I didn’t want to run into locals. I didn’t want to see more deer. The same thing that had happened on the way to Winterland happened on the way here. Deer – everywhere. In various forms of decay, lined the road. Each of them stared at my approach and passing, their black eyes fixed, their heads shaking slowly.

The night proved uneventful – aside from the banging of the wind, and the dreams of Krampus. I awoke, and lay in bed, lulled by the sound of the radiator blasting heat. Getting up to make coffee, I pulled aside the heavy curtain to see if it was yet light. I took a step back when I saw a shadowy, horned figure etched into the frost on the window, resembling Krampus. It wasn’t a simple condensation pattern or a natural frost formation; it was deliberate, almost as though someone—or something—had crafted it overnight. The room felt small, as this image only reiterated what I was feeling – I had been marked. This eerie omen was left, as if the creature had marked me for some unknown purpose. I felt as if I was being watched, trapped in a cycle I couldn’t escape. I went outside, felt the blast of the below zero temperatures, and tried to scape off the ice from the window. Then, I quickly packed up my room, got dressed, and headed to a local diner for breakfast.

I scanned the room again, my eyes darting to the door every few minutes, and then focused on my coffee. When the waitress came back to refill my cup, I decided she seemed harmless enough.

“Hey,” I began, keeping my tone casual. “You wouldn’t happen to know a woman around here with a son—he’d be about 18 now. Moved up this way maybe ten years ago?”

She tilted her head, giving me a curious look. “Hmm… you mean Lila? Why? What’s going on? She in some kind of trouble?”

“Oh, no, nothing like that,” I said quickly, forcing a laugh. “I’m just an old friend. We were supposed to catch up while I was passing through, but I misplaced her address. And her number, too, somehow.” I added a sheepish shrug for good measure.

The waitress seemed to relax, her suspicion melting into mild interest. “If it’s who I’m thinking of, she’s out by Beaver Creek. Not much out there but trees and a couple of houses. She’s kind of… different, you know? Keeps to herself. Her son’s a hell of an athlete, though. I think he’s headed to college in Florida next year. I saw something about it in the paper.”

“That’s gotta be her,” I said, nodding as if I were relieved. “Weird Lila. Yeah, that’s what we used to call her,” I added with a chuckle, trying to sell the lie.

The waitress didn’t seem to notice anything off and went back to tidying up behind the counter, clearly satisfied with the exchange. Just another stranger in a town happy to gossip about someone on the fringe.

When my food came, I thanked her, ate about half of it, and left some cash on the table. My stomach churned as I walked to the car, though I couldn’t tell if it was from the food or something else entirely.

I pulled up Beaver Creek on my GPS and started east, trying to shake the uneasy feeling that settled over me. I didn’t like this place, didn’t like how it made my skin crawl, but I had to find Lila—or at least say I tried. Then, maybe, I could leave this town behind for good and get back to Illinois.

The drive, as all had been, was desolate. The landscape was white – the ground, the road, the trees – the sky had even taken on the quality of blankness. The only contrast were the dark shape of deer, spotted every so often along the road. Only, now they appeared more sinister. I know they were deer. But they looked different – larger, with larger horns. Their faces took on the look of something sinister. Their eyes blacker. I avoided their gaze and kept my head straight until I hit a road that ran along the river. 

The water churned, dark and brown. The road had one single set of tire marks in it, and I followed those, hoping this was the clue I needed. It was. About a quarter mile up, I saw a Baycliff High School Banner, with the last name Nilsen, and the first name Nathan. I would bet this one was them. And, the tracks I had been following went right to this home. Smoke billowed from the chimney of a small, river stone home. I parked in the drive, and opened my door. The blast of the cold stopped me momentarily. 

As I walked to the front door, I saw movement in the window, just the flutter of a curtain. Before I reached the front door, it opened quickly. 

“Well, you are certainly persistent,” said a small woman, with gray hair and large classes. 

Thought I was at least a foot taller than her, she was intimidating, even in a purple sweatsuit. This was her – I could tell she was a principal by her stance and the way she seemed to look right into my conscious.

“Liesel?” I asked. 

“Yes, unfortunately. You might as well come in – no sense standing in the cold, and letting all my heat out. Take off your boots.”

I did as I was told, and entered the home. 

I would love to tell you I got to the bottom of this. And, that there was a rational explanation for everything. That wasn’t the case. As we sat down, we began to talk about her time in Cordova over coffee. Nate wasn’t home; he was working in Ashland at the Home Depot. He was going to Florida on an athletic scholarship, and Liesel planned on following down there. Winter wasn’t the same, Christmas had been ruined. It was pretty much the same feeling Shelly had shared. Liesel lost her two sons that day, and she and Nathan had decided to not celebrate the holiday anymore. Liesel’s husband had left her, taking hsi own life a few years after, addled by alcohol and grief. 

“There’s not much left to tell. It was awful. It was the worst day of my life. There have been days I wish we were all in there together, and there were days I wished I never made the older two play an instrument. But, you can’t ask questions. You’ll find answers you didn’t need to know.”

“I do have one more question, if you don’t mind,” I said, pulling the envelope out of my coat pocket. “I saw Shelly. She gave me something. A poem, it looks like…”

Liesel shot up immediately, and in one swift movement, grabbed me by the arm, pulling me out of the seat.

“Get out!” she said, picking up my boots. She opened the door and threw them outside. 

“Get out!” she said again – louder this time. She looked into the treeline, back and forth, her eyes filled in terror. “Why would you bring that! That lady wanted you to summon them. She has never accepted she wasn’t the only one who lost anything. We all lost. A part of all of us died that day. But this – she won’t let it stop. If you’ve read it – even to yourself, you’ve summoned it. Get out, and don’t come back. Don’t even take that out again.”

With that, I stood there, shocked. I too looked around, as the door bolts click, click, clicked. 

What had I done? What did Shelly do to me?

\*\*\*\*\*

I drove back to Illinois as quickly as I could. The trip was a blur. I kept my eyes on the road, and didn’t reach home until midnight. Somewhere, on a lone stretch of highway, I had taken the envelope and threw it out the window. The words, harmless, probably, made me paranoid. Having them on me, or even near me, was too much. My only hope was they’d be picked up by a snowplow, and gone forever.

Back in town, I was anxious to get this written and out of my hands. At this point, I was hoping I wouldn’t be on staff by the time this was published. None of this felt right, and I didn’t want to be associated with the story I was about to write. Once done, I’d put out my feelers and find a position writing about prep sports or something.

Roger loved the story – of course, sick bastard. It had just enough mystery. I didn’t include anything about the poem, and I embellished a bit. The final printed article suggested that Liesel admitted the doors were done in a shoddy way; it was the doors. The fire had been due to a malfunctioning sound system they were aiming to replace. 

Krampus did not cause this. Krampus’s words were not to blame. Now, if only I could convince myself of this, I would be fine. It wasn’t that easy though. Each month, something would happen, taking me back to those three days up North. Deer, stopping and judging. Krampus images showing up out of season. Banners across internet pages, where his sinister smile would seemingly eat me alive.

August 2025

I did end up finding that other job. Jimmy Jansen was now the beat reporter for local sports in the Glendale area – and, I couldn’t be happier. Very little drama – aside from the sidelined hero dealing with a torn ACL. I could handle that. The hours were better too, and there was no travel – which meant no deer.

I finished early, one afternoon, and let Rowen know I would pick up Erica. She had started a new year, and I was eager to get a little more one on one time with her. I watched her come out and make her way to my car after leaving her friends. 

“How was the day,” I asked, easing out of the pickup line, glancing at her, smiling.

“Really, really good. Guess what?” I loved when Erica was this animated. I was so fortunate to have some an amazing kid – it got me thinking about Cordova, and all those families. All that tragedy. I thought of Shelly, alone with Davey in Winterland – a perpetual winter for them. I wondered what Liesel was doing, and if Nate made it to Florida. I was lucky. 

“What?” I asked, keeping my eyes on the road.

She continued,  “We already picked Christmas music for the concert – and, we’re doing this really, really weird piece. Mr. Brown said it’s not even published anymore – something about some tragedy. Anyway, he found an old copy in the music room. It’s about this guy – his name is Krampus. Have you heard of him? Anyway, he’s super weird and is the opposite of Santa – so he like, beats you if you’re bad. Anyway, it’s called “Krampus Comes to Christmas” and I get to be the reader – I read all this really dark stuff about him coming for all of us. Isn’t that cool? I am already counting down to Christmas…”
