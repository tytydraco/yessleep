I had the distinct impression that this was the kind of place I would have found a shotgun in my face if I hadn’t been invited.

I was in a community of three double-wide trailers sat in a semi-circle in a clearing, bordered on all sides by forest so thick you’d need a chainsaw to cut a path through it. It’s a large parcel of land down a long private, dirt driveway off a back road that was itself  far from any major arteries. That’ll give you the proper impression of the Greenhill estate and how isolated it is. Solar panels sat on the roofs of the trailers, right next to Starlink satellite dishes. A diesel generator roared somewhere nearby. To the north was a steep drop-off into a ravine, and to the east was a gentle decline into a gravel pit. Near the ravine was an old arts-and-crafts style house, burned and partially collapsed.

Timothy—the scrawny man who had driven me from town in a worn-out old ’94 dodge that rattled when he geared up—waved me to follow him back around behind the trailers. “Right this way, professor,” he said in that rural drawl I would have found endearing if he would have stopped speaking for even just a moment on our two hour journey. Along and in between the trailers there were gardens of corn, tomatoes, carrots, and many different kinds of flowers. I passed beneath a rattan arch, thin vines growing up and over it. It was an impressive display of a dedicated horticulturalist.

Around the other side of the trailers, inside the protected semi-circle of the —  well, I’ll not quite call it a ‘village’ — stood a man wearing nothing but a pair of mid-thigh jean-short cutoffs and flip-flops, silver can of Coors in-hand. He was lean, tall, with the tail of a blonde mullet sprouting from the back of his red snap-back hat. His beady eyes watched me approach and I was given the distinct impression he was appraising me based on the way I walked and dressed. Suddenly conscious of my Oxford shoes and horn-rimmed glasses, I reached out to shake his hand but instead of meeting me the man lifted his beer in greeting.

Garden Joe was, of course, an amputee, the nub of flesh of his left arm ending just before where his elbow should have been.

You don’t have to believe this next part if it breaches your assurance of a rational, physics-based reality, but you do have to understand my position on the matter. This happened in 2020 and I’m only just now writing my thoughts down into something approaching a coherent story, collected from a thousand Post-It notes and recordings on my phone. At the time I was a professor of anthropology at a small university in the Deep South—I won’t tell you where, even though I’m sure you could probably figure it out on your own if you try hard enough. My specialty is in the rituals, occult matters and demonic possessions that spread in America during the Age of Reason. The long and short of it is this: As people left their farmsteads and plantations and began moving into the industrializing cities for work, they took with them the stories of beasts haunting their local woods, evil witches and their dark rituals, eldritch beings from beyond the veil of sanity.

But this story isn’t about any of that. This story is about Garden Joe, redneck wizard.

"Okay," I said, withdrawing my hand, feeling stupid. “Show me what you got, Joe."

Garden Joe downed the last of his beer, crumpled the empty can against the side of his head, and tossed it over his shoulder, where it landed with a metallic clatter among a pile of empties. He cracked all the knuckles on his one hand by pushing them up against his hip, then extended his arm out in front of him and wiggled his fingers.

In the silence that followed, Joe let out a loud belch, wiped his mouth, and spoke. “Now, I need to do some concentratin'," Joe said, his voice a note higher than I had expected. "So, ya'll be quiet now.” He cleared his throat like he was trying to remove seven days of phlegm from it, and hummed a deep, low bass, the single note resonating from his chest. As it grew in volume his whole body vibrated, before he stopped, allowed a second of silence, pointed one finger at a bare patch of dirt some 20 feet away.

"Alcatraz!" Garden Joe shouted, and a burst of milky smoke erupted from the tip of his finger and shot forward at a frightening speed, exploding into the dirt patch and spreading out to cover it.

Timothy let out a ‘whoop’ beside me and smacked me with the back of his arm. “See that! I told you he could do magic!”

“Okay,” I said, a little breathless. It was not my first time seeing real magic but it had been rare enough in my life that I was taken aback every time.

"Hush now, you two,” Joe said. “Watch the spot and let it clear…”

I did, and as the milky cloud thing began to dissipate I noticed what had taken shape in the dirt patch: a small fruit tree, no taller than shoulder height, but with brownish little fruits hanging from it.

"Those're figs," Timothy announced. "My daddy showed me those before and those're figs!" He marched forward and slapped Joe on the back. “You haven’t made figs before, Garden Joe! Goll-*ee!*”

"Can you do that again?" I asked.

“Sure thing, teacher-man,” Joe said, and sang that low hum again. Once more he vibrated for a moment before stopping and pointing his index finger at a different spot, this time where an old wooden sandbox sat neglected and muddy, out front of the old house. “Alcatraz!" The same milky puff of not-quite-smoke shot from his fingertip and covered the sandbox. When it had vanished a small forest of life had overgrown the structure, including fully mature trees and and dense ground vegetation.

Joe turned around with a wide grin of pride on his face, displaying the gaps in his teeth.

"Tell me how," I said.

“Why? You goin’ write a report about me? Make a Youtube video?”

“Maybe. Yeah. You okay with that?”

“Hell, yeah brother! I might as well get this magic out to the world; figured my time is comin’ soon.”

“Why do you think that?”

He shrugged. “Don’t know, just a feelin’.” He sniffed. “You thirsty?”

“Sure,” I said.

"All started in 2012," Joe explained with his face stuck in the fridge inside his trailer. I had sunken myself into the old sofa beside Timothy, but it wasn't just the three of us—a large woman weighing in excess of 350lbs was sprawled out on a bed at the back of the trailer, ignoring us while she watched something on an old Panasonic with the volume low. Joe snapped up three beers and passed them out to us. The can was cold and wet in my hand. “Timothy will remember this because it was when we met and became friends at the Mayan Convention.”

Timothy nodded. "That's right. Remember when you laid out ol' Corchester with one good punch outside the hotel bar?” He mimed squaring up and punching out an unseen opponent, before bursting into an odd chuckle that sounded like machine gun fire.

"Hey, hush now, Timothy. I've got a story to tell the professor." But the man was in no rush; he pushed himself up on top of the kitchen counter, the top of his head nearly scraping the ceiling, and searched his pockets. Joe pulled out some rolling papers and a dimebag, carefully sprinkling its contents out onto one of the papers before expertly rolling it up with one hand. “Grow it myself,” he said when he noticed me watching. “Finest in the land.” He ran his nose along the joint and sniffed. “I had just gotten back from deployment, professor. They were dischargin’ me on account of ol’ stubby here.” He waved the stump of his arm and cleared his throat. "Anywho, aunty said I should take up gardening, keep my head busy while it dealt with all the trauma and tried to fix itself."

"Were you ever diagnosed with anything?"

He nodded, slow and serious. “Well, certainly: PTSD… Pretty Tall Substantial Dick disorder!” The two friends burst into laughter. I waited patiently for them to finish and for Joe to continue his story. He stuck the freshly-rolled joint between his teeth and grinned at me, then blindly searched the cluttered shelf behind him, fishing out a lighter. “Don’t trust doctors.”

“But you trust me.”

“Well, you ain’t a doctor.”

“I have a doctorate; I am a doctor.”

He regarded me, joint in his mouth, lighter clasped just beneath it. “You ain’t a *head doctor*. I got real sick of them treatin’ me like I was going to shoot myself every time I went to one of my mandatory VA appointments.” He paused, glanced at the lighter. “I can do other stuff you know, it’s not just gardenin’. Catch!” He tossed the lighter to me and I fumbled for it. “I ain’t so good with fire yet, but…” He cleared his throat and started humming that deep bass note again. The vibration this time was smaller, more local to his finger, which was brushing the tip of the joint. “*Shazam*,” he muttered through gritted teeth, spark erupted from his finger and lit the cigarette.

Timothy whooped, smaller this time, I couldn’t help but clap. It was a decent party trick.

Joe shrugged as he sucked back on the joint, as if it were all no big deal. "So anyway," he said, exhaling. "I noticed that things grow real fast when I'm gardening. Like, faster than they have any right to. But I don't know much about it so I don't see anything wrong with it 'till it's pointed out to me." He leaned across to offer me the joint and I turned him down.

Timothy cackled. "And he weren’t even—he weren’t even tryin' to grow *tomatas!*”

Joe laughed along with him. “I thought it was normal to have plump tomatoes after three days! I thought they was just *easy to grow!* Like weeds or somethin’! As time went by, I got better and better  at it.” He passed the joint to Timothy and transitioned back to drinking his beer. Over the next 20 minutes, three beers and two joints, he told me a meandering tale of growing plants, starting a gardening and landscaping business, getting cheated out of his half of it by his business partner, and trashing that guy’s house to send a message.

It had remarkably little to do with the occult.

“You don’t know why you are the way you are,” I summarized.

He tapped the beer can to the side of his head and winked at me. “Maybe it’s the Mayan prophesy. Maybe it’s because I got a little Indian blood in my veins. Maybe somethin’ inside me changed when those Blackthorpes took my sister, changin’ me into a magic-man, of a type.” He took a gulp of beer. “I know what you’re thinking: ‘Garden Joe doesn’t look like no wizard *I’ve* seen before.’”

“That may be true, but magic doesn’t typically manifest itself in people based on what they look like. It usually has more to do with powerful emotions, like when you experience trauma. What’s this about your sister?” Like I said, it’s my area of expertise.

“Huh,” was all Joe could say.

“Garden Joe, you are perfect just the way you are,” Timothy declared, then turned to me. “The Greenhill family and the Blackthorpe family go way, way back. Like ancient times back, more than a hundred years! They are *evil*, those Blackthorpes.”

Feuding, back country families? Generational clashes stretching back to the 1800’s like the Hatfields and McCoys? I wanted to ask more about this but Joe was already moving on.

“Ya know, I been thinkin’. I *love* Jesus. Aunty knows how much I love Jesus, don't you, aunty?” The large woman grunted from the back of the trailer but kept her eyes on whatever was playing on the Panasonic. "I love Jesus, but now I'm startin' to wonder... Maybe I love Jesus so much because I'm Him. Like, He is me, from a different time and place, if you catch my drift.”

I cleared my throat, gave my own Coors a careful sip. "Well," I said after swallowing. "That would really be something to believe in.”

“I’m the only man in existence that can create life out of nothing.” He seemed to mediate on this thought for a moment. Suddenly, Joe was on his feet, beer held high like he was toasting someone. "What if I, Joseph G. Greenhill, were the *Lamb of God*?”

An uncomfortable silence, then Timothy spoke. "Ya know, they say the fruit Adam and Eve ate in the garden of Eden wasn't an apple at all, because they didn’t have no apple trees back then. It was a fig tree."

"Timothy, that's the smartest thing I ever heard come out from between those big lips of yours.” Joe glanced between us, excitment growing on his face. “You fella’s wanna go shoot some guns?” The two of them left for outside, yipping and hollering. I chose to stay behind; I had some questions for the woman in the back.

“You’re Joe’s aunt?” I asked her

“That’s right,” she said, flicking her eyes from the tv to my face, but only briefly, then it was back to her show. She looked to be about 50 or 60. There was an unlit cigarette lying in an ash tray near her abdomen, a third of it missing.

“Where’s his mother these days? I was hoping to ask her some things about the family history.”

“Dead,” she said, monotone.

“I’m sorry.”

“Don’t be. It was all her fault, anyway.” Credits rolled on the TV. She sighed, reached for the remote and flicked it off. Now we were in the dark, with nothing more than sunlight sneaking in from between the curtains.

“The Greenhill land is beautiful,” I offered. “It looks like the forest here has never been worked. It’s ancient and primeval in a way I’ve never seen before.”

“New York?”

“State, yeah.”

“Thought so, had that sort of funny speech about you.” I caught a flicker of a smile on her lips.

“The old house outside is beautiful too. It’s rare to see turn of the century architecture like that these days. Is it habitable?”

She threw her hands up as if to say ‘look around’. “I wouldn’t be livin’ in this trailer if it were habitable.”

“Well, maybe Joe can fix it now he’s… the way he is.”

“Yeah, maybe, but just try and get him away from his beer-drinkin’ with his friends for a moment to accomplish something. That boy has not worked a normal job in years.” A crack of rifle fire rang out in the distance.

“At least you’ll always have food to eat.” She rolled her eyes. “All this stuff about him calling himself the Son of God, the reincarnation of Jesus… What’s your thoughts on that?”

“Oh, Joe’s just drunk. He don’t believe that, not really. If he were Jesus how come he’s only got one arm?” She laughed. “His momma always claimed he was a miracle baby. I didn’t realize she meant it like this.”

“A miracle baby? Like, in what way?”

“Immaculate conception. Unlikely, ‘cause she was slickin’ around town with every boy she could get with when we was younger. Lo’ and behold, she got herself pregnant! Claimed it was all a misunderstandin’ and she was still a virgin. Daddy damn near tore through town lookin’ for the boy who done that to her. We never did find out who Joe’s father was.”

“Who was his mother?”

“Mary.” I nearly choked on my beer. “Oh, I suppose I mean ‘Marigold’. We were both named after flowers; it was something people did back in the 60’s. My name’s Sunflower, by the way, but you can call me Aunty.”

I truly hope Ms. Sunflower Greenhill never reads this; I don’t want her to know that I think ‘Marigold’ is a much better name than ‘Sunflower’.

“Your father?” I asked.

“Dead too. Buried with the others behind the house, if you want to take a look. Every Greenhill is buried on this property datin’ back to 1813. Well, ‘cept for Leanne.”

“Your niece. Joe said she was taken by the Blackthorpe family.”

She waved the idea away. “Blackthorpes are bad, but they’re not *kidnapping-and-murdering* bad. Joe will say they used her in some bloody ritual or somethin’. Like a sacrifice. It ain’t true. That child is long gone from here.” Another gunshot. I thought I could hear the two of them outside cheering. “Them forests ain’t primeval, you know,” she said. It took me a beat to realize what she was talking about.

“And why is that, um, Aunty?”

She smiled a self-satisfied smile. “Well, before the white people got to these lands it was the Indians that lived here. And they cultivated the forests in a way that ensured there were always fruit trees, and nut trees, and plants that animals liked to eat. It was like a garden, just not one us white people could recognize. They looked right through the forest and only saw the trees and shrubs.” She reached for the cigarette and brought it to her mouth, searching around for something to light it with.

“Allow me,” I said, bringing forward Joe’s lighter.

She accepted, and breathed the cig’s smoke in deeply, nearly finishing it one go. She cleared her throat and coughed, then stubbed the thing out on the tray, still not completely finished. Still good for another day. “And now the Indians are all gone and the forest is too overgrown to cut through. Can’t find anything in that thick bush. Joe did that, ya know? When he gets it into his head that he’s gonna do something there’s no convincing him otherwise. Things get crazy around here and I just ride myself into town and stay at a friend’s for a few days. I disappear, just like the Indians.”

I nodded. “Joe said your family has Indian blood in it?”

She shrugged. “Might as well. Been here long enough.”

That evening, we had a BBQ with many of the Greenhills that lived on and off the property. I met a lot of ‘cousins’ and ‘uncles’, many of whom brought their kids. Joe seemed pleased as hell to be cooking for them all, throwing on ribs and brisket and hotdogs for the children, but I never saw him eat any of the meat. The only thing he consumed was roasted corn and beer, with a small salad prepared from the fresh ingredients of his garden.

Was Garden Joe a vegan?

When night fell we moved to the gravel pit for a bonfire. Garden Joe had his arm slung across the shoulders of a brown-haired woman with a neck tattoo of a crying bird. Timothy was slumped in a tattered camping chair, drunk or tired from the day’s events. I was feeling it myself, with the long drive, seeing the magic, walking around the Greenhill property, eating and drinking. Someone had broken out the homemade whiskey, and we all had a cup in hand.

"I always wanted to apologize to ya'll," Joe announced, slurring his words, still hanging off his girl. "I never meant to get any of ya'll involved in this. I don't even know what I'm doin', not properly anyway."

"You ain't got nothin' to worry about, Garden Joe!" one of the girls called out from across the bonfire. Several people cheered in response.

“Gosh,” Joe said. "Everyone always cheers me up. I know can always count on the good folk livin' here. Good, proper, red-blooded Americans! I know you people have my back, and we’d go to war for each other, wouldn’t we?” The group whooped and hollered. Joe did his hum-vibrate maneuver and pointed his hand at the base of the bonfire. I braced myself, stepping back a bit, unsure what a drunk wizard could do.

“Shaboozy!” he shouted. The flames shot upward, licking higher than any other fire I had seen before, lighting up the whole gravel pit. I stepped stumbled backward from the intense heat on my face. The crowd cheered and clapped at the magic, lifting their whiskey cups to honor Joe.

“Ya’ll are too good,” Joe said, his face red. “Especially you, Timothy." Joe stumbled toward his friend, still slumped in the chair. "You're the best friend a guy like me could ever asked for. If I could, I woulda’ done that thing you asked for, know that?"

"Oh yeah, sure, I know that," Timothy said, eyes darting around at the others in attendance. “D-don't need to go over it in front of—"

"Timothy, if I had the capability, I'd have made you into a woman, just like you asked for. You deserve *anything* in the world that you want.” I thought it was a mean-spirited joke but there were real tears rolling down Joe’s cheeks. "But I can't change things, I can’t alter life! I can only *create* it!” He collapsed to his knees and cried into his friend's shirt. "By the grace of god, I can create life but I can't change anything for the better!"

He was a blubbering mess, and Timothy, cheeks scarlet with embarrassment, held his friend while he cried it out. The rest of the party continued on, but quieter, not as raucous.

When I thought it appropriate, somewhere between my second and third whiskey, I slipped away from the fire and toward the ’94 dodge. I passed by the big, old house and it loomed up out of the dark, half burned and ready to turn to dust. It was like a monument to better times for the family, when they were more prosperous, when money flowed in more easily. With the closure of the mines there had been very little work available here, and I suspect most people had moved off the property even before the house became unlivable. It really seemed like this was all they had left.

I stood there at the foot of its steps, gazing up at it. And just as I looked away there was a flash of movement in the second-story window. Something had caught the moonlight for a moment, something large and pale. I squinted at the window, willing the thing to show itself again.

An owl hooted down at me from the roof. I laughed, turned away and said drunkenly, “‘I felt so lonesome I most wished I was dead.’”

Lying down in the bed of the pickup, staring at the stars overhead, I thought about this strange thing happening in a place so out of the way. There was a good chance the outside world didn’t know a thing about Joe’s magic — probably because he lived in the poorest county of a state that was already one of the poorest. Maybe outsiders couldn’t see what was going on here because of preconceptions about people that lived below the poverty line, and stuff that was worth knowing about. I had my own uncomfortable truths I needed to mull over that night.

Timothy drove me back into town the next morning. This time it was *I* who was jabbering on, trying to keep the conversation going to fill the silence. He was quiet for most of it, only speaking when I asked him a direct question.

A week later, though, he contacted me again. Told me Joe had gathered up a posse of cousins and they had marched down to the Blackthorpe property to ‘raise hell’. Said I had a way with words and he didn’t know who else to call for help.

What happened on the Blackthorpe property made me wish I had never picked up that phone.
