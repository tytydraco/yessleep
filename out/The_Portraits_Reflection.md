The moment I stepped into the Whitmore estate, the air turned cold. The grand foyer stretched before me, its marble floor dulled by decades of neglect. Dust motes drifted through the shafts of moonlight spilling in from high windows, and somewhere far off, wind whispered through broken panes. I was alone—except for the painting.

Hung above the cracked mantel was a portrait of a woman. Her dress was early Victorian, her hair piled high, and her eyes met mine with unsettling clarity. I felt her watching me as I unpacked boxes in what had once been the drawing room.

I’d inherited the house from an uncle I barely knew. He’d left no note, only a single key and a legal deed naming me his sole heir. I’d come for closure, to sort through his hoarded possessions, and then sell the place. Ghost stories didn’t scare me.

On my first night, I set up a small cot beneath a single exposed bulb and drifted to sleep with the portrait’s gaze hovering in my dreams. I dreamed of the woman stepping out of the frame, her long skirt whispering across the floor.

At exactly 3:03 AM, I awoke to the bulb flickering. The room was layered in shadows. I sat up, listening to a soft scrape—like fingernails against wood—from the far corner. My heart pounded, but I forced myself to stand. The air smelled faintly of oranges, a scent that reminded me of my grandmother’s kitchen.

I shone my phone’s flashlight toward the painting. The woman’s face looked different. Her lips curled in a subtle smile, and although her eyes remained fixed on me, the dark corners beneath them were deeper, hollow. I blinked—and the flicker passed. The face reverted to its original, expressionless calm.

I backed away, footsteps echoing on the marble. That’s when I noticed it: a thin crack running across the glass of the frame, like the beginning of a spider’s web. I reached out and touched it. The frame trembled, and a whisper, soft and urgent, curled around me.

“Find her…”

I recoiled, stumbling backward into a chest behind me. Old letters spilled out, yellowed envelopes addressed in elegant script to “Catherine Whitmore.” I swept them up and fled the room, the whisper following me down the hallway until I slammed the door.

In the morning, with daylight burning away the shadows, I examined the letters. They told a story of betrayal: a forbidden affair, a jealous husband, and a promise of vengeance. Catherine had sworn that if she died, her spirit would return to claim retribution. The final letter ended mid-sentence, the ink smeared as if the writer had been interrupted.

That evening, I shoved the painting into a side room and locked the door. I refused to listen for whispers. I refused to believe.

At 3:03 AM, the bulb flickered again. Footsteps approached on the other side of the door—slow, deliberate. I pressed my ear against the wood and heard a voice, low and ragged.

“Find me…”

The lock clicked. My breath caught. I stepped back as the handle turned.

The door creaked open to reveal the portrait, standing propped in the doorway, its frame ghostly pale. The glass was gone, and behind the painting, Catherine Whitmore herself stepped forward. Her dress was shrouded in mist, her eyes black holes of sorrow and rage.

“You pledged to free me,” she whispered, voice hollow. “Now you must join me.”

I ran, stumbling down corridors lined with mirrors. Each reflection showed her behind me, closer and closer, until I reached the grand staircase. I leaped down the steps two at a time, bursting through the front door into the chill night air.

When I dared to look back, the mansion was silent. The windows were dark, the front doors closed as if they’d never been opened. In my hand, I still clutched Catherine’s last letter. The ink had shifted, revealing new words where none had been before:

“Release me, or forever be part of my collection.”

I dropped the letter, but long after I fled, a soft creak echoed behind me—like fingernails against marble.
