I recently lost a friend of mine.. his name was Daniel, and we've been friends for a very long time. We've been friends since high school, and he was like a brother I never had. He was nice, funny, and he was always there to help me out in need. We liked to play videogames, arrange beyblade tournaments, and we even watched same shows together. He was my only friend, and I was his only friend in school. We even went to the the college together.

But one day, everything changed, when I found out that my friend got killed by some psycho in the alley on his way home. Apparently some thug tried to rob him and Daniel tried to defend himself, but got stabbed in the chest and gut by a pocket knife. When I arrived at the scene of the crime, I felt sick to my stomach. My friend was lying dead before my very eyes in a puddle of his own blood. Officer told me that they'll try to find the culprit soon. I trusted the police in my city, since they do their job well, so I was sure that the bastard won't get away. 

Rest of the day I layed in my bed, thinking about good times, trying to not get too upset over my only friend dying.. but I couldn't. I couldn't believe that the only person who I could consider my best friend is gone. If I said I did not cry into my pillow, I would be lying. It just hurt so much. That's when I decided that I will personally arrange his funeral, just as a way to give him a good farewell and repay him for what he did for me. 

I spent next week planning out the funeral. What kind of coffin will I get for him, how the gravestone will look, what music will play and most importantly how much money I will have to spend for the funeral. I had little amount of birthday money, half of which I spent on new beyblades. If I knew what would happen, I would save them for later.. but it's alright, I can deal with this. I had no clue what to do, since I never arranged or saw someone arrange a funeral before, nobody taught me anything. But I can always try to improvise.

I was so focused on planning a perfect funeral that I forgot to invite the guests. So I tried to find people who I can invite. Of course I tried to invite my parents, but they said they couldn't attend the funeral, but they sent me some money at least. My college teacher told me that he's going on a meeting at the time when I am going to arrange a funeral. And sadly, Daniel only talked to me and never communicated with anyone as far as I know. He also did not have any parents, only Grandma who passed away 2 months ago. Daniel was always a loner, guess I never realized.

Basically, I had nobody to invite to his funeral, meaning that the only guest that will be present, will be me. But even so, I must say goodbye to my best friend properly. But first I needed to get the body of Daniel, and I already knew what I had to do. I may have been doing illegal things at that time, but it was for the good cause. I had to break into the morgue, get the body, put it in my car, drive to my place, and put it in the coffin. I did buy coffin and a tombstone for my friend, it was a bit pricey though, but it was all worth it. 

So I decided to drive to the morgue at night. I parked my car where nobody can see it, and I wore a black disguise, so that no one can figure out who I was. Daniel taught me how to pick locks, just Incase I'll lose my keys and I'll need to open something. I successfully opened the door and started my search. I found the room where bodies are stored, and after several minutes of looking at tags, I found him.. Daniel. His chest was covered in these horrible stab wounds left by that thug.. they made me sick, so I tried not to look at them for too long. I locked the door, and put the body of my dead friend in the back of my car. When I arrived, I placed his body inside the coffin, but because I did not want him to be fully naked inside the coffin, so before going to sleep I put one of my suits on him. Dressing up a cadaver made me feel like I am dressing up a giant Ken doll, it felt weird, but strangely nice. 

On the next day, I drove to a grassy field that was next to a forest at the edge of my town. I thought it'd be a perfect place to bury Daniel in, plus nobody will see us. The chairs were arranged in perfect order. The coffin was sitting on a folding table, and next to the table there was another chair with a record player, playing Daniel's favorite song. Even though I was all alone, is still decided to give a speech about how dear Daniel was to me. After that, I pat Daniel on the head and was ready to bury his coffin and say goodbye to him. 

After several minutes of silence, and a several minutes of me crying, I decided that it is time to bury the coffin. I already prepared a hole for him. Since I lacked strength, I pushed the coffin to the hole. I put an old mattress of mine into the hole, because I can't lower the coffin properly, and I carefully dropped the coffin into the hole. The coffin landed on the mattress, but I did hear a small sound of something cracking. I said sorry to Daniel for possibly breaking his coffin by accident. I proceeded to bury him into the ground. It was over. I put bouquets on my friend's grave and said my said goodbye to him. 

I spent my time listening to our favorite songs, while lying on the grassy floor, watching red evening sky. I decided to drive back home, on my way I looked back at that field where I buried Daniel. Even though everything was over, I still wanted to come back, I didn't want to leave Daniel, but I must. Even though I was all alone on that field, I still felt some kind of presence there. Like something was sitting infront of me while I gave my speech. It's weird, I know..

On the next day, news about sudden disappearance of a cadaver broke out. Police are currently trying to find the culprit, but there is little to no evidence to be found, and whereabouts of the body are still unknown. Police came to my house and tried to interrogate me, but I told them that I had no clue where the body is either. They did not suspect anything. Even if they did find me suspicious, I don't care that I would get put in jail for stealing a corpse of my dead friend. I did it for a good cause after all, right?
