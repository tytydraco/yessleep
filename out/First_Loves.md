Alarm: 7:30 am

Brush teeth: 7:32 am

Get dressed: 7:40 am

Downstairs brewing my coffee: 7:45 am

Coffee on my front patio: 7:50 am

Clean up and leave for work: 8:00 am

My schedule has been consistent for 18 months. Wake up, get dressed, drink my coffee. Go to work at a job where no one would notice if I died, and come home. Ready to do it all again the next day.

It’s soul-sucking. It makes me feel robotic, but routines are good. Routines help.

At least that’s what my therapist says.

My only solace in my daily schedule is taking my coffee outside, especially this time of year. The fall air is crisp and clean, and the bright leaves feel like I’m living in a postcard.

I sit on my inherited wicker bench every morning and enjoy the day, watching the local kids bike to school. Their giggles bouncing off the trees. I nod hello to my neighbors who still avoid my gaze, and I watch the forever vacant house across from me loom over the neighborhood.

I take a deep exhale, and close my eyes.

“Gorgeous morning, isn’t it?”, Abigail says, wobbling up my front porch with her mug and making her way over to me.

I smile at her arrival.

“It is, even more gorgeous now that you’re here though.”, I respond, shifting over to make space for her.

She laughs softly, and slowly lowers herself to the seat. Once she’s comfortable, she lays her cane on the ground next to us.

“You’re too sweet to me, dearie. How are we feeling today?”, she asks, gently placing her wrinkled hand over mine.

I smile at her softly. Abigail lives to my right, as she has for over 50 years. She and my Nana were best friends since they were teenagers and Abigail moved next door. They loved living next to one another so much, they did it for the rest of their lives. When I moved here to live with my Nanna, Abigail was like a second grandmother.

My Nana was everything to me, she still is. When she died almost two years ago, I couldn’t handle it.

Some days, I still can’t.

“I’m okay today, the pretty weather helps.”, I answer honestly.

Abigail nods, and softly bumps her mug against mine.

“Cheers to the okay days, they are just as important.”, she tells me with a twinkle in her eye.

Nana seemingly got sick out of nowhere, she was healthy. Older, yes. But.. Good. Her doctor’s appointments were always glowing, he expected another 15 years out of her. And then she was just… Gone.

She had been feeling sick for a few days, nothing major. A slight cold. We went to the farmer’s market the day before, and she was happy as a clam. The next morning, I went into her room with her morning tea and..

She wasn’t my Nana anymore. Her laughter had left, her eyes were open but.. dull. When I touched her hand, I immediately knew.

I dropped the mug, screaming. I rushed to hold her, shake her. I begged her to wake up for me. I cried into her duvet cover.

Nana was all I had. I had lived with her since I was three, when my mom had passed away from a drug addiction. Grandad died about ten years ago from cancer, I couldn’t handle losing her too.

I ran out the front door, screaming for Abigail, the police, a god I don’t believe in. I remember collapsing on the grass. Shrieking and sobbing.

My neighbors had called the police, and they’ve never looked at me the same since. 

Then the whispering started, mostly about me being unstable. How I probably killed my Nana just to inherit her house. How I should look into an extended stay at a mental facility.

I can’t say that I blame them, but I still hate them for it.

The therapist was Abigail’s idea, and she was right as usual. I wouldn’t be able to do this without her.

“You’ll have to leave for work soon, anything exciting happening today? Halloween party?”, Abigail asks, bringing me back to the present.

I shake my head.

“Nah, my job isn’t very fun. Maybe someone will bring in some cupcakes, but no party.”, I tell her.

“Well.. If the cupcakes look good, bring me one.”, she says with a wink.

I laugh as she starts to grab her cane.

“Do you want me to walk you to your door?”, I ask, putting my hand under her arm to help her stand.

“I’m okay today, I think. Have to push myself, especially on just the okay days. Have a great day, dearie girl.”, she responds, kissing me on the cheek.

“Dinner tonight?”, I call out as she crosses the short sidewalk.

“Sure, your choice!”, she responds, waving to me as she walks through her front door.

*

After work, I head to the nice grocery store. It’s a little out of the way, but Abigail loves their cheese counter. I make the plan for Philly Cheesesteaks, and gather everything I need, including two different types of cheese for our sandwiches. I’m just pulling into my driveway when I see a light on in the house across the street from me.

I pause, and squint at the upstairs window.

I asked Nana about the house once, and she shrugged. She said no one has ever lived there, even since she’s moved in.

I watch the house for another moment, waiting to see movement in the windows, but it remains still.

Hmmm… Maybe a realtor checking the place out? Are they finally putting it on the market?

I shrug, and walk next door to Abigail’s small house. I push open the familiar door and warm light spills out onto the dark sidewalk.

“Honey, I’m home!”, I call out, and somewhere in the house I hear Abigail cackle.

As I turn to close the door, I see the light in the house across the street has now gone out.

*

Abigail and I are just sitting down to eat, when I decide to see what she knows.

“Abigail, have you ever seen someone in the house across from me?”, I ask, handing her a paper napkin.

“Oh this looks scrumptious, you’ve outdone yourself!”, Abigail exclaims, practically salivating.

I laugh at her excitement, though she says that every time I make dinner.

“I hope you like it! It smells amazing..”, I take a sip of my water, “So have you?”

Abigail takes a big bite and hums in glee.

“Have I what, dearie?”, she asks.

“Have you ever seen someone in the house across from me?”, I repeat.

Abigail thinks for a second, and then nods her head slowly.

“Yes, but it was a long time ago.”, she answers.

“How long?”, I ask.

“Right after I moved next door, about the time I met your sweet Nana..”, she smiles, but it doesn’t quite reach her eyes, I know how much she misses her.

“So.. What.. 65 years ago?”, I clarify.

She nods thoughtfully.

“Give or take, yes. There was a family who lived there. Beautiful family. They had a teenage boy who looked like a young Tony Dow. He was quite the Big Man on Campus then.”, she says, laughing softly.

“Were you friends with him?”, I ask, leaning in to get the gossip of lifetimes past.

She blushes and shakes her head.

“Oh, heavens no! I was the new girl over at the High School. No one paid me any attention, but your Nana was sweet on him.”, she giggles.

“She was? I thought she met Grandad in high school?”, I ask her.

“Oh she did, they were just friends though. Didn’t start going steady until college. He was friends with that boy across the street too, I think his name was Thomas.”, she responds, squinting as if trying to remember.

“Did Thomas and Nana date?”, I ask her, begging for another glimmer of Nana to keep close to my heart. Something new I can have to feel like she’s still with me.

Abigail’s face becomes contemplative.

“Well.. No, not really. Your Nana thought they were.. I won’t disrespect her privacy by saying too much, but, Thomas was sure doing things with your Nana that only committed couples ought to be doing.”, she responds, choosing her words carefully.

“Oh.. I see. So guys have always been like that, huh?”, I ask, trying to huff a laugh but it comes out too dry.

Abigail pats my hand.

“Not all of them, only some of them act like that. Don’t you worry.”, she winks at me.

“I’ll keep that in mind, so did Thomas’s family move out?”, I ask her.

“Well they had to, after what happened.”, Nana says.

I try to meet her gaze but she avoids me.

“After what happened?”

“There was a vicious rumor that Thomas got a girl pregnant, her parents were set to make him marry the girl. But he disappeared, just vanished. The whole city looked for him for weeks, but no one saw him again. He obviously ran away so he wouldn’t have to deal with his consequences, and his parents were ashamed. They eventually moved away because they couldn’t take any more of the judgmental looks.”, she finished, picking up some meat on her fork and bringing it to her lips.

“Pretty scandalous for the 60s, it seems.”, I respond

She nods vigorously.

“Oh, yes. You have no idea. Your Nana was so heartbroken. The rumor was that she was the girl who was pregnant, but, she never confirmed it, even to me! I would tease her sometimes, tell her she only stayed in that house in the hopes that Thomas came back for her.”, she chuckled.

“You don’t think she loved Grandad?”, I ask quietly, I can feel my heart sinking.

Abigail shakes her head vigorously.

“Oh, not at all what I’m saying! She loved your Grandad somethin’ fierce. I just think sometimes we keep our first loves close to our heart.. Even long after we’ve moved on. Like you always have a soft spot for them, understand?”, Abigail explains, reaching for my hand with her same worried expression she always has for me.

I nod slowly. I understand what she meant, I still have a soft spot for my college boyfriend. Though I would not get back with him even if he begged me.

“I understand, thank you for clarifying.”, I say, squeezing her hand back.

Our hands retreat, and we resume our eating.

“Why the sudden interest in the house across the way?”, she asks me.

“The strangest thing, I thought I saw a light on in the upstairs window as I was getting home tonight.”, I explain.

“Really?”, she asks, “How strange, did you see someone?”

I shake my head.

“Nope, thought it could be a realtor though, maybe they’re finally putting the house on the market.”, I say hopefully, “Maybe a new friend? Someone who didn’t see me have a nervous breakdown on the front lawn recently?”

Abigail laughs and raises her glass to mine.

“Well then, let’s toast to new friends!”, she exclaims.

I raise my glass to match hers.

“To new friends, and first loves!”, I counter.

Abigail cackles her familiar laugh.

“To first loves.”, she sighs.

*

My therapist told me recently that going through Nana’s stuff and choosing what to keep/donate would help me. Something about feeling like the space is mine, and not like I’m just living in someone’s house.

I’ve been going through things slowly, room by room. Keeping things that I have a memory with, donating anything I think someone else would appreciate more.

I’ve enjoyed it a lot, it’s therapeutic in a way.

Ive gone through the guest room, the attic, and the kitchen so far. I’ve been procrastinating on the last room that isn’t mine.

Nana’s room.

I’ve hardly been in there since I found her that morning.

I take deep breath, and open the door.

It smells like her. Like rose water and mint. Her worn paperbacks are piled high on what used to be a vanity, and her silk scarves hang over every surface.

I did strip her bed, after they came to get her. They told me I could, but everything else looks the same.

I take a shaky breath.

“Okay.. Hey Nana, sorry it took so long for me to get in here.”, I say quietly into the room.

I keep waiting to hear her soft giggle in response, but it’s silent.

I sigh, and get to work.

Several hours later, I’ve sorted several boxes. Her books, scarves, clothes, shoes, and undergarments.

As I’m going through her vanity drawers, I’m mostly getting rid of trash. Crumpled tissues, broken hair clips, when I stumble upon a small book.

“Photo album?”, I ponder, flipping to the first page.

The first page reads:

“This journal belongs to Susie, 1961.”

I gasp.

“I didn’t know you journaled, Nana! You told me once you never needed your thoughts written down, they were safer in your head.”, I laugh at the memory.

My alarm shrills in the other room, signifying its time to take my anxiety medication, and it’s time to head to Abigail’s for dinner.

“Alright, I’ll look at you after dinner.”, I whisper to the journal, tossing it on my bed as I pass my room.

As I cross my front lawn to get to Abigail’s, I see a light flicker across the street again. 

I pause, and squint my eyes. There has to be someone up there, right?

The light is in the same room as before. Looks like the only room upstairs that faces the street. The light flickers back and forth, almost like a candle. I stare hard at the window, waiting for a friendly wave, the window to open, anything. 

But the light just flickers.

I can’t explain it, but it feels like it’s beckoning me. Inviting me towards it.

For a moment, the rest of the neighborhood fades away. I no longer hear the dogs barking, the footsteps of evening walks. 

The light is the only thing I see.

I have to know what it is.

I take a step forward, eyes locked on the house across the way, when a familiar voice cuts through my trance like cold water.

“Dearie! Is that you?”

I blink several times, regaining my consciousness.

“Dearie, are you alright?”, Abigail asks, close enough now to put her hand on my arm.

“Y-Yes. I’m sorry, I must have zoned out.”, I respond sheepishly. My eyes dart back to the house, but I see the light has disappeared.

“Damn..”, I mumble.

“Did something happen? Are you having another episode?”, Abigail asks, her voice quivering.

“What? No, no, I’m okay. I just.. I swear I just saw the light on again in that old house.”, I respond, gesturing across the way.

Abigail squints at the house, then shrugs.

“I don’t see any light, but it is cold out. Why don’t I make you some tea before supper, so you can warm up?”, she offers, looping her arm through mine to guide me to her house.

“Sure, yeah. Yeah that sounds good. What are we having?”, I ask absentmindedly.

As Abigail chatters about a new soup recipe she found, I feel this gnawing presence behind me. Something pulling at me. 

And right before Abigail’s front door clicks closed, I hear a faint whisper that sends chills up my spine.

“She was never who you thought she was.”

*

My morning routine feels different these days.

I still wake up on time, and do everything else accordingly, but I feel off. Ever since the night where a whisper stopped me in my tracks, I feel uneasy.

“She was never who you thought she was.”

I stare at my Nana’s journal, still closed, on my bedside table. If she wasn’t the warm, brave, selfless person who raised me.. Then who was she?

And what is the house across the way trying to tell me?

I’ve been going to work, but I feel extra wonky today. I put in for a personal day, and decide to relax with unhealthy snacks and bad tv.

I message my therapist to ask for an extra session, and he says he isn’t available today but he can see me tomorrow morning.

Which is great really, that means he can’t encourage me to just go on a walk outside instead of gorging and watching reality dating shows.

I spend my day doing just that. By my sixth episode, I realize I do actually feel physically bad. Maybe a walk around the block won’t kill me.

As I’m changing into an oversized hoodie in my bedroom, I spy Nana’s journal sitting on my beside table again. Without thinking too much about it, I grab it and slide it into my front pocket. Maybe it’ll bring me comfort, like when Nana and I used to take our walks together.

I head outside and turn right, passing by Abigail’s house. I’m about to stop and ask if she wants to join me, but it doesn’t look like she’s home. So I go on my way.

I take mine and Nana’s normal route. Passing the playground, the river, the hundreds of amber trees. At the halfway mark, I find a place to sit down and rest for a bit.

I watch the river, and I try to breathe in the crisp air.

“You would have loved today, Nana.”, I whisper.

Just then, a bright orange leaf falls softly, landing on my hand.

I chuckle and examine it between my fingers.

“I don’t care what anyone or anything says, I know you were exactly who I thought you were.”, I whisper again.

Another leaf falls, and lands softly on my stomach.

I smile to myself.

I feel her more right now than I have in almost two years.

I gently grab the two leaves, trying to figure out how to make sure I can get them back home safely.

“Oh!”, I chirp, reaching into my front hoodie pocket to grab the small journal.

“You’ll do just fine for transporting leaves..”, I say softly.

I flip open a page in the middle of the book, ready to gently place the leaves between the pages, but I see some familiar words that stop me.

“Thomas” , “Abigail” , “How do I keep this secret?” , “I’m scared.” , “The baby.”

I skim the words, not making too much sense of them beyond a couple phrases written in Nana’s hard to decipher handwriting.

I flip the page quickly, and there is just one sentence that fills the page, it looks different though. Like it was added much later, and in a hurry.

“That house will forever be haunted by this.”

That.. House.. Does she mean the house across the street? Is something haunting the light inside the house?

I stand up quickly, not sure at first where to move. I remember I’m still holding the leaves and I carefully place them in the pages, and then I close the journal tightly.

I have to know what’s in that house, I have to know what made my Nana write that.

I speed walk back to my street, earning confused looks from some of the neighbors, but what else is new?

The sky is getting dark as I reach my house. I pause on the sidewalk and turn to face the house across the way.

My blood starts to tingle, I feel the same isolating feeling again, and I know I can’t stop until I see what Nana was talking about.

I walk towards the dark house, my bravery wavering more and more by the second.

I glance to my left and right, and see no one else on the street. 

I try the front door.

It’s locked.

“Damnit.”, I mumble.

The house is the same model as mine, just reversed, so I know there is a back porch with lots of windows.

I sleuth behind the house to try my luck there.

As I am carefully walking, I can feel my heart pounding. The logical side of me is screaming to go home, but I can almost hear Nana urging me to keep going.

When I reach the back porch, I see that the door is also locked. I slowly start wiggling windows, and on the fourth one, I get lucky.

The window slides up slowly, and has just enough space for me to climb in.

I slip into the house, and land in what I know is the kitchen. I glance around for any signs that someone has been there, but it’s dark and dusty. It’s empty, and in relatively okay shape with all things considered.

Once I get my bearings, I start to creep through the house, heading for the stairs. I’ve only seen the light in that upstairs room that faces the street. I’ll start there.

I grab the rail to steady myself, and carefully walk up the old stairs.

The house is almost too dark, and though it’s empty physically it feels… Crowded. Like something is sucking the life out of the house, making it hard to breathe.

I take some steadying breaths and continue on, up the stairs until I reach the landing, then the bathroom, and then the room I was looking for.

The door is halfway open, and I gently push it all the way forward. It creaks loudly, almost painfully to my ears.

I use my phone flashlight to shine around the room, but I don’t find much. No furniture, except for a dresser sitting underneath the window.

I step closer to it, slowly, so I don’t step wrong on an old floorboard.

When I reach the dresser, I see a single unlit candle sits in the spot I’ve seen calling to me. I see no lighter, no matches. Nothing to light it.

“Hello?”, I call out, turning in a small circle in the large room.

Silence.

I scoff at myself.

“Well did you think someone would say hello back?”, I ask myself.

Then, it happens so fast, but a small breathy sound goes past my ears.

And the candle ignites.

I yelp, stepping back and wrapping my arms around myself.

I stare at the flame, watching it softly sway.

It doesn’t seem malicious, once the adrenaline starts to calm, I don’t feel frightened.

“Is someone here?”, I ask at a hushed tone.

The candle flickers softly.

I reach forward to the fire, just to make sure it’s real. When I get close, the flames dash out and lick my fingers, singeing them on the spot.

I gasp, and pull my hand back immediately.

“Are you… dead?”

The candle flickers again.

“Okay…”, I start, wiping my sweaty hands on my jeans.

The candle sways, like it’s waiting for me to keep talking to it.

“Are you… Evil?”, I ask.

The candle extinguishes, coaxing the room in black.

I gasp, ready to scream, when it slowly relights again.

“Okay, so flicker means ‘yes’ and dark means ‘no’, right? Flicker two times if that’s right.”, I ask the room.

The candle flickers twice.

“Alright.. We have a system.”, I sit on the dusty floor.

“Did you live in this house?”

The candle flickers.

“Did you die in this house?”

The candle flickers.

I gulp.

“Did you live here.. in 1961?”

The candle flickers.

“Did you own this house?”

The candle extinguishes, plunging me into darkness again for a few seconds.

Thomas comes to my mind, but, Abigail said he ran away. Maybe.. Maybe he didn’t?

“Are you Thomas?”

The candle seems to pause, and then it flickers.

I take a deep breath.

“Okay, Thomas. Did you really run away?”, I am starting to feel my voice get shaky.

The candle extinguishes.

“Did something happen to you? Something bad?”

The candle flickers.

Oh, oh no. Please, no.

I take a deep breath, and ask my next question.

“Were you killed?”

The candle flickers.

I can feel tears starting to run down my face.

“Were you the thing that whispered to me the other night? Saying that she was never who I thought she was?”, I ask, starting to cry harder.

The candle seems to pause again, and then it flickers softly.

I nod, wiping my eyes with my sleeves.

“Did my Nana kill yo-“

“Dearie?”

I spin around on the floor, facing the door to the bedroom where Abigail is standing. Her face full of worry, her chest heaving from the stairs I’m sure.

“Abigail!”, I exclaim, jumping up to meet her, “What are you doing here?”

“I saw you walk over here, I kept waiting for you to come back but you didn’t. I got worried. I tried to call you, dearie, you didn’t answer. I’m worried about you.”, she explains, placing her hand over my cheek.

“Oh, Abigail. I’m sorry to have worried you. I found Nana’s journal from when you guys were teenagers, she wrote something about this house so I came to inspect it. I feel like I was communicating with Thomas though, through that candle over there..”, I explain, gesturing to the still lit candle on the dresser.

Abigail regards me for a moment, then her eyes flick to the journal in my hand. An emotion I can’t detect quickly passes her face. She then looks at the candle with confusion. She steps closer to it, like she’s trying to examine it. She looks around it, and doesn’t find anything else there.

She sighs, then turns to me slowly.

“Dearie, I don’t think you are communicating with anyone through a candle, especially Thomas. He ran away, remember?”, she says calmly.

“No, I am! I really am! I ask questions and it flickers and responds to me! See, I can show you!”, I practically yell.

“No, we won’t be doing that.”, Abigail says coldly.

“But I can show you, I promise.”, I plead.

“No, dearie. I’ve been worried about you, for a long while now. You’ve been having your episodes, throwing out your Nana’s things, missing work…”, she elaborates.

“I haven’t been throwing out her things! I’ve been going through them, like my therapist said! And I missed today, just today, it’s not a big deal..”, I try to explain.

“Mhm, then why did your therapist say you asked for an extra emergency session today?”, she asks.

I’m frozen.

“I was just in a funk.. Wait, how did you know that?”, I ask her.

She shrugs.

“He’s an old friend, I knew he would give me updates on your progress. But dearie, him and I are agreed that you have gotten much worse. You aren’t showing any signs of improvement, and, we both feel it’s best if you spend some time with some medical professionals who are better suited for your situation..”, she says calmly, placing a cool hand on my arm. Like she’s done a hundred times before.

I jerk my arm away from her.

“What are you talking about? I’m not mentally unwell, I’m not going to a psych ward.”, I rebuff.

“You are, actually. I called the police when I saw you break in to this house. They should be here soon, so just give me your Nana’s journal and this can go much more smoothly for everyone.”, she says, holding out her hand to me.

“Her journal? Why do you want that?”, I ask.

She withdraws her hand, slowly.

“Because you can’t take any personal items in with you anyways, and I don’t want it to get lost.”, she explains.

I raise an eyebrow at her.

And I feel a familiar whisper on my neck.

“She was never who you thought she was.”

I stare at the floor, then slowly up at Abigail. My Nana’s best friend, the woman who helped raise me.

What if.. What if I misunderstood?

I turn to face the candle.

“Thomas, would my Nana’s journal be evidence to put your murderer away?”

The candle flickers.

I peer sideways at Abigail, who is watching the still candle in horror.

“Thomas, one more question…”

Abigail’s eyes widen.

“Dearie, you have to stop-“

“Is your killer in this room?”

The candle begins to flicker wildly, almost catching the dresser in flames.

Abigail gasps, and shakily leans into her cane.

“Nana wasn’t the pregnant girl, it was you. Wasn’t it Abigail?”, I ask her.

Abigail says nothing.

“You had me believe it was Nana, but it was you. Was Nana with Thomas at all?”, I demand.

“She was, not as much as I was. But.. She didn’t know, she didn’t know until..”, Abigail coughs, and leans back into the wall behind her.

“Susie was just so.. sweet. She got everyone’s attention, whether she wanted it or not. Including Thomas. They went on a few dates, sure. He was your Nana’s first kiss, but she wouldn’t let him go past that. Then I let Thomas know that.. I was available too. I just wanted to have something over Susie, just one thing. But things got out of hand with Thomas…”, she coughs again into her sleeve.

“I got pregnant, and dearie I was so excited. I knew my parents would make sure we were married, and that Susie would have to be a bridesmaid at my wedding to her precious Thomas. It was a cruel thought, I know, I was so young.. But when I told him.. He was upset, angry. Told me that he was too young to be a father, and that he already agreed to take Susie to prom, so we needed to get rid of the baby! Give the baby away, he said he didn’t even care! And dearie, I just got so mad, I couldn’t see straight. We were in this room.. This was his room. It was a beautiful spring evening, so his window was open. I didn’t think, I just shoved him out the window. Clean out. Once I realized what I had done, Thomas was laying on the grass below..”, Abigail looks up at me now, and I see tears staining her cheeks.

I’m speechless. My instinct is to reach out and comfort her, but I hold back. It doesn’t feel right.

“What happened after that?”, I ask slowly.

“Well I screamed, woke up his parents who came upstairs and saw what I had done. His mother cried, and I tried to explain everything to his dad. Who handed me a wad of cash and told me to ‘take care of it’ and to never speak a word about this to anyone. They pulled Thomas into the house, and I always assumed they buried him outside or put him in the river. I wasn’t sure why they didn’t phone the police, or if they wanted to avoid the scandal of it all. Once Thomas was reported ‘missing’, I told your Nana about the baby. I didn’t tell her everything, not about me pushing him, until just a few years ago. She was upset with me of course, didn’t speak to me for weeks…”

She chokes a sob out, and reaches into her wallet to take out a photo.

“She forgave me for being with Thomas, eventually, right before little Tommy was born. I had him in the hospital, my parents didn’t approve and they didn’t come to be with me. Your Nana did though, she came and held my hand as I gave birth to my beautiful boy. Then she held my hand as I gave him away for adoption. She never told a soul. I took a gap year after high school, started college the following fall, no one noticed my absence..”

She hands me the photo, of a happy faced little boy in a portrait photo. 

“His parents sent me that from his first birthday, I keep it with me always.”

I hear the police sirens before I see them, and I get closer to the window to look out at our street.

“I’m not going to a psych ward, Abigail. I’m not crazy.”, I say.

“I know you aren’t, now. I’m sorry, I was scared you weren’t well again, and I was afraid you were going to find out everything.. I was afraid you would look at me differently.. You’re like my own blood, I love you. I think about Thomas all the time, I wish more than anything I could go back to that time and undo so many things…”, she says, blowing her nose on her sleeve.

The candle remains on the dresser, billowing in the slight breeze. Abigail steps to the dresser, and places a shaky hand on the wood next to the candle.

“Thomas.. It’s Abby, I want you to know I’m sorry. It might not mean much, I know, but I named our boy after you. I hope you can forgive me someday too.”, Abigail says to the candle.

The candle is still, and then it flickers very softly.

I see police pulling up to the house, officers start to get out of the car and walk towards the front door.

“What are you going to tell the cops?”, I ask Abigail.

She sighs.

“For the first time in almost 65 years.. I think I’ll tell them the truth. All of it.”, she says calmly.

I nod.

“I think that’s a good idea, Nana would be proud of you.”, I tell her, helping her to the stairs.

Abigail smiles.

“She would be, and her opinion was always the one that mattered most to me.”, she tells me.

“Why hers?”, I ask.

“You know why, your Nana was my first friend. My first best friend. Really, my first love, and you always hold a soft spot for your first love.”
