I can't tell if I'm being an overprotective mom or if this is genuinely concerning. 

I have two kids, my daughter Stephanie and my son Daniel. Stephanie is your typical 16 year old girl, very into social media, loves hanging out with her friends, and things me and her dad are the lamest people on the planet. Despite this, we have a great relationship and she will come to us with problems. She's a bright kid (wish she tried a little harder in class, but still) and I know she will be okay in life. I've never seen Stephanie enter a room and not light it up. She is confident, a go getter, a bit lazy, lol, and just a great kid. So, needless to say, I've never had teachers call home about her. She always got on well with the other kids, and her teachers usually loved having her in class. 

All of that's to say that I'm a little out of my depth here. My younger son, Daniel, was a...well a surprise. He is turning 11 in a few months and is finishing out his 4th grade year. Daniel is a lot like his sister in some ways--he's friendly, kind, intelligent--but he's also unique. He's shy and doesn't like to talk much. He prefers the company of animals, like our chickens, over people, I think. He kind of gets really into things, which makes total sense to me since I myself have autism. I know special interests are normal and good. But Daniel doesn't just get really into things...he also gets really secretive. At once point his room started to stink and we couldn't figure out what was happening. It turned out he had gotten really interested in taxidermy and tried out some projects. He wasn't up to that skill level, though, and clearly it wasn't preserved right. Another time our neighbors asked why we'd moved here from France. I said we hadn't. They said, oh, that was weird, when our sons play together your son doesn't speak any English. The parents of the child spoke French and when my son was around them, he spoke it fluently. We never heard him speak a word of it at home or show an interest in learning it. It's sort of like he taps into something and is so absorbed, we only ever hear about it second hand. 

Anyway, that's not super relevant to the story, I guess. Basically, Daniel has had trouble at school this year. In the past he's had trouble related to shyness or specific situations--like he hated going in the music room if they were going to play the xylophones. Different teachers emailed me or called about how best to get him out of his shell, and I explained his personality, and they'd try their best. No one has ever really been successful in getting Daniel to really express himself openly that I know of. He has some friends, but they mostly talk about the games they're playing and he lets the other kids do most of the conversational work. So this year, when I got a call from Mr. Rose, I wasn't surprised. 

What was surprising was that Mr. Rose was calling me to tell me what an amazing kid I had and how happy he was that Daniel was having a great time in his class. He said Daniel was socializing with the other kids, enjoying activities, and talked all about his older sister, me, his dad, and our two cats. At first I was so excited! I thought, maybe, with age he had finally found some confidence in the amazing person he is! But then Mr. Rose called again, the second week of school. 

This time he said that although Daniel was still a great student, he'd appreciate it if we'd talk to him about the "situation with his backpack". I did try to talk to Daniel, but didn't really get anywhere. So I asked Mr. Rose what happened. 

He said that Daniel has been bringing raw meat to school in his backpack. Not once or twice, but every day. Large amounts--which is insane because I'm a vegetarian and won't cook meat. So we only eat it a few times a month when we go for takeout. I asked what he did with it, thinking maybe it just sat there in his backpack? But Mr. Rose admitted that for the past few days, every recess Daniel disappears somewhere on the playground. And when Mr. Rose finds him, he's hidden himself away in some slide or nook and is furiously gnawing at the raw meat. He said that the reason Daniel came home in his gym shirt last week was because it was covered in blood. Daniel said that he'd ripped the shirt so badly he'd thrown it away. 

I promised I'd take Daniel to a doctor to make sure he was okay, and talk to my husband. We tried to come up with a game plan, but honestly we were baffled at how he was getting raw meat and why the hell a kid would do this? So we took him to the pediatrician, who asked him point blank why he was doing it. And Daniel said, "I'm just so hungry." and he wouldn't explain any further. We're keeping a closer eye on him now, and he's on an iron supplement, but the doctor said it isn't normal and to take him to a psychiatrist or therapist. We're currently on the waitlist for one in our area. 

As if that weren't enough, Mr. Rose called again. I asked if this was about the raw meat, and he said no, that had stopped. This time he said that Daniel was following a particular student around, only a few steps behind her, sniffing her. I was so horrified. I apologized and went to talk to him. Daniel told me that he's not as hungry since "Mr. Rose has been helping" him "with the meat", but he can't help smelling the other kids because they're "fresh". I was so confused. I asked him if he wanted to hurt any of the other kids and he said no. He said he'd never do that. 

So, earlier this month, the kids were assigned a project that involved bringing a shoebox diorama to and from school every day. They workd on it in art class, then brought it home to work on, and back and forth. In typical fashion, Daniel didn't want anyone looking at his. And also in typical fashion, Stephanie wanted to get on his nerves so she snuck into his room and looked. Then she came into my room white as a sheet. What she said didn't even make sense, so I went into his room and looked for myself. 

The cardboard shoebox had been packed with Tupperware. Six containers in all, of various sizes. The first was filled with what appeared to be raw ground beef. The second was cubes of raw pork. The third was bone with marrow. The fourth was some kind of organ meat. The fifth was a slurry, sort of like cat food...and the final tub was full of eyes. To say I screamed the house down is an understatement. My husband wanted to call the police but I asked to talk to Daniel first. When we sat him down he rolled his eyes and sighed, and said that he knew we'd find out eventually. 

I asked him what the hell he was doing with meat and eyes in Tupperware containers. He talked, and for the first time I can remember, he did it with absolute certainty. it was like my shy, little boy had suddenly shed all of his awkwardness and was now directly communicating with the world outside his head. It unnerved me, the way he looked into my eyes without blinking often enough. I knew he was my baby, but part of me felt...repulsed. He said that he finally feels full if he eats these things and that Mr. Rose helps because Mr. Rose is like him. That Mr. Rose knows what its like to be so so hungry and not able to get the right foods, so he's been sharing with Daniel. My husband called the police, but they thought it was some kind of prank Daniel was pulling. And it didn't help that he claimed Mr. Rose had never given him any of those things as soon as the officers arrived. They promised to look into it, but they didn't take us seriously. 

So flash forward to this past week. I didn't know what to do with those hideous meats, so I threw them all out in our apartment complex's communal dumpster. I double bagged them just to be sure. The eyes were small enough that I assumed they came from some kind of small game that Mr. Rose hunted. Or that you could buy in a specialty deli. I decided to walk Daniel in and confront the principal myself. I even took photos of the Tupperware before I pitched them. I wanted Daniel, at the very least, to be moved into someone else's classroom. I'm not going to lie, I was ready to be a complete Karen. When I brought Daniel to the door, I held it for the little girl behind us, who was navigating with a cane. Then I realized I knew the little girl. It was Aubrey. She'd been in Daniel's class every year since second grade. 

I asked Aubrey's mom, Allie, if Aubrey was doing okay. Allie said, "what do you mean?" I gestured to Aubrey's new cane. Allie laughed like I was an idiot. "Jess, she's been blind since she was born. How could you forget?" Aubrey went pale and then Allie hurried her inside. But here's the thing...I know Allie could see fairly well at the start of the school year. Because I know that she got new glasses that brought out her blue eyes. I wanted to vomit as I looked back at the pictures I took. The eyes in the Tupperware matched the startling blue of Aubrey's at the beginning of the year. 

I went to the principal, who denied Aubrey ever being any different. She also said that Mr. Rose had complained about my lack of support for Daniel, and even when I showed her photos of the Tupperware she shrugged it off as something for science class. I felt like I was the only sane person in the building. 

Tonight, when I got home, the house smelled bizarre. Like...carrion. I went inside and found my husband and another man seated on the couch. I'm not sure how to describe Mr. Rose. He looked normal. So very normal. And yet, every now and then I'd catch a glimpse of him from the corner of my eye and see something else there. Something lumpy and cold blooded. Something bruised and ready to bite. I couldn't for the life of me get a good look at it, because every time I tried, there was Mr. Rose. Regular old Mr. Rose. My husband said they'd had a great time talking, and Mr. Rose headed out. He shook my hand and left the odor around the house on my palm. At dinner, my husband and son talked animatedly and Stephanie, usually an enthusiastic conversationalist was silent. She avoided my gaze. 

After dinner, she went upstairs without a word. I asked my husband if he was concerned about her not talking all night. He laughed...just like Allie. "Honey, what are you talking about? Stephanie was born without a tongue. She probably just forgot her iPad upstairs is all and didn't feel like grabbing it." My skin felt cold and my blood felt like it was boiling. I ran upstairs and opened Stephanie's door. She wasn't inside. I started looking in the closet, checking the window locks, and then I looked under the bed. My 16 year old daughter was curled up under the bed shivering, like she was two again and there was a thunderstorm. I begged her to come out but she wouldn't. I even tried to pull her out and she literally bit me to stay under there. She bit be and I could feel the absence in her mouth. The lack of what once was there. 

I'm in bed now, typing this. My husband is asleep, my son is asleep, and my daughter is still under her bed. I have no idea what to do and why no one is taking this seriously. All I can think of is the missing eyes, the missing tongue--the way all of the other parents and adults are enchanted somehow. All I can think is that my son has become something I don't understand and Mr. Rose is at the root of it. I finally broke down and posted because I needed to vent after what I found in my jacket pocket. A note. I guess Mr. Rose slipped it in there on his way out, because I don't recognize the handwriting. It's short, and sweet, and to the point. 

*Daniel and I are almost full. Almost.*
