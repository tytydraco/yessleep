Life in my house had started to become twisted a few months ago. The amount of strange and psychotic incidents I had dealt with seemed to grow by the day.

My six-year-old daughter, Brandi, used to be a heavy sleeper before all this started. She would fall asleep on the couch while watching TV, and I would often end up carrying her to her bed. But lately, she never slept. Every time I woke up in the master bedroom, I would catch a glimpse of a small face peeking around the door, silently disappearing into the shadows of the house, unrestrained glee on her small face.

My wife had the most severe personality changes of all. She wasn’t the woman I had married. All of her warmth, compassion and humanity had suddenly disappeared, leaving some monstrous shell behind. Like my daughter, she never seemed to sleep anymore. She would disappear into the dark forest behind the house at night, wandering in her nightgown, barefoot, like a pale ghost disappearing into the mist.

One night, I remember waking up from a nightmare. The bathroom light dimly illuminated the master bedroom where I slept. I turned to my wife, and found her already awake- staring at me with an insane expression, her eyes bulging out of their sockets, a wide, lunatic grin spread across her face. I sat straight up in bed, my heart palpitating with fear.

“Is something wrong?” I asked, but she continued to stare at me with that inhuman expression, her eyes gleaming. “Emma? Are you OK?” I felt something wet and sticky soaking into my T-shirt. I looked down on the bed, and saw a freshly dead possum laying between us, its head twisted around, its torso sliced down the middle. Intestines spilled out onto the sheets, staining them. The smell of blood and death hit me all at once, and I jumped out of bed without another word, grabbing new clothes and running to the bathroom.

I locked myself in, hyperventilating for a few moments. Then I managed to calm myself down. I checked the lock again, then I stripped naked and took a long shower, wiping the blood off my skin over and over. No matter how much soap I used, I still felt stained.

When I was done, I opened the door a tiny crack and peered through. The bedroom looked empty. I had no idea where my wife was, and I didn’t care. I quickly ran to the guest bedroom, locking the door behind me. And, for the last couple months, I’ve slept there every night- a can of police mace on the nightstand next to the bed, a brand-new deadbolt on the door.

The next morning, I met my friend Richie at a local diner. I had called out sick from work, and as I sat in the booth waiting for him to arrive, my hands shook uncontrollably. I spilled coffee on the table and on myself more than a few times. I hadn’t slept since the incident, and was only running on a couple hours.

I saw Richie arrive, striding through the front door. He wore a T-shirt to show off the tattoos on his arms. With his dirty-blonde hair and blue eyes, he had a very Irish cast to his face.

He sat down across from me, looking me up and down quickly and frowning slightly. He saw all of the spill marks on the table, the napkins I had used to do a half-assed job of cleaning it up, my trembling hands and sunken, tired eyes. I’m sure I was quite a sight.

“What’s up, Thorne?” he asked simply, not smiling. Like a lot of my friends, he always called me by my last name, rather than by Julius. I shook my head.

“I don’t know, man,” I said. “Some weird shit has been going on. Like, really weird. I’m scared, man. I really am.” He nodded.

“Yeah, I can tell,” he said. “You know I’m always here for you. Whatever you need, just call.”

“Thanks,” I said, trying to smile slightly.

“Now, why don’t you tell me what’s going on?” he said. “I’m all ears. Tell me everything, and maybe we can figure out something.”

At that moment, the waitress came, taking our orders and bringing Richie some coffee. Once she had gone, I told him everything that had happened. I didn’t leave out a single detail. By the time I was done, our breakfast had arrived and we were both on our third cups of coffee. I still felt drained, however. The caffeine seemed to make me feel more tired, if anything.

“Hmmm,” Richie said thoughtfully, eating a piece of bacon off his plate. He stared across the room, his eyes looking a thousand miles away, deep in thought. “That is weird.”

“I think it’s more than weird,” I said. “It’s fucking psychotic. I’m scared to go home. I’m scared to be in the same room with my own wife and daughter.”

“Yeah,” he said, nodding, chugging the rest of his burning hot coffee in one long swallow. “It is. Psychotic, I mean. What do you think is happening?” The question caught me by surprise. I choked on my coffee, coughing.

“Me?” I asked. “I have no goddamned idea what’s happening. All I know is my wife and daughter have turned into lunatics. If it was just one of them acting weird, maybe I’d think it was mental illness, schizophrenia or something…” He smiled slightly at that, but his eyes remained grave. I think the seriousness with which he took the situation freaked me out nearly as much as the situation itself.

“But it’s not one. It’s both,” he pointed out. “And yet, not you. You seem totally fine.”

“So what’s your point?” I asked.

“Well, if it was some sort of strange drug in the water, all three of you should be affected. You all eat and drink the same stuff, right?” I nodded. “And if it was mental illness, likely it would only be one of your family members affected. I mean, what are the chances that two people would develop a serious psychotic disorder at the exact same time? And schizophrenia is extremely rare in children anyways.”

“So what does that leave?” I asked. He shrugged.

“I don’t know, maybe body-snatchers, aliens, mad scientists cloning people in secret government experiments. Who the hell knows?” I laughed at that. Hearing it put into words made it sound totally insane.

“Aliens? Body-snatchers?” I said, scoffing. “That’s all science-fiction crap. This is real, man. It’s real and I don’t know what to do.”

“You should leave your house immediately. You can come stay with me for a few days,” Richie said. I shook my head.

“I can’t just leave my family behind,” I said, realizing how feeble the argument sounded. I had just said these people weren’t my family, after all. But Richie understood.

“You mean you can’t leave until you find out what might have happened?” he asked. My head slumped, all the tiredness and fear from the past weeks leaving me lethargic and bone-tired.

“I just can’t leave,” I said again, feeling like a prisoner.

\*\*\*

Things began to get stranger after that. Pets began to disappear. All across the neighborhood, I would see signs for missing dogs and cats. Normally, Emma would have become despondent over this. She was an animal-lover who often donated to charities for homeless or abandoned pets. She had an ASPCA sticker on her car. But, as I knew early on in my heart, it was not Emma I was living with anymore.

During the first days, I thought perhaps some toxin in the food or water had caused brain damage and personality changes in my family. Maybe it was an intentional release of some chemical weapons agent by the government or a terrorist organization. All of these thoughts passed through my head, but my intuition told me over and over that they were all dead-ends or red herrings. The truth was, these people were not my family. I knew it in my heart from the very beginning.

I could see it in the way their eyes gleamed during the night as they crept around the house, never sleeping, moving as silently as cats stalking their prey. I would hear floorboards creak outside the door as one or maybe both of them stood there for hours on end in the middle of the night, and my heart would begin beating fast. Dark bags began to form under my eyes as I slept less and less.

The only release I had was work, but every night, I would have to come back to these people who I didn’t know, but who looked identical to my family. I lost weight from the stress, and I began to smoke heavily. Normally, Emma hated it when I smoked, and she never allowed smoking in the house. Now, I chain-smoked inside and she didn’t even seem to notice. Her and Brandi barely talked anymore, even to each other. When they did speak, their sentences were short, clipped and often bizarre.

A month ago, I was sitting up in the guest bed, smoking and reading some Philip K Dick. I had “The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch” in my hands, which, ironically, was a story about a man who had been replaced by an advanced alien civilization. It struck too close to home, and I put the book down, just staring out the window, the dim lamp I kept on through the night giving the room a yellow glow. And then I saw her.

My wife was creeping out the basement door, barefoot, an insane smile plastered across her face. Her wide eyes looked around. She looked like a maniac who was trying to keep herself from descending into uncontrollable laughter.

“I wonder what they find so amusing,” I whispered to myself bitterly, feeling cold hatred and spite towards these two strange people who had taken over my house.

I saw her start towards the woods behind the house, taking a small dirt trail that ran towards a nature reserve a mile away. And at that moment, totally fed up and ready for this madness to end, I resolved to follow her. I got up out of bed, wincing as the springs groaned. I wondered if my daughter would be waiting outside the door with a bloody knife in her hands, ready to cut me open like my wife did to that poor possum.

I heard a floorboard creak directly outside my door, and a slight, barely audible sound followed it. It sounded like giggling, a little girl quietly laughing. I swore under my breath.

“Fuck it,” I whispered, going to the window and opening it. The wood shrieked loudly, and I winced, looking back over at the door. But I heard no response from the other side.

“You’re afraid of a little girl finding out you’re leaving? A grown man?” I asked myself, smiling at the absurdity of it. But when I remembered Brandi’s cold, insane eyes, the smile went away. Yes, indeed, I was afraid of that little girl. I had no idea what she was capable of.

I looked down. I was only on the second story, and below the window was soft earth and grass. I slowly climbed out, hanging myself down from the window and letting myself drop.

I felt myself falling for a few moments, and I wondered if I would regret this. Images of my leg bone breaking and poking out through the skin ran through my head, and then I hit the ground, rolling as I hit dirt. I landed hard on my back, knocking the wind out of my lungs. I lay there for a few seconds, breathing hard, then pushed myself up and began following my wife, wearing only slippers and boxers and a T-shirt. I wasn’t exactly dressed for reconnaissance work. Then again, neither was she.

I glanced at the house, and from my daughter’s window, I thought I saw a small face staring down at me- grinning like a jack-o-lantern, an expression of barely contained glee and bloodlust marring her childish face. But when I looked back up, the window was empty. I figured my mind must be playing tricks on me, and yet it shook me badly. I had never imagined I could be so afraid of a little girl as I was right then.

I tried to move as fast as I could without making noise, hoping I could catch up with my wife. The half-moon gave some bare light that streamed through the trees. I used it to avoid the rocks and tree roots that jutted up out of the earth.

After a few minutes, I heard an eerie sound coming from in front of me. Humming. I caught a glimpse of my wife, pale and white, her nightgown billowing around her thin frame. She stared straight ahead, her eyes not seeming to blink. She veered off the trail, and I followed from a safe distance, trying to keep myself hidden behind trees. It felt like dozens of eyes watched my every movement, but I brushed it off as paranoia.

She trampled through brush and pricker bushes, not seeming to notice the thorns and whipping branches. I tried to avoid the obstacles while still keeping her in view. We went uphill for a while, and to me, her choice of direction seemed totally random.

Then, she stopped. The humming cut off in mid-note, and she knelt down, sighing in pleasure.

She began to play with something white laying on the ground under a small pile of leaves and brush. She carefully brushed the remnants of disintegrating leaves and soil off the object. From behind the tree, I couldn’t see what it was.

She ran it through her fingers, stroking it lovingly, even kissing it. After what felt like an eternity, she put it back down, turning around to start back towards the house. She passed within twenty feet of me. I hid behind the largest tree in the immediate area, moving behind the trunk as she passed, praying no twigs would snap and give away my presence.

None did, and I watched her descend into the fog and the trees. As soon as I was sure she was gone, I crept forwards towards the spot I had seen Emma crouching.

A bone lay there, thin and long, still covered in small pieces of rotting flesh. In horror, I knelt down, examining it closer. It looked too large to be an animal bone, though perhaps it could have come from a deer.

Underneath, I saw the earth had recently been disturbed. It looked as if it had been dug up and filled back in. I went back to the house and grabbed a shovel from the shed, determined to solve this mystery. The dark house loomed over me, the windows looking down on me like pupils, hiding what laid behind them.

When I got back to the site of the bone, I started digging. The earth was soft and fresh, and it didn’t take long to get a large hole started. But I found nothing for the first half-hour. Covered in sweat and breathing heavily, I took a break, then returned to the task.

Once I had gotten down about five feet, I saw something besides dirt and small stones. At first, I couldn’t tell what it was, but it emanated a fluorescent, day-glo color. Then, with horror, I realized it was my daughter’s favorite T-shirt.

I kept pulling dirt off, and soon found two bodies in the pit. It was Emma and Brandi, their throats cut wide open, their staring eyes covered in dirt.

I turned and vomited on the forest floor, feeling I might collapse at any moment. Waves of hopelessness, confusion and anger consumed me in turn. Staggering, I ran out of the woods, going to a neighbor’s house and frantically knocking on the door. It was 3 AM, and it took a while to get a response. Finally, my neighbor, an old retired man, came to the door.

“Al, thank God,” I said. His tired, bloodshot eyes looked at me for a long time.

“Julius. It’s a bit late for a visit,” he said.

“This is an emergency. Can I use your phone for a minute? I need the police here immediately.” His eyes widened at that, and he looked wide-awake a moment later.

“Sure, sure, come on in,” he said. As soon as I had entered, he closed and locked the door behind me. He pointed towards the kitchen. “Phone’s in there, hanging on the wall next to the door.” I thanked him profusely, visions of my murdered family members running through my head. Then I dialed the police, my fingers shaking so badly that it took me a few tries. Finally, though, I heard it begin ringing, and at that moment, I wondered what exactly I would say.
