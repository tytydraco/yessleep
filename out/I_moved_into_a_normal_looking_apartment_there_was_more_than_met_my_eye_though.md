This happened around 3 months ago around July and I've been in shambles ever since my mom kicked me out of the house. Luckily I saved up to get a nice temporary apartment till I can afford a regular house. It was around 5am where I finally settled into the apartment and immediately I caught the stench of something putrid. I figured it was the cause of this apartment being dormant for years, Before I settled in, I did hear of the original owner suddenly vanishing or presumed dead. I didn't think of it too much and began unpacking for about 5 hours. I brought my laptop, phone, and other supplies to help me survive in this rotting apartment. Finally at 10am I drifted off to sleep for about 5 hours. I awoke at 3:15pm in a still tired state, of course I was hungry so I decided to go to the kitchen to fix myself a nice meal. But as I made my way to the kitchen however, I noticed a strange piece of paper sticking out of the painting that was there when I moved in. I was curious and grabbed the piece of paper and looked at it. It was weirdly Ripped in half, but it was enough to read the contents of the paper. I won't say everything that was in the first part of the paper, but I can give a full summary.

It talked about a progress report on something named 'Experiment 8199.' In the first part of the progress report, it said that this Experiment was capable of ripping one person in half with no problem. But the weird part about the first part of the progress report... It mentioned horse-like features, one mentioned in this report is the hooves. By all measures I was super confused, and before you question it... No, I didn't throw it away, I kept it just in case I found the 2nd part of the progress report. I then continued on with my morning routine with cooking breakfast and talking with my mom, who apologized for kicking me out. The reason she kicked me out is because there was an infestation of termites in the home. I wasn't surprised by this as the house I lived in with my mom was very old. Earlier that day I noticed something strange... While watching TV I noticed a little white mouse in the corner. But the scary part about it... It was covered in dried up blood! I immediately assumed the little creature was hurt, but when I got closer to the mouse before it dashed off, I noticed there were no wounds on it... Only the blood. I assumed it ate something dead and went on with my day. It was now 10pm and I was getting ready for bed, excited for the fact my friends were coming over to look at the place and chill. But as I slumped into bed, I noticed something strange. As I looked up into the ceiling, I could see an arm of a skeleton peeping out of the opening in said ceiling.

Sadly curiosity got the better of me and I grabbed the arm. Only for the whole skeleton to come collapsing on me... I almost screamed as I backed up away from the boney corpse. Thank my lucky stars my education made me examine the skeleton to be belonging to a young adult female. Her ribs were broken and dried blood covered the belly of the area. I got sick and put the skeleton back where it came from. Yes I know, pretty stupid of me... But then again I was tired, and I just needed sleep. So I passed out onto the bed. In the morning I got up earlier than yesterday around 1pm. I got up, took a shower. brushed my teeth, and ordered some McDonald's as I awaited for my friends to show up. While I was waiting out of my front porch tho. I spotted an old man next door to me, who was staring at me with a blank expression. I gave a friendly nod and a wave. "Hey man, how are you doing?" I said being a nice neighbor. The old man chuckled, then replied in a friendly tone. "Splendid, how about you?" I sighed softly and began to tell him about my experiences with the new apartment. Then he looked at me with a serious stare. "You wanna know something sonny?" He asked, maintaining eye contact with me. I stuttered softly as he was looking at me seriously. "If it's that important then sure." My heart dropped as I heard what this man had to tell me.

"There was a young woman that lived in the apartment you're in now, she was popular in these parts. I was a close friend of hers as she admitted I reminded her of her deceased grandpa. Warmed my heart, but it broke when I heard she was murdered in her apartment with mice eating her from the inside. But I heard strange noises during her death... it traumatizes me to this day... I heard the roaring neighs of a horse as I heard it murder what I would call my unofficial granddaughter..." That's where he finished the story... I was in disbelief, everything that happened in this apartment was lining up. I would've said I didn't believe him if I didn't find every ounce of evidence. "T-Thats... Oh god... That sounds horrible..." Before I can say anymore he handed me something. I looked down and to my surprise, he had the last piece of the document I found. I grabbed it from him and began to read, and let's just say my heart skipped beats when I read it. Like the last part, I won't share everything the document said. But the main point in the document was the location Experiment 8819 was in. In Shikyuma, I remember that place being shut down in Tokyo after I heard a cult ran that place. Everything was so damn clear. I thanked the old man before heading back inside, then getting a call from my mom. She said the infestation is taken care of and I can come home.

I wanted to tell her my discovery, but I just told her that I would be home tomorrow as I'm hanging out with my friends today. She understood and we said goodbye to each other. If I can't tell my mom about the discovery, I can for sure tell my friends. That's what I did when they showed up, when I began to prepare dinner for them. I told them what I discovered. Jake, the blonde friend of mine, sat up in shock and yelled. "Dude holy shit, and you didn't contact the police?!" I looked back at him with a stern look. "The Shikyuma cult was arrested and shut down around August of last year, so it's pointless to contact them about this. Well not until I get out of here so they can further clean the place." I said as I served them their requested dinner. Larry, the tough guy in my friend group, chuckled and said. "So what's gonna happen next? The ghost of Experiment whatever gonna haunt ya?" He teased as he mimicked a ghost. I chuckled and humored his story. "Oh yeah, that thing is realllyyy gonna haunt me tonight." I sarcastically said as I brought the group their drinks. Sarah, the cowardly but friendly horror fan said. "They should make a horror game about the cult, which would be super awesome." I laughed softly as that brought up my mood. Having my friends over for the whole day really made my day better, so I was sad when they left around 9pm. Sarah even gave me a hug before they headed home for the day. instantly I began packing half of my stuff until 11pm. I slumped into my bed, ready to get some shut eye. When I suddenly heard creaking coming from above.

I shrugged it off to be the upstairs neighbor walking around. But suddenly the most frightening experience happened right before my eyes. The ceiling crashed above me, luckily I dodged the debris that was about to crush me. I looked up to see what had caused the ceiling to collapse. And that's when I saw IT... Experiment 8199, the monstrous, bloodthirsty horse humanoid who could easily rip me in half with its hooves. I screamed in fear as I began to bolt for the front door. It tackled me before I could open the front door, grunting and neighing with primal rage. Then in a shocking and surprising twist, I heard it speak in a demonic, booming voice. "Shikyuma will be pleased with my work, I won't let this puny fuck ruin my plan!" He neighed again, ready to smash my face in. I suddenly grabbed the butcher knife that I accidentally dropped earlier and plunged it in its leg. It roared in pain as it fell back, breaking the kitchen counter as it held its arm. I took this chance to run out of the apartment, hop in my car and drive back home. When I got there I told my mom everything, to the document, to the murder, to that thing attacking me. I slept at her place that night.

The following morning the cops were there, I wasn't surprised given the fact there was so much loud noise with my fight against the monstrous Experiment. I hesitantly told the cops everything as I moved my things out of the apartment. To my surprise, one of the officers sighed and turned to his partner and said. "Tell the chief Shikyuma has migrated to the US." His partner nodded as he swiftly drove back to the police station, that one officer helped me pack my things and escort me to my house. As of writing this I am still living with my mom, everynight I catch her staring out of the window, assumingly fearing Experiment 8199 would arrive to finish me off. Luckily he never showed up, which is a good thing. I want this incident to be fresh out of my mind. So that wraps up my story. To everyone looking for an apartment; always remember to search for the origins of who lived there. You never know if you'll move into a victim of the Shikyuma Cult... Or Experiment 8199...
