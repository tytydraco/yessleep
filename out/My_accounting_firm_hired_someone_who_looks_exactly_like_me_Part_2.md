[After the events of the previous night,](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mqmhkb/my_accounting_firm_hired_someone_who_looks/) I should hope it goes without saying that no part of me wanted to go to work the next day.

In all honesty, I woke up after my measly three hours of sleep feeling like I wanted to break my lease and move to an entirely different city. I found myself wishing my mom still lived close enough for me to stay the night at her place, because if nothing else I knew she'd always be happy to have me spend the night with her.

I hadn't ever had anything like this happen to me before. Obviously. Even though I was a generally paranoid person, I used to think about scenarios like getting kidnapped or stalked as a hypothetical; I didn't really consider myself worth the time to kidnap or stalk, to be honest. That in mind, this situation was leagues beyond anything I'd ever thought to prepare myself for.

And yet, I was still just a little bit more afraid of leaving the life I'd made for myself here. It wasn't like I was living in some super nice apartment with my dream job, or anything. Hell, I honestly couldn't even say I was happy with the way my life was going—I had no talent or motivation to pursue my passions, was stuck working a job I could only sort of tolerate doing, and the only contact in my favorites list was my mom.

I debated calling her as I was getting ready for work in the morning, but decided against it. For some reason, sleeping through the night had made whatever sandbag was holding my tongue down about the Alex situation felt even heavier than it had when I'd gotten home yesterday.

I drove to work in silence. I don't think my eyes left the road once.

Alex was already there when I arrived, and he raised a hand in greeting when I walked through the door. Just making eye contact with him made me feel the same sort of empty cold I'd felt last night in the parking lot of my apartment complex, so I didn't respond, averting my eyes and sitting at my desk. I pulled my headphones over my ears before he could even begin to greet me properly, booting up my sad little computer and willing it to turn on as fast as it possibly could.

I was half-expecting another email to have made its way to me about transferring more of my clients to Alex, but there was nothing waiting for me in my inbox.

That probably sounds a little weird to those of you who are familiar with how accounting firms typically work, but it was pretty normal for me. I'm absolutely terrible at client outreach, so while bookkeepers are normally tasked with sending compiled financials and accounting packets to our clients, everyone has collectively learned that while I'm alright at the data entry and assembly, I can't seem to manage the part where I actually talk to clients.

Alex probably didn't have an issue with that. Alex had probably already reached out to the clients he'd taken from my workload with their monthly accounting information. It was what I would have wanted to do, after all.

I tried my best not to speak to or look at him over the day, but I kept my headphones switched to the setting that would let me hear everything around me and didn't play any music, so I heard Alex's conversations with the other people in the office.

About halfway through the day, one of the other bookkeepers in the office made himself home in our doorway and invited Alex to lunch with him and a couple of other coworkers. I glanced up briefly, but the other employee (whose name I genuinely didn't know, even though he'd worked there a while) didn't even glance at me, eyes trained on Alex. I looked back towards my computer as Alex accepted the invitation; I didn't want either of them to realize I could hear them.

Somehow, I thought Alex probably knew I was listening.

During the hour he was gone, I kept thinking back to the way I'd seen him standing motionless in front of his apartment door. Some part of me had tried to rationalize the behavior away, but I knew there was no reasonable explanation for why he'd been standing there like that for so long. If he'd forgotten his door code, he would have probably at least been trying to input numbers. And he hadn't looked at all lost when he'd eventually entered it.

I dwelled on that encounter for so long that I didn't get any work done while he was gone, and I definitely wasn't going to get any work done when he got back, so by that point I knew I was pretty screwed for the day.

He arrived back to the office side by side with the same coworker who'd invited him out in the first place. They stopped just outside the cracked-open doorway to have a conversation before both of them got back to work, and I knew I'd probably regret listening to it, but I listened anyway.

"It's been a while since we've brought on a new bookkeeper," said the coworker whose name I couldn't remember. "I'm glad you get along so well with everyone. We tried with, uh…"

Rather than saying any specific name, I heard him trail off into silence. But like I've said before, I'm not stupid. I knew he meant me.

"… But she's not very social."

"Really?" Alex asked. He sounded genuinely surprised to hear that, in the same way he'd sounded genuinely surprised that I lived in the apartment across from him. "She talked to me a lot."

I absolutely couldn't believe he was defending me in front of this coworker whose name I didn't even know. If I were a more bold person, I probably would have interjected into the conversation right then and there, saying something about how I'd have gone along with their lunches if they'd just asked me.

Of course, I wasn't that bold. And they had asked me, when I was new to the firm and the profession in general. But I'd been terrified of other people back then, and had made multiple excuses about being too busy to take lunch outside the office. Eventually, they'd stopped asking.

"Did she actually?" The other guy asked. "I mean, not that I think you're lying or anything, but I've worked with her for a couple years and I've never seen her speak to anyone."

Alex shifted just enough that I could see him through the window into the hallway. Then he glanced back, holding eye contact with me for a solid couple of seconds before returning to the conversation. Neither he nor our other coworker acknowledged the break in the flow of chatting to

"Some people are just like that," he said. "I used to be pretty quiet when I was younger. Maybe tomorrow we should invite—"

"—No!"

He probably hadn't meant to object that loudly. I pretended not to be upset at how quickly he'd objected to my coming.

"Look, I get that you're new, and you're trying to be nice, and all that, but… Okay. I know this sounds bad, but it's kind of a good thing she doesn't want to come," our coworker tried to explain."I mean, she refuses to work with anyone. She only got the job because her mom helped found the firm. I don't have a problem with it, but… Well, y'know. People talk. *At lunch.*"

"I guess. And, uh, thanks for lunch." I heard Alex sigh, a couple seconds before he pushed the door open. We glanced at each other again as he walked in, but he didn't try to hold my attention this time. Our other coworker went back in the direction of the cubicles.

I wanted to ask him then what the hell he was playing at. Between the way he acted at work, the incident from last night, and generally everything about him, I felt a little like I was losing my fucking mind. There's no more eloquent way to put what was going through my brain. I still thought he must be some kind of shapeshifter or demon or something, but that didn't explain why he was standing there defending me in front of his coworkers.

I didn't ask him. Shocker, I know.

I bit my tongue for the rest of the day, and left early again, like I had on Monday. I thought a little more about calling my mom on the drive home, but I didn't. I just walked into my apartment and cried for hours.

Everything my coworker had said about me was true, and even though I'd already known I was probably not held in the highest regard at the firm, it still hurt me to hear. I didn't even think about Alex all night.

Thursday was more of the same. I woke up, headed to work, sat at my desk, and said nothing to anybody all day. Alex went out to lunch with the rest of the bookkeepers, and I halfheartedly pecked numbers into the number pad of my keyboard, which was equally as shitty as the computer it fed input to.

It seems self-centered, looking back on it, but that day I was genuinely more concerned about the fact that I now knew what all my coworkers said about me behind my back than I was about Alex, or the disappearing sensation that came with him. Having heard what I heard on Wednesday, I'd actually been grateful for the feeling of being nothing. Having the rest of my coworkers ignore me in favor of Alex seemed preferable to hearing another offhand comment about how I didn't deserve to work here.

I left work early, got home, thought really hard about calling my mom before deciding not to, and went to sleep. Thursday bled its way into Friday, and Friday brought with it another email that I'd be losing a few more of my clients to Alex.

I was probably going to lose my job anyway, I realized. But I kept working like nothing had happened—like there wasn't some deep-set chill making its way into my bones, making me hyper-aware of the way that everyone who entered the office to talk to Alex seemed to avoid looking at my desk.

It didn't even feel like they were doing it on purpose. The way no-one even gave a glance to me made it feel like there just wasn't anything there worth looking at.

Even though I knew Alex would technically be there all weekend, living directly across from me, the weekend felt like more of a weight off my shoulders than usual. I knew I'd probably be spending most of my time doing nothing in particular and talking to absolutely no-one, but it felt a little comforting that the lack of eyes on me would be from the lack of eyes present, rather than from everyone collectively deciding to ignore me.

I knew it must have been Alex's doing. Saturday morning, I finally had it in me to look into supernatural creatures associated with shape-shifting, but a couple hours of scrolling various articles about folklore and internet horror stories provided me with zero exact matches to my situation. I tried not to think about the idea that Alex might have just been an ordinary person as I gave up my search and set about microwaving some lunch for myself.

I took a second to think about how much shittier my life had become in the past week while the microwave droned away in the background, but my contemplation was interrupted by a knock at the door.

I froze.

I had no way of knowing who was behind the door, but every synapse firing through my brain wanted me to think it was Alex. It *had* to be—my sister's friends definitely knew she worked weekends, and I didn't know anyone who'd just show up unannounced at my door like this. I suddenly felt more alone than I ever have in the apartment, even though I'd been alone many times before.

I didn't want to answer. I thought about not answering for long enough that the knock sounded again, slightly louder this time. The microwave beeped to signal that my dumplings were ready, and I completely ignored it.

"Sam?"

I heard my name through the door. If there was any mistaking it before, I knew now that it was definitely Alex on the other side.

I can't explain to you why I made the decisions I did, but I can at least try to bring you into my mindset at that time. I wouldn't call myself suicidal, but I'd had thoughts even before this point that sort of aligned with why I opened the door. There had been plenty of times I'd sat awake at night and wondered if anyone besides my mom would even miss me too terribly much if I was gone.

I was afraid of Alex. I was afraid of him doing something to me while we were alone. But there was something a little magnetizing about him in that way. He felt like a real answer to the question I'd often had about whether I was wasting my life away.

I was at the door before I knew it. I opened it before I could think twice.

Alex was holding a bottle of champagne and two flutes.

"Hey!" he greeted. "Sorry, were you busy?"

"Just making lunch," I said, still on edge. I didn't move to let him into my apartment, but he pushed past me anyway, like he knew I was planning on letting him in. I gave a pointed glance to the champagne. "It's one in the afternoon."

"It's a Saturday," Alex countered, "and I wanted to celebrate my first week on the job!"

I wanted to tell him that it had been the worst week of my life. I wanted to tell him that I hoped all of this was some figment of my usually-dormant imagination. I wanted to tell him to get out of my apartment because I knew what he was doing and I didn't know how to stop it.

"I don't drink," I said, unable to find the words.

"Just one," Alex insisted. I looked longingly behind me at the open door of my apartment and fantasized about bolting through it, and I felt like a marionette being walked around by a set of strings when all I did was step towards it and close it.

"Maybe," I compromised. "You can hang out and drink if you want. I guess."

There was a bitterness to my tone that I couldn't help. I felt like the most pathetic person alive, because on some level I was actually glad to have company, even if that company was some kind of soul-stealing monster who was bent on making my life hell, or something.

He popped open the champagne without much fanfare, taking a cursory look around my kitchen. His eyes lingered on one place, and mine followed his gaze to the knife set on my kitchen counter.

"My mom got them for me," I offered.

"Hm?" he asked, as though he hadn't been staring at the knives at all.

"The knives," I said. "They were a gift."

"I figured."

I opened my mouth to tell him that around a year ago I'd mentioned to my mom I wanted to try cooking more often, and she'd immediately bought me a new set of knives to replace the cheap ones I'd taken with me from the house when I first moved out. I didn't get around to saying the words, because I realized then how little I actually wanted to tell Alex about myself.

Like I said. Pathetic.

"Why are you here?" I asked, quieter than I'd been just a moment ago.

"I told you why," he answered. "Celebrating."

I didn't think he was talking about the job. The way he looked at me as he said that was innocuous enough, but I couldn't help but feel like he was gloating, somehow. Like he'd shown up just to rub it in my face that he was doing everything right, and my entire life was a trainwreck.

He poured two flutes of champagne, and raised one as if to toast. I didn't answer him. I didn't even touch the glass he'd set on my side of the counter.

"I'm serious," I said.

"So am I."

When he said that, I figured out what scared me the most about the way he'd been interacting with me.

I was familiar with every inch of my own face. I'd stared at it for a long time, picking apart every little detail that I didn't like about my expressions, or my bad skin, or any other little minute detail. I knew exactly what it looked like when I was smiling for real.

Alex was smiling for real. There wasn't an ounce of malice in the way he looked at me, eyes crinkled up at the corners, teeth on proud display.

I felt certain that he was genuinely happy. That there wasn't any part of him that felt malice towards me. I was talking to someone who I knew had *some* ill design on me—whose very presence in my life felt like a bad omen and a warning to keep my head down and run away—and he didn't even seem the least bit mocking.

I reached forward and grabbed my flute of champagne, then downed it in one go. It tasted like shit, and I coughed something fierce after it went down, but I'd never liked to drink, and I'd never had the sense for what made a good drink different from a bad one.

"Who *are* you?" I asked.

This time there was no immediate reply. I stared, intently, waiting for an answer, but it took an uncomfortably long time to come. I didn't break the silence; I wanted to know if he'd actually tell me, or if he'd just act like I was asking him an obvious question.

"I'm me," he eventually said. He winked at me, like we were both in on some big secret.

I felt like crying.

"Alex," I started, continuing to stare at him. "Why are we celebrating?"

This time, he didn't offer me any platitudes. He grabbed the bottle of champagne and poured me another flute, which I genuinely resolved not to touch—I didn't think getting any drunker around him would be a good idea.

"How is your art going?" he asked. I didn't answer him right away. I didn't remember ever telling him I did art, though he'd told me about his on Tuesday. "Or your writing. I'm not sure which one you prefer."

I cursed my poor sense of self-control that made me want to double-back on my word and take another drink, though I ultimately stood firm in the face of his questioning. He didn't seem to care that I hadn't answered him—he carried on leisurely and casually, chatting with me like we were best friends, and he had every reason to know the things he was asking about.

"Talk to your mom lately? What about your sister?" He laughed, shaking his head. "I'd ask about work, but I kind of know how that's going already."

I was still searching for any sign of malice in his words, but I genuinely couldn't find any. It was like he knew exactly what he was doing to me, but that there was some sort of disconnect between that fact and his brain that caused him to treat me like we were friends.

Or maybe he just knew there wasn't even a point in being rude to me, or ignoring me. It was bad enough that everyone else was.

"I'm celebrating all that," he explained.

"Why?" I asked. I'd wanted to ask something like 'what the fuck is your problem?', but I was still a very meek person at heart who wouldn't have cursed at someone even if they'd genuinely stabbed me.

"…I thought you'd like to see it." I recognized the bashfulness in his voice as my own—it was the way I got whenever I had to sit down and have an emotional conversation with someone. That hadn't happened much, lately. "I felt bad for you."

I didn't know what to say to that. He kept talking, anyway.

"I figured you *deserved* to see this," he explained. "I wanted you to know—things could have been better."

I hated the way he sounded sympathetic, like he thought he was offering me some kind of consolation. I hated it even more that I sort of understood what he was saying.

I was already well aware Alex was like the version of me I wished I was. I knew that was where the feeling of *disappearing* came from—the way he outshined me in nearly every department, just by being a little bolder and a little smarter and a little more creative. I knew that was why everyone looked in his direction and not mine; there was really no point in looking at me when he was there.

My coworkers liked him. *I* liked him. That was the most horrifying part about what he was saying to me. My fear, my anger, and my frustration all came from the fact that I genuinely did wish I could be more like him. I felt like I understood where he was coming from, even as the reality of his words sank into my skin and made me feel cold again.

"You have a *good life,*" he told me. "A great life. You've been so, so lucky."

"Please leave," I said. The pit in my stomach had filled itself with a sense of mounting dread. In that moment, it was the worst thing anyone had ever said to me.

"I'm sorry," he answered. And he did seem sorry. "I think I'm imposing."

He was. I grabbed the champagne flute, sitting somewhere between the idea of drinking it and the idea of chucking it at him. Ultimately, I did neither; he plucked it out of my hand with a sheepish smile.

"I'd better get going," Alex said. "I actually shouldn't be day-drinking. I've got plans."

I didn't want to ask what his plans were, or if he even actually had plans. I figured he probably wasn't lying, since that was the answer I didn't want to hear. In some small mercy, he didn't elaborate on what he was supposedly going to be busy with.

I watched as he rounded the kitchen counter, making his way towards the front door with both flutes in one hand—mine, that he'd refilled, and his own that he must have emptied over the course of our conversation. He paused in front of the door, and I'd thought he was just puzzling over how he was going to open it without spilling any champagne, but then he started speaking again.

"I wanted to thank you," he said, still facing the door. "It means a lot to me to be living like this. You've got good neighbors. I know you don't think so, but your coworkers aren't bad either. I meant it when I said it's a good life to have."

I felt frozen in place. I couldn't even move my mouth to try and form words.

I was smart enough to know that he was taking something from me in ways I couldn't even imagine them being taken. He was making something out of the should-have-beens that made up my life. I was still standing there—I *knew* I was still standing there, I knew my feet were still on the floor—but I felt, for a brief instant, like I was a gaping hole where a person should be. Like if I walked over to the mirror in my bathroom, I'd see nothing reflected back.

I felt like I wasn't moving because I was nothing. I wasn't replying because I was nothing. 'Nothing' was the absence of movement, and sound, and potential. I had been nothing since before Alex showed up in my life, but I was only realizing it now because Alex was *something*. Alex had written, and drawn, and talked to his coworkers, and he was constantly moving and breathing.

Then I heard my lock click, and I snapped back into the focus of reality. Alex was gone from my apartment. Lacking his presence, I almost felt like I could be a person again.

Almost.

As I turned back around to face my empty kitchen and my whiteboard hung on the opposite wall with no plans of my own written in, I wondered if it would be so bad to let him live my life for me. And that was my Saturday. In the evening I thought about calling my mom again, but I didn't think I'd be able to tell her anything.

I didn't think I wanted to. I thought, in the back of my mind, that she'd probably prefer to hear about work from Alex.
