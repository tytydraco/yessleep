Once again, there are scratching noises coming from the attic, even though I was just up there and confirmed that nothing is in fact there, at least nothing big enough to be making scratching noises like that. I'm in my grandfather's old room. I say old because he died a week ago, and I'm typing this post for all of you now. I know most of the posts on here, with good reason, are requesting advice, help, or just putting out a dire warning, but honestly, I just want to tell someone about all of this. It's freaky and traumatizing, but undeniably interesting.

My grandpa and I were close. Not as close as we should have been perhaps, but in this time where the regular church/family structure is slowly fading away, no opinion on that, it's definitely impressive that a teenager would voluntarily go visit his grandparents at least once a week in highschool and then as often as he could in college, substituting with check up calls. He had a big effect on my life, and I miss him dearly. Now I just wish I'd asked a lot more questions.

After days of funerals, lawyers, and all the like, my dad and I agreed that I could live at the old house if I started to work towards paying off some old debts. I'm not going to go into specifics, but it was the deal of a lifetime, really. I was going to own land and a paid-off home if I stayed current for the next few years.

Apparently, Dad has as much info as I did; he just assumed it was an old house with regular belongings and that my grandpa had leftover mortgage payments or something like that.

"Alright Wyatt, just sign here and I'll mail it. I'm not sure when his representative will come, but it shouldn't be too long."

That's not my real name, and from here on out, just assume any name you read is fake, because it is. I've got enough trouble to deal with now, and I don't need to add stalking to that list.

"Why isn't it just his lawyer? He handled all the other estate stuff."

"I don't know, I guess Dad wanted a separate guy for his business accounts or something. I'll call you later."

With that, Dad left and dropped the form off in the mailbox. I forgot to mention that Grandpa owned an antique/pawn/swap meet store. It bought, sold, and exchanged all kinds of items, and it was really interesting to take a walk through. For now, my uncle is keeping an eye on it, but it's not open yet. 

I watched Dad walk down the fading brick walkway, stoop down, place the envelope in the box, and flick the flag up. He got in his car and drove off, but as I was still looking out the window, I saw the flag suddenly flick back down.

It was cloudy, sure, but all of a sudden the clouds became much thicker and greyer. The wind began to howl, and the lights in the house flickered. Down the road, where I had just seen Dad's tail lights disappear, I saw headlights.

It was clearly a very nice car. Matte black, tinted windows, and it just sounded expensive, but I don't even think it had a brand. Must have been custom or something, but I was sure I'd never seen anything like it, and I hope I never do again. It rolled down the street and came up the driveway. The left back seat flung open. 

Out stepped a tall, pale man in a very nice, but very loose, charcoal grey suit. His hairline was thinning, but still his hair was slicked back, and there was no facial hair on his gaunt face or under his bony nose. Everything about him was alien: the way he walked, the way his arms swayed, his unmoving neck, and his eyes. His cold, powerful eyes looked like they could see through a brick wall, and as they were hiding such a vast repository of knowledge, yet they still looked tired. 

I opened the door, as unnerving as he was, I didn't think he was dangerous, and he carried himself like someone who belonged there to do business. As he got closer, I barely saw the chain of a necklace almost concealed beneath his collar, and I finally took note of the classy leather briefcase he was holding. 

"Hello, Samuel, long time no see."

He pronounced it SAM-WELL.

"That was my grandfather, and that wasn't how his name was pronounced."

"Hmm?"

He set the case down on the porch table and opened it for a moment to pull a paper out. Looking at it, I realized it was the paper I just signed, and that surely must still be in the mailbox. 

"Oh!"

His voice was a mock surprise, but I could tell he enjoyed what he had just read. He reached his arm out to me. 

"Hello Wyatt, sorry for the confusion, my name is John, but you can call me Mr. Cavae."

Those were the real names he told me, but something tells me they were fake to begin with. I shook his hand, which had a surprisingly firm grip for such cold, bony fingers.

"It's no problem."

"May I come in?"

"Yeah sure, I assume you knew Grandpa?"

"Yes, I was a representative for him."

"Representative for what?"

He ignored me and sat down at the table. After he entered, the lights flickered once more, and I was sure I heard a short, earthy hum, similar to what might emanate out of a crystal, from somewhere.

"Okay, do you have a driver's license or some other form of identification?"

"What?"

"I need to verify you."

"For what?"

Then he even looked confused for a second.

"Oh. Sorry, sir, I didn't realize Samuel hadn't told you so much."

I sat down and he went over the paper I had just signed stating I wished to take over my grandfather's role as curator of the house, which seemed an odd name because it wasn't a museum or something like that, and then Mr Cavae went over a very long contract. 

Many details aren't important, and really were just bland legal jargon, but the main gist of it all was that Mr. Cavae and his associates were grandpa's main "creditors." He explained that he had fallen behind on some of his work, but he was still an important and valuable client, so they allowed him some grace. If I proved myself in clearing his debts, then the claim they had to the house and its assets would be resolved, and I could possibly see some of the same benefits that my grandfather had, though he didn't explain further with the indication that this would be some time away. After that, he went back to business, checking my driver's license, confirming the last four digits of my social, and going over a credit report on me. Despite all of this information being in his briefcase, it was clear he hadn't even glanced at it yet. He signed off on a lot of things and wrote down some notes here and there, but finally, he only asked me for one signature. I held my hand out for his pen. He smiled grimly.

"Oh no, sir, we're very traditional."

He reached up to the top of his briefcase, and I heard the loosening of a buckle. He presented an ornate and beautiful fountain pen. It had a thick granite cap, and the rest of it was made from silver, and centered on the handle was a dark black jewel. I thought it might have been an onyx stone or obsidian or something, but I wasn't sure, and I'm certainly not sure now.

I should have looked over everything again, and I should have asked more questions, especially about what the debts even were, but I wanted that house, and I still do. If I had to go back now, I think I still would have signed it, but yeah, I would have asked a lot more questions.

He took off the cap and circled where I was to sign. I didn't argue, and I think I was a bit starstruck by the pen itself, and I signed. I remember carefully gliding the pen along the line, being satisfied that my signature actually looked official, and lifting my hand up to realize the jewel on the pen had become red. I felt faint. 

Mr. Cavae stood up and shook my limp hand. He placed a worn envelope on the table and made his exit. 

"Well, Wyatt, I'm very pleased to have met you, and I look forward to doing business with you for the foreseeable future. Good luck."

After he left, I got up to get a drink of water and eat something to get my head right. I made my way out to the mailbox, still recovering just a bit, and down the road I saw his headlights one last time. I looked in and there was nothing there. I'm not really surprised after everything else that happened, but still, it was hard to wrap my head around the form "teleporting" into his briefcase.

I opened up the envelope he had left, it smelled like onions, and inside was a receipt book. I tried to open it, but I could only get to the first page. It had a sticky note that said "check the attic." I pulled it off, and below was a log where my grandfather had rented a VHS tape from a local video store. I know, a bit of a lackluster turn from everything else that'd just happened, but yeah, it was a VHS rental that was 12 years past due. Again, I tried to go to another page, but I physically could not separate the pages. It's hard to explain, but there were definitely other pages; it wasn't just a piece of cardboard with one page attached to it or something like that. I felt the ridges of the pages and even *some* leeway, but I felt immense pushback when I tried to separate them. I tried one more time, with some more force, and the pages separated just a hair, but it began to let out this horrible electronic wailing sound, and I dropped it in surprise. I didn't try again after that. 

I made my way upstairs and rummaged around in closets for 20 minutes until I found the attic key (a really long Allen wrench), and then I had to recover myself again after the attic latch released moldy dust onto me and my open eyes.

Above, I was immediately taken aback by how large the attic was. Do you know that scene in Harry Potter where they're in the Room of Requirements or whatever and there's all that mystical junk lying around? It was a lot like that, except on a smaller scale, and a lot of it was stuffed into cardboard boxes. 

I saw tribal relics, old technology, stuffed animals, and lots of old clothes. I mean, like a metric ton of old clothes, Grandpa had no reason to hold onto them. Grandma had passed years ago, but they weren't even women's clothes. I admit this is not important, but still, there is a ridiculous number of clothes up there.

Anyways, near the entrance was a machine that resembled an ATM. I walked up to it, blew off the dust, coughed for a few minutes, and powered it on. It flashed my grandpa's name for a second, but then it must've updated suddenly, and it read my name out. All it gave me was a simple welcome before it requested the receipt book to be validated. A slot at my waist level suddenly clicked open, and I slowly inserted the book inside. After some digital humming, I heard a hard CHUNK, and it spat the book back out at me as it printed a small receipt. Ripping it off, I read it to see that it was directions for getting through the mess behind me to the right box. Box number 268. It had a line for directions underneath this information, and it said I needed to retrieve the tape and return for further instructions.

I was quickly aware that I wasn't alone up there. I heard quick, but heavy shuffling. Something would be knocked over, but when I turned to look at the disturbance, there was nothing there to have caused it. And, in general, I felt the uncomfortable feeling of being watched. Of course, at the time, I only had reason to believe the worst-case scenario was a rabid raccoon I would have to wrestle with, and so I trudged on following the specific directions laid out for me. Right at the multicolor rack of clothes, continue forward at the divers helmet, when you hear an analog version of Beethoven's 5th up ahead, turn left immediately and don't say a word (this part was in bold), and finally throw the faux bear skin rug off and there's the box. 268 was spelled out in Sharpie. It was a box of VHS tapes. 

I hadn't heard any noises in quite a while, so I made myself comfortable and started sifting through and stacking the tapes in front of me. It was nice, rummaging through old memories and absorbing little pockets of nostalgia here and there. I found a VHS copy of Rom and Kerry, season two of Little Maestro, and even a tape of Galactic Assault. Some young favorites of mine. I also found some porno tapes. I opted to throw those into a nearby box of old socks, except for one titled Spicy 17th Anniversary, which was home filmed. I scratched out the name and snapped that one, partly a favor to grandpa, and to myself. I tossed the remains and kept sorting. I actually found some other cool VHS tapes I didn't even know he had. There was a copy of The Matter, a cult classic horror movie, a director's cut of Baron of the Deep, a popular Atlantis fantasy movie, and even a tape that said it had news recordings of the Watergate scandal and of Nixon leaving office. There was also another porn tape I threw away.

However, at the very bottom of the box, there was a final tape that had a rental receipt rubber-banded to it. I picked it up, but there was no name on it. Upon further inspection, I saw that the plastic casing of the VHS had many small intricate carvings all over it. I thought it seemed really cool, and at the time, I assumed it must have been a limited edition version of some cult or voodoo magic-themed horror movie. It sends a shiver down my spine, and I am forced to shake myself when I recall that I planned to watch the tape before I returned, but since I wasn't about to root around that attic for a VHS player, I decided to just head straight to the store. 

The directions on the receipt said to simply reverse the earlier directions and trail my way back to the entrance. Once again, I followed them to a tee, this time carrying the box with me, but when I heard the analog track of Beethoven's 5th, it stopped for a moment, and I heard a robotic voice call out to me:

"***Hello?****"*

I rushed away after hearing that, and the music returned, but it was sped up and much louder. I just barely heard it echoing when I reached the entrance and rushed back down the stairs. I shut the latch, but as soon as I did, I heard scratching noises coming from it.

I knew where the rental store was. I guess we once had a few in town; we may even have had a Blockbuster at some point, but they had slowly died off, and now there was just one left. An old high school friend of mine works there now as the cashier. He sells weed out of it, but the owner doesn't mind because, as Gregg tells me, the owner's just laundering money with it for a local crime ring. And so, the store stays open despite, you know, being far past the worldwide adoption of DVDs and Gregg selling his wares in full view of the security camera. The only customers to come into the store are a group of hoodie-clad young men "returning a rental" and Mr. Rimmer, who keeps renting the same copy of Love on the Tides every single week. Gregg tried to just sell him the copy a few times, but he quickly understood that Mr. Rimmer was just lonely and enjoyed Gregg's stoned company.

I parked in the cracking thrall of faded asphalt. The Tallmart next door was busy, and upon entering the store, I saw that Gregg had made himself a lunch of Tallmart brand deli items. I'll be honest, I've done it too. Pretty cheap lunch for some good food, maybe give it a shot. Anyways, I laid the VHS on the counter, and even Gregg was quickly confused by it, and then annoyed.

"Bro, why are you bringing me this shit? It's *twelve years* past due."

"Look, it was first up on working through Grandpa's stuff."

"Dude, I think management has changed twice since this was rented. Just keep it."

I guess the owner saw that someone other than Mr. Rimmer was actually bringing a VHS in and, out of curiosity, came down to see what was up. 

"Gregg, something wrong?"

"Wyatt's grandpa died, and he's trying to return a VHS for him."

The owner smelled like sweat and cigarettes. Apparently, you don't get used to it because I saw Gregg turn his nose up a bit as well. 

"You brought in a twelve-year past-due tape?"

"Is there a fee or something?"

He just gave me a deadpan, disappointed look. I guess it was a bit dumb, but seeing it on the receipt book, I just assumed it was supposed to finally be returned, after all, a rental would definitely be considered a debt. The owner turned it over a couple more times, scrutinizing it.

"What movie even is this?"

"I don't know. I assumed, based on the symbols, that it was some kind of culty horror movie."

"Yeah, maybe. Let's go look." 

Gregg turned the front sign to closed and we made our way into the backroom. There, Gregg pulled the record book, and we tried sifting through it to find this tape. We found it, with its line all blacked out.

"Huh."

Apparently, this was new to the owner as well.

"Alright, well let's just play it to see what's on it. Gregg, you think you could take the trash out while I get the VHS player hooked up, also, you."

He passively flicked his hand at me.

"Could you get the receipt? We left it on the counter, and I want to look at it again."

We both got up from the decrepit and lumpy couch and did as we were requested. I followed Gregg out back and was thoroughly surprised that his lone pot head frame could swing the heavy bag of trash back and forth and then land it perfectly into the next door Chinese buffet's dumpster, with a sign that said "RESTAURANT TRASH ONLY." We walked back inside and stood at the counter, talking about the house and about Gregg's side hustle, but we soon heard something from the backroom. It sounded like screaming.

We ran back behind the counter and threw open the door. Entering the backroom, to the immediate left is a wall, and the rest of the room is to the right. The television was facing the back of the room, and it was one of the large cube-shaped ones, so we couldn't see what was on the screen. What I thought were the owner's screams were actually emanating from the TV. There must've been thousands of voices wailing, laughing, crying, and chanting dark, indecipherable messages. Wind was rushing around the room, being sucked like a vacuum into the screen and against the back wall there were odd shadows being cast by bright sickly light. It was as though the screen itself were gone, and a portal had opened up, with figures collecting just beyond the veil. The owner was standing there, clothes flapping and arms lying limp at his sides. His mouth was agape, and his eyes were struck open.

*"It's so beautiful. Oh God."*

Suddenly he began howling, and before us his skin began to melt off his body, and was sucked through. Quickly, his whole body, blood, organs, bones, and all separated themselves from him, and he was gone. All that was left was the food in his bowels, it looked like McDonald's, and an artificial hip. A sound, like lightning being torn in half, screamed across us, and the light closed off as the portal closed. The player spit the tape out. 

There was such an awful silence after that. Gregg and I just stared at the spot, obviously in shock. I mean, how else were we supposed to react? Finally, I began to move back into the room, and Gregg inched forward with me. I rounded the corner and found that neither the TV nor the VHS player showed any signs of being involved in the inexplicable horror that had just unfolded. I turned over and found the tape lying sideways behind the coffee table. I hovered my hand over it for a second, and I even dropped an old fry from the floor on it first. No effect, after I lightly tapped it with the back of my arm, I picked it up. Gregg and I stared down at it. The symbols on the sides had turned bright red.

"What do we do?"

Hearing another person's voice after all that and all the silence shook me for a moment. I thought for a second, but the thoughts just wouldn't form. What could the police do? What could anyone do? It certainly didn't seem like he was going to be in any savable state. Even before his body had disintegrated, that tape had affected his mind. The only thing that could have possibly been done for him was to watch the tape ourselves and try to figure it out, or I guess to go in after him. And we sure as hell weren't doing that. I didn't even know the guy and Gregg had always said he was kind of a dick.

Gregg walked over, picked up the replacement hip, and turned back to me. 

"Listen, I'm gonna throw this away, and then I'm gonna clear the security footage. If anyone asks, let's just say he skipped town."

I didn't really have any other ideas, so I nodded. After I finally got my legs moving again, I quickly walked out the door and sped all the way back to the house. As I sat in the kitchen, eyes wide open, trying to ignore the sound of distant scratching, I went over everything in my head over again. I felt like a character in a horror game who finally realizes they are in a supernatural, deadly situation, and that things are far beyond their knowledge and control. I realized I hadn't locked my car door, and I stuffed my hand into my pocket to retrieve my keys, but as I did so, my hand ran over crumpled paper. I pulled the slip out with my keys, pressed the button to lock my door, and then looked over it. It was the receipt that the machine in the attic had returned to me. A worried feeling suddenly washed over me when I reread the line:

"Retrieve the unmarked tape, and return for further instructions."

I got up and made my way upstairs. It took a while to get myself to do it, but after I smacked the door with the latch key a couple of times and the scratching stopped, I opened it up and slowly climbed upstairs. Poking my head through, I really felt like I was in a horror game.

There wasn't anything waiting to rip me in half on the other side, thankfully, but I still didn't feel good up there. The 5th was still playing in the distance. I walked back over to the machine, which somehow had another layer of dust. I blew it off, and as I stood there coughing once more, I made a note to start donning a face mask and arming myself with a can of keyboard cleaner.

My heart sank as I pressed a button to bring the machine back to life. It said, clearly, "DO NOT PLAY THE TAPE. Deposit tape here and then store it." 

I did as I was instructed, and the machine began to whirr for a while. As I waited, I noticed that the attic layout had clearly changed. I don't mean something got knocked over; I mean everything was moved around. Even the egregious amount of old clothes seemingly walked around on their own and ended up planting themselves in places that seemed semi-organized. Finally, I heard another deep chunk and turned back around to find the tape waiting for retrieval. It was no longer glowing on the sides.

I felt tired, and I still do. I just put the tape down beside the machine and covered it with a shirt. I headed back downstairs and locked the latch again, but I jumped as I heard something slam into it, followed by more scratching.

That was yesterday. I remember lying around the house for the rest of the day with all the lights off. It was surprisingly easy to brush off the manager's death. After all, he was aiding a local crime ring in selling drugs, and not like pot, I mean, the life-ruining ones. Also, Gregg told me he was kind of a dick. But, really, I was bothered by the situation I had found myself in. I was in a new world of unknowns, and I didn't know any of the rules, if there were rules at all. It's also just hard to relax with such an ominous space looming just above me, emanating those scratching sounds, all day long. 

What certainly didn't help was that I'd slowly begun to work my way through the fridge, and a fresh batch of bills had piled in through the mail, but, much to my surprise, when I came out to check the mail this morning, I found another envelope. It was cream colored, and the textured paper was very pleasant to touch. When I opened it, I found a check, one from Mr. Cavae, to me, and with enough money on it to clear all my worries about bills and groceries. There was a note. 

"Good job on your first order, Wyatt. For this first order, we're giving you the whole check, but from here on out 30% goes back to us. Keep this up, and you'll have plenty more deposits to look forward to as you clear your debts."

I wondered for a moment why someone as powerful as him, or whatever he was representing, would have any need for Earthly cash, but I just decided to take my money and shut up. I was also grateful that I wasn't going to be punished for my mistake.

And now, here I am. I've paid all the bills and bought all the fridge essentials: eggs, pizza rolls, almond milk, and beer. The scratching has quieted down a bit, but it's still there. I catch myself wondering if I should try to find some way out of this, to end my "relationship" with Cavae and all this madness, but something tells me that's not an option anymore. I think after I post this, I'll check on the next order. Maybe keep a look out in case I'm dumb enough to do another [order](https://www.reddit.com/user/MDTStories/). Wish me luck, pray for me, or do whatever it is you do. I'll try to get an update on Gregg.
