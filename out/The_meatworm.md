I remember when i was 13 years old my parents never allowed me into the basement of our 2 story home. Me, my brother (who i'll call james), and my friend (who i'll call kip) were all having a fun hangout at my house. At the time my parents were both out but they knew that i had company over and told me 3 things.

1. Lock the doors when we leave
2. Do not open the door for anyone but us, no matter who they say they are
3. And 3, do NOT under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES go in the basement.

I was used to hearing those rules after years and years of being told the same thing. My parents never actually gave me or my sister a good reason for why we weren't allowed in the basement, they always just said the same thing, "You're too young to know and you have no reason to know either." 

 I had a small crush on my friend and so did my brother, this made things a lot more difficult for the both of us...constantly trying to one-up each other to show her which one of us was the bravest. My brother did a flip off the second story onto the couch to prove how brave he was...I knew there was no way in hell I'd be able to top that (and I didn't want to get hurt).

 My young 13 year old mind only came to one conclusion on how to prove I was the bravest...

Go. Inside. The. Basement.

When my brother found out of what I was planning he starting panicking begging me to not go down in the basement. He told me that we'd get in a lot of trouble if my mom or dad found out and we would be grounded for the rest of our life...this of course didn't phase me since my mind was set on proving this girl that I was the bravest person ever. James (My brother) and Kip (Our friend) huddled behind me as I fingered the rust lock keeping us out. 

"Dude this is such a stupid idea." James said in annoyance but with a hint of fear. I ignored his efforts to talk me out of going inside the basement.

 "They're probably just keeping money or vintage stuff down here James, it's fine." Kip said, trying to cheer my brother up.

The rusty door handle fell off after 15 minutes of messing with it, the door slowly creaked open...

The basement was pitch black, as if no light could enter. I slowly crept one foot down onto the first stair of the basement. 

To be completely honest I was scared beyond belief...but I'd do anything just to please this girl and convince her that I was the best to get with.  
My hands dragged up and down the walls as I tried to find a light switch...everything about this was horrifying. The damp feeling of the walls gently soaked my finger tips as I treaded down further into the basement.  


I stepped a singular foot onto the solid concrete floor of our basement, my shoes instantly becoming soaked with some type of liquid...  


"What's going on down there?" James yelled down.

"What do you see?" Kip replied after james.  


I squint my eyes as if it would help me see anything in this pitch darkness...as guilty as I feel now, I decided to lie to them.  


"It's pretty cool down here! There's a lot of CD's and stuff." I yelled up to my friends. 

Slowly the floorboards started creaking as they made their way down to the basement.

"Dude...I cant see anything in here" James said.

A slimy meat slid quickly past my leg, I screamed and fell into my brothers arms.

"What? What are you screaming for?" Kip said, visibly shaking out of fear.

"Something just... Something just slid past my leg...I could feel it!" I cried out.

I ran upstairs and slammed the door shut as James went to grab furniture to board it up.

Little to my knowledge, that wouldn't be the last of the meatworm in my basement...
