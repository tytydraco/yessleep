The lights from the ambulance and police vehicles were blinding as we approached. “Looks like they’ve blocked off a perimeter.” Will said, his voice matter of fact.

“That’s what I was afraid of.” Sgt. Wells added, his face unchanging as usual.

We walked to where the line of cruisers sat. “Stop there,” an unknown voice spoke from behind the flashing lights.

“We work here. Let us through.” I said, a hint of annoyance underlaid in my voice.

“There’s nothing to see.” He said. “Let us do our job and move on.” 

A figure stepped into the light. I still couldn’t see him clearly, but his voice sounded familiar. “Let me through.” Sgt. Well’s voice boomed with authority from behind me.

“Sir?” the man asked, stepping closer. It was Officer Bradley, a newer officer for the police side of the department. Fresh out of academy. Fear flashed over his face followed by embarrassment. “Sergeant Wells, I didn’t know it was you.” Scrambling to pull back the barricade. “Go on through sir. Sorry for making you wait.”

Sgt. Wells stepped past Will and I, “It’s fine. Just doing your job.” There was a slight bitterness in his voice – barely noticeable, unless you really knew Sgt. Wells like we did. It wasn’t anger or annoyance. It was concern, maybe even fear.

Will and I moved to follow Sgt. Wells. “Just him.” Bradley barked, feigning authority. His tone didn’t sit well with me, he wasn’t genuinely trying to power trip. The tone was that of someone trying to cover-up genuine fear.

“It’s fine guys, go home. Get some rest. I’ll tell you what I can later.” Sgt. Wells ordered.

I turned to Will, shooting him a look of ‘was that an order?’. “Yessir.” Will said.

He patted me on the shoulder, almost pushing me away from the barricade. “Will–” I began.

“Not here.” Will said sharply. “C’mon. Let’s go.”

We walked back to our cars. The lights flashed in the distance. “The fuck man?” I spat. “This is our turf. Why wouldn’t they let us in?”

Will took a deep breath, “Because it probably wasn’t involving an inmate.”

“What?” I said. “Well, I guess that makes sense.” I scratched my head. “What do you think happened then?”

Will gave me his famous, ‘is that a real question’ look. “My guess, a hiker got lost or mauled and stumbled their way to the perimeter in a last ditch effort for safety only to drop dead on our doorstep.” He smiled, “Or at least that’s what the cover story will end up being.”

“Has this happened before?” I asked.

“Not in my time,” Will said, “but it wouldn’t surprise me if that’s the story they fabricate.” He breathed out an annoyed breath, “Plausible enough for the general public not to ask questions, obvious enough for those ‘in the know’ to know better than to question it.”

“Fuck, you’re right.” I sighed. “I just need to know what’s going on. How else are we supposed to figure this shit out?” I said, clearly annoyed and angry.

“And what difference does that make?” Will argued, “Where does that knowledge get us? Unless it’s someone we know for a fact is connected, it’s just another tally mark on the woman’s death count.”

Will was right, it wouldn’t get us any closer to solving this. If anything, it would only throw another loose end in the mix. I wanted to be mad at Will for arguing, or Bradley for power tripping, or even Sgt. Wells for not fighting to get us back there. But deep down, I knew Will was right, Bradley was terrified, and Sgt. Wells was protecting us. Everything in me wanted to scream in frustration. We stood in silence for a while. “You’re right,” I sighed, “and honestly, even if it was someone we knew was involved, I don’t know what information that would reveal, if any.”

“What was that?” Will said jokingly.

“You heard me,” I said.

“No no no,” Will joked, “I want to hear you say it.”

Rolling my eyes in jest, “You were right,” I moaned.

We laughed for a bit. It felt good. “See, was it really that hard?”

“Y’know, the last time I was asked that exact question,” I joked, “your mom walked away smiling and limping and I got a juice box.”

Will just stared at me in feigned shock, “I cannot believe you, sir! My mom said those juice boxes were only for my lunches!”

I laughed, “That’s the take-away from what I said?”

Will smacked my chest, “Well yeah, she’s a grown woman who can do whatever she wants. BUT those juice boxes were mine! I had dibs!”

For a moment we both keeled over, crying laughing at our own stupid jokes, forgetting about everything happening. It was nice.

When I stood straight to catch my breath from laughing, I could see the flashing lights in the distance. Just like that, the fun ended. We were brutally snapped back into reality as we watched the flashing lights stop, one by one. “Let’s go, Jay.” Will said.

“They aren’t driving away.” I pointed out.

Just then, we saw in the distance, a line of black SUVs drive up to the scene. “Well, Feds are back. No use hanging around waiting for answers, they’ll likely be here all night.”

“Yeah, let’s go.” I sighed. We got in our cars and drove off.

After days of unanswered questions and growing paranoia, I found a note in my locker. It simply said ‘The Expert’ with an address below.

I was expecting the directions to take me to a metaphysical store or something similar. As I drove, the GPS took me out of town. I took a turn into an abandoned housing community. The roads were paved but cracking. The sidewalks were bulged and splintered. Foliage was growing through the cracks, like a parasite sucking the life from its prey. While driving to my destination, I could see rows and rows of plots in neat lines. Some plots were empty. Littered throughout, I could see the remains of what were once promising houses, now wrought with decay. These forgotten monuments of prosperity, now marked the graves of forgotten dreams. Something deep inside told me if I were to get out of my car, I might see the ghosts of families that never were, a community only occupied by the memories that weren’t made.

I saw a single completed building down the road. A minute or two later, I pulled into the parking lot of what was clearly a house that someone had turned into a business office. It was a small building and it had an attached garage. My heart began to race when I noticed that the house was nestled up against the edge of the forest, the looming canopy casting long finger-like shadows on the ground, claiming this land, almost holding it in its grasp. On closer inspection, the shadows fractured and split, steering clear of the land where the building staked its claim.

When I stepped out of my car, a wave of calm washed over me, dissolving the unease placed by the land outside. Any prior doubt I had vanished, I knew I was where I needed to be. “Hello, Jay.” A voice came from the front door.

When I looked up, I saw a slender man standing there. He was older, about my height, with long brown hair. His clothes looked like they were stolen from a 1970’s hippie movie. “How did y–” I choked.

He walked towards my car. “I know many things, Jay,” his tone was calming and conveyed care. “We don’t have long, come.” He waved. “My name is David by the way.”

The feeling this land, even David, gave off starkly contrasted the surrounding forest. It felt natural…..human. I followed him into the house. “So, what DO you know?” I asked, the sharp tone caught me off guard. I cleared my throat. “I mean—what did Sergeant Wells tell you?” I tumbled to sound more casual.

David chuckled briefly. “I know you are marked, and don’t know it or why. More importantly,” he paused, “I know you are out of your depth and your only chance at survival is to learn from me.”

My eyes widened, “Marked?” panic filling my throat. “What do you mean, ‘marked’?” My heart raced as I tried to compose myself.

“Hey,” he said, placing a calming hand on my shoulder, “it’s going to be okay.” His face showed compassion, but his eyes, however, showed something else. I studied his face for a moment. The wrinkles on his brow displayed experience. His eyes spoke of exhaustion—apparent yet overshadowed by his calm demeanor. Maybe there was something else behind his eyes, but I chalked that up to fatigue. His smile, practiced yet genuine, gave the feeling of reassurance. “I’m here to help. Wells told me a little bit about the situation you’re in. There was only one piece of information he gave me that I didn’t already know.” I stared into his eyes, there was no sign of deception or malice, but something just didn’t sit right. “Can you guess what that was?” he asked, his grip tightening slightly, almost unnoticeable.

I let his words digest before I spoke. Something deep inside told me this was a test, and I didn’t want to know what would happen should I fail. “My name.” I said plainly. That’s when it hit me, his eyes held this mix of trepidation, empathy, and a slight hint of willingness to harm.

David’s smile dropped. His gaze matching mine. The room fell silent. Him not braking his focus, me maintaining mine. After a long moment, he spoke, “Exactly.” His voice, relieved. His expression changed to that of pure determination. “Now, it’s time to get started.” He released my shoulder and laughed. Now it’s time for your questions, I know you have many.

The energy in the room shifted. His eyes now only show excitement and determination. “Who is Ariel?” I asked, the words involuntarily spewing from my mouth. The name echoed in my head, but no matter how hard I thought or focused, I couldn’t figure out where that name came from.

My words hung in the air for a long moment. David stared at me with surprise, then confusion, then anger, and finally grief before staring at the ground. Just as I was about to explain to him that those words were not mine, he looked back up at me. “Do you know who she is?” he asked, his tone was that of acknowledging he knew I didn’t. “Here, sit.” David motioned to a chair behind me. I slumped down into the chair, my head spinning with confusion. “Just breathe, Jay.” I nodded, taking slow, deep breaths. “Ariel was my wife. She died some years ago.”

“I’m-” I said, “I’m so sorry David. I didn’t–”

He put a hand up towards me, “Oh it’s quite alright. She’s who sent you here.”

I felt a weird sense of understanding. Normally this would have surprised me, but then again, nothing about this is normal. “Oh..” my voice trailing off.

“But that’s not what’s important.” He explained. “To answer the question I know is in the front of your brain, Ariel isn’t the name anyone would find her under. I was the only one to call her that, and nobody living knows about that.”

“So the fact I said that name, was more of her vouching for me?” I asked.

I could tell the surprised look on David’s face was more because of my understanding than the question itself. “Yes.” He answered. “I know those words were not actually yours, Jay. She was sending me a message, telling me that you are important and to help you.”

“What did you mean when you said I was marked?” I asked.

David smiled with excitement, “That’s what I’ve been waiting for.”

“For me to ask you?”

“No, for someone to actually want answers. The fact you didn’t ask why you’re important or try to deny it, shows me you understand the gravity of the situation.” He grabbed the book Sgt. Wells gave me from my hands. “Have you read any of this yet?”

“I’ve skimmed a couple pages, but no, I haven’t really read anything.” I said.

“Good, clean slate,” he said. “Now, to answer your question.” He sat down in the chair next to me. “When I say ‘marked’ I don’t mean physically. Tell me, are you from here?”

“I’m not from this specific area, but I am from nearby.” I said.

He nodded, “Okay, well at some point in your past, you encountered one of ‘his’ pets. Anything come to mind?” he asked. His eyes narrowed in concentration.

I sat for a moment, trying to think of anything that stands out. “Not immediately.” I answered.

David frowned, “Knowing what you do now, it shouldn’t be hard to think of something from your past—something similar to what you’ve seen recently.” He sat back for a moment, his eyes deep in thought. Suddenly and without warning, he shot up, “Ah-ha!” he exclaimed. He strode out of the room, each step echoed with intensity and purpose.

I watched as he disappeared through a door on the back wall. Earlier, when we first walked inside, adrenaline blurred everything but him. Now it was like the room allowed me to see it—like it was waiting for his approval. It was likely planned to be a living room, but now converted to an office. But it felt too precise—more akin to an operating theater. It was big enough for what was needed.

And now, with him gone, the room began to unveil itself—bit by bit.

The back wall held two doors, perfectly spaced apart: one led to another room, the other led to a bathroom. Across from me, three evenly spaced windows sat on the far wall—their position felt unnatural, like no human could place them this perfectly. In the back corner, a pair of filing cabinets and a desk formed a neat office space. In the front corner, there was a circular table with four chairs neatly tucked around it. The front wall held the front door in one corner. In the other corner, a window, perfectly centered in its half of the wall. “Something about this is off. No house is this symmetrical. This precise,” I whispered to myself, “No, this is intentional.” My mind raced at the thought.

I looked back at the window across from me and saw, neatly arranged and centered, seven potted plants.

“Huh,” I muttered, “that’s satisfying.”

I noticed the middle plant was perfectly centered with the window, with three others on each side, stopping exactly with the edge of the window trim. I stood up, and walked around the room.

As I walked towards the table, my foot accidentally kicked the edge of a pot, moving it slightly. Slowing only to make a mental note, not fixing it, I found myself thinking aloud, “With how intentional the symmetry seems, I would have gone with a square table—something more willing to match the angles.” I got to the table and laughed, “Oh, that’s sneaky.” I saw it was one of those square tables with curved leafs to unfold into a circle.

When I looked up at the ceiling, I noticed three rows of two can lights followed the same pattern as everything else in the room. I sat back down, the room was silent. Taking another moment to look around, I tried to shake the thoughts telling me something was wrong. No matter how many times I looked around, everything just felt too exact, too calculated. “This wasn’t built for comfort, it was designed for purpose,” I thought.

The only question in my mind was, ‘What was the intent here?’

I looked back to the window across from me. “What the fuck?” I whispered. There was this low, gentle hum flowing in and out—almost pulsing. Breathing? That’s when I saw the pot I kicked—moving. Slowly, methodically sliding back into its home. Like it had never been disturbed. The lights slightly fading in and out—mimicking the hum. As it came to a stop, I blinked and everything was back to how it was. The hum was gone, the lights back to their original setting. “Is this place alive? Was everything like this originally or did whatever now possesses the land make it so?”

“Sorry for the wait,” David said, walking through the door. “Ended up being buried.” As he fully came into the room, I could see he held a book. “Read this instead. The one Wells gave you is good, but not exactly what you need.” He smiled—his mouth pulling towards his eyes, but never quite reaching them.

I reached out and grabbed the book. It was old and weathered. On the cover, written in big blocky letters, ‘The Forest: A Guide’. “Thank you.” I said.

“Now, did you think about anything sticking out from your past?” He asked.

I meant to pause for a moment, to really think, but my mouth opened and the words just poured out without my say-so. “Yes. When I was a child, my father took me on a hike to go fishing at this remote creek. We set our lines and waited.” David leaned forward in his seat, his face reflected pure concentration. “We could not have been there more than an hour. This large shadow floated through the trees on the other side of the water. I remember watching it for maybe a minute before my pole began to twitch. My attention immediately on the potential of catching my first fish. I called for my dad to help.” The memory playing out in my mind. “When I looked up, I saw my dad staring at the shadow, watching as it disappeared.”

“Where was this at?” He asked. I could feel the anticipation, heavy in the air.

“Honestly, I don’t remember.” I said. “If I had to guess, probably \[redacted\] about two counties up.”

David, seemingly deep in thought, asked, “Did you catch the fish?”

“No, it broke the line before I could reel it in.” I said with a slight chuckle at the shift in atmosphere. “But a little after that, we both heard a woman’s voice. ‘Jay,’ both me and my father thought it was the wind, that’s how low it was.” My chest felt heavy at the realization of the memory. “What exactly am I up against here?”

David stared at me, his eyes bulging in shock. “How long ago was this?” he asked, slight panic in his words.

“Um….” I paused, doing the math in my head, “Twenty years ago? Give or take a year.”

We both sat in silence, my words hanging in the air.

“Hmm.” David broke the silence. “I’m going to try something. I need you to trust me on this.” He stood up, moving to the plants.

His movement seemed frantic—like someone internally scattered. “Okay?” skepticism peeking through my voice. When he walked by, a gust of wind brushed the back of my neck. Goosebumps rippled over my skin, and the air hung—heavy and stale. My sixth gave a warning hidden beneath the uncanny silence.

“I need to see the mark. But in order to do so, we need to see your metaphysical body.” He explained.

“What do you mean?” I asked.

David stopped what he was doing and faced me. “Everybody has their physical body, the one we see with our eyes.” He turned back to the plants. “But everyone also has a metaphysical body. Some people call it ‘aura’; others call it ‘chakra’. Call it what you will, it’s all the same thing.” Turning back towards me, he held two bulbs in his hands.

“I think I’m starting to get it.”

“People like you and me are known as ‘seers’.” He sat back down. “With the proper setting and ingredients. We can see things others can’t see. Hear things others can’t hear. Feel things others can’t feel.”

“Why can’t anyone, with the same conditions, see it too?” I asked.

“Let me ask you this. Have you ever sensed anything nobody around you didn’t?”

I thought hard for a moment, “Maybe a few times.”

“Instances like those, are examples of your gift showing.” His eyes held a look of reassurance. “Look at it this way: let’s say you can hear just fine on your own, but your friend is slightly hard of hearing. They can hear alright but they can’t make out those finer details. Now lets say both of you are given the same set of headphones with amplification built in. Your friend would be able to hear what you do on a normal day. You, however, would be able to hear even the faintest sounds.”

“I get what you’re saying, but what does that have to do with those?” I asked, pointing to the bulbs.

“These are your headphones.” He handed me one of the bulbs. “If someone without the same gift were to take one of these, it would only bring them up to our regular level. When we take one, it amplifies everything already there.”

“So how does it work?” I grabbed the bulb. It was a light blue and smelled like a rose.

“You eat it,” he said, popping it in his mouth and chewing. “C’mon.” Sounding more like a grunt through the paste he chewed, he motioned for me to eat.

I hesitated. On one hand, I wanted answers. On the other hand, I just met this guy. The house began to hum, almost—like it was anticipating me eating the flower. I sighed, “Fuck it.” The floor gently vibrated as I hesitantly brought the bulb closer. The room now taking on a claustrophobic feeling. I looked around, “When will I know to swallow?”

The lights now pulsed alongside the humming, like the whole house was watching—waiting for me to see. “Don’t be a bitch,” he joked, but there was a sharp bite to his words, “stop stalling.” David now glared at me, annoyed and losing patience.

David started breathing heavy, “I…I’ve never done this befo—” I stopped as I felt his hand on my elbow, pushing the bulb onto my lips. The air around me buzzed.

His breath grew louder, quicker.

My lips parted.

The room began to heat.

The vibration—more intense.

I opened my mouth.

The lights pulsed in and out—like waves.

I pushed the bulb past my lips.

The hum grew louder, faster.

I pushed it to my tongue—sweat beading on my brow.

David’s breathing, the humming, vibrating, and pulsing all in unison—like one giant organism bred for this moment.

‘I never should have come here.’ I thought. Then, instinctively—

I bit down.

…

Silence—the air, thick and muggy, hung stale and frozen.

My teeth ground together, breaking the outer petals of the bulb with a sharp snap—like a garden pea.

Unforgivably slow and painful, I felt my body tingle and recoil—it started in the marrow of my bones…and radiated out.

Saliva dispersed the taste through my mouth—at first, it was like sugar water—sweet, innocent…

Just as I let my guard down—I was quickly and brutally tricked.

Time slowed to a crawl.

It’s deceptive sweetness now curdled into something foul on my tongue—remnants of what once was alive, now decaying.

The sound of that first crunch reverberated through the house with a deep, hollow whoosh.

The muscles in my jaw locked, my body stuck still at the thought, ‘It was soft when I held it.’

My eyes looked to David—he stared back with a fiery impatience, and a flash of contempt that stung with dismissive haste.

The cracked bulb sat on my tongue, oozing its thick, acidic innards down my throat—only an unholy film remained.

Its flavor—more akin to rotting meat marinated in perfume.

A sickly bitter taste of rot overwhelmed my tastebuds—eyes watered in revolt.

My conscious battled against the subconscious reflex to swallow…waking something deep inside.

Muscles moving again, I heaved—my throat reintroducing the bulb to itself.

I held my breath, trying to regain control over my stomach’s desire to wretch.

‘Chew goddamnit! It’s poison if not eaten all together!’ The voice echoed so loud in my head, I thought it broke the silence. My inner voice played messenger to something deep inside.

Forcing my jaws to move again, I began chewing. “Hehehe,” this dry, guttural sound guised as laughter filled the air around me—mocking my torment.

‘Was that David?’ I thought, but I never saw him move. ‘This can’t be happening.’

Like lancing an abscess, a sense of relief filled the air as the room retreated back to its original form. I could feel the shadows retreat back, and the static dissipate. David’s office now felt happy—like a spoiled toddler finally getting their way.

The lights seemed brighter, happier even. ‘Was it always this bright?’ I tried to remember, but the bulb clouded my thoughts.

As I chewed, the causticity bloomed—like soap and persistent bile.

I felt a tickle in-between my fingers as they sat on the armrest. When I rubbed them together to get rid of the discomfort, it got worse. Looking down, I almost choked on the flower when I saw my hand beside itself—only the duplicate was semi-translucent. I clinched my eyes shut, ‘Huh—Wha—What the fuck was that? Oh fuck. No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no. This isn’t fucking happening,’ my mind panicking.

As soon as my eyes slammed shut, I could feel the house calling again—beckoning me deeper into the spiral of madness.

Each movement of my jaw felt more forced than the last.

Snap…

The walls humming—no, moving?

Crunch…

‘Stop! Stop! Stop!’ That voice deep down coming back.

Crunch…

The smell of electricity filled the air—my hair standing on end.

Sna–gag…

I held my mouth still to keep from ejecting the foul fauna.

Crunch…

‘Jay! Fucking pull it together.’ Same voice—now echoing all around me.

Heave…Crunch…

I paused and caught my breath.

Crunch…

I opened my eyes and my hand was back to normal. I looked up at David–his eyes never lost intensity, that contempted impatience.

David’s glare cartoonishly morphed into a smile, though his eyes remained void of any emotion—staring through me. “That’s it, Jay. Keep chewing,” his voice almost cheering, like an older friend helping the ‘baby’ of the group through their first hangover—only I never asked for this. “You’re past the worst of it now.” Words meant to comfort—meant to encourage. But from him, they felt grotesque bait. Void of sincerity. He wasn’t trying to comfort or encourage me through something. No, David was pulling me in deeper.

I wanted to spit it out. But when I tried to open my mouth, David sprung like a trap—pinning my head between the wall and his hand. His palm stopped my lips from parting. His fingers held my jaw in place.  “What the fuck,” I moaned through a clenched mouth.

His hands moved with sharp, deliberate purpose. And then I saw it again—in his eyes. That same fucking glint from the beginning. No fear. No panic. Only willingness—the kind that wouldn’t flinch at drawing blood. Maybe even relishing the chance.

‘I’m going to fucking die here.’ I thought, as I swallowed, feeling the bitter flower slide down my throat.

“You’re not going to die.” He said flatly. “Drink this.”

Without a word, David handed me a cup. It smelled like tea…but not quite. “How—”

‘You don’t listen too good, do you?’ He spat. ‘I fucking told you, when we take those, we don’t just see—we feel everything.’

I instinctively took a sip of the tea—that same bitter taste from the flower clung to my throat. “David, what the fuck?” 

‘Drink the fucking tea, Jay.’ David commanded, his hands forcing the cup to my lips. Something snapped behind his eyes, ‘I need you to see what we’re up against.’ A deflated resignation now replaced the crazed rage.

‘Why would Sgt. Wells send me here?’ I thought.

He looked at me in confusion, ‘Who’s Wel—’. Immediately he switched to this look of pure rage, and laughed—deep distorted belly laugh. ‘I never said I knew him.’

The house buzzed—’was it laughing with him?’

“Yeah you did!” I yelled. “You said Sgt. Wells told you a lot about me.” I could feel my chest beat with my heart.

‘You fucking idiot. You’re the one who asked what Wells told me,’ he got in close, this shiteating grin on his face, ‘I just ran with it.’

That’s when it hit me. I could hear the words he spoke, but his mouth— “What does this really do then?” my voice now panicked. His mouth wasn’t moving. “What the fuck do you want from me?”

‘Exactly what I said it does.’ His thoughts echoed around me.

My vision started to blur. Then clear. Then blur again. “What’s happening?” Colorful lines, overlapping colors, and heatwave-like waves coming off of David.

“It’s kicking in, Jay.” Visible vibrations leaked from his head. “Clear your mind. Fighting it will make it worse.”

“Fuck off!” I screamed in my head—but it wasn’t in my head. It echoed everywhere. The room darkened and the once low hum of the house was now this ominous reverb.

“The more you fight it, the worse it will be.” His face now panicked. “Breathe, Jay. Breathe.”

I gripped the sides of my head, “Fuck you. You fucking did this to me!”

“Do you believe in ghosts?” A familiar voice whispered like a memory all around me, “Oh, you will.”

“C–c—corp—ral?” I felt the tears flow.

“We received a message last night.” It was his voice, but it sounded distant—just out of reach.

“H–help m–m–me p–pl–please,” a different voice now, “W–Will.”

“Ryan, I’m sorry we—” My voice cracked, “we couldn’t save you.” I looked all around me but couldn’t see anyone. 

“Who are you talking to?” David’s voice called over the echoes.

“Help me!” Ryan’s voice boomed from echoed whisper to ground shaking yell.

I fell to my knees, “What kind of sick joke is this?”

“Jay, open your eyes!” I could feel David grabbing my shoulders, only when I opened my eyes, he wasn’t in front of me. “Who the fuck are you talking to?!” I felt a slap across my face.

I found my way back to the chairs and saw David shaking me. “David, what the fuck did you do to me?” I was not in my body. “Why can I see myself?”

He stood up, my soulless body—more a hollow vessel now—slumped back into the chair. David turned towards my voice and let out this sickening laugh, “It fucking worked!”

“What do you me—”

“Officer Jay. Glad to see you’re awake.” Another familiar voice whispered around me.

“Do you not hear this?” I cried.

“Where do you think the rules came from?” It was Agent Smith’s voice.

I wiped the tears from my face, but something felt off. The tears felt thick, slick, like they smeared rather than coming off. The smell of iron tickled my nose.

I looked at my hand, “Wha–what the fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck?” Blood covered my hand where tears should have been. “No, no, no, no, no, no.” I pleaded with myself. “This isn’t real. This isn’t real.”

“Jay, just let it happen.” David’s voice took on this gross tone of annoyance and matter of factness. “It will all be over soon.”

“What the fuck is that supposed to mean?” I felt this familiar presence enter the room but couldn’t quite tell how it was familiar.

“Who were you talking to?” David’s voice was filled with malice.

“What do you mean ‘it will all be over soon’? What the fuck did you do to me?” I asked through sobs.

“You don’t get to fucking ask questions.” The anger in his voice seemed to be masking panic. “Now, fucking answer me!”

I felt the slap this time. He didn’t my body behind him, he hit me. “How—”

He cut me off with another slap. “Non-compliance will only make this worse.” He pulled his hand back, I could see on his palm was what looked like some scribbles, “I’ll ask one last time. Who were you talking to?”

My eyes darted back and forth from the fire in his eyes to the writing on his hand— it was glowing. “Fuck you.” I spat.

His face morphed from rage to this nauseating happiness. “So be it.” David struck me repeatedly. Each strike harder than the last. If I was in my body, this may have broken several bones. In my current state, I had no clue what this would do, but I didn’t want to find out.

I put my arm up, “Fine, I’ll tell you.”

David smiled in satisfaction, “Okay, tell me.”

“I heard the voices of two people I watched die in the forest.” Saying out loud, I realized I never have actually processed what happened. Bloody tears burned my eyes as they poured onto the floor. “Now will you answer my questions?” I asked, my own rage boiling up.

His face just showed content. “No.” there was almost no emotion or tone when he said it.

“Wha–” I began, “why not?”

“You’ll join them soon enough.” His voice was cold, and he stood there unmoving just staring. I wasn’t even sure if he was still breathing.

Something inside told me to run to my body. I sat and waited for him to take his eyes off me. After what felt like eternity, David turned towards the door like someone had knocked. Seeing this was my chance, I bolted up. ‘Hope this works’ whispered through my mind.

I matched my steps with his.

He reached for the door, I reached for my arm.

The handle turned and so did I.

As David pulled open the door, I sat into myself.

I felt the light from outside on my skin—only on my skin. I was back into my physical self. Almost immediately, the psychedelic effects of that flower left.

“You think you’re clever huh?” David asked, smiling.

I saw a figure behind him, but the light from outside gave no details. “When I tried to pull you out, you told me to keep going.” A familiar voice whispered in my head. I forced myself to ignore it and deal with it later.

Dread filled my throat as I realized he planned for this all along. That’s why he turned away from me. He wanted me in my body. “Who are you?” I asked, standing up. “Why are you doing this?”

The door closed, “You know, I really don’t know.” His voice was smug and mocking.

As my eyes adjusted, I could see there was no second figure—just me and him. “Just let me go.” I pleaded.

“I couldn’t stop you if I tried.” His voice sounded sincere—almost sad, it caught me off guard.

I blinked, trying to process what he said. When I opened my eyes, he was gone. I looked around, this place was not what I remembered it to be when I arrived. The walls were in shambles, there were holes in the roof, and the windows busted out.

‘Where did that note come from?’ I thought.

I pulled out the paper and watched as the letters twisted and turned. When they stopped they formed the phrase ‘The dead are never truly dead.’ I turned over the paper to check the back and watched the words appear, ‘Once the message. Now the messenger.’

I saw a book similar to the one David gave me lying on the ground. I picked it up, the title read ‘Mark of the Forest by David \[redacted\]’.

I ran out the front door and got in my car. As I pulled out of the parking lot, I noticed the shadows from the forest now claimed that land.

When I got back home, I saw two texts had come in.

The first was from Will ‘Hey, Schmidt’s retirement party is in 3 weeks. You wanna go in on a gift with me?’

Then a second text came in, from Mary. ‘When is your next appointment with Carrie? I tried calling her office but they said she's been out of town for a few days now and don’t know when she’ll be back.’
