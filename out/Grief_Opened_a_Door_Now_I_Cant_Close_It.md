I want to bury Cooper beneath the big oak tree in the backyard. It was the only place that felt right. We used to sit there at night. Him chewing a stick, me sipping a beer, both of us watching the sun spill orange across the treetops.

He was twelve. Old for a sheepdog mutt. His back legs had gotten weak, and the vet said there wasn’t much left to do. I stayed with him on that cold steel table until his eyes stopped seeing me. It shattered me.

The house got way too quiet after that. Too still. I kept waiting to hear his tags jingling, his claws tapping across the floor. But there was only silence. My routine fell apart. I stopped shaving. Barely ate. Started sleeping on the couch just to avoid the empty spot at the foot of my bed.

That was six days ago. The scratching started on the seventh. 

It was just past midnight. Windy. I was half-drunk, dozing in front of some late-night infomercial. At first, I thought it was a branch. But then it came again. Scratch-scratch-scratch—at the back door. A slow, steady rhythm. Purposeful. Familiar.

Like how Cooper used to paw at the door when he wanted to come in. I froze. My heart was pounding so loud it drowned out the TV. I told myself it was just an animal, probably a raccoon or a stray cat.

But when I opened the door, the breath caught in my throat.nThere he was. Cooper. Matted. Caked in mud. Ribs showing through his fur. His left eye cloudy, the other a glowing yellow I didn’t recognize. But it was him. That bent ear. That crooked tail. And he was wagging it.

I should’ve slammed the door. Called someone. Run. But grief messes with your brain. It twists things. Breaks logic. You start hoping, even when hope makes no damn sense.

“…Cooper?” I croaked.

He let out a soft bark. The kind he used to make when he wanted me to throw the ball. I stepped aside. He trotted in.

I didn’t sleep that night. I just sat across from him in the living room, watching. He didn’t eat. Didn’t drink. Didn’t lie down. Just sat there, staring at me. Tongue out. Smiling.

But dogs don’t smile like that. Around 3 a.m., I dozed off on the couch. When I opened my eyes, Cooper was right next to me. Too close. His face was inches from mine, eyes wide open, mouth stretched back in that grotesque grin.

Then, in a voice that wasn’t his, but came from his throat, he whispered:

“Thanks for letting me in.”

I jumped off the couch, heart slamming against my ribs. Cooper or whatever the hell it was just sat there, tail slowly thumping the floor.

“I’m dreaming,” I told myself. “This is grief. Just grief. A breakdown, that’s all.”

But that whisper had cut through the fog like a blade. It was too clear. Too real. I stumbled into the kitchen, grabbed the biggest knife I could find, spun around and…he was gone.

No paw prints. No fur on the couch. No smell. Like he’d never been there at all. I didn’t sleep the next night. Or the one after that. But every night, at exactly 00:07, I heard the scratching at the door again. Same rhythm. Same soft bark when I didn’t answer. Then silence.

On the third night, I waited by the door, knife in hand, no intention of opening it. But I still heard his voice, this time from inside the walls.

“You let me in once.”

I punched a hole in the drywall, trying to find the source. Nothing. I went to the vet. Demanded to see Cooper’s body. The receptionist looked uncomfortable.

“I’m sorry… but he was cremated yesterday.”

“Who authorized that?”

She checked the file.

“You did, Mr. Carver. You signed the paperwork the day he was put down.”

I hadn’t signed anything. I remember leaving in a daze, forgetting my keys but I never signed a thing. I asked for a copy. There it was. My signature. Only… it wasn’t mine. I don’t write my R’s like that. That’s when I started locking every door, every window. I salted the thresholds. Burned sage. Holy water. Everything I could find online, no matter how insane it sounded.

The scratching didn’t stop. But now it came from different doors. The closet. The attic. Once, even from under the bed. Every night. Always at 00:07.

And each night, the voice came a little closer.

“You let me in once. You can’t take it back.”

On the fifth night, I woke up with him sitting on my chest. He was heavier than he should’ve been. Eyes like molten gold. His jaw hung open, tongue dripping black. I couldn’t move. His mouth stretched wider than any dog’s ever could—far too wide—and he spoke again.

“You called me back. Begged for me. I’m yours now.” Then he leaned in until his teeth brushed my cheek.

“Forever.”

I blacked out.

The next morning, I tried to leave. I packed a bag, got in my van, and drove until the low fuel light came on. Every road looped back. Every single one. The signs changed, but I always ended up on Ashwood Lane, my street. The sun never moved in the sky. The dashboard clock stayed frozen at 11:59. I stopped at the gas station at the end of the street. It was boarded up. Covered in dust. The lights inside flickered, but no one was there.

On my way out, I saw the posters. Missing pets. Dozens of them. Eyes scratched out. Smiles twisted. Some of them looked like they were still smiling… after death. When I got back home, the front door was wide open.

Cooper was waiting inside. He wasn’t pretending anymore. His mouth was stretched into a silent scream of a grin, far too wide. Patches of his fur were sloughing off, wet and rotting. Bone glinted beneath. And his shadow—God, his shadow writhed like a dying spider.

I collapsed on the porch. He stepped past me. Sat at the top of the stairs. Then he spoke again. But this time, it wasn’t his voice. It was mine.

“I missed you so much.”

I stopped fighting after that. I started feeding him. Not food. He didn’t want that. He wanted memories. Smells. Pieces of the old life. I found my dad’s old flannel shirt up in the attic, and he chewed it for hours.

I watched the light fixtures flicker when he got excited. Sometimes, he brought me things. Bones. Teeth. None of them were his. Once, a collar. It said “MILO.” I never had a Milo.

\*\*\*

It’s the eleventh night. I don’t know what’s real anymore. I haven’t seen the sun in two days. Every clock in the house shows a different time. My phone won’t turn on. He’s sitting next to me as I write this, his breath cold against my neck. Every so often, he licks my ear and whispers things I don’t want to hear.

Things about where he came from. Things about what I let in. He says I opened the door, not just the wooden one, but the other one. The thin one. The one that keeps things out. The kind of door that should never be opened once it’s closed.

He says I wanted him back so badly that something else used his shape to get through. He says he’s grateful. And now he wants to show me how to open more doors. He wants to teach me how to knock back.

\*\*\*

I tried to burn the house down. I doused every room in gasoline, lit a match, and watched the flames crawl up the walls. Then I woke up. Back in bed. Cooper on my chest. Smiling.

“You can’t burn a door that’s already open,” he whispered.

I’ve started hearing more scratching. Beneath the floorboards. In the attic. Down the drains. I don’t think the door only opened one way. I don’t think I just let Cooper in.

And I think… I’m changing too.

My reflection doesn’t blink when I do. My voice echoes, even when I whisper. My dreams are full of howling. Cooper sits beside me at night, staring at the walls.

Waiting.

Last night, I heard another voice. A child’s voice. Outside.

“Cooper?” it said. “Come on, boy!”

I opened the door without thinking. Something ran into the woods. It wasn’t Cooper. But he followed it. Laughing. He came back this morning. His fur darker. His teeth sharper.

“Thanks for letting me in,” he said again.

Then, with a wink: “We brought more.”

If you’re reading this: don’t open the door. No matter how familiar the bark sounds. No matter how much you miss them. No matter what they say.

Grief is a door. And something is always waiting on the other side.

Scratching.
