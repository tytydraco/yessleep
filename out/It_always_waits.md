Every single fucking time I forget my earphones. 

It knows. 

I walk down the three flights of stairs from my flat to the front door of the complex. Out the door. Over the car park railing. Thats when I think: music and noise cancelling would be nice. 

I check the designated place for my earphones. They aren’t there. 
Check leggings pockets. No.
Hoodie pockets.
Bag. 
No where to be found. 

Fuck. 

Today will be different. Right?

I can’t read the stupid orangey-yellow dot words and numbers on the train boards, it makes my brain wiggle. 

I check my phone. 
Trains delayed. 
Of course it’s delayed.

Ive accounted for the time-keeping-train-wizards consistent tardiness. 

Still, Waiting for the train takes forever. 

People talk too loud. 

“I will send that-“
“Please can we have that-“
“Have a good-“ 
“Cakes! No g-“

Until it blends into one steaming pile of word salad.

“Eat”
“No”
“Of course”
“email”
“Blue tie”
“Shoes”
“That’s bullshit” 

Zone out. Try. 
Earphones would be nice.

The thing is here. Watching. But it doesn’t move. Not yet. 

The train screeches as it pulls into the station.
Packed. 
No seats. 
Bodies pressed. 
Someone touches me. 
Doesn’t apologise. 
Skin crawls. 
Rage bubbles. 

Just one stop. 

Zone out.

The next station is overflowing. every person on earth works near this station. 

Costa coffee beans.
Cookies from the cookie shop.
Cherry ice vape. 
Sweat.
Too much perfume. 
Cigarette smoke. 

It’s behind me now. Inching across the station tile, scratching lines. Making its way around the people. 

Change in charity buckets rattle.
Someone shouts “any spare change?”
Lights buzz from overhead. 
Clacks from high heels.
Slaps from slip on shoes.

It disregards everyone. Scraping through them. Just keeps coming. 

Heavy floral scent slaps my face at the exit. 

Fresh Air. Finally. 

“Beep beep beep beep” says the green man. 

“Move!” Someone behind screams. 

Suitcases scratch the floor. heels slam. people bump into me like I don’t exist . 


It’s so close. I catch a glimpse of its mass, swirling and swelling in the corner of my eye. 

Bus stop line.
Card reader “Beep”.
Thank the driver. 

The bus hums like a distant earthquake. 
Children scream. Giggling. 
Someone’s Phone on full volume. 

It’s beside me. 

ZONE OUT. 

ZONE-

Can’t. 

Crunching. Chewing. Greasy fried food and cheap sausage rolls waft. 

“ding ding” 

“ding ding” 

“ding ding” 

We get it. The fucking button has been pressed. 
The stupid orangey-yellow dots clearly say ‘bus stopping’.  Stop pressing it. 

 “ding ding” 

“ding ding” 

“Ding ding”

It’s ready now. It’s adjusting its stance. Like a cat about to pounce. 

“Meerp meerp meerp” Doors open.

Run. 
Feet pounding on the pavement. 

It drags the world with it, ripping up the concrete as it chases. It’s long, black, oozy fingers flick my heels. 

Cars honk. 
Birds scatter. 
Voices chatter. 

It swallows the ground behind me.


My skin prickles.
My brain twists.
My Insides churning. 

Tshirt cuffs press hard against my wrists.
Bag bouncing off my hip wrong. 
Shoes are too tight. 
Everything is too tight. 


It grabs my ankle.

Crying.
 Face wet. 
Breath short. 

I reach the door to my workplace. 
click the intercom. 
“Click, buzz.”
Door open. 

Inside. 
I’m inside. 

It screams loud static. The air folds. 

It wants something from me.

But I’m inside. 

I don’t know what it wants. 

It will wait.

Maybe it’s not after me. 

Maybe it’s a part of me.
 
But I’m inside.

It always waits.
