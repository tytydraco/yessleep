I had a dream a few weeks ago. In the dream, I was laying on my side in bed facing the wall. I felt my wife, Nikki, slip into bed behind me and cozy up. I felt her arm wrap around me and she smooched my ear and started talking about our day or something benign. I don't remember what she was saying, but she suddenly said, "wouldn't it be funny if you turned around and I wasn't here?"

I then heard a sound, like a cork popping out of a bottle and felt her arms disappear from around me. Surprised, I turned around and found myself alone on the mattress. I startled awake with a little yelp in the same position as I'd been in my dream.

Nikki stirred behind me and put her arm over my waist. I murmured an apology and told her I'd been dreaming.

"It's okay, I was already awake," she said, "but, I was just thinking, wouldn't it be funny if you turned around and I wasn't here?"

She giggled and the weight from her arm vanished and I had a moment of panic and confusion when I turned around again to an empty bed. I calmed myself down. I'd just woken up, I've heard of weird sleep hallucinations before. Hypnagogic hallucinations? Or maybe those were just when you were falling asleep, there must be a word for when it happens when you wake up? Ugh. Rough start to the day, I thought, while hoisting myself out of bed. 

I shuffled down the hall to the bathroom and heard my wife in the shower. In between scrubbing my teeth, I told her how I hallucinated her while waking up. Nikki popped her head from behind the shower curtain and asked if the hallucination was hot. We laughed and continued on with our day.

Things were normal, then a few nights after the hallucination, I had another weird dream about Nikki. We were in the bathroom and I was getting ready in front of the mirror. She came up and gave me a hug from behind, putting her head on my shoulder. We stayed like this for a short while, an intimate moment, smiling and making eye contact.

At the exact moment I looked away and went back to flossing my teeth, Nikki said, "wouldn't it be funny if my eyes were all fucked up?"

Instinctively my eyes darted towards her reflection and her eyes were absolutely fucked up. She didn't even really have eyes; it looked like her sockets were full of raw hamburger and pus, dripping down her face in clumps.

"Jesus, what the fuck‽" I shouted as I pushed away from her. I turned around and looked at my wife and her eyes looked normal. I looked back at her reflection and it had my wife's eyes again. She began laughing and laughing, her pupils constricting into pinpricks as I felt a new kind of fear stirring in my guts. Something I'd never felt before. I was frozen while Nikki laughed. 

I jolted awake. I was drenched in sweat and felt uncomfortable, inside and out. I checked the time and it was a few minutes before my alarm was set to go off. I got up immediately and went straight into the shower to calm down. My dreams had never been like this before, even as a kid I never had many nightmares. Certainly never anything that made me feel that scared.

The whole experience left me feeling unsettled for the rest of the day. Nikki was her usual bubbly self, yet I found myself anxious about falling asleep for the first time in my life. My fears were unfounded and my sleep went undisturbed the next several nights and I relaxed again, forgetting about those weird ass dreams.

The third dream happened last week. We were standing in the kitchen, Nikki was doing dishes and I was having a snack and talking to her. Her wedding ring slipped off her finger and skittered down the sink.

"Ah, hell," Nikki said, turning off the water and slipping her hand into the drain, her head snapped suddenly to look at me and asked, "wouldn't it be funny if the garbage disposal suddenly turned on?"

As if activated by her musing, the motor under the sink whirred to life and she had this horrifying grin…. I could hear the blades crunching and grinding their way through her flesh and bones. Crimson chunks of viscera began flinging out of the disposal around her wrist. My mind struggled to comprehend what was happening in that moment.

It was one of the most unsettling things I've ever seen. Her expression never faltered for a moment, it was completely maniacal. Neither of us broke eye contact. Her face at that moment would have been disturbing to see in a movie, let alone on my beloved wife.

After several moments, she withdrew her mangled hand from the disposal and held it up like she was waiting for a high five. We both looked at the mutilated remains of the sinew and veins that were once my wife's hand. A finger dangled precariously by a thread of skin. Blood poured down her arm and dripped off her elbow to the floor.

Nikki looked at this carnage and began to laugh like it was the funniest thing she'd ever seen. She turned her gaze back to me and pointed at the injury with her remaining hand, all while she struggled to get a breath in through her laughter. I felt myself wanting to scream, but only being able to get out a whimper. Without even realizing it, my hands began clawing at my cheeks in distress. Animalistic fear took hold of me; perhaps what a small animal feels when it becomes aware of the presence of something very large and dangerous. 

I woke up that morning feeling genuinely disturbed. It felt so real. The textures. The sounds. The way the blood flowed and dripped. It was so vivid. I felt very much like I had actually watched my wife maim herself and laugh like a fucking psychopath while doing it. I shook Nikki awake and forced her to show me her hands. Bemused, she sleepily raised her uninjured fingers from under the blankets and wiggled them for me. Feeling reassured she was actually unharmed, the image of that dangling finger and her pinprick eyes came unbidden to my mind. I raced to the bathroom and vomited. 

That same morning, I made an appointment with my doctor, she was available in a few days. I couldn't understand why I started having these nightmares all of a sudden. I'll admit to being one of those people with a "charmed life" in that I never struggled with any mental illness, I was raised in a happy home, I was financially secure and very happy in my day to day life. I racked my brain trying to think of any new stressors, maybe even subconscious, that would explain this recent string of nightmares. I came up empty.

My appointment with the doctor was this morning. She suggested what I had already been thinking of; stress, anxiety, and maybe diet. She gave me a prescription for some anxiety meds, recommended I take some melatonin, lay off the sugar, and told me to contact her if the nightmares didn't recede in a few weeks, she'd schedule a sleep study. 

Even with the new drugs, I felt anxious about going to bed. Embarrassment flushed my cheeks when I asked Nikki if we could sleep with a nightlight on in the bedroom. She told me to do whatever I needed to feel comfortable and gave me a reassuring hug. I can't believe that was just a few hours ago.

I just had my fourth dream tonight and I am absolutely fucked up over this. In my dream, Nikki and I were sitting on the couch watching TV. We were getting cuddly and things were heating up. She mounted my lap. It felt so real and it felt so good having her weight on me like that. She kissed me deeply and pulled back, looking at me and smiling coyly. Before I knew what was happening, she had taken my wrists in her hands and pinned my arms to the back of the couch.

"Wouldn't it be funny if your wife has been gone for weeks and I've been wielding her corporeal form to feast on your fear while you sleep?" Nikki asked, her voice warping and deepening.

I turned my head and I watched her fingertips grow like vines, clamping around my wrists, and root themselves into the back of the sofa, locking me under her. Any feelings of sensuality having her on top of me evaporated instantaneously and I began struggling mindlessly, my legs flailing as I muttered incomprehensibly. I weighed almost twice as much as her and I couldn't budge her. My mind flashed to an image of a fox chewing its leg off to get out of a trap.

Nikki's eyes didn't look right. The whites looked tan and shot with blood. Her mouth opened wide and came down forcefully onto my face. I felt her tear and gnaw my nose, ripping it off. Pain erupted over my face, my legs flipped over the coffee table as they mindlessly pinwheeled, desperate to free myself. She flung her head back, flipping her hair, a look of ecstasy on her bloodied face as I heard her crunch and chew my cartilage and skin. I began to cry and tasted the blood streaming into my open mouth as I screamed. I was going to die. Panic overrode everything else. I became fear incarnate.

Mercifully, I woke up shortly after she finished swallowing my nose and just as she loomed over me, mouth wide, ready to take a second bite. 

Gratitude for the comforting glow of the nightlight evaporated when I opened my eyes to find Nikki inches from my face. Pupils so tight it looked like her eye was entirely iris.

I genuinely screamed and pushed her away from me, launching myself onto the floor. I landed with a painful thud. She certainly hadn't felt like a hallucination. Nikki looked at me sprawled out on the floor, laughing quietly as she rolled back over to her side of the bed and appeared to fall asleep. My heart was hammering, pumping my body full of adrenaline, I was shaking so badly, I almost fell getting up off the floor. I scrambled and grabbed my phone and some jeans out of my hamper and awkwardly got dressed while rushing down the hall. 

Grabbing my keys, I fled the house and sat in my car parked in the driveway with the doors locked, occasionally rubbing my nose to reassure myself my face was whole. I cried. I hadn't cried since my grandma died eight years ago, yet here I was, absolutely falling apart over a few bad dreams. But I was so scared. There was a quality to the dreams, they felt hyper real. Every texture, every detail… And why the fuck did I just wake up with Nikki inches from my face with her eyes like that? Even on drugs, I don't think a person's eyes could look like solid iris.

I had been out there for a while, it was almost midnight. I watched as room by room, lights turned on around the house. My phone began to ring. Nikki was looking for me.

I turned the GPS off on my phone and drove to a random McDonald's a town over. I've been sitting here in the parking lot for hours, trying to figure out what's happening and I honestly don't know. I can't tell if it is her or if it is me. If it is her, I don't know when she changed, nothing seemed amiss with her before tonight, except for the dreams.

I drank some coffee, but I'm getting so tired and I'm terrified to fall asleep…

I'm so afraid I'll see Nikki in my dreams again, yet I'm even more afraid of seeing her when I wake up.
