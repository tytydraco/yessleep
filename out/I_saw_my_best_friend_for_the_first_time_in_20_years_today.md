This morning, I got a knock at my door. I was busy making myself a breakfast in the form of one full egg when, *again*, I got a knock at my door. I didn’t answer it until I finished said egg, which I had been close to doing when, *once again*, I got a knock at my door. 

I shifted the egg onto a plate and then ran to that door, just as whoever was outside prepared to knock again, and opened it to the sight of 



My best friend. 

He didn’t look anything like my best friend. My best friend was a chubby Asian-American five year old who wore his favorite striped tee more than he tied his own shoes. The guy I was staring at was a handsome, tall dude with shiny raven hair that smoothened out near his sharp, hairless jawline, and wore a clean suit with a nice gold necklace.

Also Asian-American. 

But it was only when this man opened his mouth, gaze locking nervously onto mine, that I realized exactly who this was.



“Hey, dude! How’s it been?”

I was too stunned to speak. Before I could speak, he’d already pushed his way past me, slamming my door behind him without even a glance back. “Um… I…” I stammered, *kinda*, and I say kinda because I honestly couldn’t even hear myself. “…Is that really you?”

*(I said his name here, too, but it’s not something worth repeating.)*

“Huh? What do you think?” He responded with the same kind of confidence he’d walked in with, already having seated himself at the table I often spent hours alone at. “Of course it’s me. And look at you, man! You’ve changed a *LOT*.”

“Not as much as you have,” I mumbled quietly, looking down at my feet. Outside the door I heard footsteps come to a halt. “I had no idea you even *remembered* me after all this time.”

“Why would I *ever* wanna forget my best friend?” He asked incredulously, holding his arms out and grinning at me. Almost as quickly, he sat upright and gestured to the empty seat in front of him, a seat that, when it was just me, was commonly left unfilled. “Here, dude! Come sit with me! Were you making breakfast when I came in?”

“Mhm. I…” I didn’t finish that sentence. I instead wrongly thought I’d left the food on the stove, *which I hadn’t.* I then brought it out and set it down on a plate. “…there it is.”

“Woah!” He yelped, looking at me. “*Dude*. That’s such a small breakfast.”

“Th—Then you just have it all, then.”

“Seriously?”

The sudden perkiness in his voice caught me off guard, making me stammer incoherently. I was still in shock that I was even speaking to him at all. “*Uh*— I— *Ah… Y—Yeah.* Yeah… you can have it.”

“But you’re…”

I think he knew that I already knew the words about to come from his mouth. I hid my hands slightly under the table. 

“…Can I actually have it?” He asked again, leaning forward a little. “Like, *you’re not fucking with me?*”

“I’m not.”

“Sweet!” He pulled the plate in front of him and dug in. He was finished in about five seconds. “That was really good, man.”

“I’m glad,” I said, finally sitting down. I still kept my hands out of view from his gaze, *since I could tell that he was trying to discern how prominent my knuckles were.* “But I wanna talk now.”

“About what?” He asked, still trying to chew.

“About you! I haven’t seen you in so long.” I took a second to fix how I was sitting. “I… I just wanna catch up. How’ve you been?”

My friend’s expression briefly went completely blank, before returning just as instantly to abashed excitement. “Oh, you wanna know how I’ve been? I’ve been… *ah*, actually…” he adjusted the cuff of one of his sleeves. “…I’ve been great! I mean, I’m seeing you today, so it’s already a 9/10 day for me, and I just ate a nice egg, so *now it’s a perfect 10.*”

He was the only guy I knew who could say something so stupid and make it sound charming. “I’m glad me and my eggs have made your day,” I groaned, smiling at him. “…Um, hey. By the way, where’d you get that necklace from?”

I hadn’t stopped focusing on it since he walked in. My friend looked down a little, before touching the necklace with his fingertips. “This?”

“Yeah! Where’d you get it?”

I only realized after my words left my lips that when he touched a certain part of his neck accidentally, he winced. This was because it was bruised. 

“Oh! Where I got this from… *um*…” he thought for a moment, his brows furrowing. “I…” his gaze fleeted to somewhere behind me (I would later realize he was looking at the window on my front door) “…got it from a friend\~”

I raised a brow. “What friend?”

“A friend.”

“What’s their name.”

“I don’t remember,” he shrugged, grinning at me and flattening down his necklace, touching that sensitive spot on his neck yet again. “It was so long ago I really can’t tell you their name. I— oh!” He realized that the cuff of his sleeve had ridden down his arm a little, and he quickly pulled it back up. “Sorry.”

“About what?”

“Dunno.”

I frowned.

“Did they get you that suit you’re wearing, too?”

He wore a nice, clean, open velvet suit jacket with a black button top underneath, with the collar popped and an excessive bit of skin exposed. He froze up a little.

“Oh, yeah! Or… wait, no! Sorry! Didn’t register your question,” he laughed casually, leaning back a little. Once again, his eyes fled behind me. “I, um… someone bought this for me. With my— *Ahem*,” he cleared his throat dramatically, clearly trying to get a laugh out of me. “With *their* money, for *my*… birthday. *Last year!*”

“Oh?” I said, my eyes widening. “That was nice of them.”

“Mhm! It was,” he nodded, crossing his arms. “It feels super comfy, too.”

“I’m glad.”

Him crossing his arms made his one sleeve ride partially down his lower arm. There were track marks on his wrist.

“Hey, I’m… uh,” I swallowed, sitting up straight. “I’m sorry about your parents, man.”

“…Huh?” For the first time in this entire conversation, something my friend said seemed natural.

I looked up at him. “You didn’t hear?” 

“Hear what?”

“They died.”



His face fell into that blank expression that it’d taken on earlier, except now there was no other emotion to filter over it.

“They, um, died last year…” I continued, clearing my throat. “Or, your— your mother did. Your dad died a few years back… your mother lived alone after that, so for a while I’d always show up to her house to bring her things.” His gaze began to fall to the plate in front of him. “Spend time with her, you know. Just trying to be nice to her since she knew it wouldn’t be long before she… well, followed after him. I went to her funeral when she passed, and I remember one of the last things she ever did was try and reopen your ca…”



I paused. For the first time, I paused. And I remembered. I remembered why I’d been in such a shock this entire conversation. Why I hadn’t seen my friend in 20 years.

  


…Because *no one had seen him in 20 years.*



When we were both five, we’d been playing in his backyard during the summer. He had his favorite toy truck in his hands when all of a sudden, I spun around and when I met my starting point he wasn’t there anymore. He wasn’t there anymore. 

A couple of days later some other neighborhood kid stumbled across a dirty striped t-shirt and a pair of khaki shorts that had small bits of blood inside of it. It was the things he’d worn that day.

Even his favorite truck was there, surprisingly untouched outside of the dirt from the field it’d been tossed in. 

The case wouldn’t stay open for long. No one had even seen anything when it happened. His across-the-street neighbors were watering their plants, backs to us. His parents were inside making us lunch. His next door neighbors were out at the grocery store. It had just been him and I, and *I’d spun too quickly in that game we were playing as kids.* I’d missed my best friend.



“I…”

The shaky voice of my friend re-alerted me that he was, in fact, still present with me. I looked up to see him staring at the table, one fist on it. Eyes beginning to well. “I knew that,” he whispered, smiling ruefully. He tried to blink out the tears, and

**Blink. Blink. Blink.** 

**Blink.** 

**Blink.** 

**Blink.** 

**Blink. Blink. Blink.** 

Each time he blinked his eyes darted to me. Darted to me, and the window behind me.

“*Okay*,” I stood up suddenly, an action which both rose up my voice and startled him in an uncharacteristic manner. “You know, dude… do you wanna…?”

I saw the look in his eyes, and I lowered my tone. 

“…*Stay in my house tonight?*” 

His voice was weak now. “…Is that okay?”

“Well, I’m the one suggesting it, so,” I replied, shrugging, a fake smile on my face. “*I’d* say it’s okay.”

His face crumpled. His eyes lingered on my front door for the longest time right then, before…

“…Alright, then! Cool!” He cried, beaming at me as he shot up to his feet, stretching with a yawn. Tears began rolling down his slim cheeks. “Sorry I didn’t bring anything over… *that’ll* be gross if I try and brush my teeth or something, right? Ah, I can probably just wear this shit again tomorrow, though, *right?*” He laughed, before turning back to me. “Hey, are the bedrooms upstairs, or—?”

“They’re down the hall,” I replied, pointing as I sat back down. 

“*Oh!* M—My bad… sorry!” He whimpered gently, his voice beginning to break as his walking pace quickened, him trying to get down the hall as fast as possible before I could hear the now racking sobs coming out of him too clearly.

I folded my hands beneath my chin. Down the hall, I heard a door slam shut. And I looked over at my front door, out the window.

  


The only thing that returned my gaze, was a pair of eyes belonging to the face of a man I did not know.
