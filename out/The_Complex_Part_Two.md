Hell is where Hell has always been.

I won't make note of my daily life in between these dreams unless something of particular importance to my experience occurs. After the first dream, I was a bit weirded out, but it didn't strike me as that strange, beyond the fact that I remembered so vividly the events that took place. Looking back, I only think of these events as dreams because of how bizarre they are, but I can recall them as clearly as I could any real-life event. It wasn't until the second dream that I suspected these as being something more. I apologize for this brief intermission, but I feel like it's important to establish a timeline, of sorts, in order to keep track of the events as they occur. Regardless, I will now continue with the second dream.

I wake up in the elevator. The elevator is still the same as I remembered, but now some of the tape holding up the tarp has begun to peel off, and a thin layer of dust has accumulated on the walls and floor. I'm wearing the same outfit as I was in the previous dream, a blue hoodie, white t-shirt, blue jeans, with grey and white sneakers. I didn't make note of it before, as it was simply the outfit that I was wearing that day. Now, though, it's almost as if I'm resuming the continuity of the dream, and not my day to day life, as this was not the outfit I was wearing during the day before heading to bed. There is still no music, and now the electronic voice, somehow, sounds even more distorted than before. I can't make out which floor it dropped me off this time, but it has to be a different one than before. I say that because where last time I was in a looping office setting, now the environment appeared to be a classroom setting. Specifically, an elementary school classroom, though larger than one might be used to. Inside this classroom, there are about thirty desks lined up five by six, what would be the teacher's desk near the front of the room with an enormous whiteboard behind it. On the whiteboard, some colorful paper cutouts of the alphabet are arranged in a straight line at the top, and some basic math problems are written in marker. I almost get a headache looking at the writing, as the math problems seem to be written randomly with no real semblance of organization. On the wall to my left, there are several photos of supposed staff members. I recognize them as the same people from the portraits in the office. Once again, the clocks on the wall freeze when I look at them, but at the moment the time reads 12:18. 

"Everyone must be out to lunch." I mutter to myself in a half-hearted attempt at some levity. The ambience this time can best be described as what you'd expect to hear in a classroom. The sound of markers on whiteboards, pencils on paper, zippers on backpacks, and the unintelligible whispers of children somewhat quietly fill the air. Something about this setting immediately feels off to me. This classroom is huge. It's far too large to be your average classroom. Something was nagging me in the back of my mind. I rack my brain, attempting to figure out what's bothering me, when it hits me. The desks are in the exact same configuration as the desks within the cubicles. Thirty desks, spaced evenly apart across a neat 5 x 6 grid. I didn't even need to look to figure out that the door in the front-right corner will lead into the hallway again. 

I close my eyes and take a deep breath. "Okay. Let's get this over with." I say to myself, out loud for some reason. Part of me, deep down, must have wanted to break the silence by any means. I've only been here for a few minutes, and I already feel like I'm losing my mind. As I approach the door, I can barely see through the small square of safety glass what appears to be the shadow people again. A major difference, this time around, is that they appeared to be of several varying sizes. If I were to guess, whatever these entities are, they appear to be mimicking children of various ages as well as a handful of adult caretakers. As I make my way down the hallway, I turn to my left to look out that same familiar window that looks out to the parking lot. It's nearly the exact same image except for two major details. The thick fog that sits within the tree line had turned a light shade of pink. If my stomach wasn't currently churning with a near-crippling sense of anxiety, I'd almost say this image was beautiful. The other detail that I should have noticed immediately is that there are now a single car parked outside. I didn't like the implications of that.

After a short while, I snap back into my senses before pressing on again. As I turn right to head around the corner, I find myself pausing to collect my thoughts. I stare at the door that I know will lead me back to the classroom that I was just in. Though the dimensions of this building don't make any sense, it's clear that I'm walking in a loop. To what end, I'm not sure. My last dream ended semi-abruptly at about the third loop. I steady the shaking of my hand as I grip that cold doorknob. My expectations are met as I find myself back at the starting point of today's adventure. I survey the classroom once again to see if it's exactly the same as the previous room, like the last dream. A sense of calm washes over me as I confirm this to be the case. I really must be losing my mind. I glance up at the clock. The time reads 12:27, same as before. If this dream is consistent with the last one, that means that I'll be waking up soon. I turn around to check the way I came to confirm that the door was missing again, and I'm nearly frozen solid. The door didn't disappear this time. I can practically taste my heartbeat as the ambience is drowned out nearly entirely by the sound of my heavy breathing. It looks like the door I just walked through, but something about it was off. If I didn't know any better, I could have sworn that I heard screaming on the other end. Slowly and shakily, I open the door only to wake up in my bed. The dream was over.

I snap awake in my bed, covered in sweat. This feeling is much worse than last time. I feel like I'm having a heart attack, and I can barely breathe. I check my phone. The time is 12:18 PM and I have 30 unread text messages including one from Alice. 

"Hey, honey. You looked like you were having a nightmare, but no matter how hard I tried, you wouldn't wake up. I called Jill and told her that you wouldn't be coming in tonight, but she said she wanted to talk to you personally, so sorry for any unwanted texts or calls you might get. The kids are already at school and taken care of. Try and enjoy your day off and get some rest. I know how hard you've been working lately. I'll see you tonight. Let me know what you want for dinner at some point today. I love you." 

I'm a lucky man. I walk over to the kitchen in order to make some coffee that I can use to choke down some pain medication for my splitting headache. I flip on the TV and turn it to the local news. It's part of my daily morning ritual, even if it is coming late today. There's not much going on besides the weather and sports highlights. I do, however, notice the text scrolling at the bottom of the screen talking about something that likely covered this morning that I missed. A local housewife by the name of Lisa Dunham is missing. I make note of it before sitting laying down on the couch and falling back asleep. No dream this time. The kids stroll through the door at 2:28 and my wife later at 7:23. I find myself paying more attention to what time things happen. It was a quiet evening. Just the way I like it. I tell my wife about my two dreams, but she doesn't seem to make much of them. She recommends seeking a therapist if the problem persists. It's not bad advice. After tucking my kids in bed and kissing sleeping Alice's forehead, I head to bed myself around 11:19. Then it happens again.
