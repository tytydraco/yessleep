It was time for the prodigal son to come home.

Though it remained unfinished, the unholy ecstasy of the Zero Point ritual still clung to me. Its weight was not mine alone — it pressed with apocalyptic consequence, rippling through flesh, time, and dream alike.

I needed to get away from st. Pete.

Back home.
Down the Old Wolf Road.
Into the embrace of the holy rowans.

The moldy walls of my haunted residence would surely protect me from the reverberations of my esoteric misdeeds — the crimes I had committed under the influence of the unspeakable presence I had encountered during the descent through the 9 Delusions.

My mentor and friend, Sergio Fulceri, stood beside the Land Rover I had boarded. Disappointment and amusement oozed from him. And perhaps something more tender — it was hard to tell.

“Thanks for everything, Sergio. Sorry if I failed you,” I said. I slid behind the Rover’s wheel. The engine started at once, more smoothly than usual, its voice strong and steady.

“You could never fail me, my cherub,” he said with a faint smile.

“Misbehave, buddy,” I called, shifting the gear.

“Sheṃ HaMephorash,” Sergio answered gravely, raising index finger and little finger in benediction. “Make your journey under the wings of the Void.”


It felt good to be moving again. I’ve always loved the road. As I curved out of St. Petersburg, its endless suburbs falling behind, I felt like an Aquarian-age trucker — a shaman of the highway, riding in my fire machine.

The Rover soothed me. That cabin was familiar, safe. In it I had wept and laughed. Masturbated. Sometimes all of it at once.

For the first time in a long while, I felt happy. A freedom verging on euphoria surged through me.

I decided to take Sergio’s advice and celebrate my new chapter with a protective intoxication. I reached into the glovebox, pulled out a half-empty Southern Comfort, uncapped it, and breathed its demon-sweet perfume.

The decision strutted into the arena. Alcoholism rose in its imperial box, applauding with a standing ovation.

I drank greedily. Later, when the bottle was gone, I softened the disappointment with Sergio’s cocktail — a monstrous psychoactive brew of occult origin, laced with strange steroids looted from the Russian army.

I stroked the leather wheel. Relaxed.

It was time to let my heightened senses crawl into the Rover’s hidden, intimate crevices.

Energy flowed into me from its engine. I felt the rhythm of oil and fuel, the pistons syncing closer and closer with the cycle of my own Qi, like college girls aligning their periods in the thick hormonal miasma of a dormitory.

Chemicals, sexual energy, and diesel combusted together — in my kundalini chamber, in the Rover’s cylinders.

Why not? For once, life was good.


I reached the border at Torfyanovka, racing the dusk.

On the Russian side, I queued up, tense about my suspicious cargo. The contraband tincture burned in my pocket — above all its strange steroids, sure to raise questions if the pigs sniffed too deeply at my forbidden truffles.

Not to mention questions about General Zhukov’s ghastly metamorphosis.
And my role in it.

A guard walked out briskly, tablet in hand, muttering into his radio. He came straight to me, looked hard into my eyes, then gestured me into an open lane, waving me past the line. He walked beside my Rover to the barrier, which lifted as we approached.

I stopped, handed him my passport. He shook his head, snapped to attention, saluted, and waved me through into Finland.

Two more officers stepped out and greeted me with the same solemn salute.

I grinned drunkenly as I rolled past them. Triumphant. Godlike.

Why had I denied myself this divine comfort so long, through everything I’d suffered?


But on the Finnish side, the queue crawled.
The shadows grew taller.

No salutes this time. Just stares. Suspicious. Impolite.

My euphoria drained away. The tension roared back.

They’d catch me. Lock me away. Submit me to humiliating examinations, obscene probings, and surgical desecrations until—

“Hello? Anybody home? Do you speak Finnish?”

A sharp voice at my window. Custons officer. Unyielding stance. Deodorant smelling like burning books.

“W-what?”

“I asked if you have anything to declare. Have you been drinking?”

“Sorry. Lost in thought. Nothing to declare. Just.. going home.”

He studied me suspiciously for a long moment, his eyes narrowing.
“We shall see about that,” he muttered at last. Then he gestured toward the customs bay.

I rolled forward, terror and paranoia mounting. The intoxication was souring into nausea. Panic swelled as I shut off the engine, clutched the wheel, hyperventilating.

That last swig of Sergio’s tincture was surging through me.
And something else came with it.

The sinking feeling i had learned to fear hit.

I tore my hands from the wheel and stared. White, smoky tendrils hovered over my palms, writhing hypnotically, like sperm in bath water.

I jammed them between my thighs to hide them.

Low vibrations pulsed through the seat, into my feet — as if, in the under-realm, the blind idiot god was blowing a vast alpine horn.

The melody was so simple, so dull… yet incomprehensibly complex.

(Pedal to the metal, bitch.)

The whisper came in my head. Hoarse. Sexless.

I flinched, looked around. No one in the cabin but me. A camouflaged guard outside pointed toward my Rover as he spoke with customs men.

(Do it. Now. Push it. Harder.)

It was then I realized — it was either the Rover speaking, or me speaking on its behalf. Both possibilities terrified me.

“Hush, hush, you idiot,” I whispered toward the radio, as if better reception might somehow make the rover listen to reason. “They’ll hear us…”

(Step on it, you chicken-shit. Crush those insects. Ride me into oblivion, baby.)

“Shut the fuck up!” I screamed, voice cracking into madness. A giggle slipped out right after, half panic, half hysteria.

The customs officer froze at my door. His mouth opened, his eyes narrowing.

“Jesus… what’s wrong with you? Please step out of the car so we can—”

I cut him with my sweetest, most conciliatory smile — lupine, stretched impossibly wide, showing way too many teeth.

It hooked into his collapsing mind like a barbed lure.

The horn blared again, from the netherworld.
And this time he heard it too.

His eyes widened in horror as mine shone with lunatic joy.

He seemed to try to speak, but only the whimper of an infant escaped.

His gaze slid past me to the Rover’s passenger seat — where, to the rhythm of the cacophonous vibrations, an interdimensional tragedy was unfolding.

He watched it with the whites of his upturned eyes.

He wet himself, staring past me — then shrieked tuneless glossolalia, jammed his pistol into his mouth, and fired.


The Rover did not wait.
The engine roared to life by itself.
The barrier lifted.
We rolled forward into Finland.

I folded into the seat like a child, thumb in my mouth, while the possessed Land Rover drove us through to the other side.

Behind us, darkness descended upon the checkpoint — screams, gunfire, a naked woman running, clawing herself bloody as foul mist and stench rose into the air.

The veil of the underverse was thin as gauze, in places already torn.

It was the last day of October. Samhain.

And the dead were watching, writhing in shame for their deranged sons and fallen daughters.

It was good to be home.
