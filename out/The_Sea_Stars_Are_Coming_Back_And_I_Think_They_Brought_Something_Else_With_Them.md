Last night I went out to the beach to document the mass return of a nearly extinct sea star species. I would like to say that I did it for science, but part of me did it for love. There’s a guy in my marine biology class. His name’s Mike, and two nights ago we discovered the tide pool full of sunflower sea stars.

This was strange for two reasons. First, ten years ago Sea Star Wasting Syndrome wiped out over ninety percent of the sunflower sea stars living near Whidbey Island. Lesions formed on the sea stars, their arms twisted and fell off, and their entire bodies rotted into nothing. They’ve been struggling to regain lost ground ever since.

Second, this specific tide pool wasn’t here last week, and it certainly wasn’t full of mature sea stars.

Mike had been eager to investigate further. “Let’s go back tonight,” he whispered in class the morning after we saw them for the first time.

“You’re not going to tell Doctor Graff?” Even as I said it, I had a feeling Mike was right. Our ragged professor stood with his back to the classroom, scratching out a ridiculously long URL on the chalkboard. He refused to start a class text chain. Several of us have practically begged him. 

“Let’s get the photos first. That way we can bring proof,” Mike said. He didn’t have to convince me further. 

We decided that we would go that night, after dark. I thought going at night was a little strange, but Mike was insistent. He swore it was so that no one would see us and steal our thunder. I wanted to believe it had more to do with being alone late at night, looking up at the stars in the sky and down at the stars in the tide pool. Either way, we made plans to meet at the tide pool at low tide—just after midnight.

As I walked along the shore, my boots left glowing blue prints in the gelatinous sand behind me. The bioluminescence was strong tonight. I wondered if all of those plankton minded the disruption. They probably minded a lot. I would be upset if some massive eldritch creature came stomping through my home in the middle of the night.

I kept an eye out for Mike. He was hard to miss, even in the dark. Tall and imposing, he tended to wear a lot of neon, like he was fighting back agains the dreary and drab coastal landscape. I expected to spot him almost as soon as I rounded the corner of the cove. Instead, the beach was empty.

Still, I kept going. He must be running late. I climbed over the rocks above the tide pools, scraping my hands against barnacles. I had no doubt we would get some good photos tonight—unless of course the ghostly tide pool had vanished as suddenly as it appeared.

As I reached the rocky ground at the far end of the beach, I began to pick my way across the barnacle-encrusted seascape. The jagged white shell provided good traction, but it didn’t cover the entire rock face. In the moonlight, it was hard to tell which patches of rock were safe, and which were slick with seaweed and the slime of decomposing jellyfish. 

Something caught my eye. A long, white objected jutted up out of the sand. Was that a bone, picked clean and washed smooth by the tides? No. It had to be driftwood. I let myself believe it was driftwood.

My adventurous streak was already waning.

Where was Mike? 

Half walking, half crawling so I could keep my balance, I climbed over the hump of the last rock and looked down at the water below. At first, the glare from the moon on the water was too bright, and I couldn’t see anything below the reflective surface. I turned on my flashlight. The beam cut through the water, revealing what had to be thousands of sea stars clustered together like gems. It reminded me of fishbowl filled with those rainbow-colored flat marbles. It looked too perfect to be real. 

As my flashlight passed along the pool, something shifted in the shadows just outside of the beam. I hesitated. I can’t explain the feeling that came over me, but something told me I didn’t want to look. Something told me I that this place had secrets I didn’t want to discover. I forced myself to look anyway.

My beam crossed something odd waving in the darkness. At first I thought it was a plant, or maybe a piece of caution tape left over from the over-zealous biologists. Only when I moved the beam further did I realize what I was looking at. An enormous sea star sat flopped over the edge of the rock, half in the water, half out. From tip-of-arm to tip-of-arm, he must be at least as long as I was tall. Though he appeared to be reclining against the rock, three of his arms caressed the air, waving in the wind as if he was trying to taste the breeze. 

Something inside of my froze. Sea stars are notoriously slow movers, even when fully submerged. Even so, this one was so big. I imagined him crossing the distance and wrapping me in his cold grasp, and the thought made me want to throw up.

It was a stupid thought, born of too many horror movies.

Still, sweat mixed with the sea mist prickled along my neck. 

Across the pool, the sea star raised a fourth arm, and I couldn’t help but think it looked alert and fully intelligent.

Story fragments and memories of rumors began to seep into my mind. You hear things in a town like this. The guy who runs the cafe with the good clam chowder whispers things that I would rather not know. The kids at the college tell stories about the ocean—stories that I have studiously ignored until now.

As I stood there in the depths of the night with only the moon and the unearthly blue glow of the water to guide my way, the stories came rushing back to me.

Stories about sudden sinkholes and missing pets. Stories about the sand and water quivering beneath your feet. Stories about driftwood that bears an uncanny resemblance to bone. There were other stories, too. Stories about what happens to people who turn their backs on the ocean.

I couldn’t take my eyes off of the sea star. Could it see me? Could it sense me?

I had no way of knowing. I stood there, hesitant to breathe, hoping it couldn’t feel my heart beating down through my feet and up through the sand.

It raised a fifth arm, and this one snaked toward me, exploratory.

My legs were cramping from the awkward way I was holding myself, extended across the rocks. My hand hurt from where the barnacles pressed into my palm skin. I couldn’t stay still forever.

I felt my legs begin to shake. The beam of my flashlight wavered as my arm grew tired.

I worried that the monster of a sea star would notice and respond, but he didn’t. He just waited there as my hand grew numb. I felt something warm seeping down from my hand. I looked down and watched as blood dripped down into the pool. I couldn’t hold my hand there any longer. I lowered the light and used that hand to push myself away from the rock. My bloodied hand shook, and when I looked down at it, a wave of nausea washed over me at the sight of the black goo pulsing down from my hand. It seemed like too much blood. I wondered what had 

I didn’t dwell on it. Instead, I aimed my flashlight back at the monster sea star at the edge of the pool. There he was, unconcerned. I thought he looked like he was made of rock, and somehow the idea of that scared me more than anything so far. 

I wanted to turn and run back along the coast—to feel the calm of the packed sand under my feet and the desperation of the ocean breeze—but I had come here for a reason.  

Where was Mike?

I seriously considered turning and leaving. If Mike was going stand me up, then I was under no obligation to wait. 

Then I paused. 

I remembered all the other times Mike had showed up. How he had put my name on a group project even though I had been too sick to work on it, and how many times he had arrived with an extra coffee or bagel to Monday morning marine biology. I had to believe there was a good reason he hadn’t made it tonight—and I knew that if our positions were reversed, he wouldn’t abandon the project. He would get the proof I needed.

So I pulled out my phone, stared down the monster sea star, and tentatively snapped the first photo. The creature’s arms blurred in the photo, a testament to how they swayed.

I looked up to make sure that the monster sea star hadn’t moved. He hadn’t. I wasn’t sure what I was expecting. 

I took a few more pictures, feeling the fear melt away as I did. The sea star was kind of beautiful, despite my initial impressions.

After a moment, I took a break to examine my pictures. Night mode had become increasingly impressive in recent years, but it still wasn’t everything it could be. The photos were still grainy, and there was a level of distortion to them—things that I couldn’t see with my naked eye appeared clearly in the photos, like the aurora borealis from earlier in the year.

Something in one of the photos caught my eye. Beneath the surface of the water, deep in the pool, a streak of silver led from the sea star’s arm down into the rock. I squinted at the phone, trying to determine what I was looking at. The feathered silver light was hard to define. 

I looked up at the tide pool again, and this time, when I squinted hard against the glow of the moon, I saw it. I saw the long silver thread, delicate and bright, leading from the sea star down into the sand and pebbles below. 

At first I thought it could be some remanent of the bioluminescence, but when I looked closer, I realized the monster sea star wasn’t alone. The other sea stars, all of them much smaller, some of them sporting only five or six arms, had the threads, too.

I didn’t look away from the giant as I eased closer to the pool. I took a video as I leaned over the water, and this time, the silver cords were even clearer. There was something monumental happening here, and not just from a scientific standpoint. This felt like something hallowed. 

The water rippled with the breeze, and I took a few more pictures.

Normally I wouldn’t have dreamed of sticking my hand in a tide pool like this partly because I hate the cold slime and sticky tendrils of things that live in the ocean, and partly because these pools are delicate ecosystems. I can practically hear Doctor Graff yelling at us to keep our hands out of the water. 

Still, this was an unusual situation. I needed to know what I was dealing with. 

There was something else, too, though I didn’t want to acknowledge it. There was a pull. A call. A need. 

I reached down toward the pool. My fingers grazed the surface of the water, and it glowed vibrant blue with the disruption, like glitter swirling downward. A silver cord extended from a young sea star. Its arms were uneven, and I imagined that it pulled away from me as I plucked at the cord. It was surprisingly taut, and it quivered and vibrated like a guitar string as I withdrew my hand. 

I hold still for a moment, hand dangling in the water. Then something like spider webs closed over my hand, and I jerked it out of the pool. My hand glistened in the moonlight. It was covered in hundreds of hairlike silver cords, and when I looked closer, I saw that something was attached to them. Tiny sea star larvae, translucent and barely visible, clung to my skin. They squirmed, and my hand begun to burn. I drug it through the water again, but that only made it worse. More larvae caught. 

In that moment, every conservationist instinct vanished. All I could think about was how to get them off. I wiped the mass against the sand. It rolled up and clumped together like a graveyard of jellyfish parts, and I shuddered as I stared at the pulsating mass.

As I stared, I realized something. It wasn’t just the larvae that were pulsing.

The ground itself was vibrating. 

Deep down, beneath the sand, a rumbling voice rose to my ears. “I know who you are.” The sound was so deep that it hurt my ears. Somehow, even so, it sounded like a woman. 

I whirled around, looking for the source of the voice. I knew I wouldn’t find it. 

When I looked down at the pool again, I saw that the silver cord was quivering even more intensely than when I had first plucked it. The others hummed along with it, reaching down into the sand. Something deep below rumbled. 

I stumbled backward as the pool began to simmer before me. Rocks shifted and water bubbled up from some underground spring. I realized something even worse. The monster sea star from the far end of the pool was gone. 

The water bubbled violently. I watched as it swirled, and the sand gave way. A long shape turned in the water, and as the sand slipped down the sides of it, I saw bright green billowing in the water. I would know that color anywhere. The shape continued to roll. A face emerged from the pool.

I fell backward, landing hard. Barnacles sliced through both of my hands, but I hardly felt them. My mind reeled and a strangled sound escaped my throat. 

Mike lay face up in the pool, eyes closed, a mass of silver cords spilling out froths chest. His arms and legs were twisted strangely, like someone was trying to crumple up a piece of trash. Sand dripped down his face, falling away in chunks. 

“Mike!” I screamed.

Desperation to get to him outweighed my fear. I scrambled over the rock and dropped into the pool. The sand gave way beneath my feet, and before I could react, I was up to my waist in gelatinous sand and water. I flailed, and my hand found driftwood. It was more like a ball of roots, really, but it was entailed in the rock in such a way that I thought it would support my weight. 

The sand beneath my feet shifted again. I reached out, trying to grab Mike’s foot. My hand brushed his toe.

Mike’s mouth opened. The voice that left his mouth didn’t belong to him. “Did you come for me?” It was the woman’s voice again. The beach shook with its cadence. 

I tried to answer, but my voice caught.

“Because I came for you,” the voice said.

What did it mean? Why did something about it feel so familiar—as if the voice had been with me throughout all of my life and I was just now remembering?

The rumbling intensified. I looked around and saw the sand shuddering, cracking apart in chunks. The rocks gave way, and I realized there was something else underneath—something that had been there this whole time. A tentacle rose up from the sand. It lashed into the air, blocking out the moon as water and sand rained down from above. It was then that I recognized her shape buried under the sand, larger than anything I could have imagined. She was all I could see. She was everywhere.

“I’ll be waiting for you,” the voice-that-wasn’t-Mike’s said. 

I had to get to him. We had to get out of here. 

The waves pushed him closer to me. I reached for him, but when my hand found his leg, it felt hot and soupy. My fingers sunk into his flesh. Tendons snapped and his leg stretched like jelly. I let go in shock, on impulse. 

Of course I immediately reached for him again, but it was too late. The water swirled suddenly, flooding up to my neck, and I clamped onto the roots with both hands. Mike was gone before I had time to react, swallowed up by the whirlpool.

“Mike!” I screamed, but I knew it was too late. The whirling water pulled at my legs. I held onto the root, as the water stretched me and pulled me toward the sinkhole. My fingers began to loosen. With whatever strength I had left, I looped my arm through one of the roots and locked it to my side. 

I tried to keep my eyes open. I tried to search for Mike. The icy seawater blast me in the face, burning my eyes and forcing it’s way into my nose and mouth until I couldn’t tell if I was above the water or beneath it. It was all the same. I could taste salt and slimy strings and mold—thick, heavy mold. 

When the water subsided, I shook the ocean out of my eyes and looked around. Everything was gone. The pool had stilled itself, and the water sunk back to my thighs, my knees, my ankles. Mike was gone. When I looked down at the water, I saw the last few sea stars slipping through the sand, anchored by their silver cords. 

I lunged for one, desperate to hold on to anything of Mike.

The thread snapped and I’m left holding a tiny sea star. I stared at it until even the sea star dissolved and slipped through my fingers.



UPDATE:

When I went back the next day, I found a giant sink hole where the tide pool had been. It was as if something massive had suddenly deflated, or perhaps disappeared entirely.

Sometimes, late at night, when I lay in bed, I can still feel the pull. I don’t know where she is. I don’t know where she went when she abandoned the sand beneath the tide pool, sucking Mike and her thousands of children along with her.

But I still hear the call. Did Mike hear it too? I’m afraid that one day, I’ll find myself drawn to her again.
