Since the beginning of this summer, I’ve been periodically seeing a dark figure in my room at night and I don’t only see it when I’m half-awake. A couple months ago my partner and I were laying awake facing each other in bed talking a bit. I heard a noise at the foot of our bed and when I looked there was a tall dark figure standing at the foot of the bed near my partner’s side but facing me. I shot up in the bed and said “who are you!” and my partner quickly turned on the light and it was gone. This terrified me. A few days later my partner brought it up and when we talked about it he said he heard the noise too but he didn’t look at the end of the bed, he was looking at me because of my reaction.

I didn’t want to talk about it because I was getting scared and part of me thought talking about it would make it worse somehow. Last night, we were doing the same thing only this time I was facing away from my partner, facing out into the room. We were talking about theories for the show we are currently watching. My eyes were closed but I was replying to him and happened to open my eyes and I saw a figure crouching down next to my side of the bed as if it were checking to see if I was sleeping. It had a face but I could barely make it out and it was all black, but not like the rest of the room, like a deeper black than anything else. I didn’t react right away, I was trying to make out what I was even seeing this time but then it moved its face closer to me and I gasped and reached for my partner in the bed. I didn’t feel him in the bed so I shouted his name and turned to him and when I looked back the figure was gone. I know this sounds crazy but I swear I wasn’t sleeping either of these times, so I know it wasn’t a half-in/half-out of sleep lucid dream situation. 

I'd like to add that my 15 month old infant has recently started pointing and staring at something behind me when we are alone, though he doesn't seem frightened. This freaks me out. When I’m in the house alone or showering I feel like there is someone there but when I confront it or go looking there’s nothing. Sometimes I catch a glimpse of something out of the corner of my eye and when I do a double-take there’s nothing there. There was a death in my immediate family this past Sunday (24th) but I've been experiencing this since summer.   
  
I only saw it clearly at night these 2 times, but I *feel* it a lot, even during the day. I’m really scared and I don’t know what to do. Is this a sleep demon? Is there a logical explanation? Someone please science the sh\*\* out of this for me because I’m scared to go to sleep.
