This happened in 2019, just before the big fires.

I was working a short contract job as a signal tech for a regional freight line in New South Wales. Most of it was in towns no one’s heard of. Dusty outposts with two pubs, a servo, and a train line that hadn’t seen a passenger in decades. One of those towns was called Nothing. Not kidding. It’s a real place. Tiny dot north of Gulgong, barely a name on a survey map.

My job was simple: check signal integrity on the old Gulgong Ulan spur, particularly near Tunnel 39, an abandoned single track bore that used to cut through a hillside outside of Nothing. The tunnel’s not in use anymore too unstable, according to the company. All traffic was re-routed years ago.

But the weird thing was: someone reported signal flickers and ghost track activity inside the tunnel.

That shouldn’t happen. There’s no power.

I hiked up to Tunnel 39 alone with a meter, radio, and headlamp. The track leading to the tunnel is choked with weeds and rusted solid. You can smell the damp air long before you reach it cold, musty, like old bones left to rot under wet leaves.

The tunnel’s mouth is a perfect black semicircle cut into the rock, lined with cracked bricks and old graffiti tags that barely cling to the surface. It swallows sound. No birds. No wind. You step into it, and the world outside just… disappears.

My meter spiked the second I walked in.

That’s impossible. It’s dead line. No power. No signals. Nothing should be active.

But the needle twitched again. Higher.

Then I heard it: a faint clacking… like metal wheels. On rail.

I spun around. Nothing behind me.

But the noise was coming from inside the tunnel.

I only walked in about ten meters before my headlamp flickered. Batteries were full that morning. I tapped it. It came back on… but only for a second. Then the light snapped off entirely.

I was left in the dark.

But the sound of the train kept getting closer. Not fast. Just a slow, deliberate chug… like an engine that forgot how to be alive.

I backed up, trying not to trip, heart pounding.

That’s when I saw the light.

A dull yellow glow. Not LED. Old filament, like the kind used on steam engines from the 1950s. It was far down the tunnel, bobbing slightly and getting closer.

And underneath it… shadows.

Not one. Not two.

A full train’s worth of figures, pressed up against invisible windows, staring at me with blank, chalk-white faces.

None of them blinked.

I ran. Didn’t stop until I was back on the service quadbike and halfway to Gulgong. I tried radioing HQ, but got nothing but static until I was 10km out.

Later, I asked the old guy at the pub about the tunnel. He paused, looked me dead in the eye, and said:

“Tunnel 39? Mate, they sealed that bastard up in ’78. After a steam engine derailed and trapped 17 people inside. Couldn’t get ‘em out. They just filled it and moved the track.”

“But it’s not sealed,” I said. “I was in it.”

He just stared at me, pale.

“Then whoever, or whatever, you saw down there wasn’t meant to be seen.”

I’ve had nightmares since.
Always the same: I’m standing in the tunnel, frozen, as the ghost train inches closer.
