Something extremely serious happened at my university during exams, and apparently I'm the only one who knows exactly what happened.

For context, I am a 20 and a half year old woman, studying a physics and chemistry degree in the city of Kosciusko, a small town of about 30,000 inhabitants located a few dozen kilometers from Oslo, Norway.

Everything has gone well so far, we have already had our first exams, and despite the anxiety it can create, we have all passed our exams. But since the day of our examinations, on the morning of October 22, an extremely strange series of disappearances has occurred. It started with a student I barely knew, named Max. When I say that this series of disappearances is extremely strange, it is an understatement. In fact, tell yourself that our exams take place under strict conditions, because they count for our grade, this means no mobile phone turned on in the room, invigilators in the corridors, a proctor in the room and forbidden to go out to go to the toilet without supervision under penalty of exclusion. There are also surveillance cameras whose video recordings remain for a week in the university's computer system, according to the guards. And our exam room is located on the 3rd floor of a large building of 7 floors including a basement, so it is not easy to leave without being seen.

What makes it strange, if not literally impossible, is that Max's disappearance took place literally during the exam, in the first hour. Everyone was in exam, Max was in the middle of the front row I think. Except that, during our exams, he disappeared, leaving all his belongings behind, his copies, his pen, etc., and without anyone apparently noticing him for 15 minutes. When I say that no one noticed, it is because apparently no one seems to have seen, heard or felt him pass, or even open the door, on the 45 students and the two supervisors in the room. And the only clues are scratch marks on his table and on the floor.

But I noticed something strange on my copy: it looked crossed out, I was writing the following sentence about thirty times: "Amnesia girl it's here" At this point, I must specify that I live with a disorder called ATDS. It is a complex dissociative disorder related to trauma, involving the existence of several distinct personalities in me only present in cases of extreme danger, such as seeing people who have hurt me in the past for example. These identities therefore have their own memory, independent and fragmented in relation to each other. On a daily basis, I don't feel any of this and I function normally, but if I'm in danger, it comes back.

So I put this strangeness down to a dissociative crisis related to the stress of the exam that I would not be aware of, even if it seemed unlikely to me. But I quickly dismissed this hypothesis when my classmate, Manon, who is naturally stressed in exams and hypervigilant, had written exactly the same thing on her paper without realizing it.

Then, on the morning of October 31, we had a new exam, in mathematics. This time, it was Manon who disappeared, while I was next to her. No one seems to have noticed his disappearance, and the same scratch marks were present. When the voluntary disappearance was ruled out because of the scratches and especially the fact that two students had disappeared in less than 10 days, everyone in my class became suspicious, except for me and another student, who was also anxious and hypervigilant, because we had again written "Amnesia girl it's here" about forty times on our sheets in the middle of our pages. equations, so we couldn't have both written this scary sentence and done something to Manon.

But, the reason I'm writing this is much worse. Yesterday, I ran into my main childhood aggressor again in the city center, which triggered my ATDS again, for the first time in the whole year. It must be understood that in this case, the identities appearing in me have independent memories, to which I sometimes have access when they reappear, usually flashbacks of past frightening things, which they keep to themselves. It is a reaction to protect the mind in the face of trauma.

But yesterday, instead of having flashbacks of my abuser for the umpteenth time in a kind of "co-consciousness" between my 7-year-old identity and myself, I had flashbacks from the last exam. I'm starting to review my protective identity trying to hide after I started writing very quickly, way too quickly by the way, the famous scary sentence on my copy, then I saw my little identity arrive, look around, and see what seems to be a little girl, with a white dress and scary eyes. It is impossible to describe it better. I see her kidnap Manon, who is screaming, and Manon then struggles which causes this monster to come out of the clutches of her hands and feet, and injures her severely, leaving traces of blood all along the room.

I then see her drag Manon out of the room. My little identity is in a pattern that paradoxically means that she can put herself in danger instead of having a flight reflex. As a result, I remembered following this girl dragging Manon to the floor, then into the elevator, past the screaming supervisors and dialing the police number and setting off the university alarm. She dragged her to a door, in a basement dating from the 1920s (yes, my university is very old, too old). This basement has been under construction since Monday, October 21, according to the work permit. It is normally inaccessible to students. Fortunately, my protective identity made me leave very quickly when I saw her enter, with Manon still dragged on the ground, and visibly seriously injured.

I came back to the exam room, then I forgot about it when I came to. It's normal for me to forget what we saw identities, but normally I remember that they were present in me after the fact, and normally they leave at least a note signifying their presence and what happened to reassure me, but this was not the case. My last memory, very blurry and distant, is of this girl cleaning up the blood marks on the floor and on the table, and the anxious person in my class writing the famous scary sentence over and over again after seeing this scene.

What prompted me to tell you about it is today's television news, mentioning these disappearances. In this diary, they explained that during the investigation they had found very slight traces of moisture and bleach on the floor in the examination room, which the police did not immediately pay attention to, that they had seen that the emergency numbers were present in the call history of a proctor, and the fact that the university's home automation system recorded that the elevator went down during the exams and that the alarm was triggered, even if no one out of the 700 people present in the building that day seems to have heard the said alarm. This seems to corroborate my memories somewhat.

I don't know what to do. I have been followed by 3 specialized psychologists and a psychiatrist who has also been specialized since I was 17 years old, and I have never had hallucinations and false memories; in reality, ATDS cannot create false memories at all, only fragment them and make them blurry, which makes me think that these memories are probably not simple hallucinations. Paradoxically, it seems that I am the only one who remembers what happened at the last exam, "thanks" to a disorder that causes memory loss. I tell myself that I should go to the police, but I would be taken for a madman I think. Maybe I am after all, no one seems to remember any image similar to my fragmented memories... Do you think I should go to the police and tell them everything? Next Wednesday's exam has been maintained despite all this, and I'm really, really scared.
