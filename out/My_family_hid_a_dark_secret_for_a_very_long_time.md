I’m old by any metric that one would care to think of. Ancient, even. I grew up a very long time ago, when this world was a very different place. And for all the years since, I have been carrying a dark and terrible secret about my family, my birthright.

It takes me a long time to catch up with the modern world. This, in fact, is the first computer I’ve ever had, and the first time I’ve ever accessed the internet, except occasionally at the library. It has taken me many hours to figure out how to write this, and to find a home for my confession.

Allow me to take you back, many years, to when I was a young boy. I grew up deep in the Appalachians, and my whole world was a small farmstead surrounded by mists and towering woods, laid out under a sea of stars that are brighter and colder than any you see today.

My memories of that time remain very clear, tinged as they are with both nostalgia and the undercurrents of a bitter dread. You see, my family was different. We lived so far from civilization, that me and my siblings were raised in this little wooden world, cut off completely from anyone. Except my mother. She was a small, slender, blonde woman, with big happy eyes and a ready smile.

And the thing in the basement.

As kind as my mother was, there was a strict set of rules we lived by. Me, my twin brother, and my little sister. We would have to do chores every morning, feeding the chickens, collecting eggs, milking the cow, and so on. All the little things that keep a farm alive. We never wanted for food, there was always vegetables and butter and lots of fresh meat.

“Waste not, want not.” My mother would say.

It was our family’s mantra. Nothing was wasted. Threadbare hand-me-down clothes would be cut and sewn into handkerchiefs and tablecloths and socks. Animal skins would be treated, turned into leather for gloves and jackets. Any leftover food would become chicken feed or compost.

Looking back, people today would see it as a miserly, destitute existence, but we were rich in our own way. Our mother was warm and loving, always taught us from the bible, or from new books she would bring home.

Occasionally, she would take our horse and cart, leaving in the morning, and returning late at night with flour and books and other products of civilization. There was a town, we knew, a few valleys over, but we were forbidden from ever going.

“It’s dangerous, people ain’t like us, they won’t understand us.” My mother had a hundred such excuses.

But we were good children, raised and reared with care and respect, so we followed our mother’s rules, however grating they seemed.

And the most important rule of all: Never go into the basement.

Because that’s where my father lived.

He was a figure sometimes glimpsed, for his work kept him very busy. He left early, before the sun rose, sometimes seen from the bedroom window, a towering, dark figure striding towards the woods, and he would return long after dark.

In truth, especially when we were young, we were terrified of him. Father was an unknown, a shadowy patron that kept us fed and content, but that we never saw or spoke to. When he returned, sometimes at night we would hear the basement doors open, and soon after, our mother’s screams and howls. Whether it was pleasure or pain I know not, but the discomfort the memory alone arouses tells me it was both at once.

It was how my sister came into the world. I was young, far too young to have a clear recollection, but I remember my mother, pale and shaken and sunken, smiling brightly as she showed me and my brother the baby she held against her breast. She was big and red and had a shock of dark, thick hair.

“Ain’t she wonderful? Ain’t she perfect?” My mother’s voice had pleaded.

There had been so much blood on the sheets, and the coppery smell had held my tongue. Whatever birthing my sister had done, no amount of nightly moaning with my father ever made her pregnant again.

It was watching my sister grow, I realized how different we all are.

Where my mother was fair and fine, we were dark and powerful.

Our hair was black and thick, eyes dark, in complete opposition to her.

By the age of ten, I stood a foot taller than her.

By fourteen, it was more like two. She was a short woman, but her children were freakishly tall.

Even at that age, I was afraid of the basement, and my unseen father.

Every day after chores came a big breakfast. Bacon, sausage, eggs, buttered bread if we had flour, pork chops if we didn’t.

“Waste not, want not.” Mother said. By the time she was ten, my sister, Eve, was taller than her, and she was no dainty lady. Like my brother, Will, she preferred the outdoors to being inside. I never understood it.

Will, as big and swarthy and broad-chested as me, spent his days on the fringe of the woods, with an axe as often as not. He could fell a tree in a single blow, and he reveled in his strength, laughing deeply as he carried around huge logs on his back, and on one memorable occasion lifted our horse, braying and throwing its head, upon his shoulders.

Eve too was strong. Broad and masculine, she collected flowers in the spring, and berries and mushrooms in the winter. She loved trapping, as well, setting up complex snares with rope and rocks, and would gleefully carry home carcasses of deer or even bear, which delivered us from the monotony of endless pork and cabbage.

Our mother was always happy with Eve and Will. The fire roared throughout the long winter, and fresh meat was never wasted.

But it was I that our mother doted on the most.

Where Will and Eve were half-wild, I was reserved and tame. I happily sat with my little mother, helping her sew and cook, reading to her, praying together. Even though I dwarfed her, even though my wrists were thicker than her legs and I could lift her with one hand, I felt safe when I sat before her chair; her voice was a constant comfort, a ray of humanity in our otherwise wild lives.

But behind it all leered the specter of my father. One night when I was around fifteen, Will and I were up late, almost until dawn, looking at the stars and the moon from our window as they lit the mountains. The night smelled of crisp pine and the wood smoke of the hearth.

All seemed well, and the distant voice of my mother echoed from the basement. Then came the deep, booming voice of my father. It sounded good-natured, but I couldn’t make out any words.

“What do you think he’s like?” I asked Will, my thoughts wandering.

He looked at me with his small black eyes shining. “He must be strong.” Came his voice, like gravel and stone. “He hunts every day, and barely rests. Look at how strong we all are.”

I nodded. “But as a person? Do you think he reads? Does he know his prayers?”

Will just grunted, shrugging his big shoulders. He was never one to think much beyond the physical.

Then, the basement doors opened outwards, and the shadow that was my father stepped into the yard. As always, he was only a silhouette against a dark night. I strained, looking as well as I could, and saw his strong, loping stride. He had no hat, carried no weapons, but perhaps he stashed them in the woods. Everything around his shape was tight and strong, as if he were only wearing long-johns. It was true that none of us, his children, were bothered by the cold, by awe was mingled with dread as I understood just how long he spent in the cold valleys, improperly dressed.

As he passed the horse where it was hitched, I realized for the first time the massive size of our father. We sons were nigh-on seven feet tall, Eve was only an inch or two shorter than us.

But our father?

He made the horse look like a dog as he passed it.

Then, he began great, loping strides. Not quite a run, but perhaps a canter, an animalistic undulating rhythm, and in an instant, he passed beyond the property and into the woods, quiet as shadow.

I still could not tell you why, but I was more scared of him then than I had been even as a young boy.

That day, after I awoke and began my chores, things began to change for the worse. My mother was slow to rise, which was unusual. I obviously wouldn’t go into the basement, but I called and called for her, and eventually she came up to the kitchen, a pained smile on her pale face.

“I’m sorry, did you want breakfast? I wasn’t feeling too well this morning.” She said.

But she looked weak, troubled, so I insisted she sat, and set about making the food that morning.

Over the next few days, as the first fingers of autumn crawled down into the valley, she grew worse. A sickness grew in her, and quickly striped her of health and vigor. I was morose, and her feeble attempts to cheer me only made it worse. She sat by the fire, in her usual chair, wrapped in furs and blankets, her tiny hands clasping my giant ones.

“Don’t fret, now, son.” She said quietly as we sat, the newest Twain lying forgotten in my lap.

“What happens if you die, Ma?” I hadn’t wanted to voice my fears, but the words came from my pained throat regardless.

“All will be fine. You can cook, your father can keep getting food, and now Eve and Will are nearly old enough to help. They can provide, and one day, maybe you can find a wife of your own.”

She gave my hand a little shake with what strength she had.

“It will all be well, boy,” she continued, “imagine yourself with one big happy family, here on the farmstead, teaching your own children how to read. Wouldn’t that be grand? You’re a good boy, I know you wouldn’t waste anything.”

But to me, a world without my mother sounded like a life incomplete.

And the worst thing of all, was what would happen when I truly met my father?

Eve and Will and I had often asked, even pestered our mother, throughout our childhood. She’d told us bits and pieces. How he was the best hunter in all America. The time he first met and charmed my mother and stole her away from a cruel and mean family. She had only been young.

And yet, we knew little about the man. She told us he was tall and strong, but that made him no easier to picture than his loping shadow in the false dawn.

She said that he spoke with a deep voice, but so did all her children. We had only truly heard her voice and ours, so it was near impossible to conceive a new sound for this presence in the basement.

As our mother wasted away before our eyes, we were scared. Scared of being alone. Terrified of the man in the basement. Eve and Will spent more and more time outside, pouring their fear and anger into their chores and hobbies. I did what I could, cooking and caring for mother as her breathing came more labored, as she looked more and more tired each day.

They became withdrawn, Eve and Will. They barely came back into the house, save to sleep. Their clothes grew ragged, despite the weak protests of our mother. They looked more and more dirty, more wild.

One day, late in October, as the mountains turned to shades of gold and crimson and the air was filled with the rich earthy smells of autumn, my mother died.

It had come on slowly, over weeks, and yet it still felt too sudden.

If you have ever lost anyone close, you will know the sense of utterly helplessness.

It claws at you from the inside, the rage and guilt that you did not and could not do anything. The stomach-twisting that keeps you stuck in the moment, screaming that you should have done something, anything. And beyond it all is the pain, the hole in your very heart that you know will be empty forever.

She passed easy, sleeping by the hearth. She just closed her eyes, and her breathing grew slower and slower until it stopped all together. I screamed, pounded my fists on the walls until they were bloody. Will ran outside, tearing at trees with his bare hands. Eve screamed and wailed.

How long it lasted I don’t know. Maybe an hour or two until we exhausted ourselves, but what came after was a different kind of hell.

Because our father came out from the basement.

I was by my mother, standing beside the kitchen hearth.

I looked down upon her face, which could have been asleep.

Eve and Will were still somewhere outside.

And I heard footsteps from the basement door.

Loud and echoing, they slapped on stone.

 I was alone. Alone in my home.

I felt the fear, the dread confrontation that was surely about to come, between myself and my unknown father.

The footsteps grew louder, like the pounding of the blood in my ears and the thumping of my heart.

Then all sound stopped, and the basement door swung open.

My books had had illustrations and prints. They had shown me what men were supposed to look like, young and old. In an instant, I understood. Why we lived so separate, why we were not permitted to see our father.

He was not human.

He towered over me, covered in coarse and greasy fur. He had hands like leather shovels, and a face squashed and beastly. His manhood was like a stuffed stocking, hairy and swinging between his tree trunk legs.

He looked over me with eyes like black beads, sniffing the air, taking in the scent of his son.

Eve and Will had come in, standing behind me in stunned silence.

Father looked at all of us, then raised one of his too-long arms, and padded over to where my mother’s body sat in her chair.

Gently, more gently than one could imagine of such a beast, he stroked my mother’s hair. He picked her up, as if she weighed no more than a doll, carrying her in his massive arms back towards the basement.

“Come.” His voice was like thunder and stone, so deep and guttural, as ancient as the mountains themselves. He slinked down the dark steps, and us half-breed children could only follow, descending down into the reeking darkness.

My eyes adjusted, slowly, and I saw the charnel house where my mother had laid with my beastly father each night.

Blankets and skins were piled on hay in one corner, clearly a den for sleeping, yet the rest of basement was a stinking, fetid slaughterhouse. Great, bloody cuts hung from iron hooks, resting and aging. Against the back wall was a stack of cleaned bones and skulls.

Human skulls.

Not only that, but old clothing, torn bags, and rusted rifles were scattered around. Human flesh was stretched on racks, being tanned into the same browned leather that decorated so many of our possessions. I realized pork had been a rarity, not a staple.

We stood quietly, as father gently laid mother out on a table stained black over many years. So delicately, he removed her dress, her stockings, her shoes and her underclothes. My mother lay dead and naked, and the beast tied her ankles with leather cordage. Then, he picked her up once again, taking her to one of the rusted iron hooks that adorned the walls.

I was speechless, terrified, though my siblings, always wilder than I, leaned forward, watching with curiosity and he placed my mother carefully on the spike, dangling upside down, arms hanging crazily, hair running down like gold water.

He’d hung her like a deer for bleeding.

“Waste not, want not.” Was all that the beast said in his inhuman voice.

Wordlessly, he and my siblings took up knives. I could only watch as they descended upon her like vultures.

The performance defies description. It was a nightmare. They cut her throat, allowing her blood to flow across the stones. Eve gutted her, and took my mother’s organs, laying them on the table. My brother cut either side of her womanhood, preparing the legs to be removed like hams.

And my father, the monster. He skinned her, in only a few moments, leaving the fat and flesh of her carcass dangling.

How long I stood and watched that harrowing butchery I do not know. They cleaned her entrails for sausages, took her backstraps and thighs and calves, setting them in salt barrels. They took her tongue. Tongue had always been a treat in our house. Her buttocks were trussed for roasting, and I knew the fatty breasts would be broken down to suet, shoulders would be braised, and her bones boiled for stock.

I do not when I ran, but I did. I ran to my room and slammed the door, a futile attempt to shut out the nightmare world I now knew I inhabited. I cried then, howling like a wolf. The sun set as I cried and shrieked.

Then, in the stillness of the night, I heard the basement doors swing open.

There he was, my father, once more a shadow in the moonlight.

But this time, he was not alone.

They had cast of their clothes, as they had cast off their humanity in the basement. There, hairy, nearly as furry as the beast that was my father, the three of them stood in the night.

Wordlessly, soundlessly, they took in the scents on the autumn air, and they cantered on inhumanly strong legs into the woods. I never saw them again, not with my own eyes.

In a near panic, I gathered would I could from the kitchen and the storeroom, from the bedrooms of Eve and Will. I dared not go down into the basement, even if there were weapons there.

I threw the old saddle, rarely used, on the back of our old draft horse. He was strong. Strong enough to bear even my seven-foot frame. I left in a hurry, determined to leave everything behind. I took the disused trail that lead towards civilization, the one my mother had rode a hundred times to bring me toys and books.

On the last day of October, 1871, I left my family’s house of horrors, never to return.

It has been a very long time, since I last thought of Eve or Will, or my father.

I am still alive, these many years later. I travel often, changing my name, seeing as much of the world as I can, putting oceans between me and Appalachia. Yet people seem interested once again, as they haven’t been in decades.

I must warn you, there are beasts in the woods that prey on the flesh of men, and they should not be trifled with. I know, because they are my family.

They are still out there, somewhere in the woods, I’m certain. Though they haven’t been seen for a long time. Not since 1967, in fact, when some guys, Patterson and someone or other, took a video of one of them.

More than ninety years is a very long time, but I’d recognize my sister [anywhere](http://lknightstories8.wordpress.com/).
