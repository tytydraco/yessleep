It started without warning—one night, the stars simply began to fall. At first, it was subtle, like a few twinkling lights flickering out in the distance. But then they fell, streaking across the sky, one after the other, like drops of rain in a storm. We all stood outside, watching in silence, not understanding what we were witnessing. The stars had always been so far away, untouchable, but now they were coming down to us.

The first one landed somewhere beyond the trees, in the fields just outside town. There was no explosion, no fireball—just a soft, glowing pulse in the distance, almost inviting. People gathered to watch from afar, standing on their porches, whispering to one another, trying to make sense of it.

I was among them. I saw the way the light shimmered in the dark, the way it seemed to beckon.

By the next night, more had fallen. Dozens, maybe hundreds of them, their faint, glowing forms visible just over the horizon. And then came the first person who went too close.

It was Emma from down the street. She was always curious, the type to run toward things most people would run from. We all warned her to stay back, but she wouldn’t listen. She went out into the fields, her flashlight bobbing in the dark as she approached one of the glowing craters. I saw her silhouette disappear over the hill.

She never came back.

The next morning, we found her body, pale and empty, like the life had been sucked right out of her. Her eyes were wide open, staring at the sky, her mouth twisted in a silent scream. And that’s when we realized—these weren’t just stars. They were something else. Something alive.

The Fallen, we called them. No one knew what they were, and no one dared get close enough to find out. From a distance, they looked like shimmering, ethereal beings, their forms flickering in and out of focus as they moved. They didn’t walk, not really. They just *drifted*, hovering just above the ground, always searching for something. Or someone.

The worst part? People started following them.

I don’t know how it began, but soon enough, some of us—neighbors, friends—were disappearing, only to be found wandering after the Fallen like empty vessels. There was no life in their eyes, no soul left behind. They moved in perfect silence, following the glowing beings wherever they went. Worshippers, some called them. Slaves, others said. They didn’t talk, didn’t react. They just walked.

It was on the third night that the Fallen came for us.

I was alone in my house, the curtains drawn tight, every light off. I’d seen them moving through the town earlier, their glowing figures barely visible through the haze of twilight. They didn’t make a sound, but the air around them felt wrong—cold, like all the warmth had been sucked out of the world. And then the hum began.

A low, vibrating hum that grew louder and louder, like electricity crackling in the walls. I felt it deep in my chest, rattling my bones. I knew they were close. Too close. I backed away from the window, my heart pounding, praying they wouldn’t come inside.

But then, the front door creaked open.

I froze.

The air in the room shifted, growing colder by the second. The hum was deafening now, pressing against my skull. Slowly, I turned toward the door. There it was—one of them. A Fallen. Its glowing form flickered in the doorway, hovering just inches above the floor, its head tilted slightly to the side, as if it were looking at me. I couldn’t see its face—there was no face to see—but I *felt* its gaze, cold and hollow.

I backed away, my breath catching in my throat, but the Fallen drifted closer, the hum growing louder with every inch it moved. The air around it seemed to warp, bending in ways that didn’t make sense, and with it came the unmistakable sensation of my strength slipping away, like something was reaching inside me and pulling out my very essence.

I was going to die. Just like Emma.

Suddenly, there was a sharp growl behind me. Max, my German shepherd, lunged from the shadows, his teeth bared, fur bristling. He launched himself at the Fallen with a snarl that echoed through the house. The glow of the Fallen flickered violently, as if Max’s presence disrupted it. For a moment, the hum faltered, the air growing less heavy.

Max circled the Fallen, barking and snapping, keeping it at bay. I took the chance and bolted for the back door, my heart racing. But as I reached the door, I felt it again—the cold, the pull. The Fallen was behind me, its form shimmering brighter now, as if my escape only made it stronger.

With a trembling hand, I threw the door open, Max right behind me, and we ran. Outside, the night was pitch black. No stars, no moon. Just darkness. And in the distance, I could see them—more of the Fallen, drifting silently across the fields, their worshippers trailing behind like shadows.

I didn’t stop running until we reached the woods. Max stayed close, his ears pinned back, growling softly. I collapsed against a tree, my breath ragged, my chest burning. I looked back, but the Fallen hadn’t followed. Not this time.

But they were still out there. Waiting.

The stars had fallen, and the world had changed. There was no going back. No one knew why they had come, or what they wanted. But I knew one thing for sure—they weren’t done. Not by a long shot.

And the next time they came for me, I might not survive.
