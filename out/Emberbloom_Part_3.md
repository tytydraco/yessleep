"Tai Chi? Chloe, what the hell are you talking about?" Maya hissed, her usual composure cracking. "Eddy’s sick, he was burning up all night!"



Chloe just smiled that new, vacant smile. "The body is merely a vessel, Maya. Silas says Eddy is shedding his earthly tethers to embrace the true song of the Bloom. He is being honored."



"Honored? He looked like he was auditioning for a remake of The Last of Him!" I snapped, already pulling on my boots. "We have to find him."



We started our search in the "Serenity Grove," a designated quiet camping area. It was a sea of passed-out bodies, tangled limbs, and discarded glitter. And there, in the middle of a particularly dense cluster of sleeping forms, we found Eddy.



He wasn’t alone. He was nestled in the center of a true cuddle puddle – half a dozen other festival-goers, strangers by the looks of them, all spooning and clinging to him, almost reverently. Eddy himself was pale, sweating profusely, and twitching faintly. The petal-shaped burn on his arm had become a grotesque, swollen mass of what looked like hardened, dark red bark, mottled with patches of sickly yellow. Angry red filaments snaked out from it, like diseased veins.



"We need help," Maya said, her voice tight. She flagged down a pair of passing *Peacekeepers*.



"Our friend, he’s really sick!" she explained.



The two Peacekeepers, a young man and woman both with that unnervingly serene, wide-eyed gaze, exchanged a look. "Ah, the Bloom’s embrace can be intense for the newly awakened," the woman said, her voice like warm honey. Her eyes lingered on Eddy, then did a slow, appreciative sweep over me and Maya.



"He needs medical attention, not an energy reading!" I said.



"Of course, brother," the man murmured. "We will escort him to the Healing Sanctuary immediately."



They gently lifted Eddy. As they led him away, they didn't head towards the clearly marked First Aid tent. Instead, they turned towards the festival's periphery, in the direction of that dense thicket of trees where Maya had spotted the service tunnel entrance earlier.



"Hey, wait!" I called out. "The medical tent is that way!"



The male Peacekeeper glanced back, his smile unwavering. "The true Healing Sanctuary is a place of deeper connection, brother. Trust the process."



We started to follow, an awful premonition solidifying in my gut.



That’s when a soft, musical voice cut through the morning air, "Lost, little lambs?"



Silas. And Chloe. Standing there as if they’d materialized from the mist, seemingly waiting to intervene. Silas had an arm draped around Chloe’s shoulders, less like a comforting embrace and more like a beautiful vine slowly constricting its prey. Had I seen them from afar, I’d think they had two heads the way Silas bent down so closely, almost resting their head on Chloe’s shoulder, their mouth dancing so close to her ear, like a young androgynous Grima Wormtongue. 



"Chloe, listen to me," I pleaded, stepping forward. "Eddy is in serious trouble. This isn't some spiritual awakening; these people are dangerous!"



Chloe opened her eyes. For a terrifying moment, the fog seemed to clear, a flicker of the old, scared Chloe surfacing. "Liam…?"



But Silas was already slithering into her ear, something soft and sibilant. The flicker died. She pulled away from my gaze, grabbing at her red braided hair - more copper wire than silken locks.



"You just don’t understand," she whispered, her voice trembling but resolute. "Silas sees the real me. This is where I’m meant to be. I’m part of the song now." She looked at Silas with pure adoration. "I’m staying, Liam. I … have to."



"She has chosen the true path," Silas declared, their smile a predatory slash in their beautiful face. Their eyes swept over me, then lingered on Maya with that same unsettling, appraising intensity. "But the Bloom does not welcome … discord. Leave now, and perhaps your... vibrancy will be overlooked. Your friend is in much better hands." They gripped Chloe’s shoulder tighter, their arm still wrapped across her neck, giving a squeeze until both their cheeks touched.



They turned, Silas guiding Chloe away, deeper into the festival dust lit by the rising sun, towards the towering Ember Heart like a black hole. Chloe didn’t even look back. Though Silas briefly did, giving a sly winning grin.  It felt like watching someone willingly walk into a beautiful, all-consuming fire.



Maya and I just stood there, stunned and heartbroken. The feeling of absolute helplessness was suffocating. As we stood frozen, a small rock skittered across the path near my feet. We both jumped.



Sitting on the ground, arms around their knees, between two empty vendor tents, a lone figure. Had they been there this whole time? I hadn’t noticed them, but then again, we were preoccupied with *Jonestown 2.0*. They were completely nondescript in a dark, oversized hoodie, the hood pulled low, obscuring their face entirely - pulling a small memory of my first night here. 



"Once Silas gets their hooks in that deep… they don’t come back,” an almost raspy festival choked voice said, “Not whole, anyway.” As the figure stood up, they nodded their head in the direction the Peacekeepers had taken Eddy. "They took him down there. Into the roots." A pause, a flicker of what might have been frustration. "Smart people leave Emberbloom before the last night. *You two ain't smart*." And with a sigh while they dusted themselves off. “You best be out of here before Aetheric Echoes hits the main stage tonight. That’s when the real 'sacrament' happens.” With that, the figure wandered away speaking into the air “Who knows, you might still be able to catch them.”



I wasn’t sure if they meant Silas or Eddy.



"What the hell was that?" Maya whispered, looking around nervously. "Another threat?"



I just stared at the spot where the figure had been, my mind racing, connecting dots with a sudden, sickening clarity.



"No," I said, my voice low. "I don't think so."



The stolen trail mix. The hoodie. The slashed water carrier. They were nuisances. Annoying, sure, but not truly harmful. They were things designed to make your festival experience miserable, to make you throw your hands up and say, "This sucks, let's go home."



The crude wolf-head glyph wasn't a gang sign. It was a brand. A warning.



"They weren't trying to hurt us, Maya," I said, looking at her, my theory crystallizing into cold, hard fact. "They were trying to get us to leave. All of it. They're trying to scare people away… for their own good."



The realization didn't bring any comfort. It just painted a starker, more terrifying picture: that the horror of this place was so undeniable, there was a splinter group of people whose only way of fighting back was to act like petty criminals, hoping to drive potential victims away from the smiling, serene monsters who ran the show.



My earlier helplessness curdled into cold, hard resolve. Chloe seemed to have made her choice. But Eddy hadn't. We weren't just fighting for our friend anymore; we were standing against this whole rotten place.



"Come on," I said to Maya, my voice dry and tight, constricted with emotion but a grim determination. "Let's go get Eddy."



The service tunnel entrance was crudely concealed like kids hiding their bicycle under some tree branches. Inside, the air was cool, damp, and thick with the cloying smell of incense and something else… something like wet earth and decay. A stark contrast to the arid heat above that had beat us down every day since we arrived.  More spirals adorned the slick, sweating walls, some freshly painted, some looking ancient and disturbingly permanent. Faint chanting echoed from deeper within, a rhythmic, hypnotic drone.



Around a sharp, dripping bend, the tunnel opened into a wider chamber, lit by dozens of flickering candles. Several robed figures swayed, their faces hidden by deep hoods, their voices a monotonous drone.



And in the center was Eddy.



He was stripped naked with just a wreath around his neck. The bark-like, fungal growth had now consumed most of his arm and was visibly creeping up his neck and across his chest, a grotesque lattice of dark, pulsating veins under his waxy, translucent skin. The small, ugly nodules on it wept a thin, oily, blackish fluid. His chest barely moved. He looked less like a person and more like a zombie scarecrow posted in a diseased forest. Wet, red roots dangled from the ceiling, almost licking his face.



Before either of us could move, a figure detached itself from the deepest shadows by the far wall.



Silas. Flanked by two hulking, amulet-wearing cultists, their faces impassive, their eyes gleaming with that same unsettling, predatory light. Pretty sure these two were saved down here like some cave trolls - I never saw them above.



I paused with a bit of confusion, how’d they get down here so fast? Where was Chloe? *Why was Silas such a dick?* 



Silas smiled, a slow, satisfied stretching of their lips that was utterly devoid of warmth. "I knew you wouldn't heed my warning, Liam. Such tenacity." Their gaze flicked to Maya, a spark of something that looked disturbingly like bemused pleasure in their eyes. "And you, the watcher. Always drawn to the inevitable, like moths to a flame." Silas stepped closer, their saffron-colored robes whispering against the stone. "No matter. The Bloom is always hungry for strong spirits. And you both… you absolutely reek of it."
