I've always had the bad habit of scrolling endlessly in social medias like tiktok, reddit, youtube and more but mainly it was tiktok. This habit started when the pandemic was happening and it got worse overtime. It was really affecting my sleep, my productivity, my mental health and I even started skipping classes because of it. I knew I had to stop but it was difficult especially since I don't really have anything going on for me. 

One day on a Friday night I was lying down in bed, covering myself in my blanket,  lights closed, scrolling on tiktok and my fingers flickering video after video. I told myself I will stop after 10 minutes and go to sleep, but as usual those 10 mins turned into 30 mins, then turned into 1 hour and so on and so forth until it got to midnight.

I was getting drowsy and my eyes were getting heavy. I remember looking at the time in my phone, it was 2:20 and I promised myself I would stop in 2 mins and finally sleep. I looked at the time again and it got to 2:22, I thought to myself that I would scroll just 5 more times, but just as I was about to scroll, I felt an odd sensation. I couldn't move my thumb nor my hand nor any part of my body. I was panicking and I tried to flail arms, wiggling my toes or move any part of my body, but all I could do was close and open my eyes.  
  
I calmed myself down and had the idea that if I sleep and wake up then maybe I would be able to move again and that that this was just a one time thing. So I closed my eyes with my phone still on my hand, replaying the last video until it stopped and turned off. Then I felt my bed shake. I opened my eyes and I still couldn't move. Then, I heard it. A faint, shuffling sound coming from beneath my bed. My heart was rapidly beating and I was sweating. I looked at my phone screen and at the reflection I saw, a shadowy figure slowly rising behind me. It had long hair covering its face, limbs long and gaunt, skin pale and mottled. Even if I couldn't see the eyes, I felt it boring into me. It started getting close to me while it had a grin on its face.

I was trembling inside, I wanted to move, I wanted to scream but I couldn't. As it was getting closer I could feel the heat and I could see its face getting clearer and more detailed in the reflection. I closed my eyes out of fear and I was still trying to move.

Then I bolted upright, gasping for air, realizing I could move I quickly ran out of my room, not looking back. I went to the kitchen and I was catching my breath. I read a clock and it was 5am in the morning. I waited there until it was bright out and went to back to my room. I looked around to find that thing, I even looked under my bed and fortunately I saw nothing. My mom saw me up and said in a sarcastic tone "Wow you're up early".  
  
 I haven't told anyone about this story but after that night I couldn't sleep in my own room for awhile, so I slept with my parents like a kid (they were weirded out). Whether this experience was a product of sleep paralysis or something far more sinister, it was enough to break my bad habit for good. I limited myself from scrolling endlessly through social media and I got a gym membership and started going out more.
