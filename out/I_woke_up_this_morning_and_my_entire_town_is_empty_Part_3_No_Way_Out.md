Foreword: I’ve been posting these on my phone but figured out that I can respond to comments using a laptop I found last night. So all is good now.

After posting part 2, I drove around for a while, not knowing where to go or stay for the night. As I was driving, I remembered my friend Eric from high school. We used to hang out at his house all the time. I remembered that the spare key to the house was inside of the grill in his backyard, all I would have to do was drive over and get the key and I’d have safe shelter for the night. There was one more place left to go though. 

I drove back to my house, my Dad had his pistol permit for a few years and he kept a Glock 19 in a lockbox next to his bed. 

Before exiting the car, I grabbed the baseball bat from the backseat. I’d rather be safe than sorry. 

I walked into the house and up the stairs quickly, I didn’t want to waste anymore time needed in that house. I grabbed the key to the lockbox from my dad’s sock drawer and unlocked the lockbox. I picked up the handgun and two boxes of ammo. I bolted out of the house and back to my car.

When I finally made it inside of Eric’s house, I turned the heat on and set down my things. Afterwards I shut all of the curtains and slept until morning. It was a good night of sleep. 

When I woke up the next morning, I opened a can of sliced pineapple and ate that for breakfast. I was really in a rush, I couldn’t wait to leave town and talk to real people again. I packed up my things and walked outside, but stopped at the first step when I saw them.
Five of those… things were standing in the road, with the old woman being the one standing in front of them, like she was leading them. I felt paralyzed with fear, like I couldn’t move. Finally I reached behind me, grabbing the Glock and turning the safety off. 
“Now listen, I- I don’t want any trouble” I muttered. 
I looked at them carefully, there was the old woman, the middle aged man from yesterday, a child that looked to be of middle school age. A woman my age, and an old man wearing overalls. 
They all took a step towards me.
I raised the gun, “Hey! I said I don’t want any trouble!” I shouted. 
They stepped again.
“We crave blood” they said in unison.
I unlocked the car, “I’m gonna get in the car now, just please, let me go.”
“Blood Blood Blood” They said as they started walking toward me.
“I’m fucking warning you!” I shouted.
The old man charge me first, all I can really remember is squeezing the trigger and hearing the gun shot. I didn’t look to see where I hit him, all I know is I did. They all started to charge me but I didn’t care, I ran for the car and got out of there as quick as possible.

I started to think about how they could have found me and then I started to realize, it’s heat. They can find me by heat.

I started driving to the outside of town and let out a sigh of relief as I passed by the sign. 
Confusion began to set in after 30 minutes when I realized I drove back into town. I tried to leave again and ended up back in town, then again, and again. Finally I just gave up.

As I drove back into town, I noticed something weird. There was tons of those things by the landfill, some were throwing trash into a huge bonfire, as big as a house and some were just standing there, staring up at it. Currently I’m sitting on the side of the road. I’ll update with a part 4 as soon as I can. I don’t know if the next part will be the last, but I’m going to that landfill and I’m going to find out what is going on.
