No one ever left Dyer’s Hollow. They just disappeared.

Maggie had lived in the town her whole life, watching it rot from the inside out. Once, Dyer’s Hollow had been a proper little village—church bells on Sunday, a schoolhouse, a general store—but as the mills shut down and the land soured, the people trickled away. Now, maybe fifty souls remained, all too stubborn, too poor, or too frightened to leave.

Maggie had always assumed it was poverty keeping folks in place. Then, one night, she saw the thing in the woods.

It started with a light. A single, wavering glow through the black trees at the edge of her yard. At first, she thought it was a firefly, but it was February, and nothing should have been glowing in the dead of winter. The light bobbed closer, and that’s when she saw it wasn’t floating—it was attached to something. A figure, tall and thin, moving with a slow, jerky rhythm, like a puppet on tangled strings.

She slammed the curtains shut.

Her father, one of the last loggers still working in the hills, warned her about things like this. *If you see a light in the woods, girl, you don’t follow it. You lock the doors and don’t look out till morning.* He told stories—old stories—about the Hollow before it was a town, when something else lived here first. Something that didn’t take kindly to strangers, or to those who overstayed their welcome.

Maggie had always thought it was just folklore, meant to scare kids into behaving. But that was before the light.

The next morning, her neighbor, Mr. Ellis, was gone. His truck was still in the driveway. The door to his little house stood open, snowdrifts piled up just inside.

The town didn’t look for him. They never did.

That night, the light came back. This time, it was closer. Maggie’s breath came short as she peeked through the blinds. The figure stood at the edge of her yard now, the light—like a burning ember—flickering in the center of its chest.

It wasn’t human.

Its limbs were too long, its neck tilted at a wrong, unnatural angle. And though she couldn’t see its face in the darkness, she knew it was looking at her.

She backed away from the window, heart pounding.

Then, the whispers started.

They were soft at first, a rustling noise like wind through dead leaves. But then she heard her name.

*Maggie…*

She clamped her hands over her ears.

The next morning, she made a decision. She packed a bag, stuffed it into her rusted-out Honda, and turned onto the only road out of town. She drove fast, faster than she ever had before, willing the Hollow to disappear in her rearview mirror.

But the road didn’t end.

It should have taken her twenty minutes to reach the next town over. Then an hour. Then two. But every time she thought she was free, she passed the same dead maple tree, the same rotting “Welcome to Dyer’s Hollow” sign.

The town wouldn’t let her leave.

That night, when she pulled into her driveway, defeated, the light was waiting for her.

Closer now.

And it wasn’t alone.

Maggie gripped the steering wheel so hard her knuckles went white. Her breath came in shallow gasps as she stared at the figures standing in her yard.

The lights in their chests flickered like dying coals, casting a faint orange glow across the snow. There were three of them now. Their bodies were tall and impossibly thin, their limbs moving with a slow, unnatural sway. They stood just beyond her porch, waiting.

She didn’t get out of the car.

*This isn’t real. This isn’t real.*

But then one of them took a step forward.

Maggie flinched, her instincts screaming at her to *run*, but where would she go? She had spent hours trying to escape the Hollow, only to end up right back where she started. She could lock herself inside, but Mr. Ellis had locked his doors too.

And now he was gone.

The figures didn’t move again. They just… watched.

Maggie forced herself to breathe, then slowly, carefully, she reached for her phone. She hit 9-1-1, but the call didn’t go through. No signal.

That was impossible.

She checked again. The bars were gone. The entire screen was black, except for one thing—a single, pulsing word.

STAY.

Her stomach dropped.

With shaking hands, she shoved the phone into her pocket and grabbed the rusted tire iron from the passenger seat. It wasn’t much, but it was something. Then, gathering every ounce of courage she had left, she stepped out of the car.

The air smelled wrong. Heavy, like burnt wood and damp earth.

The figures remained where they were, though Maggie could hear the faint, crackling hum of their chests. It sounded almost… wet.

“Who are you?” she demanded, forcing strength into her voice.

The tallest figure tilted its head, as if considering her. Then, in a voice like wind through dead trees, it whispered:

*"You know us."*

Maggie’s blood turned to ice.

Somewhere deep in her bones, she *did* know them.

The stories her father told—the ones she never believed. About the Hollow before it was Dyer’s Hollow. About the thing that lived here, long before people built their homes, before they cut down its forests and drained its rivers. It had never left. It had only been waiting.

“Let me go,” she said, her voice shaking.

*"You belong to us."*

The tallest one stepped forward, and for the first time, she saw its face.

It wasn’t human.

It wasn’t anything.

There were no eyes, no mouth, only a gaping void where a face should have been. And inside that void, flickering like a dying candle, was something older than language.

Something hungry.

Maggie turned and *ran*.

She barely made it to the house before the whispers began again, curling around her like smoke. She slammed the door shut and threw the deadbolt. Then she ran to the windows, locking them one by one, though she knew—*somehow, she knew*—it wouldn’t matter.

The house groaned.

Something moved inside the walls.

A scraping sound, slow and deliberate, like nails dragging through wood.

Maggie backed into the kitchen, heart hammering, tire iron clenched so tight it hurt. The lights flickered. The air pressed against her, thick and suffocating.

Then the power cut out.

Darkness swallowed the house.

And in the silence, right behind her, something whispered—

*"You never left."*
