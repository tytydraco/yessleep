The first thing I smell each day when I walk into my house is a heavy stench. The kind that weaves into your clothes and stays with you even after a wash. The room smelled similar to a skunk mixed with garlic breath and body odor. The kind that only comes from a large, burly man who’s allergic to showers. This was my mom’s new boyfriend, Adam.

I don’t like Adam. He’s loud in every way someone can be. It was the colors he wore and the expressions he made whenever I said something. He’s an asshole, he barely acknowledges that I’m there. I don’t like him. I miss my mom’s old boyfriend, at least he bought me stuff. 

My mom said that he makes her feel young again, free. That’s the only nice thing she’s had to say about him for the past couple of months. Even then, it was only in the beginning of their relationship that she said that. After maybe a month, the only thing that was said was slamming cupboards and punching walls. 

It became clear pretty early on that it was better for me to avoid home. This wasn’t the first time this has happened. Mom had a wide array of boyfriends, men she met at the bar or really just any man who gave her attention. She’d always been like that. 

Even then, I’m surprised she hasn’t broken up with him. He’s kind of ugly. He consistently buzzes his hair, but he wears a hat to cover it. It’s got a soaked-in sweat stain around the rim, and the blue has faded unevenly. Something that really bothers me is his fingernails. They’re yellow, and his nails have weird ridges on them. That could be just because he’s old, though. 

That’s not to say I didn’t worry about her, or that I don’t love her, I did. I still do, but recently, she’s been acting weird. Weirder than normal, that is. 

She’s always been the ‘fun’ mom. The kind of mom that lets the kid do whatever they want. You want pink hair? I’ll help you! Oh, you want leftover cake from your cousin’s birthday party for breakfast? It’s not like there's anything else in the fridge! She's not exactly the most attentive, but she isn't a bad mom. She just had it rough when she was younger. She doesn't talk about it much but sometimes I get some details out of her when I ask the right questions.

Once I asked if I had any aunts or uncles, and she replied, "Not really." When I asked what she meant by that, she told me about her cousins who were a lot like siblings. 

Last night she didn’t come home. It’s not like this is too unusual, but it's weird for her not to tell me that she’s going out beforehand. Which, by the way, was really fucking scary. We just moved here, and this trailer is dingy. It's small, and kids keep whispering around me.  They're not very subtle when they point, look, and then whisper. 

She came back with bruises. Adam never directly hit her, and I’d never felt like he would. He would bark, but I didn’t think he’d ever bite. He was a coward. Beyond that, my mom isn’t the type to get hit. Which sounds weird, I know that, but her relationships were never like that. 

Maybe I’m overthinking it. It's just a few small things. I don’t like this place. I miss my old house. My house, which was actually a house, not this weird, probably haunted trailer. 

I don’t have anyone I can talk about this to at school, I don’t know anyone, and I don’t want to get my mom in trouble, but what is happening? 

If I tell a teacher, then they’ll think that I’m some sort of sad, neglected puppy on the side of the street. That’s just the way my mom is. She’s always been a little weird; it doesn’t bother me because she deserves the world. 

She had me at 17, so maybe I just need to get off her and let her act a little weird. If you guys have any idea, please let me know.
