**I'm a teacher at Black Lake High School. Yesterday, there was a fire and a kid refused to exit. I now know the terrifying reason why.**

I’ve been teaching at Black Lake High for nearly twelve years. English, mostly. Nothing out of the ordinary ever happened—until yesterday. It started off as any other Monday. Students slouched into class, half-asleep, some scrolling on their phones, others whispering about weekend gossip. The morning bell rang. I did roll call. Everything was routine… until the fire alarm screamed through the halls during fifth period.

Now, we’ve had drills before. Kids are used to it. But this time, the alarm had a different tone—shrill, urgent, cutting deep. I could already smell the faint hint of smoke in the air. Not artificial fog or some prank. Real smoke. I told the students to line up and led them out toward the field with the rest of the building’s occupants. Teachers counted heads. Students joked nervously. But I noticed one name missing.

**Elijah Kerr.**

A quiet kid. Sat in the back. Hardly talked. Always pale, always scribbling things into his notebook. I remember seeing him just before the alarm went off—staring at the clock like it was counting down to something only he knew. When I realized he wasn’t among the evacuees, I panicked.

I flagged down a firefighter and told him there was still a student inside. He said they’d do a sweep but urged me to stay with my class. I nodded but waited. Twenty minutes passed. Then thirty. Finally, a crew returned. One of them pulled off his helmet and shook his head.

“No sign of the kid.”

No sign? How is that possible?

By the end of the day, parents were called. Police arrived. They searched the school once it was safe. No Elijah. No body. Just his backpack. Just his notebook.

That night, I couldn’t sleep. The school said they’d handle it. But I kept thinking—why didn’t he leave? He had plenty of time. What was he doing?

Today, I went back. Officially, the school was closed for inspection. But I still have keys. I had to know what Elijah had been writing in that notebook. Curiosity or guilt, I’m not sure which drove me harder.

I unlocked my classroom door. The air smelled like scorched wires and damp ash. The windows were darkened with smoke residue. His notebook was right where they said—under his desk, pages curled from the heat but mostly intact.

The first few pages were just sketches. Strange symbols. Circles with eyes. Spirals. Some kind of language I didn’t recognize, though it looked almost... **organic**, like it was alive on the page. Then, I saw the entries. Dated. Countdowns.

That last line made me freeze.  
“If I leave, it gets out.”

Suddenly, something slammed against the vent above the whiteboard. I jumped, heart punching my ribs. I told myself it was just loose metal from the fire. But then I saw it.

The vent cover had bent outward—*from the inside*.

I grabbed the notebook and backed out of the classroom, locking the door behind me. I should’ve left then, but I couldn’t. I had to check the vent above Elijah’s desk.

Using a chair, I stood and looked inside.

There were **scratch marks**. Deep, jagged gouges in the metal. Some made with fingers. Some with something else. Something **clawed**. And written along the inner wall, in what looked like dried blood or something worse, were more of Elijah’s symbols—except these were...burned into the metal.

That’s when the hallway lights flickered. One by one, they buzzed and died, leaving me in the dim red emergency glow. I heard the vent cover fall behind me with a crash. I ran.

I ran past the science labs, past the trophies glinting in the dim light, past the fire-charred lockers. And I swear I heard something crawl through the walls beside me—skittering fast, dragging something heavy behind it.

I made it out through the faculty exit and didn’t stop running until I got home. I locked every door, turned on every light, and opened the notebook again.

I flipped to the last page. The final entry wasn’t written in ink.

It was scorched into the paper:

I looked at the clock.

**3:18 PM.**

And the smell of smoke… it was back.

But it wasn’t coming from the notebook.

It was coming from my **bedroom vent**.
