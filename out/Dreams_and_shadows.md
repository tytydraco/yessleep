My name is Alex, or whatever you prefer to call me. When I was a child, I often couldn’t make friends in school. I was the weird kid, the one who didn’t fit in. Since I was usually alone as a child, I was often in a depressive mood. At a very young age, I started to lose sight of the future for myself. The kids in my class didn’t really like me. They would say they saw me talking to myself when I was alone, but I never admitted it.

Elementary school ended like this. But when I moved to middle school, things didn’t get any better. I think it was around the 7th grade when I woke up one morning to find a tall, pitch-black figure at the foot of my bed. It had no face, and it was very tall. When it realized I was watching it, it started walking toward me, but when I called out to it, it disappeared. I didn’t really believe in metaphysical things. Maybe it was just a hallucination, and a part of me told me I should approach this scientifically. After all, I’ve always loved science. I knew this was just a hallucination. I didn’t dwell on it much and went back to sleep. I never saw that thing again.

However, not long after, I started feeling like someone was following me. I didn’t know who or why, but I knew it was just a feeling. I was aware that it was just a delusion. Back then, I was reading Freud’s books, and I was deeply interested in psychology. I knew these were just things in my mind.

My father was a doctor. I told him about my situation. He just told me it was a normal part of adolescence, and that made me feel better. He even mentioned that he’d had similar experiences when he was younger, but that they went away as he grew up. But for me, it kept getting worse. After a year, I couldn’t be alone anymore. I had to sleep with someone, and it became a kind of torture for me. At that point, I realized my situation was deteriorating. A couple of years passed, and even though I was in high school, nothing had changed.

In high school, I met a girl named Daria. She was quiet and calm, usually reading books, and she would share what she was reading with me. We would exchange books. Not long after, we started getting to know each other better.

Daria was an atheist, but not exactly someone who completely rejected the idea of something. She believed that after death, she would go to hell because she didn’t believe in God. She was in a lot of pain because of this belief. She had this strange effort to prepare herself for the hellfire. She would take showers in extremely hot water, and some parts of her skin were burned. She also started cutting her arms to get used to the pain. But none of these things were enough for her. She was searching for more pain, believing she could only prepare for hell through that suffering.

Daria and I got very close in a short time. The relationship between us is hard to describe. We had one point in common, though. She believed that, because she didn’t believe in the God that she thought existed, she would be punished by Him, and I believed that things I didn’t believe in were following me.

Maybe I had gotten more depressed and paranoid. But I would soon start to believe in the existence of things I didn’t believe in. One day, as I was walking home from school, I dropped Daria off at her house and was heading home. It was winter, and it was getting dark early. The sun had barely set, but the air had this gray tone that was unsettling. Since I was alone, I started checking my surroundings like I always did when I was alone. That’s when I noticed a man, probably in his 30s or 40s, with a cigarette in his mouth, extremely thin, and with long hair, was watching me. Maybe I was really being followed. I remember running home without even looking back.

Even though I ran, the man didn’t chase me; he just kept watching. That night, I thought maybe he was harmless, and I fell asleep. But the next morning, when I looked out of the window, I saw him standing in front of my house, looking at my window, and I couldn’t stand still from fear.

I wanted to tell my family, but I knew they wouldn’t listen. They would probably just dismiss it as my usual paranoia. So, I stayed silent, at least for a while. When I looked again, the man was gone.

I’m sure that if I had seen the man there again, I would have been less scared, because knowing where the person hiding is would have kept me alert all the time. But still, I left for school. Nothing unusual happened on the way. I picked up Daria, and we went to school. On the way home, I didn’t see anyone.

For a few weeks, I didn’t see the man again, but I kept feeling like I was being watched. I didn’t know where this would lead. I told Daria about it, and she suggested I report it to the police, but I didn’t want to. My family would probably just tell the police that everything was in my head, and they would believe them. Maybe I’d end up in a psychiatric hospital. So I avoided that option as much as I could.

I wasn’t the only one in a bad situation, though. Daria was affected by everything too. She was very upset about me, but I couldn’t bear to see her sad because of me.

Daria started telling me that she had been having very realistic dreams. According to her, she couldn’t even distinguish what happened in reality and what happened in her dreams. She quickly started to believe that her dreams were trying to tell her something. She was always predicting bad things would happen to both of us. She said we would be killed by this man and that we would go to hell because of our sins. But by then, I hadn’t seen the man in a long time.

But not seeing him for a long time didn’t mean everything was over. Eventually, I saw him again, watching my house. This time, he was hiding in a very secretive place, just his face visible from behind a wall. And until that moment, I had never noticed him before. Maybe he never left, I thought to myself. This made me even more paranoid.

Daria kept saying all of this was a devil’s game. She said that the man was going to sacrifice us for the devil. It struck me as strange, especially since she claimed to be an atheist.

Moreover, according to Daria, the person responsible for all this was her. By forming an emotional connection with me, she had dragged me into her sin. It was obvious that she couldn’t handle any of this anymore.

The next morning, when I went to pick her up from her house, she didn’t come down. I went upstairs, and her mother opened the door. The woman was crying, and I could tell something was wrong. I found out that Daria had killed herself.

She gave me a letter. It said:

“Alex,

Everything I did was in vain. Everything was in vain, everything was in vain. I want you to know that I did all of this for you. My body wasn’t ready for hell yet. I wasn’t prepared. But I knew that in order to prevent you from being killed by that man, in order to save you from becoming a sacrifice for the devil, I had to be sacrificed. My dreams told me this. That’s all. This man will never follow you again.”

That was the whole letter. And it wasn’t Daria’s style. I’m sure of it. Daria always spoke poetically. This letter seemed hastily written.

I never saw the man again. Maybe I believed in it, and that’s why I never saw him. Maybe he’s still following me, but I don’t know it. But I don’t care anymore.

That’s all. After Daria, I couldn’t make any more friends. I haven’t spoken to anyone since. My family started sending me to therapy. The therapist is sure I wasn’t being followed. It’s probably all just in my head. But I don’t know… I’m sure there’s no happy ending for me. That’s the only thing I know.
