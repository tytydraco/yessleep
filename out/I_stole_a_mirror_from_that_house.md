I always wanted to visit the mansion between the hills. 


One day, the opportunity presented itself in that my boss asked me to interview the owner, a rather quiet, withdrawn person. 


He will buy a major movie studio, and our readers would like to know him better.


On the appointed day, I arrived. I parked my car. 


As soon as I left the car, rain began. It was windy and there was something off about the raindrops. I entered.


In the first room, I saw old paintings. In the second room, I saw a large table a piano, and all sorts of musical instruments.


In the third room, I saw two sheep. A butler was feeding them. I met and interviewed the man. 


We talked about art, the history of film, politics, war, peace, and companies, and on every topic, this man had an uncanny knowledge.


Then, I left. On my way out, different than the first, I saw an ornate mirror. I hesitated a bit, but then, I took it. It had beautiful diamonds.


All was fine. The interview was published and it was a success.


I placed the mirror on my desk. I admired myself in it. Then, things started happening. The rain and the wind seemed to follow me every time I left home.


It rained for days at the time. I began dreaming of the man. In them, he was angry I took the mirror.


My boss fell sick. So did a few of my coworkers. Then, deaths started. And the rain didn't seem to stop.


My boss died. I was struck with sorrow, but I kept telling myself it was a coincidence.


I found myself gazing in the mirror for hours at a time. I went shopping when suddenly, I was surrounded by dogs. 


They growled viciously. They revealed their sharp teeth. I hit one with my shopping bag. I ran. I barely escaped.


One night, I dreamt of the businessman I interviewed. I woke up. I heard my name being called. 


It was loud. I followed the sound. I grabbed a gun and left the house. I saw my boss in the street.


He attacked me. I fought him. I shot him. As soon as I did that, he ran away back into the darkness.


The next day, I became sick. I went to the hospital. It was empty. I saw a nurse. I asked her for help, but she laughed and told me I shouldn't have stolen the mirror.


Then, she started flirting with me. We were all alone. She insisted we did things. I refused. She began harassing me.


Then, I accepted. I followed every move of her lip. 


"Why is this place so empty?" I wondered.


I followed the nurse across the hallway. She was teasing me.


I was seduced. We kissed. She invited me to a nearby room. Then, suddenly, I shook my head and saw the truth: All around me, corpses littered the area. 


There were doctors, patients,, and nurses. All dead, all with wounds.


I backed off. The nurse revealed her sharp teeth. 


She began chasing me. I entered my car and drove home.


The nurse was outside. I locked all my doors. Shrieks and pounding.


Then, it stopped. It was all quiet. Not a sound, except for my heavy breathing.


Then, I saw him. First as a shadow, then as the businessman I interviewed. 


I saw him slide towards me, then I woke up in my bed. Was it just a dream? Something is wrong and I need help.


The mirror is still there, but it no longer reflects my image. Neither does the one in the bathroom nor the one in the hallway. I can still use Reddit to reach out for help.
