It's practically a cliche at this point, right? Every millenial mom at some point or another has had their kid beg them to buy in-game currency for whatever's hot at the moment. And every mom's been on the receiving end of the iPad kid tantrum they throw when they don't get it. It's like a rite of passage.  
  
But things have gotten dire here. My son has gotten a bit more... "creative" in his pursuit of money. He's stolen my credit cards and tried to log into by bank account. I gave him a cash allowance, but he used it to buy Visa gift cards he would then enter into the game. I put a stop to that. No more allowance, no more birthday money.  
  
The game's called Arcadia. Android only, I suspect because the developers felt iOS was too locked down, more on that later. For the longest time I didn't even know what the game was because whenever I tried to look, he always hid his phone screen, like he was ashamed of it.  
  
I downloaded the game to see what he's so obsessed with. Right off the bat, there weren't just red flags, but red flashing lights and alarm bells. The first page of the EULA read "WARNING: You will be gaslit," and the proceed button is grayed out until you click a checkbox saying "My grip on reality was never that strong anyway." What the fuck is *that?* What IS this?! The app asks for every single permission from your phone, and doesn't boot until you allow all of them. It even encourages you to root your phone. Fuck that, I'm running it on an emulator in a virtual machine. I've been around the block once or twice. Once I gave it full access to my nonexistent phone, the developer's name appeared on screen: Sinneslöschen.  
  
I had suppressed the memories, but I could never forget that word. German for "sense delete," apparently. When I lived in Portland, there was this urban legend about an arcade game called Polybius. Supposedly it was some secret government mind control project. I never paid it much mind. It sounded like one of my dad's ramblings. He claimed to be an MKUltra test subject. But he was always a conspiracy theorist, and had all kinds of wacky ideas about how the world works and who runs it. For a long time I didn't even think MKUltra was real, until they declassified the files. When I read them, his stories did match what they described. Of course all this happened after he passed. I could never apologize for doubting him. I wonder if trauma like his is generational. I do remember reading once that trauma rewrites your DNA.  
  
In any case, I was heading up to the arcade with my girlfriends for a round of Ms. Pac-Man. When just by chance, two men in black suits were installing a Polybius cabinet. They didn't put it in line with the other games. They gave it its own special area, where it stood out like a monolith. We all knew the legend. My girlfriends dared me to give it a try. And who am I to back down from a dare?  
  
It was a vector game, like Tempest. In fact it was basically a Tempest ripoff, except instead of shooting, you collect arbitrary shapes. I was disappointed at first. The game was too easy and boring. But as the game progressed, the tunnel drew me closer and closer towards a wiry figure. The closer I got, the clearer the image became of a disembodied nervous system. Its bare, piercing blue eyeballs would come to haunt me in my sleep, just before dreams, when all the colors start to swirl. Its brain decayed before my eyes, becoming infested with maggots and liquefying into a dripping black sludge. I could smell it, even now, just imagining it. The figure came to dominate the screen, obscuring the playfield. And just when I felt lost in its unyielding gaze, the killscreen ripped me from my consciousness: a sequence of red and blue flashes almost certain to induce a seizure. At least that's what happened to me, anyway.  
  
Despite the health scare, I was compelled to keep playing. I tore apart my house looking for quarters and wandered the streets in search of loose change. I actually pretended to be homeless once. Yeah, I'm not proud of it either. I started seeing men in black out of the corner of my eye, and they'd disappear as soon as I looked at them. I never told anyone that, I didn't want to seem crazy. My parents convinced a rehab center to take me (gaming addiction wasn't recognized as a disorder back then), and luckily, it worked. I looked into similar options for my son, but my insurance doesn't cover rehab. Even with my salary, San Francisco is a bitch. They practically charge you to breathe here.  
  
Going back to Arcadia, it seemed to be nothing more than a modernized Polybius. Upon starting a new game, the following message appears on screen: "WARNING: In this game you earn a score. This score will not be posted to a leaderboard. Do not post about your score online. Your score is between you and God." Absolutely batshit. Another warning: "In this game you play as a rat. You collect molecules. Do not question this." Well I wasn't going to before, but *now* I am.  
  
And the microtransactions bear questioning, too. They sell lootboxes, but there's no loot. All you get is a color indicating rarity. You can also buy credits to spin a wheel for the chance to increase a number. This number has no gameplay significance, and as far as I can tell, there's no way to actually look at it. Of course, in mobile games, they always give you something on your first spin (the first hit's free), and all it said was "The number has been increased." By how much? Who knows! My son really begs me for money for *this?*  
  
What was especially concerning was that after playing the game, all my targeted ads became cigarettes and alcohol, even on my real phone. Is it even legal to advertise those? I asked my son if he got those ads, and luckily, he said no. His ads were for candy and soda. Ok, so at least it's age appropriate. But aren't candy and soda addictive in their own way?  
  
There were other wrinkles too. In addition to the addiction, he also developed behavioral problems. He started fights at school and lashed out at anyone who tried to take his phone away. He even tried to bite a teacher. He was never like this before Arcadia. He was always a sweet boy. He loved butterflies and rainbows even when other kids made fun of him for it. Where did that boy go?  
  
But I shouldn't talk about it if there are no other witnesses, right? So I started talking to other parents. It turns out Arcadia is a much bigger problem than I imagined. My son isn't even the worst case. Some kid broke into his father's gun safe and pointed it at him when he tried to take his phone. Luckily, it wasn't loaded. I made a Facebook group, and over 50 people joined. We all gave each other advice and emotional support. Arcadia has many victims.   
  
Despite this, and despite the weirdness, I felt a strong urge to play it again. I was too antsy to wait to get home to my VM. I downloaded it again, and I was reluctant to allow all those permissions. But I already gave all my data to China when I downloaded TikTok, so what the hell. Those targeted ads must have worked too, cause I bought cigarettes for the first time since I had my son. A six-pack of Mike's Hard Lemonade, too (don't judge me), and a lotto ticket. Maybe if I win I can get my son into rehab. As I sat on the deck with my cigarette and my nightcap, chasing molecules, a warm feeling came over me. It was more than nostalgia, it wasn't the *pain* of homecoming. I *was* home.  
  
I came back in to the sound of my son screaming. I rushed to his room. "I couldn't move!" he said, "I couldn't scream!" Sleep paralysis. I know the feeling. It happened to me after Polybius. The arcade cabinet sat on my chest, weighing me down, and men in black surrounded my bed. It was one of the most terrifying experiences of my life. My dad had sleep paralysis, too, right before he was abducted and injected with psychedelics. Seeing it happen to my son broke my heart. As I consoled him, I peeked at his phone. It was flashing red and blue, playing a YouTube video titled "Arcadia Activation Sequence (10 hours)."  
  
I asked the parents if they remembered Polybius. Only a few did, but their stories all matched mine. And they all saw men in black too. It's nice to know that memory is real, at least. But soon after I mentioned Polybius, the group got deleted. I'd added a few of them as friends, but they suddenly disappeared from my friends list. I guess they were cleaning up their friends lists after the group got shut down.  
  
I found a trademark for Sinneslöschen filed by a Michael M. Zadrozny. I contacted him, and he happened to have a Sinneslöschen business card on his desk that very moment. Strange coincidence. The only thing on it was a website, and worryingly, it was a .onion domain. They're really going to make me break out Tor for this, huh?  
  
It looked lika BBS from the 80s: white ASCII on a black background. The only available page was "careers." Suddenly, I had an idea. I've been coding since I was a kid. Ada Lovelace and Hedy Lamarr were my childhood heroes. I'll have you know that coding used to be women's work before men realized there was money in it. Sorry, got sidetracked. I never worked in games because there's more money in other fields, but the fundamentals carry over. If I went undercover, I could blow this thing wide open. Clicking the link took me to a command line, where they asked me to type my name. Upon doing so, it prints the message "Your data has been collected. Thank you for your participation in the Arcadia Initiative." All I entered was my name! What data? At this point, do I even *want* to know?  
  
I woke up in the middle of the night. My phone was on my chest, open to the activation video. It weighed as much as an elephant. I couldn't move. Jesus Christ, not again. Not again. Not again. Not again.  
  
Two men in black appeared on either side of my bed, fading into view like ghosts. They jammed a needle into my neck and injected me with god knows what. I looked down as far as my eyes would allow, and was greeted with a floor covered with writhing, shrieking rats. The bedroom door opened, and an exposed nervous system floated in. It hovered above me, brushing me with its feathery tendrils before mimicking my position. Its brain bubbled and dripped a tar-like substance onto my face. The smell. Oh my god, I'm back again. The nervous system descended, sinking into my body and becoming part of me. The bedroom became bathed in alternating flashes of red and blue lights. And then everything went black.  
  
When I came to, I was bound to a steel folding chair in a blinding white room. A stout, bearded elderly man sat behind an antique mahogany desk, flanked by two men in black. His inquisitive eyes lent him a grandfatherly appearance, but his crooked smile betrayed his calculating nature. "I'm glad you could make it to our scheduled interview," he said. "I wasn't sure if you'd accept our invitation. Christopher Hedgering, charmed." He extended his hand for a handshake. Funny guy. "If you have any questions before we begin, I'd be glad to answer them." The men in black reached into their inside breast pockets. "But do choose your words carefully."  
  
Where do I even begin? I had no way of knowing if what I was about to say would lead to my own death. My mind went blank. I could only muster the courage to speak one word: "Why?"  
  
"Why what?" prodded Hedgering.  
  
"Why do this to children?"  
  
He seemed surprised by my question. "Why does any company do anything? For money, of course."  
  
I don't buy it for a second. "So it's all business, huh? Well what about *them*?" I nodded towards the men in black. "What business do you have with government agents?"  
  
The men in black whipped out their pistols. Hedgering motioned for them to lower them. "They're a private security firm. Our data is very sensitive, as I'm sure you understand."  
  
"The data you get from turning kids into addicts?"  
  
"The term 'addiction' carries so much stigma. We prefer 'player retention.'" He pulled a cigar from his desk drawer and snipped off the end. "The data from the Polybius experiment served us for many decades, but we've reached the limit of that technology. Oh, by the way, the secret of Polybius is that the joystick measures the galvanic skin response, and the game intensifies whatever stimulus increases it." He paused to light his cigar. "Your son's generation is the perfect test bed for our new player retention system. They *are* called 'Generation Alpha,' after all."  
  
I scoffed. "What a sick joke. What you call player retention, I call gambling."  
  
His smile grew in devilish condescension. "Have you noticed how an arcade cabinet resembles a slot machine? You insert coins and move the lever for a chance at satisfaction." I *hadn't* noticed that, actually. It seems so obvious in retrospect. "And video arcades didn't come from nowhere: they're the evolution of early 20th century pinball arcades. And pinball, for a long time, was considered gambling. It was actually illegal in Chicago and New York until the late 70s. So you see, gambling has been in video gaming's blood from the very start. It's written into their DNA. But while gambling is regulated by the federal government, video gaming is not, which makes it a useful gateway to more mature forms of chance-based gaming." He took a long drag of his cigar. "The fact of the matter is this: there is no conspiracy. Simply put, addiction is profitable."  
  
I had no response. Has it really always been this way? The men in black untied me. Hedgering stood from his chair. "I'll show you out. Unfortunately, we don't have any openings right now. If you're looking for a new line of work, why not franchise an animatronic pizza parlor? I hear those are popular with the kids these days. I was going to open one in the 70s, but some rat beat me to it."  
  
Hedgering wrapped his arm around my shoulder and led me out of the office. Dozens of men in black lined the halls. I was paralyzed. "What's wrong?" asked Hedgering. "They're only security. Don't you feel secure?"  
  
Eyes wide in terror, I shambled forward. The men in black shot daggers at me from behind their sunglasses. I couldn't stand to look at them. I lowered my head and kept my eyes glued to the floor. The path out the building took so many twists and turns I lost count. I was a rat in a maze, my every movement being observed. My chest tightened and my breathing shallowed. Was it a panic attack or a heart attack? Every time I stopped to soothe the pain, the men in black pushed me forward. I felt the aura of a migraine. The sharpest, most splitting headache of my life took hold of me. I grasped my hair, pulling it from the roots. All I could do was collapse.  
  
The next thing I know, I'm standing on the shoulder of a highway. Thank god for Uber, am I right? Cost a fortune. Apparently I was in Sunnyvale. My son didn't even realize I was gone, that activation video kept him too busy to notice. So now that I'm home, I've been struggling to process this. The crazy thing is, Arcadia uninstalled itself from my phone and it's no longer on Google Play. It even uninstalled itself from my emulated phone. I can't believe I'm thinking this, but... That app *did* exist, right? I would ask the other parents, but they stopped responding to my texts. Were they told to do so? Or do they think I'm crazy? I need you guys to help me out.  
  
Question one: are we *sure* it's not the government? Hedgering said the men in black were private security, but they never seemed to secure anything. They were always watching from a distance, and took off when spotted. That sounds more like surveillance to me. Question two: *am* I being paranoid? Hedgering's explanation of the industry made a lot of sense, and it's simpler than any conspiracy theory (Occam's Razor, and all). But that still doesn't explain the psychological effects. Ever since I left that building, I haven't felt right in my body. I feel like a floating nervous system with a rotting brain. I look in the mirror and see my body there, but I'm not in it. That isn't me. My sense of self has been deleted. Jesus, I think I might actually be going insane. I mean my dad had bipolar, and that can get passed down. But was that diagnosis even real? Or were they just trying to paint him as crazy so no one would believe him? Am I losing my grip on reality? Was it ever that strong to begin with? I *need* you to tell me if I'm making sense. I *need* you to tell me I'm not being gaslitthugjhjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjnb
