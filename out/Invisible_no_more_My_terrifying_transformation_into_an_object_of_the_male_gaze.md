   

I never thought of myself as an unattractive woman, but I was definitely not a head-turner. I always envied the ladies who walked down the street and received admiring glances from men, especially the construction workers who whistled and catcalled. I longed for that kind of attention, and I was willing to do just about anything to get it.

That's why I found myself standing in front of a mysterious storefront one evening, worrying over whether to enter. It was small and dingy, with faded signs advertising palm reading and fortune telling. It didn't look like the kind of place I would normally visit, but I was desperate.

I pushed open the door and was greeted by the scent of incense and the sound of soft music. The shop was dimly lit, and I had trouble making out the figure seated behind a small table in the corner. As I approached, the woman looked up at me with piercing blue eyes that seemed to bore into my soul.

"Hello, my child," she said in a low, raspy voice. "What brings you to my humble abode?"

I hesitated, suddenly unsure of what to say. But the woman seemed to sense my unease and gestured for me to sit down.

"Tell me your troubles," she said. "I can help you."

I took a deep breath and spilled out everything. How I was tired of being invisible, how I longed for the attention of men, especially those construction workers. The fortune teller listened patiently, nodding her head as I spoke.

"Ah, I see," she said when I finished. "You want to be noticed. You want to be desired."

"Yes," I said eagerly. "Can you help me?"

The woman smiled a mysterious smile and reached out to take my hand.

"I can give you what you want," she said. "But be warned, my dear. There is always a price to pay for such things."

I didn't care about the price. I just wanted to be *seen*. The woman closed her eyes and began to mutter softly under her breath. I couldn't make out the words, but they sounded ancient and powerful. When she opened her eyes again, they were bright with a strange intensity.

"Your wish is granted," she said.

I thanked her and left the shop, feeling excited and a little bit scared. 

It wasn't until I stepped out onto the street that I realized my life had fundamentally changed. It seemed as if every man who passed by turned to look at me, their eyes lingering on my body. I sensed their gaze like a physical touch. But I wasn’t flattered, as I’d long fantasized I’d feel when men gazed hungrily at me. I felt uncomfortable and exposed.

At first, I tried to ignore the incident, thinking it was just a fluke. But as I walked down the street, the stares appeared to become more intense, more invasive. It wasn't just the construction workers who were looking at me now. It seemed as if it was every man I passed by, regardless of age or profession.

I began to feel like a piece of meat, constantly on display for the world to see. I felt violated, like I had lost all control over my own body. I tried to hurry back to the fortune teller, to get her to reverse what she had done. But every step seemed to take an eternity as I felt the weight of hundreds of male gazes upon me.

When I finally made it back to the storefront, I was panting and shaking with fear. But the shop was closed, the fortune teller nowhere to be seen. I realized with a sinking feeling that I was trapped, that I had been given a curse instead of a blessing.

I turned to run, but the night sky was now filled with countless pairs of glowing eyeballs, all fixated on me. I ran faster, my heart pounding in my chest, but the lecherous eyes followed me relentlessly. It was like they had a life of their own. 

I could hear their lewd whispers and feel their hunger, and I knew that I was in grave danger. I ran until I was out of breath, my legs aching and my lungs burning. But the lustful eyes were still there, still watching me, still waiting for me to adjust a bra strap or bend over to tie my shoe.

I don't know how long I ran, or how far I got. All I knew was that I couldn't stop, that I couldn't let those eyes catch me. And so I ran, into the pitch dark night, pursued by hundreds of pairs of glowing eyeballs only I could see.

At long last, and only by chance, I spied my apartment building. Fumbling with my key, dropping it, picking it up, I finally opened my door, tottered inside and collapsed on the couch. 

I passed out for who knows how long. What I’m certain of is that when I opened my eyes, I was entirely alone. No more leering eyes. No more sense of being scrutinized, rated and ranked. I laughed, I cried, I danced with joy. I was just *me*, not the object of obscene male fantasy. 

But then the headlights of a passing car swept my bedroom, exposing an army of floating eyes pressed against every window; peeking in, begging me to put on some sort of “girlie” show. Or whatever it is men crave when they switch on the “male gaze.” 

The eyes were lined up, row after row, peering in through the cracks in the blinds. Gawking. Sizing me up. I grabbed my wallet and raced for the door. Maybe I could break through their ranks, grab a bus or—I don’t know—just run faster than they could follow. I was willing to try anything.

Coming to my senses, if only for a moment, I stopped, looked through the peephole in my front door and there was a randy, delighted eye looking back at me. Out of options, I ran into my windowless bathroom, gathered up some bath towels and shoved them beneath the door to stop anything from peering in through the gap. Then I locked the door and curled up on the cold tiles. I started to shiver and couldn’t stop.  

I felt defeated. But with adversity comes inspiration, they say. 

Hours later, as the grind of garbage trucks announced the dawn of a new day, I stood up, brushed myself off and looked in the mirror. Grabbing a pair of shears, I chopped off my hair. Chunks fell into the basin, chunks of curly, ginger hair that had been my pride and joy. Then I removed my lipstick, makeup, earrings and rings. I gathered all my remaining beauty products and threw them away. I looked in the mirror again and saw a face even a doting mother would find hard to love. 

But I wasn’t done yet. I grabbed my sewing kit and feverishly went to work. I’ve always been a bit of a seamstress and an hour later had what I wanted: a ramshackle burka stitched together from the towels I’d shoved beneath the door.

I put on the burka, pulling the head covering over me. Lacking a veil, I strapped on a black, left-over Covid mask. Most of my womanly assets, the features that stimulated the male gaze, were now concealed. To complete the potentially life-saving disguise, I donned an oversized pair of sunglasses. 

Steeling myself, I walked into living room. There was nothing but sunshine streaming in between the cracks in the blinds. I ripped open the front door and skipped to the sidewalk like a schoolkid. Only ordinary people were out and about on a bright, cloudless day. Not a single eye was flying around. Maybe I was the excitable type and there never had been. Most women are like that, men say.

Suddenly thirsty, I cut across the busy street, weaving through oblivious drivers, mostly male, eyes fixed firmly on the traffic ahead. There was a Starbucks a block away, a few doors down from a small construction site. To get there, I would have to weave through a rough bunch of laborers in blue jeans and dirty t-shirts waiting in lines at food trucks.

I adjusted my burka to cover stray exposed flesh. This was the moment of truth. If anywhere, the toxic eyeballing would reappear here. 

Holding my breath, I dove into the crowd. But there were no catcalls, no whistles. Just vile mutterings and stares of a different kind. Like a magic cloak, the burka had transformed lust into hatred. 

I walked into the Starbucks with a heady sense of liberation. Wearing a burka all day and night was not a desirable fashion choice, but it beat the debilitating spotlight of the male gaze.

I smiled widely at the barista. “I’ll have an Orange Cream Latte and a raspberry scone.” 

“Sure enough,” she said, turning away to make my drink.

Which reminded me that I would have to pay. I reached into my pocket, hoping I’d remembered to bring my wallet. I’d stitched the burka together in such a blur…

“Oh my god,” I whispered, even though I wanted to shriek. There was a tepid, gooey substance affixed to the interior of the pocket. Carefully, I pried it away from the fabric and brought it up. This time I did shriek. There, cupped in the palm of my hand, looking like a spent penny balloon with an iris and pupil, was a burst human eye. 

The male gaze was real and still lukewarm. I held the evidence in my hand. 

Everyone in the Starbucks turned around to look at me. Everyone. Shrieking again, I rushed out, and kept shrieking as I elbowed my way through the construction workers, across the busy street and into my apartment. I slammed the door shut and pushed my couch in front of it. 

Finding a roll of masking tape, I sealed the gaps in my blinds and sealed them again for good measure. Exhausted, I staggered to the couch, clutched a pillow and began the terrifying wait.
