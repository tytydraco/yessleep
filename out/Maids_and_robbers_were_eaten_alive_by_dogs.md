Back in 1992, my dad and his colleague witnessed something truly stomach-churning during their duty as guards in a well-known subdivision in Singapore.

The subdivision they worked in had many large houses, but very few people lived there. Throughout the day, fewer than 15 cars would enter or leave. It was so quiet my dad called it a ghost town. 

When construction started at the back of the subdivision. The noise from their equipment was loud, but we never received complaints, likely because the residents rarely stayed home.

Two months after the construction began, a typhoon came, and unfortunately, only my dad and one of his co-worker showed up for duty.

The rain was heavy, and they were sheltering in the small guardhouse near the subdivision gate around 10 PM. They needed to report the subdivision's perimeter status to their superior officer (S.O.), so they went on rounds, braving the strong winds.

The sound of the wind blowing through the trees was deafening. Visibility was zero, but as they passed a storm drain, They noticed something red mixed with the water.

They immediately thought it was blood. They followed the trail, shining their flashlight on the flowing water. The road was inclined uphill, and at the top was a house. The blood was coming from the gate of that house, being pushed out by the water.

They knocked on the gate, but no one answered. His colleague peeked through the gate and saw a person's foot, but he couldn't see the entire body because the house blocked his view. My dad tried to call S.O., but no one answered. After several attempts, the call was suddenly marked as unattended.

Following protocol, my dad called the police since guards were no longer allowed to act on their own due to issues with the previous staff.

While my dad was calling the police, his colleague got curious and went around to the back of the house. He climbed at  the wall.

Before my dad could pull him down, he immediately climbed back down. He said "They're all gone."

My dad decided to climb to see what he's talking about and he saw five massive dogs—different breeds. They were drenched in rain but unfazed by it, feasting on the mangled upper torsos of three men. Two of the bodies had no heads, and the third still had a head but no jaw. The heads were the first parts the dogs ate. The men’s legs were nearly skeletonized, and the foot they saw by the gate had no body attached—just a foot.

Moments later, two dogs, one black and one brown with thick fur, were fighting over the intestines of the man who still had a head. The man’s eyes opened and stared crying, but a thin dog bit it, dragging him to a corner.

The police finally answered the call. My dad gave them the address and begged them to come quickly, saying there might be nothing left. He said that because he could see the dogs were determined to finish off the three men.

The police arrived at 1 AM. They told them what they saw. Even the police were horrified by the scene. The police told them to step back, and all they heard after that were gunshots.

Later, they learned that six largel dogs were killed by the police. One was found inside the house, chewing on human bones, while five were outside. Five people died—two maids and three men confirmed to be construction workers from the site behind the subdivision.

The next day, S.O. called my dad and his colleague to the office

They handed each of them $20,000 SGD in exchange for their silence. They also promised to transfer them to a different post. they said the subdivision’s management didn’t want the incident to go public. The families of the deceased had already been compensated, paid by the homeowners.

My dad later found out that the homeowners had entrusted their dogs to five maids while they went on vacation. However, three of the maids, who had been working there longer, left, leaving the two new maids who didn’t know how to care for the dogs.

The construction workers, who stayed at the site, had planned to rob the house.

But even the police couldn’t figure out how the dogs escaped or why they became so vicious.

My dad believe the maids didn’t feed the dogs after the homeowners left. Instead, they partied and abandoned the new maids, who didn’t know what to do. A week had passed since the homeowners left, so the dogs were likely starving. In desperation, they may have escaped and attacked.

To this day my dad is now 57 years old and still traumatised by dogs especially large dogs. That's why we only have cats in our house.
