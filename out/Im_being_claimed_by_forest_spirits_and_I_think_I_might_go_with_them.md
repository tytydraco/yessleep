We live in a small province up north, five hours away from the hustle and bustle of Metro Manila. It's a peaceful little town where everyone knows each other, you know the sort.  
The year was 1983. My mother, known as the town beauty, had long and silky black hair, a fair complexion, and dark beady eyes. Men would line up to ask for her hand in marriage, but she never took a liking to anyone. She was very introverted, and would often hang out by a small creek that leads to a nearby waterfall. She usually does her laundry there and spends hot summer afternoons swimming by the falls.  
On a bright and sunny day, she headed out to the creek and found a man swimming there. She said he didn't look like he was from around here and described him as tan, well-built, tall, and hazel-eyed. He didn't look like a foreign tourist and doesn't particularly resemble any nationality–all she could say was that he was handsome but he looked...different.  
Mom was instantly swept off her feet by the man, who refused to tell her his name whenever she asked. He was charming and funny, made her laugh, and was very easy to talk to. Every day since then they would meet up by the creek, and he would even help her with the laundry, but my mom found it strange that he never wanted to go anywhere else in town.  
Before she even knew it, my mom was falling head over heels for this guy. She was too afraid to ask him to come over to her house and meet her family as it all seemed too rash. To her surprise though, he asked first. He invited her to meet his family instead and gave her weirdly specific instructions. He told her to wear her Sunday's best, and meet him by the creek at dusk, just before the sunset. He said that it will be the last time they'll be meeting up and she can either come to elope with him or forget him after that.  
My mom didn't know what to do. She didn't want to elope with him but she also didn't want to stop seeing him. By the time she was able to make up her mind, it was almost too late. She decided that she would meet up with him one last time to say goodbye because she didn't want to leave her family behind for a stranger she barely knew.  
Dressed in her favorite blouse and skirt, she made her way to the creek and found the man waiting for her. He was dressed like a prince in all white garb, is all she could say. It was getting dark and she didn't want to stay out for long because the whole scene just felt....so wrong. In the middle of the creek was a colorful two-story pagoda boat lit up with lanterns and had a party on it in full swing. The best she could describe it was that everything was in white and gold–all of the people partying in the pagoda were dressed to the nines, dripping in jewelry, and enjoying the largest feast she had ever seen. To her, it didn't make sense how this huge pagoda could fit in the tiny creek, it gave her the feeling that she was witnessing something otherworldly. It simply felt wrong and there was this heavy sinking feeling in her gut.  
The man took her hand and as he was about to lead her to the pagoda, the music and partying stopped. Everyone's eyes were suddenly on her. She took a good look at the people in the pagoda and realized that they all looked a lot like the man–tan, luscious brown locks, hazel eyes–they all looked perfect and beautiful. She felt so small and out of place, underdressed, and unwelcome. It felt like an eternity until her legs kicked into full gear and she found herself running away from the scene as fast as she can.  
She never went back to the creek again and never went out later than 4 pm. My mom became an even larger introvert, it was hard for her to make friends and she would often just stay at home watching tv or reading pocketbooks.  
A few years later, she met the son of a traveling Chinese businessman who was in town for only a couple of weeks. Everything was all sunshine and rainbows again. He left with a promise to come back for her and they will get married by then, but she never saw him again.  
My mom found herself pregnant with me shortly afterward and tried her best to contact my father. She carried me to term and had my grandparents help her in raising me. She never stopped trying to reach him and would even send him photos of me as I was growing up. The only time he replied to her letters was to tell her that I don't look anything like him and that she was probably a whore who got knocked up by another man. In his defense, I had brown curly hair, tan skin, and almond-shaped bright brown eyes. I looked nothing like someone who was of Chinese descent, and I don't even look anything like my mom or the rest of her family.  
I've always had a difficult relationship with my mom. I felt like a burden, and she would even go out of her way to tell me that I was cursed. She says the most hurtful things whenever she's angry at me. One time, she even confessed that when I was a baby, she tried drowning me in that cursed creek where she met the strange man. But I was too cursed to die, I guess. Authorities found me washed up on a river bank and returned me to my family. I never really felt any deep love for her because all I knew was that she hated me. My mom left town when I was 10 and never looked back. From then on I only had my grandparents. I never bothered keeping in touch with her. It was clear that she left to get away from me.  
I never paid attention to the rumors. A small town like this loves to gossip and my mom's name had always been on everyone's lips because of her past. It never stopped hurting but I've learned to live with it.  
One time when I was in sixth grade, I skipped class and hung out in the chapel near my school. The chapel is always empty during the weekdays and is probably the most peaceful corner in town where I could hide out from everyone. Something was calling me to look out the window. It was a cloudy afternoon and I had nothing better to do. I'd never noticed this before, but out in the distance was a sparkly mountain that captivated me. Our little town is surrounded by hills and rainforests, and this mountain from afar suddenly stuck out like a sore thumb. I was curious.  
I had this overwhelming feeling of wanting to go to it, and so I did. I started walking in its general direction. I couldn't remember how long I'd been walking, but I didn't feel tired at all.  
The next thing I remember was an old woman grabbing my arm and shaking me violently out of my trance. As I was coming into awareness of where I am, I noticed that it was now dark and I don't recognize the road or any of the nearby houses. The old woman asked who my parents are and I told them my grandma's name. "Ah Christ, you are Belinda's apo (grandchild)! Let me take you back to your lola (grandma)," she said and escorted me back to my grandparents' house. Before she left, she scolded me: "Be thankful that I caught you in time or you would have never been seen again!"  
This confused the hell out of me. I'm just a clueless sixth grader who suddenly found a side quest. "You have already reached the border of the town and you were heading out to the woods, why?" she continued. I said something like "I was trying to follow a mountain" and tried to point it out. She swatted my hand to stop me from pointing. "Hija," she whispered, "you were being escorted by a parade of strange people when I found you. Don't ever walk with strangers again, and don't ever go out after dark!"  
A parade? I was pretty sure that I was walking alone. I never forgot that day. I still think about it and what could’ve happened to me.  
My grandparents don't have much. They owned a small sari-sari store and a vegetable garden and made enough to send me to school. I applied for a scholarship in college and was able to study in Manila. Landed a job, and had a quiet life. I would send back money to my grandparents to help with their expenses.  
Covid claimed my grandpa, so I had to return to our hometown to take care of my grandma. A few months later, she passed away too. Now it's just me in this tiny house with no one but a few cats to keep me company.  
I don't plan on going back to Manila anymore. I don't really have much to go back to anyway. I found it hard to make friends who really cared and never liked anyone else enough to be in a romantic relationship. It was always just me and my grandparents and now they're gone.  
Earlier today, a man knocked on our door and was asking if my grandparents were here. I relayed the sad news and explained that it was just me now. He offered to tend to my grandma's garden as he told me that he knew my grandma had a green thumb and she would be sad if she knew that her garden was not being taken care of. I'd never seen this man before, but he seemed genuine enough so I didn't mind.  
Come to think of it, he felt very familiar. He had tan skin, thick brown hair, and hazel eyes. He looked a lot like me–something I thought I'd never say or even think of anyone. We could be easily mistaken as siblings. He said that he was good friends with my mom, although I highly doubt that since we look the same age and my mom hasn't been here since the late 90s.  
He asked if I would be interested in joining him to attend a party later. "Where?" I asked. He answered, "It's just a little picnic by the creek" with the biggest smile on his face.  
I think I'll go.
