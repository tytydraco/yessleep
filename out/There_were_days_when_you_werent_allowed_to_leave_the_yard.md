There were about ten of those each month.

Personally, I found it hard to tell such days apart, but the adults recognized them by some signs of their own, adult ones. On those days life seemed to go on as usual: everyone laughed, talked loudly, played games. Grandpa and Dad would take out the chessboard, checkers, lotto, cards; concerts were shown on TV. Mom and Grandma cooked especially delicious food, and we ate outside, in the yard, under the big cherry tree. And yet there was something strained and artificial about all this festivity.

Grandma and Mom walked around pale, with tight smiles. They spoke about good things, but their eyes kept darting around. Dad and Grandpa tried to joke, but the jokes were awkward and not funny. When they had to leave the yard by car on those days—and that was the only safe way to get outside at that time—they prepared for it for a long while, grim and somehow sad. What upset me most was that for ten whole days I wouldn’t see my friends. I even tried once to break the rules and sneak out of the yard—Vladik lived next door, after all, two minutes from his gate to mine, what could possibly happen? I didn’t make it out: Mom spotted me in time, and Dad gave me a proper whipping for it. That was the only time in my life I was beaten. After that I didn’t tempt fate again and entertained myself with everything that fell within the bounds of our yard, from the vegetable garden to the gate.

Why wasn’t I allowed to go out? As a child I didn’t know, and after the whipping I didn’t much feel like asking. But from my parents’ half-whispered conversations in the kitchen I understood that out there, in the street, someone was around—and not the dogs or wolves common to rural areas, but someone else.

From the age of ten, the fence and the gate also became a forbidden zone for me—and the belt had nothing to do with it. That day my ball rolled toward the gate, and I ran after it. I remembered that it was one of those days when you weren’t allowed to leave the yard, but I wasn’t going to—I just needed to grab the ball that had rolled to the fence. Besides, the day was so fine: birds were singing, the sun was shining, so nothing bad even crossed my mind.

I ran up to the fence, grabbed the ball hiding by the gate, and was about to bolt back into the depths of the yard when I saw a girl standing just beyond the fence. She had a kerchief tied under her chin and was staring at me from under her brows. Her malicious, piercing gaze startled me so much that I froze in place—struck not so much by the fact that she had come out into the street on such a day, or that she was standing by our fence peering into our yard, but by the strange, childish hatred in her eyes. And the longer I looked at her, the uglier her face seemed, until I realized she wasn’t a girl at all, but some small—shorter than ten-year-old me—nasty old crone.

When I burst into my parents’ room, she was still standing by the window. I threw myself into Mom’s arms and babbled:

“There was some strange old woman there—she was looking into our yard!”

“What are you talking about, Sasha? You imagined it,” Mom replied gently and kissed me, holding me close. But I could hear how hard her heart was pounding, and I remembered the way she had looked toward the gate when I ran away. I understood then that she had seen everything.

So for two thirds of the month life went on as usual: we went to school, walked the streets, fished in the river, gathered mushrooms in the forest. And for the remaining third we stayed locked inside our yards. Only those who had cars could leave—while you were in the car, nothing could happen to you. But when I asked to go somewhere with Dad and Grandpa on those days, they would grimly brush me off and say I might see things I shouldn’t.

What exactly those “things” were, I understood at fourteen. Usually during those ten days Mom and Grandma didn’t leave the yard but calmly worked in the vegetable garden adjoining it. Later they gave that up too. It happened after we saw the old woman.

We were having dinner in the yard when I heard strange sounds, like a cat trying to cough up a hairball, and noticed everyone staring somewhere behind me with square, frozen eyes. I turned around and saw a bent-over old woman walking through our garden, twitching all over as if trying to hold back vomiting. After a few more steps she suddenly braced her hands on her knees and vomited her own intestines right onto our strawberries. After disgorging about two meters of her guts, she lifted her skirts, squatted over the bed, and more of her intestines crawled out of her. Then she stood up, brushed herself off, and slowly limped on. We never discussed this incident in the family, avoided it as something indecent.

There were other cases, too. I remember once we stayed out in the yard until dark, and suddenly there was loud knocking at the gate. Turning around, I saw several people standing behind the fence, pale-faced, all short. It was too dark to make out details, but I saw one of them push his head between the slats of the fence and smile.

“Just don’t look at them. They can’t come in on their own,” Mom explained, and everyone went back to laughing and talking. But later I glanced that way a few more times, and they were still there—climbing the fence, twisting the handle, smiling at me.

“There’s nobody there. I’ve been walking around all these days, haven’t seen anyone. Come on, let’s go to Yaroslav’s to play on the computer.”

Yaroslav was the only boy in the village who had a computer.

Reluctantly, I went toward the gate. On one hand, I didn’t want to disobey my parents—who knew what could happen out there on those days. On the other, I didn’t want to lose face in front of an older guy. Anton smiled encouragingly, and I noticed that his teeth were somehow small and uneven, growing one on top of another, as if in three rows. And his eyes seemed like Anton’s—black—but they squinted strangely, as if looking slightly in different directions. I stopped. I was close enough now to see that this was someone who looked like Anton, but wasn’t him at all.

“What?” Anton asked, still smiling. And his voice was wrong too—not his at all. I turned and bolted into the house. Looking back, I saw he hadn’t left and was watching me with that same strange smile.

There was another case, completely incomprehensible. I knew that if you were in a car, there was nothing to fear—especially if you drove straight into the yard and then quickly shut the gate. But that didn’t protect you from what you might see through the window. That day we urgently had to go to the city, and we went—me, Dad, and Grandpa. When we were returning and pulling up to the house, I saw some boy walking through our yard, going out through the gate—which for some reason was open—into the street and heading toward us, walking backward. We stopped; the boy passed by us. I turned around and saw that it was me—walking, grinning widely, wearing clothes I’d never owned in my life. Dad and Grandpa didn’t see anything—or pretended not to. When we got out of the car, I turned again and saw the boy still moving away from us backward, smiling and looking straight at me. The gate turned out to be locked, and when I later asked Mom if she had seen anyone in our yard, she was surprised and said no.

In general, for this very reason it was customary for us to always keep the yard gates closed, even if nothing strange had happened for a long time. Those strange people who sometimes wandered the streets couldn’t, for some reason, open even the simplest gate without a latch or bolt—but if it was open, they could easily walk into the yard. That was usually exactly what they were trying to do.

“Is it really that hard for you to open the gate?!” Vladik yelled. “Your stupid bolt’s jammed—do you get that or not?! I can’t get in!”

I turned around and silently went back into the house. There was no bolt on our gate.

After that, both Yaroslav and Vladik called me several more times, trying to lure me outside during the bad days, but they all failed the gate test, even though on normal days they could easily walk into my yard. Over time they got smarter, inviting me over by phone. When I refused to come, they got angry and showered me with choice insults. I wasn’t worried about it. My real friends were getting the same calls supposedly from me, and the false me couldn’t get into their yards either.

What would happen if you let yourself be lured out of the house or yard, or ran into one of those strange people on the street? I didn’t know for sure, but I had often heard about the tragedy that happened to a young woman from our village. Her name was either Olya or Yulia, and she had once lived on a neighboring street. She was out walking with her baby and saw something so frightening that she ran away in terror, leaving the infant in the stroller. She came home in tears; her husband, parents, and neighbors immediately gathered and went to the place where she’d left the baby, but they found only an empty stroller. When the search failed, the family abandoned their house and left the village. What was it she saw that made her flee and abandon her child? The parents refused to say.

I looked out the window and saw that it really was my mom walking around the yard in some strange dirty sweater, as if taken off a homeless person. Sometimes she would stop, bend down, and start digging in the ground with her hands. And then Mom’s voice sounded in the receiver:

“Son, just make sure you lock all the doors and don’t open if there’s knocking. She’ll leave on her own.”

I can’t say that what was happening frightened me very much. There were days when leaving the yard was forbidden and I would deliberately sit on the windowsill, waiting to see something like that outside. Often I managed to see Mom or Grandma or Grandpa walking down the street, while I could hear their voices in the next room and knew they were home. Sometimes I saw relatives working in our garden or a neighbor’s—relatives who lived in another settlement and couldn’t possibly be there. Once I saw myself knocking at the gate and calling for Mom to let me in. But most often I saw fires in the ravine, which, as Mom explained, didn’t actually exist. I saw black smoke and tongues of flame in the distance, but understood that they weren’t really there, and that was a strange feeling. I also saw a black Volga driving through the streets, more often through the ravine. When it passed near our house, I could see that there was no one inside. Grandma once let slip that back in Soviet times some city folk had come to the ravine in a black Volga, gotten drunk, and started a fire. Part of the forest burned down; people and animals died. Ever since then the ravine burns from time to time, and that car drives through the village.

If before that people had somehow endured what was happening, unwilling to abandon their settled lives, the deaths of children were the last straw. By that time my mom had given birth to my little brother, and it was decided to move for the baby’s safety. It took more than a year, though, and for a long time we were still tormented by boys knocked down by the Volga, walking the streets after their funerals and calling my little brother out to play. But eventually we managed to leave that place.

I can say that the events described didn’t affect my mental health. At seventeen, thanks to certain benefits and my fairly good grades, I managed to enroll in a university on a state-funded place and was given a room in a city dormitory. Over time my father found a decent job in the same city, so my parents and little brother soon followed. Grandpa, unfortunately, is no longer alive, but according to Grandma, it’s hardly noticeable. She still sometimes sees him sleeping in the yard or walking down the street outside the window, so she isn’t lonely.
