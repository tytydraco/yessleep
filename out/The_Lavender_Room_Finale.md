I stood behind the table, dealing cards as I had been for what seemed to be my entire adult life, even though I knew that wasn't right. I had lived and worked elsewhere just a short time before, though I could no longer visualize either place in my mind. I also couldn't remember what my own parents looked like. That realization had broken me out of the haze that had seemingly settled over my brain. I tried to leave the table, but my feet seemed nailed to the floor. I felt the forced smile coming to my face and I wanted to scream. I couldn't of course but the urge itself was painful.

When I got off the clock went to my room where I was able to show pain, the tears slipping silently from my eyes. I laid in my bed and wiped at the salty trails that the fat droplets left on my cheeks and felt an emotion besides despair for the first time in what seemed like weeks. I was angry. My jaw setting and teeth grinding together as my fists folded themselves into tight balls. I was determined to find my way out of that opulent purple hell. I just needed to figure out how to break away.

The next morning, I left the building again and when I stepped outside, the sunlight hurt my eyes. I tried to remember how long ago it had been since I left, and my memory again failed me. I also couldn't recall which car was mine, and as such I reached into my pocket and grabbed my keys, thumb finding the panic button. The noise directed me to the correct vehicle and I unlocked the doors as I approached. I had no idea where I was going but I needed to put some distance between myself and the building which increasingly felt like a prison.

I navigated through the city aimlessly, and the further I got from The Lavender Room, the worse the aches and pains in my body hurt, and the more sensitive to the light I became. I began to think that I might die if I stayed away too long, and before I realized I had done it, had turned around and was driving back toward the place. The closer I got, the better I felt. I pulled the car over a few blocks away, sitting on a quiet side street between two nearly abandoned buildings. I didn't want to go back, but knew that I had to.

I drove as slowly as possible, and sat behind the wheel for a while, and when I did exit my vehicle, I stared at it, trying to embed the image in my mind. I thought that maybe if I had something to hold onto from the outside world, maybe I could break whatever hold that the place had on me. The image faded from my mind before I went to bed that night, however. I woke the next day with a feeling of sadness in my chest. I didn't know why I felt the way I did, but it was so heavy. I was feeling terrible as I got ready for my shift.

I had been working the early mornings since my altercation with Matt. It wasn't quite a punishment, but at the same time, it was practically dead barring other employees which gave me nothing but time to think, and to realize how helpless I actually was. I was standing there, feeling sorry for myself when a new face took a seat at my table. My heart sunk to the bottom of my feet, but I couldn't do or say anything to warn the young man. When he began to win I wanted to scream in his face to run away.

“Another hand, sir?” was all I could say when I opened my mouth.

To my pure dismay he nodded his head. I swept away the old cards and drew new ones for him as well as myself.

“Of course, why quit while I'm winning?” he said with a confident grin. I pitied him even as I detected a subtle alteration in the atmosphere, like someone dimming the light directly over my table.

He lost the next two hands in a row, and that caused him to move to a different table in frustration. An hour or so later, I saw the man leaving. I spent the rest of that morning trying to wrap my head around what had happened. Just as I was handing off the deck shoe to Nadine, I felt something else. Another change in the overall atmosphere, the place seemingly becoming brighter. For the first time that day I noticed the fresh flowers on the tables of the clubhouse as I made my way to the bar there. Joe approached and poured my usual drink.

“What's the special occasion?' I asked, gesturing to one of the vases containing the colorful blossoms.

“We're getting a visit from the owner today. He's having a party.” the bartender answered, a tremor of excitement in his deep voice.

It was the first time I had heard of it. For a moment, he wondered if Matt and Nadine knew about it and had been keeping it from me. I swallowed the last bit of whiskey in my glass and stood, making my way back to the stairs and down to the gambling floor to approach Nadine.

“Hey, how's it going?” I asked as I took a seat at the empty blackjack table.

“Okay. I'm surprised to see you out here.” she shot back.

“Yeah, I guess it's a special occasion though.” I replied, voice heavy on the accusatory tone. I pulled a few chips from my pocket and placed them on the table.

The woman had the grace to look slightly embarrassed.

“Matt and I thought it best if we just didn't tell you, considering your behavior lately.” she admitted as I moved one of the clay discs into the betting circle.

She dealt us both our cards and I peered at the one that was face down. I stood, and the dealer flipped another card. Bust.

“My behavior?” I echoed.

“To be honest we don't want you asking Mr. Breaux the same questions you have been asking us.” she replied, her face a mixture of emotions. I thought, for a moment I saw a flicker of pain in her eyes.

I made another bet, and went quiet as another regular, a haggard-looking woman in a blue dress joined us at the table, interrupting our conversation. I played a few more hands before moving on, heading back up to the first floor, settling in at my usual table where I made my lunch order. I ate slowly, my eyes on the entrance to the place, waiting for the moment the man in the purple suit would enter. He walked in just around the time I was finishing my drink, surrounded by people dressed just as flamboyantly as he was.

I forced myself to focus on Mr. Breaux's face, though that was hard to do. He was almost too perfect, with a strong jawline and clear blue eyes, or were they green? I couldn't tell, much like I couldn't pin down his hair color. Sometimes it appeared blonde, other times a dark brown and even black at others. I had to get closer, but I didn't want to make my approach obvious, so I mixed into a small group of regulars near the bar.

“Off the clock, are we?” one of the men said with a smile.

I nodded. I recognized his face but his name was escaping me. Mostly because I was distracted. I ordered a drink the next time that the serving girl made her rounds and as time passed, the group of well-dressed people made their way toward the bar, and when Mr. Breaux got near me, I felt dizzy, and tried to maintain my focus, but very quickly failed. My head spun and I felt intoxicated, as if I had taken shots of high proof alcohol. The smell of the man's cologne brought happy memories to my mind. Just simple things I had forgotten.

I dug my fingernails into the palms of my hands. That helped to bring me back to my senses. I finally managed to find my voice, speaking up.

“Excuse me, Mr. Breaux, may I have a word with you?” I managed to ask in spite of the physical discomfort that I felt when speaking.

The look he gave me was brief, no more than a heartbeat, but it was chilling. I could see that his eyes were neither blue, nor green, but in fact a light brown. His hair was the same color, and his skin tone seemed darker than I remembered as well. It was as flawless as I first thought, however. He nodded his head and made a slight sweeping gesture with his far hand.

“Of course, please join me in your office.” he said, plastering a fake smile onto his plastic lips.

When I focused, I could see him as he was. A surgically altered mimic of a human being with hollow eyes. All of his charm filtered away into the either, and I found myself disgusted by him. Then I would accidentally drop my guard and inhale through my nose, and suddenly, he seemed perfect again. My head felt like it was stuffed with cotton and everything just seemed more vibrant. It seemed to take a very long time to reach the office, but we finally did. Once inside he locked the door behind us and the smile left his face, being replaced by a slight downturn of his botox-laden lips.

“I hear you've been asking a lot of questions lately.” Mr. Breaux said quietly, all of the usual bravado and cheer gone from his voice.

“I've been having some disturbing things happening to me.” I replied, once again forcing myself to focus. To stay present.

“How are you doing that?” he mumbled, almost to himself.

I smelled the woody, musky odor of his cologne, and my head spun. I clenched my fists, again digging my nails into my own flesh. This time I drew blood.

“Doing what?” I asked, feigning innocence even as I felt the urge to give in, to switch my brain off and to go play some blackjack, or dance until my legs and lungs burned.

“Not succumbing.” he replied, all pretense dropped, and in that moment, I had another realization.

Beneath the fine clothing, and proper speech and otherwise carefully crafted image. I had noticed something about his forehead. Two small knobs just below the hairline. Even the plastic surgery was fake. It I also noticed the strange stance he took when in private. Or maybe it was because I was seeing through the illusion finally. Mr. Breaux was not a human, just wearing the skin of one though what he was exactly, I didn't know. I dug my nails deeper into the skin of my palms. I looked into his eyes, the pupils rectangular, the irises a honey-yellow shade.

My expression must have mirrored the disgust I felt.

“How can you see me?” the strange goat-human hybrid demanded to know.

I didn't answer, and my silence seemed to further infuriate him. He lowered his head and charged, the man hitting me square in the chest with the top of his skull. It felt like getting hit with a warclub. I felt my feet leave the ground and I landed hard on my back and the back of my head. Stars exploded in front of my eyes. I started to get up but one of his cloven hooves shot out catching me in the chest before I could even begin to recover my breath. I managed to save my head this time, and then rolled over onto my stomach.

I managed to get back to my feet and the next time he charged, I side-stepped him and as he passed me by, I aided him in ramming the wall from behind, pivoting on one leg to give him as hard a shove as I could manage. It worked, and the impact seemed to stun my assailant. He didn't fall however, simply took two small staggering steps backward. I took my opportunity to escape the office and started running. The ascent to the main building seemed to take forever and the incline quickly made my legs start to burn and wobble.

I didn't let myself stop, even when I got to the parking lot. I forced my legs and arms to keep pumping until I physically could not run anymore, collapsing in a heap in the middle of a rather crowded park. When I came to, I felt like utter garbage. Everything hurt, and moving made me feel as if I were going to throw up. I couldn't even open my eyes for a long time. When I did, I found myself in a hospital room. The doctor informed me that I had three broken ribs and some other minor injuries, but they were also keeping me for observation due to some kind of infection.

I was thankful for that because the way that I felt, I would have went back to the Lavender Room if I would have been left to my own devices. I was already thinking about it, having fantasies and dreams of pulling the IV from my arm and walking out of the hospital in nothing but the gown. I could almost feel the wind on my exposed flesh. I would snap out of it, still securely laid out in the adjustable bed. After a few moments I would relax, and though the urge to return to that place was strong, I managed to stay put.

As the infection in my body began to weaken due to the antibiotics and fluids being pumped into my body, I began to feel less pain and temptation to return. By the time I was discharged, I didn't even want to go claim my car. I did, however. The cab ride to the building took an impossibly long time. I stared out of the window, and as we approached the run-down, industrial area I took note of the fact that once again most of the lots were deserted again. My car was the only one parked outside of the building, and that made me curious.

I dismissed the taxi, and reached into my back pocket, extracting my wallet. I knew it was a bad idea, but I extracted the purple card from my wallet. I didn't need it, however. The door was sitting ajar, and the keypad had been removed. The building looked as if it had been vacant for decades. They were gone.

Mr. Breaux, Matt, Joe, Nadine. All just gone as if they had never been there in the first place.
