It’s a big jump between those two options. I get that, but at this point I truly cannot tell what the truth is.

I think there needs to be a bit of context here. I’m twenty-four and live in the UK but I was born in New Zealand and that’s where my parents and brother still reside. I moved abroad after university and haven’t seen my family since before the pandemic. There’s… a lot of history there. Like most families we have unresolved issues. The short of it is my parents and brother get along great—a complete unit—and I’m the odd one out.

I think it’s also important to admit I have been diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder. The rest of my family is “normal”.

2024 was the year I finally came home for Christmas. New Zealand, being southern hemisphere, has a summer Christmas and I have desperately missed that. Birmingham can be so grim in winter even with the Christmas decorations. I grew up with a summer Christmas. Barbecues, trips to the beach, a family game of touch rugby. That’s what I missed. Maybe coming back would remind me that all those bad feelings I had about my family were just part of my own histrionics. That’s something I’d been working on with a therapist: learning to accept that I had a catastrophising tendency and things weren’t always as bad as I remembered them.

In New Zealand summer homes are called baches. Our family one was near the beach in a town called Ōtaki. That’s where we always spent Christmas. On the drive up my parents revealed my brother (we’ll call him Johnny) was bringing his girlfriend (Emmy).

This is where things get weird. I’d heard a lot about Emmy. My parents adored her and it was hard not to feel a little jealous. They spoke about it as if she was such a natural fit in the family. They’d all gone to Australia together (didn’t invite me) and done a life-changing Outback tour. I saw the photos on Facebook but Emmy was always the one taking the photo. She was never in any frame.

Admittedly, I’d spent a few late nights stalking Johnny’s social media to try and gain more insight into Emmy. I had to admit to my therapist that a part of me wished they’d break up so my parents could see I wasn’t replaceable with some other girl. I hated those feelings even if they were intrusive.

Emmy had an Instagram but it was locked down. All I could see was her tiny little profile pic: a mannequin head with a black wig. That told me nothing about her. Or I thought it didn’t. 

My parents and I arrived first to the bach. Johnny and Emmy were coming up the next morning. It was hard to listen to my parents talk about all the memories they’d made since I’d been away. They’d retired, gone on cruises, tours, and made a comfortable life for themselves. They couldn’t stop gushing about how great Emmy was for Johnny and how proud they were of my brother and what he’d accomplished. Not once did they ask me what I was up to or what was going on in my life. Not much was going on, to be honest. I had an admin job with no upward mobility and I’d never had a serious boyfriend to write home about. Everything I’d done since getting my degree was disappointing. I’d barely even travelled the UK and Europe (fucking Brexit and a pandemic) because it was expensive enough going to Tesco.

We saw the VW Golf pulling up the next morning. The favourite child had arrived! I made sure to bring enough anxiety medication on this trip. I almost considered doubling my dose just to make it through this Christmas. 

Johnny came in with the luggage. His dog barged past him and jumped right on me. I hated dogs. I was actually scared of them. He didn’t tell me he was bringing a dog. By the time I got back from the bathroom and calmed myself down Emmy and Johnny were on the couch in the living space. This may seem pedantic, but in the bach we all had our sitting spaces. Dad got the green armchair, mum got the rattan chair, and Johnny and I got the couch. He sat on the left and I sat on the right. Emmy, of course, was sitting in my seat. That’s what I noticed first before I even figured out what else was amiss.

Awkwardly, I went to the kitchen to get myself a spare chair and pulled it up to the conversation. Only then did I get a proper look at Emmy. 

It was a mannequin. She had a black wig on, but no facial detail. Only the faint outline of eyes, lips, and a petite nose. I could see the bendable joints had been positioned so she was sitting rigidly upright.

“Oh,” I said, laughing with surprise. I assumed it was a joke. “Where’s, uh. Where’s Emmy?”

Everyone looked at me as if I’d grown a second head. Johnny looked at the mannequin as if it was talking then back at me.

“This IS Emmy,” he stated flatly. “You gone blind or something?”

I looked to my parents to search for any answers. Neither of them had humorous expressions. They looked more concerned that I was going to ruin Emmy’s trip. 

Okay, I’d play along. See how far this joke went.

“Sorry, hi, Emmy,” I said, awkwardly putting out my hand to shake. I looked at the rest of them for approval.

Emmy did not shake my hand. No shock. Awkwardly, I retracted it. A moment of silence, then they all laughed at a joke I hadn’t heard. 

The dog jumped on the couch and started licking the page-white plastic of the mannequin’s face. Johnny laughed.

“Such a momma’s boy.”

—

The joke did not relent. I went to my “room” (my brother and I used to share a room but now I had been put in the sleepout so he could share with the giant doll) and tried to regroup. My family had never been pranksters. This seemed excessive and like an exhausting show to put on. Was it going to be like this all Christmas? 

It was time to get some answers. I was too afraid to ask them directly because of how I was ostracised, so I went to call Grandma. Her and I had an affinity that I didn’t have with the rest of my family. I tried to ring her but she didn’t pick up. Not too surprising given she was staying with my uncle and his kids for Christmas. She’d probably left her phone off.

My Mum swung by the sleepout with a very stern expression.

“Why are you hiding out here?” she demanded. “You’re worrying everyone.”

I apologised and said I would be back in soon. Mum started sliding the door shut and then paused.

“Also, we need you to get over whatever you’ve got against Emmy. She was sensing that you didn’t like her. She’s a lovely gal and I don’t want her to feel unwelcome this Christmas. So, get yourself together and at least pretend you care about this family.”

Those words pierced me like icicles. She slid the door shut before I could even reply. If her goal had been to hurry me up to come inside it only slowed me down because now I was crying. Why were they making me feel so guilty over a doll? It was just cruel.

Dinner came and went. I watched Emmy out of the corner of my eye, but tried my best to play along. Laughing with the family laughed, asking questions to Johnny about how they met. They served her a plate of food but she didn’t eat any of it. Not surprising.

Her position only changed when I was out of the room or not looking. My family must’ve been moving her. It was very unsettling. I moved to take my plate to the sink and when I looked back her head had been turned to face me. I shuddered and ignored it, doing my best to keep up a smile.

As adults we didn’t exchange Christmas gifts anymore. I still brought them back little trinkets from the UK, but they didn’t get anything for me. It was just a coincidence they all got each other a gift, including for Emmy. She got a bottle of perfume from Mum and Dad and a beach towel and swimsuit from Johnny. I had brought her a little statue of a bull since it was iconic to Birmingham. Maybe my family would start pretending it was a real bull and the joke would get bigger.

We went to the beach as was a Kiwi tradition on Christmas Day. I forgot to bring a bloody swimsuit because it was hard to pack for summer when you were living in winter. I put on shorts and brought my Kindle. Mum took Johnny’s dog for a walk along the beach while Dad and Johnny went into the water. That left Emmy and I on the beach towels together. She was “sunbathing” and by that I mean she was lying completely flat with sunglasses plopped over her eyeless face. 

“It’s absolute crap that they’re playing this game with me,” I told her. She did not respond. “Pretending you’re real and all that. It’s not funny at all. I don’t get why they’re doing it. Is it just because they hate me?”

I rolled onto my side and plucked the glasses off her face and put them on myself. She didn’t need them. I then flicked her face. Sure enough, plastic. 

Mum came back first. Her smile instantly faded when she looked at Emmy. 

“What’s wrong, darling?” she crouched down and “listened” to what the mannequin had to say.

She said my name with all the scorn of a mother finding a child who broke the fine china. “Why would you say those horrible things to Emmy? What is wrong with you?”

Johnny and Dad seemed to hear the commotion and came out of the water. I was now sitting upright, legs hugged to my chest as protection. Johnny looked so furious I was actually worried he’d hit me. 

“You assaulted her?” he asked. “Fucking Christ. Did you come back from England just to make the rest of us as miserable as you?”

It all felt like a nightmare. How could they have known what I said and done to Emmy when none of them were around? Maybe they had some sort of audio recording device inside her, but at that point I was beginning to doubt myself.

The ride back to the bach was painfully silent. I shot off to the sleepout and began to pack my things. I don’t know if it was just a joke or if I was insane. Either way, I had to get away from here. I wasn’t wanted and I’d made things worse. 

I ordered an Uber to take me to Paraparaumu so I could get the train back to Wellington. I’d find some accomodation and get my flights changed so I could fly home earlier. Surely some hotels would have some room even if it was Christmas Day. 

Nobody came out to say goodbye as the car pulled up. I was grateful for that. I didn’t want anymore conflict. Only as I was driven away did I look back and see the mannequin standing in the window looking out at me. 

Grandma got back to me later. She didn’t know about what had happened at the bach yet.

“Have you met Emmy?” I asked shakily. “Johnny’s, uh, girlfriend?”

“I have!” she said joyfully. “She’s a bit quiet, but she’s a lovely girl. I’m so glad you get to meet her this Christmas.”

I had a lot of time to think during the thirty hours of transit back to the UK. The entire experience felt so surreal. When my workmates asked how my trip was I didn’t mention any of the details about Emmy. Nothing had ever made me question my reality more in my entire life.

Maybe I was experiencing some sort of psychosis stemming from my anxiety about seeing my family. Maybe they had set up some elaborate trick because they hated me so much and wanted me to stay away forever. Either option is horrifying.
