When I open my eyes, the first thing I feel is the icy dampness seeping through my waterproof suit. The fabric crackles against my skin with every movement, as if it wasn’t made for me. Above, the interwoven trees form a canopy so dense that almost no light filters through. The forest seems to be holding its breath.

I push myself up slowly, my head heavy, my heart racing too fast. Nothing. Not a memory. Not a name. Not a familiar voice. Just… these numbers.
765344
I know them without knowing why, carved somewhere in my mind like a burn.

I try to remember how I got here, but every cognitive effort meets only a cold, oppressive void. My gaze falls on my gloved hands, then on my suit: dark yellow, reinforced, perfectly airtight. Like equipment designed for… what? Exploration? Survival?

A rustling sound echoes behind me.

I freeze.

It’s not the wind. Not an animal either. The sound is too slow, too monotonous. A background noise.

The numbers pulse in my head, growing stronger and stronger, like a word on the tip of my tongue that I can’t quite recall.

I walk for a long time, fighting off panic. But when we remember nothing, what is there to be afraid of?

My feet are too small for the boots attached to my suit.

I notice no zipper or opening that would allow me to undress.

As I walk in the shadow of the trees, I see an old rotary phone hanging by its cord in the middle of the forest.
It is perfectly intact, placed there as if it had been waiting to be picked up, even though no dwelling exists for miles around.
The silence around it seems to restrain itself, as if the forest were listening for a dial tone that never comes.

I end up dialing the numbers whose litany I’ve been repeating for hours.

It takes a long time but after a certain number of rings, the call connects.

First, a heavy silence. Then I hear a voice that sounds disturbed.

I try to say that I need help, but the line eventually cuts.

I hear the phone ringing again, but it’s not the one in front of me.

The sound travels through the mist and the dense forest, and I can’t tell where it comes from. I decide to find the source, as my headache shifts into a painful pressure on my temples.

Later, I fall into a crevice between two trees and injure my arm. My suit is torn, and blood runs slowly down my arm before stopping at my wrist. With my other hand, I press the wound, hoping to stop the bleeding. Strangely, I feel no pain. Lifting my arm slightly, I notice my skin is intact. No trace of a deep cut. Instead, I find a sequence of five numbers.

39526

My memory is failing, but it’s clear that the ones on my arm are different from those engraved in my temporal lobe.

I keep moving, searching for the source of the ringing.

I finally reach it.
A yellow phone.
Similar to the first one I found.

The closer I get, the hotter it becomes inside my suit, to the point that condensation forms on my helmet visor.

Since I’m already exposed to the open air and it seems I can’t really get hurt, I decide to tear my suit open, starting at the hole.

The rising heat and the resistance of the polypropylene fabric don’t make it easy. The phone’s ringing pierces my ears, and horror unfolds before my eyes.

The more my skin is exposed to the air, the more numbers I discover. Hundreds of five-digit combinations. Not tattooed, but brutally carved. The scabs have necrotized and turned brown.

The hope I’d placed in the suit’s tear on my forearm as a possible ticket out of this endless forest evaporates. I have no idea what to do anymore.

The ringing grows even louder, and the pressure in my skull becomes unbearable.

In a burst of survival instinct, I grab the receiver and listen. The ringing stops instantly.

Nothing. Except a tone that beeps 11 times.

Mad with frustration at having no control, I dial a random combination of numbers carved into my thigh.

Silence.
Not even a dial tone.

I hang up and lift the receiver again to try a new sequence.

Only the echo of silence answers.
I can’t try all the combinations. The pain would kill me before that.

Clenching my fist, I smash a heavy punch into the phone, which falls to the ground, not without breaking my knuckles.

But the phone starts ringing again. And my blood stops flowing almost immediately. The cracking of my bones resetting creates a wave of nausea, but nothing comes out.

In a sudden moment of clarity, I remember the tone. Eleven beeps.

From the start, I’ve only tried 5- or 6-digit combinations. Maybe I need to build a logical sequence.

But which one?

My eyes scan my sweat-slicked skin frantically. There. On my forearm. When I tore the suit. Taking the numbers and making something logical out of them… maybe.

39526

What could that represent?
And the ones in my head…

765344

Something’s wrong. Deep inside me, hidden in a lost memory waiting to be recovered, a faint voice whispers a sequence of numbers. That’s the one I need to dial if I want to get out of here.

My fingers slip several times on the rotary dial before I reach the last number. I bring the receiver to my ear with a trembling hand, tired but determined.

The tone rings 11 times, then a relieved voice answers: “You’re back.”

The forest fades to black, replaced by a blinding light. The sun rises over a plain white room. I’m lying in bed.

A figure wearing a hat, its face blurred, stands beside the bed.

“Did you find the number?”
Its voice is almost pleading.

The number. Yes, the sequence. The one I dialed. It’s something like… my memory fails me again.

The only thing I know starts to slip away.

It goes 39 6 25, then 76 maybe, and something like 55… no, 44…

No idea.

Everything fades.

The figure loses its posture, shoulders slumping. It nods in disappointment, then slowly walks away and leaves the room.

Before I drift off, I hear a sentence I don’t understand:

“He’s no longer viable. Move on to the next one.”

I was in a coma for 6 months before they sent me home without any explanation. And without any certainty about who I am—and whether this house is really mine.
