[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lwvjlt/a_flying_saucer_under_my_bed_part_1/)

My curiosity was overridden by the fact that it was now well past dinner and my parents would probably be losing their minds soon.  I ran the rest of the way, pulling the backpack behind me.  It bounced a couple of times off the pavement as I tore up my driveway to the front door.  Before I could even knock, the door burst open.  My dad was still in his work clothes and clearly disheveled until he saw me standing in the doorway.  With that strange combo of justified anger and relief, he pulled me into the house.  I had some words with my parents; they were not happy about my absence.  Funny enough, I did lose some of their trust in the end, just not for the stupid torn backpack I was still gripping nervously.  

After the scolding, I got an understanding hug from both my parents before they sent me off to bed early with no TV or dessert.  I trudged the walk of shame up the stairs to my bedroom, still towing along the rather heavy pack.  

It was only eight, I believe, so I was pretty upset about having to be stuck in bed so early.  With a disgruntled huff, I tossed the backpack under my bed.  I sat up in bed, bitter and defeated. However, I was pretty worn out.  My body was exhausted, and even my onslaught of emotional highs and lows had drained me mentally.  So, within minutes of hitting the bed, I passed out.  With that thing under my bed.  

I jolted awake in a sweat, still in my dirty clothes from the day before.  I felt sick, and the multiple layers of sweat coating my skin and soaking my already stained clothes only made it worse.  I blurrily looked at my digital clock on my bedside stand, 2 AM.  There was a humming coming from under me.  The mattress felt hot, like the hood of a car on a hot Summer afternoon.  For a second, I thought my parents had placed a nightlight somewhere in my room.  Until I rolled over to look at the floor.  A soft green light was radiating from under my bed.  

The sweat came in cold waves now.  I stared at that light as it wavered across my wooden floor for what must have been ten minutes.  I was transfixed, that sinking feeling returned to my stomach, mixed with a horrid horror of the unknown.  I attempted a call to Mom, but my throat was dry as hell.  It felt like sand had been poured down it.  With a squeak, I slid back to the covers and hid.  The humming stopped for a moment.  I was trembling all over, hugging myself under the sheets, when the hum was replaced with a loud clank.  

Quaking, I pulled my head out of the blanket fort.  The hue of green illuminated most of the room now.  It was dead silent.  All I could do was strain my ears, waiting for a sign, something to ease my mind.  Instead, I heard rhythmic tapping.  My brain was on fire, and my nerves were fried as I waited for some monster to appear from under my bed.  I finally noticed the tapping sounded like… like footsteps.  I felt a tug on my blanket.  The sheet dangling over the edge was being tugged as it shifted under some unknown weight.   I was too scared to move.  I couldn’t even hide my face again, as I watched something crawl up the blanket at the foot of my bed.  

I shut my eyes, tight.  So, tight it hurt.  The movement finally stopped.  There I sat, shaking, eyes clenched closed, waiting for someone or something to grab me and drag me to some unknown abyss.  Instead, minutes passed, no fowl being nabbed me, or bit me, or even tackled me.  I built up the courage to peek.  Cracking one eye open, I finally saw what was at the foot of my bed.  

A tiny starman.  I mean that literally.  It looked like a tiny starfish in a silver spandex spacesuit, with big boots.  A black visor hid its strangely shaped face.  An antenna, similar to the flying saucer’s, dangled limply off the tip of its appendage-like head, bent and crooked.  It stood there patiently waiting for my attention.  And he got it.  I leaped off the bed and across the room, mere inches from the door, when it spoke.  

“WAIT!”  A strangely cartoony, masculine voice yelped behind me.  I stopped at the door and turned to the assailant.  I just stared at it, waiting for confirmation that it did, in fact, speak.  It held up its small, starfish arms up, as it continued, “I mean no harm.  I come in peace.” Its little appendage waved at me, “Please, I crash landed here and have no means to return home.  Can you assist me sir?”

It felt good to be called “sir”.  My tension eased as I took a step toward the bed. “What are you?”  I asked.

“A simple space traveler.  I got caught in a meteor storm and crash-landed here,”  the little starman responded.  

“Well, how am I supposed to help you?”

“Ah, well, once I figure out what needs fixing, I will let you know.  For now, do you mind if I shelter myself here?”

I was still very put off, so before I could answer, he continued, “I can make a deal with you, in exchange for shelter.”

“Ok, what’s the deal?”  I was now standing at the bedside, looking down at him.

“Excellent! Well, from what I have gathered, your species values a monetary system first and foremost, but more so, what it gets you! I have an Intergalactic Matter Producer, or IMP, installed in my ship.  In exchange for shelter, I can produce anything you can imagine.”

I was intrigued; I liked this idea.  So, I confirmed, “How does it work?  And ANYTHING I can imagine?”

The little starman nodded vigorously, “Of course!” He exclaimed in his overly bravado voice.  I tested this promise.  I thought I was being slick; it felt like being an adult, bargaining like this.  I liked it.  He indulged me as I expressed my doubt and asked me, “What would you like to start with, sir?”

So, I thought of something not only fun that I wanted, but also to show off to my friends.  “I want you to make me a PS2!”  

He didn’t need any description, no explanation, nothing.  He just climbed down the bed and went to his ship.  The green hue and the humming started up again from under my bed.  I stood waiting, excitement and disbelief filling me.  

With a thud, the humming stopped, and there he came out, dragging a boxed PS2 out from under my bed.  I had to contain my yelp, as I bolted to my knees to open it.  Tearing it free, I saw it was a similar silver grey to the saucer, but the rest of the branding was totally on point.  I bolted to my hand-me-down little box TV and started excitedly shoving wires into inputs and unraveling the controller.  

“Open the disc slot,”  the starman said, now standing on top of the PS2 in his triumphant pose.  Still giddy, I turned on the console and ejected the slot.  Inside was a silver disc.  Before I could ask what it was, he said, “That has every current game released, all on one disc.”  his little starfish hands were on his waist.  

In disbelief, I put the disc on.  It was every game.  *Pac-Man World 2, Okami, God of War, Prince of Persia, Shadow of the Colossus*, and countless others I had never even heard of.  I immediately began playing *God of War*, as I heard Mikey’s older brother was bragging about all the “tits” and “realistic combat” in the game.  I wanted to know what those things were like.  I was nine, it's not like I was a puberty-stricken gross teen; I was just curious.  Needless to say, I agreed to the contract; he got me.  He held out his tiny little starfish hand, and I shook it, the silvery spandex felt… odd.  Like slimy.  The console blurred my thoughts, I never thought about it after that moment, till now at least.  I gamed the night away, knowing I would never get a chance to play this game with my parents awake and around.  In that dark bedroom, I sat in front of the illuminated box TV, volume just high enough that I could hear its whisper.  The starman sat on the PS2, his little legs just above the power button.  He stared at me the whole night.  I didn’t even notice, or maybe I didn’t care.  I was enveloped in playing.  

He got me good.  I wish I had never gotten that console.  I wish I had never agreed to his deal.  I was smug and thought I got the long end of the stick.  I never could have imagined what it would cost.
