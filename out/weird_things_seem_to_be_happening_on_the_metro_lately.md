this metro fucking sucks. 

good fucking lord, i hate the metro. why did maddie have to move offices? we had such a good thing going. 

if i drove, this would all be fine. but fuck, i hate driving more than i hate public transport. even if i was still allowed to drive, i’d probably pick the metro. 

fuck it. driving after therapy sucks even more anyway. it’s so impossible to focus - something about the empty roads that makes it easy to wander off. i’m a repeat victim of rumination; this useless mind of mine has a vendetta against staying calm, present, and controlled. no use missing the driver’s license i used for, like, six months, anyway. 

maddie said i should be writing mood logs years ago. to keep track of it - the rumination, i guess. it was so long ago now i can’t remember the guidelines - i only have my med logs to go off, but those are so fucking different. did i sleep okay? does my stomach hurt? do i feel an overwhelming urge to lie on the metro tracks and let the wheels slowly squish me into a pancake-shaped mound of blood and bones and flesh? 

god, trust me to start these as a last fucking resort. it’s been an hour since i got on the metro, and maybe twenty since i realised this metro line is apparently an internet deadzone. none of my music is saved offline either - i’ve been listening to the same ten songs i saved in high school, bought on the app store like a fucking chump. *pon de replay,* four times, before i cracked. 

god, i remember why i hate writing logs. twenty-six is too old for a notes app diary. 

alright. metro log one. status: exhausted. hating public transport. wishing i was anywhere but here. 

what do i even talk about, that i didn’t mention in therapy? 

oh. my stop is next. i’m connected to the world again. never been happier to see a paid invoice notification in my life.

metro log two. tired, emotionally drained. hungry. annoyed. 

feels like every time i get onto this metro, i lose internet the second i cross the threshold. “mind the gap!” and then *bam*. completely disconnected. alice through the fucking looking glass. 

ugh, this metro. i really hate metros. maddie’s new office is so far away, just miles into the country, and this thing is the only transport that goes there. i mean, i’m happy for her, don’t get me wrong. big thing to leave your firm, move up in the world. but getting here is a trek and a half - two-and-a-half hours of pure, mind-numbing torture. metros aren’t, like, charmingly old or anything. they’re kind of new, kind of not - stuck in this early decade of progress, where everything looks like someone’s *idea* of futurism. 

it’s just so *blue.* like, hospital blue. no two- or four-seaters, just blue benches as far as the eye can see. then there’s the painful fluorescent light, the kind that hurts your eyeballs even when they’re closed. the whole thing is clinical looking, hospital-clean, but it never really feels *clean.* the kind of feeling where you know other people have been here - sat in this seat, put their grimy hands all over these poles, coughed and sneezed and- 

i’m not supposed to indulge in those thoughts. i get carried away, writing. just thinking about it makes me want to scrub my whole body, bathe in hand sanitiser until i’m covered in a thick film of *nicegoodclean*, like a big wet isopropyl-scented slug. i think that’s from a tv show. i can’t search which one. 

looking down the rows and rows of carriages makes things worse. i’ve always had hints of thalassophobia - something about the unknown, the depths, the encounters i might have if i found myself down there. if the metro wasn’t empty, i might feel differently; but it is empty, and the lights flicker and pulse, and i think - am i the only one on here? and why? 

these trips always feel longer than they are. i loved the idea of liminal spaces, back when i wrote more. sometimes i think i miss it - you know, the writing. 

how long is this trip again? i swear it’s been more than two-and-a-half, but the little information sign says four stops still. i could’ve sworn…

i could be wrong. i’ve always been a person who can get lost in their own house. 

the self-deprecation, again - maddie taught me ways to circumvent it, rephrase my thinking, psychological garbage. i just can’t seem to do it today. maybe it was a mistake to write this after therapy. i think it’s time i sign off.

someone died on this metro once. 

it happened way back when it opened, when it first started running. she was my age - young. it was early in the morning. she tried to cross through the middle of the carriage - in one door, out the other - and got stuck in the doors. i heard they dragged her five stops before the driver noticed. 

that’s the rumours, anyway. 

i wonder what she was thinking, when she tried to cross through. was she drunk? was she tired? just foolhardy enough to see the gap and think, hey, metro’s are slow. i could make that. 

i wonder how long she was conscious, after she got stuck. if she screamed as she was dragged across the tracks, if she tried to free herself. i wonder why it took the driver so long to notice. i wonder if he heard.

there’s a memorial for her along the tracks, in a little junction between roads. it’s just some flowers around a tree - one of those lonely, sad-looking plane trees, the kind planted in asphalt or bitumen or whateverthefuck it is they use on the sidewalk nowadays. if i had any sort of internet, i’d look it up. but that’s what it is - a plane tree, some flower wreaths, and little messages etched all up its trunk, too scratchy for me to read from inside the carriage. there used to be a picture of her - just an a4 printout, covered in skips where the ink had been running out - but it’s gone now. i’d watch it decay, day by day, weathered down by rain and wind and shitty pedestrians. eventually it gave up and accepted its fate, just melted into the tree. went right back to its roots, you could say. 

maddie would’ve laughed at that.

metro log four. cold, wet, hating life. it’s raining today. 

rain on public transport is honestly the worst experience. not just the getting-on and the getting-off, y’know? but the being-on. the way the water hits the windows - rams right into it, trying to find an entrance, like it’s coming straight for you. like the thin pane of glass is just an obstacle for now. it leaks its way through the cracks, the gaps of the roof, a maddening kind of dripping. there’s small pools near the doors - dirty, sludgy pools, dragging all the germs from the metro floor into its epicenter, toxic little pools of muck. 

there’s always footprints on the linoleum floors. wet, textured prints, speckled with dirt. i’ve still never seen anyone else on this metro. 

i’m avoiding the water as much as i can. one of my socks is already wet - my umbrella, a cheap-as-shit thing from woollies, has a broken spoke that funnels cascades of rainwater directly into my shoe like a cosmic joke of a drainage system. i can feel the water leaking into the soft pads of my shoes, infecting it. every second my foot stays wet, i consider yanking it off, but the grimy floor scares me more than the wet sock between my toes. i wonder how fast it would take for mold to grow there - to claim my shoe as its own. i have no bleach at home, i think. buying some would disappoint maddie. 

it’s a weird thing - wanting to please your therapist. you’re not supposed to. it fucks with your sessions, makes you omit things, twist stories so they like you more. they’re not meant to like you, they’re meant to help you. i know all of this, but i can’t help it anyway. it’s like my mind says, *hey, you need to tell her,* and my mouth says, “nothing bad this week, actually! doing perfectly fine!”. there’s a kind of rush when they praise you. it’s like i’m chasing that phrase - *have you taken a moment to be proud of yourself for your progress?* 

even weirder when your therapist has a high-school girl name. yes, i have noticed my anxiety getting worse, madilyn. gosh, i didn’t consider being kind to myself this week, madilyn. no, i didn’t skip my dose this morning, madilyn. 

oh. strange. i could’ve sworn they just announced that stop. saint anthony’s station - i’m sure i heard it. i’m sure we stopped there already. 

maybe i’m just hearing things again. this trip is so long - i wouldn’t be surprised if it drove me crazy. 


&nbsp;

06.06

incredible news! someone else is on the metro today. mark that one down on the calendar - first time someone else has been trapped in this terrifying hellscape with me. 

they’re real; i checked. they’re a few carriages over, have been since i got on. i can’t tell much from a distance, but it looks like they have a heavy raincoat and a dripping umbrella - yeah, okay, definitely. there’s water pooling at their feet. 

there’s no rain today. i checked.  

my headphones died already today - it’s weird, i swear i charged them last night. they should - they normally do - last much longer. i even made a long playlist for these metro rides, all saved locally onto my phone. it *felt* like they lasted ages - got through three hours of my new playlist before they finally perished, midway through *hotel california*. 

wait, three hours? that can’t be right. 

metro person is checking their phone. sike! no internet, loser! you just gotta bide your time till your stop hits! 

they’ll learn, like i did. probably. 

i did hear that stop get announced again today. three times this time, not two. mechanical, “soothing” female voice - *next stop, saint anthony! next stop, saint anthony! next stop, saint anthony!* i went to record it, but something stopped me. even if it’s different from usual, that doesn’t mean anything. 

the little information screen isn’t showing any stops, either. it’s perpetually frozen on a safety screen - *mind the gap!* 

it could be nothing. it probably is nothing. the metro might just be older than i thought. 

metro person looks confused. me too, buddy. 

&nbsp;

09.06 

metro person is here again today. 

they were here when i got on. they’re still wet. it’s still not raining. i swear the raincoat is the same as the one the other day - but people only have one raincoat, right? not like you go shopping and think *oh, i should pick up a new raincoat, one that matches my shoes.* 

fuck, they’re looking at me. 

i don’t know why i ever thought another person would make this trip feel less weird. they’re so far away it just makes these carriages feel like they’re even longer. they won’t stop staring at me - are they coming over here - fuck, now i’m just typing to make it look like i’m busy. metro log: fucking terrified. hating social interaction. wi

she’s still looking at me but she’s another carriage over again. god, that was weird. she was - i mean. she was completely normal. she smelled like petrichor, but also earthy, wet. i’m trying to stop myself from thinking of the mold. 

she asked me what stop it was. i said, *i don’t know*. she said, *i feel like i’ve been waiting forever.* i smiled and wished she’d go away. i realised i couldn’t remember if i was going to see maddie or if i was going home. 

the metro voice said, *saint anthony!,* for the sixth time. 

i said, *i guess we’re at saint anthony.* 

she gave me a weird look and left. okay, lady. i’m not the one talking to strangers. i took another photo of her, and she showed up in the picture, so i know she’s real. i wanted to get off at saint anthony, to avoid the awkwardness, but the doors didn’t open. i’m not sure what her stop is. i just know i’m getting off first. 

&nbsp;

i saw a bird on the track today. 

not in a cute way. in a ruins-your-day way. walked out of therapy, up the station, and there it was - splayed out on the tracks, almost spatchcocked across the gravel. i felt the revulsion immediately, looked away, but the image of it already wrote itself into my brain. 

i can’t stop thinking about it. there were just so many feathers - its wings were still outstretched, pressed perfectly flat like a pancake-shaped mound of blood and bone and *fucking feathers*. angelic, my brain wants to say. it hurts my heart to think about it. i want to throw up. 

i’ve always been sensitive to animals. just the image of that bird - that poor pigeon - i know it won’t leave my brain for weeks. it’s going to make a home in there, burrow deep into my psyche just to pop up one day, when i’m feeling good for once - *hey, remember that bird you saw? out on the tracks?* 

there’s something about pigeons, too. i think about them a lot. they make me sad. they were our best friends once - they carried our letters, and we loved them, and they loved us. somewhere along the way, they stopped being useful to us - because we’re a horrible fucking race, and we only like things that are pretty or useful. we left them alone out there, no way to fend for themselves. we changed their entire genetic makeup, bred the fight right out of them, and then just fucking left them there. alone. still loving us. no one to take care of them. 

i think about being left alone like that a lot. like - those pets, y’know? the ones that get left behind in a house when the family moves out. when they get too inconvenient to keep. those skinny stray cats, returning over and over again to the place they were raised, but the family inside has changed. those big-eyed, droopy, touch-starved dogs, still leashed up. waiting for an owner who’ll never come home. 

i mean, fuck. metros are so slow, y’know? especially at the stations. it could’ve flown away. its wings were *right there*, splayed out, ready for flight. it could’ve gotten away. did it just lie there and wait? fuck, was it just trying to cross? 

&nbsp;

15.06

when i first started taking my medication, i kept forgetting whether i’d taken it that day or not. i’d feel bad, some days, and think maybe i hadn’t taken them; but i never wanted to take them a second time. i was scared of overdosing. starting drugs already fucks with your body - i hated the sickness i always felt, the nausea, and i hated more the idea that double-dosing could make it worse. so i got one of those old-lady pill-cases, the ones with different sections for every day of the week. 

i know for a fact i took them today. i know it for certain. but i’m sitting here again, and that woman is still here, and she’s still soaking wet. 

i told maddie today. about the metro. i told her i felt like time was getting away from me, and that i was hearing things, and the bone-deep sense of wrongness i’ve been feeling. it was so hard to describe - that terror. it’s the kind you get in the throes of generalised anxiety - the nausea, tightness in your chest, every muscle screaming that something is *wrong*. 

she seemed concerned, and i felt bad to worry her like that. she asked me if i was taking my meds, and i said of course i’m fucking sure. she pulled out her copy of the DSM, said *how much of this sounds like you-* 

it fucking sucks. to get told there’s more wrong with you than you thought. i have a sheaf of papers dictating how to handle my brain, *again*, and that woman is still here. 

she’s lying flat on the metro floor - god, my skin is crawling. all the germs, coalescing right in that spot where she’s lying, clinging to the tips of her outspread fingers. the water is still dripping off her, practically running off her in streams. it’s rolling across the floor, to me, stretching its murky arms out. i just know it wants to soak into my shoes, my clothes, my hair, my skin. 

her hair is spread out around her, like dank brown wings. why hasn’t she gotten off? 

i can’t bear the thought of that disgusting water touching me. i’m moving down another carriage.

&nbsp;

18.06

my headphones just died again.

i was prepared this time. i charged them all night - didn’t use them til i got on this stupid goddamn metro. they have an eight hour battery life, and the trip is only two-and-a-half. but here i am, in this stupid fucking carriage, with a pair of dead fucking headphones. 

i got through the whole playlist. i checked. seven hours and thirty-seven minutes worth of music, and i got through the whole thing. 

that godforsaken screen still says, *mind the gap!.* there’s still streaks of murky water covering the floor - still travelling through the carriages, making its way from end to end like some disgusting kind of varnish. we’ve driven past that memorial three times - that plane tree, the flowers, mocking me. 

i can’t stop thinking about it. i should call someone - i know i should call someone. who would even want to hear from me now? who do i even speak to, besides fucking madilyn? what am i supposed to do, anyway? call someone just to complain? make them listen to my problems? i have nothing to offer. i haven’t had anything to offer for a while. 

it keeps coming back to me. that bird, flat. the way it didn’t get off the tracks. i wonder if it knew what was happening. i wonder if it was conscious. i wonder if it screamed, like she did. 

&nbsp;

21.06 

she’s still here. i can see her, two carriages down. spread-eagle on the floor, just staring at the ceiling. the water dripping off her is murky and dark now - god knows how fucking old. she doesn’t look up when i get on. 

i’m thinking about the mold again; about rot. i wonder if all that liquid - all that water - is coming from her, from inside. i wonder if she’s fusing into the floor of the metro, melting into those ugly linoleum floors. i wonder if she’s stuck there, trapped. if she’s conscious. the metro is moving, with her along for the ride. i wonder if the driver knows. 

maddie asked if i still saw her. i said no. i couldn’t bear to disappoint her. i wanted to hear those words again - *you’ve made so much progress*. i wanted to hear, *i’m so proud of you.* 

i could’ve shown her. the pictures, i mean. but i’m too scared. what if she doesn’t see the woman? what if it’s all in my head? i can’t go through that again. 

it’s the way they look at you, when you admit it. they can’t hide the sympathy. it all feels so condescending. she asked if i’d considered driving, and i said no. she asked if i was ready for exposure therapy, and i asked to change the subject. 

i tried to walk further down the carriages today. i didn’t want to see her, lying in that pool, staring at the ceiling. the sight of her makes my skin itch, my clothes feel heavy with phantom water. but no matter how far i walked, i didn’t reach the end of the train. it kept stretching on. and every time i turned around, she was still there, just two carriages away.

&nbsp;

22.06 

i just woke up. i fell asleep, and i woke up, and i panicked - because i probably missed my stop, right? but i’m still fucking here. i still have fucking hours to go. i checked the time, and it’s moving normally, but there’s no way. there’s no way it’s been only a few minutes. there’s no way. 

there’s something else. the doors aren’t opening at the stops - every stop gets announced, and the metro stops, but the doors don’t open. no one comes in. no one comes out. 

how long has it been like this? the whole time? every time i catch this fucking metro? have i been so preoccupied with myself that i haven’t noticed? 

fuck - when was the last time i had therapy? my notes say yesterday, but why am i still here? why am i still on this train? this goddamn fucking metro? i don’t remember getting off. 

i got up to press the emergency stop, and it’s not even a real button. it’s glossy and lacquered over. a fake button? are you kidding me? i can’t even look up at it - it’s mocking me. i got up to check the other buttons and they’re all the same. they don’t push in, they don’t make a noise. they’re utterly fake. 

why do i keep getting on? why do i keep doing this to myself? anything is better than this - hell, getting behind the wheel again is better than this. 

the woman is still here, lying on the fucking linoleum. i don’t know if it’s just my eyes, but she looks deflated now. has she just given up? or is she really melting into that floor, trying her hardest to sink into the machinery growling under us? i can’t look at her without thinking of the bird; the girl stuck in those doors; the kid on the asphalt, spread out, blood draining out of her body in crashes and waves. they just wanted to go home. they just wanted to cross. 

&nbsp;


26.06 

metro log ?: i’m not on the metro today. 

shocker, right! 

i dipped into my funds a little to uber up to maddie’s today. it was a little heartbreaking, what with my salary of zero dollars a week, but hey! no metro! i can bear the cost of an uber just this once.

something in me feels a bit lighter, knowing i’m not getting back on. i spoke to maddie, and she said i hadn’t seen her for weeks - which seems wrong, right? but not the craziest thing for me. i’ve always been terrible with dates. 

i guess no more metro logs after this, right? god, it feels like a weight got lifted off my shoulders. i really just can’t bear confronting it anymore, y’know? the not-knowing of it all. when i was younger, it was something that hounded me all the time. was i forgetting something? why did i feel that terror - that bone-deep fear of nothing at all? swelling in my chest the way it did? my mother used to tell me *it’s fine, nothing’s wrong, what could you possibly be worried about?* but that was before i got too inconvenient to keep, when i was still young and cute enough to be completely unuseful. 

the thing about it is, it never goes away. i’m feeling good now - but how long will that last? how long before my shoes fill with water, until i feel so heavy i can’t walk? 

maddie told me she thought i should find a new therapist. i didn’t ask her why. we both knew what the long trips were doing to me. she told me she thought someone closer to me might be a better choice, and she’s right. i could tell there was something she wasn’t saying. i never want to find out what it was.

i’m not in a deadzone right now, but you’d never guess it. after all, the only notifications i ever get are those damn invoices, and it’s not like i’m going to be paying those anymore. the metro station looks different today. it’s still white lights, still clean-but-dirty. completely empty; not a soul around. the information display doesn’t have an arrival time; it just says, in cheery words, “mind the gap!” 

it doesn’t matter, anyway. i’m not getting back on the metro. i’m just going to cross.
