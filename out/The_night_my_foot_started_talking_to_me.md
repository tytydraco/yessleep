“Hello, Reggie.”

My eyes cracked open to the sound of a soft voice. It was calm and subdued, like the whisper of an old woman trying to get a child’s attention.

“I said ‘Hello…’”

*I must be dreaming,* I thought. I tried to move, but my body remained perfectly still.

“Who’s talking?”

“Your left foot,” the voice said. “I’ve been wanting to speak with you for some time.”

*My left foot?!*

Sure enough, the voice rose from the bottom of my bed, specifically my left foot, which moved back and forth, beneath the sheets, like a conductor waving to an invisible orchestra.

“How is this possible?” My heart rattled inside my chest.

“Does it matter? I’m here and I need you to do something for me.”

*Do something?*

“I need you to go to the kitchen.”

*Yes?*

"Grab your biggest knife.”

*And…*

“Chop off your left hand.”

“What?!”

“I won’t let you up until you promise to do it.”

*This isn’t real! Wake up!*

I tried pushing myself up. But I just lay there, static, save for my left foot, which continued to move, back and forth, beneath the sheets.

“You seem disturbed by my request. Just know that I won’t let you leave until you agree to my demands.”

“And if I don’t?”

“I’ll keep you here. Forever. You’ll rot on this mattress, lying in your own piss and feces until the neighbors find your body.”

“Why are you doing this?”

“Because I hate your hands. They hate me. But I’m going to win.”

*Someone, help me!* My body spasmed, reacting to the insanity. *I need to get out of this bed!*

I tried moving again, but my muscles ignored me. I must've struggled for hours until I finally gave in, sobbing: “Okay. I’ll do it.”

“Promise?”

“Yes. I’ll chop off my left hand.”

“Excellent decision.”

Instantly, my foot stopped moving. Strength returned to my body.

I got up, scared shitless, and sprinted to the bathroom.

As I emptied my bladder, I stared at my left foot, wondering: *am I safe? Now that I’m up, will it leave me alone?*

The entire time my left foot didn’t say anything, didn’t even move of its own accord. 

Life seemed normal once again, so I relocated to the living room.

*Must’ve been a bad dream.* I yawned and planted myself on the couch.

I was so tired. I just wanted to sleep…

***

A few hours later, I heard the disturbing voice.

“You didn’t listen to me, Reggie.”

*Oh god! It’s happening.*

I tried sitting up. But my foot was in control.

“I want you to do something else for me.”

“Leave me alone!”

“I need you to grab the buzzsaw from the garage.”

*What?!*

“And chop off your head!”

I sprang up with all my might, adrenaline coursing through my body.

Somehow, my desperation worked. My body rolled off the couch and hit the floor.

I glanced at the front door—only a foot away.

“You’re not getting away from me.”

*Come on!* I commanded myself, urging my limbs onward. *Just…make it…to the door…*

I must’ve crawled for twenty minutes before I made it to the entryway and crawled out.

After thirty minutes of non-stop screaming, my neighbors found me.

***

The doctors still don’t know what to call it. The primary theory? Severe schizophrenia.

I’m on medication now, which helps. But every now and then, I sense my foot trying to control me.

Thankfully, I’ve recognized its call. If I catch it soon enough, it goes back to being an obedient part of my body.

It’s been three months. I’m still in control. Only thing is…

… Every time I go to sleep, I’m terrified.

*Will my left foot paralyze me again?*
