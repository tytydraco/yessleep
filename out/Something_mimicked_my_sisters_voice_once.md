This happened about 2 years ago or so, and I just felt compelled to share it—so here goes…

It had been a long night, I was up late—watching some random videos on my phone. A hurricane had just passed through our town and we had just moved not too long before. My whole family began to settle in and make their spaces their own—including my sister and I. Despite this, boxes still took up a decent chunk of the hallway outside our rooms.

Now to tell this story properly, here’s a quick layout of the house: Downstairs-two bedrooms (one master, and one we made into a guest room), stairs that led up to our bedrooms upstairs (they began near the front door and veered off with a wide middle landing, so you could see the living room and front door from there), and basically everything else you’d expect in a house. Now, the two bedrooms upstairs both met the top landing of the stairs/small hallway. Think sort of like revolving doors, that’s how close they were. Just a wall between us and a conjoined bathroom with sliding doors on both sides (awful I know, they are the worst). We had our own sinks. This style of bathroom/bedroom has a name but I can’t think of it right now.

Anyway—after staying up for a long time, I just really wanted to relax and fall asleep. I just couldn’t shake the feeling that I kept hearing weird cracking/creaking noises outside my door. So, my idea was to try ignore it the best I can. Calm the paranoia that comes with a new house, keep watching my videos and ignore the creeping feeling. I did this for a good few more minutes till my body had a weird and sudden reaction. I got extremely cold all over, practically clacking my jaw and trembling. Mind you, this was a summer night in the south. Worse than that, I suddenly felt very unsafe—a flight or fight response kicking in and a rush or dizziness that washed over me. So, after a few minutes of trying to calm myself—I got up and woke my sister to ask for help.

I told her everything that I was feeling and she ended up (sleepily) getting me water and snacks to help me feel better. While I ate, I told her that I was feeling paranoid and she performed a prayer ritual while taking a bit of water and “cleansing my feet”. My sister is Christian and this was her way of trying to help (not in a weird way, she’s very sweet). Almost instantly, I actually felt immense relief. I got so warm that I was able to take my sweatshirt off. It was crazy how fast I felt better after her prayer.

So, after all that, I thanked her and she went off to bed when I told her that I felt much better.

30 minutes or so passed while I continued to watch a few videos to help me keep the “zen” going (calming videos).

I was finally ready to rest, but needed to use the bathroom before (just something I always do before falling asleep). So, I got up and slid the door open, plopped myself down and as soon as I was ready to get up—I heard it. Clear as day.

Coming from my sister’s room, on the other side of her closed sliding door—a distinct whisper. A loud whisper. The kind that you make when you want to shout but you’re in a library. Hurried and abrasive.

It said my name. In her voice. But in a way she would never whisper it. All the while, I heard her snore softly in the background while it was said. My hairs stood up higher than I’ve ever felt in that moment. Goosebumps riddled my body like a shockwave and a sharp shiver shot up my spine. It was the first time I ever felt something so wrong in such a visceral way. The whisper was on the other side of the door but felt like it was right in my ear at the same time.

Funny enough, after the shiver struck me, my knee-jerk reaction was to reply “F*ck this”. Wiped fast, swiftly exited the bathroom, slid the door shut, and laid down. Said, “Nope, you gotta go” to whatever it was (for good measure). And fell asleep somehow.

It’s a random story but it’s the weirdest and most creepy thing I’ve experienced. I have no idea what it was and it’s never happened since.

But, I’ll never forget the way it sounded. Burned into my memory and still makes my body recoil.
