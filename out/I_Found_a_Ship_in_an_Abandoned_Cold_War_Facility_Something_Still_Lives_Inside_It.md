I have always found urban exploring to be one of the most thrilling parts of my life. To enter a long-forgotten and derelict building, to see places others have abandoned, to touch the remnants of their past – it’s always been a high. A reward after a hard week of work. But this last place I’ve been to… I wish I hadn’t gone.

I’m Arthur. A buddy of mine contacted me about a place “no one’s ever gotten footage of.” It was a neglected facility off the beaten path on the rugged Scottish coastline. He knew I couldn’t say no to such an opportunity – I’ve always wanted to explore a Cold War-era facility in the middle of nowhere. It’s been a dream of mine since I was a kid.

So, I did it. I grabbed my camera and planned the nearly 12-hour road trip from London to the area. I won’t name it, though, because I don’t want anyone else to see and experience the things I did. I want to keep that place locked away – the way it was intended to be. God, I wish I hadn’t been so curious. Even now, I just want to go back and find out more. But I won’t. I can’t.

The path leading to the facility was, to say the least, rough. Steep cliffs, howling wind. Waves crashing below, deafening and relentless. Along the way, I noticed several weather-worn signs warning about private property, but those only made me more curious. Apparently, the area was under the control of some organization named the “Office of Marine Integrity” – a supposed NGO that “protects marine life and coastal habitats.”

After walking around the exact coordinates and not finding anything that might lead to an entrance (really, this piece of land didn’t look any different from the rest of the surrounding area), I accidentally tripped over something made of metal. Upon closer inspection, there was something unnatural in the rocks: a half-camouflaged steel hatch, slightly ajar. “Weird,” I thought to myself, “didn’t know any NGO worked in secrecy.”

The hatch was covered in moss, bolted but rusted through. On the hatch, there was a barely visible serial number – which now, in hindsight, should’ve been the first warning sign. Still, I went ahead and, with great struggle, managed to force the door open, revealing a corroded and dark elevator shaft. At this point, my gut was screaming at me to leave, but curiosity won out.

“Well, that’s not what I expected” I muttered, struggling to reach for my camera and turn it on.

I climbed down, softly placing my feet, wary of the elevator’s age. It had to be around, what – 60, 70 years old? I looked around and took a deep breath – maybe even said a quick prayer, I can’t remember – before pressing the “DOWN” button. The elevator hummed to life. It was creaky, unnatural. Lights flickered above me.

“It’s a miracle this still works” I said to the camera, eager to get to the bottom and see this place from the inside. “The looks on their faces,” I snickered, thinking of my soon-to-be-jealous friends who would be the first to watch the entire tape.

The elevator stopped abruptly. The doors slowly groaned open. The hallway ahead was dark, narrow, and filled with ankle-high stagnant water. The air was thick with mold, salt, and rot – a combination that almost made me puke. My breathing echoed through the empty space, in a way calming me, as it wasn’t completely silent. I fumbled around for my flashlight, making sure I didn’t step on something I couldn’t see in the water.

When the light turned on, my biggest suspicion was confirmed. This wasn’t an NGO facility. It was more than that. It had a secret that had only been hinted at before – the logo of the facility looked a bit too military, the signs were too faded, too serious in tone. The whole damn hidden research center didn’t raise alarms in my head. But when I turned the flashlight on, everything suddenly made sense.

“Welcome to Facility-ESC-02,” it read on the wall. Surveillance cameras hung dead. As I made my way inside across the murky water, I saw what seemed to be a reception, with scattered classified documents floating around in the water and on top of the desk. The further I walked, the more that creeping unease built in my stomach. This wasn’t just an old facility; it was something worse. Something hidden, forgotten, and… waiting. I placed the flashlight in my mouth and picked up a piece of paper – one that was still somewhat readable.

**SUBJECT: VESSEL-DWELLER**  
**RESPONSE PROTOCOL: Undertow**  
**LOCAL NAMES: The White Boarder**

I had no idea what any of it meant. But I felt cold. Like I was already too deep to turn back. The words echoed in my head as the paper shook in my hand. It had to be a prank, right? It can’t be what I think it is… right? The rest was illegible. My stomach twisted. The paper trembled in my hand before dropping it.

I glanced around, wondering what I had gotten myself into. There was something about this place – something that didn’t belong. A presence, maybe? “I must be paranoid” I said, trying to reassure myself. The hairs on my arms stood up, and my gut tightened. I could feel it – the weight of something watching me, waiting. But there was no one there. Just the water, and the endless silence.

Despite every part of my body telling me not to, I went on, eager to explore the place. That’s the whole reason why I was here – I couldn’t turn back without any footage. I kept the flashlight low as I walked. Every step stirred the stagnant water, sending ripples that echoed down the corridor. Due to the darkness, I couldn’t really see the true size of the facility, but it was quite big – enough for a team of 20 to work there.

After walking past a break room with waterlogged and decaying furniture, I reached a hallway that sloped slightly downward. At the end of it, I saw a set of double doors, one of them hanging half off its hinges. A sound came through the opening: soft, wet, rhythmical steps that could be attributed to a human – but the moment I paid attention to them, they disappeared. Blaming it on my cowardice, I went ahead and made my way down to the doors, watching everything from my camera screen – it calmed me, thinking I was just a viewer of events.

Beyond the doors there was a large chamber, far colder than the rest of the facility. I quickly realized it was a dry dock – or had been. Half-flooded now, lit only by the faint glow of emergency lights that somehow still worked. In the center, partially submerged, was an old fishing vessel, its hull cracked open, paint stripped, leaning on its side.

There were cameras aimed at it, long-dead, their lenses fogged over. A small control room sat nearby, just a dozen feet away. Inside, a computer terminal, more folders, more reports. This wasn’t just a place of observation – it was a containment chamber.

I started connecting the dots. Before approaching the vessel, I visited the small room to my right and picked another piece of paper up, my hands shaking with fear and a hint of… excitement.

“Incident Report… Subject VESSEL-DWELLER… 1979? Jesus…” My eyes scanned the page, but most of the print smudged into gray swirls. But a few words stood out. Enough to make my skin crawl.

“Vessel operator: Daniel Fraser… mass approaching from below… climbed onboard, white, tall, not human… still believed to inhabit the vessel”. My hands trembled. I almost dropped the page. The last line echoed in my head.

*Was it still here?*

I turned my head slowly, toward the silent bulk of the wreck in the dry dock. It loomed in the dark – and suddenly, I just wanted to run.

So, I did. I bolted out of the surveillance room, leaving the papers, folders, even my damn camera behind.

Something shifted in the water behind me. Not loud – not a splash, but a ripple. A suggestion.

Although I knew I should keep running, I slowly turned, eyes wide, my breathing interrupted by what I saw.

At the edge of the dry dock, next to the vessel, something was standing – tall, still and pale. It wasn’t moving, not really. Just watching. Stalking. Its white eyes penetrated the dark of the dock, discouraging me from flashing the light at it. Its feet disappeared in the ankle-high water. Or I just couldn’t see them.

Its body seemed wrong – stretched, almost boneless. White like snow, skin rippling faintly like a reflection disturbed by motion. It didn’t flinch; it didn’t retreat.

It *belonged* here.

I did *not*.

I stumbled back, but my feet slipped on the flooded floor, and I caught myself on the rusted edge of a filing cabinet.

Still, the thing didn’t move. Just followed me with its blank eyes, tilting its head with curiosity.

Only when I reached the threshold of the hallway – my hand nearly on the wall to guide myself out – did it shift. I didn’t see it move – I looked away for a moment, and that’s when it came forward.

A step. No splash. Just… displacement.

Like it moved *through* the water instead of in it.

A low groan echoed from the vessel. Like something massive shifting its weight after a long slumber. Only then did I realize: I had woken it. This ship wasn’t just a resting place, but a home. And I crossed a line I shouldn’t have.

I turned and bolted, scared that the creature would be faster and more adept at running through water than me. Still, I didn’t stop – I kept going, perfectly remembering where the elevator was. Except for my movements, the facility was silent, still – for a second, I thought it wasn’t coming after me. But that wasn’t a good enough reason for me to stop.

I saw the elevator. It was a hallway away. Water leaked steadily from the ceiling, but the ripple I heard came from something bigger.

I called the elevator, but the doors took their sweet damn time to open. Those few seconds seemed like hours, so I turned around, just out of instinct.

It was staring at me from the end of the hallway. A silhouette of a creature that wasn’t aggressive – it was territorial. I disturbed its peace, and now it wants me to leave.

The elevator doors croaked open, and I shakingly stepped inside, not taking my eyes off the creature.

It didn’t move this time either. That’s when I realized, I hadn’t *seen* him move. He was capable of killing me wherever, but *chose* not to.

The ride up was much longer than the descent. Maybe I was holding my breath the entire time. My eyes watered – either out of fear, or from not blinking.

I tried to piece together what I just witnessed, but there was no rational explanation for it. I awoke something terrible. But why was it kept here? What is this place? ‘Office of Marine Integrity’ my ass.

The elevator clanked to a stop. I pulled myself out, climbed up the hatch and rolled onto the wet grass, staring back at the cliffside.  

There was no sound from below. No pursuit. Just the wind and the waves – and the unbearable weight of knowing something still lived under that cliff.

I should’ve left it alone. God knows *it* left me alone.

But as I lay there on the mossy ground, soaked and shaking, one thought burned behind my eyes like a fever:

*It let me go.*

Why?
