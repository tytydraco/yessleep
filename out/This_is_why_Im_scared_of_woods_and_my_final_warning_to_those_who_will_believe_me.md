Everyone thinks I'm crazy, or that I had a vivid dream, But I know the truth and I have to tell it somewhere before they convince me it never happened, in hope someone believes me and avoids meeting them...



I was entering in a pretty anonymous wood in the northern italian mountains to pick up some mushrooms, as i often did when the season was right. Immediately something felt out of place, the air wasn't as cold as the grey late autumn day would suggest. But following the warm air stream i was finding more and more mushrooms, so I didn't stop to wonder about it.



Then I started to hear a flute, which weirded me out. It came from deep in the woods, seemingly where the warm air was coming from. I admit it, I was charmed and followed it despite knowing deep down it wasn't wise.



I ended up in a clearing, where the season seemed to change. The sunlight was bringht and warm, birds who should only be around in spring were chirping and in the middle of it was a girl, playing the flute on a tree stump.



Feeling alienated by the sheer contrast with my common sense I sat down to listen, and she joined me. We simply looked at each other, and she was beautiful with her white hair and amber colored eyes. We instinctively leaned to kiss when the birds flew away scared and she recoiled.



At first I was confused, then I saw them. Shadows lurking closer and closer, whispering things I couldn't understand but that filled me with dread. She got up as if to shield me but we were surrounded, i could see the fear in her eyes as the shadows were close enough to be perfectly visible.



Creatures, if they can be called that, with a body that looked halfway between solid and a cloud-like texture, of a black like nothing I've ever seen. As if darkness itself was alive in front of me.



But that was nothing, not even the deadly fangs and claws were what really scared me. The damned eyes. Flickering points of light, shining in a seemingly void and neverending abyss inside the creature. They looked and felt completely against nature... Yet they were there, closing in on us.



She created a door of light, somehow, and pushed me in. I could see the shadows jumping on her and her sad expression while she muttered "goodbye", her only word since i met her. When I opened my eyes I was at the edge of the woods, I thought I dreamt everything, but my basket was full of mushrooms.



With my heart full of fear I looked back, and sure enough those shadows were coming for me. And they were fast.



I ran for my life, now that the whispers were for me my instincts could understand them. Those creatures prey on life, any life, and it was my turn to be caught.



Running wasn't enough with my speed, the shadows caught up and even cut my skin superficially with their claws. I barely made it into into the car and got out full speed, but one of those creatures was on top of my car and slowly it was spreading, engulfing the car until i was running into a completely void space.



I was about to give up and accept whatever fate was in store for me, when a light broke through. The girl from the clearing was back, to save me again. I managed to get out but I saw her stomach pierced and the blood coming out of her mouth, before countless shadow creatures swarmed her.



I again woke up, this time in my car. I could see my skin cut from the claws, the car damaged, and my mushroom basket was full.



I got out and tried to tell the police, only to end up in a mental facility. I know that it really happened, even if no one believes me, and I'm writing to tell everyone to avoid the shadows of the woods, or unnatural warm places, because I might have not understood what happened that day but one thing I know...



We lost the beacon that was keeping that darkness away from us, and they're coming. I wake up every night screaming, and as they sedate me I pray that when those creatures finally invade, our souls may be able to escape that endless void at least after death...



I hear them whispering, and now I hope that the medication drove me crazy. Because I swear that every night the whispers are clearer and nearer than the previous and I know I won't live much longer...
