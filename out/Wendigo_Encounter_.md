I've always loved hiking. Growing up in Montana, surrounded by dense forests and towering mountains, it's been my go-to escape from the grind of daily life. At 28, I’ve spent countless weekends exploring the trails, but last autumn, I decided to take a solo trip to the Bob Marshall Wilderness, a vast area known for its rugged beauty and isolation.

I set off early on a crisp Friday morning, the air biting but refreshing. The trail was familiar, having hiked parts of it before, but this time I planned to venture deeper into the backcountry than I ever had. The first day went smoothly. I found a nice spot by a stream to set up camp, enjoyed a meal, and fell asleep under a sky full of stars.

On the second day, things started to feel off. I was miles away from any sign of civilization, and the forest around me was eerily silent. No birds, no rustling leaves, just an oppressive stillness. I brushed it off as my imagination and kept moving.

That afternoon, I stumbled upon something strange. There was a circle of stones in a small clearing, blackened as if by fire, though there were no signs of recent use. It gave me a weird feeling, like I was trespassing somewhere I shouldn’t be. I took a few photos and moved on, hoping to find a good spot to set up camp before nightfall.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, the temperature dropped rapidly. I managed to get a fire going and settled in for the night, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being watched. My mind raced through rational explanations, but none seemed to fit. It was a quiet, gnawing sense of unease.

Sometime around midnight, I woke up to a strange sound. It was faint at first, like a distant cry, but it grew louder and more desperate. It sounded almost human, but distorted, like someone in immense pain. I sat up, heart pounding, straining to hear more. The sound came again, closer this time. It was a wail, long and mournful, echoing through the trees.

I grabbed my flashlight and shone it into the darkness, but the beam was swallowed by the thick forest. The sound seemed to circle around me, sometimes closer, sometimes farther. I tried to tell myself it was just an animal, maybe a coyote or an injured deer. But deep down, I knew something was terribly wrong.

Sleep was impossible after that. I stayed up, clutching my knife, listening intently. The cries continued sporadically throughout the night, never approaching but never fully retreating. As dawn broke, they ceased entirely, leaving an unsettling silence in their wake.

Exhausted and on edge, I decided to cut my trip short and head back. The return hike felt much longer, every rustle and shadow putting me on high alert. By the time I reached my car, I was a nervous wreck. I drove home in a daze, replaying the night’s events in my head.

I did some research afterward, hoping to find a logical explanation. That’s when I stumbled upon stories of the wendigo, a creature from Algonquian folklore said to be a malevolent spirit or monstrous beast that preys on humans. The descriptions varied, but the common thread was an insatiable hunger and the ability to mimic human cries to lure its victims.

I don’t know what I encountered in the Bob Marshall Wilderness. Maybe it was just a trick of the mind, an overactive imagination spurred by isolation. Or maybe, just maybe, there are things out there that we can’t explain, lurking in the shadows, waiting for the right moment to reveal themselves.

One thing’s for sure—I won’t be hiking alone anytime soon.
