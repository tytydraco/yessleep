We came to The Shack every year, yet we never seemed to be able to remember exactly where it was on the first try. 

"I think I found it," I heard Jeremy call out from ahead of me in the brush. 

He was right. A few more steps revealed a dilapidated wooden shack covered in moss and the fallen branches of the dead fir trees all around us. The thing was filthy, filled with potato bugs and could collapse at any moment, but it was our Shack, and it was where we became men. It was also where we came every year to remember what happened in our lives – the good and the bad - the light and the dark. 

I walked inside to see Jeremy had already busted out the R&R Canadian whisky. He was one of those guys who needed the numbness of alcohol to be sentimental, and it seemed to become more of a necessity every year we came. He poured a horn (whiskey, Pepsi, preferably ice) as fast as he could.

The more cautious one, I first went to my little bed in the back corner, and started setting up my bedding on the old army cot where I would rest my head for the night. I spread out my old scratchy GhostBusters sleeping bag and was fluffing my Jurassic Park pillow when I noticed something amiss about my usual bunk. Something stuck to the mattress that came off on my hand. It was off white, flaky, and stuck to my hand like glue. 

"Ah, what the fuck?" I yelled as I realized what I had just picked up was a clump of used toilet paper. 

I threw the foul clump across the room and almost hit Jeremy in the back of the head. 

"I think someone might be using our childhood playhouse as a toilet,” I announced.

I thought about it for a second and a cold wash of sudden fear washed over me. 

"Someone might be living here,” I went on. 

"Oh calm down. It's probably just some kids doing the same thing we were doing back in the day,” Jeremy reasoned.

What we did back in the day was use The Shack as our personal clubhouse – Jeremy, our friend Daniel, and I, found the shack when we were five and spent countless hours there every weekend doing what young kids did until we grew too old to where it just became a shack again. However, once we started to get over the shack in our early-teens, we vowed we would all come back and stay the night there at least one night a summer each year for the rest of our lives. 

To commemorate the creation of the yearly reunion, when we were 12, we wrote down how we thought our lives would go for the next 20 years, sealed the predictions in old coffee cans and buried them behind The Shack with a promise to dig them back up 20 years later and whoever had the prediction that was closest to the truth would get 100 dollars from the other predictors. 

This year was the golden 20 year celebration. Jeremy and I carried a shovel out to The Shack this year to dig up those beat up old coffee cans. Daniel wasn’t with us, but that's a longer story I will get to later. 

We grabbed our shovels, and headed out to the soft earth behind The Shack. I let the much more strapping Jeremy handle the digging, and within just a few minutes, we were staring at our childhood cased in rusty tin. 

We ripped open the tin and picked the millipedes off of the faded scraps of paper we covered with ink so long ago. Jeremy and I dove into our predictions. It wasn't long before we were both laughing hysterically. 

"I thought I would be married to Allie Sharp. Thank God that didn't happen. She’s a One Ton Tina already,” Jeremy said. 

"Holy shit, I can't believe I seriously thought I was going to play in the NBA," I said with genuine astonishment. 

I read on through mine and not a single thing even remotely came close to coming true. About as close as it came was I predicted having a job in Seattle, and I did have a job in the suburbs of Seattle at least.

"Anything even close to being right in yours?" I asked Jeremy. 

"Nah, I thought I would be a fucking lawyer. How lame,” Jeremy answered. 

“Maybe neither of us gotta bust out that hundred dollars,” I said. 

"Well, let's look at Daniel's,” Jeremy suggested. 

Jeremy opened up Daniel's can and started reading his prediction. I didn't think anything of it at first, but my curiosity grew when Jeremy didn't say anything and just read for a handful of minutes. I crept up behind him and started reading Daniel's faded etchings myself. 

I quickly discovered why a hush had washed over Jeremy's drunken mind. Everything in Daniel's prediction about himself was exactly right. *Every single detail.* 

A stiff cold shot into me like an inoculation. My hands started to shake. Daniel's prediction told the exact story of his life past age 12 and it wasn't a good story. 

Daniel slowly trickled out of our trio of friendships after middle school and officially slipped away early in high school. Always the black sheep of our group, he didn't have the clean middle class shine of Jeremy and my family's support him as a kid, and he was already kind of like an amateur drifter by the time we wrote those predictions at age 12. He was always showing up at Jeremy and my parents' house around dinner time unannounced and sleeping over on school nights for multiple nights in a row because his house was a wreck. We were too young to notice it at the time, but Daniel was a ticking time bomb. 

The fuse of that time bomb caught fire just after we made these predictions when Daniel first discovered drugs. Like some cliché out of an after school special, he got offered weed walking home from the bus one day and quickly dove head first into it, alcohol, and countless other problems. 

Pretty soon my parents and Jeremy's parents forbade us from hanging out with Daniel and we didn't really want to anyways, his crowd was rough, he toughened far beyond his years in a quick amount of time, and only seemed to care about drugs, and his on again, off again bad news girlfriends. We were much more interested in playing Playstation and drinking Pepsi than worrying about if our girlfriends were pregnant or cheating on us with drug dealers. 

By the time sophomore year came around, Jeremy and I would barely even say hi to Daniel if we passed him in the hallway and we didn't even need to do that for long. Daniel dropped out before senior year and rumor was he got sent to juvy. 

All of that was in Daniel's prediction, which was eerie enough, but it was what he predicted later that sent shivers down my spine. The predictions about me and Jeremy. 

*Jeremy and Jame will no longer be my friends by the time any of us have driver's licenses, but I won't have any hard feelings about it. Can't blame anyone from running away from a train off the rails on fire, but they themselves might not be able to stay friends. Towards the end of high school, Jeremy is going to suspect Jame of fooling around with his girlfriend and they are going to drift apart until Jame swears he didn't. They will patch things up pretty quickly before college, but James assurances won't be true. He will never tell Jeremy the truth, that he betrayed him, and then lied to him about it.* 

My face burned. What Daniel predicted was exactly the truth. I had lied to Jeremy's face all those years before about a girl who he miraculously ended up marrying and staying with for almost a decade. I could feel awkward anger radiating from Jeremy's body next to mine as we kept reading the prediction written in sloppy ink. 

The rest of Daniel's prediction about himself was as accurate as could be for as far as what I knew about his life after age 16 when he left high school. He drifted in and out of a few cheap rehabs and did a few stints in jail until he got to his early 20s, cleaned up for a short while, and tried to join the military, but never followed through with it. He instead drifted away from society, fell back into drugs, and petty crime until his mid-20s when he supposedly fled a minor warrant in our hometown and moved to Las Vegas. 

This is where we officially lost track of even the “heard it through a friend of a friend of a friend” grapevine in regards to information about Daniel. He disappeared into the dusty, glittery ether of Vegas and I think everyone was okay with that. 

But, Daniel's prediction did not wrap itself up in a tight little coda the way our minds had with him all those years ago. 

His prediction went on:

*I never went to Vegas. That was all a lie to try and attempt to save face for being the biggest loser everyone knew. I stayed right where I always was, in my hometown, but in the shadows. I’ve become the urban legend, surviving in the woods. I’ve become the sound the kids hear on the trail to the river when they are coming home too late after fishing. I’m the story about the guy showering in the girl's locker room at 7 am. I’m the ghost you thought died years ago who still lurks in the dark. Don't forget about me.* 

*I'm around.* 

*Daniel*

There wasn't time to immediately freak out about the end of Daniel's prediction about himself, because his prediction about the adult lives of Jeremy and I were more chilling. 

Here’s what he predicted for us:

*Jeremy and Jame will view me as some kind of tragic story about hopeless life until they are into their 30s when they will realize deceit, tragedy and violence can seep into your life even when you grow up in a clean cul de sac, graduate from a four-year college, and have a "real job." Jeremy will eventually discover the reason his marriage to that sweet, sweet high school sweetheart dissolved and he will finally realize the reason was right under his nose the entire time. Well, actually sleeping across the room from him in our beloved Shack that one warm summer night a year when they come back and don't realize I am watching.* 

Daniel's haunting predictions finally fully absorbed by both of our eyes, Jeremy and I stood silently in The Shack for a few minutes staring at the rotted wood of the floor. 

"Is that shit true?" Jeremy asked and looked at me with wet, bloodshot eyes. 

I looked away as fast as I could. 

"No," I lied and I was sure it was obvious since I couldn't look over at him. "All that shit is crazy, he's watching us? He was just trying to fuck with us and just got incredibly lucky on all these predictions."

"There's no way someone gets that lucky,” Jeremy shot back. 

"So you think he came back here sometime recently, dug up the old cans, wrote down what happened in all our lives, peppered in some bullshit to turn us against each other, and now hovers around the woods like some kind of drug-addicted boogeyman waiting for the day we returned and dug up these cans so he could be like, gotcha?" I asked with a snort. 

Jeremy was panting, and could barely control his breathing. He walked over to his bed and fell down upon his back. 

"This is just too much man. We need to leave,” Jeremy insisted. 

I looked out the window, night had fallen in the forest all around us. Leaving was not an easy option. We had to hike more than a mile to get here on a trail that was hard to follow in the daylight. Trying to do it in the night, with an already-drunk Jeremy was not a good idea. 

Jeremy agreed we couldn’t walk out of there in the night and stomped back to where he left his drink ingredients, mixed himself up another, and took a heavy pull. 

"Make me one of those too?" I asked. 

\*

I tried to sleep in my old familiar sleeping bag, but rest would not come. Even five drinks deep, I could not shut off my valve of adrenaline. I tossed and turned until I opened my eyes and started scanning the wooden headboard of my bed. I saw the marks I had carved into the soft wood for each year I had come back to sleep there, but something other than a simple lines carved into the dirty wood caught my eye. Something freshly scratched into the wood.

*Under your mattress, Jame*

I almost instantly broke out in a sweat inside my toasty sleeping bag. I snuck my arm out of the covers and reached over underneath the mattress. There was something there. I grabbed hold of it and swiftly ripped it out and shoved it into the cover of my sleeping bag.

I pulled the item to my face to see it was an old Playboy I remembered storing out in the woods all those years before. I laughed a tiny bit to myself, maybe this was a joke Jeremy had planned or a note I had left for myself years ago and just never noticed?

But then something fell out of the magazine. I scrambled around the sleeping bag until I found it and pressed it up to my eyes in the near dark. 

*It was a hand-drawn map.* 

The map crudely outlined The Shack, a little fire pit outside the building, and a tiny outhouse behind the thing. Next to the outhouse was an identification for a landmark that only would make sense to Jeremy, Daniel and me - *The Frog Graveyard*. 

One of our favorite activities when we were kids was to search for frogs in the creek and build our own zoos for them to live in the front of The Shack. Our zoos weren't the ideal habitat for the frogs so they frequently died in mass. When our frog friends passed, we would give them a proper burial in front of the Shack in our Frog Graveyard, which was complete with mini headstones we made with rocks we tagged with our departed amphibian friends' names written in permanent marker and carved in with pocket knives. 

Below the marker for the Frog Graveyard on the map was a note:

*Dig here, don't tell Jeremy*
