Cam and I had just fought again before she left for work. It was about everything and nothing. I had instigated it yesterday morning by asking her about her day. She had told me she was off to spend the day with her girlfriends. I didn’t believe her, but I didn’t trust anything she told me. I no longer even bothered texting her to check on her; she came in past midnight reeking of sweat, alcohol, and the remnants of her finest perfume. It had been about a month and a half since she stopped sharing her location with me. In that time, our stagnant relationship had shifted from gradually drifting apart to a smoldering wreck, which filled me with hate. In truth, the outlook notification in the right-hand corner of my screen had drawn irritation; I’d just assumed it was spam and cursed IT for the junk malware software they’d assured us would be an improvement.

It was 3:30, and I had about 30 minutes of actual work left before I could log off. I had loved working from home on Fridays. I could put on a pair of sweats, sleep until 7:30, and get to spend the day with Cam, my loving fiancé. Then she grew distant, and I grew suspicious; the fighting started. Suddenly, she didn’t work from home on Fridays anymore, and I was left stewing. Yesterday morning, it had ended with a “Fuck you, Chris,” and a slamming door on her way to work. She’d been carrying her gym bag, but from how full it was, I’m sure there was more in it than just gym clothes. I had gritted my teeth and worked through the last of the week. 4 hit, and I breathed a sigh of relief and allowed myself to look at my cell phone for more than a few seconds. My eyes were first drawn to the text from Brittany from an hour ago:

Chris babe r u going to the gym❤️😘 ❤️?

I responded: Yeah, I’ll be there about 4:45.

I cringed a bit due to the emojis, but looking at my contact photo for me reminded me of why I was putting up with it. I mean, there were times I felt weird that I was fucking a twenty-year-old. But she’s legal, and I haven’t lied to her about what's going on. I know she’s a little infatuated, but I told her about my bitch fiancé and how she’s cheating on me. Yes, I may not have had exact proof, but I was sure of it. And I didn’t do anything with Brittany until Cam got weird. I jumped over to Snapchat to look at the pictures Brittany had sent me the night before. The kid was dumb enough to let me talk her into saving them in the chat, just not screenshotting them. The girl may be dumb as a stump and a little immature, but god does she have a tight little body. And one which will do anything for me. I had noticed her at the gym a number of months ago, and saw her looking at me with those hazel doe-eyes. I don’t care how innocent she looks, girl is a filthy slut.

A message from Cam popped up: Going to Kristen’s for the weekend.

I muttered “Bitch” under my breath. She’d just gone to her sister’s last weekend, and something told me she wasn’t gonna be making that same several-hour drive north again this weekend. I don’t care what Kristen had said; that cunt hates me even more than Cam and would cover for her no matter what. I felt my blood boil and reflexively squeezed my fist so hard I thought a blood vessel would burst. Just then, I heard the sound of another email notification on my computer. I had completely forgotten to turn it off and was not expecting someone to send me an email after four on a Friday. But there it was again, that junk email with the subject line reading:
Mr. Wright! Your Access to the Offer Has Been Approved

I was sure it was junk mail, but something about it felt off, even for scam, and so I opened the email. The email was from outreach@PCI.org, which was unlike any other scam email address I had ever seen. Typically, something like support1234@gmail.com or service-center.alerts.notify@yahoo.com, but this seemed different, and I was even more stunned by the email.

I sat in stunned silence and reread the email. I no longer viewed it as spam but rather a joke. There were no links to click, it didn’t request any information, and, in fact, it also didn’t provide any information. Someone at the office had to be pranking me, but I wasn’t close enough to anyone that I would suspect them of having pulled it. Several of my friends fancied themselves as being comedians, but I don’t remember giving any of them my work email. The email definitely was not real, but I was also struggling to see the humor in it. It was nearly 4:25 when I saw that Brittany had sent me a text twenty minutes earlier:

Yayyy 🥳see u soon!

I changed quickly and sucked down my pre-workout on the way to the gym. Brittany was already halfway through her set of hip thrusts when I got in. She lit up when she saw me, and she lit even brighter when I told her Cam was leaving for the weekend and she’d be coming over. It was an order, not an offer, and I could see in her eyes just how much fucking me in the bed I’d once shared with my fiancé turned her on. Brittany explained she had plans to go out to a club that night and invited me. I turned her down; it was bad enough people saw us together at the gym, I sure as fuck was not going to be seen with a bunch of college kids at a club. No one at the gym knew me or Cam, but I noticed the looks some people gave us when we worked out together. Like I said, she’s an adult and can make her own choices, so those looks don’t bother me. But if it ever got out that I was having an affair with a girl more than ten years younger than me, I’d be screwed. I’d lose my job, and the family would turn their back on me. In truth, that wouldn’t bother me too much, but I’d lose my reputation and maybe more importantly, my inheritance. Appearances matter; that is what Dad had always told me.

So long as Cam and I kept up the appearance of being a loving, happy, successful, and god-fearing couple, it didn’t really matter what we did behind closed doors in the eyes of our families. It mattered to me, though, I wasn’t going to let that bitch make a fool of me without getting mine.

Speaking of closed doors, when we got back to the apartment, I took her first in the shower. After drying off, I lay her out on our bed and teased her until she was begging me to fuck her. Brittany has some daddy issues, probably why she’s with me, and also probably why she calls me that when we are having sex. While I lost myself in the pleasures of her body, all I could think about was my anger at Cam. She had made it come to this. I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her, and now I’d be forced to. So be it, if that’s how it would be, I’d fuck a tight fit in her bed to spite her. I finished in Brittany thinking about my bitch fiancé. The post-nut clarity of this realization made me laugh. Brittany had been trying to cuddle me and was startled.

We lay in silence for a time. Brittany broke it, “Chris, are you ever going to leave her?” It was a conversation she’d brought up last weekend, and I didn’t want to have it anymore now than I did then.

“Brittany, sweetie, can we not have this conversation now?” I said. She had begun to protest, but I shut her up with a kiss and a tight hug. I’d gladly cuddle her if it meant I could avoid a real conversation with her. As I traced my fingers along Brittany’s back, I thought about her question. Would I ever leave Cam? As much as I wanted to, could I do it? We no longer loved each other, but the expectation was that we would get married. If we did, though, then we’d be tied together and there would be no escape. But I also didn’t feel there was an escape now.

Her father wasn’t just some mid-level suit; he was the VP of the investment firm. And as much as I hated him, the smugness, the way he treated people like line items on a spreadsheet, he’d still been the one who opened the door for me to get this job. It was the job that paid for this high-rise apartment, the job that let me build a portfolio that would make any of my colleagues jealous. It was the job that gave me the kind of professional credibility you can’t just buy, the kind that gets your calls returned. Every perk, every bit of prestige I had now was tied, directly or indirectly, to him, which made the thought of cutting ties feel less like freedom and more like throwing myself off a cliff. Fuck him, fuck her, fuck me.

It was about 8 when Brittany stirred and pleaded with me one more time to come out with her and her friends. I swallowed my irritation and lied to her that I needed to be up early for a work meeting. She doesn’t know anything about anything, so she bought it. Going out dancing with a bunch of kids wasn’t my idea of fun, so while Brittany stepped into the bathroom to get ready, I headed to the kitchen to pour myself the first of what I assumed would be several glasses of bourbon. I had just poured my second when I saw the text from Cam:
I am heading to Kristen’s now. When I return on Sunday night, we need to have a serious conversation.

I gritted my teeth and swallowed hard. The amber gold that had been warming my throat and chest erupted into flames of hate. I fired back:
What the fuck is there to talk about?

While I walked back to the bedroom, now carrying the entire bottle, I shot off a text to Kristen: Hey Kristen! Take good care of Cam this weekend

Brittany was listening to Olivia Rodrigo or Billie Eilish or some other fucking slop in the bathroom, I yelled at her to turn it down as I lay back into the bed and turned on the TV. A nice buzz and a good movie would constitute an alright night in my book, usually anyway. The rage inside of me kept my thoughts preoccupied with Cam, though. I had taken a swig when there it was again, the unmistakable sound of an email. Didn't I turn it off? If I didn't, shouldn't it have timed out by now? I went to my desk and sure enough, there it was again:
Mr. Wright! Your Access to the Offer Has Been Approved

I was disquieted, but certainly intrigued, and so I opened this third email. This time, the email was slightly different:

Dear Mr. Wright,
You have been chosen with clear intention, and your access to a rare and highly selective offering has been approved. This opportunity is designed with precision to meet exactly what you require.

This isn’t a standard proposal or an ordinary opportunity. What we present to you is a gateway to a service that operates beyond conventional boundaries: discreet, efficient, and unmistakably effective. Its nature is confidential, but rest assured, it aligns perfectly with your needs and will deliver results that we are confident will meet your exact requirements.

We look forward to your prompt response.

Perditio Consilia International

I laughed. This was too much. Brittany called out to me: “Everything ok, babe?” I didn’t answer; I was busy looking up Perditio Consilia International. The name sounded vaguely European, maybe Italian, yet the Google search yielded nothing. Some bible verses and definitions from the fucking dictionary, but nothing about PCI. Brittany stepped out of the bathroom and towards me, wearing a skin-tight, sequined mini dress with a plunging neckline, a backless cut, and slits high enough to flash a glimpse of thigh with every step. She spun for me with an innocent smile and asked, “ What do you think?”

I roughly pulled her close, grabbing her by the throat and slipping a hand between her legs, whispering to her, “I think I want round two.”

From the way she squirmed and the noise which escaped her, I knew she did too, but she said “Daddddyy, I need to go!”

I growled at her, “Then go, but don’t you fucking dare look at another guy.” I slapped her ass and sent her to the door; she knew better than to ask for a kiss. I could hear Brittany making her way to the door and then leaving the apartment. My phone screen lit up, and I saw a notification from Kristen.

It was a simple:? I rushed to open the notification and opened the messaging app just in time to see the question mark disappear and three dots appear. The fire in my chest returned, but this time I felt a rush of satisfaction. That fucking bitch! Kristen had slipped; it didn’t matter that her next text said: Forgot she was coming up again, I will.

I decided to take a break from the scotch and went to the kitchen to pour myself a glass of 1982 Château Lafite Rothschild, and one quickly became two. I returned to the computer with less of a buzz and more of a drunk. I opened the third email and, without really thinking, wrote back:

Is this a joke?
I sent it without thinking and made to head back to the bed when I heard another notification. This email had the header:

Re: Mr. Wright! Your Access to the Offer Has Been Approved

I laughed, a response time like that, and this had to be a scam. Only automated emails reply this fast. I opened it and read its content:

Dear Mr. Wright,
Your question is understandable, yet we assure you—this is not a joke, nor is it a trivial attempt at contact. The selection process that identified you was deliberate, measured, and guided by criteria known only to our internal channels.

The opportunity presented to you is both genuine and finite. It is extended only to those whose profile and circumstances align precisely with our own operational pursuits. That you were contacted at all is the result of a decision neither random nor reversible.

We operate quietly, without publicity or fanfare, because the nature of our service demands discretion and control. Those who have engaged with us in the past have experienced results that are precise, impactful, and unparalleled in comparison to standard market offerings.

If you wish to proceed, we require only your written confirmation. Once received, you will be assigned directly to an associate within PCI who will facilitate the transition from introduction to execution.

My assurance that this was a scam was somewhat shaken, although I was unsure what to make of it. I took another sip, well, swallow, of wine and tried to gather my thoughts. This company, which had no online presence to speak of, was reaching out to me directly, having selected me in a cryptic process, and was promising me an enigmatic service which was said to be precise, impactful, and unparalleled. I don’t know who was writing these messages, but I thought my team could use them. I was smart enough to know to be careful, but intrigued enough to reply back:
Yes, I am interested.

I again expected to hear and see a nearly instantaneous reply, but this time I sat for nearly another minute before the notification flashed onto the screen:

Formal Introduction and Next Steps

Dear Mr. Wright,

Allow me to formally introduce myself. My name is B.L. Quitentant, and I have been appointed to oversee your engagement following your recent confirmation of interest. From this point forward, I will exclusively handle your matter.

You should understand that your inclusion within our process is neither arbitrary nor commonplace. The conditions under which you were selected are precise, deliberate, and by their very nature immutable. This offer, though discreet, is transformative in scope. It is designed to align with your exact needs and to deliver, without deviation, the outcome you have desired.

Proceeding will require your explicit authorization. Upon receipt of your written approval, I will initiate the necessary mechanisms to advance your case. From that moment, events will move with a precision and inevitability from which there will be no recourse.
I advise you to consider this step carefully, though hesitation may not serve you well. Opportunities of this nature do not reappear, and once you are engaged, the path forward will be absolute.

Kindly reply to this message with your consent, and I will act without delay. Should you have any questions or require further clarification, please do not hesitate. I have been assigned to ensure you receive the most diligent service we can offer.

Respectfully,

B.L. Quitentant

Case Manager

“The fuck kind of name is Quitentant?” I muttered to myself as I turned to Google to search for the man who was now emailing me. This time, Google gave me an A.I. overview: “B.L. Quitentant does not appear to be a known individual in the general context of professions or achievements. However, the search results suggest the term might relate to discussions about individuals quitting or entering the Boys' Love (BL) industry.”

I laughed, taking the serious tension that had been building away. I can only imagine what the Boy’ Love industry is, but I wasn’t about to Google that and be placed on a list. I finished the glass of wine and poured scotch into the empty glass. I reread the man's email and fought back the urge to again ask if this was for real. I was sure this would only result in another ambiguous and flowery email, which explained that this was for real, without actually explaining what ‘this’ was. I wrote the man a follow-up, though my inebriated state did not help:

Look Mr. Quitenant, I am flatered that you guys have taken an interest in me. But I dont know why. I dont know what your ofrering and I don’t know what it would cost.

That was the email I had sent, and that was after about five minutes of drunken editing. I looked at the wine glass of scotch and thought it was probably time to add some water or a snack to the mix. I looked at the time and was shocked to see it was eleven. That couldn’t be right. Although I had consumed a lot of alcohol, I was just looking at a few emails and doing a couple of quick Google searches. Yet, almost three hours flew by in an instant. I looked at my phone, seeing 40-plus notifications. 

Brittany had sent me 11 texts and three Snapchats, all of which I presumed were her drunken messages about how much fun she was having, how much she loved me, how she felt like she was being taken advantage of, and how she wanted to be with me and only me. That's how she typically acted when she was drinking, so I responded as I typically would and ignored it. I am not in the business of taking advantage of drunk women, and besides, I was too inebriated by this point. I had forgotten entirely about what I was about to do when the next email arrived:

Re: Formal Introductions and Next Steps

Dear Mr. Wright,

I appreciate your candor and willingness to respond, despite the uncertainty this correspondence may engender. It is important to clarify certain matters, as your questions are both understandable and anticipated.

Your selection was not made lightly nor without careful consideration of your present circumstances. We recognize, perhaps more keenly than you have allowed yourself to acknowledge, an intense yearning within you, a desire that remains unspoken, even to yourself. It is precisely this latent aspiration, this unarticulated pursuit, that has drawn our attention.

The service we offer is bespoke and designed to fulfill that very void, delivering precisely what you seek, even if the contours of that longing remain elusive to your conscious mind. Our intervention transcends conventional measures and promises results aligned perfectly with the deepest dimensions of your need.

I must emphasize that there is no financial cost associated with this engagement. Our arrangements operate beyond the realm of typical transactions, governed instead by conditions that we shall disclose in due course, conditions that reflect the gravity and singularity of the opportunity extended to you.

Should you choose to proceed, your path forward will unfold with deliberate precision, and the impact will be as profound as it is irreversible. I remain at your disposal to guide you through any further inquiries you may have.
Respectfully,

B.L. Quitentant

Case Manager

Perditio Consilia International

In truth, this email was beyond me at the time, and in all honesty, it remains so now. It still feels like a dream, while drunk, even more so. A service that was ‘bespoke’, filling a ‘void’, meeting the ‘deepest dimensions’ of my needs, no ‘financial cost,’ it all sounded too good to be true. So I tried to call Mr. Quitentant out on this:
This all sounds too goof to be ture. I work in inesesting, I make a lot of money. People don’t just give things away for free.

This time, I did not look away, but kept my eyes peeled on the screen for that following email, and after a few agonizing moments, it arrived:

Re: Formal Introductions and Next Steps

Dear Mr. Wright,

I understand your caution. In matters of this magnitude, skepticism is a sign of discernment, and I would expect nothing less from you.

You are correct, there is a cost. Although it is not monetary in nature, it remains significant nonetheless. The service we extend to you operates outside the familiar structures of commerce; its value cannot be measured in currency.

This cost is not arbitrary, nor is it extracted without purpose. It will be commensurate with the magnitude of what you receive. You will find it neither unbearable nor disproportionate; indeed, in light of what will be delivered to you, it will seem not merely reasonable but a bargain.

I will not conceal from you that the nature of this cost is deeply personal. It will require a willingness to release and accept a change, whose scope may only become apparent in due time. Yet I assure you, Mr. Wright, those who have walked this path before you have found the exchange more than favorable.

To hesitate is to prolong the state you are in now. To proceed is to step decisively into the life you have been yearning for.

If you can accept this cost and are willing to let me guide the process from this point forward, then I will begin the next steps without delay. Opportunities of this nature are not presented twice.

If you are prepared to move forward, I will ensure that the necessary mechanisms are put into motion. Once begun, the process will move forward with precision, and completion will follow as surely as the tide.

Respectfully,

B.L. Quitentant

Case Manager

Perditio Consilia International

As surely as the tide, huh. I picked up the wine glass and, with resignation, downed the last of the bourbon. I wasn’t stupid. In that moment, I was drunk, but I knew that whatever the cost would be, this offer would be worth it. I replied to Quitentant:
Ok I accept

In that moment, I felt a wave of relief wash over me, much like when a thunderstorm finally passes. All the anger, hatred, and resentment I had been holding onto, like a fire burning deep within my soul, suddenly faded away. Even though I was still drunk, and I mean shitted, a sense of contentment settled in. Qutientant responded:

Re: Formal Introductions and Next Steps

Dear Mr. Wright,

It is with great satisfaction that I receive your acceptance. Your decision marks the threshold of a most singular journey, one from which there shall be no turning back, and one whose destination is nothing less than the very fulfillment of your deepest, most resolute desire.

All that remains is a single, decisive act: your signature upon the attached document. This solitary motion will set into motion a sequence of events already poised to unfold with unwavering precision. Once complete, the offer will be sealed, and the mechanisms that will deliver precisely what you desire will begin.

In due course, and without the burden of uncertainty, you will possess what you have long pursued, whether in conscious yearning or the quiet recesses of your mind.

I thank you for the trust you have placed in us, and I greatly look forward to the moment when our paths will next cross.

Respectfully,

B.L. Quitentant

Attached to the email was a link that redirected me to a document. The document was in a foreign language, and unlike the emails from Quitentant, it has since disappeared. At the bottom was the box in which I was to place my signature. In my drunken state, I managed to type out my name:

Chris Wright

The screen vanished into black, and a headrush overcame me, a dizzying fusion of the electric high of a first bump of cocaine and the harrowing, stomach lurching plunge of a fall from a great height, before the darkness swallowed me whole.

The first few times I heard the phone ringing, I rolled over in the drunken haze that comes after a blackout but before a hangover. The next time it rang, I silenced my phone, noting that I was now in my bed. By this point, the sun was pouring into the apartment because my drunk ass hadn’t closed the curtains. After a few more hours of half-sleep and staring at the ceiling, I finally looked at my phone and saw that it was 11:30 in the morning. To my surprise, I had over 200 notifications waiting for me. The latest was from Brittany, one of 44 text notifications from her, this one said:
Chris, I am so so so sorry I got so drunk last night please please forgive me ❤️❤️❤️

I quickly fired back without bothering to check the previous text she had sent:
All good

ood

The next message I saw, though, was from my Mom:
Chris, please call me when you get this. I love you. We will get through this

The next was from my sister:
Chris please please call me

One message after another, apologies and pleas to call back. Somewhere in the haze, I remembered, faintly, PCI… and B.L. Quitentant. Surely that hadn’t been real. 
That couldn’t have been real. Could it? Yet a warm flicker of glee began to rise in my gut, pushing past the dull ache of the hangover, curling my lips into the beginnings of a smile. It deepened as I began listening to the voicemails, each one sweeter than the last:

“Hello, uh, Mr. Wright, this is State Trooper Daniels with the Highway Patrol. I’m calling with some very difficult news... I’m sorry to inform you that your ah fiancée, Cameron, was involved in a serious car accident while driving northbound earlier today. Unfortunately... she did not survive the crash. I am terribly sorry for your loss. Her body has been moved to the medical examiner’s office. Please reach out to them for next steps; their number is (555) 372-9146. Again, I’m truly sorry for your loss.”
