I’m writing this one year after the death of my grandfather. He was about to turn 103 when he finally succumbed to the on-again/off-again battle with cancer he had been fighting for twenty years. First it was his prostate, then his stomach, and finally, his liver. A World War II veteran, it would be simple and convenient to describe him as a “tough, old bastard,” but it wouldn’t be accurate. He was too complex, too thoughtful for that. Unflappable might be the best word I’ve heard used for him. My father described him that way. He said it was like my grandfather had seen things that scared him so much that a deadly but mundane thing like cancer barely even moved him. He never talked about his time in the war very much. I knew he’d served in the U.S. Army and fought in Europe during 1944-45. I pressed him hard on it once when I was a teenager. Eager to hear about an explosive battle or extreme bloodshed, I pestered him until he silenced me with a look I had never seen in a man before or since. It was like he was staring at me from someplace else, somewhere thick with forbidden knowledge I was better off without. Then he said something to me I’ve never forgotten:

“If you keep asking questions like this, you’ll have to share a burden with me no one else will understand. I’m strong enough to live with it, but I don’t know about you yet.”

What’s an awkward middle school kid supposed to say to that? It was the first time my calm, genial grandpa who normally had answers for everything truly frightened me. It took almost another thirty years, but he eventually did decide to let me in on what he saw, albeit posthumously. Once he knew the end was coming, he took an old journal out of storage and had it wrapped and set aside for me until he passed. It covered a year of his life starting after the Battle of Berlin in May 1945, when the Allies forced the Nazis’ unconditional surrender, until sometime in 1946 when he was assisting with the reorganization of postwar Germany. A particular section was bookmarked and labeled with a pair of sticky notes that read “I investigated a Nazi-occupied castle in 1945. For 80 years my story was too dangerous to tell,” and “Grandson—do as you like.” I got to reading it the week after the funeral. It was bizarre and read more like something out of a midcentury horror novel than a war journal. Upon finishing, I understood why he had kept this account to himself for so long. If true (and my grandfather was not one to fabricate or seek attention) it had the potential to threaten much of what we think we know about the war and even the human race. If taken seriously, it could also piss a lot of people off. My grandfather decided it was better not to share, but now he had passed that decision on to me. After deliberating for a year, I have made a different choice. I’m going to share an excerpt from my grandfather’s journal here, where it will either be dismissed as the fantastical ravings of a delusional, young war veteran, or it will be believed. His story follows:

From the Journal of Jack Mikan, 2nd Lt.

United States Army, 4th Infantry Division

July 20, 1945

On the orders of Maj. General Barton, I traveled to the small village of Wewelsburg, fifty miles east of Dortmund and eighty miles southwest of Hanover. I was tasked with investigating reports of strange behavior among the villagers. The area’s focal point was Wewelsburg Castle, a former SS sanctuary rumored to be the site of occult activity. The 83rd Armored Battalion seized the castle in April. After the 83rd departed, German civilians looted it of anything the SS had not previously taken with them. But when reports of hysteria and sickness later emerged, the general became concerned that remnants of the SS had returned to Wewelsburg.

I did not have orders to enter the castle. Instead, Corporal Schayes and I were to interview and assess the villagers and report our findings to the general’s staff. I knew a platoon of 20-40 soldiers could be sent if the castle needed retaking. I saw myself as an odd choice for the assignment at first. I was not a doctor or trained to evaluate people. Corporal Schayes reminded me that I spoke the best German of any American he knew. He was right. My ability to speak fluently with the villagers and my understanding of local history and customs might be all that was needed for now. The war in Europe was over, but the Army’s resources were spread thin sorting out the mess Hitler had left us.

We arrived in Wewelsburg at 1100 hours. The weather was sunny and clear, the hottest day of the summer to that point. The village had suffered little damage during the taking of the castle three months before. The only telltale sign of fighting was the collapsed roof of a one-story municipal building and patchwork repairs to cover up fire damage to several two-story houses. The castle loomed nearby on a low, wooded hill at the edge of the village to our west. The stone structure was in the shape of a triangle with three straight wings four stories high and three circular towers five stories high. The north and south towers were intact, but the southeast tower was in ruin with its top three stories demolished in a failed attempt by the SS to destroy the castle before they fled. I found it odd they wanted to destroy it. Wewelsburg Castle held no strategic significance. Its purposes were purportedly educational and ceremonial. What could they be hiding, I wondered?

No sooner had we exited the car, then a very curious thing happened. A villager, a tall man in his fifties wearing a homburg hat, approached us from one of the buildings. “Are you not of the soil?” he asked in some of the most polite, cheerful German I had ever heard.

“I’m sorry but I don’t know what you mean,” I said to him, also in German.

“This place…it is…strange…Are we all of the soil?” he replied. The man looked at us with an unusual, idyllic expression: a slight smile with the mouth closed and the eyelids pulled back into their sockets.

“Are you from around here?” I asked. “Is this village your home?”

“Around here? Of the air? It is a very…fine place.” He turned and surveyed the space around him, looking at it as a child might.

I whispered my observations about the man to Schayes. He did not appear to know where he was or even who he was, and the idyllic look never left his face. Schayes noted he had the habit of rubbing his forearms, and when he did, a layer of dirt rubbed off as if it were flakes of his own skin. The man’s face looked parched and dry, and when beads of sweat rolled down his forehead, the wet streaks seemed to turn to mud.

“Are you of the soil?” the man asked Schayes. Schayes, who did not speak German, looked to me for instruction.

“Let’s move along,” I said, “and see if there are more like him.”

We walked around him down the village street. The man was following us when we looked back. We picked up our pace until we noticed he had stopped. He was now stooped over talking to a young boy of nine or ten.

“It is well to prosper in the sun,” the boy said to the man.

“Is it well? Yes. Until the astronomical angle,” the man said. “Why does one prosper in the sun?”

“Because aren’t we all of the soil?” asked the boy.

Then the man stood up and pointed at us. “They are not of the soil.”

They stood still and stared. Schayes and I kept walking. We turned down several more streets. We saw dozens more villagers out and about. All wandered aimlessly and stopped only when they crossed paths with each other. Without exception, they exchanged bizarre pleasantries about soil, sun, air, trees, and blood. Some of these greetings were phrased as questions while others came as statements. There was no observable pattern. One would make a statement, then another would nod along with a question or offer another statement seemingly unrelated to the first.

“The blood runs thick when we are among the trees.”

“Are we among each other when we are among the trees?”

“Yes. Is it well to be among the trees?”

“It is well to be of the blood. Are you of the soil?”

They would go back and forth like so, then carry on. Even I became confused trying to translate their conversations for Schayes. It was impossible to make sense of. We realized the villagers seemed to leave us alone if we kept our distance from them. They seemed aware of us but did not approach unless we strayed within a few arms’ length. More of them watched us through windows and doorways. Every one of them had the same look. It was an odd smile stretched gently across their cheeks with a slight wrinkling of the eyes that suggested contentment. But there was also an uncomfortable curling of the upper lip suggesting confusion. Schayes said it was as if the entire village had the same face.

On the east side of the village lay the abandoned site of the Niederhagen concentration camp. It had been one of the Nazis’ smallest camps and did not function as an extermination camp in the way of larger camps such as Auschwitz or Dachau. The inmates’ conditions were still barbaric, but its primary purpose had been as a labor camp to expand and redevelop Wewelsburg Castle to suit Heinrich Himmler and the SS’s liking. I decided to investigate the grounds of the former camp next. While walking, I thought more about the strange comments the villagers made. They bore some resemblance to the Nazi concept of “Blood and Soil.” This was the idea that a race’s blood was intrinsically linked to the cultivation of their homeland’s soil and the nature that sprung from it. To the mind of a German racial theorist, superior land equaled a superior race. I had studied this racial doctrine as a way to better know my enemy, but I had never given it any credibility. The villagers’ remarks seemed frighteningly close for comfort.

“Mikan, there are two villagers following us twenty yards back. Two women,” Schayes alerted me.

By then we had reached the perimeter of Niederhagen. I stopped and turned to the side as if surveying the camp. I glimpsed the two women in my peripheral vision. They ducked and rushed to hide behind a building corner.

“Schayes, they’re different than the others,” I said. “We have to speak to them. Maybe they know what’s going on.” Schayes and I circled the small building from opposite sides. We holstered our weapons. The women needed to not perceive us as dangerous. Still, one of them attempted to run for the trees when they saw us again. “Friends. Friends!” I said in German.

“American?” the woman who did not run asked.

“Yes. We are Americans,” I said warmly.

“Ella, it’s safe!” the woman near us shouted to the one who ran.

“They look like them!” The farther woman shouted back.

Schayes leaned in close. “I think they’re Jewish,” he said.

I looked at the near woman closely. She did look Jewish. I wondered if this could have something to do with why they were not behaving strangely like the other villagers. I guessed she was about twenty-five.

“My name is Lieutenant Mikan and this is Corporal Schayes,” I said to her. “What’s your name.”

“Edith,” the near woman said. “Your soldiers liberated our village. I know you aren’t a danger to us.”

“Why is she afraid?” I asked her of the woman who ran.

“She is my younger sister, Ella. She knows you aren’t Nazis. But neither are the others in our village. She’s afraid you’ll soon become like them.”

Edith pointed at an old woman walking near the concentration camp boundary. The old woman stopped to bend down and look at a weed growing from under the fence. Her back was turned to us, but when she stood, the weed was now sprouting out of her neck as if it had grown from under her skin. There were by now many more villagers wandering, dozens more in our vicinity alone. They all behaved in the same strange way. One man strayed near Edith. He had the same idyllic look as the others.

“Do you not prosper in the sun?” he asked her.

“I prosper in the sun. We all do,” she replied, mimicking his tone of voice.

“The angle is high. To the sonnenmensch…all is well.” He nodded and carried on.

A German word he spoke caught my ear. Sonnenmensch. It had both a literal meaning and one far more sinister. I decided not to mention it to Schayes until I knew more.

“Do you know what happened to them?” I asked Edith once the man had left.

“Come with us. It’s almost noon. I’ll tell you everything I know,” she said.

Edith took us back to a small cottage where she and Ella had been living for the past two months. Ella watched from across the room while her older sister told us what they had gone through. They had not been inmates at Niederhagen. Nazi policy was to intern prisoners at camps away from their homes. Prior to the war, Edith and Ella had lived their entire lives in Wewelsburg. Her family was evicted in 1938 and relocated to a ghetto in Kassel. Then in 1942 they were forced to move again, to Buchenwald, a large concentration camp 160 miles east of Wewelsburg. Their parents died there while the sisters were kept alive to mop floors, sew clothing, and please the SS guards. The 9th Armored Battalion liberated Buchenwald in April 1945, and by May, the sisters had returned to Wewelsburg. Their old family home had been demolished, so they took up residence in this abandoned cottage.

Village life gradually returned to normal until the date of June 21st. A neighbor of theirs claimed to see a group of a dozen men sneak into the castle at dawn. He assumed they were Americans, but they did not wear uniforms so he couldn’t be certain. Later that day, just after 1200 hours, everyone in the village suffered something horrible. Edith had been outside when it happened. A series of loud thrumming sounds filled the air as if the village was some kind of giant radio receiver. She saw people’s bodies spasm, limbs flailing, people falling down in the street. She saw one man’s head twist so sharply that he snapped his neck and died where he stood. Every man, woman, and child in the village fainted, all at the same time. Everyone except for Edith and Ella. They, it seemed, were immune. The villagers awoke minutes later. They were shaken and confused, but they carried on with their days after tending to the injured. The situation worsened over the following days and weeks. People began to lose their personalities, memories, and knowledge of how to perform daily tasks such as dressing and eating. It now made sense to me. Many of the villagers Schayes and I had seen looked starved. Their clothes were filthy and some were improperly worn. In time, many of them developed bizarre ailments that seemed tied to the very ground they were living on.

“Do you think you are immune because you are Jewish?” I asked.

“I don’t know,” said Edith, “but we have wondered that as well.”

“Ask her why Ella is afraid of us. We weren’t here when it happened,” said Schayes. I translated the question for Edith.

“There’s a spirit in the air. It won’t enter me, but I feel it,” she said. “Ella is afraid if you stay here for long, it will take you too.”

“Do the others try to hurt you?” I asked her.

“Not yet. But if we are outside at noon when the sun is highest and more of them are out, they will try to surround us.”

“Are you saying they follow the sun?”

“Yes,” she said. “Exactly.”

It was why Edith wanted us to come inside with them when we did. It was also why the number of villagers outdoors increased from the time we arrived. By now it was mid-afternoon. The shadows cast on the ground were longer and the number of villagers in the street fewer. Edith and Ella took us back outdoors and around the village. They showed us more people with strange ailments. We walked west across the village to where the woods surrounded the hill with the castle atop it. I spotted a pair of buzzards circling above the castle’s north tower, a small species brown in color common to Europe. When we reached the trees, we were met with another curious and dreadful sight. A group of villagers, six men and women in all, were stuck to two large oak trees. They were attached at their stomachs and their backs, some with their arms and legs wrapped around the trunks. When I looked closer, I saw that where they touched, their skin and the bark became one. It even grew through the fabric where it touched their clothes. But their faces still had the idyllic look shared with all the others.

“Can they be freed?” I asked Edith.

She shook her head. “At first, but not any longer.”

Then they showed us a man on his hands and knees alone in a field. He looked much like the man who greeted us on our arrival, but his condition was more dire. His hands and forearms were inseparable from the dirt and no longer looked like human flesh at all. I doubted he could free himself if he had wanted to. His neck twisted stiffly as he looked up. His smiling lips flaked and parted, but when he moved them to speak, a fine dust spewed from his mouth.

“How long has he been out here?” I asked.

Ella spoke up this time, seeming at ease with us for now. “At least three days. The sun is drying him out, but he refuses water.”

Then a brown buzzard swooped down and landed on the man’s head. We scattered back and watched in horror as the buzzard grabbed the man’s nose in its beak, snapped it clean off, and flew off into the sky. More dust fell from the open nasal cavity, but the man seemed not to care.

“We can’t help these people,” Schayes said to me in English. I nodded to him, then Edith took my arm.

“There is one more we have to show you,” she said with a grim look.

They took us back across the village in the direction of Niederhagen to a cottage much like theirs. Once I saw the villager inside, I understood why they had shown us this one last. The villager was a woman named Margrit, older than the sisters but still of child-bearing age. She was naked and lay on her side on a wooden table. From her mouth grew a branch or a vine leading out a window to a tree abutting the cottage. The vine must have grown straight through the woman’s innards, as it came out her anus sprouting leaves or vines. Schayes and I both had to look away. Worse still, she was pregnant, and the fetus grew externally on the woman’s side. I saw a head, hands, and feet, all growing within a translucent layer of the woman’s skin.

The baby’s father sat calmly still on a chair across the room. He was one of the villagers without a visible ailment, but the eerie, idyllic expression was still present. “It is well to be of the soil, the trees, the blood,” he said to us. “Do you know the sonnenmensch?”

There it was again, the word that frightened me. “We need to contact the general right away,” I said to Schayes. “We have to go back to our car.” I then told Edith.

“Not now,” she replied. “It’s almost dusk.”

“Why?” Schayes asked in English. “What does that matter?”

“The astronomical angle!” shouted the father while pointing out the window.

It was the second time I had heard that phrase as well. I couldn’t tell if he understood Schayes or if he had noticed the position of the sun coincidentally at that moment.

“What happens at dusk?” I asked.

“Something happens to them. They become crazy. It’s not safe.” said Ella.

“They’re already crazy,” I replied. “We have to radio our general.”

“Don’t leave us. Help us,” said Edith.

“We’re going to get you help we can’t give on our own. We won’t leave. I promise,” I told her.

Schayes and I left the cottage and trekked back to the car we’d parked in the village center. Twilight was waning fast. The villagers had been out in numbers at noon and dwindled afterward. Now with night approaching, they were out in the streets again. We avoided them by moving quickly. Once at the car, I radioed HQ and briefed the staff sergeant on what we’d seen. I used less remarkable descriptions than I would have preferred. I needed the situation in Wewelsburg to sound plausible. If I described it in detail, I’d risk not being believed. Then finally, I had a piece of information I insisted I deliver to Major General Barton personally.

“This is Barton. Go ahead, Lieutenant,” the general said after a delay when the sergeant fetched him.

“General, I fear the situation here is more serious than we thought. Multiple villagers have mentioned a major Nazi war criminal, the Sonnenmensch. Sir, I think we’ve located the Solar Man.”

I had already told Schayes what I knew about this man on the way to the car. His name was Wolfgang Müller and he was an oberführer in the SS, a high officer’s rank between a colonel and a brigadier general with no direct U.S. Army equivalent. He was the most infamous senior SS member whose whereabouts remained unknown after Germany’s surrender. His nickname referred to his habit of burning men alive. He was known to burn POWs, Jewish people, and even men under his own command who failed to perform to his standards. The saying was, like the sun, if you got too close to Müller, you burned.

The general told me to stand by. As we did, the number of villagers in the street around us doubled. It was difficult to tell if they were surrounding us as Ella had worried or if they were simply following the vanishing sun. The little remaining twilight was behind the castle directly to our west. The sight of their dozens of eerie, idyllic faces gave me a shiver.

The general’s voice came back over the radio. “Mikan, I’m sending a squad to your location, one specially equipped to deal with things like this. Your orders are to remain in Wewelsburg until contacted tomorrow by Captain Pettit of the 14th Army. He’ll brief you further once he and his men arrive. Do not enter the castle or attempt to find Müller on your own.”

“Copy that, General,” I said.

I put down the radio. Schayes and I traded nervous looks as the last traces of twilight disappeared beneath the horizon. Once the sky had blackened, a tall, brunette woman near us threw an arm across her face, leaned back, and screamed. It was the loudest, most bloodcurdling scream I had ever heard, even after two years of fighting on the front. More villagers followed, screaming, shrieking, and moaning, dropping their peaceful expressions and thrashing their bodies about like victims of a rabid plague.

“We have to get inside!” Schayes shouted over the cacophony.

“Stay in the car! We’ll head for the sisters’ cottage!” I shouted back.

I climbed into the seat and turned a corner, narrowly avoiding running over a manic villager. More of them swarmed the car. I had gotten used to their strange daytime behavior, but this terrible panic was different. I feared not just for our own safety, but for theirs. The last thing I wanted was to inadvertently injure or kill any of them. I hoped Edith and Ella were safe too, and that they could provide us with shelter [until morning.](https://connorgunnin.com/)
