The neighbors taught us the game. Well, I can’t really say neighbors, they lived a full block away from us. But Terry and I were In the same grade at school, and my parents were close with his. The Kenties had ten kids. Most of them were older than us, one was even married with his own kid. My sister and I were sent over to their house every summer, warm weekend, or free day while my parents were at work. This had been the system ever since I turned thirteen. 

One summer, Mom had just started her new training at the hospital, so for a few months, she’d work night shifts for a week or so before switching back. We’d head over after ten, when mom went to bed after her night shift, and then we’d come back by to get the food she’d left us in the fridge for lunch before going back over. It was weird, and she apologized all the time for it, but I’d say we were pretty mature kids all things considered.

Charlotte and I genuinely enjoyed hanging out with them. Sure they were competitive and a little nuts sometimes, but we were too. I’d go as far as saying I grew up part Kentie. I didn’t mind spending hours with them because none of us ever grew tired or bitter with each other. Their house was very welcoming. That and they also had a Playstation. And RipStix. And an untapped imagination when it came to going to the park or fucking around at the splash pad or finding where the plows shoved the parking lot snow into massive peaks of ice.

I remember now how often Terrence Kentie’s imagination should have gotten us killed. Races at breakneck speed down the alleyway connecting our houses together, the time we got chased by a dog and having to jump a fence, barely escaping with our asses, makeshift boat competitions on a quiet lake. All of them had that kid-like reasoning on why it was the greatest idea ever. 

That’s why, when Terry mentioned White Wolf while we were at the park by my house one summer evening, I was surprised he’d never mentioned it before. We’d played every game I’d thought possible in our years of hanging out at the Kenties.

“You’ve never heard of it?”

“No, I don’t think so.”

“We play it all the time!! At my uncle’s camp, it’s like, all the cousins do.”

“Really?”

“Yeah! It’s better in the summertime, when it’s warmer at night.”

The game was to be played at dusk, or while the sun was setting. You didn’t need a lot of people, but the more there were, the better.  

“Basically, you pick a base.” Terry looked around before pointing to one of the old wooden picnic tables. “Like that. Something kind of big, or at least easy to like, see.”

Grace, one of his older sisters a few years older than us, chimed in.

“There’s a stump at Uncle Anthony’s camp. That’s what we use most times.” 

“Yeah, yeah! So, what you do is-”

“You choose someone who’s “it”. They’re the wh-” Carrie, another Kentie sister interrupted.

“Shut up! I’m telling it!”

“Jeez, okay.” 

“Whatever, yeah, they’re the White Wolf. Everyone else hides while they count.”

“We go to like-” Grace started.

“100!” shouted Lewis, the second youngest.

“Or 500 by fives.” 

“It’s the same thiiing.” 

“Stop it!!” Terry hollered. “ANYway, they count and everyone hides. When they’re done, the wolf seeks everyone else. If the wolf gets too close to someone’s hiding spot, the hider ye-”

The other Kentie kids all screamed at the same time, making me and Charlotte jump a little.

“WHITE WOLF!!”

“Guys!! Come ON!!” Terry covered his hands with his eyes. That made us all laugh.

According to Terry, a bit begrudgingly, once someone alerts the others of the wolf, everyone has to run and touch the base, before the wolf gets you. 

“So, if they tag you, are you the next wolf?”

“No. If the wolf gets you, you’re *dead*!” Lewis made a quick slicing motion across his neck to punctuate the severity of this. 

After a few minutes of arguing over how to choose the wolf, Grace picked some of the tall, grassy weeds by the fence. She counted out six, then ripped off the ends to make them even, all except for one. She shuffled them up in her hands and we all picked one. I got the shortest stalk, so I was the wolf. I turned and faced the parking lot of the park, making a show of covering my eyes so no one would accuse me of cheating. 

I counted to 100, and shouted

“Ready or not, here I come!”

I guess it was out of habit, and I felt kind of silly. But when I turned around and saw the silent park, I felt excitement bubble in my chest. Crickets were singing in the baseball field next to me, but even the breeze felt quieter. I took a step forward and looked for a shoe poking out of a slide, or movement by the trees. The gravel ground cover crunched noisily under my feet, but otherwise, I would have been silent. 

I stepped up onto the playground’s first platform, creeping over the tunnels that led to the monkey bars. No one in sight yet. I swung across them, dropping noiselessly onto the next part of the playground. 

Then I saw it. Lewis’s hand on the inside of the next slide. He was bracing himself inside of it, but at the angle I had landed, I could just barely make it out. The dying light wasn’t helping, but my eyes were getting used to it. 

I stood up, slowly. I moved over the short bridge leading to the slide’s entrance like a ninja. 

I peeked over the corner and Lewis’ eyes met mine. 

“WHITE WOLF!” He screamed, sliding down the rest of the slide as my hand swiped in the empty space where he had been seconds ago. 

The park erupted in sound. Carrie dropped from a tree. Terry sprinted out from a porta potty. Grace scooped up Lewis as she ran past him. Charlotte ran out of the dugout. All the movement came so fast I almost forgot what I was supposed to do.

I shot down the slide, in hot pursuit of Carrie, who had been the furthest from the base in her tree. She laughed and jogged easily out of range of my shorter legs. I watched her make it to the table with everyone else, along with time to spare. Flopping to the ground in defeat, I rolled onto my back as we all laughed and gasped for air.

After I had caught my breath, I realized something.

“Hey, I didn’t catch anyone. What happens now?”

Terry sat next to me. “Well, you have to hunt again. Let’s see if you have better luck this time.”

A noise sounded from the direction of my house, causing my sister and I to whip our heads around. It was Dad’s whistle. 

“Darn. Okay! *Next time*, we’ll play this more next time!” I shouted over my shoulder. 



Years passed. We moved away from Kentie after Mom was offered a better position at a bigger hospital a state over. Charlotte and I grew up, graduated, moved out. She went to medical school, like mom. That wasn’t my vibe. I graduated from Boise State University, went to grad school for a few long years, and eventually landed a job at one of the local high schools teaching American History. I met my wife, we got married, I lived.

I had all but forgotten about the Kenties, sans the few times I would recall a funny phrase Lewis said, or a night of secretive gaming with Terry. It wasn’t that I was dismissive of them, as I said, I was basically raised by them. 

However, I was still shocked one morning when I found an email in my inbox from Carrie. I was drinking coffee and burned the roof of my mouth at the familiar name that had popped onto my phone screen. The fright brought Anna to my side and she peered over my shoulder at the message.



*Dear Marcus,*

*I’m so sorry this is out of the blue. I’m sure you hardly remember me.*

*I found your email from your mom’s facebook. It sounds stalker-y, I know. This is a hail mary.* 

*Something is off with Terry. Hell, something’s been off with that son of a bitch for years now.* 

*He’s living off at Uncle Anthony’s old camp after a run in with the law and several bad decisions. I’ve gone up a couple times with Dad and Grace to try and talk some sense into him. Mom can barely cope with the whole thing, and nothing is getting anyone anywhere.* 

*I know it’s a stretch, you’re not a kid anymore, but if you see this, please respond. You’re still considered his closest friend, and if not that, his oldest. You might be the only person he’s willing to listen to right now.* 

*Carolyn Archer*



Anna was convinced it was some sort of scam, but the email had brought all those summers and years of my childhood flooding back, so I told her the whole story. After a lot of convincing, I wrote back to Carrie and we exchanged phone numbers. We called that afternoon and she told me everything. It was nice.

Terry had graduated from JHS with high honors and had landed a full ride at some college a few hours south. He had packed up and started what should have been a successful university experience. Then he met Sean Jameson. Sean visited home with Terry once or twice. 

“He was just, weird.” Carrie said. “All hippie and ‘fuck the system’, which would have been cool if he wasn’t cracked out of his mind. He talked about ‘The Return’ all the time. Had something to do with abandoning society, I think, going back to hunting and gathering.”

The longer Terry hung out with Sean, the less he was Terry-like. He changed. First he grew out his hair, then he started dressing “like a bum” according to Mr. and Mrs. Kentie. He stopped going to church, he stopped going to classes, the bags under his eyes grew deeper and deeper, his grades got worse and worse. He stopped coming home. He lost his scholarship. He was on academic probation, then he was expelled for ‘possession of illicit substances’. Terry was screwed.

“What happened to Sean?” Anna asked.

“Disappeared. Last I heard, Terry mentioned something about South America, or at least, I think he did. He was so fucking bleary and coked out, I couldn’t hear him.” Her voice broke.

Terry? A drug addict? My head was spinning. Flashes filled my mind of a gap toothed, brown haired kid who always had some cut or bruise on him that he’d make me look at, maybe touch. Terry? The kid who climbed the pine tree by the community building to save my sister’s kite? 

How could he have come to this?

Carrie and I finished talking, and hung up. I turned to Anna once the call had ended. She didn’t say anything, but we both knew we were thinking the same thing. I opened my laptop to buy a plane ticket to Wyoming, and she went upstairs to pack a bag for me.

36 hours later, I touched down in Sheridan. Everything was exactly as I remembered, and I felt the rental car turn down city streets with practically no help from me. It was as if my memories sitting in the passenger seat willed it to move. I pulled up in front of the Kentie house around ten. It looked more dim than it appeared in my memory. The crabapple tree by the side door was gone, the one I fell out of and broke my wrist. There were still paint stains on the bricks by the front door where Charlotte and Lewis had “decorated for Easter”. And most importantly, Mrs. Kentie was standing at the front door, waving like I had just pulled up on my bike. 

I was only there for a little bit, and per Carrie’s request, I didn’t explain my reason for being there. I could see weariness in Mr. Kentie’s attitude, and I was afraid of Mrs. Kentie’s reaction if I told her I was there to see her son. So, I lied. I told them that I was “just driving through on my way to Casper”. That didn’t stop them from holding me hostage for an extra hour and filling up my car with muffins and trail mix and what I think was a whole roasted chicken. I remember being shocked that the Kentie kids weren’t 300 pounds the way their mother fed them. It was probably all the running around that kept them in shape. 

When I finally got back on the road and plugged in the address Carrie had given me, I realized I’d be at the camp just before the sun was setting. Good, I wasn’t a fan of driving in the dark. 

The drive there was extremely pleasant. The hills and trees and small towns I passed took me right back to camping trips with my family. We didn’t have a camp, but that didn’t mean Dad didn’t try to get us out and about as much as he could. We’d camp in thick sleeping bags, curled under the stars like brightly colored grubs. We’d catch fish and cook them over the fire, hike, and swim. I loved it all. 

Was Terry alright? Maybe he was detoxing. That would make him irritable, right? Carrie had been cryptic in her explanation of his attitude when she tried to talk to him. The way she described it, I worried I’d come in contact with some nonverbal, hairy, bigfoot-type Terry. But if his bad example wasn’t around anymore and he was realizing the error of his ways, stubborn Terry was absolutely the kind of guy to distance himself completely and reflect. Maybe the mountain air and game was already finishing the job. Maybe when I took this corner up the road, I’d turn onto the driveway and see Terry reading National Geographic in a hammock. 

The car crunched up the lip of the road and pulled into the drive. The camp wasn’t humble. A two story log-cabin style structure surrounded by grass, with an open garage on the side. I could see canoes lining the walls and a kayak under a tarp, along with Terry’s Honda. It looked horrible, covered in mud and bird shit, the grass growing through the gaps in the tires. 

On the other side of the yard, I saw a woodshed, like a one story, condensed version of the house. There was sound coming from behind it, someone chopping wood. I turned the car off, stepping out and slamming the door.

“Terry?” I called, tentatively.

I immediately tensed. What if I was completely wrong? I was alone in the woods with a convict, who was probably on something. And I was breezing onto his property? While he had an axe? Genius.

I thought about jumping into my car and leaving, but before I could turn around, a head popped around the corner of the shed.

“Hey!”

A shirtless, bearded man with long hair pulled back walked out from behind the structure. The way he walked cemented my knowledge that it was still Terry, and I realized, though it had been years since I saw him, since I *spoke* with him, he was still my best friend. He walked across the space separating us until he was a few feet away from me.

“Ya lost, friend?”

He was still holding the ax. I cleared my throat.

“Hey, Terry. It’s me, Marcu-” his face changed in a split second.

“Jesus Christ!” I was suddenly yanked into a bone-crushing hug, the thud of the axe against the ground making my heart slow down a little bit. Terry smelled like sweat and woodsmoke. “Oh my god, you’re really here!”

He held me at arms length, presumably so he could get a solid look at me. His voice was deeper than I had expected. As he had gotten closer, I saw how strong he had gotten. Terry was a couple inches shorter than me as a kid, something I bullied him about relentlessly. Now, he was my height, and broader than I was. This time in the wilderness had changed him. I could feel his vice-like grip on my arms, firm and with an edge of control.

This was not the man I expected to find. I was ready to fight an emaciated concept of what used to be my best friend, or carry out his body, worst case scenario.Terry looked better than I ever thought I’d see him. A great big smile, the same laugh, just pitched down now, and a kind heart. 

“Come on in! You hungry? I caught some trout earlier that I was going to fry up, and I think we have some raspberries still. If not, we can head out tomorrow and get them ourselves.”

It was the best dinner I’d eaten in, well, ever. They say hunger was the best sauce, and, yeah, I was pretty hungry, but my company made it even better. Terry told me about the woods, his woods. He told me about a river that cut through the mountain, where he collected water for drinking and showering. He was almost done fitting the house for a well, but didn’t talk too much about it. He told me about the bobcat that had roamed through a month ago, and how he had a family of cardinals living in the eves of the woodshed.

Terry went to the fridge, grabbing two beers, and we sat out on the porch, watching the stars come out. From our seats, I could see the stump, the one I knew immediately the Kentie kids had used as their White Wolf base, years and years ago. 

My reason for being there came back to me then. I turned to look at Terry. A quintessential mountain man, sipping a beer, shirtless in the summer breeze. I almost wanted to stay quiet, hang out with him a few more days and then leave him to live up here. He seemed happy enough.

“Did Dad send you?”

It was a simple question, yet I felt my stomach drop like he was chastising me.

“No.”

“Mom?”

“Carrie.” 

He nodded, his jaw set. I watched him for a moment before continuing. 

“They’re just worried about you, you know? I don’t know a lot, and I’m sorry I wasn’t in touch for so long. Maybe if I had called you sooner, things would have been different.”“I don’t know if they would have.”“What do you mean?”

“Marcus, I know I did some stupid shit, and I know there’s a chance that Mom and Dad aren’t going to be happy even if I did come back. The choices I made have consequences. And I know that. But look around us! Look at me! I’m the happiest I’ve ever been in years. Yeah, Sean wasn’t the greatest compatriot, but he taught me what I needed to know. I’m a better man for it. Even if, even if you never moved away, I have a feeling I would have been led to this place some way or another.”

“This place?” Terry turned in his seat so he could look at me head on. “Mom and Dad thought Sean was some sort of nutso, feel-good, hippie freak. They weren’t wrong, but they weren’t exactly right either. Sean told me about all this, the trees, nature, the growing world around us. Do you really think humans are going to win in the end?”I realized after a second that the question wasn’t rhetorical.

“Uhh, well, no. When we’re gone, I doubt we’ll be able to leave a mark that we were ever here.”Terry slapped the arm of his chair, laughing. “Exactly! See? You get it! All this is temporary. Grass still grows through pavement, bumps in sidewalks shape from roots of trees, roads wash out in floods, it will all go back to Mother Nature.”

I remembered something Carrie had said. “It will all… return?”

“And so will we.” Terry looked at the sky again. “Sean knew that, and he knew he wasn’t going to wait around for it to happen. He cut out the middleman.”The conversation, I realized, had taken a darker turn than I wanted it to. “What- what did Sean do?”

Terry finished his drink and placed the empty bottle on the ground with a muted *ca-clink.* 

“What would you do if you knew you could control your death?”

I blinked. “What?”

“Sean found a way to control his end, even extend his time on this plane of existence. He told me how to do it too. I’ve separated from society, probably further than he had. I’m in better shape than he ever was, apart from when I was still at school. I cracked the code. The more open your mind is, the easier it is to return, but…” he held up his arm, slowly flexing the muscles. “...the more ready your mortal body is, the more control you’ll have once you’ve returned.”I couldn’t believe any of this. But I needed to assess the situation. Terry wasn’t on anything, and one bottle of Bud Lite was nowhere near enough to get someone talking like this. Maybe I could contact the police, or a suicide helpline, or something to get Terry out of the woods by himself. I was so wrapped up in my thoughts that I nearly missed Terry standing up.

When I looked up, he was by the stump in the back. I watched him run his hand along the side of it. 

“Marcus?”“Yeah, Terry?”“You don’t have to say yes. You can laugh and go to bed, or drive off, or whatever you want.”“What’s up, man?”He straightened up and turned to me.

“Will you play White Wolf with me again? Just, you know, one more time.”

We flipped a coin to see who was it. When Terry turned to count, I sprinted off towards the house, making a lot of noise on the gravel driveway before creeping back around the house to throw him off my scent. It was as if I was in middle school again, out late because our parents hadn't called us to come in yet, playing games that had higher stakes than needed. 

One thing I didn’t mention about White Wolf is the hiding strategy. You want a good hiding spot, but it also needs to be one you can evacuate from quickly if the wolf gets too close. My favorite places were trees with big branches, closed-topped slides, and fallen logs, places you could scope out the wolf. I wasn’t going into the woods, but that didn’t leave many good spots for a grown man. I snapped my head around, looking for spaces I could use. My eyes landed on the woodshed and its odd roof. 

The roof of the shed didn’t completely connect with the walls. I could hear Terry in the distance, somewhere in the fifties already. I didn’t have a lot of time left. 

The door was locked, its key on a hook in Terry’s kitchen. I knew he wouldn’t look inside. I chose to scale the wall, using the edge of the opposite walls as hand and footholds. Pulling myself onto the top of the wall, I eased my legs through the gap until I was balancing on my stomach, holding the sides of the roof and walls to brace myself. Blindly, I tried to find a foothold. There was what seemed to be a stack of uncut logs in one corner, or buckets, or something. Whatever they were, I had a place to put my left foot and still be able to see out the top. 

When we had started, I had worried that it was going to be too dark. Would he be able to see me? But now that my eyes had adjusted, I knew he’d be fine. The moon was pretty full, and the light from the house reached a little farther than I had expected. I was still facing the woods, but there was space to jump out and get away if Terry got close. 

I know. No one else was there to shout “White Wolf!” to. If I was caught, the game was over. I wasn’t doing this to please myself. I was doing it for my best friend. 

Terry had stopped counting. I held my breath, trying to listen for the gravel sounds. He would probably look in the garage, maybe even in the parked cars. 

Instead, I heard the soft swish of grass moving. Heavy steps getting closer. And, ragged breathing? If Terry was trying to freak me out, it was working. I sunk lower behind the wall, putting more weight on my left leg. I got low enough that I could just hardly see over the edge of the wall.

There he was. He came into view behind the shed, looking over his shoulder and around the yard and house behind him. He was holding his chest, like he’d just run a mile, and his muscles were twitching and jerking beneath his skin.

What happened next is nothing that I can explain. It all took place within a minute, and yet I felt like I sat in the shed watching for hours. Terry fell to his knees, wheezing and gasping. The way air was expelled from his lungs more than it was taken in made my chest ache. He coughed and sputtered over the moonlit grass, and I watched the flecks of spit turn into gobs of foam. The sounds coming from Terry’s throat were grating, and I was shocked the effort of coughing and breathing hadn’t torn anything. I opened my mouth, a “You alright?” ready on the tip of my tongue. 

Terry’s right shoulder shot down and back as his spine pushed up and forward, punctuated with a wet crack. He yelled, still coughing, as the other shoulder followed suit. The skin on his back bruised and stretched with the new bone placement. My jaw dropped, anything I could think to say gone completely from my mind. 

Terry’s arm had dropped from his chest, and he crouched down on the ground, still coughing. It was mixed with something else now. The coughs had inflections, rhythmic, yet random. His face flitted towards the house again and I caught the look in his eye. I had only seen it once before, when we had snuck into the yard of a house on my block. The house with a dog hiding under the porch that had leapt out, snapping at us, breaking off its leash. The look in Terry’s eyes right now matched the ones I saw when I stopped at the fence to boost him over: raw terror. 

He was still coughing, but it was labored, wheezy. He pushed himself weakly on to all fours, gasping. The rippling movement under his skin was back, and moving towards his neck. 

With no warning, Terry’s arms snapped forward with sick cracks. He screamed, watching the bones grind against themselves and contort his tendons, pulling his fingers back at odd angles. He was openly crying now, wet sobs punctuated by cries of pain. He looked like he was trying to stand up, holding most of his weight on his legs with the little strength he had left. 

My ears were ringing, all staticy. It felt like nothing around me was making any sound, and yet I could hear the hair on Terry’s body moving in the wind. I was both dead to the world and hyper-aware of everything taking place before me. I tried to yell, or cry, or do something to help my best friend, but my body wouldn’t do what my brain was screaming at it to do.

Crunch. Another bloodcurdling scream. Terry’s knee had shot backwards, popping out of socket and bringing the rest of the leg with it, skewing into a leg fastened the wrong way. He still had his jeans on, and in a frenzy of movement, he tore at them with hideous, destroyed arms and nails. I don’t know if his hip had dislocated as well, but his thigh seemed shorter. The bones he had were breaking and contorting, leaving the skin on Terry’s body to fold and bunch in unnatural ways. 

The other leg followed suit, and at the same time, Terry’s feet began to extend, stretching and popping as what once were his heels grew longer and longer. He never stopped crying. 

It was awful. At first it was condensed, like he was trying to man up and just “get through” his own body mauling itself. But as the seconds ticked by, the groans became screams, which became shrieks, which became pitiful begs. He called for his mom at one point, tugging at his hair and clumps of grass with shriveled, bruised hands. He cried for his dad, for his siblings, for God, for the devil. He bubbled out threats, then promises, then pleas, all while the remainder of his original body bastardized itself. 

I think we both vomited at the same time. I know I did, and when I looked back up at what once was my friend, he had his eyes fixed on me. I prayed he’d think I was a vision, or a trick of the light. 

“M-marcus…” 

His eyes were bloodshot, his nose was bleeding, and he was staring right at me. Gritting his broken teeth, he forced what was once his muscled arm up towards me. It was a thirteen year old Terry reaching to climb back over the fence.

And we both knew he couldn’t outrun the dog this time. 

His hand dropped to the ground, the visceral tears and grating of the rest of his body echoing in the silent space as he did. His other front limb, I couldn’t even call them arms anymore, followed it, grabbing the ground as he tried to claw towards me. His back extended, and I heard his backbone dislocate and split, each vertebrae like a gunshot. Where his pelvis was, a lump was forming, the skin bruising like his back had, and how his limbs were.

“Marc-cus, please…”

My mouth was bone dry. My hands gripped the wall so hard I could feel splinters needling their way into my hands. Bile dripped from my lips and stained my shirt. 

“....help...me…”

I wanted to stop it. I wanted to climb over this fucking wall and grab him and *fix* him. I wanted to go back to that night at the park and *not* play. I wanted to go to college with him. I wanted to kill Sean. I wanted to kill *Terry*. What would be the mercy? What would bring the end? 

“Terry…” my voice wasn’t my own. It was the one I used after breaking my wrist. I sounded like a scared boy again, desperate for everything around me to be some fucked up dream. 

“MaaaAARR-” his head tilted up and back. Too far. The vertebrae popped. His skull caved above his forehead. There was something wrong with the front of his throat. I thought it was his windpipe forcing its way up his larynx. The skin strained and split and I saw…

Black? Something black and shiny was forcing its way out of Terry. It glistened oily in the pale light, and more was appearing by the second. Terry’s face had collapsed, his eyes were dark, and yet by some horrible mystery, he was continuing to scream. The lines of red, hot tears were like scars on his deflated face, and the thing was getting bigger on his throat. It was...what the fuck was that? I saw a snout, and jaws, sharp, white canines, like a mockery of Terry’s broken teeth that I could still see through his slack, blood coated lips. There was a crust of yellow white on the nose of whatever was in him, a sick smell I registered even this far from him. Like a broken egg, or an embryonic sac. 

The flap of skin that was once my friend’s face finally dropped, flattened by the lack of mass within it. It flopped sickeningly against his shoulders, the long hair coming loose from its tie and sticking to his sweat-sheened skin. 

Terry’s final cry echoed around me. It was bouncing off the trees, free in the air, and swirling around in the shed with me. But the skin covered lie of an animal lay quiet on the ground, quivering like a newborn deer. 

I must have stared at it for an hour. Then it twitched, and I saw its head come up. It’s eyes met mine.

There was not a trace of the man I once knew in them. The eyes in that face were an animal’s, deep and dark. It got up, hind legs first. There wasn’t any wobble or uncertainty. Seeing the mangled human body move like that made my stomach turn again. The lump once at the base of his back had produced a sickly looking tail, and every inch of the thing’s body was covered in a fine layer of hair. 

The fuzz caused it to have a haze of light around it. I watched its glowing shape turn from me and trot away from me. The thing had made it to the edge of the woods.

Before it disappeared into the dark, it looked back at me, and just as it melted into the deep black of the trees, I heard myself speak.

“White Wolf.”

I said it in a whisper, my throat raw and high. 

I stayed in the shed for hours. I stayed until I had cried myself into eyes swollen and stomach completely empty. I stayed until the sun rose. Only when I could see that I was completely alone, I climbed out of the shed.

I have been driving since. I know I’ll need to stop and find somewhere to return this rental. Hell, maybe I’ll fucking buy it to get home. I just need to get a different plane ticket. Right now, it feels better to drive. I’ve stopped just outside of Denver, and I’m sitting in a gas station writing this. I don’t know what the point of it is, now that I have to consider the words I’ve written. I was writing this as, I don’t even know, a report to the police? What would they do? Would they even believe me? Do I send this to Carrie? Would *she* even believe me?

Maybe if someone finds this, someone more qualified, they can help me. I need to know more. If you know a man by the name of Sean Jameson, please contact me. If you know anything *about* him, please contact me. I need to know what happened to Terrence Kentie. Was it the game that destroyed him? Was it the company he kept? Was it something more than him, more than me, more than humanity itself? 

Whatever it was, keep yourself safe. I have seen what happened to those who were careless with their lives. 

I have seen the White Wolf.
