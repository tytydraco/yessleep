I (F35) was walking down the street with my son (M8) after we’d done our grocery shopping. It was night in our small-town neighborhood, with few cars around and houses lined up close to each other, forming rows along the entire street. We walked uphill until we reached a spot where only a single streetlight shone. It was a commercial area, but at that hour, all the shops were closed. My son was far ahead of me, playing with a toy car in his hand, while I continued at a slower pace under the weight of our grocery bags.

Then, I felt a cool breeze—odd for our town, known for its scorching, dry climate. But I welcomed it, as my face was drenched in sweat from carrying those bags. My son stopped and turned to wait for me, so we could walk together. But then I noticed his expression change; he looked curious, almost uneasy. He walked back towards me and said, “Mom, there’s been a woman walking toward us for a while. Do you think she lives near us?”

I felt no reason to worry—small towns are full of familiar faces, and it’s not unusual to bump into neighbors in random places. Instinctively, I thought it might even be a neighbor I’m close to, who often shops at that same market.

I turned to see who it was and found myself looking at an older woman I’d never seen before. She was dressed simply, her hair messily tied up in a bun, and she wore that unmistakable look of exhaustion only another mother would recognize. She noticed I’d seen her, and she waved, offering a shy smile.

As we got closer, she started a conversation with me. Her manner was warm, and soon we were chatting about all sorts of things. But there was something odd about the way she spoke.

When we were almost at the corner where I’d turn onto my street, I asked her if she lived nearby, and she replied, “Oh, honey… I used to live here, you know?”

I asked her if she’d moved away a long time ago since I’d never seen her before.

“I used to live on your street, but that was years ago. My children were wild back then—my oldest got into drugs and soon left home, and my daughter… she was violent, treated me with nothing but disdain. Then one day, my son came back. He was broke and tried to rob us. I was asleep, and my daughter got into a fight with him. They were both so full of anger… they agreed to burn down the house with me inside.”

I listened, feeling a bit skeptical. Could a ghost really be speaking to me? I kept a polite expression, pretending to believe her extraordinary story. We said our goodbyes with words like, “I’m so sorry,” and “Wow, what a tragic life.” My son heard everything, though I think at his age, he didn’t pay much attention to it.

When we got home, I put away the groceries and went to tell my older sister about the “crazy old woman” and her story. I expected my sister to laugh—she loved these wild tales—but instead, her face turned pale, and her lips lost all color. I had never seen her look so terrified. I insisted she tell me what was wrong, and here’s what she said:

“Sister, that woman… I don’t know if it’s a sick joke or someone pretending to be her, but about ten years ago—before your son was even born—a humble woman used to live in the house next to our neighbor’s, with her daughter. Everyone in the neighborhood knew about the constant fights there. The daughter treated her mother terribly, beating her regularly. The son was a drug addict who had disappeared but would show up now and then to steal or ask for money. But everyone knew those two shared an inexplicable hatred for their mother, who still loved them deeply. I don’t know much, but I do know that one day the house caught fire, and she was trapped inside. Our neighbor told me that for a few minutes, you could hear the woman agonizing, crying as her body burned. Sometime later, they renovated the place and built a new house.”

I listened, unsure of how to process what she’d told me. To this day, I prefer to believe that the woman I met was just some stranger who knew the story and was spreading it around. But every time I pass by that house, I swear I can still hear her screams, her pain at being betrayed by her own children.
