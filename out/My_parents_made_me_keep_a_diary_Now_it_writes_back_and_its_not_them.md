I grew up in a house where pets never lasted long.



Doesn’t matter what we brought home. Goldfish. Birds. A kitten once.

They either disappeared or... or just died.

Always in weird ways.



Like, there was this parrot we had—one morning, he was chirping like crazy. Happy, loud. That night?

Dead.

Lying stiff at the bottom of his cage.

One wing bent in the wrong direction, neck twisted like someone snapped it and forgot to finish the job.

There were these little drops of green stuff around him.

His eyes were wide open, staring up at the ceiling. Like he'd seen something. Something bad.



And the goldfish...

That night, I swear to god, they all floated up at once.

Bodies stiff, mouths half-open, stuck like they were still trying to scream underwater.

If you watched long enough, it almost felt like they were whispering something.

I didn't understand. I didn’t want to.



My parents acted like it was normal.



Until one day they put cameras all over the house.



They didn’t tell me why. They just said it was for "security."

But the next morning, I caught them whispering in the kitchen.



"Did you see it last night?" Mom asked, real low.



Dad didn’t answer right away. Then he muttered,



"It's reacting faster than we thought."



Reacting to what?



I remember standing there, watching them. They smiled when they saw me. Like nothing was wrong.



"Morning, sweetie! Breakfast’s almost ready. Did you pack your school bag?"



They always smiled too wide.



A few days later they took me to meet this "uncle."

I don't remember his name. I barely remember the drive there.



I just know that halfway through talking to him, I started feeling tired. Like, heavy, like my bones didn’t want to stay up.

And then everything went black.



When I woke up, I was back home.



Mom and Dad standing over me. Smiling.



"From now on," they said, "you should write a diary every night. Write down everything you do. Everything you think. Be a good boy."



So I did.



Because I was a good boy.



At first, the diary was normal.

Me writing about school. Homework. Dumb stuff.



But then...

Stuff started appearing in the diary that I didn’t write.



In red ink.



Things like:



"You weren't polite to your teacher today."

"Don’t sneak snacks after dinner."



Sometimes there were drawings.

Little crude sketches of my room.

Of me.



I thought maybe... maybe Santa Claus was watching. Or some guardian spirit.

I tried not to freak out.



But it kept getting worse.



The diary started telling me about things that hadn't happened yet.



"There will be a fire drill tomorrow. Don’t panic."



Guess what?

There was a fire drill.



Then it started telling me what to think.

Who to trust.

Who not to question.



"Don't worry about where Dad went last night. He's doing it for you."



"Trust the process."



Process?



By the time I was a teenager, I knew something was wrong.

Very wrong.



One night, when my parents were out, I snuck into their room.



Found their laptop.

Found a folder on the desktop.

"Experiment No. 012"



Inside?



Hundreds of photos of me. Charts. Brain scans. Notes. All about me.



There was one file I can't get out of my head:



"Subject 012: Neural restructuring at 60%."

"Dream function terminated successfully."

"Antisocial personality framework initializing."



What the fuck was happening to me?



I ran to the bathroom.

Looked in the mirror.



For a second,

I swear to god,

I didn’t recognize myself.



My reflection smiled before I did.



I grabbed a razor, sliced my finger—



Green.

The blood was fucking green.



And then behind me—



Dad’s voice. Calm. Too calm.



"You're almost one of us."



I don’t know how much time I have left.



I still write in the diary every night.

But now?



The replies come before I even finish writing.



Sometimes they tell me things I don't want to know.



Sometimes...

they tell me things I’m about to do.



And lately—



the handwriting?



It’s starting to look like mine.
