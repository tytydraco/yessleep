A part of me was keeping the hope alive that the direct confrontation with the entity in my bedroom was going to be the end of it.

It certainly felt climactic to me, and I had been carrying an emotion that felt like a hybrid between victory and resolution ever since. Those few hours of naivety ended abruptly and more jarringly than I could have anticipated. I can’t fall asleep now that I’ve witnessed its true physical form, and I believe it's still in the corner as I’m typing this. I feel like there’s a barrel of a gun pressed against the back of my head, but I’ve learned to live with it at this point. As always, let’s hope I can finish writing this without spiraling into a panic attack, or a far worse outcome coming to fruition.

After a long day of studying in the library and facing a couple of final exams I had been dreading (my anxiety over test-taking had vanished in light of recent events; most everything around me had begun to seem childish compared to dealing with chronic existential crisis), I was looking forward to relaxing in my dorm room, maybe even turning in for the night ridiculously early once again.

 I was feeling confident enough that I was free of the entity that my guard was completely down. Between the fact that I had succeeded in mentally willing it away at home and had now put some distance between myself and the only location I had ever encountered it, I convinced my brain that I would be able live life normally once again.

No more debilitating paranoia, no more envisioning monsters out of shadows. Just some studying and calming peace. If only that had been the case.

When I arrived at my dorm room, I was relieved to see that my roommate Zachary was sitting at his desk, watching a football game on his laptop while he ate a microwaveable dinner as he so often did during weekday evenings. Zachary was a toss-up on what you’d find him doing during any given day. Generally, he was a pretty studious guy. I shared a couple of classes with him, and he was one of the most diligent when it came to homework, always on top of taking elaborate notes and completing homework before it was due. That being said, he was by no means a nerd and was in fact quite a decent athlete when it came to track and field. He was often accompanied by a girlfriend who would hang out in the dorm with him for extended periods of time and was popular among the friend group he had on our floor of the dorm building. Honestly, I could probably take some notes from him when it came to succeeding in social interactions, but that’s a weird conversation to bring up and I don’t want to observe him to a creepy extent either.

All that being said, I never knew if Zachary was going to be out most of the night, either with his girlfriend or his teammates from sports, or chilling in our room. Under normal circumstances I was happy to have the room to myself, the undying introvert that I am, but now I was very glad to see that I would have a companion during the nighttime hours. It felt like yet another layer of protection against the entity, as I had only ever encountered it while completely isolated or alone. Spending the night in the same room as someone else, even if they had no idea what I've been going through, was infinitely more comforting than suffering through this alone.

I’ve discussed the nature of fear a lot throughout my accounts of this week, as I’ve been wrestling with it in ways that are both new and familiar. Something that struck a strange chord of nostalgia within me was contemplating why it felt so much safer just to be in the presence of a fellow human being. Realistically speaking, Zachary wouldn’t be able to help me fight against some unknown cosmic or spiritual being, but even the thought of encountering it again while he was simply in the same room as me felt far better than facing it alone.

Why was that? If I wasn’t really being offered any kind of true protection, why did facing mortal danger with someone else have the illusion of being favorable?

The only thing I can figure, is that we aren’t meant to be alone. For all of my social anxieties and inward introversion, I can admit that I do get lonely when I take a step back from all of my hobbies and take some time to breathe. Humanity is a very social species in general, there’s no doubt about that in my mind. Just because I don’t find very many people worth hanging out with doesn’t change that fact. I have my sister and a couple of best friends that I’ll hang out with any time of the day, but otherwise, I'm more likely to be surrounding myself with the fictional characters and worlds I’m obsessed with. The point is, as a committed introvert, I’ll say this: perhaps we feel irrationally safer in the presence of others simply because we aren’t intended to go through life alone.

Apologies for yet another side rambling of introspective and philosophical thoughts that bounce around my head, that’s just what happens when I sit down to write, especially when it comes to considering how much time I even have left on this earth. I haven’t written off the possibility that this will be my last story. Even if I am now unsure about the entity’s desire to kill me, given that it proclaimed a declaration of love to me the other night, I am still fearful of the very real possibility that it is serving as some sort of harbinger to my death.

It makes me wonder, how many other people have encountered such a being? I don’t recall hearing any urban legends or mythos about it, unless people have just been attributing it to some other already named monster or deity from ancient mythology or religion. Did it appear to people soon before their death? Did it ferry people into the afterlife? Was it trying to perpetrate my demise, or prevent it? Nothing quite made sense in my brain, and the telepathic statements it had given me jumbled around my mind to ultimately form nonsensical patterns.

I didn’t dare allow it to communicate or interact with me if I could help it. There was too strong of an otherworldly fear and paranoia that exuded from its presence when in my proximity that I couldn’t reasonably think it harbored genuine goodwill towards me. Perhaps the only reason I’m still alive is because I resisted it so fiercely.

Upon entering the dorm, my roommate was his cordial self.

“What’s up?” He said his typical greeting, giving me a nod as I closed the door behind me. He had shortly cropped blonde hair and an athletic build and was very average in height, just barely shorter than me.

“Hey, man,” I replied, wondering if he noticed how tired my eyes looked, how drained my face appeared.

It felt like I had been to hell and back since I last saw him.

If he did notice my deteriorating physical appearance, he didn’t mention it, instead going back to happily eating his dinner and watching whatever football team was playing. I’ve never been a sports guy myself, but having been around Zachary’s friends on a few occasions, I’ve gotten to sit in on many debates centered around who was the best player in any given position. I briefly wondered if they’d entertain incoherent ramblings about a being from another plane of existence that stalks people and occasionally telepathically communicates disturbing philosophical questions concerning life and death.

The rest of the day was spent studying; not the activity I’d like to eat up my potentially shortening time on earth, but acting as though death were no where near my doorstep was soothing to my conscience.

“So, only a couple more days to talk to her,” Zachary said, closing his laptop and stretching his arms. “No guarantee she’ll be in any of your classes next semester.”

For a moment I had to scramble to understand what Zachary was talking about.

“Oh, yeah, I guess,” I said, after an awkward pause ensued while I gathered my thoughts. “But, I mean, she’ll still be around campus.”

Hazel was a gorgeous junior-year student in our literature elective, her intelligence matching her beauty equally. I had openly expressed my attraction to her around Zachary for the past couple of months, but I was of course far too awkward to start a conversation with her out of nowhere. I wasn’t entirely sure she was even single, as most pretty girls around campus were reliably taken.

“I think you're using excuses to procrastinate,” Zachary teased me, standing up and heading towards the door. “Trust me bro, it’s not that hard. You gotta talk to her sometime if anything’s ever gonna happen. Just treat her like a friend that’s not a… friend. I don’t know how to say it, really, but you gotta talk to her!”

Inspiring words, Zachary.

When he disappeared into the hallway, probably heading to the bathroom, I was left in silence to contemplate. I hadn’t thought much about Hazel since the entity came into my life, I hadn’t thought much about anything else *but* the entity. Perhaps my brain needed a distraction to further eliminate the being from my headspace, and mustering up the courage to actually speak to a girl for once (I’ve been a shy nerd since middle school) might be the perfect counter to the experiences I’ve had lately.

A newfound confidence was blooming in my chest as I stood from my chair, turning away from the desk as I planned to shed my day-clothes for a comfier outfit while my roommate was away. Tomorrow was the literary final, and the last time I would *definitely* be in the same room as Hazel; it was guaranteed that I wouldn’t see her again for at least a month during winter break, and a non-zero possibility that she would disappear entirely if we didn’t share any classes next semester. If there was ever time to ask her out, it was now. The stakes were very low in the case that she rejected me as there was no risk of awkwardness given that we would be immediately distanced afterward.

After I traded my jeans and grey button-up shirt for loose shorts and an old sweater, I jumped onto my bed, tiredness nearly overtaking me, the thoughts swirling around my head the only thing keeping me awake once my head hit the pillow.

I had never succeeded in garnering a girl’s interest *ever*. I would be lying if I said part of my unmitigated terror when it came to dying was due to the fact that I desperately want to experience romance before I meet my end. If that being really was a warning or harbinger of my imminent demise, then that was just another reason why I *needed* to talk to Hazel tomorrow. Maybe I could manage to live a little more of life before my untimely death.

When Zachary returned and saw me already in bed, he went ahead and turned the light off, jumping onto his springy mattress soon after. He was never the type to stay up too late and he was probably glad that I was turning in before midnight for once.

Heaviness in my eyelids was just about to compel them to close for the night, when I made the mistake of glancing my eyes around the now dark room, hoping to comfort myself once and for all by seeing that there was no longer an entity watching me.

Instead, I got the clearest view of it yet.

It hadn’t been there mere moments before, but now, as my eyes adjusted to the dark, I could see the imposing figure standing at the foot of my bed, practically pressing itself against the end of my mattress. It was significantly tall, somewhere between eight and nine feet, and its frame was broad and bulky. While humanoid in shape, possessing the typical body parts of a head, chest/torso, and arms/legs, each of them perfectly proportional in size to one another, it was completely devoid of any personal features. Its face was completely blank, and despite having the shaping of a nose, mouth, and divots for eye sockets, they were all unified in that there was nothing else to them besides frighteningly pale and unsettlingly smooth skin. No detectable expression was on its face and there wasn’t a blemish to be found anywhere on its body. Its posture was pristine and looking directly at it made me feel like the word itself was wobbling.

I was frozen in place for a few moments that seemed like they dragged on forever, studying my surreal stalker’s features partly in terror and partly in awe. I didn’t know what I was expecting, but I certainly didn’t imagine it to be simultaneously *so* human and *so* unhuman.

“Zach,” I managed to squeeze from my throat, exuding far too much effort just to keep my voice from stuttering as my vision went blurry. “Do you see… that…”

I needed to feel the comfort of someone else being with me in the room, I needed to prevent panic overwhelming me as it always did.

“Hm?” I heard Zach shifting in his bed, but I couldn’t take my eyes off of the being before me. “See what?”  
“Is there something…” I swallowed hard, fighting to keep my voice steady. “Is there something over by the foot of my bed?”

I head some more shifting over on his side of the room, then a semi-grumpy, semi-playful: “Go to sleep, dude.”

He couldn’t see it. On some level, I had been inwardly expecting that to be the case, but in all reality, I was desperately hoping Zachary would be able to see this entity. I needed to share this torment with someone, but I had just confirmed getting anyone to truly understand what I was going through was impossible. The burden of knowing this being would stop at nothing to haunt me felt heavier than ever before in that moment.

Whatever this thing was, it was *my* demon and no one else’s.

*“Time grows short,”* its familiar, ghastly voice slid into my mind as my own thoughts. *“No one has forever, but some have longer than others. Is that fair? How can one measure the importance of different lives?”*

It didn’t move as it communicated with me, just continued to stand in rigid and stoic stillness. I did everything in my power to reject the rising dread within me, to fight back against the aura of despair that clung to this unwelcome entity.

*“All life is immeasurably valuable, all souls infinitely more so. Listen to my words, William. The universe does not care, but you do. Therefore, it is so.”*

Pushing back the warning signals everything in body was sending out, I dared to move, sitting up and swinging my legs over the edge of my bed. Every time I began writing about my encounters with it, it had left me alone until eventually disappearing. Using Zachary’s sleeping figure as a pillar of courage, I slid onto the floor, shakily keeping myself upright as I turned to face the desk, painfully aware that I was putting the entity behind me.

*“You need to stop running, William.”*

I opened my laptop, my arms weaker than ever, quivering as my stomach felt like it was intensely carsick.

*“Listen. There is only one life you can fairly condemn. You cannot decide the worth of life.”*

The screen flashed on, casting a faint glow into the room, my eyes just barely hurting against the artificial light. I frantically grabbed the mouse, smashed my login password into the keys, having convinced myself that somehow writing this all down as it happened would spare me.

*“But we can. We can see.”*

I couldn’t take it anymore. I slowly spun around in my chair, making eye to empty socket contact with my stalker from another realm.

“I don’t want to die,” was all I could manage. I intended it to be an authoritative and dismissive command, but instead, it came out as a soft, pathetic and pleading whimper.

The being said and did nothing for a moment as a solitary tear fell down my face, waves of sorrow crashing over me as I realized I may be staring down the embodiment of my own end.

*“I am here,”* the phrase practically phased in and out of my mind, as the entity took a step back and disappeared into the shadows casted over the corner of the room.

Seeing it move, seeing it so fluidly take one elongated step to cover the distance and so perfectly melt into the shadows was perhaps one of the most reality-bending parts of my entire experience with this thing. All these thoughts and feelings tumbled through my mind so fast its hard to replicate the exact sensation, but it was as though I lost faith in everything I thought I believed about reality, than thought that everything I knew about reality was actually just as absurd as the being before me, then that nothing at all could possibly be real, and yet, I am here to experience it meaning that if nothing else *I* must be real which felt like an *impossibility*.

I need to stop that rant there, as I truly believe I could go on forever writing about the mere fraction of an instant and all of the new yet oddly familiar feelings that washed over me, each sentence and concept gradually growing less and less coherent as I went on.

“You say something, dude?”

Zachary’s voice brought me hurtling back down to reality, so abruptly that it almost hurt, somehow. It was deeply unnerving to hear how utterly normal and relaxed he seemed compared to me. I could hardly remember what an ordinary person felt like in their day-to-day life. I used to think carrying the weight of being an adult and losing the magic of childhood had a special kind of misery but compared to… *death itself* dragging against me every day, I knew I had been enviously lighthearted less than a week ago.

“No, no, I just- I forgot some homework, gotta finish it up,” I lied, giving what was undoubtedly an unconvincing smile.

Zachary must have been tired, because he said nothing else, just rolled to face away from me and readjusted himself in his covers.

I began to document this encounter immediately after, once I had enough of my bearings to articulate my thoughts. I’ve been able to detect its presence this entire time. I know its watching me from that corner, just beyond the reaches of my visual capabilities. I wouldn’t necessarily say the otherworldly sense of dread and fear has left me, but more so that I’m able to cope with it now. Every now and again I swear I’ll feel its hands brush against my shoulders, but at this point I don’t know if I’m just imagining it or not.

I don’t know if I’ll be getting any sleep tonight, or if I’m just going to continue hypnotically staring at my computer screen until the sun rises, taking at least a smidgen of solace in interacting with something that was very manmade and very controllable by me.

I’ve decided, now. Nothing can possibly be worse than this, so what do I have to lose?

Tomorrow, I’m going to ask out Hazel.
