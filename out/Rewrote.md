I wasn’t always obsessed with calligraphy.

At first, it was just a job—an opportunity to pay off my student loans.

I worked as a copywriter at a small advertising agency when I stumbled upon an old man at a café. He sat alone, scribbling in a notebook with meticulous strokes. His movements were hypnotic. His frail hands gripped the brush steadily, as if each word held hidden weight.

I didn’t recognize him, but something about his writing drew me in. Something ancient, dignified, almost… sacred.

When he noticed me watching, he smiled faintly. In a voice far too ancient for his face, he said, “The act of writing is not just putting words to paper. It is the creation of the self. You should learn true calligraphy—not just to express yourself, but to align with the world.”

I felt a shiver go down my spine. His words evoked an unfathomable desire in me. He handed me the notebook, its back pages blank. “Come back tomorrow, and I’ll teach you.”

The next day, I returned, eager to begin. The old man gave me a brush and a few sheets of rice paper. He instructed me to write Li—propriety, respect, harmony—in the most perfect calligraphy I could.

I worked slowly, carefully, concentrating on each stroke. When I finished, the old man looked at the page. His eyes clouded with disdain. "You're trying too hard," he remarked. "You are not listening to the words. Your brush does not obey the principles. It fights you.”

Embarrassed, I knew he was right. The characters were wrong—too forced, too stiff.

He told me to try again, but this time, to let go. “Write with your soul. Let the ink flow from your heart, not your mind.”

At first, I couldn't comprehend. However, allowing my hand to move freely resulted in a different outcome. The strokes became smoother, more fluid, more alive. The characters seemed to breathe on the paper.

The old guy nodded approvingly, his attention remaining on the page for a bit longer than expected. "Yes," he murmured quietly, "now you're starting to understand."

I returned every afternoon after that. At first, it felt like just a creative outlet—something to escape my 9-to-5 routine. But slowly, I began changing in subtle ways. My life became more structured, aligned with the world. The principles of Li—respect, harmony, propriety—started to govern my actions. My relationships improved. My work performance soared. I felt an inner peace I hadn’t known in years.

But something was off. The old man never seemed to age. Each day, he looked exactly the same—his hair perfectly white, his wrinkles deep but unchanging, his hands steady as ever.

Then, one evening, he handed me a new sheet of rice paper. “Tonight,” he said, “You will write the final lesson. It is the most difficult of all.”

I looked at the paper. The characters were unfamiliar—nothing like I had written before. They weren’t Chinese, nor Japanese. They were… otherworldly. The letters were twisted, darkened, jagged. Unsettling.

“What are these?” I asked, my heart racing.

“They are the truth,” the old man said calmly. “Write them down, and you will be in complete alignment with the world.”

As I began to write the first character, something inside me snapped. The brush felt heavier, like it was pulling against me. The ink seemed darker, almost seeping into my skin.

Then it happened.

I could feel the characters… moving. Inside me. The ink twisted in my veins, pooling in my chest. The strokes on the paper weren’t just symbols—they were ideas, philosophies, emotions… They felt like they were being etched into my soul. The more I wrote, the more I lost myself in the flow.

I kept writing, the characters dancing on the paper faster than I could keep up. My hand burned with each stroke. The words pulled me, guided me, shaped my thoughts. And then, I realized—it wasn’t just the calligraphy anymore.

The characters weren’t teaching me harmony; they were consuming it.

By the time I finished the last stroke, I couldn’t breathe. My vision blurred. The room faded. All I saw were the characters, swirling in the air, like ink in water, filling every inch of space. The old man was gone. In his place stood only the reflection of myself—but not really me. The reflection was warped, broken, hollow.

I turned to the mirror hanging on the wall. There, staring back at me, was the face of a man I didn’t recognize—the man who had become my reflection, yet forgotten his place in the world.

I couldn’t escape the feeling that the calligraphy had rewritten me. My mind had become consumed by these dark, ancient words. With each passing day, I felt myself slipping further from who I once was. My work, my relationships, even my reflection—everything felt wrong. The ink’s weight pressed against my consciousness, pulling me deeper into darkness and confusion.

Now, I hear it. The whispering, growing louder with each moment: “You have written the truth.”

So, I write this down, hoping to forget. If you see an old man at a café—an ancient, serene figure, teaching you calligraphy—do not listen. Do not follow his lessons, no matter how pure they seem.

The price of aligning yourself with the truth of the world is not peace, but forgetting everything that makes you human.

And once you’ve written that final stroke, you’ll never escape.
