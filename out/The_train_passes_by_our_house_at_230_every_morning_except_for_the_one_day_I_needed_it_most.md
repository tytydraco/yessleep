 

It’s been nearly 20 years since it all happened. I haven’t talked about it to anyone nor have I bothered reaching out for help. But as of a couple of days ago, after traveling back to my hometown, I saw sitting on top of the coffee table a newspaper article dated from around the time of the incident. Flipping the page seemed to have pulled something from the void of my memories just so everything would pop back into my existence. The eerie voices in my head and the ridiculously vivid dreams I get at night were simply too much to handle so in response, I have decided it would be best for me to finally open up about this in a Reddit post before seeking therapy. For protection, all the names are made up as well as this being a fake account. Enjoy…

I was a teenage boy at the time, sixteen or so, as was my group of two friends (Jerry and Tommy) who accompanied me. On the young summer nights, we’d often get ourselves into trouble by stealing beer or cigarettes from the poor gas station down the block. It eventually became a regular game of hide and seek with the cops who tried to capture our elusive selves. Needless to say, we were reckless, dumb, stupid teenagers. 

But, like all things, stealing beer and cigarettes got old after a month. The next week we sat around doing just about nothing while drinking until our stomachs couldn’t handle any more. It wasn’t until Jerry came to us with something new and exciting to stimulate our pre-pubescent minds. I can still envision the reflected campfire in his eyes as he explained it to us. The words of the devil, hidden by the tongue of my friend. Jerry wanted to go train surfing. My other buddy, Tommy was quick to agree, drunkenly jumping up and down in excitement. It didn’t matter what I said, it was two to one, so I was forced to agree as well.

For the next week, I plotted our adventure, analyzing the train patterns, the traffic, and the police car activity. It was quite amazing, thinking back, that I was capable of doing such work at the time. Of course, I was the one doing all the heavy lifting, and well, that’s how it’s always been. You could say I was the babysitter, the one who kept us all out of danger by having some amount of forethought. I guess I felt slightly responsible for them like they were a family to me.

Anyways, one day we as the group stayed up all night drinking and smoking around the fire when I heard something that piqued my attention. The sound of a train whistle from the tracks in the distance echoed through the neighborhood. Things clicked in my head as the next four days passed with the train whistling by at exactly 2:30 AM. Every single night it passed. On Thursday I briefed the group and we planned to surf tomorrow’s train. 

Friday night rolled around quickly. Before setting out, we stocked up on beers for the journey, filling each of our pockets with a bottle, and a pack of cigarettes. We sat quietly by the fire, my thoughts drifting aimlessly under the starlit sky. Suddenly, as each one of us was beginning to nod off, my wristwatch beeped an alarm signaling the start of our trek. We all jumped to our feet and extinguished the fire. Oh, how dark the street was, lit by the waning moon. Together we walked, side by side down the street for fifteen minutes until we reached the forest before the tracks. A heavy silence fell over us as we walked, each lost in our own anxious thoughts. Tommy cleared his throat, glanced at Jerry and me, but said nothing, the words seemingly stuck in his throat. In front of the loose forest stood a large oak tree we stopped in front of. Standing in between Jerry and Tommy, I glanced between them who both were staring up at the swaying leaves. I checked the time on my watch, 2:25 AM.

“Ok,” I whispered weakly before stepping into the woods. Entering the darkness all I could do was listen. Leaves crackled sharply under our feet, echoing in the still night. I couldn't shake the feeling of unseen eyes watching us from the shadows. Looking around I noticed my friends looking at their feet with lifeless expressions. Their faces were so dark, so pale and white as if I were walking them through the gates of a cemetery into their graves. The trees past them were silhouetted by the moonlight outside of the forest, morphing them into thick black pikes from the ground. I eventually took notice of the pounding of my heart at the feeling of the presence of another being. As our footsteps synced up to a perfect military march, panic set into me. I scanned the dark forest, every rustle and shadow sending jolts of paranoia through me. Then I jolted, flipping my body around to face behind where I saw a shadowed figure fly from the tree tops, swooping over us. I screamed a bit feeling the jitters course through me as my breath vibrated intensely. A hoo sound followed as the figure flew towards the nearby tracks. 

“It’s just an owl,” Tommy said, scoffing at my exaggerated reaction. An awkward chuckle escaped me as my hands trembled and adrenaline still coursing through me. Finally, we arrived at the tracks which sat in a long cut-out strip from the forest surrounding it on each side like a tunnel in a mountain. I checked my watch, 2:28 AM. I looked North and South from end to end of the track for any lights but to no avail. The only source present was the lone moon high in the sky. 

My friends followed North along the tracks where I reluctantly followed. As 2:29 flashed on my watch, a tremor of anticipation ran through me, my heartbeat quickening. Rechecking my watch in disbelief, I gazed as the screen ticked to 2:30. No train. I glanced up at my surroundings, my heart pounding through me. It was like my body was desperately pleading, begging my brain to come to its senses that something wasn’t right. 

And then I froze, staring past Tommy and Jerry in front of me to the tree line to catch it. Its movement sprawled from the ground like it were on springs as the dead leaves flew around in chaos from the commotion. A part of me broke inside, disconnected into two parts where in one I watched a slow-motion horror scene as the shadowed man chased after us, and in the other, I ran. 

Straight into the forest from where we came from, matching our path nearly exactly I ran so very hard. I didn’t have any feeling in my body except the warm image of myself safe, far in the distance at the firepit we started at. The man yelled at the top of my lungs only a few feet behind us, as the blood-curdling, inhumane sound echoed through the forest and resonated with my legs shaking them uneasy. 

“I just want to talk,” he screamed in this jokerish psychotic voice before proceeding to laugh in an even more haunting tone. I could hear my friend’s strides behind me along with their heavy, labored breathing, as I grew further and further from them until one just stopped. 

“Come here!” Was followed after I heard a tumbling sound. It was the devil himself shouting. His voice rattled me again, sending uneasy shivers, shooting down my spine. Then I heard another tumbling sound as my other friend presumably tripped. And it was silent, besides the deep breathing and crunching of leaves from my steps, it was dead quiet.

Eventually, I arrived back at the street we once walked down courageously. I ran, ran through the neighborhood until I entered the backyard we started at. Expecting a warm fire, but all I got was the extinguished remains and ash. I stared deeply into the pit, listening to the cold screams of my friends reverberating through the block. I never looked back. I couldn’t will myself to see the destruction I had caused. For me, it was easier to blind myself to the black void of an extinguished fire pit than to see the pain I had unfolded for others.

I purposely never read the papers or turned on the news to maintain my suppressed imagination of everything. I never looked back for twenty years until earlier this morning after a train whistle caused me to wake in my sleep. In a puddle of sweat, I checked the time, 2:30 AM. Later in the day, I found and flipped open the newspaper sitting a top of a coffee table at my parent’s place. The crime scene pictures flooded my traumatic memory. I visualized Jerry’s death like in the photo, replaying the moments like a movie only this time with the addition of a picture and not just my audio. I’ll spare you the details but the man skinned while he was still alive. Meticulously whittling away at every layer of skin from his bottom up to his face. His joints, were broken, shattered, and repositioned so his whole body was shaped into some elaborate bow. The next picture was Tommy covered in a blanket. You could tell that his head was missing from under the blanket. My imaginations of Tommy’s death often horrify me more than Jerry’s. I can only see that man skinning Tommy alive before severing his head off with the little knife he carried. To say the least, it’s traumatizing, and here’s what’s worse:

They never got the guy.
