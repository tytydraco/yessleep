Hello everyone. Before I begin, I wanted to thank those for the concern they’ve shown. I’m safe, but I can’t lie. The events of the past few days have been taking a toll on me. Hopefully, I will be able to address the questions I’ve received. Along with updating you all on the events that have transpired.

To begin, I am still at the cabin. I honestly have no options to leave. My car is gone. Just, gone. I have no logical explanation for it. I tried reasoning that the rangers could have towed it. But, what national park has a tow truck on site? The only other logical option is that somehow the rangers were able to move my car. I have also had no access to my cell phone. I had left my charger at home, and felt that asking the rangers for one is probably not the best idea. Thankfully, I had brought my work laptop and its carrying bag. Thankfully I had the foresight to pack a charger within the bag. 

The day after the storm, my car had vanished. Declan had no answers for me, after I had tried to interrogate him. The stout man had led me towards the Park Office. The Oregon ground was still muddy from the storm. Declan held open the door to the Park Office for me. Inside, the building was fairly calm. Rangers sat around, doing menial labor. One was playing that game on Google when there’s no internet connection. Wordlessly, Declan walked past them towards a door. He wrung his hands nervously, and tuned the handle. Inside Mary was asleep on a cot. A man sat at a desk. He looked up, as we entered the room. The man smiled widely. I had met him the night before. Joseph was the ranger in charge of medical care in the park. 

“Mary has been sleeping for a while.” Joseph said warmly. “I don’t blame her, she had quite the fall.” He continued, adjusting the cap positioned on top of his red hair. 

“She didn’t fall.” I replied, and quickly corrected my statement. “Well she did fall, but something was holding her.” Declan averted his gaze, biting his lip. Joseph’s smile faltered. The grin returned.

“Nonsense, you most likely watched her take a tumble from one of the near ledges.” The reply from Joseph sent a chill down my spine. “Is there anything I can help you two with?” Declan cleared his throat.

“We just wanted to check in on Mary. Make sure she’s ok.” Declan shifted, he rubbed his arm and looked away. Joseph’s smile was still painted across his face. 

“She’s ok, she should be good to go by the end of the day.” Mary began to stir, and Joseph began to escort Declan and myself out. As he did, I noticed a picture framed on his wall. It was a pencil drawing. The subject was similarly drawn, to the way you’d display an insect when pinning it to a board. The drawing was of a top down view. It was insectoid in form, and it had two sets of wings. It had a large abdomen, and seemingly a thin waist with a narrow head. The hind wings were drawn to be folded into the body in a resting position. However, the front wings were drawn to be horizontal of the insect's body. As I left the room, my brain was trying to figure out what insect the drawing was depicting. I walked silently next to Declan as I pondered. Suddenly, it clicked. The drawing was of a wasp. 

I needed fresh air, and in a lapse of judgment I decided to go on a hike. Maybe it was cabin fever, maybe it was the stress of the past 24 hours. I couldn’t tell you what. The closest trail to my location was the Canyon Trail. The winding trail ran past the natural beauty of the southern waterfalls. I took my time enjoying the beauty of the trees around me. Honestly, it was calming. A serene feeling washed over me as I continued my hike.

I’m not the most athletic person. So when I reached the stairs by the Lower South Falls, a pit dropped in my stomach. I stood catching my breath, and debating on if I would continue my hike. Was I really willing to continue an exhausting hike that would most likely take the whole day? I decided it wasn’t worth it. As I began to turn to walk the same trail back to the cabin. I heard something. I immediately froze. I knew of course it could just be a bird, or some animal moving through the underbrush. But, I didn’t want to take any chances. I stood so still, that you would have been forgiven if you had stumbled upon me and turned the other way. Suddenly, the smell hit my nose. The smell of rot, and decay wafted around me. Penetrating my nostrils, and filling my brain with fear. 

The underbrush continued to crack, as something approached the trail. The snapping of twigs became louder and more sporadic. My eyes darted around the trail for an escape route. Suddenly, the brush parted as a deer stumbled onto the trail. It let out a pained cry, and fell over. The smell of rot was emanating from the animal. The deer's chest rose and fell slowly. The labored breathing continued, as the animal looked up at me. The black horizontal pupils focused on me. And slowly began to dim. The breathing stopped, and the animal was finally at rest. With the corpse of the deer now blocking the trail back. I had no choice but to walk past. The rot was overwhelming now. I pulled my shirt up over my nose, to block out the smell. I approached gingerly to walk past. As I inched my way closer, I noticed the gory mess around the deer’s stomach. 

The deer’s stomach was bloated.  Even without a lack of knowledge on biology, you would most likely realize this is abnormal. Especially for an animal that had just died. The bloating however, was a minute detail in comparison to the large hole on the deer’s stomach. I knelt down, to get a better look. Still covering my nose with my shirt. The biologist in me was too interested to look away. The torn open flesh flowers outwards. Forming grotesque petals that lined a deep hole into the deer's stomach. Suddenly something in my brain clicked. It was an exit wound, something had burrowed its way out of the deer. 

The realization of what this had meant dawned on me quickly. It caused me to run frantically down the trail. My feet thudded against the mud. I was struggling to reach the end of the trail. My labored breathing caused me to try and push myself further. My lungs burned, but I needed to make it back to the Park Office. As I made it to the trail's end, I saw the building. It drew me in like a moth to a flame. My brain single mindedly focused on making it to the building. I burst through the door. The ranger’s turned eyes wide. Looks of concern are prevalent on all of their faces. I bent over catching my breath, my hands gripping my knees. As I caught my breath, I looked up.

“Where’s Mary?” I wheezed out. The ranger’s looked at each other silently. I stood, inhaling to project my voice. “Where is Mary?” My voice shook slightly. One of the ranger’s pointed to the door, I  had walked through earlier with Declan. I stumbled over, and pushed open the door. 

Mary lay on the cot. She was writhing in pain. The woman was wearing a bra, and pants. However, her stomach was bare and bloated. The woman gritted her teeth.  Joseph stood over her. He ignored me, as I burst into the room. He was holding the other ranger’s hand, as she screamed. The sickening sound of splitting flesh sounded out through the room. I stood watching in fear, as Mary’s stomach split open. My eyes wide, as the flesh flowered out. I felt my stomach turn, as slowly something began to emerge from the wound.

 A head the size of baseball slowly emerged. The oval shaped head moved around, mandibles snapped slightly. It glistened, from the viscera that coated it. Mary laid back, her eyes rolling into her head. Joseph, gingerly picked the thing up. He held the bloody worm-like mass to his body. It squirmed slightly. The thing was the size of a newborn infant. Through the viscera I could make out ridges across the thing's body. It was a light pale color, with a lighter colored head. As the mandibles clicked, I realized they were shaped like human fingers. I began to gag from the horrific sight in front of me. Joseph finally turned to the doorway acknowledging my presence. He cradled it lovingly. Like a proud father looking down at his child. He made eye contact with me and smiled. He opened his mouth to speak. 

“Christ has been reborn.”
