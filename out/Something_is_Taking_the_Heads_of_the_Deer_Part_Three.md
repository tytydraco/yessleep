**Entry 5:**

You’ve got to be shitting me.

A massive blizzard rolled in during the night while I was asleep. There’s got to be nearly two feet or more of snow. I’m snowed in. For the time being at least.

There was no forecast for this; I regularly monitor the weather because living so far out in the woods, I need to plan out plowing when the snow gets heavy.

Luckily my buddy Matt owns a plowing business and if I give him a call, I’m number one customer priority. Unfortunately, both my Wi-Fi and my service are shotty as hell; it took me over an hour to finally reach Matt and ask him to plow the snow off my trail. He told me the earliest he could arrive was in the evening. I told him we could stop by the bar for some food and beers afterwards to catch up. My treat of course. He readily agreed and I impatiently waited for his arrival and me being able to leave this wretched place that is plaguing me with deer.

 

**Entry 6:**

Matt never made it to my house. Darkness was quickly approaching and I heard nothing from Matt. Neither my texts or my calls were going through. As my frustration kept building up, I remembered he has his location on in snapchat maps. When I opened the app up and looked at his location, it showed that he was on the trail leading to my house. My excitement grew as I realized salvation was upon me.

Except his location didn’t move. Initially I chalked it up to bad reception, but after nearly 10 minutes of watching the maps and looking out my window for approaching headlights, there was nothing. The map indicated that he was only a little ways down the trail from the main road.

I kept repeating to myself, *this can’t be happening right now.* As my worry kept mounting for my friend, he may have been stuck out there with God knows what. I wasn’t going to leave him out there to dry. Although it is entirely possible that he got stuck and hasn’t been able to reach me because the cell service is even worse down that trail. Regardless, I decided to act. I bundled up in some winter gear, grabbed my rifle, a good flashlight, and I departed to trudge into the woods to face whatever lay ahead of me.

The encroaching darkness had reached its zenith as I made my way from my yard to the trail head. Fortunately, the moon was full and there was heavy snow on the ground, which afforded me some, but not much visibility in the night even without my flashlight. Upon entering the trail I felt as though I was being swallowed and in going further and further into the trail I was going down the throat of some giant. If I was lucky, I would just be able to pass through; if not, maybe it would devour me, *or worse*.

The trees surrounding me on either side of the trail appeared as a solid wall. *Are the trees shielding something away from me? Or are the trees shielding me away from something?* I began to ask myself. I didn’t want to find out the answer to that.

As I continued on, I noticed how quiet it was. Nothing could be heard: no wind, no animal noises, nothing. This only added to the foreboding feeling that grew heavier within me. Scanning the surrounding woods, I couldn’t make out anything in my field of vision.

Finally, as I passed a curve in the trail, I spotted the faint sight of lights in the distance.

As soon as I was about to take off towards the lights, I heard movement behind me.

I whipped around with my flashlight scanning the woods on either side of me to find the source of the movement.

Right before the forest meets the trail I saw something. Antlers and that same patchy face with clouded eyes I saw the day before. It was staring right at me. I couldn’t see all of it, it was poking its head out at me from behind a tree. We both stood for a few moments, eyes locked on each other, unblinking until it finally stepped out from the woods and onto the trail.

As I finally saw its entire body, needles of fear pricked me throughout my entire body. It had the head of a deer; the head of a deer it had taken I presume now. It moved on two legs, its body the shape of human. Except it wasn’t made of flesh, it appeared to be made of wood. Its torso was the trunk of a tree, branches acted as its limbs and bones with twigs wrapping around the joints acting as connective tissue, long sharp branches in the shape of curved wooden stakes were its clawed fingers.

It took a step towards me. I bolted or at least I attempted to. The dozens of inches of snow severely slowed me down. I was hopping more than running, trying to clear my feet of the snow just for me to penetrate my step back into it. I heard nothing more behind me but I dared not look.

After going on like this for about 50 or so feet, my foot caught on a root and I fell face first into the snow. I immediately flipped onto my back, grasping for my rifle I realized I had dropped it when I bolted away from that thing. I still had my flashlight and illuminating where I had just run from I could see that there was nothing. I pivoted around all sides and I saw no trace of whatever that thing was. I now stood there, panting and sweating but there was no time for breaks, I had to continue on to Matt’s truck lest I wished to wait for the wooden deer thing to appear again.

The truck remained unmoving, its headlights shining directly in front of me, inhibiting my ability to see beyond them into the truck. I rushed forward, moving as fast as my legs would take me despite the resistance from the snow, the cold air piercing my heaving lungs.

I finally made it to the truck; I clawed my way to the drivers side only to find that it was empty with the door wide open. There was no sign of Matt; I started calling out his name,

“Matt! Matt! Matt!”

At this point I knew whatever I saw earlier could hear me and it had probably been watching me this entire time, stalking me in the shadows.

I looked down to see if I could find any indication of where Matt went. I found footprints in the snow. It appeared the rear driver’s side tire got stuck and would not get out; there was snow that had been kicked by the wheel behind the truck as evidence. The footprints went from the driver’s door to the back to examine how bad he was stuck. From there the tracks went straight into the woods.

Based on the appearance of the tracks, he was going at a fast pace away from the vehicle, away from safety.

I know it was a dumb idea to blindly follow the tracks, but I was on autopilot. I don’t know how far or long I had been following the trail when the tracks suddenly stopped. As if Matt had just taken off from the ground. I couldn’t make sense of what I was seeing; I couldn’t make sense of anything that was going on.

Once the tracks ceased, I finally stopped and gauged my surroundings. Trees surrounded me on all sides; I had gone far enough to where the lights of Matt’s truck were no longer visible. Even worse, when I turned around, I saw that both mine and Matt’s tracks in the snow had suddenly disappeared. It wasn’t like I walked from the truck out here in straight line because the tracks I followed weaved around the forest. I was now spinning around looking for any signs of land I could recognize or was familiar with. Based on the amount of time and distance I walked following the tracks, it was evident I was no longer on my land. I know every nook and cranny of my land.

I knew the tracks were headed mostly eastwards, but in the time from when I departed for Matt’s truck to that point, the night sky filled with clouds. My vision of the stars in the night sky had vanished and so did visibility as it was noticeably darker outside now. Worse yet, snow began to pelt down hard on me.

From behind me, I heard the crunching of snow.

I pivoted as fast as my feet could turn me to see what was behind me. It was a lone coyote.

I think we both scared each other tremendously. For a moment we were at a standstill, the coyotes’ eyes reflecting a yellow glow. All of a sudden, the coyote began to emit a deep growl while bearing its teeth, and pointed its haunches up in the air. It did not appear to be aiming its aggression at me though but past me. I abruptly turned around which in the glow of my flashlight I still managed to cling to revealed nothing. From behind me I could hear the coyote now beginning to whimper, as I turned my gaze back to it, I watched carefully as it tucked its tail between its legs with its ears down and scamper away.

I had no intention of lingering to find out what the cause of the coyote’s fear was. So, I did the only thing that seemed rational for me to do as I was lost in the woods; I ran in the direction the coyote fled. Not in the hope that it would lead me back to civilization, but to guide me away from any danger.

I quickly lost sight of the coyote; however, I could still hear it running through the snow and deadwood.

I very soon lost track of the lone coyote, but in doing so I came upon a set of what appeared to be footprints in the snow, boots by the look of it. What disturbed me about them though is that they just began out of nowhere; as if whatever it was suddenly materialized in a physical form and began walking, leaving prints in the snow. Having no other options, I decided to follow these tracks now. It felt as though I was on some wild goose chase now, just following any sets of tracks in the snow I could find. By this point I had all but entirely stopped calling Matt’s name.

After following these tracks some distance, I was beginning to lose hope that I’d find my way back tonight, I may be out here all night or at least until the sky clears up. The snow was falling in chunks rather than snowflakes and the temperature was rapidly declining; I didn’t know if I would be able to survive the night out in the woods. There was some being made of wood and severed deer heads and the elements out here against me. I didn’t particularly like these odds. I began to quicken my pace following the tracks, worried they would become covered by the snow or simply vanish like the other tracks.

Suddenly I spotted what appeared to be some kind of opening in the woods. As I erupted through the tree line, I found that I was now back in my yard.

Examining my surroundings, I saw that the footprints led all the way to my house where my front door stood open. Not a single light on.

I decided to slink back into the edge of the tree line and stalk my way around the perimeter about 30 feet to my storage shed where I have some old hunting rifles that I hope still function.

Which leads me to where I’m at now. I am frantically writing this entry with numbed fingers while considering my next course of action. Me being the dumbass that I am I forgot to bring my truck keys from the counter when I decided to trek into the unknown in search of my friend. I can either attempt to flee on foot, sticking to the trail, and attempting to hail down anyone who may happen to drive down the road. Or I can go into my house and retrieve my truck keys as quickly as possible, hoping not to find out what made its way into my house.

My best chance would be to attempt to drive around Matt’s vehicle that is stuck in the snow. I don’t know for certain if there is enough space for me to make it past with my truck. But I think it’s worth a shot.
