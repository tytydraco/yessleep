I am a small history fanatic. I love everything history; ancient ruins, wars and battles, how countries and continents came to be, all of this. I specifically love old historical texts and literature. I love reading old scripts written in forgotten languages, Coptic, Latin, Hieroglyphics, Sanskrit. I love deciphering the codes and learning the languages all over again. 


One historic literature mystery that seemed really interesting, was Patrick O’Ddity; a poet seemingly lost in time. 


He wasn’t a famous poet. He wasn’t like Thomas Hardy, or Edgar Allan Poe, or William Shakespeare. He was something better. All his works, from his oldest to his ‘most recent’, captured me. Like reading the worn-down papers cast a spell on me. O’Ddity really was something. Then he just, disappeared. No death, no missing person’s report, nothing. He was just, *gone*. Now it seems like no one has ever heard of him. But he is -or was real. This is what started my four year long historic journey; to find out what happened to Patrick O’Ddity, and maybe get into the history books. The reason my search took so long was because of how little there actually is of the man. His poems are there, but nothing of him. No birth place, no family, not even what time period he could have been in. It really was a mystery. So, I started with the second-best thing; analysing his poems.


I started with “When Roots Align and Tree Bark Calls”, one of his older works. It sent me on a wild goose chase in Austria, only to lead me back to square one. Then I tried “Someone Calls, No Answers Here”, which then sent me to rural Scotland. That sort of got me something, I did find out Patrick loved the old Scottish castles and country side. And finally, I tried “To Find and Answer, We Must Make Do”, which finally *finally* got me somewhere. A small house in a wooded area in current day Malta. 


The house looked abandoned, not touched for years. Mould took up most of the wall space, and the floors were damp. Vines climbed up the outside and balled together in a knot on top of the house. There was no door, bugs seemed to have chewed through the wood and all the remained where small splinters around the metal hinges. Inside was empty, except for a bunch of papers on a seemingly untouched desk. Now I don’t mean that it looks like the rest of the house, the desk looked like not even nature could unleash its wrath onto it. The only thing wrong with it and everything on it was a bit dusty. I found it a bit weird but, my exciting about finding Patrick’s other works and maybe making history threw that thought to the back of my mind. I took everything off the desk, the papers, quills, ink, *everything*, and carefully put them in my bag. I went back home with a skip in my step, knowing I had a part of uncharted history on my person. *Finally,*  my four year long journey could come to an end.


Getting back home I immediately went to the stack of papers. It seemed to be just the usual stuff you’d think an old poet would have; unfinished poems, extra paper, newspapers, just the usual. Then there was something at the bottom of the pile. It seemed to be just thrown under everything else, it was crumbled in some places and overall looked much messier than the others. I read the title; “To Make Do, We Must Make Sacrifice”. *It was Patrick O’Ddity’s actual last poem!” Excited, I read through it, expecting it to be like his other work. I was wrong. This one was, off. It was still good but it was just, off. The writing was a mess, like he was in a rush to write it. Like he was running out of time. 


*To Make Do, We Must Make Sacrifice:
Unfinished, underlying, what is time?
Who decides how it goes, tick tock tick
I could use some more time, that would be grand
But alas, my time as come
Should He spare me, I shall forever grateful
Should He lust for me, I shall forever gone
Tick tock tick goes the clock
Mine has stopped long ago
To make do with my unticking, unwinding clock
He sacrifice me, once again
This time for forever more* 


I’m not sure why, but once I read that poem, I decided to try reading the titles aloud together. I didn’t think it would work, but wow was I surprised at the outcome. I realised the titles of the poems make up another poem. They all link. It doesn’t make much sense but it’s readable. I went in chronological order, first to last. 


*Skies are Darkened, What You Seek is Me
When You Seek Me, No Turning Back
Don’t Turn Back and No Running
Running Doesn’t Let You Flee
Fleeing Does Not Rid of Me
To Rid of Me, Is to Rid of Yourself
Rid of Yourself and No More Games
The Game is Over, Roots Have Aligned
When Roots Align and Tree Bark Calls
Someone Calls, No Answers Here 
To Find and Answer, We Must Make Do 
To Make Do, We Must Make Sacrifice* 


It, honestly seems more like a threat or chant then a poem. But, that’s just silly. I mean, maybe what was written on the unfinished poems was true, that *”He has come for me”* or *”My work is not my own”* or that *”If you curse to read these words, shall you face the same fait as I”*, but it’s not! The devil didn’t *really* speak through O’Ddity, ‘He’ didn’t give him the literature greatness. And I’m sure many others have read his work. I mean, I’m certain my old professor recommended his work to me, or did I find it in my desk drawer? I’m sure I didn’t, did I? - No, my professor recommended me this. – Didn’t I find, *all* of the poems in my desk at different points? – No, that’s crazy! They don’t just appear. – But what if they did? – No! No, I found them in, in in, the library! Yeah, the library. – The library doesn’t have a poetry section though, does it? – No it doesn’t. 



Am I going to die?
