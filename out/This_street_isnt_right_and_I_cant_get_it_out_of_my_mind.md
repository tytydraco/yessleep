My arm feels like it’s being ripped out of its socket. “Mmmph.” “Henry, *please*,” I grunt. 60 pounds of muscle strain at the end of the leash, its nylon digging into my wrist. 

I think of the story my old coworker, a 50 year old nurse practitioner named Robin, used to love to tell from her time working in the ER. I unwrap Henry’s leash from my wrist as the word “degloved” shudders down my spine.

Henry pulls again, hard. I squint in the direction he keeps pulling, trying, and failing, to see what he is so desperate to smell, or chase, or pee on. *“I really need to get this dog into training.”*

My wife would be pissed I’m walking Henry in the dark again, but I can’t help that Nebraska gets dark at 7 PM in September. She bought us this light up leash that glows neon green and would be perfect to see what this dumbo is tugging so hard towards right now, but I always forget to charge it. I feel the weight of the dead and useless leash strung across my chest like a pageant sash. 

Henry yanks, snapping me out of my reverie and twisting the leash out of my fingers. I stumble forward, barely catching myself from falling to my hands and knees as Henry shoots off into the backyard we’re about to pass. All I see is a flash of brown and then it’s dusky swing sets and crickets.

“God dammit.” I hiss between gritted teeth. The dentist has been nagging me about clenching my jaw. He says if I don’t stop grinding my teeth, I could crack one, but it’s been a nervous habit since as long as I can remember. 

I bend down and pick up Henry’s poop bag, dropped in the commotion, and jog into the backyard in the general direction I saw Henry go. “Henry!” “Henry, c’mere bubba,” I call out as I weave past the swing set and a scraggly hedge into the next yard.  I hear no reply but the soft crunch of leaves as I jog forward into the next yard. 

“Bubba! Here!” I whistle, but still am met with silence. 

I strain my eyes against the growing dim, seeing mostly outlines of houses and trees illuminated by the street lamps. Then I see it; a brown 4 legged streak moving 2 houses down and across the street into the next block. “Henry!” I call and run in his direction. 

*“Fuck, he’s fast.”* I barely make it across the street to the next block before I see him squeeze between 2 hedges into the next yard north. “Henry**, stop**!” I yell, but it’s pointless as he’s clearly hot on the trail of some small helpless mammal and has no more ears to listen to me. *“I am enrolling this dog into training* ***tonight****.”* 

I swing a leg over the hedge Henry went through, hauling myself forward. The shoelaces of my left sneaker catch as I try to cross the barrier. This time I do fall to my hands and knees. I look up in time to see Henry running full speed down the intersecting road. I can’t tell what he’s chasing, but quickly he is out of my line of sight, blocked by the houses catty corner to my position on the grass. I stand and brush my hands on my sweats, rubbing the grass off, and then I take off sprinting in his direction.

As I run down the street, I continue to call Henry’s name, desperate for a response to know that he has stopped running. I hear none, and I see less. Flashes of brown, grey, and tan streak by my periphery. I pass house after suburban house, quickly glancing over their driveways and manicured front lawns for a glimpse of brown fur. “Damnit Henry, where are you?” I gasp, feeling tears begin to prick at the corners of my eyes. I can feel myself moving from slight annoyance to real worry rapidly. I’ve seen no sight of him for the last 3 blocks. 

I continue forward, slowing my jog, but continuing to call out Henry’s name. I’m having a harder time seeing through the tears and the growing twilight. I can’t see past the rows of lit up front lawns, the backyards shrouded in shadow. Henry could be back there, in a bush or under a porch, and I would never know he’s there. “Henry, *please*,” I plead. Images of the missing dog posters that line our favorite walking trail are flashing before my eyes. I can feel the lump in my chest moving into my throat, threatening to break out in a sob.

Right before my dam breaks, Henry comes skittering out of a backyard to my right, haunches raised and ears flattened to his head. His eyes are so wide, I can see the whites from my spot in the road 15 feet away. I rush towards him as he rushes to me. We meet at the foot of the house’s driveway as he presses into my legs and I grab his nylon leash.

I gasp in relief and unclench my jaw; my teeth feel like they’re groaning as the weight is lifted. *“Thank God thank God thank God.”* 

Henry whines as presses harder into my legs, as if he’s trying to disappear into them. He is shaking and panting all at the same time. I kneel in front of to him, wrapping my arms around his neck like I did when he was a puppy and I was trying to condition him to like hugs. “Shhhh. It’s okay boy. I got you. It’s okay,” I coo. “Did you get scared because you got lost, or did a rabbit finally decide to fight back?” Henry responds with a whine that fades into a shrill yelp. I’ve never seen him this riled up before. *“I should call Cassandra. Maybe he also needs to go on Trazodone like she’s always talking about,”* I think.

I stand up, knees aching after kneeling on the cold asphalt. I scan the houses surrounding me to gain my bearings. They don’t look familiar, but it is a big neighborhood. I squint at the street sign at the nearby intersection. Green and white shapes blend together. I huff, frustrated at the deepening twilight’s impact on my vision, and pull Henry towards the signs. Henry balks, but eventually scoots alongside me. 

“Kessler and West 64th Street. Well that doesn’t help,” I mutter. I glance back the way I came, but all the houses seem the same — brown siding, two story, split level, sloped driveway, cracked concrete. Nothing looks familiar, yet I’ve walked Henry in the neighborhood by our apartments every evening for the last three years we’ve lived there. *“Does the neighborhood just go much deeper than I thought?”* I can feel my teeth clenching again. I grip Henry’s leash tighter as I pull out my phone.

Apple Maps gives no answers. I stare at the blue circle that marks my current location — Northgate and West 64 Street. I zoom in and out on the screen. Nothing changes. There is no Kessler street. I am clearly at the corner of Northgate and West 64th Street. I look back up at the street sign and see in reflective white letters, Kessler Street. “Okay?” I say, dragging out the “y” in a way that my dad would have called very “valley girl”.  

“Okay, well, I think this is our sign to go home now Henry,” I say as I turn to walk away from the street corner, giving the leash a gentle tug. I don’t want to turn my back to the sign, but I can’t explain why. Henry follows with no resistance. 

I walk to the nearest sidewalk to begin making my way home. I still don’t recognize the houses I pass. They’re in the distinctive style of the neighborhood that I’m familiar with — wood siding, front porch, a suburban area created in a hurry — but they lack features I recognize. I know the house by the neighborhood pool has a weeping willow. I know the lawn where there is always a bike laying out. Henry seems back to his regular self, eagerly pulling at the leash ahead of me. The quiet and the dusk that has fully fallen is beginning to unnerve me. I just want to get home. This neighborhood doesn’t feel right.

*“Oh my God, literally what are you talking about? It’s a fucking neighborhood. You sound crazy.”* I hear the immediate retort in my thoughts and feel my consciousness snapping back to reality. *“Right. That’s right. I’m freaked cause Henry ran off and I thought I lost him. That’s it. I’m fine. I’m not crazy”* I repeat this manta again and again in my mind as Henry and I pass through blocks and down streets in the general direction of home.

Finally I spot the house with the wrap around porch that I remember. I sigh, unclenching my jaw, which I didn’t realize I was holding so tight. But behind the facade of calm and mantras of grounding, I can’t shake the knowledge that that street *was* wrong. It wasn’t supposed to be there.
