I work at a Cold Stone Creamery. Been here for a little over a month now, and I've noticed something strange. It always happens during my opening shift around, 11AM, right when I open up the shop for customers. 

A little context before I get into it: I work opening, so I'm here at 10AM to prep the shop for open at 11AM. I work alone until the midday person comes in at 3PM. The mornings are slow, barely anyone wants ice cream in the morning on a weekday. I setup, I take inventory, I make ice cream, etc. I'm usually done setting up the tables (inside and outside) and the stone (where the chop chop fold happens) by about 10:40-10:45AM and that's the morning I make ice cream. 

So, at 11AM, on the dot, the phone rings. Caller ID shows a bunch of pound (#) signs, I answer, do my whole song and dance of "Thank you for calling Cold Stone Creamery! How can I help you?" On Tuesdays and Thursdays, the response is a man's scream. On Mondays, I hear what I just said repeated back to me in my own voice. The rest of the weekdays, it's just silence. I do a 54321 countdown and hangup, and no call back for the rest of the day. This has been going on since the first day I opened solo. 

Last week marked a full month of me working here, and something new has popped up on my daily routine. So Wednesday, I'm doing my very typical routine. I get the call at 11AM, silence, 54321, hangup. But right when I hung up the phone, a loud crash came from the walk in freezer. 

*Great, I'm gonna have to freeze my ass cleaning up ice cream because someone couldn't do the simple task of setting containers on a shelf correctly.* I think to myself as I shoulder on my jacket.

I take a peek at the monitor displaying the security footage of the store, no customers coming in, and I step into the freezer. It's not just cold, it's too cold. The take your breath away kind of cold. And... The lights are off. I prop the door open with my foot and look for a switch but can't find one. 

*Another reason to bother my boss, yay.* 

Before I turn to leave the freezer, I feel a warm breath on my cheek. The kind of breath you take to warm your hands. A "haaaaaah" sound came with the breath, and fear made the back of my neck hot and prickly. I was alone in the store. Not a single person walked in through that front door. This fear was debilitating, freezing me in place. 

"S-stop." I managed to cough out. That was enough mental momentum to fully push the door open and rush out of the freezer. Without another glance, I slammed the door close with as much force as I could manage. 

"What the actual fuck?" Was all I could say as I just stood there, staring at the freezer door. I didn't know what to do at that point, the best thing would be to pretend it never happened. There's a logical explanation for everything, so there's got to be one for whatever the hell that was. I got spooked over a bit of darkness and a weird noise. So, I opened the door again and... nothing. The freezer was as it always was, lights were on, everything in it's place. I sighed in relief.

Since then, the freezer blackout session has continued, but each time I hear a random assortment of clicks. This freak event always starts after I hang up the phone. After that first time, it's not a crashing noise, I just manage to find myself needing to go into the freezer around the same time. I haven't mentioned the blackouts to anyone at work since they seem to not be causing any harm to the products.

I'll update if anything new happens.
