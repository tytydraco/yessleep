“Did you hear from the Delavares?” 



“Not since their son disappeared in the mist.”



My ears perked up. 



“It’s terrible. Why haven’t the authorities done anything?”



“They’re probably trying to hide it, you know how much panic it would cause?”



“I know, but how many more people can we lose? It started with old Bill’s wife and now all these young men.”



I slowly turned my head to listen better. The old couple saw me immediately. The wife shot me a disapproving look and lowered her voice.



Shit. I’ll never make friends in this town. The past few weeks have been unbearably lonely.



I sighed as the waiter came by. I paid for my food and slowly got up.



My phone began to ring. It was Mom again. I couldn’t talk to her without seeing Dad wasting away in bed.



The next morning, I woke up early. The streets were silent, and the sky was cloudy, a perfect time for a run. My dad had loved this weather.



I ran for 3 miles when I got a strange feeling. Almost like something was tightening in my chest. Then I realized the mist was starting to set in.



I wasn’t a superstitious person, but as the mist set in, my heart began to beat faster. 



I tried to calm myself down, but the feeling grew.



Then I heard a voice. I took my headphones out and tried to look ahead. A man a few feet ahead of me was jumping in place, screaming something. 

“What?” I called out, running towards him.



“What the fuck are you doing? The mist is almost fully set in.”



His urgency made me feel more uneasy. When I got to him, he grabbed my arm and started dragging me to his house.



“What are you doing?” I said and wrestled out of his grip.



He looked me up and down, turned around, and ran back.



I stood there, trying to piece together what was going on, but then, I heard a strange rumbling somewhere behind me, followed by a long grunt. It didn’t sound like anything I could name.

The hair on my arm stood up. The man opened his door just a little. I looked around and quickly ran in.



He locked the door behind me.



“Jesus Christ, what’s your problem, man. The mist is here!”



“What?” I said, my voice still shaking.



He measured me up and down and then looked deep into my eyes.



“You’re new here, aren’t you?” 



“Ye…yeah.”



“Did no one warn you of the mist?”



“No, no one did.”



“The fucking people of this town,“ he threw his hands around like my dad used to do. It helped me calm down.



“Come on in. I’ll give you some tea.” 



He sat me down at the table and started the tea kettle. Old cups, cutlery, and plates were displayed on various shelves around his house. 



In his living room, I could see an old couch with a blanket lying on it. Under one of the corners was a small, dark yellow stain. The house smelled stale, undercut by an unmistakable smell of rot.



The kettle sizzled. He poured the water into both cups and put the tea bag in.



“You know what? Wait in the living room.” He smiled while fiddling with the cups. 



He stayed in the kitchen for a while longer. I could hear the shelves opening and closing.



“Here you go,” he said, setting the cup down.



“I’m really sorry no one warned you. No one warned us when we first moved in, either. My wife wasn’t so lucky to find shelter as you did.”



“I’m sorry.”



“No reason to. She’s in a better place now.”



“I’m sure she was a beautiful person.”



“She was. I’ll show you a photo,” he said and walked out of the room.



The couch had a strange stench. I pulled the blanket away. The stain was all over it.



I put the blanket back and sank into the couch. I bumped into something hard behind the cushion. I searched around for it. 



It was a leather wallet. Inside was a young man’s driver’s license.



His last name was Delavares.



My head started spinning. I had to grab onto the couch. The toilet flushed. I quickly hid the wallet back and stared at the man with my hands between my thighs, rocking back and forth.



“Oh, you barely touched your tea. Everything okay? Don’t worry, we’re safe here.”



“I…I need to leave.”



“Are you crazy? I’m not going to try to save you again.” His smile was gone. 



“I really need to go.” I started getting up.



“You’re not going anywhere!”



He walked over, dropping his wife’s picture, and pushed me back to the couch.



The glass shattered on the floor.



My body sank deep into the couch.



Then he climbed atop me and put his hand around my neck.



His hands felt firm.



The pressure in my head was rising.



I tried to reach for something on the table, but it was too far away.



The old man then started searching for something in his pocket.



His grip was too strong; I couldn’t wrench his hand off my neck.



I panicked and, with all my force, kicked my knee into his groin. He grabbed it and rolled to the floor.



I got up and quickly ran out, not stopping.



When I made it back home, I quickly grabbed my phone to call the police, but as I was about to dial their number, my Mom called me again.



“Mom, Mom?!”



“Johnny, finally,” I could hear her softly sobbing.



“Mom, I’m so sorry I didn’t know what I was doing, leaving home, but dad’s death was…”



“I know, honey, it was hard for all of us. Please just come home.”



“I will, Mom. I will.”



“I love you, Johnny.”



“I love you too, Mom.”



I hung up and cried like I hadn’t cried in years.



The police searched the man’s house. They found the Delavares’ bodies slowly decomposing in the basement, along with other remains. 



The man had lured the young men in by playing into their superstitions. It made my gut wrench knowing I could have been one of them.



On my way back, I sat at the same diner again. Another old couple was talking behind me.



“Can you believe it? They arrested old Bill for killing the boys the mist took.”



“It’s horrible how deep the conspiracy goes. How did they even know he was the first one to warn the town of the mist?”



I wanted to turn around and scream at them, but I realized there would be no point in doing so.



The coffee started to taste stale.



I left it there half-drunk.
