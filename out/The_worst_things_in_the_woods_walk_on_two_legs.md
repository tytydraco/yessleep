Summer in Tennessee is a kind of hot that you cannot possibly fathom unless you have experienced it for yourself. You may be used to the heat of the dry, wide expanses of the Southwest, or the desert heat of western Colorado, or even the scorching heat of Texas, but nothing prepares you for the intense heat of a June day in Tennessee. 

It was the last day of June in 2007, and we were on summer vacation in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, which straddles the border between Tennessee and North Carolina in the southern end of the Appalachian Mountains. The thermometer read eighty-seven degrees, but the air conditioner in the family’s Ford Escape ran full blast trying to wick the sweat off our skin into air just as sticky, a futile effort to cool ourselves as if blowing a roaring furnace out like a birthday candle. Even at highway speed, the open windows only seemed to let in more hot air and mosquitos, yet we kept them open because a breeze was better than nothing. 

My mother had grown up in Tennessee, though in the western half of the state. She had always remembered Smoky Mountains fondly as a family vacation destination, and now, though we lived halfway across the country, had elected to share her childhood experiences with her own children. 

I was twelve years old, and, being the only girl, had to sit in the middle back seat of the Escape, crammed between my brothers, Isaac and Noah, their gross sweaty elbows and shoulders jabbing me with every bump in the road. The drive from Grandma’s house in Memphis had been unbearable. 

When we reached the town of Pigeon Forge outside the park’s entrance, we were all desperate to get out of the truck. Isaac in particular had a vested interest - Pigeon Forge is steeped in Civil War history, and at fifteen years of age Isaac was going through his Civil War History phase. He insisted you could ‘feel the history rolling off the hills’, whatever that means. I felt something. So did mom. We did not stop in Pigeon Forge. It’s all a tourist trap town anyways, mom said. 

Fifteen minutes later we passed through Gatlinburg, a town with even more history and less vice, and the air grew somehow even more oppressive. Just past Gatlinburg, we entered the National Park. We expected it to be a reprieve - the cool mountain air and all that - but it was just as hot as we climbed into the park. We rolled past the entrance area with its staff cabins and maintenance lots and pulled up to the main parking area. Disembarking from the car, we could feel the heat reflecting off the blacktop and were eager to get to the grass, but even that provided little reprieve. 

“Boy it’s hot,” Isaac said. 

Mom chewed her thoughts for a moment. “Down the hill there’s a creek at the treeline. Let’s set up down there.”

We all followed mom as she’d been to this park before, albeit twenty years prior or more. She led us down a deer-path straight down an embankment towards the treeline, where, sure enough we found a little creek babbling happily. We set up a picnic blanket and dad’s little portable grill on the only flat area near the creek, and dad set about getting the grill started, while my brothers and I decided to explore the woods while we waited for lunch. 

“Don’t go too far!” Mom called after us as we disappeared behind the treeline. “And remember your way back! Chilren have disappeared in these woods!” 

My brothers seemed to shrug off mom’s warnings, but they resonated with me. I did remember, in fact, seeing news stories about people disappearing in this park, and one little boy who disappeared here was often said to have been taken by a sasquatch… or something very much like it. I didn’t know how much I believed these stories, but my brothers loved telling stories about scary things in the woods to freak me out, particularly on camping trips. 

Still, it was what Dad always said that made me shudder the most as we disappeared behind the treeline. 

“The scariest things in the woods walk on two legs.” 

At home, Isaac loved making toy guns. He was obsessed with them. He learned how to use the skill-saw in Dad’s garage to cut out silhouettes of rifles, then wood-glued clothespins to them so that he could shoot rubber bands off them. He sold these to the neighborhood kids one summer and made two hundred dollars, and all the kids on the block were out shooting each other with rubber bands all summer long until our parents got fed up and banded together to confiscate all the rubber band guns. They burned them all in a celebratory fire, but Isaac still got his money. Now, in the hot, humid woods that offered nearly no reprieve from the July heat permeating the entire park, he picked up vaguely gun-looking sticks and issued them to me and Noah as he barked out orders for our exploratory mission for the day. We dutifully followed him deeper into the woods, wooden rifles slung over our shoulders patriotically. 

Once we had traveled a reasonable distance from the campsite, we stopped in a clearing. “This will do,” Isaac said matter-of-factly. “Start bringing me wood and I’ll build our base here.” In the woods near our house, we were always able to find plenty of wood to build our fortresses, but the woods in Smoky Mountain had largely been picked clean by campers looking for firewood, so this proved to be a more difficult task than we anticipated. We ended up breaking small limbs off of trees, which built less of a fortress and more of a teepee, so we eventually gave up and continued our hike. 

We had probably wandered the better part of a mile into the woods now, and were definitely further from Mom and Dad than we should’ve been. We couldn’t smell the grill anymore, and were relying on our own timing to know when to turn back for lunch, but the fact of the matter was that I had no idea how much time had passed since we entered the woods. 

“Isaac?” I asked. “When should we go back? I’m hungry.”

Isaac didn’t look back to face me. “This trail loops back,” he said, despite the fact that I wasn’t sure if we were following a trail or a deer-path. Most of the trails in the park were paved with crushed granite, this one was just raw dirt which broke into mud in places. I decided to trust my brother. 

About another fifteen minutes I got a feeling which I did not like, a sort of prickling in the back of my neck. I didn’t recognize it then in my young age, but I know now that it is the feeling that you’re being watched. Noah felt it too. He clutched his wooden gun a little more tightly and walked so close up to Isaac that he was treading on the backs of his feet. “Isaac,” he said, “let’s go back. I want to go eat.”

"It loops back,” Isaac repeated. “We’re closer to the end than to the beginning.”

Somewhere up ahead, there was a crashing sound in the undergrowth. We froze as we listened to it cross the dense woods in front of us. We knew well from countless afternoons playing in the woods that a small animal on the forest floor could sound much bigger than it really was, but this wasn’t that. This thing had a specific pattern to the noise it made, a type of shh-shh. Shh-shh. Shh-shh. 

It was walking on two legs. 

“I think it’s a bear,” Noah whispered. “Let’s turn back.”

"It’s just a hiker,” Isaac said.

“Off the trail?” I asked. 

Isaac gestured towards the little deerpath we had been following. “We’re off the trail. Have been for an hour.

The footsteps stopped, dead ahead down the deerpath from us. We froze in our tracks, afraid to move. That’s when we heard it. 

Something was moving on the trail *behind* us as well. 

The thing behind us didn’t move in the same way. It sounded more like an animal, clearly large in size but moving nearly silently. If we hadn’t already been listening for the footsteps ahead of us we would’ve never heard it. It didn’t shuffle through leaf litter on two legs like the thing in front of us. It moved quietly and gracefully, and made only a slight scratching sound in the undergrowth. Isaac and Noah looked at each other, wide-eyed, and Noah mouthed the words so I wouldn’t hear them. I could read his lips, though. 

*Mountain lion.*

We didn’t know what to do, but luckily the decision ended up being made for us as we listened to the creature move alongside us in the undergrowth. For a split second, it came out into the open and we got a glimpse of it through the trees. It looked like a mountain lion sure enough, but it was huge, bigger even than the lions we’d seen at the zoo. It was closer in size to a tiger, but covered in shaggy golden hair and little spots like a bobcat. It had no apparent tail, but bore two massive fangs protruding from its mouth. The creature looked like something that shouldn’t exist anymore, something you’d see in the Smithsonian, but here it was alive and in the flesh and wandering the woods of eastern Tennessee. 

The thing paused in our full view for a minute and looked at us, and our blood ran cold. After a brief stare-down, it turned and continued on its way, placing itself between us and whatever the thing on two legs ahead of us was. 

“Let’s get the fuck out of here,” Isaac said. He quickly abandoned his plans to go forwards and turned us around back down the trail. We marched quickly and silently the way we came. 

For a brief second, we heard the thing on two legs crashing down the trail back towards us, but then we heard a wail, like a woman being murdered, that made our blood run cold. We spilled over each other running back out of the woods. 

We must have run for thirty minutes without pausing or looking back when we erupted out of the treeline, all screaming “Mom! Mom!” We found our parents worried sick. Dad was talking to a park ranger while mom combed the treeline. She saw us and came running. 

“Thank god you’re okay!” She exclaimed. “We were worried sick about you. It’s been almost two hours!”

“There was a monster in the woods, mom!” I said. 

“Two monsters!” Isaac corrected me. 

“Alex!” Somebody called in the trees nearby. We both turned to watch, and mom drew a sharp breath. 

“Kids,” she said, “did you see anyone else in the woods while you were in there?”

“There… there was someone on the trail ahead of us. We didn’t see it though.”

“It?” Mom asked. 

“We… thought it was a sasquatch,” Noah admitted, sheepishly. 

Mom’s face soured. “Kids, there’s another little boy missing in the woods. Someone said they saw a man carry him off. We thought he had gotten you too.”

That little boy who went missing in Smoky Mountains National Park that day never was found. An eyewitness claimed he saw a man with long white hair approach him, take him by the hand, and lead him off into the forest. The worst things in the woods walk on two legs, and with the hindsight that I now have almost two decades later, I know in my heart that if it weren’t for that cat we encountered in the woods that day, Two Legs would have gotten us too.
