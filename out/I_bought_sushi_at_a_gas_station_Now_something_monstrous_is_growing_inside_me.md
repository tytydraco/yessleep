As I looked into the mirror, tiny black worms seemed to swarm and wriggle behind my pupils. I could barely see the shape of these alien creatures, but their movement was definitely discernible, even far back in my eyeball.

“Ah!” I screamed, grabbing at my face. The flickering fluorescent lights of the mall bathroom strobed through my fingers. Then I felt it: something deep in my guts, thrashing. I doubled over in pain for a moment before collapsing onto the disgustingly dirty marble floors while yelling at the top of my lungs. My vision started to turn gray. I saw my shirt start to bow outwards as *something* ripped its way out of my belly. There was a burning pain as a slimy black worm, as thin as a pencil but many feet long, ripped through my skin and the fabric of my T-shirt. Its body was covered in gore and blood. Warm streams began to soak into my white shirt and run down my belly and chest from the wound. I lay there, staring in horror at the alien abomination as it turned its miniature face to look back at me.

Little black eyes stood on stalks, coming off the top of its head. Its mouth opened with a hiss, its lamprey-like mouth showing hundreds of tiny, spike-like teeth as it stood straight up in the air, part of it still inside my belly, looking like a tiny cobra coming out of a basket controlled by an invisible snake charmer. Except instead of a basket, it was my *body.*

I screamed and screamed as I passed out, hearing footsteps running towards me from other parts of the mall before my vision turned black.

\*\*\*

Earlier that day, I had hiked the highest mountain in the state, taking in the endless forests that extended to every horizon and breathing in the fresh spring air. Everything felt just perfect. The endorphins from the intense hiking gave me a sense of inner peace, and I breathed in deep, smelling the flowers and pine trees all around me as the last traces of winter faded under the hopeful warmth of the spring sun. My girlfriend stood next to me on top of the mountain, her blonde hair flowing in the soft breeze.

“This was a good idea,” I said to her, smiling. She nodded.

“It always is, Alex. I love this place,” Anastasia said in her barely discernible Russian accent. “Ever since I moved to the USA as a kid, this has been one of my favorite spots. My family used to come up here to camp all the time.” I looked at my watch, and signaled that it was time to start heading back. We left the fire watchtower, slowly descending the steep steps, and returned to the main trail. The sun had started to descend into twilight.

As we neared the parking lot, I saw something up ahead on the trail that hadn’t been there on our way up. At first, I had no idea what I was looking at, until Anastasia started to shriek, her hands on her cheeks as she looked ahead in horror. Her blue eyes were wide and staring. I looked from her to the pile of red on the trail, uncomprehending. And yet as I inched closer, understanding started to come to me.

It was a body. A human body. It looked like it had been ripped apart from the inside. The face was still intact, and I recognized that it was an old Asian woman. Her eyes were looking up blankly at the dying light of the sky. Her belly and chest, though, were totally unrecognizable. The organs had all been eaten away, and now the only thing remaining was a pulpy, bloody mess. The ribs stood straight up, as if something in the center of her body had eaten what it wanted and then, when it decided it felt full, simply pushed its way out of her solar plexus, ripping open the muscle, tendons and skin on its way out.

“What the fuck?” I said. Anastasia still stood behind me, hyperventilating and yelling in incomprehensible gasps. “Anastasia, call the police!” In my panic, I had forgotten that we had no cell service all the way out here. This state park was at least a six mile drive in through dirt roads, and cell phone service only reached the very outer perimeter of the park, not all the way up here in the mountains. Anastasia tried anyway, but rapidly shook her head when she saw the lack of bars.

“OK, OK,” I said, trying to calm myself, “just think.” I backed away from the pile of gore on the trail, hugging Anastasia. She cried into my shoulder.

“We need to get back to the car,” I said, trying to sound much more confident than I actually felt. “We need to drive out of here as fast as we can and call the police.” Then another thought came to me- what if whatever had done that to this poor woman was still here? I pushed Anastasia back away from my shoulder and looked around suspiciously. Suddenly, I felt watched.

“I think we need to go, *now*,” I whispered to Anastasia. My tone seemed to sober her up. Nodding, we clasped hands and began walking towards the car, going around the body and trying not to look at it. I heard rustling and furtive slithering behind me as we left, but I never turned around to look. I didn’t want to see what was there.

Once we were in the dirt parking lot, I saw my little blue sedan was the only car still left in the park at this hour. I felt a lot better now that we were out of the forest. Anastasia looked a lot better, too. She heaved a deep sigh as I unlocked the car and we both got in. I put on my seatbelt, and Anastasia looked over at me from the passenger seat.

“What do you think that was back there?” she asked. I shrugged.

“Baby, I have no idea,” I said. “I’m just glad we’re out of that place. I have been hiking my entire life, and I have never seen *anything* like that.” I had seen some animal bodies and gore, of course, such as a doe with its throat ripped out on the side of a trail, or the random leg of a buck on the train tracks. Where the rest of its body had gone, I had no idea. I had never figured it out. Maybe the passing train had just sliced off its leg and pushed the rest of the body forward towards a bridge with deep water running underneath further down the tracks, but it had seemed very weird to me at the time.

Nothing compared to that old woman, though. Just thinking about it sent chills up my spine. Shuddering, I instinctively reached into my center console and pulled out a bottle of papaya supplement. The pills from this tropical fruit were not only delicious, but they really helped my stomach issues. I used to have constant constipation and bloating, and a naturopath had recommended taking chewable papaya supplements dozens of times throughout the day. I had tried it, and it had worked wonders. Now I eat them every chance I get and barely had any gastrointestinal issues since I started. Putting the small bottle of pills in my pocket, I started the car and we drove off down the dirt road.

Once we were at the edge of the park, Anastasia called the police on her cell phone, telling the dispatcher everything we had seen. The dispatcher took down our names and phone numbers, in case they needed to ask us any more questions, before proceeding to assure us that both park rangers and police officers were on their way to the body.

Already, the shock was wearing off, and I realized I was ravenously hungry. There were no fast-food places this far out in the middle of the mountains, but there was a gas station. Anastasia and I stopped at it, my stomach grumbling. I took a couple more papaya pills before we entered the building.

We walked around, looking at all the junk food and sodas lining each shelf of the place. Anastasia walked over to the open cooler.

“Oh, look, they have sushi!” she said excitedly. I looked down at the plastic-wrapped container, rolled-up balls of white rice and fish surrounded by a thin, black covering. We each grabbed one before getting some Gatorades and returning to the car.

I was hungrier than I had been in a long time. Hiking up steep hills for hours on an empty stomach wasn’t conducive to a clear mind. Opening up the container, I sniffed at the sushi suspiciously. It smelled totally fine. I opened up the soy sauce and began to dip each piece in it, eating the entire tray within a couple minutes, then chugging two Gatorades to finish it off. I felt so much better, and I could tell Anastasia did too.

“That was actually pretty good for gas station food,” Anastasia said, looking over at me. I nodded. “I think that must have been trout.”

“I have absolutely no idea,” I admitted, starting the car. We still had a while to go to get back to the city where we shared an apartment, and Anastasia wanted to stop at the mall on the way before it closed and look for some new books and clothes. I put on an audiobook. We always listened to the same audiobook on long roadtrips, and right now we were listening to “Rainbow Six” by Tom Clancy. Anastasia shook her head in disgust at the evil characters in the book.

“Who would create a virus just to kill nearly everyone on the Earth?” she said, scowling. I shrugged.

“Terrorists, I guess,” I said. “There will always be evil people out there. You have no idea what they’re capable of.”

We reached the mall twenty minutes later. The parking lot was nearly empty, which was expected for this time of night. It was closing in an hour, and most of the people had already done their shopping and returned home long ago.

My stomach was doing flips, and I groaned. I could tell Anastasia wasn’t feeling too good either.

“I think something is wrong with my stomach,” I said, grabbing it and bending over slightly to try to relieve the cramping. “I wonder if that sushi was bad or something.” I grabbed the bottle of papaya pills and popped a couple more. They always seemed to help when my stomach hurt or when I had gas or constipation. I offered them to Anastasia, but she shook her head at me.

“I don’t take pills, ever,” she said. “Unless they’re prescribed by a doctor. I think you pop too many of those things. How do you know they won’t make you sick?” I shrugged.

“Suit yourself,” I said. “But these are just fruit enzymes and healthy chemicals. I can’t imagine how they would possibly hurt you.”

“Even vitamins can hurt you if you take too many,” she responded. “I’ve heard of people dying from taking too much vitamin A or other supplements.” Anastasia straightened her back, sighing. “I think the feeling is passing. My stomach feels slightly better. Let’s go and do this before the stores all close.”

We walked into the mall, the smell of perfumes and pretzels and air conditioning mixing into that characteristic mall smell, and immediately headed towards the bookstore. I wanted to grab some new books to read, maybe some HP Lovecraft or Stephen King that I hadn’t read yet, but as soon as we got to the entrance of the bookstore, Anastasia began to double over in pain.

“Oh God,” she said, “I *really* don’t feel good now.” I grabbed her hand and began to drag her towards the bathrooms. Her face was covered in a sheen of sweat, her eyes wide and staring into the distance. She looked like she barely knew where she was. And as we reached the middle of the bathroom hallway, she grew much, much worse.

She bent over and spewed a fountain of blood onto the marble floors. More blood began to roll down her face from her eyes, crimson tears that smeared her mascara and make-up. Her mouth was opened in a horrified silent scream, and then she collapsed onto the floor, seizing and kicking wildly, her eyes shooting open and then half-closing with each spasm that rocked her body.

“Anastasia!” I screamed. I pulled my phone out of my pocket and called 911. As soon as the dispatcher answered, I began to yell into the phone. “We need help at \[REDACTED\] mall immediately, in the bathroom hallway next to the bookstore. My girlfriend, she’s sick. She’s throwing up blood and she’s having a seizure and I think she might be dying! Please hurry!” Then my stomach began to tighten and twist, and I ran to the bathroom, dropping my phone on the way. I was worried about Anastasia, but I needed to use the bathroom *now*. And there was realistically nothing I could do for her anyway. I didn’t have any medical training. I didn’t even know CPR. All I could do was hope the ambulance and paramedics arrived fast.

I ran into the bathroom, flinging open the stall and sitting down on the toilet. A rush of blood flowed out of me. In horror, I stared into the water of the toilet, which was now covered with pink, foamy, bloody stool. I felt like I would throw up, but I managed to keep it down. I cleaned myself up and hurriedly went to the sink to wash my hands, so that I could get back out and stay with Anastasia while waiting for the ambulance to arrive.

But as I looked up in the mirror, I saw something moving behind my eyeballs. They looked like little worms…

\*\*\*

I woke up in the hospital an indeterminate time later. I didn’t know if a couple hours had passed or a couple months. I had no time reference and was totally confused. Then a rush of horrifying memories came flooding back to me. I shot up in bed, looking around frantically.

A man in a black suit with black sunglasses sat in the chair next to my bed, playing on his smartphone. As he saw me sit up, he looked up from his phone.

“Oh, good, you’re awake,” he said in a deep voice, his face deadpan and emotionless.

“What…” I began, but he waved his hand at my protesting word, shooing it away like a fly.

“I’m Agent Bowman,” he said. Looking at the reflection of his dark sunglasses, I almost felt like I was looking at a mannequin.

“An agent from where?” I asked. He shook his head.

“Nowhere you have ever heard of, that’s for sure. I’m from a classified agency unknown to the general public. We deal with little issues like you and your girlfriend had at the mall…”

“My girlfriend! Is she alive?” I asked, hopeful. He put his head down.

“Look, I’m sorry to be the one to tell you, but…” That was all the answer I needed. I put my face in my hands and started crying hysterically. He got up, putting a hand on my shoulder. “Listen, Alex, even you are lucky to be alive. You have been in an induced coma for the past week. They have been giving you extremely high doses of anti-parasitic agents intravenously. You had to have three surgeries to get all those *things* out of you. And even then, the doctors weren’t hopeful. But you pulled through.” He pulled out the bottle of papaya pills I kept in my car from a briefcase at his feet. They were in a plastic bag marked “Evidence”.

“My pills!” I exclaimed. He nodded.

“These are the only reason you’re still alive,” he said. “Whatever those things were, apparently the enzymes and chemicals in papaya are deadly to them. You were taking such high doses that you apparently were able to slow down their growth long enough for us to get you the medical treatment necessary to save you. But your girlfriend never took these pills. She had passed away by the time the ambulance arrived. And apparently those things had all crawled out of her, moving off in every direction. We have quarantined the mall and the surrounding area, and my agency is hopeful we can get all of them.”

“And what if you don’t?” I asked, a creeping sensation of dread rising up my back. He simply shook his head, refusing to answer the question.

“OK, but what were they?” I continued, looking up at him, tears still drying on my face. He shrugged.

“Nothing we have ever seen before, that’s for sure,” he said. “We captured some of the smaller ones and sequenced their DNA. They’re totally unrelated to any known parasite or worm on Earth. We don’t know where they came from, to be totally honest. Maybe they were bioengineered by some terrorist group, maybe they fell down from outer space and someone found the eggs and decided to contaminate some local foods with them. We are putting every agent at our disposal towards tracking down those answers.” I looked at the bag with the papaya pills in them, still in shock from the news.

The supplements I took had saved my life.
