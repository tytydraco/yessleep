If you drive long enough through the Sonoran Desert, you’ll find a town like Saguaro Point. The word “town” is generous - it’s no more than clusters of homes nestled on the ridges of canyon rock, broken up by copses of dry bush trees and dirt roads. An oasis among a wide expanse of tan and beige nothingness. Home to truck drivers, ranchers, and retired snowbirds, we existed in our own, isolated bubble. 

I knew early on that something in my soul was hungry. Hungry for more than the end of the world, population 1,000. I would scroll for hours on my dad’s computer, staring longingly at photos of other places that felt as far away as planets. I wanted to watch the rain pour outside my London flat with a cat on my lap. To open a bookstore in the rural hillsides of Tuscany, scuba dive in the crystal clear waters of Hawaii, or hike through the dense bamboo forests of Kyoto. 

But it was just my dad and me, and these kinds of dreams required money. Since Mom had blown our savings on drugs, we didn’t have much to scrape together. Even still, Dad promised that with his new job, he’d take me all across the globe. We’d start a scrapbook together and document our travels. I could line the shelf above my bed with tacky souvenirs and snow globes, brag about them during sleepovers. We’d start small, then work our way from there. I’d never been more excited for anything in my life.

When I told my boyfriend Paul this story, I hesitated. This was early in our relationship. We’d lain on the bed of his truck, staring at the stars and swapping stories. Paul had just moved to Saguaro that year, and when you live in a town where everyone knows everything, you crave that look of naivety. It’s like you can pretend the story had a happy ending. But this one didn’t. When he realized I wasn’t going to continue, Paul laughed with confusion. 

“So did you go?” He asked.

I fixed my eyes on a constellation. A traitorous tear slid down my cheek. Paul understood. He pulled me closer, letting me rest inside the safety of his warmth. He’s always been so good at that - reading people and knowing what they need. It was that night I started to fall in love with him, under the stars in a sky so wide I feared it’d swallow me whole. In his arms, I felt grounded. Our lonely desert town felt less lonely.

On our next date, I decided it was time for him to meet my father. Cat out of the bag, as they say. When we pulled up to my house, my hands were trembling like crazy. “Remember that story I told you?” I began. “The one I never finished?”

Paul nodded. I turned off the car with a sigh, trying to collect my composure. I meet his gaze, his honey-brown eyes sparkling just as bright as the stars that night he stole my heart. “Let’s keep that to ourselves, okay?” My request seemed odd in the moment, but he nodded once more. 

Hand in hand, we made our way inside the house. I hung his jacket by the door and sat him on our sofa. “I’ll be right back.” 

Ten minutes later, the knot in my throat felt large enough to suffocate me. Dad put his hand on my arm, sensing my nerves. 

“You worry too much, Daisy girl.” He said. “Besides, he should be the nervous one. I have high standards for my daughter.”

I laugh softly. “Go easy on him, okay?”

“No promises.” He winks. With that, I take a deep breath and wheel him around the corner.

I watched Paul rise immediately, ready to shake my father’s hand. His eyes dropped to the wheelchair. If there was any shock he was feeling, he hid it exceptionally well. He adjusted his hand and approached my Dad, shaking it firmly. “It’s great to finally meet you, Mr. Dean.” 

“Likewise,” Dad grinned. “Now I hear you have a great enchilada recipe. Is that right?”

Paul beamed. “Yes, it’s my mother’s. She may kill me if she knew I was sharing our family secrets, but it’s worth the risk.”

That earned a laugh. “Well, I can’t wait to try it.”

That night was one of the best I’ve ever had. I positioned Dad in his favorite spot on the couch, close enough that he could watch everything as Paul and I got to work cooking. My nerves had dissolved as we joked, ate, and enjoyed each other’s company. Not too long after, Paul would become a permanent fixture of my world.

The hunger in my soul subsided with each passing day, week, and month. I met Paul’s parents and siblings. We hung out together for game nights and barbecues, and none of them made my father feel small for his disability. Paul moved in to help me care for him, something I feared he felt burdened by. “There’s nowhere else I'd rather be.” He had said, and I realized how much I felt the same.

Saguaro Point may be nothing more than a blip outside the window during a road trip, or a place to stop to fill up on gas. It may not be Paris, Italy, or some Caribbean Island. But with Paul and my Dad, I had the whole world within arm’s reach. 

And tonight, I’d lose them both.

…

That day had stretched on long and hot. 108 degrees on a Tuesday in August, I was where I always was - manning the counter of Agave Roast. We were the only coffee shop for miles, and today was uncharacteristically slow. I took up the chores that required my full focus, scrubbing the espresso machines and dusting the counters. 

My coworker and friend Reese tapped my shoulder. She had her car keys in one hand, a lighter in the other, with a cigarette poised and ready between her teeth. I told her she could go home early. No point in both of us being here. “Text if you need me, kay?” She chirped. 

“Will do. Have a good night, Reese.”

With my back turned to the door, I continued to clean, lost in my thoughts. Minutes later, the bell chimes again. I set my rag down and turn to find a man across the counter, observing me. 

“Hi, Daisy.” He grins. The hairs on my arms stand on end. Mayor Ramsey gives me a once-over, his coal black eyes piercing from under the rim of his ten-gallon hat. “Been a while.”

I fight the urge to recoil. “Is there anything I can get for you, Mayor?”

He puts his hands up playfully. “Hey, now. I don’t mean any harm. Just trying to make conversation.”

I used to think that was true.

My eyes flit to the door, praying someone else would come in. Until then, the only way out was through. So I hugged the back wall, pretending I didn’t feel like a rabbit cornered by a wolf.

“You came out here just to make conversation?”

He laughed, as though I was being absurd. “Of course! Ever since you got this stint here, it feels like I barely see you anymore. Hard to do in such a small town.”

*Cause I’m avoiding you, dick.* I thought. Instead, I give a forced grin. “I’ve been busy. 'Sure you understand.”

“That I do. You know how much paperwork comes across my desk.” He sighs. “It’s not the same without you, Daisy. I keep telling the misses you were the best damn secretary we ever had.”

“Sorry to disappoint.”

He locks his eyes with mine before fixing his slouch. “What’s the thing to get here? I trust you have the inside scoop.”

Finally. I can do my job and get him out of here. “Well, our cappuccinos are very popular. We also have tea if you aren’t in the mood for coffee.”

He thinks it over. “A tea sounds mighty nice. Perhaps an Earl Grey.”

I jump to it with a quickness. I’ve only just prepared the tea press before he moves on to another topic. “How’s your pa?”

“Good,” I reply flatly.

“Heard he’s due for some spinal surgery soon. Hope that goes well.”

“Me too.”

“And this job here will help you afford that?”

“Yup.”

He tsks. “I can’t imagine they’re paying you better than I did.”

“Uh huh.”

Mayor Ramsey laughs, then pretends to shiver. “You’re cold as ice today! I’m only pulling your leg, no harm by it.”

I decide his tea has steeped long enough and pour the hot liquid into the cup. I slap the lid on and plant it in front of him. “$4.50.”

He reaches for his wallet in his back pocket. He hands me a twenty-dollar bill, and I go to take it. With his other hand, he snatches my wrist and tightens, fast as a cobra. I freeze as he leans in closer, enough to smell the bourbon on his breath. “Keep the change, dear.” He tucks some hair behind my ear, lingering on the curves of my face. “And remember, you’re always welcome back at my office.”

He leaves, not bothering to take his tea. I watch his pickup drive by the window before I hurl the liquid across the store.

I entertain the idea of leaving early, but Mayor Ramsey was right. A supervisor at a coffee shop doesn’t pay much. Between Paul and I’s income and Dad’s benefits, we barely have enough. Just enough today could change tomorrow, and I never like leaving things down to the penny. So I mop up the tea and finish my shift just as the world fades into a golden glow.

The three-minute trek to my car leaves me sweaty and red-faced. Never mind the hour of day - the weather won’t break the high 90s. The AC is a welcome reprieve, and I let it wash over me as I dial Paul. He’s the only thing that can lighten my mood.

I ring him twice, but both lead to voicemail. I try not to get too disappointed - we’ll see each other soon enough. Plus, he’s finally getting over that strange nausea he’d been feeling all weekend. In the mornings, he was fine, but at night, he’d fall into a strange malaise, complaining of headaches and night sweats. Dad got it too, and we reckoned it was a bug. I’ll probably find them both at home, napping on the sofa or watching a game.

A few minutes into the drive, I stop behind a dusty sedan and drum my fingers impatiently along the wheel. I fiddle with the radio to fill the silence, but all I get is static. Annoyed, I watch the light turn green, but the sedan isn’t moving. I honk.

I narrow my eyes and find the driver stiff as a board, unmoving. I’m about to honk again when he pushes the door wide open and steps out. I recognize him from the grocer, the one who sweeps the floors. He can’t be much older than my dad, but his face is gaunt with fear. He stares ahead, terrified but still as stone, as if swept up in a trance. I roll down the window and poke my head out.

“Hello? Sir?”

He doesn’t acknowledge. After a few seconds, he snaps his head to the left and walks off with a quickened pace. I sit dumbfounded, staring at the abandoned car left in park as the light turns red.

A million scenarios run through my head. I know better than to go off alone at sundown, but I can’t ignore how afraid he seemed. What if he’s having an episode, or some kind of crisis? I pull off into the dirt shoulder by the road and grab the pistol from my glovebox. At least I’ll have protection.

Using my phone as a flashlight, I cross the street and follow the man into the green. We’re just before Main Street, which is flanked by brittlebush and the low-to-the-ground trees of the desert wash. In fleeting sunlight, I lose the man repeatedly. I race forward when I finally spot him, only to lose him again. “Sir! It’s not safe out here! Please, follow my voice!”

Branches snap up ahead. I point the light onto the back of his flannelled shirt just as he walks through another bramble. Dread coils in my ribcage, but I press on, guided by an ill-advised moral compass. I push through thorns and enter a clearing, finding myself alone. I spin in a circle, with nothing but the crickets in my company. Where the hell did he go?

“Where are you? Do you need help?” 

My voice echoes. A shiver crawls down my spine despite the heat. Whatever courage led me here is fading fast. I rest my hand above the gun while I dial the police with the other. “Look, I’m calling the police, okay? I’m going to get you help.”

I punch in the digits and freeze. The crickets have gone quiet. I inch my fingers to the gun when a shrill, splitting cry erupts from above. A small, dark mass quickly descends upon me. I stumble as the skin of my cheek splits open, dropping the phone to the dirt. I can barely make out the wings of a predator bird, swooping above me in slow circles. It bellows another cry as I hold out the gun, hoping it scares it off. It doesn't. It seems to agitate it, swerving toward my neck faster than I can blink. I narrowly avoid talons to the throat as I snatch my phone and beeline towards the road. Maybe it was stupid to come out here, but I’m not stupid enough to think I have a chance of shooting it out of the sky.

I find my car where I left it, illuminated by the sedan’s lowbeams. Throwing myself into the seat, my phone vibrates.

“Paul, thank Christ. I-”

“Daisy?”

My brows knit. “Lori?”

Paul’s mother. Her tone, normally smooth and comforting, sounds tense. “I was calling to see if you’ve heard from Paul.”

“N-no. He should be at home with my dad.”

I could hear Lori pace across the linoleum floors of her kitchen. She went to say something, then changed her mind. “Daisy, where are you?”

“Off Garner Road. There was this guy who just-”

“Hold on, sweetheart,” Lori said. There was the sound of knocks banging on the front door. The door opens, and a woman’s voice is muffled. What I can make out is the unmistakable sound of sobs.

“Mrs. Peters…” Lori begins. “No, I haven’t…You said gone?... What…Okay, slow down. He can’t have gone far…We’ll look for him, just…” 

She trails off and shuts the door. 

“Lori, what’s wrong?”

The dread has spread throughout my body, seizing every nerve and cell. I’ve already started the car when she finally replies. “Daisy, I need you to head on home. Try to get in touch with your dad or Paul. I’ll get the kids and meet you there shortly.”

I swallow, my throat dry. “What’s happening? Are they okay?”

“I don’t know, honey.” Her voice cracks. It’s all I can do not to floor it to my house. 

The drive back is ghastly. The closer I make it to town, the more abandoned vehicles line the roads at random stops. They all have their doors wide open, just like the man I saw before.

As I near Sagauro’s residential area, I see women wandering by themselves or with their kids, calling out names with desperation.

“Ben?!” “Rodrigo?!” “Wallie, where are you?!”

I have to stop once I reach my neighborhood. The outcroppings of homes along the dirt roads are swarming with women, children, and pets. The front doors to many houses stand open. In front of me, a frail old lady hugs the cat on her lap as she sits on her front doorstep, while a boy grips his sister’s hand, who is crying inconsolably. I have no choice but to park the car. When I exit, a woman to my right is fuming, angry, and confused. 

“I can’t reach the police!” She cries to no one at all. “Why the fuck aren’t they answering?”

My fear ignites, and I take off running. With each house I pass, each open door I see, I force myself to go faster. My brain doesn’t understand what’s happening, but my heart has caught on to something terrible. My feet slap against the pavement hard and fast as I round the street into my cul-de-sac. I can see Lori with her kids on the lawn, waiting for me. I lock eyes with the kids, who look to me with hope. The hope dissolves when they realize I’m alone.

That confirms it. Paul isn’t here. And if Paul isn’t here, then Dad is…

Lori rises to her feet and calls my name, but my head is spinning so fast. Round and round like a carousel. My door is open like the rest of them, but I rush in anyway, scouring the house.

“Dad!!” I check every room and every hall. I don’t stop until I crash into Lori, who keeps me upright in her arms.

“Daisy, honey, he’s not here.” She says, a tear sliding down her cheek. I stare ahead and feel the ground sink under my feet. 

In the shadows by the door, right where I missed it, is an empty wheelchair.

I know within my soul that neither Paul nor my father is coming home. And as Lori would soon tell me, they’re not the only ones.

The day melts into night, and all the men in Saguaro Point are gone.
