Everybody dreams to visit the United States; for education, for travelling, for immigration, etc. However, remember my advice: do not, under any circumstances visit the US! It is nothing like you think!

I first entered the United States at age 18, looking for higher education. My time at the airport was rather boring, however I will never forget what happened to the man who got rejected at the checkpoint: he was taken away and beaten, then I could hear machinery in the room he was taken into. I later realized what it was.

When I entered Los Angeles, everything was drastically different. I was livid, nothing like you would imagine; burning buildings, cars crashing into each other, government robots trying to maintain order. It was chaos, but I was told to ignore it at all costs.

When I entered Downtown LA, it was nothing like I has imagined. Tall, dystopian buildings with signs all over them. The signs said phrases like "OBEY", "COMPLY", "BUY". It was a nightmare. Everybody on the street was weird and acted unusual. It was like they were string puppets controlled by a force; its as if they didn't have any souls. While walking down the street, I peeked into a school classroom in session; the students were wearing a really weird and eerie headset, and the teacher was handing them medication. It was horrible. 

It, however wasn't as terrible as when I saw the government bui- I'm sorry, the overseer headquarters. Everything was a lie. The US wasn't a normal place; far from it, in fact. It was eerie and scary, it was unusually high and looked very dystopian. I saw the same signs there as I did in the Downtown.

When I got to my hotel, everything appeared normal, which was when I finally calmed down a bit. The receptionist gave me the key to a room; it wasn't unusual, however it looked cozy and comfortable, however imagine my shock when I sat down; it was as if I sat down on human skin. After inspecting it, the bed sheets turned out to be made of human skin. I was disgusted. I slept on the floor that night.

I turned on the TV in my hotel room. FOX News was broadcasting a Supreme Court session. All of the presiding judges were dressed in black robes and the judge wore a large coat which covered their face. The court started with some kind of  satanic ritual and the trial began shortly after that. No one listened to the defendant, and the jury brought their verdict. Despite the defendant's valid arguments, the judge sentenced the defendant to death, and took out a large axe. I couldn't believe what happened next; they went up to the defendant and chopped them up on site, with the judge saying 'in the name of the Overseer'.

I couldn't stay here anymore. I immediately took out my phone and began trying to book my flight back to Europe; however, all the destinations were going towards 'HELL'. I couldn't bear staying here anymore, I had to get out. I tried to find any normal person I could, but to no avail; everything was messed up in this place. 

I went out into the streets with any supplies I had and went for the border with Mexico. On my way, I was stopped by a LAPD officer. The car was insanely fast for how old it was, I think it was a 1980's Chevy. The officer asked me for my documentation, and stared into my soul. It was uncomfortable, so I just showed him my ID. I was asked for a 'life license'. I froze in shock: why do you need a license to live?! Thankfully, he asked if this was my first time, I said yes. He let me go off with a warning and told me to get a license at the City Hall.

Part 2 coming soon.
