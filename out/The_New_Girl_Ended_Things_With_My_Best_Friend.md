Fifth period had just begun and Mr. Burns was loading up his PowerPoint. You know those fantastic teachers who clearly love their subjects and can make any topic exciting just by the passion of which they taught it? Well, Mr. Burns wasn’t that. He was clearly depressed and educated with absolutely no enthusiasm. His wife (rumored to be his third) was currently divorcing him and that had brought his energy down to what had to have been the negatives. Yes, with Mr. Burns the stereotype of history being the most boring class in school was alive and well. 

That’s why I felt way more excitement than I should have when the door opened and a student I’d never seen before walked in. She had brown hair tied in a ponytail, appeared a bit taller than average, and wore a tiny smile that she seemed to be trying way too hard to maintain. 

I turned to my best friend, John and swore to myself. John was looking at the new girl with a look I’d seen all too often; the “I’ve finally found the girl of my dreams” look. John was a great guy. He was loyal, funny, and creative. I think any girl would’ve been lucky to have him. Unfortunately, he lacked any real confidence when it came to talking to women and, although he wasn’t aware, had become known as the guy who would date anyone if given the chance. That wasn’t necessarily his fault. I think he truly wanted to form a special connection with the right girl and get to know her properly, but from the perspective of others, it looked like he just wanted a girlfriend and didn’t actually care about who they were as people. He asked out whoever he was attracted to before bothering to get to know them because, according to him, becoming pals with the girl first would permanently land him in the friend zone. I gave it about a week before John asked out whoever this new girl was. 

And whoever this new girl was was answered a few seconds later when she addressed Mr. Burns, “I’m Kimberly. I’m scheduled in this class.” 

“Huh?” Mr. Burns looked up from his laptop. I’m pretty sure he was the only one who hadn’t noticed Kimberly enter the classroom. “Oh, yes. Find a seat.”

Kimberly mouthed “okay” to herself, her eyes flashing rather undignified by Mr. Burns’ unfriendly welcome and surveyed the classroom, deciding between the few empty seats. I turned to the sound of scraping metal on the floor and I turned to see that John had not so subtly nudged out the empty chair next to him. I loved him so much and I wanted to smack the back of his head. But to my shock, Kimberly appeared to have taken notice and headed towards our section, seating herself next to John. Point to him, I guess. 

Unfortunately, the show of the newcomer’s grand entrance was now over and Mr. Burns proceeded to give a lesson so boring that I wished myself dead along with the Mesopotamians he rambled on about. 

Following History, John and I went our separate ways due to having different schedules. I headed to math and he made his way to biology. John and I weren’t neighbors but we DID live close to one another so we would meet up after that final period like we always did to make our way to the city bus stop. 

However, John never met me after class. I walked to the edge of the school to see if he was waiting for me there, but no. And he never showed up to the bus stop either. I called and texted his cell phone but didn’t get an answer. I rode home by myself for the first time since I could remember, and then walked to my house alone, which actually kind of sucked. I wasn’t worried about my safety. I was a pretty tall guy and I played basketball so I was in decent shape, but I never realized how much faster the journey home was when I had a friend. 

I went inside the house and pulled out my phone to see if John had gotten back to me yet but the only message I had was from my sister who said she’d be working late tonight and to redeem her code for a free pizza she had unlocked at Domino's. I ordered the pizza, did a quick workout, read a book, and then got started on my homework. 

It was about nine o’clock when my phone rang and I saw it was John calling. I picked it up, determined to not sound too irritated. I failed immediately. “Hi there. What the fuck?”

“I know,” John answered back. “I’m sorry! I caught the wrong bus. I actually thought YOU had ditched ME.” He laughed. “I only realized after I looked down and saw it was an hour later than we normally get on.”

“So what happened?” I asked, my anger fading. “Were auditions today?”
“You’re not gonna believe this!” John exclaimed. I could tell already that he hadn’t actually called to apologize and really wanted to talk about whatever he was about to tell me. “You know that new girl, Kimberly? Well, she was in biology with me and we sat next to each other and got partnered up for one of Ms. Frederick’s Quick Quizzes and she’s actually really cool and we hung out a bit after class!” 

I knew this was a big deal for John and didn’t see any reason to discourage his happiness so I let him go on for another few minutes about Kimberly’s fun and dark sense of humor, her intelligence, her perfume, and about how she’d shut up Brandon Timbers, the idiot jackass in our grade when he came looking to perform some bullshit. 

“Yeah,” John went on. “Brandon was passing our table and started making those jokes he does about, y’know, my presentation incident last semester, and Kimberly just calmly stands up, locks eyes with him and all of a sudden, he just goes back to his seat and stays there in silence for the rest of class. I was next to her so I didn’t see exactly what she looked like but there must’ve been literal fire in her eyes because I didn’t know Brandon was capable of fucking off!” 

I had to admit, that was impressive. Nobody took Brandon seriously but he was still a major pain in the ass. A few weeks ago, I’d punched him in the arm after he’d made a comment about my sister. I didn’t hold back and knew it must’ve hurt but he was back on his nonsense just a few minutes later. If physical violence didn’t solve the Brandon problem, I was intrigued by the force of a simple look from the new girl. 

“So did you ask her out already?” I questioned John, only partially joking. 

“Actually no,” John replied and clearly he was surprised by that too because he continued, “we were talking for so long and just hanging that I forgot. Believe me, I wanted to. She’s amazing! Obviously she came to school in the middle of the day today but the three of us actually share a few classes. She’s in ALL of MY classes!” 

“Well then try not to make things awkward for yourself,” I warned him. “Why not just try being friends for once; see where things go? The friendzone isn’t real, dude. Either she likes you or she doesn’t.” I heard the door of my house open. “Susie just got home so I’m gonna go hang with her. I’ll see you tomorrow. Glad you’re not dead. Don’t ditch me again tomorrow!”

“Yeah, I won’t. Sorry again,” John assured me. “Goodnight.” 

I hung up and went to catch up with my sister. 

I saw John in first period the next day and sure enough, Kimberly was there too. I approached them both. “Kimberley, right?” I asked her, as if I hadn’t spent a good chunk of the previous night hearing her name. 

“Right,” she responded. “And you’re Allen?” I was kinda flattered. I guess John had been telling her about me as well. 

“Yeah,” I continued the conversation. “John said you’re pretty great, and a little intimidating.” We both laughed (albeit awkwardly). 

“You’re talking about that guy in biology? Nah, I think he just didn’t know me well enough to start shit.” 

The three of us continued talking until class begun and John was right. I thought he may have been blinded by infatuation, but Kimberly was definitely cool. She was quick witted, shared a few of our interests and was really easy to be around. Over the next three weeks, Kimberly became our third member and school was better for it. Classes became much more fun due to Kimberley under the breath comments that only we could hear, and she was super smart and helpful with topics we didn’t quite understand; our own little Hermione Granger!

Kimberley also had some incredible stories to share, at least, she was a good enough storyteller where they all seemed to be. One day in the middle of what we thought was a fire drill, but turned out to be actual small fire, she found John and I on the field where we were stationed and helped pass the time by telling us the story of a student at her last school. Apparently the guy he’d asked out rejected him and the dude went total arsonist and burned down the art building because he knew it was his crush’s favorite subject. Kimberley had been in the kiln, putting in one of her sculptures, not realizing what was happening. I shamefully chuckled at this part because for all of Kimberley’s strengths, we’d learned she was quite lousy at art and I couldn’t help but imagine how weird that sculpture must’ve looked. Alas, no one would ever know because after Kimberley had managed to free herself from the flaming building, it had completely collapsed in on itself. As for the kid, he was never found. Everyone suspected that he ran into the fire to avoid consequences, but a body hadn’t been discovered. 

“And you didn’t see him while you were escaping?” John asked her. 

Kimberley shook her head. “If we crossed paths, I was too busy trying not to get burned alive to notice. Anyways, now you know how I ended up here! My parents were so worried that another kid would go insane that they packed up their life and brought us here. A bit of an overreaction, right?” 

“Well… I guess I’m kinda thankful for batshit guy,” John said. “Now we have a Kimberley in our group!” 

I was happy to have a new friend too, but I wanted to ask more questions. Kimberley wasn’t just a new student anymore. Now she was the girl who survived a traumatic fire and forced to flee to what ended up being our town. A member from the faculty came down to inform us that our own fire had been taken care of and that it was safe to return to class. I was about to ask Kimberley some more questions when all of a sudden, John lurched at her. She side stepped out of the way and John fell face first onto the ground. 

“Oh fuck,” I said and Kimberley and I went to help him up. John had landed on his nose and it was bleeding rather badly. “Are you okay?” 

John looked a bit embarrassed but smiled. “Yeah. New feet,” he chuckled. 

“Let’s get you to the nurse,” Kimberley suggested and John turned to me with a grin. He’d quite literally fallen into an amazing opportunity and was about to be heroically escorted by the sympathetic girl he hadn’t been able to stop thinking about. Of course, I announced that I had to get to my next class so the two of them could be alone. I’d ask about the fire another time. 

Kimberley found me after school and told me the nurse had sent John home, which seemed weird for something as simple as a bloody nose but apparently he’d gone and broke the damn thing. Now that I was alone with her, I figured I’d ask more questions, but nothing natural came to me. Every way that I thought of asking seemed too hostile and I didn’t wanna make Kimberley feel uncomfortable. She seemed to have a strong exterior but she was probably still processing the trauma of whatever happened. 

Instead, I got home and starting Googling, but I didn’t have much luck. I didn’t know what town Kimberley was originally from and just typing in “school fire” yielded too many results, even when sorting by “Past Month.” 

I went ahead and called John to check up on him. He seemed fine; even assured me that he’d been misdiagnosed and the nose wasn’t actually broken. “Got a day without Mr. Burns though!” he bragged. “Bet you’re jealous!” He wasn’t wrong. We continued to talk, mostly just shooting the shit, until I remembered that John probably knew the answer I needed. 

“When you were first hanging out with Kimberley, did she mention where she was from?” 

“Oh, yeah,” John was always thrilled to talk about her, and I think even happier to prove that he listened to her. “North Carolina; Winston-Salem. Why?” 

I told a partial truth. “Just wanted to learn more about that crazy guy she was telling us about earlier; the fire starter.” 

“Yeah, can you believe she went through that? Hope she’s okay.” John said with a mixture of affection and admiration. 

“Kimberley’s tough,” I promised. “I’m sure she’s just happy that life is getting normal again. That’s our job as friends.” He and I talked a little longer. I wanted to go as soon as I got the information, but that would’ve seemed suspicious and also a little rude. After another twenty minutes, I felt it was safe to announce that I had homework to do and we hung up. 

My attention now fully belonging to me, I jumped on my computer, opened Google News and typed in, “Winston-Salem North Carolina High School Fire” sorting by recent. A few results came up, all seeming to be about the same event. I started with the first one, read through and yup; kid named Patrick, yada yada yada, fire in the school’s art building… yada yada yada… body never recovered. 

I went on to the next article; Patrick… uh huh… asked out crush; rejected… uh huh… fire. 

Next article; courtship goes up in flames… right on… fire… body gone. 

All the articles said the same thing, but there was one thing NONE of them said. No mentions of Kimberley. I read over them again. I “control F’ed: ‘Kimberley.’” I went back to Google and typed in, “Winston-Salem North Carolina High School Fire Kimberley” and “Winston-Salem North Carolina High School Fire Survivor” and every other combination I could think of. The fire was real, but Kimberley didn’t seem to have been a part of it. Surely at least one news outlet would’ve loved to write about a girl who’d escaped a burning building by herself. Did Kimberley slip out without anyone noticing and then only tell her parents? Did she take a real story and add herself into it to entertain us? Or, and I felt borderline guilty for thinking this, was she involved in the fire some other way? 

I went back to Google News, abandoned any mention of fires and North Carolina and just typed in her name: “Kimberley Powel.” Nothing. I switched the tab to “Web” and found things, but nothing out of the ordinary. I found her Facebook page, an Instagram, a TikTok with no posts, and then basic stuff on government websites that really only said things like, “yeah, she exists, here’s a photo of her, she lives in Orlando, Florida and this is her birthday.” 

The biggest thing that stood out to me was that she was supposedly from Orlando, Florida and not North Carolina but I knew it was reasonable to assume information on these sites wouldn’t be completely up to date for an insignificant high schooler. I dropped the detective act for the night and went to help my sister cook dinner. 

It was just Kimberley and I at school the next day. John texted to let me know he had rough night’s sleep and that he’d told his parents he had a stomach bug, just so I had the right story to help him stick to. 

Kimberley and I ate lunch outside that day. I realize that I hadn’t found anything incriminating the previous night and I really thought I’d let it go, but since Kimberley and I were alone and I didn’t have to worry about John trying to hold onto her attention, I couldn’t help myself. I confronted Kimberley about the fire. I shouldn’t have because as I was going over all my questions and talking about all the research I had done, I realized how absolutely freakish I sounded; like a conspiracy theorists who’d suddenly been given a platform, and yet I couldn’t stop. I went on and on and on until there was nothing left to say. 

Kimberley was quiet for a moment, looked away to processed her friend going off the deep end, and then she turned back to me. For the briefest of moments, something was different; something I couldn’t pinpoint, as if she’d gone uncanny. It migh’ve been the eyes. Weren’t they blue…? Because in that moment, they were brown; a very light brown; almost… and then the lighting changed. A cloud covered the sun and I had it right the first time, her eyes were definitely blue and there was a very playful look in them. She started to laugh; a real laugh. 

“No, you’re right. I wasn’t in any fire. I read that story a few weeks ago and just inserted myself in to make things more exciting and to pass the time. I was about to come clean but then John had his fall. I’m from Orlando. My mom’s client needed her to live closer so we moved. Sorry, my humor’s a bit fucked up, but that’s why we’re friends, right?”

I didn’t see any reason not to believe her, and I was happy she was letting me off the hook for being such an idiot. “Okay, well just one more thing,” I dared to ask. “John told me you told him you WERE from North Carolina and that was way before you told us the story. You telling me you were always planning on telling us this fire story?”

“Is that weird?” She asked. “Don’t answer that. Yeah, it’s fucked up but I like telling stories and I like setting a scene to allow things to better fall into place. I don’t know if you know this but I currently have the highest grade in our English class. I’m very good at writing. Anyways, you heard anymore from John?” 

“Nah, I think he’s just sleeping.” I said and she nodded. 

“And it’s Friday,” Kimberley continued. “He gave himself a long weekend… he likes me, doesn’t he?” she stated, matter of factly. 

“Yeah,” I responded, caught off guard, “we both do.” I knew what she was saying but as John’s best friend, I instinctively led her away from the subject. It didn’t work at all. 

“No, like, he wants to kiss me,” she shot back with a laugh, but it wasn’t genuine. She sounded almost sorry. 

I felt my heart go heavy for my friend. “You don’t like him that way, do you?” I asked. 

Kimberley turned to me and her eyes reflected something unnerving. This wasn’t discomfort or sadness or pity. This was true and intense sorrow. “I really DO care about John, Allen. I want him to be okay.” The bell rang and Kimberley got up without saying another word. She was quiet for the rest of the day. After last period though, I caught up with her and asked if she wanted to come with me to check on John. She gave me a quiet smile and agreed. Hopefully this meant that despite her unmutual feelings for my friend, she was still interested in being in our lives. 

Things seemed to be back to normal. Kimberley and I joked and laughed on the way to the bus stop, on the bus and along the walk to John’s house. We knocked on John’s door. I was read to ask John’s mom how “his stomach was feeling,” but luckily, John himself opened the door. He looked delighted to see us and I’m sure his heart was bursting with joy to see Kimberley, but despite his smile he looked… well, rough is the nice way of putting it. His skin was pale, his eyes sunken and he looked as though he’d dropped a few pounds overnight. Then again, he was wearing relatively baggy pajamas. 

John invited us inside and gave us some chips to snack on. His parents, as it turned out, were out of town so he had the house to himself. I won’t bore you with the details (and because there’s no need to betray John’s privacy) but John’s mom and dad were both Politicians. Their absence was a common occurance. Needless to say, John invited us to stay as long as we wanted and since it was Friday night, we took him up on the offer. 

Noon turned to evening and evening turned to night. We ordered Chinese Food, roasted Mr. Burns, and I kicked the asses of Kimberley and John in Mario Kart. John then shared a few YouTube videos he’d found throughout his sick day. (He had a whole playlist titled, “Stupid Shit to Share With People.”) Finally, we all settled down and started to watch movies. I picked the first one, (“Ex Machina”) Kimberley picked the second one (“Before Sunrise”) and finally, John picked the third one, (“A Bug’s Life.”) 

I think I fell asleep as the Third Act of “Bug’s Life” began. I woke up on the couch a few hours later. I peered around and was about to get up but then I heard voices. Kimberley and John were talking to each other. I pretended to still be in slumber. 

“I know I seem easily entertained,” John was telling her, “but you really are the funniest person I’ve ever met.”

“I think I’m just autistic,” Kimberley laughed. “I say the first thing that comes into my head and luckily it’s funny.” 

John laughed and silence followed. I shifted my head as sneakily as I could to get a look at them. My two friends were sitting very close to one another. I could tell this silence wasn’t awkward. It was what John had always dreamed of. And then he broke it. 

“I… I wanna kiss you,” John said to Kimberley. “Would that… would that be okay.”

Kimberley laughed again and then nodded. “Yeah,” I heard her whisper, and they moved into one another. My stomach formed a satisfying lump as I watched my best friend kiss his crush and live his best life. I decided to go back to sleep for real. Watching it fully unfold felt a bit strange and two people kissing is always a little uncomfortable. 

A few seconds later though, I heard an unpleasant coughing, and John speaking with embarrassment. “Sorry.” He continued to cough. “Sorry.” The coughing got worse. “I’ll be right back; gonna grab a glass of water.” 

I got up and watched John run away, not to the kitchen for water but the bathroom. Kimberley was watching him and turned suddenly when I murmured, “is he okay?” 

“You should go. Let me call you an Uber.” I’d like to tell you she said it in a gentle way that announced she wanted some privacy with John and that he was in for a great night, but there was unpleasantness in Kimberley’s voice. Gone was the timid girl who’d just been kissing my best friend. She spoke firmly and with no room for argument. 

There was a bang from inside the house. I recognized the direction of John’s bathroom. I got up and ran towards my friend. “Allen, don’t!” I heard Kimberley chasing after me. 

I got to the bathroom and heard my friend vomiting inside. I gently knocked on the door. “Hey, you okay in there?”

“I’m fine,” I heard John shoot back weakly. I heard him throw up again. “Is the other one still here?”

“Uh… you mean Kimberley? Yeah, she’s still here. She thinks I should head out.”

“NO!” I was taken aback by the volume of my friend’s voice. “I will be right out! We will continue movies. The… the bugs.”

“I think you should probably get some more rest,” I called back. “You might be sicker than you thought. I’ll back tomorrow.” 

John vomitted one more time, I heard a scream and then things were quiet beyond the door. 

“Allen, please leave,” I turned and saw Kimberley standing behind me. 

“I think John’s really sick in there,” I told her. “Maybe we should call someone.”

“I already did,” Kimberley said. “They should be here soon. I tried calling for an Uber but none are responding. You live close by, right? Think you can walk home?”

“I wanna make sure John’s okay,” I retorted. 

“He’s not going to be!” Kimberley shouted and I looked at her, puzzled, walking over to her. 

“What’s going on?” I asked her. There were tears in her eyes. “Just a few minutes ago, you two were kissing on the couch.” 

“You saw that?” Kimberley looked ashamed of herself. “I’m sorry.” 

“It’s fine,” I reassured her. “He really likes you and I’m glad you like him too.”

“No,” she continued. “I’m sorry that I…. I just thought that at least I could give him… Allen, go home.” 

And then the door opened. John walked out… well… I don’t know if “walk” is the right word. His body was limp, like a ragdoll. His head was pointing up towards the ceiling and he was almost trotting towards us. 

“You… feel better?” I asked. Kimberley grabbed my arm and pulled me back. John got a little closer and then stopped. His head slowly became level with his shoulders, making this horrible noises like breaking twigs as it moved, and I looked into… what used to be my best friend’s eyes. John’s eyes and been sliced open and his face… was distorted into the widest and most terrible grin that I’d ever seen. He started walking towards us again and that’s when Kimberley acted. She pulled me further back, stepped in front of me, and in a flash had pulled out a taser, and jammed it into John’s stomach. He collapsed to the ground and Kimberley grabbed my arm to run away. 

I was in shock. I wanted to call out for my friend, but everything was happening too quickly. Kimberley was leading us back to the front door. She opened it and practically flung me through. And we ran. Kimberley was faster than me but my adrenaline allowed me to keep up. 

“Kimberley! Kimberley what did you mean John wasn’t going to be okay!” She was about to give me some sort of answer when a blood curdling scream got our attention. I turned around and saw John sprinting towards us on all fours. The smile though… that terrible smile remained on his face. I turned and ran as fast as I could, Kimberley right beside me. We ran and we ran and we ran, hopping fences and going through yards, all while whatever John had become pursued us, growling and panting, but everytime I dared to turn around the smile remained. 
After several blocks, we managed to lose him. I stopped to catch my breath and swung towards my remaining friend, this time demanding answers. “Okay, Kimberley. What in the fuck… what in FUCK is going on with..?” 

I was alone. Kimberley wasn’t there. At some point during the hunt, we must have gotten separated… or worse. I wanted to shout out her name, but something told me that would be unwise… but I couldn’t just leave her. She was my friend as well as John, and she was sorta the only one I had left now. As stupid as you all will tell me it was, I turned back around and quietly retraced my path. 

Every step back from where I came from filled me with terror. The only light I had access to were the dim street lamps and a few porch lights. I couldn’t risk my phone’s flashlight as it might call direct attention to me. I walked slowly, wanting to look forward but I’d become so paranoid about tripping like Kimberley must have that I kept my head down to examine every step I was taking. I couldn’t call out for my friend. I couldn’t call her cell phone. Both options could get me killed, and by what? My best friend! What was I even doing? I had no plan, no defense, and the identity of my predator took away any will I had to fight back. John couldn’t truly be gone, right? Kimberley claimed that he wasn’t going to be okay. What did she know about this? Had she seen something like this before? Had she caused it? My mind drifted back to her story of the fire she pretended to escape. Had she been lying about lying about that? 

I interrupted my own train of thought to look up and check my surroundings. I recognized my location. This wasn’t too far from John’s house, which meant that I should have run into Kimberley by now. Maybe she had recovered from the fall she must’ve had and run in another direction. Maybe she was looking for me and I had put us both in danger by trying to find her again. 

“Allen!” The sound of someone calling my name out of nowhere scared me enough, but it wasn’t Kimberley’s voice… I turned and looked into the long void of darkness where I had just heard John. “Allen!” the voice shouted again. “Allen, I am okay!” John’s voice was getting closer. “Allen, I feel correct now!” Louder. “I am good, Allen.” 

I ran, and I ran as fast I could. Behind me, I heard John’s voice, screaming horribly but without any emotion, “ALLEN COME BACK! DO NOT ABANDON ME! ALLEN I AM JOHN! ALLEN I AM JOHN! ALLEN WE ARE JOHN! ALLEN I AM JOHN! PLEASE! I WANT MY FRIEND!” I increased into a sprint, hearing two more sets of footsteps behind me. 

The chase led me into a large clearing that John and I used to play in as kids. I dared to turn around and I think I’ll always regret that. I could see what used to be my friend clearly enough now. What had been said to me was true. There was no way John was going to get better. His neck had been stretched three times its length, skin ripped to reveal a protruding spinal cord where his head bobbled upon, a head still wearing that awful smile. Blood was dripping from his mouth. The rest of the body had been stretched as well. Every limb was the wrong size. “John” was hunched over, walking towards me on two legs, ever so slowly. 

“I am good, Allen,” He said again. “I am correct.” I was too stunned to move. “John” got closer and I realized that his hands had shed the skin and sharpened the bone into claws. The creature raised its arms and I looked up to see my best friend’s loosely fitted head, grinning happily, as it brought down it’s weaponized limb. 

A streak of black and orange and before the monster could finish me off, it was launched away. I stumbled back in surprise and looked up at my savior. She wore a black jumpsuit, had fiery orange hair and was crouched in the fighting stance. “It’s just you and me now, asshole!” The newcomer decried, as the horrible thing started to get up and regain its concentration. 

I picked myself up, stepping on a dry twig in the process. The cliché got the attention of the angry woman and she turned. She was as pale as “John” but there was strength in her body. Even in the darkness, I could see her eyes; orange as her hair with a literal glow to them. As she saw me, her look of determination turned to one of frustration, and she said, “Mother. Fucker.”

“Uh… hi,” I managed. “I’m looking for my friend, Kimberley.” 

“Well she’s dead. So get out of here!” The girl responded. 

“What, no!” I denied. 

Monster John had recomposed itself and launched itself at its attacker. The girl spun around and caught it by the neck. I heard John’s jaw break as the creature opened his mouth wider than any human should have been able to. It began to bite at its opponent. She held it off and began speaking to me again. “You really want the gory details? I found your friend’s body. This thing had already ripped her heart out. I found it finishing it. Now get the hell out of here!” 

The reveal of Kimberley’s fate was too much to handle in the moment and as if to distract myself from it, I asked the angry girl,  “Who are you?” 

Her frustration increased. “My name’s Galivia. Are you leaving now?” The monster was fighting its way out of her grip. 

I made my choice. If this woman was going to finish off what was left of my friend, I didn’t want him to be alone. If any part of John was still in there, even if it was too late to save it, his best friend should be by his side until the end. “I’m staying.” I told her. 

“That’s really REALLY fucking stupid,” Galivia informed me. “Well at least give me space to work and go over there.” She pushed the Monster away and when it lurched forwards again, she caught it in the chest and set her own hand ablaze. The beast stumbled backwards, screaming in my best friend’s voice, as what was left of John’s tattered clothing caught on fire. It dropped to the ground and began rolling about, trying to put itself out.

“What is this thing?” I shouted at Galivia. “What does it want?” 

“It’s a demon!” Galivia stated. “And it already got what it wants. I’m here to make sure it doesn’t do it again once it’s done with him.” 

No longer on fire, but extremely pissed off, the demon charged. The two met each other halfway and locked themselves in a rugged fist fight. Galivia leapt on top of it and tried to choke it out, but was thrown off. From a holster in her jump suit, Galivia drew a Police Baton and extended it. She ducked and weaved and jumped through “John’s” attacks before managing to land a decent attack on him. He screamed and I saw her smirks. Angrier than ever, it began punching and swiping. She sidestepped and leapt higher than any person I’d ever seen before. 

The demon extended its arm and I saw my John’s bones, held together by nerves and ripped muscle stretch out and grab Galvia in midair. The monster slammed her to the ground and sprinted at her. Another round of close combat proceeded, with “John” eventually managing to pull Galivia into a headlock. He pulled. Galivia screamed in pain as the devil slowly pulled her head off of her shoulders. Her blood and guts appeared to have minds of their own and even attempted to keep it attached but it was no use. The monster yanked Galivia’s cranium with a sickening gush, and threw it away before running off in its distorted nature. Galivia’s body fell to the ground and I finally threw up. 

I looked around the clearing. “John” had vanished again. Perhaps he forgot I was there and finally went into hiding. Whatever the case, I knew I had to get out of here. I shakily pulled myself up and turned to exit the clearing. 

“Dammit! Son of a BITCH!” I spun around. I didn’t believe it at first but then Galivia’s voice spoke again. “Mother. FUCKER!”

“Uh… ma’am?” I called out. 

“Hello?” Galivia responded. She didn’t sound hurt at all, rather annoyed.

“It’s me,” I said to her. “Uh… ma’am, you’ve uh…”

“Yes,” Galivia shot back. “I’ve been decapitated… bastard. You don’t see him anywhere, do you? Has he run off?”

“I think so,” I said, still in disbelief. “I think you lost.” I don’t know why I said it. Maybe I was trying to lighten the mood, although I’m not sure what good it did. 

Galivia sighed. “Weeks of tracking. Weeks of preparing. Wasted. Still, hoping I can pull myself together.”

I was quiet, still looking in the direction of Galivia’s severed head.

“That was a joke,” she breathed, sounding mentally at the end of her rope. “Do you think you could… bring me over to the other half?”

I felt sick again. “You want me… to bring your head over to the body?”

“Well yes,” Galivia puffed. “I can't think of how else I'm gonna get the damn thing back on.”

“Will that work?” I asked curiously. 

“I think so,” she said, not sounding entirely certain. 

Cautiously, I walked over to Galivia’s headless body. I shouldn’t have done what I did next, but I gave it a gentle kick. I asked her, “Can you uh… can you feel that?”

“Actually, yeah.” Galivia sounded rather shocked. “But seriously, can you come get me?”

Feeling a bit bolder, I ran over to Galivia’s head and picked it up. “Y’know,” I said. “I think I remember a science class a few years ago where we were taught that the average human head weighs about eleven pounds. The brain alone is three.”

Galivia clearly did not know how to respond to this. “Huh. Cool.” 

I began to carry her back to her body, and that’s when I saw there was no body to bring her back to. 

“Galivia,” I began.

“Yeah,” she huffed. “I see. The body is gone.”

“YOUR body is gone!” I couldn’t help but shout. 

“Yes, my body is gone. Now will you please look around to find WHERE my body has gone. It doesn't have a brain. It doesn't have eyes. It's missing four of its main senses. It couldn't have gotten that far!” This day was clearly going very badly for her. 

“It shouldn’t have gone ANYWHERE!” I exclaimed. “Like you said… it doesn’t have a brain.” 
“Oh, I don't know, maybe it does,” Galivia pondered. “This is all pretty new to me; the beheading, I mean. It's kind of a feeling of oh, ah HA!”

I looked and saw Galivia’s body not too far. I ran after it and the damn thing started running away.

Panting as I ran, the head still in my arms, I managed the words, “Galivia… this... is gross.” 

Galivia sounded insulted. “Hey, you signed up for this the moment you decided to stick around! I gave you a chance to run away!”

“Well how often do you get a chance to watch two real monsters do battle?” I asked her. 

“I am NOT a monster!” Galivia retorted and I felt a pang of sadness in my heart. John wasn’t a monster either… was that all I was gonna remember him as? 

“Right, sorry” I apologized. “I didn’t mean it in a bad way.”

Galivia sighed  again. “Okay, I’m sure you didn’t, but I'm frustrated right now. I am a fucking severed HEAD! Now throw me!” 

“What?” The order caught me off guard. 

“THROW ME!” Galivia commanded. “ I can catch myself I think!”

My basketball instincts kicking in, I threw the head. The body turned and as if through reflex, held out its arms and caught the head. It shouldn’t have been possible, but as the head got closer to the body’s headless stump, it started stretching out veins and other nonsense to reattach itself. “Crazy stuff,” Galiva said. 

“So what happens now,” I asked, catching up to her. 

“Gotta find the demon,” Galivia replied. “Gotta put it down.”

“It’s using my friend’s body,” I told her. “Can he still be helped?” The question felt stupid to ask but I had to know for sure. 

“I’m sorry,” Galivia said and there seemed to be real dejection in her voice. “Once these things possesses a person, they’re almost always beyond hope. They’re mindless parasites. They infect the anatomy and have no instinct except to harm, hunt and spread.”

“Hold on,” I said, with a foolish hint of longing. “You just said ‘ALMOST beyond hope.’ That means there’s still a chance, right?”

Galivia looked down, miserably. I had a feeling she wished she hadn’t told me that. “I only know of a single person who’s ever survived possession, and it only happened because they acted quickly; more or less knew what was going on. Essentially, before the demon could possess them, they possessed the demon… which means it’s too late for your friend to come back. They’re gone. I’m sorry.” 

I took all this in, but denial held me tight. 

“DUCK!” Galivia yelled. 

It all happened so fast. I did what I was told and got to the ground, raising my head quick enough to see John’s demon leap over, barely missing me as his prey. Galivia caught him, set her hands on fire once more, raised the beast over her head, and then brought it crashing down on her knee. I heard its spine break in half and Galivia threw it down on the ground, breathing heavily, but victoriously. She looked to me. “It’s over.”

I slowly moved to the dying demon. It was panting, and shaking in pain. Now that all was said and done, it simply looked pathetic. It twitched its head… my best friend’s head, and turned towards me. The smile was still etched upon its face, but it no longer scared me… and then it spoke… “Allen?”

And it wasn’t the demon’s mimic voice. It was John’s; truly and fully John’s. I got closer. 

“I’m here, buddy.” I promised him. “What do you need?”

John closed his slitted eyes and smiled a little brighter. “I… got… to kiss her tonight.” And then he lay still, moving no more. 

I sat with my friend’s body for some time. Could’ve been minutes. Could’ve been hours. Galivia had slipped away at some point. The sun had started to rise and I knew I had to get home before anyone saw me. I was covered in dirt, sweat, and blood, some of which belonged to me but also to John and Galivia. I couldn’t be seen this way.

A few days passed and authorities still came to talk to me. Obviously, John had been reported missing and the police had to look like they were doing something. There was no way they hadn’t discovered John’s remains. He had been left out in the middle of the clearing for anyone to find him, but I also knew that whoever DID find my friend wouldn’t be able to explain what had become of him. No one would be able to; no one except me or Galivia. No, this case was going to be swept under the rug where it belonged. John would go down in history as a mysterious small town legend and I was fine with that. I think John would be fine with it too. 

Kimberley’s body was never announced either. In fact, no news outlet mentioned her at all. I’m guessing the same people who found John found and properly disposed of her as well. I think back to the Winston-Salem Fire. A small scale and violent tragedy, that may or may not have ever involved that [poor girl.](https://www.youtube.com/@frowerhousestudios/videos)
