A few years ago, I wrote a book about Peter Nash called *The Man in the Closet.* Unfortunately, due to an  lawsuit from his victims’ families, the publisher ultimately pulled the book from store shelves and removed the digital version from Amazon. 

Given what I found out today, I feel like it’s in the community’s best interests for my interviews with the killer to be shared as widely as possible. 

For your own safety, please read the following excerpt.

*Jan 15, 2017:* 

*Interviewer: I’d like to go back to something you mentioned during one of our first sessions. About your childhood. You said you hiding became an addiction. Your word. Can you talk a bit more about that?*

*Nash: When my dad got to drinking or getting high, he loved hitting on me and my siblings. And then like I said, there came a day where he beat my mother half to death. And even after that, she insisted on going on like nothing was wrong, like we were a normal family. But if I was out there in the living room, watching TV or reading or whatever, it was always with the knowledge that it all might break at any moment. That he’d run in and start tossing furniture and throwing punches. At some point, I couldn’t relax anywhere but in a dark closet. At least there, I had some chance he wouldn’t find me. That I’d be safe.*

*Interviewer: Until one day…*

*Nash: Until one day, I wasn’t safe. He came home like usual, except my mom had taken my sisters out for ice cream in town. But my dad, he just kept tearing the place apart, looking for someone. Me, I guess. And then finally he found me. But this time, I wasn’t going to get hit again.*

*Interviewer: You’d taken the hunting knife into the closet with you.*

*Nash: I hadn’t planned to use it. Not really. I just knew I felt safer holding it.* 

*Interviewer: But you did use it.*

*Nash: Oh yes I did. That first time was improvisation, of course. But it felt absolutely right. Right away. I’ll always treasure the look on my father’s face. It was just perfect. My best work, really. I think every one after that was a pale imitation, unfortunately. Of course, they were all special in their way, but that first one…*

*Interviewer: You didn’t kill again for a long time after that.*

*Nash: No. I wanted to, but I also was trying to resist it. I hid though. Lots of hiding.*

*Interviewer: In your same closet?*

*Nash: No, lots of closets around town. It became kind of a game to me. I’d watch people coming and going from a house, learning their patterns. Eventually, when I was sure no one was home, I’d go inside and find a nice closet. Something not too big. There was a certain pleasure in contorting myself to get into a small space. It was part of the game I guess.*

*Interviewer: And then what?*

*Nash: And then I’d just listen. Sometimes I’d stay a few hours, sometimes much longer. I’d let the family come home and just listen to their conversations. I’d always try to pick the nicest looking families. Maybe I was hoping it was a facade, that they’d come home and scream bloody murder at each other. Some did, of course. But a lot of them were just as nice at home as they were out in the street.*

*Interviewer: And that made you feel…*

*Nash: You sound like my psychiatrist.*

*Interviewer: Sorry. I’m just trying to understand your motivation at this stage.*

*Nash: I was jealous I suppose. Resentful. But I was still young. My feelings hadn’t hardened into anything real, yes. I was just an observer.*

*Interviewer: Were you ever caught?*

*Nash: Once or twice. I was a fast runner, and I’d go to neighborhoods pretty far from my own. Nothing ever came of it.*

*Interviewer: At what point did that escalate into… more?*

*Nash: I suppose at some point, sitting in those dark closets I started making rules. This probably goes back to when I was a kid, fantasizing about leaping out of that closet and fighting my dad. But… it became like. Okay. There are rules to this. As long as this family is all nice to each other, I’ll let them live. Or as long as they don’t open the closet, I won’t stab them with my knife. Or if they somehow figured our I was there and tried to run away, that was no good. Then when the families violated those rules, it felt okay to kill them. They weren't nice families anymore.*

*Interviewer: How many times did this scenario play out?*

*Nash: Oh, at least fifty. I’d say about half the time, the family really did turn out to be nice, and no one opened the closet. Then, after they’d gone to bed at night, I’d just let myself out the front door. Other times, people starting yelling at each other, and I’d have to come out to teach them a lesson.*

*Interviewer: And if they opened the closet door?*

*Nash: It’s not nice to go looking for someone who doesn’t want to be found. I had to teach them a lesson too.*

In their lawsuit, the victims’ families argued I’d done too good a job of humanizing Nash. They were worried he’d be able to appeal for a lighter sentence or a less secure prison facility. To me, the accusations were ridiculous. I’d basically just printed our interviews verbatim without any editorial intrusion. 

Of course, maybe you could argue that I was throwing out softball questions. To that, I’d say that I needed to build up trust with Nash. He didn’t like to be put on the spot or questioned too harshly. To get the truth, I had to be his friend.

I will say I’ve come to regret getting too chummy with him toward the end. It got to a point where he started asking questions about my wife and kids. Maybe I’d been lulled into thinking he was harmless, or maybe I’m just a proud dad, but I couldn’t help gushing about them: Elliot’s awesome passing on the soccer field, and the way Greta meticulously organized her dolls’ clothing even though she was only six. 

I’ve been thinking about those conversations a lot today.

Today, we were just sitting down with the kids to play Settlers of Catan when I got a call from Todd Wells over at the state prison. Normally, I ignored all distractions during family game day, but this was no ordinary call. 

I hadn’t heard from Wells since a few weeks after my book on the Man in the Closet had come out, and that conversation had been unpleasant to say the least.

“Mr. Wells, so nice to hear–”

“I’m making this call as a courtesy. We’re holding a press conference in thirty minutes. There was an incident during Mr. Nash’s prisoner transfer to the new state facility in Belmont last night. There was a bad traffic accident and an explosion. We thought we’d accounted for all of the detainees, dead and alive, but you know Mr. Nash. He’s good at hiding.”

“Is he–”

“We still haven’t located him.”

“You haven’t–”

“If you want to find out more, watch the press conference. I made this call as a courtesy. God bless and good luck.”

He hung up, and I began to look around the room. All of the closet doors were closed. We’re a fairly messy household, and a lot of doors usually get left open. Was it possible that we’d closed them all? I tried to remember if I’d shut them as part of my usual tidying last night.

Then I thought over the events of the morning. We’d all gone out to a big breakfast at the Black Bear diner and then hit the mall to get new tap shoes for Greta and shinguards for Elliot. We’d been gone for hours.

I looked over at my wife, who was walking over to the dining room table with a big bowl of popcorn. In the meantime, Greta was carefully arranging the game tiles into stacks, and Elliot was setting up a playlist on his phone.

As Greta reached the table with the popcorn, Greta groaned.

“Did you put pepper on it?”

“Of course,” said my wife. “We all like it that way.”

“I used to like it that way,” said Greta, crossing her arms. “Now I don’t.”

As they began to argue, I kept looking around the house, trying to listen for any hint of a sound from the closets. Nothing so far. I noticed my hands shaking a bit in a way I couldn’t control.

“Please,” I said, joining everyone at the table. “Let’s try not to argue right now.”

“Why?” said Greta, crossing her arms. “Since when did we make it through family game day without fighting? You and mom are the worst, you know?”

“That’s not true,” I lied, trying not to imagine the sound of a closet door creaking open. “You watch and see. This is going to be the best family game day ever! Let’s all make it a big goal to get along, okay?”

Greta rolled her eyes and went back to arranging the tiles.

Part of me thought about running. But you’re not supposed to run. Maybe I could have pretended I had something to show them out in the front yard. I don’t know. Maybe that would have been too obvious a lie.

And so a few minutes later, we started the game. 

I have to admit, I’ve been a bit distracted this whole time. When I get anxious, writing calms me down. As the game has progressed, I’ve been alternating between defusing little arguments and tapping away at my keyboard. I told them something important for work has come up, which it has, but I think they don't appreciate how distracted I've been. 

Maybe, if you find this, and we’re not around anymore, you’ll at least know what became of us. Maybe you can finally put my book out again and attach this as a kind of epilogue. 

But my hope is that you’re reading this, and I’m still doing fine. Maybe every closet in the house is empty. Or even better, maybe we’ll play the whole game without arguing about someone hoarding one of the resources, or ‘cheating’ to build the longest road, or blocking someone from winning out of spite. 

[Because we really are a nice family.](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarymaxx/comments/zwo5o8/welcome_to_the_world_of_scarymaxx/)
