The air rushed over my face, a deafening cacophony that drowned out anything else. I closed my eyes and tried to invision anything but the world around me. I’d been told once to remember the happiest place i’d been, that it’d calm me down. So I did.

Lapping waves against a shore, that was a start, and much better than the current of air i’d been hearing. Lapping waves. A starting point to focus on. The crinkle of leaves on a tree as the branches blow in the wind on a cool autumn day, just before everything begins to fall, but the deadly fingers of winter have begun to close in around the world. The creaking of the boards on the dock as my dad walked along it’s weathered and aged planks, the nails popping out in some places. He’d always meant to take some supplies out to that cabin he owned on the lack and fix it up, but like everything else in life a fresh coat of paint was slapped on the outside, but the guts were left to rot and wither away until nothing else was left.

The blaring of car horns. Wait, that wasn’t from the lake. I opened my eyes and quickly shut them again. What else could i remember from that old place? 

Sitting in the old chair on the dock, watching the waves go by. It’s fabric scratchy from years sitting out in the sun, bing worn away by the wind and the rain. It’s once smooth wood giving way to the ravages of time, becoming pitted and rough. It had moved from a warm amber to a cold gray, like the life had faded from it from years of neglect. My sister sitting next to me, her head buried in her phone, like she couldn’t be bothered to spend time with her family. Things hadn’t gotten any better after our last time out to the cabin, but this was supposed to be happy thoughts, not dwelling on the failures of my life. What else did i see? Trees rimming the lake in their autumn glory, some of the leaves falling to the ground but being caught by the breeze in one last blaze of glory before being pulled back to the ground where their final fate awaited them, a slow transition to decay. They’d bring life back to the world again, but not for themselves. The family car, a cherry red station wagon my father had spent too much time on. It was outdated and held together with spit, but he poured all his time into it, not into his family. It’s headlights barely worked at night. A fact I learned the hard way one night on the lake.

I remembered the smell and taste of the air out in the woods. A crisp freshness that was foreign to my urban upbringing. No car fumes to choke me out there, only the fade of the flowers fading to the decay of the leaf litter to fill my nose when we went out there every year, like we were catching it just after it’s prime, but before it faded away. Mom fried bacon in the mornings, like we were actually camping, and the smell seemed to linger most of the day. The smell of the dust that was kicked up when I took the old station wagon for a joyride and crashed through the cabin.

I opened my eyes again. Everything was happening so fast around me, Life was rushing at me too fast. I closed my eyes again. 

I felt the last of the warm tendrils of the sun stretch across my face as fall days gave way to winter nights, bringing with them cutting breezes that ate into your bones. The feel of the old leaves squishing beneath your shoes, no life was left to crunch out of them. Just damp ruined remains that stick to you. The smooth feel of a steering wheel beneath the hands of a young boy, barely large enough to see over the wheel. The lurch of the engine as he jams down on the gas too hard and takes off. The sickening drop in the pit of his stomach as he realizes he doesn’t know enough to keep himself safe. The explosion of pain as his face slams into the wheel, ripping open his forehead as he slams through the family home. The flash of lights as he’s photographed by the police as they ask him about the death of his family.

Something hard hits my face again, and the whistling of the wind stops.
