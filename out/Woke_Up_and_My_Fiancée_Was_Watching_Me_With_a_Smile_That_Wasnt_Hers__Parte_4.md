There were two days left until the wedding. But I was no longer just a nervous groom. I was a man haunted by a presence that spoke to me when the house went silent, that woke me screaming every time I tried to escape.

I cut myself. Tried to drown. Crashed the car into a tree.  
But death refused me.  
Every time I thought it would end, I woke up in the same bed, in the same room, soaked in sweat — as if nothing had happened.  
As if *he* had been sitting at the foot of the bed, watching me sleep.

The night before the wedding, I went to my in-laws’ house. The air felt like a tomb — quiet, heavy, as though mourning something not yet dead. Everyone smiled, but only with their mouths. Dianna was... too serene.  
That night, I heard voices behind the walls. Whispers in ancient Greek — and somehow, I understood them.  
One of the voices was his.

That’s when he gave me the ultimatum:

“Five years. Until the sixth day of the sixth month, 2030. At six hours and six minutes in the morning.  
Until then, we will share this body.  
After that, it will be mine alone.  
In return, your soul shall rest in the Elysian Fields — far from the Tartarus that awaits the damned.  
Break this pact, and your fate will be far worse.”

He promised me a pagan afterlife in exchange for half my existence.  
As if I had a choice.

 

The day of the wedding arrived.

The ceremony was... beautiful, on the surface.  
But everything in it screamed symbolism.  
The flowers were not merely white — they were lilies and narcissus, the blooms of mourning. Among them, poppies and pomegranates bloomed — a spring reborn under the shadow of the Underworld.  
The aisle was blood-red, and the altar was lined with candles spiraling inward, like a path descending into Hades’ realm.

Dianna wore white, but there was something ancient in her, as if she were being reborn before everyone’s eyes.  
When she smiled, I saw someone else behind those eyes.

Arthur was there.  
But he didn’t speak.  
Didn’t smile.  
He only *watched*.  
I wondered if they had done something to him. Silenced him.  
Paid a price to keep him from ruining the ritual.

My in-laws held hands as if in prayer — but they weren’t praying to any god I knew.  
They whispered in tongues that made the air grow colder.

The ceremony ended beneath a sky that had turned from clear to storm-dark in minutes, as if night had hurried to witness it.

 

The wedding night *was* the ritual.

When I entered the room, it was no longer our room.  
It had become a temple.

The walls were veiled in black tapestries stitched with symbols I recognized from the contract I had signed.  
The floor bore a circle of salt, bones, and crushed pomegranate petals.  
Candles were arranged in inverted triangles.

And Dianna…  
She stood in the center, wearing a crown of wilted flowers, her eyes devoid of light.  
Before her was a black mirror that reflected nothing.  
She called my name — but the voice was not hers.  
*It was his.*

I walked toward her.  
Not by choice, but as though pulled by an invisible chain.

I knelt inside the circle.  
She leaned in and whispered something into my ear — ancient words that bent something inside me.

The pain wasn’t physical.  
It was as if my soul had been folded in half.

She lay with me in the circle — but it wasn’t love.  
It was *possession*.  
The touch wasn’t only hers.  
There was something moving through us. A current of darkness, old as death itself, sliding inside, sealing itself.

And when it was over, I don’t remember falling asleep.  
Only *waking up*.

He was inside me.

And Dianna, still naked beside me, smiled with the eyes of Persephone.
