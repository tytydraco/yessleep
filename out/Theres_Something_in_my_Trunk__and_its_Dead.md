Sometimes I wonder if things on the other side can reach into our world and play games with us. Perhaps they can manipulate objects and even screw with our lives. My neighbor Shayna said it's true. She was a middle aged witch and professional fortune teller.

She kept to herself mostly. Her house was a small bungalow all decked out with occult symbols and paraphernalia. Sometimes at night I'd hear her arguing with her husband Troy. You could tell she was drunk as a skunk on most of these occasions.

One time I got into an argument with her regarding a tree in my yard that dropped branches into hers whenever a heavy storm blew through town. She threatened to put a curse on me during the altercation. It ended with her walking back inside laughing.

After that I often peeked out the window when I heard her outside, afraid she was setting up some voodoo crap in my yard to kick off the hex. I started thinking about it in bed, tossing and turning and loosing sleep, worried about how and when the dreaded curse would manifest itself into my life.

One day I was driving my Crown Vic home from work when I smelled something odd. It was rancid and rotten. I pull over and walked back to the trunk of my car. I had been planning on opening it up when I noticed something on the ground just under the trunk area. It looked like a few drops of blood.

Upon kneeling down and dipping my head under the car behind the rear wheel, I noticed that it was dripping onto the pavement from the underside of my car. I could see that red wetness had filled several cracks and crevices under there. The liquid was lightly flowing from these to a low point where it fell off the car in a slow  drip.

Damn Shayna, I thought. I bet she killed a chicken or something and stuck it in there along with candles and god knows what else.

"Car trouble?" someone said, startling me. I looked up and saw that a police car had pulled up and stopped. The officer inside had his window down and was looking right at me. If he saw her little voodoo gift in my trunk, he'd think I was some kind of psychopath. I had to stay calm and get rid of him.

"No. I just ran over something and was checking to see if it did any damage." That was a good one. I expected him to buy it.

"Hey, ain't you Davis Holcomb's kid?" he asked.

"Yeah," I replied a little nervously. "You knew my Father?"

"Yeah, I went to school with him," he said. "You inherited his house right?" I nodded. "I used to go over there all the time when we were in high school."

Oh great, I thought, he knows where I live.

"It's Randy right?" he asked.

"Yeah that's right," I replied.

"How 'bout that? Davis' kid. Hey, you ever need anything, give me a call at the police station. Officer Bainbridge."

"Will do." I gave him a half hand wave as if to imply the conversation was over and he should be on his way. He waved back and drove off.

That was close. He hadn't noticed the blood drips. I went back to examining the undercarriage for a moment just to be thorough. I knew I had a small rust hole in the trunk so I found it and examined it. There was something white there. It looked fleshy. I used my key to pry on it a bit and it plopped out onto the road.

Oh God. It was a finger. A human finger.

In a panic I glanced up to see if the cop had driven out of view. He hadn't. He'd pulled in to the parking lot of the donut shop just up the street. His car was parked facing the road and pointed almost exactly at my position. There was light traffic but cars were driving past me every twenty seconds or so in both lanes.

Whoever it was in there was certainly dead. The finger was rotting and bloated. The dripping blood was thick and dark. The smell was rotten and acidic.

I momentarily considered showing the cop, but then I'd get the blame. I mean, how could I explain it? I'd be a prime suspect at least. They'd ask why I didn't tell the cop about the dripping blood? And then I remembered the curse.

The curse. Of course. Someone had killed someone and deposited the body in my car -probably a random car to them - to throw the blame off of themselves. I often leave my car windows down, and the trunk hatch lever is right inside. It could have been anyone.

I picked up the finger with a towel that I had in the car and put it in the backseat. I decided to drive somewhere secluded to open the trunk and look inside. But what was I going to do with the body once I saw it? I had to dispose of it somewhere and then clean out the truck so there was no sign of the decaying flesh or blood. I'd seen a cop TV show where the killer used bleach. I needed some of that, rubber gloves, paper towels, large trash bags, and a shovel to bury the corpse.

I stopped off at a hardware store to purchase the items. I couldn't stop worrying about the possibility of someone in the parking lot noticing the blood drips while I gathered my supplies.

I wanted to put the body somewhere where it would be found so the family would know what happened and the police could try to find the killer but the more I thought about it the more risky the idea seemed to me. In spite of the curse I wasn't going to go down for a murder I didn't commit if I could help it. I had to remove myself from the equation. I had to be sure.

I walked up to the register at the hardware store and started to set my items on the counter. "Find what you needed to get the job done?" The checkout woman asked.

What did she mean 'job'? I thought. What did she know about it? I tried to stay calm. "Uh, yeah I think so," I replied.

"Shovel, rubber gloves, and bleach? What ya doin' hun, cleaning up a crime scene?" she laughed.

Oh my God! I thought. She knows! Maybe a coworker of hers saw the blood dripping in the parking lot and mentioned it to her while I was shopping. Oh crap. I started to sweat. My heart began pounding hard in my chest.

"No," I said, "just cleaning out the garage and getting rid of some bushes." Bushes, I said to myself. Good thinking. Just stay calm and act like nothing's going on.

"You know," she started again while scanning my order. "my cousin worked with a guy who killed his wife and he buried the body under some bushes in his back yard.

"Is that so?" I asked.

"Yup. But the cops caught him in no time. You can hide a body but you can't hide from the police. No siree."

"I'll keep that in mind," I stated flatly as I paid and packed up my stuff. I headed for the door fighting off the burning urge to run.

Maybe they saw the blood and called the police, I thought. That's it! They aren't cops so they can't do anything. As soon as I pull out of the parking lot a squad car is going to arrive and follow me. I just know it.

As I walked out the double glass doors another employee was standing there staring at me with his company blue vest and nametag on. What's he looking at? I wondered. Doesn't he have some work to be doing?

I threw the stuff in the backseat, hopped in behind the wheel, and calmly pulled out of the parking lot trying not to appear in a hurry. I checked my rear views and didn't see any police cars. I thought I must have gotten out before the cops had time to get there.

It was now imperative that I get this thing out of my trunk and in the ground and clean up the trunk as soon as was humanly possible. If they search my car they might be suspicious, but without a body or blood stains, there would be nothing they could do.

On the way to the wooded area where I had decided to dump the body, I had to drive past the donut shop again. Officer Bainbridge was still there, parked as before. He must have known I'd be coming this way, I decided, and now he's going to watch where I go.

I drove past him going the exact speed limit. Not a mile faster or slower. I glanced over at him as I passed without turning my head. He was staring right at me with a big grin on his face. Oh god, I thought, he knows!

My hands were shaking and panic was pulling at my adrenal glands. I managed to drive steady to my turn off and followed the long gravel road back into the forest. I made another turn down an old dirt road I hadn't seen since I was a kid and found my spot. I turned the car off and listened. I couldn't hear any car coming up the gravel road which was a good sign.

At that point I just wanted the stress to end. Whatever it was in the trunk I just needed to get it out and in the ground as fast as possible. Clean the trunk and get the hell out of there. Put the bleach in the closet at home and the shovel in the garage. No point in disposing of them since the hardware store employees would remember that I bought them. Oh yeah, before doing that I realized I needed to dig up a bush in my back yard to make my story legit if a cop came around asking.

All set. Rubber gloves on. Put key in slot. Turn. Open trunk. And....

Two white balls embedded in a dark red and black pile of mush moved. They had dark spots of some kind and both aimed right at me before I could process what I was seeing.

I paused in confusion as my brain tried to figure it out. Oh God. They were eye balls! Just below them the dark goo spread open to reveal a set of teeth and I heard a deep exhale.

I jumped back, startled in shock. 'It's alive!'. I didn't know how. There wasn't much of a body left, but whoever it was was still alive and moving. In spite of trembling terror and a deep nauseating knot in my gut I slowly crept back up to the open trunk and forced myself to take another look.

It was still staring at me. A blob of black mush with brick red dried blood covering it like chipping paint on an old house. A cap of matted dark brown hair on top of a skeletal shaped face of dark goo sat in a pile of goop, with the two white eyeballs popping out and glaring at me above a gaping open double set of near perfect teeth.

I was frozen still in a fear/disgusted combo. Then out from the goo a skeletal arm sloshed upward and reached out to me as if begging for help. But there was no flesh left on the arm, just bone, some tendons, and black rotten meat dripping off it in gooey chunks.

Whoever this was, I thought, they must be in unbearable pain. There's no doctor, no hospital, no medical procedure on the earth that could save this poor soul. I had to bury it. But first I had to kill it.

The only thing I'd ever killed in my life were small bugs. I wasn't sure if I'd be able to do it. I grabbed the shovel and began trying to scoop the bulk of the mass of the thing out onto the ground. It heaved and wailed in pain.

I just gotta do it fast to end it's suffering, I thought. So with all my strength I got the shovel up under it and pulled up causing most of it to be flung up and out onto the ground. It looked up at me and started to crawl towards me. It's leg bones were still in the trunk so it was only using it's arms to pull itself along the ground. When it reached me it looked up at me and began to crawl up my leg, it's mouth gaping open.

I beat it off with the shovel and used the tip of the shovel's blade to sever the head from the rest. It stopped moving.

I started to dig a hole as quickly as I could. As I did I could hear a car driving along the gravel road that led to the dirt road that I was on. Fear and panic now were beyond high gear and my heart was beating so hard I could hear it. There was a strange tinnitus like high pitch in my ears and I was breathing so deep I think I was hyperventilating.

I dug for about five minutes before I had a hole that looked big enough to fit the remains into. The whole time I could hear that car on the gravel getting closer and closer. I thought at any second it was going to turn down the dirt road and then it would be next to me within a minute.

I scooped the head, torso, and arms along the rest of the goop on the ground into the hole and then cleared out what was left in the trunk. I took me about ten minutes to get it all in there and another ten to bleach clean the trunk. I threw the paper towels I used in the hole and cleaned the shovel and rubber gloves with bleach as well. I put the finger from the back seat in there and then buried it all good.

The whole time that car kept getting closer and closer. I put the shovel and the other stuff in the backseat as the first moment of relief swept through my body. I was almost home free.

I felt I should put some kind of grave marker there but nothing too obvious. Everyone  deserves that much respect, so I found two good size sticks and laid them on top in the form of a cross.

I got back in my car and started driving out. I was sure I'd run into the car I had heard along the way. It had to be this far back by now.

I reached the end of the dirt road and slowly turned onto the gravel road myself. I didn't see any other cars in either direction so I turned the car off and stepped out to listen. I could still hear the other car on the gravel in the distance. It didn't matter now, I thought, so I got back in the car and kept going back towards the main road.

Where the gravel road met the pavement, I turned left to head back home. Within a mile or so one of my tires went flat and I had to pull over. Wouldn't you know it, Officer Bainbridge pulled up behind me. He approached me as I examined the flat.

"Well hello again," he said. "You need some help with that flat?"

"No, I got it," I replied.

"I see some white dust on your tires. Looks like you been down Old Howard Road. What you doing back there?" he prodded.

Oh crap. I didn't have a good excuse figured out for this question. As I quickly tried to come up with a believable lie, I glanced back at his car. It's tires had the same white dust from the gravel road on them as well. It was him! He'd been the car driving on the gravel road.

Had he stopped and snuck through the woods and seen me burying the body? Why was he so interested in where I'd been? Had the people at the hardware store called him and he was following me from a distance?  I faked confidence and looked him right in the eye.

"You know," I started. "I was back there a few days ago filming the woods for a you tube video I'm working on and my tripod came up missing. I thought I might have left it there." Oh boy! I said to myself in my head. That was a good one. Nothing he could say to that.

"Oh really? That's pretty cool," he said. "What's the video about?"

"Bigfoot," I answered.

"Well we ain't had no Bigfoot sightings around here," he shot back.

"I know," I said. "I just needed some footage of woods to show while I narrate the story."

"Oh I see. Hey, why don't you give me your keys and I'll get the spare out of your trunk for ya?"

It was like a nightmare. Half an hour earlier and I'd have been sunk. I handed him my keys. I didn't want to come off as suspicious.

I walked back there with him as he opened the trunk. The harsh aroma of bleach hit us both like a brick wall.

"God damn son! What'd you spill bleach back here or something?"

My heart rate went back up into the danger zone. I said nothing as he started to get the jack out. He put the device up to his nose and took a whiff.

"It's all over everything in here," he said. I took the jack from him as he leaned in again and grabbed the spare tire. He stopped and instead of removing the tire he walked back up to one of the rear doors and opened it. "Your bleach bottle is in the back seat with a shovel," he said.

I had broken out into a cold sweat and could feel myself trembling. He looked back at me and must have noticed something was wrong.

"Suppose you tell me what all this is for and why your trunk smells like bleach?"

I started to cry and sat down on the curb with my head in my hands. I confessed the whole story to him. He didn't believe the part about the skeletal body crawling up my leg, but he took the shovel and drove me back to the spot where I buried the body. I dug it back up for him but the body was gone.

"It was right here, I swear it!" I said.

"This better not be some kinda hidden video prank for your you tube channel," he said. "You can't be wasting the counties time and resources on something like that. I got better things to do". He stopped for a second as if thinking. "Wait a minute," he said. "You don't live near that old Fortune Teller Shayna do you?"

"Yeah. Right next door," I answered.

"God damn," he said. "Trunk. We didn't check her trunk." I was confused. "Her husband Troy been missing for over a week and she's been acting strange. We searched her house but found nothing. We have a guy watching her 24/7 but she hasn't gone anywhere. You come with me."

He drove me to Shayna's house. Along the way he radioed dispatch and asked for another officer to meet him there. They had me wait in my front yard while they made Shayna open the trunk of her car. There was some commotion and then they put her in cuffs. They took her back inside her house. 

They'd bring her back out with her carrying her purse and a sweater and take her away. I'd have to fill out an affidavit and an ambulance type vehicle would show up to retrieve the remains out of her trunk.

But first, while they were all still inside Shayna's house I felt an overwhelming urge to walk over and look inside the still open trunk of her car. I knew I wasn't supposed to. I knew I could get charged with evidence tampering but I had to know. I had to see it for myself.

The mess looked almost exactly like what was in my trunk only there was still some bloated whitish skin on this thing including the eyelids. The eyes themselves were still open and coincidentally staring right at me. The teeth were the same set of perfect pearls lining the gaping mouth and I swear to you just before I walked away the thing winked.
