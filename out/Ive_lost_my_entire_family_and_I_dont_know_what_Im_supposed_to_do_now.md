I was walking down towards the cow pastures at the farm. My grandfather was out of town, so the chores were entirely my responsibility. I was excited, I loved taking care of the animals. My parents passed away when I was young, and my grandfather had raised me. 

The pond was shimmering in the sun, reflecting the vibrant colors of changing leaves on a crisp, fall day.

The slaughterhouse hadn’t been utilized since the early ‘70s, when my grandfather began working in a factory to make ends meet after my grandmother disappeared.

That building always gave me the creeps. I continued towards the chicken coops to collect the eggs for the day. A strong gust of wind rushed in and the warm sunshine was a thing of the past.

Thick pillars of red-tinted clouds filled the sky as a violent storm approached. I ran toward the barn for shelter, but the doors wouldn’t open. Huddled under the cow shed, I watched as hail violently poured from the ominous clouds.

I panicked and desperately ran toward the farmhouse, but it felt as though I wasn’t getting any closer. 

A loud crash of thunder rumbled and I heard the downpour of rain in the distance, becoming progressively louder. Seeking shelter as quickly as possible, I hesitantly sprinted toward the slaughterhouse.

I pushed through the rotting wood into the slaughterhouse, I was shocked when my grandfather called my name from the entrance, slamming the door behind him.

“Oh honey, I see you’ve finally met your parents,” my grandfather said as he latched the door.

“W-what…?” I whimpered.

I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t speak. I had never felt such pure terror, it was as though the walls were bleeding. The slaughterhouse was much larger on the interior than it appeared to be from outside. The walls were lined with shelves containing the most gruesome sights I’d ever seen - or so I thought, until I looked down.

The floor was composed of the undead bodies of what appeared to be my parents and various family members, neighbors, and other poor unfortunate strangers. The entire structure was breathing, it was alive. I couldn’t process what was happening.

“What the fuck is this?” I asked my grandfather, mustering as much courage as I could dig out of myself in the situation.

“I know this is a lot,” he said casually. *What the hell, is my grandfather a serial killer?* I had always thought he was such a kind and compassionate man. I didn’t know what I thought anymore. 

“I’m gonna give it to ya straight dear, we gotta feed this house or it’s gonna ruin us all. My daddy did it before me and so on, it’s gettin’ too much for me and you’re gonna have to take it over. I’ll show ya the ropes and what’s what,” he said as he began walking down the narrow stairs into the darkness, the structure gasped as he began limping down the stairs.

*Feed the house?* This couldn’t actually be happening, it didn’t make any sense. “What do you mean we have to feed the house? Is that what the bodies in the flooring are?” I asked, in a daze almost totally disconnected from any emotion.

“Yep. It don’t like kids, and it don’t like old people. Can’t tell ya much else,” he said, again nonchalantly, as though this was normal, “You can get ‘em in here however ya want, the house’ll do the rest.”

“Then how come nothing is happening to me?”

“Not sure, it must like ya. It wouldn’t take ya when you were little either. I figured it wanted ya to replace me,” he said. I needed an explanation. I swear I’d never been inside this godforsaken slaughterhouse.

“I don’t think I’ve ever been in here, what do you mean it wouldn’t take me? When did this happen? What happened?” I asked, confused and frustrated.

“I didn’t wanna bring your daddy in here, but he was real mean to your mama and the house needed to eat. Your mama chased after him and burst through the door, you came followin’ right behind. It swallowed both of ‘em right up, but not you. You was gone, and I found ya over by the pond and kept ya,” he said as tears began to fill his eyes, ”your mama was my baby girl, I’d have never let anything happen to her but I couldn’t do nothin’ to stop it.”

Streams of tears began to flow down his aging cheeks and he became very pale, I was startled as the tears turned to blood and he was absorbed into the flooring of the slaughterhouse.

I hear a low, gruff, and angry voice echoing from all around me, “You have three days.”

I crumbled to the floor and burst into tears, I don’t understand. What the hell am I supposed to do now?
