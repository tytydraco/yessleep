I should’ve known something was off the moment I stepped onto the ship. The air felt… wrong. Heavy, oppressive, like it carried a weight only I could feel. But I brushed it off. After all, this was my first real vacation in years. A weeklong cruise to nowhere, just open seas and a chance to disconnect.

The first three days were everything I’d hoped for: endless buffets, lazy afternoons by the pool, and drinks that seemed to refill themselves. But on the fourth night, everything changed.

It started with a noise. I was lying in bed in my tiny cabin when I heard it—something metallic, like a chain dragging along the floor above me. It stopped as suddenly as it started, leaving behind an eerie silence. I chalked it up to some late-night maintenance and forced myself to sleep.

When I woke up, the ship wasn’t moving.

I pulled back the curtain and stared out at the ocean. Nothing but endless gray water stretching in every direction. No islands, no land, no other ships. Just us, suspended in a vast void. I headed to the upper deck, expecting an announcement or some kind of explanation, but the crew was tight-lipped. The captain, usually a smiling presence at every dinner, was nowhere to be found.

By evening, rumors were spreading. Some said we’d hit something—an iceberg, maybe, though we weren’t anywhere near Arctic waters. Others whispered about engine failure. But none of that explained why the Wi-Fi was down, why the lights flickered even during the day, or why the lifeboats were gone.

That night, the sound came back. This time, it wasn’t just above me. It was everywhere. A scraping, dragging noise that echoed through the halls, like something huge was crawling across the ship. I wasn’t the only one who heard it. People gathered in the corridors, whispering, their faces pale.

And then we saw her.

She was standing at the end of the hall, a woman in a torn white dress, her hair wet and matted like she’d just climbed out of the sea. Her eyes… they weren’t right. They were dark, empty voids that seemed to swallow the light. Someone screamed, and she disappeared.

Panic spread like wildfire. People barricaded themselves in their cabins, but it didn’t help. The ship was massive, yet it felt like it was shrinking, the walls pressing in as the air grew colder.

The next morning, people were missing. Whole families, gone without a trace. Their cabins were untouched, their belongings still there, but the beds were soaked, the sheets smelling faintly of saltwater.

By the sixth day, there were only a handful of us left. We tried to stick together, but the ship seemed to work against us. Hallways twisted and turned, leading us back to where we started. Doors that had been locked swung open on their own, revealing rooms filled with seawater.

And then there were the whispers. Soft, insidious voices that seemed to come from nowhere and everywhere at once. They spoke in a language I couldn’t understand, but their intent was clear: we didn’t belong here.

On the seventh night, I found myself on the deck, staring out at the black, churning sea. The others were gone—taken, I assume. I didn’t want to think about how or why.

That’s when I saw her again, rising from the water like a ghost. Her mouth moved, forming words I couldn’t hear, but her eyes… they burned with an ancient, malevolent hunger.

I don’t remember jumping overboard, but I must have. The next thing I knew, I was floating in the middle of the ocean, the ship a distant shadow against the horizon.

A cargo ship found me two days later, delirious and half-mad. They told me I was the only survivor, that the cruise ship had vanished without a trace.

I still hear the whispers at night. And sometimes, when I close my eyes, I see her face.

I don’t think I escaped. Not really.
