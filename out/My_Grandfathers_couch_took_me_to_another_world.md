You live through it one hundred times. Then, you live through it a thousand more. That’s when you’re awake; when you’re asleep is when it gets weird. The events replay like usual. You notice where you screwed up and what happened because of it but for some reason your ex is there with famous cartoon characters. And they’re all just watching you with blank faces that have eyes the size of footballs while the tragedy you survived is happening in the background. Maybe that doesn’t make sense, but I’ve been living through that night back in Dugsgrave more times than I can count. 

Back in December, I went down to the town where my Grandfather spent his entire life up until his death a week before. We all saw it coming in the family but we figured he had another year left in him, and I thought I had more time to figure out what I would do with my new debt and degree.

Since everyone else in the family were halfway across the world in countries I’ve never heard of, it was dropped into my lap to handle my Grandfather’s house until the funeral could be arranged and the family could come back to the USA to handle all the legal stuff. So until then, I was stuck in a house that was in a town I hadn’t been in since I was 3 years old. 

It was one of them older style houses. The type where it’s pointy, has two floors, and the windows look like tall mirrors when the sun hits it right. The insides were nice and clean, surprisingly. My Grandfather Herman was a secret neat freak, I suppose. The only thing making the place less than pristine was the dust and my presence. 

The first few days were alright. My Grandfather’s place didn’t have the 80 inch TV I was used to, nor did he have the fast internet I took for granted back home. Instead, I had local access TV and the neighbor’s Internet to pass the time. I scrolled the usual places while “Jorge’s World History” played in the background. I was in the middle of reading an article about a gaming studio being able to “mimic” a player’s playstyle to create a nemesis when I heard a knock at the door. It was a single thud of a knock, enough to make me whip my head toward the living room. I got up and walked toward the front door as another thud hit.

As I looked through the peephole, I could see three older people outside the door with an aluminum tray and a small cake. Before they could knock again, I opened the door. 

“Hello. How may I help you?” I asked the closest one. He was a tall man with gray curly hair that was neatly trimmed. 

He hunched a bit to look me in the eye. “Hello young man. We were friends of Herman. We noticed the lights were on and put two and two together. We’re sorry for your loss and we wanted to let you know that we are here if you’ve got any questions, troubles that need fixing, or you just need the company”.

His voice was gravelly, sounded like he never had air in his lungs, but his smile was warm and inviting. I opened the door to let who I would soon learn to be Quentin, Mary, and Trujillo, in. Quentin was the tall one. Mary was a shorter woman with a short brown bob cut, she looked younger than the other two men. And Trujillo was about the same height as me, he wore a gray hunting cap, and his beard was as long as my forearm. 

We spent a few hours talking about my Grandfather, eating the ham sandwiches they made along with the cake that had frosting spelled out, “Our Condolences” in cursive. I learned that the Grandfather I barely spent time with was an avid collector of “fancy knick knacks”, he was a man who couldn’t be out drank, and he was a big fan of Asian Kung Fu Generation. After we were done, they asked me something that I wish I knew myself.

Throughout the night, they all looked like they wanted to ask but Mary was the one who got to it first. “Can we know how Herman passed away? All we know is that obviously he’s not here with us anymore and he just seemed like a modern day titan. Y’know he once lifted a whole couch for us to go star gazing out back. Just hucked the whole thing over his shoulder like it was nothing”. Quentin laughed and patted her back.



“I’m sorry but I don’t know myself. All I know is what you know”, I answered as I tried looking into all three of their faces. “One day I’m at my dishwashing job and then the next, I’m here”. 

Quentin and Mary seemed to have sympathetic faces but Trujillo had a poker face so firm that I’m sure he’d be kicked out of every casino in Vegas. 



“Mr. Trujillo”, I locked eyes with him, or at least tried to. It’s like he was looking past me, “Do you know something”?



I turned to look where his gaze fell. His eyes never moved away from the back door down the hall. “No, son. I’m just thinking about that couch and my talks with Herman. We would stay out there for hours in the night. Just us and more than a couple of bottles”.



“Bottles of what?” I wondered aloud.



“Bottles.”, he said with a monotone voice, and before I could ask him to clarify, Quentin placed his hand onto Trujillo’s shoulder. “Well, I think we’ve wasted enough of this boy’s time. It’s getting rather late and if we stay here any longer, my wife will be rather furious”.



“As will your husband, Trujillo”, Mary quickly added in. I watched as they all stood up, took their coats, and then walked out of the door.



“Goodnight Jeremy. Lock this door, please?”, Quentin said as he closed the door behind him.

I watched them walk away, and then split off into different houses across the street. I had a weird feeling coming up. Trujillo barely spoke and the minute he does, Quentin makes them all leave. I get it, some people just don’t speak but there was something about Trujillo that made me think I should open up that back door and see what was out there.

Up until this night, I never went out the back. On the drive, I didn’t see anything out there in the backyard. The clean house made me think that Grandpa just kept his backyard as neat as his house. But as I opened up that cool to the touch glass and wooden door, I saw it. The green couch in the backyard. It looked like it was picked straight out of the store, clean and seemingly immune to the elements. It was as if the fog was avoiding it, refusing to even obscure the couch. Then there was the heat. I could feel it slowly warming the front of my body. It was 48 Fahrenheit outside but this green couch was insanely hot enough to reach me from 20 feet away. 

I stepped through the threshold, curious. A strange sound happened behind me as soon as my left foot landed onto the grass in the backyard. A mixture of clicks and chimes like some ancient instrument playing a foul note. I looked behind me and saw nothing but the sun resting on the horizon, its soft orange light making the miles and miles of amber grasses glow. 

The house was gone. The white square fence and the green couch was still there with all of its heat. But my Grandpa’s house, my car, the entire neighborhood was gone. 

Despite all the pinching, I was not waking up from this dream where winter became warm muggy summer. In my increasing panic, I was trying to think of what to do. But before I could make any sort of plan, I heard a roar in a distant forest, and when I saw the trees crashing over, I started to panic. 

Something was aware that I was here, and it was absolutely pissed about it. A cold sweat started on my forehead, and it felt hard to breathe. Panicking, I mindlessly turned to the couch as if it would save me and saw them.

Trujillo’s bottles. I could hear the roar coming closer, stomping heavy stomping towards me. I picked one up at random, it was unlabeled and warm. The liquid inside was a burgundy red, with gray specks floating around inside. The stomping was now close enough for me to feel the vibrations. I didn’t know what to do. My brain was thinking of a thousand meaningless things. 

Was time passing the same back home? How would One Piece end? I never wrote a book. I never kissed anyone yet. Would that chick text me back? Would my asshole roommate back home ever stop using my books as a fucking ashtray?

All these stupid thoughts combined in an instant into the only thing that made sense in that moment. 

I turned around and threw the bottle at whatever creature was behind me. I think maybe it was the adrenaline or maybe it was my mind demanding a solution. Either way, I watched as the bottle flew towards it in slow motion. 

The creature looked like tv static, an amorphous blob of black and white shivering. It’s very being making my clothes and my body hair thrust forward toward it. The sinking sun’s light seemed to be swallowed by it, like it had many hungry mouths sucking in all the light it could get. I couldn’t really get a good grip on its shape, it all looked like it blended together. 

But something in my lizard brain could recognize that it was reaching out to me with a wide grasp. I felt like my head was going to explode from the stress, my body was itchy and painful. This was it, I’m going to die. 

And then the bottle hit, the glass shattered into a glitter, and the red liquid carved through the body of the thing causing it to let loose a wet shriek that covered me head to toe. 

By the time I realized I was covered in wet gunk that smelled like shit, the thing was gone. The trees in the forest were moving again, I could only guess it retreated back there. I stood up, and looked at the bottle of… stuff that saved my life. 

It wasn’t burgundy red anymore, it was now lime green. The same shade as the couch. I turned around to the couch and saw something strange. You would think at this point, I’d be rolling with the weirdness, but I could never have expected to see that Trujillo’s bottles were hooked up to the couch with these little metal spigots. The couch was pumping out this mystery juice. 

It smelled like vinegar and puke, and now it was gathering into a puddle on the floor where the missing bottle was. It slowly ate away at the dirt, a splotch shaped hole sinking into the earth. I definitely wasn’t going to touch it.

I spent some time, 20 minutes give or take, trying to make my heart stop boxing my ribcage and thinking about what to do. I kept looking at how there was miles of dirt everywhere except for the forest where the monster came from. I could choose a random direction of dirt to head in and hope there would be something or I could head into the one place that had danger so that I could find SOMETHING. 

I decided on the forest since I didn’t like the idea of my skeleton cartoonishly being blown by the wind somewhere in the dust. 

I don’t know how long the walk took, but the sun was nearly gone when I entered the forest. Light pollution was something that I always forgot existed. Spending most of my life in towns had cemented in my head the idea the world was just perpetually bright always. The obvious was now surrounding me; light pollution was real and it was not here to help me now. The forest was dark, the only light being the fading sunshafts above me. 

I didn’t know what I was doing or what I should be doing until my foot stepped into something warm. I felt a small shock climb up my right leg, gone as fast as it came. I looked down and saw the static trail left behind from the monster. I followed it, making sure to avoid stepping into any more of the fading television liquid. The soft hum of the static growing louder the more I wandered deeper into the woods. 

When the sun was finally gone, leaving me with nothing but trees and the soft white light from the blood, I heard a ringtone further in. I didn’t understand the Japanese but I knew by the song it was Grandpa’s phone. A short while later and I came up onto the remains of a destroyed cabin. There was a tiny light resting on what looked like an air mattress. The screen on the phone read, “Marque”. 



I picked up the phone and whispered a “Hello”?



“Jeremy, listen. Don’t even talk. You need to find a blanket that has a dark blue panther on it. If it’s not in the cabin, it’s out the backdoor in the neighborhood somewhere. Once you have the blanket, go back to the couch”.

My hairs started to stand. The hum of the static growing louder.



“Trujillo? What the fuck is happening? What’s going on”?By the time I said “going”, Trujillo had hung up and I could feel the back of my shirt being gently tugged. I jumped over the lime green air mattress, and quickly searched the cabin. 

The living room, what was left of it, only had the mattress and a mini fridge. The kitchen was clean and the cabinets only had polished dishes. When I rushed into the bedroom, it looked like a near 1 to 1 duplicate of Grandpa’s guest room. Popcorn ceiling, a fan with a broken light bulb, and that same itchy rug that made getting out of the twin bed uncomfortable. The static was getting more painful, I frantically pulled out drawers, looked under the bed, and the closet. No blanket. Before I left to run out of the backdoor, there was a note under the lightswitch near the guest room door. It said,“1: HFWF2 2: ItTakesBraveryToLive”.

I should have taken the note but fizzy anxiety was drowning my brain. At that moment, I just wanted to be away from the static. When I finally got out of the house, I saw the neighborhood. Grandpa’s neighborhood. It looked nearly exactly  how I remembered it, save for the fact that it was surrounded by the woods. 

Before I could question it, my legs were carrying me toward the suburb but in my fervor to get away from the monster, my foot got caught in a small hole. I tripped and fell all the way down the hill. Every few seconds, I felt nature punch me in a new spot. When I reached the end of the slope, the pain felt like it was a mixture of thorns and burns but a mixture of annoyed, adrenaline, and anger forced me up into the street.

My body felt sore and it felt like bones would poke my skin in a threatening way if I stepped wrong, and with every step I could see droplets of red fall onto the asphalt. It was definitely the pain, the focusing to stay awake that distracted me from what was happening. The wood creaked, the glass shattered and reformed, the street signs had their letters morph into new ones. That didn’t matter to me, at that moment I was nothing more than a simple machine with one order in its head. Keep stepping forward.

I should’ve known that when a house appeared in front of me that things were wrong. I mindlessly opened the door, desperate for rest, and stepped inside. My shoes were off and on the rack, and I found my way to the rug that my father picked up off the street and cleaned. I didn’t know how to let myself gently down so I just fell onto my face. Familiar feel and smell, the rug made falling asleep in my childhood home easy. Better than any sleeping pill.

In my foggy dreams that night, I saw my Grandfather Herman. He was impaled on a cross spear in the middle of some graveyard, the flag of his nation draped over him. His eyes were wildly alive, darting from place to place until he finally saw me. He mouthed something to me, something I knew to be important, but when I woke up I couldn’t remember what he was trying to tell me. I was still hurt but I forced myself up when I heard Grandpa’s phone ringing again. In the kitchen, on the countertop next to multigrain bread was the phone. Instead of “Marque”, this one was from Quentin. 



“You alright, son?” Quentin asked as I put the phone on speaker. 



“No. I don’t know what’s going on and I’m badly hurt”.



“I knew this would happen. I should have warned you but who would believe an old man when he brings up magic”?



“Quentin, I don’t care at this point. I need medical help and I don’t think there’s doctors in this weird silent hill rip off”.



“Do me a favor and tell me a bad memory of yours”.



“What”?



“Just tell me, Jeremy. A bad memory. Were you bullied? Did you ever get dumped”?



Feeling more of myself pouring out, my body threatening to collapse. I blurted out the first thing that came to mind. “Juan in the first grade stole my limited run card of Terrence Phobos. I remember seeing him take it but I didn’t say anything because”. I breathed in wrong, started coughing. 

Quentin sounded panicked and urged me to continue, “Please, son. Finish your memory”.



“I didn’t confront him because Juan was the only kid in class who’d talk to me. I thought being friends with someone like me meant that things like that happened. Like I had to pay a tax to have friends”.



Quentin quickly asked me, “How did that make you feel? Did you ever get over it”?

 I remember answering this before when I went to therapy after what happened in December 2017. I told Quentin the same thing I told my therapist,



“It made me feel pathetic. Then I got angry about it. I was angry that I let myself be hurt just to have someone spend time with me. I decided a week later that I deserved better, that I am better even if everyone in that class thought I was a loser. I never got that card back but Juan never tried anything after I told him off and dumped milk on his head”.

Then, my body felt a warm, almost burning sensation. It started from my feet all the way to my head, culminating in a headache. 

Quentin must have heard me groaning because he started chuckling a bit. He asked, “Feel better”?

I checked myself and I was still hurt but now I wasn’t leaking all over the place. “Yeah”, I answered, “I do feel better. I’m still hurt but now I’m not bleeding. My head feels funny though”.

Quentin stopped chuckling and said, “I’m on limited time but I’m glad I could help you. Listen, it’s not gonna be easy but you need to do it. Especially if you ever want to get out”.

Before I could ask what “it” was, Quentin hung up. I tried picking up the phone to keep this time, maybe try to call Quentin back, but I felt a squish in my hands when I gripped it. The “phone” was a cake. I didn’t know how to feel. I just laughed a bit. Spending all those nights studying, I never would have guessed I’d be here in this situation. It wasn’t the weird static monster or the 1 to 1 replica of my Grandpa’s neighborhood. It was the fact that I was back in the kitchen where I watched my Father cook dinner every night. Everything was how I remembered it.

Except for the door at the end of the hall. When I climbed the stairs to visit my old room, I saw a dirty steel door, and it was cracked open. Frozen, I must have stared at that door for what felt like hours, but in reality was a few minutes. In that time, I watched as the door slowly creaked open. Enough to have the light show off what looked like a closet with a blanket inside. The dark blue panther blanket.

But when I walked forward to pick up the blanket, I felt the air die with each step. The air smelled stale, my skin prickled whenever I moved, and there was no sound. The sensation grew stronger the closer I got to the blanket Trujillo commanded me to retrieve, and when I reached for it the front of the house was sucked into a typhoon of splintered wood and ruptured metal. Then it was blown back towards me as I heard the roar of the thing that had been hunting me since I was trapped here. 

I didn’t need to look back to confirm the thing’s presence, I could feel the shocking and stinging grasp of it reaching out for me. I ran towards the steel door, and rushed inside to grab the blanket. When my hand felt the soft embroidered panther, my stomach felt a jump like when you’re in a fast elevator and it starts going down. The sound outside died as the door slammed shut. When I looked up from that short moment, I was back near the couch. Miles of dirt and amber grasses with the sun rising into the sky. Worrying about the monster somehow rushing back to me, I sat down on the couch with the blanket. Another series of clicks and chimes played and when I blinked, I was somewhere new.

A dark forest, the only source of light being the moon and a computer sitting on a desk in front of me. This is where I’ve been for… however long I’ve been here. I can’t really tell since the moon and it’s night feel like it never moves but it doesn’t feel long. It hasn’t been long enough for my body to completely heal, I’m still sore whenever I move in any way that doesn’t involve lying down on the warm couch, and strangely enough I’m not hungry or thirsty. Neither Quentin, nor Trujillo have contacted me, and the computer only has one app.

This app. What you’ve/I’ve been reading. A blank white page that I’ve been using to record how I got here, what I’ve been doing, and whatever else that comes to mind. In other words, I’ve been living through it a hundred, thousand, million times both awake and asleep. If I’m not asleep on the lime green couch, exploring the forest, then I’m writing here. 

It would be mundane but recently I’ve been losing time. Everyday (night?) I wake up, I feel like something is missing from my head. I feel like they’re important so I’ve just been writing down any and everything that I think is important. It all feels like random bullshit but I’m scared of losing everything that I am. Especially because it feels like someone is leaving me notes when I check the computer. Sometimes they’re in the middle of a sentence or they’re a whole entry by itself. 

Today’s note is the reason I’ve sat down and rewrote all of this. It was after I was writing about how I saw a light in the woods that I saw it at the end of the page. 

Herman Fabacher is alive. Don’t trust your family. Don’t trust anyone.
