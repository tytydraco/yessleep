When we designed our house, my wife insisted the master bedroom have large glass paneled walls for a wide view of the beautiful scenery.  I was an architect with the resources, so it was doable, plus I would do anything for her.

The first couple years were wonderful.  Watching movies on the couch late into the night, eating great food, sex all the time, plus friends would come by to spend weekends with us on occasion.  It was the best of times.  

During one visit, one of my wife’s co-workers, who was a mycologist from Seattle, showed me how to identify magic mushrooms growing pretty much in our backyard.  Living in the Pacific NW they are apparently very common, which I didn’t know.  

The penultimate night happened when we found some- Blue Meanies I think he called them- and the three of us had an amazing night sipping mushroom tea.  I had a feeling in my gut that things couldn’t get any better than this, that this was just another chapter in life; you read it then pause, hesitating to turn the next page out of fear.  That night changed me in ways I didn't understand at the time.

Our relationship started to sour shortly after, my wife accepted a full-time job in the city and was barely ever home.  The long commutes, she’d spend nights at work instead of coming home, or they would put her up in a hotel for “meetings”.  I would get depressed during her absence, and the house reminded me of how great and fun living here with her used to be.  I missed it deeply, and prepared myself for the worst.  I felt something coming.

I came home from work one afternoon and noticed my wife packing her belongings into her truck.

"What's going on?" I asked.

"Let's go inside and talk." she said, solemnly.

We walked through the garage to the kitchen, I made some coffee and sat down at the table to have this talk.  She spoke first.

“I don’t love you anymore, Xavier.”

“Since when??”

“I don’t want to lie, but I can’t tell you the truth right now; but it is over.”

That’s all she said, but I sensed this coming; her absence indicated to me she was seeing someone else- that mycologist from Seattle I suspected.  I knew what she was going to say next before she said it.

“My divorce attorney will call you within the next couple weeks.”

I knew it. I was devastated.

She had been absent so often, I changed the deadbolt on the door to the garage just to see if she would notice.  For months her text replies were always the same, “I’m staying late at work again, sorry baby.”

I designed this house for her; the kitchen I faced eastward, so the morning sun illuminated the interior.  The bathroom I installed a dim light setting so she could pee in the middle of the night, the master bedroom was constructed of large glass panels like she asked for.  There was even a jacuzzi on the back deck.  All for her. 

*I recalled the mornings when the sun lit up her beautiful face in such a way, she’d smile and sip coffee, chatting with friends on her MacBook.  This memory I’ll miss the most.  She seemed so happy then, I was confused.*

“I’m leaving the kitchen stuff; you keep it.” 

“Thanks, I guess…”  I said, sulking into the table.

Those Hanikamu knives I bought for her were expensive, and all the fancy appliances, but they can never replace my wife.

She looked at her phone and said, “I have to head out. Goodbye, Xavier.”

I held out the key for the new deadbolt lock when she realized her key didn’t work.  She turned and looked at me strangely.

I remained frozen in the chair, I was so distraught; she had to walk over to me to get the key.

*I tried to remain hopeful that things could still work out...*

A couple weeks later, I awoke to a glorious April morning, it was finally warm and the air smelled sweet outside.  I hugged my wife with a new sense of purpose, *and I really needed to clean.*  I opened the windows to let out the odors that accumulated in the house over the past couple weeks and was hit with the sweet scent of spring*.*  

We didn't do much during those two weeks besides lay around and have sex, watch movies occasionally, and sleep for hours.

I brewed coffee, Seattle Brewing Co. medium roast (my wife’s favorite) and paused to gaze at her beautiful face in the morning sun.

Yet her smile was slowly turning into a frown.  A little massaging brought back the smile. 

I also noticed, her face was changing color, which concerned me.  I didn’t say anything at the time, but instead finished washing the dishes, taking special care to place her clean ginsu knives on the counter; they are very expensive, and *sharp*. 

I turned my phone off the two weeks after that conversation we had the day she packed up her truck, now in the garage.  Work knew I needed some PTO, so they didn't bother me, but I had received voicemails from my wife’s lawyer, Jonathan somebody.

“Xavier, this is Jonathan. Please call me back. Thank you.”

I put the phone down, made my wife and I breakfast, but she didn't touch hers.

"Sweetie, you need to eat."

She continued smiling, still not saying a word.  This is actually pretty nice; I liked the silent mornings.

By late afternoon though, the open windows and cleaning did nothing for the lingering odor.

I had no choice but to reunite my wife's once beautiful head with her torso.  I created a small plot in the forest to bury her.  I marked the spot with a small cross I constructed from two pieces of scrap wood.  On the way back I spotted a few bunches of mushrooms; Wavy Caps, I think they’re called.  Not the same variety I tried before, and these were very big.

I gathered up a bunch and ate some that night.  These were much more powerful than the tea from before.

A few days later, I collected more mushrooms when I visited my wife’s grave.  In fact, large clusters of mushrooms grew around the disturbed soil in that short amount of time.  I gathered up more in my arms; I’d have to come back to get the rest there were so many.

I ate a handful and laid in bed, after only 15 minutes my vision swirled intensely, I felt like I was underwater.  After a couple hours I reached a plateau and things calmed down a bit.  I put on some ambient music and tried to get comfortable. 

I reached a deeply spiritual place, which was a bit frightening too.  I felt like I was on the precipice of insanity, but if I remained calm I could go deeper into the ether.  Then, a knock at the front door jolted me out of my headspace. 

Who could be coming by at this hour?  I was in no condition to answer, so I checked via the front door camera.  I only saw someone walking away, as blurred as my vision was with geometric patterns.

Only a few minutes went by, but it felt like an eternity.  Who was it that knocked on the door?  Could it be the authorities?  Oh god, I prayed not.

Then another knock jolted me up again, but this time it came from the window across from the bed.  

I opened the curtains slowly.

Standing on the other side of the glass was my wife, holding her rotting head in her arms, banging it against the glass.  Thump, thump, thump, it continued into the night.
