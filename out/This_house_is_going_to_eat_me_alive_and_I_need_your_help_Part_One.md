I'll first say hi. I'm Tashia. I've been living in this house for 1 month, 15 days, 10 hours, 36 minutes and 24 seconds. I've felt like keeping count because what has happened so far in this house. I've seen things in the corner of my eye. Every time I wake up, I feel a pain behind my eye, like something is trying to claw out. I should mention, just for transparency, I am mentally ill. I have something called derealisation. This makes it hard to discern reality or a dream, but I'm on meds. Barbiturates, quetiapine, amitriptyline, and others. Those are the main ones though. I should know what is going on around me, unless these meds have problems then let me know. So right now, I'm writing this, to you on the other side of the screen, as a diary of sorts. Understand that this is not your regular situation. I think this house is going to eat me alive...

Let's start by saying I've felt uncomfortable for a while. I've been in the house since January 10th, today it's the 25th of February. I don't know how to describe the feeling of living in my old house, but I'll try to describe it. 

It’s been a couple of days since I wrote in any form of diary last - I think three days, and I don't know what it is today. I just don't feel right. Maybe it's the silence in the house, maybe it's the lack there of some nights. I felt like I’ve skimped on my writing because of everything that’s happened, but it’s helped with processing things. It’s been quiet - no bumps in the night, but god the suspense is killing me. I’m always waiting for something to happen, I feel like an owl - perched and ready to spot any danger. Eyes in the back of my head, that sort of thing. 

I miss the lack of silence though. It reminds me of my parents, my dad quiet a lot to be honest. My dad used to tell me that the tapping on the walls was just old pipes moving and groaning, that the veins of the house were just pumping it's blood with the hearth being, you guessed it, the heart of the house. The image of the house being a family member, a part of the house - the living organism that protects you from the elements, has always stuck in my mind.

I used to imagine cracking open the plaster and brick and unleashing a sea of blood, the house crying and screaming to stop - begging me to seal the veins. But when I did it as an adult, as I renovated my house, I remembered those words. The anticipation of opening the house up to reveal something I couldn’t possibly imagine in my years of life. Of course, I painted and did things around the house - but I never took the step to break the walls open. Maybe it was the fear of the sentience of the house fighting back. And what was on the other side shocked me. It was wood, asbestos and rusted pipes. I thought my dad was dumb. I wish I could have told him before he died. 

My mum did most of the work in our old house. Red lodge. It was a large house, with a circular window in the attic. I tried to recreate it, just so I had memories of my now distant siblings all cradling me as a child, protecting me from my own dying body, but to no avail. It's the small things, ain't it? It's the things that make you want to stay in a home. Like a warm snuggly or a hot water bottle close to your feet in the bed.

But I needed to do some adult things today - even if I was off and still felt like a young child. I can't keep the 3 week old shirt on, I'm starting to smell like shit - even after a long, steamy bath. So I went to the shed, where the washing machine and drying machine is. The way the smell was sucked into my nostrils, deflating the air in my lungs, makes me want to wretch even now. 

It's that smell of iron and rotting eggs. Of chicken and pork marinading in their own rotting juices. Of decay and sadness. Like failure to act, and failure to realise. A failure to realise you needed to sleep before driving. But, that smell lingers like a whisper in my mind. It reminded me of all of the dead in the house. 

After… what has happened so far, I had to research everything - if anything had happened in the house like what happened to me. The neighbour warning me with those kind blue eyes is like a screw being driven into my brain. I can’t escape it. But I found something darker then I could possibly imagine, and I feel like I have to say this sick shit. Otherwise I will let it fester in my mind - never escaping me. I’m folding clothes, so don’t mind my poor handwriting.

'73. John Crane. Found in the shed. He started with peeling the skin of the youngest of the two kids like apples. The whole family were tied up so they could see. Weirdest part though - he didn't even cover their mouths. The mother, the son and the daughter. They all screamed, screamed, bargained and watched as he'd skin each and every last one. He made them listen to the same record. Over. Over. Over. The needle must have been worn. The grooves sagging. Now, because this is all I can picture it in my minds eye, all that could be heard was a malformed voice singing the lyrics of love with the voice of an angel. 

*I need your love. I need your love. God, speed your love to me.*

He ate most of the fingers. Cracking; breaking; and tearing all of the meaty and tasty parts. Did you know the webbing has a lot of nutrition and taste? Well, the taste part is true, apparently. Like sloppy chicken skin in a roast Sunday dinner in texture, it's all I can think. Gelatinous and full of flavour. They found the contents in his stomach post-mortem. After he skinned the bodies in the shed, he took them in the house. He cleaned for what must have been hours. The house was tidy. Like nothing had happened. He carefully took apart their muscle structures, the squelching and the moist tissue oozing with blood. 

The leather hook came out as he stitched them together one by one. You could taste the preserver, the iron oxide and the smell of fresh meat. He took the son's hands, still attached to his body, and stitched them to the mother's temples. The mother's forehead was attached to the daughter's sternum, permanently looking up at her darling angel. They were all still alive, somehow. 

What was left was a congealed, insectoid-like creature. They were still breathing somewhat, a wheeze and a buzz came from it. He attached wooden wings to the mothers side, killing her slowly. He had seen them as flies, a disgusting mess of buzzing noise - so he made them exactly like that. He doodled and drew a similar thing in his found diaries. 

They were, apparently, *the true image of god’s angels*. A sweet Christian man turned psychotic. Police found the bodies. The children were still alive, wheezing, pleading. Every part of the crime scene was clean. Beautiful. Spotless. The blood was only under their bodies with a circle of salt and the rest of the room was cleaned. The only thing left was the bodies. The police dirtied the scene with their stomach bile and flem.

The only part that had a proportional amount of blood was what he did to himself. No one knows, just urban legends. The only thing known is that no one could take pictures, because they'd either throw up or try to kill themselves on the closest object that was sharp. Any survivors would only talk about a vivid dream that felt like being in another world. The cleaners all drugged themselves to death, but they did a fine job. In the shed.

‘74. Louise Coleman. She was a lovely lady, she and her boyfriend just bought the house because she was pregnant. Wanted to spend the rest of her life there. It was a shock then when her husband found her with the lemon bleach and forehead. She was in her third trimester, the baby would probably be the size of a watermelon. The blood ooze of her insides leaked on the floor out of her stomach and groin, the bleach disintegrated her body from the inside out. 

She also took the acid, hydrogen peroxide I think, and drank it just in case. Her jaw collapsed and her bare ribcage showed burnt tissues, organs and congealed burnt blood. She blended into the walls like a piece of nature, a vine growing on the surface of the floral patterned wall in the kitchen back room. 

She could have run, the shoe rack was right next to her, but she decided to end herself. End herself for what though? And that’s when the scar made sense. *In here*, it read. Another happy Christian woman lost her mind and decided that life wasn’t worth living. She cut herself, multiple times on the wrist. 

Some blood on the floor read *Don't trust the voices.* Blood runes were drawn on the floor all around it, apparently looking like some occult image. The husband, an avid hunter - I know as I have a collection of muntjacks and rabbits taxidermied on the walls, grabbed his sniper. I can only imagine he loaded the bullet and held the barrel in his mouth. He shot himself, the blood painting the walls. In the shed.

‘75. Ulrich Granger. Hung himself with some guitar strings. He held a note in his hand begging for forgiveness because of what he had done. Police found pictures of dogs and cats all over his wall. Shaved, ribs showing, and some runes on their head. All panting, screaming for air. The bathroom was his little torture chamber and red room art studio. His lifeless eyes bulged as the bunch of coated bronze acoustic 52 gauge guitar strings ripped and popped the skin cells, like the sound of a stick and poke tattoo. It would have had to lacerate his neck, right? Bleeding and choking. A little tattoo studio, in the shed.

‘78. Diane Olsen. She was sweet, until she started hiding the bodies. The children would speak of the wicked witch's house, but they never expected it to be true. Like Hansel and Gretel, she would lore them in and feed them poison in sweets, stuff them with food and leave them in the shed wall. 

You could see the stretched marks of hands and legs, presumably early on in the killings, but as the murder list stacked up you could see their faces, slightly poking through the wall paper. Faces of pain and agony. The first one they found was the youngest. She was only four, Betty. At least she got to see her mum one last time. 

Fuck. I heard she was in and out the hospital, when Betty turned two. Diane poisoned herself, her eyes wide and stretched with clothes line pegs and bloated, purple skin. She felt she needed to be close to the bodies I guess, so she was found next to the washing machine, in the shed.

'79. Elizabeth Banks. A bit less brutal this time. She just stuffed her mouth with a plastic pipe from the washing machine. She had milky eyes and tears as the hose reached down her throat, enough to bulge. Her mouth and teeth clenched on the plastic little grooves. 

She wanted something inside of her stomach to crawl out, she felt like there was an evil snake eating her from the inside, according to her diary. *Wriggling, unrelenting and devouring my intestines and soul*. 

That’s how she described it. Next to this page was some runes and repeated words saying, *They’re in my head, they’re in my nightmare*. It was strange, apparently this house has the same runes popping up all the time. She was alone with a note saying.

*I'm sorry. I tried my best. But it got to me.*

Police ruled it a suicide. In the shed. 

'84. Harriet Crane. Sister of John Crane. She heard the voices too. She felt herself losing her sanity, as she became more and more disturbed and horrific. She didn't want to end up like him, a sick sadistic fuck who could murder such innocent lives. 

Who could ever imagine wanting too? She seemed so scared of becoming him in the note, according to the report. So, after spending 2 nights in the house, she shot herself. She had a note, with a picture of herself. The note said *They’re inside my head, I have to get them out*. The picture showed the veins in her head. She used the 44. Magnum she kept in her car, and she stayed in the shed.

'87. Violet Russian. She died of a massive brain aneurysm. Blood was all in the scene, over everything. A massive nose bleed that probably went in her mouth and probably made her cough and choke on her blood. It was everything that people fear, a sea of blood leaving your system as your unable to fight it. 

Fuck, it terrifies me writing it. An uncontrollable death that one cannot escape, natural and yet completely unnatural in the face of what is seen as death. But she was somehow, without explanation, conscious enough to write.

*Run. Never come ba*

She never got to complete her final words on this plane, in the she

What the fuck just happened?  

I don’t really know what happened next after writing this, I’m still in a bit of a haze. I remember that I realised where I was. And I ran. I ran. Yes. Yes. I did. I ran. And ran. And yet everytime I would step close enough to touch the gate doors. I was in the shed. Anytime I'd touch the doors to the house. In the shed. Sometimes before I'd touch the door to the side gate. In the shed. In the exact spot I wanted to run from. My feet were muddy and worn. Sweat beads drops onto the floor. 

My hazy, drowsy eyes lifted and closed. I don't remember exactly what happened next, but what I do remember is waking up and it being bright. Before I started to run, it was dark. I slept, I must have - right? I felt a sting, and then I looked at my arm. Runes were cut into my arms. There was no sign of blood or any tool, so I don’t know how it happened - if it did really happen anyway.

The runes looked old, ancient. Beyond a mere mortals understanding of time, like before the creation of the designer of this grand space of nothingness we call the universe. It sort of hazed in and out of existence, blurring and distorting my vision. I thought to myself, Fuck. What is this? But when I heard a creak of the stairs and a noise of rasping breathing, I looked up to see nothing. My eyes traced quickly back to my arm, and they were gone. It still stings, but it’s nowhere to be seen. 

With each day that passes in this house, I feel less and less like I am home. This isn’t home for me, it’s a death sentence. No, I can’t say things like that. I’m fine. I’ll be fine. I just need to concentrate and stay calm. But I can’t - I can’t concentrate anymore. What is this and who am I now? Okay, what did Dr. Pratt say? Breathe in for 7 second, hold for 4, out for 8. Okay. Give me two seconds. I'll try to write tonight.

It's night now. I’m sorry, but it’s all too much. All I can concentrate on is that feeling in the shed. All I remember is that sensation of being watched. Like someone kept a keen eye on me. It was multiple, maybe? I came back to the house, no problems this time. I started writing this, the doctor said to keep a diary - fuck, I've already said this. It's fine, right? I can repeat myself? I'll write again tomorrow, if I remember or have the patience to do it. It's been a long day. A really long fucking day.
