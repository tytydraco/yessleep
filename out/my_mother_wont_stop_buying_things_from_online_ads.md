When I got the news of Mom getting into an accident, I dropped everything to make the five-hour drive home from college back to our hometown to be there for her. The dingy, unkempt small town hospital stank of antiseptic, and the annoyed nurses finally gave in to my incessant begging to see Mom only after interrupting their gossip at the nurses’ station for the fifth time. To my great relief, she was in much better condition than my frantic sister had led me to believe during our midnight phone call, which had alerted me to the situation.   
  
There she was, a small heap of thin linen sheets and hospital gowns crumpled up under a precariously shaky table tray of bland cafeteria food. I’d never thought about Mom’s mortality before, taking for granted that she would always be there to welcome me home on school holidays or send money for my birthday. So when I finally saw her after that long trip home, panicking at every thought that the world was without one more comforting hug, I teared up.   
  
“What are you doing here?” Mom asked, looking annoyed. “Did you come home over this? You’ve got school to worry about; you didn’t have to come all this way over this rubbish.”   
  
“Mom,” I choked, coming to her bedside, “Vanessa said you had to stay overnight in the hospital. I came as soon as I heard about it.”  
  
“Oh, my God,” She groaned, rolling her eyes. “Your sister is so overdramatic, along with all these doctors. I’m fine! Some asshole didn’t know how to use his blinker on the freeway, and we got in a little accident.”  
  
Seeing that my mother was in absolutely no danger at all, full of her usual vim and vinegar, my misty eyes all but absorbed my tears back like a sponge. While I was flooded with relief, I couldn’t help but fall back into our old talking habits.  
  
“Your car was flipped over,” I said dryly, “The firefighters had to cut you out. Vanessa sent me the pictures.”  
  
“So my hip is a little fractured, so what?!” Mom flung her hands up in frustration. “I want to get back to doing things, I refuse to sit around and be waited on hand and foot like some layabout!”  
  
“Bad news for you, then,” I chuckled, pulling forward one of the chairs in the room to sit at her bedside. “You’re gonna be a layabout for at least a few months, unless you decide to try riding horseback tomorrow. Then you’ll probably be a layabout for a year.”

Mom visibly deflated. The entire time I had conscious memory of her, she had never been one to sit still. Always the type to be worrying about one thing or stressing over the next, my childhood was a flurry of her darting from room to room with one project or another. One summer it was all about home-canning pickled goods and meat, the next winter would be learning how to make (ugly) clothes for me and my sister, and then in spring it would be plans for going on family outings. It wasn’t until my early high school years that I had the lazy pleasure of visiting a friend's house to play a video game or watch the latest episode of Survivor. Television, much less wireless internet, had never played a role in my life. It’d been something of a culture shock going to college and realizing pen and paper were not considered sufficient note-taking tools. I had never seen Mom enjoy a show or log into an email. Even the TV in her hospital room, coated with a thick layer of dust, was a silent obelisk with the remote nowhere in sight. Watching her sulk, knowing how miserable she thought her life was going to be for the next few months, I decided a small sacrifice was in order. 

I pardoned myself to my car, then quickly returned with a thin device and a small black box. Mom was way overdue to get familiar with modern technology, and I decided that the iPad I had gotten for school but never used was the perfect introduction. It took an embarrassingly long time to explain how to use it, and that the black box was a magical device called a “hot spot” for endless connectivity. After several long, exhausting hours of repeated explanations combined with the drive to get there, I was ready to pass out. As I got up to leave, a passing nurse shot me a glare of disdain from the hallway. I felt a tug at my sleeve. 

“I don’t know about this, honey,” Mom murmured, showing an unusually vulnerable expression of discomfort. “This sort of thing isn’t really me.”

“I know, Mom,” I patted her hand, giving her a half-hearted smile of reassurance. “Look, I’ll make a deal with you,”

I thought for a moment about what I could promise her to make her look forward to recovery, something that would make her stay still long enough to ensure she wouldn’t get hurt again. 

“When you’re better,” I grinned, “I’ll… take you white water rafting?”

“I’m not a fan of that,” Mom rolled her eyes.

“Okay, then, mountain climbing. We’ll put your healed hip to the test.”

“It’s a deal.” She scoffed, nodding. With that, I leaned over the bed to kiss her forehead and poked her screen to turn on a random YouTube video to get her started. 

The rest of my night was uneventful. Returning to my childhood home, the only things I was interested in were a shower and my bed. In the morning, Vanessa greeted me on the way out of her bedroom, her matching satin pajamas putting my old holey t-shirt and shorts to shame. We sat down for breakfast after I cooked using what ingredients I could scrounge from the old, noisy fridge. In the daylight, I could appreciate the coziness of Mom’s home. Clean and well-kept, lived in but not untidy. It smelled of her perfume, with family photos crammed into every inch of the walls; all our memories were on display. It was a good childhood, I decided, even if Crash Bandicoot or Spyro didn’t exist for me at the time.

“Do you think we should tell Dad?” Vanessa quietly probed over her cup of coffee and my awful attempt at a basic cheese omelet.

“No?” I balked, stifling a laugh of disbelief, “What does that prick have to do with any of this?” 

Our parents hadn’t been married since I was a baby. With Vanessa, a few years older than I, she at least had vague memories of a happy home. All I knew was that he was a cheating scumbag who didn’t deserve someone as badass as Mom. I’d had visitation, but was never interested in keeping contact. Vanessa, on the other hand, had kept up some semblance of a relationship with him. 

“Come on, don’t you keep tabs on your exes?” She asked, “Even if they haven’t been together for a long time, wouldn’t you want to know if something like this happened to someone you cared about at one point?” 

“Look, you can tell him,” I waved my hand dismissively, shoveling an undercooked egg into my mouth. “Just leave me out of it. Mom doesn’t need the stress or drama right now, anyway.”

I decided to stay home to make the house “broken-hip ready” while my mother underwent surgery and physical therapy in the hospital. Thankfully, I could take college classes from my laptop, meaning it wasn’t a big deal to miss out on school for the time being. Vanessa left on the third day; she had her own life to get back to, and her law office was far less forgiving than my university. It was when I was sweeping away freshly cut grass clippings off the front porch that a grumpy delivery driver scuttled up the front walkway, dropped off a package, and then scurried away halfway through my hello. Shrugging off their quick departure, I picked up and inspected the small box in my hands. It was addressed to Mom. 

The significance wasn’t lost on me that this was the first thing she had ever placed an order for online, and I couldn’t help but feel a sense of pride that she was able to get this far on her own. Setting it inside on the breakfast table where I knew she would find it later, I returned to my chore list. 

By the time my mother was able to return home, a few packages were waiting for her. As I eased her into her armchair, she bade me bring them to her. Like a Christmas morning, I watched eagerly as she opened the packages to reveal completely unexciting new items. A brand new mop and bucket that used more technology than necessary, a subscription box for a company selling succulents, a knitting machine with yarn, and the first, smallest box I had seen, a deck of playing cards.

“Getting into gambling now, Mom?” I joked as she set them aside. 

“Oh, well, I thought I might get into solitaire, or play with you for the meantime. They were running a deal online.” She shrugged, smiling at me. I set up the TV for her, having set up her internet only the day before, and went off to do more work around the house. 

The next few days, more packages started to arrive. Groceries from the local superstore megachain were purchased using the “plus membership” services. A revolutionary workout device that rotates your abdominals. Old Spice body washes.

“Mom, why did you even get these?” I asked, holding up the red packages of fragrances like “Fiji” and “Bearglove,” whatever that’s supposed to smell like. Mom chuckled, looking shy.

“Well, I found these old commercials online featuring that handsome celebrity, I just thought I’d support him since he seems like such a nice, young man.” She admitted with a blush. I rolled my eyes, but hey, who didn’t have a crush on that guy?

When the doorbell rang the next day, I opened it to see the same delivery driver as before, dark bags sagging below his eyes, using a truck dolly to wheel in a massive package. 

“Whoa, you sure that’s for us?” I chuckled nervously, looking up and down the sheer size of it. The driver stared at me, shoving a clipboard into my chest with more force than necessary.  
  
“Sign here,” He muttered. Perplexed, I did as he asked. He dropped off the package on the front porch and went back to his truck. Closing the door behind me, I paused for a moment, processing the interaction before going back to the living room.  
  
“Who was that, honey?” Mom asked, not looking up from scrolling on her phone. She’d stayed mostly in the same armchair since coming home, making it easy to find her when she wasn’t using the hospital-issued walker to get to and from the bathroom.   
  
“Delivery guy, he seemed to be in a bad mood for some reason. Hey, did you order something really big?”   
  
“Oh!” Mom straightened excitedly, “That must be the new fridge I ordered! Would you set it up for me?”  
  
“You ordered a new fridge?” I asked, surprised. Well, the one she had now was pretty noisy and several years old. Maybe the din was annoying to her, sitting fairly close to the kitchen as she was. “I’m not sure I can pull that thing in here on my own.”   
  
“Oh, don’t you worry about that! I ordered some of those LD-1000 furniture moving straps. Just ask the delivery man to help you move it in.”  
  
“Mom, I don’t think the delivery driver will help--”  
  
As I began to protest, the doorbell rang. I quickly went to open the door, finding the same person holding a dozen more packages on his moving dolly.   
  
“Can you just leave the door open?” He grumbled, “I’ve got a couple loads of these to drop off.”   
  
“Whoa, whoa-- just-- can you hold on a second?” I asked, bewildered. Leaving the door open, I moved back to the living room. “Mom, just how many things did you order?”  
  
“Oh, I lost count,” She waved me off. “Just have the young man leave the boxes inside, you can bring them to me later. What did he say about helping you move the fridge?”   
  
Stunned, I stuttered over some words that I couldn’t quite get through before the man at the door made his way inside, he glanced at me with a shrug before dropping off a heap of packages, and then returned to his truck only to come back with another stack he left inside the door. In my shock, I stopped him long enough to borrow the same truck dolly, wheeling in the new fridge to the kitchen before he stomped out of the house. The small flurry of activity done, I was left in the entryway staring at the double towers of packages.   
  
“Bring them over!” Mom called to me, sounding excited. Without a word, I started bringing over the boxes one by one. What was once a fun Christmas ritual now felt heavier. The first box of furniture moving straps set aside, she opened the next one to reveal a high-quality cat litter proven to change colors with the cats urine based on their health. As she grinned at the open package with wide eyes, turning it over in her hands, I spoke up.  
  
“Mom, you don’t own a cat.”   
  
As soon as the words left my mouth, her head jerked back and she shot a glare at me. Holding the package with clenched fists, her nostrils flared in anger.  
  
“So?” She huffed, “It was a good deal, and I was thinking of getting a cat, anyway. This would be perfect to set it up, don’t you think? I also got a self-cleaning litter box, so I was going to ask if you could go pick up a cat at the shelter for me.”  
  
“You can’t take care of an animal right now, Mom. You can’t even take care of yourself right now. That’s why I’m here.”   
  
“Well, I didn’t ask for you to stay here, now did I?” She snarled. I went quiet as she set aside the package of litter to open the next box. True to her word, it was a self-cleaning robotic litter box. Then it was a bulk package of Himalayan pink salt, a fan that goes around your neck, an organizer with built-in USB ports to charge devices, an ugly cooler that was considered better than other coolers because this one had wheels, a countertop hydroponic garden, and a luxury bag that claimed to fit more luggage than other bags on the market. Each opened box was a delighted squeal before she set it aside on a growing pile of purchases. The entire time I sat, feeling hurt and unsure of what to say to her. Once she was done, she went right back to scrolling her ipad, all while the TV in front of her played reruns of old shows and her phone charging next to her.   
  
I moved back to the kitchen and set about the task of taking everything out of the old fridge, unplugging it, and stuffing the new one back in its place. As I refilled the new fridge with some of the goods she’d had delivered from her grocery store membership, I realized just how much of it there was. Branded products I’d never seen her use in her life before, vegan non-meat patties stuffed next to the cheapest, 100% angus beef hamburger steaks and organic lemons mingling with unopened bottles of lemon juice concentrate. I glanced at the old fridge as I closed the doors of the new one, which had been beeping loudly to remind me it was still open. Poking my head around the corner, I could see mom bundled up on her armchair, giggling over a video and looking small.   
  
\*She’s just cranky because she can’t get up and move,\* I thought, dismissing my hurt. \*She didn’t mean it.\* She hadn’t, had she? Licking my lips in consideration and glancing again at the old fridge that, until now, had worked just fine for her, I decided I wasn’t in the mood to do her any more favors today. Grabbing my jacket and my keys, I made my way to the front door with a call over my shoulder that I’d be going for a walk.   
  
Mom didn’t reply.  
  
Making my way around the neighborhood, I stopped while leaning against the white picket fence of one of the others in the middle-upper-class area. I pulled out my phone, dialing Vanessa’s number.  
  
“What’s going on?” She asked as she picked up, “I’m at work, so I can’t talk long.”  
  
“Yeah, I figured, sorry,” I sighed, “It’s just-- I’m calling about mom.”  
  
“Why? Is everything okay?”  
  
“Don’t worry, her hip is fine, she’s just tired all the time.” I paused, running my fingers through my hair as my eyes traced the power lines cutting across the otherwise beautiful open air. A mark of human need in an otherwise perfect picture. “Hey, has mom ever talked to you about wanting a cat?”  
  
“Are you planning to get Mom an animal? That’s probably not a good idea until she’s at least mobile, but it might be nice for her to have a companion.”  
  
“No, has she ever told you she wanted one, herself?”   
  
“No,” She replied, sounding surprised. “Mom’s more of a dog person.”  
  
I didn’t say anything for a moment, mulling over this new piece of information. Thinking on it, Vanessa’s right. Mom never showed any interest in cats. As long as I’d known her, she’d always stopped every passerby with a dog to ask permission to say hello, and fawned over every poodle and labrador at the park.  
  
“What’s all this about?” Vanessa asked, “Is that all you called to ask me?”  
  
“No, um,” I shook my head free of my thoughts. “Something weird’s going on. Mom keeps ordering a bunch of stuff online.”  
  
“Well, that’s a good thing; it’s about time she got with the modern age.” In the background, I could hear a co-worker asking Vanessa something inaudible. She replied to them, then came back to the phone. “Sorry, I gotta go.”  
  
“Wait,” I cut in quickly, “I have to leave in a few days to take an exam back at school; they won’t let me do it online. Do you think you could come watch Mom while I’m gone?”   
  
“I don’t know if I can. There’s a case coming up that I have to be present for, I have to take care of my clients. Mom’ll be fine for a few days, she texted me to let me know she can walk around a bit more now.” Another interruption from someone else. I heard Vanessa swear quietly away from the phone. “Okay, I have to leave. You got this, love you.”  
  
With a click, the phone call was ended. I was left staring down at my phone screen at the last thing I’d been looking at online, a new set of pens for my schoolwork. My stomach twisted as I glanced back up the path that would lead me back home. In the distance, I could see storm clouds lazily making their way in the direction of town, set to ruin what I thought was going to be a sunny day. Closing the order I had been intending to make, I returned to the house with my gaze fixed on the sidewalk.   
  
The few days before I had to go back to school were tense. Every day I’d open the door to the same delivery driver, making me wonder if he ever got a day off. In all our contact I’d learned his name was Cody, and no, he never got a day off. The stacks of packages seemed smaller than before, and Mom hadn’t been nearly as snippy. She thanked me when I served her meals, helped her up from her nest, and seemed pleased with every new purchase. I hated the new fridge, beeping at me every time I opened the door, the sound of ice cubes falling inside jolting me away at night. The latter was something I could get used to, but it seemed the fridge had become a third person in the home, and it did not care about noise at all hours.   
  
When I offered to help mom set up some of the packages she’d gotten, like a bookshelf with drawers still taped up together in its box, she waved me off.  
  
“I’ll get around to it,” She said, her eyes glued to her iPad, “Once I’m all better.”   
  
The day came when I had to leave for school, and as I packed the last of my things into my car, I looked up at the house. Mom was now able to move around a lot more, albeit only in short bursts, and assured me she would be fine while I was away.   
  
“I bet I could order a robot online that does all the work, then I wouldn’t need you at all!” She’d said, laughing. I didn’t laugh with her, because she wasn’t even looking at me. Eyes fixed to the screen, deep bags setting in under her eyes, a grin plastered on her face as she clicked the one-click-buy option on whatever caught her fancy next. As I pulled away from the house, I saw the familiar delivery truck with Cody behind the wheel pulling in behind me.   
  
Coming back to my dorm room was something of a relief. It’d become so cluttered at mom’s house that being surrounded by my things, thankfully pretty sparse, I felt able to breathe for the first time in a while. Away from the house, I threw myself into my studies and meeting back up with friends, and though it was always at the back of my mind, I was able to put away my concerns about mom for a while. After I’d finished my final test, I checked my phone to see a missed call from my mom. Groaning quietly, I opened my voice mail, fully expecting another request regarding her newfound hobby.   
  
I didn’t expect the earsplitting wail of agony coming from my phone speakers. Mom was saying something, but it was muffled behind grotesque sobs. All I could make out were the words “Vanessa” and “help me.” Dread sank into my gut, I all but ran to my car while dialing 911.   
  
The drive to get there had me rocking back and forth in my seat at every stoplight, pushing the speed limit far beyond legal standards. As I pulled up to my childhood home to find police and an ambulance gathered, I stumbled out of my car.   
  
“What’s going on?” I asked, all but falling into the first police officer who would talk to me. Over his shoulder, I could see Cody speaking to the police, still in his delivery uniform. We made eye contact, and I could see the look of horror in his eyes as he registered my face. He looked away just as quickly, lip trembling as he tugged his hat down over his eyes.  
  
“I need you to step back,” The officer said, an expression of stoic discomfort on his face. “I’m very sorry, but we’ve confirmed a fatal incident inside the residence.”   
  
My stomach dropped, my eyes drifting over slowly to the open, wide front door of Mom’s house. Maybe it was my imagination, but I could swear I could see blood on the walls of the entryway.   
  
“The scene is secure,” The officer continued, “I’m going to need to ask you to stay behind the caution tape until we’ve completed our investigation.  
  
Fuck that. 

“Mom!” I screamed, ducking around him and bolting for the front door, ignoring the calls behind me to stop. What had been a straight shot indoors had become a maze of boxes, with towers reaching up to the ceiling full of unopened, worthless trinkets, and packaging paper crinkling underfoot as I made my way inside. I had to squeeze through a few stacks before I emerged out the other side into the living room, where several officers and a crime scene photographer stood, looking at me in surprise. “Mom…!”

The living room was the worst by far, with a mix of open and unopened packages, along with clumps of wadded tape discarded in the corner. Obnoxious neon green, red, and blue items are strewn all over. Gardening items, bottles of chemicals, cutlery all over the room, along with bundles of things I knew mom would never use. The floor was uneven from all the scattered boxes, and the stench of rotten food and fishy, partially opened tins near the armchair made my nose hairs curl. Packages of groceries that hadn’t been put away piled up on the edge of the kitchen, and from here I could still see the old fridge peering in like a concerned neighbor, while a familiar set of beeps told me the new one had been left open again. I don’t know why I absorbed the mundanity of it all, how perfectly normal it all was while I stared down at her.

Vanessa’s body was curled over the uneven mix of carpet and cardboard like a ragdoll, her head turned slightly to the side as blood, now dried, had dripped over her cheek. Her eyes, half closed, were stripped of all intelligence and wit. Stolen away by the colorful knives stabbed into her chest, neck, and stomach. She must have just come from work, still wearing a lawyer-appropriate pencil skirt and blazer, the dark colors only darker around the blood stains. Her hand draped over a box saying “Easy Home Organizer!” while her neck twisted unnaturally over what appeared to be a package of neck pillows. 

I laughed, staggering as I stared down at her. Mom’s iPad and phone were on the floor, blood on the screens. Dents in Vanessa’s head looked like they could fit either one. The TV was broken, the cracked screen still showing an ad for an allergy pill, promising to last all day. I laughed again, looking at the screen, down at Vanessa. This was so funny. Come on, her neck snapping on a box of neck pillows? I laughed more. All that blood couldn’t be cleaned by all the carpet shampooers in the world. From the plugged-in, brand new apparatus pushed up against my sister’s stocking-clad leg, it was clear mom had been trying to do just that.

I don’t know how I got outside, standing still and laughing to myself quietly with firm hands clasping my shoulders. As I was sat down, my laughter turned into sobs, choking any other word that could have been said. Someone had been sitting with me for a moment, but when I was left alone, other officers still around discussing their investigation with muted voices, I found enough strength to stand. Maybe I had seen her in the backseat of the squad car at some point, but I staggered over, stopping only to press both my hands to the glass and stare at my mother. She stared back at me, trembling, crying. Blood still covered her. My sister’s blood.  
  
When I woke up, I was in the hospital. I was told by a nurse, the very same that had glared at me the day I went to visit my mother, that I’d fainted from shock. Numbly, I answered the questions of the investigators who came by. They told me Vanessa had come into the home, leaving the door open, and had gotten into a fight with my mom about the clear hoarding issue she had developed. As things escalated, Vanessa had tried to take away my Mother’s devices, leading to her being struck in the head by the iPad. As Vanessa was dazed, Mom had grabbed the knives she had just opened and stabbed each of them into my sister. Why all three? I wondered, why not just one multiple times? It didn’t matter. I could only imagine the argument, about how good the knives were, about how she’d show Vanessa how they were. Or maybe Mom was just that far gone.   
  
I listened to their report with glazed eyes until finally, they asked if there was anyone they could notify about the incident in the family.  
  
“My dad,” I replied slowly. He may be an asshole, but he still loved Vanessa. He deserved to know.   
  
Weeks later, after my mother had been put in jail awaiting trial for her prison sentence, my dad made the trip out to my college. I wasn’t going back home, and there was no way in hell I was ready to handle my sister’s affairs now that she was gone. All I could do was stay in my dorm room and sit, staring at the wall for hours on end. When we met up, we sat down at one of the many coffeehouses in the area in a fairly private, quiet corner. I’d been too numb to mumble anything other than whatever they had on special, and the frozen crap before me tasted like sugar shit itself. Dad tried to make small talk, but I cut through it immediately.  
  
“What happened with you and mom?” I asked him, eyes fixed on the condensation spilling down the sides of the plastic cup and pooling beneath it. “If you had stayed with her, if you’d been loyal, none of this would have happened.”  
  
I spoke those words to him, knowing full well they were directed at me. He stared at me for a moment, then let out a quiet sigh.  
  
“Your mother…” He began, “She’d stayed glued to the TV for hours, calling in every toll-free number on screen and ordering everything she’d see in commercials. It wasn’t… It was never as bad as what happened to you. Back then, everything was limited to whatever they could play on the air in between shows. Now, you can’t escape from them. It killed us financially--” He paused, swallowing around the word. I could see tears in his eyes. I felt them burning in my own. “I did cheat on her; there’s no changing that. I couldn’t take it, the stress of the money, and she just kept spending it all. When we divorced, she changed for the better. I thought it was behind her. I thought it was. I’m sorry.”

As we both devolved into tears, nothing much else was said. Vanessa was dead, and I realized, with dread in my heart, that I had given my mother the gun that killed her.
