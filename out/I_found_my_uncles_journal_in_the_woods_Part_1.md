Let me just preface this by saying my uncle has been missing since 1994 and it’s been a cold case ever since. I would also like to add that I will try to update you as much as I can but since my grandparents house is so deep in the woods the internet isn’t quite as good so I may not be able to answer any questions in a timely manner.

Speaking of, my parents moved here shortly after my grandmother died, I came here quite often but now I’m supposed to actually live here since we were the only living relatives. Anyways I decided to explore the woods near the house to familiarize myself with the area. I went in with my dog, Buster, in case I got lost I could just follow him home. After a little exploring I found something it was buried pretty deep in the dirt but I could definitely see something that was red with golden accents. Immediately I pulled it out and it was a book. It looked like it was decades old and it looked like some of its pages had been torn out, and then I flipped it over. 

“Property of Charles Smith” I knew my uncle by name at this point since his disappearance had become somewhat of a local legend. After finding it I skimmed through the pages thinking it was some sort of prank from some kid, again local legend, but it looked legit, the paper, the leather, everything looked real. It was getting dark so I brought it inside and read it until the pages cut off, and I’ve written it all down below, I also fixed some spelling errors and if need be I’ll chime in with a *.

If you are reading this… then stop! This is a private journal and older sisters ARE NOT allowed to read. If you’re not my older sister and you found this lying around, give the number on the back a call and please return it, and if you’re cool stick around. 

*Some of the pages after were torn out, around 12.

October 5 1994
I am the unluckiest kid in the 7th grade. I finally went to talk to Sarah Clint and just when I did Brad and his goons spill spaghetti all over me! If this keeps up I’ll be sitting with the weird kids. And my sister was no help, she just keeps being a dick about it. And I can barely sleep with that bird outside, It sounds like a person dying but dad just says it’s a bird. I still don’t buy it. This weekend I’ll go out there.

October 6 1994
My life is ruined. I tried sitting with my “””friends””” but they just kicked me out, said they didn’t want Brad seeing them as a target whatever that means. I mean I get it, he is a freakishly strong 13 year old but still! So I sat with the weird kids next to the TRASH CAN. Well it wasn’t so bad, the kids were nice. There’s 3 of them in total, Kelly Silverman, Ricky Lancaster and Steph Taylor. Kelly’s a total freak she only wears black, no one’s even died and then there’s Ricky who keeps talking about The X-Men, and I don’t mean the show, I mean the comics ALL THE TIME! Steph is… actually really

*there’s something crossed out here, I can’t it make out.

Cool and fun, but she only likes boy stuff. I know we’re not supposed to judge on that but it’s true, I think she runs faster than me and she has the SNES and Genesis like how cool is that! If it weren’t for her long hair I think people would just think she was a boy. But yeah we actually had a lot in common. All 4 of us, even Kelly somehow.

October 7 1994
Today was awesome! I was sitting with Ricky, Kelly and Steph when Brad came up to us, I got ready for the usual routine but then in a second I heard 2 thuds and saw Brad with a bloody nose on the ground and Steph standing over him. She got detention but apparently I made a good enough impression yesterday that she invited me to her house for the weekend with Kelly and Ricky. I told my mom and she was ecstatic I made new friends, she called Steph’s mom and I don’t even know how this happened but it’s a sleepover now!

October 8 1994
Everything was going normal right? But then that damn bird started crying again! It’s a small town so of course it’s the same woods but it sounds even louder here. And then Steph said something to me, to all of us.
“Let’s investigate that, tomorrow.”
And we will. But right now I’m going to bed

October 11 1994
Kelly hasn’t come back. It’s been 3 days and she’s still missing. We should have never gone in there. We went to the woods and we heard that bird closer and closer. And then we found the cave, we went in there and the screams got louder, Ricky ditched because he got scared of the symbols but we just went deeper, eventually we saw… that thing it wasn’t a bear it was bigger than that and we just ran. Eventually Steph and I got out but we couldn’t find Kelly so we assumed she was ahead but she didn’t show up to school, I told the cops and they’re not telling us anything.

*And that’s it, every other page is torn out. I did some research on Kelly and they found her, sort of, they found an arm in the river and eventually her dead body, there were no wounds, she wasn’t even missing an arm she just dropped dead. As for the cave I did find where it is but I’m on the fence about going, if anyone has any advice or questions I’ll try to reply as much as possible.
