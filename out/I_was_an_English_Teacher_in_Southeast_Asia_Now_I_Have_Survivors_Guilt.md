Before I start things off here, let me just get something out in the open... This is not a story I can tell with absolute clarity – if anything, the following will read more like a blog post than a well-told story. Even if I was a natural storyteller - which I’m not, because of what unfolds in the following experience, my ability to tell it well is even more limited... But I will try my best.  

I used to be an English language teacher, which they call in the States, ESL, and what they call back home in the UK, TEFL. Once Uni was over and done with, to make up for never having a gap year for myself, I decided, rather than teaching horrible little shites in the “mother country”, I would instead travel abroad, exploring one corner of the globe and then the other, all while providing children with the opportunity to speak English in their future prospects. 

It’s not a bad life being a TEFL teacher. You get to see all kinds of amazing places, eat amazing food and, not to mention... the girls love a “rich” white foreigner. By this point in my life, the countries I’d crossed off the bucket list included: a year in Argentina, six months in Madagascar, and two pretty great years in China. 

When deciding on where to teach next, I was rather adamant on staying in south-east Asia – because let’s face it, there’s a reason every backpacker decides to come here. It’s a bloody paradise! I thought of maybe Brunei or even Cambodia, but quite honestly, the list of places I could possibly teach in this part of the world was endless. Well, having slept on it for a while, I eventually chose Vietnam as my next destination - as this country in particular seemed to pretty much have everything: mountains, jungles, tropical beaches, etc. I know Thailand has all that too, but let’s be honest... Everyone goes to Thailand. 

Well, turning my sights to the land where “Charlie don’t surf”, I was fortunate to find employment almost right away. I was given a teaching position in central Vietnam, right where the demilitarized zone used to be. The school I worked at was located by a beach town, and let me tell you, this beach town was every backpacker’s dream destination! The beach has pearl-white sand, the sea a turquoise blue, plus the local rent and cuisine is ridiculously reasonable. Although Vietnam is full of amazing places to travel, when you live in a beach town like this that pretty much crosses everything off the list, there really wasn’t any need for me to see anywhere else. 

Yes, this beach town definitely has its flaws. There’s rodents almost everywhere. Cockroaches are bad, but mosquitos are worse – and as beautiful as the beach is here, there’s garbage floating in the sea and sharp metal or plastic hiding amongst the sand. But, having taught in other developing countries prior to this, a little garbage wasn’t anything new – or should I say, A LOT of garbage. 

Well, since I seem to be rambling on a bit here about the place I used to work and live, let me try and skip ahead to why I’m really sharing this experience... As bad as the vermin and garbage is, what is perhaps the biggest flaw about this almost idyllic beach town, is that, in the inland jungle just outside of it... Tourists are said to supposedly go missing... 

A bit of local legend here, but apparently in this jungle, there’s supposed to be an unmapped trail – not a hiking trail, just a trail. And among the hundreds of tourists who come here each year, many of them have been known to venture on this trail, only to then vanish without a trace... Yeah... That’s where I lived. In fact, tourists have been disappearing here so much, that this jungle is now completely closed off from the public.  

Although no one really knows why these tourists went missing in the first place, there is a really creepy legend connected to this trail. According to superstitious locals, or what I only heard from my colleagues in the school, there is said to be creatures that lurk deep inside the jungle – creatures said to abduct anyone who wanders along the unmapped trail.  

As unsettling as this legend is, it’s obviously nothing more than just a legend – like the loch ness monster for example. When I tried prying as to what these creatures were supposed to look like, I only got a variation of answers. Some said the creatures were hairy ape-men, while others said they resembled something like lizards. Then there were those who just believed they’re sinister spirits that haunt the jungle. Not that I ever believed any of this, but the fact that tourists had definitely gone missing inside this jungle... It goes without saying, but I stayed as far away from that place as humanly possible.  

Now, with the local legends out the way, let me begin with how this all relates to my experience... Six or so months into working and living by this beach town, like every Friday after work, I go down to the beach to drink a few brewskis by the bar. Although I’m always meeting fellow travellers who come and go, on this particular Friday, I meet a small group of travellers who were rather extraordinary. 

I won’t give away their full names because... I haven’t exactly asked for their permission, so I’ll just call them Tom, Cody, and Enrique. These three travellers were fellow westerners like myself – Americans to be exact. And as extravagant as Americans are – or at least, to a Brit like me, these three really lived up to the many Yankee stereotypes. They were loud, obnoxious and way too familiar with the, uhm... hallucinogens should I call it. Well, despite all this, for some stupid reason, I rather liked them. They were thrill-seekers you see – adrenaline junkies. Pretty much, all these guys did for a living was travel the world, climbing mountains or exploring one dangerous place after another. 

As unappealing as this trio might seem on the outside - a little backstory here, but I always imagined becoming a thrill-seeker myself one day – whether that be one who jumps out of airplanes or tries their luck in the Australian outback... Instead, I just became a TEFL teacher. Although my memory of the following conversation is hazy at best, after sharing a beer or two with the trio, aside from being labelled a “passport bro”, I learned they’d just come from exploring a haunted Japanese forest, and were now in Vietnam for their next big adrenaline rush... I think anyone can see where I’m going with this, so I’ll just come out and say it. Tom, Cody and Enrique had come to Vietnam, among other reasons, not only to find the trail of missing tourists, but more importantly, to try and survive it... Apparently, it was for a vlog. 

After first declining their offer to accompany them, I then urgently insist they forget about the trail altogether and instead find their thrills elsewhere – after all, having lived in this region for more than half a year, I was far more familiar with the cautionary tales then they were. Despite my insistence, however, the three Americans appear to just laugh and scoff in my face, taking my warnings as nothing more than Limey cowardice. Feeling as though I’ve overstayed my welcome, I leave the trio to enjoy their night, as I felt any further warnings from me would be met on deaf ears. 

I never saw the Americans again after that. While I went back to teaching at the school, the three new friends I made undoubtedly went exploring through the jungle to find the “legendary” trail, all warnings and dangers considered. Now that I think back on it, I really should’ve reported them to the local authorities. You see, when I first became a TEFL teacher, one of the first words of advice I received was that travellers should always be responsible wherever they go - and if these Americans weren’t willing to be responsible on their travels, then I at least should’ve been responsible on my end. 

Well, not to be unreliable or anything, but when I said I never saw Tom, Cody or Enrique again... that wasn’t entirely accurate. It wasn’t wrong per-se... but it wasn’t accurate... No more than, say, a week later, and during my lunch break, one of my colleagues informs me that a European or American traveller had been brought to the hospital, having apparently crawled his way out from the jungle... The very same jungle where this alleged trail is supposed to be... 

Believing instantly this is one of the three Americans, as soon as I finish work that day, I quickly make my way up to the hospital to confirm whether this was true. Well, after reaching the hospital, and somehow talking my way past the police and doctors, I was then brought into a room to see whoever this tourist was... and let me tell you... The sight of them will forever haunt me for the rest of my days... 

What I saw was Enrique, laying down in a hospital bed, covered in blood, mud and God knows what else. But what was so haunting about the sight of Enrique was... he no longer had his legs... Where his lower thighs, knees and the rest should’ve been, all I saw were blood-stained bandages. But as bad as the sight of him was... the smell was even worse. Oh God, the smell... Enrique’s room smelled like charcoaled meat that had gone off, as well as what I always imagined gunpowder would smell like... 

You see... Enrique, Cody and Tom... They went and found the trail inside the jungle... But it wasn’t monsters or anything else of the sort that was waiting for them... In all honesty, it wasn’t really a trail they found at all...  

...It was a bloody mine field. 

I probably should’ve mentioned this earlier, but when I first moved to Vietnam, I was given a very clear and stern warning about the region’s many dangers... You see, the Vietnam War may have ended some fifty years ago... and yet, regardless, there are still hundreds of thousands of mines and other explosives buried beneath the country. Relics from a past war, silently waiting for a next victim... Tom and Cody were among these victims... It seems even now, like some sort of bad joke... Americans are still dying in Vietnam... It’s a cruel kind of irony, isn’t it? 

It goes without saying, but that’s what happened to the missing tourists. They ventured into the jungle to follow the unmapped trail, and the mines got them... But do you know the worst part of it?... The local authorities always knew what was in that jungle – even before the tourists started to go missing... They always knew, but they never did or said anything about it. Do you want to know why?... I’ll give you a clue... Money... Tourist money speaks louder than mines ever could...  

I may not have died in that jungle. I may not have had my legs blown off like Enrique. But I do have to live on with all this... I have to live with the image of Enrique’s mutilated body... The smell of his burnt, charcoaled flesh... Honestly, the guilt is the worst part of it all...  

...The guilt that I never did anything sooner.
