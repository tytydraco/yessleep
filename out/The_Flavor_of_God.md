The world didn’t shift all at once. It bloomed, like a flower growing in reverse, petals spiraling inward until everything collapsed into one infinite point. That point was his tongue.

He had only taken two hits. Enough to feel loose, unmoored, like a balloon slipping free from its tether. The joint still smoldered in the ashtray when he wandered into the kitchen, his mind tugged forward by the distant hum of hunger. Pork chops sounded good, he thought—simple, hearty, a childhood staple. He liked the idea of it more than the food itself. Cooking was just something to do.

But when the first taste hit, the universe broke open.

The salt didn’t just taste salty—it was crystalline perfection, the ghost of the ocean trapped in a grain. The garlic powder dissolved into a rich, golden smoke that whispered of ancient fields. Paprika burned like the dying light of a sunset, pepper crackled like static in his brain. Each flavor was so distinct, so impossibly whole, that his jaw locked, his lungs stuttered, his knees buckled. He fell forward, catching the counter as the rest of the meal followed: the sweetness of the oil searing the meat, the acid of heat blooming from the pan. He tasted the citrus note of his own sweat beading on his upper lip.

Everything was taste, all at once. And it was too much. 

He doubled over, his mouth still filled with the pork chop’s symphony. But the taste didn’t stay in his mouth. It slithered down his throat, into his stomach, until it was everywhere. He could taste his veins—metallic rivers pulsing with iron, copper, and faint traces of something acidic, bitter, alive. He gagged but didn’t vomit. Vomiting would mean losing it, and the thought of losing this sensation terrified him.

The food wasn’t food anymore. It was an equation, a fractal, a door. Every element, every molecule, revealed itself in crystalline clarity. Salt was no longer just salt; it was sodium and chlorine, ancient atoms that had once floated in primordial seas. Garlic powder whispered of decomposition, its pungency a reminder of life breaking down to feed itself again. His mind screamed against the revelation, yet his body leaned into it, desperate to taste more, desperate to understand.

He looked at his hands and tasted the oils on his fingertips, the faint tang of the joint he had smoked earlier, the subtle musk of his skin. He could taste time itself—how long it had been since he washed his hands, how the particles of garlic powder had clung to his skin while he seasoned the meat. The room spun as the world collapsed inward.

His legs gave out, and he sprawled on the kitchen floor, staring at the cracked ceiling. Above him, the light flickered. The faint buzz of the bulb burned on his tongue, bitter and electric. He could taste the air—oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, each molecule brushing against his tongue like a lover’s kiss.

This was no high. This was something else. Something vast and unknowable. He closed his eyes, hoping to shut it out, but the darkness behind his eyelids was rich and endless, a void filled with flavors that didn’t belong on Earth.

“God,” he whispered, and for a moment, he thought he could taste that too. Not a person or a voice, but an idea, a presence that seeped through him like liquid light. It was everything and nothing, endless and infinitesimal. And it was terrifying.

The clock ticked, but it didn’t sound like a clock. The seconds were more like cracks in the universe, sharp and disorienting, each one vibrating in his bones. He tried to get up, to steady himself, but the floor felt too familiar and too strange at the same time. His fingertips brushed against the cold tile, but the sensation wasn’t cold. It was ice and fire, the deep thrum of distant stars, a pull between opposing forces he couldn’t understand.

He lifted his hand to his mouth, tasting his own sweat again, but now it tasted like the dirt of ancient civilizations, the salt of tears, the bitterness of years wasted, his life condensed into one drop of sweat. The thought of his own body felt obscene—an imperfect vessel for something that had expanded beyond it. He was just a conduit now, an organ to carry the unimaginable flavors of the universe.

The pork chop—now abandoned on the counter—called to him, the flavors fading, fading, almost gone. His stomach growled, but it wasn’t hunger. It was the gnawing sense of something missing, something far beyond his grasp, but so close he could taste it.

He stood up, and the world shifted beneath him. Every movement was magnified, every sound distorted. The squeak of his shoes on the floor wasn’t just sound; it was a symphony of friction, the perfect storm of rubber and wood and air. His breath felt like it was too loud, too harsh, too much. He inhaled deeply, but it wasn’t air he was taking in—it was everything. The chemical composition of his breath. The blood pulsing through his lungs. The bitter rush of adrenaline. All of it, filling him up, overwhelming him, until his body was a vessel he didn’t recognize.

But it felt too good. Too good to stop.

The need to create, to keep tasting, gnawed at him. He turned back to the pork chop. It was now a mere shadow of its former self, the flavors fading, retreating into the void, but he couldn’t let it go. He needed to finish it. He needed to master it.

He reached for the seasoning again, but this time, the spices didn’t feel right. The garlic powder and paprika felt… small. Beneath him. He needed something more, something profound, something eternal. His mind raced, grabbing at the concept of flavor like it was a weapon, a key to unlocking something greater. A voice whispered in the back of his mind—a voice that wasn’t his own—urging him to go beyond.

He didn’t question it. He knew what he had to do.

His hands moved like a puppet’s, guided by invisible strings. He reached for the olive oil, for the lemon juice, the chili flakes, the soy sauce. He sprinkled them with precision, with divine purpose, knowing that every move was one step closer to perfection. The pan sizzled beneath him as he poured the oil—alive with anticipation. His pulse quickened, and the air in the room felt thick, like it was made of pure possibility. He was about to create the ultimate dish.

But then it hit him again. The taste of everything. All at once.

And for a fleeting moment, he understood.

He understood that everything had flavor. Every choice. Every step. Every breath. He was connected to it all, a bridge between the microscopic and the monumental. He tasted the thoughts of his past, his regrets, his longing for something greater, something transcendent. He could taste his own desperation, his need to prove something, anything, to escape the weight of insignificance.

He was no longer a boy. He was the universe itself, the measure of all things. He was everything—every grain of salt, every drop of oil, every breath that had ever been taken.

It wasn’t enough. Nothing was enough anymore.

He turned back to the sizzling pan, his hands shaking as he sprinkled the last dash of seasoning. The flavors felt like they were slipping through his fingers, like trying to hold onto water. His stomach growled again, but this hunger wasn’t for food. It was something deeper—something cosmic. The taste of the universe was on the tip of his tongue, and he wasn’t sure if he was eating the pork chop anymore or if the pork chop was eating him.

The room was silent, but not really. The silence was a heavy thing, filled with the hum of everything—atoms vibrating, molecules colliding, unseen forces that bound the world together. It was overwhelming in a way that was almost unbearable, but he leaned into it. He had no choice. The taste had become a part of him, had invaded every cell in his body, had twisted his sense of reality into something far too vast for his fragile human form to comprehend.

He wasn’t just tasting food. He was tasting existence itself.

A sudden thought struck him—a terrifying, epiphanic realization. What if the flavors didn’t belong to food at all? What if food was just a veil, a distraction, a tool for him to grasp at something greater? What if the flavors were a language, one he’d only just begun to understand, a language that spoke to him from the edges of the universe?

His mind trembled with the weight of the idea. What if all of this—the obsession, the search for the perfect meal—wasn’t about food at all? What if it was a quest to understand something that had no end, no resolution?

He grabbed the pork chop, his hand slick with oil, and took another bite. It wasn’t the same as before. The flavors were sharper now, more intense, but also empty. He was filling himself with taste, but something in the core of him—something deep, deep down—was still starving. His chest constricted with the feeling. He wasn’t sure if it was hunger or something else—something darker.

He closed his eyes again, and the world blurred into a swirling chaos of colors and sounds and flavors. The garlic powder became the scent of decay, the paprika the taste of death itself. The heat of the pan burned his tongue, but the burn was too sharp, too real, and he recoiled, ripping the chop from his mouth, staggering back. His heart pounded violently in his chest, and for a moment, he thought he might suffocate on the air.

I’ve gone too far, he thought, and the words were like a scream in the back of his throat. He couldn’t stop tasting, couldn’t stop feeling everything, the world was too much now, and it wasn’t food anymore—it was life itself. The weight of every decision, every moment, every breath he had ever taken pressed down on him, and for a second, he couldn’t breathe.

His hands shook. His legs felt like they might buckle beneath him. The floor beneath him wasn’t just tile anymore—it was the surface of an infinite sea, the boundary between life and nothingness, and he was sinking. The taste of the room had changed. It no longer felt comforting or familiar. It felt wrong. It was suffocating.

Is this what God feels?

The thought pierced through his mind like a lightning bolt, and in that instant, he was both terrified and awed. Could he even imagine what it would be like to be God? To know everything, to taste every possibility, every outcome, every flavor of existence, all at once?

He felt the overwhelming urge to cry, to scream, but there was no sound, no release. The taste—the flood of it—kept him locked in this infinite, impossible moment. He had become a conduit, a vessel, and now, the power of it was suffocating him.

And then it hit him. A single, simple truth: the taste would never end. It couldn’t. The universe wasn’t something you could taste and then walk away from. It wasn’t a meal. It was a hunger that would consume you entirely. A thirst you could never quench.

He was drowning, not in food, but in everything. He had crossed the line, and now there was no going back. The pork chop was forgotten, the meal unfinished. All that remained was the taste—the constant, infinite, all-consuming taste of everything.

And then, without warning, it was gone.

He awoke on the kitchen floor, his head pounding, his body trembling. The room was quiet, eerily still. The faint smell of burnt meat lingered in the air, but the flavors were gone. The world was just the world again. The weight of it all was gone, and he felt… hollow.

He reached for the pork chop. It was just food now, dry, bland, an ordinary meal.

But his fingers hovered over it. And for the first time, he realized something terrible.

He didn’t want it anymore.

He couldn’t taste it.
