First of all, if anyone reading this remembers this or has any information about where the offspring went, please do not hesitate to send it to me. I am trying to piece this together and everything helps, no matter how small. 



My parents have just recently. They've decided that since it's just the two of them after I started to live on my own combined with the untimely passing of my grandmother that it's time for them to downsize, finding a small two bedroom cottage out in the middle of a field. It's a lovely building but I've been joking that with my hayfever they chose a field to ward me away like an evil spirit.  
But where they're going to or have lived isn't important. This was apparently a worldwide event and it being tied to this house seems unlikely. 



As anyone who's moved house will tell you, packing is the worst bit. Having to wrap and box 5 or even 10 years of your life is a big enough task as is, but when you've been living in the same place for 30+ years that task suddenly becomes insurmountable. Needless to say we hired a moving company, but even then we needed to box it up ourselves and we even hired a skip to throw away most of what we've been hoarding.



The problem was we had a big house and so everyone used us as a free storage container, usually various items they really want to get rid of but can't just throw away, such as paperwork or family portraits that look like they should be burned to release whatever demon is trapped inside. Someone used us to store an entire two-man canoe. Nobody I know, including the owner of this 10ft lump of plastic and plywood has ever bothered to take it out and use it. After speaking with the owner and him deciding he doesn't want it I went online and traded in 70lb for £70 and that's one problem solved.



For better and worse, storing everyone's stuff gave us an excuse to call them up and guilt trip them into helping us move.  
It was best for me as I got to indulge in one of my favorite passtimes, listening to family stories. The move was making a lot of people nostalgic and I was more then ready to be their audience as they rattled off tale after tale. It's all the same ones I've heard before, but they're interesting enough for me to listen to them again and again. Like the time my grandmother was shot at after freeing animal test subjects or how a cousin starred in a romance movie where she reportedly had the worst kiss of her life with her male co-star.



We were even graced by an appearance of my aunt (who is actually a cousin from an older generation so I call her aunt) Leigh and her husband John. They had flown into the country for work and fate aligned in just the right way so we could tell them to get their shit out of our garage. They were ironically the ones who stayed and helped the longest as they moved quite regularly and so were experienced.



But that's just setting the scene. What I'm actually writing this for are two boxes I found in the attic when we were moving. The trapdoor to get up there is in my childhood bedroom and we used it so much I didn't know we had an attic until I was 17. As I am the youngest and by extension the skinniest, it was my job to go up and pass whatever's up there to my father and my uncle John waiting at the base of the ladder. It was a simple enough premise, and my dad had stated that the last time he remembers opening it was 2004 to use as storage so I was expecting some dust to have accumulated over the years.



However nothing could have prepared any of us for the Chernobyl-esque dust cloud that descended from the opening. All three of us evacuated the room coughing and spluttering. I remember I made a joke through the sound of me slowly dying that my dad had got the dates wrong and hadn't opened it since 4002, not 2004. I was closest to the initial blast of dust, and whilst my young lungs recovered faster then the adults I could feel I was going to be rendered mute the following day.



At this point my uncle and dad started debating on what to do. My uncle argued that we needed to call in a specialist and that the attic was a health risk. My dad was on the side that since we're moving it's not our problem and calling a specialist would scare away the buyers as the purchase isn't complete and they might pull out if there is the sudden concern about a health risk. Either way, it was decided that whatever is up there is rendered forfeit to the new owners and considered a casualty of war. I was not so disswaded. Up in that attic are boxes of memories, family stories that I haven't heard and I wanted to hear them again.  
However my dad and uncle weren't exactly kean on the idea of me going up there. In fact, they didn't even let me back into my old bedroom to close the ceiling hatch and open the window to clear the room. A little silly considering I am a grown adult, but parents will always be parents.



I kept my mouth shut and went back to filling and moving boxes. Simple back-breaking labor that makes me happy I went into software and not farming. It was later that night I went back to my old bedroom, and this time prepared with a cloth facemask and eye goggles. I even made sure to wear long sleeves and gloves in case the dust was actually harmful. It was incredibly easy to access the attic. Only me and my parents slept in the house and I've been known to be late to bed so the sound of my footsteps in the night is normal, I think even welcomed by my parents to have their son back home for a time. The hardest part was getting an old stepladder up the stairs without it springing open with a sound that rivals a foghorn, or worse, springing open and trapping my fingers causing me to release a sound that rivals a foghorn.



Inside the attic was surprisingly better than expected. It had all settled over the many years and was only disturbed by my footsteps and even then it barely reached my waist. When I got up there I slightly regretted it. At first glance it was clear that what my parents had stored up there was empty space and spare cobwebs. I would have let out a melancholic at the anticlimax if I wasn't holding my breath.



However it was when I had turned back to descend the stepladder when I spied two cardboard boxes in the far corner. The attic was literally the space under the roof so the ceiling and the walls were one of the same and came down in sharp slopes either side of me, creating the perfect shadow to hide the boxes in. I returned back into my old bedroom and sealed the trapdoor and tomorrow's evening entertainment. The boxes themselves weren't large and were respectfully light with each one being sealed with duct tape much like the boxes we pack for moving.



Skipping forward to tomorrow after a long day of moving we sat down and had fish and chips we got from what was our local. I miss that chippy when I'm away, you could reheat the chips as many times as you want and they'd still taste like fresh. But after all that, we usually sit and watch a movie or something but our television had been packed away so some people read whilst the others talked. I took the opportunity to open up the two from the attic with a boxcutter. Much to my relief, neither of them greeted me with a similar dust explosion like the trapdoor, so these things were sealed real tight.



The first box contained a telescope about 12cm big, like it was designed to sit on your windowsile and look pretty, but after testing I found it was usable as a telescope and made my foot look huge. Alongside it were a couple of blank DVD cases with unmarked discs inside them. According to those present in the room with me they had used a disc recorder they were storing, for the same guy who owned the canoe, to get a physical copy of a news broadcast but couldn't remember quite what it was. What they do remember is that my dad was sent to fish the recorder out of storage and only managed to catch some of the broadcast. Inside the box was a third item.

It was a print out of a photo, probably from a news website, maybe even Nasa's own website if they had one back then. It was of an astronaut standing on the moon's surface, and in the background was the signature blue-green curve of the Earth, and the clear unmistakable grey image of the moon.



I thought it was fake, who wouldn't? It's not exactly hard to edit the moon into pictures. Even I with my very limited knowledge of Adobe could copy-paste a png of the moon into an image.This certainty continued as I opened the second box. Inside were more photos, but not of any celestial bodies, but of my family and their friends at a party. Everyone seems to be drinking heavily and dancing to music. I could even see in one photo my mum absolutely demolishing a glass of prosecco and she is famous for never touching alcohol, gives her a splitting migraine. There were a couple taken in quick succession of my aunt Leigh and uncle John apparently caught in a compromising position and her trying to grab the camera. I asked about these photos with my present family. I am no stranger to spooky stories and movies, which is why it was a pleasant surprise to learn they not only remember this party, but this isn't the first time I've heard about it. Apparently this is the party Leigh got caught making out with John back when he was her boytoy and not yet married.



Everybody's stories began to diverge from one another though when it came to why there was a party. The only thing that they could agree on was that it was a babyshower, but couldn't decide on who's baby. This confused me for two reasons. Firstly, there is far too much partying and drinking to be a baby shower. It honestly looks like a frat party more than anything, the phrase 'Live like it's your last day alive' flashed in my head from a recording a mate had sent as he presumably drank 12 too many beers with loud club music in the background. Secondly, baby showers are primarily American, and we're British. My family has never thrown a baby shower for anyone with being lumped with gender reveals and photoshoots under the category of 'pointless things to do whilst pregnant'.



I didn't draw the connection between the two boxes at first. It's obvious to me now, the baby shower for a baby we don't know and a photo with two moons. But back then I hadn't seen the video of it going into labor.  
It wasn't until we had completed the move I was able to watch the discs. We have a DVD player (I've collected them most of my life) but it was deep in one of the boxes and we didn't know which one. Ironically it made me work even harder so I could unpack and finally answer my questions. In the meantime I spent every evening talking to not only my aunt and uncle and both parents, but also phoning up anyone who we could recognise in the photos. I was in bliss, I got to talk for hours about family stories I've never heard before and learn the origins of some classic ones. Apparently it wasn't just my aunt and future uncle who were getting frisky. Honestly the amount of people who were going at each other I thought I stumbled upon some record of an orgy and they claimed it was a baby shower to protect my innocence. Having found the truth I kinda wish it was an orgy. And even more surprising is that it wasn't just family and friends, it was about 45 people, some I recognised and some were strangers but seemingly all from town inside that house and drinking the place dry. But nobody I called was able to remember who's baby it was.



When I finally was able to watch the disks I was on the edge of my seat, the kind of energy a child has when waking up on Christmas and now has to kill time until their parents wake up. I slid in the first disk and was instantly greeted with not just a news broadcast, but an emergency alert situation. On screen was footage seemingly captured live of towns and cities being flooded and taken out by tidal waves, mass casualty rates were through the roof, birds were dropping from the sky as apparently climates were rapidly shifting. I was watching the end of the world.



Past all the destruction on screen the news anchor, a Blonde woman that i recognised from news i saw throughout my life, though much younger here, stated that  
"What you are witnessing here is the trail of destruction caused by the unexplained lunar phenomena. Experts claim the level of destruction will only increase as its orbit stabilises. Civilians are advised to seek shelter on as high ground as possible to avoid the catastrophic floods." I remember watching her give information about war and death before, but in this recording she sounded scared, like whatever it was was in the studio with her.



I watched utterly transfixed on the disaster movie unfolding before my eyes. It almost seemed to repeat. Death, destruction, and a mention of the unexplained lunar phenomena. I think I understand now why everyone had come round for a massive party, with ungodly amounts of drinking and sex and music. How else would you spend your last night on earth?



I usually bounce my leg, it's a habit and I try to sit still but even during some of my favorite movies it just keeps jigging. It didn't during this, like it knew that bouncing whilst watching this would be disrespectful to the death toll in the hundreds of millions. I don't remember how long the DVD ran after the recording finished, I just sat there in complete shock. This wasn't some movie, this was a broadcast delivered by a local news anchor about a calamity I've never heard of.



I then put in the second disk, though I realised after watching I got it the wrong way round and the disk I had watched first was recorded the day after, 25th of August 2004.



This time the woman stated in a much calmer voice "This is a series of images taken from across the globe that document the progress of this unexplained phenomenon.



The first shot was of the moon, perfectly normal. The second shot was at a different angle using a different camera, I think it's a mix of professional and amateur photos that were submitted to the new station. But just like the first, it showcased the moon, except it was a little off somehow, like it looked familiar but not right. As more and more images appeared I noticed that right down the middle of the moon was a dark line, almost like a shadow that bisected it vertically. As time went on this shadow got darker, and more surprisingly is that the two hemispheres began to swell. It wasn't long before I realised the shadow was actually a trench dug into the lunar surface and continually getting deeper as each side swells, creating a dumbbell shape. And the centre got thinner and thinner until it simply was there anymore and the two hemispheres were disconnected, but it didn't end there. Each hemisphere began to reshape itself, returning to its spherical form and in seemingly no time at all, both hemispheres were both moons in their own right. Not only that, but they were identical in appearance, craters and everything. It sent a chill down my spine watching a celestial body duplicate.



I'm no idiot, I passed GCSE biology and i'm probably thinking the exact same thing you are reading this.



Cell division.



I had just watched the moon undergo mitosis. The moon gave birth and my family threw it a baby shower.



I called my parents in to watch this, my aunt and uncle had flown home by then. But maybe I didn't need them as my parents were more than happy to share the information with me. Apparently with the idea of the moon splitting in two, it became incredibly popular for people to buy telescopes to watch it from their homes. However as expected when something as large as the moon suddenly duplicates, it completely messes up the climate and the tides and all sorts. Again, death toll in the hundreds of millions. When they realised what was happening, Nasa assembled a crew to go up to the new moon to perform tests. According to what my parents remember,the astronauts found that the two moons were completely identical. Reportedly it was predicted the new moon was going to circle around earth using the same orbit as the original, but 180^(o) across, so there would have been a moon during the day and night, if there would be anyone still alive to witness it.



I called everyone, they all remembered the moon duplicating, they all remembered the world ending destruction, they all remember how the party at the end times was called a baby shower and how none of them expected to wake up the next day. I even called the news station from the recordings. Everyone there remembers the moon duplicating, filming that emergency broadcast. I even indirectly spoke with the news anchor I saw that was scared for her parent's life after they had moved to be closer to the sea. Apparently they all held their own babay shower for the newly delivered moon as well. Though sadly, the copies of these specific programs were lost and they'll update me if found.



But the one question that I asked every person there, and a question none of them could answer. If the moon duplicated, why is there currently only one moon? I was born in 2006 and have only ever remembered there being one moon, none of this death and destruction ever appeared on any online search or history class. You'd think this would be the most important event in recent history, but it's like it never happened. Apparently, everyone only remembers there being one moon until I show them the recordings or ask about it.



That all leads me to now, where every line of questioning seems to lead in circles. I get the occasional new story about what happened during the baby shower, or someone with a conflicting account, but it seems nobody I speak to is capable of remembering what I don't already have evidence for. Again, all this death and destruction, the moon having a child and one of them vanishing at it seems like it never even happened.



I have so many questions and not a single one is going to be answered. It’s honestly driving me a little stir crazy, with my only salvation being that people do remember it happening and its effects, so I know I'm not going completely insane.



But every night now I take a moment and stare out my window at the bright shining moon in the night sky and every night I ask it the same question.



“Are you the old one or the new one?”
