When we were twelve, Eli had a sleepover at his house, in his backyard, right at the edge of the woods everyone in town said were cursed. There were always rumors about those woods—how strange things happened there, how people went in and never came out. People didn’t say it out loud much, but if you walked by on a dark night, you could feel the weight of those stories on you.

It was the middle of summer, the kind of night where the air was thick and warm, and the crickets were loud enough to drown out everything else. It felt like one of those nights when anything could happen, when the line between what was real and what wasn’t blurred just enough to make you question everything.

Around midnight, Eli, who always had a way of pushing things a little further than the rest of us, dared us to go past the treeline. There was a spot about twenty feet in, a weird circle of birch trees—barely noticeable in the daytime, but something about them felt off at night. The trees were thin and white, the bark smooth but twisted in ways that made them look almost unnatural. We had all seen the circle before. There wasn’t much to it. Just a few trees that grew in an odd pattern, their trunks bending like they were trying to reach for each other. It was easy to ignore during the day, but under the pale light of our flashlights, those trees looked almost... wrong. They looked like bones. Like they shouldn’t have been there.

We all stood in the circle, trying to act like we weren’t scared. Trying to prove we were tough. But something was different about that place. It was too quiet. The kind of quiet where you could hear your heartbeat in your ears. No wind, no bugs. Just the sound of our breathing, shallow and unsure.

“Why is it so quiet?” Lucas finally asked, his voice low, like he was afraid to break it.

And it was. The usual buzz of the night was gone. It was just us, standing in that ring, surrounded by stillness. It felt like we were waiting for something. Or maybe something was waiting for us.

Eli laughed, breaking the silence, trying to make light of it. “What if we’re summoning ghosts?” he joked. He said it like it was just some random thought, but his voice wavered at the end, like he wasn’t entirely sure it was a joke.

As if on cue, just after he said it, all of our flashlights flickered and died at once. The sudden dark felt thick, like it was pressing in on us. We fumbled with the flashlights, trying to turn them back on, but they didn’t work. The silence seemed to stretch out, like the world itself was holding its breath.

And then we heard it—a snap, a twig breaking behind us.

We all spun around, the darkness swallowing everything around us. Our voices shot out into the night, calling each other’s names, laughing nervously, pretending like we weren’t scared out of our minds. But none of us moved. We stayed rooted in the center of the circle, frozen.

When the lights flickered back on, Eli was gone.

We searched for him for what felt like hours. Screaming his name, running through the trees, crashing through the underbrush, calling out, praying that he’d jump out from behind a tree and laugh at us, say it was all a prank. But we didn’t find him.

We ran back to his house, banging on the door until his mom came out, looking half-asleep, confused. She called the police right away. They came out and searched that night, and the next day, and even the next week. They combed through the woods, checked every inch of that area, but they didn’t find anything. No sign of Eli.

Then, almost a week later, the cops found his shoes. They were right in the center of the birch ring, still tied. No footprints leading anywhere. Just his shoes, sitting there like they’d been placed carefully.

The trees have grown thicker over the years, the forest slowly swallowing up that part of the land. Every time I pass by those woods, I feel like they’ve gotten a little darker. A little closer.

We don’t talk about Eli much anymore. Not really. But sometimes, when the air gets heavy, when the sky starts to turn dark too early, Lucas tells me that he can hear Eli calling him from the woods. Just after dark, he says. A whisper on the wind. A voice he recognizes but can never quite place.

None of us go near the woods now. And we don’t do sleepovers anymore.
