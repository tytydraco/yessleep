I don’t know how to start this. My hands are shaking so bad I can barely type, and I keep looking over my shoulder, even though I’m alone. I think I’m alone. God, I hope I am. I’m writing this because I need someone to believe me, to tell me I’m not losing it. I need to get this out before it’s too late, before she… comes back again.

It started with her smile. That’s what I fell for, back when things were good. Her laugh, the way her eyes crinkled, like she was letting me in on some private joke. We’d been together a couple of years, living in my cramped apartment, the kind with thin walls and a radiator that hissed like it was pissed off. She was messy, clothes everywhere, dishes piled up, but I didn’t care. I loved her chaos. Until it wasn’t chaos anymore. Until it was something else.

She changed a few months ago. Subtle at first. She’d stare at me longer than normal, her smile too wide, like it was stretched. She stopped talking as much, but when she did, her voice was… off. Too low, like it was coming from somewhere deeper than her throat. I’d catch her standing in the kitchen at night, not moving, just facing the wall. I’d ask what she was doing, and she’d turn, slow, that smile splitting her face, and say, “Waiting for you.” I laughed it off at first. I shouldn’t have.

Then the scratches started. Tiny ones, on my arms, my back. I’d wake up with them, stinging, like someone had dragged their nails across me while I slept. I asked her about it, half-joking, but her eyes went blank, and she said, “You did it to yourself.” I didn’t believe her, but I started locking the bedroom door at night. It didn’t help. The scratches got deeper, more deliberate, carving patterns I couldn’t read but felt wrong, like they meant something.

I should’ve left then. I know that now. But I loved her. Or I loved who she used to be. I kept telling myself she was stressed, maybe sick, that we could fix it. Then I found the first piece.

It was in the bathroom sink, curled up like a dead spider. A strip of skin, thin and pale, with a faint pattern of veins. I gagged, thinking it was hers, that she’d hurt herself. I ran to find her, but she was fine, sitting on the couch, humming a tune I didn’t recognize. I showed her the skin, my voice shaking, and she just looked at it, then at me, and said, “It’s not mine.” Her smile was back, wider than ever, and for a second, I swear her teeth looked sharper.

After that, I found more pieces. In the fridge, tucked behind the milk. Under my pillow. In my shoes. Always skin, always hers, or something like hers. Soft, warm, like it had just been peeled off. I stopped asking her about it because her answers didn’t make sense. She’d say things like, “It’s just shedding,” or “You’ll understand soon.” I started sleeping on the couch, keeping a knife under the cushion. I didn’t know what I was afraid of, but I knew it was her. Or something wearing her.

Last week, I snapped. I couldn’t take it anymore, the pieces, the scratches, the way she’d watch me, unblinking, like she was studying me. I screamed at her to tell me what was wrong, what she was doing. She didn’t answer. She just stood there, smiling, and then her face… split. Not like a cut, but like it was unzipping, the skin peeling back to show something underneath. Not blood or muscle, but something black and slick, like oil, moving like it was alive. Her eyes stayed the same, though, locked on mine, and her voice came out, clear as ever: “I’m growing for you.”

I don’t remember much after that. I think I ran. I know I grabbed the knife. I know there was blood and not mine. I know she fell, and I kept stabbing, screaming, because whatever was in front of me wasn’t her anymore. It was something else, something that laughed as I cut it, something that didn’t die. I dragged her body or what was left of it to the bathroom, locked it in there. I sat against the door, crying, shaking, waiting for it to be over.

It wasn’t over. The next morning, she was in the kitchen, cooking eggs. Not a scratch on her. She smiled at me, that same stretched smile, and said, “You were dreaming.” The knife was gone. The blood was gone. But the bathroom floor was wet, and I swear I saw something move under the door, like a shadow that wasn’t mine.

She’s still here. I can’t leave. Every time I try, the door won’t open, or the windows are sealed shut, or I hear her voice behind me, whispering my name. She’s different every day now. Taller, sometimes. Her skin shinier, like it’s new. Her fingers too long, brushing my arm when she passes. And the pieces they’re everywhere. I found one in my mouth yesterday, stuck to my tongue. I spat it out, but I can still taste it, bitter and alive.

Last night, I woke up to her standing over me. Her face was wrong like too many eyes, all hers, blinking in sync. She leaned close, and her breath smelled like rot and metal. She whispered, “I’m almost ready.” I don’t know what that means, but I know it’s not her anymore. It’s something growing inside her, or out of her, and it wants me. I can feel it in the scratches, in the pieces, in the way the air hums when she’s near.

I’m writing this because I don’t have much time. The apartment’s changing. The walls are softer, warmer, like they’re breathing. I hear her humming now, that same tune, and it’s coming from everywhere. If you’re reading this, don’t look for me. Don’t try to help. Just… check your skin. If you find a piece that doesn’t belong, something warm and veined, burn it. Don’t wait. Don’t love it.

She’s at the door now. I can hear her nails, scraping, growing. She’s smiling. I know she is.
