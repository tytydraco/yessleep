I've lived in Laramie Wyoming for around six years now, and I've had quite a few strange experiences, none of which were as strange as one particular night in Veduawoo. One thing that should be mentioned is I'm a wheelchair user and my friend is abled, this is important for later in the story. 

Veduawoo is a part of the Medicine Bow Forest that is just right outside of Laramie. Something about these woods always gave me a feeling like I wasn't alone, I've  camped there plenty and always had the same feeling. People have gone missing and have died there, much like a lot of forests, but it almost feels like they're still not at rest. 

This particular night in the forest was extra strange. I had just gone through something traumatic and called my best friend so I didn't have to be alone. She suggested we take a drive through the forest since we both always felt better in nature. When I say that there was a weird energy to Veduawoo, I dont mean it as a negative one. I never feel in danger (although I'm always aware of potentially dangerous wildlife), I just also get a weird feeling. 

So we hopped in the car and made the short drive to the pass that leads into the forest. Initially it was a very calm night like any other, it wasn't the only time we'd taken these kinds of drives. After going over a few hills though we saw two red lights on the trail that seemed to be steadily coming towards us. At first we thought that maybe it was some kind of off road vehicle, it was kind of short so it didn't look like a normal vehicle to us. Once we got over the next hill my friend prepared to pull over to give the oncoming off roader some space to get by, but it never passed us. We figured it must have turned off somewhere but we never saw any other paths for it to take before we would have met up. 

This was only the first odd encounter of the night. The particular place in Veduawoo we were trying to get to was Pilot Hill, a small hill that overlooked our town. We were a bit shaken from the strange lights but eventually made it to the gates that started the pilot hill trail. We didn't plan to go far past the gates, we just wanted to get a better view of the town. However, when we got to the gate my wheelchair locked up. Like stronger than my breaks work. After a second we double check that there's no rocks or tree roots blocking my wheels, and all of a sudden I'm free again. We thought it was weird but tried to pass the gate again and this time my wheels locked exactly where the gate started. I felt this ominous feeling like someone was watching us and telling us not to go any further. We decided to hop back in the car and find a camping site to hang out at instead. 

Both of those experiences were followed by the coolest meteor shower I've ever seen, and I felt better after getting home. The only time I was really truly scared was when it felt like someone was telling me not to take the trail. Maybe there was a bear up there, or a human with ill intentions, or maybe we would have gotten injured, or maybe absolutely nothing would have gone wrong, but I'm glad we didn't try it. Maybe it was coincidence my wheelchair got stuck, but I definitely got a bad gut feeling and trusted it.
