I haven’t been able to sleep more than an hour or two at a time. When I do, the same nightmare plays on loop.

A barren desert stretches for miles. Dry and lifeless. My feet sink slightly with every step, not in sand, but in ash, as if something beneath has been burning since the beginning of time. The air is thick with heat and the stench of rot. The sunless sky churns like spoiled milk, a rust-red vortex pulsing above me.

Then I hear the wings.

They start far away. Faint and barely noticeable. Then closer. Dozens. Hundreds. Vultures, emaciated and enormous, circling overhead in nauseating spirals. Their eyes are wet and human-like. Their beaks are dirty, lined with human teeth, drooling a putrid, foul liquid. Some of them whisper in voices that sound like my own.

When they descend, they don’t peck. They tear.

My chest. My arms. My neck. My face.

I never scream. I just feel my body unravel, bit by bit, like paper being pulled apart in slow motion.

I wake up gasping, soaked in sweat, fingertips trembling, and with dried blood under my fingernails. I must have scratched myself in my sleep.

**"Ut'Roth, Kaz'Oh Gor, Gauche..."** I mutter those names like a prayer, trying to make sense of their meaning—or maybe just speaking them into reality to remind myself how urgent this has become.

I need to do something. Fast.

It feels like the moment I stepped foot into that cottage a week ago, I *unleashed* something—deep, old, festering. And now it follows me like smoke.

If I even dare have the audacity to keep living, I have to find a way out.

It’s hard to rationalize, but the sheer vividness of that day left no room for doubt. And then there’s the book.

Always sprawled open on my desk. Always waiting.

It feels almost like I’m living with a pet. Seeking my attention. Wanting me to feed it. Needing my company.

Over the week, I’ve tried to get rid of it.

I threw it in a garbage bag along with the doll. Waited for the garbage truck. Watched it drive away.

When I got back inside, it was already waiting on my desk.

I tried ruining it in the bathtub—planned to pour boiling water over it, followed by bleach.

But I couldn’t do it.

Something in me resisted. Like following through would cause my body to twist and tear in ways I couldn’t imagine. That I’d be swallowed whole by a pain too vast and old to name.

I even tried destroying it. Ripping pages out. Tearing at the spine. I was so desperate, I thought about putting it in a blender—just to test if I could damage it *at all*.

That was the worst attempt.

The moment I tried to tear a page, something hit me—a headache so sudden and violent it dropped me to my knees. I vomited on the floor, clutching the sides of my head as an intense ringing shook through my brain. My vision went white. The tiny rip I’d made in the page was bleeding.

Real blood.

And somehow... I felt sorry for the book.

Like it was communicating. Not with words, but something deeper. Emotional transference. Like a wounded animal whimpering through skin.

“No dice,” I thought. So I gave up for the moment, and decided to inspect it.

When my hand grazed its surface, I felt a warmth. It pulsated gently, like it was breathing. Like a living creature bound to me through invisible chains. Like how a newborn duckling imprints on the first thing it sees.

Like I’d been chosen to mother it.

I tried taking photos.

With my phone, every shot came out pure black. No metadata. Nothing.

I dug out an old Polaroid camera and burned through the whole pack—twenty photos. All blurry, all dark, all warped. But not *identical*. Subtle differences.

“Hahaha… ha... haha. I’m fucked.”

I couldn’t help but laugh. The ridiculousness of it all broke something in me. I let out a bitter cackle, staring at the pile of useless photographs.

“GOD DAMN IT!”

I slammed my fists onto the desk, pens scattering, knocking the mud doll over. The little thing rolled once and stopped, staring at me with mockery.

Nothing was making sense.

Just entertaining everything I’ve experienced has started to take its toll. I feel weak. Hollowed. At the mercy of something I can’t understand—something I may have offended by simply *not being afraid enough*.

Maybe I could live with this. Maybe I could let the book rot on my desk and go on with my life.

But something’s coming.

I can feel it getting closer. Second by second. Step by step. A fate worse than death, walking patiently toward me with my name written on its tongue.

That’s when the call came.

It was Todd, one of the porters from the expedition. A good man. Quiet, a little gruff, but reliable and practical. Rarely used more than six words if five would do. The kind of guy who could read weather through the way leaves leaned.

He didn’t say hello.

Just:  
“You haven’t heard from Anders, have you?”

My stomach dropped.

“No. Why?”

“He’s gone.”

I stood up without realizing it.

“Gone?”

“Didn’t make it back to camp. The group that turned around in the storm said he kept going. Said he wanted to meet you at the ridge camp.”

I hadn’t reached the ridge.

“Jesus Christ,” I said. “That was ten days ago.”

“Yeah.”

Todd was quiet. I heard wind on the line.

“Did he leave anything? Say anything?”

“They said he was carrying something. Some kinda bundle. Cloth, maybe fur. Wouldn’t show it. Just said it was important.”

“What did he mean by that?”

Todd exhaled slowly.

“I dunno. He was different. Not... dangerous. Just quiet. Like he was listening for something the rest of us couldn’t hear. Said he had a delivery to make.”

“To who?”

“To you,” Todd said. “Said he’d give it to you when he saw you. That was the last thing he said.”

My hands were cold. My breath came slow.

“Did he say what was in it?”

“No.”

A soft gust moved across the line.

“Look,” Todd said, more hesitant now. “I don’t wanna make anything of this. But if you hear from him… or if he shows up... maybe just keep your distance. He wasn’t himself.”

“What do you mean?”

“I’ve spent a lot of years out here. And I’ve seen folks lose themselves before. Cold, altitude, isolation—messes with people. But this felt different. Like he wasn’t just gone. Like he’d already said goodbye.”

There was a silence on the line I didn’t know how to fill.

“Anyway. Figured you should know.”

Click.

“…What the hell, Anders,” I muttered. “What were you thinking?”

I sat in silence for a while, pressing my fingers to the bridge of my nose.

That’s when I noticed something in the Polaroids.

I picked one up—looked closer.

There. A faint square in the corner.

A window?

I laid all twenty Polaroids out in front of me. One by one. The order I took them in.

By the fifth one, an image started to form. But the sixth didn’t match. I moved it to the side. It aligned with the first.

I kept going. Matching corners. Lining up shapes.

When I was done, I had four rows of five images.

And the dark, blurry photos—useless on their own—had formed something.

A picture.

A room.

And standing in the center of it… was me.

Then I heard it.

A sudden, heavy stroke of a cello bow from behind me. One sharp, low note, drawn fast and with purpose. The kind of sound that vibrates through your chest, that feels less like music and more like a warning.

The air changed immediately.

Everything went still. Not quiet—still. Like the sound had flattened the room into silence. The hum of my fridge cut out. The lights didn’t flicker, but I swear the shadows on the wall moved—just slightly—like they’d twitched in the direction of the sound.

I didn’t turn around right away. I didn’t want to.

My heart started pounding—slow at first, then faster. The sound had come from no more than six or seven feet behind me. Not far. Close enough that I should’ve felt the vibrations through the floorboards.

I listened.

Nothing.

No footsteps. No breathing. Just the after-echo of that single note, still ringing somewhere at the base of my spine.

I turned.

The room was empty.

But the mud doll that had been on the desk was now on the floor, facing me.

The doll was sitting upright. It hadn’t fallen. It had been placed.

I took a slow step forward.

Something was tucked beneath it. A small sheet of parchment—not notebook paper, not modern.  
The texture was soft and fibrous, almost like thin leather. Yellowed unevenly. The edges curled and brittle. I didn’t even have to touch it to know—this came from the same material as the pages in the book.

I crouched down and carefully slid it free. It felt wrong in my hands—too warm for paper, as though someone had just held it. The ink shimmered faintly in the light, brown-black and iron-rich.

At the center, written in a tight, rigid hand—medieval in style, the kind of lettering you see on illuminated manuscripts—was a poem.

*O' Gor! O' Gor! Won’t you eat some more?*  
*Boil us into soup, or poultry for Gor?*

*O' Father! O' Father! O' Father of Flesh,*  
*Don't we taste great? Will your hunger not rest?*

*O' Gor! Dear Gor! The King of the Feast!*  
*We are your whores, your bounty, your teeth!*

*O' Gor! O' Gor! The maw of the damned!*  
*A chew that won’t stop! A spoon for the lambs!*

The parchment felt heavier now. Slightly damp in the center, like it had begun to rot in my hand.

I set it down gently. Swallowed hard.

Then turned to the windowsill.

The doll was gone.
