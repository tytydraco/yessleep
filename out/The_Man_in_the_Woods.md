I've been living in this house for about 10 years now, and I've always felt like I was being watched. I've never seen anything, but I can just feel it. It's like there's someone out there, in the woods, just waiting for me to make a mistake.  
  
It started a few months ago. I was walking home from work late one night, and I saw a figure standing in the shadows of the trees. I couldn't make out any details, but I could tell it was a man. He just stood there, watching me, as I walked by.  
  
I tried to forget about it, but I couldn't. I started having nightmares about the man in the woods. In my dreams, he would chase me through the trees, his face hidden in the shadows. I would always wake up before he caught me, but I could still feel his breath on my neck.  
  
I started to avoid going outside at night. I would stay inside and watch TV, or read a book, anything to keep my mind off of the man in the woods. But I knew he was still out there, waiting for me.  
  
One night, I couldn't sleep. I was tossing and turning in bed, trying to get comfortable. I finally gave up and got out of bed. I went to the kitchen to get a glass of water.  
  
As I was standing in the kitchen, I heard a noise outside. I went to the window and looked out. I couldn't see anything, but I could hear the sound of someone moving through the trees.  
  
I froze. I didn't know what to do. I wanted to call the police, but I was afraid that if I made a sound, the man would hear me.  
  
I stood there for a few minutes, just listening. The sound of movement in the trees stopped. I waited a few more minutes, and then I went back to bed.  
  
I didn't sleep well that night. I kept thinking about the man in the woods. I was afraid that he was going to come for me.  
  
The next day, I went to the police. I told them about the man in the woods, but they didn't believe me. They said that there was no one in the woods, and that I was just imagining things.  
  
I know what I saw, and I know what I heard. I'm not crazy. The man in the woods is real, and he's out there, waiting for me.  
  
I don't know what to do. I'm afraid to go outside, and I'm afraid to stay inside. I'm afraid for my life.  
  
I decided to set a trap for the man in the woods. I went to the hardware store and bought a motion sensor light and a camera. I set up the light and camera in the woods behind my house.  
  
That night, I waited. I sat in my living room, watching TV, and waiting for the motion sensor light to go off.  
  
About an hour after I went to bed, the motion sensor light went off. I jumped up and ran to the window. I looked out, and I saw the man in the woods. He was standing in the light, looking at my house.  
  
I took a picture of the man with my phone. I then called the police and told them what I had seen.  
  
The police came and took the picture. They said that they would investigate, but I haven't heard anything from them since.  
  
I'm still afraid. I don't know if the man in the woods is still out there, but I'm not taking any chances. I've bought a gun, and I'm not afraid to use it.  
  
I'm just trying to live my life, but I know that the man in the woods is out there, somewhere. And I know that he's watching me.
