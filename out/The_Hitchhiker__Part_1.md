I stand in front of the gates of hell. 

Above the tunnel's entrance, the words stare back at me, burning into my brain, searing me with a paralyzing, primal fear. I never should have left my house in Manchester. None of this would have happened if I hadn't. Now I stand here, one last time. I don't know what comes at the end. That certainty was yanked out from under me.

I never deserved this. All I wanted was to see my family again. I had plans—so many plans, things I wanted to do to make up for the time I missed. This trip was supposed to be a new beginning—a beginning that I would never see.

That day, I left later than planned. Time is a fickle thing—it slips through your fingers before you even realize it. By the time I noticed, the day was already gone—the winter sun had started to set, staining the horizon with a deep, bloody red.

My trip faded into nothing but a slow, mindless crawl through rush hour traffic—Numbly daydreaming as I inched slowly through the highway. When it seemed hopeless—stuck between impatience and resignation—I decided to take a detour, getting off Route 6 and turning onto Route 44 at the fork.

The change was slow but distinct. The suburban sprawl gave way to dense, endless forest—the trees bunched so tightly together that they only broke occasionally to reveal rare glimpses of weathered-down houses perched on the roadside. I watched as the sun slipped beyond the horizon, giving way to a black, starless sky.

My car's headlights being the only source of light that night,  lighting up the thin strip of road ahead of me. The only sounds were the low hum of the engine and the rustle of trees as the wind swept through their dry leaves. It was a quiet, meditative silence—so deep that I almost didn't notice him.

A man stood alone on the side of the road. His arm was outstretched, thumb raised—a classic hitchhiker’s gesture. His other hand waved over his head.

Looking back, I curse myself for that moment. My action was fueled by no more than a smidgen of empathy. Nonetheless, my car screeched to a stop just a couple of feet away from the man. Glancing at the side mirror, I saw him slowly approaching my car. I sighed and rolled down the passenger-side window, leaning slightly toward it

“Hey, stranger! What are you doing out here at this hour?”

The man walked up to the open window and leaned in. Now that he was closer, I could get a better look at him.

He looked to be in his late 30s, maybe early 40s—and definitely not dressed for the frigid conditions outside. His red flannel shirt was too big for his wiry frame, hanging loosely over his shoulders. His hair was long and matted, a tangled mess of red, and his beard was short but unkempt.

He looked at me with eyes as dark as green pine and smiled.

“Oh, thank God you stopped for me,” he said, his voice unnervingly cheerful for the situation he was in.“ I was starting to get worried—thought no one was gonna come down this road tonight.”

His tone was far too chipper for a man standing out in the dead of winter. I couldn't help but question it, raising my eyebrow. “You seem to be having a good time out here friend.”

“No, no, no, it’s not that... I’m just glad to finally see someone else out here, you know? I’ve been out here for a while now. Didn’t really expect to be stuck out here this late at night,” he said, offering a friendly chuckle before rubbing the back of his head.

“So then... What happened? Why are you here?” I asked, a hint of suspicion creeping into my voice.

“It’s kind of embarrassing, actually,” he admitted, glancing away. “I was taking a taxi on my way to my place, but... well... when the driver realized I didn’t have enough money to pay for the whole trip, he kicked me out and drove off. I’ve been waiting here since. ”Almost on cue, a cold gust blew past us, making us both shiver as the mistress cold wrapped around our figures.

“Where were you headed?” I asked him. “Cranston,” the stranger replied.

Almost reflexively, I scoffed.“Cranstonian,” I muttered with a sarcastic tone.

The man shot back with a smug smile. “PVD hipster,” he quipped.

I stared at him, genuinely surprised.

“How did you know?” I asked, baffled.

The stranger just shrugged his shoulders. “You’ve got it written all over you,” he said with a mischievous grin.

“Oh, fuck you,” I chuckled, knowing he was completely right. Our laughter faded quickly, swallowed by the drifting wind as it swept through, stealing away the brief joy and leaving only the eerie silence of the night. We looked at each other for what felt like ages before I finally spoke.

“Sigh... hey man, look—why don’t you just hop in? Cranston’s on the way. I could drop you off.”

His face lit up with a grateful smile“ Ha, thanks a lot ! ” he said as he opened the door and got into the passenger seat. “Look, I’ve got money back at my place, I promise. Once we get there, I’ll pay you back. I swear.”

Honestly, I highly doubted it. He didn’t look like the type of guy who had any money—struck me as more of a drifter. But maybe it was some sort of kinship with this man, or just a willingness not to be alone for the next few miles, that made me let him tag along for the ride.

As the stranger got situated in my passenger seat, I started the car and got back on the road.

“Wow, this is ancient—a Caprice! I haven’t been in one of these since my uncle had one. How the hell do you keep her running?” the stranger exclaimed, laying his hand on the dashboard like it was something sacred.

I smirked at that. “Is my car the reason you wanted to get in?” I replied.

“More or less,” the stranger chuckled to himself, leaning back in the seat with a comfortable grin. I couldn’t help but smile. It was nice to finally have someone to break the monotony of my drive.

And so, that’s how we spent the rest of our ride—just talking. About everything and nothing.

We talked about our favorite films, books, shows, and everything in between. We debated which coffee chain truly had the best brew and which one was overrated. We swapped stories about our time in university, laughing over which professor had the worst reputation in Rhode Island. We argued about which restaurant was the best spot to dine and dash—even though I don’t really do that anymore. We reminisced about our childhoods, and at some point, we even opened up about our fears and regrets. It was endless.

To say this stranger was enigmatic would be an understatement. He was just... easy to talk to. Like we’d known each other for years.

"It wasn't your fault" the stranger said, genuine sympathy leaking into his words. I tightened my grip on the wheel at this and sighed. After all this time, what felt like millennia of pain, I needed to hear those words—and they came from a man I knew nothing about.

"I just wish I knew what was going on through her head. Why would she do such a thing?" I confessed to the stranger, the truth was at the end of Faith's life , I truly didn’t know her.

"Sometimes we don't know the full extent of a person," the stranger said thoughtfully. "We don’t know what's going on in their head. We’re terrible at telling people how we feel. I wish it got better with age, but it doesn’t really. We’re afraid to tell those we love the truth—perhaps in a way, we’re afraid of facing it ourselves."

Silence.

"You must have loved her a lot?" the stranger asked gently.

"Yeah... a lot. So, so much." Each word hurt to say, like thorns piercing into my heart.

"I'm truly sorry. I know it doesn’t mean much coming from me, but I am sorry for your loss Alex" the stranger said, with a genuine, empathetic sadness etched across his face.

"Yeah... thank you," I said softly.

Silence again.

"Christ, you really know how to make a man spill his guts, huh?" I joked, breaking up the awkward silence that loomed between us.

"Yeah. I’ve been told I’m a good listener. I don’t really know how, honestly. I’ve always just been good at Empathizing," the stranger said, leaning back in his chair.

"That being said, I never would have guessed you spent a couple of years in prison. The PVD Hipster part I could read, but not the jail thing—you don’t look like someone who’s spent time in the slammer."

"Do ex-convicts usually have a look to them?" I questioned him.

"Usually, yeah. They act all rough, constantly on edge—like they have something shoved up their ass. Honestly, they probably already have" the stranger remarked.

"Holy shit dude!" I said, genuinely surprised.

"It happens more than you think.,,,,,,, You don't swing that way do you ?" He gave me a skeptical, playfully horrified look.

"No, no, no, no! Jeez, ha, stop, dude. My time in prison wasn’t that bad. I spent most of my time staying out of people’s way and minding my own business. Kind of what helped me in the end, now that I think about it. People really don’t bother you if they don’t acknowledge you exist. I spent most of my time working on myself there—read a lot, mostly religious texts. Don’t worry, I’m not trying to convert you. After the drug bust, I spent some time really reflecting on my life— spiritual shit, you know. After Faith’s death, I was shattered. I did some really stupid shit. That forced solitude really gave me time to reflect and get myself straightened out."

"I'm glad you're doing better now. Would have been a shame—would’ve never gotten to meet you then," the stranger said, looking out the window toward the dark, inky blackness outside. That’s when it dawned on me—I never really got the stranger’s name. I felt guilty about not knowing. Here this stranger was, listening to my issues with all my complicated emotions, and I couldn’t even be bothered to ask his name.

"Hey, sorry if this is out of the blue, but I never really got your name. What is it?"

Silence.

I spared a glance to where he was seated—he was still staring out my passenger-side window, entranced by the murky blackness. Deducing that he must not have heard my question, I nudged him with my elbow.

He felt cold.

"Holy shit, dude! Your a fucking ice cube!" I exclaimed, startled.

At this, the stranger was pulled away from his trance as he turned to look at me.

"Huh? S-Sorry, what did you say before that?" he asked groggily, as if he had just woken up from a dream.

"I asked your name. But never mind that—do you need me to turn on the car heater? You shouldn’t be this cold," I asked him, still unnerved.

"Oh, no, you don’t have to do that. I’ve always been this cold. You’re not the first one who’s ever touched me and said the same thing," he answered, as casually as he could manage.

"Are you sure that's normal? "

"Don’t worry about it. It’s normal," he abruptly cut me off. To my chagrin, I realized I must have hit a nerve.

"You asked for my name, right? Sorry, I was distracted. Sometimes... I forget. It just takes me a while to remember it," he said, his tone distant.

I was taken aback by this. What the hell was he talking about? I stared at him, eagerly waiting as he continued.

"It’s an old name. It takes me a bit of time to translate it into a more common word. It’s Cha—"

HOOONK!

I yanked the steering wheel to the right as a pair of bright headlights came rushing toward us. My car swerved back into the correct lane just in time as a semi-truck roared past us, missing by a hair. My heart was pounding heavily in my chest—I could have died. Worse, I could have gotten both of us killed. One more second, and we would have been smear on the asphalt.

I instantly turned toward the stranger to offer my apologies for my carelessness, but he just stared back at me, unfazed, and shrugged.

"They’re coming from Naraka. They are at fault for trying to outrun the inevitable," he said, his tone still cold.

That caught me by surprise. How did he know where the truck was coming from?

"N-Naraka? W-What the hell are you talking about?" I blurted out.

The stranger just dismissively waved his hand at that.

"You wouldn’t remember. No one really does. Some people pass through it; others don’t. Don’t worry —we’re almost there." the strange said What the fuck was he talking about? The stranger was completely different now. What used to be a joyful and enigmatic individual had transformed in an instant—a cold, uncaring presence now sat beside me. It was like someone else had taken his place, and it all happened with the snap of a finger. Still, there was a strange gleam in his eyes, a kind of feverish light.

“We’re almost there,” he muttered, his voice carrying a strange, almost nostalgic tone—like someone returning home after years away.

“Hey, hey! What the fuck, man? What’s with this switch? You’re creeping me out. I thought you were from Cranston. You... you haven’t been lying to me, right?” I snapped, my nerves frayed by his sudden change. I hated being creeped out, and this was pushing it too far.

No response.

I turned toward the stranger. He was staring straight ahead, eyes reflecting a gleam as if a light was bouncing off them. How?

“You know... the jumping spider lets itself look like prey when it meets other spiders,” he blurted out, his gaze fixed on the road ahead.

“Alright, fuck this. Get out of my car,” I growled, gripping the wheel tighter. I didn’t know who this guy thought he was, but I didn’t appreciate being deceived. Whoever this man in my passenger seat was now, he wasn’t the same guy I’d been spilling my guilt to earlier.

“Keep your foot on the pedal. You’ll die if you let go.”

I froze. He turned to me, and that’s when I saw it—his eyes were pure darkness, void-like, with a single pinpoint of light, sharp as a needle tip, glowing in the center. My heart spiked, but my mind was clearer than ever. I didn’t know why, but I did as he said. At that moment, I believed him. I truly believed that if I stopped, I would die.

“It’s funny, really,” he continued. “The spider thinks itself so mighty within its web—safe, invincible. Everything that steps into it is his prey. He knows he’s stronger, so he pursues the weaker ones, because that’s the law of his world. But he forgets the true law of nature... that he too can be hunted.”

The man kept talking, his voice cold, almost analytical.

“Alex, you’ve lied to me. Ever since this trip started, you’ve lied—to me, to yourself. I thought I could offer you comfort, Alex. But seeing you now... you make me sick. You truly deserve this.”

My throat tightened. “W-what do I deserve?” I whispered, forcing the words out.

He just looked straight ahead again. Then, he said it, low and calm, but it carried a weight that made my stomach drop.

“That’s my stop.”

The tunnel appeared suddenly, emerging from the darkness—a massive, gaping mouth ready to swallow us whole. Above it, a green sign, in words, faded from time.

Welcome to Naraka.

I barely had time to process it. My reaction was slower than it should have been, overwhelmed by dread. We were swallowed by the tunnel, and in that instant, every sense vanished. There was no sound, no light—no feeling at all. Just nothingness.

I slammed the brakes, forcing myself to stay conscious despite the paralyzing fear.

When the car finally jerked to a halt, I found myself on the other side of the tunnel. My senses returned—the rustle of leaves in the wind, the warmth of the sun on my skin, and my heartbeat thundering in my ears.

I looked to the passenger seat, ready to yell, ready to shove him out.

But there was no one there. The seat was empty, positioned just as it had been before I picked him up. I sat there, alone on the other side of the tunnel.

Alone in Naraka.

Milliseconds became seconds, seconds became minutes. Time continued to march on as I sat in my car on the other side of the tunnel. My mind played on repeat what had just happened. The pit in my stomach grew deeper and deeper—a sense of absolute dread.

How did he disappear!? He was right there! No—how was that possible!? What did he mean? Is this Naraka!? Am I in Naraka!?

I pushed those thoughts down, breathing deeply as I shoved them into the dark recesses of my mind. I had to compose myself—I didn’t have time to unravel. I wasn’t going to spend another minute here. Whatever had just happened, I wasn’t going to deal with it. There was a pathway a couple of miles back that would take me back to my original route—Route 6. I resolved to reach it.

I turned the car around and stopped. I stared at the empty darkness in front of me —a black hole that consumed all light. I tightened my grip on the wheel and drove into the tunnel.

In a few seconds, I was out on the other side. I glanced at my rearview mirror and felt relief wash over me as I saw the green sign slowly fade into the distance.

It wasn’t long before I fell into a quiet, empty state, staring at the road—my brain an empty static of dead channels as I watched the double lines on the road pass by. I refused to let myself think about the situation throughout the drive.

It was in that empty state that a thought wormed into my subconscious. How long had I been driving? I glanced at my car radio clock: 2:34.

My sense of time was nonexistent in that numb state, but I’d been driving for what felt like ages. Why hadn’t I seen the exit by now?

I kept driving, desperately hoping to find an exit—a break in the trees, a house, anything other than the mass of looming black giants swaying in the breeze. But the exit never appeared.

I pulled my car over to the side of the road and reached into my glove compartment, pulling out a worn-out map. I gently unfolded it, the paper crinkling as I laid it on the driver’s wheel and scanned for any nearby road. It took me a while to pinpoint my last location, but there it was—South Frontage Road. My door out of hell.

I threw the map onto the passenger seat and glanced at the car clock.

The digital display still read 2:34.

My fist connected with the car radio. My breath was lodged in my throat as I continued to slam my fist into the digital display. Each hit became more frantic, more desperate— a quiet prayer whispered between every strike, begging it to change. To move just a single digit.

Nothing happened.

Then the car radio turned on.

My fist froze in mid-air, just inches away from striking again. I stood there, paralyzed like a deer in headlights, as a faint sound slipped into the static—a faint, distant sound of a woman weeping.

It lasted no more than a few seconds before abruptly cutting off, leaving an empty silence.

Desperation fueled me as I got back onto the road, panicked I pressed my foot into the gas pedal. My car started to pick up speed, tearing down the road. I didn’t care at that point—I just wanted out. Honestly, the idea of going to prison again, a couple weeks behind iron bars, was nothing compared to this endless, black road.

My eyes darted from side to side, searching for signs—anything to prove that I wasn’t losing my mind, that there was a way out of this.

Then, like a revelation, my eyes caught the glimmer of a sign reflecting off my headlights: South Frontage Road.

My tires screeched as I swerved onto the road—my escape route.

I eventually eased off the gas pedal. Once I had put enough distance between me and Route 44, I let out a sigh of relief and began to relax. I was home free. If I kept going down this road, I would eventually hit 295—and from there, freedom, normalcy.

Shhhhhhh

The radio turned back on.

Static filled the entire car once more, accompanied by the sound of a woman crying.

It was soft again, just under the grating noise of the static, but it pierced through as clear as day.

I froze, my breath caught between my throat. The crying was familiar. It was—

“Fuck this!” The words escaped my mouth as I reached to turn off the radio.

Shhhhh

It never turned off.

I pressed the button again.

Shhhhhh

I pressed it again. And again. And again. The cries grew louder.

The wailing continued to intensify—blending into a chorus of new voices. The voices of people pleading, sobbing, wailing. Each one distinct as they began to merge into a sick, rising cacophony, growing louder and louder, until it drowned out the static completely.

My blood turned to ice as a single word broke through the chaotic noise—a hateful, high-pitched scream. A name. My name.

“Alex!”

A dam broke within me as memories flooded in—memories I had tried to suppress. That voice—it was familiar.

“Alex! Alex! ALEX!” The woman’s voice continued to yell.

Other voices joined in, rising in violent, chaotic harmony—a choir of hate calling my name over and over again.

I tried to block it out—to suppress and bury it deep. But it was too much. The memories crashed into me, threatening to drag me down under.

Until—

Screeeeech

I slammed my foot on the brake, skidding to a halt.

The voices stopped.

For a moment, it was as if the world had paused. My breathing slowed, and my pulse pounded in my ears as I struggled to focus at what was in front of me 

Then I saw it.

Hanging above the tunnel entrance, in words, faded from time .

“Welcome to Naraka.”
