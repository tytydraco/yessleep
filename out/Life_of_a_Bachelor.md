After graduation, I thought life would be easy. I had a degree, after all. Isn't that supposed to be the golden ticket? I was way over my head when I decided to live alone, thinking I could manage without my parents' support.

Reality hit me harder than I expected, if I even expected it. My teachers were liars. Study hard, they said. Don't worry about anything else, they advised. You'll enjoy life later, they promised. Bullshit.

I regret listening to them. I regret that I never once stumbled home drunk, that I've never even had a wild phase. Hell, I'm still a virgin, but that one's probably on me.

Now? I'm stuck working a dead-end job. It pays enough to keep food on my table and a roof over my head, and thankfully, my bosses are cool people. Thanks to them, I've managed to save up a little money, though it's not nearly enough to leave just yet. Because I hate it here.

The rent is dirt cheap, sure. But that's because this place is falling apart. I don't even know how the landlord is running this complex legally. At first, I thought I could deal with it. The room's affordable, and it's close to several convenience stores. What more could I need?

Well, it turns out there was one tiny detail Bill or the landlord forgot to mention when I moved into this place, which is haunted as hell.

I only found out from the couple living downstairs.

They used to live in my apartment before they moved.

Apparently, the room next to mine is a hotspot for ghosts and other supernatural crap.

I don't believe in that kind of thing.

Or at least, I didn't.

But after everything I've seen and heard?

I'm not so sure anymore.

Yeah. Let's just say I'm starting to have second thoughts.

The first nights were fine. No strange sounds, no weird occurrences, just me, my crappy job, and my bed.

Days went on like that.

But then, something spooked me.

That particular evening, I had just come back from hell. We were short-staffed, and my bosses offered me double pay if I did extra work. I jumped at the opportunity but had never felt so physically drained when I got home.

I barely locked my door before crashing onto my bed. Sleep took me instantly.

Then BANG.

A loud thud against my wall ripped me from my sleep. Half-awake and annoyed, I groggily shouted, "Quit it!" and smacked the wall beside my bed before rolling over to sleep.

BANG.

This time, it wasn't just a thud. There was something else, a muffled noise.

Annoyance quickly turned into frustration. Who the hell was making noise this late? Still half-asleep, I stumbled out of bed, determined to give them a piece of my mind.

But the second I stepped into the hallway, my body froze.

The sound was coming from the empty apartment next door.

I knew for a fact that no one had moved in. I would have been the first to know. And yet, the noise came from inside. The vacant sign still hung on the door, swaying slightly as if mocking me.

I stood there. I thought back to the conversation about the room but shook my head. Instead, I convinced myself it was just my imagination, stress, and exhaustion playing tricks on me. Even though I knew… I had heard it. Clear as day.

Ultimately, I was too tired to think, too drained to care.

So, I did what any sane, sleep-deprived person would do: shut my door, lock it, and force myself to sleep.

The noise didn't come back for the rest of the night.

The next day, I went to the landlord to complain about the noise.

As expected, he gave me that look, half amused, half annoyed, but humored me anyway.

When I returned from work, he was waiting outside my door, arms crossed.

"Checked the room," he said. "Nothing. Spotless. Just like I left it."

I frowned. That couldn't be right.

Bill clapped a hand on my shoulder, his voice carrying that familiar mix of gruff patience and dismissal.

"Kid, I know living alone can be nerve-wracking, but don't let it get to your head."

And just like that, the conversation was over.

I wanted to argue. I tried to tell him that I knew what I heard, that it wasn't just in my head.

But I didn't.

By that point, I had almost convinced myself it was just stress. Just exhaustion.

Maybe even a bad dream.

I wanted it to be a dream.

That was easier to believe than the alternative.

And for a while, that explanation worked.

Nothing happened the next day. Or the day after that.

For a moment, I almost believed it had been a fluke. Just stress. Just exhaustion.

Then, exactly one week later, at almost the same time.

It happened again.

I was wide awake this time, playing games on my laptop, when I heard it.

A thud.

I froze.

This time, I knew I wasn't imagining it.

Slowly, I got up, my heart hammering against my ribs. My feet felt heavy as I moved toward the door, every instinct screaming to stop.

I hesitated.

Then, swallowing hard, I pressed my eye against the peephole.

No one lived there.

So what's the harm, right?

I regretted it instantly.

Because what I saw is burned into my memory forever.

Inside the empty apartment, I saw myself.

But how?

I stood against the far wall, my back pressed against it, eyes locked on something just out of view.

My face was torn.

Like something had ripped into it, jagged and raw. Pieces of flesh were missing, as if something had taken a bite.

My hand was twisted and mangled, fingers bent in unnatural angles, barely holding together.

Then, without warning, something grabbed me.

I didn't see what.

I only saw the force.

I watched as I was yanked forward and slammed into the wall again.

The impact shook the door.

Then I heard it.

A scream.

My scream.

The sound of pure, desperate terror. My own voice.

I stood there, frozen.

I saw myself being dragged.

By my feet.

Out of sight.

I don't know how long I stood there before my legs finally gave out. I stumbled back, hitting the floor, gasping for air.

My own body had betrayed me.

Because I knew what I saw.

I didn't know if it was panic or adrenaline, but I bolted downstairs, barely able to form words, as I half-shouted and banged on Bill's door.

He swung the door open, eyes wide with irritation, his mouth already open to yell.

But then he stopped.

Maybe it was the look on my face.

I was pale, sweating, my chest heaving as if I had run a marathon. I could feel my lips trembling, and my eyes were stinging, dangerously close to tears.

Bill's expression softened, just a little

To his credit, he tried to calm me down. Even gave me a few awkward pats on the shoulder.

But he couldn't entirely hide his why-are-you-bothering-me-at-this-hour face.

With a heavy sigh, he grabbed the keys hanging by his doorway and followed me back up the stairs.

He unlocked the door.

We stepped inside.

And... nothing.

No blood. No broken furniture. No trace of anything that had happened at all.

It was as if the room had been untouched.

Bill let out another long sigh, rubbing his temples like a man with far better things to do at this hour. Then, without hesitation, he pushed me out of the doorway.

"Kid, listen," he said, clearly done with me. "You need to stop stressing yourself out. Either that or go see a doctor."

I opened my mouth to argue, but he cut me off.

"And stop listening to that crazy couple," he added, his tone sharper now. "I've been here for years and haven't seen a single ghost. Because if I had, I would've already sold this dump and moved to the damn Bahamas."

Then, as if that settled everything, he clapped a hand on my shoulder.

"Son, go rest."

And with that, he walked away, leaving me alone in the hallway.

My stomach twisted in protest. I couldn't accept that explanation.

I knew what I saw.

That was me inside that room.

I wanted to leave. More than anything. But what if it was all in my head? What if I was just hallucinating? What if…

No matter how much I questioned it, the fact remained.

I saw inside the room. It was clean. Empty. Just like mine had been when I first moved in.

Was it really just stress?

With a heavy breath, I stepped back inside my apartment and locked the door behind me.

Sleep never came.

No matter how hard I tried, the image of my own body being dragged away was seared into my mind. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw it again. The twisted limbs. The desperate scream. The way my feet disappeared into the darkness.

By the time morning arrived, I felt like a corpse myself.

Miserable. Drained. Barely holding on.

I dragged myself to work, dark eye bags as proof of my sleepless night. My boss even told me to go home, but I refused. Staying busy felt better than sitting alone in that apartment.

That became my routine for the rest of the week: Work, come home, lock the door, collapse into bed.

And for a while... nothing happened.

No bangs. No slams.

No muffled voices. No screams.

Time ticked, and the days passed until the day I was expecting came. This time, I was ready.

I sat there, wide awake, waiting. Facing that wall. Heart pounding.

But… nothing came.

Silence.

But still, nothing happened.

Eventually, my body gave in. I crashed, getting two hours of restless, dreamless sleep before dragging myself back to work.

When I came home, exhaustion weighed on me like a lead blanket. Last night's paranoia, the long shift, and the sheer mental drain of it all pressed down on me.

As I neared my apartment door, I noticed Bill standing outside, talking to someone. A woman.

I tried to ignore them, but Bill spotted me and waved me over.

With his usual gruff enthusiasm, he clapped a hand on my back and nodded toward the woman beside him.

"This is Holly," he said casually. "She's taking the next apartment."

My eyes widened.

The next apartment?

I barely had time to process that before the woman stretched out her hand with a friendly smile. "Hi, I'm Holly."

I hesitated, standing awkwardly, my mind racing with a million thoughts.

Before I could react, Bill nudged me on the side, snapping me out of it.

I reached out and shook her hand. "Michael," I said, my voice coming out stiff.

She smiled again, and for some reason, my heart fluttered.

I wasn't sure why. Maybe it was exhaustion. Perhaps it was something else.

Either way, I made a quick excuse to leave. "Uh, nice to meet you. Gotta go. Long day."

Awkwardly, I turned, fumbled with the doorknob, unlocked it, and hurried inside.

I mumbled a quick "bye" to Holly before shutting the door behind me.

I went straight to bed, the awkward encounter in the hallway already pushed to the back of my mind.

But I never expected what followed.

Things started to feel strange.

Somehow, I kept bumping into Holly everywhere. At first, I chalked it up to coincidence, but it happened too often to ignore.

I saw her at the store. On the street. Even at work, as a customer, or just passing by outside the store.

I started to wonder if she worked nearby.

At first, I brushed it off as a coincidence.

But after days of seeing her constantly, even walking home together sometimes, I couldn't ignore it anymore.

I know this might sound like some cheesy love story, but I'm not making this up.

Every now and then, Holly would knock on my door, either to say hello or bring me snacks.

It happened often enough that I started wondering, maybe, just maybe, she had a crush on me?

That couldn't be right.

But I didn't question it. I just went along with whatever was happening.

I'd thank her, take whatever she brought, and set it on the counter next to my kitchen, eventually putting it inside a glass jar.

I never actually ate them. I wasn't a fan of candy, but I figured I'd save them for when I got cravings.

And that became our routine.

Holly kept appearing.

Always at the right place.

Always at the right time.

Then, one day, she asked if she could come inside.

But instead of feeling the butterflies a bachelor should have in my situation, my mind was waging war against itself.

I hesitated, just for a second.

Something about the way she asked felt too cheery.

But standing there, awkwardly blocking the doorway, I forced a chuckle and stepped aside.

"Uh, yeah, sure. Come in."

She moved past me with that same effortless grace, but she stopped when she crossed the threshold.

Her eyes locked onto the glass jar in my kitchen.

The one filled with all the candies she had given me.

She didn't move. She didn't say a word.

A strange tension settled in the air.

For a moment, I wondered if I had done something wrong. Maybe she thought I was hoarding them like some kind of freak? I opened my mouth to make a joke, to brush it off.

But before I did, she turned.

Quick. Mechanical. Like someone suddenly remembering they left the stove on.

"Forgot something," she murmured, already stepping toward the door.

I blinked. That was fast.

She was already halfway out when I caught it.

A flicker in her expression.

Not disappointment. Not confusion.

Anger.

A small twitch in her cheek. A slight tightening at the corner of her mouth. The kind of look people make when they're trying not to react.

And just like that, she was gone.

No playful goodbye. No lingering smile. Just the soft click of the door closing behind her.

I stood there, staring at the empty space she had left behind. My stomach twisted, though I couldn't explain why.

Shook my head. Maybe I was overthinking it.

I chalked it up to… woman things.

The thought lingered longer than I expected, but I pushed it aside.

The next day, with no work to distract me, having been given a day off, I played games the entire day. Anything to keep my mind busy. Anything to keep me from thinking.

Hours blurred together. Before I knew it, night had fallen.

I was still wide awake.

Because when I glanced at my phone, my stomach twisted.

It was that day again.

The thought had never truly left me. It had been lurking in the back of my mind, waiting for the right moment to claw its way forward.

Would I hear it again?

The weight of last week's many sleepless nights settled over me like an anvil, crushing, suffocating.

I find myself again, sitting there. Unmoving.

Eyes locked onto the wall.

Waiting.

Waiting for the thud.

But instead, instead of the thud, I heard a knock.

A normal sound. A human sound.

And somehow, that made it worse.

I jolted upright, my heart hammering against my ribs. For a moment, I just sat there, frozen, my mind trying to catch up with reality. Slowly, I forced myself to move, my legs unsteady as I stepped forward.

I pressed my eye to the peephole.

Holly.

A quiet breath of relief left me. I hadn't realized I'd been holding it.

She stood there, smiling, holding out another candy bar.

I hesitated before opening the door.

She gave me that same friendly, easygoing smile, the one I was used to by now, and pressed the candy into my hand.

I slipped it into my pocket, awkward, unsure what to say. But before I could even mumble a thanks, she spoke.

"Hey… can you come over to my apartment?"

I froze.

The words hit me like a cold gust of wind.

I had never heard those words from a woman in my entire life.

For a fraction of a second, my brain short-circuited. Was this real? Was I dreaming?

Then, like a bullet shattering glass, the vision came back.

The peephole.

The thud.

Me.

Being dragged away.

My mouth went dry. My entire body locked up.

Holly tilted her head slightly. "Hey… are you okay?" she asked, her voice soft, full of concern.

I didn't answer. I couldn't. Something inside me was screaming at me, do not go.

I swallowed hard. My throat felt tight, my hands clammy. Say something. Make an excuse. Don't go.

Before I could stop myself, the words spilled out.

"S-Sorry, Holly," I stammered, my voice barely steady. "I have some work to finish for my boss."

I had no idea why I said it. I just knew I had to.

For a second, her smile didn't falter. She didn't even blink.

She leaned in slightly.

"Can't you just finish that later? I'll make it worth your while."

Her tone was teasing. Flirty. The kind of voice that should have made my heart race.

But instead, all I felt was wrongness.

Thick. Heavy. Suffocating.

It wasn't attraction. It wasn't excitement. It was the kind of feeling that makes your instincts claw at you, begging you to run.

My feet refused to move forward. It was as if something had wrapped around my spine, locking me in place.

I forced myself to swallow. "Sorry, Holly. I just… can't. My boss will fire me."

Silence.

We stood there in the dimly lit hallway, her eyes locked onto mine.

And then, I saw it.

A tiny shift in her face. It was so small and quick that I might have missed it if I had blinked.

Not disappointment. Not sadness.

Annoyance.

No, disdain.

The same look I'd seen countless times at work. Customers who expected to get their way but didn't.

The moment passed in an instant.

Her lips curled back into a soft, effortless laugh like nothing had happened. She nodded. "Okay."

Then, without another word, she turned and walked back into her apartment next door. I stood there, frozen, gripping the doorframe like my life depended on it.

Because deep down… I knew.

That was not a normal reaction.

And Holly?

She was not just some friendly neighbor.

The next day came faster than I expected.

Somehow, I had slept without realizing it. No tossing, no turning, no staring at the ceiling, waiting for exhaustion to take me. Just a deep, dreamless sleep, like slipping beneath the surface of a still lake.

When I woke up, something was different.

I wasn't exhausted for the first time in what felt like forever. The tightness in my chest was gone. My muscles weren't coiled like springs, and my mind wasn't running in frantic circles. I felt… lighter.

Like a weight, I hadn't even realized I was carrying had finally been lifted.

I didn't know why. I just knew that it had.

Then I saw Holly.

As I stepped into the hallway, she was already there, walking past. My body reacted on autopilot, my hand lifting slightly in a half-wave.

She didn't look at me.

No smile. No greeting.

Just... nothing.

It was like I wasn't even there.

A flicker of confusion passed through me, but another feeling settled in its place before I could dwell on it.

Relief.

I didn't understand it. I should have felt weird or at least a little embarrassed, but instead, there was a quiet, steady relief.

Why was I okay with this?

Had I secretly wanted her to ignore me all along?

The thought made me uneasy as if I was missing a piece of a puzzle I wasn't sure I wanted to solve.

Shaking it off, I went to work.

I didn't see Holly for the rest of the day. But when I finally did, she wasn't alone.

She was with someone else.

Laughing.

Something about the way she laughed made my stomach turn. It wasn't jealousy. It wasn't bitterness. It was something deeper.

Because I recognized it.

The way she smiled. The way she tilted her head at just the right angle. The way her voice lilted slightly, perfectly balancing playful and inviting.

It was the same as last week.

The same way she had smiled at me.

Customer service teaches you to notice these things. You learn how people act when they're being genuine and when they're performing.

When they're using a well-practiced script to get what they want.

And when Holly was doing it to me, I was too stunned by her to notice.

At the time, I didn't question it. I couldn't imagine why she would be interested in me, so I had no reason to think twice about it.

But now, I can't stop thinking about it.

My eyes drifted to the guy she was with.

I knew him.

He lived downstairs. I had seen him stumbling through the hallways, the type to party all night and come home drunk. Loud. Careless. A mess.

Not the type of guy Holly should be interested in.

Not the type of…

How do I know that?

The thought barely formed before something cold slid down my spine.

A deep, insistent feeling settled in my gut like my body knew something before my brain could catch up.

Ignore it.

Don't look. Don't think. Just go home.

I don't know why, but I listened.

And I did not look back.

As I was leaving for work the next day, I saw him again, the man Holly had been with yesterday.

He stepped out of his room, busy talking on his phone, unaware of me watching. My eyes immediately went to the candy bar he tore open before taking a bite.

It was the same candy Holly always gave me.

I wanted to stay. To watch him. To see if anything happened.

But I was running late.

As the days passed, I kept seeing them together.

Laughing. Flirting. Acting like a couple.

Every time I caught a glimpse, something twisted inside me.

Not jealousy. Not anger. Something stranger.

A feeling that I should be happy.

That the man she was with… wasn't me.

And that thought has been screwing with me ever since.

After another grueling overtime shift, I saw them again by the end of the week.

They walked into Holly's apartment, their laughter echoing faintly in the hallway.

Exhaustion weighed me down, dulling any sense of concern. I shut my door, collapsed onto my bed, and let the darkness take me.

I don't know how long I slept.

But suddenly.

A deep, resonating THUD.

I jolted awake, heart racing, eyes locked onto that wall.

A second passed. Then,

Another thud.

And this time,

A scream.

Then, a third impact was louder and more violent, followed by silence.

I sat there, frozen.

But this time, even if it embarrassed me, I couldn't ignore it anymore.

I ran downstairs and banged on Bill's door, glad he was awake.

But this time, he didn't doubt me when I told him what I heard.

Because he had heard it, too.

With a grim look, he grabbed his keys, and we hurried upstairs.

Bill banged on the door.

"Holly!" he shouted.

No response.

He banged again. Pounded his fist against the wood.

Still nothing.

I watched as he pressed his eye to the peephole.

Then, after a second, he muttered a curse.

"It's covered."

Something was blocking it from the inside.

Without another word, he jammed the key into the lock. Twisted it. Opened the door.

And what we saw stuck with me forever.

My eyes locked onto the wall.

And for a split second, I saw myself.

My own face overlapped with the body on the wall.

Then, the vision faded, and I was staring at him.

The guy from downstairs plastered against the wall.

His body was contorted, arms and legs bent at impossible angles. Blood painted the wall behind him, dripping in slow, uneven streaks.

Bill snapped at me, shouting to call the police.

I fumbled for my phone, my mind still trying to piece together reality from what I had just seen.

And Holly?

Neither Bill, who entered the room first, nor the police, who conducted a full investigation afterward, ever found her.

Following that day, after a sleepless night, without hesitation, I swallowed my pride, packed my bag, and left.

I didn't have much, but that didn't matter.

I handed my keys to Bill.

To his credit, he didn't ask any questions.

He just nodded, sighed, and waived off my last rent.

Maybe he understood. Perhaps he had seen this before.

Whatever the case, I was done.

I returned to my parents' house.

I didn't care if they scolded me for leaving in the first place.

I just wanted out.

Even though it was farther now, I kept the same job, forcing me to use my bike.

But I didn't care.

I swore I would never live in a place like that again.

So, I set my pride aside.

I worked.

I saved.

And I never looked back.

Months passed, and the incident faded into the depths of my memory. Eventually, I landed a better-paying job thanks to my dad's connections.

With the money I saved, I bought a second-hand car.

Then, one evening, my thoughts wandered while stuck at a traffic light.

For reasons I couldn't explain, I turned my head.

And I saw her.

Holly.

Standing on the sidewalk.

Smiling.

Waving at me.

For a split second, I almost waved back before my body froze.

Then, I felt it.

That feeling I could never describe before.

Now, I finally understood it. What I was experiencing felt eerily similar to those wildlife documentaries.

The feeling of being stalked by a predator.

I sat there, frozen, staring at her.

HOOOONK!

A car blared behind me, a man cursing me out.

I snapped out of it, my hands gripping the wheel.

But before I drove off, I saw her entering an expensive-looking car.

With someone else.

I didn't wait to see who.

I just panicked and floored [it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuietCornerTales/)
