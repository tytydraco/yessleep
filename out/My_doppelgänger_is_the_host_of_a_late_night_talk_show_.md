Made if I write it they’ll believe me.Do you know how hard it is to get a phone in a hospital.Well it started a few months ago I think I was driving home from work I have very bad insomnia so when I got home I didn’t even try to go to sleep. I was on my phone for a couple hours before I got bored of it then I did something that would change my life.

I turned on the tv I was looking for something to watch when I found a late night talk show.But there was something weird about it the host looks exactly like me.(I probably should have took a picture but I didn’t) I was very confused but thrilled by he was doing a magic trick he said “I will cut this woman in half.“ he had a very optimistic voice .

He started doing the magic trick then he proceeded to just talk and stuff I don’t remember exactly what he was talking about but it was pretty weird. The next day all I could think about was the show I was so distracted I got into a pretty bad car accident. The guy I crashed into said to me “do you even watch the road you motherfucker.” I just said “I’m sorry.” And then I left.

I had to take an Uber to work the driver’s car’s windows were so tinted I wasn’t even sure if it was legal.I asked him “you got some tinted windows.” He replied “I just like the way it looks.” Soon enough I arrived something felt off about the building it could just be the talk show being on my mind.

I began becoming obsessed with it I tried for were it was filmed but had no luck.On one Sunday I was going to church and had a crucifix in my pocket.When I entered the Uber the driver said “put the crucifix away.” I replied “how did you know I had one and why does it matter.” He paused. I put together the pieces.

He’s a vampire that’s why the windows are so tinted he has no reflection and he’s so pale. I asked “are you a vampire.” And he said “yes.” I was terrified I didn’t think vampires were real. I quickly jumped through the window and out the Uber.

I ran through the city but it was like a maze a never ending labyrinth.billboards for the talk show everywhere and it was on all the tvs. I then saw a man with large eyes no ears and he was skinny. I asked him “do you know what’s going on?” Then he replied In a raspy voice “go to the tv go to the tv.” 

I didn’t know what he meant I keep wondering trying to find something I could swear my shadow was moving.All the clocks ticked backwards and everything became photonegative.

 I decided that this has to end then I jumped through a TV screen and into the talk show.I made eye contact with the host he said” you made it faster than I expected.” I then said “what’s going on who are you and who’s the vampire.” 

Then he told me “you are going to be the next host the vampire was meant to guide you.”then I proceeded to grab a sharp object and stab him with it.He started bleeding white blood then he grabbed me and put me on the wall.

I then kicked him back and ran out side everything seemed normal.But I had his blood all over me and someone called the police.When they arrived they asked for my ID i said “I don’t have it on me but I’ll go get it “they took me home but when we arrived someone else was living in it.

I told them “I don’t know who these people are but they must have broken into my house.”The police brought me to the station and kept questioning me when I told them about the show they couldn’t find it.after I told them everything they sent me here where I’m writing this.
