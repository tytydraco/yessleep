The sweat on my forehead felt frigid and damp. I sat defiantly against the feeling, remembering that there had to be some sort of logical reasoning for all of this. I was hungover, people do dumb shit when they are hungover, maybe I just dropped them or something. I pushed my chair back, and letting my knee hit the wooden floor with a dead-weight thud, I eased myself down onto my stomach and could see nothing. No sign of the paper. As I was about to push myself up, I got the sense that someone was watching me. As if someone was standing above me and watching as I got to my feet. As if that someone was enjoying it too. I didn’t want to stay in the room.

Trying to convince myself that everything was alright I got to my feet, slowly walked over to my bed, picked up the book, careful not to check if the receipt was there or not (I didn’t want to ruin the fragile illusion I was building for myself), and made my way for the bedroom door, that cold, watched feeling never once leaving me. I pushed down on the brass handle, and pulled the door towards me, as I had done a million times in my life. The door opened slightly before pulling swiftly against me, slamming solidly into the doorframe. I let go and took a step back. Outright fear had taken hold. I grabbed the handle again, pushed down frantically and pulled like a madman. The door didn’t budge, it didn’t even acknowledge my efforts either, not groaning against my weight or anything. I continued to push downward on the door handle, lifting it and pushing it down in a vain attempt to get the lock to open, tears soon began to drip down my face as each trial was met with a blunt failure. My tears soon matured into sobbing.  After a time, I sat behind the door, my back against the wall and my head in my hands, I didn’t know what to do. 

This was something entirely bizarre and frightening, what could I do? For an hour, maybe more, I pondered this question, then after a slow, methodical reconstruction of my confidence I decided I would ring my uncle. Dan was both my neighbor and my uncle, so at the very least he could be over here in a minute, kick the door in and give me a comforting lecture in his rough, agricultural Irish accent, about locks, maturity or some other shit. I smiled at the thought, and craned one leg out as I dug my hand in my pocket for my phone. The lock screen was of Mary and I on our trip to Galway. Her smile was beautiful, the twinkle of her eye captured forever on an unworthy camera. I would have given anything to have been stuck here with her. Together we could have come up with something, or at the very least comforted one another.

It felt somehow painful, as if it was an action I’d regret, to swipe up on that photo and enter my pin. I found my contacts, scroll down to ‘D’ and pressed the call icon, before placing it to my ear. The call rang, and rang, and rang, and just before I was about to lose hope and dissolve into a bumbling mess once again, the call was picked up. “DAN” I shouted in genuine excitement, “You’ve got to come over the house, I’m locked in my room and can’t get out please, plea-” There was nothing.  No noise. No sound. I held the line and waited for something, anything to confirm a living being on the other end. When from downstairs came four distinct knocks. The first three were quick. The final one was delayed. I went wide-eyed and whispered into the phone “Please Dan”. The response I got was three quick knocks and one final, delayed knock.  I threw my phone at the wall across from me and watched it as it dissembled on impact. My ears relayed the thundering of my heart as my voice became stuck somewhere in my throat. I began pulling my hair, my feet bounced irrationally on the ground, the world seemed to spin. Then, and then, a small, whiter than white, section of narrow paper slipped from under my door. Through teary eyes, my shaking hand stretched forward and picked up the receipt. The paper was pristine, as if freshly printed, the logo showed an empty bag lying crumpled, as if on the floor, with no sign of the beady eyed man.

The name of the company as was still difficult to make out, as if the printer had begun to run out of ink or something. Beneath that, a single line of text read: “One set of heavy curtains, paid in full”.  I don’t know what spurred me to react the way I did, if this had of happened to anyone else, I would have called them idiotic to jump and run toward the thing that some supernatural being had suggested. Yet, some ferocious desire to ground the situation in logic, to provide myself with some ability of control over the situation was too strong. I ran across the room but stopped just before the curtains. The air that came in the open window blew the fabric gently, the navy curtains seemed entirely unchanged. I hesitated a moment, as if the illusion of normality was better than finding out any evidence to the contrary, then reached out. The rough material felt comforting and familiar beneath my fingertips, I even felt my heartbeat slow, as the tendrils of my own free-will began to return to me. “If I shout loud enough maybe Dan will be able to hear me” I thought quietly to myself. Smiling at the idea, I tugged the curtain so that I could position myself on the sill and shout out into the garden. The curtain didn’t budge. I pulled harder and nothing. The tendrils of my own free-will began to shrivel rapidly, like a dying worm in the hot sun. I turned, so that my shoulder was near the curtain and gripping the curtains edge with both my hands I heaved with all of my strength. I remember feeling my face redden, beads of sweat began to appear, my teeth dug deep into my lips.

Nothing worked.

I roared in frightened disappointment, hoping that the curtains wouldn’t stop my voice. Then it occurred to me. I never heard any outside noise all morning. I live right by the road in an estate. I should have heard something. Heard the traffic, the neighbors’ kids, the birdsong, something. Yet I heard absolutely nothing. The realization was sharp and painful. Tears began to swell once more, and I gripped the nearest thing to me. The green mug, full of my now cold coffee. Shaking, I threw the mug at the curtain hoping that it would somehow break the glass behind it or something. Instead, the mug shattered against the soft fabric, like snow against a wall. I fell backward onto the bed, and staring at the impossible situation before me, I began to think how that day would end. I was obviously in some paranormal situation. A real one. These things don’t end like the movies. Something would have to happen to me, and I dreaded whatever that beady-eyed little fuck had planned for me. I was completely alone, trapped and entirely at the will of that thing. I apologize if this story is going along at a breakneck speed, but this is exactly how these events occurred, no sooner had I thought of what might happen to me, I happened to look down at the debris of the mug, and found, among the broken porcelain, another damned receipt. This one was different from the others. The logo had changed entirely. The beady eyed man had returned, his back facing my eyes, the bag at his feet. On the item list were two notations: a lawnmower and a new key. As I was glancing at the company name which now faintly read “Mamm”.

 I heard it. My bedroom door creaked open. I jumped from the bed and landed in a crouch, hoping that whatever opened the door slightly did not wish to come any further. Then, the door shut. Apart from my terrified panting, the room felt more silent than before. As if the air was impregnated with anticipation. Ten, fifteen, twenty, slow and petrifying seconds dragged by before the door opened a sliver once again before closing loudly and quickly. Not five seconds went by before the door opened once more, this time slightly wider, just enough so the painting that hung in the hallway could be distinguished, before shutting violently once more. Almost immediately, the door opened to its full extent before slamming with a crash into the wooden door frame. Instantly, the door shot back open, slamming with a thud into the wall behind it, the crumbling plaster not having the time to hit the floor before the door closed and returned once more to hit the wall. I’m not ashamed to admit it, during those horrifying minutes I pissed myself. The piercing screeches of the protesting hinges, the splintering of the wood, the thud against the plastered wall, it was all so chaotic, so confusing and frightening. Yet all I could do was watch on, even has the warmth trickled down my leg, I felt compelled, as if against my will, to watch on. The door kept going, kept slamming with force into both the doorframe and wall. Before stopping suddenly. 

The peace would have been welcome, in any other situation, but the tell-tale click of a locking door brought a new sense of dread to me. I brought myself to the furthest wall I could, making myself as small as I could, nestled as tightly as I could, I prayed. I prayed for deliverance, for divine intervention, ashamedly I even prayed this thing would go to someone else. I was just praying for someone to notice my lack of communication or something, when I heard it. It started in the distance. A muffled, mechanical noise. I screamed, knowing what it was. Screamed knowing that the lawnmower was travelling across the landing, its blades awkwardly hacking at the thick carpet in the hall. It got louder and louder before I could tell it was obviously outside my door. I didn’t know what to do, my praying stopped.

What would you do? I was so utterly dumbstruck by what was going on that I hadn’t even noticed myself stop crying. Judge me all you want, but until you hear a lawnmower’s blades chomp at your thin wooden door, the only thing standing in the way between you and what ever demonic thing driving it, you don’t get to have a say.

For what seemed like an eternity, those blades worked at that door. I didn’t move, I stopped screaming. I just watched in horror. The lawnmower eventually began to splutter, as if running low on fuel. When it stopped, when I could finally hear the ringing in my ears, a small, rectangular piece of paper produced itself from beneath the door. I waited a while before fetching it, and when I did, I didn’t grab it with my hand, I used *Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas* to drag it slightly closer to me. It may have been by a small amount, but anything to put that little bit more distance between me and that door was seen as an advantage at the time. This paper was stained yellow by time, it had clear repairs made to it, pen inscriptions, cello tape, glue marks. I looked at it from its position on the floor beside me for a time, before finally picking it up. When I read it, I ripped it two. It was a receipt for a funerary bouquet.

Judging by the dimming light that broke out just above the curtains, the sun must have begun to set before I rose from my desk. I wrote out a page for each of my loved ones. For Mary, the note was telling her how much I loved her. That our time together, no matter how long, was never long enough. I told her of the dreams I had for us, for the times I imagined and wished to bring into reality with her and her only. I told her that I would miss her, but that I would always look out for her. For mam, I wrote that I thanked her for raising me, for always being there, for loving me and supporting me. I wrote that I had hoped that she knew she was loved by me also, and that she was a friend as well as a parent. For dad, I wrote that I wished I had spent more time with him, that the memories of learning to ride a bike, tying my laces and playing football were those that stood out to me even now in my final moments. I told him that I loved him and thanked him for everything he had done for me. I put these notes on the bed. If I had had time, these notes could have been books, but when death is real and incoming, one realizes there is beauty in simplicity. That done, I lay down on my bed, ready to accept whatever may come.

The next morning came unexpectedly. I woke up shocked to see the sun peak through the slit in the curtain. My notes were still by my side, but the rest of the room was cleared of any signs of distress, even my phone sat, fully charged on my desk. I gingerly approached the curtains and found them light enough to pull back. I smiled in a pure, entirely honest happiness. I was alive. Thank God I was alive. I prayed prayers of gratitude before a creeping sense of fear began to interrupt my thoughts. What if that bouquet wasn’t meant for me? What if it was for Mary, Mam or Dad? My heart raced and figuring that the door and curtains were no longer stationary I tried my phone. I had three text messages from my parents, two were photos of the beach and one was telling me their plane would land at six o’clock that night. I had four missed calls from Mary, about twelve text messages describing all the ways in which I was a dick for not answering her phone calls and messages. I smiled at how ordinary the tone was. Scrolling through the messages, delighted be alive to see such creative insults, I would soon break into tears as the tone of the messages changed, and the subject matter darkened. I spent all day on the phone to Mary that day. When my parents came home, they rushed in to comfort their broken son. I cried, I howled in pain, I sat immobile on the kitchen stool for an eternity.

We bury Ryan on Wednesday.
