It was time to head back.
It was raining. 
It had been doing so for the past few days.
It hadn't done so for some time, at least for this long.
I was in the park, something I had barely done, and I had felt somewhat good.

The sun was setting behind the grey in the sky, late afternoon, and everything seemed to get darker quicker around me.

I had my hands within the pockets of my jacket, my hood over my head & my shoes splashing onto the numerous puddles on the brick laden path I walked on.

The rainfall grew harder by the minute and I was getting soaked. I didn't mind the rain but it was getting too strong to walk properly.

A tree up ahead standing by a lamp post with a warm orange light.
Pretty large canopy. Good shade.
I quickly walked to it and the rainfall seemed to outright vanish under its leaves, leaving the occasional minute droplet falling between it and onto me.

I pull the hood off my head, run a hand through the dampness of my hair & swore under my breath, barely audible in the growing rainstorm around me.

I reach into my jeans pocket, which was surprisingly dry, and pull out my smartphone.

5:08pm, the clock face display read.
I looked around, it was already dark enough to have the nearby lamp cast a visible glow.

I took a breath and began to type out a text.
Damn.
No service.

"Really..?" I say out loud. "Must be the rain. Great.", I say to myself as I pocketed the phone.

A rain drop falls.
Hits me square in my right eye.
I swear again & wipe the water from my face.

I hear a noise behind me, in the direction of a grass covered clearing, a sound of rustling of wet grass and movement.

I turn as my eyes opened.

A deer.
A brown deer with large bony antlers staring straight at me.
I froze, remembering at the last minute that this animal was a skittish woodland critter to begin with.

But what the hell was a deer doing here of all places, a park in the middle of the city?

I stood there, staring straight back at the deer's beady black eyes, as the rain around me grew in intensity.

The deer's equally beady nose twitched and it let out a small sound akin to a squeak.

"Shoo. Get." I say out loud and gesture it away with my hands. "What're you doing here anyway?" 

The deer didn't move an inch, perhaps it didn't hear me over the rain, or perhaps it didn't care.

"Hm. Rain too much for you too huh?" I say to the creature.

I reach into my other jeans pocket and pull out the granola bar I was eating earlier, a good half still remained.
I pull out of the wrapper and toss it towards the deer, landing noiselessly on the wet grass before it.

"Yours while we wait for the rain to die down." I tell it.

The deer dipped its head, smelled it, raised its head to my level and continued to stare at me instead, ignoring the treat I tossed it.

Its eyes were unblinking and I began to feel uneasy despite knowing its an animal not known for being aggressive.

"Picky. Look, just fuck off." I shoo at it again with my hands & raising my voice. "I'm not in the mood to frolic."

The animal took a few steps forward, its hooves stepping onto & over the snack I threw it, its eyes still locked onto mine.

Its mouth opened and I expected another squeak or yelp, instead I heard something else...

"May I stand unshaken?" 

It spoke.
Words escaped its mouth.

"What the f-"

"May I stand unshaken?" It said again in a voice that sounded like a man & woman speaking at the same time.

It stopped walking towards me. Freezing in place once more but still staring.

I must've misheard it. Heard some ambient conversation carried over by the wind around me.
I looked around.
No one else in sight.

What is going on...?

"May I stand unshaken?" It spoke once more, feeling a chill shoot down my spine.

"Back off." I tell it, feeling a degree of idiocy as I realized I was speaking to a deer, "Back off, whatever the hell you are."

The deer turned its head to the side as if it was studying my words.

"Will you stand unshaken?" It said this time. "May I stand unshaken?"

Unnerved, I felt a pit drop inside my chest, its eyes locked onto mine and its words felt like pins inside my ears, poking into it & making them ring.

"Shut up! What're you on about?" I yell at it, my voice barely piercing the roar of the rain around us.

The deer made a noise that sounded like a human like groan and suddenly lurched forward.

I stepped back in surprise & felt myself slip on something smooth, suddenly finding myself on my back and facing upwards towards the tree canopy.

I felt the rain fall onto my face as a dull pressure pressed down onto my chest, I looked forwards the deer & found myself  looking at its front left hoof pressing onto me.

The deer was seemingly pinning me down, I could feel its warm breath radiate towards my face.

"Shall you stand? Shall I stand?" It spoke again. "Will you stand unshaken?"

Out of instinct, I pull its foot off my chest and gave it a kick onto its underbelly.
The deer yelped and fell back a bit, letting me stand back up.

The animal groaned again, lurching its head and body forward, nearly hitting me with its bony antlers.

Panicking, I turn the ground, seeing the semi-flattened part of the grass and close to it, the rock I had indeed slipped on.

I picked it up and threw it at the animal.
The rock landed squarely on its left eye, landing with a dull thud and immediately drawing blood that looked black in the ambient lighting.

It yelped again; a combination of human & animal shrieks

I turn and run.

I ran as fast as I could, running into the rain, haphazardly across the brick laden park path & towards the park exit.

There was no one else in sight.
I could feel my heart beat loudly.
I could feel my legs burn amidst the coolness of the rain.
I could hear the sound of the deer shrieking behind me.

I ran past a pair of gates and onto the connecting road that led onto the street outside the park.

The sound of the city beyond made itself known, traffic & the sound of cars driving against wet asphalt.

A sense of relief washed over me but as I turned to the gates of the park, wiping a combination of sweat & rain off my face as I did, I froze once more.

It was the deer again, like a statue just behind the open gate.
Its sole good eye staring at me, its left eye seemed to cry blood.

It stood there. Unshaken.

I blinked.
It was gone.

I found myself breathing heavily and slightly chuckling to myself.

Was I imagining it all? 
I walked towards the park gate and saw no sign of the animal, looking towards the ground, my soil-caked shoe prints visible on the brick path.

A shiver shot through my body.
And beside my prints, just by the edge of the gate, four forked hoof marks and small palm sized puddle of blood gently being washed away by the rain.

And in the distance, alongside the sound of the rain around me, I heard it shriek.

I heard it say my name.
