Landry Danes was just an ordinary kid. I didn’t know him personally, but we lived in the same town, went to the same school, and knew some of the same people. He was just another face in the crowd. That’s why It’s so difficult to fathom how he came to be who we around here know as Wireface.

I know the truth behind what happened to Landry Danes. Some parts were told to me, other details I connected the dots on my own. I’m not part of the reason why Wireface became what he is, but as the title of this piece insinuates—I got caught in his path—and because of that, forever have a target on my back.

Let me start from the beginning….

It was the spring of 1992.

My roommates and I were going on a weekend campout in the woods outside our town. Our roommate Brock (who was in the military) had to stay at the base later than expected, and said he would meet us there later tonight—which was unwelcomed news for me and my other roommate Cole. We had a big fight earlier that week, where some long held truths came out, and truly hateful things were said that you couldn’t just take back. We hadn’t spoken since, and weren’t even making eye contact, but reluctantly biting the bullet and wound up carpooling.

While giving my bags a final check, I heard Cole reenter the house and head to his room. I took the opportunity to step outside and load my bags in the car. I got in the driver’s seat and smoked a cigarette while waiting for Cole. He always moved at his own pace, and had no regard whatsoever for punctuality—I’m sure you know the type. His blatant disregard for timeliness was what I hated most about him, and actually caused our blowout. This situation was a classic example. I wanted to be on the road by 8, and here we were—8:05, still idling in the driveway.

A few more minutes passed before I saw Cole’s red hoodie appear in my sideview mirror. I heard him put his bags in the trunk, after which he got into the passenger’s seat. Cole had his hood pulled up, arms tightly folded, and was turned towards the window, making a concerted effort to avoid so much as glancing in my direction. How petty, I thought, trying to keep my eyes fixed on the road, and acting like I didn’t notice Cole’s childish passive aggressiveness. I still had a lot to get off my chest, and was dying to unleash on him, but didn’t want to start this weekend on a bitter note. He was already living rent free in my head, I thought. Don’t give him the satisfaction.

Remarkably, we reached the campsite without even looking at each other or speaking. The campsite was situated right off a fire road along a small embankment that led to the river. We were about two miles into the forest, so it was a pretty secluded spot—perfect in case we got a little too rowdy. We were meeting four of our other friends—Mason, Clark, Marvin, and Stephanie—who I was especially looking forward to seeing. We were getting close four years ago, before she left for grad school. She wound up living out there full time, and apparently planned on staying permanently. I only found out the other day she moved back into town, and would be at the campout this weekend. Although we hadn’t spoken in a long time, I wanted to see if this reunion could rekindle some of the old magic we had years earlier.

I could see the fire’s glow, and everyone sitting around it as they reacted to my headlights illuminating the campsite. I pulled up along the campsite’s edge, and gave everyone a wave as they started heading towards my car. Soon as I brought my car to a halt, Cole abruptly threw the door open, stepped out, and didn’t even bother to shut it as he angrily stomped towards the river. I tried to show it didn’t bother me, and was all smiles getting out of my car.

“I guess you two are still getting a divorce?” Mason asked jokingly as he walked up and gave me a quick high-five hug.

I shrugged.

“He’ll get over it.” I replied before quickly changing the subject.

I mentioned how Brock would be coming later tonight. There was only room for two cars, so he would have to park in a nearby lot and hike to the campsite. After greeting Clark and Marvin, the four of us chatted for a few minutes, before Marvin went to catch up with Cole. I immediately noticed when Steph walked up to us, and we instantly locked eyes. She was a little thinner, and looked kind of worn or burnt-out, but that didn’t make her any less beautiful. She still had that glowing aura, those same mysterious light green eyes, dark wavy hair, smooth silky skin, and mesmerizing smile. We both gasped a breathy “hi” to each other, before awkwardly embracing.

“You’re….back in town…?” I shakily uttered, clearly exhibiting my nervousness.

Steph smiled and nodded.

“Yeah, life’s crazy sometimes,” She replied. “One minute, you’ve got everything going your you….next—you’re wondering how much lower than rock bottom you can go.”

My eyes were drawn to Steph’s bare arms, which had their fair share of cuts, scrapes, bruises….and what looked like puncture marks. I made no effort to hide my staring at her arms, and frowned. My reaction though, was out of concern and not disgust or repulsion, which I think Steph sensed.

“Everyone’s got their demons,” I said, smiling while lightly grabbing the tips of her hands. “And how we fight those battles is what I think defines us.”

Steph smirked.

“You were always so philosophical,” She replied giggling. “I never forgot that about you.”

“Sounds like we’ve got a lot to catch up on,” I said, to which she nodded in agreement.

Steph told me why she left Boston. Apparently, she fell into the wrong crowd, and developed some….addictive habits. The lab she worked at happened to produce her substance of choice, which she started stealing from, and eventually got caught. The university didn’t press charges, but kicked her out of the program. Steph said she’s back home now mapping out her next steps—get clean, finish her education, and pursue her aspiring career….or be fated for a simpler unescapable life in our hometown.

“That wasn’t there last time we saw each other.” I said, pointing above her left ankle, where just above it, was a small dark blue butterfly tattoo.

“You were always so observant too.” She remarked coyly.

“When did you get that?” I asked while shutting the car door that Cole left open.

“What’s so fascinating about it?” Steph quickly replied playfully.

I kept looking to and from Steph’s vibrant face, and the butterfly tattoo. I found it rather….provocative, like it signified a mysterious side of Stephanie she either developed while away, or always had that I was just noticing. It was definitely a side of her I wanted to explore more deeply, so this weekend was the perfect opportunity.

“So, you’re not gonna tell me?” I asked half jokingly, while opening the trunk of my car.

Then Steph screamed.

The sheer terror in her voice physically shook me, as Steph scrambled away from my car, and frantically pointed at the trunk while falling into hysterics. When I looked in the trunk, my body completely froze.

It felt like time stood still while I processed the grizzly scene. Cole’s nude body was curled up on top of our bags. His eyes were wide open, and permanently frozen in an expression of utter shock. Cole’s neck was completely mangled, and blood was smeared across his limp body, seeming to be coming from his neck.

In those first few seconds of seeing Cole’s body, I was hit with a deeply unnerving revelation that made my stomach queasy and sent sharp chills down my spine.

If this was Cole crammed in the trunk, I thought….

Then who was in the car with me driving up?
