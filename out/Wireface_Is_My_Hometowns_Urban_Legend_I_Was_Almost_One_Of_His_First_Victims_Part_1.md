It was the spring of 1992.

My roommates and I were going on a weekend campout in the woods outside our town. Our roommate Brock (who was in the military) had to stay at the base later than expected, and said he would meet us there later tonight—which was unwelcomed news for me and my other roommate Cole. We had a big fight earlier that week, where some long held truths came out, and truly hateful things were said that you couldn’t just take back. We hadn’t spoken since, and weren’t even making eye contact, but reluctantly biting the bullet and wound up carpooling.

While giving my bags a final check, I heard Cole reenter the house and head to his room. I took the opportunity to step outside and load my bags in the car. I got in the driver’s seat and smoked a cigarette while waiting for Cole. He always moved at his own pace, and had no regard whatsoever for punctuality—I’m sure you know the type. His blatant disregard for timeliness was what I hated most about him, and actually caused our blowout. This situation was a classic example. I wanted to be on the road by 8, and here we were—8:05, still idling in the driveway.

A few more minutes passed before I saw Cole’s red hoodie appear in my sideview mirror. I heard him put his bags in the trunk, after which he got into the passenger’s seat. Cole had his hood pulled up, arms tightly folded, and was turned towards the window, making a concerted effort to avoid so much as glancing in my direction. How petty, I thought, trying to keep my eyes fixed on the road, and acting like I didn’t notice Cole’s childish passive aggressiveness. I still had a lot to get off my chest, and was dying to unleash on him, but didn’t want to start this weekend on a bitter note. He was already living rent free in my head, I thought. Don’t give him the satisfaction.

Remarkably, we reached the campsite without even looking at each other or speaking. The campsite was situated right off a fire road along a small embankment that led to the river. We were about two miles into the forest, so it was a pretty secluded spot—perfect in case we got a little too rowdy. We were meeting four of our other friends—Mason, Clark, Marvin, and Stephanie—who I was especially looking forward to seeing. We were getting close four years ago, before she left for grad school. She wound up living out there full time, and apparently planned on staying permanently. I only found out the other day she moved back into town, and would be at the campout this weekend. Although we hadn’t spoken in a long time, I wanted to see if this reunion could rekindle some of the old magic we had years earlier.

I could see the fire’s glow, and everyone sitting around it as they reacted to my headlights illuminating the campsite. I pulled up and gave everyone a wave as they started heading towards my car. Soon as I brought my car to a halt, Cole threw the door open, stepped out, and didn’t even bother to shut it as he angrily stomped towards the river. I tried to show it didn’t bother me, and was all smiles getting out of my car.

“I guess you two are still getting a divorce?” Mason asked jokingly as he walked up and gave me a quick high-five hug.

I shrugged.

“He’ll get over it.” I replied before quickly changing the subject.

I mentioned how Brock would be coming later tonight. There was only room for two cars, so he would have to park in a nearby lot and hike to the campsite. After greeting Clark and Marvin, the four of us chatted for a few minutes, before Marvin went to catch up with Cole. I immediately noticed when Steph walked up to us, and we instantly locked eyes. She was a little thinner, and looked kind of worn or burnt-out, but that didn’t make her any less beautiful. She still had that glowing aura, those same mysterious light green eyes, dark wavy hair, smooth silky skin, and mesmerizing smile. We both gasped a breathy “hi” to each other, before awkwardly embracing.

“You’re….back in town…?” I shakily uttered, clearly exhibiting my nervousness.

Steph smiled and nodded.

“Yeah, life’s crazy sometimes,” She replied. “One minute, you’ve got everything going your you….next—you’re wondering how much lower than rock bottom you can go.”

My eyes were drawn to Steph’s bare arms, which had their fair share of cuts, scrapes, bruises….and what looked like puncture marks. I made no effort to hide my staring at her arms, and frowned. My reaction though, was out of concern and not disgust or repulsion, which I think Steph sensed.

“Everyone’s got their demons,” I said, smiling while lightly grabbing the tips of her hands. “And how we fight those battles is what I think defines us.”

Steph smirked.

“You were always so philosophical,” She replied giggling. “I never forgot that about you.”

“Sounds like we’ve got a lot to catch up on,” I said, to which she nodded in agreement.

Steph told me why she left Boston. Apparently, she developed some….addicting habits. The lab she worked at manufactured her substance of choice, which she started stealing, and eventually got caught. The university didn’t press charges, but kicked her out of the program. Steph said she’s back home now evaluating her options—finish her education, or accept a simpler unescapable life in our hometown.

“That wasn’t there last time we saw each other.” I said, pointing above her left ankle, where just above it, was a small dark blue butterfly tattoo.

“You were always so observant too.” She remarked coyly.

“When did you get that?” I asked while shutting the car door that Cole left open.

“What’s so fascinating about it?” Steph quickly replied playfully.

I kept looking to and from Steph’s vibrant face, and the butterfly tattoo. I found it rather….provocative, like it signified a mysterious side of Stephanie she either developed while away, or always had that I was just noticing. It was definitely a side of her I wanted to explore more deeply, so this weekend was the perfect opportunity.

“So, you’re not gonna tell me?” I asked half jokingly, while opening the trunk of my car.

Then Steph screamed.

The sheer terror in her voice physically shook me, as Steph scrambled away from my car, and frantically pointed at the trunk while falling into hysterics. When I looked in the trunk, my body completely froze. It felt like time stood still while I processed the grizzly scene. Cole’s nude body was curled up on top of our bags. His eyes were wide open, and permanently frozen in an expression of utter shock. Cole’s neck was completely mangled, from which blood was seeping, and smeared across his limp body.

In those first few seconds of seeing Cole’s body, I was hit with a deeply unnerving revelation that made my stomach queasy and sent sharp chills down my spine.

If this was Cole crammed in the trunk, I thought, then who was in the car with me driving up?

When I looked up from the trunk, I saw everyone had gathered around my car. Steph was still hysterical, while Mason and Clark nervously exchanged murmured whispers. The commotion even got Marvin’s attention, who came back up from the river.

“What the fuck is this, Cooper?” Marvin asked loudly upon seeing Cole’s body. “Cole’s-dead! What did you do to him?!”

Marvin violently shook his hands while speaking, which made me notice something he was holding—black sweatpants and a red hoodie. The same clothes whoever rode up here with me was wearing. I said nothing at first, especially after sensing the suspicion in Marvin’s voice. He looked completely frazzled, and was in a very standoffish pose, like he was trying to keep his distance. Everyone else looked similar. I turned to Stephanie, who was backed up against a tree, and sobbing uncontrollably. When our eyes met, the unfettered terror in her face led me to make an unsettling realization.

It was me. They’re all afraid of me. They think I did this to Cole.

“Wait….” I said, slowly putting my hands up, which put everyone more on edge. “You think I actually did this to Cole?”

“Why shouldn’t we?” Mason snapped back, who visibly displayed his sheathed knife.

Given the circumstances, I knew the burden of proof was on me, and I had nothing to say that could absolve me on the spot. I lowered my hands and kept them at my sides after Mason withdrew his knife. Mason was also in the military, and although he no longer served, I didn’t doubt his capabilities with a blade.

“So, what are we gonna do?” Marvin asked while slowly helping Steph back to her feet. “Because there’s someone else out there right now, so we have to do something quick.”

“Let’s do this….” Mason said after a few seconds of silence as he turned to Clark. “Why don’t you take Steph into town and get help? Marv and I will stay here with Cooper.”

“You know I didn’t do this to Cole!” I blurted.

Mason looked at me sharply as everyone else headed towards Clark’s truck.

“DON’T tell me what I know and don’t know right now!” Mason snapped back while pointing towards the tree line. “What were you and….whoever the fuck that was, gonna do? Bury him out here? Throw him in the river? Were we supposed to be next?”

“This is ridiculous!” I barked back, showing my frustration. “I don’t know who that was. We….I was already in the car before Cole-that other person even got in. I didn’t even see him leave the house! We didn’t say a word to each other the whole drive!”

I got my first good look at Cole’s body as Mason responded to my remarks. I noticed barbed wiring was tightly wrapped around his neck and dug deep into his flesh. The prospect of dying in such a horrific way sent sharp chills down my spine, and made me wonder how close I may have been to suffering the same gruesome fate.

“Answer me!” Mason barked loudly, snapping me out of my trance. “Did you guys plan this—is this some sort of twisted game you sick fucks are playing?”

Mason was relentless. Whether he was acting on instinct or out of fear, he had no doubt I killed Cole. I was guilty until proven innocent, and knew I needed something more than my word to get vindicated.

“Wait….” I heard Steph say as she walked up to us, still sniffling and visibly shaken. “Cooper….could be telling the truth.”

Everyone stared bewildered at Steph.

“If….whoever killed Cole just threw his body in the trunk….and had those clothes on before getting in the car with Cooper….if they weren’t even talking, he could have pulled this off without Cooper noticing anything.”

I nodded emphatically.

“We weren’t even looking at each other,” I quickly added. “

Nobody said anything for about a minute.

“Fuck it,,” Mason finally said. “Let’s all just get out of here; take Cooper with us….there’s four of us and one of him. We got numbers on our side.”

Mason walked up, grabbed me by the collar, and pushed me back against my car.

“If you look like you’re even thinking about trying something….” Mason said fiercely as he pressed the tip of his knife against my neck. “I’ll take you the fuck out….I don’t know what this is, but I’m scared, and not trying to die. Maybe you didn’t do anything, but right now - the facts don’t look good for you.”

Mason made me walk in front of him and Steph, keeping my hands visible as we rejoined the others. Clark’s truck was on, and he sat waiting for us in the driver’s seat. Upon reaching the truck, Mason shoved me against it, and thoroughly patted my pockets. After making sure I wasn’t carrying anything dangerous, he grabbed me by my jacket, and walked us around towards the driver’s side.

“Change of plans….” Mason said as he walked us up to Clark’s rolled-down window. “We’re all just gonna get out of here. We need to take Cooper-but we’re watching him, so you don’t have to worry….are you cool with that?”

But Clark didn’t respond.

His head was pulled back and held in place on the headrest by strands of barbed wire that were tightly wrapped around his bloodied head and neck. Like Cole, the barbs dug deep into Clark’s skin, almost cutting completely through his neck in some spots. Clark’s hands were completely mangled, clearly from struggling to try and get free. Steph started screaming again, but not from the sight of Clark’s mangled body. She was reacting to something in the woods. As Steph started backtracking and frantically gesturing towards the tree line, I heard heavy rhythmic footsteps coming from the direction she pointed, and could just make out a vague figure moving in the shadows.

Steph bolted from the truck, and blindly ran off into the forest. I looked back at Mason, who was just as terrified. I nudged Mason to snap him out of his shock, who looked at me with a frenzied expression.

“I don’t know what this is….” Mason gasped as he kept looking between me and the approaching figure. “But I’m not fucking dying here!”

I then felt a sharp pain just above my hip, and fell to my knees as Mason quickly fled in the same direction as Steph. When I saw Mason had his blade out, I looked down at my hands that were pressed against where the pain came from, and saw they were coated in blood.

I had been stabbed, I realized. Mason stabbed me.
