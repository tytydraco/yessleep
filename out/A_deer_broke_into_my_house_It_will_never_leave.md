Some nights, I like to lie in bed awake, paralyzed with the fear that my wife will leave me. This particular night was one of those times. I was covered in cold sweat, and lay on the mattress clutching the sheets while my beautiful wife, Angela, breathed slowly, rhythmically, next to me. It was insufferable. In the beginning, it was a kaleidoscope of passion that lasted until just after the wedding. Now, every small action she took felt like it was to spite me. Every movement of her deep blue eyes was done to look at another man. I still loved her, dearly, but I no longer felt that it was reciprocated. Now, it felt more like the love you have for a favourite TV show, or a stuffed animal. 

I calmed myself, and tried to get back to sleep. It was near enough a full moon, and the bright beams that came through the bedroom window made me feel like I was sleeping with a nightlight again. The curtains fluttered gently, and I realised that I'd left the windows open. I lazily swung my legs out of bed and stood up. I was almost at the window when I realised something. I wanted it open. For as long as I could remember, I've suffered from chronic sinus pain. Sleeping with a little fresh air helped alleviate the problems caused by a stuffy room. Angela, however, hated the chill that came with it. And so, the windows stayed shut. 

But Angela was asleep, and to hell with the reprimanding I'd get from her in the morning. Triumphantly, I turned back around and got into bed again. I wrapped myself in more of the sheet than I usually get and rolled over to get a good night's sleep. Less than five minutes later I was back up again, closing the bedroom window. There really was no need for me to cast aside my wife's preferences. I'm sure she'd do the same for me. Back to bed and I'm just lying there, staring at a crack in the ceiling. It's deep, noticeable and twisted into the same shape as my grandmother's varicose veins. I try to think of how I could fix such a thing. I settled on filling it in with plaster. I rolled over and took my phone from my bedside. I opened Notes and left a message for myself to go to the hardware store. I tried never to look at my phone after I went to bed, certainly after Angela came to bed, but in this case I like to think that I have enough self control. 

Half an hour later I put my phone away, having spent the time silently crawling through my Tik Tok feed, which had been flooded with Malaysian cooking videos. I tried to lay and still as I could, and clasped my eyes shut. My endeavour to sleep was cut short by a commotion from down stairs. Alert, I sat bolt upright. Could it be an intruder? A burglar? I rested a hand on Angela’s shoulders and tried to shake her awake. She let out a low, guttural grunt and rolled over. I wasn't even sure if I had heard something, and didn't want to disturb her over a false alarm. So, I stood up, crept to the baseball bat I had propped up against my dresser and slowly opened the bedroom door. 

Standing at the top of the hall, I could hear some movement downstairs. Wearily, I moved past the landing to the stairs, and began to descend them. All I could think of at that moment was how the real estate agent who told us about the area's near zero crime rate was lying. I grasped the wooden handle of the bat so hard my knuckles went white. I held it out in front of me as I reached the first floor. The commotion was coming from the kitchen, which I now neared. I held my breath and leapt around the corner. Holding the bat above my head, primed to swing, I confronted the person who broke into our home. 

Standing in the center of my kitchen was a deer. It wasn't startled by my dramatic entry and I lowered the bat. For a second, we both stood there, staring at each other. The thing's antlers came up to my shoulders. It had a brown, shaggy coat and inquisitive eyes. I've never been hunting, and this was the first time I saw an animal like this up close. Usually, they'd be rotting on the side of a road. But this creature was breathing heavily, letting out gasps of steam and warm saliva as it did. 

I noticed that the glass sliding doors were wide open, and I cursed myself for, presumably  forgetting to close them before I went to bed. Angela and I had been sitting on the deck drinking for most of the evening after all. I tried to shoo the beast back through the entrance and when that didn't work, tried to gently take ahold of its antlers and guide it out. As soon as I touched them, it bucked its head wildly and took a step forward. I recoiled in shock, then quietly laughed at myself for being so intimidated by Bambi. I shouted at it, but it didn't move an inch. I thought deer were supposed to be skittish around humans?

When my problem didn't immediately fix itself, I obviously turned to the Internet. I sat back on an ugly chair my wife inherited that we keep out in the hall for some reason and took out my phone as the deer trotted laps of my kitchen island. I searched online for “what to do if a deer gets trapped in your house”. No clear results came up, and no deleted reddit user from twelve years ago made a post about having the same extremely niche problem, as is usually the case. Both my wife and I have lived in the city all our lives until recently. Maybe this was just what we had to contend with, now we live out in the exurbs. 

With no idea what to do next, I decided to go wake up my wife. I cursed our house's open plan, as there was no door between the kitchen and the connecting hallway that I could close. I just hoped the deer would stay where it was. Just before I ascended the stairs, I saw it was beginning to make its way further into the house. I let out a long sigh, that didn't end until I reached my bedroom. Like a trooper, Angela was still asleep, snoring softly. I walked to her side and crouched down. I put a hand on her shoulder and gently shook her awake. She bolted upright when she finally did, her fight or flight kicking in. 

“Angie, Angie it's just me. It's just me.” I said, trying to help her grasp what was going on. 

She sat upright and wiped her tired eyes with her palm. 

“Why did you wake me up?” She barked, frustrated. 

“We have a guest,” I joked, “downstairs. A deer broke in somehow. I think I left the patio doors open. 

“A deer?” She whispered, still half asleep. 

“Yeah. I tried to get it out but it wouldn't play ball.” I replied. 

“And why did you wake me up?” asked Angela, “You know I have to get up at six.” 

“I know, I know, it's just that I need help” I said, suddenly feeling embarrassed. 

Angela got out of bed, muttering about how I couldn't do anything on my own. She threw on a cardigan and followed me downstairs. I was giving her a more in depth rundown of what had happened when we reached the ground floor and saw something that stopped us in our tracks. Laying on the hardwood floor was the deer. Dead, from the looks of it. I took a step closer and saw that its eyes were glassy, and its tongue hung lame from its jaws. My wife clasped her hands around her mouth and expressed her disgust with a groan. 

I crouched by the dead deer and noticed something strange about its body. It seemed deflated. Hollow. I reached out and touched its stomach, against my wife's protest, and to my surprise the deer's side began to sink inwards until it was concave. It felt boneless. I took a frightened step back and it was at that point that I noticed the long, perfectly straight cut that ran the length of the beast's belly. Blood and organs should've been spewing out, but there was no such thing. It was sterile. 

I stood up and turned to my wife. Before I could say anything, I saw that she was pointing. I looked, following her index finger and my gaze found the basement door. It was now wide open. The only things we have in the basement are boxes for storage, and we hardly ever go down there. Guided by Angela, I approached the open door. I took one step into the darkness and felt around for the light switch. I flipped it on, but nothing happened. I flipped it again and again, but still nothing. Before I could ask, my wife went and got a flashlight from the kitchen. She came back, handed it to me and urged me further into the basement. 

I descended the rotting, wooden steps. The walls were bare, made from raw concrete with exposed pipes running along them. I reached the bottom floor and found the piles of boxes we'd left down here when we moved in. Bits of old furniture and unloved family heirlooms were scattered among them. I gave it a once over, but nothing seemed to be down here. Definitely not any member of the deer's extended family. I turned around and walked to the foot of the staircase. That's when I heard it. It was a low creaking noise that froze me where I stood. I slowly turned back around and shone my flashlight at the source. The door to the old, mahogany closet that had been left to gather dust by the house's previous owners had opened, just a crack. I made my way towards it, my light illuminating the wooden behemoth. I stood just in front of it and grabbed the nob. With a shaking hand, I swung the doors wide open. 


I walked out of the basement and saw my wife leaning against a wall, looking at her phone and rubbing her eyes. She looked up and smiled weakly when I emerged. 

“Find anything?” She asked. 

I wordlessly handed the flashlight to her. 

“I think you should go down there and see for yourself.” I told her, without any emotion. 

She sighed, but took it and traced my path back down the old steps. As soon as she was in, I silently closed the basement door. I took the key that rested on the doorframe and locked it behind her. I rested against the now locked door and slid down it to the ground. I sat and whispered reassurances to myself, that I was doing the right thing. I heard a clatter, then Angela started screaming. I covered my ears as she did, the noise was too much for me to bear. Then, the screeching that sounded like it was ripping through her throat stopped. I stayed where I was for another hour. 

Eventually, I stood and made my way to the bedroom. I lay in bed awake, paralysed with fear. I closed my eyes when I heard footsteps on the staircase. I tried not to react when my wife climbed into bed beside me. When I did fall asleep, close to sunrise, I dreamt of what I saw in the closet. It looked like a skinned body, with its emaciated arms and legs stretched to the proportions of a sloppy children’s drawing. It's head vaguely resembled deer, with the fur pulled back to reveal tight sinew covering bone. The thing's eyes were bulging and milk white. With its size, I had no idea how it could fit into that small deer’s skin, or my wife's. 

That was a few weeks ago now. Since that night, I feel like my life has improved dramatically. Angela hasn't  argued with or belittled me in weeks. In fact, I haven't heard her speak in over a month. Sometimes she leaves for hours, even days at a time. I rest easy though, now knowing for certain that she isn't seeing someone behind my back. At night, we lay motionless in bed together. I like to trace the seam running down her abdomen with my fingers when we do.
