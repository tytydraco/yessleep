If you haven’t read my previous post it explains what I’ve been going through and how I thought it ended.

It’s been a week since my last post and a lot has happened and I still can’t tell if it’s all in my head so I would really like some advice. Can all of this be explained by a mixture of a murder plot and my severe form of sleep paralysis or am I being hunted by a monster?

The first night after the incident I tried to sleep in the house it all happened. It took me hours to finally sleep and when I did I had horrendous nightmares. Seeing Pauline in such a contorted state, her guts spewing up through the drainage hole, her arm skin peeled as it nearly got sucked into the pipe, exposing the muscle and tendons twisting and snapped. I couldn’t shake the image. I dreamt of myself slowly being sucked into the drain as I showered, I could imagine the pain of my legs breaking to fit down such a narrow gap. Every time I would have a nightmare I would wake up just as I died and whenever I would wake up I would be stuck, unmoving, trapped in my paralysed body.

All the usual symptoms were there, the visions, blurry blobs and the voices speaking to me about chaotic nonsense.

“The speakers tried to talk but you couldn’t convince them.”

It was awful, the entire time I waited for the beast to return, for it to murmur my name into my unreactive skull. I would pray it wouldn’t wait until I finally broke free and snatch me and haul me down the drain. It was hell. 

In the morning I was awoken to a banging on my front door. A slamming of tremendous force that sent my heart crashing through my chest. I immediately thought it was that hellish creature again, rummaging through my house in search of prey but of course it wasn’t. It wasn’t real I thought to myself, it couldn’t be. The police had given me a reasonable excuse, an insane story that explained an insane crime. The bashing at the door continued so I wreathed myself from bed and ran to the front.

Peeling open the door I saw an officer, one of the many that questioned me the day prior, his partner stood behind him, rudely leaning against the hood of my car, staining the blue paint with his mangy fingerprints.

“Morning son,” he said, his face filled with upset, “what in the hell are you still doing here?”

I looked past him at Pauline’s house, the place was crawling with officers, some in hazmat suits, detectives and even a few men in black suits and sunglasses, the entire force was out for this case. “Sorry, I thought I was allowed to stay here?” I replied, still half asleep.

“Course you can, but after what you saw? Especially with this criminal stuff going on, you’re not safe. Head back home to your parents.” The officer replied, his partner nodding in the back solemnly.

I gave him a weak smile and it broke immediately, “I will, I will.” I glanced back at the house and then down the street. I hadn’t noticed until now. The other houses clearly weren’t occupied. No cars in driveways, no nosey neighbours, all the curtains shut. Pauline really did just rent these houses to murder the tenants. But why? I asked myself and then I came to a conclusion a lot of commenters on my last post did. Sacrifice to that thing. That monster that came into my room, Pauline had been appeasing it and she failed when I had managed to narrowly escape its grasp by being unable to stir awake. I looked back to the cop, his face still a concerned frown.

“Sir, no one believed me yesterday but I think you’re following the wrong lead.” I spouted frantically, his partner perking up and walking over to me as I spoke. He nodded for me to continue. 

“The night Pauline died, the day before I found her. I was attacked in my room. A monster attacked me, it held me and it tried to eat me the same way it ate…”



The officer raised his hand right in my face, I could smell the sweat on his palm, “Let’s contextualise this, please. Maybe someone did attack you that night, maybe some drugged up looney broke into your room or one of the killers but not a monster.”

I flung my head back in disbelief, why the hell would I make something like this up?

He raised his palm again, “Calm down Bailey, listen. Describe the ‘monster’ to me and Henry will draw a sketch in his notebook, he used to be a sketch artist for assault victims.” Henry nodded and pulled out his little book from his front pocket, “Henry will draw a humanised version of what you saw and we’ll see if we can add it to the investigation.”

I was annoyed but I understood. My story was insane, even I thought so. The officer maybe had a good idea. I hallucinate when I get sleep paralysis, maybe when a real person is within my vision my brain distorts their features, it had never happened before and it was a decent explanation.

I described the monster, chainsaw teeth and all and Henry drew an admittedly hilarious depiction of a human with a confusingly long nose and bucked teeth. I nearly laughed but the serious looks of both officers yanked me back to reality. After the encounter I felt more at peace, there’s no such thing as monsters, just horrible people.



Over the course of the day I packed my most important things and called my parents. They obviously let me back home but told me my room had already been converted into storage space so I would be sleeping on the couch. It wasn’t too bad and I was away from Pauline’s corpse and her house. The next few days were fine, the sleep paralysis went back to being a nuisance rather than a waking nightmare and I was slowly getting the visual of a bloomed gored body out of my head. Then I had a fight with my mum.

I should have stayed, the fight wasn’t even that bad, just about how messy I can be. She lost her shit and so did I and in an act of pure stupidity I drove back to that house in the dead of night. I regret my decision so much, I could have called a friend or just put up with it for a few more hours but instead I freaked out and drove back. 

It was around ten when I went back. Rage fuelled me to autopilot all the way back to the house. I was so infuriated with her tiny jabs that I had forgotten the horrors I experienced until I pulled into my driveway. Pauline’s house had been roped off and the door was covered in yellow hazard tape. No more cops were there but all the lights remained on, I’m guessing as a deterrent for would-be thieves stealing from a dead woman. I didn’t even turn off the car, I remembered the vile things that happened and I went to put it in reverse and then my phone pinged. My mum.

“You couldn’t have cleaned your filth before you left? >:(“ The text read. 

I was so mad, she couldn’t have just said something kind, something about how dumb it was to move back in only four days after I had a near death experience. I cranked the handbrake up, grabbed my bag and went inside. The house smelt putrid.



There was a mixture of smells, the usual awfulness of the pipes mixed with some food I moronically had left on the counter rotting. It looked like strips of bacon that I assumed I was defrosting the night before I abandoned ship. I brought my stuff to my room, only flicking on my room light, using my phone’s flash to navigate the rest of the way. The smell was revolting, I felt so stupid. How did I forget about an entire slab of bacon? I didn’t even have bacon most mornings, hell I rarely have breakfast. 

“Bay-lee?” The voice echoed through the house and punched me like a shotgun. I felt cold, my stomach heaved and tears immediately welled in my eyes. The gap in the speech, the deepness. It was in my house with me. It was here. I was looking for me. I rotated where I stood unpacking some clothes and looked towards the door to the pitch black hallway. I couldn’t see it, not yet. 

“Ha-ve you co-me ba-ck?” I then heard the wet slapping on the tile floor of my house. It was far away, at the opposite end of my house, maybe in the kitchen? Hopefully in the bathroom, because if it’s in the kitchen I walked right past it when I came in. It was moving slow, each step a second apart, I needed to get help and fast.

I dialled triple zero and slammed the phone to my ear. “You have dialled emergency triple zero,” the phone said. When the woman answered and asked what the emergency was I froze, I couldn’t speak, it would hear me, it would find me.

“Excuse me, is anyone there?”

“There’s something in the house with me.” I whispered, turning the phone volume to zero and sliding it into my pocket. They can track phones right?



The slapping continued, it was getting close but the noise was still distant. I scanned my room, I needed a place to hide. I locked eyes with my reflection in the window, I should just run away I thought. I bolted to the window and slid it open, the noise of the old window was deafening, it took such force to crack and the rusted bearings kept rattling and banging the glass pane as I scraped it open.

“BAY-LEE!” The voice bellowed and the footfalls became quicker, a normal pace now. I looked at the fly screen and tried to yank it off but it didn’t budge, the child safety feature caused it to be physically attached to the frame. The banging and crashing of me squirming to rip the damn thing off was so loud and the footfalls grew fast, it was running through my house. I heard it slam into the table in the dining room, its weight caused it to grind across the wooden floor and I heard it smash into the wall.

“BAY-LEE!” It screamed, it was so close, a hallway away and I was dead. I was fucked, I gave the fly screen one last shoulder charge and barely split the plastic. I needed to hide now, there was no other way. I dove to the floor and scrambled under the bed. As it entered the room my feet had just slipped under the dangling sheet. It may have seen me, I was petrified. I may not have been quick enough. I held back vomiting and my head spun in fear.



I saw its gigantic feet and strangely thin legs enter my room. I heard the grinding and splitting of its gums as it began to rotate its teeth, the drool splashing against the carpet, soaking into it, just in front of my face. Splotches of its own blood mixed in with the frothy spittle in front of my face. The creature began to explore my room, it pushed hard on my cupboard door, splitting the wood as it leaned inside. I could see its back, its spine stuck out and looked close to bursting through its skin. Small holes lined its back, leaking a fatty, puss filled ooze that drained down to its legs. It had thin long wires of hair that draped from the back of its head and down past its shoulders. It turned away from the cupboard and I saw its face, the upturned nose and gigantic protruding horse-like maw and bulbous eyes that rolled around independently to each other. The teeth rotated in its skull and were now drenched in blood. Each tooth looked like a molar until the occasional canine showed up. I crawled deeper backwards, if I could see its eyes, it could see mine. It meandered past the bed and to the window. I heard it lean against the fly screen as it looked outside, the wire snapping under the weight.

“You are he-re.” It said, the echoing sound of its voice remained even while it stood in the same room as me, “Bay-lee? Wh-ere are you?” Its voice sounded monotone but angry, it had a growl to it, it wanted me, it wanted to eat me. I lowered my head and looked toward the hallway. It was a straight shot out. I just had to run when it was back at the cupboard. I then felt it lean on the bed. The entire bed buckled, the weight of this thing, the wood creaked and groaned as it splintered slightly. I heard a splash of liquid and felt it spray my legs. I turned my head to see what it was doing. It was leaning down, and the drool it had contained within its mouth had dumped out onto the floor. It was trying to look under the bed. I slowly watched in horror as one of its eyes came into view.

I hauled myself as quick as I could from under the bed, it screamed an awful animal screech as the teeth whirred so much faster. I got out from the bed and saw it in full view, its head so close to touching the ceiling as it stood tall. I scrambled as quickly as I could backwards as it launched itself over the bed. Its arms extended outwards, gigantic hands grasping out as it barrelled down on me. I squished myself into a ball and it just missed me. Flying past and crashing into the cupboard. I jumped to my feet and ran for the door. My shoulder whacked into the doorframe on the way out sending a wave of pain through my body but I didn’t slow down, I couldn’t slow down. This thing was fast, I could hear it gaining on me.

I circled around the corner and started heading towards the front door, not the quickest way out but I had less of a chance of being cornered if things went south. The wet slapping of the creature’s feet behind me grew closer, the grinding and sloshing of the teeth so loud as if it was just behind my head. I then felt it hit my back, a firm strike from my right shoulder that then scratched down to my mid back. It must have missed me with its full palm and just nicked me with its gnarled finger. How had it got so close? There was no way I would have made it to the front door so I turned into the kitchen, it had two exits and I couldn’t be trapped.



As I turned in the rancid smell of the bacon sent my head spinning and my eyes began to water. I heard the beast miss the turn and crash loudly into another wall and let out a bellowing screech that sounded more echoed, like a lost coal miner screaming for help in a cave. I looked for any potential hiding spots in the kitchen, my eyes vaguely adjusting to the darkness. I finally got a better look at the ‘bacon’ on the counter and nearly vomited. The strips of flesh were pale, white and were fatter than most bacon. A single divet was found in one of the strips and on the other a nipple. It wasn’t bacon, it was strips of human flesh, torn apart in thin peels, left to rot on my counter. How long had the monster been living in my house? Where else had this thing stored food? I didn’t know and didn’t have time to search, in my morbid curiosity I had slowed and I saw the things head round into the kitchen. Its right eye staring at me, its teeth spinning, its face more horse in shape from a side profile. Its massive hand, wide enough to engulf my torso, wrapped its horrid fingers around the corner to the room as it entered, stalking like a raptor in search of prey. Without moving its mouth it spoke, “Bay-lee? Why did you lea-ve?” It had slowed now, to a walking pace, I stopped and stared in horror, I was so scared that my legs locked up and I couldn’t move, I was begging myself to move, praying that I would shift even an inch but just as if I was in sleep paralysis, I was stuck in my own body. “I ha-ve grow-n so hung-gry,” it continued, the teeth slowing to a near halt, it had fully entered the kitchen now. “Fee-d me?” It requested, its voice almost pleading.



I was shocked, this thing just a moment prior had chased me through the house, it swiped at my shoulder and then it stopped to talk, to beg. My mind raced, the quickest way out was the front door, but if it guarded that side of the kitchen it would catch me if I ran. It had stopped completely, its massive size towering over me but I was safe. I decided to stay still, or maybe I was still paralysed with fear. Was this what Pauline went through? Did she get approached and forced to sacrifice the locals to this beast in exchange for her life? Would I cower so low?

“BAY-LEE!” it screamed at me, shocking my senses and restarting my panic. It had rage in its alien eyes, viscous, horrifying rage. It needed an answer or I was dead. I placed my hand on the counter, slowly navigating it across until I found the edge of a knife. One of its eyes watched my hand while the other stared angrily into my eyes, my jaw hung open, not knowing how to respond.

“BAY-LEE!” Once again the voice shook my chest like a shockwave and my stomach sank as it began inching closer, its chainsaw whirring up again. In one quick motion I whipped the knife at it and ran. The blade clanked between its teeth and then fell down its gullet. As I turned to run I heard the thing start to choke, it let out a wretched gag and tremendous scream. I rounded the corner and spotted the front door, red and blue lights illuminated the cracks to the outside world. My saviours had just arrived. I took flight and ran as hard as I could towards the front door and my moment of happiness was cut short as the monster stepped in front of me, having predicted my escape I crashed into it and slipped, my head slamming into the ground, the entire weight of my body on my neck. The pain hit me so violently, the warmth of blood filled my back as my cracked skull spewed crimson across the floor. I started seeing stars and my consciousness faded. I saw the thing loom over me, the knife blade jutting through where a throat would normally be on any other creature, blood leaked across its chest. It reached down and grabbed my leg, it started to drag me away. I could feel the skin on my head opening more as it was pulled across the wooden floor. As my vision faded I knew I was dead, I would never wake up again. I heard the police banging on the door, and calling something that my dizzied mind couldn’t comprehend. I then saw the creature turn and look at me one final time and say something that sent a wave of memories through my mind.



“Are you a-wake, Bay-lee?”

I blacked out.



When I awoke I was on a stretcher being hauled into the back of an ambulance. Cops surrounded my house, at least three cars were out the front. I scanned each window I could see from the front yard, waiting to see a silhouette of the demon but I saw nothing. When the paramedic saw me trying to move my head she calmly placed her hand on me and told me to remain still and that it was all over. Remaining perfectly still was apparently what I was good at so I just laid there, staring at the midnight sky.



That night in the hospital I didn’t sleep, even the drugs they gave me didn’t shake the restlessness the night’s events had caused. How close that thing got to me, the strips of human flesh it was leaving to rot. I got so close to dying, so close to having my body hauled down the pipes by a creature too massive to even remotely think about fitting. I couldn’t sleep because I knew my first bout of sleep paralysis would make me insane, drive me over the edge. I needed medication or night time monitoring, something to stop this, this madness. Although sleep paralysis saved me once before, maybe the pros outweigh the cons.

In the morning the police arrived, they made me answer insane questions and refused to believe that it was a monster that attacked me. I didn’t back down this time, I repeated to them that they were looking for a demon, alien or mutant and not some poorly planned murder syndicate. They didn’t trust a word that came from my mouth.

Their explanation was psychosis. The panic of being back in the house made me hallucinate the attacker as some monster. The emergency operator claimed she heard yelling, someone yelling Bailey over and over but the muffling of my pants pocket made it insanely hard to understand. She claimed there was no echo on her end and that the voice sounded like an aggressive man but not inhuman.

When I asked about the strips of flesh the officers said they found them and assumed it was body parts of the previous victims, in my bathroom there was apparently a stack of degloved body parts, faces, hands and entire limbs. 

I asked about my missing knife and they said I must have landed a good shot on the attacker, sticking it in him or at least in his clothes.

I asked about the pile of blood and drool in my room. They couldn’t tell at first glance if the liquid was drool but the blood was most likely mine from my back wound. I got furious and attempted to explain that I wasn’t slashed across the back until way later and they tossed that aside as confusion from the trauma.



No matter what I threw at them they had a ‘reasonable’ explanation, some crazy way to toss aside that I was attacked by a beast. They just assumed a gigantic over 6ft behemoth of a man was squatting in my house, hiding from the police while they searched Pauline’s residence and I startled him. He didn’t kill me since the cops had arrived and fled out the back door, leaving his evidence behind.

To be honest, I’m starting to believe them. What happened to me can’t be real, it can’t be. I’m coming to reddit this final time to ask more definitively, can sleep paralysis cause psychosis? Can it drive someone mad to the point of hallucination? Am I safe at my parents house? 



I’m not returning to that house to collect my stuff alone and when I do go back I will never stay the night again. If that creature was real, I intend to starve it out.
