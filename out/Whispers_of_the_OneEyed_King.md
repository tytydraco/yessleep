I tossed another log onto the fire, watching the flames throw wild shadows across the walls of our rented cabin. Outside, the winter wind howled through pine trees, making the windows rattle. Perfect weather for ghost stories.

"Your turn, Aiden," Sophia said, pulling her blanket tighter. I settled deeper into my armchair, knowing exactly which story I wanted to tell. The Wild Hunt had been on my mind ever since cousin Jordan's call last week.

"Since we're right in the middle of Yule right now, I've got the perfect story," I said, watching their faces in the firelight. "Ever hear about what happened to Luna Chen?"

"Oh god, the occult blogger?" Olivia leaned forward, her eyes wide. "My sister swears she knows the real story."

"Everyone thinks they know the real story," Noah scoffed from his spot on the couch. "I heard she froze to death."

I shook my head. "No, no. Let me tell you how it really happened." I paused, realizing I needed to set the stage properly. "First though – you all know what Yule is, right?"

When they shook their heads, I continued, falling into the familiar rhythm of storytelling. "Yule is this ancient midwinter festival, twelve days and nights starting with the winter solstice. The old Norse people believed it was when the barrier between worlds was thinnest. They'd feast, light fires to chase away darkness, and make offerings to the gods. But it was also the most dangerous time of year – because that's when Odin leads the Wild Hunt."

"The thing with the ghosts?" Sophia pulled her blanket even tighter.

"More than just ghosts." I lowered my voice, letting the howling wind outside add atmosphere. "During Yule, Odin himself rides across the winter sky, leading an army of the dead. And if you see them..." I let the tension build. "If you see them, you're marked. You either join the Hunt, die on the spot, or go mad. There's no escape once the Hunt marks you as one of their own."

"That's what happened to Luna, right?" Olivia asked.

I smiled grimly. "Well, that's one version..."

I told them how Luna was like so many others who get interested in the old ways – starting with mythology podcasts, then online forums about runes and seidr magic. But for her, it became more than just interest. It became an obsession. She spent hours studying the old texts about the Wild Hunt, about how Odin rides during Yule to collect worthy souls. That's when she first heard about the Children of Yggdrasil.

"They weren't like other online pagan communities," I explained, watching their faces in the firelight. "They claimed they could teach people to spirit walk, to leave their bodies behind and travel to other realms. Their leader, Asher, said that during Yule, skilled practitioners could safely join the Wild Hunt through astral projection."

I told them about the video meetings, how Luna would argue with Asher. "That's not how it works," she'd insisted during one session. "The old stories say you can't just safely observe. If you see the Hunt, you're part of it forever. That's what I want – to truly join them, not just project."

I can still picture Asher's face in the archived video – his silver-streaked beard caught in the blue light of his desk lamp as he smiled. "Patience, young one. The physical body must be prepared, or it will be destroyed by the power of the Hunt. That's why we developed this method. We must start with spirit-walking."

"Hold up," Olivia interrupted my story. "That's not how I heard it. My sister says she was actually an investigative blogger trying to expose them as frauds."

"And I heard the group was running some kind of financial scam, and Luna found out about it," Noah added.

I held up my hand. "Let me finish. It was the night of the Winter Solstice..."

I described how Luna had decided she wouldn't wait any longer. During their Yule ceremony video call, she broke from the group's ritual, performing her own invocation to Odin. Asher tried to stop her, warning her that she wasn't ready, that her body wasn't prepared.

The storm was fierce when she ran into the night, ignoring their frantic DMs to come back. The snow was so thick she could barely see, but through the white curtain, she saw them – riders on ghostly horses, hounds with glowing eyes, and at their head, a figure in a wide-brimmed hat, holding a spear that gleamed like starlight. She stood frozen in the presence of the ancient god. Odin raised his spear and called forth the old magic. Luna's skin became pale, she couldn't move. Blood began to run out of her ears and then her eyes.

"Aiden! Why do you always have to make it gross?" Sophia exclaimed.

I leaned forward, my voice dropping lower. "My cousin Jordan saw her that night. He was driving home on Highway 19. Says the snow cleared for just a moment, and he saw riders in the sky. Says one of them looked just like Luna, but her face..." I shuddered, remembering Jordan's pale face when he told me. "Says her face was both terrified and triumphant."

"That's bullshit," Noah insisted. "The FBI found evidence of cryptocurrency fraud. The whole spirit walking thing was just cover. Luna probably found out too much."

"Then how do you explain what happened to Marcus Rodriguez last Yule?" I challenged. "He was drone filming out by Wagner's Farm. Saw the whole Hunt ride past, clear as day. Said Luna was right there among them, her hair streaming behind her like snow."

"Or that photographer," Olivia added reluctantly. "She was doing a winter storm project out there last year. Got footage of weird lights in the storm. When she enhanced the images..." She shuddered. "Said one of the shapes looked like a woman running through the air."

The wind howled louder outside our cabin. Something thumped on the roof.

"Oh god," Sophia whispered.

We all froze as heavy footsteps crossed above us. Then a scraping sound, like something being dragged.

Noah jumped up. "I'm checking it out."

"Don't you dare open that door," Olivia warned.

The footsteps stopped. Then came a tremendous CRASH against the window—

Everyone screamed.

A massive pile of snow slid off the roof past the window. In the distance, a snow plow's lights flickered through the trees.

"Jesus Christ," Sophia laughed shakily. "I nearly had a heart attack."

"Just the snow," Noah said, sitting back down. "Nothing supernatural about it."

But I couldn't tear my eyes away from the window. "Did... did you see something in the snow? Just for a second?"

"Don't," Olivia warned. "Don't you dare."

"Like riders?" Sophia whispered.

"I said don't!" Olivia stood up. "I'm making hot chocolate. With brandy. Lots of brandy. And then we're telling nice, safe stories about summer."

But we all found ourselves drawn to the window, watching the swirling snow, wondering what really happened to Luna Chen. Some say the cult killed her. Some say she froze to death in the storm. But on wild winter nights, especially during Yule, people driving past Wagner's Farm still report seeing riders in the snow. And sometimes, if you look carefully, you might see a woman among them – sometimes running, sometimes riding, but always with that same expression: terror mixed with triumph, as if she finally found what she was looking for, only to realize too late what it would cost her.

"My cousin Jordan saw her just last winter," I said softly, unable to stop myself from finishing the story. "Said she looked right at him as the Hunt passed overhead. Said her eyes..." I stopped, remembering how Jordan's voice had shaken.

"What about her eyes?" Sophia asked.

"Said they were crying tears of blood. And she was smiling."

The wind picked up again, whistling through the trees. And somewhere in the storm, we could have sworn we heard hoofbeats.
