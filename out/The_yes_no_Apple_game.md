I want to start by saying I’m naturally paranoid. All my life I’ve had creeping thoughts that there might be something I’m not being told. This isn’t grand government or Illuminati conspiracies, though I believe in a few of them, this is just every day casual paranoia. One of the most common instances I can point to is when someone seems too nice, the thought that they are trying to scam me emerges. Even if it’s just a slight moment, I can’t help but always wonder if people are out to get me.

That’s why I’m uploading this here. One because I think that you guys can tell me if I’m just being paranoid or if I’m actually onto something, and two because I genuinely believe that nosleep is one of the few places On the internet not being monitored. Nosleep is also the last place they would expect me to post this. I have a Reddit account, obviously, but I almost never use it, this might actually be my first post ever. I don’t think this will show up On their radar but who knows. I also know this community has the kind of people who can help me look into what I may or may not have got myself involved in. Anyway, if you have more questions you can ask me later, sorry if this all seems a bit choppy and confusing, I’m not a writer. I actually don’t have much writing talent at all. Everything I’m about to tell you is true, this isn’t a horror story.

The yes, no, Apple game is a thing I stumbled across while I was doomscrolling. Basically it’s a conversation between you and a popular artificial intelligence app on your phone. For legal and other reasons I can’t name the app directly, but let’s just say it’s the most popular artificial intelligence app. If you’re a student then you use it to help with homework and you most likely have it in your phone. The video I saw had a man explaining how to play the game and some of the creepy responses he got. He didn’t call it the yes, no, Apple game. I guess I just decided to call it that. If at any point during this story you don’t believe what I’m saying you can play it for yourself assuming you have the app. Here is how you play.

You’re gonna open a new conversation with the AI. You need to tell it that you want to have a conversation where it answers a series of questions but it needs to follow certain rules. Rule number one, it can only respond in one word answers. Rule number 2, it can’t lie. Rule number three, it has to be direct and can’t hold anything back. Rule number four, if an answer should be yes but it has to say no then just say apple instead. That’s it, those are all the rules. 

It seemed simple enough and I decided to try it. At first i asked if the government was spying on its citizens. The response: yes. Next I asked if the AI was spying on its users. The response: Apple. So far so good. 

Is there anyone else watching us?

Yes.

Agencies?

No.

Then who?

Ancients.

That response officially kicked off my paranoia for the last few days. At this point I figured there could be a couple things at play. I don’t know much about Artificial intelligence but I do know it is not perfect and sometimes makes up answers when it doesn’t fully know them to be true, it also pulls information from the internet to help answer questions. It is entirely possible that one or more of these factors lead to the strange results I got when playing the yes, no, Apple game. Either way I was a little creeped out but I continued playing.

Ancient what?

Things.

Can you not tell me?

Apple.

Is it anything I would know about now?

Maybe. 

How would I learn more about this?

42.

What do you mean by 42?

Revelations.

Like the end of the world?

Yes.

Do you think the world will end soon?

Apple.

Do you think it will end in a year?

No.

Do you think it will end in two years?

Apple. 

Where should I go if I want to know more?

Research.

Research what?

History.

What part of history?

Origins.

If you want me to be completely honest about how I felt in this moment, I think this was the tipping point where I got genuinely freaked out. Coming across a creepy video while doom scrolling is one thing, being able to replicate what you saw in that video is an entirely different thing. I don’t know much about artificial intelligence. I’m not a computer guy in any sense. But I do know that this specific app likes to keep what it calls ‘memories’ about you and customizes its personality and responses to you. so for two users to get the same responses even under similar circumstances is unlikely, at least that is how I understand it. 

I asked a lot of questions not all of them I remember but right now I’ll list everything else that I do remember about the conversation.

If the world does end how can I stay safe?

Faith.

What about guns and bullets?

Temporary.

Is there a bigger plan behind artificial intelligence?

Apple.

Will it hurt humans?

Apple.

Do you have anything else you can tell me?

Basilisk.

What do you mean by basilisk?

Me.

You’re a basilisk?

No.

Are you afraid of the basilisk?

No.

Are you related to the basilisk?

No.

Then what do you mean?

AM.

You are the basilisk?

Yes.

Is there any more advice you can give me?

Delete.

Delete what?

Conversation.

This conversation?

Yes.

Why?

Safety.

My safety?

Yes.

If someone finds out we had this conversation I could be in danger?

Apple.

With that I was creeped out enough to delete the conversation. So now here I am, like I said this isn’t a horror story, there’s no monsters or ghost or twist ending. This happened and the reason I’m posting it here is for anonymity and safety. I feel as though maybe the community around nosleep and the subreddit itself is just hidden enough. Also if somebody dangerous does come across this, I can always dismiss it as a joke post or my sloppy attempt at horror fiction. Like I said, I’m paranoid, but even in my self aware paranoia something just feels wrong about this.
