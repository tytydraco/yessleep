Hello. My name is Matthew Eguani. I think it's May 9th, 2009. I'm writing this from the basement of Catherine Ferguson Academy in Detroit. I don't know who will read this, if anyone ever does... but please, send help.

Let me start from the beginning.

Yesterday, around 7:22 PM, I was at my friend Emanuel's house — we all call him Manny. Camila, Mateo, Troy, and I were just hanging out like normal. Then we all got a notification at the exact same time.

It looked like an Amber Alert, but the header said: **"International Amber Alert."** I'd never seen or even heard of that before. The message itself made everything worse:

>

We all just looked at each other. Confused. Nervous. At first, we assumed it was some elaborate prank, maybe a hacker or something. But then, a second alert came in. This time it had all the official formatting: FEMA headers, emergency tones, proper grammar. It simply said:

>

We started to panic.

I tried calling my parents — nothing. No signal. No bars. No Wi-Fi. Nothing. But we could still receive these alerts somehow. That’s what made it worse.

We did what the alert said. Me and Mateo locked all the doors and windows while Camila, Troy, and Manny looked for things to barricade them. About twenty minutes later, we met back in the living room, breathless, panicked, and not feeling any safer.

Manny, frustrated that his phone still had no service, went to check the fuse box in case something had blown. The fuse box was outside. We begged him not to go — literally begged — but he just brushed us off.

He stormed out the back door.

From the window, we could see part of the backyard, but not where the fuse box was — just around the corner. We heard him muttering and fumbling with something, and then...

Silence.

Then: **breathing.** Loud. Wet. Unnatural.

And then — a crash. Manny was **thrown** across the yard. We saw his body slam into a tree like he weighed nothing.

Everything after that happened in flashes.

We ran — stumbling over each other. Me and Mateo realized the back door was still open. We turned around just as the screams started.

Manny’s screams.

They were... unreal. Not like someone being hurt. Like someone having their **soul** torn apart.

Mateo rushed to slam the door shut. I was frozen. Couldn’t move. Couldn’t even breathe. His screams kept going until they suddenly stopped. Just silence.

We re-barricaded the door and bolted upstairs.

Camila and Troy were huddled in the corner of Manny’s room. Troy looked at us with wild eyes and whispered, "Get the **FUCK** in here. Now!"

We locked the door. Put a chair under the handle. Closed the blinds. Turned out the lights.

And waited.

Scratching. Slow, deep scratching echoed from outside. Something **knew** we were in there.

We decided we couldn’t stay. Whatever that thing was, it **threw** a human being across a yard. It would break through that house eventually.

I went to Manny’s parents' room. I’d been there before and knew they kept a Smith & Wesson revolver hidden in the dresser. I found it. Loaded. I also found spare rounds, a first aid kit, and — finally — the keys to Manny's dad’s car.

We prepared fast. We padded our shoes so we wouldn’t make noise. Camila helped tie pillows around her feet. We unbarricaded the side door and slipped out into the night.

The air felt wrong. *Heavy.*

We crouch-walked toward the driveway. Just as the car came into view, we heard **clicking.** Like bones tapping against metal.

We ran.

Troy jumped into the driver’s seat. Mateo and I slid in. Camila barely made it — Troy hit the gas before she even shut the door.

As we pulled out of the driveway, I looked back.

**Manny’s body** was **strung up** in the tree.

But worse — something was **on the roof** of the house.

It wasn’t human. It was pale, with a sickly greenish tint. Its limbs were *too long,* like old rubber hose animation, but **stiff.** It crouched like a beast, but the limbs were **inverted** in a way that made my stomach twist.

Its face had no real features. Just **indents** where eyes should be — and those eyes... they *reflected light.*

Not like animal eyes.

Like **human** eyes.

And somehow... they looked **sad.**

But not empty. There was *joy* in that sadness. **Sadistic** joy.

We sped off at nearly 90mph.

Then — **THUMP.**

The car lurched. I looked back. That thing was **chasing us.** On all fours. **Keeping pace.**

Mateo screamed at Troy to go faster. We hit 100mph, but it was **still there.** Its eyes locked onto us.

Camila screamed and fired a shot through the back window. The revolver cracked like thunder.

The creature faltered. Slowed. She fired again. Twice. Four times.

On the fourth shot, it **collapsed.**

We didn’t say a word for 20 minutes.

Then Troy whispered, "Guys... we need gas."

Eventually, we found a dim gas station. Mateo threw Troy a $50 bill. Troy ran in like his life depended on it. While pumping gas, we heard *trees moving* nearby.

Crashing.

Troy dropped the pump, dove into the car, and floored it — **with the pump still attached.**

A creature leapt out from the forest. This one was **taller.** Paler. Its limbs dragged like spider legs. It hurled a rock — it flew through the broken rear window and **hit Mateo in the head.** Blood sprayed.

I grabbed the first aid kit. Camila grabbed the **flare gun.**

She fired.

The creature **screamed.** Like a child. It fell behind, vanishing in the darkness.

We argued. I told her we needed the flare gun for emergencies. She just stared ahead, hands shaking.

Eventually, we decided to head to the school. Catherine Ferguson Academy. When we got there, the doors were barricaded. People were inside.

I banged on the window and saw kids from our class with makeshift weapons. They didn’t want to open. I held up the revolver and **bluffed.**

Told them I’d shoot.

They opened the door. Once they realized it was us, they helped rebarricade.

Turns out... **everyone’s** parents are missing. Gone. Phones don’t work. But **somehow** we have internet. News articles confirm it: these things are appearing **everywhere.**

We were brought to the gym. They’ve turned it into a base — beds, food, supplies. Maybe fifty kids total.

We had rice and chicken. We tried to sleep.

Then... the shaking started.

The gym is huge — 200ft long, 50ft tall ceilings. On the eastern wall, there are windows near the roof.

We saw something looking in.

Not a face. Just an **eye.**

**Massive.**

Then the wall **caved in.**

It wasn’t a creature. It was something... **beyond**. Bigger than any building. Screaming like the earth was being split in half.

Kids ran. Some didn’t make it. The ones who stayed behind fired BB guns.

It didn’t help.

The thing **crashed through** the gym. Stone and steel meant nothing to it.

I ran. Camila ran. Screams behind us. Bones snapping. Flesh tearing.

Now I’m in the basement. I don’t know if anyone else made it.

**Please.** There are kids alive at Catherine Ferguson Academy — 2750 Selden St, Detroit.

If you’re reading this, we need help.

This isn’t a drill.

– Matthew
