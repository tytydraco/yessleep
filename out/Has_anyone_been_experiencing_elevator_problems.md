This happened to me last night (around 16 hours ago), and I still haven't been able to figure out wth happend nor get any sleep.

I live on the 8th floor of a 12 story appartment building (soviet style commie block). Last night I was coming back home from work, same time I usually do. I entered one of the elevators (there's 2 in total) and pressed the button for the 8th floor.

The elevator started making usual noises as it's about to move (the engine is old and loud, but not too loud). After more than 10 seconds of noises, it still didn't move. In fact, it sounded like that initial engine starter noise was placed on repeat, or kind of like when a cassette jams in those old cassette players.

Once the strange noise stopped, the light flickered and elevator started moving - DOWNWARDS. 

In case it wasn't clear, I was on ground floor when I got on the damn thing. Also, I noticed that the light color was different, more yellow than white (kind of like those older lightbulbs with that strong yellow glow). 

And so the elevator started moving from the fround floor to my eight floor - DOWNWARDS. There is no indicator which floor I'm on inside the elevator cabin, but the floor numbers are visible on the outside doors. Except this time they were arabic numbers, not roman as I'm used to.

As the elevator stopped on the "8th floor" I got out, and saw an apartment with the same number as mine, except the door looked nothing like my door. The number was the same, but nothing else even simillar. Doormat, the knob, even the wood that the foor was made of. The keyhole was something I've never seen before. It wasn't even a hole in fact, but it seemed to go outwards, more like a knob but stranger shape and smaller. Not sure what even I can compre that shape to.

Before I even got the chance to process what happened, something opened the apartment door. Yes, SOMETHING. I have no idea what it was or what it looked like honestly. It was like my eyes saw it, but my brain could't process it. Not even the shape or anything.

Than that SOMETHING said something. Or at least I think it did. Noises came out that sounded weird to say the least (kind of like the "speach" in Papers, Please video game, that's the best I can think of to compare it to something). I did nothing at that point, only stood there confused. After a while (a few seconds I think) I backed up into the elevator. As I closed the door, I also heard the apartmant door close. And as it did, complete darkness. It felt like I was in the void. No noises from the flickering light, or the humming of the elevator's electric engine. Nothing. I'd say that i couldn't even feel any gravity. It was as if I was floating in space. 

After what felt like a decade (but was probably no more than 10 seconds), the elevator light flickered back on. That same ugly yellow light. But in the small glass window looking outside of the elevator, I could still see that damn void. The absolute nothingness behind two sets of doors. 

I pressed floor 0, aka the ground floor. The elevator made its' standard noise, and started moving - this time UPWARDS. As I looked through the small window, nothing but darkness. That same darkness comparable to the void, as I saw when I closed the door leaving the "8th floor". 

The elevator reached floor 0, and for a few seconds there was still darkness outside. I didn't dare to even think of opening the door. Just as I finally began to panick (I was confused before, but fear didn't set in yet), the light flickered again. Just for a fraction of a second. And then, everything came back to normal. I mean everything. The outside of the window wasn't the void, but the regular ground floor hallway. The light wasn't that old ugly yellow, but more modern white. Even the air seemed to be different than before - familiar. I didn't get the chance to even exit the elevator, when it started moving. Upwards. To the 8th floor. My 8th floor.

It was more than clear at that time, I was in front of my apartment door, the keyhole was regular, and my key fit in it perfectly, as always. After I got inside, everything looked and felt exactly the same.

I have never before or since experianced anything like this, nor have I ever had any "paranormal" encounters, or whatever you'd like to call them. Also, I haven't taken any drugs ever in my life, and even though I socially enjoy alcohol, I haven't drank any for more than a month. No signs of any mental illness as well (until now at least). I also never told this to any of my friends for obvious reasons.

This whole thing lasted like 1-2 minutes max, or at least I think so. And I have no clue what to think of it. As far as I'm aware, nothing has changed ever since, except for one sleepless night.

If someone has any sort of explanation, advice, or even a theory, I would appreciate it a lot.

If not, I guess it's the stairs for me for the rest of my life.
