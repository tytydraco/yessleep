My daughter went missing a week ago. 

No one seems to have noticed. They look at this thing like it’s my daughter. But I know better. I was there when whatever wanted her took her away. Replaced her. 

My husband and I have been going through a rough patch since the beginning of this year. Small things were building to be larger arguments, until we didn’t want to be around each other day to day. Separation was looming, but we were doing everything in our power to keep that at bay. 

One random evening, after a long argument, I felt a call to our garage. While sorting through totes full of dead air and stored away winter clothes I found a tote full of our summer memories from when our daughter was 5 years old. We had been happy then, arguments were non-existent in our home, there seemed to be too much warmth there for them to cultivate. We would plan fun dinners and even more joyful outings. It felt like it was ages ago, when in reality it was just a few years passed. 

While flipping through the stacks of albums and drawings from our daughter, I found a feather. It looked to be a hawk feather, or something closely related, but larger and freckled with deep black spots. My husband had found it while we were camping at Whitehall National Park. It had been laying on our camping gear when we had awoken one morning. He packed it away carefully, as a memento from one of our many camping trips. We had done research on it when we had gotten home, but had never been able to place the bird it fell off of. 

I brought it into our dining room, laying it on the kitchen table while I prepared dinner. Later on we sat together, with masks of a happy family on our faces for our daughter, while eating our chicken and broccoli amalgamation. 

My husband had been absentmindedly staring at the feather while eating, before he announced that we should go camping again, like we used to. The excited gaggle of incomprehensible words our daughter let out was enough for me to agree, even if I did not feel up to being feasted on by deer flies that weekend. Her excitement could light up a room, it was hard to say no. 

Before we knew it it was Friday, and we were packed and heading to Whitehall. Our daughter's excitement had gotten to us, we were becoming more and more keen on the trip as we got closer. Maybe this would be the thing that brought us back together. 

We found a spot near the Whitehall River, a spot that was sought after but surprisingly void of campers when we arrived. It was private, much deeper into the forest than the other campsites. We set up our area, and then traversed the trails looking for dried sticks to build our fire. Our daughter took off ahead of us, wanting to lead the way on our small adventure. My husband lightly grabbed my hand, leaving room for me to remove it, but instead I grasped it as we walked. It felt right.

Soon enough we had enough sticks to start a fire so we headed back to our campsite, our daughter once again leading the way. She had found a feather exactly like the one we found in the past, she was waving it in front of her like a conductor as we walked. 

We sat together around our small fire, while our daughter asked us a million and one questions about how grass got its color, or how the stars sat so close together, or if trees could feel love, and with each question we answered as well as we could. She started to zone off as the fire got warmer and the night got darker, and soon enough she was sleeping in her small camp chair. 

We carried her off to our tent, and came back out to talk and watch the fire crackle some more. I never felt myself fall asleep, but I did feel my husband shaking me awake. 

“Violet isn’t in the tent”, is the thing that knocked me out of my tired stupor. I followed behind him to check, as if he would ever make up such a gross joke. I only really believed him when I laid eyes on her disheveled sleeping bag. 

Immediately we started yelling her name, getting louder and louder as we heard no answer back. My mind kept telling me she’d be around this corner, or she would be in this pile of drying brush, but each time there would be no sign of her. There were no footprints or scuffles in the dirt. The sun was still deep in the mountains, it wouldn’t be light out for hours, and our girl was deeply afraid of the dark. She would never leave our campsite, at least not of her own volition, but there were no signs of someone struggling to take her away. She was a smart one, she’d never just follow someone deep into the forest without waking us. 

My husband decided to head to the front of the Park to get the rangers, he kept trying to call their emergency number but the lack of cell service kept rearing its ugly head. He took off in our small SUV as fast as he could, leaving me alone to scream and search for her. 

Soon enough the screaming became pleading, begging the forest to bend until I could see her and know she's safe. 

While searching I found myself going deeper into the brush, not really caring at this point if I got lost with her. I found myself in a small clearing, it felt like it was perfectly shaped into place in this forest, even though no logging or cutting was allowed here. 

Sitting in the middle of the clearing, I could see a small hunched form. Their back was arched, unnaturally deep in its bend, with an oddly shaped shirt covering the bottom half, and their long dark hair was hiding their face from view. 

Rushing over I was sure it was my daughter, my Violet, but once I reached her… my mind could not catch up with what I was seeing. There aren't really any words to describe what was happening before me. 

The hunched form was holding its ankles, its face hidden between its knees while small muffled whines came from it. Its hair was shortening itself, the follicles eating at the length and pulling it back into its roots. The part of its spine that I could see was shaping itself, forming and cutting against the papery skin along its back until it joined the arch of the person hunched with it, popping itself into place when it found the bend it wanted. It sounded awful, painful, and so loud in this open space. What I thought was a shirt was actually feathers, molting and popping themselves off the things back, leaving white pockmarked pale skin in its place. The holes pulled themselves closed, sinew reaching across the space until only skin was left. 

It heard me come upon it, I could see it try to pick its head up from its spot to look at me, but their rigid neck kept their head in place until it was done doing what was needed. 

My mind told me to run away, but my feet kept me firmly in place, the only thing I could do was witness this… transformation. I’m not really sure what else to call it. 

Once the spine had found its home, their legs began forming, cracking in and out of place in a painful show. The form finally pulled its head away, in what seemed to be agony, but there wasn’t really anyway to tell. 



Its mouth hadn't formed yet. 



When it moved its head back, seemingly to wail, there were only eyes, one much bigger than the other. The rest of its face was moving, its cheek bones would push out and then pull themselves down the pale unmarked skin, and then back into place under their eyes. Their lower lash line would reach down so deep into their face, over the moving cheekbones and away from the raw red of their sclera, before making its way back to where it liked. 

Their legs kept cracking, lengthening and shortening themselves, almost unable to find the right place until the soft tissue of their knee rippled and kept the bone where it wanted it. I never saw the mouth form, their legs kept my full attention until I heard a guttural gasp enter the space around us. Looking up, trailing my eyes across moving skin and tissue connecting, my eyes found the creature's mouth.

It was open, in a mimicry of a cry, but it just couldn't take that shape yet. Or it didn't know how to. Finally, the lips found their shape, broken and plastered across a deeply white face, and too close to their eyes to make sense. 

The gums inside started to bleed heavily, leaving rivers down the sides of its cheeks, until one by one, pockets opened up to push rounded teeth out. This seemed to be the most painful part for the writhing thing, its scream finding its way out of its throat and into the clearing. 

The noise pushed me out of my frozen daze, a primal part ticked away at my very cells until I threw my body to run back to the cleaning opening. I turned myself away, falling when my feet couldn't catch up with my mind. Pushing myself up I didn’t look back as I started to make my way in any direction that was away from that thing. Until I heard it try to say something, something so familiar it stopped me almost dead in my tracks. 

Unmistakingly, and in a voice I’ve heard since my daughter could speak, the thing pushed out the words;

“Muhhhhhh…..muhhhhhh……muhnnmmmmmm……mummmmmmmmm.”

I looked around, hoping to see signs of my husband, or a sign of anything that belonged in the world I knew before seeing this thing.

My eyes found the only shape of a person in the treeline, My Violet. 

She was standing there, next to something unimaginably tall, crooking itself down so it could reach her hand better. She looked terrified. I screamed out her name, but it was as if she couldn't see or hear me, she was staring at the monstrous form behind me. Watching it take its shape. I threw myself in her direction, leaving the squirming thing behind me.

As I was getting closer, the form holding her took a step back into the reaching dark, the black seeping around them like a mist, taking my unwilling daughter with it. She fought to get away, but the form had no issue pulling her along. Finally I had made it to the trees she was in the middle of, the dark seeping away leaving only the forest. While searching for any sign of her something grabbed me from behind and pulled me back into the clearing. 

I started clawing and pushing away, until my husband's face came into view, terrified but with a sheen of relief plastered across it. As I was about to tell him everything that I had seen, my eyes looked past him and saw the rangers wrapping a blanket around a small girl in the middle of the cleaning. 

My daughter's eyes were staring back at me. 

That thing had found its shape finally. That shape was my sweet girl, Violet. 

The scream that released from me was unbidden, I started to push myself away from him once again, the relief changing into terror as I fought to get away. 

I learned later an EMT had joined the rangers with my husband and administered a sedative to me, they all thought the panic had caused me to go into some sort of episode. 

How do I tell them the thing sitting in the ambulance with us isn’t my daughter? That my daughter was still out there, in the dark forest?

I tried to tell my husband, whispering to him what happened in case the thing could hear, but he just seemed to get more incredulous as I spoke. How could he believe me, when the thing sitting two feet away looked so much like her. It talked like her, joked like her, questioned the EMT’s exactly like my daughter would. 

I started to believe that maybe I made the whole thing up, until we got home.

Small things weren’t right. This Violet hated foods my daughter adored, she didn't have certain scars my daughter had, or they were misshapen and slightly above their original spot. Her freckles were darker and sat higher on her cheeks then they used to.

My husband would stare at her sometimes, her mannerisms made her seem like a stranger at moments, it felt like he was starting to realize she wasn't right, but then she'd do something unmistakingly Violet and he’d laugh it off and go back to his normal routine. 

This thing was not my daughter, and I was the only one who knew or cared. Even the thing didn’t seem to understand it, it would spend its day acting as Violet did. It would go to school, come home and eat dinner with us, ask us to read stories and stay up late to watch spongebob on tv. Sometimes I would find it staring off, either out the windows or into space, as if it was entranced. It would feel me watching and shake itself out of its stupor, and ask me a question only Violet could come up with. 

A few days after it all happened I couldn't take it anymore. I left late in the night and found myself driving back to WhiteHall. I was the only one who knew she was still out there, alone and scared. I had to find her, even if it meant I got lost in the deep black forest with her. I searched for hours, until it became light, and until the light turned into a humid burn from the sun.

My husband found me at the trailhead, sweaty and dirty, almost 11 hours after I had left. He had used a find my iphone feature to see where I was. 

He held me as I sobbed. While he thought of how he was losing his wife to insanity, all I could think about is how we lost our baby to a feathered thing in the forest.
