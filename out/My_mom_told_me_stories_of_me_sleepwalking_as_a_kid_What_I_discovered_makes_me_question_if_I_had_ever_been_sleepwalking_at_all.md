When I was young, I used to sleepwalk. My mother would tell me these stories about myself that I would have no memory of.

She said it first started when I was around five or six years old. She had put me to bed one night, then, around an hour or so later, she heard a noise coming from down the hallway.

She shut the book she had been reading and went to investigate. She told me that she found me sitting at the kitchen table, pretending to eat. At first, she asked me what I was doing, and after not receiving a response, she approached, upon closer inspection she realized that I wasn't awake to respond. She stood there and watched me for some time, as she herself hadn't actually seen a sleepwalker before.

She said that I sat there acting as if I were eating, then I would stop and turn to the chair to my right. To her, it appeared like I was having a conversation with someone, though she mentioned that I wasn't speaking any words, more like slight whimpers and groans. I'd then laugh quietly in my seat, then continue eating.

After nearly 20 minutes of this, I got up from my chair, took a few steps, and laid down on the floor. My mother then woke me up and told me that I needed to go back up to bed. 
Well, I don't remember this interaction, she told me I was incredibly confused as I thought I was in bed. She led me by the hand back to my bedroom and tucked me back in.

A few months later, this happened again. My mother had gotten up in the middle of the night to get something to drink. As she walked into the kitchen she nearly jumped out of her skin when she saw a silhouette of someone standing in front of the window.

She switched on the kitchen light and saw that it was me, that I was standing in front of the glass, motionless. She walked over to me asking what I was doing. Of course when she got closer, she saw that my eyes were shut.

Apparently, I stood at that window for nearly a half-hour, before turning and walking back to my bedroom. My mom followed closely to make sure I went back to bed and sure enough, I did.

It was odd for me to hear about these things I was doing after I had fallen asleep. The concept that my body would move when I had no conscious control over it made me, nervous.

My mother found it somewhat amusing, but I didn't seem to think so. 

Over the following year, I only sleepwalked a few times. Most of them just ended up with me getting up from my bed and wandering into another room, before falling asleep on the floor. My mother would usually find me the next morning and wake me up.

Then, after nearly a year had passed, my mother had gotten up one night and while she was passing by my room, she decided to peek in on me. When she opened my door, I was nowhere to be found.

She wandered around the entire house but couldn't find me in any of the rooms. Then, as she was walking through the living room, something out of the corner of her eye caught her attention. She saw the vague outline of someone standing outside underneath one of the street lamps.

As she turned to get a better look, she quickly realized it was me. She threw open the door and dashed outside. I was apparently standing in the center of the road, all by myself.

Luckily, our street was on a dead-end and didn't see very much traffic after 9:00 p.m. 

She called out my name as she ran towards me, but I didn't seem to react at all.

As she slowed her approach, she saw that I was gesturing with my arms, as if I were having a conversation with someone. She walked up to me and grabbed my wrist. 

When she did this, I apparently began to freak out. I started to shout and fight against her, as if she were some sort of beast attempting to devour me. 

A minute or two later, I had woken up and snapped out of my frenzy. When I came to, I asked my mother where I was, and she calmly explained that I had walked outside while I was sleeping. I apologized to her, and she led me back inside.
