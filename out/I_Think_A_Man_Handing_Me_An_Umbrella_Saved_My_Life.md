Honestly? I have no explanation for it. The entire experience was rather dream-like; I spent a lot of time trying to make sense of it, my theories bordering on conspiratorial, until I discovered that the most coherent way to relay what happened is just to say it outright. No frills, no nothing. 

So.

It was the last week of November when I moved to Arkansas.

I nestled in a small town tucked somewhere in the folds of the Ozarks; not for the scenery, or any great life decision—a job, a romantic pursuit. No, my grandpa Phillip had passed a few months earlier, and I ended up here more out of orbit than intention. He used to talk about the Ozarks like he was in love with them. Honestly, he probably was. Gentle as a sigh but jagged as a river, he’d say. With all the soft curves of a woman. It felt, at the time, like the place might remember him, even if no one else could; these mountains were his lover; the hills and hollers, my grandmother.

His death hit me hard. Grandpa Phil was my everything, my moon and stars. He was what you could call a 'cool grandpa.' He introduced me to the video game world, taught me how to drink safely, taught me how to shoot. My mother was a prostitute and my father was in and out of prison, and Phil stepped in to ensure I had a good life, a normal life. He saved me. 

I never did thank him enough for that.

The move didn’t help. I thought it would, but it didn't. I guess I was grappling for some sort of answer, one that, when it came, would make everything better; I just had to find it, find it, find it. Starting over is still starting from scratch, and roots don’t regrow just because you transplant the soil.

I kept to myself. Let time settle on things. There’s a kind of quiet you only hear in cold weather, where everything feels like it’s just waiting. I walked a lot. Thought too much. Slept too little. I considered things. Unknown things, secret things. Forbidden things. 

There was this one particular day. Cold, slate-gray sky. The wind carried that strange pressure it gets before a storm, like the breath before a word. I found myself lingering at Main Street, watching the last bus wind out of town. That part doesn’t really matter; just a moment I thought I needed to mark, somehow.

It was a pretty little town. Everybody knew each other. Little miscellaneous shops lined every road. There was a large courthouse in the center of town. I distinctly didn't belong there. Not in that town, not in those mountains. 

I wasn’t alone. There was a man nearby. I hadn’t noticed him until he spoke.

He looked… familiar. Not exactly, but close enough to make something inside me ache. A warm kind of ache, like nostalgia wrapped in flannel. He held a black umbrella, the kind that makes shadows even under clouded skies. He had a corduroy sweater on, one you'd get from a thrift store. Age-old smile lines pulled at his eyes.

He looked up, then at me, and said simply:

“It’s going to rain soon.”

Then he held out the umbrella. “You’ll want this.”

I didn’t ask questions. Just nodded. I took the umbrella and tucked it into my bag. I didn’t plan to use it. I didn’t think I’d need it. I didn't care. I had things to do. Fuck that umbrella. It didn't matter. Nothing mattered anymore. 

I took the next bus out of town.


 

I don’t remember much about the mountain. I remember the cold. The wind. The silence. I remember the stretch of sky. I think I closed my eyes, when I fell. Instinct. I was scared. 

The next thing I knew, I was standing by the road again.

It was the same road as before. The sky was dark and clear. There was a temperature. There was... a star. I don't know. It was so normal. My feet felt heavier. It was drizzling, but I was dry.

An umbrella was open above me. My fingers were curled around the handle.

An officer pulled over, rolling his window down. Thick black shades obscured his eyes.

“What are you doing out here at this hour?”

I paused. My mouth opened before I had time to think. The words came involuntary, unbidden.

“Waiting for the rain,” I said.

He gave me a ride home. I went inside. All the lights were on; I was certain I'd turned them all off when I left. My phone, my notebook, my will, everything that had been in my backpack when I left was now stacked neatly on the kitchen table. 

Sleep came unusually easy that night. 

The next day, I went back to that spot on Main Street. I waited for a few hours. The man never showed up. I retraced the steps of my brief mountain hike. Now, here's an important detail; my boots are custom made. They were Phil's, and they were a gift from a German frau he had fallen in love with. The make, the print—all unique. There was not another pair in all of existence.

And there, in the mud, leading all the way to the edge of the cliff, were my shoe prints. Fresh. Mine. 

It's been about two weeks now. I went back to work, I volunteer at the local animal shelter, and I still don't understand. The umbrella has been sitting in my bathtub ever since. It's always wet. It never dries. Some days its wetter than others. I notice the excess water on long nights after difficult shifts. 

I don't know what that man did, but he did something.

I wish I had thanked him for it.
