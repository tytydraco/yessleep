After two disturbing nights filled with confusion, anxiety, and playing with the faith of souls, today I would look at this town in a whole different light.

Daylight.

I hadn't slept much as I left the store quite early in the morning and while I still felt drained, my mind was restless. Too much had happened. And this new routine of mine was making me forget that there is a whole other world out there. One that I used to live in less than a few days ago.

I passed all the houses and shops again that looked like a copy of reality. That little worm of suspicion was burying itself deeper and deeper inside of my mind. This place was not right, I could tell. But if I knew this was wrong it could only mean that some part of me knew what was supposed to be right.

I simply wasn’t sure where exactly I took that comparison from. My plan was to look through town, maybe talk to some people but my plans never seem to work out.

Before I knew what I was doing, my legs had carried me to Evergreen Avenue.

It was just the way it usually looks when I work the regular hours in the lamp store. Or, used to. The pub next door was closed, there were some empty cigarette boxes and trash lying in front showing that there were people in there last night. Well, I already knew about that as Leon had walked in to figure out why they were so loud. Only to come back with splatters of blood and no clear answer.

I had never paid much attention to the other buildings across our store. Of course, I’ve seen them before but I guess my mind didn’t register them consciously. There was a bookstore, a boutique selling clothes that looked rather ugly, and a small kebab shop. Alright, the regular stores would be closed at night but don’t fast food places stay open longer? At least longer than 9 pm, but at night their lights are out just like all the others.

I moved closer to the one place I wasn’t planning on visiting but its magnetism was already pulling me in.

I’d almost forgotten how boring the lamp store looks during the day. All the lights were off and you might guess that the shop isn't open at all. I pushed against the door and it opened. I took a sniff walking in, to see whether I could make out what Ms. Smithel was talking about yesterday but it smelled just like it always did. A mixture of plastic and metal.

“Riley? You better be looking to buy something because I do not feel like chit-chatting.”

It was Mr. Nipps, empty eyes and sparkly grin as always. I have to admit, I felt a little disappointed that it wasn’t Leon working. Although I doubt he ever works during the day.

“Well, no. Not now that I know what these lamps do,” I promptly responded.

With a scornful snout, he grabbed a pair of scissors.

“Well, while you are here you might as well help me unpack some of these lamps. We had a dozen delivered this morning!”

“Why so many?” I asked. The store was full to the brink with lamps.

“Another colleague ordered them. Apparently, customers were asking for specific elements.”

“Leon?” I asked.

Mr. Nipps rolled his eyes.

“Let me guess? He came to help during your shift even if I told him not to? This boy is the personification of a headache. If I could fire him, he’d be off the door in a second.”

I grabbed the scissors and started cutting through the carton. Mr. Nipps seemed awfully chatty considering he had just said he wasn’t in the mood.

“This is your store, is it not?” I cheekily asked.

“Well yes and also no. Even I don’t make all decisions on my own,” he said with a bitter undertone.

“So did Leon apply or did you ask him, just like you did with me?”

Mr. Nipps shook his head.

“He was suggested, just like you. Around the same time, I believe. I picked him for nights and you for days. Now we’re mixing it up a little. The store is awfully vibrant at night isn’t it?”

Mr. Nipp’s irritated expression vanished and turned into excitement.

I nodded.

“Well, I hope you enjoy it because soon you might be doing it every night,” he grinned.

“Why is that?”

The only response I received was a wink. That was all we talked about. When I realized he was only making me work, I found an excuse and left the store. Again, I hadn’t learned much more. Every person I talk to seems to be speaking in riddles.

When evening came I wondered what my next step would be. The simplest one would probably be to stay inside my cozy bed and sleep the night away. I could use a few hours of peace but I knew that this wasn’t an option. I’m not the kind of person to sit around and wait, I needed to investigate.

Now the question was, should I stop by the lamp store to try and get some information out of that puzzling Leon, or should I visit the pub?

The answer to this question was rather simple.

I really could use a drink right now.

I waited until it was after twelve before making my way back to Evergreen Avenue. I remember Leon telling me that I shouldn't step outside in the dark but I'd been out here before. On the specific night that I saw the lamp store for the very first time. When its warm and bright lights attracted my hazy mind. And I've been inside the pub as well even if that memory is more of a blur.

Now that I was walking through the pitch-black street I realized why he had warned me. This darkness of the night was suffocating. All I saw was the lamp store at the end of the street but what I saw wasn't a problem. It was all that I could hear.

Because while I couldn't make out their shapes, I could tell that I wasn't alone. I listened to the steps surrounding me, heard strange voices giggle, and occasionally scream. I tried to hold my breath, hoping they didn't notice me out here while I looked over to the store.

Leon had been right. It really was a spotlight shining on whoever was in there. And I could see that it was him. For a split second, I contemplated walking over. He was alone in there, playing with the lights. He turned them warmer and then colder again. Experimented with different colors and changed the directions of beams. He seemed to be thoroughly enjoying himself.

For a moment I was so distracted that I'd forgotten the darkness around me. But whoever was out here with me made sure I knew of their presence. I suddenly felt a hot breath against my neck. Instinctively I turned around but of course, I couldn't make out who it was. A cold hand touched my arm but before anything else could happen, I started running.

I ran right towards the door of the pub.

\--

The pub smelled of spilled beer on the wooden floor, hints of cigarette smoke and desperation. The lights were dim but most seats were taken. People were chatting but I couldn’t make out what they were saying through the noise of the music.

I decided to simply walk up to the bartender and ask if they had seen Leon here last night but on my way there I caught the last person was expecting to see again today.

Ms. Smithel. The strange older lady that had come to the lamp store last night.

She was sitting inside a booth all alone with her half-empty pint of Guinness.

“May I join you?” I asked.

She looked surprised and yet delighted to see me.

“I don’t believe I caught your name last night. You were quite busy asking me questions instead,” she said as she gestured me to sit.

I quietly took a seat next to her, unsure how to feel about this situation. Her looks were even more miserable than last night despite the far worse lighting. Most of the other visitors in the pub looked a bit smudged to be perfectly honest.

“I’m Riley. That’s most of what I can tell you, however. You see, I happen to have forgotten a lot about myself,” I said.

“Well, we all lose a little of ourselves when we visit this place.”

She took a big gulp of her drink.

“Your lamp has been delivered by the way. The poor fool will be shedding blood soon,” Ms. Smithle added without ever looking up from her glass.

I swallowed. I’d tried not to think about what I’d done last night.

“Is it someone I know? Are the victims ever?” I asked.

Ms. Smithel laughed.

“Don’t worry, child. You made a good fucking decision.” she slowly got up from her seat and finished the last sip of her Guinness. “It might take a day or two until the effects will hit. Until then, you better stay away from that smelling colleague of yours.”

With that, she headed towards the door. I jumped up from my seat and followed her, for some reason she was surprisingly fast. All I saw was the door open and her disappearing into darkness before it slammed shut again. When I managed to open the heavy door, I saw nothing outside but a faint light coming from my right side.

Now I had three different choices. Go back inside the pub and talk to the barkeeper, walk into the dark, and hope to find Ms. Smithel or the dumbest of them all. Go next door to the lamp store and talk to Leon.

Of course, I made the worst choice of them all.

\--

As I opened the door, I thought I would turn blind. Leon had turned on every single lamp inside the store, including the new ones, and had turned all of them to maximum brightness.

“What the hell?” I shouted.

As my eyes got used to the sudden burst of light, I finally saw Leon’s face among the lamps. His dark eyes were opened wide and his mouth was formed into the biggest smile I’d ever seen. He was dressed just the same as yesterday, including the dried blood on his shirt.

“Riley! Isn’t this wonderful, they will all see us now! I’ve sold five lamps already and the night isn’t even over yet..”

Without blinking once he walked closer towards me.

“You sold five lamps? So you gave five different people bad fortune?” I asked.

“Do you know what kind of lamps those were, Riley? No regular boring bad luck lamps. The real deal. A murder-suicide, a house fire, a-”

“What the hell is wrong with you? I thought you were stuck here like me, are you enjoying this?”

“With every fiber of my body,” he started maniacally laughing as he walked closer towards me. With all this extra light, I could see all the pores in his skin which appeared like they might burst and explode if he kept moving. Or his whole face might just fall off and shatter on the floor like a fragile lamp. Leon didn’t even seem to notice. He never stopped smiling.

Suddenly I realized what Ms. Smithel was talking about. It *was* smelling rotten in here.

Leon moved his hand towards my face and gently caressed my cheek.

“I thought you’d want this too. You so quickly made a judgment last night. Don’t you understand, Riley? We could take over this whole place.”

Leon came even closer. Close enough that his face was right in front of mine. Close enough to realize what I noticed last night but didn’t register until now. His eyes were almost as dark as the night out there.

I distinctly remember that the Leon I met here on my first day had green eyes.
