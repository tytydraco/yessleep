Growing up, I always loved thrifting. My family wasn't exactly well off— I guess that’s a good way of sugar coating it. Truth is we were dirt poor and never had much of anything. In my parents’ eyes, thrifting was an easy way to bring my brother, Paul, and I near endless joy for almost no money, so we went every Sunday. Paul and I even continued this tradition until last week. 

It’s kind of interesting how differently this upbringing effected us. Paul has become somewhat of a hoarder wanting everything he can get his hands on. I was… not quite a minimalist, but I would only want to buy or receive something that I would hold dear to my heart. I want treasures, even if it means not really having much.

Suffice to say that activity has been ruined for me ever since that… thing… burned away everything I hold dear. I guess that’s not fair, it didn’t burn them, it just made me do it. Not like, possessed me “the devil made me do it” or that kind of thing, it just backed me into a corner where I had no other choice.

It was last Sunday morning, so as you could probably guess, I was going thrifting with Paul. We found loads of cool things. He got quite a bit of clothes, we managed to score some matching tees with the logo of our favorite band, he got a camera and a replacement cord for his CD player. And I found a particularly cool looking candle holder. I wasn't going to get it at first. I just picked it up to admire it, but when I went to put it back down, I realized it would be perfect for my writing setup.

I’m a writer. Well I’m supposed to be a writer, but I’m usually dried up so I’m always looking for ideas not only for my writing itself, but for environmental adjustments that might help keep my motivation and creativity pools full. So when I realized this candle holder would– with the right candle in it, give an ambiance that might light the flame that would spark some inspiration.

So that very night, after I’d stuffed my belly with soup, and locked down my apartment. I’d gotten out the tall, white taper candle that I got to go in the holder, I set everything up, and lit the candle. It did work at first, it made me feel like I was in some movie that takes place back before electricity was a thing, so I rolled with that and wrote about an old poet from the days of ancient Greece. 

After about an hour, I felt that familiar dullness of the idea pool drying up, but this time it felt different. This time it didn’t just feel like I was losing my ideas, it felt like they were being stolen from me. I assumed I was just exhausted from the day, we had run a lot of errands, and there was a fair amount of walking around in the hot sun, so I decided to go to bed. 

I cleaned up my journals, tucked in my chair, and blew out the candle. But it didn’t go out… So I tried again. The flame sputtered, but immediately came back to life. I took out an old candle snuffer from my drawer, and held it over the flame. Nothing. I even tried dunking it in water, and while it made a sizzling noise, it still would not go out. 

I couldn’t bear to be awake any longer. I figured that the candle wasn’t that big, so I could bring my blankets into the office and sleep there so I would immediately know if something happened. I had no pets and the office wasn’t especially drafty so most likely it would just burn itself out at some point through the night. 

I tucked myself into the blankets and closed my eyes. The last thing I noticed before falling asleep was the sound of melted wax dripping onto the desk, and opening my eyes to see that the candle somehow seemed bigger than it did before I lit it. But that last part barely had a chance to register before I was dead to the world.

Despite that having been the longest, deepest sleep I’ve ever slept, it was also the least restful. It wasn’t until the next evening that I’d managed to force myself to get up, and even that took every last bit of willpower I had in me. This is very unusual for me, I don’t suffer from insomnia, and I’ve never been much of a night owl, so I’m usually fast asleep by 11:00. Never later than 1:00am, and I’ve never in my life slept past noon.

When I finally managed to stand up with my leaden limbs I saw that the candle definitely was bigger than when I’d lit it. Not just a little bigger, it had nearly quadrupled in size. But the mess of wax… it was everywhere, it coated the whole desk, and was dripping down onto my blankets and was somehow dripping up the wall. I’m not the best at physics but I’m pretty damned sure that’s not how gravity works. 

More than that, I noticed that the more the wax spread, the more rapidly my energy was being zapped from my body. By that time I was certain that it was because of the candle and its holder. In desperation I tried to put it out again. I tried all the things I’d tried the night before over and over and over again. I don’t know what I was expecting, but somehow a new wave of disappointment flooded my body with every failed attempt to extinguish the flame. 

I was barely able to stand, I was about to give up when I had one more idea. It was the last thing I wanted to do. To burn my house, and everything in it to the ground. I wasn’t going to, at first, I’d have rather died with the candle than lose all my precious memories. Birthday gifts from loved ones, photo albums and pen pal letters from friends and family, all the thrifted treasures my brother and I’d collected over the years, every word I’d ever written. I didn’t want to lose it all, but I’d have lost it anyway, and I had to decide whether or not I was dying with it. Whether or not I was going to go on and make more memories with the people who would miss me if I didn’t.

I closed my eyes so as to not witness the horror that I was about to do, picked up the candle, and thrust the flame directly into a stack of journals that were now covered in wax. I questioned for a second if they’d light. But after a few sparks it roared to life in the biggest, hottest fire I’d ever seen. I screamed as every inch of my exposed skin sizzled, melted and hurt in a way that I’d never thought possible. My throat dried and I croaked an attempt to cough up the smoke that was filling my lungs, but I couldn’t inhale enough to actually get the cough out. Then I passed out.

Three days later I woke up in the hospital, my brother sitting in the chair beside my bed. Apparently my neighbors saw the smoke and called the fire department pretty quickly. So I was rescued in time. I had to stay on oxygen for a while, though, because I’d inhaled a lot of smoke. But I’m alive right? That’s the important part… Right?
