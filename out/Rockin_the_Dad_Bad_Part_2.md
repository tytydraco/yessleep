In front of us, just off the road, was huge glowing yellow square sitting atop the tallest truck-stop sign-post I had ever seen:

 

E6

Travel plaza

 

Kevin piloted the sports car into the travel plaza like it was a star-fighter returning to its glowing mothership. Two dozen yellow gas pumps sat under ten-thousand watts of fluorescent illumination from the weather canopy. Another ten thousand watts of illumination lit up the yellow band that wrapped the perimeter of the canopy. The wavy and distorted mirror of the structure was reflected in the wet asphalt.

There were no cars at the pumps. We circled the canopy and pulled into a parking space in front of the Travel-Mart building. There were no cars *anywhere*. Tonight at the E6 travel plaza the lights were on but nobody was home.

Kevin shut the car off and we climbed out of the low bucket seats. The powerful rumble of the Maserati engine was replaced with the faint buzz from the lights. A chime sounded as the sliding glass doors opened for Kevin. A second chime sounded as I followed him into the Travel Mart.

For a rest-stop convenience store, the place was enormous. Fifteen aisles of surgery and fried crap formulated to keep your eyes open and your right foot on the gas. In the rear, a whole section of the store was devoted to travel accessories and trucker stuff. Guitar riffs from Santana emanated from the overhead speakers.

Kevin uttered a whispered “yeah…” and wandered out of sight into the dietary wasteland. I glanced at the cash registers. Nobody was there. If anyone was tending the shop tonight, they weren’t out front where I could see them.

I made a hard right into the potato-chip aisle and fell into a trance-like state in front of the Pringles section. I heard a truck pull to a stop in front of the store. I didn’t think anything of it – of course trucks pull into travel plazas – totally normal.

I grabbed a tube of Pringles and turned to walk to the registers. I glanced out the window and saw the logo on the trailer of the truck that just pulled in: Castle Trucking

The truck driver, a tall, brutish-looking guy wearing a baseball cap and a jacket climbed out of the cab and walked purposefully into the travel plaza shop. He didn’t break stride at the sliding glass doors and they parted just as he was about to collide with them. He looked like the kind of guy who was used to things getting out of his way: sliding doors, people, vehicles. Grizzly bears, probably.

Because of his neanderthal vibe, he was probably used to people assuming he was unintelligent. But I saw something different. I saw a clever man who simply had an extremely straightforward approach to problem solving. Elegant and smart solutions to problems aren’t needed when you can just plow straight through whatever is in your way – physically or metaphorically. Want to get into a room but don’t have the key? Just bust straight through the wall. See someone you don’t like driving their Maserati on the highway? Just ram them with your truck.

He stopped just inside the doors and methodically scanned the travel mart. He made a little disappointed frown when he saw me standing by the chips display.

“Where’s Kevin?”

“Who are you?”

His shoulders slumped when I responded to his question with my own. Like just the idea of conversation was exhausting to him. Talking wasn’t part of his preference for straightforward motion.

Then he gave me a “what are you, stupid?” look, and gestured with both hands at the Castle logo on his hat. Then he pointed at the Castle logo on the breast of his jacket. Then he opened his jacket enough for me to see that the “astl” printed on his T-shirt was part of the word *Castle* and not Coastline or something.

“Your *name* is Castle?”

“Where’s Kevin?”

“My name is Pauline, by the way.”

He sighed, resigning himself to the cumbersome task of conversing with me. “So, you’re the latest one of his sacrificial lambs?”

I was about to ask what he meant by *sacrificial lamb*, but was interrupted by Kevin shouting from the far end of the potato-chip aisle.

“Hey Pauline! If you still want to steal something, how about some Funyions and Pop Tarts?”

The trucker named Castle and I both turned to look at Kevin. Dad-Bod had emerged from the end cap of the aisle near the wall of refrigerators holding an armful of bags of puffed onion rings and strawberry Pop Tart boxes. His smile vanished the instant he saw Castle. He dropped the junk food and ducked out of sight behind the endcap.

What happened next was the dumbest chase I have ever seen outside of an episode of The Three Stooges. Kevin sprinted away next to the refrigerator lane at the end of the rows of shelves. Castle ran down the lane at the cash-register side of the aisles, trying to match Kevin’s escape attempt, aisle-for-aisle.

Kevin reached the end and darted back the other way. Castle saw Kevin’s turn-around at the end of the far aisle and spun around himself, slipping and barely catching himself on the shiny tile floor. Kevin made it back to my end of the store and tried hiding behind the potato-chip aisle end cap.

“I can see you in the security mirror, dumb ass!” Castle shouted.

Kevin feigned another run to the far end of the store. Castle was momentarily fooled and started running towards the far aisles.

Kevin spun around, tripped on the pile of Pop Tart boxes, somehow recovered without falling, rotated around the endcap and ran towards me. Castle, meanwhile, realizing that Kevin had fooled him, flung himself around, glanced at the security mirror in the corner, and ran back to Pringles territory.

That’s how we ended up in a bizarro standoff with Kevin hiding behind me and Castle looming in front of me, breathing like an angry bull.

“Guys, what the fu-“

“Don’t move!” Kevin interrupted. “He can’t get me if you’re in the way.”

I saw absolutely nothing that would prevent the enormous trucker from flinging me aside and pummeling Kevin into a pulp. But he didn’t. Castle just stood in front of me, fists clenched like he was ready for action, but somehow deactivated because I was standing between him and his potential beating victim.

Castle finally spoke. “Just give it up, Kevin. You lost.”

“Not. A. Chance!”

Ten awkward seconds passed. Then ten more that were even more awkward.

“Can someone explain to me just what the *hell* is going on here?”

“Yeah, Kevin,” Castle taunted. “Explain yourself to little miss pawny-pants here.”

*Pawny-pants?* How is that even a real insult?

“My dear friend Pauline,” Kevin answered, “is an upstanding young lady who does not need to be subjected to your insults. Right Pauline?”

“I guess….”

“Furthermore, Castle, Pauline is one hundred percent capable of taking you out. Permanently. Right Pauline?”

“I don’t think-“

Kevin kept talking to Castle, not interested in hearing my opinion about the scenario where I somehow take-out the giant truck driver. “You’re going to end up just like your brother. And I’m going to be fine.”

At the mention of a brother, Castle’s face transitioned from anger to rage. His attempt to murder us with his truck, and the dumb chase through the Travel Mart was just ordinary, run-of-the-mill violence to him. Like it was his day job. But now the conversation had veered into personal territory. I was not happy with this escalation.

“Ready, Pauline! Let’s do it.”

I was not ready. Kevin didn’t care. He took a large step sideways, out from behind the protective cover that I was somehow providing him. Castle followed with his own sideways step. The three of us now formed a triangle: Kevin facing Castle, with me off to the side between them.

“Your move, Pauline,” Kevin shouted. “Take him out!”

Castle turned to face me. “Don’t take me out Pauline. Why make things harder for everyone? Just let nature take its course.” A moment ago, Castle burned with sarcasm and rage. Now he was polite. Contrite, even.

“Take him out! Take him out! Take him out!” Kevin started chanting like he was at a rally.

I tried to work through the social calculus of my situation. Kevin wasn’t exactly my friend – we’d only known each other for about thirty minutes. And in that short half of an hour, he had lied to me about stealing the Maserati. On the other hand, the thuggish Castle did try to kill us with his truck. Kevin and Castle obviously had a long and complicated history. There was no way for me to know who was in the right. Who was on my side. The whole situation was just messed-up.

Fortunately, navigating messed-up, dramatic situations is one of my strengths. Okay, sure, the messed-up and dramatic situations I find myself in are often the result of my own poor decision-making. But still, as unique as this Kevin-vs-Castle-in-the-travel-mart situation was, it was “in my wheelhouse” as they say.

A new song came on the store’s sound system: Axl Rose welcomed me to the jungle. Thanks Axl – that’s exactly what I needed to hear! I let my instincts take over. I decided I would try to take out Castle.

The trucker was well over six feet tall and had a jaw that was about the same size and shape as the front bumper of my Corolla. Even if I could reach his face with my fist, I’d likely just break a knuckle. It’d be like punching the stone Abe Lincoln head on Mount Rushmore. Why then, was Kevin so sure I could “take him out?” Heck, even Castle himself seemed nervous at the idea of me assaulting him.

It was time to stop thinking. I acted. I punched Castle in the shoulder. I didn’t hit him hard – it was just an angry “hey, I’m pissed at you” kind-of punch.

Castle looked at his arm where I punched him. Then looked back at me. Then back to his arm. For an instant, I was sure he was going to clobber me. But instead, he fell to his knees. He held his head in his hands and started moaning “No! No no no! No! Whyyyyyyy?”

I looked at my hand, still balled into a fist. How the hell did my punch – and let’s get real here, it was a lame girly punch – totally ruin this huge guy?

“What is happening!?” I screamed. Castle moved into the next phase of his emotional breakdown by falling into the fetal position and moaning incoherently.

Kevin yelled “Yes! Yes yes yes!” and held his hand up for a high-five.

I stared at his palm for a moment. “Nope,” I said. “I’m noping out. Gimme your keys.”

“Why? You just took him out!”

I screamed “Give me your keys!” and thrust my hand into his jacket pocket. “Where are they? Give them to me!” I didn’t feel anything in his pocket. I shoved him using about a million times as much force as I used to punch Castle. “Give me your keys!” I felt the key fob in his other pocket. “Give it! Give it!”

“Fine! Okay. Just take it. Jeez!”

I pulled the Maserati fob out of his pocket. “*Now* it’s a stolen car, Kevin!” I stormed out of the travel mart.

 

**\* \* \***

 

Nobody knows that I’m a rageful driver. I don’t have road rage all the time, of course. Not with groceries in the trunk or if I’m in a school zone. But sometimes, like in the immediate post-argument-stomping-away phase of a relationship, I really want to lay a patch of rubber on the ground and squeal away like I’m drag racing.

Unfortunately, I drive a fifteen-year-old Toyota Corolla. Even if I stand on the gas pedal, the Corolla pulls away like I’m 90-year-old farmer Mac Gilucutty driving his Model-A to the grange hall. That’s why nobody knows I like to indulge in the occasional rage-induced burn-out. Because my car sucks. The Maserati does not suck.

I settled into the Maserati and glanced back at the travel-mart. Kevin forlornly watched me out the front window. Castle, I assumed, was still crying and squirming on the floor. I turned the car on and smiled at the sound it made – like the God of Internal Combustion was snoring under my seat.

I gave Kevin a sarcastic little salute and exploded out of the parking lot in a cloud of vaporized Italian rubber. I turned left out of the parking lot, violently drifting and fishtailing onto the southbound lane of the highway. I accelerated until the giant yellow E6 sign was no longer visible in the rear-view, then eased the car back to a more reasonable 120. Even though I didn’t touch the sound system, AC/DC’s *Highway to Hell* started playing at a volume loud enough to obscure the not-insignificant road noise.

I flew down the road, back to the hotel where, I assumed, the mandatory-fun corporate event was starting to get into drunken “don’t tell HR about this” mode. With the E6 travel plaza falling two miles behind every minute, I could comfortably think about my next move. I’d drive back to the company party and talk to the C-suite guy. What the heck did Kevin say to him earlier, before he pretended to steal his keys?

I’m embarrassed to say that the first time I passed the E6 again, it didn’t register that something was wrong. “Oh look,” I thought absently. “Another E6 travel plaza. They’re popping up all over the place.”

I burned south for another five minutes. Another yellow E6 Travel Plaza sign came into view. This time, my spider sense started to tingle, as they say. I slowed down as I drove past. The lights were on, but the parking lot was empty. Almost empty – one vehicle was parked by the pumps: an 18-wheeler with a *Castle Trucking* logo painted on the side of the trailer.

I accelerated back to Italian race-car-driver speeds, mistakenly thinking I could out-drive the situation I was in. All this did was reduce the time until I passed the E6 again. And again. And again.

*Now* I was scared. Why was I scared now and not when I figured out that Kevin tricked me into his car? Why didn’t I panic when Castle tried to ram us with his magical truck? Why didn’t I experience crippling terror during Kevin and Castle’s strange standoff in the travel mart? I don’t know. It takes me a while to get with the program sometimes. But by the seventh or eighth time the E6 flew past on the opposite side of the road, I was crying tears of terror.

“Get me out of here!” I screamed at nobody.

AC/DC blasted out of the speakers:

*I'm on the highway to hell*

*Highway to hell*

I pounded on the stereo controls and eventually got the music to stop. Now I was alone with the scream of the engine. The E6 sign came into view again, peeking over the trees a half-mile ahead. I slammed on the brakes and came to a stop in the middle of the lonely highway.

I stayed in the road for twenty minutes, listening to the wipers squeak away the drizzle. I desperately scanned the road ahead and behind for signs of other cars. There were none.

I screamed and repeatedly punched the top of the dashboard. I accidentally hit the rearview mirror, rotating it so it reflected my lap instead of the rear window. I stopped punching the car and took a few breaths to regain some form of composure. Then I grasped the mirror and turned to fix the alignment. As I turned it from my lap to the window, I saw the same eight-face version of myself that I saw when I climbed into the car in the hotel parking lot. Eight faces – eight copies of *my* face – were gruesomely arranged on my head, simultaneously laughing, crying, screaming, glaring, and shouting.

I put my hands over my eyes and waited for my heartbeat to slow. With my eyes still closed, I reached out with shaking hands and found the mirror. I rotated it all the way to the right, so there would be no way I could see myself in it. Then I cried for a little while.

“I shouldn’t have gotten in the car,” I told myself out loud. The space-loop-truck-attack-Castle-weirdness-eight-face-jump-scare thing wouldn’t be happening if I had just managed to avoid making another bad friggin’ decision. If I didn’t get into the car with Kevin. Just *one* moment of wisdom - Is it too much to ask my brain to give me that?

*I can’t just sit here in the road forever*, I thought.

I put the car in drive and rolled ahead slowly. At thirty miles an hour, I perceived things that I missed when I was speeding: A graffiti tag on a speed limit sign. A dent in the guard rail where a vehicle had drifted into it. A hubcap propped up against a tree. Then – a side road.

The side road was unpaved. Just a narrow country lane that ran into the highway at a right angle. I cautiously turned onto the road, then stopped. My headlights barely cut through the gloom. Even with the high-beams on, I could only see a hundred feet or so before the road vanished into a tunnel-like canopy of trees.

At that point, anything was better than driving past the E6 again. I made a decision and hoped, for once, it would turn out to be a good one. I took my foot off the brake and slowly rolled into the darkness.
