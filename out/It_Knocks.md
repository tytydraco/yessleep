 Hello, I’m Thomas White but everyone calls me “Tom” . Before I say anything I should tell you a bit about myself. I’m a healthcare worker, so you can say I see odd things daily, so a few odd things shouldn’t bother me much. So, when I first worked the night shift at the hospital I thought “This wouldn’t be that different from the day shift” You wouldn’t believe how much I would regret thinking that later. Of course, I hear all of the ghost stories about the night shift, and most stories on Reddit as well.

  
Ok, with all that background about me out of the way I think it is about time I tell you about what happened to me that night.  This happened during the winter of 2000 in the hospital where I was working at the time. The hospital staff all knew what was happening but said nothing, and now that I’m older I understand why they said nothing because I would have said nothing if I was in their shoes as well. The first night working that shift passed like any other shifts I’ve worked before gossiping here gossip there staff talking about rumors concerning the doctors working there and stuff like that. The second, third, and fourth nights were all the same as the first, but on the fifth night, I was in the RT room writing my reports for the patients I was given that night. Usually, the RT room door is shut but this night I kept the door open to circulate the air in the room. 

  
While I was writing my report I was talking to the nurse because I was getting bored of writing and needed a break. While we were talking, the call bell for one of the patients' rooms went off and he had to leave to check on the patient, so I waited for a bit until he came back. It was about two minutes. While he was gone, one of the other patients, a kid no younger than ten popped his head from the side of the door, and asked if I could get him some water. That kid scared the hell out of me because I wasn't expecting him to pop out like that, but after a second I was like sure kid the water machine was only a few rooms down from mine. When I got the water the kid thanked me and said “ Mister why do you keep talking to that chair over there?” When he said that I told him that I was talking to the nurse. Then this kid just said “Are you blind mister no one has been there since this morning” and pointed at the Nurse's station in the south hall  The RT room is in the North Hall  All the nurses are over there mister.” This MOFO just told me I was talking to a F\*$king ghost. After that, I just closed my door and finished my reports. 

  
The rest of the night I was too tired to be dealing with that kind of stuff. The next night I went to the nurse's station to ask if anyone had worked at the north station the other day, and of course, nobody was working on my side of the hospital that night. Then I asked about the kid I was talking to last night as well, and the nurse said that he went home that morning. I was so happy because not only did the kid get better I wasn't talking to two different ghosts so I was happy I didn't get tricked twice. The rest of the night went okay just had a lot of meds to give to the patients that all that happened that night. A few days passed then it happened again. I had my door open because it got stuffy in the room, and then someone started talking to me so this time I looked at the mirror that I could see from the RT room that was on the ceiling. 

  
What I saw was not a nurse, it wasn't even a person. It looked like a person but something was off. I couldn't tell what it was, I just knew it wasn't a person. I just stared at the mirror on the ceiling outside of the RT room looking at it. I wouldn't respond to any of its questions. At some point, it looked up at the mirror too and we were staring at each other. This lasted for what felt like half an hour. Then it spoke while staring at me “Can you see what I am?” I answered “I…I don't know.” Then it got up and walked out of the mirror's reflection. I couldn't see it anymore, but it started tapping on the wall as it got closer to me. “Tip Tap Tip Tap Tip Tap” Then it stopped. I couldn't see it or hear it anymore but I knew it was just next to my door and it asked one more question “ Do you want to see what I am?” I was too scared to speak. After a few minutes it asked again “ DO YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT I AM?” I couldn't speak or move.  I just waited. I could feel it waiting for me to answer, then I heard walking it was different, no tapping , just footsteps coming closer to my room then one of the older nurses from the other station popped into my room asking if I could look at one of the patients. I just got up and went to look at the patient the nurse asked me to look at. 

  
When I was done I told the nurse what had happened and she just looked at me. She went to her desk at the nurse's station gesturing for me to follow her. When she sat down she let out a big sigh and said “ Honey, I know what you saw just know that you were lucky you didn't answer its last question, because yes or no it would have taken you. The nurses and older staff know about The Knocker that's what we call it here because when it moves around it knocks on the walls. Whenever it comes close all the night workers here know to just take a small break and look down and not answer any questions because we all know if you hear Knocking or Tapping never answer a question.” I asked why didn't anyone tell me about this. all she said was “Honey, would you believe us if we said anything?” I just stayed quiet then she said “ Keep your door closed from now on honey it can't open doors but it will knock on your door until you open it. Just know wherever you are needed we will call you on the phone.” All I said was “OK” I have worked here for fifteen years now. That nurse has long since retired, and I still hear it walking by my room now and then. Many RNs and RTs have come and gone, but everyone in the hospital knows they answer its questions.

  
Well, this is what I wanted to tell you guys whether you believe me or not I don't care just know if you ever work in a hospital at night and you hear tapping or something knocking on the wall coming your way just know look down and don't answers any question from a voice you don't recognize on your first night.
