I shouldn’t have gone out tonight. 

It’s an unbearably hot summer night; the kind of heat that makes your eyelids sweat and makes your ears feel like they’re burning. Alexis and I are sitting on the beach, right where the water meets the sand. 
“How long are we going to sit here?” I ask. 
“I don’t know. It just seems like the right thing to do- paying our respects, you know?”
I nod. 

Alexis is a talented swimmer. She used to be the captain of the swim team when we were in highschool, and by the time she went to college, she had a full ride- I didn’t realize college swim teams were that lucrative. I always swore she would end up in the olympics. 
I rest my head on her shoulder, staring out at the water in front of us. 

“What do you think Cassidy would do if she were here?”
I turn to look at Alexis. I don’t know how to answer. “Well… I think she would be looking for seashells. She always found beauty in little things like that.”
“Yeah” she sighs. 

Cassidy moved here when we were in middle school. The three of us quickly became close, and had been like family to each other ever since. Cassidy didn’t go to college, and neither did I. I’ve always felt like Alexis judged us for it. 

“Remember the matching bracelets she made us in like, seventh grade?” Alexis chuckles. 
“You mean the lopsided purple and brown ones?” I smile, “they were so ugly.”
“I know- they were horrible” she laughs. “I still wear it.”
I hold up my wrist- I’m wearing mine too. 

Alexis is home for the summer, and Cassidy and I were so excited to see her. She was always the wild one out of the three of us- always dragging us to parties or sneaking one of her dad’s beers at sleepovers. It’s nice to finally have her back home. 

Since it was her first day back, Alexis had driven us to the party of some guy she used to date. The three of us were drinking and doing shots by the pool when Alexis and Cassidy began to bicker. 
“So, how’s college been going?” Cassidy asked, lowering into the water and propping herself up on the side of the pool with her elbows. 
“It’s been fun I guess. I miss you guys though- it’s weird being away for so long.”
“It must not be that weird,” Cassidy threw back another shot. “I mean, I haven’t heard from you in months. Not a phone call, not a text-“
“Cass, you know I didn’t mean to ignore you or anything. I’ve just been busy.” Alexis kicked her legs in the water, sending ripples out in front of her. 
“I’m sure you have been busy. You probably have your tongue too far down some random guy’s throat to have time to call me back.”
“Are we seriously doing this right now?” Alexis said, slurring her words and setting her cup down. She was so clearly wasted. 

She was wasted, right?

“I’m not trying to start anything. I’m just saying-“
“Cass,” I cut her off, “Let it go”.
Alexis took this as an invitation to continue the argument. “I mean, maybe if you didn’t get knocked up straight out of high school, you’d understand what it’s like on campus.”
“At least I can function without Oxy- but I’m sure that’s not the only thing you’ve been swallowing.”
Alexis had a look in her eyes I had never seen before. 

I wasn’t sure if it was the anger or the alcohol- probably both, but she slapped Cassidy. Cassidy reached up and pulled on Alexis’s nose ring as hard as she could, tearing the cartilage and ripping it out. 
I should have stopped them. 

Why didn’t I stop them?

Alexis grabbed Cassidy by the hair and forced her head underwater. Cassidy thrashed and kicked as Alexis held her down, her nose dripping drops of blood into the water. I screamed at her to stop, but she was armed with the strength of drunken aggression. I pushed Alexis, hit her, yelled- anything I could do to break up the fight. 
But it was no use. 

I don’t think she knew what she was doing. I don’t think she meant for this all to happen- she didn’t understand what she was doing. 

Cassidy’s thrashing slowed to a stop, and there was no longer air bubbling to the surface. 
Her eyes didn’t close, and her lips were slightly parted.
I looked at Alexis in shock, in horror- I didn’t know what to do, how to feel- I just stood there dumbfounded. I all i could do was look around at the other people in the party, drunk and falling over themselves. Laughter echoed and shots flowed, glasses clinked and I could hear the splash of the water hitting thee arm concrete by the pool. It all sounded distant, like I was in another room, hearing it through layers of drywall and plaster. I thought to myself how we’d explain this to anyone who saw- I’d pretend she’s just drunk and we are helping her home, or blame the whole thing on Alexis- but it didn’t seem like anyone even noticed. 

I never really could tell if that was a good thing or not. 

Alexis threw back a few more shots and grabbed Cassidy’s floating arms. “Go wait in the car.” She didn’t look up at me. I didn’t look at her. I just stared at Cassidy, limp and lifeless in the water. 

I don’t exactly know what Alexis did. All I know is that, eventually, she opened the trunk of the car and placed something heavy into it. I felt the weight being dropped into the car- I wondered what Cassidy would’ve done if I were the one Alexis was putting in the trunk. 

I stared forward, gripping the steering wheel. Alexis got in the passenger seat, nose still bleeding. “Take us to the beach.” She looked hollow- as if she was translucent, as if I could almost see through her and watch her heart pump or her lungs expand.  We drove in silence. I watched from the car as she tied a few trash bags to the heaviest rocks she could find and swam them out to the drop off. 

She always was a strong swimmer. 

When she came back, we sat on the sand, where the waves lapped over our legs, and stared into the horizon. 

“How long are we going to sit here?” I asked. 
I shouldn’t have gone out tonight.
