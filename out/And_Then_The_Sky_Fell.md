One fateful day, I turned on my computer to check on the news of the day. To my horror, every news website showed a video of a horde of metallic spaceships darkening the Earth's blue sky. The alien force arrived unannounced, their intentions veiled in their eerie silence. Earth was left to wonder as efforts to communicate with the invaders went unanswered.

Days went by without any action from the visitors. The world's governments tried in vain to contact the aliens. Then, one day without warning, the alien ships fired a high energy weapon at Earth’s cities, laying them to waste.

The world's armies united, deciding that the only way to vanquish the aliens was to work together, firing a series of missiles at the invaders, only to witness them dissolve mid-air, leaving no trace of their existence. The world then attacked with fighter jets, only to have them find the same fate as the missiles. The invaders retaliated, releasing a beam of light that turned everything it touched to dust. Panic ensued, chaos reigned, and the once-bustling Earth fell into an eerie silence, succumbing to defeat.

As humanity's end neared, the alien ships concentrated their firepower on the Earth's moon. The moon began to break up, and the pieces plummeted toward the Earth. The sky, once a symbol of infinity and hope, was filled with falling fragments of the moon. People watched in horror, their hearts sinking with every impact on the Earth's surface. The sky that was once full of stars and dreams was now a menacing entity, falling upon them. Their last sight was of the descending fragments.

I huddled with my family in a makeshift shelter, looking up at the falling moon. My eyes, wide with fear, mirrored the terror of the entire human race. I felt a single tear rolling down my cheek as my wife whispered, “Why?" I could only offer a silent embrace.

In the final moments, a strange tranquility settled over the Earth. The chaos had subsided, replaced by an unnatural stillness. The only sound was the relentless descent of the moon's fragments. As the first piece struck the Earth, a blinding flash of light illuminated the darkening sky. The world was plunged into eternal darkness.

Yet, as the darkness enveloped the Earth, a strange sensation washed over me. A sense of peace and acceptance. It was as if the universe itself was offering solace, a final, silent embrace. In the quiet of the moment, I closed my eyes, and for the first time in days, I felt a sense of calm as the moon fragments continued to plunge into the Earth.

What was left of humanity did its best to survive without the amenities of modern life. The Earth was decimated. What had been a planet full of life was now a barren wasteland. The sky was a perpetual gray, covered with smoke and debris.

The final chapter of human history started with humanity's last words, “And then, the sky fell."
