This was a while ago, but I thought I would still share bc it’s something that still freaks me out to this day. I was maybe 12-13 at the time. I remember it being pretty dark so it must of been pretty late given it was the summer & it doesn’t get dark dark till around 9-10pm. I was sitting on a picnic table in the backyard of my neighbors house w/ the kid who lived there, we will call him Ryan. The backyard was conjoined w/ the other neighboring houses so it was a pretty big, & most of it would get pretty dark but not completely given the light from the moon. The only other alternative light we had came from the porch light on Ryan’s house, which wasn’t a lot at all, just enough so we could see from where we were to his house. 

Anyways, we were sitting on his picnic table just talking, & I notice he looks behind me towards the rest of the backyard, I instantly get chills. He says something along the lines of, “what is that?” I thought maybe he would be talking about an animal of some sort, but I was very wrong. I look behind me & in the darkness of the backyard we see a humanoid figure standing behind us about 15-20 feet back. It was huge & completely pitch black. It stood about 6ft tall, was wide in the shoulders, & we couldn’t make out any clothing, facial features, nothing. Just a giant silhouette of what seemed to be a person. Ryan goes, “you see that too right.?” I nod.

We start calling out to it like “hey who are you?” & “what are you doing back here?” And got no answer. We got up and tried to use our phone flashlights to see if we could get a better look at who or what this was w/o moving any closer. (Thinking about his now that I’m so stupid that I didn’t take a picture!) Which freaked us out even more bc if this was someone, why aren’t they answering us? Even though it was dark it wasn’t dark enough to at least be able to make out clothing & facial features so why can’t we see them? 

Then it started moving towards us, slowly. That’s when we bolted. We ran to my house next door & went right inside. Trying to collect our thoughts about what we just saw, that maybe we were overreacting, maybe it was someone playing a prank? but we had never seen anything like that before. After about 10-15 minutes we go back outside to see if it was still there, this time we went to the front of the houses were the street was bc we could still see the backyard from the sidewalk, and to put some distance between us & whatever that was. Of course, it was still there. We were officially freaked tf out. We again tried calling out to see if we could get answer. Things like, “haha ok pranks over”.. but again, nothing. We decided that was enough of that & we both went inside terrified. I told my mom about what had happened & all she really said was, “There’s been a lot of dark energy around here lately, maybe it decided to manifest itself.” Oh- Ok Mom. I’m not really sure what I saw that night, all I know now is I can’t look back there after dark.
