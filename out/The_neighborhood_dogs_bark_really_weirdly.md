I’ve been living in the same house since i was a kid, in a calm neighborhood. There’s a lot of pet owning families, including mine, we own a little black cat. 

I always stayed up late watching movies or talking on the phone, never afraid of the late hours or anything.  

It just happens that everyday, at the same time, all the dogs in the street bark. First, they all bark together, then, i can hear the barking getting far away, as if they’re following something passing down the street.

But, obviously there is nothing in the street. If anything happened we would know, because the neighbors here really love a little gossip.

Yesterday, i was almost falling asleep, when i heard the barking start, as always it started 1:30 am. I was so mad that i went to the balcony to see if there was a stupid kid messing with the dogs. 

There was not. 

All i could see was the dogs, inside the gates of the houses. Their eyes, shining red, looking at the street with rage, fear, but the worst, hunger. 

What has happening to those pets? At day, sweet, playful, well-trained dogs. At night nightmare animals. 

But they didn’t seem dangerous, so i knocked if off. I went to school the following day with huge dark circles, my friends and classmates all asking me if i was okay. I said i had a bad case of sleeping late and told them not to worry. 

To be honest, it was hard trying to focus on anything. All i could think was the weird dogs living in my street, and worse, knowing they would bark again in the same time. 

I decided to look for some answers, so i visited a neighbor that lived there longer than i did. 

“The door is open.” She said, as i was preparing myself to knock, trying to sound like a sane person. “Oh the dogs are barking!” I would sound dumb and unserious. 

I entered her house, and she was sitting in a chair, cats all around the house. 

“What bothers you, sweetheart?” She said, in a voice almost motherly. I 
explained what was happening and she started laughing, i felt like i really went nuts. 

“Well, for me dogs themselves are bad omen. But, what you saw interest me.” When she said that, i felt like i would finally get answers. What she said was nothing that explained the situation, she just said that animals see what humans don’t. 

I tried to forget it again, but later that day, around 1:27 pm i knew what would happen and it scared me. 

When it started i rushed to the balcony, and watched the dogs barking like crazy again. But, this time, one of them noticed i was there. It looked at me right in the eye and barked, louder than i ever heard. 

As soon as this happened, all of them looked up. The barking, that not long ago was directed at nothing, was directed at me. 

I have no idea of what to do,  i just entered my house and tried to sleep. 

Am i in danger?
