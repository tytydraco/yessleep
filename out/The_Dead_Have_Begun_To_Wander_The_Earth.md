I was holding off on this for a while but I can’t do that anymore. I feel like everyone is doing all they can to get us through this, and while I can’t cook or forage for fix stuff, I can write. At least I think I can. I’m posting to this subreddit in hopes that it reaches someone, and if our experience helps you, then it’ll all be worth it. It's still crazy to me that the internet hasn’t gone down yet. I’m sure you know, but in case you don’t, about a month ago the dead rose from their graves. It’s just as crazy as it sounds, one day they just clawed their way out of the ground and started shambling around. I was camping with a group of friends at the time, but I remember seeing the news online. They moved through towns in mobs, tearing through every living thing. It happened so fast that the news probably knew more about what was going on then the authorities did, otherwise they might have stopped all this sooner. Every town, every city they tore through, they left a desolate ghost town after they were done. I don’t know what fueled their hate and hunger, but they’d risen with the goal of snuffing us all out. Did they want us to join them? Did they see it as a mercy? These questions keep me awake at night more than the threat of an attack does, but sorry, I’m getting carried away. The broadcasts went down after the first week, along with any word on what was going on. I’d gotten calls from my family, telling me that they were okay and that they were going to stay put, apparently that's what the police told everyone. I wanted to go back home, but my friends didn’t agree. The circumstances of our situation showed everyone's true colours, and because of this, I decided to leave without saying anything. It wasn’t a short trip without a car, I can’t believe I walked for days.

Most rest stops I found were either abandoned or sealed shut, barricaded from the inside to prevent anything from getting in. Regardless, I didn’t have a whole heap of luck trying to find help either way. By some stretch of a miracle, I arrived home in just three days, but I was already too late. Like I’m sure many of you have experienced, my family was taken from me. I won’t go into the details that fill my mind when it’s too quiet, or the scenario that plays in my most painful nightmares. They were gone, in the most finite sense of the word. The dead had already come through and destroyed my home. Knowing what I know now, I wouldn't have lingered for as long as I did, but Vancouver was where I grew up, and I couldn’t leave it without knowing I searched everywhere for any survivors. Ultimately, my search was in vain. What else could I do then, but take to the road? This city was gone, the people were gone, my family was gone, and I was too late to fight for any of it. Not like I would’ve been of any use in a fight anyway. There was nothing here for me anymore, so I left it all behind. I should have taken a car, but I’d come here on foot and I foolishly thought I could leave on it too. It only took two miles before I realised how stupid I’d been, but by that point, I’d met Travis. He was parked outside a gas station filling up jerry cans and putting them in the back of his van, or at least I thought it was his van at the time. I was hesitant to talk to him, but he was the first person I’d seen in weeks. I approached him slowly, which didn’t stop him from jumping when he saw me. When we both calmed down he explained to me that he was a trucker, and that he’d been on the road when it happened.

He’d ruined his truck mowing down a whole horde of them, and wanted something smaller and faster to move around in. I helped him load the rest of the gas into the van while I listened to his story. It felt nice hearing someone talk, and all I wanted to do was listen. After he was finished, he asked me where I was headed, and I told him I didn’t know. Then he asked if I’d heard anything about military outposts.

“No.” I replied. “I haven’t heard anything about the military.”

He rubbed his chin. “Well they gotta have something set up, doubt they’re just sitting on their asses while the world goes to shit.” He spoke with an almost cartoony southern drawl, a fact I never relayed to him.

His plan honestly didn’t sound horrible, a military outpost made sense, in a world where the corpses crawling out of the earth also made ‘sense.’ All this to say, it was a solid plan, and at the time it seemed like the perfect plan to me. The only place I’d thought to go to was gone, a gust of death had blown through my home, and now I wanted to get as far away from it as possible.

Travis kept talking about Seattle, about how: “If they’re set up anywhere, it’s gotta be there.”

I don’t know why he was so adamant on heading there next but it was better than my plan, or lack thereof. I helped him load up the van with as much food and bottled water as we could carry from the gas station, which admittedly felt a little bit like stealing. If any cops see this, just know that the whole place was completely empty, I checked everywhere. When Travis decided that we’d taken enough, he took a spray can of paint and started to leave a message on the windows. He got about halfway before the paint in the can ran out, and he threw it away, only to reach into the driver's side of the van and pull out another can.

When completed, the message read: SUPPLIES INSIDE in thick bold letters. He nodded at me as I told him I wanted to go with him, and we left only a few seconds later. We were on the road for maybe twenty minutes before we saw our first body. Slumped over the hood of a car, its back torn open and its insides spilling out. I instinctively shut my eyes as the car lights lit up this awful display of violence.

Travis didn’t say a thing as we passed it, but plainly said: “It’s gone.” When we were down the road.

Afterwards I pulled my laptop from my things, and started writing this, primarily to take my mind off things. I liked writing, I’ve done it all my life. I’m not particularly good at it, and I haven’t published anything, but I always find that it's a great way to get my feelings out. And I realise now that with the world in the state that it's in, I might never get the chance to write again. So I’m going to take every chance I can get. Hopefully I can find some help, maybe I can find someone who knows what's going on. I’ve noticed that my connection is spotty in some areas, so I’ll try to upload when I can. Travis hasn’t really said anything about me typing away in the passenger seat, he’s just given me some side glances every now and then, but we honestly haven’t spoken all that much since we left. I don’t mind the silence, but it’s starting to make my eyelids grow heavier with each passing second. I hope he won’t mind if I take a few minutes to sleep, I feel exhausted.


I honestly don’t remember falling asleep, I just remember waking up when the seatbeat dug into my neck. My body was flung forward in an instant, just stopping short of the dashboard. As my brain began to wake up, my eyes locked on to the scene before us. The headlights illuminated the four figures, I must’ve been asleep for at least a little while, because it was much darker then I remember. They all stood in the middle of the road, and their stance was shaky. It was as if their frames could barely support them, they looked as if they’d fall apart any second. The one closest to us took a step forward, uncoordinated and clumsy. Like a puppet having its strings lazily commanded, they all advanced slowly. We might’ve been stationary for three or four seconds, but to me it felt like minutes. I started at the closest figure with morbid curiosity, and it stared back. An abomination of biology stood before me, a shambling corpse that should’ve fallen apart any second. Flesh hugged its skeletal structure tightly, like grey and rotting leather. Chunks of its skull and chest were missing, revealing the barely functioning organs inside. Sockets that should have been home to an iris and pupil instead bared two milky white marbles, almost an indication that any semblance of humanity it once harboured was gone now. Tattered fabric hung loosely and sparingly on its body, revealing too much of its bare ribcage and leg muscles, constricting with every step.

Looking at it clearly, there was no room for doubt. One word raced through my mind, a word that described it perfectly: zombie. It felt insensitive, zombies were monsters you’d see in a movie or kill in a video game. They weren’t real and they didn’t exist, and yet here it was, a perfect example of the word. Fiction merged with reality to create this terrifying creature, this monstrosity before us. This thing, that had pulled itself into our world and destroyed our society in less than a week. I could hardly process it at the time, but Travis had slammed on the breaks and was quickly backing up. As we raced in reverse I heard a number of curses fly out of his mouth as our supplies flung themselves around in the back. He spun the whole vehicle around and now we were going the way we’d just come. It took a few minutes for my adrenaline fueled panic to die down, and when it did I asked the first thing that came to mind. 

“What happened?” My mouth was dry.

Travis just shook his head. “Damn things came out of nowhere. I just, turned a corner and there they were.”

He drove like a man possessed. His eyes were glued to the road, and his fingers clutched the wheel tight in white hot fury. I waited a few more minutes before I asked my next question.

“Couldn’t we just, like, run them over?”

He laughed at this. “You don’t want to do that, I’ve seen what those suckers can do to a truck. I don’t even wanna think about what they’d do to a tin can like this.”

I just nodded and left it at that. “So… What do we do now? We’re still headed to Seattle?”

He scoffed. “Of course we are, nothing's changed.”

I nodded. “Right, but we're heading the wrong way.”

His eyes remained on the road. “I know that, just looking for a turn off, if we can’t take the main roads, we’ll take a detour.”

We must have spent a good half an hour driving back before his eyes lit up.

“There we go.” He muttered to himself before weaving through a graveyard of abandoned cars.

We’d driven right past them on our way out, but now he was carefully trying to navigate through them in order to take a dirt road that went straight through some trees. The road was significantly more bumpy, and we were going so fast that every pothole we hit almost made me fly out of my seat.

When I asked Travis why he was doing seventy, he just kept saying that we were “Losing time.”

I won’t say that his driving was beginning to scare me more than the four corpses we just saw, but it was coming pretty close. As our drive continued, I noticed that at one point he began to slow down. When we were going half the speed we were before, he cocked his head, as if he was listening for something. I briefly glanced at him before pretending to do something on my laptop, then he slowed down to a crawl. At first, I thought we were running out of gas, which made me eye the five jerrycans we had in the back.

But then he asked me a question. “You hear that?”

I cocked my head too. “Hear what?”

His eyes narrowed. “That… Sound… Kind of like…” He slowed to a stop.

I kept my ears perked, but I honestly hadn’t heard anything. He opened the door and began to walk around the van. I stayed put, briefly looking out the window to see if everything was alright. When I turned my attention back to my laptop, he appeared out of nowhere and tapped the window. I yelled and swore that he almost gave me a heart attack. He just looked unimpressed and made a motion which said ‘Wind the window down.’ I did just that.

“You scared the hell out of me.” I rested my hand on my chest.

“Flat tire.” He replied plainly.

“O-Oh. How bad is it?”

He scratched his cheek. “Not good.”

“Do we, I mean, we don't have a spare tire, do we?” I asked while looking in the back.

“No.” He didn’t even look. “No we don’t.”

He crossed his arms. “I’m gonna have to go looking for one.”

I turned to him. “Looking for tires? What do you mean?”

He walked over to the side of the van and opened the door. “I saw a couple of vans back on the road, I’ll probably find a replacement there.”

I was almost silenced by his nonchalance. “Alright, how long do you think this will take?”

I began to slowly get out of the van, while he started pulling things out of the back.

“Stay with the vehicle." He said as he turned his flashlight on. “I’ll only be a minute.”

I was not going to stay here by myself. “Sure you don’t need any help?”

He now had a tirejack and lugwrench tucked under his shoulder. “Nope.”

And then he walked away, he just left without saying anything else. I told myself I wasn’t going to stay here, but that seemed futile now. Instead I decided to get back into the van and keep myself busy by typing this up. Although, now that I write this, I think I might move into the back. You know that feeling you get when someone's watching you? When the hairs stand up on the back of your neck? I’ve been feeling that for a while now. I hope I’m being paranoid. Hopefully I can just turn all the lights off and try to get some sleep before Travis comes back, it feels like this night is going on forever.


I can hear a voice outside. I thought it was just in my dreams, but it eventually got loud enough that it woke me up. I initially thought it might be Travis, so I started to move into the front. But before I could turn the inside light on I heard again, only much further away. It didn’t sound like a voice at first, it almost sounded like music, like a looping tune that had been cut out of a song, repeated constantly in the same cadence. I was dreary, having just come out of my sleepless slumber, so I sat in the dark for a while before realisation began to creep in. The noise wasn’t coming from directly outside the van, or anywhere close for that matter. It sounded like it was originating from the treeline. I couldn’t see anything through the darkness I sat in, and I couldn’t quite make out what the noise was either. The possibilities ran through my mind, was it an animal? A person? Someone who needed help? We had plenty of supplies in the back, food, water, spare clothes. Although they were all Travis's size and not mine. But as the silence became deafening, the words became clearer and I properly heard them for the first time. To the best of my recollection, the voice was male or at the very least sounded like it.

All it was doing was repeating the same thing over and over: “Come out to, play!”

The last word had an inflection in it, which was consistent with every repeated shout. The feeling hit me hard, I felt it in my stomach, like an icy knife sinking into my gut. Fear. Pure fear. When I was eight years old I remember hiking with my Step dad. It was the first time we ever did anything together, just the two of us. When he retold the same story years later, he admitted to me that the whole trip was his attempt at a bonding experience, but that's neither here nor there.

Because the only thing I remember perfectly from that trip was when a huge snake reeled its head at me in the middle of the path. It was the first time I was ever frozen stiff by fear, my joints locked in place and my breath hitched in my throat. I never thought I’d feel that same feeling again, yet here I was, my head locked forward as my ears were assaulted by that same chilling phrase, over and over again. There was barely a lull between shouts as each sentence came out only a few seconds after the other. I tried not to panic, to calm myself down, but my breaths refused to leave my lungs, and all I could do was inhale sharply every few seconds. I refused to move, even after I regained control of my motor functions, feeling that even a single movement or breath would draw attention to me. For far too long I remained completely still, as if trying to blend into the seat and become invisible. I kept telling myself that Travis would be back any second now, but the fear made every second an eternity. I could’ve been sitting there for six minutes, or six hours, either way I’d had enough. Like ripping off a band aid, I forced myself to confront whatever was outside. My body felt like it moved in slow motion, my neck taking forever to turn my eyes onto the treeline. By now, I could just barely make out the moonlit surroundings. The treeline was only about ten or eleven feet from the van, but I still couldn’t see anything. I wasn’t sure what to expect, but being met with absolutely nothing didn’t do much to ease my dread. My eyes wandered, not exactly sure what to look out for. From what I remember, I was only looking for about twenty seconds or so, not even half a minute.

I was so on edge that by the time I realised the shouting had stopped it was already too late. All the tension, fear and dread I’d built up finally came crashing into me all at once in the visage of a figure moving out of the shadow and towards me. I barely caught a glimpse of it before the passenger side window exploded in a shower of glass that cut up my face, and later my arms as I raised them defensively. I admit, I screamed louder than I ever have, and desperately tried to climb into the back, away from my attacker. I half scrambled, half threw myself directly into a pile of Lays chips and canned food, only destroying the chip packets. The pitch black made grabbing something to defend myself impossible and I resigned myself to my fate far too quickly. Instead I raised my arms above my head in a feeble attempt to protect myself, hoping, no, praying that my attacker would just go away. The panic coursing through my body made all reason leave my mind as I remained curled up in a ball on the ground, crying and shaking, waiting for everything to just go away. The sound of the side door attempting to be opened sent another spike of fear shooting through my body, and the loud single bang made me jump.

“Kid, open up.” Travis. It was Travis.

Before I could wipe the tears away from my face, I was already moving. I came face to face with him, although my face was red and puffy. For the first time I’d seen Travis with an awkward expression.

“Whats, uh. Are you crying?” He had a tire tucked under his arm.

I told him everything, it all came out in a rushed recollection, one that he needed repeated in order to actually understand what I was saying. After hearing my story for the second time, he looked over at the passenger window, then back at me.

He just put the tire down, pulled out a spare shirt, and started cleaning all the glass off the seat. We didn’t talk about what happened after that. He changed the tire, and we were back on the road like nothing had ever happened. I’m almost entirely sure that he doesn’t believe me, probably thinks that I was messing around and cooked up the whole scary figure story as an excuse for the window. I mean, to be fair, I don’t know what he thinks. But I know what I saw, and I know what I heard. I can’t help but wonder what would’ve happened if I stepped out of the Van tonight, if I called back. Who or what the hell was out there? And why make so much noise with those things wandering around? It was a miracle that none of them showed up after such a loud display. There's still so much we don’t know about these walking corpses though, can they talk? The few I've seen haven’t, they don’t make any noise really. But that doesn’t mean they can’t. Sitting here in silence with these thoughts racing through my head, it’s like torture. Hopefully one day I’ll forget about what happened tonight and I’ll forget about the corpses, unfortunately, that time doesn’t seem to be soon. I think I need to end my story here. The battery on my laptop is starting to get low, and if I can’t figure out a way to charge it these car rides might become unbearable. Travis tells me that Seattle is just a ways down the road, and that I’ll be able to see it when the sun rises in half an hour. Hopefully my next update will be within a safe hotel with running water and heat. But until then, please stay safe.
