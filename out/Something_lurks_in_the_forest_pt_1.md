The forest behind my house, has always been.... strange. Ever since I moved here, I always have refused to go in the forest alone. It always feels like im being watched, not by a person... but the forest itself. I know, it sounds crazy writing it here... but now I know the truth.

My parents went out of town about a day ago. My dad had a confrence to go to for work, and my mom decided to tag along. I'm now 17 years old, so they knew I could handle myself for the next week. Anyways one of my good friends Jaiden decided to come over, for the weekend.  We were playing video games for a few hours, and we eventually got bored. Jaiden suggested we explore the forest behind my house, like a ghost hunting thing. I thought that would be fun, so I agreed.

It was now about 9:30 at night during the height of winter, so we grabbed jackets, boots, flashlights, and gloves. After hearing up, I went over to my dad's office and grabbed two radios. My dad owns a construction company so he always has cool stuff in his office. 

As we ventured out into the forest, I got a dreadful feeling, that maybe we shouldn't be exploring this forest at night. I shrugged it off as the forest just being creepy and we slowly got deep into the forest. 

After about 20 to 30 minutes I decided to suggest to Jaiden we should maybe go back. I think he got the feeling I did earlier, because he agreed. As we were turning around, Jaiden called out to me. I turned around, and saw what he found. It was a small cave entrance, and he said we should explore it. I protested, but he didn't listen to me. Regretfully, I followed him.

I tried to keep up with Jaiden but he moved to fast. Eventually I got lost and started to call out to him. Then, out of noowhere Jaiden appeared. He explained he found a lady unconscious when he was exploring and we needed to get her out and contact the authority's. Immediatly I agreed, and I followed him to the lady that needed help.

When we got to the location, he was confused. I asked him what was wrong, and he explained that she was gone. I immedatly was weirded out, and told him we should go. He was still staring, at the corner and I decided to pull him towards me and then immediatly it looked like he snapped out of a trance. He agreed to leave with me, and we started to make our way out. I was getting a bit spooked and it looked like he was too, something was wrong. Really wrong.

As we exited the cave, I turned around. Jaiden was gone. My phone buzzed, and it was a text... from Jaiden. He said he was sorry he was late, and that he would be at my house soon. My blood ran ice cold and as I let the text sink in my mind, I heard a scream come from the cave. A tall, smiling humanoid creauture running on all 4 limbs exited the cave running at me. 

I ran, my heart was racing I was scared shitless. As I ran, I heard it behind me, it caught up to me for a second and slashed at my legs. It hit my left leg and I yelped out in pain. As I fell over, I realized there was a cliff ahead. Out of options, I got up and limped over to the cliff. Without thinking I jumped and fell into a body of water.
