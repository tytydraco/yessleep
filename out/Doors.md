Ravenswood, where I've spent my entire life, is a town that appears idyllic at first glance. Everyone knows each other, and our homes line the main road like sentinels. But beneath its quaint facade, Ravenswood harbors a sinister secret.

It begins at midnight, when the streets are deserted and the only sound is the creaking of trees swaying in the wind. That's when the knocking starts – a slow, deliberate rap on the front door. No one knows who or what is responsible, but one thing is certain: the knocking never occurs at the same house twice.

At first, we thought it was the work of a bored prankster. But as the nights wore on, people began to vanish. Not literally, perhaps, but something was undeniably off about them. They'd become... altered.

Mrs. Jenkins, who lived just three houses down, answered the knock one fateful night. The next morning, she was catatonic, her eyes fixed on some invisible point in space. A week later, Mr. Thompson, our town's mayor, made the same mistake. He began speaking in tongues, babbling about ancient deities and forgotten rituals.

As the knocking continued, paranoia gripped our town. Some residents boarded up their doors, while others installed elaborate security systems. But I knew it was futile. Whatever was responsible for the knocking seemed to be able to bypass our defenses with ease.

I tried to steel myself for the inevitable, but when the knock came, I was caught off guard. It was 2:47 AM, and I was jolted awake by the unmistakable sound. My heart racing, I approached the door, hesitating for a moment before peering through the peephole.

There was no one there. Just the dark, empty street. I breathed a sigh of relief, thinking it was just my imagination playing tricks on me. But then, I heard it again – the knock.

This time, I didn't bother looking through the peephole. I just stood there, frozen, as the knock grew louder, more insistent. I knew that if I answered, I'd be sealing my fate. But the knocking seemed to be seeping into my bones, making my skin crawl.

Suddenly, the knocking stopped. The silence was oppressive, heavy with anticipation. I waited, holding my breath, wondering if it was over. But then, I heard footsteps – light, deliberate footsteps, coming from the other side of the door.

I knew I had to get out. I grabbed my phone and keys and made a run for the back door. I didn't dare look back, fearing what I might see. I just kept running, into the night, into the darkness.

I've been hiding ever since, always staying one step ahead of... whatever it is. But I know it's only a matter of time before it finds me. Before it knocks on my door again.

And when it does, I'll be ready. I'll face whatever horrors lie on the other side of that door, head-on. But until then, I'll keep running, keep hiding, and pray that the knocking hour never comes for me again.
