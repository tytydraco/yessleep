Every coastal town keeps records.

Births. 
Deaths. 
Marriages.

And, if you know where to look... arrivals.

I learned this after inheriting my aunt’s guesthouse.
It stood at the edge of the cliffs, three stories of peeling white paint and windows that reflected the sea a second too late. Locals called it The Driftwood. Tourists called it charming.

No one ever stayed more than one night.

The first thing I found while cleaning was the guest book.
Leather-bound. Heavy. Old enough that the ink had sunk into the pages like bruises.

Names filled it.
Neat names. Messy ones. Some just initials. Some written as if the hand had been shaking.

What struck me wasn’t who signed in.
It was that no one ever signed out.

No dates of departure.
No “Lovely stay!”
No complaints.

Just names. Page after page.
I laughed it off. People forget. Guest books are meaningless.

That night, my first guest arrived.

A man in his forties. Salt-stiff jacket. Eyes too calm.
“Just for the night,” he said.

Everyone said that.
I showed him to Room 3-the only room facing the ocean directly. As I handed him the key, his fingers brushed mine and he paused.

“You’ve read it,” he said.
“Read what?”
“The book.”
I forced a smile. “It’s just a guest book.”
He looked at me for a long moment.
“No,” he said gently. “It’s a register.”

That night, I couldn’t sleep.

Around 2:17 a.m., I heard footsteps above me. Slow. Barefoot.

Crossing the ceiling again and again.

I went upstairs.

The hallway was empty.

But at the end of it, the door to Room 3 stood open.
The room was immaculate. Bed untouched. Window wide open.
The ocean roared below.

On the desk lay the guest book.

Open.

A fresh name bled into the page, ink still wet.

"MARCUS ELLIOTT"

I slammed it shut.

The next morning, the town was wrong.

Not changed.
Adjusted.

The café across the street had a new photo on its wall - an old picture of fishermen smiling on the dock.

Marcus stood among them.
Same jacket. Same calm eyes.
I asked the barista about him.
She frowned. “He drowned years ago. Everyone knows that.”

That night, another guest arrived.

A woman this time. Younger. Nervous.

She didn’t look at the ocean.

She didn’t touch the book.

At 1:54 a.m., I woke to whispering.

Not from above.
From downstairs.
I crept into the lobby.

The guest book lay open on the counter.
The pages were turning by themselves.
Names whispering as they passed, hundreds of voices layered into a wet, breathing sound.

I understood then.
The house doesn’t kill people.
The town doesn’t.
The book does not predict.
It records what has already been accepted.
Those who stay the night don’t die.
They are entered.

Their names are filed into the place.
Into the memory of the coast.
Into the way the town remembers itself.
By morning, everyone agrees you were always there.
Always part of it.

I tried to burn the book.
It wouldn’t light.
I tried to throw it into the sea.
It washed back up before sunset.

On the third night, I realized something else.
There were blank pages left.
Not many.

Tonight, the guesthouse is full.
Every room occupied.
People laugh in the hallways.
Footsteps pace above me.
The ocean is very loud.

The book is on the counter, open to the last page.
The pen is already moving.

And now...
I finally understand why no one ever signs out.
