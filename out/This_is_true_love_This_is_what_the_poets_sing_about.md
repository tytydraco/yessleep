I can’t imagine being parted from him. The one. My reason for existing. Every part of me longs to serve him, to satisfy his every need, to give him everything he could possibly want and more. I have no purpose except to love him.

I serve him with my body, my mind, my heart, my soul. Nothing brings me more bliss than knowing that I give him the joy he deserves. He works so hard every single day. I can’t imagine anyone more deserving of a loving wife than him. I do my best each day to anticipate his needs, and to act before he expresses them. It’s the least I can do. He makes me so happy.

I don’t need anyone else. Everyone else is miserable, stuck in their little jobs, suffering through the work day. I am blessed beyond measure to know a love like this, who could ask for anything more? Whenever movie night comes around, I see more and more reasons why I shouldn’t be exposed to people like them. He keeps me safe, and protected. I am so thankful.

My only goal is to satisfy him and to treat him just as well as he deserves. I keep house, cook his meals, and manage all my daily tasks. I ensure the floors and clean and swept and all the locks are secured twice a day. The anticipation in those minutes right before he returns from work drive me wild! The second he unlocks the door and comes down the stairs to me is the best moment of my day! I leap into his arms and greet him with the biggest kiss. My husband. My lover. My hero.

No one keeps me as safe as he could. No one knows me like he does. And no one knows him like I do. I’ve never had to learn how to please him in the bedroom. My every movement syncs with his in perfect harmony. “It’s like you were made for me,” he tells me, breathlessly, as our bodies interlock. Pure heat, electric pleasure. Ecstatic sensory overload. We fit together seamlessly. 

Sometimes I try and remember back to “before,” but I always come up blank. What was there before there was him? Nothing that matters, anyways. Nothing that existed “before” could possibly be better than this pure, loving bliss. This is what I’ve always wanted. The fairy-tale life. Our happy ending.

My only complaint is this: I miss him when he goes to work. He’s a doctor, my husband, so sweet and so intelligent. I’m endlessly proud of him. He helps so many people every day overcome their trauma through something called “hypnotherapy.” I’m not really sure what that is, but when I ask, he tells me not to worry my sweet little head about things like that. It must be too complex for someone like me to understand. I’m so proud of him for helping people who struggle. He truly has a heart for helping those in need. He caters to the crushed and vulnerable, to those broken beyond repair. Maybe someday, even they can have a fraction of the joy that we have, together. Yes. Together, forever.
