I would like to tell you a story that happened to me when I was a young adult. It is based on a true event that happened to me and two friends and to this day we still don't know exactly what we were dealing with that night. However, I need to back up a little and tell you something that is related to the story so that you can understand the context better:

In order not to reveal the real names of my friends, even though nothing illegal happened, let's just call them Mark and Leon. After all, I'm posting here under a “stage name” and since I value privacy on the internet, that only makes sense. Please understand. So let's begin. Mark and I have known each other since elementary school, or to be more precise, even before first grade. Mark, another friend who has nothing to do with this story, and I met a few days before school started. So the two of them were my first real friends. We live in northern Germany, in a place called Schleswig Holstein near Hamburg. Where we lived exactly will become important, so keep that in mind. And to better explain our school career to readers outside Germany, here is a brief explanation: Elementary school comes after kindergarten. It lasts four years. After that, you go to one of three secondary schools. One of these was the so called „Hauptschule“ where we attended. For American readers: In terms of hierarchy, the Hauptschule is comparable to the high school. Just like it's often portrayed in movies. If you're cool, you get respect. If you're a nerd, you get bullied. We were nerds. Keep that in mind, it will also become important later on.  
  
Well... Mark and I, childish as we were, often fantasized in our free time. We often went to a nearby forest, which was more of a field of trees planted for forestry than a real forest. We looked for sticks that looked like swords and played brave adventurers who slayed evil on a journey to save the world. Kids, you know. This “forest” was also relatively safe for us children, as it was close to a newly built residential area and did not contain any wild animals, since there was hardly any other nature around this area where animals could establish a habitat. At some point, we expanded this game of heroes and adventures. At first, we took inspiration from popular video games and anime series of the time, such as Dragonball and Digimon. We invented our own characters with superpowers and developed stories, letting time pass until the children and grandchildren of our heroes took over, with their own invented superpowers. We simply called it “story.” You could describe it as real-life DnD or even LARP, i.e., live-action role-playing. If you're not familiar with it, LARP is like a medieval festival, except that we didn't dress up and had multiple characters. So we made up and continued the story of good versus evil ourselves. It became so integrated into our everyday lives that we continued it for years, and our own creative lore became more and more profound and complex. It was a good and peaceful time.

After Mark and I finished elementary school, we went to the Hauptschule together and met Leon, who was just as much of a nerd as we were. So we became friends with him and told him from our story. So he contributed his own characters but didn't get involved in the plot. He wasn't very good at coming up with a specific storyline and maintaining a certain balance between the heroes' victories and defeats. Mark and I had started the whole thing, and we both wanted to stay in control without excluding Leon.

Do you remember the school hierarchy I told you about? Well, we were the nerds and since we weren't cool enough to start smoking at 13 in the corner of the playground, we were often laughed at, bullied, and called immature for our story we had. That's why we always went off the beaten track for our story. Sometimes to a clearing in the aforementioned forest area, sometimes to the courtyard of an abandoned building, and sometimes to the end of a road where someone walked their dog every three hours. The latter ended up being our standard location, as we moved around a lot during our shadowfights and a stone floor was ideal for that. So you could say that we got plenty of exercise as children. So that was our life. And it was good the way it was. That's why we never planned to stop. Of course, we knew that we would have to stop at some point, if only because we would grow old. But we were young, fit, and motivated. So it all continued, even after we left school. Leon had even gotten married and had a son. We always told the little boy that his father and his two uncles had to go out and save the world. Anyway.

So we continued our story and with Leon it had been that way for almost 10 years. If I were to write down the entire story we made up back then, I could fill the entire Star Wars series, Lord of the Rings, and Harry Potter. Five times over. Just so you understand how important it was to us, and that nothing, no noises, passersby, or anything else, could stop us from having fun outside. At least until that night. We must have been around 22 or 23 years old at the time. It was autumn, shortly before or after midnight. Maybe even later, I don't remember exactly. So, apart from us and the moonlight, there were no passers-by to disturb us. There weren't any animals anyway. Even if there had been, we would have scared everything away within a 200-meter radius, as we weren't exactly careful to be quiet while we were outside. Every hunter or wildlife photographer knows that even the rustling of a jacket will scare away any animals in the vicinity. And that was a good thing. At least we had some peace and quiet. So we were back at our spot where the road ended. To give you an idea: you follow this road, past a few houses, until it ends in a footpath a good 200 meters further on. On the left is a dog park and on the right is part of the planted forest. We were always at the end of the road and the beginning of the footpath. Far away from prying eyes.

So we continued our story, deeply immersed in the experience, until something happened that still sticks in my mind today, 10 years later, and sends a chill down my spine. A loud, distorted scream rang out from the forest. It was close, very close. As if something was standing right next to us. If I had to describe that scream today, I would say it sounded like a death whistle, the kind the Aztecs used to use. Only not quite as shrill, rather a little deeper, but not so deep that it could have come from a larger animal. We hadn't heard any other noises before that, such as footsteps approaching us. And since we always wanted to be alone and avoid other people, we would have noticed such noises immediately, even if we were in the middle of something. We also didn't hear anything running away from us after this “scream,” such as an animal letting out a warning call and then fleeing. Whether animal or human, this “something” only screamed once, and then there was silence. No running away, not even laughter from those who just want to scare us. After a few seconds in which the three of us froze like stone, we grabbed our water bottles, ran to our cars, and disappeared as fast as we could. For the rest of the time we continued our story, we never returned to that place.

Later, we looked up various animal calls on the internet because we wanted to find out what exactly was lurking in the dark among the trees next to us. Even though there were no animals in the vicinity, we didn't want to rule out the impossible. But none of the animals that could theoretically exist up here in the north, whether deer, badgers, foxes, or even runaway cows, had a call even remotely similar to what we experienced that night. Shit, we even watched videos about creatures like skinwalkers or wenigos and even though I wasn't and am not entirely averse to the supernatural due to several encounters with ghosts, I didn't believe that such creatures really existed. But the absence of the sounds of an animal running toward or away, that single, loud scream and the silence that followed, as well as the fact that there was no other soul there in the middle of the night and we were three grown men who weren't exactly quiet, makes the whole thing even creepier.

Whatever was lurking in the shadows of the trees that night is probably still there today, and to be honest, I don't want to find out. And I still don't want to imagine what would have happened if we hadn't left immediately.
