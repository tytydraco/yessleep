Just a foreword before I get into this.

&#x200B;

Until last year I was not a believer in "manifesting your thoughts", despite this fact I'd regularly buy self-help books on everything from beating and understanding addictions to organising or restructuring my future and mind set even when this included books on manifesting our future through thought.

I've had a while to think about this now and perhaps this journey of improving myself required me to ultimately experience this event to change my opinion on the manifestation of our thoughts.

Anyway,

&#x200B;

The start of this experience begins young for me at my first sleepover at the age of 13, the night went on as I imagined most sleep-overs or slumber parties do at this age, lots of sweets, video games, and conversations beyond our years and no sleep,

eventually, as the night turned to early morning and the conversation dwindled a small suggestion would lead to a thought that still to this day, maybe even more so now, plagues most of my waking thought.

We turned off the lights and sat in a circle passing a single torch to the speaker each time as we recited scary stories and tried to terrify each other as much as possible, one or two excused themselves visibly shaken by twisted stories poorly recited from memory, none of which I can recall today except one.

One story which seemingly followed me from childhood to young adulthood finally manifested itself in reality last December.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to 2022, I'm getting over a breakup that as much as the name suggests broke me and I was seeking help from anyone with confidence in their beliefs which lead me to a discord group of individuals seeking to improve their lives.

I shared my opinions and what information I had parsed from the many books on the subject I had already read and piqued the interest of July, a late 20s nonbinary who was studying to become a psychiatrist.

&#x200B;

We spoke for months gradually moving from conversations of intrigue to deep conversations of past and future, it became obvious to everyone we were moving towards something serious in August of the same year and we made it official just weeks later and within days we were traveling between each other's house to spend the night together, every night.

I felt like a piece of me I had been searching for was found but this was only to last for around 4 months, the relationship was perfect during this time I simply had no complaints, felt heard, and not just appreciated but needed for the first time in a long time.

For some reason a conversation occurred before we had been in a relationship or as far as I was aware we were interested in each other that July had never quite dropped;

We spoke about recurring thoughts, like those you experience late in the deep of night, not wanting to reveal my deepest thoughts I opted to tell them of the scary story that had never left my thoughts from the moment it was spoken.

&#x200B;

This was the moment I manifested the biggest mistake in my life which has altered every aspect of my life since. I no longer discuss desires, thoughts, or feelings with anyone and I am beyond scared to do so.

&#x200B;

I woke up around 3 in the morning; I've never been able to sleep through the night so thought nothing of this but realised July wasn't asleep next to me which I found odd as I would happily, maybe creepily, observe July until I fell asleep again almost every night.

I could hear the sound of the taps running and just assumed they had used the bathroom when they came back into the room and put their cold hands against my chest before they fell asleep again looking incredibly cute and content.

&#x200B;

As I lay there, smiling and observing each pore in July's face one of my cats came into the room and snuggled into me, wet.

&#x200B;

I hadn't heard any rain and in the low light thought that his fur was covered in slick red oil I decided I would bath him, and as I carried him in protest to the bathroom, something felt off, all the hairs on the back of my neck raised,

the recurring thought of the scary story became fixed in my mind but having experienced this feeling many times I shrugged it off, firmly turned off the sink taps then held Kat in the bathtub as I rinsed him off with a jug of water and some cat shampoo.

&#x200B;

I noticed it wasn't washing away and the dripping sound hadn't stopped but had become more consistent;

I pulled out my phone and turned the flashlight on, as I had been relying on the hallway light due to the light in the bathroom being broken, to find the offending drip and work out what was in Kat's fur when it became apparent we were covered in blood.

&#x200B;

My bathroom was covered in blood too and nailed to the ceiling, dripping all over me, was my beautiful ginger cat Mango.

&#x200B;

The story I had heard at this sleepover was a rendition of "The Licked Hand", I confronted July who denied it, and when police investigated they found the back door had been left unlocked and told me it was not proof nor significant evidence when I told them I had lost the key to the back door weeks prior.

&#x200B;

Manifestation is real but sometimes it's not us who makes it happen.
