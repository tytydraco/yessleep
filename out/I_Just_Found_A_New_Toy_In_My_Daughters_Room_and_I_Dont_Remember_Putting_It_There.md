The house was a steal.

Two stories, right in the middle of town. A winding staircase, the kind I always wish I had as a kid. Ample kitchen with brand new appliances and a ceiling in the living room I couldn’t reach even if I jumped with my arms up. It was an old house and it sat right in the middle of an equally old square in a town that was small enough and far enough away from the city you could see the stars at night, but not so small that we weren’t in walking distance from an old ice cream shop, a diner, a couple restaurants. Charm and character, in both the house and where it was located.

The house was ideal.  At least, it should have been.

It was a big step for the three of us. My wife and I and our daughter. Our only. She had just turned three and part of why we moved out of the city was for her – cliché reasons really, the kind you always hear when young parents migrate: the search for better schools, safety. Being closer to family.

But the other reasons were for us. We wanted a house we could afford, one that felt like we weren’t stuffing ourselves and our belongings inside like sardines. A place we could call our own, that we could fill with new and better memories.

It should have been that house.

I still remember walking into the room the day we met with our realtor.

“This is Win’s room,” Jess had said, almost as soon as she stepped in. And following her inside, I saw why.

The room was the second largest bedroom in the house. The color of the carpet was different – a verdant green. The windows were lower; with wide ledges I could just see becoming the perfect stages for Win’s already impressive collection of toys. An ample closet, the only one in the house that didn’t have any loose nails hanging from the paneled interior.

And then there was the nook.

We thought it was a second closet at first, just one without a door. It had a sloping roof that ran down one side of the small space to the carpeted floor. A perfect little play area, one we knew Win with her already exploding imagination could make her own. The kind of play space we both wish we would have had as kids. And it was right next door to our room, so we’d be able to hear her through the walls if she woke up in the middle of the night.

“Oh, good thinking,” the realtor said, smiling and stepping into the threshold of the nook with us, “this was the former owner’s kid’s room too. They left this here.”

She pointed to a section of the interior, wooden boards supporting a shelf near the entrance. There were names there, written in what looked like a pink magic marker. Candace. Marie. Next to each a date and what looked like at first glance to be dates. Written in cleaner script than the names, probably the parent’s handwriting.

“06/19/99” next to Candace.

“08/02/01” for Marie.

“I thought to leave that,” the realtor said, smiling at the way we were examining the names, “some houses need a little record of good memories.”

We agreed. And, in hindsight, seeing that room was what sold us. What helped us overlook the work we’d need to put into the place, the sloping floors next to the front door and the unfinished basement. The spackling it so badly needed, the doorknobs that needed replacing on nearly every door.

It was the idea that this house had already been lived in, that it had cherished memories in its bones. A feeling we thought to add to, a good kind of haunting. One we could add to.

The move was an ordeal for us. We weren’t exactly out in the boonies, but we were still pretty far from the city. My wife still had a job downtown and until she found something else would have to commute there and back – over an hour one way. She worked at a software company and recently got a promotion, which meant she had to work later as well. We shared a car since I started working from home, which meant the first few weeks after we moved she was gone for long stretches.

Sunup to sundown.

My work was pretty laid back, which was a blessing – it meant that I could watch Win during the day. Our parents weren’t far, and we could get either set of them to sit for us if we needed but – I don’t know. I guess I had this thought that I could really build some good memories with her those first few weeks. We’d been so caught up in life in the city, and our apartment there was so small. We'd nearly spent the entirety of our daughter's first three years on top of each other. I wanted to give her a space she could explore - a space she could settle into and find out was her own.

I wanted her to play.

“How did we live with all of this before?” Jess asked me. We were unpacking Win’s clothes and toys in her room while she watched TV downstairs. The TV was the first thing we had set up, and our daughter’s room was next on the list. Our things were still in boxes.

“I don’t know,” I said, unloading a box filled with stuffed animals and a variety of small, plastic bugs. She was a tomboy, and we knew that already. She was obsessed with bugs, with playing in the dirt. Animals. She had less of an interest in princesses and more of a taste for what lived in the dirt. For what lived under rocks.

“She’s going to grow out of all of this so fast,” Jess said, a little t-shirt in her hands as she folded it and put it in Win’s dresser, “in a few years we’ll just be packing all of this away and taking it to Goodwill.”

“I guess so,” I said, unpacking my own box, “or maybe we’ll find someone to give it all to. Hand-me-downs.”

“Maybe,” Jess said, her back still to me, “or maybe we’ll just hold on to them. In case we need some toddler clothes again in a couple of years.”

I looked at her, my face lighting up with a smile. Warmth shooting through me – giddy and sudden. She didn’t turn around, but I could tell she said it with a smile in her voice. We were going to make this place our home, a real home. We had years and years’ worth of dreaming to fill every corner of the house. We were going to grow our family here.

It was one of the first joyful moments in that new house.

Here was another:

Every night before we tucked Win into bed, I set out her toys for her in the morning. She had a few favorites – a pink bunny we thrifted while Jess was still pregnant, some bright and speckled blocks. A brown plastic spider, a green grasshopper. Plastic flowers she could take apart and put back together again – stem and leaf and bud. A plastic spade and shovel with miniature handles and a set of tiny toads.

Before, at our cramped apartment, I had laid each of them out at the foot of her bed, burying the bugs and toads in her comforter. Setting up the flowers in their pieces, the blocks next to her dig site, and the bunny behind the rest – to watch over them all. And Win had the same routine every morning: as soon as she woke up she would take the spade and the shovel and dig out her friends. Finding them in the “dirt” and saying “there you are” with each one she unearthed.

She had a hard time saying “toad” so she said “frog” instead, or “fog” to be more precise. “Spider” was “Spider” but “Grasshopper” was “Grass-y-hopper”. The pink bunny was dubbed “Snacks” and she often talked to him as she dug up the rest of her friends with the plastic shovel and spade in her comforter, narrating her excavations aloud.

The first night we spent in that house, I decided to make a change. I took her baby blanket, the one she no longer slept with but still dragged around with her sometimes into our room or to take in front of the TV and buried her friends underneath. Taking them all over to her nook. Setting Snacks in the threshold of the door to lead the way.

The first morning she woke up in her own bed (getting her to sleep that night had been its own sort of trial), I watched from the doorway of her bedroom. My wife had left already as the sun was coming up so she could get ahead of traffic and I had a few hours more until I had to make a show of doing any sort of real work in my office downstairs.

So, I spent the beginning of my day watching my little girl wake up. Sitting up in her bed, watching the daze of sleep wear off as she looked around – half-wondering where she was in the same way we all do when we wake up some place new and strange.

I saw her look to the foot of her bed for her friends. Her puzzled expression at their absence lasted only a few moments before Snacks caught her eye, sitting in the corner; her fluffy pink sign that led to her own little rabbit hole, lighting the way.

I smiled, trying to stifle a pleased little chuckle, as I watched her get up. Her face lit up as she walked over to her nook to see what I had laid out there while she slept.

Just like that we had a new routine. Win had her own space to play – her own little chamber for her imagination. And it didn’t take her long at all to get to work. Talking aloud to Snacks, her sentences filling up more and more every day. My special gift so well received.

I wish I could have lived in that time forever.

I had no idea what the next few weeks had in store for me. For us.  Before the Lonely Way. Before Milkshake.

Because if I did know? I would have picked up my little girl in my arms and ran out of that house.

I would have run away and never looked back.

\*\*

“Babe?” Jess said, sticking her head out of our room.

I’d been carrying a few boxes into the storage room, the one we hadn’t decided what to do with yet. It might become an office, or a place for Jess to work if she was able to work from home anytime soon. Maybe a library like the one I always wanted as a kid. We had the books for it.

“Yeah,” I answered, setting down my load in the doorway. Win’s room was across the hall, the door shut. It was just after sundown and I could still hear the movie we’d left on for her on her tablet playing inside – she went through favorite films in waves, and the latest was Alice in Wonderland. I could see Alice trapped in the bottle from the other side of the door.

Still, I tried to keep my voice down.

“Come here,” Jess said, hushed. Her eyes were wide, her mouth open.

I didn’t like that look.

I made my way into our bedroom, quickly, my instinct telling me to shut the door behind me after I saw Jess’s expression. I was already preparing myself for some kind of bad news or the start of a fight, spinning, trying to think if there was something I said that I could get ahead of.

Instead, when I turned around, I saw our closet door was open. Jess standing right by it, her arms crossed. Pale.

The room had been an obvious pick for us when we toured the house. It was right across the hall from the bathroom, and even though we’d been wishing for an en suite, the walk-in closet had swayed us. It was huge, lined with shelves and rails for hangers, and slots for shoes. And Jess, being one of those rare breeds of women who owned a lot of clothes, had lit up almost as bright as when she’d seen Win’s room for the first time. I suppose the space was a kind of nook for her, a place she could fill with her own expression. I was happy to see that look then.

But that memory was losing its color now.

“What?” I said, still hushed, still in quiet Dad mode.

“I,” she said, blushing, “I was trying to fit some boxes up on the top shelf and I was shoving them back.”

I looked up to the farthest shelf at the back of the closet and saw what she was going to say even before she said it.

A section of the wall had slid to the side. What looked, upon our first inspection, to be a solid wall was actually a painted panel. It was hanging askew, the corner of it pushed into a darkened space that I didn’t know about.

“I’m sorry,” she said, “I think I, I don’t know, shouldn’t there be a wall there?”

“There should be,” I said, frowning. Stepping closer to the back of the closet.

The first thing I noticed was the smell. Mildew and old wood. Old paint. It made my nose itch and the back of my mouth water.

“I got some dust, or paint chips, or something on some of the boxes,” she said, behind me.

“That’s alright,” I said, half-paying attention. My gaze was focused on the corner of dark that appeared in the back of our closet.

I reached out, taking the loose panel in my hands. I tugged on it, lightly at first. It gave a little and I pulled harder until it was free.

“It’s plywood,” I said, “it’s like, really flimsy plywood.”

I turned around to her.

“Help me take some of these down really quick?”

She nodded, some of the worry fallen off of her face. She was with me, and I with her – both of us curious as hell.

It only took a few minutes to move most of what we’d stored in the closet aside, pushing everything as far back away from the wall as we could. When it was done, I moved next to the shadow square in our wall to try the panel next to it.

“I think they were nailed together once,” I said, feeling it come loose after a few careful tugs.'

“But why?” she asked, taking the panel with gentle hands and laying it next to us at the back of the closet.

It wasn’t much longer until we found our answer. There were four panels in all, each one pried free and laid beside us. Jess took out her phone, flicking open her flashlight and shining it inside.

It was an old staircase, dusty in the dark, with boarded steps rising at a sharp incline, summiting before a thick wooden panel covering a hatch above.

“An attic?” Jess said beside me. She sounded louder, close to me in the space.

I wondered if her heart was beating as fast as mine was.

“Yeah,” I said, shaking my head, “an attic.”

In hindsight, it made sense – the slanted wall of Win's nook, her perfect little play place, must have been under the closet stairs: sloping down towards the carpet, the hidden stairs rising towards the ceiling on the wall’s other side.

“Well, we have to go up there,” Jess said beside me, taking a step forward.

“Hold on a second,” I said, trying to get in front of her, “we don’t know how sturdy those stairs are.”

But Jess was determined. And, in the half-decade we’d been married, I learned quite well that getting in her way when she made up her mind about something would do either of us any good. So I settled for following her, close behind, wincing as I put my foot on the bottom stair.

“There’s more plywood over the doorway,” she said, almost halfway up to the top.

“I know,” I said, “hey, maybe we should wait until morning. Maybe it’s filled in or something.”

“People fill in pools, not attics,” she said.

I shrugged.

“Besides,” she went on, her fingers splaying wide over the piece of wood above her, “I’m not going to sleep in this room for one second knowing there’s some fucking secret space above me.”

And she had a good point there.

I met her at the top of the stairs, both of us leaning against the walls of the narrow flight and helped her push the piece of wood up. It was heavier than the false panels we had taken out of the closet, and we both put our shoulders into it, genuinely straining.

But then the wood gave and – together – we stared into the unknown dark.

“Oh my god,” Jess said, steering her flashlight up and into the black, “oh my fucking god.”

It was an attic alright. Bare wooden beams from the underside of the roof crisscrossed above us. High above us. As we stepped farther up the steps and Jess’s beam showed farther the way forward, we fell into a shocked silence.

It was fucking huge.

And absolutely empty – Jess’s light stretched into the far corners of the space. It was unfinished but not unwalkable – wooden floorboards lined the floor, placed in careful precision.  Looking around, both of us quiet and wide-eyed, we didn’t see a single item. Not a single abandoned box or ancient chest, dress form, or pile of coats. Nothing.

It was a giant, extra room the size of our three bedrooms put together, hidden above us the whole week we’d been living in our new home.

“Babe,” she said, turning to me, both of us smushed up against each other standing halfway out of the stair into the new place, “did we just win a bonus attic?”

I smiled, even in the dark, even though the dark, musty air made my eyes water.

“Yeah,” I said, “I think we did.”

\*\*

Look, I know – I’ve seen horror movies. I’ve seen the one where the new family moves into the new house and everything seems perfect until…

Well, we all know what could be hiding at the end of that thought.  

I’d be lying if I said that the thought didn’t cross my mind while taking apart the panels at the back of the closet. And again at some point through the following weeks. It was a persistent echo, a little whisper in the back of my head growing long in tooth and throat, harder and harsher.

Until it was too late. Until it was screaming.

But you know what scares away the spookies? Sitting up in bed with Jess that night, talking way later than we meant to, dreaming while awake about all of the things we could do with that attic – a playroom, a bigger office, a super-cool bedroom for Win when she got older. We imagined our girl as a full-blown teenager, sneaking out of the tiny attic window we spotted in the far corner to the roof, climbing down the tree in the front yard to meet her friends for some late-night teenager mischief.

There were other joys too. Win’s growing routine in her nook, the way she looked up at us and smiled after running around in the backyard and turning over rocks for earthworms. The way the sun came in the kitchen and lit Jess’s face up on the slow mornings we had most weekends. The walk we all took together down the street, noticing how close we were to the elementary school even if the years when we’d need to think about that seemed so far away. So measured.

I was even starting to love the way the floorboards creaked on the stairs on my way down each morning. All of the sounds the old house made were little symphonies. Accompanying our shared and growing chord that this boon, this place we found and were both so willing to fall in love with, was our home.

A house is what you put in it, and we put in a lot of love and hope in those early days. I wish it would have caught. I wish it had been enough.

But life’s not like that. Our house…our *home*, wouldn't allow our dream to last. I’ve always wanted to tell a story, and I thought the story that was unfolding for us in that precious time would be one of happiness – of joy and growth and life. That was the story I wanted to hold within me.

That was the story I thought I deserved to tell.

But instead, it goes like this:

A couple weeks later I woke in the middle of the night, shooting straight up in bed. An aching peal shook me from a dream. It was decidedly new – a slow, hollow ache – not like the stairs or the walls settling, not like the tinkering branches dancing along the side of the house in the wind. It was a yawn, wooden, a long and mournful creak.

I sat there in the dark with Jess deep asleep beside me and listened for a moment – unsure of its origin, or if it was even real. I was having a nightmare, I remember, where I was locked away somewhere in the dark. I couldn’t breathe, I couldn’t move, and all around me were muffled voices I could almost recognize. They murmured – obscure, strange in tone, and soaked by sorrow.

I ignored it then. Thinking it must have been another voice joining the strange chorus of this old house. But come morning while arranging Win’s toys for her, I found something odd.

I found a new toy in my daughter’s room – one I didn’t remember laying out for her.

There, on the carpet, was a stuffed snake. Crocheted with yarn made of old brittle wool, it looked home-made, but never in our home. I bent down to pick it up, grasping its limp length. As I did, I felt it *crunch* in my grasp.

Its pattern was like a milk snake’s. But off-colored – the hallmark yellow and orange pattern along the spine instead an array of grey hues. Shades of ash standing out against its black, curling length.

Only the eyes looked real. Litle red beads ruby bright even in the shadow of the nook.

“Daddy?” Win asked.

I turned around to see her standing behind me. She was rubbing her eyes and looking at the thing in my hand.

“Honey,” I said, confused, “what is this?”

She shrugged. I looked down at it again, frowning, catching a whiff of something lousy. I brought it to my nose and breathed in, hard.  

It smelled like mildew. Like wet and damp. Like somewhere old.

“It looks like a milk snake,” I said, out loud, pushing the toy away from my face.

“Milkshake?” Win asked.

I looked at her, and even then it was hard not to break out into a smile. When she was a little girl, she came up with half-way names for things all the time. Bumblebees were “bumbbie-bees”. Rocks were “shocks”, and every car was a “tuck” unless it was mine, my old Corolla, which she called “Corolla”.

The echo of that small stretch of time, of who she was and who she had grown out of, lit a little mirth in me. I couldn’t help it.

“Sure darling,” I said, crouching down to meet her eyes, “Milkshake. Where did you get this?”

She took a few steps closer, taking the toy from my hand. I was glad to be rid of it. It felt cold despite where I’d found it – bent on the carpet in a wash of warm morning sun from the window.

“The toybox Daddy,” she said.

My frown returned and deeper this time. I’d only been up for an hour – reading emails and drinking coffee on the porch after Jess left. I never came into Win’s room until the sun was up, until I was sure she would be stirring out of sleep, just in case my little arrangement woke her up.

“There’s not a toybox honey,” I said, “maybe mom brought it in before she left for work?”

But Win shook her head.          

“There is,” she said.

“Where baby?” I asked. Craning my head around the room – taking in her bed, her closet. The nook.

“There *is*,” she said, louder this time, the edge of a rising tantrum cutting her words.

“Where Win?” I asked, ready for some kind of game. A toybox could be a closet drawer, it could be a shoe. It could be a pillowcase, and maybe Jess had snuck in in the middle of the night to slide the toy somewhere Win would find it. Maybe she was trying to get in herself on the game, her own little secret addition to the ritual.

“Show me then,” I said, ready to be led. I stuck out my hand.

Win took it, turning away from me and leading me to the nook. And those three steps across the carpet of her bedroom were the last easy ones I ever took there.

Because when we came to the nook, to the shadows nestled in its mouth, I saw something in the corner. A toybox, the wood slick and dark. Glistening, like a carapace, like black-licorice candy so freshly sucked.

Its lid was closed. I caught a whiff of something breathy. Of spoil and sick.

My heart dropped, my legs felt weak.

“Where did you get that?” I asked, almost automatically.

“It’s IN there,” Win said, I thought she said, stomping her foot, a habit she’d picked up from Jess when there was nothing else to do and she was overwhelmed. I flinched, I stared down at her, my breath catching.

“I know it’s in there,” I said, “but how- “

And that’s when I realized – I’d misheard her. She hadn’t said the toybox was *in* there. But that it had *been* there.

It’s been there. Been there all along.
