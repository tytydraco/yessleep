I was eighteen years old, only starting my first year of college in a new town which I won’t say the name of here. At that time I usually would be found playing soccer with the new people I met around campus. I had lived in the same town for most of my life, so forming new friendships to tackle the loneliness of a new town was just what I needed.

In the first months of class, I found the deepest bonds a young adult could ask for, kicking around the soccer ball with the other hormonal miscreants I lived around. Among them was a peculiar guy named Tom. Tom, who had no feet.

Nobody really called as much attention to Tom as you would think. But I noticed on my first day on the field how he would just “hover” a few feet over the rest of us, the ball moving away from his direction and the other players just running toward it. I was scared speechless, but nobody else seemed to mind, and by the end of the game...I had somewhat gotten used to it. Afterall, I was new in town and this was my one chance to make a good impression on a social clique who could fill my boring hours when I wasn’t in class.

However, one day in November, on a cool, crisp afternoon, I would finally grow the guts to speak to Tom about his circumstance. It started when my leg muscles were so sore from all the running, they were practically begging me to hydrate my body. Then, out of the blue, there he “stood” by the water cooler.

“Tom?”

He looked at me and smiled as he filled his paper cone.

“Hey Jake. Looking forward to your break from school?”

I cleared my throat. My heart was racing, but it had little to do with the exercise I put my body through. The notion of continuing any of his small talk was nonexistent from my head as the looming question broke free from my lips.

“Tom…how the hell are you doing that with your legs?”

His smile, surprisingly, did not break. He chuckled lightly, like I had said something completely casual and not accusatory. But his amicable stare never felt more intense.

“What do you mean, Jake?”

“I mean…I’m not sure if anyone’s ever brought it up to you but…you don’t have feet. You just…hover over us and the ball just moves on its own. And no one ever makes any sort of deal out of it. It’s creepy man. And also- when I’ve asked other people, they somehow have nothing to say about it. Like it’s a totally fucking normal thing?”

This addition was only partially true. As a result of my embedded peer pressure, the topic of Tom’s feet never really entered the topic of conversation at all, between how busy we were ranking which girl around campus was the hottest and which professor was most likely to get fired for ogling at any one of them. I had only inquired about Tom’s feet during a deep talking session after a few beers with my buddy, Charles, in which he nervously looked down to the floor and muttered:

“I don’t know…Maybe it’s just your eyes playing tricks on you…it never bothered me or anyone else for all I know...”

Minutes after that interaction he had faked an urgent event happening the next day, prompting him to get up and leave, leaving me with the bar tab.

“Who did you ask, Jake?” Tom said, “Who did you talk to about me?”

I was at a loss for words. This guy was more than just odd or creepy now...he really had a threatening presence over me.

“Tom…if I’ve offended you I’m sorry but-”, my mouth grew drier, my racing heart growing more intense, and I stifly broke out into cold sweats as I began stammering. “I-I’ve known you for two months... b-but I’ve only ever seen you on this field. You have other places to go in town... don’t you? It doesn’t even bother me much, I was just curious...”

Tom laughed. His eyes saw right through me as he hovered closer to my face. His grin looked cheery, satisfied by my apparent fear. I saw hunger in those eyes. Like a wild animal.

We stared at each other in uncomfortable silence for what felt like hours, then I opened my mouth to speak but he spoke over me.

“I think you better go home. Good luck on those finals, Tom.”

I cautiously backed away, saying nothing to him, and then got into my crappy sedan and left.

I would never set foot back on that field, much like someone else I know, and sincerely hope I will never see again.
