When we moved into the new house on the farm, everything smelled of fresh paint and plaster. My mom let me paint my room purple and even painted little hearts on the walls, trying to make the basement feel less like a basement. But no matter what she did, the air down there always felt wrong. Cold and crisp, like winter air seeping through stone.

Karsten’s room was just across the hall from mine, painted green with his bunk bed pressed against the wall. He was little then, but even at that age, I could tell he was afraid of something. He used to come running upstairs at night, swearing there was a boy who crept into his bed, drenched and ice-cold. At first, we thought it was the kind of thing kids make up. But the look on his face when he spoke of it. His gaze blank with terror and eyes darting to the corners made me believe him.

“The boy whispers,” Karsten told me once, voice shaking. “Sometimes he breathes on my neck. Sometimes I wake up, and he’s already lying next to me.”

He never described him with much detail. Just pale, skinny, with eyes too dark for his face. I always imagined him as a small boy, skin stretched too thin over his sharp bones, like he’d been pulled from the lake and never dried. His face expressionless, a blank canvas of something that wasn’t quite human anymore.

I never saw him. But I heard him.

The dreams started not long after. Every night, the same thing: I’d “wake up” and sit up in bed. From my doorway, I couldn’t see down the hallway, just the wall leading up to the corner. Then I’d hear it: the sound of a bead, or a pearl, hitting the floor somewhere down the hall. It would roll toward me, echoing in the silence.

Then came the footsteps. Small, wet, barefoot steps padding closer and closer, picking up speed. Faster. Louder. Coming straight for my door.

Every time, I would wake up frozen, my chest pinned as if something small and heavy sat on top of me. I never dared open my eyes, too afraid I’d see him there - His blank face inches from mine. I would squeeze my eyes shut and try to scream, but all that ever came out was a breathless squeak.

Karsten wasn’t as lucky. He saw him. He felt him. He woke up with scratches on his back and said the boy whispered things he couldn’t understand. Sometimes, when he woke, he swore he could feel cold fingers tangled in his hair.

The boy always came from the same end of the hallway. Where Karsten’s room faced the darkness, and where the sound of those footsteps always began. My brother said the boy had drowned in the lake at the bottom of our hill. I never doubted it. The farm was too old, the land too heavy with history, for it not to be true.

Even our mom felt him. She never said much at the time, but years later she admitted that when she’d gone to bed alone one night, she felt a small, cold hand brush across her foot beneath the covers. After that, whenever Dad was away, I’d sleep in her bed. I always thought of these nights as fun girls’ nights - watching TV until late. Now I know it was because she was too afraid to sleep alone.

We don’t live there anymore. But I still dream of that hallway sometimes - the narrow walls, the corner I could never quite see past. In those dreams the silence always breaks the same way: a bead striking the floor, rolling slowly toward my door.

Even now, years later, the sound still knots my stomach. My whole body remembers what my mind tries to forget - the weight pressing down on my chest, the way my throat locked tight, the awful silence of trying to scream but only forcing out a breathless gasp. It’s as if the terror carved itself into me, so that whenever I hear something roll across the floor, my body seizes, bracing for footsteps that never come.

Because I know if I open my eyes, I’ll see him.The pale boy with dark eyes, dripping cold water onto the floor. And he’ll be waiting for me to notice him.
