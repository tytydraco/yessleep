  Sitting on the porch listening to the sounds of the forest pervading through the deafening silence. It’s peaceful, I always loved being around nature, who doesn’t? I loved to stroll through these woods, I knew every major and minor trail in that small neck of woodland. 
  
  My purpose for doing so at the time was that of curiosity, I wanted to know what was out there? Where do all the trails lead to? My mother, terrified of the very idea of me being anywhere but home bothered me. It made me feel sterilized, like if I were to fall in just the right way, I would shatter into a million tiny pieces. So telling her about my plan to “sleep over at Dylan and Tyler’s house” aka sneak into the woods to do some camping with said friends, and possibly some cute girls. Yea that will smooth over just fine, about as smooth as twenty grit, that’s a sandpaper joke haha. Cause it’d be rough ? Anyways…

  Mom: Don’t you think it’s a little last minute to go to your friends? I just put dinner in the oven. 

  Me: I know and I’m sorry about it being last minute, there’s just only so much summer vacation left before school starts. 

  Mom: I suppose that’s fine but you’re lucky your father isn’t home from work, he would have shut you down on the spot.  

  Me: thanks mo-

  Before the words can fully register, I’m greeted to the familiar jingles and mechanical lock, unwinding to the twist of my father’s key. Thankfully I was prepared for this moment, in fact, I had trained for it my whole life. With my bag in one hand, I knew I had about fifteen seconds to bolt out the back door, and into the woods. careening through trees with no regard for bodily harm, I accelerated, started going a little too fast, and tripped over my own foot. My head colliding with a stump a few feet away from the trail, everything going black in an instant. Silence fell over me, I don’t know how long I was out, but it had to have been a while, the sky was now a deep reddish hue of orange. 
  Scanning my surroundings, and then myself, I notice I’m mostly unscathed. As I pick myself up, and begin to head down the trail. I could have swore, for just a moment, that I could hear music coming deep from within the woods. 

  As I continued to walk down the trail to my friend’s property line, I could swear the music was getting louder, and as it drew closer, the last remaining light that shined its way through the dense brush ceased its activity, as the air around grew cold and bitter in my mouth. I could finally make out what that music was coming from the forest. I knew this song… my mom would listen to it all the time, but something was off about the song almost uncanny. It sounded like it was crackling, like there was static behind the song. As if somebody had just put on vinyl, you could hear the needle popping. 
  Me: whoever’s out there this isn’t funny!
I shout into the woods, my statement greeted with silence, the music had stopped. Not only the music, but all the sounds from the forest had stopped simultaneously. The air grew even colder,  I had stopped walking at this point. The silence became so loud, that I became scared to make a sound, or move, I felt sweat begin to form at the center of my palms. Even in total darkness, in total silence, even when I felt invisible. Those two bright eyes staring directly at me, no through me. I’m in complete shock, I can’t move my legs, whatever this was it wasn’t human. It was way too tall, and way too dark to see an outline of its body. 

  That’s when the silence broke, I could hear the popping the crackling static as the song began to play again. “Run rabbit, run rabbit, run, run, run
Run rabbit, run rabbit, run, run, run
Bang, bang, bang, bang goes the farmer's gun
Run rabbit, run rabbit, run, run, run, run.” It was coming from the direction of the eyes, but this time it was so loud, it was making my ears ring, I felt nauseous, like I was gonna fall down at any moment, but my legs kept me upright. As the song grew even louder my stomach churned, I was gonna throw up, I genuinely felt that sick. 

  Like the song was triggering my gag reflex or something, my throat became scratchy, and suddenly it was getting harder breathe. I could see long, porcelain white fingers outstretched from the shadows above me. Its hands were so large, the way they slowly advanced from above. For a moment, they almost look like wings from an angel. But no angel I’m aware of comes from the shadows, this was nothing like that. Its hands wrap around me tethering me, Immobilizing my paralyzed body even further. Lifting me from the ground, I remain stationary for a brief moment. Before I’m sucked into the void silence, once again consumes everything, every noise. And like a star had exploded, light broke through the dreaded silence, when suddenly.
  Me: “I was awake, right where I had first fallen, like all of it was a bad dream. But it felt too real to just shake off, this time I made it through the trail, I made it to my friend’s house, and now, I’m here with you guys! Camping out in the woods… I didn’t even wanna tell you guys cuz, I knew you’d just laugh.” The fire crackles around three dimly lit faces their silence speaks volumes, all staring  intensely in my direction, their names are Tyler, Dylan, and Rachel. We’ve all been friends for longer than I can remember, Rachel is the first to speak up.

  Rachel: holy shit Connor what the fuck was that story? you have all of us looking over our shoulders here! But it’s just a story tho why wouldn’t you wanna tell us? 
Dylan: yea what’s with holding out on us Connor are you trying to say that really Happened or something? 
  He’s smirking when he says that, the comment makes my face feel hot. Rachel and Dylan chuckle about it a bit. But Tyler’s face is stone cold, he’s looking directly at me. Like I had just punched his mom in the face or something. I could see the knuckles on his hands begin to turn white, the chuckles where interrupted by Tyler’s four only words 
  Tyler: you heard the music too ?
  
  The way he looked at me when he asked that question, I didn’t know if I had the answer or not anymore. 
  Connor: yea why? 
  Tyler: because I’ve heard it before too, every night I hear it, it gets louder, and louder, and then… everything goes quiet, So quiet I can hear myself think.

  Dylan, Tyler’s brother, someone who he had shared a connection with since birth, someone who knew his brother longer than anyone else.
Never had I seen Dylan look so distraught and frightened, hearing those words leave his brother’s mouth. Everyone taken back by Tyler and my statements we all stare at each other, the firing crackling through the eerie silence of the forest. None of know what to say, Rachel once again, breaks the tension. 
  Rachel: has anyone heard any animals in the woods since Connor’s story? I swear when he was telling it I could hear some birds, but now, it’s like the forest is completely empty.
