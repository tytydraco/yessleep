It all started a few days ago. 

"Hurry up, Grady!" my mom yelled as I climbed upstairs. 

"The food's going to get cold!" 

They had ordered pizza, and the delivery driver had just arrived. 
We had just moved into a new house, and I was about to check out my new room. The home, built in the early 1900s, had been remodeled with a new kitchen and living room. I walked into the room at the end of the hallway to the right, which had been designated as mine by my parents. The walls smelled of a fresh coat of white paint. However, despite this, there was an underlying smell of mustiness that hit your nostrils in certain areas of the room. 

After looking in my new room, I booked it downstairs and ate pizza with my family. They had ordered one pepperoni and one supreme pizza. I can't stand supreme pizza. 

Following lunch, we all worked diligently to unpack the moving truck and move our household goods into our rooms. We finished around 10 PM. Given the amount of space available, my bed and TV took up most of the room. Luckily, I didn't have too much else: a couple of boxes of video games, comic books, and a random junk box. 

I opened up the dark closet—there was no light—and began to put my boxes in there. Then I stopped. I heard it—a ringing, ever so slight, so slight that if you told me it was in my head, I wouldn't have thought another thought about it. The ringing was not one tone but wavered between high and low tones. It was mildly uncomfortable. 

After getting all my boxes in the closet, it was midnight, and I was exhausted. I closed the closet door, turned off my lights, and lay in bed. The ringing seemed to be gone now. However, maybe because of the silence, I could swear I could still hear it in my mind. I drifted to sleep with no issue, though. 

I awoke in the morning with little thought to the ringing. I walked downstairs; my mom and dad were downstairs with a full spread of bacon, eggs, sausage, and biscuits set out on the table for breakfast. I was running late, so I took a few sips of orange juice on my way out the door to school. 

School went by fast. Not much to say. The teachers introduced me in class, and I met a few kids. Yet to see if any of them would become good friends. I finished my day, drove home, and then I heard it as I pulled up in my driveway—the faint, wavering ringing tone from last night. 

I walked into the house; my parents were still at work, and the ringing had started getting louder. I tried to ignore the ringing as I walked upstairs, but I couldn't. Every high pitch started piercing my ears, and every low tone gave me a feeling of utter discomfort. 

As I closed in on my room, the noise got louder. Once inside, I noticed it was coming from the closet. The noise was so uncomfortable now that I opened the closet door in pain. 

There I saw it, glowing through a crack in the floorboard. My heart raced as I pulled a small army knife out of my junk box, dropping the rest of the contents in my room behind me. I pried off the dusty floorboard, revealing a small dark space underneath. 

As if there were two LEDs lit up, I saw a magenta and gold light faintly lit in the dark space. I grabbed at them, feeling a wooden disk, pulling it towards me. The ringing dissipated instantly, and the lights faded. I pulled the disk into the light. The cold, dark, wooden disk, adorned with what felt like tar-laced black twine, bore inscriptions of unrecognizable symbols etched deep into its surface. 

And then that was it. All was silent. Here I was, standing with a wooden trinket that looked like it was purchased at a gift shop out in the middle of nowhere, found under a floorboard in my closet. I examined the object and wondered how it was lit up before. No LEDs were present. Better yet, how did it make that awful sound? After thumbing around the object for 10 minutes and not finding anything obviously out of place, I set it on my nightstand. 

A large boom rang from downstairs right as I set the object down. 

"Grady!" my mother called from downstairs. "We're home." 

I left the wooden medallion on my nightstand and went downstairs. 

We left the house to grab dinner at the local steakhouse. Over dinner, I discussed my experience with my parents, but they didn't seem too concerned. They assured me maybe the lack of sleep, or the stress of moving had caused my ears to ring for a bit. 

Later that evening at home, I started playing video games on my TV in my room. It had been days since I'd been able to play Warzone. I paid little attention to the wooden disk. As I just chalked it up to a weird experience at this point. 

I ended up playing until 1 AM. Once again, I was exhausted. But hey, you can't go to bed on a loss, and you also can't go to bed on a winning streak. I lay back in bed and drifted off as the light of the main screen slowly disappeared through my closing eyelids.
 
My eyes shot open! There it was, the horrid loud wavering tone, only this time it was more uncomfortable. It caused me to wince in pain. Then I looked around my room. Poking through large fleshy, venous cracks in my wall were magenta and gold lights; they pulsed and throbbed in brightness. 

I was taken aback. Awestruck with the beauty but disturbed by the horror that was around me. My bedroom walls began falling to pieces. The sound tone rose to a climax. My own voice was inaudible because it was so loud. Then the lights flashed a brilliant but blinding magenta. 

The light cleared, and I was back in my room, grasping hard to my chest the wooden disk. What had I just experienced? My mind was racing. I was happy to be rid of the horrid sound and the blinding lights, but I knew this was not normal. I stashed the medallion in my nightstand drawer as fast as I could. 

I sat in bed with the lights on until morning. I heard my parents’ rummaging downstairs. Grabbing the medallion, I stormed downstairs. 

"Mom, Dad, we need to talk," I said. 

"What's going on, Grady?" my mom asked. 

I explained to my mom how I started hearing the ringing ever since I found this little wooden medallion. My dad reached out for it. 

"No!!" I cried. "Don't touch it!" 

"Grady, it will be fine," he responded as he picked up the dark wooden disk. 

He rolled it in his hands, flipping it upside down and back forward again. 

"See, all good, Grady," he stated. 

As nothing happened from that moment, I laughed it off and put the disk in the junk drawer downstairs, next to all the batteries and tape. 

They let me stay home from school that day, and I grinded on Warzone for hours, to get my mind off everything. Until once again, it was close to midnight. I decided to turn in. I laid down in bed, and my eyes drifted to sleep. And then it started again. 

My eyes shot open, and I looked at my walls. The large fleshy, venous cracks in my walls were glowing with the magenta and gold lights again. I felt draped twine around my neck and looked down to my chest. To my horror, planted on my chest was the medallion, glowing violently in the same colors. 

Then it happened: the walls shattered around me, and I was sucked from my bed into a vast abyss of beautifully horrific purple cosmos and golden nebulas, floating through space like an untethered astronaut. I tried to scream, but no sound came out. My limbs were immovable and numb. The air felt colder than I'd ever experienced, beyond freezing. Similar to when your foot falls asleep, it felt like a thousand tiny needles were trying to force their way out of my skin from the inside, only 1000 times more painful. 

Forced to stare forward, it came into view. My heart filled with immeasurable dread, pain, and sorrow. Before me was a disfigured maelstrom of chaos, a swirling mass of stars and shadows. It was the heart of all dread, a bellowing roar in the vast silence of the universe. Its form was ever-changing, a puzzle with infinite pieces, never meant to be solved. The fabric of reality was slipping right before my eyes. The deep, hideous roar of indiscernible noises echoed out of it. Nothing like I'd ever heard. But I knew it was speaking to me. And every noise was more unbearable than the last. A flash of light emanated from the center mass of the being. So bright it felt as if my eyes were frying, and it was physically impossible to close them. 

My alarm rang as I opened my eyes, petrified as to what I had just seen. I finally gained movement back in my limbs and mouth. I screamed out in fear. I was sweating more than I'd ever sweated in my life. I clutched my chest for the medallion, and it was not there. My screams turned into maniacal laughter. It was all just a dream. It had to be. 

I finally pulled myself together, threw on some clothes, and walked downstairs. I repeated, "It was only a dream, it was only a dream," over and over again. 

I hesitantly opened the junk drawer where I had put the medallion yesterday. As the drawer opened, I saw only the batteries, tape, and a pile of dark ash. The medallion was gone; it was destroyed. A feeling of relief filled my body. I can't explain it, but just the fact that the pendant was no longer tangible or in my presence comforted me immensely. 

I pushed on the rest of the morning, gathering my items for school. I took a shower because of sweating so intensely I smelled of hogwash. I was still disturbed but mildly relieved. I grabbed my keys and walked out the door. 

As I walked to my car, I looked into the bright blue sky. It was a beautiful day. A cloud passed over the sun, and I started to feel an itch on my chest. The itch began to intensify. I began scratching my chest, only to feel a weird texture on my skin. 

I pulled my V-neck down with great force, and to my horror, there etched in my skin were the same unrecognizable symbols from the medallion. 

The shadow of the clouds passed over my head, pulling my attention to the sky. Surrounded by the bright blue sky was a crack, and pouring out were those same familiar magenta and gold lights, pulsing violently.

“It had all been real.”

Then... ever so faintly, a deep bellow of an indiscernible roar started ringing in my ears. 

Frantically, I bolted back into my house and rushed up to my room.  The eldritch roaring in my ears has not stopped and I am too horrified to even look [outside.](https://www.reddit.com/user/NoctaNautYT/)
