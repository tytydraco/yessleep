I never believed in the supernatural. Ghosts, demons, cryptids—it was all a load of crap to me. That was until last month, when I moved into a new apartment. It was small but cheap, and for someone living paycheck to paycheck, it was perfect. Or so I thought.

The first couple of days were uneventful. The place had its quirks, sure—creaky floors, a weird smell that never seemed to go away, but nothing too unusual. I blamed it on the building’s age. The landlord told me it was built in the ‘60s, and there hadn’t been many tenants over the years. People came and went, she said. I should’ve asked more questions.

It all started with the tapping.

Late one night, after unpacking the last of my boxes, I settled down on the couch to relax. It was quiet, save for the occasional car passing outside. Then I heard it: a faint tapping sound coming from the wall behind me. I paused my show and listened. Tap, tap, tap. It was slow and deliberate, like someone lightly knocking on the other side of the wall.

I assumed it was my neighbor. Thin walls, old building—it made sense. I brushed it off.

The next night, it happened again. This time, the tapping was louder, more persistent. Tap, tap, tap. I knocked back, thinking maybe my neighbor was trying to mess with me. But the tapping stopped, and the rest of the night was quiet.

The third night, things got worse.

I was lying in bed, struggling to sleep when the tapping started again. Only this time, it wasn’t just behind me—it was all around me. The sound seemed to come from inside the walls, like there were dozens of hands tapping in unison, growing faster and faster. I sat up, heart pounding, trying to make sense of it. The walls felt too thin for animals to get inside, and it didn’t sound like rats or mice. It sounded… intentional.

I knocked on the wall next to my bed. The tapping stopped immediately. Silence filled the room, thick and unnerving. Then, from somewhere above me, I heard a faint, whispering voice.

*"Let me out."*

I froze. I could feel the hair on the back of my neck stand up. My throat went dry, and I listened intently, hoping it was just my imagination. But the voice came again, louder this time, more desperate.

*"Let me out."*

I jumped out of bed, grabbed my phone, and turned on the flashlight. I aimed it at the ceiling, expecting to see cracks or something—anything—to explain the sound. But there was nothing. The ceiling was bare, not even a water stain. But the voice persisted, now accompanied by scratching, as if something was trying to claw its way out of the walls.

Panicked, I grabbed my keys and bolted out of the apartment. I spent the night at a friend’s place, convinced that I’d lost my mind. I told him what I’d heard, but he laughed it off, saying I’d probably been dreaming or just freaked myself out. I tried to believe him, but deep down, I knew what I had heard.

The next morning, I returned to the apartment. I felt uneasy stepping inside, but the place seemed normal. I hadn’t heard the tapping or the voice since I left. Maybe I really had imagined it.

But then I noticed something.

On the wall next to my bed, where I had knocked the night before, were scratches. Long, deep grooves carved into the plaster, as though something with sharp claws had tried to tear its way out. My stomach churned. I hadn’t noticed those the night before.

I tried to convince myself they had been there all along, but as I looked closer, I saw something else. Faintly etched into the wall, barely visible unless you looked closely, were words.

*"I’m still here."*

That was the last straw. I packed up my things and left that same day, breaking the lease and never looking back. But the worst part? The part that keeps me awake at night?

I looked up the apartment’s history after I left. Turns out, the building had been empty for years before I moved in. The last tenant? She disappeared under mysterious circumstances. No one ever found her.

But they did hear something. The neighbors reported strange sounds coming from the apartment. Tapping. Scratching. And her voice.

*"Let me out."*

Now, wherever I go, I hear that same tapping. In hotel rooms, in my new apartment, even when I visit friends. It’s always there, faint at first, growing louder by the day.

And every time it stops, I hear that voice again. 

*"I’m still here."*
