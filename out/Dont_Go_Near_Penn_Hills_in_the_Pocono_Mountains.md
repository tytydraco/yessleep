i’ve spent most of my life exploring places people forgot existed. decaying malls, abandoned schools, shuttered hospitals.

in particular i had a penchant for abandoned honeymoon resorts. the kind of places where the air smells like mildew and forgotten memories.

whether you call it a hobby, obsession, or trespassing, i call it work, or as other people call it, urban exploration. i’m a photographer, and while i don’t mean to brag, i have to say i’m a pretty good one too. photographing these places that have decayed past their prime and posting them online with factoids about their history has gotten me pretty far.

last weekend i went to the pocono mountains in pennsylvania. more specifically, to the old penn hills resort. my parents honeymooned there in the early ’70s, and i’ve only seen it in their faded polaroids: a mirrored lobby that reflected ceiling chandeliers from every angle, heart-shaped tubs in every suite, a wedding-bell-shaped pool outside.

i’d never asked them much about it. nostalgia wasn’t their language. but it was mine, so i packed up my gear and headed out to scout my next project.
the hotel had closed in 2009 but was dying long before that. 
only a few short years later it was already being swallowed by the forest. windows boarded up, vines crawling over the brickwork like anxious fingers. according to local rumor — the kind you hear from gas station clerks who never leave town and locals who grew up around the area — the place had shut down after a mysterious string of incidents: guests disappearing, staff quitting in droves, and a series of accidents in the pool area that no one wanted to talk about. 
i didn’t believe in curses or ghosts. 
i believed in wood rot and mismanagement.

it was dipping into late afternoon by the time i headed out the door, so i knew i’d get some golden hour lighting if i didn’t hit traffic.
driving down to the poconos, it’s easy to see why it’s been a honeymoon destination for decades. it feels like you’re driving right into a storybook. wild deer and small brooks are all accoutrements to the mountainous dreamscape that makes you feel like you’re in another time, stuck in the sweet spot of americana glory people always talk about.

i parked my aging rav4 on a side road and walked along the sprawling display of weeds and overgrowth until i found the remnants of pavement cracked and weathered.

“well, here it is,” i thought to myself as i approached the vine-engulfed structure.

the main building was nearly destroyed with most of it falling in on itself but still traversable. the surrounding buildings like the ice rink, suites, and rec center were in mostly good shape. i thought i’d photograph some heart-shaped tubs, maybe a champagne tower, and some vintage signage.

walking inside the first set of suites, the smell hit me first. wet pine needles, rotting carpet, mildew, and something faintly metallic. i cracked a grin. classic abandoned building perfume. i should’ve known better than to be alone, but i had my camera gear, my flashlight, a switchblade, and a pair of gloves — the basic uniform of someone who pretends he’s prepared for anything.

the mirrored ceiling reflected everything, but it was cloudy with dust so the reflections were warbly. the carpet had turned a grim shade of brown instead of its original rich crimson.
i thought to myself, “the last people to care left two decades ago.”
i explored the first few suites slowly, looking for forgotten treasures and peeking out the windows at the endless forest outside.
room numbers were painted in curling gold script on each door. 101. 102. 103. some locked, most warped. i finally found 107 — the suite my parents had stayed in. the door hung slightly ajar. that wasn’t odd. vagrants, other urbexers, and bored local kids were notorious for doing what i was doing, some even overstaying their welcome or trashing the place.
the bed frame was intact though the mattress sagged like it had given up. the heart-shaped tub still gleamed faintly under the grime. i crouched and photographed everything, narrating to myself like i was giving a tour.
“notice the peeling wallpaper, faint scorch marks on the carpet. architectural optimism meets entropy.”
i chuckled at my own jokes, trying to calm the rising awareness that this place was too quiet. penn hills had a different air to it.

then i heard it. 
a faint thump, like someone closing a box upstairs. 
i froze, flashlight sweeping the room, heart tightening. my first thought: animals. raccoon. squirrel. maybe even a raccoon-sized squirrel. my second thought: human. that’s when the wit in my head started muttering warnings — classic horror tropes i’d read so many times.
“don’t investigate alone. don’t split up. don’t open closed doors.”

in that moment i realized clichés are only clichés because they have been experienced so many times and are rooted in truth.

the stairwell reeked of mildew and dust, and every step made the old wood groan. as i moved to what i thought was the second set of suites next door, i noticed the corridor of doors. most were closed. a couple had broken locks and gaping holes. then i saw it: an office door with “staff only” carved faintly in peeling paint. these were rooms used for meetings and offices, probably from when penn hills tried to turn into a conference center when the honeymoon business was going belly up in the late ’90s.

the thumping was coming from there. i approached slowly, flashlight shaking slightly. i peeked through a crack.
the room was small. desks, filing cabinets, yellowed papers scattered everywhere.
in the corner, a man crouched over a desk, moving methodically through piles of paperwork. he was wearing a janitor’s uniform.
his hair was stuck to his head like a bird that had just hatched from an egg. his body was thin and his limbs long.
he looked like he belonged to the hotel’s first crew. he didn’t look up. he didn’t even seem aware i existed.
then i noticed what he was holding: a stack of polaroids. pictures of me entering the building. me exploring the lobby. me looking cluelessly around the first set of suites. unaware i was being watched.

i froze.

he murmured numbers, counting them like money, calculating something i wasn’t meant to understand.
i stepped back.
my flashlight slipped.
a metallic clang.
he turned his head slowly. eyes white around dark pupils. his lips stretched into something like a smile revealing greying gums and yellow teeth, sending a chill down my neck.
“i’ve been waiting,” he said.
not malicious. matter-of-fact.

i ran.

down the stairs, through the lobby, across the overgrown driveway.
i didn’t stop until my car was in sight, doors locked, engine roaring. my hands shook, adrenaline buzzing with every heartbeat.
back home, i replayed everything in my head. i wanted a rational explanation. maybe a security guard who never left and had a sick sense of humor.
but the photos were too many for someone just trying to catch me trespassing.
and if that’s all he wanted, why didn’t he call the police?
i didn’t sleep that night. i couldn’t stop thinking about being watched and knowing he could’ve gotten to me if he wanted to. what was his intention?
after all, he was just a man. patient. methodical. utterly unshaken by the moral weight of what he was doing.
i called my parents the next day.
the hotel? they remembered it as charming, idyllic, a blur of champagne and laughter. they remembered the staff as friendly and helpful. they remembered nothing unusual.
i didn’t tell them about the man or the pictures or the way he had been waiting.
as the days went on, i couldn’t shake the feeling i was still being watched. at night when i was lying in bed or brushing my teeth at the bathroom sink, i’d feel the gaze of the unknown stranger somewhere behind me.
it was the strange feeling you get when you know someone is staring at you without turning around.
i dismissed it as paranoia. eventually life went back to normal, and i almost forgot about the whole ordeal.
almost.

weeks later i got a letter. brown envelope. no return address. no address on the front at all, like someone placed it directly into my mailbox.
inside: a polaroid of me standing in my apartment kitchen, looking down at a cup of coffee.

from what i understand, penn hills isn’t haunted. there’s no ghost waiting for you in the heart-shaped tub. there’s a man. patient. observant. careful. waiting for the right moment to catch you off guard.
i don’t know what he wants or how long he’s been there.

but i do know this…every abandoned place i’ve explored, every cracked floorboard i thought i was safe on, every wry comment i made about horror tropes,
it was all irrelevant when face to face with a terrifying encounter like this. 
it doesn’t need to be supernatural to be horrifying.
he’s just sitting in there, or maybe somewhere else, taking photographs.
be careful where you trespass. he might be waiting for you.
