>!Self-Harm!<

Typically I'm not the type of person to complain…

  


I've spent my whole life in the same backwoods town and if you're unfortunate enough to have done the same then you damn well know you give up on the thought of hopes and dreams far before you ever graduate high school. It's a coping mechanism of sorts, never getting your hopes up makes it so you're never disappointed

  


With nothing to its name besides several waste spillage incidents and enough murder suicides to fill the newspapers to the funny pages; the most my prom night baby of a town ever succeeded in terms of infamy was becoming the last town to have an outbreak of polio.

  


 All this to say things aren’t expected to go right for me. I've effectively started the race of life with my feet tied together in a potato sack coated in gasoline, only to be shot in the foot with the starting pistol. I never had high expectations for my career path in life… Honestly I never really had expectations at all. The bar was set on the floor and stomped a foot deeper into the ground and when you care that little for yourself in my town, you work at the Truckstop.



I've been working at the same dingy sweatshop of a workplace in my less than shitty town for a few months now and tonight of all nights may finally be the breaking point. Is this the first night that I've thought of quitting in all my time working here? No. Not even close, that would go to the time last month when I had to drag a rotting elk carcass out of the bathroom and through the building on a snow sled. Tonight though… Tonight was by far the longest and most maddening hours of my entire life.



I've been sitting locked in the back of the sheriff’s police cruiser, soaked in blood that is not my own, and that DAMNED MAN ON THE ROOF… has been laughing at me for the past 40 minutes well deputy dickhead’s been AWOL after walking into the marsh behind the parking lot.



 The good news (If you could even call it that) is that my phones got ample charge and with all this time on my hands before the sun comes up and my boss comes in for the opening shift; I'm left with ample time to write a lengthy and heartfelt letter of resignation.



 To my manager Leonard, if you find yourself reading this. Go fuck yourself.



To everyone else that cares to hear about my walking OSHA violation of a workplace. Enjoy this typed up mess well I try not to get diaper rash from my boxers soaked in blood.



From the start of the night things started on the wrong fucked up foot. I showed up for my 10pm start a tad late much to the dismay of our closing shift. A cranky 60 year old man stood idly by the punch in machine located in the corner next to the employees only door. For those unacquainted with the rest stop one might assume they've come across some sort of the gothic leprechaun but unfortunately for me I had come to know the guy as my closer.  He stood at a height of about 4 '11. He was a little on the heavy side but it wasn’t very noticeable under his all black work appointed uniform which fit over him like a tarp. What was noticeable however (as I'm sure he intended) was his look of pure disappointment and disdain. He glared up at me with his eyes sat so sunken back into his head he looked partly like a Halloween prop of Dracula.



“You're late” his voice croaked from way too far down his throat.



It was a pointless endeavor and I learned as much within my first night working here but I tried my best to keep things civil. I glanced away from him and looked at the clock marking the time.



10:02



“Eat a dick Sebastian its been 2 minutes, You’ll live” 



I did try…



I attempted to scoot past him and get started with closing down the building but he stepped awkwardly in front of me.



In a seemingly well practiced rant the (self) appointed leader and sole proprietor of night shift, Sebastian; spent the next 40 minutes spouting to me about how he spent “Enough Time Here” and that if his work towards cleaning out the black sludge from the soda machines and his consistent removal of the piss odor from the massage chairs in the corner continued to go unappreciated. He would be my “Downfall”.



He didn't seem to realize he’d spent far more time whining to me than the short amount I took from him in showing up late but nonetheless…I knew I overstepped.



When he was particularly angry his ears, which sat heavy on the sides of his head, would wobble with each labored word that came from his mouth. Any angrier than he was now and he may very well end up flying into the ceiling fans.



I apologized, told him it would never happen again (Much like I told him every night) and continued about the rest of my shift.



I turned off the flickering luminescent lights of the 3 fast food restaurants within the building and grabbed the keys from the maintenance room to turn off the soda machines when I heard him for the first time that night.



A loud and lingering groan squeezed its way through the asbestos filled roof tiling above. 



I paused, looked around to make sure no one else was around, and promptly put my headphones over my head. 



You see, I took this job due to the lack of having to actually interact with people, for as long as I've been able to remember I've been on the lesser side of socially tolerable. Unfortunately for me however the rest stop is prone to one unsightly visitor, I don't know who he is, I don't know what he looks like but some cracked out homeless guy has found himself a comfy little place on the roof of the Truckstop.



Honestly I wouldn’t care if he wasn't such a pain in the fucking ass. My job isn’t exactly rocket science and I can tell you for certain I definitely don't get paid as such.



I know better than most how much this town has failed its inhabitants and with that I’d give the man on the roof a little bit of credit if it weren't for the fact that he seemed to derive pleasure in torturing me.



I could sweep away at sesame seeds and ketchup stains for hours only to hear loud stomping from the roof following my path above me, when I turn around… dust and black soot would lay across the ground where I had just cleaned. If you listen closely, very faintly, you can hear his giddy filled chuckles… Fucken. Dickhead.



That's not all either, you see dead center of the plaza we have this moose statue thing that I guess is supposed to be some sort of mascot and every. Fucking. Time. I finish cleaning the bathrooms, its covered antler to toe in toilet paper, newspaper and half empty trash bags. Seemingly whatever the bastard could get his hands on.  On a few occasions our friend from the rafters has even put stupid party hats over it. Amusing to you I am sure but never fun for the only guy in the building left to clean it.



Honestly though the truckers have it the worst by far. I've heard the stories from some of the recurring night drivers… they’ll stop in to come take a piss and grab a snack at the vending machines only to have someone throw literal human shit at them from the roof of the back entrance.



I know what you may be thinking “Oh humble narrator why doth thou not call upon the authorities” if you were thinking that, first off you're weird. and second! Believe me I've tried but the response time towards getting to the rest stop is so negligible I've seen uber eats arrive here sooner than any emergency service. Worse yet whenever the cops do get here the roof man is nowhere to be seen. I swear to you he has some voodoo sense for detecting the boys in blue because that babbling lunatic is so god damn illusive the cops have chalked him up to some small town folktale made up by bored kids.



Come to think of it, that psycho might have a police scanner. On some nights when the noise of rain isn't hammering down and the wind from the coast isn't threatening to topple the whole building over, I swear I've heard radio static pouring down from the ceiling.



I was really hoping that whatever the man upstairs had planned for tonight wasn’t anything too intense, this week had already shaped up to be my worst in a while after having to clean up a little too much vomit with way too little gloves after my boss forgot to order them… again. 



Most of the time my job was made a lot easier by putting on some music and splitting my time between mopping the lobby and cleaning the cooking supplies in the back but every once in a while on occasions less rare than I'd like. 



A customer comes in.



Now technically the plaza is a 24 hour run business meaning we do need to have something available for purchase in the building at all times. Besides the vending machines that had a habit of mugging you for all your change and keeping its expired snacks for itself, there was a small scan and go marketplace that held all the candy bars and energy drinks any late night losers like myself could ever dream of. 



Being the only place in town still open past about 10 o'clock I had gotten used to my fair share of stoners or groups of rowdy teens and would oftentimes turn my head the other way to let them shoplift and do as they please so long as they don't make my job any more difficult. Tonight however was a little different. 



A little rarer than the stoners but common enough to distill a sense of sorrow into my heart was the people strung out on the heavier stuff. 



Most of the time it was people I recognized around town and every once in a while it was someone I had gone to school with… on nights like these however there was hardly a look of recognition in their eyes.



The customer that popped her head through the door was none other than my 2nd grade English teacher Mrs. Rose.



I loved her class! She was one of those teachers that was sweet and caring enough to hear your 7 year old problems. Unlike anybody else in that school she seemed to genuinely have a passion for **Inspiring the youth. In fact it's only because of her that half the students in our school could pass for semi literate. More than a few times she even drove me home after classes when my dad would forget to pick me up.** 



**She never seemed to hate it either, that's something even a kid could pick up on…**



I gave her a slight smile and a nod unsure if she’d recognize me but by the time the glass doors had closed behind her I realized I was looking at an entirely different woman than the one I once knew to grade my papers with a note that always read “good job kiddo”. 

  


She staggered onto one leg barely catching herself from toppling over. Her white band tee was stained with… something. An odd mix of colors and chunks that might have marked spilt food or perhaps vomit which dripped down her collar and down onto her stomach. She met my eyes and jumped a little like she never saw me standing 5 feet from her.



“Bathroom?” She spit up to me with frenzied eyes.



I just pointed to the other side of the building. She thanked me and shambled past me with the pungent scent of alcohol trailing not far behind. I knew it was a lot more than drinking. She looked as if she had a bad case of chickenpox with the scabs building all over her face. As she fidgeted over towards the door of the bathroom I was doused in a heavy blanket of disappointment… or more so pity. I kept in mind the time in case she didn’t seem to come out for a while.



I'd taken to keeping Narcan in the back lockers of the building, maybe it was my conscience or maybe it was the paperwork I'd have to fill out if someone overdosed in the building with me here but I'd become all too familiar with the little pink boxes.



It wasn’t too long before I was knocking on the door.



“Mrs. Rose. Everything okay in there?”



No response. I wish I still remembered her first name but that's all I had. I tried again.



“Mrs. Rose, I'm doing a wellness check, if you don't let me in I'm gonna have to unlock the door and come in myself.” I tried to sound professional but if I'm being honest with you all I had no clue what I was talking about.



Still nothing.



I fiddled with the keys in my belt loop struggling to find the one of thirty that was latched upon the rusted key chain. 



I unlocked and pushed open the door but it stopped with about 3 inches of space to see inside. 



I peered in upon the room and the decadent yellowed lights fell upon the speckled tile floors from the motion detector. I saw an arm fall over through the slit in the crack and a pool of thick and bubbling blood began to coat the cracks in the floor underneath it. 



I stood back a moment frightened, collected myself, and pushed with all my might to move her body from the door.



It took me a little longer than I'd like to admit but my shoes were wet from mopping the floors. As I pushed I tried for my phone in my back pocket quickly throwing the keys to the ground so that I could call the police with a free hand.

When I finally managed the door open enough to push my body through I wedged my body between the door and into the cramped family bathroom. 



I bent my head around the door to get a look at her and the damage. 



The same maddened eyes met my gaze and they were so filled with a glossy shine it took me a moment to realize she wasn’t even conscious. She stared at me with a wide smile, it was bent all out of shape and I could see the marks of tears that ran down her face but that fucken smile stayed. Her blood soaked teeth reeled the corner of her lips upwards with enough force that her face looked tightened in a painful tug.



The whole image started coming to me now. I could see her shirt now stained with blood and as I backed up and let the door close with the weight of her body I realized her hand that fell was covered in blood and some sort of weird tattoo or markings. I fumbled for the phone quickly glancing away from her eyes. I tried to move her body out of the way but she was heavier than she looked. By the time I cleared her out of the doorway I had finally got on the line with 911.



As soon as I heard the operator asking for the location of the emergency I heard a click from the other side of the door and…



That stupid fucking giddy laughter.



I tried at the handle but I knew what that noise was. I'd heard it a thousand times before. 



The Door was locked. My keys were outside with that freak and I could hear his bare feet on the tile as he gleefully skipped away.



I heard a faint muffled voice from the palm of my hand, I lifted it to my ear and responded to the operator on complete autopilot. The lady on the other side of the phone began to run me through the procedure but I'd done it before, I casted my phone aside on the now blood soaked floor and began with her pulse. 



Nothing.



I started chest compressions and kept looking up with every small noise her body might release but I just kept making eye contact with those fucking eyes. I knew she wasn’t conscious, shit I knew she wasn't alive but they just looked so intense… so. Scared. 



For the briefest of moments, about 15 minutes in I started having my doubts, I knew better then most the police wouldn’t do shit and the response time on a paramedic would be even greater. I tried not to let the thought get to me but I could feel it wavering on me. I tried to keep at the chest pumps and move my mind off it when I swear for a moment I heard something. I didn’t want to but I brought my eyes back to her gaze. I was lost in thought and my mind was racing… it could've been anything. I tried to look down again, to get back to it but something held me there, I couldn’t take my eyes off her. It wasn’t like some weird compulsion or worry, I could feel my neck tighten and strain as I tried to look away from her. I took a deep breath and closed my eyes for a moment, trying to force myself to relax. I was just starting to convince myself that things would work out when I heard a faint crackling. It took me a moment to realize it but the light buzzing noise was coming from the throat of Mrs. Rose. I held my breath too scared to open my eyes when I swear on my fucking life I heard her mutter.



“Hey… Kiddo…” 



The lights flickered in the room and even with my eyes still squeezed as tightly shut as possible I could tell the room was fading in and out. I felt frozen. It wasn’t just my neck now my whole body felt fuzzy and strained. 



I could hear more groaning, I could feel her chest slowly rising and vibrating from her diaphragm and I forced my body with all my might to move but all I could do was open my eyes. 



I wish I hadn’t, I forced them open with enough strain to pop a blood vessel and when I took another glance towards Mrs. Rose I saw her hands snap to my wrists that still laid on her chest. 



That was enough to free my brain from whatever sort of weird frozen panic I was in because I leapt back as hard as I could, barely freeing my hands from hers and kicking my legs out from underneath me. I slipped immediately on the puddles of blood that had formed all around us and as I did I felt the cold ceramic of the sink behind me crack into the back of my head. 



I was so dazed, a sudden wave of black enveloped my eyes and for a moment everything faded into a pool of black and red. I tried to force my eyes to come to, to focus, but in my fall I think I knocked something loose in my brain. 



My vision flashed and for a moment. I could see Mrs. Rose clearly in front of me again. Her smile fell from her face as she began to push herself to her feet. The pools of crimson blood that enveloped her began to bubble, no boil and a heavy heat fell over the room. She pushed herself up with her hands kneeling over me and as my eyes fell upon hers again she lunged forward chomping her teeth like a rabid dog. 



I blinked and recoiled back.



The room was as it was before.



I just sat there trying my hardest to look anywhere but at her body until the police arrived.



One tried CPR on her until the EMT’s would come to whisk her off. Well I talked with the other officer and caught him up to speed. I couldn't help but look and stare at her body moving limply with each compression.



It moved through no effort of her own being. Her arms might lift with each push upon her chest but they’d fall right back down in the same rhythmic pattern.



I’d known her. 



I still know her… and now she sat there 30 feet from me helpless well I could do nothing. Well they could do nothing. 



 It took me a moment but I saw the tattoo I had glanced at before when I first stepped in to help her, my eyes stopped from glazing over and I stole a better glance. They weren't tattoos, not at all…



They were bite marks. 



All up and down her arms from her biceps to her hands she was covered in bite marks. Some small blemishes, others so rough it tore all her skin leaving a gaping wound where the flesh used to be. The officer questioning me fell to a distant droning as I watched Mrs. Rose’s body bounce up and down again.



I looked at her eyes, a fading hue of the once deep rooted brown I remembered from when I was a kid. 



I watched as her lips grew a faint bluish hue. 



Then. Strangely.



I watched as a lump began to form in her throat.



For a moment I mistook it for a breath but hope faded quickly.



It slowly crawled its way up her neck like a slug with each push upon her chest until quickly and violently her body coughed up and splattered a red slime upon the chest and arms of the cop sitting over her. The skin, muscle and sinew of her arms lay mucous covered and dripping upon the officers vest. She was far past dead by the time she was pulled from the building.



Listen… there's a lot more about what happened tonight and I can't promise you’ll want to hear the rest of it but I’ll need to update anyone interested another time.



Working in a sketchy place alone for long enough you know to trust your gut when you get a bad vibe and right now something is sending my body into panic mode. The man on the roofs gone quiet. The radio in the cruiser went from a steady hum to complete. Dead. Silence. I think the sun will be coming up somewhat soon. The sky has that dark hazy indigo letting up at the beginning of dawn. It’s illuminating all the neighboring forests and marshlands in a hazy black silhouette. I think I can make out the shape of the sheriff towards the edge of the parking lot. I can't really tell if it's him but whoever it is they’ve just been staring the past few minutes. I'll catch you guys up another time… Until then, Wish me luck.
