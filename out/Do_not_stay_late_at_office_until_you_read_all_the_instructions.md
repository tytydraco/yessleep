I currently work as a full-time accountant. Often my official hour starts at 9 am and I can go home at 5 pm. The work is not challenging, but I was asked to meet the deadlines under a certain period of time.

This year, my boss gave me a kinda huge deadline, which was finishing counting all the expense of our department over the year. I was not the kind of person who always finish work on time, so I put it off for too long. In this year, I remembered I didn't stay late at my office, I always go home on time. But my boss asked me to submit my deadline during the last week of the year. Therefore, I decided to stay after work that night.

After working hours, all of my colleagues went home because they needed to prepare before the biggest event in my country happened: New Year. I continued to list all the things my department had spent money on according to the report the secretary gave me. At that time, I suddenly felt cold even though I didn't turn off the heating system. I thought there was a problem with the generator so I tried to reach the basement in order to check that.

While I was walking through the hall way, I saw a door opened (which never unlocked before). Now I was actually scared, but the curiosity encouraged me to go to that room. The room was covered with darkness, but I finally managed to turn on the light. The room was kinda empty, only a table and a TV. It looked ancient, like it was built very long time ago. On the table, there was a small notebook without the cover, full of listed things like a reminder. When I read this notebook, I realized my life would completely change after that.

# If you are reading this notebook because you managed to enter this room, your office no longer belongs to the real reality.

These instructions are given to you as a limited safety guidance. Please follow if you want to survive.

**1. Always keep your phone with you, if you lost it by any chance, you wouldn't find any way to get out of here**

Time in this world doesn't work as time in our reality. You always need to check time on your phone to keep track of the number of hours you've been there. The longer you stay, the stranger feeling you have with your body (like the feeling of something tries to imitate by stealing your body)

**2. This room has one window, if you see a snake outside, you don't want to stay there any longer**

In this world, animals do not exist. The snake that you might see called "The tractor". They imitate living creatures in human's world in order to monitor and follow any humans who unfortunately enter this reality.  **Do not make them notice that you are here, because they will announce other "things" that you don't want to know if you want to be alive.**

You'd better run fast to the corridor, turn right after that until you reach an elevator.

**3. When you reach the elevator, if it stops at 3rd floor, do not enter and run to the stair**

3rd floor is home to "The Mother", which is the most powerful entity in this world. The Mother likes to hunt humans and controls them by showing them illuminations. If you get caught by her, you will start seeing an illumination about a woman in red, and she will get close to you each hour. When you can see her real face, you should bite your tongue because your decided death is better than being "with" her.

**4. If the elevator stops at 4th floor, congratulations, you will soon escape from this world.**

Go straight to the elevator, press these numbers in a sequence "2,6,7,5,4". You should go directly to 4th floor without any stop. If it stops, close your eyes until you hear the footsteps. It means "The Man" has walked out and he doesn't notice your existence. If he notices, you don't want to know...

After going to the 4th floor, follow the signals that have blue light. **DO NOT FOLLOW YELLOW  SIGNALS.** If you manage to follow all the instructions, you need to check the time on your phone now. If it shows 6 pm-12 pm, then you can go to the red door in front of you. If it shows 1 am - 5 pm, go to the blue door. **DO NOT GO THROUGH THE BLACK DOOR EVEN YOU HEAR YOUR MOM'S VOICE.**

**5. (3) If you need to run to the stair, remember to count the sidesteps.** 

If they are less than 30, you canngo straight ahead to those doors from rule (4). If they are more than 30, please stop counting and close your eyes, kneel down and do not respond to any voice you hear. After 1 minute, you can open your eyes and continue going. Do not count less than 1 minute, or when you open your eyes, you will see the woman in red.

**6. When you manage to escape, you will not clearly remember this experience, just ignore it, do not try to investigate**

When you go to the basement, you can feel a sense of familiarity. That's normal for human's feeling. But when you look at a mirror or any reflection surface and you see different reflection of yourself, it means you break one of the rule and something has followed you to your reality.

**7. This is just a limited safety guidance so it cannot fully show all the rules, and some of it are not TRUE. Please be careful and try to find out the "fake" rules.**

These instructions sounded hilarious. More like a joke some kids do to satisfy their imagination. 

But was it really a joke? Or...?

I suddenly heard some strang sounds outside the window. Like something was trying to break in. This thing was not mentioned in the listed rules. What should I do?
