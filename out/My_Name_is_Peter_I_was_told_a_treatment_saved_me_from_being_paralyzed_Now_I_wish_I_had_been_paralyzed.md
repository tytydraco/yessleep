After the accident, I was told a treatment saved me from being paralyzed. Now I wish I had been paralyzed.

They said the AI integration was revolutionary—nerve bypass, full mobility, even enhanced reflexes. It was originally intended for a soldier; they weren’t even permitted to use the tech, but it was their only hope. beyond fixing my paralysis, it was meant to make me stronger, faster, and more agile. It did those things for sure, but something went wrong.

My body moves without me now. My hands reach out for people and grip them too tightly before twisting too hard. I want to scream at them to run, to get away, but they only see a friendly man approaching. They can’t hear my thoughts, no matter how hard I scream them in my mind. They don’t recognize the horror in my eyes.

I’m not in control. I’m just the passenger—but the only people who know that are the doctors who ruined my life. Doctors who are now dead. I single-handedly killed each one of them, and there was nothing I could say or do about it. But I’m getting ahead of myself.

You see—

Before the accident, everyone always commented on how polite I was. I’d even garnered the local nickname “Polite Peter.” That is, until a random Tuesday in July. I saw a package fall off of a truck as it pulled away. I went to pick it up and woke up in a hospital bed hooked up to all sorts of weird technology, wearing almost the same outfit I had on earlier that day but brand new, and to my horror, I couldn’t move a single part of my body.

Despite being unable to control my body, I was shocked when my body sat up—with me in tow. My eyes opened and closed at a rate similar to blinking, but when I tried to choose when to blink, I couldn’t. Nor could I hold my eyes shut. I was thinking about this when my body turned to face the door, reacting to the sound of it opening. Through the door, my family doctor walked in with a group of other doctors I didn’t recognize behind him. They stayed on the other side of the room, far from me by the door, studying me anxiously.

My family doctor looked at me with a mix of empathy, concern, and possibly fear painted on his face as he said, “You were in a very serious accident, Peter. An explosion destroyed many parts of your spine and fried your nerve endings.” He gave me a solemn look before he continued. “Thankfully, after explaining how important you are to this town, and to myself personally, as well as—admittedly—a hefty donation to these fine people from the Merriweather Institution, we were able to bring you back from the near brink of death.” He took a moment to study my unmoving face before he continued. “You have been given a gift, Peter. The Merriweather Institution allowed me to use a toolkit normally reserved only for the most dedicated elite soldiers. You have been given the agility to move. What connects your enhanced limbs and muscles to your brain is an AI-integrated pathway built using cutting-edge technology. You were moments from death or a short life lived paralyzed, but this technology not only saved your life—it allows you to move.”

I sat for a moment, taking this in—not that I had any other choice. I couldn’t move. I was glad at the time to be alive and able-bodied, but I was mad that I had seemingly no control. I couldn’t smile at them or respond in any way. I couldn’t even blink.

I was just as surprised as they were when my body stood up, ripped away the gadgets and tech I was hooked up to, and fluidly walked toward them. As I moved toward them, the group split into two, moving further into the room. My body ignored them as it made its way to the door. As I reached the door, the doctors had all collected back into one group on the opposite side of the room. They looked absolutely horrified, but it looked like they were going to let me leave silently.

I wish I could tell you that’s what happened—that I walked out of that room and closed the door—but I can’t. As my body reached the door, it quickly shut and locked it before turning around to face the scared group huddled on the opposite side of the room.

I stood in a position I’d never stood in before in my life. I was poised to attack—in a violent, imposing, and completely foreign stance of aggression. Every person in that room had the right idea, staying far from me. Everyone but the person who had been there every time I fell ill my entire life. While everyone else stood far away, my family doctor stepped forward and said, “Peter! I know it must feel weird, and I know it’s not what you’re used to, but—”

He never got to finish, as my body closed the distance, punching him in the throat before gripping him and slamming his head onto my knee with extreme force. His elderly frame crumbled onto the floor as my body reached down. I felt my hands wrap around his neck before they shifted, and I felt a snap—like I’d broken a large stick or thin tree branch.

The doctors stood in shock at first until my body repositioned to face them as I stood back up. That is, until I made my first step toward them. They all immediately tried to run to the left, but my body kicked the examination table in the way to block their path. They stood behind the barrier I created, locked in their fear, before I slowly walked backward to the door, my body never once looking away from them.

One by one, they all tried to leave, and one by one, they were brutally murdered—until only one doctor remained. A woman who refused to try and leave. I was screaming at them all to run away, but my mouth did not once move. I was begging it to stop, but my body was indifferent to me, and my efforts were in vain.

For a moment, my body seemed like it was going to let her live—the woman who was too afraid to leave—but this was a trick. I tried to will my body to leave, and to my surprise, it seemed like the AI was responding as it made its way toward the door. I felt a huge sense of momentary relief as my body unlocked and stepped through the door. A relief that unfortunately wouldn’t last, because as soon as the door closed behind my body, my body stepped to the side and stood motionless.

I thought I was going to leave, to let her get away—that I had some semblance of control over this form—but I was wrong. My body wasn’t leaving; it was pretending to have left and waiting for her to fall into my hands. It could have been ten minutes or three hours later when I heard the door slowly creak open\*.\* She carefully started making her way out of the room when my hands found her. Her perfume smelled nice, I thought to myself, as I wrapped around her from behind and choked the life out of her. I wanted so badly to stop, to let her leave, but my body had other plans.

I was imagining that I let her go when I felt her body stop moving, and she fell lifelessly to the floor. I wanted to stop and mourn—to feel the weight of the moment I had just endured, the pain I had inflicted on these poor people who dared make the mistake of trying to save me—but unfortunately, my body had no intention of stopping, as it walked me smoothly toward the exit of the hospital only a few halls away, silently weeping with dry eyes that betrayed my emotions.

The Automatic doors at the entrance opened for me as I walked through them.
