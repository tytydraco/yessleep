Hey guys. I’m writing this out of, confusion? I thought maybe you “kind strangers” could help me out. 

My newlywed and I just drove cross country, from Alabama, to a small town in the Rockies. It’s officially called Grant, but everyone online and in the town likes to call it Wolf Wind Pass. The place is small, like, you know everyone and everyone knows you, small. Less than 500 people, I think. Either way, it’s picturesque, peaceful, and Samantha (F23) was in love from the moment we opened the door to our new home.

It’s a new age cottage, or, maybe a lodge, whatever it’s called, in the middle of the clearing on the mountains overlooking the town. The road up to it isn’t dangerously long or steep, it’s a bumpy paved road to the halfway point, then a dirt road the rest of the way up. Being careful, it’s a 6 minute ride up. 

Anyway, enough with the TLC TV, and onto what I’m here about.

As we moved our stuff in two days ago, we were looking around, and noticed, there was a cellar out back. It was below the guest bathroom window. I went to open it, like a dumbass I imagined it was unlocked. It wasn’t, of course. The skeleton key didn’t work on it, either. I called a local locksmith, and he said he’d send a kid up to check it out, and make me a key for it.

Well, this morning, I watched a white GMC rolls up into my “yard” (the few areas cut down around the house that are overgrown with moss). A younger dude, maybe 17,  in a cowboy hat, a pair of boot cuts, and wearing a tool rig that was a size too big, crawled out of his truck, and I mean crawled, as he was around 5’5 and maybe 130 pounds soaked in butter. 

“Hey there, names Clay.” He introduced himself. We talked for a bit about guns, hunting, best places I should try in town, the fixins. I won’t bore you guys with that stuff. 

He came with the key that was apparently in a safe deposit box belonging to the past owners. I prodded for a question or two,

“Where’d they up and go?” I asked, trying to seem as innocently curious as possible.

“Oh hell, man. They were some cooky folks. A middle aged couple, and a few kids. The parents were like, the ultra religious type, yknow? Catholics I suppose.” Clay answered. “I wouldn’t reckon you’re no catholic, huh Mr. Montgomery?” He said, mocking my accent a bit.

“Ah,” I chuckled, “yeah, uh me and my wife just moved from the Gulf.”

“Big change, huh?” He asked.

“Yeah, but it’s a good change of pace from Alabama. Things got ridiculous down there between personal matters and some uh, less than desirable career shifts.” I answered him. I was a Lineman for a local power company back home, but I had accepted a job as an Engineering TA at the local highschool while I finished my diploma online. 

Anyway, I walked him back around the house to the cellar. 

“So, what did happen to the last owners?”

“The dad got onto some rant in town pretty much every day. He’d go down into the square and shout about ‘Heretics’ this, ‘Purge’ that.” 

“Like, some doomsday cult stuff?”

“Yeah, we jokingly called him ‘Little David’, and his family ‘The Branch Peterians’” he paused for a second, “Yeah, Francis and Amy Peterson.”

“So, did they leave?”

“Basically run off.” He answered. “Only so many times you can do that in a small town and keep a reputation.”

He let me put the key into the cellar’s keyhole and turn. It was almost rust-welded shut. I put my full strength into the key as i turned it, until finally it gave way and turned the lock. The doors pushed cold, damp air out at my face as the metal doors pushed themselves up.

I winced at the sudden blast of air, but then gathered myself and grabbed the handles, pulling them the rest of the way up.

Immediately inside was about 4 steep concrete steps that took the cellar down to a slightly low ceiling, I’d have to crouch, but Clay could probably do jumping jacks in there just fine. 

“Welcome to the roaring 2020s,” I remarked. I reached into my pocket and grabbed a pen light. It was weak, but it helped me see that at the bottom of the stairs, there was a chain on the roof for the light. I descended the stairs slowly and carefully, nearly rolling my ankle on a dark and viscous stain of black goop. “Gross.”

Clay followed me down.

Upon flicking on the light, I saw 3 main things.

The first, wooden barrels and crates labeled with various names of everything from “Ammo” to “Honey”. The barrels were all the same soft birch color underneath years of dust. 

The second thing I saw was a wine cabinet. It was an *old* cabinet, maybe from the 30s or 40s. It had ornate finishings now clearly marred by almost 100 years of wear.

The last thing sent a nervous chill down my spine as I studied it. It was a large chest, maybe 2 feet long and 2 feet wide, and about 1 and a half feet tall. It was wooden, with black iron ribbings on it. The most peculiar part was the strange symbols covering its surface. They looked almost like some kind of symbolic tattoos, very similar in design to those fish stickers white baptist moms put on their minivans. 

Atleast, that was the most peculiar part.

“Woah, that’s pretty rad.” Said Clay, awestruck at the ornate designs of the chest. 

“Yeah it’s uh, it’s something.” I walked a bit closer to inspect it, but Clay immediately was next to the box. “Hey, be careful dude.” I heeded him.

“Pshh, of course.” He reached his hand around to the back of the chest, heaved with all his might, and turned the lock towards me.

We both stared at it in confusion. There were several pads and locks holding the lid down. The most interesting part was that all the locks had something scrawled or printed into the metal. A few were in English, but the rest were in Spanish, or, Portuguese? I’ll put some of the English ones below:
1. “To keep the promise of God maintained, keep this ambition retained”
2. “No fight to great”
3. “For all the glory and honor of God”
4. “Face no evil”
5. “Conquer for Man”

This stuff doesn’t make sense, and I’m hoping you guys more versed in language and history than me can decipher this. For now, me and Clay lifted the thing up the stairs, and set it in the shed on the edge of the grass area of the yard, before the moss begins and about 10 yards from the woods, so that my wife doesn’t see it. We are planning on opening it later, maybe tomorrow afternoon.

Any ideas of what we should do as far as safety precautions for mold or some illnesses would be great, and anyone who can tell me the exact meaning of “Obsigna hoc infernum, quia non inclinabit voluntatem meam ad roborandam Dei potentiam” would be my new favorite redditor, till tomorrow, I suppose.
