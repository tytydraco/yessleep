im not gonna sugar coat this with a drawn out intro before I start. this is some serious life and death shit and I don’t know how much longer I have so I’ll get to it. 

My names Larson McCoy and I needed a vacation. somewhere far away from the states. I mean out of all the grand 52 states I got stuck in suburban Missouri. So when a coworker got me an all inclusive Himalayan hiking pass I was practically jumping out of my skin to get on a plane. 

It was good for 4 days; January 18-22. I only had 2 days to get ready but they felt like 2 hours with all my energy. On the day of my departure flight i got an overwhelming sense of dread. This usually happens since im extremely introverted but this time im going by myself so human interaction would be limited. But the more i gathered my things and got closer to leaving for the airport, the deeper and heavier the pit in my stomach got. I wasn’t gonna let my stupid fear of being socially active ruin it for me this time. I closed my eyes, took a deep breath and pushed myself out the door. i wish i stayed home. oh god for the chance to sleep in my own bed one last night. 

The flights to Nepal were excruciating. I was so jet lagged when I touched down I almost walked straight off the loading ramp that most definitely would have ended in a one way trip back home. I grabbed all my luggage from the carousel and walked outside where i took an airport tram straight to the resort. It wasn’t your typical glamorous resort though. It looked almost ancient. I hate to make the comparison but it gave me border line Shanghai-la zombies map vibes. There was only one attendant and he looked as old as the main resort building. 

“This place is kinda old for an “all-inclusive resort experience “- I said jokingly. He just looked at me confused with an eye brow half raised. 

“Uhhh English?” i said extremely awkwardly. He lowered his eyebrow and a look of realization covered his face.

“Small English” the man said to me with a confident smile. in that moment i realized i hadn’t prepared for the language barrier at all and the same sense of dread filled my stomach again.

“Is this the resort? I don’t see any rooms.” i said. It just came to me that I hadn’t seen a single suite or in that case inhabitant at all. The place was completely dead. 

“You have pass?”- the old man said with a hint of concern. I reached into my backpack side pocket pulled the pass out and handed it to him.  He examined the small crinkled paper for a minute then a small flicker of joy showed in his eye. It was barely a glint. I could see that the corners of his mouth raised slightly for a millisecond then dropped back into serious mode. 

“You get cabin. We take you. Wait now”- the man said in broken English.  I waited about 10 minutes before the man shuffled over stiffly but this time with a younger man probably in his 30s. 

“You got all your things ready to move?” the young man said. 

I felt relief washed over me when I heard that sentence. Easy communication was still possible.

“Yes sir it’s all with me.”

“Alright. Follow me and let me know if you need a hand with the bags.”  I picked up all my shit and trudged behind him trying not to drop anything. 

“Have safe stay”- the old man said as I was almost out of the door, the slightest hint of amusement in his voice. 

“Is he okay?” I said to the young man gesturing with my head back to the older man. 

“He’s just old. Been around the wringer. Seen some shit that most people couldn’t handle but that’s most old folks around here. You got a name?”

“Larson- I said semi sheepishly- Im from the States if you couldn’t tell. What’s your name?” 

“My names Dhruva.” He said shortly. 

During all the awkward small talk we got to what looked like a giant monster truck with fog lights on top. He helped me load everything into the bed and we climbed in the cab. 

“Does your name mean anything?” I said cautiously trying not to sound offensive. 

“It means immovable and stable. My family put great trust in me as a boy so that’s the name they saw fit.” 

I usually don’t admit when someone has “out manlied” me but I felt incredibly intimidated when that sentence left his mouth. So much so I didn’t speak another word as we drove through the snow, away from the office and into the trees beginning a 4 day long isolation. When we got to the cabin I was shocked at how well maintained it was compared to the main office.

“Do people stay out here a lot?” I asked as we started unloading all my crap.  

“Usually in the summer. People don’t like how cold and dark it gets up here in the winter” 

I guess I had a nervous look on my face because Dhruva quickly said “ Don’t worry I come up twice a day to make sure you have firewood and that your electric and water still work.” 

“That makes me feel a thousand times better” I said after a long breath of relief. Just then a question jumped into my brain. As he turned to head back to his truck I blurted out-

“Where’s the ski lift? Is there anyone else staying at the resort with me?” 

He turned around almost as if that question was painful to hear and even more painful to answer-

“I’ll be back in an hour or so. Take that time to settle in. There’s a landline in the cabin if you decide you want to wait longer. When im back I’ll take you to the lift lodge. Welcome to the Himalayan’s.”  He gave a short wave started his truck up and then he was gone. 

this is where shit gets fucked real quick. I’ll split my days up into different parts so it’s easiest to digest. 

Day 1 

The next morning I woke up feeling hopeful and nauseous. Bits and pieces of the previous evening came back to me as I looked at the piece of paper with a phone number on it. Then it hit me. I went to the the ski lodge. I met some people around my age. I got fucking hammered. Someone gave me their landline number but I couldn’t quite remember their name. I immediately grew concerned because I never get hang overs. I chalked it up to Nepal having elephant killing liquor and shook off the uneasy feeling. 

I got out of bed and started to get ready for my day. As I was getting dressed I realized my watch had stopped working. I didn’t pay attention to much because that hangover had murderous intent. I walked out the front door while zipping up my 5th layer of coats and then stopped dead in my tracks. It was dark out. No sounds of wildlife in the forrest. Just me, the trees and darkness. I walked back inside confused and extremely unsettled. I take all my layers off and sit on the cabin bed with the phone number in my hand. I went over to the land line and punched the numbers in. I waited and waited but the line rung out. I set the phone down and went back over the the bed and sprawled on my back. 

“Of course I sleep through a whole fucking day of vacation” I groaned as I put my hand over my face. I checked around for my phone but after 15 or so minutes of looking I couldn’t find it. With the hangover still throbbing in my cranium and nausea creeping back into my stomach I laid back down, pulled all the covers over me and went back to sleep.

Day 2

I woke up to a bright light flooding the cabins front window. It was damn near blinding. I shot out of my bed and almost killed myself tripping over the heap of clothes I threw on the ground the night before. I splitting pain shot through my head and I vommited all over the floor. As I was finishing my heaving I noticed the light start to slowly fade away. I ran to the window holding back my stomach when I felt my heart drop into the acid below it. the sky was still pitch black. There was still no noise. This didn’t make any sense I just saw light why the fuck is it still dark out I thought to myself exasperated. I quickly clothed myself trying not to hurl again. I grabbed the flashlight I packed and stormed outside. 

“Tire tracks?” I said half question half answer. I followed them down the gradual mountain until about 4 or 5 fallen trees blocked the rest off from me. 

“what the fuck.” it was the quietest most fear induced sentence I ever uttered. These trees were about 30 feet tall and at least 8 feet thick. There was no storm. No avalanche. Something put these hear. Im trapped. I sprinted back to my cabin and locked my door while simultaneously pulling down the window blinds. I rushed to the phone and dialed the only number I had as fast as I could. It rang out again. I called again. This time I heard something. It was barely a sound but it was something. I set the phone on the small kitchen table and wandered around the cabin searching for the source of mystery sound. I was by the window when I heard the noise again. 

“No that’s not possible it’s literally fucking impossible”- I said desperately grasping for straws. I called the number again and waited by the window. I threw open the front door and stared up the giant rocky cliff side as all the feeling and color drained from my body.  Way up the mountain I could hear the faint sound of a phone ringing. I didn’t sleep that night.

Day 3 

I was a paranoid wreck. Why hadn’t Dhruva come and checked on me yet? Why is it so dark still? Where the fuck is everybody? I stood up from the corner I had tucked myself in and felt my head throb again. I let out a load groan and felt the back of my head. The hair on the back of my head was crusty and stiff. I pulled my hand back in front of myself to see what it was but nothing was on my hand. Considering my predicament this was the least of my worries. 

I went to the bathroom to turn the shower on but when I turned the handle nothing happened. I went to the sink and had to same result: nothing. I went to turn my lights on and again nothing happened. this obviously added a whole new layer of fear to my psyche but this was something I could somewhat manage. Using my flashlight I went back towards the bed where my bags were to see if I packed my travel wipes. I noticed a dark stain on my pillow that caused me to shine the light on it. I burst into tears not just from the sight of my blood but the flood of memories. The ski resort lodge. The bar. The people. But this time I remembered something else. I remember stepping outside for some air when I saw Dhruva with a thick tree branch in my peripheral vision. I dropped to my knees due to the sheer gravity of my situation when I had the primal feeling that I was being watched. 

I crept to the window and split the blinds with my fingers to make a tiny gap. I scanned the Forrest as best I could but I found nothing. I was about to return to my cower corner when I heard a sound that alerted every fight or flight response in my body. I heard a branch snap.  But instead of looking down I looked up into the endless height of thick dead trees and screamed a scream only wild animals should make. About 15 feet into the trees I saw a man’s face. The white matted hair only seemed to bring out the giant black pits it had for eyes. About 9 feet next it was a giant hand gripping a tree the size of a red oak almost entirely. 

at the sound of my shriek, the giant took off threw the woods as I heard branches being snapped and falling to the powdery snow. I stayed frozen in shock for what felt like hours not able to move. Fear, pity, sadness, anger and every other negative emotion filled my brain all at once overloading me into uncontrollable sobs. As the adrenaline wore off and exhaustion started to set in, the last thing I remembered before falling asleep was the sound of my sobs filling the cabin. 

Day 4

I woke up to a sound that almost made me explode with joy. Birds chirping. I jolted up to see that the sun had finally stopped hiding from me. I threw open the door not even caring about my clothes and stood on the front porch. Something felt off though. The mountain seemed closer than before. 

“I could give less of a fuck. Get me the hell out of here” I said to myself gathering my things as quickly as I could. Then I stopped packing and remembered the trees in the road. I tore open the door and rushed to the part of the blocked off road and started in horror. It’s not a blockade anymore. It’s a wall of twisted and dead wood rising taller than any natural made blockade. I walked briskly back to the cabin with wide eyes constantly scanning the  trees where I saw that giant horrible face. I didn’t know if seeing it would make me feel better or worse. I’d know at least I wasn’t going crazy.  

When I got back to the cabin I stopped. The door was open. I looked to the ground and shoved my hand in the snow and dug around until I found a decent shape defense rock. I cautiously stepped into the cabin where I saw nothing out of the ordinary except a peice of paper with a phone number on it. It was different this time though. The area code wasn’t even the same. I dialed the number and listened while it rang. Finally someone picked up. 

“Hello? Please can you help me something is so fucked here!” I basically shouted at the phone. Luckily I thought to bring my laptop with me in one of my carry ons or else I would have been fucked for translations. This is what was said to me on the phone to me in Nepali-

“With this I grant you your prize Old One the wait is over you may consume” *short pause* “I hope you enjoyed your stay at the Himalayans.” (in perfect English) then the line went dead. I had to remember all of that  and type it into a computer based on visuals so im sorry if that “translation” is terrible but it was the best I could do. 

Deciding to put one last effort into finding  at least the smallest of clues to what is going on in these barren woods. I decided to walk around the cabin and get a decent idea of what the perimeter is like. What I found almost killed me on the spot. The plumbing was ripped from the ground and all the electrical was split and frayed. But someone didn’t dig them up. They were pulled apart. Something was moving this fucking cabin while I was in it. 

I go back inside and immediately call the number again. This time I heard the ringing from the mountain. I sprinted to the side of the mountain when I tripped and almost snapped my ankle. I sat there in the cold soft snow as I felt my pants and leg start to feel wet and warm the snow around me turning a pastel yellow. I tripped and fell into a giant footprint in the snow. Not just one a whole set of them leading from the edge of the forest where I saw the face to the side of the mountain. I looked up at the sheer angle of the rocky slope and shivered. I practically crawled my way back into the cabin until a few hours ago. 

It’s dark again but it’s not silent. It’s as if the cabin is alive tonight. So many creaks and groans like it’s trying to talk to me. Rocks are falling down the mountain. At first I thought it was weather. Then the rocks started hitting the side of the cabin facing the cliff side when I realized- something is climbing down.

I don’t know if I’ll ever be found or if anyone will hear my story but if you do don’t come looking. Don’t send help. Stay the fuck out of the Himalayas.
