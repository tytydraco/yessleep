I never meant for it to happen. The first time, I was just tired—tired of her constant nagging, tired of the way she looked at me with those accusing eyes. “You never listen to me,” she said, her voice dripping with disappointment. I snapped. In a fit of rage, I grabbed the kitchen knife and plunged it into her chest. Her eyes widened in shock, but then they went blank. I felt a rush of relief wash over me.

But that relief was short-lived. The next morning, I woke up to the smell of coffee brewing. I stumbled into the kitchen, and there she was, humming a tune, completely unaware of what had happened. “Good morning, honey! Did you sleep well?” she asked, her smile brightening the room. My heart raced as I recalled the night before. “You... you’re alive?” I stammered.

“Of course, silly! Why wouldn’t I be?” she laughed, oblivious to the horror I had just unleashed. I shook my head, trying to process it. I had killed her, yet here she was, as if nothing had happened.

Days turned into weeks, and the cycle continued. Each time I killed her, she came back, her memory wiped clean. “Why do you look so pale?” she asked one evening, concern etched on her beautiful face. I couldn’t bring myself to answer. Instead, I clenched my fists, the urge to silence her again bubbling beneath the surface.

One night, I decided to try something different. I wanted to see how far I could push it. “Maybe if I strangle her,” I thought, “it will be different this time.” I crept up behind her as she washed the dishes, and with a swift motion, I wrapped my hands around her throat. She gasped, her eyes wide with confusion. “What are you doing?” she managed to choke out before I squeezed tighter.

As her body went limp, a sick thrill coursed through me. But when I awoke the next day, she was sitting on the couch, flipping through a magazine. “Hey, you! You scared me last night!” she teased, a playful grin on her face. “You just disappeared after dinner. I thought you were going to help me with the laundry!”

I felt a mix of anger and despair. “Don’t you remember?” I shouted, my voice cracking. “I killed you! I've killed you over and over!” The words hung in the air, heavy and suffocating. She looked at me, confusion washing over her features. “What are you talking about? You’re scaring me.”

I couldn’t take it anymore. “I have to end this,” I thought, my mind racing. I grabbed a heavy object from the table and swung it at her head. The sickening crack echoed through the room. She collapsed, and for a moment, I felt victorious. But once again, the next day, she was back. “Morning, honey” she smiled , rubbing her head. “I made breakfast.”

I was trapped in this nightmare, a twisted game I could never win. Each time I killed her, I felt the thrill, but it was always followed by the crushing weight of reality. No matter what I did, she would return, blissfully unaware of my sins. 

“Why can’t you just stay dead?” I screamed one night, my voice breaking. She looked at me, hurt and confused. “What’s wrong with you?” she whispered. 

It was a twisted cycle, one that left me more hollow with every act yet here I was picking up the knife once again.
