Okay, so… My Mum has been working as a cleaner in Mayfair for this guy named Jared for about five years. It started off fine, just typical rich people being demanding. But lately, things have gotten really creepy.

Last year Jared got together with his new boyfriend, Steven, and the guy is just… off. Like, my mum was in the middle of hoovering when Stephen asked her to make a coffee. No big deal, she did it and went back to work. When she came back into the kitchen, there was coffee all over the counter- liked the entire cup poured over the counter. Stephen said it was an accident, but then when my mum went to clean it up, he just stood there watching her and then he started laughing at her, like it was a joke.

A few weeks later, Stephen took Jared on this cruise, and when they got back my mum was going through their suitcases to do the laundry. One of the shirts had this big reddish brown stain on it, all down the front. Jared said it was wine, but when my mum went to clean it she had to use hydrogen peroxide to get it out, which is what she usually uses for, like, period stains. Major red flag for me, but my mum just brushes it off saying she’s had to clean worse. Then it got really scary. Jared said he needed to show her something in the bathroom. When she got there, Stephen is there too and they’re asking her why she didn’t clean the mirror. The thing is, she definitely had. Like, it was clearly totally spotless, but he kept insisting it was filthy. She’s used to people like that wanting things a certain way, so she said she was fine to clean it again. The guys left and shut the door and she cleaned the mirror, again. But then, when she finished and tried to leave, the door was locked. From the outside. Like- who even has a lock on the outside of the bathroom door? She shouted for them and banged on the door for at least an hour, but nobody came. She said she was pretty sure they could hear her, and she even thought she could hear them laughing at one point. She didn’t have her phone or anything and she was really scared. There is a window to the courtyard, too small to climb through but she opened it and started shouting for help. Almost immediately Stephen was there to open the door. He told her she was an idiot for locking herself in and that she was lucky he’d found her before they’d gone out for the evening.

Now Stephen has suggested that my mum go with them on their next trip- somewhere in Europe. She really doesn’t want to but now Jared’s insisting. I told my mum she should quit, like yesterday. But she’s worried about getting another job without a recommendation. I get it, but seriously, this situation is way too creepy to stick around.
