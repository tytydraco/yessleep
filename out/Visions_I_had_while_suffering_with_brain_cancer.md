I was teaching a fifth-grade class when I felt a stabbing pain in my eye, like the back of my eye socket was being pulled by a fish hook. I collapsed halfway through explaining what sedimentary rocks were. A bad day for me, but a worse day for all the eleven year old children I left screaming.

Tests came in, and worst came to worse, it was a peanut sized tumor in my occipital lobe. Some days I wouldn't be able to get up because of the pain, some days I couldn't feel a thing but was completely blind. If I wasn't bed ridden I couldn't think straight enough to drive, so I retired at 27.

My parents took me back into my childhood home. My mom was broken between the joy of having me around and parting with her sewing room that she graciously gave back to me as my bedroom. I offered to stay on the couch, but she wouldn't let me. Bless her soul.

We moved out of this house when I was fifteen, and my parents only moved back in once me and my sister were out on our own, so I hadn't been in this house for something like twelve years. My parents weren't the type that would do their own home improvement and clearly the interim owners didn't either, cause behind my bed I found a lot of my old drawings directly on the wallpaper.

The giant Groudon stomping on a car would have made me about eight or nine. There was a drawing of myself on a motorcycle, shooting at the Groudon and smoking a cigarette. I could tell it was me because I always drew myself with a big scar over my eye, like Anakin from Revenge of the Sith (and I was a lot thinner). Near the corner of the wall was another drawing of me, but standing next to a door. It was separated by a foot of no marks or anything, all on its own. 

That night, I took a whole lot of questionably sourced pain meds to get to sleep (A retired teacher's salary can't afford anything better, fuck the US). The ceiling started to spin as I drifted to sleep. But more started to spin--my ass. I bumrushed to the bathroom in a haze like a fat monkey on a slip-n-slide of snakes, finally hoisting my hips up off the ground and onto the can.

I was there for what felt like forever, but I couldn't go. The room was spinning less so I decided to try and sleep. Walking back down the hall bedroom, a large brown door stood in contrast to the off-white walls. I hadn't noticed it, but I had only been there for half a day and never went down to that bathroom. I thought 'maybe the other owners added an extra door to the living room?' That's where it would go, anyway. I decided to take it so I could sleep on the couch.

My eyes were pounding with pain and I felt my vision going. That and the pain killers made it feel like I was being translated forward without having to walk. The door opened on its own, and I went through.

On the other side was the same hallway, but I was flipped? As in, the door I came through was behind me, and I was walking back down the hall from where I came. The lights were all turned on, too. The carpet felt like alpaca fur, and smelled like it came right from the hardware store. The sconces were all dusted and it felt really fresh, almost too fresh, like it was sanitized for an open house. I wouldn't ever say it sober, but I definitely muttered "oh God, bad jujujuh..." I was really messed up at that point.

I walked down the hall and back around to the kitchen. Everything was missing. All the pots and pans, the knives, and even the oven was ripped out, leaving a pristine cement slab where it would be. But on the counter sat a lone pack of Newports. My mom had quit smoking when I was really young, but I sure remember that she got Newports. It was half empty, and ripped on the lip. I left it there.

A gust of frigid wind wafted in from the open backdoor. I slid it open another few inches to get outside. I was met with a completely flat horizon of rustling grass in the wind and dark clouds in the distance illuminated from below by towering... things. Bugs or spiders, stretched up to the height of sky scrapers. They were straight out of Star Wars. They walked on four thin limbs, holding up a relatively small, canoe shaped body with a spotlight hanging off it. The light seemed to scan the grasses as they grazed endlessly. Down in the brush was my childhood bike. A real bad trip, man. I walked back in and to the living room.

The couch sat in the center of the room, right where it usually would be, but without the TV and futons and stuff. I was too loopy, too tired, too freaked out. I slumped over on the couch.

I woke up in my bed, and my bowels still quaked.

After taking care of that, I walked down the same hall as earlier and, lo and behold, no door. I collected my wallet and phone and headed to the living room, where my parents were standing by the TV. It took me a few seconds to notice the couch was gone.

They asked me if I had moved it, and I said no. My mom had her hands in her hair and my dad huffed with his arms folded. It felt stupid, but I told them about my dream.

"This again?" my mom puttered.

They told me how I used this same excuse as a kid when I lost my bike and stole my mom's cigarettes. I genuinely couldn't remember this happening and they didn't really care at the time, but now they are mad as hell. They're saying I'm childish for doing this and "pretending" I don't know what's happening. They eventually threw me out of the room, and I pouted much like I did as a child. My head throbbed while I binged Markiplier videos into the night. 

I dozed off once more and found myself on the couch again. The freezing air bit at my fingers, and I got up to realise I was outside. The house was no where to be seen. A few yards behind me, I heard a mashing sound on the grass. One of the spider creatures stepped forward and its search-light shone onto me. Clear viscous drops fell from the light and splattered on the ground. I couldn't convince my body to run. From under its belly, it extended a long, fleshy tentacle toward me. On the end was something of a mouth filled with tiny teeth that shimmered like fish scales.

The wet muscle rested on my shoulder and the mouth attached to the back of my head. That's when I woke.

My headache was gone, and the scans show that the tumor was gone. I'm back to teaching a month later. I don't know what happened and those dreams stopped entirely, I think it was maybe a form of my subconsious fighting the cancer. I don't know. Rant over.
