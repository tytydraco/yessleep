It was a cold and dark winter morning, the fog was heavy and the sky dark. It was early when a bright light emitted from the sky. Soon after I got a text from my friend, “holy shit dude get to town right now”. I thought it was odd that he asked for me to come to town so early but there was a sense of urgency in the text I couldn’t ignore. I pulled on some clothes and hopped in my old beat up pick up truck.

I hit the road around four thirty in the morning. The fog made it hard to see more than a few feet ahead of me. Towns about twenty minutes out from my house. I would have crashed into the damn thing if I didn’t slam on the breaks. In front of me lied an angel, it was around 30 feet away, hardly illuminated by my headlights. Wings fully extended, floating about a foot above the ground. It looked.. beautiful. Long silky hair and beautiful clear skin.. it had a warm yellowish white glow emitting from it.. It had long white robes.. with.. blood stains.. and behind it.. I had to resist the urge to throw up.. there was a managled corpse of one of my neighbors.. I barely could recognize the corpse because of how mangled it was… parts of his body’s had been ripped out in chunks.. bite marks lined the body.. this was no angel.. 

I didn’t even have to think.. my foot found my way to the pedal and I slammed it.. I hit it hard.. it let out a loud horrifying screech.. it laid there limp on the ground.. I immediately went to the back of my truck and desperately hoped that I had my hunting rifle.. I let out a sigh of relief as I pulled it out.. I returned to the angel and unloaded a single shot into its head.. the screeching stopped.. whatever that thing it was not an angel.. 

I got back in my truck and made my way to town.. as I get closer I heard a loud beautiful chorus.. it was horrifying.. it didn’t cover the screams.. A cacophony of screams emitted from the center of town.. I came right in time. The excitement in the air was palpable.. I tried to warn them, I yelled out.. it was to late.. The looks of joy and excitement morphed into abstract horror.. all of them.. children, families, everyone that had gathered in town square.. People I had known.. People I had loved.. Brutally ripped up by the angels.. they were no angels. There was nothing holy about what they did there.. 

After they had murdered the last of them they dispersed.. the official statement was that there was an oil explosion.. but I know what happened. It was no explosion.. it was a wolf in sheep’s clothing. Whatever those.. things.. were are still out there.. in the woods, lurking, waiting for another opportunity. Sometimes I think I see them in the shadows.. watching.. waiting..
