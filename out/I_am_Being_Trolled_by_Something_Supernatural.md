I am Being Trolled by Something Supernatural  
Part: 1  
My name is James Killian and I witnessed something that no human is supposed to see. For some background, I am 24 years old and I still live with my parents, (and yes that fact has impacted my dating life). We live in the suburbs of a city that I am not going to give, mainly because I have already given you my name. Luckily, I don't use social media for a reason I will explain shortly, however if you do look me up, there are several people with the same name. So good luck finding which one is really me.   
	  
Anyway, since being a college dropout and having wealthy parents, I never felt the need to go out and accomplish anything for myself. Yes I know that this is actually a fairly sad life, but for me to explain what happened and what I saw, I have to share some of my personal life, even if it risks disappointing my parents even more than I already have.   
	  
A typical day for me consists of waking up at around 5:30 in the afternoon and going to the skatepark for a few hours, afterwards I will come home and piss away time by watching Youtube and Netflix until the early hours in the morning. Despite listening to my ex-girlfriend explain that I was “sleeping my life away” or “not really living”, I have become happy with my carefree pampered world. What is there not to like? I get to sleep in my parents' 6 bedroom house and make all the micro transactions that I want to.   
	  
Well, now you know the jist of my life, and don't bother correcting me that this “isn't really a life”, I have heard that enough already. I have also seen most of the people I went to highschool with graduate and start their careers. For this reason I have deleted all social media and am posting this story here.   
	  
So all of this began in June. It was a fairly typical day for me, or night I should say. I was sitting at my laptop binge watching a Netflix show when I heard a loud rumble. Considering that I heard this noise even while wearing Beats Studios, I checked my weather app on my phone to see if there was a storm coming, suspecting that the rumble was probably just thunder. This irritated me because I knew our Dachshund Zoey would have a panic attack if there was a storm and I would have to listen to her pant and moan all through the night. But upon checking the app, I saw clear skies with no wind. Even though this was weird, I chalked it up to my parents slamming their bathroom door. Either way it sure as hell wasn't enough to stop me from my nightly Netflix marathon.  
	  
Fast forward to a few hours before sunrise, I pause my show to go take a leak, refill my vape, and grab another La Croix. However, upon reaching my bathroom I noticed that something was off. There was a light illuminating from the outside window into my bathroom even though the blinds were down. All around the window was a strange glow that looked as if it were daylight outside. I should also mention that my bathroom overlooks my backyard and then a field for over a mile until it reaches a highway that is out of sight. My bathroom is also on the third floor of the house.   
	  
Not wanting to alert anyone or anything that was lighting up my backyard to me by turning on what was surely the only light in the house, I slowly walked on across the pitch black bathroom toward the window producing the only light I could see. Once at the window I slowly lifted one section of the blind and looked outside. What I saw out there has been scorched into my mind ever since.   
	  
In the middle of my yard stood an extremely tall and thin black figure. Around this figure was a type of glow, like whatever it was had a spotlight pointed at it. I also literally mean whatever this was, because this was not a human. The type of blackness that this skinny figure was made of, resembled those Youtube videos you see demonstrating vantablack. Even when surrounded by an unseen beam of light, this figure sucked all the color out of everything. Even more horrifying was that this figure had absolutely no facial features or clothes. My mind immediately went to that corny story about Slenderman, however this thing was missing the suit and the white head.   
	  
I can confidently say that this thing couldn't see me from three stories below and through a small sliver in the blinds. However, as I stood watching for some time, it began to sway. The best way to describe this movement was like a twig blowing in the breeze. And then the unexplainable happened.   
	  
In a quick, explosive, and ungraceful way, this figure got up on its tiptoes and started marking time. Raising one foot up until the knee was parallel to the ground, the figure hopped from right foot to left. It would have been impossible for any human to do this, unless they were wearing some kind of ballerina shoe or risking breaking their ankles.   
The movement of this thing's legs was the only way I could accurately tell which direction it was facing.   
After about 30 seconds of this, the thing slowly turned in all of its blackness until its back was facing away from the house. It then bolted away at an inhuman speed into the field behind the house. The running looked human-like except for it being on its very tiptoes. Even stranger was that as it began to run, the light source of the unseen spot light followed it as it ran into the darkness.  
Even with this unseen spotlight following it, the figure being as light resistant and fast as it was, disappeared out of sight extremely quickly. Once the figure was gone, I stood at the window questioning if I had actually seen what I thought I had. Am I fully conscious? Did I just see an alien? Or is this the type of thing people talk about on those creepy pasta forums?   
	  
Regardless of what this was, I decided it would be best if I opened a Google Doc and started writing about this strange anomaly. As stated, this all happened in June and since then I decided to buy some camera equipment for the backyard to see if I could catch anything else. I am now typing in August and there have been no more sightings of this thing. I have on occasion heard that strange rumble of what sounds like thunder, which I immediately check the weather and open up the live feed on my security camera. As mentioned there is still nothing.   
	  
I have decided that it is time to share this story with a prominent Youtuber who covers stories and events like this. Maybe some of their fans can tell me about this thing if they have heard about anything like this. I will keep this journal updated if anything else happens. As you all know, I have plenty of time to investigate in my hands. I hope to update soon.
