You know those annoying spam calls you always get, either you pick up and no one is on the other line or it's a random guy trying to tell you how he needs your banking information because it's been broken into or just a random person trying to sell you on insurance.

Yeah it's annoying and we always get those calls anyways so we just learnt to get used to it.
Well this one is different.

I was preparing to close down the shop after an excruciating 6- hour shift.
After taking out the rubbish, i took out my phone and noticed something peculiar.
A missed call.
I brushed it off, thinking it was either the wrong number or just a spam call.
However, i could not brush of the feeling of being watched, something was looking at me.
Maybe the 6 hours of standing and taking orders and being yelled at is making me delirious and paranoid.
Ignoring that eerie feeling, i closed down the shop and made my way back home cautiously.

 i was awoken by the vibrations of my phone as a wearily picked up my phone.
The bright light hit my face as i squinted to look at the screen.
Incoming call....
It was from the same number...
Someone has to he pranking me at this point.
I groaned as i silenced my phone and went back to sleep, annoyed at the fact that my sleep was interrupted.

Vibrations again.
I woke up and groaned.
Incoming call.....
Thats strange.... I could've sworn i silenced my phone last night.
I decided to block the number and got ready for work.

I filled in my co-workers about the spam calls and they told me it might just be some random kids prank calling, trying to scare me.

Still, i couldn't brush off the weird gut feeling, the feeling that someone is watching me, that beneath these calls, lays something sinister.

Days passed by and yet, no matter how much i blocked the number, it always seemed to come back, with more doom impending.
No matter what measures I took, even changing my phone number, the same number pops up.
It was driving me insane.

I woke up to rain splattering against my window, loud wind whispering through the walls, thunder that almost sounded explosive.
Well of course, not without my favourite phone vibration, paired with the dame familiar screen.

Incoming call.....

i waited for it to end but it didn't and something in my gut was telling me something was wrong. Something was terribly wrong.

"knock..knock..knock"
I jumped, startled.
I knew better than to open it, I've seen enough horror movies to know not to open the door at moments like this.
I quickly grabbed my knife, just to be safe.
The knocks got louder and more aggressive, to the point where it was basically banging. 

With the phone in my hand, I was about to call 911.
The number was still calling, I trued clicking decline but it wouldn't budge, suddenly my phone glitched and the bangs got even more belligerent and berserked.

Suddenly, the contact name changed and it was no longer numbers, it changed to a name.

John Pork.
