They tell you that it’s just a story. Just an old wives' tale whispered to scare the children into staying close to home. But they don’t know. They don’t feel what I feel when I look at her.

I do.

I’m the last one left—Evelyn and Cecilia’s bloodline flows through me. And now, it runs through my child.

For years, I stayed away from the painting, the cursed portrait of my great-aunt Evelyn dressed in that red gown, her eyes cold and dead. I knew the truth. My grandmother had told me the secret before she passed, made me promise never to speak of it to anyone. But I never thought the curse would catch up to me. I thought I was safe, that it would end with me.

That was before my daughter was born.

I was never supposed to have children. I swore it. I didn’t want to bring a life into this nightmare, but fate—fate had other plans. I don’t know if it was fate or cruelty that gave me my sweet Amelia, born just over two months ago. But now…now I know that the Lady in Red has come for her.

It started the night I brought her home from the hospital. I hadn’t even unpacked the tiny bags when I heard the cries, soft and distant, from the nursery. But when I went to check on Amelia, she was sound asleep. Her cheeks were rosy, her breathing soft and steady.

The next night, the cries grew louder, closer, though the baby still slept peacefully. I could feel the hairs on my arms stand up, an icy chill crawling up my spine. It was her. The Lady in Red.

I locked the doors. I shut every window, but it didn’t matter. She wasn’t just outside. She was in the house.

The portrait.

I hadn’t gone near it in years, but it had been sent to me after my grandmother’s death. I locked it in the basement, covered it with old sheets. But somehow, I could feel her now—Evelyn, or what’s left of her, staring from beneath that shroud. Cecilia’s blood still binds her, still keeps her here. And my child—my innocent, sweet Amelia—is her next victim.

The town knows the story, but they don’t know what happens when the Lady in Red comes for you. They don’t know the horror of waking up in the middle of the night to see her standing at the foot of the crib, her hollow eyes staring at your baby. I do. I saw her. She was reaching out, her skeletal fingers just inches from Amelia’s face, and her dress…oh, God, her dress was soaked, glistening as if fresh blood still dripped from it.

I screamed, lunged at her, but she vanished before my eyes, like smoke. That’s when I knew—I knew what I had to do. There was only one way to stop her, to save Amelia.

I had to give her what she wanted.

The blood.

A child’s blood, innocent and pure. The same blood that binds Evelyn and Cecilia to this world. I could end it, stop the deaths that have haunted this town for decades, but it would mean…

I can’t even think it. How could I even consider such a thing? My baby…she’s my everything. I would never harm her. But each night, the Lady grows stronger. She visits more often. I can feel her anger, her hunger. And I’m terrified.

I haven’t slept in days. I stand watch over Amelia, never letting her out of my sight. My eyes sting, my body aches, but nothing compares to the suffocating fear that grips my heart. Because no matter how much I love her, no matter how much I fight, I don’t know if I can protect her.

The Lady in Red will take what she wants.

But tonight, something changed.

I heard the cries again, only this time, they weren’t distant. They came from Amelia’s crib. I rushed to her, my hands trembling, and there she was—the Lady, towering over my daughter, her long, bony fingers almost brushing Amelia’s forehead.

I screamed, begged her to stop. “Take me instead! Take me!” But the Lady didn’t move. Her dead eyes locked on Amelia, her lips curling into a twisted smile. And then, in a voice that chilled me to the bone, she whispered, “Blood…blood of the child…”

She vanished, but I knew it wasn’t over. She would return.

I can’t stay here anymore. I can’t keep Amelia safe. I’ve boarded up the house, packed a bag, and I’m leaving town. But there’s a part of me that knows it’s hopeless. She’ll find us. She’ll never stop.

As I sit here, writing this, Amelia sleeps peacefully beside me. But I know she won’t be safe for long. The Lady in Red is coming, and when she does, there will be no escape. No place to hide. I hear her voice, even now, whispering my name, calling for my baby’s blood.

My daughter’s blood.

The only way to end the curse is to give her what she wants. But I can’t—I won’t! I won’t let her take my baby. I’ll fight until my last breath, but deep down…I know.

The Lady in Red always wins.

And if you ever hear her cries, if you ever see her in that blood-soaked gown, run. Run as far as you can. Because once she’s seen your child, it’s already too late.

Pray she doesn’t find you.

Because she’s coming for us all.
