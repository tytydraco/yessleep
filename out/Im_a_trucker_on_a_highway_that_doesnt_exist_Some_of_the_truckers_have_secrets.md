*Report any unusual weather patterns immediately. While rain, sleet, and hail are all common occurrences on Route 333, they are generally water-based events. Alcohol, oil, or gasoline are atypical weather-centric liquids, though not necessarily deadly.*

*Pray no blood appears in your rain. If it does, there is no longer much point in reporting anything ever again.*

“We’ll figure something out,” I said.

“We won’t.”

“I can handcuff you or tie you up. The road might still think it’s against your will. We could trick it.”

“That won’t work,” Autumn said. We were still in the cab of my truck after learning how lane-locked drivers could escape Route 333 from the pregnant hitchhiker woman (from her newborn baby, technically).

“What if we―”

“Stop!” She slammed a fist against the dashboard. The hanging air freshener shuddered. “You can’t fix everything! It’s not your responsibility.”

“But we’ll figure this out.”

“There is no *we.* You barely even know me. It’s too late. I give up.”

“But―”

“How long do you think until the road takes you out, huh? You *know* now. It can't be happy about that. Go save the others while there's time.”

“I'm not leaving―”

“STOP!”

She clambered over the black, amniotic birthing fluid, puddled on the passenger seat and leapt from my rig.

“What are you doing?” I called.

She didn’t respond. She marched the opposite direction.

“Let me at least give you a ride,” I said. Autumn didn’t slow. “Where are you going? I can get you there safely. Autumn―”

“Leave me alone!” she screamed. “It’s only a few miles. I’m walking home by myself.”

Not to *town* or to *my apartment.* She’d accepted the town she’d been staying in as *home*. The place she now and would always live, like how Tiff had found a diner and settled down.

Autumn was giving up.

She was right. I couldn’t fix everything. I couldn’t even fix my *own* problems, and now, I’d gone and ruined her life too. By involving her in my plan, I’d taken away any chance she had of escaping Route 333. I couldn’t fix everything.

I could fix one thing.

It was the same destructive frenzy that had entered me before I’d assaulted Randall. There was no reasoning. There was no calming down and second guessing. There was only the single-minded obsessiveness that would consume me until I accomplished what I had to. I knew the secret. Route 333 had warned me once what would happen if I tried to interfere. 

I got the sense it wouldn't bother with a second. 

“What are you doing?” Randall approached me at the truck yard. His nose cast was finally gone, but there was a distinct *askewness* to his face now.

“Hooking up an empty trailer.” I crawled out from where I’d finished making sure the jaws were locked.

“Over my dead body.”

“Easily arranged.”

“You’re already deep in overtime,” Randall insisted. “We’re not financing the entirety of your starter home. Didn’t Deidree already try this?” When I ignored him, he continued. “Look, Brendon, you’re not doing anything for Chris by setting off on a fool’s errand. He’s only a year out. We’ll even keep him on as an employee. This―”

“I’m not going for Chris.”

“No?”

“Not yet, at least. Not first. I’m going for Tiff.”

“How many times have we discussed this? You’re not―”

“I know how to save her.”

His mouth, no joke, *fell* open. Apparently, that’s a thing that does happen in real life. “How―what―how do you know?”

“No time. The road knows I know. I need to go for her before it decides to take the two of us out, but if I don't make it back, radio Autumn. She can explain more to you.”

“So you *have* met that girl. Regardless, you can't just barrel into this like always. Management is already screaming at me because of you. Calm down. Let's talk about a strategy.”

I jabbed him in the chest with a finger. “You never really tried to help Tiff, did you? That was a lie. Just like everything else. You say you want to help us to make yourself feel better, but you never have. For once in your miserable life, admit the truth, Randall: you don’t care about us. You never will.”

His face flashed through a dozen emotions: confusion, anger, hurt, grief, etc. “Of course, I do.”

“Then let me go.”

He stood there. He jabbed me in my own chest. “Don't you dare make me hire your replacement. I'm busy as it is.” Then he nodded once.

I left.

Dear readers. If you were hoping for something a bit more cathartic in Randall’s and my relationship, then it’s my displeasure to inform you that’s all you’re going to get. There will be no enemies-to-BFFs story arc. No tear-jerking *he-sacrifices-his-life-for-me* or *I-take-a-bullet-for-him.* 

I don’t especially like Randall. I doubt he likes me. Likely, neither of those opinions will ever change, but turning out of the parking lot that day, there was at least something akin to *respect* between us. 

He had his job. He was good at it.

I had mine.

For lack of a better term, my mom and dad were helicopter parents.

I haven’t talked much about them. There isn’t some deep, dark backstory surrounding my childhood or anything. It simply hasn’t been relevant to my time on Route 333 until now. 

In elementary school I played soccer. My dad attended every game. On one particular Saturday morning, he stormed on the field and screamed in the referee’s face, spit flying, for yellow-carding me.

Guess who got a red card?

In fifth grade, Garrett invited me to his birthday party at the bowling alley. Parents weren’t invited. We were eleven, after all, but my Mom insisted on accompanying me anyway to make sure nothing got out of hand. She sat right at my side, between me and the other boys. When it was my time to bowl, she shouted pointers and cheered when I knocked over a single pin.

I never got an invite to Garrett’s next birthday party.

I could go on. Dentist appointments, friend issues, first dates, high school football games―there was virtually no aspect of my life they didn’t investigate, advise, or meddle in.

Don’t get me wrong. They were good parents, *great* parents even, but by the time I ever so much as mentioned the possibility of detention, they’d already contacted my teacher, the principal, and the school board for separate, outraged meetings. Very rarely did their intervention ever actually *help*. Mainly, all it taught me was that there would always be somebody else to solve my problems for me.

I won’t claim it’s their fault I’m the way I am: unable to handle life unless something with teeth is chasing me forward. I’ve seen crappy parents end up with all-star kids and vice versa. Each of us has a nature and a potential, and a moment (or a dozen) when we decide to fulfill or not to fulfill that potential. It would, however, be dishonest to say they didn’t *influence* who I am. I never quite had the chance to learn to swim before I was being thrown in front of a wave.

All of that to say this: sometimes, it's the things we do to protect people that end up hurting them.

Isn’t that what I’d done with Autumn? I’d wanted to save her. I’d tried to give her a chance, but instead, I’d taken that very chance away.

Was that what I was doing with Tiff? Would my helping her hurt her? It was possible, *likely* even, but what else was I supposed to do? At what point did aid turn into overbearing and help turn into obsession? 

That was the truth of it, I suspected. My parents. They’d loved me, but their vulture-like circling had never been about me, not entirely. It had been about their need to fix. To feel they were *good* parents doing the *right* thing for their child. Was that me? Was I the vulture? 

There were too many sides to every equation. For years, I’d been unable to tell what I should do and how I should do it. It had crippled me, knocked me over at the knees. All I did know was that I had to do *something*. If that thing wasn’t helping somebody… then what?

“Brendon?” Tiff said as I entered her red and white diner. She was wiping crumbs off one of the tables. “Could’ve sworn Deidree told me she saw you headed to dispatch.”

“Do you miss it?”

“Huh?”

“Do you wish you could go back?”

She paused mid-swipe. “Brendon, if something’s up, I’m always free to talk. You know that.” 

“No. This isn’t about me. I don’t want it to be. Tiff, I just need to know if, well, you miss it. The *real* world. Life, people, all of it. Do you wish you could go back? Would you risk your life to get there?”

Her eyebrows crinkled. She clasped her hands and the tattoos along her forearms flexed. “I’ve built something for myself here. When I got stuck, I imagine nobody in the real world asked about me much. That’s the curse of a life on a road. You’re gone so often, people tend to forget you. Relationships fade. The only person I’ve ever cared about is my daughter. If I could be with her, I’d go wherever.”

Her daughter. The one who’d passed away from cancer. Tiff rarely talked about her, but I knew it was the reason she’d started hauling on Route 333.

“I don’t mean to be insensitive,” I started, “but you can’t be with her.”

“Don’t reckon I can.”

“So you wouldn’t risk it?” My stomach unclenched. “If you had the choice? You’d stay here.”

She stared at me. She looked up at a burnt out light fixture, at the employee smiling unnaturally behind the cash register, at the fake family laughing in a corner booth. She blew out of her mouth. 

Her face grew gravely dark. “What sane person would stay?”

I nodded.

“Don’t you go doing something stupid,” she said.

I snorted and plopped myself onto a table, swinging my legs off the edge. “If only I could.”

We talked for a while. She brought me some pie. We shared a pot of the only good coffee on Route 333. It wasn’t until evening was setting in and the automatic outside lights had switched on that I said, “can I get you to check on something with me?”

“What’s that?”

I led her to the back of my truck and rolled up the trailer. She peered in. “There’s nothing in there, is there?”

“Nothing dangerous, nah. It’s…well…it’s kind of hard to explain. Can you just go check on it?”

She shrugged, climbed in, and sauntered to the back. “What were you asking about? I don’t see anything.”

I slammed the door closed.

“Brendon?” Her voice was quiet at first, inquisitive. The doors trembled, but I’d already snapped closed the padlock. “You let me out.”

“No can do.”

“This isn’t funny.”

“It’s not,” I agreed.

The banging came soon after. Then hollering. Controlled at first but increasingly more frantic. “*Brendon*!” A piece of me drooped, withered, and flaked to dust.

*It’s for your own good,* I wanted to stay, but that would be too dangerous. I couldn’t risk Tiff thinking I was doing this to help her. No more chances. I’d already wasted them on Autumn. Tiff had admitted herself she would risk her life if it meant a chance at getting home.

In the distance, clouds were rolling in.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Within minutes I knew the pregnant hitchhiker woman had been telling the truth. Nothing about the desert we sailed through was new. Each landmark was familiar. Tiff now counted as unwilling cargo, and we were no longer lane-locked.

The realization should have thrilled me. This was the thing I’d fought for weeks and weeks for. My time on Route 333 hadn't been wasted.

Instead, I glanced in my rearview window periodically at the rumbling clouds growing both closer and less visible in the deepening twilight. It had been bad with the crying thing in my trailer that made other inhabitants more restless. Now Route 333 would be against me as well. 

By the time the first drops of blood hit my windshield, I knew it was too late. The road had no intention of letting me leave.

The blood turned chunkier, splatters instead of drops. I drove on. That had been my promise, hadn't it? Whatever happened, as long as there was someone to protect, I would keep my foot on the pedal.

Overhead thunder rumbled. My headlights filled with red. The asphalt was barely visible. We jostled and shuddered over debris raining onto the highway.

“Hold on!” I screamed to no one in particular. Tiff couldn’t hear me. She was alone, afraid, imprisoned in the back.

*You will not die there.*

Desert morphed into redwoods. It was a good thing Deidree had been the one to transport Chris. Otherwise, I’d have an extra hour of driving. As it was, we still had a chance.

Except we didn’t. 

Organs and ligaments were raining down now. The front window cracked and splintered in two separate places. My very cab groaned in the same way I imagined Autumn’s had. Any second and the whole thing would collapse inwards

*You will not die like this. I will not let you.*

I rolled down the windows and let loose a bellow. “You have no right! I broke none of your rules!” The storm continued to rage. “*How dare you!*”

The debris stopped falling.

The raining ceased.

My rig broke from a clear line of gruesome destruction into a fresh, untouched stretch of forest.

It had worked. My screaming had convinced the road to let us go―or so I thought. For one, glorious, relief-studded moment I truly believed Route 333 had really decided to allow us free.

Then my engine cut off. My rig slowed and stopped. My stomach joined my feet on the floor.

Route 333 hadn't let us go at all. It had merely acknowledged that for the next minute and forty-seven seconds, something *else* had claim to us first\*.\*

Since the incident with the thing in the trailer, the forest-dwellers had left me alone. They hadn't tried to speak to me or even so much as stop my truck. It was unusual; that’s what the other truckers said. All of them still experienced the same minute forty-seven slow down as they had for years. It was almost like the forest-dwellers were *embarrassed* by their last failed attempt.

They weren’t embarrassed now.

They didn’t even wait for the end of the time limit to skitter around the truck, looking for a way in. I didn’t bother hiding. What was the point? We’d spoken before. They had my scent. They *knew* I was here. Whatever happened was inevitable.

My time on the road had begun with another interviewee skewered to the roof of his vehicle. Every haul I’d made, I’d passed through here, the forest-dwellers domain. All of it, every drive, and swerve, and twist of the ignition key, had all been leading to this last confrontation.

After what seemed hours, but was probably minutes, the pattering slowed. My eyes remained firmly shut. Something low and gravely spoke from what sounded like directly on my hood. Like last time it was no voice, not truly. It was the rumble of gravel under tires, of sand sprinkled onto paper, and wings fluttering against an air current.

“Let us speak.”

“Yeah,” I said. “Alright then.”

“You will not pass this time. You know this. There is no option of escape, He Who Dwells on Stone.”

“Nah. I don’t reckon there is.”

“Once more, we demand you relinquish the life force you carry.”

“So you can trade it to the road?” I asked. “You want to get out of here the easy way, yeah? To go terrorize people in my world instead of here. Why do you all want to go there so bad? That’s what I don’t get. Do you eat us or something? Why not forge a new life for yourself here?  Why are all of you so obsessed with escaping?”

Silence.

My eyes were closed. I had no idea what was flashing across the forest-dwellers expression (if it even had a face), but I imagined conflict.

“Why are you?” it finally asked.

I found I had no good answer either.

“*Please*,” the forest-dweller said. “We have been trapped for so many turnings of this planet. We have no grievance with you. You have never gazed upon us. Relinquish her and we will have no cause to harm you or the remaining of your kind.”

“And what happens if I don’t? What if I refuse?”

“We will take her anyways.”

Outside the cab, a branch snapped in the distance. A breeze rustled the trees as if in slow ponderous consideration.

“Then you’d better do it,” I said.

“Very well.”

All at once, the slap of bare feet began once more. From all directions muttering rose up like the thing on my hood, but once more, none of them were voices. They were crackling, burning leaves and boulders crashing down mountains. They were the whisper of snow and the roar of avalanches. The sounds were everything and nothing all at once, from every direction and from nowhere, inescapable and non-existent.

The cracks in my windshield splintered. The whole thing crashed inwards. Wispy hands surrounded me, unfastened my seatbelt, and dragged me out through the windshield. Glass slashed my arms and cut into my bare calves. I screamed out.

The forces pushed me against my hood. My back arced against the curve. I tried to yank my arms and legs free, but like the hitchhikers, they were too strong. I had no chance. I never had. I was human. These impossibilities were something else entirely. 

An eyeless face flashed through my mind. A man, mouth gaping, with an entire tree trunk rammed through his chest. The pain on his face. The terror.

“We did not wish to hurt you,” the world whispered from every direction at once. “You have made this necessary.”

There was the snap of something from the side of the road, like a thick branch being yanked from its tree. I had perhaps seconds now. After everything―traversing the road, confronting Randall, learning the solution―this was where it all ended. The injustice of it all coursed through me, and I committed my one, final act of defiance.

I opened my eyes.

Above me hovered… well, *nothing.*

Not exactly. The forest-dwellers *were* there. Clear as the clouds in the sky. They stared at me from every direction, full of eyes and snapping jaws, but they were also *not* there. 

How do I explain this?

Imagine a mirage. At a glance, you clearly see the oasis. It’s so obvious, and yet, you know it’s not there. It doesn’t exist, and yet it does―except, even that's not a good example for the forest-dwellers, because a mirage is still something that’s possible and explainable. The forest-dwellers simply weren’t. They were a paradox that would drive you mad. An *impossibility*. 

Already, my mind was slipping. If we’d been in the real world, it would already be dripping out through my nose but something about the road helped me handle it. Either way, it didn’t matter. They were still going to kill me, these things that weren’t there.

But how could something hurt you if it wasn’t there?

“You don’t exist,” I whispered. And then louder, “You don’t exist.”

“We do.”

“You don’t.”

They flickered. Their tenuous state of being wavered.

“You exist as much as I believe you do, and I don’t. You can’t do anything to me.”

The world around me shuddered. The truck lurched side to side. *We exist,* they seemed to scream. Their every action was another subtle cue to convince me we inhabited the same physical realm. *We are here, and we will hurt you. We have wants. We are alive. Believe in us.*

I laughed. The force pushing me down lessened.

“You’re my late night fears,” I said. “You’re my loneliness, and the terrible things I repeat in my head about myself so I never forget them. The only power you have is the power I *decide* to give you. I refuse.”

*She is ours.*

“Of course, she is. Tiff belongs to no one and nothing, and that’s exactly what you are.”

They shrieked―or tried to. It was the impression of a shriek. The memory of a dream just moments after you wake up. *Was it real? Did that happen?*

I woke up metaphorically speaking. The grogginess faded. The footsteps and the screaming dissipated. They were the barest of impressions in the smallest recess of my mind. I ignored them.

I slid down the hood and dusted the glass from my shirt. I got in the cab. 

We continued.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Truth be told, it wasn’t the most enjoyable experience driving without a windshield. I slid a pair of sunglasses over my eyes, and brushed my cheek whenever a leaf slapped my face. Humans didn’t evolve to experience such high speeds without a screen protecting us.

It didn’t matter.

We were so close to dispatch and we’d already gone through so much. What was a bit of wind? 

Twenty minutes later I pulled into the truck yard and parked us on the non-Route 333 side. We’d officially made it.

Randall waited for me, arms-folded. “The truck looks like it got pounded with a dozen sledgehammers.”

“I got her.”

“You mean she’s―”

“In the back.” I handed him the rearview key. “She still doesn’t know what’s going on. It was sort of unavoidable, but, uh, well you should probably be the one to talk to her.” *Oh so* *comforting as you are.*

He approached the trailer. There was the sliding of a metal door. Muted talking. 

I waited near the cab. Tiff would, no doubt, be incensed. She had a right to be, but even so, wouldn’t this be a good thing? However it had happened, I’d gotten her out. Eventually, she would forgive me, and if she didn’t, that was fine too. She would still be free.

Randall approached me. “You should come.”

“Why are you so pale?”

“Just come.”

I prepared myself and followed him.

Tiff had slumped down against a wall. Her arms were around her knees, and she was sobbing. The scene reminded me of Chris all over again. 

“You’re safe.” I rested a hand on her shoulder. “It’s hard to believe. The way I had to do it was terrible, but it’s true. You’re finally back.”

“I abandoned her.”

“Huh?” I glanced at Randall. He said nothing, but his face was still white.

Tiff shrugged off my hand and glared up at me. “My daughter. She’s still in there. I’m safe, and she’s trapped.”

“Your daughter?”
