The chalkboard takes up my entire west wall. My numbers crawl across it in notation I invented myself, a language of subscripts and topological symbols that no one else understands. That's the point. Energy drink cans form a small pyramid in the corner. I haven't opened the blackout curtains in three days. Maybe four.

I stand in front of the board, marker in hand, completing what I call the Loneliness Manifold. The equation curves across the slate like a snake eating its own tail. Beautiful. Stable. Perfect.

*They wouldn't get it. Normies never do.*

My phone buzzes. Marcus again. Beta orbiter energy radiating through the screen.

*dude you coming to class? prof k asked about you*

I sneer at the message. Marcus, with his easy laugh and his little harem of study group girls. He probably thinks he's helping. Probably gets off on the idea of "saving" someone. Classic virtue signaling. I don't reply.

The realization came to me six months ago, after the incident with Sarah M. She'd approached me in the physics lab, all performed sweetness and calculated eye contact, asking if I wanted to study together. I'd actually felt something. Hope, maybe. Excitement.

Then I'd overheard her in the hallway the next day, laughing with her friends. "I felt so bad for him, just sitting there alone."

Pity. She'd approached me out of pity, probably farming good-person points with her social circle. Look at me, helping the weird quiet guy. So empathetic. So kind.

The humiliation burned, but it also clarified everything.

That night, I started writing. Not physics, not at first. Just observations. Patterns. The way people moved through social space like particles in a field, attracted and repelled by invisible forces. Status. Beauty. Resources. It was all just math, I realized. Quantifiable. Predictable.

Over the months, it evolved. I called it Aesthetic Topology. A unified field theory of human social dynamics. My equations proved what I'd always suspected: some states are stable. Some people exist in attractors that pull in validation, affection, sex. Others, like me, exist in what I termed the Soliton of the True Self, a stable isolated state, elegant and complete unto itself.

It wasn't failure. It was a different kind of solution to the equation.

I'd shown Professor K. last week, arriving at her office hours with three notebooks full of derivations. She'd looked through them with that same pitying expression Sarah had worn. "Eli, this is... this isn't physics. This is a metaphor. Maybe you should talk to someone in the counseling center?"

Gatekeeping. She saw the paradigm shift coming and her ego couldn't handle it. Her entire career, her tenured position, all built on the crumbling foundation of conventional theory. Of course she'd reject it.

Marcus and two others had been waiting outside when I left. They'd tried to get me to go to some party. When I explained I was busy with my research, they'd exchanged looks. Then Marcus had actually laughed. Not mean, just... dismissive. Like I'd said something cute. Something childish.

That night, alone in my room, something broke open inside me. Or maybe broke closed. I felt the stability settling in, the peaceful acceptance of my isolated state.

I turned to my computer, to the simulation I'd been building. The core loneliness equation, rendered in code. I hit run.

The lights flickered.

My computer fan screamed, then went silent. The screen died to black, but in the reflection, in the dead pixels, I saw it. A shape that hurt to look at. Angles that folded wrong. A knot of space that shouldn't exist in three dimensions.

When I blinked, it was gone.

But not really. Over the days that followed, I started noticing it. The hum of my refrigerator would sometimes sync to a harmonic that resonated in my chest. My digital clock would show impossible times, 23:61, 25:03, then blink back to normal. Rain on my window would tap out sequences that looked like my own notation before dissolving into randomness.

It was proof. Physical, observable proof. My theory was manifesting reality.

I stopped going to class. Why would I? I was conducting the most important experiment in human history.

The Anomaly grew stronger. I could almost see it now in my peripheral vision, a constant folding presence. It didn't scare me. It validated me. I'd found something true, something real, and it was responding.

Three days ago, Chloe R. showed up.

She knocked on my door during what I'd been calling a "resonance event," when the Anomaly was particularly present. I almost didn't answer. But she kept knocking, and finally I opened the door a crack.

"Eli? Hey. We've been worried about you."

We. She probably meant Marcus and the others. Her little coalition of concern, probably made her feel good about herself.

"I'm fine."

"You haven't been to Physics 401 in two weeks. Or any class. I just wanted to check in."

I looked at her properly for the first time. Chloe. Overweight, awkward, always trying too hard to be helpful. Classic do-gooder complex. Probably thought if she "fixed" enough broken people, someone would finally want her. Typical 304 behavior, just a different strategy.

"I don't need checking in on."

"Look, I know we're not close, but I care about people in my program. And you're clearly going through something."

The presumption of it. The arrogance. She had no idea what I was going through. She was an NPC, running her programmed empathy routine, collecting her virtue points.

"I'm working on something important."

"More important than graduating?"

She said it gently, but I heard the condescension. The assumption that I'd lost perspective, that my priorities were wrong.

I should have closed the door. I know that now. But the Anomaly was present, and something in me wanted her to see. Wanted someone, anyone, to witness what I'd discovered.

"Come in," I said. "I'll show you."

She hesitated, then stepped inside. Her eyes went to the chalkboard, to the equations covering every surface, to the pile of cans and the rumpled sheets I hadn't changed in weeks.

"Eli, this is..."

"Aesthetic Topology," I said. "A complete mathematical framework for social dynamics. Look." I pointed to a section of the board. "This describes stable attractor states. People like you exist here, in this degenerate manifold. You orbit other people, trying to gain value through association. And this," I traced the elegant curve of the Soliton, "this is a stable isolated state. Complete. Self-contained. It's not loneliness. It's mathematical elegance."

She stared at the board, then at me. "Eli, I think you need help."

"I need you to understand."

"This isn't physics. This is... you're hurting, and you've convinced yourself there's some equation that explains why, but there isn't. Sometimes we're lonely because we push people away, not because of some cosmic force."

The Anomaly pulsed. I felt it in my teeth.

"You're trying to collapse my state," I said. The words came from somewhere deep, somewhere that understood the math. "You're noise. Interference. You're trying to pull me into your degenerate attractor."

"I'm trying to help you." She moved toward the door. "I'm going to talk to the RA. Or counseling services. Someone needs to know you're not okay."

She was going to ruin everything. She was going to bring the authorities, the normies with their medications and their therapy and their insistence that I conform to their bounded reality.

"No." I moved to block the door. Not to hurt her. Just to make her understand. "You have to see. It's real. Look."

I turned to my chalkboard, grabbed the marker, and wrote out the final equation. The one I'd been building toward for months. The Annihilation Function. The mathematical expression for removing external noise from a stable system.

As I wrote the last symbol, the Anomaly screamed into existence.

The air in my room folded. Light bent toward a point that shouldn't exist. Chloe opened her mouth, but no sound came out. Her body compressed, not like being crushed but like being solved, reduced to her mathematical essence.

The process took three seconds.

When it was done, a sphere hung in the center of my room. Black. Dense. The size of a fist. It absorbed light, pulling photons into itself like a hungry mouth.

And it cried.

The sound was electronic, broken, a looping fragment of Chloe's voice processed through impossible physics. A sob. Desperate. Trapped. It called out to me, the only consciousness left to hear it, over and over and over.

I stood frozen. The Anomaly was gone. The equations on the board seemed suddenly alien, the notation of a madman.

What had I done?

I reached toward the sphere, but it emanated cold that stopped my hand inches away. The sobbing continued. Would it ever stop? Could it?

I sank to the floor.

Hours passed. Maybe days. The sphere wept. My phone buzzed with messages I didn't read. Eventually, hunger drove me to my laptop. I needed to understand what I'd created. I needed to find the equation to undo it.

An email notification caught my eye. University disciplinary system. I'd been flagged for wellness concerns. They wanted me to come in, talk to someone. There was a link to security footage, flagged for review.

I clicked it before I could stop myself.

The timestamp showed three days ago. My dorm room, fish-eye lens view. The door opened. Chloe walked in. We talked. I gestured at the chalkboard. Then the video glitched, pixelated, and when it cleared, Chloe was gone. The black sphere hung in the empty air. On the grainy footage, I could see it vibrating. Could almost hear the electronic wail.

So it was real. Not a hallucination. Not a psychotic break. I'd actually done this. My theory had been proven through the worst possible experiment.

I closed the laptop. The sphere continued its crying, a metronome of despair. I looked around my room. The chalkboard. The cans. The blackout curtains. The architecture of my isolation, complete and perfect.

I packed a single bag. Left the laptop closed, the equations on the board, the sphere weeping in the center of the room. I walked out of my dorm, through the empty hallway, out the front door of the building.

The campus stretched before me, trees and pathways and students moving in their social orbits, attracted and repelled by forces they didn't understand. I turned away from it all, toward the city beyond the gates.

I am the Soliton of the True Self now. Truly, finally, irrevocably alone. I've proven my theory. I've manifested my mathematics into reality. And I'll carry the proof with me forever, an electronic sobbing that will echo in my bones for the rest of my life, even after I walk far enough that no one will ever find the black sphere weeping in my room.

The eigenvalue has been solved.
