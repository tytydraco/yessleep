I haven't told anyone close to me about this in a very long time, but I fear what will happen to me in the coming days, weeks, months - whenever she decides her hunt has been fulfilled.

I was only 10 years old when I first met her. At first, I thought of her as a guide. I had just lost my iPod Nano and I couldn't find it anywhere. In short, I was devastated. This was around the time that people would pick on you for the stupidest of reasons and I got it full force. Music was a way for me to escape reality, it still is. 

She would whisper to me to venture into the basement when my parents were asleep. I didn't question her, I wanted my Nano - I *needed* it. So I would go downstairs like a good little boy and search for my iPod in the spots she mentioned. Time and time again, I could not find it. Finally, she claimed that my parents must have moved it because she swore she saw it down there. I return upstairs disappointed for what seems like the millionth time looking. This time however, I'm ready to confront my parents once and for all.

I barged into their bedroom. Much to my surprise, they're still very awake.

*Didn't she say they were asleep. Whatever, doesn't matter.*

"Where did you guys put my iPod?" I said in my whiny, high-pitched, pre-pubescent tongue.

"What are you talking about?" My mother would usually take the lead on these kinds of things. My dad, paying attention, but focused on something else.

"She told me you guys moved it from the basement. I just want it back, I'm sorry if I did anything wrong." I looked behind me, begging for the woman to say something, but she just stood there. Not moving, unnerved by it all.

*Is she even breathing?* I checked again, certainly *looked* like she was. 

If I didn't have their full attention before, I did now.

"Who is *she*?" My mom was so gentle with these words, but I could see the desperate worry on her face. 

I don't bother turning back this time, I just point behind me. 

*How can they not see her? She's a giant!*

They still appear puzzled, so I give in and turn around. To only my surprise, she's no longer there - *physically*  at least. 

My parents chalked it up to me having an imaginary friend. I tried to defend myself, but again, I was only 10. What's the first thing people think when a kid that gets bullied talks about someone no one else can see? However, I *knew she was real*. You can't just imagine a presence, right?

She would continue to speak to me and I would continue to listen. She promised she'd help me look for it one last time as long as I didn't mention her to my parents again. Naturally, I agreed. What kid doesn't love hiding stuff from their parents?

That night, that dreadful, horrific night - she bore her fangs at me for the first time. I managed to get away, but a part of my soul is still in my parents' basement. I begged and begged for my parents to go downstairs, which they did, but she was long gone. To this day, I still don't dare look for the piece she took. 

The woman disappears for a couple of years. By 'disappear', I mean I didn't see her physically, but I felt her on my heels constantly. She doesn't show herself again until I start middle school. At this point, I knew her for the vile beast that she truly was. This is also when I start walking with a little extra pep in my step. Being in middle school, it only added more ammunition to my bullies' magazines, but they didn't know what was always a couple steps behind me. I was in a constant state of fear. I didn't know how to get rid of her and I didn't know how to get my bullies to stop. I wanted to kill myself. I couldn't take it anymore. I was sent to the psych ward.

Sure, I learned coping mechanisms and all that, but the only thing that stuck after being sent there on three separate occasions was that it'd be better if I never mentioned her again. To keep my stupid goddamn mouth shut. So I didn't, I kept my distance from her and acted like the pills were working. 

This was a mistake. 

Her screeches and screams violated my ears for many years. I still loved music and it became my way of drowning her out. What I didn't know was how adaptable my monster was. She's an expert huntress and she *loves* the thrill of the hunt. *She lives for it*. 

*I have to stay quiet, I have to, I cannot go back. Not again.*

She would go on to terrorize my mental state until my freshman year of college. I moved down south and it was like she had lost my trail. I'd still hear her somehow, but not a grotesque fiend in sight. Life was peaceful.  

When I visited for the holidays, it was like she didn't miss a beat. Her reign of terror would continue. I always wanted to stay home longer, but I just couldn't. I didn't want to imagine what she might do to me. That Christmas break, I regrettably fell asleep in my basement. 

Nothing happened, radio silence. Reluctantly, I did it again - still nothing. I ended up getting so addicted to the silence that I continued to sleep down there every time I went home. I still kept a light on, but I was finally sleeping for once in my own home.

After freshman year, I moved back to my home state but further south of my hometown. Still no sign of her. 

*I actually did it, she's no longer a part of my life. I can walk at a normal pace again. I can finally sleep in peace.*

This peace lasted two months into my stay at my new university, then she sat me behind me in my Spanish class. The sight of her sent me into a panic and I almost left, but she just sat there like a student herself.

Quiet, but I knew better. She surveyed me for two weeks and I continued to act unfazed by the curveballs she threw at me. 

*I'm a pro at this now, she will be vanquished for good this time.*

And she was and has been until recently, I think. I'm not sure because at some point I noticed I was walking unnaturally fast again. Like my body knew it was in danger. Then came the screams and the restless nights. I tried getting help again to only be told that there's no possible way that she exists.

"If she wanted your soul, why hasn't she taken the rest of it already? Why wouldn't she just take it when you're asleep? You have a creative mind, just continue taking the medicine and keep going to therapy." I believe those were the final words that doctor ever spoke to me. I was not going to waste my time again. I should've known better to not mention her to anyone, but I was scared. I even ask myself these same questions, but I don't think the hunt would mean much to her if she took it while I was asleep. 

I am but an insect being batted about by a cat's paw. She's toying with me and enjoying it. 

She physically reappeared last week and it made me shake in terror. I've gotten taller myself, but I still pale in comparison to her skyscraper stature. I know she's been lying in wait for when I'm most vulnerable and I'm more vulnerable than ever now. 

I feel like I'm back in middle school all over again, but this time I live all by myself. She has endless opportunities to do me in for good this time. I don't dare mention it to anyone, not even my therapist, in fear that I'll go to the ward again. However, if I don't say something I'm afraid she'll get what she's always wanted - the rest of my soul that she failed to capture all those years ago. Even now, I can feel her peering over my shoulder as I type this.

She allows it anyway, she knows no one will believe me. After all, no one can see her except me.
