The bar on the outskirts of town wasn’t much of a looker. The wind whistled as it slipped through its tattered awnings. Unimposing as it was, it had a welcoming glow about it. I stumbled out of my car as I was already drunk, and made my way up the wooden stairs. Inside the tavern sat about seven other drunkards. The place tried to exude elegance but the gilded ceiling did little to jazz up the place. A subtle buzz hummed from the dim lights that hung sporadically around the room. Smooth music emanated from a back corner. It kissed my cheeks like a hen greeting me home after the war. 

As I walked in, some drunk sap was on his way out. He didn’t seem to be making any effort to move from my path. If he wasn’t going to get out of my way, I wasn’t going to offer the same either. I slammed my shoulder into the drunkard's chest as he tried to pass me, knocking him to the floor. I scoffed at the guy, my words slurring out. What I said resembled something close to “learn to walk.”  I stepped over the man and headed towards the barstool he’d left empty. I hope me slamming into him knocked the wind from his lungs. 

Nobody said a word but I felt all of their eyes on me. It was only a moment before the general ruckus resumed. I smiled to myself. I had made my presence known as I normally did. My stool neighbor was some fancy man who’s tailored jacket stuck out like a sore thumb. His dark features looked fierce against the white suit that adorned his exterior; his gold tie glimmering in the shabby lighting. He shook the barkeep's hand and thanked him for the business. A transaction of some sort was coming to a conclusion. The fancy man took a long drag of his cigarette in triumph, just before patting it to what I thought was an untimely demise. 

Inhaling the sweet secondhand smoke caused me to cough something awful; revealing the effects of a habit I’d had since I was a kid. Only recently had I quit smoking on account of my livelihood, but big tobacco did still pay the bills. I’d lobbied for it for over half of my life, and used it for more than that. My cough was intense; chunky and guttural. It doesn’t just sound painful, it truly is. My coworkers joke that the nastiness of my hack matches my morals on account of how I tend to handle business. To be blunt, that’s not far from the truth. Once more, I could feel the watchful eyes of the bar’s inhabitants on me as I coughed something awful. I slumped onto my elbows and tried to calm down. The fancy man next to me tried to be subtle as he watched me in his peripheral vision, trying to act like he was merely sipping his amber liquor. His eyes were as narrow as they were sharp.

“You sound like a man who needs a whisky,” The fancy man turned his head, his bowler revealing a shiny pin crimped around a grosgrain band. 

The barkeep's gaze lingered on me while I hacked up a lung before flicking over to fancy pants. Fancy pants raised his glass to signal another drink and with little hesitation, quickly followed with, “In fact, let’s make it an Old Fashioned.” His southern drawl seemed to drag each sentence out twice as long. 

I raised my eyebrows. An Old Fashioned? Now we’re talking. I’d been so busy coughing that I’d forgotten to demand a drink before I sat down. I lazily nodded my appreciation before drunkenly removing my coat. I tossed it across the bar without concern of who’s way it might be in, failing to notice that I’d placed it in a patch of spilt cocktail. My jacket tends to hide my gut, but without it my fat stomach now feasted on the oak bar in I sat at. My attention drew to the fancy man’s hands that fiddled with a small leather book. Open, closed, open, closed. The sound was fueling a rage inside me before the flickered sound of static stole my attention.

I hadn’t noticed the small television nestled in the corner of the bar before. Its audio must have been off, but somehow became unmuted and was almost instantly too loud now. I felt my face scrunch at the sudden loudness but as I glanced around, I didn’t see anybody else acknowledging the volume change. The movie was in the middle of a scene backed with dramatic crescendos. A buggy chugged its way down a dark road, swiftly chasing the tail of a man. The screen cut to a close up of the actor's face, screaming. It then flashed to a rather gruesome outcome of the man’s body, contorted under the tires. Hershey’s chocolate meant to be blood pooled on the screen. I chuckled at the pose of the dead man’s body, it was oddly goofy. The TV started to sputter then filled with static, its sound cutting to silence. The bartender noticed this, frowned and hit the top of it with his fist. This didn’t seem to fix it, so he resorted to just turning it off. 

Again all I could hear was that damn booking slamming together. Shuffle, slap, shuffle, slap. Some people just have no manners.

“Cut that shit out, it’s absolutely aggravating!” I  knocked the book from fancy pant’s hands, hoping that would send the right message. I noticed my drink now sat in my midst. I didn’t even see the bartender make it, let alone bring it over. My mouth watered at it’s beautiful sight. Clearing my throat, I admired the drink's neat presentation before taking down half of it in one swig. My attention turned to my neighbor. 

“What kind of grown man brings around a child’s story book anyways?” My languid speech drew slower than I meant it to. The fancy man spun the tiny literature around in his fingers like a spider with a fresh catch in its web. 

“No stories here, sir. Well - maybe visual ones, I suppose. The salesman’s sampler, they call it,” The man spoke with elegance, picking the book up from the bar where I’d knocked it. “I reckon it’s a good way to show off a snippet of goods,” the man extended his hand, offering the booklet for review. 

I took another gulp and snatched the book. The book looked even smaller than before in my meaty hands. The spine was surprisingly stiff and it cracked as I opened it. Inside was a clear sleeve that accordioned out about 10 times the length of the book itself. Individual pockets housed playing cards in an array of styles and colors. Most had their backs shown, each displaying rather ornate scenes. Though the sleeve was double sided, the cards didn’t add up to even half that of a normal deck. 

“They’re fully customizable playing card samples. Usually a business wants to advertise on them. As you can see, we can capture quite a bit of detail. It’s a mighty fine way to get word around about a small business. That’s how I ended up in your presence this evening, in fact. Locked in a deal with this here local tavern.” 

My vision blurred and focused on the bartender. No wonder the glasses in this place were so crystalline, the guy’d been shining the same tumbler since I walked in. My eyes danced back down to the card samples as the fancy man droned on and on. I cut him off.

“Y’know, I lobby for big tobacco and I might see a business opportunity here. *‘A good ol’ game of rummy while you relax with a Lucky’,*” I smiled as dollar signs started to dance in my eyes. 

I’m brilliant! I started to laugh when I thought about how much the bosses would eat this up. This laugh quickly turned to a hack that turned my face beet red. I finished my cocktail, hoping the coolness would help end the show I was putting on. The soothing burn of whisky slid down my throat, doing little for the choking but more for my courage. 

“What’dya say you gon’ pitch me, too, hmm?” I gargled my words; my throat felt thick with globs of saliva and tar. 

The man cracked a smile before he spoke. “Well, I'd be mighty obliged to pitch to you, Mister Porter. I must warn you, though, it’s hard to escape me once I’ve started my deal,” the man winked. 

I nodded and waved my hand to get on with it, but then I stiffened. I haven’t introduced myself to the fancy man yet, have I? 

Fancy man rose to his feet and like a wiper over a windshield, he lifted his arm across his front and dropped it. The fitted garments he wore seemed to change into darker versions of themselves. He was as he was before, but like he’d taken a step back into the shadows. The white suit turned midnight blue while his golden accessories melted to black.

I blinked, and in a matter of moments, I was now seated in the front row of a theatre. A flashy sign dangled from above. Letters written in tiny lightbulbs spelled out the words “Grimm Goodman”. Its luminance doused my sight with yellow fluorescents. Cheers erupted from all around, the sudden noise making me jump out of my skin. A silhouette took to the stage that now lay directly in front of me. As the shadow entered the spotlight, I saw it was the fancy man from the bar. I craned my neck to observe these new surroundings. 

A sea of dancing bodies roared like waves. It took me a moment to notice that the people around me were lacking any facial features. Where there should be eyes, a nose, mouths; was just skin stretched over a skull like frame. The lack of orifices in the crown did little to dull the sounds of their cheering. It was absolutely deafening. I shuddered and wiped the sweat from my brow as I tried to stand. In the moment, I hadn’t realized I was holding something until I’d let go. The sampler booklet tumbled from my grasp, bouncing off my belly before arriving at my feet. My attempts to stand proved ineffective. I jerked and throttled in my seat with no luck of removing my bottom from the chair.

“For my first trick, i’ll need a volunteer. You sir! Mister Porter! Yes, come on up!” The boom of the fancy man speaking reverberated every inch of the theatre. 

I slammed my fists against the arm rest, angered that I couldn’t seem to stand. This was infuriating. I was blinded by a beam of brightness as the spotlight that illuminated fancy pants moved over to me. I tried to shield my eyes with my arm. I felt I sat that way for ages before I tried to take a peak. As my arm lowered, the stage no longer loomed above me. Now, it was below me. I was on it, front and center. A tumultuous horde cheered in front of me. The fancy man now stood to my right, demanding the crowd give their volunteer a welcoming hand. The man clapped along with the crowd, but his applause was different. His hands swept more air between them. It was more precise, landing large blows with slow, singular clasps. 

On the third clasp, the booklet I’d dropped onto the floor moments ago, revealed itself between fancy pant’s clutches. He twirled his hands around, and in a moment, a full deck of cards now fanned itself in front of my face. The backs of the cards were all different. Some of them I’d seen before. Yes, in the small sampler when I was looking it over at the bar. Each back depicted a different ornate landscape or scene of some sort. 

The man practically yelled in my ear, “Pick a card, any card!”

“Now, I- you- just what is going on here?” The panicked words fell from my lips. Without answering me, the man began flipping rapidly through the deck, and told me to tell him when. 

I could feel the anger bubbling up in my chest. “I said, what the hell is going on here? I demand you stop this ri-” before my sentence was finished, the man stopped shuffling. 

He pulled out the card he stopped on, and flashed a 3 of clubs to me. Its face gleamed in a brilliant metallic gold. The man flipped the card around, revealing the scene on its backside. It showed a country landscape bathed in moonlight with a silver car sitting on a tree lined dirt road.

“Remember this card, Mister Porter. Don’t forget!” 

I ripped the card from the man’s clutches, tearing it into pieces before tossing it in the air like confetti. 

“Now I said what in the hell is going on here? You tell me right now! Where’s the bar?” Droplets of saliva spewed from my mouth as I shouted. 

The man continued to ignore me, tending to the crowd’s entertainment. He held his hands out, displaying me like an award, before clapping once more at the crowd. My eyes darted around in search for an escape. Thankfully, not too far behind me, was a staircase leading downward. I turned and barreled down the stairs as fast as my stubby legs could carry me. I wasn’t sure where it went but it was better than on stage next to that crazy buffoon. Aisle lights led the way to what I hoped was an exit. Steel doors ascended into my vision. I ran with my arms outstretched, ready to burst through the doors as I arrived. As they swung open, I was startled by the lack of a lobby. Instead, what greeted me was a dirt road. I really didn’t know if it was a safer route than what lay behind me, all I could think about was how much I wanted away from this lunatic. Something about his presence filled me with dread. I inhaled deeply and darted out into the night. 

The darkness had a fresh familiarity. Dirt and rocks crunched under my feet as I burst down the road, frigid wind nipping my cheeks as I moved. I trudged for what seemed like ages. Yet, when I took a chance to double check I wasn’t being chased, I saw the theatre stood not even a mile away. Though I couldn’t see all that well, a vision of the fancy man standing in the open doorway flashed across my mind. I wasn’t sure how but I knew the man was smiling at me, laughing even, well amused. I whipped my head back around so I wouldn’t trip. Around the bend above, two beams of light appeared in the distance. I felt a small wave of relief as I waved my arms frantically, yelling for what I’d hoped was a car that would stop for me. My escape plan was close enough to be a momentary comfort. 

As the car got closer though, it didn’t seem to be slowing down. In fact, the car seemed to be gaining momentum as it barreled towards me. It was too close now to outrun it, but what else could I do at this point? I stopped in my tracks, looking at the forest that lined the road. With slight hesitation, I took off into the woods. It was dense and dark, I couldn’t really see a thing. I prayed I wouldn’t run full on into a tree. The squish of moist soil under my feet slowly started to turn to a crunch. As my eyes adjusted to the moonlight, I noticed I wasn’t surrounded by trees as I’d assumed I’d be. They were all to my sides. 

I wasn’t running through a forest, I was running down a dirt road. Confused, I stopped in my tracks. I tried to collect myself for a second. I looked around and saw the theatre lay behind me, just about a mile away. I heard tires on a road and turned around. The car was closer than it was before I went into the trees. Almost without thinking, my gate reverted back towards the theatre as the car got closer to my heels. The headlights behind me cast my shadow on the road in front of me. The shadow seemed to mock me as it ran along, growing smaller as the car got closer. Soon enough, the car caught up with me. Its front bumper hit the back of my knees, knocking me down to the ground. The tires rolled along up my legs, onto my back, pressing me into the rubble and breaking my spine. My receptors couldn’t fire fast enough for me to feel all the pain; bones breaking, organs popping, the burn of the gravel as it pierced through my skin and face.

The overwhelming pressure of my skull being popped like a near empty condiment bottle made me start to pass out. The tires made their way from the nape of my neck to the crown of head. The road was malleable enough that my head sank just enough to narrowly escape being completely crushed. I felt my eyes bulge. The car finished running me over and I assume it just drove away as the sound of the motor exponentially faded.  I was barely conscious and my eyelids felt like lead. I became acutely aware of the taste of iron and dust on my tongue. A pitiful cough escaped me, a splatter of blood and rocks spewing from my mouth. My blink was heavy, the world around me turning from solid shapes to glimmering orbs of light. Vehicular fumes filled the air and my lungs. I didn’t think I could muster another full blink without blacking out. My vision was waning, but a glimmer of something caught my attention before I passed out from the shock. In the puddle of blood I’d spit out, now pooling around my face, lay rocks and teeth. But there was something else, too. Crumpled up, a card slowly unfolding itself with the release of pressure revealed its face to me. It was the 3 of clubs, now whole again with only light marks of where I’d ripped it apart on stage in the theatre. I think a chuckle escaped me but I was overcome with the worst pain I have ever felt and I succumbed, letting the darkness take me.

The cottonmouth was overwhelming as I came to. It took a few blinks for my vision to come into play, and I noticed the bartender and a few others looking at me rather concerned. As I lifted my head, I noticed it wasn’t in a pool of blood as I thought, but rather in a puddle of a yellowish drool. Frightened, I tried to stand quickly. My sudden frantic movements caused the stool to fall out from under me. I fell back and let out a groan as my head met the wood flooring with a thud. 

“I didn’t peg you for a lightweight, Mr. Porter, but I assume the coughing fit mixed with drunkenness made you pass out,” The voice was now too familiar to go unrecognized. 

I jolted up, my hands pushing me backwards until I was against a wall. The fancy man eyed me uneasily.

“Y-you stay away from me! What the hell did you do to me?! Did you do something to my drink?!” The shivering down my spine was fierce enough that I felt my belly jiggling. 

The fancy man couldn’t help but crack a smile, as did the onlookers who’s beer sloshed from their steins as they laughed. I scowled as my eyes danced across the people surrounding me. Though enraged with embarrassment, I was soothed by the appearance of their facial features. 

“Must have been some dream you had while you were passed out, Mister Porter,” the man’s outstretched hand offering assistance. I remained blubbering on the ground. “Name’s Goodman,” the man’s teeth glowed against his dark complexion as he beamed. 

I eyed his outstretched palm suspiciously, then turned my nose up with a scoff. I swatted his hand away, and Goodman smirked as he tucked his hand into his pocket. 

“Yeah, yeah, Grimm Goodman, ain’t it?” I tried to gracefully bring myself to my feet, but the action of crawling to my knees before using the wall to hoist myself up wasn’t really all that elegant. Now able to look Goodman in the eye, I held his gaze sternly. “And I never did get around to introducing myself, so how is it you know my name, *Grimm Goodman*?”

Goodman’s grin lingered as he spoke, “How is it you know mine? Why don’t you take a seat and I’ll treat us to another drink?” 

I spat at the bastard, a thick gross blob landing on his cheek. 

“How about you tell me who the fuck you are!” I shouted. Goodman’s smile curled back, his eyes gleaming as he wiped the spit off his face with a gold handkerchief.

“Careful, Porter. Your true colors are showing. Not that they weren’t just as vibrant before this little outburst,” The pupils in Goodman’s eyes shrank to tiny pinholes while I felt mine dilate. I couldn’t put my finger on why but the words Goodman spoke filled me with something more than fear. 

“Mr. Porter, you’re a well known man in the world of no good doers. It should be no surprise that I know *exactly* who you are. Now, you asked me who I am and believe you, me, you will come to know this. But right now, I want you to pick a card.” 

A shuffle that looked otherworldly danced between Goodman’s hands before spreading out the deck, again revealing the different scenes on the backs of the cards. A thought dawned on me. The card I’d picked the first time depicted a scene that was rather close to my so-called dream. Maybe that’s why it’d all felt so familiar in the moment. My face must have shown this revelation because Goodman’s lips curled back more than I thought possible of a human being. It was like a fox bearing its teeth to prey. 

“Mr. Porter, I do grow impatient. Pick a card.”

I snarled and slapped the cards from Goodman’s hands. I rushed in close enough to Goodman that my gut pressed into his torso. 

“Fuck you and your games, Goodman. I’m a wealthy man with connections to people you wouldn’t wish to know. I will sick hell on you. I have no time for this bafoonery. You can forget about my business, Grimm Goodman! Good day,” I peeled my coat from the sticky bar and again could feel the eyes on me as I hurried towards the bar’s exit. 

I was visibly frightened which was embarrassing. My ego was indeed threatened but at this point, I didn’t really care. I just wanted to get away from that bar and that… man. I frantically crossed the parking lot to my car, fumbling with the handle before finally yanking it open. I threw my vehicle into reverse before my driver door was completely shut. I was in such a rush, the corner of my coat got caught in the door, flapping a goodbye to the bar that I’d never be back to. As I stepped on the gas, I heard my tires peel on the pavement. 

The colors of the passing nightscape blurred together as I pushed the gas as close to the floor as it could go. I glanced down to the odometer, watching the numbers tick from 2 to 3 digits. When I looked up, I was stunned at the view. I was no longer in my car. Instead of speeding down the road, I now sat back at the bar. My hands were positioned at 10 and 2, my foot still stomping where the gas pedal had been. It happened so fast, it took me almost a full minute to come back to myself. I finally dropped my arms to a resting position, my elbow landing in a sticky spot still covered in lint from when I’d ripped my coat out of it a few moments ago. A drink once more presented itself in front of me, but no bartender was there to have served it. In fact, when I looked around, I was all alone. 

Instinct took over and I felt dread, and that I should run. I started to get up but something deep in my soul made me hesitate. My body seemed to act on it’s own and I plopped back down where I sat. I took in a deep breath and then exhaled all the air out of my lungs. I was tired, and had a hunch that if I left again I’d only wind up right back here. So instead, I grabbed the whisky glass in front of me and downed it all in one swift chug. Out of nowhere, I felt a presence appear next to me. I didn’t need to look to know who it was. A spread of cards entered my vision. This time, Goodman’s words had more of a hiss behind them. 

“I promise you don’t want me to ask again. Pick a card, Porter.”
