[\[Part 38\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/RandomAppalachian468/comments/1ksjynf/the_call_of_the_breach_part_38/)

“Over here, I found her!”

Cold air nipped at my nose, and I coughed, shivering in the snow as someone crouched over me. My body hurt, though as I flexed each limb, I didn’t think anything was broken. The wet clothes I wore didn’t care for the frigid conditions, and my teeth began to chatter as a light snowfall tumbled around my face. It was still dark, but the sky overhead was a mass of puffy white, snow-laden clouds that rolled by on their endless march through the atmosphere. Some of the wind had died down, but instead of a surrounding canopy of towering pines or swamp grass, I found myself stretched out in a rolling field pockmarked by scrub brush, bedded down with the winter’s snow. All in all, I would have some nasty bruises and could feel the places where I had cuts of lacerations, but still, I was alive.

Breathing a sigh of relief as I blinked to clear my head, I tasted the fresh air with weary delight.

*Barron County. Never thought I’d be so happy to see you again. Did you miss me?*

Two faces materialized in my plane of vision, and a familiar grin made my heart start working.

“W-We’ve got to s-stop meeting like t-this.” I shivered, my throat dry, but smiled as Chris pulled me into his arms.

“Old habits die hard.” He dragged me out of the snowdrift with ease, his voice hoarse as Chris shook with the cold. “You okay?”

I winced as the soreness in my battered muscles returned. “Ask me in the morning.”

“I told you she’d be fine.” Jamie tucked a woolen army surplus blanket around my shoulders, but from her pale, blood-spattered face, I could tell she was as relieved as he was. “Come on, let’s get her to the fire. Temperature’s still dropping, and we’ve come too far to die from hypothermia now.”

Hauled to my feet, I put both arms around their shoulders and walked through the snow towards a distant line of trucks. Now that I was awake, I could see our forces scattered over the wide field, many like myself waking up in the snow, dazed. Few of our original vehicles had survived; most of the wreckage lay strewn about the field, like oversized children’s toys that had been discarded. The circle of vehicles in the center I recognized to be our support column, a secondary group tasked with meeting us after our mission had concluded. Two gray chinook helicopters squatted inside the long cordon, and teams of stretcher bearers rushed out to scoop more men from the snow. Over half of our number lay wounded, some limping or crawling toward their comrades, others too broken to make the trip, their cries haunting and pitiful. Many dead bodies carpeted the field, all of them ours, as if the passage back into our world had whisked away the casualties from Vecitorak’s defeated army. Tauerpin Road, and all its strange landmarks, was nowhere to be seen. The concrete tower was gone, the gravel road with it, and instead of the perpetual rain of an October night, we had returned to the wintry present, where the early December skies dropped buckets of snowflakes on our heads.

Inside the circle of idling trucks, medics tended to the lines of wounded on the ground next to several small piles of brush that had been set ablaze by the soldiers to provide warmth to the sodden task force. The vehicles were already packed with men, their heaters on full blast, and the NCO’s did their best to make sure the worst off got priority in that luxury. The rest of us huddled around the fires, while various squad leaders called out names as they searched for missing people.

Chris wedged me into the nearest circle so I could warm myself by a fire lit inside an old, rusted oil drum someone had found, and one of the survivors to my right peered at me through a mass of blood-stained gauze.

“Didn’t think we’d be seeing you again, lass.” The bundled-up man croaked, and my jaw dropped.

*No way.*

Stunned, I took in the sight of Peter’s haggard face, the left side covered with a large bandage over his eye, more cotton pressed down over a gouge that ran from forehead to cheekbone in a bloody trench. He’d taken a sword cut right to the face, and I doubted there remained much of an eyeball under that bandage, judging by the sheer amount of blood smeared over his skin. In his arms, Peter held Tarren, her face buried in his long coat, dirty hands balled up in his shirtfront.

“I could say the same to you.” Relieved, I matched his ornery grin but nodded at the girl in his lap. “Is she okay?”

“Physically, yeah.” His smile faded, and Peter scowled at the nearby bonfire, tugging the woolen blanket closer around Tarren’s little shoulders. “Hasn’t said anything in the last half-hour. Not sure if or when that will change.”

That made my heart twinge, and I watched Tarren stay curled up in his arms, refusing to look around, only her slight breathing giving indication she was alive. “What about you?”

Peter continued watching the flames for a moment, then glanced at me with his one good eye. “You seen Grapeshot?”

“Once.” I winced and squinted down at my dirty fingernails for a distraction. “It wasn’t for very long.”

He waited until I brought my gaze back up, and Peter’s face took on a serious contour. “He’s dead?”

Unable to think of anything else to say, I nodded. Despite everything he’d done, all his sins, Captain Grapeshot had saved my life, gave me the time I needed to bring the Oak Walker down, and I knew it was a debt I could never repay. His face would forever be etched into my memory, his final words, the way his lifeless body had flown off the tower on the heels of the grenade.

*Another life paid in exchange for mine.*

“Good.”

Shocked at his words, I gaped at the boy’s calm expression in the firelight. “Peter . . .”

“He was my brother.” Craning his head back to look up at the snow-laden clouds, Peter let out a long sigh. “Maybe we shared no blood, aye, but we were brothers all the same. I watched him suffer, every day, until he stopped being himself and turned into someone I didn’t recognize. Whatever pain he was in, he won’t feel it anymore, and that’s for the best.”

I grimaced in sympathy at the sadness in his voice and angled my head at Tarren. “He gave his life to save her.”

His dark eyes moistened, and Peter gripped a silver rapier under his opposite arm, one that I remembered from my time spent on the *Harper’s Vengeance*. “Then he died as himself.”

A team of medics slogged by, carrying another litter, and one of the trucks opened so a mercenary could call out to his comrades.

“I need more plasma here!” He waved to the other medics, his blue rubber gloves awash in crimson. “BP’s dropping fast. Tell Primarch either we get those birds in the air, or someone better get a nine-line going, ASAP!”

Peter’s mouth formed into a grim line, and he pointed to the vehicle, keeping his voice low so the words stayed between us. “The preacher’s not doing so well. They’ve had him in there for the past fifteen minutes, working on his legs. Even the flower juice the golden-hairs use didn’t bring him around.”

*Last time I saw him, he was crawling for his sword, through fire and ash.*

At that, my heart sank, and I swallowed a lump in my throat as more ELSAR soldiers rushed to bring medical supplies to the truck in question. Adam had stood toe-to-toe with Vecitorak, crossed blades with an immortal being on par with the demons of ancient lore, and paid the price for it. Even his armor hadn’t protected the man from the mutant’s wrath, and in my head, I saw again Eve’s tear-streaked face as she bid him goodbye on the tarmac in Black Oak.

*Crunch, crunch, crunch.*

Boots trudged through the snow behind me, and I turned to see another figure push through the crowd.

“You alright, Captain?” Colonel Riken looked me over with the stern ease of a man who’s seen too much to be rattled by the insane circumstances we found ourselves in. He’d lost his helmet at some point and sported a bandage around his left hand, but other than that, the ELSAR commander seemed okay. His uniform was as gory and ragged as everyone else’s, the light machine gun at his side caked with gray carbon deposits around the muzzle. A long tear, likely from a claw, had ripped through his plate carrier, the armor underneath all that stood between Colonel Riken and what would have been certain death.

Under the assault of another icy blast of wind, I shuddered but did my best to speak between chattering teeth. “I-I’m fine. How m-many did we lose?”

Colonel Riken shrugged the soot-covered weapon higher on his shoulder. “A third, by my count. But whatever you did, it worked. Our scanners show stable radiation and electromagnetic readings. It’s still too high to communicate with the outside world, but the Breach is sealed. It’s over.”

*No, it’s not.*

Aware of just how many curious ears there were around us, I hugged the blanket tighter over my shoulders and jerked my head to the side. “A moment, Colonel?”

His face drew into a hard line, as if Riken could tell I was about to give him bad news, but he followed me away from the fire. Peter stayed where he was, content to enjoy his well-earned rest, while Chris and Jamie closed ranks with the colonel and I until we were out of earshot.

“Barron County is going to vanish.” Amidst the curtain of snow, my breath fogged in the wind and reminded me of the old steam locomotives from a fair I’d been to as a child. “The Breach is closed, yes, but it’s going to pull Barron County down with it. Once it does, the area will stabilize for good, and in seven days we will be standing in a different world.”

His glower deepened, and Colonel Riken folded both muscled arms over his ruined armored vest. “Are you serious?”

I met his hardened gaze and refused to look away so that the colonel knew I wasn’t lying. “The beacon killed the Oak Walker, and Vecitorak, but that left a vacuum that collapsed the Breach in on itself. You have to get Koranti to allow an evacuation, at least of those who want to stay in our world. Once we go through, there’s no coming back.”

The others stared at me, and I could tell they wanted to call me crazy but couldn’t find a justification for it. We’d all been there when the Oak Walker fell, they’d seen the road the same as I had. For us to be here now, after everything, without needing to leave our personal sacrifices behind meant that the Breach was in fact gone for good. Yet, like an enormous ship sinking slowly into the ocean, it couldn’t leave this world without dragging something down with it. Perhaps, like Professor Carheim said, it already had. Maybe the reason no one had ever heard of Barron County, remembered where the old dusty maps were in the local libraries, or asked about relatives from here, was because the collective memory of this place had already been eliminated . . . just not in the past as I had always assumed. No, in some strange loop that connected all of time, most knowledge of Barron Count had been expunged from the past the instant I’d closed the Breach, like a circuit being completed when a switch was thrown. This had been the path all along, the hidden destiny for which I was meant, and while it would have terrified the old Hannah, I couldn’t help but feel a glow of reassurance in my chest as Adam’s words from the chapel at Ark River flowed through my mind.

*‘My ways are not your ways, my thoughts are not your thoughts.’*

“You’re sure?” Chris seemed the most adamant to believe me, though his handsome face drew thin and pale with the news. “There’s nothing we can do to reverse it? No way to go back, find the road again and . . .”

“No.” There was so much I knew, so much I wanted to talk to Chris about, but didn’t have the time, and so instead I shifted from one foot to the other in an effort to keep the chill at bay. “And we . . . we’re not meant to leave. I know it sounds insane, but some of us have to stay, have to cross over to the other timeline. I think it’s the same one the—”

I froze, catching myself before I mentioned the missile silo in front of the colonel, but from the way Chris and Jamie tensed up, I could tell they understood. Colonel Riken’s eyebrow rose, but he seemed to get the hint, and didn’t press the matter.

“So, what, we’ll end up back in time?” Jamie stuffed both hands into her wet jacket pockets and hunched her shoulders against the cruel wind.

“Yes and no.” Wishing I could return to the fire, I blew warm air into my cupped fingers and did my best to elaborate so Riken could understand without revealing any defense secrets. “We’re going to an alternate reality, one where the Breach overran the world in the 1950’s and basically destroyed most of human civilization. If Tauerpin Road was a space between spaces, then the universe we’re going to is the space opposite ours. Does that make sense?”

“Barely.” Colonel Riken let out an exasperated sigh and rubbed at the bridge of his nose. “But I’ve heard stranger things in my time. Either way, staying behind sounds like a death sentence.”

*Or a second chance.*

Thinking back to the walk through the redeemed Tauerpin Road with *Him* at my side, I caught myself in a half smile. “From what I’ve been told, we’ll survive the crossing and are meant to start the reconstruction once we reach the other place. There’re others out there, just like us, who need help to fix things. That’s our job.”

“If word gets out, people will panic.” Jamie rubbed her arms in a shiver and glanced at Chris. “Even if they believe us, the Assembly won’t support anyone staying behind. Hannah, we trust you, it’s just . . .”

“No one will stay if Koranti opens the border.” With his thumbs hooked into his pistol belt, Colonel Riken finished Jamie’s thought for her, and his eyes drifted to the waiting helicopters nearby. “Whoever told you all this might be reliable, but it won’t matter if the population riots. I’ll get in touch with Koranti, and see what can be done about evacuations, but in the meantime we need to get the wounded back to the safe zone. Mr. Stirling is in bad shape, and if he doesn’t get to a hospital soon—”

*Boom.*

In the distance a flash lit up the horizon, not from thunder, but the deep tolling of artillery.

Everyone in the cordon paused, their eyes focused on the north, and dozens of more explosions began to flicker against the clouds. Pilots climbed down form their cockpits in the chinooks, gunners stood up in their turrets on the trucks, and even the medics slowed their brisk jogs back and forth to stare. It seemed no one, be it ELSAR or coalition, had the slightest idea what was going on, but as the seconds dragged by, the truth started to dawn on me.

My blood ran colder than the snow, and I turned to one of the nearest coalition soldiers. “Private, get me a radio.”

He came running back a few moments later, and the man held out one of the handsets from our relief convoy, his face white as the landscape from the sounds that came from the device’s speakers.

*“We can’t hold this position, there’s too many!”*

*“Fast movers! Fighters coming in from the north! Six jets inbound!”*

*“I’ve got tanks all over my sector, where the hell is our artillery support?”*

*“All units, collapse in on the square! I say again, the northern district is gone, collapse in on the square! Fall back!”*

Stunned, I turned to Colonel Riken, who seemed equally confused, and pointed to the horizon. “What the hell is this?”

Annoyed at his own radio not responding, Colonel Riken waved to one of his nearby men, the mercenaries growing more uneasy by the minute. “Find me a comms set that works, *now*.”

Jamie glared at him and tightened both hands on her well-worn Kalashnikov. “This was a trick. You did this on purpose, didn’t you? We get the Breach out of the way, and while we’re gone, you send your boys to restart the occupation.”

Her words spread across the nearby soldiers like wildfire, anger replacing surprise on the faces of our men. Indignant murmurs turned into audible growls of discontent, and the encampment formed into two separate ranks, ELSAR men on one side, our own forces on the other. Weapon safeties clicked off, gun turrets swiveled around on their armored charges, and we found ourselves facing each other across a prickly line of steel. No one dared level a rifle yet, but from how tense things were getting, I knew it was only a matter of time before someone lost their cool.

“Everyone just stay calm.” Chris raised his hands to gesture for our men to keep their weapons lowered, pacing between them and the mercenaries to keep anyone from disobeying. “I said stand down, we’re going to handle this. Colonel, start talking.”

One of his troopers ran up with a functional radio, and Colonel Riken jammed the talk button down to snap orders into the speaker, his tone sharp as a knife. “Overlord, this is Primarch, requesting status update, over.”

Nothing.

“Overlord, this is Primarch, we are green on our mission objectives, requesting mission status update.” He shifted on his boots as the bombing intensified, and somewhere high overhead, I caught the rumble of airplane engines for the first time in months. “I say again, this is Primarch, we are green on our mission, awaiting further instructions. Someone talk to me, over.”

My gut churned at tiny arches of light that shot through the clouds miles to the north and slammed down in the space that I knew was Black Oak. They were hitting us with multiple launch rocket systems, just like at New Wilderness. Such weapons had reduced our hilltop fortress to cinders, and in the densely packed streets of a city, they would wreak unimaginable damage on civilian and military targets alike. Whatever this was, ELSAR wasn’t pulling any punches, and I quietly palmed my Type 9 that still hung by my side on its ragged strap.

*Is Jamie right? Was this all a setup? Riken doesn’t seem to know any more than I do, how could they not let their commanding officer know about an offensive?*

A vein rose in the skin of his neck, and Colonel Riken ground his teeth, ready to erupt like a hand grenade. “Central Command, this is Colonel Riken. Someone better get on the horn and figure their life out or so help me they will wish they’d never been born. Our mission is complete, and we await further instructions. Do you read us, over?”

*“Loud and clear, colonel.”*

The surprise on the colonel’s weathered face reflected my own, as Crow’s smug voice slithered out of the radio speaker like venom on the wind. “Captain McGregor? What in God’s name are you doing on this frequency?”

*“Oh, it’s not ‘captain’ anymore.”* She chuckled back with confidence that made my skin crawl even from several feet away. *“I’m afraid there’s been a change of command. You are hereby no longer part of the Ohio task force. All callsigns and intel clearances to your former rank have been revoked.”*

“On who’s authority?” The second he had a chance to talk, Riken smashed his thumb into the talk button, gripping the handset so hard I thought the metal would bend.

*“Mine.”* Crow hissed back, both satisfied and hateful, as if she’d been waiting a long time for this moment. *“Koranti needs loyal officers to lead this campaign, and I can do a better job of cleaning up the insurgency, so we came to an agreement. As brigadier general of the new expeditionary force, I will take over from here on; you are to return to headquarters at once for reassignment.”*

Struck speechless for a brief second at the command, Colonel Riken shook his head in furious bewilderment. “Reassignment? Did you not hear a word I said? We completed our mission, the Breach is closed, the operation was a success!”

*“And yet, the beacon signal was never received.”* She spoke with a haughty, almost bored tone, one that cold alongside the detonations of artillery fire in the distance. *“Which means the coalition is in direct violation of their ceasefire agreement. Execute any insurgents within your vicinity, and report back to us.”*

Not far from the nearest burn barrel, Peter clutched Tarren to his shoulder and slid one hand to a pistol on his hip. His dark eyes met mine from across the snow, and the pirate made a slight shake of his head. If I trusted anyone to know when things had gone sour, it was Peter, and that look made my pulse jump into another level of fear.

*We’re all standing right here, if they open fire, we’ll all butcher each other like rabid dogs.*

“Fool!” The colonel shouted into the radio, losing his cool at last. “This is madness, can’t you see that it’s over? We did our job, *we had a deal*, and you want to start this up again? I have wounded men on the ground out here, we’re black on ammo, what the hell am I supposed to do?”

There was a pause on the other end, and I couldn’t decide whether I thought Crow might be laughing or suppressing her own rage.

*“Carry out your orders, colonel.”* Sheer defiant indifference radiated from her words as Crow signed off. *“Kill the insurgent leaders and evac to the rear. We’re going to finish this, Riken . . . with or without you.”*

With a frustrated snarl, Colonel Riken spun on his boot heel and threw the handset against the nearby burn barrel so hard that it dented the rusted steel drum.

Silence reigned in the cordon, and I noticed how tired everyone looked in the flickering firelight, both coalition and ELSAR alike. Despite their suspicious glowering at one another, both sides were bloodied, exhausted, and soaked to the bone. Any fight that happened now would reap a dreadful harvest among us all, the men too close for the bullets to miss, and too worn out to make a run for the trees. Only the injured men jammed inside the passenger compartments for warmth remained outside this confrontation, watching with confusion and intrigue from the narrow gunports. Rigid in the cold, we all waited, eyed our opponents, and wondered what would come next.

Colonel Riken stood with hands on his hips, breathing hard in his anger, and my guts tightened in apprehension.

*Oh man, this is going to get ugly . . .*

“Well gentlemen, I’m not going to sugarcoat this.” Turning to face his men, Colonel Riken composed himself and walked down the line of his beleaguered men like a sports coach before the last big game. “You’ve been through hell. Tonight, you won a war no one will remember, much less thank you for. Every man here has gone above and beyond what you signed up to do, and I’m damn proud to be your commanding officer.”

He met the gaze of each soldier, spoke to them as a father to his sons, and the ranks of heavily armed mercenaries parted to let Riken stride amongst them with almost hallowed respect. “If anyone wants to, he can climb into a chopper and head for the rest of our units back at the county line. No one will stop you or think less of you for it, least of all me. You can tell them the insurgents fled, that you fought bravely, and that I gave you orders to withdraw. They’ll welcome you as heroes, give you medals, pay bonuses, maybe even promotions. You’ll have enough to call it quits after this tour and go home to stay. God knows, you deserve that much at least.”

Their expressions reflected confusion at his words, but the mercenaries didn’t interrupt him as Colonel Riken paced before them, up and down the line of rifles. Our own troops furrowed their brows, but stayed where they were, the entire cordon hanging on the man’s every word.

“As for me, I’m a soldier.” As if on parade inspection, the colonel walked with a back straight as a ramrod, head held high in pride. “Like you, I swore to protect the people of this nation from harm and signed on with ELSAR because I believed we were a force for good. I still think we can be . . . but not while men like Koranti are in charge.”

Surprise rippled through me, and murmurs flitted amongst the coalition ranks. No one had ever heard the mercs talk this way, certainly not one of their high-ranking officers. Could this be another ruse to catch us off guard? Or was this something more?

Jamie and I caught one another’s peripheral gaze, and she lowered her AK from the tense position near her shoulder.

“The way I see it, we made a deal, and I intend to honor my word. These people are not our enemy, not anymore.” He cast a glance in our direction, and Colonel Riken granted me a small nod. “It’s time someone led ELSAR back to its true purpose, and if no one else will, I’ll do it myself.”

Frigid air stuck in my lungs, and I had to remind myself to drag another breath in.

*Is this what I think it is?*

Without another word, Riken tore the number identification patch off his tactical jacket, crossed over to the rusted burning oil drum, and hurled the insignia into the flames.

Long seconds ticked by, the ELSAR men blinking at his actions, their stunned looks mirrored by our coalition troopers on the opposite side of the cordon. All of the former rage and distrust seemed to have melted away in sheer amazement at the spectacle we’d witnessed. In a way, it seemed both sides didn’t quite know what to do, many looking down at their weapons as if they weren’t sure of anything anymore. At last, one of the gray-clad mercenaries stepped out of the line and stalked closer to Riken.

I recognized the sergeant who had picked me up to put me on the gurney all those days ago, his face smeared with soot, one arm bandaged. Like the rest, he wore a little bar of numbers stitched in a Velcro patch over his plate carrier front, simple black figures that rendered the sergeant no more important than a warehouse shipping crate. They were all like that, nameless men, purposefully stripped of what made them human by a soulless organization that spent their lives cheaply. Koranti had done it on purpose, I realized; yes, it must have been on purpose, for even the calculating bureaucrat had known that men with names form thoughts. Men who thought would begin to question, and those who questioned might refuse. If I knew anything about George M. Koranti, he *hated* being told ‘no.’

With a single fluid motion, the sergeant ripped the number patch from his uniform, flicked it into the flames, and gave Colonel Riken a trim salute.

Instead of saluting back, Colonel Riken reached out to shake his hand and drew the soldier into a half-embrace with his other arm, welcoming him. This Riken did as the rest came one by one, like a father to his wayward sons, more filing in from the vehicles to add their patches to the fire. Not a single mercenary remained behind, all of them throwing their support behind their commander with absolute trust.

“Well, I’ll be damned.” Next to me, Chris wore the ghost of a disbelieving grin and muttered under his breath in a tone only I managed to hear. “The old lion really did it. *Ave Caeser*.”

I didn’t understand what he meant, but my husband’s optimism filled me with a sense of renewed calm, and I felt the budding of my own hopeful smile.

*I guess I’m not the only ‘person of interest’ anymore. What I wouldn’t pay to see Koranti’s face when his legions turn on him. Whatever happens, it serves him right.*

His blue eyes aglow with a determination that could move mountains, Colonel Riken took in the group of men surrounding him with an approving smile. “Right then, let’s get to it. NCO’s take charge of your squads and get me an ammo count for each. Top off whatever you need from the trucks, ditch anything you can’t carry, and get our wounded loaded asap. We’re wheels-up in ten mikes.”

As if released from a magical spell, the ELSAR soldiers broke up in smaller groups to attend to their tasks, moving with fresh enthusiasm. Medics scurried back to their patients, some of the troops intermingled as the mercenaries handed off heavier bits of gear they couldn’t take with them, and a few even exchanged solemn handshakes with their coalition partners. Those on our side traded rations for rocket launches, portable mortars, or even land mines, and just like that, the tension went out of the air.

Riken shouldered through the buzz of activity to us, angling his head at the echoes of battle in the north. “From the sound of it, they’re moving in with lots of armor and mechanized infantry. I figure they’ll flank the city on two sides and try to roll over the county in the next 72 hours. We can leave most of our heavy equipment with you, but it won’t be enough to stop them all; you need to get your people out of there.”

“Thanks to you, we might have a fighting chance.” Chris gestured to the line of trucks Riken’s men were unloading as they prepared to board the helicopters to abandon the zone. “But where will you go? You don’t seriously intend face Koranti with a handful of men?”

“No.” Riken frowned at continued artillery barrage on the horizon. “If he’s thought ahead enough to have me demoted while I’m out in the field, then he’s probably expecting some sort of provocation. We’ll head for the north-western border and raid one of the supply depos there before splitting up into covert teams. Once Koranti realizes what’s going on, he’ll target our families for leverage, so our first mission will be to move them to safe houses all across the country. Then, we’ll see how many of our brothers in arms are willing to march with us.”

“You think many will?” Jamie rested the bulk of her rifle’s weight on one hip.

“Some, yes.” Colonel Riken sighed and arched his back to crack it under the ragged armored vest. “But Koranti won’t take this lying down; he’ll find ways to suppress dissent amongst the ranks through his usual methods. We’ve got a lot of ground to cover before central command figures out we’re AWOL. If they send enough men to chase us, it might thin out the border guards enough that you could make a breakthrough, but I’m afraid we can’t do much more than that.”

*Even if we survive this attack, we’ve got seven days before it all goes under. That will end the war one way or another. Once this county slips through the Breach, we’ll never see each other again . . . I just hope Koranti gets trapped on Riken’s side of reality.*

At that thought, I stepped forward to offer my grimy palm. “It’s been an honor, colonel.”

He shook my hand, and Colonel Riken’s features pulled into a cynical, melancholy expression. “Likewise, captain. I’d say until we meet again but . . . well, with any luck, neither of us will. I hope you make it to wherever you’re going.”

As our column prepared for our immediate return to Black Oak, I watched the bulky gray helicopters rise into the sky, their steel rotors thundering as the iron giants zoomed away into the west. The further they went toward the edge of Barron County, flashes of light began to pockmark the dark clouds around them, and I wondered if the ELSAR border defense had turned their anti-aircraft guns on the retreating choppers. I had no way of knowing, as the helicopters were soon far out of sight in the darkness, the flashes fading as well. In less than five minutes, we were on our own once more.

“All right, I want head counts from every squad.” Chris hefted his rifle, and waved our men into action, Jamie and I flanking him to charge for the convoy in gusto. “Trucks with wounded stay in the center, armed ones on the vanguard and tail. As soon as we get to the outskirts, those of us who can still fight will peel off to support the front. Let’s move out!”

Jamie gave me a hand up into the lead truck, and Chris climbed in after me. Snow pelted down from the clouds outside, the vehicles skidded over the slippery ground, but we clawed our way out of the field to the closest road and headed back toward the fighting. I sat beside my friends on the heated seats of the MRAP armored trucks, hugged the woolen blanket closer around my shoulders, and tried to ignore the continued *thud-thud* of shells to the north. We were driving into a meat grinder, there was no doubt about that. If we retreated, the coalition would be forced out into the countryside, and the only safe place would be Ark River many miles to the south. If we stayed in Black Oak, we would be surrounded and ground into powder by ELSAR’s artillery. All this combined in my mind to repeat the words of the One who had given me the path I now found myself on.

*Your suffering will increase even further before the end.*

Huddling closer to Chris, I rested my head on his shoulder and shut my eyes in an attempt to catch some rest for the colossal struggle ahead.
