To: Peter Collins-Lund

Pete,

I understand this is unusual, and I hope you’ll forgive me for procuring your personal email from Faraj. I’m writing you in confidence, because I know you have some experience with this. I didn’t know who else to bring this to. We’ve been doing walkthroughs and the piers are cracked. TransEd is saying it’s because they ordered two types of concrete and they weren’t miscible. Our testing seems to indicate that the crack is from a low frequency vibration, much like how a bridge would collapse, although I’ve never seen this in relation to a land-based pier before. It’s difficult to explain, I would much prefer if we could talk in person. Faraj agreed with me about the source of the cracks, and he’s rarely wrong. I apologize if I’m reaching out in error, but we’re at a complete loss. Please give me a call when you have a chance. My number is 780-**XXX-XXXX** and I can clear my schedule any time you’d like to meet.

Peter,

I’m sorry once again for attempting to contact your personal email. I’ve also left a voicemail at your home number. I profusely apologize for trying to get a hold of you as Faraj told me you are on sabbatical, but it’s extremely imperative I reach you. We’ve done more tests and have found extremely unusual things, and again, Faraj mentioned you may be of some assistance with this. We’re under a tight deadline and are being scrutinized by the public and media. I know this doesn’t necessarily concern you, nor should you care, but I had really hoped to be able to sit down and have a conversation with you, and hopefully get some information from you. Please contact me anytime day or night. 

Yours,

Pete,

I’m urgently trying to reach you. Please, if you can, respond. I’m okay with phone, text, email, you can even drop into our office. I’m at a total loss to explain what’s happening. Materials engineering ran test, and it’s definitely not the concrete composition or method used to pour or cure the piers. But the cracks are spreading. It’s up to 18 now from 3 in only a month. I don’t know what will happen if it continues. I really need your help. Please reach me in whatever way you can.

From: Sam Schecter

To: Peter Collins-Lund

Peter,

I’m still trying to reach you. I apologize if you are away for the long weekend. However, I need you to respond. This is extremely serious. The cracks are up to 21 now, and this is only in the last three weeks. Ron keeps telling the public it has to do with expansion and contraction, and city council is going nuts. It’s not that. Faraj knows it’s not that. He’s gone back to India again. He says it was a mistake to ever come back here. He says you’re the only one that knows what’s really happening. Peter, is there danger to the public? Maybe I shouldn’t be telling you this. But back when we were both starting out and early in our careers, especially those years at Corizon, I always felt you were trustworthy. You’ve been a great colleague and friend. I NEED your help. I can’t put it any more bluntly than that. There are a lot of things happening that don’t make sense and Faraj told me this happened to you too. Please call me back.

It’s making a sound Pete. It’s making a sound and I can hear it. I have kids Pete. I know you do to. I know you went through this. I’m not the only one. What it does to people, it’s not normal, there is no explanation. Ron is going to tell people we’re close to a solution. They think it’s just materials and heat and cold, it’s not that at all! Something horrible is going to happen Pete unless you help with this. Why won’t you answer me?

They fucking shitcanned me Pete! They did it because they didn’t want to hear the truth, and I was telling the truth! There are more and more cracks every day! Filling them won’t fix it! People are going to die. People are behaving crazy. Everything is falling apart. The piers, the rails, everything is vibrating apart from something, and they won’t spend the money to figure out what’s really wrong. I don’t understand how they can not know! You can HEAR IT when you’re standing NEXT TO IT! I can hear it now still and I’m at home! I’ll never take that train Pete. You stay away from it too! 

CALL ME BACK PLEASE

Sam.

Good day Peter,

I’m writing on behalf of a colleague and friend. She had asked me to reach out to you. Unfortunately, Samantha passed away yesterday after what appeared to be an automobile accident. She was adamant that if anything should happen to her, I should let you know. She gave me instructions to be as specific as possible. I understand this may be upsetting news, especially coming from a stranger. I hope I’m not out of line in sending this. Samantha had gone to the hospital days prior complaining of a very bad headache. She left the hospital indicating she had recovered after a stay of a couple of days. We believe the headache may have returned or another medical episode resulted in her accident. I have attached the obituary below. Arrangements for her and her two children who were in the van at the time are being made at the Connelley-Mckinley funeral home location on 111st. The full address is attached. 

I’m so sorry to be bringing this news, and my condolences.

Check your texts you turd. You’re slow to respond, just like Latifi. I need your picks for the USGP. You’re second in the pool and 10 pts off the lead. You’d be first by a mile, but you keep picking Lando.

I didn’t respond to your text because I was in a therapy session. And also, don’t you ever talk about the GOAT being slow to respond. He’s a national treasure. This week my picks will suck because I’ve had no time to check out what’s going on. Fuck it.

1. Verstappen (ughghghghg as much as I don’t want to admit it)

2. Checo

3. Lando (can’t stop won’t stop)

Sorry you have to watch this one alone but we’ll catch up when I get back.

Cracks. The cube had no cracks. It was perfectly smooth when it rose up from the water. At times it looked like a pencil drawing, scribbled and shaded in on one side. 

I had come back to ask it a question.

Four years ago I had discovered a car-sized concrete cube that my project management and engineering team had incorporated into Edmonton’s Tawatina bridge, a cube that had been emitting a low vibration and was seemingly destroying the rest of the valley line (as well as apparently driving people to suicide), I had returned to the original site that had caused my demise. It had caused one of my employees, Bill, to nearly take his own life. It had caused countless other contractors to experience things they couldn’t explain. It had caused me to essentially lose everything: my business and my family, and especially my sanity. I could at times hear it humming. Then, cracks started to appear on the piers further down the line, connected to the bridge.

So now was the time of reckoning. I needed to know why. Why me?

I was in my car, and for some reason I parked in Windsor car park. The University of Alberta campus is quite far from the Tawatina bridge. I remember walking along Saskatchewan Drive, and pausing ever so often to look at posted trail maps. I couldn’t read them, they seemed to be all mixed-up and gibberish to me. It was early afternoon, and a storm seemed to be gathering out of the west. 

Eventually the sidewalk ended next to 99th street. I crossed and headed towards the four glass pyramids of the Muttart Conservatory. I crossed 98th avenue without looking to see if traffic had stopped. An angry middle-aged man with a *Fuck Trudeau* sticker on his Dodge Ram swerved, honked, and showed me his middle finger when I had to be avoided.

I wasn’t sure how to get to the cube now that it was a part of the Tawatina bridge. So, I crawled down to the rocky outcrop that held the first pier. 

I stood there.

Nothing happened.

“Hey!” I yelled at the river.

Two homeless people emerged from the bushes where it became clear they hid a tent. They must have thought I was yelling at them. When they realized I wasn’t looking in their direction, they turned and continued back into the bush. 

“Hey…Cube!” I tried.

One of the homeless people came back out. 

“You got a smoke?” He asked me. His face was heavily scarred, as if he had been cut or burnt. 

“No, sorry.” I shrugged.

“There’s nothing you can do to make it stop singing.” He said. I initially wrote him off as high on meth, as I had assumed so many of the citizens inhabiting the river valley were. But then I paused for a second.

“Wait, make what stop singing?” I asked.

“The bridge. You can’t hear that? It’s like a humming noise, and it gets louder at night.” He scoffed at me and turned back into the brush.

Why couldn’t I hear it? I could *always* hear it. Sometimes in bed. Sometimes driving. Sometimes in a different city. Why couldn’t I hear it now?

“Come back and talk to me!” I yelled at the bridge, now becoming furious that after all this time it was denying me.

I picked up some rocks and hurled them into the water. The storm was moving closer. The wind picked up and blew gravel into my eyes. I decided to start heading back. I left with a parting shot. “Fine! Fuck you! Asshole!”

I turned and went to climb the embankment back to the path, and start the long trek back to my car. I had taken no more than two steps before I slipped and fell immediately backward. I simultaneously heard a crunch and a thud, both of my back and my head hitting the rocks. Pain immediately shot up from my tailbone to my neck and gripped me. I had hit my head and for a moment, could see nothing but white. I tried to struggle back to my feet, but my legs were uncooperative. I started to feel a numbness coming over me. 

“Help! Hello! Help!” I yelled. It was clear I needed medical attention. My head throbbed. Where had the homeless people that were mere feet from me gone?

“Can you hear me? I need help! Someone!” I screamed at the top of my lungs. I did not see anyone approach or hear anyone call back. The sky was growing darker with thick storm clouds, and thunder began echoing off the tall buildings of downtown, all of them steel-blue in my blurry vision. 

I took out my phone and tried to dial 911.

*Call failed*.

I had no service. How was that possible, I was right between the two most densely populated areas in Edmonton. 

I yelled up at the bridge. “Hey! Can you see me down here? Send help!” I could see pedestrians and joggers crossing, but none of them responded or even looked over the edge. 

I looked around for anyone else that may be near. I tried to wave to the opposite bank, and up on the bridge with my arms, but I could barely lift them. I realized that quite a large pool of blood had been gathering around my head and neck area. I started to get dizzy, and feel very weak. I tried yelling again but began to cough up blood.

Was this it? Was this how I’d go out? A bloody mess next to the Tawatina bridge pier?

I clutched my phone. Still no service. So instead, resigning my fate, I clicked on my camera roll, and let my gaze fall on my children one last time. A picture of them from a few weeks ago when we had gone for a picnic at Chikakoo Lake. 

The skies opened up, and suddenly it was pouring. However, the cold rain felt warm against my skin, as I faded in and out of consciousness. I tried to hold the image of my kids in my mind: the green and yellow of the foliage, their smiling faces bouncing around on playground equipment. My daughter embracing me, my son telling me how happy he was, and how it was the *best day ever*.

I had somehow slipped into the river. Submerged, I expected the water to be freezing and tumultuous as it appeared on the surface, but it was not. It was lukewarm and still. I sank to the bottom, face down, not being able to kick with my legs, and still on the edge of consciousness. I fumbled around against the riverbed. I had assumed it would be mucky, soft, and dirty. But it was smooth and cool, like the bottom of a glass aquarium. 

*I had found it!*

I tried, with all my remaining energy, to knock and somehow enter. But nothing came. I ran out of breath. I began inhaling water while desperately thrashing, unable to make it back to the surface, and eventually resigning myself to the fact I would die. I saw my kids in my mind’s eye once again, on a fall afternoon. 

And then white. And red? I breathed in. I could breathe?

I was in the cube.

The last time I had entered it was white and sterile, cool and crisp like the inside of an ice arena. This time it was warm with the glow of a crackling fire. I could faintly hear a fire, and see the light cast from it, but as I looked around in the four walls, no fire existed. 

The inside of the cube had a floor of polished concrete. The walls were white, as was the ceiling. The last time I was in the cube, I had to walk a very long time to reach a wall, and the walls seemingly expanded to infinity, or at least as large as the cube wanted, I thought. This time was different. The interior seemed smaller, the ceiling height much lower, probably about 9 or 10 feet. The distance between the walls seemed about 30 feet in each direction, and the walls didn’t seem to escape me as I approached them.

I walked to over to one wall and pounded on it. 

“Can you hear me now, you motherfucker?” I wailed.

Nothing.

I walked over to the adjacent wall and began kicking it.

“Do you feel that? Answer me!”

I approached the third wall. It seemed to be highly polished. I ran my hand along it, looking for a seam or button, or any small imperfection that would give the cube some sort of depth, life, or history. I found only the reflection of my fingers, which did not even leave fingerprint marks on the surface.

I began to reason. If there was a reflection, and I could see clearly inside the cube, then there must be a source of light somewhere. I began trying to trace the direction of the light source that corresponded with my shadow. I walked and turned, and looked back at the reflection again to see if the orientation had changed. It had! I turned and walked in the other direction, and the reflection changed again! There must be a panel or *something* emitting light from a singular source or direction. I tried a third time. Only this time, the reflection kept going when I stopped. A wave of terror washed over me like receiving a sudden static shock. It wasn’t a reflection. The panel wasn’t completely opaque, and there was someone on the other side. 

I quickly started in one direction and then stopped. My mind was racing so quickly about what to do I froze on the spot. What if it was an alien? What if it wasn’t friendly? What if it was someone else trapped down here like me? I ran directly towards it.

“Hey! Hey, are you stuck down here?!”

It stopped and turned towards the panel and put one hand on the surface. 

I put my hand against its resting hand. 

“Hey can you hear me?”

It put its other hand against the glass. I also put my palm against the surface. At least I could confirm they were human hands, probably adult male, about the same size as mine. 

“Hey man, knock if you can hear me!”

I pounded on the glass. One of the hands slapped the glass back. We were getting somewhere. If only I could find out how to communicate with it better. 

“Do you know morse code? You can tap maybe?” I tapped on the glass. I didn’t actually *know* morse code, but I thought something was better than nothing. The hands shrugged and then pressed themselves back against the surface.

I looked around the room again, desperately trying to find something, anything, that would allow me to make contact with who or whatever was on the other side. A seam indicating a door? A blunt object? 

I turned back toward the panel, but the figure was no longer there. I pounded on it a few more times. “Hey! Come back! Let’s communicate!”

I waited a few seconds. Silence.

“Hello?”

I waited longer. It could have been only a minute. It felt like hours. 

I shrugged and turned back around.

He was behind me.

He *was* me.

I couldn’t move. He charged at me.

“You pestilent fuck, now I’ll finally be rid of you!” It screamed at me. I ducked out of the way as best I could. 

“Don’t you fucking run, you’re finally going to get what you deserve!” He took a swing at me. 

“Woah, woah stop, what the fuck?” I exclaimed. “I don’t know what you think I did!”

It tackled me and pinned me down. I would have thought if it truly was me, that I would know all of its moves, and would at least come out even, but whatever this was – it was much stronger than me.

“Nothing. You did nothing. That’s what you are. So just disappear and be the nothing that you are, Goddamnit!” It tried to wrestle with me, to attempt to grab my neck, but we were both equally in compromising positions and I was able to resist. 

“You should have insisted they use dynamite or something. Not incorporate it! Now we’re both stuck down here because you’re fucking stupid!” It grunted.

“It wasn’t my call!” I insisted. 

“All of you fucking people and your free will. Any one of you could have done it. Bill didn’t have the balls, he had to cut himself instead. Sam wrecked herself on purpose. And you, you’re the most pathetic of all. You cut yourself in the shower you fucking pussy. You’re all a bunch of Goddamned sheep!” It spit on me while it talked. 

“It took you four years to come back here? I thought I was getting through to you, but you are too busy hiding out like a little bitch.” I began to become less bewildered and just plain angry. Both angry because of the sudden onslaught of surprise violence, but also angry at myself. The alter-me was right. I did hide. 

“Fuck you.” I spit back. 

“No, fuck you! I won’t let you leave again. I’ll fucking kill you and every pathetic piece of shit that comes down here until there isn’t a single one of you left.” It barked as it inched it’s hands closer to my neck. 

The interlude of dialogue had left me just enough time to calm down a bit and strategize. Although I was holding him off, I wasn’t in a position to escape. I remembered one or two very basic Jiujitsu moves a friend had taught me once. If he was indeed me, and was really angry as I was prone to become sometimes, he wouldn’t be rational enough to expect it coming. I thought of using a mount escape, it was the very first thing my friend had taught me. I also remember how he showed me you could choke someone with their own Gi. We were both wearing my favorite Whet Blu leather jacket. That would more than suffice. 

I kept telling myself *stay calm and focus.*

I managed to begin writhing and bumping enough to throw him slightly off balance. I got my thumb in deep into the collar of the jacket and began to cross and pull. I was right. He didn’t expect it. He instinctively tried to reach his hands to his neck to try and loosen my grip, but I had him very tight. I put him in a full guard.  

“Now who’s the bitch, motherfucker!” I yelled, right before he collapsed. 

I rolled him off of me and stood up. Only one of us would leave alive, or, if I was now trapped here, I would certainly not risk having “me” around to try and kill me again. I began to unabashedly kick his head repeatedly, filled with emotion, hate, disgust, until there was barely anything distinguishable left. I was angry at him. I was angry at myself, so that made it okay, but I also wanted to be kind to myself – I had, he had, been through a lot. So I began to weep. I fell to my knees. 

The light inside the cube suddenly grew more intense. It became cooler. I was suddenly aware of the sweat on my brow as cold air blew against it. I slowly rose.

I couldn’t see an exit. I could, however, see on the opposite wall there was something now there.

I began walking towards it. Once again, as with the first time, it seemed to take hours to walk to the other end. 

When I reached the wall, I turned to look at the distance I had travelled. The other walls seemed just as close as they had when I embarked on the walk, but I could barely see the other me I had just dispatched, a tiny disfigured red dot in the distance. 

I turned back to the wall.

On it was a picture frame, the photo inside being the photo I had taken on the fall picnic of my kids to Chikakoo lake. 

Underneath there was a tiny etching in the wall.

*Now you’ve got something to die for.*

**October 12, 2022**

I woke up to the intensely loud music of *Lamb of God*. It was evening. I tried to peel the sweat soaked and bloody sheets off my body, but they stuck to the self-inflicted wounds I had made trying to escape the hum of the cube earlier. Luckily most of them were superficial, and although they stung, they had slowed down to a small ooze or simply appeared to be bad scratches, as if I had recently adopted a very angry cat.

I got up to clean myself and dress my wounds when my phone rang. It was my friend Steve. I answered.

“Hey man. Can you text me instead, I’m just in Nashville…” I started.

“Yeah, I had to call you though, this was too big a deal to text.” He began. I put him on speaker so I could tend to myself while talking.

“Okay, what’s up?”

“Sam Schecter died.”

“Oh, yeah, I know.” I shrugged. 

“Oh did Kelsey get a hold of you?” He said. 

“Who’s Kelsey?” I mumbled.

“What do you mean…who’s…what the…didn’t you read it in your email?” Steve stammered.

“I haven’t checked my email in days. Anyway, I haven’t talked to her in years. It is sad though, for sure.”

Steve raised his voice a little. “Dude, I don’t get you sometimes. We all used to be like best friends. Not sure how you can be so nonchalant.”

“Well, I mean yeah, but people die sometimes.” I said as if I hadn’t just had a dream about strangling myself and then kicking in my own skull. 

“Not like this, man. Apparently she took a run at a concrete pier with her BMW as fast as she could. There’s dashcam footage someone caught of it, looks like she did it on purpose.” He said, emotionally. 

“Hm, wonder why she would do that.” I respondent faintly. 

“I dunno man, she seemed like she had everything going for her. Stress, maybe? She was working on the valley line and…”

“She was working on the valley line?” I cut Steve off.

“Yeah, you know how stressful that can be, I mean it made you basically want to retire.” He said, and sort of inappropriately chuckled after. He continued. “Anyway, there will be a service, hope you can come after you get back.”

“Sure thing.” I said, and bid him farewell.

How did I know Sam was dead? The other “me” had said something about her “wrecking herself on purpose.” But that was a dream. I must have heard it somewhere? Maybe I saw it while checking my email at some other time?

I sat down on the bed. Maybe it was time I went through all my unread emails. 

I scrolled all the way back to the first unread. July 16, 2022. I tapped to open the email. I received a notification. It was from Vanessa.

*Don’t forget your prescription! Get out and have a good time!*

I stared at my phone for a long time. Then, I finally rose, walked to the closet, and threw on a pair of jeans and those white python boots I had bought earlier. I past the bathroom mirror just to check myself out before exiting the Air BnB. 

Scrawled in the steam:

*Now you've got something to die for.*
