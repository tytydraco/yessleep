**June 2025**

Hey, it’s me. Last time, I told you about how gargoyles came into our store. Things haven’t improved since then. In fact, I’d argue things have only gotten worse.

Oh, before anything else, I didn’t exactly explain my coworker’s last time. Spike’s 21, tall with spiked black hair, and he’s working here while he does class online for college.

Lily is studying abroad from Wales, she’s 20, short and has bangs. She’s leaving in September, so give-or-take 4-5 months.

Anyways, back to the fun stuff.

So, the store was destroyed, and it’s been a couple weeks since it happened. No, I’m still working (unfortunately), and it’s going about as well as you could expect.

 Here’s how the store was destroyed.

“I can’t believe it managed to cut the power.” Spike said, waving his flashlight around.

“It isn’t completely unreasonable.” I replied, testing out the features of mine. The strobe setting is pretty cool.

I guess we didn’t hear the doors open because Lily managed to sneak up on us at the registers.

“What’s with the flashlights?” She asked sarcastically.

“Guess.” Spike replied, spinning his flashlight like a drumstick.

“Hmm,” she said, putting a finger on her chin, “the power wouldn’t happen to be out, would it?”  
Spike looked at me with a smile before putting his focus back on her.

“DING DING DING!” He yelled.

“Okay.” Lily said, turning to me. “What caused it?”

“We think it’s a mutant cat.” I said with one-hundred percent seriousness.

“What?”

“Mutant cat.” I repeated.

Now, between you and me, there are a multitude of reasons as to why she shouldn’t have believed us. On the other hand, she’s probably seen enough stuff here to believe us.

“Nah, you’re messing with me.” She said, crossing her arms.

“Wish I was.” I replied, going over to the automatic doors. Before I left the store, I turned to her.

“You wanna come’n see?”

We walked out into the parking lot and kept going until we met the edge of the road where it met the lot.

“Alright,” I said, pointing to the roof, “take a look.”

She looked up and then down, and then at me.

“Hmm.” She said as she tilted her head. She then nudged me. “You sure you’re not hallucinating or something?”

“Absolutely sure.” I replied.

I was absolutely sure we weren’t hallucinating. I mean, could three people see the same vision at the same time? I was way too sure for this not to be a hallucination.

A cat stood atop the roof of the store. The only difference between this one and a regular old house feline was that the size of it.

This thing was roughly the size of a school bus. I mean, it is a mutant.

“How long?” Lily asked.

“Hm?” I replied.

“How long has it been there?”

“Uh, it wasn’t here when I clocked in, if that helps.”

“And where it came from?"

“No clue.”

Before we could continue our conversation, a sound rang out across the parking lot. It was the sound of crumbling wood and concrete.

Our roof was going to cave in, and this cat was the culprit.

“Wait, I think it’s—” I was cut off by the loud sound of our roof caving in.

The cat had fallen through the roof. And it likely destroyed most of the store.

“God dammit.” I said, and we all ran back to the store.

Rushing inside, we found that, to nobody’s surprise, the store was ruined. I had to call our manager as this was definitely not something we could handle.

“Hey, Kent.”

“Hey, what’s happening?”

“Promise you won’t be mad?”

“Okay… I promise.”

“A mutant cat destroyed our store.”

“Okay, that isn’t too ba—wait, what?”

“A cat dest—”

“Yeah, I got it, sorry. I’m gonna head over now.”

5 minutes later, Kent and the police were at our store.

Not too much happened afterward, but Spike and I did find one thing out; the cat could change how big or small it was. How?

We found a jug of water with small, claw sized holes in it.

Kent told us that we could take the next couple weeks off from work if we wanted. Yeah, because I was going to work in these conditions.

“If I can convince the Carpenter Goblins to rebuild the store, then you’ll be back in no time.”

Hopefully the store gets rebuilt soon. Not because I care or want to work, but I need some money, and I hopefully get paid next week.

 

So yeah, everything is kind of okay again, I think. The store is all rebuilt now, so that’s a positive!

Those goblins were actually able to get it done in the 14 days Kent allotted for them. In fact, they got it done in less time than that, sweet!

The only way they agreed to do it was if they could put a sign up next to the main one with “COURTESY OF THE WORLD’S GREATEST BUILDERS: THE CARPENTER GOBLINS" written on it.

Well, I don’t suppose people will spend too much time looking at the sign, anyways.

 

So, Lily told me about something that happened to her yesterday. The store was finally rebuilt, as stated above. It’s actually open now. Well, it was reopened a few days ago, on the 2^(nd), actually.

I go in tomorrow, so I’ll probably have something to tell you about, but this little anecdote comes from our resident Welsh. This is how she encountered a shapeshifter.

 

Uh, this store is really weird.

When I started working here for real, Spike and Ollie told me that I was going to encounter a whole lot of weird stuff. They said it with a hint of anticipation in both of their voices.

Anyways, they’re sure to love this one.

I was going about my usual assistant duties; stocking, fronting, checking the back to make sure we actually had backstock of what a customer was asking for. You know, normal stuff.

I had just finished putting out a bottle of maple syrup when a noise from the next aisle over alerted me. It was… *rustling*. Strange, but not uncommon.

I quickly got up and made my way over to the next aisle. Before I could enter, a crash rang out from wherever the person causing the ruckus was. Followed by that was a flurry of growls and what sounded like animal noises.

This was getting weirder and weirder but as a store assistant, my job is to help any and every customer that needs it. Even the kind of weird ones.

I finally entered the aisle, which turned out to be the snack one. As I looked up, I saw what looked like a grizzly bear right in the middle of the floor, snout deep in a bag of all-dressed chips and grunting.

Obviously, I had to do something about this; you can’t just take a product and eat it without paying, so I spoke up.

“Sir, you’re going to have to pay for those.”

With a crinkle, he removed the bag from his, face, I guess. And he looked at me, at least I think it was a he, I don’t quite know, it was a shapeshifter for God’s sake.

I cleared my throat and went to repeat myself when he interrupted me.

“HRNGH.”

I stood firm and spoke again.

“I can’t understand you, but you need to pay for the chips. They are not free.”

“HNGRAH.”

“Please?”

I suppose the thought of having to actually pay for what it ate pissed the bear off, because the next thing I knew, a tantrum ensued.

He whipped the bag of chips in my direction, and they landed a few feet away from me, the remaining contents strewn about the snack aisle.

I was a bit irritated by this knowing that I would have to clean it up afterwards. So? I did the only thing I could in the moment; I yelled at the bear.

“HEY! The HELL’s your problem?! It—it’s like you’re acting like a wild animal or something!” I was going to follow it up with something, but I realized something.

This technically *was* a wild animal, so I lowered my tone and spoke again.

“Okay, I’m sorry about that, you can have the chips. Just don’t destroy anything, please.”

With that, the bear stood up on its hind legs and morphed into a bird.

“Wha—are you—”

It then squawked at me before flying up and going through our automatic doors.

Okay, I’m not an expert, but I do not think a bear, or any living thing for that matter should be able to change its appearance like that.

\-EDIT-

It was a shapeshifter. Of course it was something like that. Anyways, some Carpenter Goblins want to buy chewing gum so I should probably be going now. Hope you enjoy the story, Spike, Ollie.

Well, that was kind of weird, huh? Well, I think Spike and I encountered something similar. This part’ll be told from his perspective for some reason.

Alright, I might have lied a bit, I go in AGAIN tomorrow. Some weird shit happened yesterday when me and Spike were at the store. Anyways, here’s the story.

 

What’s good, shoppers? Just kidding, it’s Spike, and I’m still alive! Ollie and I nearly died yesterday, but we got out alive.

It was a boring Wednesday shift. I would wish for a normal customer to come in every once in a while, but that’s just a wish. Anyways, I think a Skin-Walker came in yesterday.

I was tending to one of our registers when Ollie called me to the front.

“Spike? Gonna need you to get out here.”

“Oh? What’s up?”  
“A labradoodle just walked into the store on two legs.”

“Ah—wait, which legs?”

“It’s walking on its h—why does that matter? It is walking on its hind legs.”

“Mm. I’m just curious. I’ll be right out.”

And that I was.

When I finally got to the front of the store, I could see what Ollie was talking about, and to be frank? It was quite unnerving.

The labradoodle was walking around on two legs, just sniffing around. It was locking eyes with us and keeping fixed contact though.

“H—hey!” I yelled. “L—looking for something specific?”

If a dog came in here just to buy nothing, it’d look a bit strange.

Ollie responded to me.

“It is a dog, Spike, it can’t understand you.”

“Worth a try.” I said, looking back at him.

I pulled out a notepad and pen; maybe we could communicate through this. I wrote down “what are you here for?” on it and handed the message over to the dog.

It didn’t take the paper; it instead opened its mouth. It didn’t speak, rather, the voice sounded like it was simply coming from the dog. It was almost as though it was radiating from the dog.

“Human flesh.”

I looked at it. “You want… that?”

It nodded.

“We don’t sell that.”

I suppose this thing was used to getting its way, because the response to being told ‘no’ was to simply let out an unearthly scream before shedding the dog skin and dropping to a crab-walking position.

“Ollie. Are you seein’ this?”

He turned to me and pointed at his temple with his left hand while sticking his tongue out and doing a twirling motion with his right index finger. “Yeah, I’m seein’ it.”

Asshole.

I turned back to the thing and asked one question.

“What do you want!?”

It looked at me and its body radiated the next words.

“To consume you.”

“Spike, I think we gotta do something here!” Ollie yelled. I agreed.

He grabbed a steak from the cooler and scribbled “HUMAN FLESH” on the packaging.

“Ollie. If this doesn’t work, then it was good working with you.”

“Nah.” He replied. “I gotta graduate high school first, and you need to graduate college.”

We rushed to the front of the store with that thing right behind us. Making our way outside, we climbed onto the roof of my car. Ollie went to throw the meat, but I stopped him.

“Hey, let me do it. I played ball in H.S.”

“You’d better not be lying.”

“Watch me.”

I grabbed the meat and with the force of a thousand tee-ball players, threw it out of the parking lot and into the middle of the street.

Surprisingly, the thing noticed it and pounced on the meat.

At the same time that this thing was feasting, an oil tanker was making its way down the road.

Unbeknownst to the driver, there was someone in the road, and that someone happened to be our flesh-eating friend, and our flesh-eating friend just so happened to get run over.

Unable to brake in time, the driver behind the tanker crashed into it. Somehow, both drivers managed to get away and the vehicles, as well as the thing blew up.

“Wow.” Ollie said, watching as the flames licked the edge of the road. “We did that, huh?”  
I put my hand on his shoulder. “We did wat we had to, and that is what matters.”

Nothing else really happened that day, some white dude bought an energy drink but that’s about it.

Well, it’s Ollie again. That’s all I can write for now, as I’m feeling really tired and I’m probably not ready for whatever is going to enter the store tomorrow.

Until next time, -Ollie.

-EDIT-

It was not a Skin-Walker. We’re thinking it was the shapeshifter Lily encountered, but we could be wrong. Either way, it is dead, and we are not.
