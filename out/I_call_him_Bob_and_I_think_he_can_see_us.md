I only call him Bob because giving him a name feels safer. But nothing about him is safe. He sees everything. I don’t know what he is. A presence, maybe. A watcher. But he’s real. I’ve seen what happens when he looks at people too long.

It started as a joke. “Bob can see us,” I used to say when someone did something shady. But I wasn’t really joking. Not deep down. Because after a while, I started seeing things - moments that didn’t involve me but felt… shown to me. I don’t know how to explain it. It’s like Bob *wanted* me to know.

I saw two men in a parking garage once. I was across the street, just walking home. One of them - Trevor, I think - asked the other, Antonio, if "she" was there. Antonio popped the trunk of a red Mustang. There was a woman inside. Tied up. Crying. Mascara streaked down her face like melting ink. I froze.

“She fresh?” Trevor asked, sliding off his sunglasses like he was inspecting produce.

“All but the mouth,” Antonio smirked.

My blood turned to ice.

Then Trevor stopped. I watched him look around, like he felt the air change. “Dude... let’s go,” he whispered. “I think Bob’s watching.”

They ran. Left the woman right there and peeled off like cowards.

Another time I was watching the news. Ray Seaborn - some hotshot celebrity under tax fraud investigation - was mobbed by reporters outside a hotel. I blinked, and suddenly I saw them *differently*. Like I was right there, just behind the rope line. Ray’s agent leaned in and whispered something about a deal with the IRS. Something off the record. Ray laughed - big teeth, movie-star grin.

Then his agent went pale.

“Bob’s here,” he muttered.

Ray stopped smiling. I swear he looked *right at me* through the screen.

Tabitha was just a girl. I don’t even know her. But I saw her, too. Slamming her bedroom door, screaming at her parents. Her friend Amy called, telling her to sneak out for a party. Tabitha laughed and said she’d find a way - the fire ladder or something.

Then she went quiet.

“Ames… I’ll skip this one,” she said softly. “Bob’s here.”

I could almost feel him in the room with her. Watching. Breathing cold across her neck.

And then… I started feeling him in my own life. When I almost took cash from my roommate’s drawer. When I typed a lie into a job application. When I watched something I shouldn’t. Always, I’d pause. My chest would tighten. Like something was standing just behind me.

Bob doesn’t punish. Not directly. He just *sees*. That’s enough. The people who feel him - really feel him - always stop before they go too far. The others? I don’t think they get a second chance.

He doesn’t care about excuses. He doesn’t miss the little things. The small betrayals. The cruel jokes. The stolen time. You feel him watching, and suddenly, you can’t pretend you’re the good guy anymore.

Bob sees Antonio and Trevor. He sees Ray. He sees Tabitha.

Bob sees me.

And if you’re reading this?

He sees you, too.
