Sometimes,  my neighbor Amy, asks me to babysit for her. I never really complain. She’s a polite woman, a single mother. Her daughter, Emma, is a calm, quiet five-year-old. Sweet kid. She mostly obeys me. Sometimes she pouts and tosses her little tea set around, flipping her tiny plastic table when she gets upset.

But she has a strange habit.

She tugs at my sleeve and whispers,
“Can you check the peephole and see if Danny is here?”

I figured it was a game,

some imaginary friend she invented for her tea parties. I'd humor her and peek through the peephole. Every time, it was empty.

By dusk, Amy would return from work, thank me, and I’d head home.

Recently, while we were chatting after she came back, I casually mentioned the peephole game.

Her face… changed.

“Alex,” she said slowly. Her voice didn’t match her usual warm tone.
“Please… don’t do that anymore.”

She didn’t elaborate. Just mumbled that it was a habit she wanted Emma to grow out of.

But it didn’t sit right with me.

The next day, I was back babysitting. Emma played with her dollhouse and tea set like usual.

But her mom’s warning lingered.

Then she looked up at me with those wide, expectant eyes.
“Alex… can you check if Danny is here yet?”

I hesitated. “Emma, you know Danny isn’t real, right?”

She frowned. “He is real! I invited him!”

I tried to keep my tone light. “Emma… he never comes, sweetheart.”

Suddenly she screamed,
“PLEASE!! DANNY IS HERE!! I TOLD HIM TO COME!!”

She flipped her tea set, threw cups, tugged my shirt, hitting me with her small hands.

I froze. She’d never acted like this.

“Okay, okay!” I said, holding her wrists gently. “I’ll check. Just calm down, okay?”

I walked to the door. And the closer I got, the more wrong everything felt.

The air was still. Heavier than before.

I swallowed hard and cleared my throat.
“Mr. Danny, are you there?”

Silence.

“See, no one’s-”

Knock.

A single, sharp knock echoed from the other side.

My skin crawled.

Emma’s voice was calm behind me:
“Mr. Danny doesn’t say anything. You have to peek.”

I stared at the door. Hesitated. Then slowly lifted two fingers to the peephole…

A screwdriver burst through.

It stabbed through the tiny opening, grazing my hand. Blood splattered the door.

I screamed.

Behind me, Emma clapped and giggled,
“Danny’s here! Danny’s here!!”

I stood frozen, staring at the metal jutting out like a twisted handshake.

I didn’t say a word the rest of the evening. Just sat nearby. Watching her.

When Amy returned, I asked:
“Who is Danny?”

She stiffened. Avoided eye contact.

Then finally said,
“Danny… was my husband. He died a year ago. Emma doesn’t know. She kept asking when he’d come home, so I told her… maybe someday.”

She sighed. “It was just a silly lie. I didn’t think she’d still remember…”

I didn’t know how to explain what happened.
I just stopped babysitting after that.


Now, I can’t look through a peephole like I used to.

Every time I approach my door, I place two fingers on the peephole first.
Even though it’s thick. Even though I know it’s just metal and glass.

I can’t help it but check, 

Even when no one is on the other side.
