 When I first saw the house on the outskirts of town, I couldn't shake the feeling that it was made for me. It was old, run-down, but full of potential, like a blank canvas waiting for an artist. I couldn't believe that the price for the house was surprisingly low. I wanted this house to become my dream place. The house was in the forest; the only problem was the broken internet cable, but I still wanted to renovate it, so I decided to buy it and take matters into my own hands.

I started the renovation from scratch—first removing the damaged floors, dismantling broken installations, and stripping off old wallpapers. Every day I woke up before dawn, armed with tools and unrelenting determination. It seemed that the house, despite its condition, had its own soul that I was trying to uncover. Often during work, I felt as if the walls were telling me stories of the past, and its wrinkles were like traces of memories I was trying to decipher.

During one of these sessions, while peeling away layers of rotting plaster from some walls, I came across something completely unexpected. Deep recesses in the walls concealed something I hadn't anticipated—a bricked-up room, with no doors. I began to slowly tear down the bricks that obstructed the access until I finally managed to reveal the hidden space. Inside, there was darkness and a musty smell, but I noticed something that immediately caught my attention: an old, dusty journal lying on a wooden desk in the corner.

I reached for the journal. The cover was worn out, and the pages were brown with age. The journal was signed with the name Tom on the first page, where there was an elegant signature of the author.

I didn't have time to read the journal right away. Each day I spent hours working on the house, changing damaged installations, removing old coatings, and repairing what needed urgent attention. Time was mercilessly pressing me; every minute was precious, and every second spent working on the house seemed to have its own significance. Only at night, when exhausted from daily tasks, could I finally sit in silence and open the journal. Then, after lighting a lamp, I began to read its contents with focus, but I warn you, its content is truly terrifying.

Tom's journal:

I had always dreamed of having my own place. After years of living in rental apartments, I finally managed to buy my own house in the forest near the city. Finding the perfect place wasn't easy, but I ended up with a cozy, old house. It had its charm and that nostalgic vibe that drew me in.

 I hoped to get to know people in the area soon, but for now, I focused on adjusting to the new surroundings. Every day I found small pleasures in daily chores, such as tending the garden or browsing through old books in the attic. Unfortunately, this idyll didn't last long.

The first days were fantastic. I moved in, unpacked my things, and started arranging the space according to my tastes. I didn't have many friends in the city yet, so I spent most of my time alone. I felt happy and calm. Unfortunately, this tranquility was quickly disrupted.

It all began at night, a few weeks after moving in.
That evening I returned home. The rain was still pouring from the sky, and the wind howled like crazy, creating an unsettling backdrop for my thoughts. When I stepped inside, I felt the atmosphere in the house was heavier than usual. The darkness that enveloped the interior seemed denser and more oppressive. Lying in bed, I tried to fall asleep, but sleep wouldn't come. Instead, I lay listening to the rhythmic sound of the rain hitting the windows. My mind was full of tension, and every noise seemed to amplify my worries. Suddenly, I heard strange noises coming from the chimney. Initially, I thought it was just birds or some animals that might have gotten stuck in the flue. The sounds were subtle, like something moving inside. I tried to ignore it, but each night they became louder.

At first, it was gentle tapping and rustling. I heard something that resembled scratching. Over time, the sounds became more rhythmic and regular, as if something was trying to escape from inside the chimney. I was sure it was something alive, but every time I tried to check, I couldn't see anything unusual.

Soon after, other, more disturbing noises began to appear. I heard faint, unintelligible whispers. They sounded like indistinct voices trying to convey something, but I couldn't catch the words. Over time, these whispers became louder and clearer. The whispers spoke of things that are only spoken of in hell.

One night I heard something that will stay with me forever.
A scream—terrifying, otherworldly, a scream that came from the chimney. The sounds were filled with suffering and despair, as if something terrible was trying to escape, and its pain and anger were almost palpable. Each night, the noises became more complex. I felt that the whispers were accompanied by various emotions: anger, despair.

I had enough of it, I decided to move out in the next few days.

The next evening, after a day full of unease, the noises in the chimney reached a horrifying level. The scratching sounds were so intense that they seemed to penetrate the walls. The loud, persistent noises were like an expression of some deep rage or pain trying to break through.

At one point, when I heard that terrifying noise again, coming from behind the door to my bedroom, I approached the door from which the sounds were coming. My heart started to beat faster. I knew I had to check what was happening on the other side. I looked through the keyhole, but saw only darkness. However, I felt that something was wrong.

Then I realized that this darkness was not ordinary darkness. What I saw were two deep, black eye sockets that seemed to be staring at me with an unnatural intensity.

Suddenly, scratching began on the door as if something was trying to break through the barrier between the chimney and my room. The claws were sharp, and their sounds were filled with terrifying determination. I tried to understand what was happening, but the feeling of hopelessness and fear began to overwhelm me. It was trying to get in...
A cold shiver ran through my body, and the scratching noises turned into persistent, powerful thuds. Before I could react, the door began to shake in its frame as if someone was trying to tear it off. The banging grew more intense, and the creaking of the door hinges resembled a terrifying, screeching wail. Finally, the door flew off its hinges with a crash and fell to the floor with a loud thud. Terrified, I watched as a figure slowly emerged from the thick darkness. Its white, almost lifeless skin was stretched over thin bones and long, sharp claws extended from its fingers. The blackened, empty eye sockets stared at me with a gaze that was terrifying. The figure slowly emerged from the gloom, its movements both fluid and wild. A cold draft that accompanied it filled the room with icy air. Its cold, dead voice broke the silence: 

“You were watching.”

A terrifying chill filled my entire body. Fear gripped me completely, and my legs refused to move. In an instant, I felt weakness overtaking my body, and then darkness obscured all my senses. I don't remember how I fell to the floor. All I knew was the sensation of falling violently and sudden loss of consciousness.

When I woke up, my heart wouldn't stop racing. I reached for my phone, dialing the emergency number with trembling hands. I decided to lie, claiming that someone had broken in. I wanted to avoid being considered insane. After a few minutes, I heard the police car arriving. The officers entered my room, their steps loud and decisive, and their presence was supposed to bring relief. However, when I showed them the damaged door and room, their reaction was different from what I expected. After thoroughly searching the room, talking to me, and assessing the situation, the police officers found no tangible evidence of what might have happened. They only noticed broken door traces and damaged frame, but found no clues that could explain the damage. After these events, every sound I hear in this house makes me tremble with fear. I'm increasingly convinced that what lives in the chimney is something far more terrifying, a nightmare from my childhood.

I loaded the car with the most essential items and turned the key, but the vehicle remained motionless. I got out and lifted the hood, discovering that the engine was completely wrecked. I reached for the phone to call for help, but the internet cabel was cut. At that moment, a terrifying scream echoed in my ears from deep within the forest.

Now, at night, I sit at the desk, trying to organize my thoughts, writing down what happened in recent days. I decided to barricade the remnants of the destroyed door with furniture—bookshelves, dressers, and all the heavy things I could find for the night. It's the only thing I could do to feel a little safer.

Night has fallen as I try to record these events that are so hard to understand. I sit at the desk in the dim light, with only the desk lamp casting a faint light on the pages. With each passing moment as the night deepens, the atmosphere in the house becomes more oppressive.
I hear it, the slow scratching has begun...
I'm so sorry.
