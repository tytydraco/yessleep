[\[Part 44\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/RandomAppalachian468/comments/1o78mj9/the_call_of_the_breach_part_44/)

Petrified, I stared up at her from the ground, mind whirling in desperation. Our men fought each other no more than sixty yards away, but I knew none of them would hear us over the chaos of battle. No, here in this small corner of the ruined hilltop, Crow and I were effectively alone, and no one was coming to save me.

She grinned in a malicious way that remined me of the Puppets, wide, unforgiving, without remorse. Crow didn’t bother reaching for her rifle, or the handgun at her side, and instead angled her head to gaze at my bleeding ankle with satisfaction. “Hurts, doesn’t it?”

I didn’t say anything back, heart racing in my chest, and tried to gauge how close my right hand was to my holstered pistol. If I could draw before she got to me . . . oh, who was I kidding? Crow stood only a few feet away. I wouldn’t even clear leather before her blade was in my throat.

*She won’t be distracted as easily as someone else might have been. She’s too smart. What on earth do I do?*

“Not my finest shot.” In response to my silence, Crow inched closer, almost completely at ease in the chaos, as if she feared neither me, nor the bullets that whipped around the battlefield. “But you’re pretty fast. Shame you won’t be that way anymore.”

Gritting my teeth, I couldn’t help but press a hand to my throbbing ankle, wondering how bad the injury was. Would I bleed out? Were the bones broken? Would I be crippled forever?

“Did you know his name?” She pointed at me with the blade, her smile fading to a hardened impasse that brooked no emotion. “The man you killed? Did you even bother to ask?”

In the depths of memory, I saw again the soldier in the southlands, the one I’d shot out of reflex, my first human kill. I hadn’t meant to, it had been closer to an accident than combat, but all the same, Crow had been there to see it. She must have known him, that I’d figured on for a while now, but it still made a small prickle of guilt run through me. He’d been delirious, even firing on Crow to keep me safe from her attack, though I wondered if he thought I was someone else. Either way, I *had* killed him, and I doubted his face would ever fade from my mind.

With one eye on the knife in her hand, I gulped a bitter lump in my throat and tried to keep pressure on my wounded ankle. “I was trying to save him.”

To my surprise, Crow laughed with venom to her tone, as though the thought amused her. “Of course you were. That’s always the excuse, isn’t it? ‘I didn’t mean to.’ ‘I don’t understand.’ ‘It’s not my fault.’ I can’t tell you how many times I’ve heard that shit.”

My blood ran cold at the realization that these were things her victims had said in the bowels of the Organ prison cells, pleas for mercy from people she’d tortured that fell on deaf ears. I had no way to escape, my brain out of fresh ideas, and all I could think of were my own stunned questions.

“Why did you kill Tex?” I winced at the pain in my leg and blinked up at her from the muck. “Or Kaba? We had a deal, there would have been peace . . .”

Something flickered in her dark irises, and a deadly gleam came forth that told me I’d said too much.

*Wham.*

Quick as lightning, she rose to her feet and slammed a boot down on my bloody ankle so that I writhed in pain under Crow’s attack. “Peace? *Peace?* You think I want peace after everything you’ve done?”

*Wham.*

Another strike caught me in the face, and I felt my nose shift under the impact as the cartilage buckled.

“It’s all gone!” Crow’s voice rose to a high shriek, manic and rage filled, as if she were burning from the inside out. “Everything is ruined! You did this to us, and you want *peace?*”

*Wham.*

Her boot heel connected with my chest to force the air from my lungs, my arms and legs pummeled, and I curled into a ball to defend myself.

“How could you?” She screamed as if a switch had been flipped, and the calm, collected soldier vanished from inside Crow’s head to leave behind a hysteric demon of a girl. “We didn’t do anything wrong! *We were sleeping!”*

Confused, terrified, and gasping in pain from the furious assault, I tried to reach for my handgun, but Crow yanked it from my fingers and clubbed it against my head so that stars exploded before my eyes. When I attempted to form a sonic scream, Crow’s fist caught my throat and made my esophagus burn. I couldn’t reach my knife, couldn’t think, my fighting instinct overwhelmed at the sheer intensity of it all.

Convinced I would be beaten to death, I at last managed a desperate cry between the blows. “What do you want from me?”

Just like that, the attack stopped, and steely fingers wove themselves into my hair to jerk my face upward from the mud.

She crouched over me, backlight by the flaming helicopter so that in the darkness Crow almost looked like a phantom. Shadows engulfed her features, until only the gleam of distant fires reflected off Crow’s irises as she leaned close to snarl words that dripped pure hatred. “*I want my family back*.”

It was then that I caught sight of a small silver bracelet on her wrist just below the gloved hand, one etched with the swirling words *Collingswood Girls Soccer.*

*Oh crap.*

Never could I forget the burned city with its clouds of poisoned ash, the melted streets and charred rubble. I recalled the strange visions, the screams of the people, the sirens, the searing heat as the rockets came down. Jamie said over 5,000 souls had perished in the mistake that cost Rodney Carter his position as leader of New Wilderness, and now all of Crow’s manic accusations began to make sense.

Her family. We’d killed her family.

The knowledge must have been evident on my bruised face, for Crow raised her blade above her head, her own cheeks crimson in fury.

*Bang.*

She flinched on instinct as the bullet struck the side plates of Crow’s armored vest, and tumbled backward off me.

*Bang, bang, bang.*

Out of the nearby trench line, a muddy figure advanced with a pistol raised, firing rapid shots at Crow until the magazine on her weapon ran dry. Despite my left eye swelling up, I would have recognized that bleach-blonde ponytail anywhere.

Jamie looked ready to fall over, swaying from the head injury she’d taken earlier, but her eyes never left the auxiliary leader, and they burned with a green fire that no concussion would dim.

Wheezing from a doubtless bruised rib, Crow rolled to her feet, Jamie’s bullets dancing in the dirt around her, and reached for her M4.

*No you don’t.*

New strength flooded my aching limbs, and I pushed myself up on all fours to lunge at her with animalistic speed. I tackled Crow to the ground as Jamie tossed her empty Beretta aside to run my way, and fought to pin the axillary’s arms.

Hard knuckles rammed the side of my temple, and I nearly blacked out, the reverberation in my head like an earthquake.

Crow shoved me away, but I still had a grip on her rifle, and Jamie closed the distance before our enemy could draw her sidearm.

*Whack.*

Jamie’s punch sent Crow reeling, and the handgun she’d been reaching for clattered into a water-filled shell hole. However, the axillary caught her footing and as Jamie came around for a second swing, she was met with a flash of steel.

A sickening *slice* drew a cry of pain from Jamie, and blood dipped from her right arm in a steady trickle.

Head swimming, I fumbled to bring the captured M4 in my hands to bear, arms shaking from adrenaline. All around us, combat still raged, the air sour with acrid smoke, the ground a morass of icy muck, chaos spreading as more survivors from our forces popped up in various places. Auxiliary troops still hunted them down, but the fights were becoming less one-sided now, and more fire targeted the helicopters. Explosions from hand grenades lit up the night like bolts of lightning, and frigid wind howled in displeasure at the noise. My fingers were going numb, and the cold almost hurt on my exposed ears, like they might turn to icicles and fall off.

Finding the safety switch at last, I leveled the rifle and tried to get a bead on Crow’s fast-moving silhouette.

*Gotta hurry, gotta hurry, they’re going to send others our way . . .*

Another slash forced Jamie to stagger back, and she yanked the ranger knife from its place on her war belt to square up.

Crow launched herself at Jamie in vicious rage, and my first three shots flew wide, while the two sparred like wild tigers. Blades and fists traded back and forth with abandon, blood flew, groans of pain hissed between clenched teeth. If the lessons Jamie had taught me at New Wilderness had been challenging, this fight appeared to me like a blur, the violence quick and muddled, technique worn down by sheer volume of wounds. Crow enjoyed the protection of her plate carrier, which turned many stabs from Jamie’s blade that would have ended the fight, while my friend struggled to keep her balance, the exhaustion and head wound taking their toll on Jamie’s skill.

For my part, I couldn’t get a clear shot, no matter how much I limped to circle the brutal slugfest. Every time Crow slipped away to evade another stab, she wove to keep Jamie between us, and her eyes searched the ground for a gun to snatch up. She was no fool, and I wavered on my feet with gasps of cold air rushing into my lungs, frustrated and terrified for how red Jamie’s clothes now were with blood.

*Please, God, tell me she didn’t nick an artery.*

“Get clear!” My breath went out in gusts of steam through the night, the tone barely audible over the incessant rifle fire, though I could taste the fear in each word as my heart pounded. “Jamie, get away! Get back!”

Jamie moved back to create some distance, but our foe wouldn’t be so easily dispatched.

Seeing the bleakness of her situation, Crow dove forward and managed to get her blade under Jamie’s guard arm.

Caught off balance, Jamie reacted too late, and the steel rammed home.

“*No!*” I watched in horror as she doubled over in pain, the hilt of Crow’s combat knife lodged just below her sternum.

Seizing the momentum, Crow grabbed the back of Jamie’s chest rig straps and shoved her my way, using Jamie as a shield to close the distance between us.

*Bang, bang, bang.*

Terrified, I reiterated backwards and fired the M4 into the mud near Crow’s feet, hoping to throw her off enough to get a clean shot, but it did no good. I fanned the trigger out of sheer panic, each round going nowhere, and before I knew it, the bolt locked back on an empty magazine.

With no better options left, I opened my mouth to ready a sonic scream, dreading the possibility that it might not only kill the auxiliary, but Jamie as well.

*Thud.*

One step ahead of me, Crow managed to land a glancing punch to my throat and drove Jamie into me with force.

Choking on my stifled voice, I fell backward with a gasp, and the two of us toppled to the ground.

Jamie curled into a defeated ball with a low groan, her eyes screwed shut. From the amount of crimson fluid that bubbled between the fingers clenched to her stomach, I knew her prospects weren’t good. If I didn’t get us out of here and find Eve’s people so they could tend to Jamie, she was as good as dead.

“Not as easy without mutants to do the dirty work for you?” Flexing her grip on the gore-covered knife in one hand, Crow stalked toward me, breathing hard, her hair askew from its tight military bun. “You’re all cowards. Always hiding behind someone else when you can’t win by yourself.”

Jamie’s eyes fluttered open, filled with tears of anguish, and she stared at me in a look both desperate and apologetic. She’d done her best, but even our Ranger training wasn’t enough. If she couldn’t win, how on earth would I?

*No. I won’t let this happen. I can’t watch her die.*

Something in me clicked, not anger, but a cool sense of purpose that gave fresh energy to my aching limbs. Even if I couldn’t win, I would do my best to make sure that Crow never got what she wanted. This evil psycho thrived on helpless people, and while battered, I wasn’t helpless. Jamie had rescued me when I needed her the most.

It was time to return that favor.

As Crow stepped closer, I lashed out with my good leg, and the boot tip impacted just behind her left knee cap.

Letting out a grunt of surprise, Crow wavered as her leg buckled, and I rolled to my feet.

My ankle burned, the boot squelching with blood from the untended hole in it, but I forced myself to stay upright.

*I need a weapon.*

A corpse lay nearby, one of our fallen men, and I spotted the wooden handle of a military surplus entrenching shovel hanging from his belt.

With mere seconds to spare, I ripped the little spade free of its belt pouch and whirled in time to see bloody metal flash toward my eye socket.

*Clang.*

Primal reflex kicked in, and I brought the E-tool up in time to block the strike, sparks flying as Crow’s combat knife bounced off the iron tool.

“Is that the best you can do?” She paced around me, moving with absolute surety despite the setback, and Crow tossed her brown hair over one shoulder with a sneer. “And to think Koranti wanted you alive. He’s going to be disappointed.”

In response, I hobbled a defensive arc around Jamie while Crow followed on, the two of us tense for the next strike. My esophagus was sore from her fist, but I could still breath, and focused instead on calming my wild pulse.

Sparring had always been the one Ranger skill I’d been worst at. Jamie did rather well for herself in the boxing ring back at New Wilderness, but I was never as good as she was. Whether armed with gloves in the ring, or using wooden training knives for a bit of combative wrestling practice, I came out the loser in our sessions every single time. That had been going slow at “fifty percent effort” as Jamie called it, all to give me the slightest hope of a chance. There would be no such handicaps here.

*I have the reach on her, my shovel is longer than her blade. She can’t get to Jamie without going through me first. Unless she picks up a gun from somewhere, we’re even . . . kinda.*

Sensing my trepidation, Crow’s mouth twisted into a snarl, and she propelled herself forward.

Limited by the slippery mud, my injuries, and needing to protect Jamie, I barely had time to avoid the jab and made a clumsy dodge instead of a proper block.

Without hesitation Crow lunged again, and slashed at my throat, her attack form perfect.

Pain flared, not from my neck but left upper arm, the second attempt to avoid her blows not quite fast enough. I felt the cutting edge of the blade cut a neat trail of fire through my skin, and swung at Crow with a desperate cry.

“You’re not even *from* here.” Crow ducked the shovel with ease, and her pearly incisors reflected the nearest flames, a wolfish baring of teeth that resembled a smile in name only. “I’ve seen your profile. You’re a tourist, a nobody, an ugly little ‘influencer’ who starts trouble for clicks. Did you film it when our homes burned, camera bug? You gonna put the melted kids on your home page? You going to tell the world why they were screaming?”

The words rang with a sadistic form of truth, but I ground my teeth and refused to give credence to her words. Instead, I sucked in a deep breath, forced my pulse to slow, and relaxed on the balls of both feet. Her arrogance had bought me time, and I exhaled over sore vocal cords so that *the focus* slid into place with its familiar sharpness.

One blink, and I saw the world in sharper colors, the shadows not so dark, the pain not so fierce in my body, the exhaustion fading as my heightened senses poured all their resources into my veins.

*Now I’ve got you.*

As if she guessed her mistake, Crow darted my way again, but this time I side-stepped her advance and brought the shovel down on her wrist. The shock of its impact reverberated up my arm, and my enhanced eardrums caught the low sound of bone fracturing.

She let out a yelp of pain, and Crow recoiled, though her fury never dimmed in the face of my advance. “I’m going to burn your family, you worthless insect! You, your parents, your friends, you’re all dead! I’ll hunt them down and *make you* *watch!*”

Locked in on her like a homing missile, I swung hard, missing time and time again, but drove Crow back as the girl held the bleeding arm close to her chest, knife clutched in the opposite hand. Everything came rushing back, like silent bells of judgment that fueled each step I took. The faces of Tex, Andrea, and Kaba. The screams of tortured inmates in the Organ prison. The cries of our wounded burning to death in the aid station at Black Oak. Crow had done this, turned on her own people, killed for a vengeance that could never bring her family back. She was a monster, I could see that now, no different than the mutants in the forest. There was no redeeming light for her, no cure for the madness that burned in her eyes like black fire.

This sickness was permanent.

My next strike glanced off her plate carrier, but the force of the blow knocked the auxiliary off balance.

Crow stumbled, one boot heel snagged on an upturned stone, and her eyes drifted to the ground on instinct.

With a sensation like lighting coursing through my blood, I raised the entrenching tool and brought it down hard.

*Crunch.*

Her cheekbone shattered beneath the assault, and Crow’s face split open to gush blood down her chin. The knife flew out of her hand as her head rolled in a dazed spin, but Crow’s fingers tangled in the straps of my chest rig to drag me down with her.

Cold mud splashed at our descent, the two of us landing hard with mutual grunts of pain. *The focus* chose that moment to recede in my head, and I lay in the soupy earth of Ohio with limbs that seemed to be made of jello. Both ears rang, my lungs hurt, and every joint strained, but I knew I couldn’t rest now.

Wriggling on my stomach, I dragged myself through the frigid sludge with both hands, until I could prop myself up to a seated position with the shovel.

At my side, Crow gurgled weak gasps of torment, her once hardened features now a mass of viscera. The shovel’s blade had carved a deep hole from just under her left eye to the girl’s chin, the white of the broken cheekbone exposed to the cold air. Blood, both bright and dark, poured across her face in rivers, however even in that moment Crow’s watery eyes glared back at me with a hatred that cut through the misery like a flame through butter. She made no effort to beg, to plead for mercy, or offer surrender.

We both knew that was no longer an option.

Resigned to this fate, I held her gaze, stared into that inhuman abyss, and spat words between split, bloodied lips. “It’s over.”

“Is it?” Another callous laugh racked her, mixed with a fluid-ridden cough as a thick clot of blood erupted the downing throat. Underneath all the gore, the torn muscles of Crow’s face pulled the tattered flesh into one last, cruel smile. “You still think you can win? Koranti is going to eat . . . you . . . alive.”

Gripping the shovel with both hands over my head, I swung.

*Whack.*

Blood spewed from a ruptured jugular vein and Crow’s hands clawed at my chest rig by instinct, but the digging tool came down again.

*Whack.*

Her movements turned to spasmodic jerks, and the steel of my crude weapon carved deeper into the cauldron of steam-laden slop that had once been a human head. I didn’t realize at first that I screamed with each blow, but tasted copper from the blood, smelled the backfilled lungs, felt slivers of bone grind like sand between my teeth. My body seemed to go on autopilot, every tendon used to the max, every gasp milked of its oxygen like never before. Ringing took over my ears, tunnel visions clouded my eyes, and the pulse in my blood soared so that I thought my veins would burst.

*Crunch.*

In a final dull splinter of calcium succumbing to brute force, Crow’s skull split open, her arms limp at her sides in the mud.

A rush of dizziness dragged me to the ground, and I slumped into the hellish blend of mud and chopped brains. Everything hurt, my lungs seemed unable to get enough air, and a fierce shiver took over so that I couldn’t keep hold of the shovel anymore. Vomit rose in my throat, loose hair stuck to my face in icy sheets, and the muscles in my limbs seized up with cramps. When did I last drink water? I couldn’t seem to recall the taste of it. How did it feel to be warm, to be dry? I tried to remember the sensation of being in bed, with soft cotton sheets and a thick comforter, but the memories wouldn’t surface. I wanted so badly to pass out, to sleep, to escape this for just one moment that didn’t smell like death.

Sharp coughs to my left brought me out of my delirium, and I forced my head to move so that I could let the puke exit my swollen throat.

*Jamie.*

Onto four weak limbs I hoisted myself and crawled to her in the blind grip of the night. She had tried to crawl for the trenches, likely in search of a weapon, and I cradled her against me as we huddled together in the shadows. Jamie shook even harder than I did, though I feared it wasn’t from the winter breeze, and her skin had taken on a grayish-white pallor. Multiple stab wounds crisscrossed her abdomen, and her forearms were ragged with knife cuts.

“Hey.” She tried to make a weak smile, but another spasm of pain turned it into a grimace as Jamie clutched her stomach. “You’re still kicking.”

“S-Stay still, okay?” The cold made my teeth chatter like an old-school typewriter as I fumbled to strip Jamie’s gear and outer clothing off, exposing a mess of torn flesh underneath. “Breathe slow, I’ll p-patch you up. We have to get out of here.”

She clenched her teeth while I packed the worst stab wounds with combat gauze and shook her head. “I . . . I don’t think this is fixable.”

“Just shut up.” I swallowed, trying to focus on her while my leg throbbed and my arm dripped streams of red. I needed to bandage myself at some point, but Jamie’s wounds were soaking up every bit of cotton I had in my medical pouch. All the clotting powders I had were already used, and I couldn’t put a tourniquet on her stomach. It was like trying to hold back a river with my bare hands, time working against me alongside the cruel weather.

A clammy hand worked its way into mine, and Jamie squeezed hard. “Hannah . . .”

Deep inside, a strain like a damn trying to burst pushed at the bounds of my chest, and I shook my head to unwind yet another bandage. “We’ll head for the cliffs. I can get us to Ark River, if anyone’s still there. Worst case scenario, we find another farmhouse . . .”

“Hannah . . .” Leaning against me, Jamie sounded weak and far away, as though she were drifting off to sleep.

*Stay awake, we can still make it.*

I gave her a gentle but firm shake, determined not to let my welling anxiety get the better of me. “ . . . and we’ll set up a signal fire. Eve will send someone for us, the riders will come, you’ll see.”

“*Hannah.*” A soft drop in her voice made me stop, and I turned to see Jamie smile, sad and pained, as gray began to overtake the last of the white in her cheeks. “I can’t feel my legs.”

We stared at each other, the awful truth hanging in the air between us, and I felt suddenly as frightened as the first day I’d arrived in this strange, forgotten part of the world. It seemed as though I stood on the edge of a horrendous cliff, and was about to be pushed over, without knowing where the fall would take me. New Wilderness was gone, Chris was gone, and now . . . now . . .

*No. This isn’t happening. I won’t let it.*

I blinked hard, eyes blurring, and made a stubborn sniffle. “I can carry you.”

“Bullshit.” Jamie coughed hard, enough that red flecks spattered over her lips, the knife wound under her sternum bleeding through the gauze. “I’d just slow you down. Go find my rifle, I think it’s somewhere over there. If you can find a body with another like it, you’ve got ammo.”

My faux bravado crumpled, and I screwed my eyes shut as the first tears slid down my filthy cheeks. “Jamie, come on, I—”

“Chris fought so you could live.” She snapped, not angry but mournful, and I could hear the brokenness in her tone, as if Jamie’s heart would never mend from that sentence. “If you get killed, then he died for nothing. Is that what you want?”

*I want to wake up. I want this to be a dream, a horrible bad dream. Please, Adonai, wake me up.*

I gulped, tasting salt, and wiped at my runny nose with a hand that stank of blood. “I . . . I don’t want to lose you.”

Her expression softened, and Jamie reached over to the pile of her gear to open the ragged knapsack. One hand slid into the interior compartment and out came the framed picture of her and Bill from days long gone. My little Polaroid of us still clung faithfully to the side of the frame with its tape, and it hurt me in ways I didn’t know were possible to see it again. How long had it been since my birthday party? How long since that morning at Ark River where Jamie walked into a life of exile and loneliness? How long since she returned just in time for my wedding? If it had been days, it had been an eternity, a span of thousands of years of emotion that I realized were coming to an end. It was the collapse of an era, the desolation of a time that I could never return to. Barron County was dying, leaving this world for the next, and in the same way, the old life I knew would die with it.

Including those I loved most.

*A sacrifice. One I cannot replace. One to grant me passage to the next world.*

She held the picture with trembling fingers, Jamie’s green eyes staring at the figures with a grief beyond words. Of all her possessions, this I knew was her dearest, and I choked on a sob of despair as she pushed it into my hands.

“Wherever you go, I go.” Jamie tucked my fingers over the picture, her skin like ice as the heat ebbed away.

“That’s . . . that’s not fair.” Stammering over my own remorse, I fought to breathe as the knowledge of our situation clamped down on my lungs. “We’re supposed to be a team, we’re supposed to stick together. I can’t do this without you.”

Jamie squeezed my hand, huddled against me for warmth, and her irises held a weak twinkle that was a shadow of its usual mirth. “Of course you can. You’re Hannah the Mutant Killer, remember? That’s lucky in and of itself.”

“Everything I am . . .” Unable to stand it anymore, I wrapped my arms around her to hold Jamie close, and she embraced me as best she could, our faces streaked with crystalline pain. “. . . I am because of *you*.”

Together we braced against the impending fate that hung over us like the sword of Damocles, my tears soaking her shirt, Jamie’s blood seeping through my uniform. As the roar of battle continued over the ridge, I clung to the last friend I had, the two of us shivering in the mud, and our breaths wove steamy trails in the winter air. In my head, a thousand emotions swirled; I wanted to scream, to shout, to swear and cry all at once. I pleaded with God, begged him, prayed like I never had in my life. However, I couldn’t help but recall the words spoken to me in the in-between, words that now cut through my soul with icy clarity.

*You will suffer before the end.*

Reclined in my arms, her emerald eyes drifted upward, and Jamie made a small nod at the sky above us. “Check it out.”

My own vision blurry with tears, I glanced up, the clouds having moved off, the blanket of deep black riddled with glowing silver stars. It was just as beautiful as the first night I’d stepped out of the Fur and Fang Veterinary clinic, and the bright orbs seemed to shine out the clearer as we watched.

“What’d I tell you?” Jamie sighed, a happy lilt to her hushed voice. “Like the world’s biggest light show.”

A weight sagged against my arm, and I looked down to see her face still.

“Jamie?” I shook her, but it was as if I held a bundle of firewood, the arms limp, the body unmoving. “Jamie, no. No, no, no, wake up, come on.”

However, the irises turned to motionless rings of color around the blank corneas, the lips flickered to a stop as the breath rolled out in a faded gust of steam, and Jamie stared up, up, up, far into the starry expanse. I put my head to her chest, and my heart sank at hearing nothing, no breath in the lungs, no heartbeat under the ribs. It hit me then what she had done. In her true fashion, Jamie had distracted me one last time, a final bid to spare me the pain of something she’d endured with Bill long before I ever came to Barron County. From the first night she helped pull me from a pile of moldy shoes until now, Jamie had watched over me like the older sister I never had. Even as the moment came for her to go, she hadn’t thought of herself, but of me. She had spared me the pain, turned my eyes to something beautiful, and quietly slipped away. I never deserved her.

And now, I would never get to thank her.

“Y-You have wake up. I don’t want you to go, don’t leave me.” Crushing her limp form against my chest, I stroked her bleach-blonde hair and sobbed into Jamie’s ponytail. “Jamie, *please*.”

The last words came as a wail, and with them my heart burst into a million pieces. I didn’t care who might see, who might hear, or even if a bullet found me. I screamed, the brutal waves of sorrow drowning me over and over from the inside out. Every sob, every cry, every tear was a blade to my soul that I couldn’t block. I tried to pray, but couldn’t find the words, and just sat there, hurting in a way that I thought would kill me.

AT some point, I realized the tears had dried, my energy spent, the cold creeping in to my bones like poison. It took a supreme effort to unlock my arms from around Jamie’s shoulders, but I gently lay her back in the mud and covered her with my jacket. Both dirty hands found the green canvas satchel, and I pulled out the launch panel.

Familiar tendrils of shadow crept in, old harsh memories that showed me the visions of Vecitorak and the Oak Walker, ones that I now saw matched the battlefield around me. They had been right; I could see that now. Fire, destruction, we had brought this on ourselves. Thousands were dead because of choices, ones I’d helped to shape, but I had one left. I could carry out my orders, avenge my friends, and stop Koranti from claiming his victory.

It was time to end this.

The little steel keys slid into their respective places with light metallic *clicks*, and I pushed the silvery toggle switches according to the orders written down on the papers included with the unit.

*‘Launch code accepted; multiple reentry warhead systems armed: input target sequence command.’*

My hands shook, the fingers sticky with drying blood as I selected the numbers Sean had designated to drop the missiles squarely on Barron County.

*‘Target sequence authorized: No major targets selected, defaulting to Firing Patter Two.’*

I thought of Collingswood, of the things I’d seen there, the memories of the past that clung to the place like the poisoned fumes from the bombs. Would all of Barron County be like that? Would we feel the heat before it killed us? How many warheads would it take to wipe our tiny patch of dirt from the map?

*‘Firing Pattern Two online; fire when ready.’*

I looked down at the last switch, the one enclosed with a small red plastic hood to prevent accidental use. This was it. My last order, my only remaining mission, the final stroke of my life’s pen. I would rain fire down on Barron County and take everything away from Koranti like he had done to me. There would be no victory for ELSAR, no great profit from the mutants they would experiment on, no wonder drugs they could sell for exorbitant prices all over the world. They would burn with us, and this horrible nightmare would end.

Jamie’s hair ruffled in the winter wind, her face still and peaceful, enough to bring another round of weeping out of me. No one would ever know she existed. Her memory would be scorched from the earth just like the memorial at New Wilderness, erased once and for all. Chris would be extinguished too, save for the one thing I had left to remember him by. The two people who had loved me beyond my understanding would be no more, and the world wouldn’t even know to honor them. I had my orders, and knew they had to be carried out, but why then did it feel so wrong?

Burying my face in both hands, I wept, and let *the focus* carry my anguished thoughts across the invisible winds of time.

*Adonai, why? Why did you do this? I don’t understand what you want . . . I can’t even hear you anymore.*

A brisk wind picked up, and something cool and wet landed on the side of my face.

Confused, I peeled the thing off my skin and discovered a slender gold-colored leaf. The trees had been decimated for miles around, the foliage turned to ashes. There shouldn’t have been a leaf like this anywhere near here, and yet, here it was.

It shone in my hand, the moisture reflecting the moonlight overhead so that it almost seemed to glow, and as I held it on my palm, a strange sense of calm flowed through me like running water.

*Look closer, filia mea.*

To my left, I caught the slight crackle of a radio and turned my head to frown at Crow’s bloodied corpse. Her radio squawked again, and an idea began to take shape in my brain.

Like a tapestry it wove together, action after action, until the way forward was as clear as if I had walked it many times before. I still wept, but these tears felt different, ones of relief, of astonishment, of a grateful hope that I thought impossible.

Looking up at the stars, I noted the silver of their aura and thought how much they looked like His eyes. “Okay.”

On wobbly legs I crossed over to the radio and picked it up, keeping my head on a swivel to watch for enemies who might wander into range.

*“What’s your status?”* A familiar man’s voice barked through the speakers the instant I unplugged the headset cable, impatient and irate. *“How many HVT’s do you have in custody? McGregor, answer me, dammit.”*

My lip curled, and I knelt to paw through the medical kit on Crow’s vest, the talk button on the handset held down. “She’s dead.”

Silence reigned for a few moments before Koranti’s voice came through, somewhat smoothed over, though I could sense his shock behind the faux aloofness. *“Hannah. What a pleasant surprise. I’ve been looking for you.”*

Gripping the radio so tight that my knuckles popped, I scowled at the nearby flashes of gunfire, knowing Koranti was far from all this, seated in some nice cozy office while his men fought and died for him in the snow. “I’m ready to negotiate. Meet me tomorrow at dawn, five miles southwest of the old wildlife reserve, near the red smoke. I want you there in person.”

A laugh crackled from the other end, and his voice leered at me with incredulity. *“And why would I do that?”*

The lightest ghost of a smile, odd but reassuring, stretched across my chapped lips. “I have something you’ve been hunting, something that could make life very difficult for you if you refuse. You know what I’m talking about. Meet with me, and you won’t have to worry about the sky falling.”

Silence again.

*“How do I know this isn’t a crude ploy to kill me?”* He sounded less pompous now, the shrewd part of Koranti showing in his caution, the shark of a businessman who knew how to maneuver.

“We’ll both be in the open.” I wound a bandage from Crow’s kit around my ankle, developing the plan that still roiled within my mind as I went. “If anyone shoots at you, you’ll have a good chance to return the favor. Do we have a deal, or not?”

He seemed to contemplate for a few seconds and then responded. *“Fine. I’ll look for your signal. Is there anything else you want?”*

I stopped, my heart twinging at the words, and threw a look toward Jamie. I’d have to take her gear, her rifle, and my coat if I wanted to survive. She didn’t need them anymore and would have told me to do so if she were still alive, but I hated how traitorous it felt. There was no time to bury her, and no way to drag her corpse with me. I would be forced to abandon her among the dead, to leave her to the cold, like a discarded sandwich wrapper.

*Adonai, guide her to your light.*

Clicking the talk button, I shook my head at Koranti’s inquiry and bent low to hunt for Jamie’s Kalashnikov. “I’ll see you at dawn.”
