I thought I’d hit the jackpot when I landed the job. A remote village, a cozy cottage, and a simple task: watch the sheep, follow a few rules. The old man who hired me seemed nervous when he handed me the list, his eyes not quite meeting mine. But I figured it was just the usual caution with newcomers. How hard could it be to herd sheep?


But when I first arrived, the village felt wrong, though I couldn’t put my finger on why. The roads were empty, the houses weathered and silent, like they were waiting for something. It was the quiet that unnerved me the most no kids running around, no chatter between neighbors, just an unnatural stillness. The air smelled faintly of wet earth, even though it hadn't rained in days.

I tried to shrug it off. Maybe it was just the isolation; after all, not many people lived in this part of the country. But the villagers... they watched me. Not in a welcoming way, but with eyes that seemed to pierce right through me. They gave me directions without much emotion, as though they already knew what I was there for and maybe even knew what would happen next.

It was only when the old man, trembling slightly, handed me the list of rules that I started to feel a knot form in my stomach. He barely spoke as he gave it to me, his hands shaking as he pressed it into mine. His eyes never met mine. Only after I took the paper did he look up, just long enough to say one thing: 'Follow them, or you won't last.'

At that point, I assumed it was just superstition. But after a few hours, I wasn’t so sure.


This were the rules:

Rules for herding the village sheep


Rule 1: Never let the herd out of your sight; if they run off, you will be punished.

Rule 2: Always make sure there aren't any extra sheep in your herd. We don't want the neighboring village to get mad for stealing their sheep.

Rule 3: Don't let them near the river; every year, we lose a few there.

Rule 4: Be back at the village by nighttime; you don't wan't  to see what happens in the dark.

Rule 5:If the sheep, at any point, start walking in a circle around a tree, RUN and don't look back.

Rule 6: There is a chance that wolves may attack you or your sheep. You have to protect the sheep at all costs. Because once they start, they won't stop at just the sheep.

Rule 7: There are only white sheep in the village if at any moment you notice a sheep with black wool, you are in danger. If you don't get it away from the herd before night comes, you won't reach the village.....Î̧̧̛̘̪̤̝͚̖̦͍̜̋̅̾̑̓̂ͧ̔̕͢͟͠͝ͅt_̧̠̤͙̱̖̔̊̄ͤ̌̉̅̽͟͜͠s̢̯̹̮̼̤ͤ͆̔̂̃̂̿̈͋ͯ_̶̢̢̗̮̫̜̙͍͈̮̰̱̟̦͆̆͂̄͌̿͂͒ͫͨ̀ͥ̃͜͟ t̸̡̧̛͎̙͙͕̜̱̫͕̪̳̫̺͇̹͓͍̮͔̙ͤ̀̽́ͬͫͮ̀͊̃͐́͐͑̄́̾͘͟h̴̢̘̣̥̪̘̙̘̬̖̥͇̻͙̳̬̀́́̈́̐̉ͩ̒̔͆̌̏̎̓̃ͨͤ͆͋͢͢͟͟e͎̰̞̟̫ͨͮ̓͗͌͐̽ D̷̵̢̢̛̗̳͍̻̻̦̭͇̙̻̍͑͗ͣ́̄̓͌͆͊̌̇ͩ͢ȩ̷̴̞̻̦̯̰͇̯̽̐ͫ̂̓̀̐̔͑ͤ͛̇͘͢͠ͅv̶̵̡̛̯̪͎̜̹̬̜̫͕͔͚̱͖͚ͧ͑ͧ͋̒̅͑͘͞ͅi̴̶̷̸̵̴̟̜͉̪̜̻̺͎̝͍̹̲̯͇̣͍ͧͬͪ͛̒ͭ̃̍̌́͂ͥ͐̊̐̊̊͂̕̚l


Rule 8:If you ever see a group of children following you on the road, field, or the woods. Don't look at them, don't talk to them if they realize you can see them, you will become one of them.

Rule 9:If you hear a beautiful song while you are heading on the path through the woods and see a girl in a white dress, she will follow you around trying to get you to come to her. To get you to stray off the path. Just keep walking and don't set foot off the path. She is a witch, and if this happens, she has an interest in you and not the kind you want.

Rule 10: if, for whatever reason, you don't reach the village by nighttime, stay calm because panicking won't help. And keep your attention on the sheep.

1)if the sheep refuse to move, no matter how many times you yell or hit them. Get in the middle of the herd immediately. Once you do lay on the ground and don't move until morning. A few sheep will be missing when you wake up, but hurry to the village. You don't want them to come back for you, too.

2)if the sheep start heading towards a lone house in the field, if the lights are on don't go inside and hide. And DON'T let them see you. If they are off, you can stay the night, but by morning, head straight to the village priest; he will know what to do.

3)if they head to the old graveyard, if you see people dancing around the graves, pray that they don't see you. Once they do, you won't be able to hide from them. If it's empty, you can sleep there if you manage to fall asleep.


As I read through the rules, a cold shiver ran down my spine. They were strange almost like something out of an old folk tale. But there was no mistaking the urgency in the old man’s voice, his hands trembling as he left me to my work.

I tried to push the unease to the back of my mind. It was just superstition, right? But as I set out to herd the sheep the following morning, the village's odd stillness pressed on me like a weight I couldn’t shake. The sheep were... different, too. They moved in a strangely orderly way, as if guided by some unseen force.

It wasn’t long before I began to notice the strange behavior of the villagers. They would peek out of their windows and watch me no smiles, no waves, just cold, emotionless stares. It was like I wasn’t welcome, like I was being judged by eyes that knew more than I did.


By the time evening rolled around, the sense of dread had only deepened. The sun had begun its descent, casting long shadows over the village. The sheep were starting to grow restless, their movements more erratic, their bleating echoing through the silence.

I made my way back toward the cottage, the path winding through the fields. Every step felt heavier, as though the land itself was weighing me down. The stillness around me was suffocating. There were no sounds of life, no birds calling, no wind rustling the trees. It felt like the village had gone to sleep before the night had even truly begun.

The lights of my cottage flickered in the distance, a small beacon in the gathering dark. I quickened my pace, eager to get inside and away from the prying eyes of the villagers. But as I passed the row of houses, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being watched. From behind curtained windows, faces lingered in the dim light, their eyes tracking my every move.

I reached the cottage and hurried inside, locking the door behind me. The cold air had followed me inside, wrapping around me like a blanket. I set the list of rules down on the table, my hands still trembling. I couldn’t stop thinking about them, about how strange and foreboding they felt.

Sitting by the small fire in the corner of the room, I tried to distract myself with a book I found on the shelf. The crackling of the fire was the only sound in the cottage, a small comfort against the silence that pressed in from all sides. But every now and then, I would glance up at the window, as if expecting to see someone or something watching me.

I didn’t know what was worse: the villagers’ cold gaze or the growing sense of unease that seemed to settle over everything in the village. As the night wore on, the wind outside picked up, howling through the cracks in the walls. The fire flickered, casting long, flickering shadows across the room.

Eventually, exhaustion set in, and I tried to shake off the anxiety that had been creeping up on me all day. I needed rest, a good night’s sleep to clear my mind.

But just as I was about to blow out the candle, I heard a sound soft at first, almost imperceptible. A faint scratching, like something or someone was outside the door. I held my breath, waiting, the hairs on the back of my neck standing on end. The sound stopped for a moment, then resumed, growing louder. It was coming from the window.

I stood frozen, my heart pounding in my chest. What the hell was it?

Then, just as suddenly as it had started, the noise stopped. I didn’t dare move, didn't dare to look outside. I felt the eyes of the village, unseen but undeniably present, bearing down on me.

I couldn’t shake the thought that I wasn’t alone. Not here, not in this cottage, and not in this village.


The night seemed to stretch on forever, each minute a heavy, oppressive weight. I had finally managed to fall into a restless sleep by the fire, but my mind was still racing. The wind howled outside, rattling the old windows of the cottage. Every now and then, I thought I heard faint footsteps on the gravel outside, but when I looked, no one was there.

I shook my head, telling myself it was just the wind playing tricks. But the feeling wouldn’t leave this constant, gnawing sensation that I wasn’t alone.

Suddenly, a loud crash echoed from the other side of the cottage. My heart leapt in my chest as I jerked awake. It was followed by the sound of something scraping across the ground, like claws on stone. The firelight danced erratically in the corner, casting shadows that seemed to twist unnaturally.

I got up, my legs shaky. I grabbed the lantern from the table, my fingers brushing against the cold metal as I moved cautiously to the door. The scratching noise continued, louder now, closer. It was as though something or someone was trying to get inside. My breath hitched as I stood there, frozen.

I reached for the handle slowly, my palms sweating. The air in the room seemed to grow heavier, colder, until it felt like the walls themselves were closing in. I exhaled sharply, my breath coming in short bursts, and pulled the door open just a crack.

Outside, the night was unnaturally still. The dark sky stretched endlessly above, and the pale glow of the moon seemed to cast strange, elongated shadows on the ground. But as my eyes adjusted, I saw something moving in the distance near the edge of the field.

A figure.

I couldn't make it out at first. It was too far, too shrouded in darkness. But as I squinted, I saw it clearly: a tall, hunched figure, its limbs jerking in unnatural motions. I felt a cold rush of dread fill my chest. My heart thudded painfully against my ribs.

I knew I shouldn’t look, I knew I should’ve closed the door and never opened it again. But my feet were frozen, unable to move.

Then, the figure turned, and in that moment, I could see it clearly the twisted, hollow face of a villager, their eyes wide and unblinking, staring directly at me. My breath caught in my throat. The figure took a step forward, its movements stiff and disjointed, like something trying desperately to break free of some unseen force.

I slammed the door shut, heart hammering in my chest. I backed away, clutching the lantern, my pulse racing.

I collapsed to the floor, gasping for air. The oppressive silence outside had returned, but the tension in the cottage was unbearable. There was no wind, no noise, no sound of life anywhere. Just an overwhelming stillness that seemed to have swallowed the world whole.

Whatever was out there, whatever was watching me, was just waiting. I didn’t know for what. And I wasn’t sure I wanted to find out.


I woke up to the sound of sheep bleating softly outside, the early morning sun casting long shadows over the fields. I rubbed my eyes, trying to shake off the remnants of last night’s unease. The air was thick with mist, hanging low over the grass, and the stillness of the village seemed to cling to everything like a second skin.

I stood and stretched, feeling the cold bite of the morning air, and grabbed the list of rules from the table. I hadn't looked at them since the night before too frightened by their strange words to dare. But now, as I glanced down at them, the weight of the old man’s warning seemed to press down on me again.

“Follow them, or you won’t last.”

I tucked the list into my jacket and stepped outside, the sheep scattered across the meadow in the early light. They were already moving in a strange, almost hypnotic rhythm, as though guided by some unseen force.

It wasn’t long before I found myself walking along the path by the river a wide, slow moving stream that wound through the fields. The water was murky, moving sluggishly over moss-covered rocks, and a thin fog rose from the surface, thickening the air with a damp chill.

I was barely halfway down the path when I remembered the first rule: "Don’t let them near the river; every year, we lose a few there."

I hesitated, looking out at the dark water, my heart pounding. Something about the river felt wrong. It wasn’t just the way the fog clung to it or the unnerving stillness of the water it was the fact that the river seemed to be waiting, as though it had a hunger to it. A dark, creeping feeling that set the hairs on the back of my neck on edge.

I glanced back at the sheep, and my breath caught in my throat. They were moving toward the river.

A few sheep, already skittish and restless, had started to stray closer to the water’s edge, their hooves crunching softly on the gravel. My stomach churned. I knew I had to move fast.

“Come on!” I shouted, my voice louder than I intended, hoping to startle them back. I took a step forward, but the sheep paid me no mind, their heads lowering to the ground, as if they hadn’t even heard me.

I quickened my pace, pushing through the thick mist, but the sheep seemed to grow more agitated, their movements erratic. They were heading straight for the river, their bleating growing more frantic.

I tried again to call out, but the sound of my voice seemed distant, as if the air itself was swallowing it up.

Don’t let them near the river…

My heart raced as I broke into a run, but the sheep didn’t slow. They moved with a purpose, drawn by some unseen pull. The closer they got to the water, the more uneasy I felt, like there was something beneath the surface, something waiting for them.

I could hear the water rushing more loudly now, its murmur like a whisper in my ears. A sharp breath of panic rose in my chest. I had to stop them. They couldn’t reach the river.

I darted forward, grabbing the nearest sheep by the horns, pulling it back with all my strength. It resisted, bleating angrily, its legs digging into the soft earth. I tugged harder, my hands slipping with the sweat that had gathered in the palms of my gloves.

Suddenly, I heard a sound a soft, wet slap against the water, followed by the unmistakable splash of something large breaking the surface. My stomach lurched, and I glanced toward the river.

Something was moving beneath the water.

I didn’t look long enough to see what it was. My pulse was pounding in my ears as I pulled harder, dragging the sheep away from the edge, heart hammering as the water seemed to grow louder, angrier, like a living thing that didn’t want to be denied.

The sheep finally broke free from the pull, but they were panicked now, bleating wildly, pushing against me. I wasn’t sure if it was the river’s unnatural force or just their own fear, but the herd seemed to move in a frenzy. They were far too close to the water’s edge for my liking.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, I managed to steer them back onto safer ground, away from the river. The tension in the air was thick, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that I had narrowly escaped something... far worse than I had imagined.

The river seemed to calm, as though it had been watching me the whole time, waiting for me to slip up. I glanced over my shoulder once more, a shiver running down my spine. The water, now eerily still, looked almost satisfied.

I had  managed to save the sheep. But the moment the river had calmed, I had a sinking feeling that it wasn’t just the animals it was after.

The sheep calmed as we left the river behind, their bleating settling into an almost eerie silence. I kept a firm grip on my staff, scanning the mist-covered field for anything out of place. My nerves were still on edge from the river, my heart beating a little too fast in my chest.

The fields stretched out ahead, dotted with ancient, gnarled trees. Their twisted branches clawed at the pale sky, bare despite the season. Something about those trees had unsettled me since I arrived in the village they seemed too old, too out of place in the otherwise empty landscape.

I led the sheep along the path, keeping my eyes on them. They moved in an orderly line, their movements almost mechanical, as though they were being led by something other than me. The strange behavior gnawed at my thoughts, but I tried to shake it off. I couldn’t afford to lose focus.

Then, I noticed it.

One of the sheep broke away from the group.

It happened so suddenly that I didn’t even realize it at first. The rest of the flock continued forward, but this one its movements jerky and unsteady veered off toward one of the ancient trees in the distance.

“Hey!” I shouted, rushing after it. “Get back here!”

The sheep didn’t stop. Its pace quickened as it neared the tree, and my gut twisted with unease. Something wasn’t right.

By the time I caught up, the rest of the flock had come to a halt, their heads turned toward the stray sheep. I followed their gaze, and my breath caught in my throat.

The sheep was circling the tree.

Not wandering, not grazin circling. A tight, deliberate loop, its hooves kicking up small puffs of dirt as it moved. The rest of the flock began to bleat, low and anxious, shuffling uneasily where they stood.

I froze.

Rule 5.

My heart thudded in my chest as the words ran through my mind: “If the sheep, at any point, start walking in a circle around a tree, RUN and don't look back.”

A cold dread washed over me, rooting me to the spot. The sheep’s circling was too perfect, too deliberate, as though something unseen was guiding it. My instincts screamed at me to leave, to turn and run, but my feet wouldn’t move.

Then, the tree began to groan.

It was a deep, low sound, like the creak of old wood under immense pressure. The branches trembled, though there was no wind, and I swore I saw something moving in the gnarled bark shapes, shadows, faces. My blood ran cold.

The sheep’s circling grew faster, its hooves striking the ground in an almost rhythmic pattern. The air felt heavier, pressing down on me, and the groaning of the tree grew louder, more anguished.

I took a step back, my breathing shallow. The rest of the flock started to scatter, their panic infectious, but I couldn’t tear my eyes away from the circling sheep. It was as though the tree itself had come alive, its branches reaching down, twisting toward the sheep like claws.

A shadow moved at the base of the tree. Something dark, something wrong.

The sheep let out a strangled bleat and stopped. It stood still for a moment, and then without warning it collapsed.

I turned and ran.

I didn’t look back, didn’t dare to. The sound of my own footsteps pounded in my ears, mingling with the panicked bleating of the remaining sheep as they scattered. The air felt thick, suffocating, and the ground seemed to pull at my feet with every step.

I didn’t stop until I reached the flock, panting and trembling. They had gathered in a cluster, wide-eyed and skittish, but alive. I glanced over my shoulder, my stomach churning.

The tree stood motionless in the distance, its branches once again still. The sheep that had circled it was gone.

The dread in my chest deepened. I didn’t need to go back to know that I had done the right thing. Whatever had just happened whatever had taken that sheep wasn’t something I could fight or understand. All I knew was that I had survived, but only barely.

The day dragged on, the sun crawling lazily across the sky. The sheep grazed quietly, their soft bleating the only sound breaking the oppressive silence. I tried to focus on the mundane task of keeping the flock together, but my mind kept drifting back to the strange events of the morning.

The circling tree. The shadow. The sheep that disappeared.

I shook my head, trying to shake off the lingering fear. The list of rules weighed heavy in my pocket, a grim reminder of the old man’s warning. I pulled it out again, scanning the lines. My eyes lingered on Rule 7.

“There are only white sheep in the village. If at any moment you notice a sheep with black wool, you are in danger.”

I glanced up at the flock. White wool glistened in the sunlight, soft and almost luminous. I took a deep breath, reassured by the familiar sight.

But the relief didn’t last.

As the sheep shifted, one of them caught my eye. At first, I thought it was just a trick of the light, a shadow cast by a passing cloud. But as I stepped closer, my stomach dropped.

Its wool was black.

Not gray, not dirty, but a deep, unnatural black that seemed to absorb the light around it. The sheep stood motionless, apart from the others, its head lowered. Something about it felt... wrong. The other sheep seemed to avoid it, keeping their distance as though they, too, sensed the danger.

I froze, the rule running through my mind like a siren: If at any moment you notice a sheep with black wool, you are in danger.

The sun was already sinking lower in the sky, casting long shadows over the field. I didn’t have much time before nightfall. I gripped my staff tightly, my heart pounding.

“Alright,” I muttered to myself, trying to steady my nerves. “Get it away from the flock. Just get it away.”

I approached the black sheep cautiously, my footsteps slow and deliberate. It didn’t move, didn’t acknowledge me at all. Its head remained bowed, as though grazing, but there was no movement no chewing, no sound. Just stillness.

“Come on,” I said, my voice trembling. “Move.”

I prodded it lightly with my staff. The moment the wood touched its wool, a cold shock shot through me, like icy water running up my arm. I stumbled back, gasping. The sheep lifted its head.

Its eyes weren’t normal.

They weren’t the soft, glassy eyes of a sheep. They were black pitch black, with no whites or pupils. Just empty voids that seemed to look right through me.

I stumbled backward, my legs shaking. The sheep stepped forward, its hooves making no sound against the ground. The other sheep bleated nervously, scattering farther away from it.

Get it away from the herd, I thought, the rule echoing in my mind. But how? How could I even touch it again without that chilling sensation coursing through me?

The black sheep took another step toward me, its gaze unrelenting. I felt paralyzed, rooted to the spot. The sun dipped lower, the shadows growing longer. Panic surged in my chest. I had to act now.

I forced myself to move, raising my staff again. This time, I swung it, not to prod but to scare. The staff struck the ground near the sheep with a loud crack, and for a moment, it hesitated.

“Go!” I shouted, my voice hoarse. “Get away!”

It didn’t run, but it turned, its movements slow and deliberate. I followed, keeping my distance, herding it away from the flock. Every step felt like a battle against the oppressive weight pressing down on me, the fear clawing at my mind.

Finally, I managed to drive it toward the edge of the field, near a dense line of trees. The sun was nearly gone now, the sky painted in hues of orange and purple. The shadows of the forest loomed like a wall, dark and foreboding.

The black sheep stopped at the tree line. For a moment, it just stood there, its head turned toward me, those empty eyes locked on mine. Then, without a sound, it stepped into the shadows and disappeared.

I waited, my breath coming in ragged gasps, my staff trembling in my hands. The forest remained silent, the sheep gone.

The rest of the flock had gathered in the distance, their bleating faint and uncertain. I turned and began walking back toward them, my legs weak, my thoughts racing.

I’d followed the rule. The black sheep was gone. But as I glanced back toward the forest, I couldn’t shake the feeling that it wasn’t over.

Not yet.


I stumbled into the cottage, slamming the door behind me and locking it with trembling hands. My legs felt like jelly after the river ordeal, and my mind raced with questions I didn’t want to answer. The sheep were secured in their pen outside, but their restless bleating echoed faintly through the night, as if they knew something I didn’t.

The fire crackled weakly in the corner, casting long, jittery shadows on the walls. I sat down at the table and pulled out the list of rules, my hands shaking as I smoothed the paper flat. My eyes darted over the words again and again, looking for reassurance I knew I wouldn’t find. This is madness, I thought. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that breaking even one rule would mean more than just losing a job.

As the night wore on, the wind picked up, howling around the cottage like a restless spirit. Then I heard it: a soft, deliberate knocking. It was faint at first, barely more than a tap, coming from the back of the house. My breath caught in my throat. Just the wind, I told myself. But it wasn’t. The sound was too rhythmic, too intentional.

I sat frozen, every nerve in my body screaming for me to move, to hide, to do something. The knocking stopped. I barely had time to exhale before it started again, this time at the window, slow and deliberate. My heart thundered in my chest. I didn’t look. I didn’t dare.

Instead, I clutched the list of rules like a lifeline and waited. Minutes passed long, agonizing minutes. Then, just as suddenly as it had started, the knocking stopped. The silence that followed was worse than the sound, heavy and oppressive, like the village itself was watching, waiting.

Sleep didn’t come easy that night. When it finally did, my dreams were full of whispers and shadowy figures, circling the sheep like predators in the dark.

The next morning, I woke with a start, my body aching from the restless night. The sheep seemed calm when I went outside, their bleating oddly harmonious, as if nothing had happened. I tried to shake off the unease clinging to me like a second skin. Today would be better. It had to be.

By midday, the sheep started acting up again. They veered off the main path, their movements more chaotic with each passing moment. I tried to guide them back, shouting and waving my staff, but they ignored me. That’s when I heard it a soft, lilting melody drifting through the air.

My stomach dropped. I didn’t need to check the list to know what this was. Rule 9 burned itself into my mind: If you hear a beautiful song while on the path and see a girl in a white dress, don’t stray from the path. She’s a witch, and if she notices you, she’ll follow you.

The melody grew louder, more hauntingly beautiful. My heart pounded as I scanned the trees. That’s when I saw her a woman in a flowing white dress standing at the edge of the woods. She was too still, like a statue, her head tilted slightly as though listening to some invisible rhythm.

She turned slowly, her eyes locking onto mine.

The sheep scattered, bleating wildly, as if sensing the same danger I did. I froze, clutching my staff, my mind racing. Her gaze was magnetic, pulling at me, willing me to step off the path. The melody was inside my head now, promising warmth, comfort, safety if only I’d come closer.

But I remembered the rule. I gritted my teeth and forced my eyes away, focusing on the panicked sheep instead. “Come on!” I shouted, herding them back together, refusing to give her another glance.

Out of the corner of my eye, I saw her move, gliding closer. The song grew louder, almost overwhelming, but I kept walking. My breath was shallow, my pulse hammering as I regrouped the sheep and started leading them away.

The figure lingered at the edge of my vision, never closer, but never farther. It wasn’t until the song faded and the trees thinned out that I finally let myself breathe.

I didn’t look back. I didn’t need to.

The day dragged on, the sun dipping lower with each passing hour. I was more on edge than ever, my eyes constantly scanning the horizon for any sign of danger. The sheep were calm now, grazing peacefully as if nothing had happened. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that the worst was yet to come.

The sun hung low in the sky, a red disc bleeding into the horizon. I glanced at the list again: Rule 4: Be back at the village by nighttime; you don’t want to see what happens in the dark.

I checked my watch. I’d lost track of time. The sheep were still scattered across the field, oblivious to the encroaching darkness. Panic set in as I hurriedly tried to gather them.

“Come on, move!” I yelled, waving my staff, but they wouldn’t budge. Some just stared at me with those unsettling, blank eyes, while others wandered farther away. The sky darkened rapidly, the first stars winking into existence above me.

The unease in the air thickened, pressing down on me like a weight. Shadows grew longer, deeper, almost alive. My breathing quickened as the last rays of sunlight disappeared, plunging the field into twilight.

Then I heard it a low, guttural growl coming from somewhere behind me.

I spun around, heart hammering in my chest. The field was empty, but the sound came again, closer this time. The sheep had stopped moving entirely, their heads turned in the same direction, staring into the darkness beyond the tree line.

“Stick to the sheep. Keep calm.” The old man’s warning echoed in my mind.

I dropped to the ground, crawling into the center of the herd, just as Rule 10 had instructed: If the sheep refuse to move, lay in the middle of the herd and don’t move until morning.

The growling grew louder, accompanied by the sound of heavy footsteps. My hands clenched the grass, my heart pounding so hard I thought it might give me away. I lay as still as possible, the sheep forming a barrier around me, their bodies unnaturally still.

Then I saw it a shape moving in the darkness. It was massive, hunched over, its limbs too long, its movements too unnatural. My throat tightened as it prowled closer, its glowing eyes scanning the field.

The creature paused near the edge of the herd, sniffing the air. My heart threatened to burst as it stepped closer, circling the flock. I squeezed my eyes shut, praying it wouldn’t notice me.

The sheep bleated softly, but they didn’t scatter. They just stood there, their eerie stillness protecting me in the center. The creature lingered for what felt like an eternity, its low growls reverberating through the ground beneath me.

Finally, it let out a bone-chilling howl and turned away, disappearing back into the woods. I didn’t dare move, didn’t even breathe, until the first light of dawn crept over the horizon.

When I finally stood, my legs trembling, I noticed several sheep were missing, their absence leaving gaps in the herd. I didn’t have time to dwell on it. I had to get back to the village before whatever that thing was decided to return.


The first light of dawn had brought with it a sense of fragile relief, but the events of the night weighed heavily on my mind. My hands were still shaking as I forced myself to gather the remaining sheep, pushing them forward, determined to get them and myself back to the village. I can't let this happen again. I won’t break another rule.

But the sky, already darkening as I walked, told me that time was slipping away faster than I wanted to admit. The weight of the previous night still hung over me like a thick fog, and I was filled with an overwhelming need to escape the dark woods and whatever had been watching me.

The sheep were reluctant to move. Every step I took seemed to push them farther away. I shouted, waved my staff, and even tried to physically herd them, but their behavior was erratic some of them stopped, others wandered off into the shadows at the edge of the field. The growl from the night before echoed in my mind, sending a chill through my spine.

"Come on!" I urged them, panic starting to rise in my chest. I glanced nervously at the sky, seeing the first hints of twilight bleeding across the horizon.

My heart sank as I checked my watch: I wasn’t going to make it.

I pushed the sheep forward as best as I could, but the panic in my chest was growing. The field was now impossibly still, save for the occasional bleat from the sheep. The sky was darkening, and the moon was rising faster than I could move.

I have to get them to the village.

But the path was getting longer, and the evening was coming faster. I stumbled, my body weary from the night’s ordeal, and when I looked up again, the trees were closer too close. The shadows seemed to stretch and reach for me. I could feel the weight of the approaching night.

Then it happened.

I glanced at the sheep again, trying to herd them more quickly, but they had stopped moving. All of them silent, still, staring into the distance with those blank, dead eyes. There was no sound except the wind, and the ominous growling from before seemed to be building again.

No… not now.

As I turned to hurry them along, I saw something else in the distance: a light.

It wasn’t just any light it was warm, steady, glowing faintly through the trees. The house.

The warnings rang in my mind like a bell. "If the lights are on, don’t go inside. And don’t let them see you."

But the fear, the darkness, the overwhelming terror of being alone in the field… I couldn’t keep going. My legs were like lead, my mind clouded. The house seemed like a beacon, something that could give me a moment of respite. Just for one night.

The sheep began moving, as if of their own accord, their heads low and unblinking, heading toward the house. They were leading me.

I tried to stop them, calling out in desperation. “No! Not there! We need to keep moving!”

But they wouldn’t listen. Instead, they grew more insistent, moving in an unholy synchronization, their bodies guiding me toward the house. I took a step back, but the shadows seemed to shift, the growling from earlier growing louder. It wasn’t just the creature now it was the entire air around me, closing in.

The house’s lights gleamed like a false promise. It called to me, pulling me in. I wanted to stay, I needed to stay. I glanced back at the sheep, who were now circling the house, their bleats strangely distant.

And before I knew it, my legs carried me toward it. I was there, standing at the doorstep, hand shaking as I touched the door. I hesitated for a moment, but the pull of the house, the endless shadows, was too much.

 I stepped inside.
