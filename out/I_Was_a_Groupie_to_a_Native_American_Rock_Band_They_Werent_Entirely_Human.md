My name is Adelice, and I’m a fifth-generation voodoo practitioner. Born and raised in the gutters of Louisiana, I learned the ancient ways of my ancestors from a very young age. Under the guidance of my grandmother - long rest her soul, I learned all kinds of neat things. I learned to heal the sick with herbal medicine, keep away the bad spirits that torment our homes, and yes... I even learned zombification. Nevertheless, the greatest gift I have is one passed down from one generation to another. When I was still just a little girl, my grandmother told me the women in our family have a very special power... We can talk to the dead – or, more precisely... the dead can talk to us. 

Running my grandmother’s little voodoo shop here in the city, I have conversations with the dead on a regular basis. In fact, they’re my best customers. For example, there’s my favourite customer miss Lafleur, a French noblewoman from the seventeenth century. 

‘Bonsoir miss Lafleur.’ 

‘Bonsoir, ma charmante confidente! Quelle belle nuit!’ 

The dead are always desperate to talk to the living. Oh, how lonely those courteous spirits must be. Then again, I have had the occasional bigoted spirit wander into my abode from time to time.  

‘Miss... you know your kind ain’t welcome here’ said an out of touch plantation owner. 

‘Excuse me, mister, but this is my store you happened to wander into. It is your kind who ain’t welcome here.’ 

Of all the customers who have come and gone over the years, both the living and unliving, the most notable by far happened back in the year, nineteen eighty-five, when I was still just a young lady. On a rather gloomy, quiet evening in the month of October, I was enjoying some peaceful solitude with my black cat Laveau - when, as though out’a nothing, I acquire this uneasy, claustrophobic feeling, like an animal out in the open. Next thing I know, the doorbell chimes as a group of four identical men walk in, dressed head to foot in fine black leather, where underneath the draping mess of their long dark curls, they don an expensive pair of black shades each.   

The aura these four young men came in here with certainly felt irregular, and it wasn’t just me that picked up on it. Laveau, resting purringly on the shop counter, rises from his slumber to ferociously hiss at these strangers, before hauling off some place safe. 

‘Laveau, get back here this instance!’ I yell, which to my brand-new customers, must have made me sound no stranger than a crazy cat lady.  

‘You named your cat Laveau?’ asks the most noticeable of these men, having approached the counter with a wide and spontaneous grin upon his face, ‘As in the Voodoo Priestess?... That’s pretty metal!’ he then finishes, the voice matching his Rock ‘n’ Roll attire.  

‘The one and only’ I reply, smiling back pleasantly to the customer, ‘Are you boys looking for something in particular?’ 

‘Well, that depends...’ the Rock ‘n’ Roller then said, now leaning over the counter towards me, having removed his shades so I can get a better look at his face, ‘By any chance... are you for sale?’ 

Before I can respond or even process the question asked, I stare at the young man’s face, and to my shock, I see his eyes, staring intently into mine, are not the familiar colour of brown or any other, but a bright and almost luminous yellow! Frightened half to death by the revelation, my body did not move, instead frozen in some kind of entrancement.  

‘...Excuse me?’ I manage to utter. 

‘Oh miss, I’m sorry’ he apologizes, having chosen his words poorly, ‘What I meant to say was, of all the trinkets in this store of yours, you are by far the most enchanting.’  

He was a rockstar alright – a silver-tongued one at that. But once the entrancement finally wore off, regaining myself, I quickly realize I knew exactly who these strange men were. 

‘...My God - you’re...’ I began to speak, my trembling voice still recovering, ‘You’re the band, A.L.!’ my realization declares. 

‘What gave it away?’ asks the rockstar with a smile, clearly well acquainted with being recognized, ‘Most folks don’t recognize us without the paint, but once the shades are off, they know exactly who we are.’ 

Although they don’t need much of an introduction, A.L. were one of the most popular shock bands of the eighties. Credited as being the first indigenous rock band, they would perform on stage with their faces painted, bodies shirtless and feathers flowing through their long wavy hair, all while howling like coyotes at the moon. 

Despite my sheltered upbringing, I had always been a fan of rock music, and rather coincidentally, A.L. were one of my favourite bands. So, you can imagine my shock when they suddenly walked into my more than humble abode. It was almost like I manifested the whole thing – though it has never been as strong as this before. 

‘How rude of me’ then shrilled the rockstar, ‘Let me introduce you to my friends...’ Turning to the three band members snooping around the store, the yellow-eyed, silver-tongued devil then introduced each member, ‘This is Harrowhawk. Our bass player...’ Not that he needed to, but I already knew their names. Harrowhawk was the tallest member of the band, and unlike the others, his hair was straight and incredibly long. ‘This is Lungsnake. Our lead guitarist...’ Upon hearing his name, the one they call Lungsnake turns round to wave the signs of the horns at me, like all rockstars do. ‘And this is Cannibull...’ Despite the disturbing cleverness of his name, the drummer known as Cannibull was a far from intimidating creature, but he sure could pull his weight when it came to playing the drums. Saving himself till last, the yellow-eyed rocker finally introduces himself, ‘And I’m-’ 

‘-Sandwolf!’ I interrupt gleefully, ‘You’re Sandwolf... I already know your names.’ 

By far the most dreamy of the group, Sandwolf was both the founder and poster boy of the band. Again, grinning to show his satisfaction that I knew his name, he howled faintly with internal excitement.   

‘And what would be your name, Darlin?’ he now asks, as I try my best not to blush and quiver. 

‘You can call me Adelice’ I grant him. 

‘Well, tell me Adelice’ Sandwolf went on, ‘Are you a true Voodooist? Or do you just sell trinkets to gullible tourists?’ 

‘I’m the real thing, baby’ I reveal, excitement filling my voice, ‘You wanna wish granted, an enemy hexed... I’m the one you call.’ 

Sandwolf appeared impressed by these claims, as did the rest of the band – their attention now on us. Again smiling devilishly at me with satisfaction, Sandwolf now pulls a piece of paper from inside his leather jacket. 

‘Here’ he says, handing me the paper from across the counter, ‘Since you dig the band, why don’t you come to the concert tonight?’ 

Studying down at the ticket paper, I now feel rather embarrassed. I didn’t even know these guys were in town, let alone performing. 

‘Thank you mister Sandwolf!’ I exclaim rather foolishly, only now hearing my words aloud. 

‘Call me Wolf’ he corrects me, ‘And come find us backstage after the show. Security will let you in.’ 

Hold on a minute... There is no way A.L. are inviting me backstage after the concert! I must surely be dreaming! 

‘How will they know to let me in?’ I ask, trying to hide my fanaticism as best I could. 

‘That’s easy. You just tell them the password.’ 

‘And what’s the password?’  

Sandwolf smiles once more, as though toying with girls like this gave him sensational pleasure. 

‘The password is "Voodoo." Pretty fitting, don’t you think?’ 

Yeah, it kinda was. 

Once I accept the invitation, Sandwolf and the rest of the band leave my abode, parting me with the words, ‘See you tonight, sweetheart!’ 

Wow! I could not believe it! Not only had A.L. walked into my store, but they had now invited me backstage at the concert! It really pays to be a Voodooist sometimes. 

Closing shop early the next day, I dress myself up all nice for the concert, putting on my best fishnet vest, tight-fit black jeans and a purple bandana with the cutest little skulls on them. 

The arena that night was completely crowded. Groupies from all across Louisiana screaming their white-trash lungs out, guys howling and hollering... and then, the show began. All the lights went out, which just made the groupies scream even louder, before smoke lit up the stage, exposing A.L. in all their glory. My seat was somewhere in the back, but the jumbotron gave me a good look at my recent customers: faces painted and bodies gleaming with sweat. 

They played all the usual hits: Children of the Moon, Cry My Ancestors... But the song that everyone was waiting for, and my personal favourite, was Skin Rocker – and once the chorus came up, everybody was singing along... 

‘I wanna walk in your skin! I wanna feel you within! I’m just a Skin Rock-ER-ER!’  

‘I’M JUST A SKIN ROCKERRR!’ 

‘I’m just a... Skin Rocker!!’ 

Once the concert was finally over, I then made my way backstage. Answering the password correctly, I was brought inside a private room, where waiting for me, were all four band members... along with three young groupies beside them. 

‘Hey, it’s the Voodoo chick! She made it!’ announces Lungsnake, with his arm wrapped around one of the three groupies, ‘Have a seat, darlin!’  

After reacquainting myself with each member of the band, whom I’d only just seen the day before, Sandwolf introduces me to the other girls, ‘Ladies. This is Adelice... She knows voodoo and shit!’ 

The three girls gave me a simple nod of the head or an ingenuine “Hey.” They clearly didn’t like all the attention this lil’ Creole girl was receiving all’er sudden - when after all, they were here first. 

‘Alright, Adelice’ Lungsnake then wails, breaking up the pleasantries, ‘Show us what you got!’  

‘Excuse me?’ I ask confusedly. 

‘C’mon, Adelice. Show us some voodoo shit! That’s why you’re here after all.’ 

Ah, so that’s why I was here. They wanted to see some real-life voodoo shit. It wasn’t a secret that A.L. were into some dark magic – and although voodoo meant far more than sacrificing chickens and raising the dead, I agreed to show them all the same. 

Having brought some potions along from the store, I pour the liquids into an empty mop bucket. Sprinkling in some powder and imported Haitian plants, I then light a match and place it in the bucket, birthing a high and untameable fire. 

‘You guys wanna talk to the dead?’ I inquire, pulling out my greatest trick. 

‘Hell yeah, we do!’ Cannibull answers, as though for the whole group. 

‘Alright. Well, here it is...’ I began, raising my hands towards the fire, with my eyes closed shut, ‘If there is a spirit with us here tonight, please come forward and make your presence known through this fire.’ 

‘Don’t you need a Ouija board for that?’ asks the busty blonde, far from impressed. “Ouija boards are for white folks” I thought internally, as I felt a warm presence now close by. 

‘Good evening, mister!’ I announce to the room, to the band and groupie’s bewilderment. 

‘Good evening, miss’ a charming old voice croaks behind me, ‘That was some show your friends had tonight.’ 

Opening my eyes, I turn round to see an older gentlemen, wearing the fine suit of a jazz musician and humming a catchy little tune from between his lips.  

‘Mister. Would you kindly make your presence known to my friends here?’ I ask the spirit courteously. 

‘Why, of course, miss’ agrees the spirit, before approaching the fire and stroking his hand through the smoky flames, cutting the fire in half. 

‘Whoa!’ 

‘Holy shit!’ exclaim the members of the group, more than satisfied this was proof of my abilities. 

‘That’s totally metal, man! Totally metal!’ 

We had quite the party that night, drinking and drugs. The groupies making out with different members of the band – but not Sandwolf. In fact, I don’t quite remember him leaving my side. Despite his seductive charm and wiles, he was a complete gentlemen – to my slight dissatisfaction.  

‘Can I ask you something?’ I ponder to him, ‘Why are you guys always howling like coyotes?’ 

After snorting another line of white powder, Sandwolf turns up to me with glassy, glowing eyes, ‘Because we’re children of the night’ he reveals, ‘The moon is our mother, and when she comes out... we answer her call.’ Those were the exact lyrics of Children of the Moon I remembered, despite my drunken haziness.  

I woke up some time round the next day. Stirring up from wherever it was I passed out, I look around to find I’m in some hotel bedroom, where beside me, a sleeping Sandwolf snores loudly, wearing nothing else but his birthday suit. Damn it, I thought. The one time I actually get to sleep with a rockstar and I’m too shit-faced to remember. 

Trying painfully to wander my way to the bathroom, I enter the main room of the suite, having to step over passed out band members and half-naked groupies. Damn, that girl really was busty.  

Once in the bathroom, I approach the sink to splash cold water on my face. When that did nothing to relieve the pain I was feeling, I turn up to the cabinet mirror, hoping to find a bottle of aspirin or something. But when I look at my reflection in the mirror... I realize I’m not alone... 

Standing behind me, staring back at my reflection, I see a young red-headed woman in torn pieces of clothing... But the most disturbing thing about this woman, aside from her suddenly appearing in this bathroom with me, is that the girl was covered entirely in fresh blood and fatal wounds to her flesh... In fact, her flesh wounds were so bad, I could see her ribcage protruding where her left breast should’ve been!... And that’s when I knew, this wasn’t a living person... This was the spirit of some poor dead girl. 

Once I see the blood and torn pieces of flesh, the sudden shock jilts my body round to her, where I then see she’s staring at me with a partly shredded face – her cheek hanging down, exposing a slightly visible row of gurning teeth! 

In too much shock to scream or even process whether I’m dreaming, I just stare back at the girl’s animated corpse - my jagged breathes making the only sound between us... And before I can even utter a single word of communication to this girl, either to ask who she is or what the hell happened to her... the exposed muscles in her face spit out a single, haunting phrase... 

‘...GET AWAY FROM THEM!...’ 

And with that... the young dead girl was gone... as though she was never even there... 

Although I was in the dark as to how this girl met her demise, which at first glance, seemed as though she was torn apart by some wild animal, I could put together it had something to do with the band. After all, the dead girl looked no different to the many groupies that follow A.L. across the country. But if that really was the case... What in God’s name happened to her?? As uncomprehensive as the dead girl’s words were, they were comprehensive enough that I knew it was a warning... a warning of the future that was near to happen.  

You see, in Voodoo, when a spirit makes its presence known, you have to do whatever it is they say. Those were the first words of wisdom I ever remember my grandmother telling me. If a spirit were ever to communicate with you, it is because they are trying to warn you... and what that poor dead girl said to me, was a warning if I ever did hear one! 

Without questioning the dead girl’s words of warning, I quickly and quietly get my things together before a single member of the band can wake from their slumber. I cat-paw my way to the door, and once I was out of there, I run like hell! ...And I never saw Sandwolf or A.L. ever again... 

Ever since that night of October, nineteen eighty-five, not once did a day go by that I didn’t ask myself what the hell happened to that girl. How did she die the way she did, and what did it have to do with the band? 

I know what y’all are thinking, right?... Adelice, those boys were clearly werewolves and they killed that poor girl... 

Well, that’s what I thought. I mean, why else would they have yellow eyes and howl like coyotes during each concert?... 

There’s just one slight problem... During the night of the concert, I specifically remember it being a full moon that night, and yet, not a single one of those boys turned into monsters... Oh, and I’m pretty sure Lungsnake’s nipple rings were made of pure silver. 

Well... if those boys weren’t werewolves, then...  

...What the hell were they??
