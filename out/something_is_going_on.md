As you have probably seen by the title this started in a club I was with a girl her name passes me because of the excessive amount of drugs I was on at that time, that will become more prevalent. I don't know what is really real anymore, When I was 14 and I figured out how dark net markets work which led down an interesting path of wondering how psychedelics impact the brain. I'm a neuroscience student now and have learned allot more about how the misuse of the ht-2A serotonin receptor can impact the brain in the moment and for years following too. now I'm 19 and I'm an alcoholic. As Morpheus says "What is real? How do you define 'real'? If you're talking about what you can feel, what you can smell, what you can taste and see, then 'real' is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain." I wish I could answer this, but the problem with psychedelics is the more you take them, the more doorways open in your mind, leading to nothing but further questions, no answers will ever be given.



i recently went to university and it was nothing but terrifying. I found people older than me experienced in the horrors of the world.  Being the magnet for trouble that I am of course I immediately brought the failures of god straight to me. While life at uni started out normal it quickly devolved into nothing but a chaotic series of despicable events, even the good moments I had during that time devolved into a degenerate series of events. Anyway I guess as some sort of writer its an obligation to explain who I am at least somewhat.

I'm simply a university student trying his best to navigate life outside his home. One thing you should know is my university is hundreds of miles from where my hometown is. The moment I got there loneliness set in, a pure sense of isolation. I had nobody but myself to keep my brain occupied. so like any true self respecting gamer I tuned into the one thing that would never fail me, half life 2. I look back and now I realise that while I would never want to admit it at the time, this is what began my descent. I drank insane amounts and played half life 2 all day religiously to the point that I started speedrunning the game. nothing left anymore in my life other than a bottle of white lightning and the false reality of the illuminated screen. At some point I decided my life was fucked (probably when I stopped eating or sleeping). I had to make friends so I signed up for every society I could find. While it seemed clever at the time it was pretty much a scam. I got nothing out of it other than one poor girl, lets just say she was new to the country and some very HORRIFIC things were done to her as she was clearly vulnerable.

She called me one night and I answered. I don't know why because I hated everyone an the time. She told me there was a party going on at a club called switch so I agreed to go, I suppose you could say I was following the white rabbit. 10pm rolled around after spending hour doing acid, mushrooms and ketamine. While on a combination of many things I stumbled my way out of my accommodation barley making my way out of the place. I walked down the street towards switch (the club) and somehow made it there in one piece. The moment I get there I realise something is wrong. i know what an acid come up feels like and I'm about to start tripping, I know it for sure.  All the colours around me become much more vibrant. its almost like seeing a 4k television for the first time where the picture clarity and vibrancy are just raised to the max settings. it doesn't help that all of the walls are covered in beautiful and almost unexplainable geometry, It was like seeing an endless staircase and while that sounds lame have you ever seen it with your own eyes?

I began down the stairs and herd an echo of distant music, like some sort of reversed jazz., As i descended the stairs to where the basement was things became strange  Club music which was expected, carried on playing,

Something was off. As I got closer I realised this music was overlapping. not only one song was playing but multiple at the same time. I put this down to some sort of DJ  error with his soundboard fucking up because that made sense.  but if I looked around only 3 of us were left  in the club. The music was clearly a farce or some sort of attempt at avoiding taxes. I still ponder on this experience as where was my perception really at.

At this point I knew that at some point in the night I had been given acid. acid is one of the worst things you can be spiked with. Drugs like GHB can be more scary long term due to the chance of being knocked up or r\*ped. But with acid, the distortions of reality that I had been trying to avoid for many years became real again, carpeted surfaces had patterns in them and if you were not my friend you would think I was manic already especially considering how paranoid I was. think of acid like this, unless someone is a member of your tribe they are an enemy. its almost a child like state where you go back to 99% fight of flight.

I talked to one of the few girls there one of which being the poor victim, damn. Could have done something but I have less balls than a mosquito.. the club was empty, just the four of us, I've got video proof but why would anyone believe me, after all I'm just some dumb uni student. The world around me was literally bending, concrete being flexible, rubber as hard as steel. I got taken down into the basement where I was told by the girls id 'see a good time' and there's a first for everything. This gives the  explanation as to why I didn't struggle, it seemed awesome! neon lights, pink, red, blue, green everywhere but then there was an old lady with a cracked and distorted face, One of her eyes lower than the other, skin cracked broken and hardened as if some sort of horrible torment had befoul her. I had some suspicions and I'm sure HER or it seeing the shock on my face was obviously delighted by the twisted expression on the poor hookers face, it was an expression of wisdom like seeing a century in a a second such as a veteran would see at war;. The cult asked me if id like to see HER. having nothing left for me in the real world anyway why would I not want to see this ominous HER they speak of. and then I saw her. She's beautiful, look into the light or you will never know.

At this point I'm left without words. I rose to the surface never to return again, My hate of humanity has only become stronger "I hate this place. This zoo. This prison. This reality, whatever you want to call it, I can't stand it any longer."

an incomprehensible amalgamation of thought
