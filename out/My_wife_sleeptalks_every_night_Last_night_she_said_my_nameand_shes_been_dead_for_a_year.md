I haven’t slept properly in months. The house feels like it’s shrinking at night, the walls pressing in, whispering with the wind that creeps through every crack. I moved back in here two months ago—our old home, the one I shared with Mira before she died. I thought coming back would help me heal. Instead, I think I brought her with me.

The first night back, I heard it—soft, rhythmic breathing beside me. I told myself it was the wind, maybe the pipes. But the next night, I heard words.

> “Cold… so cold…”

It was Mira’s voice. The same tone she used when she was half-asleep, asking me to close the window. My heart froze. I turned on the bedside lamp, but the bed was empty. Of course it was. I laughed, a sharp, hollow sound, and blamed my exhaustion.

But then it started happening every night.

The whispering always begins around 2:47 AM. Always the same pattern: a low murmur, a sigh, and then a few words. Sometimes it’s just gibberish. Sometimes it’s something that sounds like my name. I recorded it once. The next morning, when I played it back, all I heard was static—except for one thing. Just before the recording ended, Mira’s voice whispered, *“Stop listening.”*

I deleted the file.

Last week, I woke up to the sound of humming—her favorite lullaby. It came from the kitchen. I went downstairs, still half-asleep, and there she was.

Not Mira, not really. Just a faint outline in the dark, the air bending wrong around her shape. I could smell her shampoo, the same floral scent she used to wear. She turned toward me, but her face wasn’t there—only a hollow blur. The humming stopped. Then she said, in a voice that scraped against my skull:

> “You shouldn’t have come back.”

I ran. I slept in my car that night.

Every morning since then, something has been changing. The mirrors in the house fog up with handprints that aren’t mine. The photographs on the wall—our wedding photos—keep shifting slightly. In one, I swear Mira’s eyes follow me now. And the worst part? Every time I try to leave, something stops me. The car won’t start. My phone battery dies, no matter how much I charge it.

Two nights ago, I finally snapped. I shouted into the dark, begging her to stop, to let me go. And she did—silence, for the first time in weeks.

Then, yesterday morning, I found something under my pillow: a small piece of paper, folded twice. On it, in Mira’s handwriting, were the words:
**“Check the basement.”**

I shouldn’t have, but I did.

The basement door had been jammed shut since I moved back in. I forced it open with a crowbar. The smell hit me first—damp, rotten earth. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and saw something that made me drop it.

There were scratch marks on the inside of the basement door. Deep, desperate grooves in the wood. And below them, faintly visible in the dirt, was a name carved over and over again:
**“Mira.”**

I don’t remember much after that. I think I blacked out. When I came to, I was lying in bed. The morning light was streaming in through the window. I told myself it was just a nightmare.

Then I saw her wedding ring on the nightstand.

I buried her with that ring.

It’s 2:46 AM now. I can hear the breathing again, slow and steady beside me. I want to move, to run, but my body won’t respond. The air feels heavy. My chest won’t rise. The clock ticks once, twice.

2:47 AM.

Her voice is right next to my ear now. I can feel the cold on my neck, the way she used to lean in before kissing me goodnight.

> “I missed you,” she whispers.

The bed dips.
Something crawls under the blanket.
And for the first time, I whisper back.

> “Me too.”
