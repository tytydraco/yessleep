When I was very young, my grandfather used to always tell me to stay out of the woods behind our house.

  
"Legend has it, that there's something terrible in there." He'd say, pointing to the trees behind our home with his only arm, the other of which he'd told me he had lost in the war. "And no one who goes in, ever comes back the same."  


But I never took his warnings very seriously, given his age, and hard life, writing them off as the ramblings of a senile and bitter old man.  


At least until a few years later, when, at the age of ten, I was told by my mother that my grandfather had passed…  


...And had left me a parting gift.  


It was a crumpled envelope with the word "Bobby" scribbled onto the back, sealed with more tape than an envelope needed sealing.  


Inside, was a folded piece of paper, which, upon unfolding, I noticed my grandfather had sketched the layout of what looked like three games.  


Beside the first two games, he had written instructions for what looked like how to beat them.  


"Don't go in the box."  


"Don’t run."  


Beside the third, were a couple more notes.  


"Don’t lift it alone."  


"This is as far as I made it, before I lost my arm."  


And at the very bottom of the page, Grandpa had addressed me directly.  


"Bobby, if you receive an invitation to play the games in the woods, do not accept it. Run as far away as you can. But in the event you end up there anyway, may these instructions help you finish what I started."  


*Games in the woods?* I thought to myself. *After all the warnings, and all the lectures, Grandpa was trying to protect me from games?*  


I found the whole thing quite silly, and resolved to put it out of my mind.  


And so, that's exactly what I did, burying away both the loss of my Grandfather, and the gift that he had left for me, for four long years.  


That is, until, at the age of fourteen, when I was a freshman in high school, I received a scroll on my doorstep, tied together with a thorny vine.  


After carefully unraveling it, I discovered an invite to the very games that my Grandfather had warned me about, grotesquely handwritten in ink.  


"Bobby,  


Join us in the forest behind your house tonight, to compete in the games in the woods.  


Don't be late. The games will begin promptly at midnight."  


I laughed out loud and immediately tore up the scroll on the spot.  


*But who could be the one pranking me?* I wondered. *Surely my mom wasn't in on it? Who could have known about the invitation that my Grandfather referenced? Maybe my Uncle Frank? He's always been a jokester. Yes, it must be Uncle Frank.*  


And on that note, I went about my day, and completely forgot about the scroll.  


That is, until later that night, when, while fast asleep, I suddenly felt myself torn from my bed, stuffed into what felt like a canvas satchel, and dragged out my window and, from the sound of it, what must have been through the woods behind my house.  


The whole time, I tried my best to kick and scream…  


"This isn't funny, Uncle Frank! I know what you're up to!"  


...But Uncle Frank, or so I thought, was much too strong to break free from, and the next thing I knew, I found myself dropped into the middle of the forest, and my satchel ripped away.  


"Uncle Frank?" I called out, unable to see my surroundings in the dark.  


Until my eyes adjusted, and I looked up to find a hooded figure, wearing a tattered brown cloak and holding a burning torch that illuminated everything around him, save for what lay under his shadowy hood.  


*What the heck?* I thought to myself. *That's not Uncle Frank.*  


The shrouded man said no words, and simply pointed to a footbridge, lit by torchlight, not far away, and gestured for me to cross it.  


Realizing now that this wasn't Uncle Frank's doing, and in turn, that the letter, and my Grandfather's warning, must both be real, I began shaking in fear and, not knowing what else to do, obeyed the hooded figure's order.  


When I got to the other side, I found myself surrounded by what must have been twenty of the hooded man's kin, all holding torches, and encircling a glen in the forest, where the moon and the stars could now be seen in the night sky.  


And in the center of the glen, were four poor souls. Kids like me, who must have also received the invitation, or been dragged here against their will, or both. Kids, from my high school, that I recognized.  


There was Brad Ashworth, our class valedictorian, in a sweater vest, khakis, and boots, clearly prepared for the occasion…  


...Caitlin Sullivan, whom many kids called a nerd, geek, dweeb, and weirdo, but whom I found to be perfectly normal, wearing a pair of overalls and round, wire frame glasses…  


...Colin Richardson, in a running suit, a jock, known for excelling at at least three sports, football, track, and basketball..  


...And none other than Milton Dugan, the biggest bully in school, best known for using his sheer size to jam freshmen into lockers, wearing a pair of polka dot pajamas.  


"Shut up, loser." He called out to me, noticing the smile on my face when I saw what he was wearing.  


"What do you think they are?" Colin asked me, pointing to the hooded figures.  


"I have no idea. But I don't think they're friendly." I replied.  


Until Caitlin chimed in, "They're Druids, idiots."  


"Whatever they are, I'm not scared of them." Brad added.  


That's when it hit me.  


*Who would bring five high school students out into the middle of the woods to teach them a lesson? Well, teachers of course. That must be it! Teachers! Yes, it's teachers under those hoods!*  


But before I could continue to dwell on my epiphany, we were all suddenly interrupted, by the sound of a loud howl emanating from the forest.  


And then…  


...An old man with a white beard came hobbling out of the woods, walking stick in one hand, and an object that I couldn’t identify in his other.  


It was only when he reached the center of the glen, and stopped just a few feet away from us, that I noticed he was missing something…  


...The reflection of light in his eyes.  


And upon further observation, it became apparent…  


...That he had no eyes at all.  


*What the?* I thought to myself, before gasping, as the old man began to speak.  


"Invited ones. You stand before me tonight, under the light of the moon, with a great challenge before you. A challenge that only comes around every seventy-five years. Each of you, were hand picked to play these games tonight, for each of you represent a unique virtue. Five virtues put to the same test, to see which will overcome all others. The winner, will be awarded the greatest prize of all. While the losers, will pay a heavy price."  


The other four kids and I turned to each other with looks of confusion, then turned back to the old man, who continued.  


"But before we begin. Which of you, knows for a fact, that you are the best player among us? Which of you, is so brave, so courageous, so sure of your abilities, that you'll volunteer to step into the box?" He asked, pointing to an area of the glen, that had been covered in darkness, but until the Druids lit it with torchlight.  


It was a wooden box, about the size of a telephone booth, completely enclosed with what appeared to be a door on one side and a metal latch to open it.  


*The Box!* I thought to myself, remembering my Grandfather's letter, outlining three games, and assuming the first of which was this one.  


*"Don't go in the box.”*  


*Easy enough.* I mused, looking over at the other kids, waiting for one of them to heed the call instead, until…  


"It's me. I'm the smartest, and the most talented one here. I'll do it." Brad called out, raising his hand, before turning back to us, "Cowards."  


"Very well," The old man replied, walking over to the box, opening the door, and gesturing for him to enter.  


And so he did.  


*Oh no.* I thought to myself, as all of us kids cringed in anticipation of something unspeakable happening inside.  


But after a minute, the old man simply walked back over to the door, opened it, and let Brad out.  


He came proudly walking out of it, chest in the air, with a smug smile on his face, and belted out the words. "See! Nothing to fear, fraidy cats."  


Despite his obnoxious comment, we all let out a sigh of relief.  


Until suddenly, a few of the druids grabbed Brad by the arms, and pinned him to the box.  


"What's going on? What are you doing?" Our valedictorian cried out, unsure of what exactly was happening.  


The hooded men proceeded to pry open his jaws with their hands, as the old man hobbled over to him, revealing the object in his hand… a sharp, silver sword.  


But before any of us could react, the old druid had already reached into Brad's mouth, cut off his tongue, and held it up for all to see.  


Brad began crying and wailing, blood spraying from his mouth, as the druids let him go and he fell to the ground, arms flailing in pain.  


Meanwhile, the rest of us kids just stood there, wide eyed in fear, unable to comprehend what we had just seen.  


"That was Game One." The old man called out to us. "Let it be a lesson, that your greatest strengths can also be your greatest weaknesses. In this case, confidence begets arrogance. Now, take him away."  


Upon his command, two druids ran over to Brad, who was now passed out, picked him up, and carried him away into the woods.  


"Let's move on to Game Two, shall we?" The eyeless old man continued, leading us, and the other druids, out of the glen, into the forest, down a torchlit path, and to a massive field, illuminated by the moonlight.  


He then took his staff, stuck it into the ground, and carved a long line in the dirt.  


"Will the remaining players please stand behind the line."  


Still in shock from what had just happened, we all obeyed his command, lining up before the line in the dirt, which separated us from the football field sized lawn.  


"Are you gonna hurt one of us again?" Milton called out, puffing out his chest. "Cause I'm not afraid of you guys, and I’m fully capable of defending myself!"  


The old man ignored his rant, and continued on with his own, "The rules of the second game are simple. When I say go, you're to run with the wolves."  


"Wolves?" Caitlin whispered to me, trying to understand he meant.  


Just then, a group of druids emerged from the forest, leading four ravenous wolves on leashes to the field behind us, each of them drooling at the mouth while howling and growling at us maniacally.  


Caitlin and I shared a brief look of horror, before the eyeless man stepped aside and called out, "Go!"  


Colin was the first one to sprint off into the field, followed by Caitlin, and then, what would have been me, but when I began to dart away, something jutted out in front of my legs and tripped me to the ground.  


Confused by what had happened, I looked up from the dirt to see Milton hopping over me…  


"Sucker!"  


...As I realized that it must have been he who had tripped me, and saw the Druids unleash the four wolves.  


I hopped up to my feet and attempted to run again, but before they hit the ground, the wolves had already caught up to me.  


In that moment, I closed my eyes and braced for the worst, but when I opened them again, I saw that they had run right past me, seemingly in pursuit of the others up ahead.  


But as I continued to watch the wolves run away, I noticed that they soon passed Milton too, and then Caitlin, finally making their way to Colin, who was running so fast, that he disappeared into whatever lay beyond the field.  


And then, the feral dogs stopped running, just before the end of the field, and began howling and growling again, and they looked down at something below them.  


Eventually catching up with the others and making my way to the end of the field, Caitlin, Milton, and myself finally saw what had happened to Colin.  


There, at the end of the field, was a great pit, and at the bottom, was the star athlete himself, writhing in pain and begging for our help.  


"Help me!" Colin called out, clenching his legs, which must have broken from the fall.  


"Does anyone have a rope or anything we can lower down to him?" Caitlin asked.  


But the druids had just arrived, and were already lowering one down to Colin.  


And by the time they pulled him up, still screaming out in pain, the old eyeless druid had arrived, ready to greet him.  


"Why would you put a pit at the end of the race?" Colin screamed, as he lay helpless on the ground.

&#x200B;

"You said to run from the wolves."  


"I said to run with the wolves, not from them. They mean no harm, just look at your friends here. But you. You got ahead of yourself. And for that, there is a price." The old man warned.  


"Price? I already broke my legs." Colin replied.  


"Well now, we take them." The eyeless man said ominously, before the druids surrounded Colin and held him down, as another approached him holding a giant scythe, its blade glimmering in the moonlight.  


"Wait! No!" He cried out.  


But it was too late. In an instant, one of his legs was gone. Severed from his body by the swinging scythe, as blood sprayed everywhere, and Colin screamed in agony.  


A second later, I saw Caitlin remove her glasses and wipe the blood from them, before putting them back on and continuing to watch on silently in horror.  


"What is wrong with you guys?" Milton called out, clenching his fists and pacing around in a threatening fashion.  


For a moment, I thought about cursing out Milton for tripping me, but then I realized he had actually saved me.  


And that's when I remembered my Grandfather's second clue.  


*"Don't run."*  


He was right again.  


"Take him away." The old man said for a second time, as a group of druids walked over and proceeded to carry Colin off into the woods, before turning to Milton, Caitlin, and myself.  


"And now for Game Three."  


He then led us back into the forest, and down a rocky path that hugged a winding stream.  


At the end of the path, we came to a clearing between the trees, where we saw two giant boulders, each nearly the size of a person, placed side by side on the ground.  


"For this game, you have an option. Lift a boulder yourself, or pick a teammate to help you lift it. The person or team who holds it the longest, wins. And the one who's first to drop it, loses. Understand?"

&#x200B;

Milton, Caitlin, and I all looked at each other for a moment, as we weighed the options.  


But suddenly, I remembered my Grandfather’s third instruction.  


*"Don’t lift it alone."*  


And before Milton could utter a word, I ran over to Caitlin.  


"Caitlin and I will be a team." I declared, as she smiled, and put her arm around my shoulder.  


"But what about me?" Milton asked, offended by being the odd man out, before correcting himself. "Actually, you know what? Fine! I'm stronger than both of you combined anyway. This will be your own undoing, dorks! I'll compete by myself."  


"Very well," the old man called out, as he stood between the two stones. "When I say go, lift the boulders up off the ground, for as long as you can."  


Caitlin and I crouched down and gripped the boulder from below, then looked at each other.  


"We got this." I assured her with a smile.  


"We got this." She replied, smiling back.  


Meanwhile, Milton was scrambling to grasp onto his boulder, and began begging for more time. "Just a second, I swear. This boulder's heavier on one side and it's just-"  


But before he could continue, the old man raised his staff and called out, "Go!" at the top of his lungs.  


Caitlin and I carefully and calmly lifted our boulder, and despite its heavy weight, strained ourselves to keep it elevated above the ground.  


But Milton was not as lucky. From the very beginning, he was doomed, as he still hadn't secured his grip on the rock when the old man yelled "Go!" and bumbled when he lifted it up, catching it in hands, but in an position that looked much too uncomfortable for him sustain.  


And as the stone slowly began to slip out of his arms, Milton looked over at Caitlin and I with a sour face and mumbled, "You screwed me, losers."  


"Maybe if you weren't such a dick, Milton, someone might have chosen you." I replied, in an attempt to drive home the reason why he had lost.  


Milton tried to think of a clever retort, "You know what, Bobby-" but before he could finish his sentence, it was too late. The stone had fallen to the ground. He stopped what he was saying and looked down at it, a look of fear washing over his face.  


And as the druids began to surround him, rather than threaten them like he had in the past, Milton began to cry. "Please don't hurt me! Please, I'll do anything!"  


But it was too late. The druids dragged Milton to the stump of a tree and laid his arm down upon it, as another swung an ax high above his head, and brought it slicing down through Milton's arm, leaving him with a stump of his own.  


As he saw the blood pouring out of his appendage, Milton began to scream, until his eyes rolled into the back of his head and he eventually passed out.  


And for a third time, the eyeless old man called out, "Take him away."  


Now, only Caitlin and I remained. Together we stood there in silence, arms around each other, as Milton's limp body was carried off into the woods.  


"Which brings us to Game Four," the old druid began, "Perhaps the simplest of all. For this game is decided by you and you alone. When I say go, you'll have one minute to come to a decision on who will be the winner, and who will be the loser."  


Caitlin replied "Wait-"  


But before she could continue, the old man interrupted her, commencing the final game, "Go!"  


Caitlin and I huddled together in the woods, as the old man, and the druids, encircled us, waiting for us to come to a consensus.  


"Wait, what do we do?" Caitlin whispered.  


"I don't know." I whispered back.  


"Should we choose both of us as the winners?"  


"No, we'd be breaking the rules. He specified a winner and a loser. They'll punish us both. We need to choose one."  


"But that means one of us, will suffer the same fate as the others."  


"I don't know if we have any other choice.”  


"Then how should we decide?"  


"I don't know."  


"Wait," Caitlin said, as she reached into the pocket of her overalls and removed a coin. "If you're okay with it. A coin toss would be fair. Totally up to chance.”  


"It would be fair. Let's do it. But quick." I replied, knowing our minute would soon end.  


"Then you choose. Heads or tails." She offered up.  


"Okay. Um... heads!" I replied quickly.  


And like that, Caitlin held out her fist…  


...Dropped the coin…  


...Towards the forest floor below…  


...Time suddenly slowing…  


...As it descended towards the ground…  


...Spinning…  


...And spinning…  


…And spinning…  


...Until…  


...Thud.  


We both crouched down, and saw the result that would seal our fate forever…  


…Heads.  


I had won.  


Caitlin looked up at me, her eyes wide, and her mouth agape, as tears began to roll down her cheeks.  


 "I'm sorry." I whispered.  


"It's okay." She whispered back.  


And then…  


...The old man spoke.  


"Your time is up. What is your decision? Who is the winner, and who is the loser?"  


Both Caitlin and my heads hung low, as she began to speak, "I'm the-"  


"Winner." I interrupted, as she looked at me, completely surprised by what I had said. "She's the winner, and I'm the loser."  


"But Bobby-" She whispered.  


"Save yourself. Don't worry about me." I insisted, whispering back to her, as the old man approached us.  


"Very well." He said, holding his wrinkled hand out to Caitlin, who accepted it in hers.  


And so, he escorted her away, off into the woods, hobbling on his wooden staff, until they disappeared into the night.  


And as for me. I… well I was left there in the dark, surrounded by a dozen druids, who slowly closed in on me.  


I didn't know what to do so I, accepting my fate, simply closed my eyes and braced for the worst…  


...But similar to what had come of the impending doom of the howling wolves...

&#x200B;

...Nothing happened.  


I opened my eyes, to find one of the druids standing before me.  


"Congratulations..." He said, in an ominous voice, "...On winning the games."  


"What?" I asked, confused how that could be possible. "I don't understand. I voted for Caitlin to be the winner."  


"Yes, you did." He replied, "But humility is the virtue that always wins the games. Your selfless act, sacrificing your own life for that of another's, is why you won."  


"And what do I win?" I asked, not knowing what else to say.  


"Just as the keeper of the games had stated, the greatest prize of all..." He said, "..Life."  


"And what about Caitlin? What will become of her?"  


"That is still yet to be decided. But you will find out soon enough."  


Any sort of relief that I had felt immediately disappeared, and my heart sank, as I realized that by volunteering my own life to save Caitlin's, I may have actually cost her hers.  


"Wait," I called out, "Let me take her place. Please."  


But before I could continue, I felt the druids shove a giant canvas satchel over me, just as they'd done earlier that night, before whisking me away into the forest.  


They must have knocked me out after that, because when I came to, I found myself back in my bedroom, lying face first on the cold, wooden floor.  


The next day at school, I raced to Caitlin's locker, and then her home room, desperately hoping to see her face, hoping to put my mind at ease…  


...But she never showed up. That day… or ever again.  


And as for Brad, Colin, and Milton, their claims about how they lost their respective body parts, despite being substantiated by me, were all written off by police, parents, and teachers alike as foolish accidents, when no such games were ever found in the woods.  


Years later, as my wife and I discuss having a child, I find myself wondering if I'll ever have a grandchild of my own…  


...If they, too, will be invited to play the games in the woods, the next time the druids come around…  


...And if Caitlin will be one of them.
