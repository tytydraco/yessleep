Have you ever gotten that kinda creepy feeling when something or someone's watching you? I don't know why, but sometimes in public I feel like someone's calling my name, it's strange. I get caught in a spur of the moment,  time stops. The noise of the crowd gets a few decibels quieter, and then I hear it like a friend trying to get your attention or a loved one trying to call you over to join them in an activity. I was never the person to want to be out in public but the times I was forced too it's like there was something weird out there preying upon me always hiding and following. Then one day I felt it in my home it was 4am and I had to get up and get ready for work I had a 30 minute drive to work in the dark on a county road I knew there wasn't gonna be a lot of traffic but big rig 18 wheelers were all too common any time of the day in Texas but like I was saying I was getting ready for work.

I kissed my wife grabbed my clothes I had set out  the night before passing my son's crib I noticed he wasn't covered all the way so after tucking him in I went and got dressed but it was weird I felt a foreign feeling pass over me when I stepped through the door way from our bedroom to the hallway that leads to the rest of the house and I had a wave of fear fall over me that strange feeling of eyes creeping in the darkness just .... staring, watching me. As I swallowed what courage and bravery I had, I continued down the hall to the glow and safety of my bathrooms light. Not thinking of course I could be harmed but the feeling never lifted. After cleaning myself up with deodorant, cologne and brushing my teeth, my eyes crept back to look down the hallway and nothing... no eyes... no weird feeling... it's like my act of bravery of just making it to the bathroom safe was a salvation of sorts a reward from a higher being if you will. 

After spitting the toothpaste from my warm, hot and now wet mouth, I slowly walked into the living room to get fully dressed and put on my boots. I've heard from others that there is a phenomenon with dim lighting where if you're in a room with dim lighting alone and everything else is dark, your brain will start to imagine shapes, similarly when you stare at clouds and see dogs and cats or whatever.As I pulled my first boot on my gaze wandered to my son's room (he's only baby but sleeps in our room although we still have a room for his things) As my eyes gazed up I noticed the door was cracked it might be the dim lighting in our living room but I felt the foreign feeling stronger this time as if something was there looking at me through the cracked door no light, no nightlights, no pictures, and no mirrors, almost nothing except essentials you would need for a infant.

 But as I stared at the cracked door I saw a reflection of light staring into my soul it was about thatvsize was that of a golf ball I'd say this one small reflection stood taller than myself and was eyeing me down with the most malicious wrath that  I could feel a wave of fear wash over me as I quickly put my other boot on.  standing up i  kept my eye on the strange reflection I walked slowly over to the mantle and grabbed the first thing I felt unfortunately for me my weapon had to be a tee ball bat it wasn't long or sharp but it was wooden and blunt. "As I shakily made my way towards his room, I began to speak to the creature staring me down. 'W-what do you want?' I asked, my voice a broken whisper. 'Who are you?' I was loud enough to be heard from the short distance, but no sound was made when I approached the door frame." It felt as if my balls shriveled up inside me and wanted me to do nothing else but sprint out of that house. But before I could react to what my fear wanted I kicked the door open swinging it wide I flicked the light switch on quickly and as I reared back with the small bat I froze in place. Noticing the thing I was staring back was the small shiny marble pull chain ornament dangling from my son's ceiling fan a wave of relief fell over me as I fell knees first to the ground in exhaustion and crashing down from the high of being paranoid and stressing out. I then stood back up turned the light off closed the door made lunch and left. 

On my dark and lonely ride to work I couldn't think about anything else but that damn ornament dangling there, why was i so stressed, why did I get scared. I have no enemies... I know monsters aren't real.. my house isn't haunted but as I continued to think In the distance I saw a 18-wheeler pulling out onto the road ahead of me so naturally I slowed down and as we went down the road I thought to myself why didn't I check the other rooms? where was our dog? Who left the bathroom light on I remember my wife fell asleep before I did last night and why was my dons room door get opened we don't go in there unless we have too. 

As I continued to ask myself more questions I began to wonder what if someone's in the car with you? As I felt the increase of saliva in my throat I gulp grabbing my rearview mirror I tried to adjust it nonchalantly to scan my back seats and as my focus broke from the road unexpectedly the 18 wheeler Infront of me hit the breaks to avoid a deer and that's when my car went from being my reliable daily drive to a sudden 9-1-1 call at 4:30am my engine slamming into the rear of a 18-wheeler going 75 mph in the dark of the morning crushing my legs, and trapping me into a crumpled mess of metal and plastic my car was compressed so easily why they chose to make cars out of aluminum I wont know but for now I'm laid up in a hospital and I'm safe but as I lay here in this hospital bed in the dark my bathroom light was left on by the nurse and on the far side of the room I feel that foreign feeling that same presence lingering and beckoning me. All I can do now is call for help but this would be my 20th time and the nurses are busy I imagine they think I'm crazy but I know what I feel, and what Ive seen,  I. am. not. paranoid. You all are .....
