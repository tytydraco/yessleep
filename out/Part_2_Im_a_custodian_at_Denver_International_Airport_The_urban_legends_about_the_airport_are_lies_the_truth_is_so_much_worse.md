[Part 1 ](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/128vms0/im_a_custodian_at_denver_international_airport/)

I’m sorry it’s taken me so long to update, but I’m here now, and ready to tell you everything. To answer the obvious question, I’m still alive. As to why I didn’t update in so long, well, you’ll see when you read. A lot has happened, it may take me a few posts to catch you all up, but I’ll do my best. I’m on the move a lot - I’m writing this from a coffee shop - so I may post a bit irregularly, but I want to get this out to all of you, you all deserve to know.

After just barely escaping whoever was after me at the Denver airport, I went to a cockroach infested motel in Commerce City. The bed had so many stains I didn’t know what color it even was originally, but I felt relieved to be somewhere safe. I paid in cash and had trashed my cellphone before I got here, so despite the dinginess of the place, it felt like paradise.

I had only been in the motel for a few days, surviving off takeout and still trying to figure out what to do next when I was roused by a phone call on the motel phone. I was startled, but answered assuming it was the property manager or something else. Instead, I nearly had a heart attack when I heard my boss on the other end.

“Hey - I heard you had moved, and you didn’t come into work today, so I just wanted to call to make sure you were okay and were going to come in tomorrow - I’d hate to have to fire you. One of the maintenance guys told me you got into an area where they handle noxious chemicals, and seemed to have a freakout.”

I gulped hard, and tried to sound calm when I spoke back to him. “Of course, just a little under the weather today after, uh, having some hallucinations I guess yesterday.”

My boss replied very calmly, like he had heard all this before “Of course - you’re not the first one to have this happen - to be honest it’s really an OSHA violation probably, but what are you going to do, call the cops, what good would that do - for any of us?” With that he let out the most threatening belly laugh I’ve heard in my life.

“Of course not - I just want to get back to work.”

“Then we are all on the same page - tell you what, how about you take one more day to recover -it’s on us, after all, it sounds like your *hallucination* scared you half to death. I’ll see you day after tomorrow.”

He hung up before I could answer, less asking a question than making a statement. While the person I spoke to was definitely my boss, somehow the kind and jovial man who had hired me and seemed like everyone at work’s dad now had a hostile and threatening edge to everything he said. Did he really imply going to the police wouldn’t help, and that I’d be okay if I just returned and kept my mouth shut? I really wasn’t sure what to do, but the fact that my work knew where I was meant that the people who had tried to get me knew where I was too, so perhaps going to work again was the least dangerous thing all things considered. I waffled back and forth over the next day. Finally I decided: the least risky thing was to go in.

The morning I went back I boarded the same bus I had fled in a few days before. Going back to the airport felt surreal - everything that had been normal and comforting now felt threatening and strange. Walking into our staff room to get ready for the day my co-workers were socializing and joking around as normal. I caught a view of myself in the mirror, I looked pale and gaunt. I was startled out of my haze by my boss slapping me hard on the back “Hey! So glad you’re back and healthy! Why don’t we have a quick talk before you start work. Let's go to my office, okay?”

In my boss’ office there was another man - the man I had seen in a suit before in the weird room that lowered people into the floor. It took a lot of effort not to run right out of the room, but I sat down.

My boss sat at his desk and spoke first, “Let me introduce you to our colleague in maintenance - Chuck.”

Chuck nodded at me, “I’m so sorry if we startled you last week - we were just so worried after you were exposed to that gas you might be hallucinating - we wanted to get you medical care. Are you feeling better now?”

I nodded slowly. “Yes, I’m doing fine, I just - I want to make sure this won’t impact my um - “

“You getting to keep *doing* your job?” my boss helped me finish.

“Uh, yeah.”

“We know you posted about what you think you saw to reddit, but we want to make sure you know that was just a hallucination - not reality. As long as you can tell that difference, and avoid any further disparagement of the airport, I don’t think we’ll have any problems, and we can all go back to work as normal - and I don’t think you’ll have any problems continuing to do your job.” Chuck said calmly.

I nodded slowly, understanding what was both said and unsaid. “Sure. I hallucinated. No problem, I’ll just uh, try to avoid being in maintenance sections of the airport to avoid further…hallucinations.”

Chuck smiled broadly. “Great. I think we’re done here then.”

With that, we all shook hands, and I returned uneasily to my duties. I was terrified that they were just putting me into a false sense of security - and I was ill at ease for quite some time. After a few weeks though I began to believe that if I just kept my mouth shut and did my job, they'd leave me alone, and that seemed like a fair deal to me.

But now that I knew what was happening, I kept seeing more things. Every once in a while on the airport train, I’d see a train veer off in an odd direction, going to the maintenance platform I had gone to. Every once in a while, someone would ask me if I had seen someone that they had lost in the airport and I’d lie and say I had no idea where they went, and rationalize that maybe they were just lost not *lost*. I told myself even if it was horrible, it wasn’t my concern, I just had to stay alive. After a while, I just made my peace with it, saying it was rare and who really knew what was happening or why - it became like anything else you get exposed to day in and day out.

Everything changed a few weeks ago. My sister was flying in, and I’ll admit, I felt a bit of worry that somehow she would end up on the wrong airport train like I had. With this in mind, I had my dad drive the two of us to the airport to pick her up early, and I managed to use my staff credentials to get airside so I could meet her at the gate.

With each person coming off the plane, I kept telling myself she was coming, I just had to be patient. Finally I saw the flight attendants coming off the plane and my heart fell into my stomach, terrified that my refusal to talk about this had finally led to my punishment. I began pacing unsure of what to do now, only to see her come out of the gate joking around with the last flight attendant off the plane a few seconds later, apparently having made a new friend. I ran to her and hugged her, and we headed back to the terminal.

We got back to the terminal, and went out to the parking garage, only to realize that our father who had been waiting in the car was nowhere to be found. After asking around for a half hour, we found out he had gone into the terminal building to use the restroom, and then disappeared.

I sat quietly in the terminal, entirely shutdown, while the police, my mom, and my sister all tried to figure out where my dad was, while I knew all too well. I imagined him being lowered into that hole in the ground, screaming as he went down. Finally, the man my boss had called Chuck came out, and said they thought they may have found my dad wandering in a back corridor, and they’d bring him right up. My sister and mom were relieved that he was back, while I was just terrified at *what* would come back.

When the person who looked like my dad came out of one of the no entry doorways into the terminal, my sister and mother embraced him. I stared at him quietly as they hugged, and he shot me a confused glance of sadness that was only momentarily replaced with a malicious smile and a quick wink.

There’s much more to tell, but, I fear I just saw someone who looks like an old friend in this coffee shop, so I need to get the hell out of here. I promise to post again soon, but until then I’d suggest being careful if someone you know starts acting unusually after visiting the Denver airport - and whatever you do, make sure you aren’t alone [there](https://www.reddit.com/r/ByAbraxas/).
