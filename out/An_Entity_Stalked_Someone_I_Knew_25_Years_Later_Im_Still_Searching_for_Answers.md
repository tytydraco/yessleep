I had come home sometime in the fall of 2000 and noticed my mother was visibly upset. She did not outwardly express her distress. Instead, she stared at nothing in particular, completely stoic. And it was in her eyes that I could tell something very disturbing had clouded her mind, shook her to her core.

I approached her and asked her what was wrong, fearing that something may have happened to my dad or one of my brothers. 

She finally met my eyes and said, “Steve.” Her voice shuddered. It took me a few seconds to recall the name as I was relieved it was not my dad or brothers. I then asked her what had happened.

She took a moment and said, “Something terrible.” 

Before we proceed any further, I would like to take you back to June of 1999 because it was at this time that I met Steve. Unlike some kids at my high school, I had no summer job, so my mornings were open. But much to my dismay, I was assigned to drive my mother to work bright and early one day. She did make me feel better as she explained that I was not required to drive her all the way to work. I only had to drop her off at her friend May’s house a few blocks away. From there, Steve would be driving them to their workplace since he worked close by. As a sixteen-year-old at the time, I was selfishly delighted since that meant I could crawl back into bed.

It was on our way to May’s house that my mother told me about Steve. He is the eldest of four children – his parents had two daughters after he was born and then another son. Both of his parents worked long hours at low-paying jobs. Steve was more than happy to help out the family by contributing what he made from his job at a local garage. On top of that, Steve took excellent care of his siblings by adopting the role of a parent. He cooked, cleaned, and drove his siblings to school to ensure they got there safely. He was even able to make time for his long-time girlfriend. My mother also emphasized how popular he was among his many friends.

“He is the perfect son,” my mother concluded.

Admittedly, I rolled my eyes as I took this to be one of my mother’s ploys to make me act more responsibly as I entered adulthood.

We reached May’s house after a short drive. As we approached I could see May, Steve, and Steve’s girlfriend waiting for us by Steve’s car. A large smile creased my mother’s face as she saw Steve, which only annoyed me even more. 

“Come meet him,” she said through her big grin.

I exited my car intending to resent Steve. But surprisingly, all that changed when he introduced himself with a warm handshake and a big friendly smile. He congratulated me on completing the tenth grade. I looked up at him as he spoke and gauged him to be in his late twenties or early thirties. He was tall, good-looking, and well-built from his years of labour in the garage. I could tell he was someone who could take care of himself physically. Another thing apparent to me was the affection he and his girlfriend had for one another. He had one arm tenderly curled around her waist and her adoring gaze locked on him as he spoke. 

As I pulled away in my car with the thought of my warm bed waiting for me, I could not help but momentarily admire Steve. I mean, he got the looks, the girl, and the car. In the eyes of a teenage boy, it seemed he had everything. Tragically, that all changed beginning with one strange day a few months after my first and only meeting with him. 

One morning in the fall of 1999 I was in the kitchen enjoying my breakfast. My mother’s voice could be heard in the other room talking on the phone. Within earshot, I heard her mention Steve’s name. For a second I was taken back to the time when we had met. I heard my mother hang up the phone and shortly after she entered the kitchen. She appeared slightly off but I did not think too much of it at the time. Spurred on by hearing Steve’s name, I asked her how Steve was doing. 

“He’s…he’s not well,” she replied.

“How so?” I said, confused.

She gingerly pulled out a chair beside me and sat down. Then she recounted what she had heard from May.

In the previous evening, Steve did not come home for dinner. This was particularly odd since he was going to prepare dinner for his siblings. Concerned about his absence, his brother called him on his cell phone but was met with a voicemail greeting each time. By the time both of his parents had returned home from work, Steve was still missing. For hours the family waited. They were getting extremely anxious and worried that something horrible had happened to Steve. 

Then finally, the back entrance door swung open and there he was. A big sense of relief swept over the family, but that was short-lived as they quickly noticed that he was drenched from head to toe. It had been a clear day and that extended into the night without a drop of rain. Yet, here Steve was, completely soaked. He slowly stumbled into the kitchen, puddles forming at his feet. His father, Ralph reached out and gripped him by his shoulders and asked him what had happened and why was he soaking wet. Ralph’s voice was emphatic, almost demanding his son to tell him who had done this to him so he could do something about it. And it was Steve’s answer that left the family puzzled and frightened.

Steve revealed that for the past few days he had been seeing a woman wherever he went. He saw her at work, on the streets as he drove by in his car, at his girlfriend’s place—everywhere. He described her to be of average height, dressed in a flowing white robe which contrasted her long straight black hair that was parted in the middle. Behind the hair was a face that haunted him. She was “extremely ugly” he had described. She had dark eyes the size of small pills, giving her a sinister squint. And no matter which direction Steve had moved it seemed he could not escape her horrid stare. Her nose was pushed back with barely any cartilage to support it. It looked like that of a skull’s nose. Her face was long and gaunt and wrapped around it was a slab of stretched-out pale white skin. There was barely any flesh on her face that it seemed her jagged cheekbones would pierce through her skin with the slightest quiver. But what terrified him most was her long gaping mouth. It was twisted in such a way that it looked perpetually like a half-sobbing cry and half a grotesque grin. 

This woman, Steve said, appeared at his workplace and told him that she was madly in love with him and that they had to be together forever. Every fiber in his body commanded him to run, but for some reason he could not. Despite his horror at even the slightest glance at the woman, Steve said he was completely under her spell. Thus, he left his workplace and followed her on foot. With every step he wanted to turn back and run, but he just could not overcome the force that the woman had over him. With her leading the way, they walked a great distance until they reached a remote lake. Once there, a force flung him into the shallow water and held his head underwater. Steve’s limbs moved in every direction, thrashing at the waters. He wailed under the water and at the brink of drowning he somehow was able to free himself from the force. He picked himself up from the water and immediately scanned his surroundings. The woman was gone.

Steve spent the next hours walking home from the isolated lake.

The fear and sadness in my mom’s voice hung thick in the air around me as she told the story. “I can’t believe it,” she muttered.

“Me too,” I said. Growing up, my brothers and I were both fascinated and terrified by the supernatural. We were undoubtedly believers of spirits and the lot. So hearing this story confirmed my inkling that evil spirits are real. “He has to get some hel—“

“Steve looked so mentally healthy to me,” she said, cutting me off. 

“Wait. What?” I replied.

“He always looked fine to me and never acted in a way that made me question perhaps he was developing a mental condition,” she said.

I was feeling incredulous at this point. “You think there is something wrong with him mentally?”

My mother said, “Well, what else can it be? Steve’s parents certainly think so.”

I still could not believe what I was hearing. How could the guy I had met just months earlier, the same guy who took care of his entire family and had everything in his life so together suddenly be deemed mentally unfit? But that was the conclusion that was drawn. It was all chalked up to Steve having a mental episode. All I knew was that it did not feel right to me.

A few months passed without me hearing anything about Steve from my mother. My brothers and I had asked her about him in that time, but she refused to ask May about his well-being. This was mainly due to my mother not wanting to conjure up that frightful night as May had moved on from it. Also, Steve was a son that May was so proud of. She would gladly talk about her son amongst her friends and her admiration for him would radiate from her face. Now it was hard for her to talk about him in the same light since he had his supposed mental episode. Eventually, we just stopped asking my mother altogether.

Then one day in the winter of 1999, as if the months of normality were all too long, May and her family would be revisited by their hellish nightmare. It all began when May received a call from the police informing her to come to the hospital.

“Your son was in an accident,” the voice said. It did not provide any additional information.

Operating on the assumption that her son was in a bad automobile accident, May and her youngest son, William, raced to the hospital. As one could imagine, she was an emotional wreck when she arrived. Her heart was racing a mile a minute, fearing that she would not see her son alive again. Once there, William was able to track down a nurse who directed them to an emergency room doctor.

The doctor guided May into a chair before he began. “Your son,” he said softly and slowly, “he had a really bad fall.”

“Fall? What do you mean? What happened?” May asked frantically.

The doctor explained to her that a passerby had found Steve’s limp body at the site of a condo building under construction. It was an off day for the construction workers so no one was on site. The police believed that Steve had fallen multiple stories before landing on the dirt ground. The freezing cold had made the dirt ground very hard and unforgiving. Steve was alive, but unconscious when the passerby discovered him. He suffered multiple broken bones among his many serious injuries. 

It was not immediately known what had exactly happened and why Steve was even at the construction site. And with his range of injuries, which included a broken jaw in multiple places that required extensive wiring, it would stay that way for the coming days. 

My mother fought back tears when she described to me her visit to the hospital to see Steve. The mere sight of him struck her deep in her heart. He was a good-looking, physically fit young man in the prime of his life. And now he lay in a hospital bed, literally a broken version of his former self. In addition to his smashed jaw, he suffered breaks in his nose, collarbone, arm, and leg. The severity of his injuries was so great that the doctors did not believe he would make a full recovery. It was highly likely that he would walk with a limp for the rest of his life and not regain the full strength and mobility in his arm and upper torso. 

I remembered how much my mother had adored Steve so I could only imagine what May and her family were going through.

Several days had passed before my brothers and I asked our mother about the incident. I could tell by her face that she knew we would ask sooner or later. I had a feeling that she had known days earlier but was keeping it from us. This only confirmed my belief that it had something to do with the woman Steve had described earlier.

Then one day, she finally told us.

Steve had been doing well in the weeks immediately following the near-drowning incident according to May. He settled back into his regular schedule and acted as if nothing had happened. But just as soon as the talk of the woman had vanished, it all came roaring back. Steve would go on and on about the woman to his family. He could see her from afar with her eyes locked on him. And no matter where he went, he could not escape her presence.

“She would not leave me alone,” he would say.

But for whatever reason, be it simply not believing in what their son was claiming, having too much familial pride to admit their perfect son was not perfect anymore, fearing the stigma of having a mentally ill child, or Steve’s own stubbornness to receive treatment, May and Ralph did not seek any help of any kind for Steve. 

On the day of the fall, the woman had again approached Steve and professed her love for him. She reiterated that he belonged to her and that they had to be together for eternity. And just like before, no matter how much he had wanted to sprint in the opposite direction, his body betrayed him and followed the woman. This time she led him to a condo building in development, months from being complete. Like a puppet, his body moved under the control of someone or something else. She led him up the floors, and at every floor, she twisted her head back at him and flashed that hideous grin of hers. All Steve could see was the blackness of her mouth sloping down into the dark abyss of her throat. He followed her to the highest level constructed, which was a dangerously high distance from the ground level. Unfortunately, the workers had the day off and there was no one there to intervene. The woman led him to the ledge overlooking the city. She moved in close, inches from his face, and looked him right in the eyes. Pure sadistic joy oozed from her beady eyes. His entire body stiffened with fear. Then he felt a powerful force striking him from behind like being hit with an invisible wrecking ball. The last thing he remembered was plummeting straight down the building.

The fear in my mother’s voice was palpable as she told this to my brothers and me. She was shaking slightly and tried to hide it. To the shock of us all my mother then said, “What if he really is being haunted by a spirit?”

The hairs on my arms and neck stood up even straighter. Somehow the fact that my mother finally acknowledged the possibility of an evil spirit being behind Steve’s torment frightened me. All this time she had stood firmly on the belief that Steve was mentally ill. She was the counterweight to my brothers’ and my belief that an evil spirit was the root cause of all this. She was beginning to see things our way and it was unnerving. 

After the fall, Steve adjusted to life with physical handicaps the best he could, which was not any good at all. He required a crutch to walk and even with its support he walked with a noticeable limp. The loss of strength in his arm meant he could no longer return to work. I could only imagine how hard a pill it was to swallow for him. He was a man capable of so much and had achieved so much. His family had depended greatly on him. Now he depended on them. 

May had recounted to my mother a time when she dined out with Steve and his girlfriend. Steve struggled tremendously with feeding himself, though he was adamant on doing it without any help. He was able to use his better arm and hand to scoop up his food. But his mouth presented a problem. His jaw had been so badly damaged that after the wiring was removed, he could not open his mouth fully to receive his food. Food had smeared all over his face as he struggled to shove it into his own mouth. Feeling sorry for him, Steve’s girlfriend took over the task and helped guide the food into his mouth. Then chewing itself became a problem as his jowls did not line up straight as they once did. His mandibles came together crooked, unable to fully break down the food. This only made it harder for him to swallow.

The other diners in the restaurant stared incessantly at Steve as he ate. They were completely unaware of what they were doing and the disrespect they exuded without uttering a word. But Steve was well aware of all the eyes on him and the reason for it. Anger, humiliation, sadness, fear – these are some things I imagine Steve to be feeling at that moment. He dropped his utensils, wiped his mouth clean, and stopped eating. He stared straight down at nothing in particular for the rest of their time in the restaurant. May feared that he would soon crumble under the weight of the indignity he faced every single day.

May’s fear came to fruition as the “something terrible” my mother alluded to at the beginning of the story occurred on one tragic day in the fall of 2000.

It was late in the afternoon and the entire house was silent as everyone but William and Steve were out. William sat quietly in his room, studiously doing his homework. He welcomed the silence as it was difficult to focus on schoolwork at times with five other people in the house. The silence was ripped apart by a loud bang William later described to be a door slamming. When the sound registered in William’s brain his immediate thought was to check on his brother. He sprinted from his room and flew down the stairs to the basement where he knew Steve was. Steve was nowhere to be found. He was never seen or heard from again.

Steve’s popularity which my mother boasted about was evident during his vigil or memorial or whatever that was—a gathering of people to remember him, to keep the hope alive that he would return. A large turnout of young people joined Steve’s family. Many in the group mourned. My mother was one of many who was unable to contain herself and contributed to the wailing cries that enveloped the sombre gathering. The sadness felt on that day equalled the shock of a young man, in his prime, disappearing. 

I know at this juncture in the story there are a handful of readers who are confused by my submission of this story. To them, this story sounds nothing more than a man struggling with a burgeoning case of mental problems and then ultimately losing his mind. But to those readers, I offer a peculiar episode that happened shortly before Steve began seeing the woman who had haunted him. 

Steve had taken a trip to Thailand with a couple of his friends. One day, Steve suggested to his friends that they should visit a Buddhist temple. His friends considered this to be a bit odd given that not one of them was Buddhist, or religious, for that matter. However, they conceded that they wanted to experience the culture of the land. Shortly after they entered the temple, Steve’s behaviour changed. He appeared completely enamoured with the place. He became very quiet and stoic. He strolled the grounds as if he was familiar with the place, and started praying like a monk. This was very strange for a Westerner who had no previous exposure to Buddhist teachings. Things only got stranger after he returned home. He began talking to his family and close friends about praying with him. He often preached about how peaceful he felt during his time praying in the temple. May and Ralph found themselves to be very uncomfortable as they were not religious people and certainly did not raise their kids to be as such. This obsessive behaviour of Steve’s for his newfound passion was soon purged by the advent of the woman.

To this day, many are of the belief that Steve succumbed to his mental problems. This is the belief that his mind went off the rails.

But I ask, what if? What if Steve was right the whole time? What if there really was an evil spirit that longed for his soul? What if the woman was standing right in front of him, gleefully knowing that she would soon have him, as he stepped out of his house against his will? 

Because as soon as those people can ask themselves what if, they can begin to acknowledge that perhaps Steve’s dread and suffering was not so much the woman herself, but the fact that she was real, and no one believed him.
