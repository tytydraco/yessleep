I… Don't know why we went. We were dumb kids, the oldest one of us was 20, not even old enough to drink. Please, do not go outside the trails or designated camping areas in the Redwoods national park, no matter how cool you think it'll make you. It is not safe.

At around 12:35, Saturday, July 13th, 2023, me, 3 of my friends and my little brother arrived at our camping site. Well, not site, we were one of the many stupid people every year who don't camp on the designated camping sites.

There was my little brother, Jamey, who was only 16 and the youngest of us 5. He only came along because he begged me to. There was me, Jen, I was around 19 when this happened. There was my friend Krystal, she was the oldest of us at 20 years old. There was my other friend, Raj, he was 19, the same age as me. Then, finally, there was my cousin, Alexa, who was 17 when this happened.

We started unpacking all of our stuff, setting up the tents. Well, most of us did. My little brother has always been pretty lazy and antisocial, so he just sat on one of the lawn chairs and watched YouTube on his phone, from what I heard it was about dinosaurs. He was always a dino nerd. I always felt sympathetic for him. He was a good kid, if annoying and a bit of a snitch at times, he just had a hard time fitting in with other kids.

“So… Um… What's your guy’s favorite game?” Jamey says, trying to start a conversation with everyone else. I smiled. At least he was trying to socialize. “Oh, um… I'm kinda into the Sims.” Raj says, smiling at Jamey before going back to setting up one of the tents. Everyone else just ignored Jamey though. I helped Raj set up the tent, eventually getting it all set up. We found some strange, three toed footprints, 6 inches in length, although we all just dismissed it as some species of bird.

We started the fire around 7:00 PM, as the sun was just starting to go down. That's when things started getting strange. We heard a strange chitter, almost like a raccoon, but a bit deeper and more distorted. We all were a bit confused, before we saw it hop up onto a log. A small, bipedal creature, scaly, mostly black with a long, orange stripe running down its back, and dark blue markings around its beady black eyes, almost like a burglar's mask. It had a long neck, a small, lizard-like head, bird-like legs, 3 toed feet that fit the size and shape of the footprints we found earlier, and two little 3 fingered arms. It was small, only around 2 feet in height. All of us were too stunned to speak as the little creature chittered, its head tilting from side to side in curiosity.

“Is that a damn dinosaur?” Krystal said, breaking the silence. “I… I think so…” Alexa said, also shocked at seeing a living, breathing dinosaur. “Grallator!” We all heard Jamey shout with excitement, causing everyone but me to look surprised. “Uh… What the hell is a grall-” Krystal said, but was cut off as Jamey started speaking quickly, full of excitement. “It's a species of small carnivorous dinosaur, one of the few dinosaur species from California. But obviously, this thing shouldn't be here!” Jamey said.

Jamey ran up to the little grallator, causing it to jump back slightly from being startled by Jamey's sudden move. He reached out a hand towards it, as I tried to stop him, before the small dinosaur clamped its tiny jaws onto Jamey's finger tip. He let out a yelp, as I ran to help, kicking the grallator about 10 feet away. The little creature got up, growled at me and Jamey, before walking back off into the woods, its head bobbing like a chicken.

“Jamey, are you alright?” I said to Jamey with concern in my voice. “ Yeah… It just hurts like a bitch…” Jamey said, examining the small, bleeding bite on the tip of his pointer finger. Jamey then went to one of the tents, getting a bandage from one of the bags to put on his finger, while I sat down back at the fire.

“So what the hell do we do? Y'know, about the living dinosaur?” Raj said. “I… Don't know. I mean, it's tiny, so it's not like it could be that dangerous.” I said, taking a beer from the cooler we brought. Jamey stepped out of the tent, sitting down with us all. “Hey, um… Jen… Could I get one?” Jamey said. “What? No, you're only 16.” I said to Jamey, looking at him with slight annoyance. “I-If you don't give me one, I'll tell mom you were drinking.” Jamey said, causing the entire group to groan in annoyance. I grabbed a beer out of the cooler, tossing it across the fire to Jamey.

Then, we felt the ground rumble slightly, and a loud bellow, like a mix of a trumpet, a long dog bark, and a growl. We all froze with fear. I then got up, running to grab a hand gun and bear spray we had in the tent in case of bears.I pointed the gun at where the noise had come from, before a small little creature stumbled out of the brush, falling face first on the ground and letting out a high pitched, trumpet-like noise.

This thing was the size of a German shepherd, scared, its head was like that of a duck, with the bill to match. It had a long, thick, stiff tail, a small, horn-like structure on the top of its head. Its back legs were thick, muscular and digitigrade in structure, with three large toes, its front legs resembling arms, with small elephant feet at the end. Its coloring was mostly splotches of browns, blacks and greys, with small little freckles of dark green across its back and face.

It looked at us all, shaking with a small bit of fear as it saw us. Then, a much larger version, about 13 feet tall, this time with a mostly orange body, and a white tail with black stripes, its head crest a bright red. It gently nudged its baby to continue on, before both the baby and mother started to look… Irritated.

We heard a low hissing come from the woods like that of a crocodile. The mother faced where the hissing was coming from, but before she could even react, a large, green, brown and blood red splotched, komodo dragon-like head lunged from the darkness, grabbing onto the mother herbivore's neck. The mother let out a loud, trumpeting scream, as the baby began to run, before another large carnivore lunged out of the woods, clamping its jaws around the baby herbivore.

Krystal screamed, Raj looked like he was about to faint, Alexa looked terrified and got up to run, while me and Jamey just froze in terror. The second carnivore ripped apart the baby, leaving only a small, bloodied hind leg on the ground, before turning its attention to us all while the first carnivore snapped the mothers neck.

The thing looked at us with large, yellow eyes, its face slightly orange with the firelight. We all got up, as I grabbed Jamey's hand to get him to come with me. Krystal was still screaming her head off, causing the thing to go after her. It ran, catching up to her in two seconds, before clamping its jaws around her leg. It thrashed, causing her body to separate from her leg and go flying into the nearest tree.

Krystal let out weak whimpers, trying desperately to crawl away from this thing, before letting out a scream that was quickly cut off as one of the carnivores clamped its jaws around her upper body, cutting her in half at the waist. It tore her body away from her hips and remaining leg while me, Jamey, and Alexa were hiding behind the car, Raj running off into the woods.

We wondered where Raj had run to, before our question was answered. He was being chased back to the campsite by a smaller, mottled brown, baby version of the carnivores. It ran after him, letting out playful little chirps like that of a baby crocodile. The adult that was previously feeding on the herbivore caught Raj, using its jaws to break one of his legs, causing him to scream.

Raj crawled desperately to get away, before the baby hopped onto his back, biting onto the back of his neck and breaking Raj’s neck, killing him. “Jamey, what the fuck are those things!?” Alexa whispered to Jamey, her voice filled with terror. Jamey whispered, his voice trembling. “A-albertosaurus… They're a large therapod…” Jamey said.

Now that they had stopped moving around so much, I could finally get a good look at the albertosaurs. They were bipedal, with short, thick necks, large, horned heads that resembled that of a T rex, except with small horns above their eyes. They had short, 2 fingered arms, and large bodies with long, stiff tails. Their backs and the back of their necks were covered in alligator-like armored scales, their underbellies covered in snake-like scales.

The adults were both dark greens and browns, their underbellies tan, their backs and faces covered with blood red freckles, both adults were around 13 feet in height. What I thought was the male had blue and yellow markings around its mouth and arms, and a large scar along its left side that looked like it was from a bear.

The baby was mostly dark green, with dark brown splotches along its back, dark red splotches covering its face. Its eyes were also large and yellow, and it appeared to have a cleft lip, the right side of its top lip slightly split, revealing a large, slightly curved, spike-like tooth. The baby started feeding on Raj’s body, ripping at his back, tearing away the cloth of his clothes and ripping at the muscle of his back while the adults fed on the adult herbivore.

Me, Jamey and Alexa slowly got up, climbing into the car. I sat in the driver's seat, hands shaking as I turned the key in the ignition. The moment the key turned into the ignition, the heads of the albertosaurs snapped up towards the car. The adults just watched the car, but the baby ran up, jumping up towards the open window. It snapped at me, Jamey and Alexa through the open passenger window, causing me to spray bear spray into the baby albertosaurs face, causing it to fall to the ground, rubbing its face against the ground and trees to try and get rid of the burning in its eyes.

The male roared, as I pressed the gas to the floor, driving out of there as fast as possible. The male chased after us as the female helped the baby, tree branches scratching on the car. Alexa and Jamey were screaming for me to go faster, before we made it to the main road, the male albertosaur roaring as we drove off.

Even now, 2 years later as I write this in bed, I'm terrified. Especially now that I've started reading more sightings of large, reptilian creatures in the Californian redwoods, and that I've started seeing more disappearances near me. That's why I'm sharing this story, to warn you all. Please, for the love of God, stay on the designated trails and campsites, and do NOT investigate any footprints or roars in the Californian redwoods for your own safety.
