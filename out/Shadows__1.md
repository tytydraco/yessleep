My name is John Hawkins, and I’m a detective in a small town in Washington called Pawcrest. Now I don’t blame you if you haven’t heard that name before. We are just about as forgettable as you can imagine. If you’ve ever been here, we leave your mind quicker than a horse doing a sprint. I was stationed here after being a detective in a rather large city in New York Sate. I was looking to get away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life, and this small town was calling my name. 

I originally grew up in Washington but due to circumstances beyond my control, I had to move to New York. Anyway, enough about my life. Pawcrest is tucked away in a mountain range near the top of the state. It’s a quiet little suburban paradise where everyone knows everyone and you’re “never a stranger in Pawcrest.” It’s one of those towns that if you had a visitor, we would know almost immediately that you’re not from here . Its seems like gossip in this town flies faster that the falcons in New York. 

I work for the local sheriffs office in Pawcrest. We aren’t a very big station and only hold about 3-5 officers, the sheriff, and than me. I’m content with a work crew this small because frankly, nothing happens here. At least, that’s what I thought. It was a normal Saturday morning, the sun was just peeking over the mountains tops and radiating its light onto our little town. The mornings here are particularly cold so I decided to grab my jacket before leaving home. I had just stepped into the office when the phone started ringing. I was Mrs. Landis, the older woman that lived on Tanner lane.

Now something you should know about Mrs. Landis is that she may be old, but she’s as sharp as a tack. She’s smarter than my dog and I combined, but she is known to be a bit jumpy. She was concerned about something that had showed up on her doorstep overnight. Now normally, I wouldnt answers call like this being a detective and all, but when there’s no other officers on duty, I double as one. I hopped in a patrol car and made my way over to her residence. I approached her front door and knocked.
“Mrs. Landis” I said,” it’s John.”
The door swung open almost immediately, standing there was a white faced, very pale Mrs. Landis. 
She looked at me fearfully and said, “You have to come see this.”

I followed her through the house and out towards the back porch. She pointed at something just left of the back door. At first I couldn’t tell what I was looking at. Then hit me like a ton of bricks because I was looking at one of the local dogs skinned alive and gutted. I’m a seasoned detective but I’ve never seen anything like this before. 

To calm down Mrs. Landis I said “Unfortunately, a bear probably got to it or something. I’ll take take of the body but I’ll make sure that we are prepared for that possibil-.”

I stopped mid sentence. About 100 yards from the Landis residence was a rather large forest. In the tree line just barely visible was a shadow. So faint in fact that I wondered if what I was seeing was actually a shadow. I stared at for was felt like years when I started to suddenly feel a type of overwhelming dread come over me. It persisted until the shadow ducked behind the tree line and disappeared. At this point Mrs. Landis was looking at me with a puzzled look. 

“Is everything okay, John?” She asked.

“What? Oh, ye-yeah I’m okay.” I replied, unsure if I actually believed it. 

On the ride back to the station, I kept pondering about the overwhelming feeling I had just experienced. It’s something I’ve never felt in my whole career of being a detective. I drove in silence the rest of the way back. 

That night I had a dream that still sends shivers down my spine as I retell it. In my dream I woke up in the middle of the woods, surrounded by the corpses of skinned and gutted animals like the ones found at the Landis residence. I immediately stood up and started surveying the area. I was vastly unfamiliar with where in the forest I was. I ran for was seemed like an eternity before stopping to catch my breath. As I looked back up I noticed the same shadow I had seen at the Landis residence about 50 yards from where I was standing. 

It spoke to me in an almost guttural and animalistic manner, “You shouldn’t be here,” It growled, “Go home John.” How did it know my name?! I started running as fast as I could away from whatever this thing was. I heard the woods crashing behind me as it made chase. I tripped on a branch and awoke to find myself just outside of the tree line as the Landis house with no recollection of how I got here.
