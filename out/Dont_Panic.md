It was about 3 miles into my run when I noticed something was wrong.  The dense woods surrounding the trail - normally bustling with chirps, creaks and crunches - had gone piercingly quiet.   Streetlights from the distant townscape that so often provided a beacon home faded to black.  I felt a deep chill for the first time in months as the late August heat fell away minute by minute.  It was always quiet in these woods, but this was something different.  Silence.  I took a deep breath and whispered to myself, "Don't panic." 

Assess your options.  That's what dad would do.  My cell phone lay useless many miles back on my bedroom floor at mom's place on Woodbridge.  I always ran without it: dad always said it was best to simulate race day conditions in your training.  No cell phone, no music, nothing but the fresh air and animals on the trail to keep you company.  Yell for help?  Typically there would be boys fishing and young couples out with their dog along my route on evenings like this but I only realized now that I hadn't seen a soul tonight since veering onto the running path by Thompson bridge.  For the first time in my 17 years, I felt truly, distinctly alone. 

Keeping my breathing low and guarded, I slowly walked backward, the way I had three summers back when I stumbled between a brown bear and her cubs up in Maine.  Dad was still healthy then, his deep, reassuring voice calling me back to the campsite:  "Walk slow, sweet girl.  Make yourself look big.  Don't panic."  I made it back safe and sound then, but now my breath quickened as I felt pine needles jut into my back.

I spun around to find impenetrable woods where the running path had lay moments before.  There was no sign of the trail I knew so well, the same one dad had carved out during his track training 30 years before.  I turned to start the other way, only to find the path forward, too, had been suddenly swallowed up by three hundred year old spruce, maple and pine trees.  Surrounded, and with a gentle snow softly falling, a tear slid down my left cheek and I began to sob, crying for the first time since we lost dad at Christmas last year. 

There was so much I didn't know then, but I knew things would never be the same.  I'd never take the bus to school with my baby sister Dora for her first day of junior high, never muster up the courage to ask Chris out to the movies, never have another chance at Regionals.  I thought about all those things I looked forward to and how they were about to be taken from me.

That's when I saw him.  He was deep in the brush at first, but I knew from his strong, sturdy gait that it could be no one else. 

"Dad!"

 He smiled that wide, aw -shucks smile I knew so well.  Gone was the sick, trembling version of him I had watched helplessly fade away in his final months.  He looked younger than I'd ever known him now, like he had in his wedding photo on our mantel, with a full head of sandy brown hair and chiseled jawline.  All the questions, fear and apprehension I felt melted away as I saw him there, in the flesh, in front of me. 

"Gracie!" Dad bellowed, extending one hand toward me and one towards the woods.  "Everything is alright now, sweet girl.  Come with me.  You'll see." 

I started toward him, then hesitated.  He sounded...off, like he was doing an impression of himself. 

"Gracie," Dad said, in a tone I hadn't heard since I was a little girl.  "Aren't you going to give your Daddy a hug?" 

He patted his knees twice and extended his arms just like he used to.  Overcome, I ran toward him and we embraced, my head on his chest as he kissed me gently on the cheek just as he did all those years ago.  For a moment everything felt right: whatever all this was, dad would take care of things.  He always did. 

 Then I noticed the smell.  He smelled just like the roots and fallen leaves all around me.  His body was lean and muscular, but cold to the touch.  I wiped the cheek he had kissed and drew my fingers in front of my face: blood. 

"Gracie," He said, as his long arms extended out, connecting to the branches of the trees around us, the forest slowly closing in.  

"Don't panic."
