As I took a minute from my skull crushing routine, I made an attempt to stimulate my brain by taking in my surroundings. The at times sisyphean task of moving myself from the ironclad safety of my bedroom, before even the sun kisses the horizon, to a desolate room put me in a state of misery. The way the whole place rocked back and forth just felt like I was sitting on a buoy. The harrowing fluorescents cutting into the hallway to my office wasn’t any relief. The lights, which I'm very certain are the same used in interrogation rooms, seemed to glare at you as their overhead rays reflected right into the hospital white of the walls. My mother told me being a dentist would get me the cushy lifestyle I desired, but a few laps at the local pool coerced me into a job as an underwater researcher. I assumed that this job would involve sitting at home analyzing some odd squid caught by some gap-tooth fisherman. Instead, I wound up part of a covert underwater committee, whose facility is disguised as an offshore oil rig to weed out prying eyes. It sways no matter how many reinforced beams hold it up. Every day tests my resolve, challenging how long I can keep this position. **I hate it here**.

To provide a distraction from how “anything could be better than this” my work-life turned out, I began to get to *work*. In my inbox a classified message sat, differentiating itself with red bordering the subject line. My brow creased, and I began shooting out a million different possibilities on what this message could possibly entail. Without wasting any time, I spent a few moments looking at my rap sheet, just in case this message could mean I was getting fired–or maybe sued. Deciding to take my fate on the chest like a man, I opened the message with all the heart and bravery of a mouse.

*Hello,* 

*Just recovered all of team A’s written and video footage from the moment of surface tension breakage all the way to blackout.* 

*I've made a motion to relieve you from whatever current work you’ve been handling. This requires all your attention. Attached are the log files.* 

*Any deviation from course, or any rumor spreading and I will personally lay you out over the starboard.* 

*That is all.* 

*PS: If you take your usual slackers approach to this, and attempt day leaves because of “sea sickness” you will be denied. I am not a stranger to your methods, neither did I want to assign you to this project, but I lost by popular vote.* 

End Communication. 

A deep chill hit me harder than the blinding light of the desktop screen in my dim, steel, barely decorated office. My eyes, pressed close to the screen, fervently reread the short communication, a twinge of anger sprouted little by little when I glanced at the last passage. Yet, if my brows were not raised enough, they surely reached my hairline by the time I opened the log folder.

Yes, hello, name is Oliver Manstred 

No medical history 

5’11 ‘n 170 

Grizzled Nauftes veteran. 7th year. 

**9:30 am MST** 

We’ve reached 5000m, well beyond the reach of sunlight. 

The B23 appears to exceed its predicted depth capacity, a promising sign for future missions. The vessel has held its structural integrity, and crew performance meets expectations. Nothing in this ocean can hold us back. I intend to test out how deep we can traverse, and have looked over the contracts the crew members signed– no liabilities if anything goes wrong. Hoping for the best. 

However, there was an unsettling incident: Oliver Mansted, our hydrographic surveyor, reported a sighting of something he described as resembling “Cthulhu.” The crew took it seriously, but after further inspection revealed nothing, the mood shifted back into silence. Mansted’s credibility is now in question, and he faces isolation. \\\\

As we began to dock at Delta 1, an unidentified object crashed into one of the thrusters. The Technician assured me the damage was superficial. 

I intend to have a drone assess it during our stay at Delta 1.

**9:50 am MST**

The walk from the docking bay to the common room in Delta 1 was frigid. I will add a mental note to pack heavier next trip. 

After a few minutes of chit chatter and time to settle in the new space, I let the crew settle into their respective dorms. I then sent the drone out to scan B23. Results say 30% chance of catastrophe due to impact. I intend to push forward with those odds, and replace the technician as soon as we get back to the surface. Even if it takes the crew’s lifes, and mine, the report we will be sending back will be in its own league. 

I intend to get some rest now. 

**10:00 am MST - Audio transcript from Matthew Lancer** 

**Matthew:** Can’t believe that old man is making us sleep at 10. The damage that will do to my sleep schedule! 

\*Samantha laughs\* 

**Samantha**: oh shut up you, you’ve been napping anytime you’re not needed, which is a lot

**Matthew**: Not true

**Samantha**: I, for one, have been up since 8am, *yesterday*. 

**Matthew**: You mentioned something similar, I think when you dozed off on my arm. 

\*sound of a light smack\* 

**Samantha**: stop ruining the logs!

* **Audio over**     -

—--------------------------------------------------------------------

As Samantha’s voice echoed away in my head, I noticed a hyperlink to a separate pdf on the word Delta 1, and investigated it immediately. Due to a mountain of confidential remarks, the most I got was that Delta 1 is a deep sea permanent structure. It is small, for Nauftes standards, with just enough space for 16 individual dorm rooms, a kitchen, and a captain's quarters. A bead of sweat dripped down my forehead as I imagined living conditions underneath how many psi of pressure in such depths. Must be the first of its kind. 

—--------------------------------------------------------------------

**6:00 pm MST**

It is 1800, and we’ve reached a depth of 7600 m. Sonar scans tell me that there are tens of thousands more miles underneath us unexplored. I intend to sculpt my name into history. No matter what we discover down there, it will shake the scientific world for centuries. Abandoning current directives to study at 11,000 m, then returning to surface. However, we will still take samples at around 10,000 - 11,000 m.

I feel cold, and this cold makes me uneasy. It's as if frost is crawling inch by inch down my spine. I’ve spoken with the technician and he assures me temperature controls are functioning correctly. Despite this, the chill persists. 

**6:30 pm MST**

We’ve reached a depth of 10,000 m. I've let the researchers spend some time analyzing whichever it is they wanted to analyze. Early reports indicate groundbreaking findings. There seems to be a wide variety of unique fauna ripe for the picking. I’ve forwarded a notice to prepare a team for sample collection in the following weeks. 

**7:00 pm MST - Audio transcript from Oliver Mansted** 

 I heard Deen call us primitive under his breath. 

There is no doubt in my mind that guy should not have as many meetings with the captain as he does. 

For some reason, and god knows why, the crew doesn’t share my conerns

* **Audio over**     -

**8:00 pm MST**

Some innate fear almost led me to send the team back up at around 2000. Currently 11,000 m. The fauna observed is unlike anything previously documented.

The initial discomfort was momentarily forgotten. The researchers’ enthusiasm about the unique fauna was palpable, and it felt like a rare reprieve from my now constant unease.

However, each meter seemed to drill ice deep into my skull. 

**8:20 pm MST**

I’ve noticed that the crew's behavior is growing increasingly bothersome. The technician keeps fiddling with the equipment, and others seem distracted, staring at the monitors as if expecting them to reveal some grand secret. I don’t recall this kind of behavior during training. It’s odd but not entirely concerning. I may need to address it soon.

Aside from that, things are going smoothly. I am still fairly worried about that damaged thruster, but after so much time without much issue I believe everythings going to be just fine.

**8:30 pm MST**

We’re at 13,000 m, deeper than any man has ever traveled. The fauna at these depths are even more perplexing creatures. 

However, we've been alerted of an alarming anomaly. Oxygen levels have risen significantly 1000-2000m below us. There is something producing oxygen. Mansted found a little relief, as the crew began buzzing with interest. 

Usually, I would have commanded silence, but I shared a similar excitement. 

The chill persists, and It’s unnervingly dark, I never really took the time to notice. 

The rise in oxygen levels was not just a curiosity—it was a potential breakthrough. This suggested an unknown biological process at these extreme depths, and the implications for our understanding of life in the deep sea were monumental.

Why is no one else shuddering? 

**9:00 pm MST**

As we descended further, shadows seemed to dance just beyond the edge of my vision. I blinked, but they were still there, shifting and curling. I began entering my quarters with slight hesitation. 

I can no longer ignore the creak of the vessel. 

**9:00 pm MST - Audio transcript from Samantha Begardi**

\*sonar beeps faintly\*

**Samantha**: Jamieson seems a bit off edge, and I’ve spoken to Matthew, the technician, he just keeps getting the short end of the stick.

**Matthew**: He thinks it’s *my* fault for every sound he hears in this hunk of \^$&#! The guy won’t stop yelling at me every chance he gets. Actually, I would rather he yell than give me that stare of his. Ouff, just makes me want to pull his gray beard right off.

\*Samantha laughs\* 

**Samantha**: Keep it professional Matthew! This is an official log. Anyway, we’ve witnessed some insane species down here, it's like, like an alien planet or something. Not to mention oxygen readings are off the chart. Imagine there's a whale down here or something. 

\*a stifled laugh\*

Oh shut up Mansted.

* **Audio over**     -

**9:30 pm MST**

I have ordered the crew to slow travel down to 0.5m/s. I do not intend to miss anything or rush past potential findings. 

I have reprimanded the crew for speaking too often. Aswell, the biologist seems so content to be using his notebook as opposed to the perfectly fine electronic logbook. He has been reprimanded as well

**9:30 pm MST**

I can almost see the research papers with my name on it. This has become the most fruitful escapade yet, with only minor faults here and there

**9:40 pm MST** 

The deeper we go, the more I feel that we’re crossing a threshold that shouldn’t be crossed. The readings are showing something, but it’s not right. It’s like the ocean itself is moving, breathing. I don't think I can trust the data anymore.

**10:00 pm MST**

The crew has become increasingly suspicious. They give each other little glances when I assert my authority. 

This venture is becoming more bothermore than I thought. 

I’ve let them know we will have a mandatory rest period with the vessel on autopilot going 0.1m/s until 0830. Unbeknownst to them, I’ve disabled communication between them during this time. Before the technician went to his individual dorm, I informed him that when he wakes to cite lack of comms as an issue with the pressure gauge and that he will address it immediately. 

He was informed that any disclosure is a breach of contract.

I do not trust the technician. 

**10:15 pm MST - Audio transcript from Deen Casona**

My coworkers have reserved to their bed quarters. 

Against my better judgement, I’d say the captain is experiencing a shift in mental state, yet I can still accredit his symptoms as excitement from venturing into the unknown. 

The technician and the biologists budding romance has begun getting in the way of regular work, but at the moment they are both unneeded, so it’s of little concern. 

Although, I need Samantha to focus on her work more than I need the technician. Getting this new information could be very crucial. 

I wonder why comms are off, perhaps the frequency might cause problems? 

Nevertheless, as per contract, if the head captain loses his sanity, I step in as command. Which would mean *my* name plastered everywhere. 

Heard some of the crew have begun feeding his delusions… I’ll have to investigate that.

but I’m going to my bed quarters, I’ll let the captain deal with autopilot.  

Oh.. before I forgot. System reserve a 0800 meeting with the captain, flag as wellness check. 

Signing out at 2215

**8:45 am MST**

I couldn’t shake the feeling that they were hiding something from me, or that I was being watched. 

Has the technician exposed me? 

We are reaching 15,000 m, and ever so close to the source of oxygen production. This is a bound for the company. If I could ever find the words to express the greatness we hold in the palm of our hands. Sonar is enticing me, mysterious readings litter the radars. I am so close to uncovering the nest of something beautiful. It's as if a siren is pulling me in closer.  

It seems to be something alive! Something, somewhat, there is a presence in this deep and I will study it. 

**9:00 am MST**

We’re deeper than any man has ever traveled. it’s the feeling, the overwhelming sensation that something is terribly wrong. I see things now, shadows darting just out of sight,I can’t shake the sense that this is just the beginning of something far worse. The cold—god, the cold—it’s more than mental. It’s like it’s inside me, consuming me. I can’t trust the crew. I can’t trust anything. I don’t know how much longer I can hold on.

**9:15 am MST**

It's some monstrous presence. Dear god–it's beyond comprehension. I am not crazy, these are the crew's words. I will update the log with more information later.

**9:30 am MST**

I have disposed of the technician. 

He breached his contract.

I sent him inside a remote control drone under the guise of exploring an unknown light, then sent him into the gaping mouth of a large lifeform.

He breached his contract.

Even so, that puny man deserved all that was coming to him. He was always a weak link, a liability. Now, nothing stands in the way of greatness. We are on the brink of discovery—no sacrifice is too great.

Note:

The crew reports that the captain has destroyed the keyboard, unable to make electronic logs he resorted to a notebook, which is now lost forever. 

The following audio logs come from the crew, and are those deemed important to your investigation, over 300 logs have been vetted from this folder. They are available upon your request.

**9:40 am MST - Audio transcript from Samantha Begardi**

Matthew’s dead. I don’t mean to sound like such a stone hearted &(@#$, but I will not accept his death till I’ve left this god forsaken ship.

\*sob escapes Samantha’s Lips\*

I didn't even believe in god before this trip…But now… now I’m praying for something, anything, to get me out of here. God, or the devil, I don’t care anymore. Just get me off this ship…

**10:00 am MST - Audio transcript from Deen Casona**

We are doomed to hell. The captain has not washed, slept, or ate for 3 days and counting. 

Maybe that was my fault. 

\*sighs\*

If this is my last log, so be it. 

There is a presence about 1500m below us. A mysterious green light emits in the pitch black. 

I had the steady assumption the crew was overreacting, never been… too close to the whole lot anyway, and the readings we were receiving was just a form of dark oxygen. 

This is something inhuman, alien, otherworldly. Whatever other words can even come close to describing it. I know it doesn’t matter. We’re already dead. The B23’s just a coffin now, sinking into hell. And I’m the one who sealed it.

I will hide this information from the rest of the crew, but I've noticed we're beginning to be sucked in. I've turned off all navigational features of the B23.

If the likely scenario becomes the likely scenario, tell my wife I knew about her infidelity. I only took this trip to get enough money to keep the kids, and I wish to see her in hell with me.

 **10:30 am MST - Audio transcript from Oliver Mansted**

I have no clue whose more bonkers Samantha or Captain Pecunia. 

Deen theorized that the light is a gate, or something worse. “Whatever it is, it’s waiting for us. And we’re going to meet it. Maybe it’s better this way. No more lies, no more running.”

That guys )(\*\^#%@ nuts too. 

We are nearing the sea bed. There are Nauftes ships laying waste, emergency flood lights lighting each other up. 

There are maybe 30 or so ships with fronts ripped off, sides torn open, etcetera. 

Something prehistoric, everlasting, and intelligent is sitting at the bottom of the sea. Evolving so quickly it’s already begun luring in humans, and trapping them.

This is Nauftes doing. You all are idiots. 

You’ve given a monster the taste of blood. 

There’s at least four lifeforms down here. 

I know they drove Pecunia crazy.

I know because I heard one laugh through the rader. 

The green light is the size of a semi truck. 

And it multiplied.

It’s ever still and ever changing, ever moving. 

The green light is an eye.  

However it’s body may look, the darkness hides it. 

These bastards took me as a joke for trying to lighten the mood.

Now what?

\*A laugh echoes around the console, Oliver’s resolve falters\*

They’re… they’re not like anything we’ve ever seen. The eyes… God, those eyes—they see everything. Every thought, every fear. I swear they know what we’re thinking.

It knows I’m listening. Dear God it know’s I know. 

I should’ve never come here. Should’ve stayed home, where it was safe. God, what have we done? I… I can’t do this anymore.

I can't do this anymore

This is Captain Jamieson Pecunia. 

I am mere moments away from death.

I have been in a period of lucidity as soon as we lacked an escape method. 

I sent two fine men in an escape pod.

I watched two fine men be crushed by an outstanding pressure, and at these depths pressure the pod should've handled with ease.

After witnessing the impossible fate of the others on my ship, I've executed all remaining personnel and am ready to face the horrors of this world by myself.  

Godspeed.

—--------------------------------------------------------------------

My heart pumped to some imaginary beat, I could feel it drumming through my ears as I read through the last page of text; “Note: this was the only logbook we’ve ever retrieved from underwater missions. Team A had uploaded said log only seconds before destruction.” 

But if that chilling premonition wasn’t enough to get me to resign on the spot, the subsequent message made my heart drop to my stomach. 

“You will be instructed to investigate at the depths Team A ventured to deduce if the situation unraveled in the logs actually occurred, and were not a result of sea madness.” 

I stared blankly at the screen, everything around me seemed to slow. It felt like I was in a trance; I didn’t even realize how low my mouth was gaping. I squeezed my eyes tight and began to reason with myself. After a few deep breaths I managed to regain control, comparing my fear to watching a scary movie and getting timid even leaving your room in the dark. 

“You will be in a B25 modified for the venture. A crew of 5 will accompany you. You are familiar with most.” 

The days that followed were a blur of preparation. Gearing up, checking equipment, running body tests. All of it felt like I was on autopilot. My body was doing the work and I was viewing from a distance. 

Two days to exposition and I met up with the my crew. One man stood out to me. As soon as my eyes locked with the steely gaze of his, he gripped my hand and pulled me in for a hug. 

George Alexopolous was a giant of a man. If he didn’t tell you a million times he was mediterranean, his looks would give it away. A rugged man standing at 5’10, with hair laid along his forearms like skilled patchwork. His dark curls were kept slicked back. His beard full, and triangular, accentuated his chin. His eyes, described to me as “windows to the deep” by a rather drunk fisherwoman, were a mix of a rich brown, green, and blue. He had a strong face. High cheekbones, and a sharp, angular nose. He looked formidable yet comforting. 

George was a classmate of mine, and I owe him a for helping me come out my shell a bit. I exchanged formalities with the ship tech and hydrographic guy —one fat and stubby, the second long and lanky. I recognized the pair as the be two men who showed me the ropes when I had been an intern at the company. 

The Captain and his second-in-command… I’ve already forgotten their names. A deep innate thorn plotted silently in the back of my mind. I could never be ready for what’s to come, nor could I shake my feelings of growing unease. 

The descent began in darkness so complete that it felt as though the ocean had swallowed us whole. At 3,000 meters, we passed through the mesopelagic zone, where the last remnants of sunlight died, leaving us in a twilight that barely touched the face of the submersible. The vessel's lights cut through the dark, revealing flashes of strange, pale creatures drifting in the water like ghosts. George was at the helm, his massive hands steady on the controls, eyes locked on the instruments with a focus akin to a monk. 

By 6,000 meters, The air inside was thick with tension. I was silent, my eyes flicking nervously between the radar screens and the reinforced glass windows. The deeper we went, the more I could sense the ocean’s hunger, it knew we didn’t belong.

At 8,000 meters, George broke the silence. “Remember the trench dives during training?” His voice was calm, but I could see the tightness in his jaw. “This isn’t like that. Down here, it’s not just the water that gets to you.” He didn’t elaborate, but he didn’t need to. I could tell he mirrored my feelings from the start of the voyage. Though, I don’t know how informed he was on the nature of the journey. 

When we finally reached 10,000 meters, the abyss had fully claimed us. The lights on the sub revealed nothing but an endless void. The ocean floor was still hundreds of meters below, an unseen maw waiting to swallow us whole. I glanced at the others. The tech guy was sweating, his hands trembling as he tapped at his console. The hydrographer’s face was pale, eyes wide as he stared at the readings. The Captain and his second-in-command were as unreadable as ever, but I could see the tight grip on their armrests, the way their eyes flickered with worry. 

And George—George was staring out into the black, his eyes distant, as if he were already somewhere else.

The B25 was a smaller ship than the B23, but the organization was similar. The cockpit held enough room for the 6 of us to man our stations, with the captain and the second in command to sit in the middle, overviewing it all. A few meters behind them, the door to the dormitories sat. 6 rooms sat across from each other, 3 on each side. The entrance to the ship was above, in the centre of the dorm hallway, and the back was reserved for the components and whatever else powered the ship. That was the technicians domain. Captain’s usually confine themselves to their dorm equipped with a control module, but ours had been unusually present in the cockpit. 

Suddenly, the Captain spoke, “as soon as we hit 13,000 m, I want you to kill me”, he paused, surveying the confused faces around him , “I took this position voluntarily and I was informed of the risks”. The cockpit of the ship fell silent, the atmosphere felt like the calm before the storm. 

 I began to speculate— could this be a precaution to avoid the mistakes of team As management, or a last minute decision driven by something else?

The hour and thirty minutes alone with my thoughts was enough to make a man rip his hair out. Nobody in the cockpit was making any attempt at dialogue. My coworkers understood the danger; they knew of team As fate. I was certain a few of them were aware of the other 30 teams that either met their end at the seabed, or had been brought down from above. 

It began to dawn on me. These men were all familiar with the Captain, they had followed him through countless missions. The more uncomfortable side glances I got, the clearer it became: I was the one tasked with the responsibility. 

Sooner than I had wished, the depth metre read out 13,000. I felt a firm grasp land on my shoulders, and a man, whose lived longer than his years handed me a polished blade, the gold handle adorned with a multitude of jewels.

As I walked him to his dorm, out the handleless door of the cockpit, I saw a strong man lose his resolve. His movements became erratic, his eyes opened wide. It seemed to me whatever was going on, it mirrored the events that unfolded during the tragedy of team A

And that terrified me. It terrified me more than any dread I felt reading the logs. It meant I wasn’t reading a story of fiction, it meant all doubt from my mind had vanished. I was truly in real danger. 

I laid the man on his bed, and tried not to think about it. Perhaps muscle memory, or maybe the stress of the whole thing, but killing the man was the easiest part of the whole ordeal. I walked slowly back to the cockpit, letting the echo of my steps provide some small comfort, my face buried in regret. The ship felt eerily lonely, even with the five other crew members onboard. 

I had hoped the darkness of the void behind the glass to be my sanctuary, but the only thing that filled my senses, apart from the creak of the hull, was a green light getting brighter by the meter. 

Without any warning, the hull flashed red. Not thinking, I clutched my chest. “It’s not over for you yet” echoed in my head. in the panic, I couldn’t discern whether it was my own thoughts. Sirens sang around me and every man was absorbed in their own pressing matters. 

I felt a heavy hand on my shoulder, jolting me from my panic. George turned away from his module and looked at me with a steady and calm gaze. 

“Hey,” he said softly, his voice barely rising above the din of the alarms, “breathe.”

He reached out and gripped my arm firmly. “We’re in this together. Whatever happens, remember that.”

In that moment, his words felt like a lifeline. The weight of my dread eased just a little, and though the green light continued its ominous dance, I took comfort in knowing I wasn’t alone in this descent into the abyss.

Then suddenly, the water came to rest, the blaring of the emergency features faded, and I was gazing into infinity. The silence replaced all else. An unfathomable expanse, a vast infinity that seemed to breathe with a rhythm all its own. The darkness outside shifted and shimmered as if the very fabric of reality was in flux.

 In the endless void, I glimpsed shapes that defied description—scales that gleamed, fur that flowed, and skin that creased in an ever-changing mosaic. In the blink of an eye, I saw an array of eyes—two, then three, and then an infinite multitude that seemed to watch and judge, all while remaining still.

And it spoke. 

It spoke to me without speaking. 

"Do not try and hide your thoughts from me," the voice echoed within my mind, reverberating through the void. "I am well aware of your repugnant transgressions. You will be judged, and this is the final court."

And I was given a choice. 

I felt the unbearable pressure of the decision that lay before me: save myself or save the men. The enormity of the decision loomed, a moral crucible brought to me by the unknown.

The ultimatum pressed upon me with a weight of unspoken judgments and cosmic authority. The eyes—so many eyes—seemed to watch and weigh every fragment of my being, as if the very essence of my soul was laid bare before them. The abyss demanded a choice, a sacrifice, and the gravity of the moment felt as if it could tear me apart.

So I faced my fate with steely resolve. I resolved to sacrifice myself; my life was not worth more than theirs—a single soul overshadowed by five. I had already taken one life; how could I bear to cause more funerals?

Or— that’s what I wish I did. 

Truthfully, in that moment, the guilt receded. My sins, exposed and vulnerable, granted me a perverse freedom. I had extinguished the lives of a man and a woman for my own gain what felt like a millennia ago, and now I faced the consequences of that choice. I had done it once, and, God help me, I would make that choice again.

And George knew, and the men knew. My punisher was not so kind to keep my thoughts to myself. 

He screamed—I saw him scream. Though I couldn’t hear it, his eyes clenched in silent agony, and the words “my daughter” formed on his lips without sound. Before I could grasp what had happened, I was abruptly on the surface.

To the great surprise of those I did not recognize. 

From a witness account, I dragged myself up through the steel of the mess hall, as if it was a lake of water. 

Then, I passed out. 

As a slave still bears his scars, mine were ever-present. When I looked into the mirror, my once brown eyes were a murky green. 

Ah, this is going to be one hell of a report.
