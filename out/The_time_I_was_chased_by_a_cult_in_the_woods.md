This happened three years ago, and I still check over my shoulder when I hear twigs snap. I know how cliché that sounds, but after what I went through, you’d be paranoid too.

  


I had just turned 21. Me and my buddy Greg decided to do a camping trip before college started again in the fall. We wanted real isolation—none of that KOA family campground crap. So Greg found a spot online, deep in the Appalachian woods, supposedly abandoned state land. No rangers, no trails, no other people. Perfect, right?

  


Wrong.

  


We hiked out about six miles from the gravel access road, where the trees get so thick the sun barely touches the forest floor. We set up camp near a creek, cooked some beans, smoked a little, and called it a night. At around 1 a.m., I woke up needing to piss. I grabbed my flashlight, stepped out of the tent—and froze.

  


There was someone standing across the creek.

  


They were just… watching. Not moving. Wearing what looked like a robe made of animal hides and branches tied into their hair. My flashlight flickered (not kidding, like in a damn horror movie), and by the time it steadied, the figure was gone.

  


I chalked it up to being high and half-asleep. I didn’t tell Greg. I should have.

  


The next day, we found weird things near our camp. Strings of bones tied to branches above us, like wind chimes. Circles of ash. A dead raccoon hanging from a noose made of vines, its body gutted and stuffed with leaves.

  


Greg wanted to leave. I said it was just some twisted survivalist or a sick local screwing with us. I was so stupid.

  


That night, we heard the chanting.

  


Low and rhythmic, like a dozen voices all speaking the same language that wasn’t English. It echoed through the trees, getting closer. We turned off our fire, hid in our tent, and waited, barely breathing. At some point, I peeked out.

  


There were people surrounding our campsite.

  


They held torches. They wore robes. Their faces were covered in what looked like bark or bone masks, painted red. They didn’t speak or move. Just stood in a circle, facing us.

  


Then the whispering started.

  


Voices in the woods, in our ears, inside our damn heads. “He who walks beneath roots… he sees you. He sees you.” Over and over.

  


I grabbed my backpack and whispered to Greg that we had to run. Now.

  


We bolted out the back of the tent and ran through the trees, no flashlights, just the moon filtering through the branches. Behind us, I could hear movement—cracking twigs, snapping brush, and those voices, chanting louder and faster.

  


Greg tripped. I swear I went back for him, but he screamed at me to keep going. “I’ll catch up!” he yelled.

  


I never saw him again.

  


I ran until sunrise. I found a ranger station ten miles away, pounded on the door sobbing like a child. They thought I was high or delusional, but they sent a search party anyway.

  


They found our campsite. Torn apart. Blood on the ground. But no Greg. No raccoon. No bones. No robes. No masks. Nothing.

  


The official story is that a bear attacked us, and Greg “wandered off, possibly injured.”

  


I know better.

  


Sometimes I still hear the whispering in my dreams.

  


And last week, I got a letter in the mail. No return address. Inside was a small twig tied with twine, and a note written in charcoal on bark.

  


He who walks beneath roots has not forgotten you.

  


I moved last night.

  


But somehow… I don’t think I moved far enough.
