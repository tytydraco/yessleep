It's the first time I'm speaking for a long while, I'm so unsure how to start. I guess an introduction might be in order. My name is C36, at least that's what my skin says.  
I grew up in a little home with my single mother, who was so beloved by men that she would bring home a new man or two a day. She called me her little doll, and made me entertain the men once they were done with her, sometimes the men just came to share their love with me. While she was watching they slid their hands across my leg, to my crotch. Sometimes they would even stay in my bed for the night.  
Whenever I misbehaved my mom would scream at me, and throw me inside the closet. I spent many hours there, I was told not to speak unless spoken to, otherwise I would go without food for days. But I really came to miss my time with her, she usually treated me nice and fed me such good meals, I just had to behave and please the men, then I would avoid getting a beating. 

One day, she sent me with a well dressed man in a black suit with white gloves. She told me that he would be my dad, and from now on, I would have to behave and follow his orders.  
I have never been allowed to leave our home, so all I had seen was through the porthole in the attic, which made this such a nice trip.  
I sat on a plastic cover as we drove out of the city, then dad handed me a blindfold, I was told only to remove it when he said so. I behaved nicely, and removed it to leave the car, just as ordered. Dad had brought me to an isolated white house, hidden away by corn fields. I was told to put the blindfold on the ground so he wouldn't have to touch me. 

The white house worked as a welcome center. After getting there I was taken underground through a hallway with lots of smaller rooms. I was led into an indoor playground where some children played with toys. We were fed some good meals throughout the days as the Doctor would come by to do a regular health check and give us vaccines. As more children arrived, Garry and Larry the two caretakers told us that once we were enough, we would be given new names. They called it the big Naming day.  
I thought them to be nice adults who looked after us. From the Doctor who walked around in a white lab coat who only cared for our health, to the tall Janitor who stood for keeping the building warm by burning timber, but ended up cleaning us and the cells by spraying us down with the same hose. If anyone misbehaved or layed stone cold, the Janitor would also take care of that.

The Naming day had approached so I Larry took me to a small room, where Garry waited, the smell of shit mixed with burned flesh hung in the air as a heavy curtain. I stopped for a moment when I got a whiff of the smell, so Larry lifted me up and threw me to the ground next to the fire, the fire crackled and popped as it heated a piece of metal. Then he slammed down a knee in my back. It sent a pulsing pain to my guts which left me without air, forcing me to gasp. I inhaled the thick air, a metallic taste mixed with rotten eggs filled my mouth. Gary gave me a joyful look as he stuffed my mouth with a piece of wood, he then went to pick up a knife, and started to strip me naked by cutting off my clothes. As the knife sliced through the fabric it left behind a trail along my body, the more I squirmed and moved around, the deeper the cuts were left behind. Whenever I tried to scream Larry would slap me and shout “SHUT IT”.  
Once I was buttnaked only covered by blood leaking from the cuts and shit from the floor, Larry would turn me around, pressing his knee on my thighs. Gary picked up my bloody clothes and threw them into the fire, then he went for the branding Iron that had been heated up since before we entered the room. He then stood on my hands and said “Do not fear little one, for I have redeemed you, thy name will be C36”, he pressed the Iron with the letter **C** onto my stomach. For a second I felt nothing, but as the sound sizzled and the smell of burned flesh intensified, it all thumped through my body. I passed out in blood and shit of my own.

What woke me up was a Doctor spraying me clean with a garden hose. The water was ice cold, I looked down and saw that **36** had been added to my stomach. I was inside a cell, my very own cell, and next to me layed a johnny gown. I only know that, since the doctor called it so as I was told to put it on. When the doctor left, the little window on my cell door got locked, leaving me Isolated, in darkness.  
But this cell was way bigger than the closet at home, I could feel the mattress on the ground, and If I just bent my knees a little I could lay down on it, so I was pretty happy, I never had my own room.

I wasn't punished as long as I behaved well, and for the most part I did what the Doctors asked, mom had raised me well. I could hear that the one who lived next to me, didn’t behave, so Larry would come in, and fix that issue. Depending on his mood the punishment could vary from being beaten, to shackled up on a chair wearing a thigh hood for hours. Worst was when we got chained to the floor, our arms and legs tied behind our backs with a sack of straw over our heads, he then proceeded to piss all over the sack and left us like that till the next morning.

I found my first friend here, we didn't talk, but I like to think she was a friend, her name was D17. She was a pretty funny girl, she kept yelling “MY NAME IS SOPHIA” I have never heard something like that before, she was funny making up names like that. But she couldn't fool the Doctor who knew her name, it was written on her stomach after all. So Larry would teach her some manners, I know that, for a shrill piercing cry came echoing from her cell. She would often be visited by him alone, and loud banging against the wall would be heard. She talked and shouted a lot, and answered her own questions while changing her voice, each time Larry would come by to silent her.

The food here was so bad, Gary was no good cook, he was bad at serving the food as well, he would open the window in the cell door to put through a scoop of hot gray slop, just to dumb it on the ground. I had not held any utensils since I lived with mom, so once it had cooled down on the ground, I would pick it up with my hands to eat.

I lost time, there was no daylight in the cell, so everything turned into one, the only light I got was from the doctor's visit and when the food was served.Gary never fed us systemically, and the Doctor would come irregularly. I could be fed many times before I got a visit, other times he would come between my meals.

Back when the Doctor pathed me up after the big naming day. I was told that my skin was too soft, so an unknown substance was forced into me. That was done by a long syringe, with a blue goop which illuminated the room. The Doctor started to press the long needle into the skin underneath my fingernail, forcing a gap as the needle sloshed around. Larry stood next to me, holding me by my hair, ready to strike a punch if I so much as tried to move, so I got beaten up real good. Each time the Doctor would scream at me, and start over on my next finger.  
Once the Doctor and Larry left, the fingernails still left behind were about to fall off, each one of them, while my widow’s peak had been tugged uncentered, only the smallest patches of hair were left behind.

D17 tried to flee, I'm not sure what she did, but I never saw Lary again.   
I heard a struggle happen as he went on his sole visit. So I tried to get a grasp of the situation, by crawling up to the door and putting my ear to it, but an alarm had been activated. Between the sounds from the alarm, I heard iron being waved around, which all ended with a loud “thud”. I was still leaning up against the door as the window to my door suddenly opened.  
I wish I hadn't peeked out, as I only got a glimpse of the Janitor who passed by with her separated head. The Doctor had started to spray a thick hazel colored gas into my cell. The gas hit me directly in the eyes leaving them bloodshot, and a mixture of fuss, blood and tears ran down. I was unable to do anything but cough, It felt as if my lungs would pop out at any second.I stormed to the corner of my little confinement, sitting with my blanket covering my body facing against the wall, as blood rolled down my cheeks, I grasped for air.

My eyes never really recovered from that incident, everything was a blurry mess. I could barely see a thing, the only thing left was a sharp image left of D17's separated head.   
I couldn't eat for the image that had burned into my eyes, when Gary noticed, he kicked me to the wall, forced my jaw open with a pear shaped metal object and poured down a burning hot slop into my throat. A sharp searing pain spread though my body as the slop crawled from my mouth to my stomach. He would usually just laugh at me, and let the food lay on the floor till I had eaten, but after the escape attempt, the atmosphere changed.

The Doctor had come by more regularly to do the health check ups, but instead of Jerry, the Janitor towered above me, the sheer pressure alone kept me still. I failed the test.The health check up was never a test you could fail. The Doctor started the test by taking blood samples and handed them to Gary. Then the Doctor showed me pictures asking me to identify things, it was discovered that my eyesight had been damaged.  
I didn't even know that I had to identify something, it was all new. Everything had changed, if I had known about it beforehand, if I was told about it, if I had tried it before, even if I had seen it before I might have memorized it. The Doctor now asked me to do all sorts of movements. Afterwards the Doctor leaned in to my chest, asking me to breathe.  
Gary would come back handing the Doctor some paper. The Doctor looked up from the paper and faced the Janitor “C36 is a failure, there’s no need for a dissection, do what you want with that piece of timber, I have no reason to spend more time on it”.  
An unease came over me as I could feel the piercing gaze of the Janitor seized me up asserting me as a prey, my fight-or-flight response heightened making me want to run like D17, the picture of her head resurfaced in my mind. So I did my best, stood still and closed my eyes. I knew that if I just behaved well I wouldn't be punished.

The Janitor Had knocked me out cold, I woke up stuffed into a cage.The cage was hanging from a leaky ceiling, the air had a thick putrid, rancid miasma of rot leaving off a taste in my mouth with hints of ammonia and metallic tang. From the corners of the room I could hear maggots squirming around, moving or feasting on the decaying matter, leaving a wet sound of moist rustling and wriggling that rang to my ears. It left me nauseated, I puked, but the cage had left me trapped, the constricting area left me unable to move and stretch, so the puke ran down my body.  
I had no sense of time, I was left alone in this dark place, I was exiled and the world was empty. I was trapped in a position that left my muscle cramped up. I tried to push my legs out of the cage, but they couldn't go through the bars. I tried to maneuver and twist my body, but the space restricted my very movements. I tried shifting my weight pressing my whole body against the bars which left me with just enough space, to barely get my arm that was trapped behind my back to the front.  
I was somewhat standing hunched over, I couldn't sit down as my legs took away the space underneath me, and the cage was not tall enough to stand up, all the movements had left the cage swinging.

Water ran from the ceiling down the rusty chain, as irregular drips landed on me. It was my only source of water, it had a metallic taste. When it rained outside, I would wake up to the tinkling and clinking sound, and the splashing noise that came from the water as it traversed down the rusty surface to drip in my face.

I got thinner by the day, so my legs had started to slide through the bars. It had been such a long time since I was left here without food, a sensational emptiness was left in my stomach.  
As my legs hung from the cage, a rough scraping sensation came, as a warm wet tongue started to make contact with my foot, licking it up and down. My limbs had gone stiff from being trapped, and I had no energy to move. I had only believed it to be maggots, but it was something else, something bigger that nested here.
