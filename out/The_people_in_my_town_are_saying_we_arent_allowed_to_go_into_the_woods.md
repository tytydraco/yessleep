I had recently moved into a new neighborhood, it was quaint and homey, everyone knew each other and were really friendly. That's what drew me to the community, they were super welcoming when I moved in, the neighbors bringing over welcoming baskets filled with their "award-winning" baked goods. I immediately fell in love with the town, the small town live was growing on me more and more as I had gotten acquainted with the fellow residents.

"Hello Gale!" I called from my place on the sidewalk as I was taking my morning walk. "Oh hey dear! Glad to see someone else out enjoying the nice weather." Gale was like the grandma of the neighborhood, she was a little old lady who was often outside tending to her flowers and makeshift garden. "Yes ma'am, I'm just about to take a hike through the trails in the Glades. Glades was the name of the towns' park and woods recreational area, it was most known for the beautiful nature and ponds that housed all of the wildlife that drew people to feed the ducks in the pond and the occasional birdwatcher. "Okay dear, just stay out of them woods, you know the rules of course." I slowed my pace, "What rules are there that I can't hike?" "Oh you know, you can't go in those woods, it's not safe, the trails have been closed since I was a little girl." She broke eye contact with me, fussing with her flowers when she noticed that some had started to wilt.

I hadn't known that the trails had been closed, I could've sworn I heard some of the men in town who brought in the lumber saying that the woods were looking cleaner than the last time.

I started back on my walk, I thought it was worth checking out, Gale barely left her own yard anymore, she was scared of driving. I was scared watching her myself when I saw her get behind a wheel. The woods looked welcoming as I approached them, but I did see a no trespassing sign as I got near. I was about to turn around when I saw a flash through the thick bushes that provided a cover from the tree line. I startled. I squinted my eyes to try to see what kind of animal caused such a huge crashing sound as it raced through the thicket. That's when I heard it, what caused a chill to creep the full length of my spine.

"Leave town" a childlike whisper came from the bush, "Get out of here," another seemed to call from the dense woods I had just seen thrash. I called out, "What are you doing playing in the woods, you are going to get a tick", I tried to laugh off the uncomfortable feeling that was starting to dawn on me. "The woods aren't safe, the lumber man" a voice called in a sobbing cry that sounded like a little girl. "It was supposed to be a rumor, a scary story!" a boy's voice cried. "Please, over here" the call came again slightly more muffled and sounding like an older man trying to disguise his voice as a child. I backed away, getting way more creeped out now that I heard a slight waver in the voice. "Um, I'm going to go, that's not funny by the way I thought you were lost!"

I started to turn away when, up above in the trees, I spotted a small shoe dangling from the branches. My face drained as I glanced backward and debated how long it would take to run back to my house, I had walked all evening to get to the park, it.was now starting to dim to dusk and I knew I had to leave now while I still had some daylight to navigate my way home.

I turned and saw a line of children entering into the Glades, they seemed to be ushered by an older man, wearing lumber gear. I approached and as I got closer I heard him say, "some people say if you are quiet enough you are able to hear whispering coming from the bushes, so be extra careful to not make any noise until we make it to the lake house.

There was no lake any where near our small town. We lived in a farming community in which we had surrounding fields and bigger corporations miles out of town. I felt my heart drop as I raced after the kids into the woods, I found that there was a warehouse after following an array of footsteps, all appeared to be a child's footprint. My stomach churned, I realized that I hadn't seen a lot of kids around town in the time that I resided there.

I chalked it up to the residents being a little older and may have kids that no longer lived with them, but we still had a daycare in the outskirts of town. I peered in the window of the warehouse and saw the lumber man start to peel off his hair, followed by his skin. The kids who were promised a lake day started to look at each other, their smiles wavering, many having their jaws drop into a grotesque gaping maw as the seemed to watch the man, transfixed. The mans lips seemed to be moving, as if he were speaking at a rapid pace. I couldn't overhear any of the whispered muttering of the seemingly deranged encounter.

The lumber man turned toward the window, causing me to duck and run off. I bolted my way home, urgently trying to get to a phone so that I could alert the authorities to what was obviously a sick and twisted show that the man was putting on the susceptible children who didn't understand what the situation was. When I reached the phone and dialed the police, I told them about all I saw that occurred in the woods.

The police sighed and whispered down the line, "It was supposed to be a rumor, a scary story."
