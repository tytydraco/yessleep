Anyhow, I told a few of my friends about the phone incident. I thought, weird story, people probably would find it interesting.

&#x200B;

They were horrified. 

&#x200B;

Looking back, yeah, I should have been more freaked out, but it didn't seem like a big deal. My friends insisted that I should at least ask the apartment management about cameras and check for any intruders or signs of break-ins.

&#x200B;

Well, there weren't. There were camera views of people using the elevator and the day of the incident, only my neighbors and I were seen to enter our floor. As for break-ins, I was in the seventh floor, unless they left through the windows both time, very unlikely. 

&#x200B;

There was a small balcony at the living room, but I rarely went out there. It overlooked a busy road and was always pretty noisy, so I usually kept the glass doors shut, with the curtains drawn for good measure. I remember when I checked the glass door, it was even locked up. There was a pot of dried up dirt that probably had a plant at one time, but that was already there before I moved in.

&#x200B;

Moving into my fifth month, I had started to become more friendly with my neighbors. They were standoffish at first due to my weird work schedule and the fact that I'd always have different friends in and out. As they were a young couple with 2 toddlers, they were a tiny bit worried. But by then, they realized that we weren't as loud as they feared and were generally well behaved.

&#x200B;

One weekend, the Missus knocked on my door all apologetic, and asked if I were be willing to look after the kids for the afternoon cause she had a sudden errand to run. She promised that the kids would be easy as it was time for their afternoon nap and I was free to use their TV and eat some snacks over at their place. 

&#x200B;

Of course I helped out. By then, I wasn't as tired anymore and didn't need to sleep so much. As I flicked through the channels (with the volume down low, of course), I saw a flicker of movement. A small shadow slinking away and into the rooms where the kids slept. I walked to the doorway and found the door a bit ajar. 

&#x200B;

Now, I don't really recall whether the doors were ever all the way closed. I did check up on the kids to make sure that they were all asleep in their beds, so I must've opened the doors first, and it was entirely possible that in trying to be as quiet as possible, I didn't close the doors right. 

&#x200B;

I peeked in again, the rooms were still nice and dark as before. I could hear the kids soft breathing sounds from the opposite sides of the room where their respective beds were. I figured I had imagined something and went back to the living room.

&#x200B;

As I closed the door, I saw a pair of eyes. A pair of yellowish eyes looking at me from under the children's desk.

&#x200B;

Startled, I blinked and the eyes were gone. I thought I heard a slight clattering of nails against the floorboards and could've sworned I felt something brush against my legs on the way out. I supposed the neighbors had a cat that I didn't know about. It would explain the small thumps I would sometimes hear during my late night snackings. The kids were still sound asleep so I went back to the living room.

&#x200B;

Their mother came back soon after and she very kindly bought me a hamburger meal for me to enjoy with the kids. The kids were happily munching on the fries when I mentioned their furry little friend to their mom. The mom was a bit abashed, as the apartment had no pet rule, but the kids found the kitten as a stray and the whole family fell in love with the kitty. I loved cats and had no interest in snitching, I said that I was hoping to see the kitten. The mom smiled and said that the dad was going to pick up the cat up from the groomers after his shift. It was a bit weird but I didn't want to say anything with the kids there so I kept my mouth shut.

&#x200B;

As I left their place, I saw a picture of their family on the fridge. The kitten was white. With pale blue eyes. 

&#x200B;

 In the days that followed, I could sometimes hear their kitten scratching at our living room walls, playing and thumping around. I did eventually get to meet their cat, but it wouldn't let me near her. Always looking at me distrustfully from afar. But then again, that's pretty much what cats do. It made me feel better to know that I could pin all the noises in the night on the cat next door. 

&#x200B;

What happened next, however, was harder to explain away. 

&#x200B;

One morning, before dawn, I suddenly had an urge to wake up. I opened my eyes but I couldn't move. Now, I stil had the occasional sleep paralysis and figured as such. So I tried my best to stay calm and wait for it to pass. Then, I saw a shadow walk through my closed door. Well, walk probably wasn't the best description. Jerking, sudden movement in a certain direction. 

&#x200B;

I thought that it was same shadow that always loomed over me through the wall before I moved the cabinet. I lay there, watching it move around my room. I had the weirdest feeling that it was "facing" away from me. 

&#x200B;

Before, it didn't have a face. Now, as it slowly turned around, I saw that it had a pair of yellow glowing eyes.

&#x200B;

All of a sudden, my phone rang and I found that I could move. I breathed heavily as I sat up. As I grabbed my phone, I realized that the shadow figure had dissappeared. I saw that the call was from my cousin. I hastily picked up the phone.

&#x200B;

She asked me where I was, and that's when I realized that it was almost 10. I had promised to pick her up from the train station at 9:30. I sprung up and scrambled to get ready. As I was stammering all sorts of apologys and excuses, she said that she couldn't hear me as it was too noisy where I was. 

&#x200B;

I was in my room. Alone. 

&#x200B;

Later she insisited that it was like calling her mother in a farmer's market. And thats why she thought I had already left home and was on my way.

&#x200B;

At that point, I was starting to get weirded out, too.

&#x200B;

But I still have a few more stories to get to why I moved out.
