I am the daughter of a supernatural hunter.

No, it is not cool. No, my life isn't a movie. And most importantly: no, you don't want to be a hunter.

You just need to be prepared to protect yourself.

My life has been a nightmare full of rules and regulations. I was never allowed to play with Ouija boards, walk in the woods by myself, or visit graveyards and abandoned old buildings. Little things that you would not think twice about are a big "no, no" in my life.

Even though I am alive, sometimes I wish I was as oblivious as you.

Sometimes I wish my dad had a normal job and worked at a bank, drove a truck, or sold air conditioning units. Anything but this. I wonder how different my life would be. Maybe I would have sneaked out in the woods with my friends at night or gone to see the latest horror movie at the mall. Enough daydreaming. We don't have time for that. Let's get straight to the point.

The point of this post is to warn you. Hunters are not able to keep up anymore.

Recently, there has been an influx of supernatural creatures all over the world. Hell, I don't know why. I'm just a stupid girl trying to help as many people as possible. I just know that hunters are at a disadvantage and are losing the fight.

If you are reading this and thinking to yourself "Well, I have never seen a supernatural creature or had a paranormal experience!", then congratulations to you! The hunters in your area are good at their job. A lot of them are. But it doesn't matter anymore. Soon they won't be able to keep up either.

I don't know what is driving up the number of creatures but it is becoming a problem. You need to prepare yourself for what is coming. You will spend the rest of your life trying to survive it, if you are lucky. If you are not lucky, well...then you don't have to worry about any of this.

The advice I am trying to give you isn't going to be what'd expect. Much of the 'paranormal tips and tricks' you hear around the internet or in Hollywood movies will get you killed.

"Turn the lights on to scare away the shadowy figure in the corner". Wrong. The shadowy figure in the corner doesn't care if you have the lights on.

It just wants your soul.

It is lurking in the shadows, watching you sleep to get a better idea of how to get to you.

If it is already in your house, it is too late.

If you turn the lights on, you acknowledge it. Now, it knows you have seen it and will make sure to interact with you as much as possible.

"Make sure to always say GOODBYE and end the session when playing with a spirit board". Wrong. You do not get to make that decision anymore. You have invited something in your house through a portal.

It calls the shots now. Pray that whatever the entity is, it just wants some company.

If it is a dark spirit, it is too late. Now you get to say GOODBYE.

Enough with the terrible popular advice you will find wherever you look. I am here to give you actual information. It might save your life or it might just give you some peace of mind.

**Number One:**

It feeds off your fear.

Whatever it is. From your friendly poltergeist to a malicious, evil, entity. It is always feeding off your fear.

Stay calm and collected as much as possible. Different creatures require different solutions, that is true. But you cannot proceed with protecting yourself if you are contributing to the creature's power over you. Control your emotions. It is easier said than done.

**Number Two:**

There are indeed situations that put you more at risk. Don't be stupid. Trust your survival instincts.

Don't play with spirit boards. Don't open up portals. Don't explore haunted places. Don't do stupid TikTok paranormal challenges. Avoid cemeteries and areas with unexplained activity.

There is no 'safe' way to do it. You are not in control.

Whatever you invite into your space, will stay there.

**Number Three:**

Once you expose yourself to it, it never really leaves you.

Yes, you could survive. But you will always be scarred for future paranormal encounters.

You stand out now. Congratulations!

Take it from my personal experience, you could break the connection you formed with the creature. Or even kill it. Your energy will never be the same. You are a magnet for supernatural experiences now.

It is not surprising that one person can go through their whole life without having a simple ghost sighting, while another person is having experience after experience. That's how it works.

Unfortunately for you, more people are becoming exposed.

**Number Four:**

If it is in your house, it is too late.

Supernatural creatures don't try to invade your house. They have no concept of that.

They invade your personal space. Whatever it may be.

No, you are not just seeing dark figures in the corner of your eyes in your hallway. You are in danger.

Seeing a fully manifested supernatural entity outside is better than experiencing traces of paranormal activity in your home.

**Number Five:**

Don't engage with it.

If you can help it. The more you mess with it, the more you draw it to yourself.

This rule is tricky and there are exceptions. If you think engaging with the creature will save your life or improve your situation, then it might be useful. Think carefully.

But as a general principle. Stay away from it.

I actually like one popular saying. "If you hear your name in the Appalachian mountains, no you didn't". It is most likely a skinwalker anyway. It will leave you alone after a while. If you end up responding to it and form a connection, it will follow and taunt you for a couple of days. Go home, lock doors and windows, and wait it out. You will be fine.

**Here are some more specific principles that you should probably know:**

* Some supernatural creatures are more dangerous than others. And it might not be what you'd expect.
* Just like humans, supernatural creatures are always adapting.
* Salt probably won't protect you if the creature is too powerful. But you can always try.
* What works for one creature, might not work for another.
* The atmosphere only gets colder when a ghost is near. All other entities do not make a difference. Be vigilant.
* If you encounter a ghost that is holding an object, that is not a ghost. Ghosts do not have the power to interact with tangible objects.
* When hiking, stay on the trail. You won't get lost or damage fragile ecosystems. Far worse will happen to you.
* If it is mimicking, mocking, or taunting you - ignore it.
* If an area becomes unsafe, avoid it.

Those are the most important things I want you to understand. There are many details and specifics. But we don't have time for long lessons and complicated instructions.

Prepare yourself for what is coming.

Hunters of paranormal entities are no longer able to shield you from the realities of the world.

**One last thing:**

If the creature is in your house...

>!They like to crawl on the ceiling before they attack you.!<
