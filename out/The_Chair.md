I’m not entirely sure if this subreddit is dedicated to real stories or just made up ones. Here’s my own personal story with death.

It’s been years, what was almost my death is now just a scar that is a line going down all the way at to my eyebrow. I was in the 7th grade, eager for the day. My teacher always had this chair that would spin, I loved it and so did my other classmates. We used to take turns on the chair before my teacher stopped reminding us so whoever was early got the chair, unfortunately I was always late and never got it often. One day, I was there early. Another one of my classmates were there and we fought for the chair, he said a race and whoever sat in it first would get it. We were stupid, nobody was nearby. Not even the teacher was there yet but the door was wide open, so as the dumb kids we were we went inside. It wasn’t close to passing period ending, me and the kid dashed for it. My father was from an athletic family so I naturally had a high chance of winning, what I didn’t expect was that the kid would do anything for that chair. Right as I was reaching the chair, he became close to it, I still had a chance but suddenly I was pushed a separate way from the chair. Before I could slow down or react, I ran right into a giant metal storage bin. 
(For reference it’s about the same height as 6’0)

It was all dark, I could hear voices but they weren’t voices I knew. They sounded demonic, I heard screaming and crying. I saw this bright light, I couldn’t get the strength to go to it but I tried. This thing, I can’t remember but it didn’t look or sound human. I woke up on the ground, blood splattered on the storage bin, my glasses were across the room, I was laying comfortably on my head as my hair was up and scattered on the ground. My head was cracked open, I was laying in a pile of my own blood as it kept pouring out and my vision was blurred. I couldn’t tell if it was because of me losing blood or because my eyesight is shit, time seemed to have passed a bit as my fellow classmates were cleaning up the splattered blood around the room as my teacher went to my aid. He had sent the same kid who raced me down to get medical help as blood kept pouring out even faster this time, the kid seemed to hate me because someone caught him just in the halls after 15 minutes went by. I was losing consciousness again as my teacher asked what happened, I wasn’t too sure myself so I told him I had a bad sense of direction. After I was taken to the hospital, I never saw that chair again. We pretended it never happened but I know everything now as the years keep going, I’ve checked and the blood never went away no matter what they did. I still wondered what power that chair possessed to make people want to end each other’s lives just to have one chance to sit in it, maybe the chair was just was a normal chair. After the incident I changed and so did my room with this new demon.
