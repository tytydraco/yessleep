When I was 13 years old, I was insanely obsessed with playing my guitar. It was nothing special because I had no money, just a red Fender Squier. But I played it all the time. I normally played it in the music room of my house at the time. I would sit on this Leopard printed lounge chair that sat in the corner of the room. 

I usually liked to show off my skill of guitar playing, which I would record on Snapchat and send to all of my friends on there. A lot of them ignored it, but a lot of them liked it. I had one friend that also played guitar, so I would send her some videos, it made me feel good about showing off my skill.

One day I was recording a song I had just learned, to send to my guitar playing friend, and I decided to put the new strap I got for my guitar on and play it standing up. I got about halfway through the limit of recording on snap until I heard a loud screech. I just about jumped so fast that I flew through the roof. I thought maybe it was just my amplifier glitching out, because I didn't hear where it came from. I restarted the Snapchat video and started playing again. Once again, at the exact same time as last, I heard a loud screech. This time I was a bit creeped out, and I looked around the room, really hoping I didn't find anything. Once again, nothing. I sat down in my chair and once again, started playing the song. This time I made it all the way through the song with no screech. I got tired and got done playing guitar and realized how late it was. I went to bed forgetting about the screeches, and slept through the night just fine.

That was until about 4:09 AM the next morning... I heard the same screech, but about 10 times louder, that's what woke me up. I went downstairs, to wake up my dad, and on the walk from my room to the stairs, the music room is on my left. In the corner of my eye, I noticed the chair was no longer in the room, but a piece of paper lie where the chair sat. Totally spooked with goosebumps, I picked up the piece of paper and stuffed it in my pocket, I was too scared to open the paper, so I waited. I got to my dads room, surprised he wasn't awakened by the screech, so I woke him up and he said he never heard any screeching. I was sobbing at this point, and my dad was beyond confused. I asked about the chair, and he said we never owned a leapord print chair...

At this point, I thought I was going insane. I let my dad go back to bed, and I opened the paper. It just read "5:04 AM :)" Creeped out, I just went back to bed. It was about 4:25 AM when I got back to sleep. I  woke up again at 5:04 AM. Everything was normal, until I realized the chair was back, I ran downstairs, and my dad was gone. I opened the front door to try to look for him, but the front door opened up to my house, and when I opened the front door in that house and it was another one, and an infinite loop. 

I am now 17 and stuck in this loop, and every evening at 4:09 PM I hear a loud screech. I've also noticed a tall man in the music room sitting in the chair from time to time.
