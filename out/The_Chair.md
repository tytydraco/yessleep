I am still not sure how I ended up in this situation. I remember dropping the kids off at school and going for my usual run. We have recently moved to this small town and am still learning our way around, I had taken a turn I usually do not and had gotten somewhat lost. I ended up on a cul de sac. There was a huge old 2 story craftsman style house at the end. It was the only house on the street. It was bluish with a huge wrap around porch. Seated at the top of the hill it casts an imposing shadow. 

As I turned to go back it happened. Not sure what mind you. I woke up with an instense headache. It was pitch black. The first thing I noticed was my feet were on a concrete floor and it was freezing cold. 

Wait what happens to my shoes??

What Why can’t I lift my legs??

Oh no I am strapped down to a chair. My legs and arms are each strapped separately to the chair arms and legs.  There are other straps around my torso. 

I can’t move,

The chair is large and wooden. Strangely comfortable

My heart rate quickens and I am filled with terror at my predicament.

I decide not to scream as to not alert whoever brought me here that I am awake.

Quickly, I try to work to free myself. I only succeed in making the bonds tighter. Stay calm. I tell myself. Panicking isn’t going to help.

There is no sound nor light in the room. I assume due to the coldness in the room that I am underground. 

I have no idea how long I sat there. Contemplating my situation, thinking about my kids. Oh no, my daughter has her spelling bee at school today. She was looking forward to me being there. She has been studying so hard. She is super smart. 

 

I am alone in the dark. In a chair that has become my prison.

The silence is broken by the sudden appearance of footsteps. My throat tightens and my fists clench. I feel my heart pounding about to leap from my chest. 

Thud 

thud

They are getting closer.

I become aware of a large wooden door across from me.

The door starts to creek.

It slowly opens

 A light pours in, before me is an imposing figure. Maybe 6ft 7. 300 lbs easy. White hair a white beard. Dark black eyes. No, they were not brown, deep black, piercing. As if he wasn’t just looking at me, he was looking through me. Huge hands and huge feet.

He seemed to stare at me for what felt like an eternity.

“Welcome” he snarled

Ummm ok

I tried to sound confident and not afraid.

“Who are you and why have you bought me here?”

“That isn’t of your concern right now. You will find out soon enough,” He snarled

“You will speak only when spoken to”

He continued.

“We will have a long chat after lunch”

Lunch? 

“I want your stay here to be (he paused) comfortable (great I get a psycho that has jokes)“

“Well can I have a blanket? I am freezing.”

”I must go upstairs and check on lunch, it should be about ready. Today we are having lasagna”

“I will return soon with your meal”

I am thoroughly confused at this point. Wondering what is about to happen. Soon the large wooden door closed and I returned to the darkness of my chair prison. 

It wasn’t long until he returned. He freed part of my arm so I could somewhat feed myself. His hand,  when it brushed against mine wasn’t just cold. It was freezing. A freezing I cannot explain. I have never felt anything that cold. 

The lasagna was, well amazing. Yes, I ate I figured I wasn’t escaping so if it was poisoned it would likely be better than what was next.

He laughed “ you have three children correct?”

My blood ran cold. “Yes” (how did he know?)

“Your daughter has a spelling bee today?” (What the? how could he know that?)

“You leave my chidlren alone” I shouted.

“ I do not hurt chidlren,” he said, somewhat unconvincingly.

“They will miss me, they need me”

“They will not  even know you are gone” he deadpanned. 

Now what the hell did he mean by that? What is his plan??

“ You are in the basement of this house.” Suddenly I noticed the room. Maybe 5x8. Walls made of what appeared to be cinderblocks.

“Do not waste your breath screaming.” No one will here you and no one else is in this house.“ 

Ok I am in the basement of a house. Must be that huge house, I guess I didn’t go far.

He strapped my other arm back down. That cold clammy hand holding my arm down while strapping. It was worse the restraint.

“Do not bother trying to escape. The restraints are too thick.” It is a waste of energy”

So I noticed.

“What will it take for you to let me go? “ I attempted to bargain.

He just laughed and turned and left me. The large wooden door slammed shut. It locked. Why lock the door if I can’t get up? I wondered.

Alone in the dark. In my chair that has become my prison.

I attempt to work on the bonds on my arms. No good.

Maybe I can get my feet free. Well that only served to make the straps on my arms tighter. Guess it is all connected.

I had to remain calm and try to reason with the giant. It seemed to be my only hope.

I am still in shock over what has happened, why me? Why bother feeding me an amazing lunch?

The chair is a massive wooden chair. With large wooden armrests. 4 large legs. My arms are strapped to the armrests and my legs to the legs. My back is flat against the chair. My feet can reach the floor. My feet are freezing, why couldn’t he give me a blanket?

I have tried to rock the chair, but it appears to be secured to the floor. I don’t know how I can escape. The straps are cutting into my wrists and ankles. I don’t know what to do. For some weird reason the chair is giving me a feeling of comfort and safety. I don’t know why.

I am alone in the dark, in a chair that has become my prison.

Suddenly, I start to drift off. 

Where am I now? My daughter’s classroom? They are having the spelling bee?The calendar on the wall shows todays date.  How? What the.  There is a woman standing in the room that I do not recognize. I thought I knew most of the parents but we are new here so who knows. She is slender, long black hair and a long black dress. No one seems to notice me there. Suddenly this woman turns and smiles? She can see me? Who is she?

Suddenly the scene disappears.

It is replaced by a teen apparently at a school dance or something. I don’t recognize her. She is thin build but fairly tall. Standing next to her is THAT SAME woman who turns around and stares straight at me and smiles?  What is happening? How does she see me?

What was in that lasagna??

Suddenly I am back, still alone in the dark in a chair that has become my prison.

I am not sure how long I was in that chair. I just know the Giant, as I affectionally  called him brought me 3 more meals of lasagna. Each time I would drift off afterwards and dream. Each time in my dream that same woman in a black dress would be in there and she would smile at me. One time I saw my sons upcoming baseball tournament and she was there. I began to look forward to seeing her friendly face. As odd as that may sound.

He hadn’t spoken to me much. 

I tried to bargain with him to try to see if I could get him to set me free, no good. He just stared blankly at me.

I tried to ask him questions about his past and where he came from. But got nowhere.

I still tried to free myself but just couldn’t. The straps were too thick and strong. The chair, you would think it would start to really hurt. But it didn’t. It was strangely comfortable. 

Here he comes again.

Thud 

Thud 

Thud.

He has huge feet. Well, all of him is huge.

“Greetings” he said. I said “ hello.”

“Today, after lunch” he said almost gleefully, “you will find out why you are here.”

Suddenly my heart started to race again, the fear krept  in all over again, I HAVE to escape somehow.

I wasn’t sure that I wanted to know what was next but before I could ask, he left and shut the door again. The sound of the door locking this time seemed louder and more ominous than before.

I was again, alone in the dark. In the chair that had become my prison.

My feet are freezing and I cannot move them. my arms and legs are sore from struggling. The straps are cutting into my wrists and ankles.

I am losing hope.

Suddenly I hear a new set of footsteps. Much lighter. Has he brought friends??? What is about to happen to me??

The door slowly opens. Light floods the room. In steps a female figure. As my eyes adjust to the light, it is that SAME long black haired woman from my dream.

“Quickly, I am going to set you free, you must hurry up those stairs and straight out the front door before he returns” 

“What is your name?” 

She said “there is no time for that”

“Now go”, “we have to get out of here”

FREEDOM!

I find my shoes, quickly put them on.

“Hurry!!! Go!!,”

I step out into the hall and am hit my the smell of dust and stale air. I find the stairs. Wow that is a tall staircase, I hurry to the top. Suddenly I realize I am alone. I call back down to her and there is no response.

I guess I am in the living room. It is dark and cold. Dust covers everything. Looks like no one has been there in years. What the…??

Suddenly, I hear a car pull up. Fearing that is the giant, I creep towards the window. It is a police car, followed by another squad car.

In steps a large police officer, who looked like he had been on the force for a while followed by a young man that looked like he just finished high school and two other young officers.

“We received a report of a disturbance in this abandoned house”

I explained it wasn’t abandoned and explained the situation and there was a woman downstairs that may need help.

The younger officer ran down the stairs and came back and said there was only 3 rooms, the chair and no one, he noted there were no exits down there.

The other officers checked upstairs and throughout the house and there was no sign anyone had been there. The only footprints in the dust were the ones we had made.

How is that possible? 

The sergeant explained this house has been vacant for years. I told him about the food. We went into the kitchen and it was empty. No fridge, no oven, just some old broken empty cabinets.  My blood ran cold.  The officer asked to describe my captor. When I described them, he showed me a picture of a large man and another of a slender woman.” 

“Yes, that is them”

“what is happening?”  “I ate food tho.” Wait I hadn’t needed a bathroom in days.

What happened?

“About 10 years ago,” the sergeant began, “ this stranger from New York came to town. He had been a chef at an Italian restaurant .”

“He seemed nice, but had a dark side”

“He kidnapped a mom and 17 year old daughter”

“That woman in the picture??”

“Yes, they were held down there for days. The daughter was strapped to that chair you were strapped to in that middle room. “

“The mom freed herself, went looking for her daughter”

She found her and the chef towering over her. She hit him on the head with a cinder block she found.”

“She freed her and sent her upstairs”

“Unfortunately the man came to and chased mom up the stairs”

The struggled and fell down the stairs to their deaths.”

“The girl escaped”??

“Yes she is fine and is married with 3 kids and works as forensic investigator”

“ you know her well?” As relief is replaced by sadness

“She is my daughter, the sergeant said.” At this point the younger officers eyes were the size of dinner plates””

“I am so sorry about your wife “

“So I was held captive by a ghost???”

“Yes, apparently so” we have been trying to get the family to sell this place, you see every year we have to come around this time to this house, she has rescued several people.” 

“Wow, let’s get out of here”

“What day and time is it?”  I was stunned when he told me that it was right before I had been captured. Somehow I still had time to make the spelling bee.

I had never been so glad to see my family. They were confused as to why I was so emotional.

Anyways, so three months later this house went on the market, we bought and restored it. I guess it has been about a year since that happened.

It is amazing isn’t it?

We turned the basement into a game room, play area. The kids love it.

Yes this is the house.

Oh the chair? I brought it up and had it refinished, you are sitting in it now. Isn’t it beautiful? My favorite spot to sit in and watch TV.

What’s a matter? 

Leaving so soon?

What is wrong? 

Dinner is almost ready. 

It is lasagna.
