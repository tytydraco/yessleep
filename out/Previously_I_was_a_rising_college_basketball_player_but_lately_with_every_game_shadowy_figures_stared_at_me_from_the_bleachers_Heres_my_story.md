I don’t like silence, especially not in an arena. It’s like that feeling when you’re in an empty school hallway at night, hearing only the hum of the lights. Feels unnatural, a break in the system. Basketball arenas, even at low points, usually have some kind of noise—shoes squeaking, someone clapping, a coach barking. Not tonight. Tonight, it’s just tension pressing down like the air’s made of wet cement. The game’s tied, and there’s maybe a minute left on the clock. My heart’s beating in my throat, loud enough that it almost drowns out the crowd. Almost.

I get the ball, and everything in me goes quiet. It’s the kind of moment you dream about when you’re a kid, the kind of moment every rookie prays for, breathes for. I’m ready. I’m steady. But then I feel this prickle on my skin, a tingling at the back of my neck, and I know something’s off. Like when you’re walking alone at night, and you can just tell someone’s watching. You don’t look; you just know.

The ball’s in my hands, and my focus is on the hoop. But it’s there—this itch at the corner of my eye. I can’t shake it. I glance up at the bleachers, just for a second. And that’s when I see them. A cluster of still figures, watching. Not moving, not blinking, just sitting there in a sea of cheering fans, like statues left behind by mistake. I don’t recognize them, but there’s something familiar about them, something that twists my gut.

I blink, and they’re still there. Not moving, not clapping. Just watching.

I miss the shot. It happens so fast that I barely feel the ball leave my hands. It smacks the rim and bounces off, and the noise crashes back over me—the boos, the groans, the frantic yelling from Coach Hart. And I’m left standing there, hands empty, heart racing, my skin crawling as the figures melt into the crowd.

Later, in the locker room, I can still feel that prickle on my neck. Coach Hart doesn’t say much, just walks by me with a look that could cut glass. He’s got this way of looking at you like you’ve disappointed him personally, like he bet his house on you, and now he’s paying the price. He doesn’t yell or curse; he doesn’t need to. Just gives you that one look, and you’re left feeling small.

I find my locker, slam my fist against the metal. The clanging echoes around the room. Ryan glances over, raising an eyebrow. He’s been my friend since the start, but tonight he just shrugs, like, *Yeah, rough game, but what are you gonna do?*

“It was one shot, Jared,” he says, casual, like we’re talking about missing a bus. “You’ll get another chance.”

He doesn’t get it. Ryan’s the kind of guy who shrugs off failure like water off a duck. No ghosts in his closet. But for me, it sticks. The missed shot, those figures in the crowd—it’s all crawling under my skin, like a sliver you can’t dig out. I can still see them, still feel their eyes on me.

As I pull off my jersey, I catch my reflection in the mirror. I look tired. Or maybe just worn down. High school, college, now here, I’ve been running at full speed since I was twelve, all for this. And now, when I’m so close I can practically smell the NBA, something’s off. Something’s holding me back.

I turn, and there’s Coach Hart, standing at the entrance to his office, arms crossed. He doesn’t say anything, just nods toward his desk like he’s got something to say. My stomach twists a little. I walk over, stopping just outside his office.

He looks up, eyebrows raised, and takes a breath. “So, that final shot, huh?” He clicks his tongue, leaning back in his chair with a smirk. “Tell me, Jared, were you aiming for the rim or just the fans in the nosebleeds?”

I laugh despite myself, scratching the back of my head. “Yeah, yeah, it got away from me. Guess I let the pressure get to me.”

“Hey, look, happens to the best of us.” He shrugs, giving a half-smile. “You’re still here, right? Nobody’s carting you off to the G League just yet.”

I chuckle, even as the disappointment sticks with me. “Well, it sure felt like that after the crowd got going. Couldn’t have been worse timing.”

Coach waves his hand. “Crowds don’t play the game, Jared. They pay to be loud, to boo and yell. Means nothing once the buzzer hits.” He pauses, squinting at me. “C’mon, you’re not sitting here beating yourself up over one shot, are you?”

I start to nod but stop, half-laughing. “Yeah, I mean... I don’t know, it just feels like I’m letting the guys down. I’m supposed to be the one pulling through on that stuff.”

He raises his eyebrows, feigning surprise. “You think the other guys are losing sleep over this? Trust me, they’ll all be back home by now, feet up, watching SportsCenter, not doing their homework or studying for any of their other classes, so help them God. They’re not crying into their protein shakes over one missed shot.”

“Maybe,” I say, shaking my head. “Just… felt like a big one. That’s all.”

“Sure, sure.” He leans forward, hands folded on the desk, his expression casual. “But listen, long season ahead. You’ll miss plenty more before it’s all said and done. Besides,” he adds with a sly grin, “can’t expect you to keep bailing out the other guys every single night, right?”

I snort. “Yeah, no kidding. Wouldn’t kill them to hit a few shots now and then.”

“There you go,” he says, nodding with mock seriousness. “Exactly. This isn’t the Jared Show. Get that in your head, and you’ll sleep like a baby tonight.”

I shake my head, still feeling the sting of the missed shot, but Coach’s sarcasm takes the edge off. “Alright, alright. I get it.”

“Good.” He shrugs, glancing at the papers on his desk. “Get some rest. Tomorrow we move on.”

“Yeah... alright.” I linger for a moment, half-expecting something more, but he’s already looking down, flipping through the next set of plays. Conversation over.

Outside, the cold air hits me like a slap. The street is mostly empty, the buzz from the game still lingering, but I can’t shake the feeling that those still figures are out there somewhere, just beyond the streetlights.

As I walk to my car, I think about the faces in the bleachers, their blank, almost hollow expressions. It’s a face I’ve seen before, somewhere deep in my memory, maybe an old college game or even high school. But it’s blurry, like trying to remember a dream.

I shake it off, telling myself it was just the stress, just the pressure. But as I get in my car and drive away, I catch myself glancing in the rearview mirror, half-expecting to see those faces staring back.

That night, I lie in bed, staring at the ceiling, unable to sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I see them, those faces in the crowd, silent and still, waiting.

The next game rolls around, but last night’s loss sticks to me like mud in my shoes. The crowd’s a wall of noise, somewhere just outside my reach, a thousand voices blending into a low, grating hum. I try to shake it off, tell myself to get my head right, but it’s like a bad dream I can’t shake. Coach’s words didn’t do much to ease me up, if anything, they dug in deeper, left me feeling like maybe the weight of it all is just mine to carry.



We’re deep into the second half, and I can feel the sweat starting to bead down my forehead, pooling under my shirt. My heart’s pounding, my legs heavy from the last sprint, but there’s no time to think about any of it. We’re down by four, and I know that if we don’t pull through on these next plays, the game’s slipping out of reach.

Ryan gets the ball on the wing, and I cut through the lane, my arm up, calling for it. But his pass is a half-second late. The ball sails wide, grazing my fingertips, and smacks the floor out of bounds.

I shoot him a quick glare as I jog back on defense, but he just shakes his head, like it’s no big deal. Maybe it isn’t. Maybe I’m reading too much into it. I get back into position, calling out screens as their point guard crosses half-court.

The ball swings around, and my guy—Number 7, real quick off the dribble—starts to make a break. I stay with him, hands up, keeping him from the lane, until out of nowhere, Derek slides over to help and bumps into me, just enough to knock me off-balance. My man slips right past us for an easy layup. I’m left standing there, staring at Derek, but he just jogs back upcourt, avoiding eye contact, like it was all just a fluke.

Frustration’s gnawing at me now, a tight knot twisting in my gut. This isn’t like them. These guys know how to run plays, how to keep their heads in the game, but it’s like they’re missing every cue, like they’re a half-step off just when I need them to be on point.

And then, like a bad itch I can’t shake, I feel that same prickle on the back of my neck. I look up into the bleachers, almost instinctively, and there they are again. The same still figures, clustered together, just watching. The crowd’s going wild, the band’s thundering through some song, but those figures—they don’t move, don’t react. Just sit there, still as stone, like they’re here for something else.

I blink, try to focus back on the game, but they’re burned into my head now, and it’s like they’re watching just me, just waiting.

We get the ball back, and Ryan’s dribbling up top, motioning me to run off the screen. I break left, ready for the handoff, but just as he goes to pass, he fumbles the ball. It rolls loose, and one of their guards swoops in for an easy steal, tearing downcourt. Ryan slams a fist into his thigh, looking frustrated, but he doesn’t look at me.

I can feel my confidence cracking, slipping through my fingers like sand. Every pass, every dribble feels off. My feet are leaden, my hands slick with sweat, and every time I steal a glance at those figures, it’s like they’re bearing down on me, rooting for me to screw up. By the time the final buzzer blares, my head’s spinning. We’re out by nine, and I don’t know what went wrong, just that it all feels like it’s somehow, somewhere, my fault.

In the locker room, I don’t even bother hiding my frustration. I shove my gear into my bag, the clanging of metal echoing in the concrete room, and I turn to Ryan, jaw clenched.

“What the hell was that, man?”

Ryan barely looks up, just shrugs. “What?”

“You know what. That pass, that screen—you guys were all over the place out there.”

Ryan rolls his eyes, tossing his bag onto the bench. “Dude, chill. We all have off nights. You think I wanted to throw that pass wide? You cut late.”

I can feel my jaw tighten. “Late? I was right on time. That pass was nowhere near me, and you know it. And that wasn’t all. Derek, you stepped in on that screen, practically shoved me off my guy. He scored because of it.”

Derek crosses his arms, looking at me like I’m a kid throwing a tantrum. “Seriously? I saw you struggling with him, thought you needed backup. I wasn’t about to watch you get cooked.”

“Cooked?” I let out a short, bitter laugh. “He wasn’t even close to breaking past me until you barged in. Then it’s an easy layup. And what about the handoff? You let their guard walk off with it like it was a gift.”

Ryan shakes his head, a smirk tugging at the corner of his mouth. “You’re acting like I’m the only one who screws up. I got blindsided by a pick, couldn’t see him coming. Happens to everyone, even you.”

“Sure,” I say, the sarcasm in my voice coming through sharper than I meant it to. “It just so happened that all your ‘mistakes’ tonight lined up to screw up my plays. Funny how that works.”

Ryan’s face hardens. “Funny how you think this whole game’s about you, Jared.”

“No, but—” I stop myself, trying to keep my voice steady. “It’s not about me. But tonight didn’t feel right. The rhythm was off, like... like none of you were even looking for my cuts. And when I called for the ball, it went everywhere but my hands.”

Derek lets out a low laugh, shaking his head. “Man, we all have off nights. You’re not the star of the show every night. Sometimes the ball goes somewhere else. You know that better than anyone going off last night.”

My fists clench, but I force myself to keep them at my sides. “The hell’s that supposed to mean?”

I open my mouth to give him a few more choice swear words, but Coach Hart’s voice cuts through the air, calm but firm.

“Alright, that’s enough,” he says, his voice carrying through the room with a weight that makes everyone pause. He steps forward, hands on his hips, giving me a measured look. “Jared, go cool off. You’ve all had a rough night.”

I stare back at him, a dozen things I want to say lodged in my throat, but he just lifts an eyebrow, silently telling me this conversation’s over. So I grab my bag and shove past them, my pulse thudding in my temples.

The parking lot’s almost deserted, and the cold bites into my skin as I lean against my car, my breath fogging in the air. I pull out my phone and dial Coach Lee Sampson, my old high school coach, and, funny enough, former alumni of the university and college team I’m playing for. He picks up on the third ring, his voice gruff and familiar.

“Jared? Hey, how you doing, kid?”

I let out a shaky breath, trying to keep it light. “Hey, Coach. I’m… I don’t know, just thought I’d check in. How’s everything back home?”

“Oh, same as always,” he says. “How’s school? You keeping up with all that?”

“Yeah, classes are fine,” I reply, but my voice sounds hollow. I pause, glancing around the empty lot, then finally let it out. “I’m just… getting caught up in stuff, Coach. My game’s slipping. And it’s like—I don’t know. Things just feel off, like my own teammates aren’t in my corner. I feel like I’m just fumbling around out here”

Coach Sampson’s quiet for a beat, then he sighs. “That happens, Jared. We all have off days. Even off weeks sometimes. You’re pushing hard; it’ll mess with you a little. Just keep at it.”

“Yeah,” I say, nodding to myself, “I’m trying. But…” I hesitate, feeling a little foolish, but the words spill out anyway. “Coach, I’ve been… seeing these faces in the crowd. They’re always there, just… watching. It’s like they’re just waiting for something. I know it sounds crazy, but I feel like I’m losing it.”

There’s a long pause, and then Coach Sampson’s voice softens. “Listen, Jared, college ball—it’s a different world. You’re playing where people have a lot more to gain and a lot more to lose. Just… be careful. Watch your back, alright?”

I frown, his words sticking with me. “Watch my back?”

“All I’m saying is you don’t know everyone like you think you do,” he says, his tone measured. “Don’t put your trust in the wrong hands. Play your game, keep your head up, and don’t let anyone else write your story.”

A chill runs through me, but I feel a little steadier. “Thanks, Coach,” I say quietly. “I needed that.”

“Anytime, Jared.”

That night, the court is mine. The gym’s dark but for the overhead lights, casting harsh, pale pools across the floor. There’s a comfort in being here alone, the steady rhythm of the ball hitting the hardwood, the way everything feels focused, stripped down, just me and the sound of my sneakers echoing around the empty space.

I pull up for a shot, watch the ball arc toward the hoop, and bounce off the rim. My gaze follows the rebound, and as I run to collect it, I glance up—and freeze.

There, in the middle of the empty bleachers, a lone figure stares down at me. Dark, still, almost like a statue, the face just visible under the light. It’s him. That same face from the game—the one I thought I saw, the one that vanished. I stumble, my breath hitching as my grip on the ball slips. He doesn’t move, doesn’t react, just sits there, watching.



My heart pounds, and I step back, barely noticing when my foot catches on the edge of the court. I fall, hard, my palms smacking the floor, and when I look back up, he’s gone. Just empty rows of seats stretching out, not a soul in sight.

But I know what I saw. I can see him in my mind, clear as day—those blank, hollow eyes locked onto me, watching from the bleachers. My skin crawls, my breaths coming fast, my pulse racing.

The next morning, his face lingers in my thoughts like a shadow I can’t shake. I find myself heading to the school library without fully knowing why, my brain replaying Coach Sampson’s words—*watch your back*—and the look in that figure’s eyes. Like he’s trying to lead me somewhere, like he wants me to know something.

I settle into the quiet corner of the library, scrolling through old articles about the team. Most of it’s what you’d expect—headlines about star players, stats, some typical game recaps. But after a while, I start to see a disturbing trend. A handful of players were on the rise, bright futures, stats climbing game after game. But then, suddenly, they’d fall—one by one, season after season.

One article talks about a point guard who died in a car crash right after setting a new record. Another about a forward who passed away from “mysterious health complications” right after he got scouted. But there were other stories, too: players who didn’t die but whose careers crumbled out of nowhere. Promising stars who suddenly got benched after unexplained injuries, players who went from top scorers to second-stringers overnight. Their stats dipped; their skills slipped. And every time one of them fell, someone else on the team seemed to fill their spot almost effortlessly, stepping in to take the spotlight they left behind.

As I scroll through the stories, one line catches my eye—a familiar name buried in a piece about a player whose career ended after a streak of bad games and a mysterious shoulder injury that never seemed to heal. The article mentions an “investor” involved with the team, a last name that flashes like a warning: *Caldwell*. Ryan’s surname. My eyes linger over it, my stomach tightening. A coincidence? I can’t be sure. But I file it away, keeping the thought close.

But it’s the next article that sends a chill down my spine. A story about Luke Foster, a shooting guard who vanished a few years ago. I remember him. Everyone does. He was on the fast track, practically NBA-bound, and then one day he just disappeared. They found his car at a trailhead, but his body never turned up. Missing. Presumed dead. No one ever found out what happened, and eventually, they moved on.

I scroll down and find his photo. There, staring back at me, is the same face I saw last night in the bleachers. The same dead, unblinking eyes that locked onto me from the darkness. Except, in the picture, of course, he’d been livelier.

My hands go cold, and I push back from the screen, trying to catch my breath. I know what I saw last night, and now I know who he is—or who he was. It’s as if he’s reaching out, a warning, or something worse. And I can’t shake the feeling that he’s not finished with me yet.

I hadn’t meant to find out anything that night. I’d only gone back to the locker room to grab my water bottle, clear my head before the big game tomorrow. The halls were dead silent, my footsteps echoing through the empty space, when I heard voices coming from around the corner near Coach Hart’s office.

I was about to keep walking—figured it was someone griping about practice—but then I heard my name.

“Jared’s a liability, plain and simple,” Derek’s voice was clear, that usual edge of frustration more pronounced than ever. “Doesn’t matter how hard he tries. If he keeps pulling this ‘team leader’ crap, he’s just gonna screw up the whole show.”

I froze, heart hammering, and pressed myself against the wall, forcing my breathing to slow. Inside the office, Derek wasn’t alone.

Malik’s voice chimed in, low and casual, almost bored. “I mean, let’s be real here—he’s got talent, but it’s wasted on him. We’re the ones pulling the weight.” He paused, chuckling. “Kid’s not built for this level, man. Let him burn himself out, if you ask me.”

Coach Hart’s voice cut through, calm and controlled. “Now, let’s keep this civil, gentlemen. We’ve all put too much into this to lose focus now.” There was a short silence, his tone commanding enough to pull them all back in line. “You all know what’s at stake here, don’t you?”

“Absolutely, Coach,” Ryan’s voice was next, sharp but with a hint of a smirk. “But if this messes up my shot, if the scouts don’t see what they’re here to see—my dad’s not gonna be happy. The Caldwells have done plenty for this school, you know.” His tone was pointed, almost like a threat.

There was a heavy pause, and then Coach’s voice, steady as ever. “Ryan, I’ve gotten you this far, haven’t I? I know exactly what your family’s done for this program.” He laughed, a low, hollow sound. “Trust me, I know how much your father’s name means here. But I’m the one who’s kept you at the front of the line. I’d suggest you remember that.”

“Fine, fine.” Ryan’s tone was still smug, but he backed down, as if satisfied.

Derek spoke up again, a mocking tone in his voice. “Look, all I’m saying is we keep Jared spinning. We’ve done it before. Let him trip over his own ego. The guy’s practically begging to blow it.”

Malik let out a chuckle. “Yeah, what’s he gonna do—suddenly turn into a superstar overnight? Nah. He’ll wear himself out, we just need to give him a little nudge.”

Kyle chimed in, his voice almost dismissive. “Exactly. Let him keep scrambling. He’s already slipping, everyone can see it. One bad play, he’s gone. Easy.”

Coach’s voice came back, smooth and reassuring, like he was guiding a team huddle. “Alright, listen. Tomorrow, we stick to the plan. Jared will have his moment, sure. But I want each of you in sync. Don’t give him an inch. And if the scouts look your way…” he paused, letting that sink in. “You seize the moment.”

They all murmured their agreement.

I backed up, heart pounding, each word hitting me like cold steel. My mind raced, piecing it all together—the missed passes, the “mistakes,” the way they boxed me in on the court, the way they seemed a step behind just when I needed them to have my back. None of it had been random. They’d been working against me, and even Coach Hart was in on it, playing a different game that I was hardly even a player.

The court feels like an arena under lights so bright it’s blinding. My palms are slick with sweat, the leather ball hot against my fingertips as I line up next to Derek (#12) and Malik (#23). Ryan’s face is unreadable, but his eyes are sharp, glancing my way with a flicker that could be a warning—or a threat. It’s the biggest game of the season, and the NBA scouts are right there in the front row, notebooks open, eyes trained on every move. Somewhere up in the bleachers, my parents are watching too, but I don’t dare look for them. I’ve got enough eyes on me tonight.

The tip-off goes high, and I leap, reaching just a second before Jalen (#4), who’s matched up against me. I tap it to Derek, who takes it and bolts down the court. We set up fast, the game clock ticking down from 11:43, and the score’s already 18-18, close enough to feel the pressure.

I break left, cutting to the wing, hand up and calling for the ball, but Derek hesitates. For a beat, he holds it too long, then finally whips it over, but it’s off-target, and I have to stretch to grab it. As I pull it in, Jalen sweeps past me on defense, almost taking me out. I glance back at Derek, but he’s already jogging back, not even bothering to make eye contact. I shake it off, move into position, trying to keep my focus sharp.

We run a high pick-and-roll. I signal to Malik, who’s supposed to set the screen, but he hesitates just a second too long, and I lose my window. Still, I drive forward, cutting into the lane. I’m close to the rim when Kyle (#15) comes up from behind, a little too fast, forcing me to readjust mid-air. I barely manage to get the shot off, the ball grazing the rim before bouncing out. The crowd groans, and I hear Coach yelling for us to hustle.

The scoreboard flickers: 20-18. Our lead. There’s no time to overthink it—I just get back in position, watching the rival team dribble upcourt. As I fall into step, Derek sets up on the left side, his eyes on Jalen, and I brace for another defensive rotation. Just as Jalen makes a move, Derek steps in front of me, his body cutting close. His shoulder knocks mine, not enough to call but enough to throw me off-balance, and Jalen slips past for an easy layup.

I grit my teeth, trying to tamp down the frustration building up. The scoreboard ticks: 20-20. I catch Derek’s smirk as he jogs back, as if he’s telling me, *You’re on your own, man.*

Minutes tick by, and the game becomes a relentless grind. We’re running tight plays, but every time I move, there’s someone from my own team—a shadow, a foot, an elbow—blocking my path, boxing me out. It’s like they’re a step behind on purpose, each screen set too late, each pass barely within reach. My head’s spinning with it, the way they move, like wolves in my blind spot, ready to pounce the second I slip up.

We break into the third quarter, and the scoreboard reads 38-36. Our lead again, but barely. I pull up from the wing, catching Malik’s eye as I signal for a pass, but he looks right past me, handing it off to Ryan instead. I scramble back, swinging around to reset, but they’re all moving against me, shutting down every opening I try to make.

I manage to break free, sprinting down the court with the ball, and for a second, it feels like I’ve got a clean lane. I go up for the layup, the rim just inches from my fingertips, when I feel a nudge—a sharp, intentional push from behind. I crash into the post, barely catching myself, my ankle twisting under the weight. I glance back, seeing Kyle, his eyes blank as he runs past. Not even a glance my way, like it was nothing.

The scoreboard flashes: 42-38. I can feel the tension tightening in my chest, my pulse pounding like a drum. I catch the scouts’ eyes in the front row, pens poised over their notebooks, tracking every move. But I can’t think about them right now. The score. The time. The bodies on the court—it’s all closing in.

The minutes stretch into a feverish blur. Ryan’s elbow finds my ribs on a rebound, Derek “accidentally” clips my knee on a cut, Malik’s foot nearly lands on mine when we switch up on defense. I’m in survival mode, dodging more than playing, eyes darting from one teammate to the next, reading their intentions in every glance, every smirk.

We hit the last two minutes of the game, and the score’s tied at 50. The court’s a pressure cooker, every step laced with the threat of an “accident.” I can feel it in the way they move, a charged, silent conspiracy hovering between us. I’m caught in their trap, and every play is another chance to take me down.

Coach calls a timeout. I jog to the bench, every muscle tense, trying to calm my breathing. The crowd’s roar dims to a low hum, and I sink into my seat, elbows on my knees, head down. My teammates cluster around, laughing, clapping each other’s backs, but there’s something sharp and knowing in their eyes, something just for me.

Coach claps his hands, calling us in, running through last-minute plays, but my mind’s somewhere else, halfway between a plan and pure survival. I feel Ryan’s eyes on me from across the huddle, his stare cold, daring. He knows I’m onto him. I can see it in the way his mouth twitches into a smirk, like he’s taunting me, challenging me to do something about it.

The whistle blows, pulling me back into focus. As I stand and look around, I catch something in the stands that freezes me mid-step. Up in the bleachers, scattered among the crowd, are those shadowy figures—the same ones I’ve seen before, but now there are more of them. Luke Foster’s face, blank and unmoving, watches me from a row above, joined by other familiar faces, players I’d read about, players whose careers had ended without warning.

They sit there, still and silent, watching. I take a breath, my pulse racing, but their eyes don’t move, don’t blink. They’re waiting for something. For the end of a game I was never supposed to win.

Coach claps his hands, bringing the huddle closer. “Alright, listen up. We’re tied at 50, last two minutes. We can’t let this slip.” He draws out the play on his clipboard, arrows crisscrossing each other in a flurry of X’s and O’s. His voice is low, intense. “We’ll go with a high pick-and-roll. Jared, you cut to the weak side. Malik, be ready for the dish if they double-team him, alright?”

Derek leans in, nodding. “Got it, Coach. I’ll set the screen, pull their big guy out of position.”

Malik (#23) chimes in, slapping a fist into his palm. “I’ll be there for the rebound. Let’s just keep it tight.”

The play is basic, textbook, and yet I know it’s a trap. They’ve rehearsed every move, every look exchanged between them, but I can see through it all now. The scouts are still watching, pens ready, eyes fixed on us. Somewhere up in the bleachers, those figures linger, waiting, their silent presence bearing down like a weight on my shoulders.

Ryan catches my eye from across the huddle, his smirk unmistakable. “You hear that, Jared? Don’t miss the cut this time, alright?”

I glare at him, jaw clenched. I can feel Coach’s eyes on me, feel the rest of the team watching. But I don’t back down. “Yeah. Sure. Let’s get it done.”

The huddle falls silent for a second, the tension crackling between us. Coach stares at me, the lines on his face pulled tight, trying to read me. But I don’t give anything away. I know better than to trust them, to trust any of them.

Coach clears his throat, breaking the silence. “Alright. Let’s execute. Stick to the plan.” He nods, but it feels hollow, like a well-worn routine.

“Right,” Ryan says, clapping his hands, “let’s show ‘em how we finish this.” He looks around, hyping up the others, but I catch that glint in his eye, that quick flicker of smugness just for me.

I nod, keeping my expression blank. I don’t trust them one bit, but I don’t need them to know that.

The whistle blares, and I’m back on the court, blood pumping. The score’s locked at 50, and the crowd’s a low rumble, tension brewing in every corner. I look up to the bleachers and see my parents. They’re sitting a few rows back, watching, their faces a mix of pride and worry, my mom’s hand resting over her mouth, my dad nodding as if to say, *You got this.* I give them the slightest nod back, feeling their eyes steadying me just enough to ground myself, despite the undercurrent of chaos on the court.

As we set up, I catch sight of the shadowy figures again, scattered among the stands, more of them than I’ve ever seen. They’re just… there, staring, unmoving, like they’re waiting for something final. I shake it off and focus on the play.

The opposing team’s point guard, Davis (#8), dribbles up with practiced precision, eyes scanning our defense. Derek (#12) shouts, “Watch the switch!” but as we converge, I feel him brush my shoulder a beat too late, enough to throw off my timing and open the lane for Davis. He cuts through with ease, but I recover, pushing back with everything I’ve got.

They pass to their power forward, Carter (#24), who muscles past Malik for a clean layup. The scoreboard ticks up: 52-50, their lead. I get back into position, breathing steady, holding my ground. Ryan jogs over, clapping his hands, trying to hype up the team, but his glance at me holds a quiet, dark satisfaction. He’s watching for that perfect slip, the right moment to trip me up and make it look like an accident.

We inbound the ball, and I cut left, finding a sliver of space. Malik passes to me, but it’s high, just off enough to make me stretch. I catch it, barely, and pivot. Their center, Hill (#35), closes in on me with a heavy reach, but I sidestep and pass out to Kyle (#15) at the three-point line. He doesn’t even glance at the basket; he swings it back to Ryan. Every play feels like it’s teetering on the edge of disaster, one wrong move away from going south.

Ryan holds the ball, a smirk ghosting his face, then makes a show of looking my way before he calls for Malik to set a screen. I follow the play, watching for any opening, my focus narrowing. As I make my cut, Derek slips his foot out just enough, barely grazing my ankle. I stumble, catching myself before I go down, but the impact jolts through me, my ankle twisting just enough to sting. The crowd gasps, and I catch my dad shifting forward in his seat, hands clenched on the railing. I shake it off and push back, forcing the pain out of my mind.

We score, bringing it to 52-52. But every second feels charged, like a fuse burning down. Derek sets up again, signaling for Malik to swing wide. Davis moves in, and I press up, feeling the weight of my teammates, their presence close, suffocating, like they’re closing in. I glance up at the shadowed figures—they’re still there, and somehow it feels like they’re watching for the last, fatal mistake.

With a minute left, I grab a pass from Malik and drive hard toward the rim. Ryan’s on me, close, too close. I know what’s coming before it happens—the hard block, the shove that could send me sprawling. As I go up for the shot, I see his body shift, his elbow angling just so, ready to slam into my ribs.

But something goes wrong for him. Ryan misjudges his step, his foot landing awkwardly, his ankle twisting beneath him with a sickening crack. He lets out a sharp yell, collapsing to the floor as he clutches his leg. The game stops, refs blowing their whistles, players gathering around him. He’s writhing in pain, face twisted, and for a moment, everything goes silent, all eyes on him.

I take a step back, heart pounding, breath catching in my throat. I glance up at the stands, and suddenly the figures are gone. Every last one of them, as if they’d vanished into thin air. A strange sense of clarity washes over me, like a fog lifting. Their warning heeded, their role fulfilled. I look back at Ryan, still crumpled on the floor, trainers rushing over to check on him.

The refs call for a substitution, and Ryan’s wheeled off the court, his injury taking him out of the game. Coach’s face is tight, unreadable, and he calls us in. “We finish strong. No mistakes. Jared, you’re taking point. Run the plays clean.”

I nod, barely able to keep the relief from flooding over me. As I step back onto the court, the intensity shifts, a renewed sense of focus locking into place. The last few seconds tick down, and with every move, every pass, I push harder, faster. I break through their defense, sink the shots, make every second count. The scouts’ eyes are back on me, their pens moving as I drive to the rim again, layup clean, and pull ahead.

The buzzer sounds, and we win by three points. The gym erupts, but my mind is quiet, calm, steady. I glance back at the bleachers, half-expecting those figures to be there, but they’re gone, leaving only the shadow of a memory. The game’s over, and I walk off the court, feeling the weight finally lift as the scouts’ approving glances follow me out.
