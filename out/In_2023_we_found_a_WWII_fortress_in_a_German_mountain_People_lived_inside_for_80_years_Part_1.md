**Part I** - [Part II](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c2s4c2/in_2023_we_found_a_hidden_wwii_bunker_people/)

Well, they *used* to be people.

My name is Danica Craven, and I’ve been an archaeologist for the past decade. Tantalising opportunities often fall into my lap. Some drenched relic washes up on an Egyptian beach, or a lonesome fossil is uncovered. But I’m often beaten to the punch. That’s the nature of the game. And, as the years go by, fewer ancient gems remain undiscovered.

Consequently, last December, I was dumbfounded by a lead in the Bavarian Alps. And I arrived first — that was not a gift worth squandering. My team and I investigated a frosty nook near Zugspitze. Germany’s mightiest mountain. Two days earlier, in the wake of a fearsome blizzard, a misshapen steel panel was found in the snow, halfway up a steep cliff-side. Amir Langton and I had suspicions regarding its origin. Suspicions confirmed when our team unearthed something at the site.

*Concrete*.

“I told you!” I gloated.

“I know you did,” Amir laughed. “But temper your expectations, Dani. We still don’t know what we’ve found.”

And, an hour later, there came the satisfying clunk of metal against metal. Enzo Flores, our chief digger, had uncovered a lofty, metallic door. Depleted by a day’s work, he finally let his shovel fall into the snow. We followed suit, dropping our tools. Though I’d been digging significantly slower than the burly labourers, I still felt a sense of achievement. A smile broadened across my cheeks.

“Unbelievable…” Amir whispered.

“You love that word, don’t you?” I smiled. “Even when we get inside and see undeniable proof, you’ll still call me delusional.”

“Well, that’s the thing,” Amir said, scratching his neck. “How *will* we get in there?”

“Not with this measly equipment,” Enzo said. “We’ll need something heavy-duty to breach the door.”

The man, a hulking figure with rosy, frosted cheeks, led us out of the snow tunnel.

“Explosives?” Anselm Becker suggested.

“Calm down, kid. A hydraulic system should do the trick,” Enzo replied. “But we aren’t opening it tonight. Snow’s coming down. The daylight has gone. Everyone’s cold and tired.”

I huffed. “But we–”

“– Not tonight, Miss Craven,” Enzo insisted.

“Amir?” I said, turning to my friend for assistance.

My colleague shrugged. “Sorry, Danica. We won’t be able to do anything without Enzo and his men.”

“But this is an *undiscovered German stronghold*,” I said. “In 24 hours, we won’t be the only people here. You know that local will already have told everyone about the panel he found.”

“We’re going to pack up and head to the town,” Enzo said firmly. “I’ll see you in the morning.”

An idea came to me.

“Amir, let’s camp here,” I said. “Guard the tunnel. Stake a claim. This is our site, and I don’t want anyone to take it.”

“I would strongly advise against that, Miss Craven,” Enzo cautioned, rubbing a gloved hand against his red brow. “Other than tourists in the igloo resort, nobody sleeps on the mountain. Wild camping isn’t safe.”

“Leave a tent for us, and we’ll be fine,” I promised. “Amir, are you happy to stay with me?”

My partner nodded. “Sure, Dani. This is our site. I don’t want to lose it either.”

Enzo growled, barging past us and beginning to pack his equipment.

“We do appreciate your help, Enzo,” I said.

“Y’don’t need to appreciate it,” He huffed. “I don’t get paid to be appreciated. And I sure as *heck* don’t get paid to babysit.”

With that, Enzo Flores and his men began walking down the mountainous slope — heading towards the warm embrace of lights in the town below.

“I’m sorry, Amir,” I said as we tucked ourselves into our sleeping bags.

He shrugged, smiling. “I respect you, Danica. You’re more dedicated to this line of work than anyone I know. You *deserve* this find. So, let’s guard it.”

“I’m being paranoid,” I sighed.

“No doubt about that,” Amir chuckled. “But it doesn’t hurt to be safe, does it? We’d kick ourselves if someone were to invade our freshly-dug site. *We’ve* done the hard work.”

I smirked. “I mean… It was mostly done by Enzo.”

“It *was* mostly done by Enzo,” Amir agreed, and we laughed.

“Thanks,” I said. “You’re always so level-headed.”

“It’s a talent of mine,” He grinned.

As I dozed off, I had never felt safer in my life. Wrapped in a snug, cotton cocoon, I was soothed by shrieking gusts and the rippling tent fabric. Our camp blocked the entrance to the snow tunnel — guarding the gateway to Hitler’s last uncharted shelter. It was the jewel of my career. My *life*.

That cosy feeling of accomplishment didn’t last, however. Amir and I were woken by a husky bellow in the early hours of the morning.

“What was that?” My friend panted, sitting upright.

“I don’t know,” I breathlessly replied, rubbing my eyes. “It sounded–”

I was interrupted by the sound of snow crunching beneath immense weight.

“It must be an animal,” Amir whispered.

“What animal would be caught in this blizzard?” I asked.

And it wasn’t a person. Neither of us contested that. The footsteps were too thunderous.

Though our bodily instincts should’ve kept us inside, our intrigued minds got the better of us. Mother always said curiosity would be the death of me.

Amir cleared his throat. “Do you…”

“– Yes,” I answered before he finished his question.

My colleague grinned, equally eager to explore, and he cautiously opened the zip to the tent.

We peeked outside, squinting to see through the incessant downpour of white flecks. Near the rim of our campsite, illuminated by the tall spotlight Enzo had left behind, deep tracks led through the snow. Something had skirted around the edge of the site. And, for a haunting second, beyond the spotlight, I saw a black shape flit out of view — a towering figure concealed by torrential snowfall.

“Did you see that?” I cried.

“No,” Amir replied, frowning. “What was it?”

“I don’t know,” I said. “*It didn’t look like an animal*.”

“Well, no person made those tracks,” He said, nodding at the enormous footprints. “It had to be a… I don’t know. What time is it?”

I checked my watch. “Nearly four in the morning. Enzo and the others should be here in a few hours.”

My friend nodded. “Let’s go back to sleep. We’ll stay quiet. If an animal were planning to attack us, it already would’ve done so.”

“I suppose so. But I’ve been thinking about something,” I said.

“What?” Amir asked.

I paused, nodding at the archaeological find beside my sleeping bag. “This steel panel is crumpled and battered. Why?”

“They had a nasty storm up here,” He said. “Bad weather is common in these parts.”

“This German fortress is buried beneath an ocean of snow. It’s *built* into the mountain. A storm didn’t dislodge the panel, Amir,” I said. “We might not be the first people to find the bunker.”

“You need to stop worrying about that,” My colleague scoffed. “Nobody’s beaten us. It’s our site.”

“We should find out,” I said, slipping into my gear. “I certainly won’t be able to sleep now.”

Amir groaned, before nodding and getting dressed.

Torches at the ready, we left the tent and entered the darkness. No hope of sunlight to guide us. And I knew Amir was right. We *should’ve* waited. But I’d been doing that for years. And it had cost me so many opportunities. I wasn’t going to make that mistake again.

Living was more important than surviving.

“Do you still think it might’ve been a panel of ventilation slats?” I asked.

Amir nodded. “It’s incredible misshapen, but it does have that vague shape.”

“So, we should try to find the ventilation system,” I said.

“Of course. But this bunker might be humongous. How would we find the vent? You’re not seriously planning on doing more digging at this hour, are you?” He asked.

“The panel has already broken free — the digging has been done for us,” I said.

“Bear in mind that forty-eight hours of fresh snowfall might have covered whatever was uncovered,” Amir noted.

“I know,” I said.

Thirty yards to the side of the tent, there stood a flag — it marked the spot at which the panel had been found. Our starting point for the excavation. The small pole and its flapping nylon were both wearing thick, snowy blankets.

“What are you hoping to find?” Amir asked.

“Think about it,” I said. “A ventilation system missing a panel. That might provide another access point to the bunker.”

“Wait…” Amir said, pointing at a protruding rock-face thirty yards up the slope. “See that?”

I squinted through the snowfall and saw what my colleague had spotted. Streaks of red dyed the snow across the limestone face.

I shuddered. “Is that…”

“– Blood,” Amir coldly finished. “I was wrong about that animal… It isn’t harmless. We need to get out of here.”

I shook my head. “I won’t stop now.”

“Don’t be stupid, Danica,” Amir said. “You’re not going to follow that trail.”

But I’d already started wading through the snow, using my torch once I passed beyond the reach of the spotlight.

“You know I’m going to have to follow you,” He said, trudging after me.

“Please head back,” I said. “I just need to see this place before anyone else, Amir. But I don’t want you to come with me. You’ve already done enough to help.”

Of course, my colleague ignored that, and we walked together, battling against the wilful breeze. The bloody trail continued for a hundred yards, painting a foreboding wave across the snow-covered rock-face. It eventually stopped at a hole in the wall — a cavernous entry point of twisted metal.

“I was right…” I gasped. “This structure is bigger than we ever imagined.”

“I don’t know how I feel about this,” Amir said. “We should wait for Enzo and the others. It’ll be daytime when they arrive.”

“I’ll go alone,” I said. “I feel guilty enough for asking you to camp on this freezing mountain.”

“Don’t be silly. I made the decision to stay. This matters to me too, Dani. However, if somebody has removed that ventilation panel…” Amir paused, sighing. “We’ve already been beaten to this discovery, Danica. It’s over. I’m sorry.”

I shook my head. “The metal is bending towards us, Amir. The panel was removed from *inside* the vent.”

I shone my torch’s light into the blackened pit, revealing a rusted ventilation shaft. A metal tunnel with twists and turns. I stepped inside, surprised by the height and width of the vent. I was crouching slightly, but it was still a broad passageway.

“Dani, please,” Amir begged, grabbing my arm. “Don’t do this… The blood is–”

“– Something’s in there,” I interrupted, gently removing his hand. “Go back to the tent, Amir. Call Enzo. I’ll join you in half an hour or so. I’m just going to take a look. This is the biggest discovery in archaeological history.”

Amir did not turn around, however. Our boots squelched in the snowy entrance, and then came the squelch of whatever maroon-coloured gunk lay at our feet — blood mixed with something.

“The stench is unbearable,” Amir winced, his voice echoing around the ceaseless metal chamber.

“At least it masks your body odour,” I quipped. “It… Oh…”

My feet stopped a few centimetres from a gaping hole in the floor of the vent. A hole which would’ve claimed me if I’d taken another step. When Amir and I pointed our torches at the opening, we saw a small bedroom below. The quarters of ancient soldiers. Inside, there were two bunk beds — marriages of rotting wood and maggot-ridden mattresses.

The horror of our discovery finally filled my bones, paralysing my spine. I understood that something was very wrong with the place. And Amir saw that in my stiff, unmoving body.

“Right. You’ve seen it, Danica. We should head back now,” He pleaded. “This isn’t right.”

“No animal made that hole,” I said. “No human.”

“Even less of a reason to go down there,” Amir insisted. “We need to leave. Before we find… *whatever* you saw.”

“I’ll go down. I’m just going to look at this first room, then we’ll head back to the camp. You stay up here,” I said, before sitting down and dangling my legs into the hole.

“I’m not helping you,” He said.

“Well, it’s going to hurt when I hit the floor,” I shrugged.

My colleague sighed, realising that I wasn’t bluffing, and he placed his torch on the floor. Then he held my arms tightly as I gingerly slid over the edge of the hole. I felt like a child daring to dip a toe out of her duvet, in spite of the monsters beneath the bed. I placed one foot on the top bunk and lowered my second leg delicately. I nodded at Amir, and he released me.

I screamed as the mattress and supporting wooden planks collapsed under my weight.

“Dani!” Amir cried.

My friend collected his torch and swiftly jumped into the hole, landing in the room with a resounding thunk. As I hazily sat upright, lost in a festering mound of rotten wood and filthy cotton, I noticed Amir hobbling towards me.

“Are you okay?” He grimaced, helping me to my feet.

“Yes, thank you,” I said. “Are *you*?”

“I might’ve twisted my ankle,” My friend said.

I sucked my teeth. “Oh… I’m sorry, Amir. This was… You were right. This was way too dangerous. Come on. Let’s get you back to camp.”

He shook his head. “I’m strong enough to lift *you* back up, but you’re not going to be able to lift me. No offence.”

“But you need help. What if you’ve broken something?” I asked.

“There’s not a lot that could be done now,” Amir shrugged. “This is why I said we should wait until the morning.”

“I know,” I said, hugging the man tightly. “I’m sorry. Have I mentioned that?”

“Yes, but not enough times,” He smiled, wincing. “Still, you were right too. This… This place is real. And it’s *unbelievable*.”

“Are you going to keep saying that?” I chuckled.

“Take the win,” He said.

“Okay,” I replied. “I told you so.”

“Are you going to keep saying *that*?” He asked, grinning.

For a moment, we forgot about the sounds we’d heard on the mountain. The blood in the snow. The black shape I’d seen in the distance. None of those things mattered. Amir and I were explorers again. Blind to danger. Jubilant about our astounding discovery.

“Right, let’s get you back into the vent,” Amir said. “Fetch Enzo. He’ll be able to lift me up. The man’s built like Popeye.”

“One second… Look at this,” I said.

On a small cabinet at the end of the demolished bunk bed, there sat a dusty, leather-bound book. I blew off the cobwebs and flicked away a persistent spider. The diary was written in German, of course, but I’m fluent.

“*The Diary of Conrad Vogel*,” I translated.

“That’s great, Dani,” Amir said. “Now, come over here so I can lift you up.”

“Okay,” I nodded, pocketing the journal. “I’ll phone Enzo. We’ll get you out of here.”

“He’s going to be pissed,” My colleague warned, preparing his hands to lift me.

I shrugged, climbing onto Amir’s sturdy palms. “He’s always pissed.”

“Sure. This time, however, he’ll be *royally* pissed,” The man grunted, raising me through the hole.

“Everything will be fine,” I said, climbing into the ventilation shaft. “I’ll hurry. Don’t go anywhere.”

“Funny,” Amir said. “Don’t mind me. I’ll just have a nap on this crusty mattress.”

I hurried through the vent and returned to the blizzard, which felt merciless after being sheltered by a castle of steel and concrete. I fought against the elements, hurriedly scurrying back to the campsite. Once inside the tent, I immediately used the satellite phone to contact Enzo — my mobile wasn’t receiving any signal.

“It’s half four in the morning,” The man answered. “Why have you woken me, Miss Craven?”

I took a deep breath, preparing for a lecture. “Amir and I… found something.”

“What do you mean?” Enzo growled.

“We heard something outside, and then we found a trail of blood…” I started.

Enzo paused. “There shouldn’t be any wild animals on the mountain. Certainly not in this weather. Did you see anybody? Someone might be hurt.”

“It wasn’t a wild animal or a person, Mr Flores,” I said. “The blood led to the bunker’s ventilation shaft. And we… went inside.”

“*YOU*…” Enzo barked, before composing himself. “Without supervision, you explored an uncharted, century-old building at night. Is that what you mean to tell me?”

“Well, I… We had a little… accident,” I gulped.

I felt Enzo’s rage through the phone. “*What happened, Miss Craven?*”

“Amir injured his ankle,” I whispered timidly.

“*WHAT?*” Enzo roared. “Where is he now?”

“In the bunker,” I said. “I came back to the campsite to ask you for help. We have to get him out of there.”

“Stay where you are,” The man growled. “*Do not go anywhere without us*.”

The phone fell silent, and I had nothing to do but sit and wait. It would take an hour for Enzo to reach me, at the very least. And I didn’t want to cause any more problems. But then I excitedly remembered what lay in my coat.

I scooped the diary of Conrad Vogel out of my pocket.

\*\*\*

***January 2******^(nd)******, 1948***

*It has been nearly three years since we won the war. Commander Meyer, however, insists that the surface remains unsafe. The Führer has claimed the world, but roaches remain. A resistance that seeks to squash us. Bavaria is at war. That is why we must stay hidden until German forces have come to save us. Hidden in the Tollerberg. Our Führer’s mightiest stronghold.*

*I have doubts, but I will never voice them aloud. Even writing such things will put my life at risk, but I must pen my thoughts. I am losing my mind. I cannot bottle up these feelings any longer.*

*Corporal Fischer died today. Whilst clearing his room, I found this empty journal in his belongings. Strange that he would never use it. It’s a sign. God longs for me to do something more than fester in this hellhole.*

*So, let me get this off my chest. There are two possible truths:*

*Either the war hasn’t ended, or we have lost.*

*But we have not won. Why would we still be hiding?*

***February 27******^(th)******, 1948***

*It’s harder to keep up with a diary than I thought. Even with nothing to do, the mind wanders. Wanders to strange places.*

*One of the crop rooms failed last week. I don’t know why. Tollerberg is full of advanced technology. Things beyond my understanding. There are dozens of crop rooms, of course. We’ll be okay. I don’t really care as long as I get fed.*

*But I feel the nearing tide of dissent. People are angry and afraid. And it is not good to be with scared folk in a cage. Yes, we have an abundance of food, but how long are we going to stay down here? What happens when more crop rooms fail? At some point, we won’t have enough to feed everybody.*

*I vote that we stop feeding the prisoners. I don’t share the ideals of our Führer, though it is treason to say so. Nonetheless, I hate the British and the French. Let them starve.*

*Commander Meyer told us the crop rooms wouldn’t fail. He told us this fortress would stand for a thousand years.*

*So many lies.*

***March 12******^(th)******, 1948***

*Another crop room has been abandoned. That’s two in two months. Nobody’s going hungry yet, but the murmuring is getting louder. I don't like the thought of an underground mutiny.*

*Not much else to report. Charlotte and I have been meeting in my room when my bunkmates are away. She is a terrible nurse, but an excellent lover.*

***August 15******^(th)******, 1948***

*Some privates left Tollerberg yesterday. Cowards.*

*I do not believe in the Führer’s cause. But I know that I love my country. I will never leave the Tollerberg. I will never betray Germany.*

***December 25******^(th)******, 1948***

*This is the first Christmas I have celebrated in ten years. Commander Meyer senses the furious sentiment of the people. To quell our dangerous thoughts, he has allowed us to honour our Christian traditions. The Führer would not approve. But he isn’t here, is he?*

*I suspect he might be dead.*

***June 21******^(st)******, 1951***

*I forgot about this old journal. Life intervened. Death intervened.*

*More crop rooms failed over the past three years. And, as I predicted, rations have commenced. So much for Tollerberg lasting a thousand years.*

*Many soldiers have rioted, faced execution, and become martyrs for future revolutions. Perpetuating an endless cycle of death. Riot. Die. Riot. Die.*

*We despise the prisoners. More mouths to feed. Enemy mouths. But Commander Meyer tells us that ‘a prisoner equals power’. Why do we need hostages? To me, that is not the statement of a winning side. But I’ve known that for years. The war is over. We lost.*

***December 1******^(st)******, 1951***

*The men are falling sick. The women too, though they have been prioritised.*

*The starving are the sickest. Fortunately, we have begun to prioritise Germans when it comes to food. Most of the prisoners are ill. They’re malnourished and living in dire conditions. It seems Commander Meyer finally values self-preservation over power.*

*However, he’s starting to lose his grip.*

***March 12******^(th)******, 1952***

*Doctor Klein says that many of the sick are infected with tuberculosis. The White Death. An old disease. In the years before coming to Tollerberg, I remember hearing talk of a potential cure for the affliction. Though such a thing may exist, it doesn’t exist down here. And the sick are only getting sicker.*

*We are trapped in a tin can.*

***March 30******^(th)******, 1952***

*The ill have been confined to the west quarter. The armoury. There is one section for German patients and a separate section for prisoners. We will quarantine them until they die. They have been left with adequate provisions.*

*All I keep thinking is that there will be fewer mouths to feed. And I am glad.*

***July 10******^(th)******, 1954***

*Much has changed in two years. I found this book whilst clearing my bunkmate’s belongings — I stashed it under his mattress. He would never think to look there. Not that it matters now. His name was Berhtram, and he caught the White Death. No matter how many times we quarantine the sick, the disease always returns.*

*Doctor Klein has been conducting tests. Trying to find a cure. He grows tired of begging Commander Meyer to abandon Tollerberg. Like me, he knows that there is no war. He knows that we lost. But he would not dare leave this place of his own accord.*

*I don’t think anybody really leaves.*

***November 2******^(nd)******, 1955***

*I have a reason to unearth this diary once more. Charlotte has given birth to our child. One of only twenty children born in the fourteen years we have spent in this bunker. I have named him Fritz Vogel.*

*I fear for the boy’s life. I do not want him to become a soldier. I do not want him to live in this place. I pray that Commander Meyer succumbs to old age in the near future. He seems to be the last thread holding this place together. After him, we may even leave. Few people still believe in the cause of the Führer.*

***November 16******^(th)******, 1956***

*Each year passes in the blink of an eye. One might expect time to drag in such a place. No. Time does not exist here.*

*Fritz is the only thing keeping Charlotte and me going. But we are lucky. We have more than most. And for that, we are grateful.*

*Our population dwindles. Ten years ago, there were a thousand of us in this underground city. Six-hundred people remain. The White Death ebbs and flows. Whenever we think it has disappeared, it claims another dozen lives or so. But Doctor Klein promises that he is close to a solution. He conducts tests only on the prisoners. That is what he says, anyway. I only fear that his experiments continue to put all of us at risk. We shouldn’t be keeping the sick alive. Put bullets in their heads, and eliminate the risk.*

*Doctors think too much. Life is not that complicated. Klein will kill us all.*

***May 7******^(th)******, 1961***

*It seems I uncover this journal at milestones in my life. And this will be my final one.*

*The White Death has finally caught me. I have requested a bullet tonight. When I am gone, I wish to be cremated. I don’t want to be another one of Klein’s experiments. I don’t trust that he only experiments on the prisoners. The ageing man has claimed for the past seven years to be on the verge of a breakthrough. All I see is a pile of bodies. He is a liar.*

*I only hope I have not given this terrible disease to Charlotte or Fritz. I am not a good man, but they are pure people. Charlotte is a woman of conviction. She doesn’t want to be here. She cares only for healing people, as terrible as she may be at doing so. And Fritz is a gentle soul. He doesn’t deserve this life.*

*I pray this place does not eat him alive in my absence.*

\*\*\*

Shuddering at the German soldier’s last entry, I turned the page to find something unexpected.

\*\*\*

***The Diary of Fritz Vogel***

***October 27******^(th)******, 1973***

*My name is Fritz, and I don’t know whether anyone will ever read my father’s diary. They will likely never read my logs either.*

*I found his journal whilst packing my things. I am moving to a new room in the south wing. Mother is sad to see me go, and I’m scared of the future. But I’m eighteen now, and I knew this day would come. Commander Meyer still insists that all men become soldiers. All women become nurses or teachers. It has been that way for thirty years.*

*This life seems meaningless. So few of us remain. And I have found it baffling to read my father’s account of this place. Stranger still to imagine a world outside of Tollerberg. He talked of one thousand people living in this bunker. Well, three decades later, there are five-hundred of us.*

*The White Death lingers, but it’s not the threat it used to be. Of course, we lose people every year. And there aren’t many children. There aren’t many people left to have children.*

***September 8******^(th)******, 1974***

*I only remember this book when my feelings are bubbling over. My father was right. Writing is the only thing that extinguishes the insanity.*

*I’ve been working with Cuckoo Klein in the laboratory. That is what my friends call him, but he doesn’t seem that bad to me. Perhaps I focus too much on my father’s journal entries. He talked of a determined, intelligent doctor.*

*That being said, the old man I see is, admittedly, a little lost. I have been told he still experiments on the prisoners in the abandoned west wing. But that’s nonsense. They all died long ago. As Commander Meyer said, the war is over. There’s no need to waste precious resources on the enemy.*

*Meyer is a very different man from the one Father described. He’s getting old too.*

***February 16******^(th)******, 1975***

*I was excited to work in the lab. It sounded better than doing other soldierly duties. Patrolling corridors. Guarding the old armoury. Cleaning toilets. But I’m starting to agree with my friends. Doctor Klein may be crazy. He makes me uncomfortable. Saying peculiar things.*

“*You are sick. But I keep you healthy.”*

*Lina told me that he often says the same to her. She keeps me from losing my head.*

***December 2******^(nd)******, 1976***

*Mother passed. She caught the White Death.*

*Doctor Klein said that the old ones don’t have what it takes to beat the sickness. Not like the young blood. “The post-war babies.”*

*I’ve asked the commander to assign me to a different department. It took all of my willpower not to thump the doctor in the face for his callous comment about my mother.*

***November 19******^(th)******, 1989***

*Thirteen years have passed. A lifetime, in many ways. But life is just as gruelling as I remember. Still, it seemed fitting to return to this diary at a momentous juncture of my life. Much has changed in Tollerberg.*

*I am Colonel Fritz Vogel. I work as Commander Braun’s right-hand man. Not that we have many people left to lead. One-hundred men, women, and children live in Tollerberg. Father often talked of revolutions and escapees, but we do not fear that. All survivors are either too old to leave or too young to know any other life.*

*Braun and I have discussed it before. Leaving this place. But what lies beyond the fortress? A world that does not belong to the Führer. He is dead. That was what Commander Meyer finally admitted on his death bed. A secret we must keep. I have not even told my wife, Lina.*

*We lost the war in 1945. Ten years before I was even born. And this stronghold is the home of the Führer’s last men and women.*

*The commander was a selfish man. When he learnt that Germany had lost the war, he told nobody in Tollerberg. He continued the lie. Told folk to remain strong and patient. After all, this castle was built to last. Indoor crop fields, water drawn from the snow on the mountain, and a thousand other advanced machines that made this the perfect haven. A home for a millennium.*

*The commander told us that we were finally free to leave. He wouldn’t stop us. But where would we go? This is the only home the children have ever known. If we were to step foot into the outside world, it would reject us.*

*And that is not the only secret Commander Meyer revealed.*

*The prisoners and their descendents are still alive in the armoury.*

*For thirty-five years, Doctor Klein has been conducting experiments on them. The rumours were true. He’s still trying to cure the White Death. And though he has not succeeded, he has developed a treatment. A treatment that he has been giving to children for decades. That’s why we haven’t been getting sick. He gives every newborn baby a ‘temporary’ vaccine, and then he slips treatments into our food.*

*It doesn’t work on the old. Something about the vaccine flourishing in young bodies.*

*Doctor Klein must be the luckiest man on Earth to have worked so closely with infected patients for nearly four decades without becoming sick himself. The man has to be in his eighties.*

***August 31******^(st)******, 1992***

*Lina and I have just welcomed our baby girl into the world. Ella. The third generation of the Vogel family to live in this doomed place. That is nothing short of a miracle in these times.*

*There are seventy-two survivors. Most of the old guard has perished. However, against all odds, Doctor Klein persists. He is the oldest man in the bunker by a country mile. I imagine he has a picture of Dorian Gray stashed somewhere in his room.*

***April 5******^(th)******, 1995***

“*You must see my work.”*

*The doctor said that to me today.*

*He has been trying to show me the armoury in the west wing for years. I have refused. Two months ago, Commander Braun saw something in there. Something that made him unwell in the head. He took his life.*

*We have no commander now.*

*I don’t want to face the same fate. Klein has told me more than I wanted to hear. It’s horrible enough to know that those poor prisoners are still alive. Prisoners of a war that ended fifty years ago. Soldiers and civilians. The old and their children. Grandchildren.*

*Lina and I don’t believe in any of this. We don’t believe in the things that the Führer said. The idea of a perfect race. What does that even mean? I don’t want to know what things our leader did. But based on stories from the old folk, we were on the wrong side of history. They don’t believe that, of course.*

*There are fewer people to keep things running. Fewer people who know how to fix machinery and grow crops. After Commander Braun died, I disbanded the patrols. Why bother? This is no army. It’s a group of scared people hiding underground. Too afraid of the world lying beyond the door.*

*Worst of all, the White Death has returned.*

***December 21******^(st)******, 1996***

*I finally succumbed to the doctor’s demands. I joined him in the quarantine zone — the old armoury.*

*Over the past year, old age and the White Death have killed every member of the original bunker-dwellers, other than Doctor Klein. There are roughly fifty people living in this hole, and most survivors are under the age of forty. None of us know of the world before the bunker. None of us know of the world beyond the bunker.*

*The end is near. I have accepted that. Before dying, I had to know what the doctor was doing. And it was far worse than anything I could’ve possibly imagined.*

*None of the original prisoners remain. The surviving inmates are the children and grandchildren of the English and French captives. They have known no life beyond the west wing. Beyond their cages in the armoury. The German ward of the armoury is empty. No sick have survived in there.*

*But that wasn’t what horrified me the most. In the prison ward, Klein introduced me to cages of children. They were bloated beyond breaking point. Gargantuan, bulging people. Not just their bellies, but their limbs and faces. Their skin was black and green, swollen as if their entire bodies had developed gangrene.*

*The doctor ignored my disturbed reaction, and he began to taunt the children. Spitting in their cages. Calling them vile, sickening names. Telling them that God had punished them for their sins. The very sin of being born, with regard to the Jewish prisoners. My father was a man of God, and that didn’t sound right to me.*

*The children said nothing in response. They surveyed us with agonised, glassy eyes. Eyes that seemed to beg me for death. And that was when I snapped. Before I even knew what I was doing, I drew my father’s ancient revolver and unloaded all six rounds into the doctor’s back.*

*He did not die immediately. Not like any other man. But then Doctor Klein was not really a man. Who knows what experiments he conducted to prolong his life? And as I stood over the doctor, who smiled with blood pooling in his gums, he told me a terrible secret.*

*Klein found the cure for the White Death before I was even born. A cure that he administered to the young folk before we were born. Not a temporary vaccine, as Meyer believed. A cure.*

*But the side effects could be seen in the cages. Blackened skin. Inflated bodies. Inhuman eyes. Doctor Klein told me that he found a way to stop the disease from killing us by binding our minds with the bacteria. Fusing the host and the bacteria into a singular entity. The body keeps the disease alive, and the disease keeps the body alive.*

*But that is no cure. What happened to those children is obscene. Klein had been putting treatments in our food not to treat the disease, but to stop the cure from turning us into monsters. And as he died at my feet, I realised something terrible.*

*Without him, there would be no more treatments.*

I turned the page to find nothing but manic scribbles. Scribbles that continued throughout the remainder of the book. The occasional word or phrase was legible.

*Warm… Warm… Eat heat… Eat water…*

And then my heart raced as I remembered the dark shape I’d seen outside the tent. The looming shadow with large footsteps. Clearly, one or more of the Tollerberg residents had survived.

“Amir…” I whispered [fearfully](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle).
