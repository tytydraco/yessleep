**Part I** - [Part II](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c2s4c2/in_2023_we_found_a_hidden_wwii_bunker_people/)

Well, they *used* to be people.

My name is Danica Craven, and I’ve been an archaeologist for the past decade. Tantalising opportunities often fall into my lap. Some drenched relic washes up on an Egyptian beach, or a lonesome fossil is uncovered. But I’m often beaten to the punch. That’s the nature of the game. And, as the years go by, fewer ancient gems remain undiscovered.

Consequently, last December, I was dumbfounded by a lead in the Bavarian Alps. Being the first one to the scene is a gift that shouldn’t be squandered. My team and I investigated a frosty nook near Zugspitze — Germany’s mightiest mountain. Two days earlier, in the wake of a fearsome blizzard, a misshapen steel panel was found in the snow, halfway up a steep cliff-side. Amir Langton and I had suspicions regarding its origin. Suspicions confirmed when our team unearthed something near to the site at which the panel was found.

Concrete.

“I *told* you!” I gloated.

“I know you did,” Amir laughed. “But temper your expectations, Danny. We don’t know what we’ve found. There may not be an entrance.”

“Oh, it’s there,” I assured him.

And, an hour later, there came the satisfying clunk of metal against metal. Enzo Flores, our chief digger, had uncovered a lofty, metallic door. Depleted by a day’s work, he finally let his shovel fall into the snow. We followed suit, dropping our tools. Though I’d been digging significantly slower than the burly labourers, I still felt a sense of achievement. A smile broadened across my cheeks.

“Crikey… That’s been hidden under the snow for *decades*,” Amir whispered. “Unbelievable.”

“You love that word, don’t you?” I smiled. “Even when we get inside and see undeniable proof, you’ll still call me delusional.”

“Well, that’s the thing,” He said, scratching his neck. “How *will* we get in there?”

“Not with this measly equipment,” Enzo said. “We’ll need something heavy-duty to breach the door.”

The man, a hulking figure with rosy, frosted cheeks, led us out of the snow tunnel that we’d spent hours digging.

“Explosives?” Anselm Becker asked.

“Calm down, kid. A hydraulic system should do the trick,” Enzo said. “But we aren’t opening it tonight. Snow’s coming down. The daylight has gone. Everyone’s cold and tired.”

I huffed. “But we–”

“– Not tonight, Miss Craven,” Enzo insisted.

“Amir?” I said, turning to my friend for assistance.

My colleague shrugged. “Sorry, Danica. We won’t be able to do anything without Enzo and his men.”

“But this is an undiscovered German stronghold,” I said. “In 24 hours, we won’t be the only people here. You know that local will already have told everyone about the panel he found.”

“We’re going to pack up and head to the town,” Enzo said firmly. “I’ll see you in the morning.”

An idea came to me.

“Amir, let’s camp here,” I said. “Guard the tunnel. Stake a claim. This is our site, and I don’t want anyone to take it.”

“I would strongly advise against that, Miss Craven,” Enzo cautioned, rubbing a gloved hand against his red brow. “Other than tourists in the igloo resort, nobody sleeps on the mountain. Wild camping isn’t safe.”

“Leave a tent for us, and we’ll be fine,” I promised. “Amir, are you happy to stay with me?”

My partner nodded. “Sure, Danny.”

Enzo growled, barging past us and beginning to pack his equipment.

“We do appreciate your help, Enzo,” I said.

“Y’don’t need to appreciate it,” He huffed. “I don’t get paid to be appreciated. And I sure as *shit* don’t get paid to babysit.”

With that, Enzo Flores and his men began walking down the mountainous slope below us — heading towards the warm embrace of lights in the town.

“I’m sorry, Amir,” I said as we tucked ourselves into our sleeping bags.

He shrugged, smiling. “I respect you, Danica. You’re more dedicated to this line of work than anyone I know. You deserve this find. So, let’s guard it.”

“I’m being paranoid,” I sighed.

“No doubt about that,” Amir chuckled. “But it doesn’t hurt to be safe, does it? We’d kick ourselves if someone were to invade our freshly-dug site. We’ve done the hard work.”

I smirked. “I mean… It was mostly done by Enzo.”

“It *was* mostly done by Enzo,” Amir agreed, and we laughed.

“Thanks,” I said. “You’re always so level-headed.”

“It’s a talent of mine,” He grinned.

As I dozed off, I had never felt safer in my life. Wrapped in a snug, cotton cocoon, I was soothed by  shrieking gusts and the rippling tent fabric. Our tent blocked the entrance to the snow tunnel — the gateway to a hidden WWII shelter. It was the jewel of my career. My life.

That cosy feeling of accomplishment didn’t last, however. Amir and I were woken by a husky bellow in the early hours of the morning.

“What was that?” My friend panted, sitting upright.

“I don’t know,” I breathlessly replied, rubbing my eyes. “It sounded–”

I was interrupted by the sound of snow crunching beneath immense weight. Something too heavy and slow to be human.

“There must be an animal out there,” Amir whispered.

“What animals would be caught in this blizzard?” I asked.

And it wasn’t a person. Neither of us contested that. The crunches were too loud. Though our bodily instincts should’ve kept us inside, our intrigued minds got the better of us. Mother always said curiosity would be the death of me.

Amir cleared his throat. “Do you…”

“– Yes,” I answered before he finished his question.

My colleague tentatively opened the zip to the tent, and we peeked at the darkened mountain, shrouded by an incessant downpour of white flecks. Near the rim of our campsite, illuminated by the tall spotlight Enzo had left behind, deep tracks led through the snow. Something had skirted around the edge of the site. And, for a haunting second, beyond the spotlight, I saw a black shape flit out of view — a towering figure concealed by torrential snowfall.

“Did you see that?” I cried in horror.

“No,” Amir replied, frowning. “What was it?”

“I don’t know,” I said. “It didn’t look like an animal.”

“Well, no person made those tracks,” He said, nodding at the enormous footprints. “It had to be a… I don’t know. What time is it?”

I checked my watch. “Nearly four in the morning. Enzo and the others should be here in a few hours.”

My friend nodded. “Let’s go back to sleep. We’ll stay quiet. If the animal were planning to attack us, it already would’ve done so.”

“Amir, I’ve been thinking about something,” I said.

“What?” He asked.

I paused, nodding at the archaeological find beside my sleeping bag. “This steel panel is crumpled and battered.”

“They had a nasty storm up here,” Amir said. “Bad weather is common in the Bavarian Alps.”

“This German fortress is buried beneath snow. It’s built into the mountain. I don’t think a storm dislodged the panel, Amir,” I said. “Did somebody remove it, perhaps? We might not be the first people to find the shelter.”

“You need to stop worrying about that,” My colleague said. “Nobody’s beaten us.”

“We should find out,” I said, already slipping into my gear. “I certainly won’t be able to sleep now.”

Amir groaned, before nodding and getting dressed.

Torches at the ready, we stepped into the frozen world of Zugspitze, utterly alone in the darkness. No hope of sunlight to guide us for another three or four hours. And I knew Amir was right. We should’ve waited. But I’d been doing that for years. And it had cost me so many opportunities. I wasn’t going to make that mistake again, as reckless as that may sound.

Living was more important than surviving.

“You pointed out that the panel looked like it may have housed ventilation slats,” I said. “The crumpled metal did have that vague shape.”

“Sure,” Amir shrugged.

“So, if it has broken free, that might be another access point to the fortress,” I pointed out.

“But this bunker might be humongous. The ventilation system could be anywhere. You’re not seriously planning on doing more digging at this hour, are you?” He asked.

“As I said, the panel has already broken free — either Mother Nature or another person has already done the digging for us,” I said. “Come on. Let’s look around.”

“Bear in mind that 48 hours of fresh snowfall will have likely covered whatever was uncovered,” Amir noted.

“I know,” I said.

Thirty yards to the side of the tent, there stood a flag — it marked the spot at which the panel had been found. Our starting point for the excavation. The small pole and its flapping fabric were both wearing thick, snowy blankets.

“What are you hoping to find?” Amir asked.

“Think about it,” I said. “A ventilation system missing its slats. That might provide another access point to the bunker.”

“Wait,” Amir said, pointing at a protruding rock-face thirty yards up the slope. “See that?”

I squinted through the snowfall and saw what Amir had spotted. Streaks of red dyed the snow across the limestone face.

I shuddered. “Is that…”

“Blood,” Amir coldly finished. “I was wrong about that animal… It isn’t harmless. We should head to the town.”

I shook my head. “I won’t stop now.”

My friend groaned. “Don’t be stupid, Danica. You’re not going to follow that trail.”

But I’d already started wading through the snow, lighting the way with my torch once I passed beyond the reach of the spotlight.

“For crying out… Danica, you know I’m going to have to follow you,” Amir grunted, trudging after me.

“You don’t have to come with me,” I said. “I just need to see this place before anyone else, Amir. This is our discovery.”

But my colleague ran after me, and we battled against the wilful breeze. The bloody trail continued for a hundred yards, painting a terrible, wavy line across the snow-covered wall. It stopped at a hole in the rock-face — a cavernous hole of twisted metal.

“I was right…” I gasped. “This structure is bigger than we ever imagined.”

“I don’t know how I feel about this,” Amir said. “We should wait for Enzo and the others. It’ll be daytime when they arrive.”

“I’m not going to make you follow me,” I said. “I feel guilty enough for asking you to camp on this freezing mountain.”

“Look, if… If somebody has removed that ventilation panel, then…” Amir sighed. “We’ve already been beaten to this discovery, Danica. It’s over. I’m sorry.”

I shook my head, shivering. “The metal is bending towards us, Amir. Whatever removed the panel, it did so from *inside* the vent.”

I shone my torch’s light into the blackened pit, revealing a rusted ventilation shaft. A metal tunnel that veered quickly to the left. The entrance to the tunnel was partially filled with fresh snowfall. I stepped inside, surprised by the width and height of the vent. I crouched slightly, but it was a broad passageway.

“Danny, please,” Amir begged, grabbing my arm. “Don’t do this… The blood is–”

“– Something’s in there,” I interrupted, gently removing his hand. “Go back to the tent, Amir. Call Enzo. But I’m not going back until I’ve seen the fortress with my own eyes. This is going to be the biggest discovery in archaeological history.”

Amir did not turn around, however. He begrudgingly followed me into the ventilation shaft. Our boots squelched in the snow, and then came the squelch of whatever maroon-coloured gunk lay at our feet — most likely blood, but it was mixed with something.

“I don’t like this,” Amir whispered, his voice echoing around the ceaseless metal chamber. “The stench is unbearable.”

“At least it masks your body odour,” I quipped.

“I’m not in the mood, Danny,” Amir said. “This all feels–”

“– Oh my…” I gasped.

Stopping in my tracks, I looked down at the gaping hole in the floor of the vent. The hole which would’ve claimed me if I’d taken another step. When Amir and I pointed our torches at it, we saw a small bedroom. The quarters of long-gone soldiers. Inside, there were two bunk beds, barely held together by rotting wood, and covered with maggot-ridden mattresses.

The horror of our discovery finally filled my bones, paralysing my spine. And Amir saw that in my stiff, unmoving body.

“You’ve seen the bunker. We were first. We should head back now,” He pleaded. “This isn’t right.”

“No human made that hole,” I said. “No animal.”

“Even less of a reason to go down there,” Amir insisted. “I’m begging you, Danny. We need to leave. Now. Before we find that… thing you saw.”

“What escaped this place?” I asked, shivering. “I have to know, Amir.”

“Danny!” My friend protested as I slipped my torch into my pocket. “Don’t do it…”

“Help me,” I said as I sat and dangled my legs into the opening of the vent.

“I won’t,” He said.

“Well, it’s going to hurt when I hit the floor,” I shrugged.

My colleague sighed, seeing that I wasn’t bluffing, and he placed his torch onto the floor, lighting the tunnel. Then he held my arms tightly as I gingerly slid over the edge of the hole. I felt like a child daring to dip a toe out of her duvet, in spite of the monsters beneath the bed. I placed one foot on the top bunk and lowered my second leg delicately. In a swift movement, I broke free from Amir’s grip.

I screamed as the mattress and supporting wooden planks collapsed under my weight.

“Danny!” Amir cried.

My friend collected his torch and swiftly jumped into the hole, landing with a resounding thunk. As I hazily sat upright, lost in a festering mound of rotten wood and filthy cotton, I noticed Amir hobbling towards me.

“Are you okay?” He grimaced, helping me to my feet.

“I’m fine,” I groaned. “Are you?”

“I think I might’ve twisted my ankle,” My friend said.

I winced. “I’m sorry, Amir. This was… You were right. This was way too dangerous. Come on. Let’s get you back to camp.”

He shook his head. “I’m strong enough to lift you back up, but you’re not going to be able to lift me. No offence.”

“But you need help. What if you’ve broken something?” I asked.

“There’s not a lot that could be done now,” Amir sighed. “This is why I said we should wait until the morning.”

“I know,” I said, hugging the man tightly. “I’m sorry. Have I mentioned that?”

“Yes, but not enough times,” He smiled. “Still, you were right. This… This place is real. And it’s unbelievable. Your favourite word.”

“Are you going to keep saying that?” I chuckled.

“Take the win,” He said.

“Okay,” I replied, smiling weakly. “I told you so.”

“Are you going to keep saying that?” He asked, grinning.

For a moment, we forgot about the sounds we’d heard on the mountain. The blood in the snow. The black shape I’d seen in the distance. None of those things mattered. Amir and I were explorers again. Blind to danger. Jubilant about our astounding discovery.

“Anyway, the best option would be to lift you into the vent,” Amir said. “You should fetch Enzo, then come back here.”

“Look at this,” I said, ignoring my friend. “A journal.”

On a small cabinet at the end of the demolished bunk bed, there sat a dusty, leather-bound book. I blew off the cobwebs and flicked away a persistent spider. The diary was written in German, of course, but I’m fluent.

“The Diary of Conrad Vogel,” I translated.

“That’s great, Danny,” Amir said. “Now, come over here so I can lift you up.”

“Okay,” I sighed, pocketing the journal. “I’ll rush back to camp and phone Enzo. We’ll get you out of here.”

“He’s going to be pissed,” Amir warned, preparing his hands to lift me.

I shrugged, climbing onto Amir’s sturdy palms. “He’s always pissed.”

“This time, he’ll be royally pissed,” He grunted, raising me through the hole.

“Everything will be fine, worrywart,” I said, climbing into the ventilation shaft. “I’ll hurry back. Don’t go anywhere.”

“Funny,” Amir said. “Don’t mind me. I’ll just have a nap on this crusty mattress.”

I hurried through the vent and emerged into the blizzard, which felt merciless after being sheltered by a castle of steel and concrete. I fought against the elements, wading back to the campsite. Once inside the tent, I immediately used the satellite phone to contact Enzo — my mobile wasn’t receiving any signal.

“It’s half four in the morning,” The man muttered from the receiver. “Why have you woken me, Miss Craven?”

I took a deep breath, preparing for a lecture. “Amir and I… found something.”

“What do you mean?” The man growled.

“We heard footsteps, and then we found a trail of blood…” I started.

Enzo paused. “There shouldn’t be any wild animals on the mountain. Certainly not in this weather.”

“It wasn’t a wild animal, Mr Flores,” I said. “The blood led to a ventilation shaft… It’s another way of accessing the fortress.”

“YOU…” Enzo barked, before composing himself. “You explored an uncharted, century-old building without supervision at night. Is that what you mean to tell me?”

“Well, I… We had a little… accident,” I gulped.

I felt Enzo’s rage through the phone. “What happened, Miss Craven?”

“Amir injured his ankle,” I whispered timidly.

“WHAT?” Enzo roared. “Where is he now?”

“In the bunker,” I said. “I came back to the campsite to ask you for help. We have to get him out of there.”

“Stay where you are,” The man growled. “Do not go anywhere without us.”

The phone fell silent, and I had nothing to do but sit and wait. It would take an hour for Enzo to reach me, at the very least. And I didn’t want to cause any more problems. But then I excitedly remembered what lay in my coat.

I scooped the diary of Conrad Vogel out of my pocket.

\*\*\*

***January 2nd, 1948***

*It has been nearly three years since we won the war. Commander Meyer, however, insists that the surface remains unsafe. The Führer has claimed the world, but roaches remain, of course. A resistance that seeks to squash us. Bavaria is at war. That is why we must stay hidden until German forces have come to save us. Hidden in the Tollerberg. Our Führer’s mightiest stronghold.*

*I have doubts, but I will never voice them aloud. Even writing such things will put my life at risk, but I must pen my thoughts. I am losing my mind. I cannot bottle up these feelings any longer.*

*Corporal Fischer died today. I had the privilege of clearing his room. And I found this empty journal in his belongings. Strange that he would never use it. It’s a sign. God longs for me to do something more than fester in this shithole.*

*So, let me get this off my chest. There are two possible truths:*

*The war continues, or we have lost.*

*But we have not won. Why would we still be hiding down here?*

***February 27th, 1948***

*It’s harder to keep up with a diary than I thought. Even with nothing to do down here, the mind wanders. Wanders to strange places.*

*One of the crop rooms failed last week. I don’t know why. Tollerberg is full of advanced technology. Things beyond my understanding. But we’ve got dozens of crop rooms. We’ll be okay. I don’t really care as long as I get fed.*

*But I feel the nearing tide of dissent. People are angry and afraid. And it is not good to be with scared men in a cage. Sure, we have an abundance of food, but how long are we going to stay down here? What happens when more crop rooms fail? At some point, we won’t have enough to feed everybody.*

*I vote that we stop feeding the prisoners. I don’t share the ideals of our Führer, though it is treason to say so. Nonetheless, I hate the British and the French. Let them starve.*

*Commander Meyer told us the crop rooms wouldn’t fail. He told us this fortress would stand for a thousand years.*

*So many lies.*

***March 12th, 1948***

*Another crop room failed. That’s two in two months. Nobody’s going hungry yet, but the murmuring is getting louder. I don't like the thought of an underground mutiny.*

*Not much else to report. Charlotte and I have been meeting in my room when my bunkmates are away. She is a terrible nurse, but an excellent lover.*

***August 15th, 1948***

*Some privates left Tollerberg yesterday. Cowards.*

*I do not know why we are cowering down here. I do not believe in the Führer’s cause. But I know that I love my country. I will never leave the Tollerberg. I will never betray Germany.*

***December 25th, 1948***

*This is the first Christmas I have celebrated in ten years. Commander Meyer senses the furious sentiment of the people. To quell our dangerous thoughts, he has allowed us to honour our Christian traditions. The Führer would not approve. But he isn’t here, is he?*

*I think he might be dead.*

***June 21st, 1951***

*I forgot about this old thing. Life intervened. Death intervened.*

*So many crop rooms have failed over the past three years. And, as I predicted, rations have commenced. So much for Tollerberg lasting a thousand years.*

*Many have rioted, faced execution, and become martyrs for future revolutions. Perpetuating an endless cycle of death. Riot. Die. Riot. Die.*

*We despise the prisoners. More mouths to feed. Enemy mouths. But Commander Meyer tells us that ‘a prisoner equals power’. Why do we need hostages? To me, that is not the statement of a winning side. But I’ve known that for years. The war is over.*

***December 1st, 1951***

*The men are falling sick. The women too, though they have been prioritised.*

*It is the starving who suffer the greatest. Fortunately, we have begun to prioritise Germans when it comes to food. Most of the prisoners are ill. They’re starving and living in dire conditions. But Commander Meyer finally values self-preservation over power.*

*However, he’s starting to lose his grip.*

***March 12th, 1952***

*Doctor Klein says that many of the sick are infected with tuberculosis. They have caught the White Death. An old disease. There was talk of a cure for it towards the end of the war. Though such a thing may exist, it doesn’t exist down here. And the sick are only getting sicker.*

*We are trapped in a tin can.*

***March 30th, 1952***

*The sick have been confined to the west quarter. The armoury. There is one section for German patients and a separate section for prisoners. We will quarantine them there until they die. They have been left with adequate provisions.*

*All I keep thinking is that there will be fewer mouths to feed. And I am glad.*

***July 10th, 1954***

*Much has changed in two years. I found this book whilst clearing my bunkmate’s belongings — I stashed it under his mattress. He would never think to look there. Not that it matters now. His name was Berhtram, and he caught the White Death. No matter how many times we quarantine the sick, the disease always returns.*

*Doctor Klein has been conducting tests. Trying to find a cure. He grows tired of begging Commander Meyer to let us leave the Tollerberg. Like me, he surely knows that there is no war. He knows that we lost. But he would not dare leave this place of his own accord.*

*I don’t think anybody really leaves.*

***November 2nd, 1955***

*I have a reason to unearth this journal once more. Charlotte has given birth to our child.*

*One of only twenty children born in the fourteen years we have spent in this bunker. I have named him Fritz Vogel.*

*I fear for the boy’s life. I pray that Commander Meyer succumbs to old age in the near future. He seems to be the last thread holding this place together. After him, we may even leave this place. Few people believe in the cause of the Führer.*

***November 16th, 1956***

*Each year passes in the blink of an eye. One might expect time to drag in such a place. No. Time does not exist here.*

*Fritz is the only thing keeping Charlotte and me going. But we are lucky. We have more than most. And for that, we are grateful.*

*Our population dwindles. Ten years ago, there were a thousand of us in this underground city. Six-hundred people remain. The White Death ebbs and flows. Whenever we think it has disappeared, it claims another dozen lives or so.*

*But Doctor Klein promises that he is close to a solution. He conducts tests only on the prisoners. That is what he says, anyway. I only fear that his tests continue to put all of us at risk. We shouldn’t be keeping the sick alive. Put bullets in their heads. Eliminate the risk.*

*Doctors think too much. Life is not that complicated. Klein will kill us all.*

***May 7th, 1961***

*It seems I uncover this journal at milestones in my life. And this will be my final one.*

*The White Death has finally caught me. I have requested that I be killed tonight. Killed and cremated. I don’t want to be another one of Klein’s experiments. I don’t trust that he only experiments on the prisoners. The ageing man has claimed for the past seven years to be on the verge of a breakthrough. All I see is a pile of bodies.*

*I only hope I have not passed this terrible affliction to Charlotte or Fritz. I am not a good man, but they are pure people. Charlotte is a woman of conviction. She doesn’t want to be here. She cares only for healing people, as terrible as she may be at doing so. And Fritz is a gentle soul. He doesn’t deserve this life.*

*I pray this place does not eat him alive in my absence.*

\*\*\*

Shuddering at the German soldier’s last entry, I turned the page to find a fresh entry.

\*\*\*

***The Diary of Fritz Vogel***

***October 27th, 1973***

*My name is Fritz, and I don’t know whether anyone will ever read my father’s diary. They will likely never read my logs either.*

*I found my father’s book whilst packing my things and moving to a new room in the south wing. Mother is sad to see me go, and I’m scared too. But I’m eighteen now, and I knew this day would come. Commander Meyer insists that all men become soldiers. All women become nurses or teachers.*

*It seems meaningless. So few of us remain. And I have found it baffling to read my father’s account of this place. Stranger still to imagine a world outside of Tollerberg.*

*Father talked of one thousand people living in this place. Well, more than thirty years later, there are five-hundred of us. And the White Death still lingers, but it’s not the threat it used to be. Of course, we lose people every year. And there aren’t many children. There aren’t many people left to have children.*

***September 8th, 1974***

*I only remember this book when I feel that my feelings might finally bubble over. My father was right. Writing is the only thing that extinguishes the insanity.*

*I’ve been working with Cuckoo Klein in the laboratory. That is what my friends call him, but he doesn’t seem that bad to me. Perhaps I focus too much on my father’s journal entries. He talked of a determined, intelligent doctor.*

*That being said, the old man I see is, admittedly, a little lost. I have been told he still experiments on the prisoners in the abandoned west wing. But they all died long ago. As Commander Meyer said, the war is over. There’s no need to waste precious resources on the enemy.*

*He’s a very different man from the one Father described. Of course, he’s getting old too.*

***February 16th, 1975***

*I was excited to work in the lab. It was better than other soldierly duties. Patrols. Guarding the old armoury in the west wing. Cleaning toilets.*

*But I’m starting to agree with my friends. Doctor Klein makes me uncomfortable.*

*“You are sick,” He tells me. “But I keep you healthy.”*

*Lina tells me that he often says the same to her. She keeps me from losing my head.*

***December 2nd, 1976***

*Mother passed. She caught the White Death.*

*Doctor Klein told me that the old ones don’t have what it takes. Not like the young blood. The post-war babies. I don’t think he should have said that to me. Commander Meyer still tells the obvious lie that the war rages onwards.*

*I’ve asked Commander Meyer to assign me to a different department. It took all of my willpower not to thump the doctor in the face for his callous comments following my mother’s death.*

***November 19th, 1989***

*Thirteen years have passed. A lifetime, in many ways. But life is just as gruelling as I remember.*

*Still, it seemed fitting to return to this diary at a momentous juncture of my life. Much has changed in Tollerberg.*

*I am Colonel Fritz Vogel. I work as Commander Braun’s right-hand man. Not that we have many people left to lead. One-hundred people live in Tollerberg. Father often talked of revolutions and escapees, but we do not fear that. All survivors are either too old to leave or too young to know any other life.*

*Braun and I have discussed it before. Making the call to leave this place. But what lies beyond the fortress? A world that does not belong to the Führer. The Führer is dead. That was what Commander Meyer revealed to us on his death bed. A secret we must keep. I have not even told my wife, Lina.*

*We lost the war in 1945. Ten years before I was even born. And this stronghold is the home of the Führer’s last men and women. The commander was a selfish man. When he learnt that Germany had lost the war, he told nobody in Tollerberg. He continued the lie. Told folk to remain strong and patient.*

*After all, this castle was built to last. Indoor crop fields, water drawn from the snow on the mountain, and a thousand other advanced machines that made this the perfect haven. A home for a millennium.*

*The commander told us that we were finally free to leave. He wouldn’t stop us. But where would we go? This is the only home the children have ever known. If we were to step foot into the outside world, it would reject us. And that is not the only secret Commander Meyer revealed.*

*The prisoners and their descendents are still alive in the armoury.*

*For thirty-five years, Doctor Klein has been conducting experiments on them. The rumours were true. He’s still trying to cure the White Death. And though he has not succeeded, he has developed a treatment. A treatment that he has been giving to children for decades. That’s why we haven’t been getting sick. He gives every newborn baby a ‘temporary’ vaccine, and then he slips treatments into our food.*

*It only works on the young. Something about the vaccine only working on young flesh. It kills the old.*

*Doctor Klein must be the luckiest man on Earth to have worked so closely with infected patients for nearly four decades without becoming sick himself. The man has to be in his eighties.*

***August 31st, 1992***

*Lina and I have just welcomed our baby girl to the world. Ella. The third generation of the Vogel family to live in this godforsaken place. Still, that is nothing short of a miracle in these times.*

*There are seventy-two survivors. Most of the old guard has perished. However, against all odds, Doctor Klein persists. He must be the oldest man in the bunker by a country mile. I imagine he has a picture of Dorian Gray stashed somewhere in his room.*

***April 5th, 1995***

*“You must see my work.”*

*The doctor said that to me today.*

*He has been trying to show me the armoury in the west wing for years. I have refused. Commander Braun saw something in there. Something that made him sick in the head. He took his life.*

*We have no commander now.*

*I don’t want to face the same fate. Klein has told me more than I wanted to hear. It’s horrible enough to know that those poor prisoners of war are still alive. Prisoners of a war that ended fifty years ago.*

*Lina and I don’t believe in any of this. We don’t believe in the things that the Führer said. The idea of a perfect race. What does that even mean? I don’t want to know what things he did. But based on stories from the old folk, we were on the wrong side of history. They wouldn’t say that, of course.*

*There are fewer people to keep things running. Fewer people who know how to fix machinery and grow crops. After Commander Braun died, I disbanded the patrols. This is no army. It’s a group of scared people hiding underground. Too afraid of the world lying beyond the door.*

*Worst of all, the White Death has returned.*

***December 21st, 1996***

*I finally succumbed to the doctor’s demands. I joined him in the old armoury.*

*Over the past year, old age and the White Death have both killed every member of the old guard, other than Doctor Klein. There are roughly fifty people living in this hole. Most survivors are under the age of forty. None of us know of the world before the bunker. None of us know of the world beyond the bunker.*

*Before we die, I had to know what the doctor was doing. And it was far worse than anything I could’ve possibly imagined.*

*The surviving prisoners are the children and grandchildren of the English and French prisoners. They have known no life beyond the west wing. Beyond their cages. But that wasn’t what horrified me the most. The German ward of the armoury is empty. No sick have survived in there. But in the prison ward, Klein introduced me to cages of children.*

*They were bloated beyond breaking point. Gargantuan, bulging people. Not just their bellies, but their limbs and faces. Their skin was green and swollen, as if their entire bodies had developed gangrene.*

*The doctor ignored my disturbed reaction. He began to taunt the children. Spitting in their cage. Calling them vile, sickening names. Telling them that God had punished them for their sins. The very sin of being born in the cases of the Jewish prisoners. My father was a man of God, and that didn’t sound right to me.*

*The children said nothing in response. Just surveyed us with agonised, glassy eyes. Eyes that seemed to beg me for death. Before I even knew what I was doing, I drew my father’s ancient revolver and unloaded all six rounds into the doctor’s back.*

*He did not die immediately. Not like a normal man. But then Doctor Klein was not really a man anymore. Who knows what experiments he conducted to prolong his life? And as I stood over the doctor, who smiled with blood pooling in his lips, he told me a terrible secret.*

*He found the cure for the White Death before I was even born. A cure that he administered to the young folk before we were born. But the side effects could be seen in the cages. The green and blackened children. Doctor Klein told me that he found a way to stop the disease from killing us by binding our minds with the bacteria. Fusing us into a singular entity. The host keeps the disease alive, and the disease keeps the host alive.*

*But that is no kind of life. What happened to those children is not human.*

*He’d been putting treatments in the food of the German children not to fight the disease, but to stop the cure from turning us into monsters like the prisoners. And as Doctor Klein died at my feet, I realised something terrible.*

*Without him, there will be no more treatments.*

As my heart raced, I turned the page to find nothing but manic scribbles. Scribbles that continued over the course of numerous pages. The occasional word or phrase was easily discernible.

*Heat… Warmth… Eat heat…*

Not that it made sense.

My heart raced as I thought about the dark shape I’d seen outside the tent. The looming shadow with ginormous footsteps.

One or more of the Tollerberg residents had survived.

“Amir…” I whispered [fearfully](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle).
