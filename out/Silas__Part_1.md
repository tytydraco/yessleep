No one knows his real name or where he’s from – the locals call him Silas. My father said he’s cursed for robbing the graves of the Poonwa tribe. Some say he protects ancient ley lines from those who would exploit them. Others whisper he’s a collector of souls, taking only those who’ve strayed too far into darkness. Merchants swear they've seen him appear out of the mist on moonless nights, leaving behind a single silver coin as payment for safe passage, or a warning to those who deal in ill-gotten goods.

I never believed the legends. Until I met him on a cattle drive.

It was late spring in 1871, and we were driving 300 head of cattle across the high plains, the kind of trek where the dust sticks in your throat and the nights are colder than they ought to be. The foreman, Old Lyle, had warned us not to stray from the trail, especially near the Poonwa bluffs—a jagged ridge of rock that seemed to breathe unease into the air.

He said it with a smirk, the kind that told you he enjoyed spooking greenhorns like me. "That’s Silas country," Lyle said, the firelight flickering against his weathered face. "If he finds you where you shouldn’t be, you won’t be coming back. Not as yourself, anyway."

The older hands chuckled, but I could tell even they avoided looking toward the bluffs.

I didn’t think much of it until the night we lost a steer. Big, stubborn thing, broke loose from the herd and made a beeline for the ridge. Lyle spat a curse and sent me after it, saying it’d be "a good way to learn some grit." I grumbled but grabbed my rifle and rode out, following the beast’s tracks into the mist that clung to the base of the bluffs.

The air felt heavy, like I was wading through water. My horse, Maggie, snorted nervously, her ears flicking in every direction. I pressed on, muttering to myself about Lyle’s sense of humor. That’s when I saw him.

He stood at the crest of the ridge, silhouetted against the pale light of the stars. His horse was ghostly pale, its breath steaming like smoke in the cold night air. The man himself—if you could call him that—was cloaked in shadow, the brim of his hat low, his gloved hands resting on the pommel of his saddle.

The steer was there too, just standing like it was in a trance. Silas raised a hand, and I swear the beast turned and walked back toward the herd without a sound. Then he looked at me.

I pulled back the hammer on my rifle. His eyes—if he even had any—glimmered faintly, like embers hidden beneath ash. He didn’t speak, but something passed between us, an unspoken warning or maybe a question. My heart pounded as I tried to look away, but I couldn’t. It was like staring into the void and finding it staring back.

After what felt like an eternity, he reached into his cloak and pulled something out. A coin. He tossed it, and it landed in the dust near my feet, gleaming even in the faint starlight. Then he turned and vanished into the mist as if he’d never been there at all.

When I got back to the camp, I handed Lyle the coin. It was old, too old, with strange markings I didn’t recognize. Lyle’s face went pale, and he told me to toss it into the nearest river and never speak of it again.

But I kept it. Fool that I was in those days.

The years that followed were… strange. I drifted from town to town, from one cattle drive to another, the coin always tucked away in a small leather pouch that never left my person. Nothing overtly supernatural happened for the first few years, but then came the dreams. They always started the same way: mist swirling around the base of the Poonwa bluffs, the ghostly pale horse standing on the ridge, Silas’s shadowy figure turning towards me. But the dreams would shift, morph into twisted landscapes of bone and ash, where the sky bled crimson and the earth groaned beneath my feet. I’d wake up in a cold sweat, the feeling of unseen eyes lingering long after the dream had faded.

I thought about getting rid of the coin. But there was something about that coin that called out to me. It wasn't a good luck charm, but a reminder of something that was going to happen.

One sweltering afternoon, five years after my encounter on the bluffs, I found myself in a dusty saloon in a town called Redemption – a name that dripped with irony considering the clientele. I was playing poker, a game I'd become surprisingly good at, when a stranger sat down across from me. He was tall and thin, with eyes as dark and deep as a well. He didn't speak, just nodded and laid down his ante.

As the game progressed, I noticed something peculiar about the stranger. His movements were fluid, almost unnatural, and his gaze never left my face. I felt a prickle of unease, a flicker of recognition deep in my gut. He played with a quiet intensity, his expression never changing, even when he raked in a substantial pot.

Then, during a lull in the game, he reached into his coat pocket and pulled out a silver coin. It was identical to the one Silas had given me, down to the strange markings etched into its surface. He placed it on the table between us, its surface gleaming in the dim light of the saloon.

My heart pounded in my chest. I knew, without a doubt, who this man was, or rather, who he represented. He finally spoke, his voice a low, rasping whisper that seemed to scrape against my bones. “We've been waiting,” he said, his dark eyes boring into mine.

"I… I think I've had enough poker for one night," I stammered, pushing my chair back from the table. My hand instinctively went to the pouch around my neck, clutching the coin within.

The stranger’s eyes narrowed. “The game isn’t over,” he rasped. The other players, a motley collection of grizzled prospectors and weary-looking cowboys, seemed oblivious to the tension crackling between us. They continued shuffling cards and stacking chips, their faces illuminated by the flickering gas lamps overhead.

I forced a laugh, trying to appear nonchalant. “Just a bit tired, that’s all. Long day on the trail.” I stood up, my legs feeling unsteady beneath me.

“Sit down,” the stranger said, his voice soft but laced with steel. The air in the saloon seemed to grow colder, the laughter and chatter fading into a low hum. I hesitated, my hand hovering near the butt of my revolver.

“I don’t think I will,” I replied, my voice barely above a whisper. I turned and started towards the saloon doors, my every nerve screaming for me to run.

As I reached the swinging doors, a hand clamped down on my shoulder, its grip like iron. I spun around, my revolver halfway out of its holster. The stranger stood behind me, his dark eyes burning into mine. He was no longer the languid gambler from moments before. His face was hard, his movements precise and predatory.

“You can’t run from him,” he whispered, his breath hot against my ear. I tried to pull away and the saloon doors swung open, revealing the dusty street bathed in the pale moonlight. For a moment, I saw a flicker of movement in the shadows across the street – a ghostly pale horse, its breath misting in the cool night air.

Panic seized me. I ripped myself free from the stranger’s grasp and bolted out into the street, the sound of his laughter echoing behind me. I ran toward the stable where Maggie was oblivious to my predicament, calmly eating hay. I didn't even bother with the bridle, just vaulted into the saddle and dug my heels in. She exploded out of the stable and onto the main street, a whirlwind of dust and pounding hooves. I looked back, half expecting to see the stranger or Silas hot on my trail, but I was alone. 

Redemption's lights dwindled behind me as I rode into the vast, unforgiving darkness, a chilling certainty settling deep in my bones. My mind drifted to the day I'd met Silas on the Poonwa ridge five years earlier... I knew I'd made a grave mistake.

I should have thrown the coin into the river.
