[When](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gz028c/somewhere_in_nowhere_eggs_and_apples/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) I was a baby, I had borderline insomnia. On the nights mother was desperate, she would bring me out onto the porch, and within minutes of basking in the starlight, I would be asleep. That’s how she used to tell it, anyway. 

It explains why every time I stand on this porch, even during my watches, I feel some level of comfort. Parts of myself are so deeply ground into this house that I can feel it beneath my skin when the old wooden bones creak in the night. 

It had been a few days since I’d first met the beast that haunted my dreams and also that weird cow thing. The rain earlier in the week had somehow left the ground much drier once it all evaporated, and the animals were dustier than tofu in an abattoir. There wasn’t a cloud in sight that morning. As much as I would’ve liked to waste the day away on the porch with a glass of Aunt Jean’s anomalously acquired lemonade, it was Barnyard Bath Day. 

I put the chickens in Bath Jail (a puppy pen placed nearby so I could keep an eye on them, with *Bath Jail* scrawled on a cardboard sign and a shallow pan of warm water inside) and tried to decide who would be my first victim. Either Aunt Jean or a very ineffective cow thief had already brought Milkshake and Dairy Queen to the barn. I ultimately gave in to the fact that it would be best to do the most difficult of my clients first. 

It took three sugar cubes just to get Hephaestus out of the barn and another to keep him from running off when I turned on the water nozzle. He wasn’t scared by any of it; I would’ve found a less obtrusive way to bathe him if he had been. He was just annoyed, like he was with pretty much everything. A bastard, for sure, but a bastard I couldn’t imagine life without. 

Hephaestus, nothing if not predictable, took a solid hour and a half to bathe and another hour to brush out, mainly because whenever I lifted the brush and started to walk off, he would grumble at me. When he was clean, I walked him to the pasture to get some of his energy out and dry off. Then, it was time to reopen the car wash.

Sally, seeing clear evidence that it was Bath Day through the open barn door, stood in the doorway, bleating at me. I knew that the cobwebs on the barn ceiling were a menace, and she was always keen to get her orange hair scrubbed out and brushed.

“Do you want to go next, Miss Sally Ann?”

*Bleat.*

“Oh, I bet you do. You’ve been visiting the roofboards more than usual. I bet you’re Dirt City.”

*Bleat.* 

“Come on over here then, Sally Ann Thunder Ann Whirlwind.”

She yelled at me one more time before trotting over. She enjoyed Bath Day the most and would even let me polish her hooves. Her husband, though… he was an entirely different story. Davy Crockett was big and bad enough to send Black Phillip running back home to his Lake of Fire. And he wasn’t afraid to tell me how much he hated his bath. I almost got a foot right to the face. 

When they were done, I sent them out to the pasture with Heph. Milkshake and Dairy Queen always had to be bathed together. I had never thought that cows could have such extreme separation anxiety before I bought Milkshake. Cows need companions, and my steer French Fry had passed away from old age. I’d gotten her in town for ten dollars, and when I asked why she was being sold for such an insanely low price, the man simply replied with “cow broke” and invited me to lay a hand on her. She was constantly emitting gentle vibrations like she had an engine inside of her. But if she was a robot, she was a convincing one. I named her Milkshake.

If you saw Dairy Queen, you saw Milkshake, no exceptions. They were inseparable. Maybe they were best friends, maybe something more. I was in no place to judge a lesbian cow. 

The last two to be bathed were also a unique challenge. My sow, Hermia, was old and patient enough. But her son, Hamlet, couldn’t stay still to save his life. The little piglet had always been a piglet. 

I asked my dad about it once when we’d kept more pigs. He’d just said, “Little hen, he can’t change who he is any more than we can change who we are. Maybe he just can’t bear to get old.” That was enough of an explanation for me. Not everything needs a reason. Sometimes things just *are*, and that’s alright in my book.

Getting Hamlet bathed always ended with me drenched, and that time was no different. When mother and son were finished, I looked like I’d taken a leisurely stroll into the Amazon Rainforest. Hamlet gave me the most generous thank you of burping in my face before getting the zoomies the second I put him down. 

Once everyone was clean, the sun was already half-hiding behind the treetops. I ensured the Girls were warm and dry after their stint in the bath pan, then cleaned the coop. Hairy had the decency to respect the sanctity of Bath Day, and back in the hens went once it was tidy. I got all the animals back to their designated places, made sure they were fed and comfortable, and then I went to take a bath of my own. Dawson was coming over, and I’d be damned if I let that asshole call me smelly. 

I ran the water as hot as it would go and scrubbed until my already-aching hands cried out ‘no more.’ When I got out of the bath, I was a little wobbly. Instead of realizing how dehydrated I was, I chalked it up to the usual fatigue of a hard day’s work and went to the porch. 

The sun sank behind the pines. Dawson would be here any minute, so I sat down to wait for him. I’d invited him over to watch something with me. I’d meant to start it, but I didn’t trust myself to finish shows on my own. Almost immediately after I sat, everything started to turn bright yellow, and I passed out.  

At some point, lost consciousness turned into groggy half-awareness, then dreamless sleep. The memories of being awake were vague: someone forcing my mouth open, water and oatmeal, and a knitted blanket thrown over me. It wasn’t hard to guess later who it was; only one of the likely suspects was present.

When I woke up, it wasn’t on the porch or even in my bed. I was lying face down in the dirt, and a worm was putting its blood, sweat, and tears into trying to crawl into my nostril. I tugged it out and flung it somewhere into the cornfield surrounding me on all sides. 

A strange smell clogged my mouth and nose, and it wasn’t just worm. It also wasn’t the bloody footprints surrounding where I’d woken up, the massive kind with only one definitive source, even though I could definitely smell the sweet iron. No, the foul smell plaguing me came from the corn itself. On close examination, I could see where the bottom of some of the stalks had turned withered brown and even gray. The sight and smell both meant one thing: death was sure to follow. 

I got to my feet, panic slowly building in me. All I could think of was losing most of the crop. Sure, I got what I needed to survive from the Landlady. But the farm couldn’t function without the money I earned from the harvest each year. Just as I’d decided that was my biggest problem, it was immediately dethroned. 

In the moonless, faint dark of early morning, I saw a wave of grimy black mold sweeping across the ground toward me. I nearly tripped on my own feet as I stumbled back through the row. It followed me until I reached the edge of the field, and then it stopped. I thought that maybe it wouldn’t leave the cornfield. Maybe it couldn’t.

I took a shaky backward step toward the house. The black began to burble like bogwater, almost as if I’d made whatever it was angry.

“Oh, you don’t like that do you? Well I’m gonna go get in my comfy bed and you can stay out here with the Pigman. How about them apples?”

The bubbles solidified as *something* crawled out of the ick. 

This is probably one of the worst times to step back from the action, but I have to share a memory first. When I turned double digits, my mother had a brief but intense “aliens are real” phase. She had a lot of special interests like that. I remember sitting in our living room, patching one of my favorite pairs of jeans, while my mom watched a documentary about Roswell and alien sightings in the Midwest. My mom changed the channel when they started talking about cow mutilation, but I’d seen enough. 

What I saw crawling out of the black was reminiscent of the foggy, gruesome images that memory conjured. Its lower jaw hung loose and broken, missing most of the skin. The right side of its face clung to its skull in bloody shreds, and it had only one cloudy, cataract-filled eye. It huffed as it moved jerkily toward me as if every step caused it great pain. The white speckled along its black coat was not bicoloration but large patches of pale mold. 

I was honestly a little pissed that I was in a standoff with this thing when I could be fast asleep in my cozy bed. Zombie cows were not a planned part of my hot gender-fluid summer. 

“Nice… nice cow. I don’t want any trouble. I bet you’d like some corn, wouldn’t you? Why don’t you just stay out here and have all you want? And I’m going to go back in the house!”

I was about to turn and run for the porch when my foot caught a pothole. I fell right on my ass into the dirt driveway, and then that was when the buzzing started. I could hear flies and feel them trying to crawl in my mouth and nose, even though nothing was actually there. 

“Get the fuck away from me! Go back to Hooven Hell or something!”

The rotten thing moved much faster now that I was down, and its breath smelled like moldy milk carpet. I held my breath, kicked my leg up as hard as I could, and was rewarded with a shower of cold cow intestines all over my knees as its stomach burst like a water balloon. Somehow, it didn’t seem to mind being gutted. It thumped a hoof down hard on my chest, and the air shot out of my lungs with a hacking gasp.

Its own intestines snaked up and out of its open mouth, snapping around my throat, and whenever I ripped one off, another took its place. I kicked and thrashed and finally realized that maybe I should be screaming for help, so I did. If this thing wanted me as its girl dinner, I wouldn’t make it easy.

Just when my vision was darkening, and I could feel its flat, cracked teeth against my nose, we were both bathed in harsh light. I turned and saw a truck barreling down the road toward me and my new friend. It closed the distance at full tilt, horn blaring, and the cow thing released its grip on me and sprinted back into the cornfield. 

I collapsed back onto the ground, and the tires of the red Ford stopped about a foot from my face. My unlikely savior jumped from the truck, with it still running, and scooped me up out of the dirt. Without a word, Dawson threw me in the passenger seat and got back in on the other side, locking the doors.

“Are you okay?!”

I was. I mean, I was definitely a little worse for wear. I couldn’t think of a time I’d ever smelled this bad. But I was alive. And if Dawson hadn’t shown up, I probably wouldn’t have been. As much as it annoyed me to admit, if this had happened even a week ago, I would’ve been burnt toast. But I didn’t tell him that. He probably already knew anyway; it was so stupid how smart he could be sometimes.

“I’m fine. I probably would’ve been a lot more fine if I’d fallen asleep watching Good Omens last night with *someone who was supposed to be here sooner!*”

Dawson sheepishly drove us the short distance back to the house.

“I know, I know. I didn’t just ditch you, I swear! I was coming to apologize, actually. I brought breakfast.”

That’s when I realized what the smell that was slowly invading my nostrils and replacing all the bad ones was. There were few things that could smooth over anger like a greasy McDonald’s breakfast. 

“Well, you’d better have a good excuse.”

Dawson looked around nervously and turned off the truck.

“I’ll tell you all about it, let’s just… get inside. I don’t know if that thing is gone! Oh god, my mom is going to kill me when she finds out I didn’t turn around and speed out of here with you.”

I glanced around before opening the door and making a beeline for the house. Dawson followed with the food, and I let him in first before slamming the door behind us. I wasn’t too worried about anything going after the animals, not yet, anyway. Davy Crockett had enough old man rage to level a building.

“Do you… do you have any idea what that was? Because I don’t. All I’ve got is an undead cow, which… doesn’t feel right.”

Dawson shook his head.

“Bad news is what it is. I’ve only ever gotten the feeling I got seeing that once before. It’s something evil.”

I sat down as Dawson laid out breakfast. Even after what I’d just been through, my appetite was still very much there. I swallowed a mouthful of half-chewed pancakes.

“What did you see?”

He got this deer-in-the-headlights look. 

“When I was little, my family and I were visiting relatives on the Res. I saw something one night, something I shouldn’t have— something evil. My mom doesn’t really like me talking about it with strangers… or with anyone, really. It’s not that I don’t trust you, of course; it’s just…”

“No, no. I get it. We all have to have some secrets. Sometimes, it’s safer that way. Do you think this is the same kind of… thing?”

By now, dawn was breaking, and seeing the first light made me feel worlds better. I had never seen the Pigman during the day, and even if the two weren’t related, it inspired some confidence in me. Monsters didn’t like daylight, right?

“I don’t think so, but it’s nothing good either way. Could we… maybe change the subject, though? At least for a little while?”

“Well,” I said, moving onto the impressive amount of hash browns he’d brought, “we could talk about how you stood me up last night?”

Dawson sighed and drenched his pancake in syrup. After we finished eating, I would have to do my rounds. Even if I was a little angry at him, I was glad to have him here for when I had to go back outside. 

“I was just getting ready to leave when my dad called me to the barn. One of our ewes went into labor, and I… I spent the night elbow-deep in sheep vagina.”

“Sheep vagina?”

Dawson laughed, but it was nervous.

“Yep. I would’ve much rather been elbow-deep in a bowl of popcorn.”

I laughed, too, but for much longer. Then I realized I couldn’t stop. I threw my hands down on the table and cackled until tears sprang up in my eyes, and they decided that this was their party now. The massive hoofprint bruise hiding beneath my shirt ached as I sobbed. 

“Oh, Newport. It was a rough delivery, and by the time mom and baby were situated, and we were done, I went inside and passed out on the couch. I should’ve at least texted. All this is on me. Fuck, I’m really sorry.”

I shook my head and got up from the table. Dawson followed me as I grabbed my shotgun and walked out onto the porch, still unable to stop the tide of tears. 

“It’s not that, Dawson. I don’t care about you playing ovine obstetrician. It’s just…”

It was just that I was terrified for the well-being of myself and of my home. It was just that this rot creature didn’t fit in with any of the usual oddities on the farm— it was dissonant and evil and I could feel in my bones that it wouldn’t be gone for long. It was just that I’d come close enough to death to feel its maw against my face. 

It was just that Dawson had saved my life.

“I’m just worried. Really worried.”

Dawson had been following me around like a puppy, but I heard his footsteps distinctly stop then.

“Hey.”

I turned and looked back at him. He had an expression I’d never seen on him before: stony seriousness. 

“It’s okay to be worried, but it’ll be alright regardless. I can tell this place means a lot to you, and we won’t let anything threaten that— or you.”

Dawson put both hands on my shoulders, and in the firmest, no-nonsense voice, he said:

“Fuck that zombie cow. He’s a little bitch.”

Just like that, he had me laughing again, and this time, the tears didn’t come back. He dropped his hands and smiled.

“Knew I could get you to laugh.”

“Oh my god,” I said, wiping my eyes, “just walk with me. I need someone to share my last cigarette with before I roll some more, and I’d rather not find out if Mr. Night of the Living Beef is a smoker.” 

Dawson started following me again, but this time he kept pace. I lit the cigarette and offered it out to him first. By the time we circled back to the porch, all that was left was smoke on our breaths. 

I heard him walk into the house, but I stayed, making sure the shotgun was loaded and looking out over the path. I could still see the deep tire tracks from when Dawson slammed on his brakes if I squinted. 

“What’re you doing?”

I didn’t take my eyes off the road, but a smile crept over my face.

“You’ve got your secrets. I’ve got mine.”

I gave it exactly ten minutes before standing and turning back. Dawson was watching me, and he probably had been the whole time.

“Keep your secrets,” he said with a dumb grin, “just come finish breakfast with me.”

So we sat in the kitchen together and finished our McDonald’s on chipped china. It wasn’t often that I got fast food like this, and even with it having grown colder than a banshee at her ex’s wedding, I still ate every bite of it.

“So, I’m going to make us some coffee if I can figure out the caffeine dinosaur you’ve got over there.”

He was right. That coffee machine looked like it jumped out of the fifties, but I’d never gotten a better cup anywhere else.

“And then we’ll figure out what we should do next. I would call my mom and ask her, but… I don’t feel like the Mom Voice this early.”

I picked up our plates and looked over where Aunt Jean stood by the hissing coffee pot. 

“Someone beat you to it.”

Dawson caught my gaze and jumped a little when he saw her.

“How did she get down here? I didn’t see her or hear her come down the stairs. Did you?”

“Nope. If you’re hanging around here, you might as well get used to it. Sometimes she’s just… there. And then she’s somewhere else. But her teleportation has never been particularly malicious.”

Aunt Jean walked over and handed him two things. The first was a cup of coffee, which I was expecting. If she had spoken, she would’ve said something like, “Guests always come first in this house, chickadee.” The second was an ice pack.

“Thank… thank you, Aunt Jean. It’s really nice to meet you properly.”

Aunt Jean took on a serious look. She gestured to the ice pack, then to me, before holding both wrinkly hands on her chest. It took Dawson a minute to register the message, but once he did, he came over quickly and with visible concern.

“That thing hurt you bad, didn’t it?” 

The soreness and pain that I’d been trying to ignore for the past hour flared up at his words, but I did my best to deny it.

“I’m fine, I swear. Just some bruises and things I’d have to talk to my therapist about if I had one.”

“I don’t believe you. Take it.”

I stared at Dawson, and he stared at me. Neither of us was backing down— that was until Dawson cheated.

A hard poke in the chest was all it took for me to wince and mutter “fuck,” and Dawson shoved the ice pack into my hands. 

“That was totally unfair, you know that?”

“Yeah, I know. Now ice that.”

As uncomfortable as the chill was, I gave in and stuffed the ice pack into my binder. Seeing that Dawson had won the Ice Pack Battle, Aunt Jean walked over and pinched his cheek like he was an adorable baby. Then, for the first time ever, Aunt Jean spoke.

Well, that’s not totally right. Her mouth formed the words, but the voice that came out of it definitely wasn’t hers. It was a little girl’s, spoken like a child would talk to a dog.

“Good boy!”

I watched Dawson’s cheeks tinge slightly red.

“Yeah, I… I do my best. Someone’s gotta make sure they take care of themself.”

Aunt Jean’s smile widened before she approached me and placed a steaming mug in my hand.

“So we’re feeling talkative today, Jeannie?”

She reached out and gently patted my cheek. I caught the scent of Dove soap, and then she was gone. 

“She’s… quite the character, isn’t she?”

Dawson turned to me and grinned the same dumb grin he got whenever he was proud of himself. It annoyed me how easily I’d come to recognize it in the short time we’d known each other.

“She really is something. I think she likes me.”

I took a sip of my coffee. It was burning hot, but I was still shivering from the ice pack, so a warm stomach for a scalded tongue was a fair enough trade. 

“Don’t get a big head over it. Aunt Jean likes everyone. Well, most everyone.”

Like the bastard he was, Dawson walked over and started washing our dishes from breakfast. It was only two plates, but I was still ready to kick his ass over it. 

“I see where you’re coming from. But let me ask you this. Has she ever spoken to anyone else besides you?”

I wasn’t about to tell him she *hadn’t* spoken to me. I would’ve been jealous, except for the fact that I wasn’t. Aunt Jean and I had a special bond, and I almost always could sense what she was thinking. Words are loud and unwieldy sometimes, and there’s a certain dignity and comfort in quiet companionship. 

“Touche, asshole.”

“Maybe she likes me better,” he says, using that tone of voice that tells me he doesn’t actually believe that but wants to annoy me. 

“Maybe you can take a nice, long walk right into the Grand Canyon.”

“I bet I’d do a good job being you. Couldn’t be that hard, though I might go bankrupt on overalls alone.”

For a moment, I actually wondered if Dawson would do a good job running the farm. All signs pointed to no, but I didn’t necessarily see it as a bad thing. Keeping this farm from going to shit is a difficult job, and it’s made me a hard person. I wouldn’t want that to happen to him. Plus, there’s not much McDonald’s breakfast out here. Or that cereal he really likes. I wasn’t sure I’d like the person Dawson would become if he spent that much time around here.  

“Oh, please. You’d be running out of here in less than a day with your tail tucked between your legs and Davy Crockett hot on your ass.”

“Oh, really? Well, I’ll have you know that your horse likes me better!”

I gasped in mock outrage. I was almost certain that wasn’t true, but I respected the spirit of dramatics.

“How dare you! A curse on you! A curse upon your house! A curse upon your cow! A curse upon your—“

I was interrupted by the Hamster Dance. Dawson and I glanced at his phone, which lay on the table. The screen lit up with the word “Mama.” 

“Looks like your curse worked,” Dawson said with a dry laugh, “oh, she’s going to kill me.”

Then he answered it. The yell that came out of that tiny speaker could’ve been heard clear across the state. There’s no force greater than a worried mother. Other than her yell, all I heard was Dawson’s side of the conversation.

“Yes Mama, I’m fine. No, I’m not outside. I know there’s something bad out there. Yeah, I know, you always feel things like that.”

I snuck into the next room, far enough to be out of the way but close enough to still hear.

“No, Mama, I don’t have it, but— I can’t just leave! Newport will be here all alone and that thing might come back and— no, Mama, it’s not like that! They’re just— Mama, I can’t leave them like that, and... fine. I’ll… I’ll try. But I don’t think it’ll work. I know Mama, I know you’re looking out for me. I love you too.”

After a few minutes of silence, Dawson joined me in the living room.

“Heyyyyy. So—“

“Not a chance. I’m not leaving this farm while that thing is out there somewhere. I don’t think Davy can hold his own for that long.”

Dawson sighed.

“I knew you’d say that. I tried to tell her. But she’s going to have my ass if I don’t go get some sort of protection from her. I usually have my necklace, but I was rushing out, and I forgot it today.”

I picked my shotgun up again from where I had laid it and peeked outside. The sun was warming up the fields, a gentle wind blew through the cornstalks, and I could hear the yellowhammers as they went chee-chee-chee-*squeeeee* amongst the trees. It was turning into a deceptively beautiful day. 

“She said if I want to stay with you, she won’t stop me as long as I get something to protect us. But I’m not leaving you here without a way to go. You can keep the truck, I’ll… well, I’ll walk.”

A gruesome picture invaded my brain at Dawson’s words: him walking down the path, and before he could even make it out of sight, a black and rotting blur tore out of the cornfield and slashed into him, spraying bright red blood everywhere and putting on a gory horror show worthy of an A24 flick.

“No. You’re not walking. If you want to leave me the truck, fine. I won’t argue with you on that. But we’re going to find you a better way out of here.”

I didn’t give him any time to disagree. I just snatched his wrist and pulled him out toward the barn. 

“I already know my truck isn’t going to work. It needs a new radiator and I can’t get one until next month. The four-wheeler has been slow lately, and I don’t think we should take that risk. Um…”

Dawson walked over to the horse stable, just like I was afraid he would. I would’ve rather he rode Beelzebub.

“What about your horse? I’m sure he’s fast enough.”

I scratched the back of my head. Hephaestus could be pretty rough when he wanted to be.

“I don’t know…”

Hephaestus narrowed his eyes at Dawson, but he reached out to scratch his snout. 

“Alright old man, I know you don’t like me. But let’s have a truce for now, okay? I’ve gotta get where I’m going.”

To my surprise, instead of shooting out and snapping at him like the feral dog he was, Hephaestus closed his eyes and sighed. If you’ve never heard a horse sigh in content, I feel sorry for you and recommend you go find a horse at your earliest convenience.

“You do like him better, you bastard!”

Heph actually rolled his big horse eyes at me, like *I* was the dramatic one out of the two of us.

“I wouldn’t take it personally. I’m just the cool uncle.”

I walked over and grabbed the saddle, thrusting it into Dawson’s hands.

“Well, let’s see if the cool uncle can get his saddle on with all his fingers intact. Do you know how to ride a horse?”

Dawson gave me a tilt of the hand that inspired so little faith.

“I know all the basics, but it’s been a while since I’ve actually used them— like… years.”

I pulled out a carrot I’d forgotten in my pocket and had him give it to Heph, hoping we could buy his patience. 

“Well, all I can tell you is good luck. You’re probably going to need it. Time for the saddle.”

To my surprise and continued annoyance, Dawson got it on pretty easily. He’d passed the Horse Test now, too. In fact, all the animals besides me had adjusted to his presence like he’d always been here. Having him around still felt so weird, but the idea of him leaving felt worse than that. It felt bad. I didn’t like to think about it for long, because then the questions I didn’t want to answer started to surface. 

“Look at me, I’m a natural!”

I was brought out of the haze that was beginning to consume me by Dawson trotting around the barn on Heph. Both looked very pleased with themselves. I could tell Dawson was expecting me to come back with some smartass remark, and honestly, so did I. But whatever I would’ve said stayed lost in the useless hunk of meat that was my brain at the moment. 

“Come back, okay?”

Dawson pulled Heph to a stop and stared down at me.

“Because… if you or Heph get splattered across the dirt road up here, it’s going to attract crows, and they’re totally going for the corn next. And that would be… super lame.”

I hated the way Dawson’s expression changed. It got softer, and his eyebrows pinched together. 

“I’ll be alright, Newport. I promise.”

I just shook my head and looked away. 

“Who else is gonna make you pull that annoyed face you’re pulling right now?”

If he had been beside me then, I would’ve for sure taken his tree branch elbow to my ribs. As I turned back to him, I almost felt it telepathically. 

I gave him what some might’ve called a smile. I hated how it sat on my face; it reeked of worry. And my concern for his well-being was none of his business. 

I led Heph out of the barn door, stopping just short of it. The sun was hot, and the air was filled with the noise of Mother Nature, totally unbothered. But with the feeling in my stomach, it might as well have been the deepest depths of night.

“Nobody would do it better. Keep your eyes out for… that thing. I don’t think it’s scared of the daylight, Dawson.”

He nodded, and I laid my hand on Hephaestus’ flank, silently pleading for the old stallion to keep his cargo safe. Then I slapped him on the behind with a ‘hiyah,’ and he tore down off the dirt road with Dawson.

“Look at me,” I heard him yelling as they rode away, “I’m riding a fucking horse!”

I had a sneaking suspicion that he had lied about his history with equestrians, but it seemed like he was managing regardless.

“Don’t yell like that! You’re ringing the damn dinner bell!”

It was hard to tell from how far down he had made it, but I swear he turned back to look at me and winked. I sighed, shook my head, and went back into the barn.

Usually, the animals ate before me, but today hadn’t been a usual day thus far, and my money was on it staying that way. Still, I could tell Davy was getting crankier than an old man who hadn’t gone to bed by seven.

After everyone was fed and seen to, I went inside and made sure all the doors were locked. Then, I treated myself to a decadent lunch of a handful of Cheetos from the bag I picked up in town. The Landlady rarely brought me anything besides healthy food and fresh ingredients, so it was my duty alone to treat myself. Then, I went to shower. I was only just remembering that there was still dried cow gunk all over me. 

When that was done, I busied myself with household chores as best I could. I kept Kurt Cobain’s voice rattling out of my stereo as high as it would go, trying to fight off the nervous *something* that was threatening to crawl up my back in every single moment of silence. I dragged my dustbuster all over the house, glad that I’d finally broken down and gotten Two Tooth Steve to order me a Dyson using just a little of the liquid cash I kept in the lockbox. I tried to be very careful with what I used that money for, but a man can only bust the dust for so long. My days of bunnies under the bed would soon be no more.

Afternoon crept into evening, and something in me knotted up when I had to flick the porch light on. I’d gotten no word from Dawson, not even a text. Not that there was much service out here. Aunt Jean stood by the kitchen window, staring into the gathering darkness. It was hard not to join her, but a nagging feeling in my gut told me that’s what it wanted.

It all suddenly made no difference when I heard Dawson calling my name outside. I was too relieved to think straight for a few seconds, and that was all it took. I threw open the door and raced off the porch like there were springs in my feet. I scanned down the long, lonely path to the main road. Dawson was nowhere to be seen, but I did hear footsteps behind me. They were slow and disjointed. One, two, onetwo, one… two… onetwo, onetwo, one, two… one…... onetwoonetwoonetwo—

I wheeled around as the Rot picked up the pace, sprinting toward me as much as a festering cow carcass could. Broken bone shone white in each of its legs. I staggered backward, with my mind screaming all the while to turn around and run like hell. But everything felt like jelly. The Rot’s gory jaw fell open, letting loose a death wail. Then it closed in on me, coming in for the kill. I shut my eyes tight. 

I expected to hear the squelch of my flesh being ripped off or the wheeze of its breath right against my ear. I wish I had, because what I actually heard was a million times worse. There was the sound of broken footfalls passing me by and Dawson yelling my name. This time, it was actually him.

I watched his smile fall into a look of unabashed fear in real-time. 

The world was suddenly on fire. The feeling of slogging through a jam jar was gone, and suddenly, every move was at warp speed. I was on the porch, off the porch, halfway down the road, sprinting so hard my legs stung. My shotgun was in my hand. When did I grab it? 

I was getting there, but not fast enough. Heph let out the most terrified whinny I’d ever heard, and from where I was, I could see the panic in Dawson’s wide eyes. The Rot was a few more strides and a claw swipe from going all ominous unknown killer on my horse. Everything was a blur of motion after that. The WiFi signal to my consciousness must’ve been extra shitty that day. 

There was a loud crack and Dawson was on the ground and Heph was running back toward the barn without him and Dawson was clutching his wrist to his chest and I was lifting my gun and the Rot was leaning over him and its intestines were wrapping around his neck and *BANG*.

Time jerked to a halt. The Rot wobbled slightly, a massive hole blown into its meaty skull. I didn’t move or even breathe while waiting for it to fall. The only sound was Dawson whimpering quietly.

I shot it, and now it was over, right? Right?
