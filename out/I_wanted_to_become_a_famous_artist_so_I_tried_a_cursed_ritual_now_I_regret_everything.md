Hello, my name is Dave doward, famous artist.

You have probably heard of me due to what's been circulating around the news recently, mostly lies, but I'm going to address that here soon.

I didn't do anything maliciously, after all who *wouldn't* want to be a famous artist? I know I've been trying desperately for years with little to no success.

All of my reviews included shit like "this looks like a five year old made it" or "you couldent PAY me to hang this crap on my wall"

It drove me crazy.

I had poured my heart and soul into my art, and to have it written off as some cheap shit you pass by in a thrift store without a second glance... well, you would probably be at a breaking point too.

I was ready and willing to do *anything* that could lead me to success, when I got a great idea.

Maybe a change of scenery was all I needed, something new to spark my creative fuse. After all, I had been rotting away in my 500 square foot studio apartment, usually looking out a tiny window into the grey distopian city I called "home".

So I decided to take a vacation and kill two birds with one stone by bringing my girlfriend along, who had been begging for ages to get out of the city for awhile together.

This might have all been so different if I had just left her behind.

I booked a cabin in another state for the weekend, hopped on a plane with my girlfriend, then rented a car after we landed. After some difficulties with google maps we miraculously found our way down a lone, barely existent dirt road to the cabin.

Despite the stretch of road looking like nobody had used it in years, the cabin looked fresh and ready for use. In the master bedroom, we even found chocolate hearts on the pillows of the bed with our names printed on the foil.

As my girlfriend was unpacking some of her things in the bedroom, I went ahead and started setting up my easel in the living room, facing the window.

This was a slice of heaven, no cars honking 24/7 or sounds of domestic violence from my neighbors. Just me, my paint brush, and an empty canvis.

*Fuck* was I ever bored.

I couldent paint with all this... this *silence!!* 

Maybe the 24 hour noise was the only thing quieting the critics in my head long enough to get any actual work done.

I tried to calm down, after all, I had only just gotten there and I would have whe whole weekend to paint. Might as well take a breather, and check out the cabin.

There was a huge, heavy looking bookcase next to the furnace just behind me, I had no reception on my cellphone and hadn't had anything like a *gameboy* in my possession since the age of 10, so, fuck it, what else was I going to do here? I didn't even *like* the outdoors! I was starting to feel really stupid about coming here.

I walked over to the bookcase and started following my finger across the top row of books.

Whoever owned this place certainly had a weird taste in literature. "What to do if your goat is the anti-Christ" "How to taxidermy grandma" and "black magic for dummies" were a few that gave me a chuckle. 

I began to pull one out, when a different book caught my eye: "Conquer your dreams today!A winners guide to instant success!"

"Success, and instant you say?" I remember thinking.

"Fuckin sign me up!!" I said as I opened the book and began to read the foreword. 

"Hello, I am doctor marlin, and this-"

I skipped a few pages in.

"My method has a 100% success rate, but be warned, results may be-"

I skipped ahead a bit more.

"Do exactly as I say, and whatever your dream is, will come true without a hitch! May that be a successful lawyer, doctor, artist..."

He had me by balls, I had to keep reading.

"For our first step, you will need some hair from your significant other"

This would be far too awkward of an ask if I went directly to my girlfriend with this, so I went and found her hairbrush in the bathroom and took a handful of dead hair out of it, and returned to the book.

"Very good, next, we will need something valuable from yourself, write your deepest darkest secret down on a piece of paper."

I thought long and hard, would the time I ate an entire box of my roommates cookies and blamed it on his dog count? I had been carrying that baggage since college, I don't even think he even had a dog.

I decided to go with the time I stole my younger sisters pain pills when she had just gotten her wisdom teeth removed, and framed my older brother for it. Our parents kicked him out of the house because he had done something like this before, and he ended up homeless.

I wasn't feeling too great after remembering that, but I kept reading.

"Finally, we need a sacred circle, painted in the blood of a virgin..."

Now where in the hell was I going to find that out here? I groaned and turned the page.

"...but ketchup will do just fine as well."

I couldent help but feel like the book was writing itself as I read it, but I shook that thought off as stupid.

"Well... that's convenient" I thought as I made my way to the kitchen fridge to grab a bottle of *heinz*

It was getting late at this point and the sun was beginning to set. I went to check on my girlfriend but she was already asleep on the bed, passed out with her clothes on.

This boded well for me as I didn't know how I would explain the ritualistic ketchup circle in the middle of our air bnb.

After completing said circle, I decided to check the book for the final step. It said to place the clump of hair and note into the center of the circle and repeat the following words... words that for obvious reasons I will not be sharing with you guys.

When I finished the chant, everything in the circle burst into flame like somebody had lit up some gunpowder.

And that's the last thing I remember before blacking out.

I woke up sometime later on the floor, my head spinning like I had a hangover.

I was just getting my bearings of where I was and what was happening when I looked up and saw the most beautiful painting I had ever seen in my life, painted on *MY* canvas!!

I looked down at my hands which appeared to be stained in paint and came to the conclusion... I must have done it, the ritual must have worked and I was going to be fucking famous!

The style of the painting was nothing like I had ever done before, this was like a Jackson pollock, but so much deeper. 

Now I don't mean to shit on one of the greats but I really fucking mean it, this painting was in a class, untouched by anything else. It was hypnotic.

I analized the colours, and noticed they were nothing like I had ever blended before either. The reds were so deep, oranges so lively and smears of black that just made the whole thing pop.

I ran to the bedroom to show my girlfriend what I had done but stopped short when I had cracked the door just an inch open. I was greeted with the most rancid oder I had ever smelled in my entire life.

I took a deep breath in and held it as I opened the door, then immediately exhaled into a coughing fit as I fought the urge to vomit.

On the bed was my girlfriend, her stomach was hollowed out like somebody had taken an giant ice cream scoop to her abdomen. I inched closer to get a better look because I couldn't believe my eyes.

Her white ribs gleamed in the moonlight creeping in from the window, it shone over her black empty stomach. Making her bones look like teeth in the cavernous maw of a beast.

I couldent beleive it, just as I was about to turn away, something shiney caught my eye. An old iphone was in her hollowed stomach. Retching, I reached in and gingerly fished it out.

I was not fucking prepared for what was on that thing.

I was so dizzy and lightheaded it felt like I floated my way back to the living room couch, I unlocked the phone and it opened to the camera roll where I found three videos.

The first one was a shot from outside the living room, I could see myself finding the book on the shelf and flipping through it, then it ended.

The second video was still an outside shot, I could hear some heavy, raspy breathing that sounded like it came from somebody who smoked with a cigarette in each nostril. The video appeared to be from when I completed the ritual and blacked out, I could see myself crumple to the floor where I layed for a few seconds before getting back up. I could see my mouth moving but I couldn't hear any words. Then the video stopped.

I had a really bad feeling about this third video, but eventually I decided to press play.

The video was over an hour long and started out with a shot of me standing over my sleeping girlfriend with a knife in my right hand. After what felt like hours of watching I saw myself just standing there, I lunged at my girlfriend and plunged my knife into the bottom of her neck, then pulled it down, all the way to her pelvis, then I began pulling her ribs aside and started greedily scooping and shoveling her entrails and guts onto the floor beside us. 

The camera then panned through the open bedroom door to the living room where I could see myself carrying her organs towards the canvas and begin to paint. 

I began squeezing her intestines out all over the empty body of work like I was emptying tubes of toothpaste.

I wanted to turn the video off but I couldn't, it was like being hypnotized. 

I winched as I saw on screen that I began whirling a section of her large intestine over my head like a lasso, while flecks of blood and whatever else splattered across the canvas and room.

The video then abruptly ended and the phone immediately began to access my social media pages and started posting the video to them, I don't even know how this was possible because as I said, there was no cell service at the cabin. I tried everything to close the apps but nothing worked, I even tried smashing the phone to no avail.

I decided to check the book again for some answers to see what the fuck was happening, but when I opened the book... all the pages were blank.

I'm on the run now, the videos have gained widespread attention and started a nation wide manhunt for me.

Everybody knows my name now though, that painting is worth potential millions to the right buyer, it wasn't the way I had imagined it, but in the end, I guess I got what I wanted.

I don't know if there's anything you can take away from my story here, but please, be careful what you wish for.
