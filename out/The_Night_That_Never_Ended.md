**My story began in August 2016.**  
  I was living in an apartment in the city center. After breaking off my engagement, I decided to start a new chapter of my life—far away from the city’s noise and chaos.

My father had inherited a house near the sea.

 Since he lives abroad and already owns another house in a different city, he didn’t pay much attention to that one. I asked him if I could live there, and he agreed.

The idea of moving to a rural seaside house was incredibly appealing. A house in the middle of a farm, rent-free, surrounded by nature... it all sounded perfect.

At the end of May 2016, I packed up my belongings and moved in.

The house was spacious, encircled by a vast garden. I instantly liked it. It wasn’t completely isolated—there were neighbors, but the homes were far apart, like separate estates. Silence ruled the place, broken only by the chirping of birds. I thought I had finally found peace… but the truth was something else entirely.

I spent my days enjoying the fresh air and the beauty of nature, walking through the garden each day. But there was one place I never dared to approach: an old well at the edge of the garden, wrapped in eerie family legends.

Two months passed peacefully, without anything unusual. I would go to work in the city and return in the evenings. Everything seemed fine.

At the start of August, I took a summer vacation to enjoy some time alone.

One hot night, I decided to open the window—for the first time, as I had avoided it for security reasons.

It was midnight. I opened the window, turned the TV up loud, and scrolled through Facebook while listening to music. I usually did this to break the silence of loneliness.

After a while, I heard something outside—voices, as if people were arguing near the well.

I got up and looked out, but the sound stopped. I figured it must have been the TV.

I sat back down… but the sound returned. This time, I turned off the TV and listened carefully. The voices were clear: a group of men arguing.

I rushed to the window, but again—the garden was empty.

Fear crept in. I shut the window and returned to my seat. But the voices came back, louder than before. I couldn’t move—I was frozen in place.

Then I heard an old man’s voice, calling out names I couldn’t make out. I tried to remember them, to understand… but I couldn’t.

Terrified, I turned everything off and hid under the covers, trembling, whispering prayers until dawn.

When morning came, I called my brother and told him what happened. He just laughed and said, “You’re imagining things.”

He visited me later and stayed for the rest of the vacation. Nothing happened while he was there. But something inside me had shifted—I still don’t know what exactly.

What happened that night… was just the beginning.

Months passed. Life went back to normal, and I heard nothing strange again. I started to believe it had all been in my head.

Until one night, I started hearing my mother’s voice calling me from the kitchen while I was asleep.

I’d wake up to silence. At first, I thought it was just a dream, but the voice kept returning—always the same tone, the same call.

A full year after I moved in, I decided to paint the house. I wish I hadn’t.

One afternoon, I was napping while the house was in disarray due to the painting.

Suddenly, I woke up to the sound of doors opening. I thought my brother had come—he had a spare key and often visited unannounced.

But it wasn’t him.

The door to the room was open. A tall figure stood at the threshold, staring at me. I couldn’t make out his features. I was wide awake, completely still.

He wasn’t my brother. I knew it.

And then, strangely—I fell asleep again.

When I woke up, the figure was gone. I called my brother. He told me he hadn’t visited and wouldn’t be coming until the weekend.

That’s when I knew it hadn’t been a dream. It was something else.

But it didn’t stop there.

That figure kept coming back.

Every time he appeared, I couldn’t move at all.

And yet—he never hurt me.

He always wore black.

Sometimes, he would just stand there, staring. Other times, he’d smile.

His face resembled my brother’s... eerily so.

It’s a long story, full of strange events.
