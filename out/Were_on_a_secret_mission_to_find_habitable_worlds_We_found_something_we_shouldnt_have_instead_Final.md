“There it is.” Vitale whispered.

“That’s the city?” I asked back, looking over the edge of the cliff with unease. There wasn’t going to be any easy way down. It was maybe forty meters from our position to the water below, and no guarantee that it wasn’t just filled with rocks under a thin layer of water. The river was rushing by us, thundering down the cliffside with enough force to flatten anything that got caught in it.  Vitale only gave me a nod in response, seeing the same predicament as we weighed our options. The cliffside was too sheer to climb down, no good footholds or anything. There was only one thing we could do.

Our choice was practically made for us by rustling in the tree line further back. The creature had found us again, the low whistles and growls coming from its throat signaling that it was back on the hunt. Something was making it stick to the tree line though, not expose itself outright like back in the clearing. Through the slight glow I could see those dozens of red eyes, small like rubies staring from the wall of a dark mine, giving me a look that screamed of hunger. 

“We gotta risk it.” I said, pulling Vitale closer to the cliff edge. We carefully made our way along the water line, careful not to slip on any loose rocks and take a chance being pulled in by the current. Jesus, I don’t even know if this is water… hopefully it’s not some kind of acid that’s going to burn our skin off…

The loud hiss of the creature brought me out of any worries about what we were jumping into. Acid bath was a pretty good alternative to what I had seen this thing and others like it do to my friends since we crashed on this godforsaken planet…

“Try to hit the water at a right angle, keep your legs straight but DO NOT lock your knees, got it? Don’t tense up. Ever been in a car crash?” I asked her, leading us to the edge right where the water began to fall over.

“Fender bender back in highschool.” She muttered, staring down in total fear. The trees behind us started to crack over the roaring of the waterfall. 

“This is gonna hurt more. Deep breath.” I said, grabbing her and pushing both of us into the air as far over the edge as we could possibly go. Our bodies cleared the waterfall, frothy waters below speeding towards us as we approached. I straightened my body out, unable to force my head over to look at Vitale and see if she was doing the same. I just had to trust her. Okay, don’t tense up, hit the water then float back to the surface… 

It felt like hitting a brick wall after being thrown through the windshield of a car. Even hitting feet first didn’t stop the pain of the water taking over the rest of my body. It threw me around, twisting in the current as it took hold of me, dragging me further down the river. I tried keeping a hand on Vitale but could barely tell where I even was, much less where she could be as the roaring waters ripped her from my grasp.

It took a moment to get myself right but I eventually struggled to the surface, not fighting against the current but moving with it, trying to make my way towards a more shallow area.

Vitale, thankfully, had the same idea. We both got up on the left bank of the river around the same time, sputtering and coughing to try and catch our breath but alive, nonetheless. The thing was up above on the cliffside still, giving those whistle-growls but this time filled with anger and rage. It definitely wasn’t happy bout missing out on two more meals. I think it may have gotten a taste for human after devouring Jacoby.

In the one bit of good events that I’m going to hang onto and cherish with the most fleeting joy I can find- the river was actually drinkable water. I didn’t do this experiment intentionally, instead just going off the amounts I accidentally swallowed while trying to get to the river bank, but I was going to take whatever small victory I could get. We were both dehydrated by this point, and water when your dehydrated tastes like the finest fuckin’ wine I’ve ever had, even if it’s from an alien river that almost killed me.

Only downside to having water after all this time was it reminded me of how empty my belly was. I heard a low growl and started to tense up, thinking there was some other alien thing out there, before I realized it was just my stomach telling me how pissed it was at me for not feeding it. Not much I could do to quell it either, considering there wasn’t any kind of vegetation in sight. Just the glowing city up ahead of us in the middle of a barren desert. The trees up above were the only thing I had seen resembling any kind of earth flora, and even then it was debatable if they were anything like ours. Besides, that’s not even counting what could be poisonous for us to eat, then we’d be in a whole other conundrum.

Nothing to do about it but soldier on, I guess. Vitale and I gathered ourselves, looking up at the cliffside as the creature finally gave up and turned back to the forest it came from. Ahead of us the city was glowing with brilliant blue, beckoning us towards whatever new horror may be waiting for us.

“So how do we find this thing once we get there?” I asked Vitale, hoping for some kind of answer instead of just vague crypticism.

“It’s under the city.” She muttered, eyes focused on the glowing beacons ahead of us. As we got closer I could see that the city wasn’t just jutting rocks but something much more intricate. There were actual buildings carved into these things. Windows looked over us from up high, though whether they were occupied or not I honestly can’t tell. As we approached smaller structures of rocks and whatever crystal was causing the glow began to dot the landscape, leading closer to the huge cluster that made up the city.

The glow was almost blinding up close, but we could finally see that it wasn’t just sheer stone. There was more than windows and doors. There was nothing living in this place, but at one time it must have been something bustling. There was civilization here.

Streets and paths were actually carved in between the huge glowing buildings, with remains of things like stalls, carts, proof that… well, saying people might be the wrong word, but there was intelligent society here at one time, living and bustling along with daily life just like back on Earth.

“Oh my god…” Vitale whispered. “We’re not alone.”

“Well… we might still be alone.” I sighed, taking in the surroundings. Despite the signs of civilization, everything looked like it was in rough  shape and had been for quite a while. What the hell could have done this? Some of the stalls still had small trinkets in them. Others were filled with bones of something, probably some form of butcher shop that people bought meat from… it all looked like it was just abandoned one day, everyone just… left. 

“Come on, we have to find a way underground now.” Vitale beckoned me further, moving towards the center of the city with a renewed vigor.

“What are we supposed to be looking for?” I asked, checking our surroundings. I’ve got to say, it wasn’t relieving having light all around me again. The glowing buildings gave everything this odd blue tint, making it all seem like we were buried deep under the ocean. Almost felt like it got hard to breathe the deeper in we got, especially as the buildings started to crowd in more, roads narrowing to small alleyways as Vitale lead the way towards some unknown passage. 

After a bit she finally stopped, the road ahead dipping down suddenly towards a massive grate that had half the bars broken. Darkness was all I could see inside, with even the bright glow unable to force its way past the depths of black awaiting us. I looked around, wondering if there was anything I could break off to bring as a light source. The buildings in some areas were starting to crumble, and on the flood around them were small chunks that had broken off over time, still retaining their bright glow. Good a flashlight as any, I braced myself before picking it up, afraid it might burn from the intensity of the light. To my surprise though, it was cool, smooth, maintaining the same glow with no heat radiating from it. My awe overwhelmed my anxiety for a moment, turning it over in my hands and getting a feel. It wasn’t necessarily stone but some sort of crystal, almost giving me the same feeling as picking up sea glass on the beaches as a kid. 

Vitale and I shared a look, both nodding before making our way down through the grate. The glow of the stone pierced through the dark, showing smooth stone walls that were almost as black as obsidian. We walked, footsteps echoing in the darkness, making it seem like there were hundreds of us marching downward to our death.

The floor was on a constant slope downward, so much so that I had to keep myself from moving faster because of the steep incline it eventually became. We just kept going down though, the path occasionally winding around and around, turning this and that, making me even more disoriented than I had been back on the sunless surface trying to make my way through the city. 

At some point the narrow pathway widened out, leading us into a chamber where the walls were significantly lighter. As we approached one side I noticed something carved into the walls, though it was in a language I couldn’t understand. Some portions of it were intercut by drawings though. I followed along, trying to get an idea of what the hell this place was, but the more I saw the less things made sense.

The first drawing showed an image of a giant, It was… human-ish, I guess? Tall, arms and legs that were similar to ours but… well, more numerous. The arms were all stretching out from it in every direction, waving like tentacles but ending in human-like hands with long, jagged fingers. The face was human, but instead of just one at the front of the head it had a mass of faces all forming into each other. Eyes, noses, more eyes… it went around the entire head. Each mouth between a set of eyes was filled with teeth and twisted in a mad snarl. Above its head floated a great ball of flame, shining light down on all. Around the giant figure were winged humanoid figures, all looking as if they were guarding it.

The next picture showed the people on the ground being swallowed up by deep crevices that opened. Huge, almost demonic figures climbing out of the cracks as more people fell in. I couldn’t tell for sure, but it looked like the ones falling into the crevices were transforming, some in a halfway state as they were falling down deeper, becoming more demonic as they went.

“Think this is what happened here?” I asked, looking at Vitale as she gazed on in horror at the mural before us. This one was bigger, carved in intimate detail, depicting the giant god from the original, many faces all twisted in righteous anger, striking at a mass of serpentine creatures rising from the depths. There were smaller people like him flying on leathery wings around him, fighting against the demons crawling out that looked a lot like the things that had attacked us, now that I saw the detail. On the ground were hundreds of smaller humans, all being slaughtered by the demonic creatures as they struck back at the ones above. In the background, the massive sun overhead was burning bright, flares bursting off of it like it was about to supernova and leave everything in… darkness.

“It is…” Vitale whispered. “I saw some parts of this in the dream…”

There was no mural depicting the end of the battle, ending on the incredible detail of the serpentine creature emerging fully, extending tendrils up to the heavens as the God struck at it. Whoever or whatever won the battle, I’ve no idea. The losers were very clear though, and there were a lot of them…

Finally, after the end of that mural, there was a small door of stone. A relief in the middle glowed with a deep blue, beckoning Vitale as she held a hand over it, hesitating for a moment before touching. As she did, the glow pulsed, growing outward and moving up the door, opening it from the middle as two halves retracted, showing us the world beyond.

As it opened I could see beyond, a brilliant light coming through. It was warm, like sunlight hitting my skin on a beautiful spring day. It felt like bliss, and as we made our way in, I could see the great star at the center of this world radiating warmth. It lead us out into an even greater chamber, hollowed out with just a small outcropping for us to stand on, a mechanism over to our right for unknown purposes. Before us though, in the chasm, was a small, dying star. It flared out on occasion, sending bands of radiation and flame through the chamber, but never quite reaching as high as we were. As I looked above, I could see that the roof was smooth, carvings on the stone making complicated glyphs and letters in a language I couldn’t understand.

“Is this it?” I asked, looking over to Vitale. She was already heading towards the mechanism though, pulling on one of the huge levers and setting something in motion. As a gear began to turn, the entire cavern started to rumble, making me crouch down and hold onto the floor below me as I tried retreating back towards the door. “What the hell are you doing?”

“Setting it free!” She said, pulling another lever that made things rumble even faster. I could see the sun below flaring up even more as the cave above us began to open towards the pale dusk outside, illuminating the world beyond. The sun began to rise up, moving through the darkness as it waited for the gap to grow larger. For the first time in who knows how long, the sun was about to rise on this planet…

As the door above opened up a tendril of darkness suddenly shot through, piercing into the sun. The massive ball of light began to sputter, and I could vaguely see the image of a great being trapped inside of it, also skewered by the darkness coming through the crack above. The many faces were all pained, in massive terror at what was happening, but it was too late. More and more tendrils of darkness shot in through the widening gap, stabbing through the light and ensuring it would go out forever. Before Vitale knew what was happening she was screaming, looking onward as the previously flaring lights of the sun began to dissipate, the body inside crumbling to ash as the last of the fire went out. 

As it did, the darkness seeped in, oozing over every crevice as the sounds of the demons came from above. 

‘Thank you.” I heard a voice whisper in perfect English, but not audibly.  No, it was speaking from somewhere far back in my mind, running over any mental fences as it invaded my thoughts.

“What the hell?” I whispered, backing towards the doorway as I held the glowing stone up to see. The darkness was everywhere, permeating the depths of the chamber now that the sun was absent. Through it I swear I could keep seeing brief glimpses of something, like stars in the cosmos, but then as the darkness swirled it was swallowed up once more. The dark was breathing, pulsing through as it encroached further on us. I saw Vitale fall to her knees over by the contraption, looking at the ground.

“It… it tricked me.” She whispered. I didn’t have time to respond as the glowing stone in my hand began to fade out, all light leaving it now. I assume the glowing city that was far above us was in the same situation, because no light was permeating through the dark of the world above now. Instead I could just hear hundreds of those things doing their whistle-hisses, signaling to each other that they had won a great victory. 

How I could tell, I don’t know, but I could feel the darkness staring at me intently. It was studying me, waiting for me to make another move. The things above were just waiting for us to come out to where they could reach, likely hearing from their friends how delicious we were after the darkness snuffed out the last bit of light. Too bad for them there wasn’t enough to go around.

“Oh, I won’t let them have you.” I heard the voice again.

“Who the fuck are you!” I shouted, far louder than intended. It got a reaction from the things up above, who started whistling with even more vigor as they heard that I was alive. A rock formed in my throat as life began to flash before my eyes.

“Nothing you could comprehend.” The voice came again. Tears began to form in my eyes, hot, stinging, and definitely against my will. Before I realized it I was sobbing, hoping against some fucking hope I would be able to make it out of here alive. I could hear Vitale doing the same thing a few feet away.

“I’m sorry. I’m so sorry…” She was heaving in forced words between huge gasps for air. The panic was setting in now, with nowhere else to go but flood out.

“Do not be sorry for the weak.” It came again.

Before I knew it, the darkness was moving in on us, obscuring every bit of light around. I felt myself swallowed, suddenly cold as if there were buckets of ice dumped over me. My limbs became weightless, tossed around as I was pulled off the ground, down further into the darkness. I could see the edge of the small cliff in the chamber getting closer through the gloom. I couldn’t do anything to stay away from it though, powerless to resist the pull of the dark. Instead, I fell right over, down into the chasm as itt went ever deeper. It was even worse than the river almost tearing me apart. I didn’t even realize I was holding my breath until it was ripped from my throat in a scream as my limbs were stretched to either side of me, desperately trying to find anything to hold onto. All in vain.

Eventually I stopped struggling back, letting the darkness overtake me as I kept falling deeper and deeper into whatever hell was beyond here. I could only imagine what might be waiting on the other side, whether it was the flames of a biblical hell or just a mass of those damned creatures that killed the rest of the crew. I don’t even know where Vitale is at this point, off somewhere on her own, wrapped in her own blanket of darkness.

I choked. I suddenly felt like I was drowning, the darkness forcing its way into my lungs and flooding them so I couldn’t breathe. Sputtering, I started to flail, arms moving against the heavy force all around me. It felt like trying to run underwater, unable to get an actual hold on anything and desperately trying to fight my way free. Suddenly, before I know it the silence around me in the darkness is replaced by the crashing of waves. I get thrown hard into the ground, surf pounding my body as it washes over me, wave after wave. 

I try to force myself up but fall as another wave hits me. My eyes are closed but I can suddenly hear shouting all around me, snippets of words saying to call an ambulance, asking where we came from, I can’t make out the rest. What I know is that I can feel sunlight on my skin again, the gentle glow breaking through the cold of the water. I open my eyes against the stinging salt water, desperate to see if I was truly in hell, only to see others, humans, gathering around me, hauling my body from the surf.

As I look over I catch a glimpse of Vitale, water spewing from her mouth as she coughs it from her lungs. She looked at me with terror in her eyes, in just the same state of confusion. We know where we just were, know what we saw, so how the hell did we get here?

The last thing I hear before the darkness overtakes me, knocking me unconscious from the ordeal we’ve gone through, is the blare of sirens coming our way, like a loud whistle breaking through the hiss of ocean [waves](https://www.reddit.com/u/googlyeyes93/s/PH7EiE1cmf).
