Before I start with my story, I have to ask something first, oh dear viewer. How far would you go to feel that someone special again, who unfortunately has left this world?

Well, my story is about that. Allow me to introduce myself, my name is Carl√≥ Dore and I do autopsies in my own morgue, we were able to say that it is something like the family "legacy". For my misfortune or fortune I do it alone, I have no one to help me and my father, who I used to attended, he is in a better place.

My loneliness is not due to my profession, my isolation from the world is due to own will, since I consider almost all beings as annoying animals that only exist to generate my livelihoods to survive in this strange world. But this does not mean that I am not interested certain individuals, for example, as well as many male beings eh been interested in women, but no matter how much you look for someone to whom call my equal to share together the beautiful moments of existence I always ended up meeting imperfect beings that provoked feelings of revulsion, so much so that I wished with all my being for the day to see them go through my trade, since in this way I would be calm at knowing that another abomination had been wiped out from this place.

But among all those shadows only one stood out from the rest, my beautiful and magnificent muse, Eleonor. 

I met her in a Coffe Shop, one of those days when the sun stops hide in those gray clouds. My gaze found her through the anima's sea that crowded there as always, with eyes so full of life represented by that sweet mint green was just glorious, It made me feel... alive. Her long brown hair as pure as oak it was so beautiful that not even twenty forests of these trees could even match such beauty. His cinnamon skin was so unique and splendid that I could even dare to compare it to that of a princess from from the farthest and most remote corners of Arabia.

 In conclusion, it was a masterpiece worthy of the greatest artists and craftsmen from the east.

Since I saw her I decided to go every day from now on to see her. Luckily for me, she was always there, always at the same time, sometimes alone, sometimes with a friend or partner, but he was always there. Between his many conversations that I could listen to, I found out his name and a little about his life, such as that he had no family or boyfriend.

I never dared to speak to him, I did not consider it worthy that someone who worked for Hades would gloat over a goddess as splendid as her, but I was content to look at her, sometimes, if I felt brave, I would follow her little down the street.

 It was a sad life, never having the courage to approach the sun that illuminates your shadows, but it was my life and I liked it the way it was... until the tragedy arrived.

One night, she left the Coffe Shop late and I followed her since I felt up to it. Although the streets of this city are not very bright the glow that my Muse emanated was such that you could see for miles thanks to its brilliance. Was a long journey, I always stayed in the corners to be able to admire her without her noticing, but then... he came.

That ruffian who with a deadly cut extinguished the splendor of my goddess, He grabbed his belongings and left, never to return. I couldn't believe it, my muse had been destroyed.

For the first time in a long time I came out of the shadows to see her, her sweet look was off and her blood covered her brown clothes. I took his hand for the first time and I felt it, it was so soft and cold. 

I hugged her in the middle of the shadows while letting out what What was left of the Styx, I blamed myself for not having helped him or for being such a coward for not having spoken to him even once, now she was dead and there was nothing to remedy it... or was it?

A fleeting idea arose from my mind and I took those ruins that once She had been my muse and I took her with me, with all the care and cunning in the world. so no one would see me, to my car.

 I took it to my work and left it in a cold and safe place. Now there was only to do one thing.

 I had a plan in mind, a plan to bring my muse back or at least least something similar, but to do so he had to collect a favor.

 It turns out that I am "friend" of a surgeon who owes me a favor, that favor is I got because I discovered his secret, a very dark one that he will access to what want just to keep it forever buried.

After meeting with him and telling him the situation, I told him my plan to "revive" my goddess. He hesitated, obviously, but I reminded him of his crimes, that the police never discovered and that they locked up and they condemned another thinking it was him; I had proof and enough as to be locked up and condemned. So he reluctantly agree.

The night of the next day my great idea was underway, we were in my morgue, no one would bother us there, he brought all the instruments needed and Eleonor was stretched out on a table.

 I was excited, if this worked I could not only revive my muse, now we would be one as much as I have dreamed since my gaze crossed with her.

 I got ready, I lay down on a table and my great friend put the mask on me of gas, then the shadows of Tartarus took over my sight and finally only observed the shadows to finally fall into the arms of Hypnos.

 I don't know how long I was asleep, but the important thing here is that I was able to wake up, my great friend told me several things about the results and one or another inconvenience that would be solved after a few days. He said that some of my indications were impossible or that I should go with someone else, but who got a temporary solution that left me in a bag.

 I thanked him, I gave him all the evidence about him so that he would do what he was pleased, but to leave me alone and if something happened I would call. He did it, both of the room and the building.

 Look at the bag and take out three objects, green contact lenses, a brown wig and a number of another surgeon. I put my contact lenses and hair in and got up from the table and went to the mirror.  

 They weren't much, but they'll do for now, but there were two things that I wanted to see.

Resurrecting someone is impossible, but my solution was to recreate their beauty to the best of my ability, but there were some things that couldn't be recreated. Their hands and his heart.

I looked at my hands and again in the mirror, now they were part of me, touch my face with his hands and I could feel all his affection and softness, it was as if she was alive. Those hands covered every inch of my face which Very soon will get a redesign. I finally got what I always wanted, a show of his affection and now I felt happy.

But now the best part was missing, I took off my robe and looked at my chest, I smiled with emotion and I cried again, but this time with happiness.

 His heart and mine now lived in the same being, now we were together forever.
