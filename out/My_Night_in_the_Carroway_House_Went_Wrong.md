The Carroway house was there long before I was born. I remember my grandfather telling me how he used to play ding dong ditch, it was a badge of honour who could get the most swears from the irritated homeowners. Grandfather proudly showed off the scar he got from the pan thrown at his head.  The old bungalow loomed over the town high on a hill. At night, its lit windows glowed like the eyes of a beast, watching over us with the patience of an immortal being. Ivy climbed its brick walls like a second skin; trash dotted the overgrown lawn. Beer cans and condoms. Every time I passed it, even from a distance, I could smell the place. The stale scent of mold carried on the wind; it was as if the place was rotting from the inside.

An eyesore, my mother called it, and yet, nothing was done about it. No one condemned it, or did welfare checks on the aged owners. The Carroways had influence my parents said, whatever that meant. From the few glimpses I caught of them, I couldn’t see how. Mr Carroway, a squat man, more fat than sense, always walked around in a filthy wifebeater vest. Grease and coffee stains painted him like a pattern, paired with cargo shorts that revealed pale, balloon-like legs, he looked, for lack of a better term, like an off-duty clown. Mrs Carroway on the other hand, was made from plastic. A barbie doll left out in the sun for too long. Her wrinkly jowls were pulled back with Botox, her gnashing teeth shined like porcelain. Looking at her just felt wrong, especially when she stood next to her husband. A funhouse mirror couple. Every weekend they came into town, Mr Carroway touched everything in the display cases, leaving a trail of greasy handprints in his wake, while Mrs Carroway shrieked her shrill laugh. The town agreed they were a nuisance, but nothing was done. Whether from fear or this supposed influence, I couldn’t tell you. Then, something happened.

Two months had passed; the couple hadn’t been seen since. They were still in the house. Every night, thick black smoke billowed from the chimney, filling the dark sky like fog, permeating the air with an acrid, burnt smell. It clung to your clothes, burnt the hairs of your nostrils. People didn’t care, as long as the couple no longer bothered them. The Carroway house was an old, dilapidated house, owned by a strange couple gone missing. So, why am I writing about it? Because I am going to break inside.

Not by myself, of course, I have friends tagging along. Safety in numbers as they say. Alvin, my next-door neighbour, was a squirrely, hyperactive kid, raised on the iPad. He jumped when I mentioned going to the house, but insisted on filming it.

“Why?” I asked, frowning at his cheap handheld camera,

“For YouTube,” he said, like it was the most obvious thing in the world,

“We could be the next Sam and Colby,”

I scoffed, “Doubt it.”

It sounded like a stupid idea to me, but I let him bring the camera, if only to keep him quiet. If he did upload to YouTube, I doubt it would get many views. He better not do that stupid Wojack face for the thumbnail.

My other friend, Harris Simmons, was, unfortunately, a wimp, no other way to say it. Smaller than the rest of the kids in class, jumping at every sound, and with yellow skin, it made him a prime target for bullies. Born with jaundice, it gave him skin like candlewax, that and his initials earned him the nickname, ‘Homer Simpson.’ Alvin still called him that, much to his chagrin. It wasn’t as bad as the other nickname, ‘Foetal Alcohol Syndrome.’ Besides that, he was a good kid, went along with anything, even exploring a weird, scary house. I asked him if he truly was alright, he once admitted that the Carroways gave him night terrors. Harris nodded, his blond hair flopping,

“I’ll be fine, it might cure me of my nightmares.”

I wasn’t so sure about that. As we walked up the overgrown path, lined by thorny bushes, I could see Harris getting nervous. His waxy skin glowed with sweat,

“Guys, I don’t know,” he muttered, the wind whipping away his words, “This seemed like a good idea during the day, do we have to do this at night?”

Alvin scoffed, “It isn’t night yet,” he pointed his camera up at the violet sky,

Harris tutted, “Whatever, it’s going to be in a few minutes, and what if the old woman catches us?”

“No chance, my brother says she was taken away,” Alvin reassured,

“When?”

Alvin shrugged, “I don’t know, he said she was stalking the streets, singing and chasing after cars,”

“Taken by who?”

Alvin shrugged, “Police, ambulance, nuthouse, does it matter?”

“I guess not.”

Harris wasn’t convinced, biting down on his golden lip. I bumped shoulders with him,

“Hey, try not to worry, if anything goes wrong, we’ll protect you,” I glanced at Alvin, currently doing 360 spins with his eye stuck to the camera,

“Well, I will, anyway.”

Harris offered a shaky nod, shuffling along with his hands clasped. I gave him another reassuring pat, then, Alvin dropped his clunky camera, followed by a torrent of swears. Harris jumped, frowning at their friend.

They traipsed through the overgrown brush, snapping twigs, and crushing beer cans underfoot. The only sound in the otherwise quiet night. Looking back, I should’ve noticed that it was too quiet. We reached the front door, bunched awkwardly on the doorstep. Alvin was closest but instead of reaching for the handle, he just zoomed in and out with the camera. I sighed, even Harris twitched with irritation,

“Maybe it’s locked,” the fear returned full force.

Wordlessly, I grabbed the handle, it turned easily. Harris visibly deflated.  The door swung open with an ear-splitting creak, revealing a wall of darkness. Alvin went first, camera ready, mouth hanging open, then me, pulling Harris along. We stepped over the dark threshold, straight into the maw of the beast.

The moment I entered, the first thing that hit me was the smell. Grease. The stuffy air was thick was it. It was like the walls had absorbed the grease from a thousand meals. The front door led them into the kitchen, the core of the greasy stench. The kitchen was a mess. The counters were piled high with dirty dishes, layered with crusty mold that was once food. Pots and pans congealed with fat, sticking out of stagnant dishwater. The peeling wallpaper revealed dark patches underneath, I peered closer with a grimace, black mold. Finding a light switch, I flicked it, filling the air with the incessant buzz of fluorescent bulbs. It was like stepping into a 24-hour diner.

Our footsteps stuck and unstuck to the floor like Velcro. The windows were decorated with handprints, like after the Carroways ate their fried food, they pressed their hands and faces to peer out the window. Alvin audibly cringed, sticking his camera into the grime. Harris stood in the middle of the tacky floor, hesitant to go further but unwilling to run away.

“They really liked fried food,” Alvin noted, dipping a finger in the congealed in the congealed fat. It left an indent up to his knuckle,

“Ew! Don’t touch it!” Harris exclaimed, Alvin laughed,

“Hey Homer,” he spun round, brandishing his gooped finger at Harris,

“Same shade.”

Harris puffed up with anger, stepping forward to shove him. I ignored them, nauseous from the stench.

We left the kitchen, closing the door to hopefully cut off the smell. It didn’t work. The cold hallway was dark; I thought it was from the lack of light but no, the walls were plastered with black mold. Pulling my shirt over my nose, I gestured for the others to do the same. My father told me about black mold, if you breathed in even one spore, it would settle in your lungs and fester. Killing the pink tissue and shrinking the lungs until you hacked up black muck. Harris had his shirt pulled up to his nose, leaving only his watery eyes darting around. I couldn’t help thinking that his red shirt made him look more like Bart Simpson. Alvin had the camera close enough to the wall to scratch off dark flakes. I slapped him on the back.

“Stop it, asshole.”

As they walked further down the contaminated hallway, careful not to breathe, another sound joined the buzzing cacophony. It was like the crackle of an old TV. They passed a living room, sat against the wall was an ancient cuboid TV, complete with crooked rabbit ears. It was on but no one watched. The screen danced with fuzzy static, background music to our antics. Alvin ran around, chirping and zooming in on everything.

“Look at the state of this couch!”

Plopped in the middle of the room was a red satin couch, dark and shiny from years of use. As I got closer, there was a definite person shaped imprint. Mr Carroway’s fat body was forever embedded in the cushions, flattened by years of sweat and grease.

“Ew!” Harris shouted, peering over Alvin’s shoulder,

“I dare you to touch it, Homer,” Alvin smirked,

“No way, are you crazy? I’ll catch Ebola or something,”

“Aw, come on. Don’t be a loser,”

“How does not touching something gross make me a loser?”

“I don’t know, ask your mother.”

Harris flushed; it only made his cheeks more golden. I sighed, walking away from the stupid argument. I walked around the room, looking at the pictures hanging on the walls. The Carroways throughout the years. The first was of the young couple, in old timey wedding attire. The woman scowled out at him, the husband with his eyes closed, light reflecting off his shiny, bald head. Wait, bald? Mr Carroway wasn’t bald. He had disgusting, matted hair. Hair didn’t just grow back, did it? In the second picture, Mrs Carroway still scowled, with a few lines around her, with her blonde husband, hanging off her arm. No, that wasn’t right either. Mr Carroway had black hair. I didn’t bother looking at the rest, even at a glance I saw there was a different man in each one.

“Jeez, Mrs Carroway sure got around, huh?” I turned to my friends, only to find them still bickering. Alvin pressuring Harris to touch the couch, shouting ‘Doh’ as he did. Harris just seethed, trembling with barely disguised anger,

“If I touch the stupid couch, then you have to stop calling me Homer Simpson,” Harris told him, Alvin smirked,

“Yeah, sure, just do it.”

Harris took a hesitant step forward, like approaching a wild animal. His yellow fingers danced across the crusty couch; the plastic screech of the material set my teeth on edge. Harris barely held back a whine,

“It’s like touching a bald man’s head.”

The mention of bald reminded me of what I found, before I could reveal it, Alvin made another stupid joke,

“Bald like Homer?”

He laughed as Harris shot him a glare. Alvin walked away, still chuckling. I stuck out my foot, and Alvin went flying, him and the camera clattered to the floor. I shot Harris a thumbs up. Alvin grunted, face planting against the wall. He steadied himself with a hand, then jumped back like he was electrocuted.

He yelped, “What the hell?!”

He touched the wall again; his bruised face twisting with confusion.

“This wall is freaky,”

“Yeah, yeah, very funny,” I muttered, gesturing for Harris to follow me,

“No, seriously,” Alvin scrabbled for his camera, “Touch it.” He reached for my hand; I slapped him away.

“Alvin, you’re starting to piss me off.”

Starting to panic, Alvin grabbed Harris’s hand, and pressed it against the wall.

“God damn it, Alvin, I-,” Harris frowned, feeling up the wall. His eyes widened,

“Ugh,” he turned to me, “The wall is soft.”

“Soft?”

The living room walls were plastered with old newspapers, the few bare spots were a sickly shade of pink, mottled with the same mold as the hallway. Alvin raised his camera, pressing a finger to the wall again. There was some give to the wall, it even squished under his touch.

“God, how does that even happen?”

His finger came away shiny, “The wall feels like it’s about to crumble,”

I rolled my eyes, “It’s the mold.”

“It must be all over the place,” Harris said, rubbing his hand on his jeans, Alvin whipped his camera from the wall to Harris’s yellowed finger.

“We better watch the house doesn’t fall around us,” he sniffed his hand, frowning.

The TV buzzed away, the layer of dust added to the sour damp smell. Just as I was about to suggest we leave, my ears picked up another sound.

“Someone’s coming!” I hissed. Footsteps were crunching up the path. I heard a key entering the lock, we didn’t have enough time to run, we were going to have to hide.

“Scatter.”

Alvin ran first, still clutching his stupid camera. Harris didn’t move, rigid with fear. I had to drag him along by his sleeve. I heard Alvin thundering up the stairs, that idiot was going to get caught. I couldn’t even call out to him. Harris found a closet opposite the stairs; we dove inside just as the door swung open. The person lumbered in, their gait uneven. When we got our breathing under control, I cautiously opened the closet door, just enough to peer out. The closet was humid, already sweat dripped down my back, even more when she came into view.

Mrs Carroway. She was back.

“Alvin said she was gone,” Harris hissed, sounding close to tears, I nudged him to keep quiet.

I had never been this close to her. The stink of cigarettes and bacon overpowered the sour dampness. She was old, decrepit, whatever Botox she had had long faded as her face swam with wrinkles. Her cheeks dangled like the jowls of a dog. Her artificial red hair curled into a perm, dye staining her pale forehead, clashing with the lipstick staining her lips. She wore a neon purple windbreaker suit that swished with every movement. Harris gripped my arm, wetting my sleeve with his clammy hand.

Mrs Carroway ascended the stairs at a snail’s pace. Taking each step like it was a herculean effort, her red clawed hand gripped the banister, the wood creaked. Halfway up, she paused for breath, just as a thud came from upstairs. Mrs Carroway tilted her head. I motioned for Harris to hold his breath. Mrs Carroway stood still, hunched over like a hunchback. As I watched her, something flashed in her milky eyes, something that scared me. That, paired with the long pink tongue darting out to wet her lips, smearing the lipstick even more, made me think of a hungry animal.

I felt Harris’s hand slip from mine; he must have been terrified. Mrs Carroway straightened up, her back cracking like a gunshot, then, with speed that belied her age, the old woman rushed up the stairs. Stranger still, she ran up on all fours, her hands slapping the wood. I stared, mouth open, long after she ran-crawled out of sight. After a moment of silence, I poked my head out of the damp closet.

“We need to get out of here,” I hissed. Harris nodded, a quick spasm of fear. We hurried quickly and quietly back to the kitchen. The door had been locked.

“Damn it.”

Another heavy thud from upstairs made them jump,

“Shit, Alvin’s still upstairs,” Harris shivered, his golden skin iridescent with fear sweat. Harris wouldn’t last much longer without breaking down, we had to be careful if we had to get out.

“Harris, I know you’re scared but I need you to go and find another exit.”

Harris looked at me with wide eyes, looking like I just condemned him to death. I was quick to reassure him,

“You just need to be quiet, and go back through the living room. I have to find Alvin, then I’ll find you and we’ll get out of here together. Ok?”

Harris, though he trembled with fear, nodded. I patted his shoulder, ignoring the dampness of his shirt. With that, he hurried off, disappearing into the gloom. Then, it was just me. As the de facto leader, it was my responsibility to get everyone out of here, I would not fail. As I stopped at the first step, I would be lying if I said I didn’t hesitate. The old woman could be waiting just round the corner, ready to grab me, but I had to save my stupid friend. I was going to lord it over him.

The bare wooden steps were hollow, but didn’t creak, thankfully. As the landing came into view, the dim, flickering lights made it look like it was illuminated by candles. The stink of grease was at its strongest up here. The mold had spread to the upper floor. There were too many rooms, too many for Alvin to hide, and the old woman. I listened but couldn’t hear her awkward steps. A trail of yellow led its way into the bedroom, did the couple just carry buckets of grease into the bed? Something stopped me in my tracks; my feet rooted to the floor. There, in the middle of the stained floor, was a battered camera. Alvin’s camera.

I had to warn Harris, against my better judgement, I snuck back down the stairs, hissing his name. I checked the kitchen first, the yellow walls bright enough to burn my eyes. Wait, yellow. The kitchen walls shone as if covered in fresh grease. Mrs Carroway went straight upstairs. The walls, originally covered in newspaper, squished under my touch. The mold was gone, replaced with a new leathery texture. The soft, yellow texture felt clammy, like sweaty skin. I had to feel my way out of the kitchen, feeling nauseous for some reason. I ducked my head into each stinking room, but he was nowhere to be found. Maybe Harris had already escaped? I couldn’t blame him. I crossed my fingers, and headed back up the stairs. Alvin’s camera lay on the floor, untouched.

A shuffling from the bedroom made me jump. Fabric shifted, someone getting into bed. If I was quiet and got to the others before they did anything, we could escape. Where could they be? Alvin dropped it in a hurry, it was still running.

I rewound the camera; its high-pitched whine made me look over my shoulder. The footage was just jumbled scenes at first, telling me that Alvin was running and forgot to turn off the camera. I watched it shake left and right, punctuated by Alvin’s heavy breathing. I watched him try to find a hiding place but each room he ducked into was weirder than the last. The yellow and mold were normal compared to these. The first room was dark, as the camera’s light glinted against the walls, they glistened. The walls were wet, covered in thick, dark sludge, it dripped from the ceiling in thick strands. It was like the room had been submerged underwater.

The second room was another bedroom, plastic wrap covered the furniture, even the bed. Piled high on the surfaces were rolls of stained bandages, dripping something pink onto the floor. I felt like I could smell it through the camera. Alvin’s exclamation rang out from the camera’s tinny speakers. As the camera shifted, a pair of bare feet came into view, bony and wrinkled. Just like a scene from a found footage movie, the camera swung round and Mrs Carroway’s face filled the screen. Her sunken, milky eyes glared, staring at me through the camera. With a sound like a plunger unsticking from a blocked toilet, Alvin was gone. The camera fell to the floor with a thud, the sound from earlier.

From the new crooked angle, I saw Mrs Carroway grab Alvin by the scruff of the neck, lifting him against the wall. Alvin’s face twisted in fear, his mouth opened in a silent scream, impossibly wide, until I thought the skin of his lips would split. I waited for Alvin to push the old woman away; it should’ve been so easy but Alvin didn’t move. His eyes darted frantically, twin orbs spasming in his skull. What was going on? Movement caught my eye; I peered in closer. Something about Alvin’s bare arms disturbed me. The skin seemed to be getting redder. He twisted his head, straining his neck until the tendons bulged. His body refused to follow.

With a sound like Velcro unsticking, Alvin lifted his arm.

His skin remained behind. Like a flesh-coloured sleeve, degloved, gooey like melted bubble gum. His exposed muscles twitched and pulsed, red, wet and shiny. the skin of his arms fused to the wall, slowly sinking into the plaster. Like sweaty skin stuck to a leather couch. His shed skin was gone, absorbed into the wall, and it was taking the rest of him. The wall was absorbing him. It was soft, malleable, he sank through like it was made from wet tissue. The skin was sucked from his body, stretching out to paint the wall. Pinks and reds mixed with the rotted wallpaper. The vivid colours burned my eyes. Alvin didn’t scream; he didn’t make a sound as he was painfully consumed. Swallowed up by the house.

I saw all of this through the camera. I saw Mrs Carroway run a bony hand along the quivering, pink wall, licking her lips as she did. She bent down, picked up his scattered clothes, and disappeared into her bedroom. The camera shook, almost falling from my trembling hands. What the hell did I just watch?

As I struggled to comprehend what just happened, the hair on the back of my neck stood up. I was being watched. Looking up, the camera slipped from my hands. There, staring out at me from the black void of the room was Mrs Carroway. Her head floated in the darkness like a grim spectre, her mouth spread open in a wet, toothless smile, spit dribbled as she smacked her lips. Something radiated from the woman like a stench, something that my body sensed before i realised what it was. Hunger.

She reached out, quick as a flash, bony fingers latching onto my neck. Her touch was boiling hot, searing my skin. She pulled me in close, face to slimy face, spitting as her pink tongue curled out, and ran along my face. She was tasting me. Her tongue writhed like a dying fish. Her breath was acrid, hot, my vision filled with her gnashing gums. Somehow, my panicked kicking made contact with her withered body, her grip loosened. I pushed the witch away. She collided against the wall, knocking over a table in the process. I didn’t waste the chance. I ran down the stairs, taking three at a time. I didn’t bother with the door; I just kicked out a window. The glass sliced at my skin, warm blood trickled down my arms. I didn’t care, I only cared about getting out. Finally out, I collapsed onto the soft grass, the cool night air sobering yet overwhelming my heightened senses. My body broke into violent tremors as a scream built up in my throat. It tore its way out, wrenching my throat as it did. Feeling lighter, I got up on trembling legs and ran. My gait as awkward as a newborn deer. I glanced back only once. There, at the shattered window, was the figure of Mrs Carroway, staring after me. Wide eyed, still smacking her red lips. I didn’t dare look back again.

No one believed my story, at first. They couldn’t disprove it when Harris and Alvin were declared missing. When the police finally went inside to investigate, they came running back out, spewing their guts. My parents refused to tell me anything, all they said was that Harris and Alvin could rest in peace. That didn’t comfort me. The Carroway house was soon spoken with the same reverence as Ed Gein’s house. Human flesh was found in the walls, bones in the bed and furniture. Apparently, they found Mr Carroway in one of the bedrooms, or what was left of him. I heard a rumour that his body was so deteriorated that they had to take in the whole bed as evidence. They couldn't separate him. The greasy smell made so much more sense. Mrs Carroway was taken away by the police, still smiling that dripping smile, even as she was pushed into the cop car. The adults said I hallucinated the entire thing, the house eating my friends. It took years of therapy, I came to accept that fact, but if it was a hallucination, then what the hell was on that camera?

The camera was never found.
