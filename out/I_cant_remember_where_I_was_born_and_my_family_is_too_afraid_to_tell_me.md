To get straight to the point, I moved to the States when I was only four years old. It’s been close to twenty years now, and I’ve had the same questions bothering me for just about my entire life, one which my parents and older sister have refused to answer time and time again. My memories are scattered (seeing as I was only a child), but there are some undeniable facts that I’m sure took place where we all lived.  
  
I lived in an area where it always snowed. It was hard to stay warm at any time during the day/night, so having a lantern in hand or staying near fire was almost mandatory. It was a claustrophobic village, and I remember not ever wanting to leave our cabin because of how overwhelmed I was all the time. Almost every building was made from logs, and although I want to say the village was quite sizeable, my perception of its true size could be off. As for who I knew beyond my family, I can only loosely recall an elderly woman who lived next door to us. This description doesn’t provide much, but being at such a young age makes it hard to recall almost anything.  
  
That being said, there’s a key detail I know to be 100%, undeniably true. Screams, screeches, wailing, whatever you want to call it, could be heard from the surrounding forests at all times of the day… yes, they would never stop. I’m not referring to human screams either. If I were to try, I reckon I wouldn’t be able to point to a reference from any media I’ve seen that could accurately reflect the noises that were apparent in the forests. These wails were far, far off in the distance, but they could still be heard. At night they’d grow a little closer, more prominent, but they were still far enough to where sleep was still obtainable. Otherwise, I doubt anyone could live there for a long time.  
  
Me and my sister were not allowed outside by ourselves under any circumstances. As for the night, no one, not even the adults would go outside. (The adult part is a bit of a blur, but I can at least confirm that my sister was always with me.)   
  
I can vividly remember a night when I needed to use the restroom so badly that the pain grew unbearable. I wasn’t allowed to go to the outhouse, and I was too embarrassed to use the bucket which was placed in the corner of the cabin. I was in a screaming match with my mother and sister, and the ever-present noises from the outside only served to add to the stress. They were terrifying, and I don’t think I was ever comfortable in my early years.   
  
Other than that, there came a day when my family boarded a small plane very early in the morning. My memory of this event is close to non-existent, and it’s also the last memory I have of living wherever this all took place.  
  
I know sometime during grade school I must’ve really scared a classmate since my teacher called my parents and explained to them loosely about what I just wrote above. I was picked up early and received an earful in the car, at first getting yelled at that I shouldn’t be talking about the past, and soon after, getting begged by my parents to never bring it up again. Of course, I’ve asked again and again throughout the years, whether to them or my sister, but now they simply act like they have no idea as to what I’m talking about. It greatly frustrates me, especially since this took place so long ago, but it’s at the point to where I’m so exhausted that I might as well forget about it just like they’ve asked me to. I wish I could provide more information, but my memory is so faulty that anything beyond this is just a guess.
