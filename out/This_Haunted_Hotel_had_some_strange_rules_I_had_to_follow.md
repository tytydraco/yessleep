I had recently taken up a job as a night security guard at the old Belmont Hotel. Rumors had circulated about strange occurrences and ghostly apparitions haunting the halls. I dont believe in paranormal stuff, nothing crazy ever happened to me. So I went to the hotel to start my first night.

The ambient was... to say the least... very strange. The hotel looked pretty old and almost abandoned, that gave me a first bad impression of the place, but i didnt cared about this because as everyone says: "Don't judge a book by his cover". So I fastly moved on and went to the managers office to get the instructions I needed for the shift.

The manager looked pretty nice, the office was pretty different from the rest of the hotel and this room looked a bit more modern, without giving me chance to properly introduce myself correctly, he instantly handed me a set of rules, emphasizing their importance for my safety. I glanced at the sheet that looked kinda normal at first and as I made my way to the tiny security guard office, my eyes narrowed as I read the instructions.

*Rule 1: Never leave the security office unless it's time for a routine check. Under no circumstances should you wander the hotel alone.*

*Rule 2: Take a walk around each floor every hour. If it takes longer than 15 minutes, seek refuge in a nearby room until the time is up.*

*Rule 3: Answer all calls coming through the security room phone. If it's a staff member, continue the conversation. Otherwise, hang up immediately.*

*Rule 4: If you hear knocking on the security office door, hide in the nearby storage closet and do not open the door.*

*Rule 5: If you hear unusual sounds like crying or laughter during your rounds, return to the security office promptly.*

*Rule 6: If you spot a shadowy figure on the security cameras or during your rounds, close your eyes, turn away, and seek shelter in the nearest vacant room. If no rooms are available, count to 360 and then open your eyes.*

*Rule 7: Camera 9 may capture disturbing images. When alerted by a low-pitched beep, maintain unwavering focus on the camera until it turns off.*

*Rule 8: As your shift nears its end, resist the urge to fall asleep. Stay awake and alert at all costs.*

*Rule 9: Keep this sheet of paper with you at all times. It holds crucial information.*

The manager assured me that the rules were essential for my safety, but doubts crept into my mind. Was this just an elaborate prank to test my nerves?

Regardless, I decided to heed the instructions, reminding myself it was better to be safe than sorry.

Hours passed in monotonous routine. I completed my rounds, checked the cameras, and resisted the creeping drowsiness that threatened to overtake me. As the clock struck 3 a.m., a piercing ring startled me from my weariness. I picked up the phone, my heart racing.

"Hello?" I answered cautiously.

A voice crackled on the other end. "It's Emily, the night receptionist. I need your help. Something's not right here."

My breath caught in my throat. Was Emily in danger? I glanced at the cameras, hoping to catch a glimpse of any unusual activity. Yet, everything appeared normal. I couldn't ignore her plea for assistance.

"What's happening, Emily? Are you okay?" I asked, my voice filled with concern.

But before she could respond, an eerie silence fell over the line. Then, a low growl reverberated through the receiver, followed by Emily's blood-curdling scream. The call abruptly ended, leaving me paralyzed with fear.

I dropped the phone immediatly, what happened to emily? is she ok? is this part of the prank?

&#x200B;

I couldnt think correctly at that moment, all I knew is that maybe... if i dont follow the rules... things can go very wrong... something is not right here.
