“Brad, where are the rest of the toys?!” my mother shouted at my father, who was on his hands and knees, frantically assembling a half-premade bicycle.

“I’m sorry, but this was all they had left! There was nothing else… not even board games,” my dad snapped back.

“It won’t be enough… BRAD, it won’t be enough!” my mother reapeted crying out in panic.

“It will be. We just need to…I need you to go upstairs. I think there’s a Monopoly board under John’s bed,” my dad said, tightening the front wheel with a wrench.

“But… we can’t… you said we needed that as a last resort,” my mother said, her breath quickening. Tears of impending doom welled in her eyes.

My dad finished the bicycle and stood up. The fire from the fireplace crackled, casting a glow on his sweat-drenched forehead. He took out a handkerchief and dabbed his head. “Just please get the board and bring it down.”

The clock ticked in the dimly lit room. A Christmas tree flashed colorful lights in the corner. A mistletoe hung lazily from the ceiling, they say all this helps keep it out...it never does.

I knew it was tonight. I’ve seen it for the past seven years… well, I remember the last seven, not my first three. The one night of the year that everyone prepares for…

“Okay, I’ll go,” my mother sighed, tears now streaming down her face. She turned to leave the room and then, in shock, spotted me peeking in from the stairs in the hallway.

“Tommy?! You were supposed to be in bed!” my mother said in shock.

“Let me help, I’m old enough now,” I said with my bravest voice.

“Shhhhh,” my mother was cross. “You’ll wake your brother!”

The clock in the sitting room rang, indicating 1:00 AM. One hour left…
My mother turned in horror, knowing it was coming soon.

“Please, you need to get back into bed! You know what happens if it thinks you’re awake!” my mother ordered, her voice a mix of command and plea.

I reached into my pocket handing her a small dinosaur, a green velociraptor. Small, but big enough to make a difference.

“Where did you get that?” my mother asked, her eyes widening as if she had just seen a million-dollar bill.

“I stole it from the Johnsons’ house when I was with them last week,” I said sorrowfully.

My mother carefully raised her hand and took the 4-inch toy from me. A tear rolled down her cheek, and she smiled, her eyes red and bloodshot from a day of crying.

She leaned over, kissed me on the forehead, and whispered, “Thank you. Now come on, let’s get you to bed.”

My mom walked me up the stairs slowly, quietly, and carefully, trying not to wake my younger brother. No more creaks in the floorboards to wake anyone up. Dad was prepared. As i was ushered up the stares i took one last look at Dad who was in front of the fireplace in the sitting room, using a cloth to shine up the bicycle.

When we got to our bedroom, John was sound asleep. I wish I was that young again. Not knowing was much better than knowing. I got into my bed, pulling the covers up to my neck. I lay on my side, facing the wall, unable to see what was going on behind me in our small room. They say it's best to never look...

Mom leaned over and tucked the covers around me from my toes to my shoulders. She put her hand under my pillow to fluff it out. She then kissed the back of my head and softly said, “Remember, honey, it’s easier to sleep, but if anything ever happens—”

“Yes, I know, Mom. Don’t look at it,” I finished her sentence for her.

I could hear her sniffling as she got on her hands and knees, searching quietly. Finding what she was looking for, she slid out the Monopoly board. Grabbing it with both hands, she stood up quietly.

“Mom?” I whispered, staring wide-eyed at the wall.

“Yes, honey?” my mom whispered back.

“I love you,” I whispered.

“I love you too. Now please go back to sleep. It’s almost time. Please go to sleep,” Mom said, her voice trembling as she held back tears.

She slowly closed the door, turning the key until she heard the click of the lock.
Downstairs, I could still hear Mom and Dad whispering back and forth.

“We need a bigger fire,” my dad commented.

“We need more toys!” my mother snapped back.

“This is all they had left, and we were lucky to even get this,” my dad said angrily.

“It won’t be enough,” my mother sounded like she was losing hope. “Look, the fire will be on, and we will lock the door.”

“And what if it’s not enough? What if it takes them and wants more? We could end up like the Jeffersons,” Mom was panicking.

“We won’t end up like the Jeffersons,” my dad said, annoyed.

A sudden bang came from the roof.

“Quickly, Brad, add more sticks to the fire. It’s already here,” Mom said, hurrying through her tears.

“I know it is. Hurry upstairs!” I heard my mom running up the stairs as Dad left the sitting room and locked the door.
A rumbling noise began in the wall. Dad quickly ran up the stairs and into their bedroom. I heard the key turning, locking them inside.

The rumbling in the wall grew louder as it rummaged down the chimney. I still don’t understand why Dad always puts the fire on… it never works. But I guess we just hoped it would…

The noise from the wall stopped, but only because it was now downstairs. Underneath my room. Searching, snatching, striking. I could hear the bike being fondled with. I heard a loud crash as the Monopoly pieces fell to the floor. Just chaos…

The sound of the door handle downstairs being pressed down again and again… Mom was right… it wasn’t enough.
The door began to bang until it gave in.

Then silence.

After a few seconds, I heard my mom sobbing in the other room. They knew…
The stairs weren’t meant to creak, but because of the weight of… it… the creaking told us it was coming up the stairs.
Another bang. It was trying to get into my parents’ room.

“No, please, GO AWAY,” my mother screamed.

Two more bangs until the door finally gave in!
“No, please don’t! Brad, do something!” Mom begged

“I’m sorry, my love, you were right… it wasn’t enough,” my dad said sadly.

I heard a thump and what sounded like twigs snapping as my mom screamed and sobbed. And then another thump and silence…
I stared at my wall, knowing what was coming next.

Our door only took one big bang to give way. My brother screamed but quickly went silent. I began counting in my head, not turning around to see what was coming for me.
I heard it take two steps over to me. It was directly behind me. I could feel it. I could feel its warm, sticky breath tickle my ear. 

I remained still. I knew my fate; this was it.
But then my pillow began to move, lifting my head ever so slightly. It was reaching for something under my pillow. Whatever it was, I heard it put it into what sounded like a plastic bag.

Then, one step after another, it left the room, down the stairs, into the sitting room, and back up through the wall. I turned around to see if my brother was still there, but all that remained was a pool of blood in the bed. I then went to check on Mom and Dad. One pool of blood at the door to their bedroom and another in the corner of the room.

Police did the rounds, and there were a few families taken this year, including mine. I am blessed to still have my grandparents, who I am now living with. Thankfully, they stockpiled toys from back in the day, so next year should be fine. But there’s one thing I still don’t understand. Why would it take my family and not me?
