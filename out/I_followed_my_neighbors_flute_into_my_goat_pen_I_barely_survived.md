The night I followed my neighbor’s flute into the goat pen is the night I learned animals can dance.



We live in a small community of 5 houses. Most people who are born here die here. That’s why my neighbours' move felt so sudden. At first, I thought this was a rich person trying to buy out the community, but the man came on foot. 



He had but a small backpack and a flute. No expensive clothing, only a big coat. I could barely make out his face when I first saw him.



My wife and I went to visit. Strange sounds echoed through the house as he came to the door, like hooves clacking against a wooden floor. He barely stuck his head out; his hood was still on. He had a weird, almost animalistic odour. I asked if he owns any goats, as I do, but his answer was very dismissive, and shortly after, he said his goodbyes and retreated.



“Wasn’t that strange, Hannah?”



“Yes, but the young man probably wants to be left alone.”



“I don’t know what happened to this generation. We used to have respect for our neighbours and tried to build friendships with them.”



“C’mon Philip, don’t talk like an old, bitter man.”



“I’m not being bitter, I’m just stating the truth.”



A strange occurrence happened the day after the visit. When I went to milk the goats, Farner, the male goat, was eyeing me before I entered. I knew to be wary of all the males I owned, but Farner was usually very calm, so his strange demeanour surprised me. 



I could tell even the females were feeling strange. When I came close, they would tense up and try to move away from my hands when I milked them. 



Then a low, grumbling bleat echoed. Farner stood much closer, pawing at the ground with his hoof. His horns and head were angled in my direction.



I slowly backed out of the enclosure, my eyes fixed on Farner.



I called my veterinarian friend immediately.



Later that day, one of my old neighbours made his way towards my yard.



“Hey Phil, you don’t happen to have found two of my goats this morning, do you?”



“Nope, still only have my four,” I laughed.



“Dammnit. Two of my male goats ran off at night. They were old geezers like us. I don’t understand how they jumped over the fence.”



“Maybe they’ll return. I would wait until tomorrow.”



“Yeah, yeah.” My neighbour muttered and walked away.



That night, I woke up needing to use the bathroom. 



A strange sound carried through the wind. It was a beautiful and ominous melody played by the flute. I’ve never heard anything like it before and was strangely drawn to it.



Soon, I was walking down the hall.



After a few steps, I tried to turn around, but I was being pulled by unknown forces, unable to control myself.



My body then mechanically stepped down the stairs and followed the sound to my animals.



A shadowy figure stood before the enclosure. It had the same coat as my neighbour had. Its head was exposed, and two little horns stood on top of its head. The legs were not of a human but of a goat with large, hairy thighs and hooves at the bottom of them. He was playing the flute and jumping from one to another to the rhythm of his music.



All of my goats were standing on their back legs, too, jumping to the same rhythm.



I walked over the enclosure's fence and started dancing with the goats. It was at this moment that the creature noticed me and stopped playing his flute.



The goats fell to the ground and looked around, confused. The figure hummed a different melody, sounding angered and frustrated. My thoughts scattered as I realised what occurred. The wet mud felt strange beneath my feet. I could smell something coppery in the air.



Before I could fully collect myself, Farner rammed into me from behind, knocking me down.



My face hit the dirt hard. I could feel the cold dirt on my body.



The goats then started jumping on me. I wanted to fight back, but my old body was too weak. All I could hear was the cracking of my bones and the angry bleats of my goats. My wife’s face flashed before my eyes before I fully lost consciousness.



I woke up the next morning in a puddle of mud and my blood. My wife was the one to wake me back to life. At first, I thought she was an angel. The doctor said I was lucky to make it out alive.



It took several days to notice that our neighbour had left his house. It’s been a year now, and he still hasn’t come back. I am still carrying the injuries from my strange encounter.



At night, a heavy rainstorm came. This morning I found hoofprints in the mud. The goats are starting to stare strangely again.
