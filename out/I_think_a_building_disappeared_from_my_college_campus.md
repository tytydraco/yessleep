“Dear university administrators, I am emailing to inquire about a missing building on campus- “, I said out loud to myself, trying to think of an opening sentence.

“No, that’s unbelievably stupid,” I sighed. “Who is going to take that seriously?”

“Dear university administrators, I am emailing to inquire about a building that used to be located between the planetary studies lab and biology building. It was tall, gray, and had no windows- “, I looked at my computer once more and shut my eyes briefly. I rubbed my temples and let the white light of my computer bleed into my eyelids.

“This is crazy. How can I not remember if there was a whole building there or not?” I asked myself, knowing no response will come. I was about to click the lights off for the night when my roommate came stumbling in, drunk from whatever bar he was at.

“Hey Saaaawyeeeer,” he slurred out, trying to take his jacket off.

“What’s up Cole,” I answered back to him, shutting my computer for the night. “How was the bar?”

“Oh same ole same ole,” he tripped taking off his shoes. Steadying himself after his fall, he looked up, “You doin’ homework or something man? It’s two A.M. You gotta know when to take a break.”

I spun my chair around, finally looking at Cole. “No, it wasn’t homework. Uhh, this is gonna sound crazy but do you remember a building that used to be in between the planetary building and the biology one?”

Cole looked around trying to think of an answer, “They destroyed a whole building?”

“No not destroyed; its like the building is just gone. Just think for a moment,” I chirped,  annoyed that he was so drunk, he couldn't even think of a large missing structure.

“That doesn’t even make sense man. Wait, isn’t that where the botanical garden is?”

“Yeah captain obvious, I just want to know if you remember a building being there.”

“No, of course not. You sure you weren’t the one drinking tonight?” He asked almost accusingly, even though Cole knows I don’t drink. “I mean, anyways, man there isn’t even enough room for a whole building there.”

“Yes there is enough room and yes there was one, I’m telling you.”

“Fine, I’ll put a thirty rack on it.” Cole said, with a smirk, slowly coming back to some of his senses.

“Cole, you know I don’t drink.”

“Yeah, I know. That’s why I am betting it; I’ll win.” Cole said, sitting up onto his bed. I swear the only time that man can do something smart is when he is talking about alcohol or football.

“Aight fine. How are we even going to prove that?”

“Easy,” he said sliding off his bed. “Up for a little adventure?”

...

As we walked down the darkened sidewalk, snow blasting our faces like someone adding insult to injury if the garden wasn’t big enough to host a building sized object, Cole took a sip from his beer. Of course, he had to bring one. He doesn’t go anywhere without at least a beer or cigarette in his hand.

“So, Sawyer, why do you even think a building exists here anyways?” He asked polishing off the beer, crushing it and stowing it in his pocket.

“It’s just a vague memory from a time, freshman year, with Klepski. I remembered it earlier today, and then started searching it and couldn’t find a record of it anywhere.”

“You’ve gotta be shitting me man,” he chuckled. “This is gonna be the easiest thirty rack ever. A story about Klepski. Sawyer you probably just had a contact high and hallucinated it.”

Sawyer wasn’t wrong. Klepski dropped out of college at the end of freshman year after having a psychological breakdown on mushrooms and thought the furniture in the room was talking to him.

“Yeah, I know him being in the story isn’t the greatest, but I still don’t think I would make that up, you know.”

“What was even supposed to be going on in this building?” He questioned.

“I don’t know. Like government secrets and shit is what Klepski told me,” I said, kicking at the snow as we trudged along.

“Oh boy, you really spent too much time around that dude.”

As we strolled into the garden the small terrace overhanging it groaned as the weight of the snow piled on top. We looked around only noticing a small group of four people sitting at one of the benches lighting a cigarette.

“Hey man I don’t think a building is here man,” Cole looked at me, staring at the group lighting up.

“Really, you don’t say.”

“I’ll tell you what. Let’s go ask that group over there.”

“Oh come on man you just want a hit of the cig,” I said trailing behind him. Cole could only shrug as we walked across the grass.

We walked up to the group, and without missing a beat Cole asked, “Hey mind if I get a hit?” The one guy shrugged and passed it off to him.

Cole took a large inhale in, and in that moment, two of the guys asked us, “What are you guys doing out here at an hour like this?”

Cole breathed out the smoke and smacks me on the back, “This dumbass thought there used to be a building here. You guys wouldn’t know anything about that would you?”

The small group just looked around at each other, “Sorry man, we’re just freshman. Don’t know nothing about that.” We bid them a goodnight and walked across the garden, treading on the untouched grass.

As we meandered across the grass, I picked up a rock just to toss to myself to keep myself grounded, “Hey man looks like you owe me a thirty rack,” Cole said incredulously.

“How do you figure that?”

“There’s not a building here,” Cole said looking at me like I’m dumb.

“That wasn’t even the bet man.”

“Uhh, yeah. Pretty sure it was.”

I looked around to see if the group was still there before losing my cool. Two girls and one of the guys were still sitting at the bench we just came from, so I had to keep my voice down. “No, it wasn’t. Only if there was or wasn’t room for a building here,” I seethed through my teeth.

“Fine man if you want to be cheap, just say so,” Cole said, producing another beer from his jacket. “It’s getting cold man, let’s just go—”

“Fuck, man,” I blurted out throwing the rock down in anger. But to both of our surprises, instead of the rock hitting soft grass and tumbling, a loud metallic clanging rang out from the earth. Cole and I looked at each other confused and then to the ground. Cole stomped his boots hard on the ground hearing more metallic ringing come back.

“What the,” Cole muttered under his breath. “Uhh, what was that?"

We both began scraping on the cold ground. Feeling the cold seep in through my gloves, I was about to give up when we peel away a large fake patch of dirt. Revealing a large four-foot by four-foot hatch.

We looked at each other and before we could speak, the group of now just three had moved over to us.

“What are you guys doing?” one of the girls asked walking up to us.

Cole patted me on the shoulder, “Going on a little adventure,” Cole said using his strength to open the hatch in the ground. “You guys coming?” he said looking to the group.

“Of course,” the other girl and guy answered, already following Cole down the hatch.

“Coming down,” Cole yelled into the void, climbing down. All I heard back was the echoing of his voice.

Cole paused on the ladder for a second while I stayed up top, “Hey man you coming down?”

“I don’t know,” I whispered back at him. “Is this really a good idea?”

“What, you really want to stick around until security finds us? They already don’t like doing their job. Pulling up a secret hatch is bound to get us in a world of trouble.”

I looked around for a moment before following everyone down the ladder. I paused for a moment while the one guy in the group held me steady so I could seal the hatch again. Being plunged into darkness I could only help but think that I should have just gone to bed earlier.
