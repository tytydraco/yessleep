Day 8:
I never liked it when the cold started to creep in. I always seemed to prefer having warmth. That, and another thing. The cold always seemed to attract them. The creatures. They would always seem to do their tricks when the cold season came. Their invasion. Always unsettled me. The stomping. The clawing. The screams. I always dreaded the first day that snow came. It was always either that day or the day after that they appeared. Their terrors only came out of night. I always tried to sleep but the noises always kept me awake. The noises. One time I caught a face of one of the creatures. I didn’t sleep for 2 days after that. Every time I’ve seen the face in a nightmare I’ve always woke up in a heavy sweat. It is still burned into my memory. No matter how hard I try to ignore that image it always seems to reappear. No fun have come from the creatures. It was around after 11 pm when they made their horrifying screams. One time I let my dog out right when that time struck. I still miss him to this day. I had to do what I had to do. They always stopped when the temperatures started to rise. The day that the snow melted and never came back for months. The noises always ceased that day and never came back. Well, until the next cold season.

Day 9:
The creatures usually only stayed outside with their torment. It was effective enough for me. The crawling on the roof, the scratching of the window, the knocking on the walls. Always freaked me out. But I always knew they would stay outside and couldn’t truly hurt me. That changed. I always locked the doors and kept them locked from 11 pm to when the light arrived. That time when I let my dog out when 11 pm struck. I immediately locked the doors after realizing the time. He was going to die anyway. I didn’t want to go with him. I still regret what I did, but I had to do it. Today it changed. I left one door unlocked. Just one. Just one. Just one was enough to let me in. When I heard the door open I realized what great mistake I made. It was too late. I had to barricade my bedroom door. I had to put bookshelves, chairs, all I could. I heard a sudden bang on the door. The creatures were now here. They violently clawed at the door. I was scared for my life. Just one in and it was all over. It then stopped. The attacks on the door. I wondered what scheme they were planning. I heard something. “Open the door please, I just want to talk.” A voice similar to my mother spoke. I lived alone. My mother has been dead for 7 years. Insanely disturbing. The memories of her fate still haunt me. The call from her. The noises I heard from her side of the call. Then a loud bang. Then screams of terror. The screams of pain. That’s the last I heard before she hung up. I then heard the doorknob making noise. Sounds very violent. What are they trying to do? OH NO THEY OPENED THE DOOR WHAT THE FUCK NO NO NO
