Now this may sound like a tall tale considering the millions of voices being actively recognized in the world in this modern era of digital communication and connectivity. And sure, for every weird new thing there is a new AI being made, I am sure you know what I am talking about.

But, there is something out there, actively making people forget.

Forget what you may ask?

And the answer I have for you, is people. Us. Humans.

I don't know how it is being done, if it is targetted or systemic, or why it is happening.

I know for a fact that ***we*** are forgetting. And, ***we are on the way*** to being forgotten, ourselves.

Let me lay the facts on the table.

I found an entire conversation thread from someone named "Sarah Mitchell", 3 months back. And I do not know who that was. Perhaps I was unable to recall. But it was there on my phone, and it is me, who had apparently chatted with this person, almost daily, for an entire year. I went through the entire thread, and it has everything I would say to someone I met up with and would be trying to befriend. I talked about my hobbies, the books I was reading that month, this new movie that came out that I wanted to catch in the theatre... and they in turn had told me all about their pet, a cute dog, their plans to start an orphanage, eventually, and even shared pictures of us, together, outside for lunch.

Mind you, I am of sound mind, trust me, I had the doctor check me out, and no big chunks of my memory missing, here.

So how come Sarah Mitchell, is non-existent? There are no records of her. I searched far and wide. I went through the entire internet, perhaps they used a pseduonym? Perhaps. And I had made my peace with it, but then my mother called up the other day asking how my trip with Sarah went. I knew no others with that name, and I ended up asking my mother how and what she knew. And she ended up telling me about all the texting we did and how we became closer, and she ended up giving me some letters, handwritten, written on sheets torn from some diary from 2014, slipped into impartial white envelopes when I met her later on. From Sarah, she had said, although there were no names or addresses on these envelopes.

I forgot about them for a while and spent my time with my mother well. But later on when I was back home, I found the letters again and decided to read them.

**Letter #1**

*Hey Alexis,*

*If you are reading this, then that means I am no more. But I am not sure if you will even know that.*

*I do not know what is going to happen, I only know that the future is bleak.*

*The last time I went out, no one recognized me. My landlord brushed right past me, my sister-in-law did not even have a hint of recognition when we bumped into each other at the grocery store. My favorite librarian told me that there was no "Sarah Mitchell" registered in the Central Library, and I almost cried right there, in the middle of the library. I do not know if I have the courage to come to meet you, I think it would hurt me deeply if you had forgotten me too.*

*Perhaps I am writing in the hope that you would eventually remember, but in case you do not, I will not hold it against you. But if you are ever wondering, what happened to 'this significant human in my life until some time back', then I want you to have all the information.*

*I want you to figure it out.*

*I do not want anyone else to suffer like this, not even my worst enemies.*

*But, if you do not remember, then perhaps you will need some kind of proof that I exist and this is not just some nonsense prank right?*

*Go to the address that's behind this page, and read the next letter.*

*So long, dear friend.*

*S.M.*

P.S: Give this letter and a $50 bill to the person on-duty when you get there.

|The address.|
|:-|




The address on the page led me down to a storage unit where the person in charge just handed over a key and promptly went back to looking at the computer, as though I did not exist.

In the storage unit 315, there was hardly anything, but a few folders, a super old blood-red rag cloth in one corner, and a weird looking lump of cloth on the paper folders.

I opened the lump of cloth only to be assaulted with the most rotten smell I have ever smelt, it was too bad that I simply closed it and set it aside.

Among the folders I found the second letter. This time it was addressed to Alexis Leighton, my full name.



**Letter #2**

*Hey Alexis,*

*If you are reading this, then I am worried for you, because not many have been able to recognize what is happening to me, but those that have? They are having the same thing happening to them as well… Please be careful, do not let this get worse.*

*I am going to tell you what is in that cloth, I am sorry you are having to see the remnants of what were my unborn foetus, Annalise. I had to remove her out of myself when my gynecologist, or the doctors, basically stopped responding to me, it feels like I am being invisible to the entire world. I had been bleeding for hours, and no one noticed my screams for help, my cries of horror. Eventually, once my dear Annalise was out, I thought I should give her a proper burial, mourn her loss with rites and everything, but one of the others urged me to give her to you. Annalise is definitely dead, but she is the only proof that I exist, now. I am unsure when you will eventually be able to find me, and how long it might be by then, and what stage I might be at.* 

*The other day when I tried to look up Todd, my neighbor, there were no signs of social media, or anything (I had been actively following him on FB for months, and he is super active there about his dogs). I did see him out today in his backyard, but his dogs didn’t seem to recognize him, continuously barking at him, while he looked on, hopelessly.* 

*I think the stage when we eventually disappear is nearing, I know for a fact that my sister disappeared. All our childhood photo albums exist (online things can be doctored/photoshopped but no one would go to the extent of making everyone around me act, nor make up an entire human being in my formative years and include them in my childhood albums), but I am unable to remember anything about her. It feels like I lost a part of myself, even if I do not ever remember having a sister, which is weird. I am too worried to call my mom and confirm, if she ever forgets me, I feel like I would just give up fighting then and there, just wait for it all to end. I have always loved and respected my mother, and I wish I could have had her support during this period of slow withering away…*

*We have formed a group, to meet each other, and update about the stages… One of the support group members stopped coming recently, and we wouldn’t have remembered him if not for the handwritten letters he had posted for the next meeting, reaching us. We believe that people are being erased by their digital footprint, and slowly but steadily, their souls. What remains is handwritten proof, and analog stuff… although people tend to ignore the belongings of forgotten people, and write it off, as always having been so. Digital aspects remain too, but there is not weight in them, knowing those can always be faked, in today’s world.*

*The human brain… it lies. It uses the image available to fill in the gaps in understanding- this leads to visual illusions… and similarly, it seems to be fill in the gaps of these… erasing of humans.*

*For we do not know what else to call it. Why is it happening to me? To us? What did we do to deserve such a gradual, and brutal erasing? And why must it come for us, randomly? What did Mr. Todd, or Mrs. Linton do to deserve it?*

*We tried to find specific “common risk factors” of sorts, and the only thing we could come up with was that we all had shared a particular common post, on our FB accounts, a few months back, about a public notice disclosure for some municipal issue, I remember even you had shared it from my account, and I am worried for you, Alexis.* 

*If the world ever forgets me, please at least try to remember me… and if you forget me as well, please remember me as your friend, Sarah, the architect.*



*With loads of love,*

*S.M.*

My hands were shaking by the time I finished reading. I quickly put everything in the storage unit into the bag I brought, including the foul-smelling bundle, and vacated the unit. As I was leaving I remembered the tip she mentioned in the previous letter, and went to the guy who had directed me to the storage unit. 

“Here, take this”, I hand him the $50 note I had specifically brought as per Sarah’s previous letter. But the rude worker kept staring at his computer, unbothered. He seemed to be playing a card game online.

“Hey!” I raise my voice and flap the note in front of his face and… no reaction. Not even a blink. It was like he was staring right through my hand into the computer monitor.

I leave the note on his table, and slowly back out, seeing if he noticed it or not, from time to time… 

He never did.
