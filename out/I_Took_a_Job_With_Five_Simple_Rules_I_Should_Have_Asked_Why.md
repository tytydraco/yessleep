I was broke. Credit cards maxed, rent overdue, eating ramen three times a day kind of broke. So when I saw the listing—**"Overnight Clerk Needed – $200 a Night, Minimal Work"**—I didn’t hesitate.

The ad was vague. Some kind of record-keeping job for a private estate. No experience required. No background check. Just five simple rules to follow. Sounded easy enough.

I applied. Got the job the same day.

I should have asked why.

My new workplace was an old Victorian house sitting on the outskirts of town. Three stories tall, all dark wood and stained glass, the kind of place that looked like it had **secrets in the walls**. My boss, a frail man named Mr. Alden, met me at the door. He had pale, papery skin and watery gray eyes that barely seemed to focus.

“Follow the rules exactly,” he said in a voice like dead leaves. “That’s all we require.”

He handed me a card with the rules typed neatly in bold black ink.

# THE RULES:

1. **At midnight, the front door will open on its own. Do not acknowledge what enters.**
2. **Between 1:00 AM and 2:00 AM, you may hear someone calling your name from upstairs. Do not respond.**
3. **If the phone rings at 3:15 AM, do not answer it. Even if it says your own name on the caller ID.**
4. **At 4:44 AM, the grandfather clock in the hall will chime. Close your eyes and count to ten. Do not open them early.**
5. **You must leave before sunrise. If you see the sun rising through the windows, run.**

It felt like a joke. Some weird rich guy’s idea of a test. But two hundred dollars for a night of ignoring stupid rules? **I could handle that.**

I settled into the dimly lit study, lined with books that smelled like dust and something else—something older. The only sound was the slow, steady ticking of the grandfather clock.

Then, at **exactly midnight**, the front door creaked open. The house was empty. I knew it was empty. But the moment that door swung wide, **I felt something step inside**. The air grew thick, suffocating. My skin prickled. I forced my eyes down to my hands, gripping the desk. **Do not acknowledge what enters.**

I didn’t move. I didn’t breathe. Something passed by the study door. I didn’t see it. But I **felt it.** The floorboards groaned under its weight. A whisper of something cold brushed my skin. Then—silence.

At **1:37 AM**, I heard my name.

A woman’s voice, soft and sweet, drifting down from the third floor. “Come up here,” she called. “I need to show you something.” A chill crawled up my spine. **Do not respond.**

The voice grew insistent. Pleading. My throat tightened as my own voice threatened to **answer back**. I clamped a hand over my mouth. I wanted to scream, to run, but I **stayed still**. Eventually, the voice faded.

At **3:15 AM**, the phone on the desk rang.

I nearly jumped out of my skin. The old rotary phone vibrated against the wood, rattling like a dying thing. I stared at the caller ID.

It was my own name.

My hands shook. **Do not answer.**

The ringing stopped after the third chime.

At **4:44 AM**, the grandfather clock let out a deep, hollow chime. The room tilted. The air thickened like tar. Shadows stretched unnaturally, creeping toward me.

I shut my eyes. **Count to ten.**

One. The floor creaked.  
Two. A breath tickled my ear.  
Three. Something whispered in a language I didn’t understand.  
Four. Cold fingers brushed my arm.  
Five. The walls shuddered.  
Six. A voice, right behind me: **“Look at me.”**  
Seven. My body trembled, muscles locking in place.  
Eight. My heartbeat pounded in my ears.  
Nine. My name, spoken in a hundred voices at once.  
Ten.

I opened my eyes. The room was still. The clock stood silent. The shadows were **normal** again. The house had **reset**. I checked my watch. **5:55 AM.** Just a few minutes until I could leave. I had made it. But then—**the sky outside started to lighten.** A deep, primal fear gripped me. **I had to go.**

I grabbed my bag, bolted for the front door—**but it wouldn’t open.** The lock twisted, the handle rattled in my grip, but the heavy wooden door **would not budge**.

The windows flared with a golden glow. The sun was rising. I turned, heart hammering. The study door was open. And Mr. Alden was standing there. “You should have left earlier,” he murmured. My stomach dropped. **I had followed the rules.** Hadn’t I?

But then I saw it. On the desk.

A **sixth** rule. One that hadn’t been there before.

**6. You must leave before 5:55 AM. If you fail, you belong to the house.** A hand closed around my wrist.

The sun spilled through the windows, touching my skin—**and everything went black.** I woke up in the same chair. The study looked the same. The clock still ticked softly. But something **was different**. I reached for my phone, but it wasn’t in my pocket. My bag was gone. The house was quiet, waiting.

And then—The front door creaked open.

**Midnight.**

I heard the floorboards groan as something stepped inside. A voice drifted down from upstairs, soft and familiar. “Come up here,” it called. “I need to show you something.” My own voice.

The realization slammed into me like ice water.

I wasn’t the visitor anymore.

**I was part of the house now.**
