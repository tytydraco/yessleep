I went back. That thing had to die, and it was going to be me. 

   Since last time, I armed myself a little better, I drew out the little money I had and bought a better gun than the antique I had been using. 

  A blackened metal piece with wood furniture, a pump action shotgun. It and a box of shells ran me almost my entire savings. When the guy at the counter asked me what I was using it for, I froze.

  Nervous thoughts racked my mind, flash backs of that beast, until I managed to force out the word hunting.

  The ride to the farm was hell, visions and memories of that thing swam in my head. Every few feet I could have sworn I saw it moving in the corn, but it was just my imagination, I hoped. The sun was just setting, and it was deathly quiet as I stopped at the house.

  I tried my best to prepare myself, climbing into the hayloft of the barn, which was now devoid of any animals. And I waited, tucking myself in one of the corners with a sightline towards the house. 

   Waiting was agony, cold sweat ran down my forehead as I hid, half wanting it to come, half wishing it was all a nightmare. But that nightmare came true when I saw something big, much too big to move that fast, cutting through the cornfield like a shark.
  
   I watched it raise up, white skin stretched over a thin, bony frame. It stalked forward, legs bent and creeping on all fours. It walked circles around my truck, like a bloodhound finding a scent. And when it did, it began moving towards the barn.

  As it came closer, I prepared myself, rising up into a crouch. It practically dragged its eyeless, skull like head across the ground after me. When it reached the barn it let out a terrible hiss, whipping around searching for me, its prey.

 I crept to the edge and raised my gun, levelling it with the creature and squeezing the trigger. But as I fired, it jumped at me, the shot only clipping it. It slammed into the loft but didnâ€™t make it, falling back down.

 I racked another shell in and ran to the edge, firing again and hitting it somewhere in its gut, it let out a scream and ran off, leaving a trail of gore behind it. Shaking and trying to calm myself, I loaded my gun and sat for a minute before climbing down and following the thing.

  A flashlight in my teeth and a gun in my hands, I followed the trail of blood to the old house, and into the cellar. I threw the rusty double doors open off the ground, and descended. I walked over stripped bones of different sizes, from small to larger than mine. 

 I could hear it breathing. 

   Labored and heavy, I saw it at the end, hunched over and bearing its teeth, it roared deafeningly with rotten meat on its breath. I screamed back, firing my gun as I did, emptying it shot after shot into the limp body of the creature.

   It was only after calming myself and moving towards the body I could hear the crying, pitiful and shrill, it was coming from some kind of structure behind the now dead beast. In it, was a small white being, its head much too large to raise, its body thin with pale, near translucent skin. 

  Im writing this from the cellar, what do I do? Do I cover this up like my grandpa, or finish what I started and kill it?
