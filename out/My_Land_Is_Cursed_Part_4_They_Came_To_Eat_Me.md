I haven’t been on Earth for nearly a week. Not by choice– trust me, I may not fear many things but space is 90% of them so fuck it in its entirety. This one's gonna take a bit to finish. I’m still rusty at writing, writing these has gotten some of my mojo back, and I want to give you my best here. 



Something had recently dawned on me. After posting the last part, I reread it to make sure I had spelled everything right and see if my grammar was in order– although I should, I don’t proofread– when I grazed over the last paragraph. I wrote it without thinking very much, just tossed the thought on the page. But, rereading it, it felt like someone standing in my ears screaming for attention. My dreams, the carousel of nightmares I had been living with since I was able to plunder REM. They were coming to life and dying by my hand. The gangly and inhuman humanoid at the foot of my bed, with me since 3, left after burning the corpse of the entity below my bed. Running across a lawn only to be caught and torn apart by snarling piles of shifting rotten meat but never dying, with me since 4, left after euthanizing the last Mockingbird. Sharpened branches plunging through my body as I crucified on a tree with fire roaring below encircled by figures, with me since 2, left after crushing the throat of the cult leader. 



The nightmares I faced and conquered were the nightmares I conquered in my youth. Noticeably, one I had never gotten over was the same dream I had the night of my last post. 



Figures, thin and wrong, taking me from my bed and pulling me into the sky. Their slick skin holding me down as they peeled me open layer by layer, inspecting each carefully, only to be forced to repeat the filleting after the flesh grew back. My head was removed from my shoulders and awake to watch as they sampled me, refining their pallet. The worst part was they found me a delicacy. 



Of all my dreams, that one made my body soak with sweat and my heart sprint. Being enjoyed by another thing. Unfortunately, I’m too smart for my own good and understood what this meant. 



“Tony girl, eat up.” She still refused to eat the overpriced wet food, but was more than happy to inhale a bowl of ground beef. As she slobbered away, I readied my arsenal. 



Honey Lavender Shampoo, Mint Coat Oil, Coconut Paw Scrub, Peanut Butter Protective Toothpaste, Aloe Ear Lotion, and most dangerous of all, Doggie Soft Butt Wipes. Tony side eyed the empty room as she ate. Pulling away from her empty bowl to search the room. For upstairs she heard the faintest crinkle of a bag, her treat bag. Like a rocket she flew up the stairs and burst into the bathroom to see the bag balanced on the edge of the tub. She staked over to into and bumped the bag to the ground with her snoot. The door shut just as she realized the bag was empty.



“It's the end of the line, pooch. You’re getting in that tub.” I clutched the shampoo tightly as Tony lowered her stance like she was ready to pounce. “Don’t try it. It won’t work this time.” She leapt at me, tongue first. My back slammed against the door and she licked my face. “Nope! No! You won’t win!” I swept her back legs and spun on to her back, picking her up and dropping her into the bathtub. I lathered her fur with shampoo as she mean-mugged me. I had to refill the water 5 times from the amount of blood and dirt in her coat. She didn’t protest for long and even fussed after I stopped scrubbing her paws with the purple solution.



Drying her off was the next war I had to wage. I fought each of her attempts to shake and even employed a blow dryer to finish the job. “Good fight.” I shook her paw. “Here.” The Milk Bone barely left my pocket before she had already snatched it. “Good dog, go on, get.” I patted her on the rear as I opened the bathroom door. 



A lance of high frequency hit and exploded my eardrum. Blood poured out of my ear and vomit spilled onto the ground. “Starting a little soon.” I grunted. I was quick to clean up and was able to hear again after a few seconds. It was coming that night. I just knew it. I knew that no matter what I did, I was gonna get taken. All I could do was prepare. I carved open my stomach and put blades under my organs, tools of many varieties stuffed into layers of fat on my sides, and hid a P320 zip tied to my rib cage. Immortality is a curse to most people, personally despite how much I love my father I made him a promise that’d be the one to kill him and he promised the same but jokes on him, and if I’m not afraid to lose him then I doubt I would be for anyone.



After bleaching the blood and letting my organ settle around the blades, I got ready for bed. After showering and perfuming I found myself unable to go up the stairs to bed. I was stunned at my rigidity. Metal stirred in my guts but even the knowledge I was prepared wasn't enough. “Tony girl. Help me.” She looked at me for a moment, then gently stepped up to the stairs. I placed my hand on her back and kept it there as I slowly followed her up to my bedroom. I let go of her back as I pulled the covers over myself. At the tree line, the deer watched me. The sight of that let me take my first breath in minutes. I still had no clue what it was, but I knew it helped me. It helped Tony. So I trusted it.



The cloud of sleep enveloped me and soon I was gone, beyond the veil of dream.



I wasn’t even surprised when I woke up to belligerent white lights flooding my vision. Fluorescent may not be the word, but it’s the closet description I can provide. Figures stood, cutting out bulb-like shapes in the cascading light. My wrists twitched and caught against the metal clamps holding my limbs down. My fingers dug into and tore open my palms as a slender finger outstretched and probed my face. The prodding was thorough, testing the tender and fattiness of each location. The finger slid to my lips, pressing and pinching them. I went to bite the finger, but realized whatever laundry list of things they did to me before my waking must have included injecting me with a cocktail of paralyzing agents.



After finishing probing my face, they moved to my arms and torso, then my legs and delicates. “Not much meat.” A humming and loose voice spoke. *“Very above average, actually.”* I thought as they commented on my calves. 



They returned to my stomach. “Fatty, start here.” One spoke to another. “*Dick, I’m on a bulk- start here? Fuck…”* A thin wire dragged along my belly, peeling off a thin sheet of skin. A scream bubbled in my throat but couldn’t burst into existence. My breathing turned into hyper-ventilation and my heart slammed against my rib cage. The light obscured their expressions, but it was obvious one took note. It leaned down and pressed its hearing organ against my chest. “Scared.” It reported to another. 



“Calm it, the fear will ruin the meat.” Its constituent responded.



“Human. Breath. Take peace in knowing your meaningless existence was given purpose by the lottery of our random selection.” If I could have spit I would have hawked one into the thing’s eye. Sure, life was a bit purposeless after getting my retirement from being the government’s personal harvester, but my land had enough spice, I didn’t need the universe dropping this on me as a treatment for the occasional boredom or thousand yard stare.



“Astounding.” One of them muttered and I jeered silently. Of all the meat bags they could have grabbed, they grabbed the immortal one. I watched as they split the sheet of skin between the two or three of them. Each took a sommelier-sniff and set the sacred flesh on their equivalent of tongues. “Delicate yet gritty. It has such a tender-aged bite to it, I’m getting notes of war and killer instinct. It’s divine. What a deep oaky flavor, wisps of coffee, gunpowder, and… Tangerine. Delectable.” 



*“Oh fuck me.”* I groaned to myself.



In the void of space, under the beat of clinical luminescence, it’s nearly impossible to judge time. Thankfully you don’t spend 3 weeks in Chinese caves systems without learning to track your precise internal clock. 3 hours of their relentless sampling and babbling had passed before they finally stopped. Despite this, the time felt like decades. I’ve endured tortures beyond endless imagination, but none have gotten as close to breaking me as having to lay and listen to those fuckers talk about the “notes” and “nuances” of the taste of my skin. I taste like pork. I know I taste like pork. I happen to know that I pair greatly with some garlic and basil. Don’t compare me to oak and gunpowder or what-the-hell-ever, it’s downright offensive. 



After their agonizing circle-jerk of uppity sampling, they clicked off the lights and left the room. With the lights finally off, I could take deeper account of the room. The ceiling was a smooth and hospital-bland white with light projecting circles dotted on the vertices of a pentagon shaped window with a faint chip in the crystal glass.



Multicolored, blot peppered space filled the infinite view. I can’t imagine how I was surprised by this. I was out, alone in the void. 



My blood was laced with a bounty of otherworldly drugs and chemicals. My veins wriggled like they were full of maggots. My heart was steady and my breathing was measured. I needed to move. If I could get back my ability to move at least I could dislocated my fingers and deglove my hands to get out. I started breathing heavier, forcing my heart to speed up. I exerted and forced each in and exhale. I felt moisture gather under the clamps as I started sweating. The sweat was green and thick as it was forced out of the pores. It started with a twitch in my finger tips, as movement reached the first knuckle I flexed my finger rapidly. Then it reached my wrist and I flexed and flapped each hand. I didn’t know how long I had but I needed to sweat out as much of these drugs as I could. 



The moment I had enough movement, I pulled my hands through the clamps. The flesh of my hands peeled off and loose strings of muscle tissue flopped about before healing back into place under fresh skin. I was able to operate my toes by the time I gripped my- above average sized- calves and ripped my feet out. The left foot came completely off but returned promptly. 



Taking in the room I made two assessments. One: Whether by stupidity or ego, they had no cameras in the room. Two: I wasn't alone. 



4 halls, in line with sides of the pentagonal window on the ceiling, sprawled in multi-mile long galleries of still and weakly whimpering aliens. There must have been hundreds of thousands of complex lives strung up and routinely harvested. Liquid and gelatinous lifeforms swirled in sealed tubes with taps at their base. The bodies were marred with thin scars where they removed flesh and organs for feast. The flesh itself was fragile and sloppily healed, like the meat was stapled back on over and over. If the things that took me were advanced enough to traverse the stars looking for “nuanced flavors.” they were probably good at keeping their stock full. 



Blood flooded the metallic floor and my organs cascaded in hot pursuit. “Come on, give it up.” I wheezed and grunted as I rummaged around the blades and tools throughout my organs and tissues. “Why the fuck did I use heavy duty zip ties?” I coughed. The zip tie around my rib finally snapped and the P320 fell onto my liver on the ground. When you’re stuffing your body with weapons to use against aliens who are going to kidnap and eat you, it feels like a lot, but once you take it all out you regret how little shit you actually brought. The blades I had brought were two box cutters, the tools were a wire saw and a garden spade, and sure I had the P320 but I forgot a second magazine. 



Kids, if you end up immortal and have premonitions of being kidnapped by aliens: Make sure you back a window breaker of some kind and extra ammo for whatever gun you bring. I recommend putting the extra mags under your intestines. 



I started stuffing my organs back into place when a spark plug was spat out from under a kidney. “When the hell did that slip in?” My ribs clicked back into place and the blood caking me soaked into my body. Lacking a belt, I cut pockets into my thigh and holstered the box cutters and the spark plug. 



The door which I heard them leave through was perplexing, as I’m sure more alien tech is. The door required a strange appendage to be scanned for the door to open. The print was like a human hand but longer and bony thin. “If I had to bet…” I trailed off into thought, turning my sights to the gallery halls. How long does a species take to dedicate themselves to the complexities of cuisine till they sample their own? Not long I suppose. 



4 bodies deep into the north east hall was a creature matching the appearance and appendage of the others that had sampled me. I took the garden spade and lopped off its hand. With a wet slap and chime the scanner turned some shade of red and the door opened. “Well… Damn.” A command deck with hundreds of bipedal, wet, grey, thin, and tall Graymen was still in shock. “Truce?” A horrid screech filled the room and from the thin, membranous flesh around the tips of their fingers peeled back and razor sharp bone nails were exposed. More concerning than  their transformation, was what was coming into view through the command deck window.



A luminary pillar of raging opulent gluttony crested into sight. The yellow spatters of aurum light spewed and stained space. A vomit of comic resplendence, the collective piece meal of a million million minds and many more hands. A plant dwarfing bastion of a prestigious and loquacious species. No diamond or pearl equaled one/ one trillionth of the billowing glow. A space station the size of Jupiter, the mother ship.



Nails sank through my skull and split my head in two. Blood flowed down my shoulders and then lavender blood splashed over my hand as I drove the spade into the Grayman’s throat. “I do not, have ever, nor will ever have notes of tangerine!” Another stepped up to bat and took a box cutter to the stomach. Its noodle guts spilled out and I grappled the wrists of a falling claw. I rolled between its legs, leapt onto its shoulders, tied the guts around its throat, pulled, and sent its hand through its face. “3 years of improv classes, Grace me now.” I ran my tongue against my teeth while getting hacked apart and returning the brutality. *“Escape pod, no they’ll just come for me once I get home. Steal the ship, nope they’ll track it and find me… Ram it? Don’t know about comedy, but solutions certainly do come in 3s.”*



They say insanity is doing the same thing over and over again expecting a new result, but I’ll be damned if smashing your head against a brick wall till the wall caves doesn’t pair wonderfully with immortality. The spade got eaten, the box cutters melted from the Graymen’s box-cutter-dissolving blood, and the P320 was empty at just the perfectly wrong moment. The back of my skull blew open as I was slammed to the ground and dog-piled. “None of you would be interested in a recess would you?” My face got crushed. *“No gun, no weapons, jack-squat…Well, every closed door opens a window… Window!”* Yeah, I had a 80’s crime thriller epiphany, I’m not ashamed to admit it, try it some time.



The great thing about accidentally getting a spark plug inside your guts: it gives you a great window breaker that can be used even while getting mauled by aliens.



I fished the spark plug out from my pocket carved into my thigh. I fumbled it between my teeth and cracked off the ceramic body. I dug out one of the chunks from my gums and waited for an opening. The sea parted and in exodus an ordained ceramic chunk flew towards paradise. The Ozymandias hand of panic eyed Grayman leapt for the escaping fragment. The same time I ran out of biblical metaphor, the window chipped then shuddered away screaming into the mother void. 



My blood vessels and eyes exploded, regenerating in time for me to catch a death grip of the throttle handle. The gray flew into space, exploding as their blood boiled was dragged out of them. The run of air struggled against my regeneration to rip my arm out of socket. The pressure drained from the ship until silence filled it in its entirety. 



The ship jittered as the thrusters belched. I crawled through zero-gravity towards a star map in the center of the command room. “*Earth, Earth, Earth, come on, no whammies.”* Intuition guided my finger, spelling out what I hoped would be home. A line of dotted hope stretched through the image of the galaxy connecting me to home. I committed the direction to memory then climbed. I dragged myself out of the window, carefully stalking along the outside to the point I planned to leap from. 



The mother ship's lights ran crimson, a flashing red that was meant to alert its population to their coming demise. They say it only took 6 miles of rock to eradicate all life on earth however many millions of years ago. As I pushed off the stampeding ship, I wondered how the mothership would fare against a crescent shaped hunk of metal, 11 miles wide, many times denser than granite, charging at a light-chasing speed.



I prayed a quick prayer for the souls chained up in the ship. The mother ship flashed then liquified into asteroids of super heated metal. An explosion so visceral it split atoms and compounded its own destruction. Flames that licked the tail of heaven and stepped on the head of hell vaporized two neighboring planets, spilling out dust and magma into the great cradle of all things. The mothership’s artificial atmosphere facilitated a shock wave that, while helpful when it came to my speed, turned me into a fine mist. 



The journey was long. I grazed the pull of black holes and witnessed unmarked nebulas roil, pregnant with baby stars. I froze and boiled, occasionally at the same time. I was lucky to dodge spiraling asteroid belts, but wasn’t lucky enough to avoid plunging though a bright blue star. I’d mark it down as a positive though. My body went from vaporizing while working with Sisyphean will to reform, to mending before I got so much as a sunburn. By the measure of my trusty internal clock, I rocketed through space for about  3 days. Of all the sights I perused along my gallery walk of the galaxy, the most divine was a star being inhaled by a blackhole. The menagerie of colors and the rivers of fission was something no hand or computer could respect with the finest paint brush, most flowery of language, or complex of generation systems. 



While that may be the most beautiful moment of the trip, the best was getting pasted as I touched down on my beloved mother Earth. 



Two hitchhikes, one bus, and a short walk later, I was home. As fast as you read that sentence, the time passed. All of that cosmic travel for a 5 hour trip till I was able to pet a very anxious and excited Tony. I think the term is: Hollow Victory. I was happier than anyone to be home, but now that I was, I was disappointed. For so long my purpose was killing people who threatened the safety of the people for the French Foreign Legion and Delta Force, then it was being the government hole-patcher, then it was Tony. But Tony had joined the routine. I loved her, but learning to take care of her wasn’t a challenge anymore- beside the weekly bath. The supernatural threats, though terrible and draining, were giving variety to my life which lacked such. As I petted Tony’s head, I came to realize that if these nightmares ever did stop: I’d be more lost than ever.



Nah, I’m fucking with you. You should see the look on your face, I sure wish I could. I spent decades as a killer and now I got to enjoy my fucking land and I wanted to enjoy it dammit. “Aw, oh, wee, I hate having a steady routine that is peaceful and beautiful land.” Yeah right. What I hated was having to wait weeks for the next nightmare to come to life. I wanted these damn things dead ASAP so I could sit on my porch and sip coffee while petting Tony for the rest of my life. 



“What do you think… Anything I could do to speed things up a bit?” I asked the deer who was now, after 4 days of me being back on Earth, comfortable joining me and Tony on the porch for coffee. I rubbed its nose against its hoof. “Blood sacrifice maybe? Know a good goat or lamb dealer?” It licked the wood planks of the porch. “My uncle Jacob might know a guy… I need you to hurry!” I yelled to the woods.



“That won’t help none.” The deer looked me in my widening eyes.



“Huh?”



And that’s all for part 4 folks. Bit sudden, I know but a threat unlike that I’ve ever seen– Tony swan in mud– has just made its presence known and it requires my full and immediate attention. 



Besides, who doesn’t love cliffhanger? Until next time folks. Peace.
