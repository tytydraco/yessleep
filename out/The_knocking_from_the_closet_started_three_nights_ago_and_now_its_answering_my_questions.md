I moved into my new apartment a week ago, thrilled to find a place that was affordable and close to work. It wasn’t much—just a small one-bedroom with old carpet and a slightly musty smell—but it was mine. The first few nights were fine, uneventful even, until the knocking started.

It was faint at first, just a few soft taps coming from the closet in my bedroom. I thought it was the neighbors or maybe the pipes settling. I ignored it and went back to sleep. But the next night, the knocking returned, louder and more insistent. It always happened around 2 AM, rhythmic and deliberate, like someone was trapped inside and trying to get out.

I finally worked up the courage to check the closet. I swung the door open, half-expecting to find some animal or a broken pipe, but it was empty. Just some clothes hanging and a few boxes on the floor. I searched every inch, even knocking on the walls myself, but found nothing unusual. I convinced myself it was all in my head and tried to go back to sleep.

The following night, the knocking started again, this time accompanied by a faint, muffled voice. I couldn’t make out the words, but it sounded like someone was whispering from inside the closet. My heart raced, but I didn’t dare open the door again. I called my landlord the next day, who assured me that there were no issues with the building and that no one had lived there before me for years.

Last night, the knocking was different. It was no longer just random taps; it had a pattern. I couldn’t help myself—I asked, “Who’s there?” The knocking stopped for a moment, then started again, louder, almost frantic. I asked another question, “Do you need help?” The knocking became erratic, as if it was responding to me.

I decided to record it with my phone. When I played the recording back, my blood ran cold. Through the static, I heard a voice, faint but clear: “Let me out.” 

I haven’t slept since. Every night, the knocking grows louder, and the voice becomes clearer. I’m terrified to open the closet door, but I know it’s only a matter of time before I have to. Because now, when I ask questions, it answers.

I spent the following day doing research, hoping to find something—anything—that could explain the knocking. I scoured the internet for information about the apartment, the building, even the entire block. There were no reports of deaths, no grisly crimes, nothing that would point to why this was happening to me. The only thing I found was a vague mention of someone going missing in the area years ago, but it didn’t seem connected.

That night, I tried something different. I left the closet door open before going to bed. I figured if it was open, maybe the knocking would stop. But at 2 AM, like clockwork, the knocking began. It was louder this time, and the voice that followed was unmistakable. “Why won’t you help me?” it said, clear as day. My heart pounded in my chest. I wanted to respond, but my throat was dry, and I couldn’t form the words.

I called a friend the next morning, desperate for someone to believe me. They came over, and we sat in my living room, staring at the closet door. “It’s just an old building,” they said. “You’re stressed from moving. It’s nothing.” But I could see the unease in their eyes. They were trying to reassure me, but they didn’t really believe what they were saying.

That night, my friend stayed over, and we kept vigil, watching the closet door. At 2 AM, the knocking started again. We both jumped, eyes wide with terror. My friend grabbed my arm, squeezing tight. “Is this a joke?” they asked, their voice trembling. I shook my head. I didn’t even have the energy to explain. The knocking was furious now, like something was trying to tear its way out.

We watched in horror as the closet door slowly creaked open, revealing nothing but darkness inside. My friend bolted from the apartment, leaving me alone with the open door. I wanted to follow, but I couldn’t move. I was paralyzed with fear, my eyes locked on the empty space beyond the closet door.

I don’t know how long I stood there, staring. Eventually, I closed the door and shoved a chair in front of it, praying it would hold. I haven’t gone back to the closet since. I sleep on the couch now, if you can call it sleeping. Every night, the knocking gets closer, and the voice grows louder. It no longer sounds desperate—it sounds angry.

I’ve tried to leave, but every time I open the front door, something stops me. It’s like the apartment doesn’t want to let me go. And now, as I sit here writing this, I can hear the knocking again. It’s not coming from the closet anymore—it’s coming from right behind me.
