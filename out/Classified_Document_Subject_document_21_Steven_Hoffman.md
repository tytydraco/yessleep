 Subjects Journal was found in campsite 221 in \[REDACTED\]. A couple days later the subject was found, on the ground.

Entry No. 1 -

Me and my friends decided to travel over summer break to a campsite deep in the adirondacks. But we didn’t know that these things would be waiting for us. Everything had gone pretty smoothly over the past couple of days, the drive was only a short 5 hours, we rotated who was driving every hour. We unpacked and set up hammocks between a couple trees, even going as far as doubling up, hammock over hammock for me and Jimmy. We we’re all stiff from the long ride and the campsite was humid as hell. Combine that with the campsite next to us having crying babies, we decided to swim at a pond that was just a hop skip and a jump away from us. The others were hesitant about it, opting to just walk back and try to pass time another way. Even though they didn’t join me, I decided to jump in. It was grotesquely warm, and as soon as I was in I wanted out.

It's the middle of the night. Something horrible is here. I heard a distant, unearthly screeching, something that couldn’t belong to god's animals. I originally played it off as a cruel trick of my imagination, or (i don’t know how) the wind. Yet it happened again, this time sounding closer, and filled with more malice. I was in the bottom hammock, with my friend sleeping above me. He usually snores so loudly, yet I heard nothing at all from him. Actually I heard nothing from anybody. The silence was piercing and unearthly, as if I were in a different dimension. I reached for my flashlight that I kept in my bag that hung on the side of my hammock. I clicked it on, to see that every single one of the hammocks was completely empty, the only thing left was the embers of a forgotten campfire. As i landed my foot crushed a small twig, creating a horrifying \*crack\* in the deep silence. Ice ran down my spine, as a paralyzing fear shot through me. I waited, too afraid to breathe. I waited for it to find me. The silence was back, no screaming, nothing. Suddenly, it was there. A Huge beast, almost like a minotaur, with eyes that glowed a dim yellow. A lion head, its jaw dropping inhumanely low, its mane was covered in blood. Its body was gray/ pinkish, a back with a hunched over spine, covered in blisters and wounds. Legs that were stumpy and thick. It sniffed the air, tasting with its tongue which had previously hung limply in its mouth. My heart was breathing through my chest, but I dared not breathe. It stepped up to me, I stood still as a statue, for my instincts were screaming at me, that if I even blinked, or twitched, I would be killed immediately. It sniffed me onceover, and then with a gruff snort, began stomping away back into the forest.

I waited 30 minutes, no sign of it, no noises left, and only then did I let myself feel relief. I walked over and sat on a stump. Actually that's where I'm writing this right now, in my camp journal. I need to do something as I doubt i’ll sleep at all tonight

Entry No. 2 -

The morning was damp, my clothes were uncomfortably moist, and clung to my skin. Last night, after laying in my hammock for a while, my friends had somehow come back, when questioning them about it this morning they just looked confused. I tried to tell the story of what happened to my friend but they all waved it off as my imagination or a fever dream. But I know what I saw. After tiredly changing out of my clothes, I went to grab my toothbrush. While wiggling my hand around in the bag I felt the stiff leather of my journal, and decided to take it out and open it up again to review what I had written the night before. I flipped through the pages looking over my entry. Could I have written this out of delusion? It was then I noticed something, as the light through the trees hit the final page of my entry I saw ink on the other side, I hadn't written anything else, had i? My skin crawled as I looked over the newly found writing. In splotchy big letters it read “DON’T TRUST THEM, THOSE ARE NOT YOUR FRIENDS” My heart raced as i thought through what this could possibly mean, was this a prank? No, what I experienced last night was real, and this could explain why all my friends went missing and are acting like nothing happened. I couldn’t let them know about this, I fervently shoved my journal back into my camp bag and noticed them all staring at me. They didn’t quite look human, more like poorly put together parts of a human being. The one representing Jimmy took a step towards me. I started shouting “No, please god no!” As a smile stretched on his face, I stumbled backwards, tripping on a loose root. My head hit the ground with a dull “Thud” and everything went black.

I had a raging headache, the only thing I could see was a bright light. I had woken up on a local hospital bed. I screamed as I saw Jimmy at my bedside, a couple of doctors and nurses came rushing over to hold me down as I tried to run away. “Your injuries!” a doctor shouted. After a couple more seconds of struggling I fell limp, exhausted. It didn’t seem like “Jimmy” was going to be openly violent right now. What did they want with me, what are these things and why did they bring me to the hospital? All I knew was that I couldn't let them know about the message in my journal. The doctor told me I was going to have to stay in this hospital bed for the night, that I had a concussion and had passed out for the past hour or so. Jimmy and my other friends’ had asked me various questions about why I was screaming and fell backwards. I had to play the part of the confused friend who didn’t know what happened in the fear that *they* might figure out that I know and do something to me. They left to go get me food and a drink, and I'm trying to write this entry as fast as I can.

There’s another one, a note written on the next page after my second entry. This time it was a long list of instructions. Ways to kill these *things.* It described some sort of ritual involving burning and stabbing using a steel weapon of some sort. This is what I needed to do. If I don't kill them, they will kill me, and if you don’t see another log in this journal I am either dead or close to it.

Entry No. 3 - Final entry.

It's over. Those things have been split open and burnt like a pig on a fire. It’s giving me an almost *gleeful* feeling. I told them I was fine and left the hospital early, so we went back to camp, and had the brilliant idea of telling them to light the fire that I was gonna use to perform the ritual. We were all sitting around it as the sun went down, exchanging stories and cooking s’mores. I told them I had to leave to take a piss, but while their backs were turned, I grabbed a steel tent stake, and stabbed those things that had taken my friends right in the back, their screams were gleefully horrifying. They were too shocked to fight back, I guess those things didn’t know that I knew about them. Each time I stabbed one it filled me with pleasure and satisfaction. When they all stopped moving, I tossed their corpses into the fire. But I've realized that this whole camp is filled with these beasts, they writhed and stomped about. I’m making it my mission after I'm done writing this to exterminate every one, wish me luck!

END OF JOURNAL

&#x200B;

Subject Steven Hoffer was found dead after killing 27 people. After killing all his friends at their campsite he began going around the camping ground and murdering children, women, and men alike. Eventually, Steven arrived at campsite \[Redacted\]. Where Robert \[Redacted\] shot him twice with a shotgun. The autopsy showed that he had been infected with some new sort of hallucinogenic parasite that had infected the local pond. The notes that steven had wrote about were identified as stevens own hand writing and are likely due to him being infected by the parasites. We don't know how many others are currently affected and will employ damage control effectively immediately. 

Steven's body is being used and tested on to see what conditions the parasites can spread or survive in. 2 criminals have been killed after becoming infected and hostile, saying they were saying "Horrible Creatures" when we try to interact with them. A Cure has not yet been found but testing will continue.
