As far back as I can remember I had been watch by a black dark figure at night. I never knew what it was and I was scared of it at first, but after a couple of years it became a normal part of my life. I’d hear it whispering to me while I slept but I could never understand what it was saying. I tried to tell my parents but they always thought I was joking since I had a very active imagination.
	
After a while i got used to the figure and stopped telling people. This went on for a while until one night when my dad woke up the something choking him. he didn’t know what was going on so he got up and ran to the bathroom. He continued to choke until he got to the bathroom and turned on the light. Once he turned on the light he stopped choking and realized he had large had marks on his neck yet nobody was in the room with him. The same night my uncle woke up to a bite mark on his arm. Neither of them were sure what it was until I told them about the figure I had been seeing. They didn’t believe me at first but the more I told of it the more they believed. The entity had shown up once more to my dad but hasn’t sense.
	
The entity has watched me everyday thought my entire life. I had no idea what it was doing, but I knew it wasn’t good. Things stayed the same until I turned 17, the entity started watching me more. now I could see it out of the corner of my eye watching me throughout the day until it stopped. For about 3 days there was nothing, the figure didn’t watch me for the first time in my life. I was pretty scared because I this didn’t feel right.

After the 3 days I saw it again but something was different, although I couldn’t tell what. That night I had the weirdest experience of my life, During the night I was having a regular dream and everything was normal then out of nowhere everything when black and I heard a deep voice. In a voice so deep it didn’t sound human I heard it say “This is going to be fun”. After that I woke up covered in sweet and with a weird feeling inside of my body. Looked around the room and I didn’t see the figure anywhere. 
	
That was almost a year ago and I still haven’t seen the figure since and neither has my dad but I can still feel something inside of me. Ever since that night I have become more and more depressed, tired, and just all around uninterested in anything. This is weird because before I was so happy and almost nothing could make me feel like this. 
Everyday I feel myself slowly loosing control. I can feel something trying to break out and take over.  I don’t know how much longer I can stand this and I have no idea what to do.
