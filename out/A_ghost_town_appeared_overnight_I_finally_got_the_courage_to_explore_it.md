If you’ve never been to Southern California, you might not believe how many inexplicable abandoned buildings are strewn across the desert, like seeds scattered by the wind. It’s nothing remarkable, really: every once in a while, driving down the highway, you see a tiny little wooden shack, white paint peeling in the sun, four hundred feet from the road.

  
I see that kind of thing a lot, actually. I oversee a handful of water treatment plants, so I do a lot of driving from place to place. Some roads I take more than others, but some, I only see every few weeks, if not months.

  
That’s probably why I didn’t notice at first. It was early summer, and I was starting to really feel the heat. I’d already been on the road for two hours, and I hadn’t seen another car in forty-five minutes — just me and the highway, with the empty desert stretching from horizon to horizon.

  
It didn’t exactly catch me off guard when I saw the building. It was a small house, barely bigger than an apartment, squatting in the middle of the desert. Its shattered windows stared back at me, its paint peeling away. There was no road, no driveway, no dirt path leading up to it. It was just there.

  
I only noticed it at all because I had just driven this way two weeks before, and I was pretty sure I hadn’t seen the house before. It wasn’t exactly likely that it had been built, and then fallen to ruin, in the two weeks since I’d last passed this way, so I chalked it down to just having forgotten. After all, like I said, that kind of thing isn’t uncommon here.

  
I forgot about it almost as soon as I’d seen it, and it didn’t cross my mind at all while I was at work. Going back that way in the evening, I only remembered it when I saw it crest the horizon again.

  
When I got closer, though, I saw something new: a shed, barely ten feet from the house, its roof caved in. The door hung open, swinging gently in the breeze. I definitely hadn’t seen the shed that morning, but again, I chalked it down to having failed to notice. After all, I was seeing it from a different angle, now, and the sun was much lower in the sky.

  
Still, as it receded into the glaring sun behind me, it linger, just a little, in my mind.

  
I didn’t pass that way for another week. I put the house and the shed out of my mind because, again, who really thinks about that kind of thing? When I got the call saying I needed to check on the plant back east, though, I couldn’t help but be curious about the house. I was almost eager to drive past it again.

  
The road was deserted yet again — most people took the newer highway further north, but our plant was right off of the old highway. It was a cooler day, tempered by heavy clouds hanging in the sky, turning the world into a patchwork of light and shadow, making the familiar desert expanse into something twisted and alien.

  
Up ahead, the house came into view, shutters swaying in the wind. There, beside it, was the shed — and behind it, there was the stark white steeple of a church. I took my foot off the gas, letting myself coast slowly past the sight.

  
The church was small — the kind of chapel built for a tiny town in the desert — but once again, it was clearly abandoned. Its windows were boarded up, crass graffiti covered one wall, and the cross at the tip of its steeple was splintered and bent.

  
It had only been a week since I’d last come this way. I even took a picture with my phone, to make sure — I don’t know, that it wasn’t some weird mirage? For proof? To show someone later?

  
That’s exactly what I did, actually. When I got to the plant, I asked some of the operators if they’d seen any of those buildings before. I didn’t get anything more than halfhearted shrugs and a chorus of maybe, but at least they didn’t tell me I was crazy.

  
I took a little more time than usual closing up the plant that evening. My mind was so occupied that I didn’t even log my overtime. I almost considered taking a different way home, but any detour I could have considered would have taken at least another hour.

  
I braced myself as I got closer. I found myself turning down the radio, out of — respect? Fear? I don’t really know. I could barely see the little town in the light of the setting sun, but I didn’t need a perfect view. There was another building.

  
It was a two-story structure of dark, stained wood. The bars over its windows, and the faded sign over its door, marked it as a liquor store. A rusted padlock held its doors closed from the outside, and tattered, discolored posters decorated its facade.

  
If it wasn’t so late, I would have stopped. Even as flustered as I was, I wasn’t about to leave my car on the side of the highway and go exploring a ghost town after dark.

  
When I got home, I poured myself two fingers of whiskey and turned on some mindless reality TV. When that didn’t help, I poured another glass of whiskey, and when I finished that I cracked open a beer. It almost helped, until I got the bright idea to tell someone about what I’d seen.

  
If I’d been sober, I might have called a friend or family member. As it was, I dialled a half-remembered number, waiting as it rang.

  
“This is *Desert Talk* on 92.4 FM. I’m professional talker Hayden Walker, and you’re on the air, caller. Welcome to our Strange and Unusual segment.”

  
“Yeah, I’ve got a story about a ghost town,” I said.

  
“I know we can’t get enough of those out here in the High Desert,” Hayden laughed.

  
“Oh, um. My name is Jordan,” I said.

  
“Great to hear from you, Jordan. What’s your story?”

  
“Last week, I was driving down an old highway, kind of south of Palm Desert, actually, when I saw this old abandoned house. Nothing special, I guess. But on the way back, I saw a shed next to the house. I didn’t remember seeing it on the way there, but who knows?

  
“The thing is… when I drove past this morning, there was a church, too. All boarded up. And this evening, I saw another building. A liquor store. Looked like it hadn’t been used in years, but it wasn’t there this morning — and the church wasn’t there last week — and I don’t know about the house, but… I don’t know. That’s it, I guess.”

  
I sat in silence after finishing.

  
After a moment, the host took a deep breath. “Is this a prank call?”

  
“No. Why?”

  
“Last week, we got a call about an abandoned house that hadn’t been there before. Old highway, just south of Palm Desert.”

  
Someone else had seen it. I wasn’t losing it.

  
“Jordan, if you don’t mind, could you send your contact information over to our station? I think we’d like to take a closer look at this story,” Hayden said.

  
“Sure,” I mumbled.

  
I don’t remember much else that happened that night, but I woke up the next morning to a pounding in my head and a pounding on my front door. I stumbled to the door and opened it to see a young man and an older women standing on my porch, already sweating in the heat.

  
“Jordan Nores?” The young man asked. I recognized his voice.

  
“Pro talker Hayden Walker?”

  
He beamed. “Glad to meet you. We spoke last night, on my show. This is Marian, the other caller I mentioned.”

  
We shook hands, and I invited them inside. I brewed a pot of coffee while we spoke.

  
“Frankly, most of the calls we get are bullshit,” Hayden said, “but if one’s luck, and two’s a coincidence, well — one of our staffers claims to have seen this… phantom ghost town of yours, too.”

  
“I haven’t seen it since it was just a house,” Marian said, “but I believe you.”

  
“Thanks, I guess, but I don’t think there’s much to talk about.” I said. “It’s weird, but… not much else.”

  
“*You* may not think there’s much to talk about,” Hayden said, “but professional talker Hayden Walker would have to disagree. There’s a story here. A strange and unusual one, and that’s the kind our listeners like best.”

  
I had to admit, I was curious. And it was a Saturday — I didn’t have much else to do. We all piled into my crappy little car and I started the two-hour drive out to the ghost town. I even tuned into 92.4 FM for kicks, listening to one of Hayden’s colleagues talk about the history of the railway in California. It was pretty interesting.

  
Finally, I pulled off the side of the highway, stopping in front of the town. Sure enough, it had grown again.

  
A second house had joined the first, the wood of its porch half-rotted away, strips of peeling white paint wavering in the wind. Just off the highway, there was an old gas station with a name I couldn’t read, its once-colorful signage now bleached by the sun. Just four pumps stood beneath the awning, each with a simple “out of order” sign hanging across it.

  
“Sad little place,” Hayden commented.

  
Marian just stared. “It — I mean, I believed you, but… wow.”

  
“The gas station and that house are new, somehow,” I said. “I saw the other house first, then the shed, the church, then the liquor store.”

  
“Do you mind if I record this?” Hayden asked. He produced a small video camera from seemingly nowhere without waiting for an answer.

  
“I don’t like this,” Marian said. I had to agree with her. As curious as I was, it was a strange situation.

  
Hayden trudged across hard-packed dirt toward the closest house, peering through a broken window. The room inside was bare, covered in dust and sand, cracks running up the walls. The only piece of furniture was a scuffed end table.

  
“It’s like a real ghost town,” Hayden said. Even then, I thought it was a weird thing to say.

  
We spent the next fifteen or so minutes walking through the little town, taking in the buildings’ exteriors. Nobody said it, but none of us seemed eager to go inside just yet. I knew I wasn’t.

  
As the sun rose higher, we stopped to cool off on a picnic bench in the shadow of the liquor store. Hayden idly flipped through his footage. Seeing that jogged my memory, and I fished my phone from my pocket. I showed him the photo I’d taken the day before — in the picture, the town was barely half the size it was now.

  
“Very interesting,” he said. I didn’t quite understand the look in his eye, at the time.

  
When we got back on our feet, Hayden was eager to go inside one of the buildings. Marian and I tried to dissuade him, but he had his heart set on it. He tried fruitlessly to pull the boards off the door of the church, before giving up. We trudged down the narrow road as wind whistled through shattered windows, coming to a stop in front of the first house.

  
The door creaked as Hayden pushed it open. Inside was a small living room, empty except for a ruined couch, with a small kitchenette along the far wall. The cabinets were gutted, the appliances ripped from the walls, leaving gaping wounds surrounded by ragged drywall.

  
I stepped into the next room. I froze. “This house doesn’t have a second floor.”

  
A stairway, splintered and pitted, led up. A tangle of wires dangled down from the second floor, but it was all I could see.

  
Marian stared up at it. “I guess it does now.”

  
“Jordan,” Hayden said, “would you mind going outside and checking? Making sure this house isn’t bigger on the inside, like that… television show?”

  
“You shouldn’t go up,” I said. It didn’t take a genius to realize something was wrong here.

  
“I’m a professional,” Hayden said. “Marian?”

  
“I’ll stay down here,” she said.

  
I couldn’t bear to watch him disappear upstairs, so I did as he’d asked and went back outside, squinting into the midday sun. Sure enough, the house had a second story now. Its upper windows all had their curtains drawn, I realized, walking a slow circle around the narrow house.

  
When I got back to the front, Marian stood on the porch, looking pensive. “I couldn’t stay in there,” she said.

  
I agreed. “This feels… wrong. Obviously. A town growing, like — a weed. A mold.”

  
“A tumor,” Marian suggested.

  
“Growing like dread,” I finished. I had meant it as a joke, but it didn’t feel like one.

  
Marian squinted. “Was there always a diner here?”

  
I turned. The diner looked straight out of the sixties, all pastel colors and oblique angles. Two full walls of glass glinted harshly in the sun, tempered by what must have been years of dust and grime.

  
Marian and I didn’t say anything, but we started walking towards it. It was connected to the gas station, its six pumps standing guard.

  
I halfheartedly tried the door. I was relieved to find it locked.

  
“There’s a calendar,” Marian said, peering through the window. I pressed my face to the warm glass, cupping my hands around my face. Inside, rows of booths sat astoundingly clean, dotted with a few empty condiment containers here and there. On the counter, beneath a faded menu, a calendar was open to the month of July, 1992. More than thirty years ago.

  
“I guess we know when this place closed,” I said. “Even if… God, I don’t know.”

  
Marian shivered despite the heat. “I want to leave,” she said.

  
We turned around. I couldn’t see the house anymore — behind us, there was a block of wooden storefronts, advertising bail bonds and tobacco and antiques. The sun was brighter and harsher than ever — a heat haze hovered over the cracked asphalt road.

  
“We have to find Hayden,” Marian said urgently.

  
I shook my head. “He’ll find his way back.”

  
Marian gave me a hard look and set off down the road, looking for a way around the shops. I followed, reluctantly.

  
“There!” Marian said. “The house! I saw it through a…”

  
We rounded a corner. An imposing town hall stood before us, with a squat sheriff’s office beside it. The rusted husk of an old car rotted on the street beside it.

  
“No,” Marian said. “No, it was just there. It’s just behind…”

  
“We have to go,” I insisted.

  
Marian walked into the narrow alley between the two buildings, blissfully shaded from the sun. As I stepped forward to follow her, an old wind vane creaked with a sudden change in the wind. I jumped, looking around for the source of the noise. When I looked back, the alleyway was gone — the sheriff’s office was at least six feet wider.

  
I cursed. I couldn’t see the highway anymore — the road made an abrupt turn, ending in another row of houses. I ran down the road, heart pounding, and almost collided face-first with a fence.

  
Looking around frantically, I saw it — my car, by the side of the highway, barely visible through the slats of the fence. Without taking my eyes off it, I clambered over the fence, breaking into a full sprint as soon as I was clear. I didn’t even blink.

  
I almost cried when I reached my car. I’m ashamed to admit it, but I didn’t wait. Not for long, anyway. The town sprawled, now, and I didn’t know what I could trust anymore. I drove away, watching it recede in my mirrors. My heart didn’t stop pounding until it disappeared.

  
I called the police, of course. I didn’t really know what they could do, but I did it anyway. It’s been three weeks since then, and I haven’t heard back from them. I haven’t heard anything from Marian. I even tuned into Hayden’s show — his former show. It was cancelled that same week.

  
I did drive down that way, just once, a few days ago. The county was in the middle of tearing the whole place down. I guess my call to the police did something, at least.
