I'm in a spot of serious trouble and I need your advice.  


I live in a very heavily wooded area, in a small town a full four hour's drive away from metropolitan civilization. The folks here know each other, know the land- most of us have roots here stretching back centuries, our lineages are as just as old as the trees on the mountainsides and the stones in the riverbed. It's a stubborn connection- people leave, people come, but the same old families stay, watching the same houses and fields, tilling the same land, marrying into each other again and again until near everyone's now someone else's cousin something removed.  
The forest around us has always had a complicated relationship with our town. It's deep, and dark, and gloomy, straight out of a fairytale, largely uncharted and untamed. There's *things* in it, lurking in the shadows beneath the trees, the twilight and dusk, between the few unmaintained shepherd's trails.  


They are not friendly.  
They see us, year after year, and learn our faces, our names, the names inherited from our fathers, and they *hate*.  


There's been... incidents before, mass killings and disappearances, men going mad, old wives' tales whispered more as warning than as fancy. One happened only two years before I was born. Something came out of the trees and stole a dozen children before the men of our town marched into the woods with torches and guns and cold iron and salt.  


They managed to save half.  
Some left, after that.   
Most dug in their heels.  
We are a stubborn folk.  


That was not the first time something Other has made war on us, far from it.From what I can gather from our town histories, kept in the moldering library and snatched from conversation with old-timers, our town has been in a  state of constant violence with the surrounding Others since its inception.

I don't know if that's normal for small towns like ours, but I suspect not.

I don't think any of the big families in our town are really truly unaware of the Other anymore. They know, we all know- we bar our doors with iron, we mix purified salt into our shotgun shells, and the gate around our town is maintained with horseshoes and fresh rosebushes year after year.And we leave the woods alone after dark.  
My family has always been... well, I guess you could call us the village witch doctors. Wisdoms, shamans, caretakers, whatever the name, my family has always, always, as far back as the records go and memory holds, Practiced for the sake of our town. And not peacefully either.  
My house, my wooden two story colonial home, has a basement, you see.  


Beneath seven layers of wooden doors marked with symbols we've forgotten the meaning of, there's a vast space of stone and dust and wooden beams affixed with strange, ever-burning torches. It's a library, an armory, a laboratory at times, a shelter at others. It can hold the population of our town and then some- and it has, back in the day when things got really bad. It has rooms full of stuffed and pickled things, a labyrinth of shelves drooping with the weight of thousands and thousands of books.My family didn't build it. Noone in town knows who did. My father tells me, that his father told him, and so on- when the very first settlers broke ground and cleared the overgrowth to build their homes, they found the gates there.  


And I guess we drew the short straw to be its caretakers, back in the day.  


We sure as hell *used* it though, and the things we found inside. It was from the books, the ones we could read, that we learned how to defend ourselves, how to drive away the things in the dark, how to kill them and bind them. The very first Implement our family held, my father said to me, eyes shining with pride, was a flail of cold iron, found in the basement.I joined the Practice because of him, when I came of age. Because I wanted to help people. Because I wanted to kill the fucking monsters in the dark, the things that took my sister and my mother.  
But he's gone, missing, for two months now.  
He went into the woods, dressed in iron and ivory, torch in hand, leading thirty men with guns and salt and iron to push back the dark.  
And for the first time, he didn't come back out.None of them did.I was the one who found their clothes draped neatly over our border fence, each gently folded bundle softly cradling a spent bullet casing, and ten sets of human phalanges. One set for each man sent into the dark- excepting one.Of my father, of his arms and armor, there was no trace.And things have changed now. The horseshoes, vanishing one by one from our fence night after night, taunting us with their slow disappearance. Things with hungry smiles scrabbling at windows.   


Some of the men left tried to make a convoy, to leave the town. We saw them reach the foothills before their car lights collectively went dark.   


Noone has come into our town in two months, and we can't seem to get any messages *out* either.  


I have to try, though.  
People are worried, they're getting desperate, they need me, they need my family. I need to protect them. But I don't know enough, don't have enough power- I'm trying to read and learn and sharpen and craft, but it's too much- my father barely taught me anything about the Practice- for God's sake I'm only seventeen.  
Please, anyone.  
Help me.  
Save us, before our lights go out too.
