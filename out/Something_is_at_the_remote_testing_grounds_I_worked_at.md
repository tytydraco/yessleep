My name is Kevin [REDACTED], and I am not insane. I feel like this needs to be said before I get into the things that are happening.

A little background, I own a landscape business in a small Alaskan community. Having not broken into the snow removal industry yet so I work a second job during the winter.

The most common one being a maintenance man for the nearby military base's testing ground.

For those who don’t know, the US military hires a lot of civilians, especially up here, to do basic jobs around bases.

The job is a simple one, I live in a small cabin on the edge of a lake. Every winter when the ice gets thick enough I take out the Komatsu loader and following the provided map carve out a test track.

It is also my job to add snow if there isn’t enough for the proper testing. Despite the relaxed environment it is still a military base. I have to check credentials at the gate before letting people in, not that anyone would accidentally show up away out here.

This might come as a surprise, but many large automotive manufacturers will use our test track to see how new models handle the cold.

For example, last winter I had to keep a generator fueled up as it was charging six EV vehicles, they also had six identical cars that sat unplugged as a comparison.

While my job is to maintain the lake track, there is also a hill climb and rumble track ten miles to the east. Other than that there is nothing to the south for 61 miles and nothing to the north, period.

They say the cold and isolation will do things to a man. Make him see things that aren’t there and hear things that never happened. That isn’t what happened.

You see this is my sixth year working at the ice shack, I’m no stranger to the job. Maybe my recent breakup was causing mental stress? I doubt it, things had played out and it had obviously been time to move on.

It started when I woke in the middle of the night. I don’t know what woke me. I shivered, the wind had picked up and chilled the building.

I cranked the heater up a little more, after all I wasn’t the one buying the diesel. Still, I knew no matter how much dinosaur juice I burned, the walls would retain a certain chill to them. 

Listening to the roar, I settled back into my bed. Just as I pulled my scratchy wool comforter up to my nose, I heard it.

The crunching of snow was faint yet clear. A cautious step followed by another. The excitement of possibly seeing a bear or moose had me out of bed in an instant.

I grabbed my camera and opened the curtains. An impenetrable black rectangle stared back at me. The outdoor light had died or iced over again.

Disappointed, I closed the curtains. No way on earth would I open the door to peek out, not while the thermometer was showing -20° outside. That’s cold enough to shrivel your manhood without the wind chill.

I woke to a clear morning, no one was scheduled to use the track that day but after last night’s windstorm I knew I had a lot of snow removal ahead of me.

After putting on as many layers as I could maneuver in I stepped outside. The landscape looked like a frozen ocean with rising and falling drifts reaching across the lake.

There would be no need for the snow machines this year.

A few hundred yards from the shack was an alcove carved into the hillside. It was used to shelter the Komatsu WA485 from the wind. Even so, the engine needed to be plugged in overnight or it wouldn’t start in the winter.

I shuffled through the waist deep snow. When I reached the old machine I knocked the snow from my boots and climbed into the cab.

I used my six hours of daylight to clear the track and check the ice thickness. As I turned the loader towards the shoreline, I saw something weird.

The lights in my shack were on. This was weird because I could have sworn I turned them off. Chalking it up to my previous restless night, I parked the loader.

It was fully dark out now, I shuffled as quickly as I could back to the shack. The wind was already picking up, and with it came the bone-chilling cold.

I got to the door and rushed inside. Taking the time to brush all the snow from my clothes and the ice from my facial hair I undressed.

I grabbed a prepackaged meal and threw it into the oven.

My cushy armchair was calling to me. As I settled in, I looked to the window; the curtain was open. Puzzled, I got up and went to close it.

Despite knowing I was alone, I didn’t like the curtains being open at night. There was something about the pure darkness staring in that made me uneasy.

Grabbing the chain, I went to close it. There was a smudge on the glass, the condensation made it hard to recognize, but it looked like a handprint.

Summarizing I must have touched it last night I wiped the window clean and closed the curtains.

I was deep into my book and bowl of Chili-Mac when I heard a melodic noise outside. It had to be the wind, I reasoned.

I listened carefully, very likely tricking myself into hearing things. The human brain finds patterns in everything. My focus was no doubt creating something out of nothing.

I woke up in the middle of the night again. I lay there this time rather than getting up. The room was dark, the only light coming from the LED display on my alarm clock.

The wind had died down to a gentle rhythmic breeze. The more I lay there, the more the breeze sounded like someone breathing.

Despite the logical part of my brain telling me I was alone, I felt my heart beat increase. That feeling of flight or fight coursed down my spine.

The darkness constricted my breathing, my throat felt swollen.

My eyes constructed a specter of terror standing at the foot of my bed.

Lifting a heavy arm, I reached for the light. My fingers brushed the lamp's neck, and I grasped desperately for the switch. Ripping my eyes away from the abomination of fear, I rolled in a last ditch attempt to bring light to this nightmare.

I nearly gasped when I found the elusive button. My eyes winced as the harsh white light flooded my room.

Sitting up, I looked about manically. But I was alone.

The room sat as empty as a crypt. I shook my head, what a terrible comparison.

I did not sleep that night. I lay there with the light on, looking at the ceiling.

Only when the sun rose for its brief appearance did I leave the room. I felt nauseous, my body ached, and my head spun if I moved too quickly.

Skipping breakfast, I got dressed and made my way to the loader. I hoped some mind numbing labor would clear the previous night's memory.

After trudging through the ice-crusted snow, I stared dumbly at the Komatsu. The cord to its block heater laid uselessly on the ground. I glanced at the outdoor thermometer: negative five.

I swore bitterly. It might start, but I didn’t want to risk running the batteries down. Not when there was no way to jump start it.

I plugged it in, better late than never. I turned back to the cabin.

I have no doubt at all as to what I saw. Someone passed by the window.

I looked at my truck parked next to the cabin; its block heater was unplugged as well. Glow plugs or not, that old Powerstroke would not want to start after sitting for a week.

Now that I was alert, I noticed more things, the radio antenna was gone. Footprints tracked between the loader cover and the cabin. Dozens of various-sized bare tracks. Some with blood crusted edges.

Turning back to the loader, I weighed my options. It was less likely to start than my truck, but it was much farther from the cabin. I didn’t like the idea of approaching the building.

I nearly shit my pants when I looked at the aforementioned building; the front door was ajar. Something had exited while I wasn’t looking. 

I scrambled for the loader's ladder, my hands desperately clutching at the steel so cold I could feel it through my gloves.

Once at the top, I ripped open the door and climbed inside. There was no doubt about it, I was being hunted.

My numb fingers going the key and frantically turned it. The big bitch rolled over slow as molasses. I took a deep breath, I cycled the plugs careful to take my time.

Time I suddenly didn’t have. Something was running in my direction. Squeezing my eyes shut, I prayed harder than a whore on Armageddon.

My ears filled with the glorious sound of eleven turbocharged liters coming to life. Near tears, I put it in gear and floored it.

I drove right through that cabin and whoever was inside it.

I kept on driving.

61 miles to the next post. I would make it or die trying.

As you can tell from reading this, I didn’t die, nor was I arrested.

The military stripped me of my clearances, they withheld my pay, and they made it clear I was to keep my mouth shut.

You see, I made it to the next post, but it was empty. All six men were nowhere to be found. Their boots and clothes were still there.

The only clue I found before MPs on snowmobiles showed up and cuffed me was footprints.

A half dozen tracks made by bare feet running in the direction I had come from. Feet that bled profusely as they had not frozen yet.

I don’t know what went down out there, but I’m moving. Hawaii sounds nice,  there’s no snow there.
