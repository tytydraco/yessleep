At this point, I do not know who or where else to go to describe what I have been experiencing for the last hour. I hope by submitting what I have been through here, I can find some advice or at least some comfort to make me feel less alone and trapped wherever I am. I finished my day at work today at 5:13 pm, a little later than I usually wrap up. I have tried several times to leave the building, and I have failed to do so every time. I do not know how much longer I can go through this.

To provide some context, about a month ago I started a brand, shiny new job at a major financial institution in the city of Dallas. Fresh out of college I had always heard the job market was hell for recent grads, but I was stunned to be hired at the first place I interviewed at. Great online employee reviews, phenomenal pay, and a wide variety of benefits; it was a dream come true for an ordinary, not particularly outstanding 2.9 GPA student at the nearby state school. I hit the ground running and never looked back, devoured all the work they threw my way, and have come to appreciate and connect with the people I work with. I won't bore you with more details but I work in IT and 98% of my day consists of helping people unplug and plug things in, and even practicing the ancient technique of telling people to turn their devices off and back on again (You would be shocked how often this works). Not particularly glamorous work, but the pay is solid and the coworkers are fun and good people to work with. What I wouldn't give for a few beers and laughs with them now. I don't think I will ever be seeing them again the way I did before.

Back to today, It was a normal day of troubleshooting calls and inventory spreadsheets punctuated by a great 30-minute frozen dinner lunch with my cube mate, let's just call him Ron for this post. A few hours later, Ron wrapped up his day (he always came in an hour earlier so he left earlier) and said his goodbyes to me, winking at me and imploring me not to work too late. I was deep within a server inventory spreadsheet so I nodded to him and smiled at him, pouring back into my sheet. I didn't even take a second to look at the clock on my PC until it was already 5:13, 13 minutes past when I usually wrap up. Feeling good and set for the day I powered down my device, packed up my items from my cube, and headed down the six floors to the main entrance where my car was parked directly in front. 

A little context on the building itself, it is massive. Almost in look and feel to the point where it looks like one gigantic shopping mall. There is a Starbucks and a Deli on the ground floor that I passed by on my way out. There are probably about 15 small trees and bushes (live ones that some poor sucker has to take care of every day) dotting the walkways to the main entrance. Think of the whole building as one giant plus sign if you saw it from a sky view. As I walked out the door I noticed nothing abnormal, the fact that there were no people around was no surprise to me. Besides the security guards, I was one of the last ones out and was not accustomed to seeing anyone on my way out. As I approached the main gate, whistling to myself the same James Taylor song that was on the overhead music, I flipped my lanyard around my hand and stepped out the door into the Dallas afternoon, which was forecasted to be a shockingly cool one. As I stepped out, I will try to best describe just what happened to my body next.

Strange as it sounds, the first thing I noticed as I stepped out was the pungent odor immediately of eggs. I have always hated eggs from the texture to the smell so this nearly barreled me over as I stepped into the light. On top of that, where the parking lot should have been was only a bright, blinding light that I did not see through the door and only when I stepped outside. I (foolishly) attempted to shield the light from my face, but it was almost as if the blinding rays shot through my very flesh and directly into my eyes. My vision went dark and when I eventually was able to open my eyes, I was back at my 6th-floor cubicle staring directly at the clock on my PC. 5:13 was the time. I had lost about 5 minutes of my life walking down. But I did not lose those five minutes of my memory. Or that egg smell that still lingered in my nostrils.

My brain didn't even fully process what had happened. In utter almost trance-like shock, I walked down to the very same entrance, but this time stopped as I neared the front door. I saw everything out of the front glass window as it should be. A sky full of clouds and a dark overcast day, my 2006 Honda Civic parked exactly where I always parked it, and cars racing down the nearby freeway I always took home. It was like the very world was taunting me to try again. So understandably I did. Egg smell, bright light, cubicle, 5:13. The same series of events as last time. I tried a third time this time with eyes closed; Egg smell, bright light, cubicle, 5:13. Each time that same James Taylor song echoed ambiently overhead. I wasn't whistling anymore of my fourth try.

I tried closing my eyes and walking out with the same result. Although I had initially been disturbed, at this point the ridiculousness of the situation had made my blood boil. Absolutely nothing was out of the ordinary with the office, nothing looked off or suspicious. The building had full power and hell even internet as I write this. As an IT guy, I would have gotten hundreds of alerts had something happened with the power or the internet, but I got none. This main entrance was the only one that I could access. Before you comment I tried one of the fire doors and the same thing happened. I saw the other side of the parking lot and when I walked outside, I started to smell eggs and knew what was going to happen. Someone or something knows I am trying to leave and will not let me. It was only after that attempted fire escape exit that things began to change.

When I woke back up at my cubicle for what seemed to be the 5th time, I noticed that there was no light coming from the windows near the cubes on my floor. I do not mean it was dark out or night, there was no light or any type of movement coming from behind those glass windows. Black is a color we know and we recognize. What existed outside these windows was the complete and utter absence of any light or color at all. This, this is what terrified me. I had been confused and frustrated by whatever groundhog day time loop I was caught in but almost had not fully accepted the nature of my situation till now. I ran through the remaining 5 floors in terror, knowing that every next window I would encounter nothing but the void. As I got to the bottom floor windows I reached the main entrance and saw nothing but blackness. Well, almost nothing. Near the front door, exactly where I parked it on the now ghostly void was my car. The hood and headlights seemingly twisted into a smiling face back at me. Taunting me to try to come reach it. I slumped down at the door and stared directly into its smiling, shrieking metal hood, which I was at least semi-assured was no more than a figment of my imagination. I was focusing too much on the hood of the car that I barely noticed the passenger door swing open and a figure cock their head out of the open door to look into the entrance where I was.

I don't know how best to describe this next part without just saying it was myself. Or at least someone or something who looked EXACTLY like myself. Same cheap tie and perfectly gelled hair. I half expected him to shriek in glee or laugh at me hellishly in my complete shock and horror. But he didn't. He simply got out of the passenger seat, walked around the car to the driver seat, and hopped in. He, or it, or I started the engine, gave me a full-toothed smile and a brief wave, and drove off into the darkness. I never smile with my teeth.

In a fit of fear, anger, and desperation I screamed and banged against the glass door with all my might. I didn't get very far. The glass was searingly hot, hot enough to nearly burn the skin of my fist as I reflexively pulled them away. I slumped down to the floor sobbing as I watched the bumper of my car plunge into the distant darkness.

I am writing this back up at my desk on the 6th floor. I do not know why this is happening to me. Someone or something is keeping me from leaving here. I do not know who or what that imposter was, or if he even was real, or just a figment my terrified, angry mind conjured up to give me some reasoning or justification as to why I am trapped like this. I have now called my parents and brothers hundreds of times with no answers. I have even gone to emailing and messaging my coworkers and have gotten nothing back from any of them. I am beginning to realize I may never get a response. Throughout my texts calls and emails I failed to notice something until this moment. The time. It had not changed at all.
