   

Hello, I’m Josh and I’ve survived in what we call “the after” I’m going to teach what I learned so that anyone still using the internet can survive. I didn’t really think that Reddit or anything on the internet would still work but I guess not everyone converted. It’s fantastic to see something so old I feel a bit of nostalgia but now isn’t the time for that I need to explain everything. I doubt you don’t know but in case you don’t most humans and websites have converted to a system known as U.N.I.C. united nations internet connections. It’s basically a censored internet controlled by the world powers that still exist, when I was 13 before U.N.I.C. The United States still existed along with China and basically, all other countries but things have changed both fell after the great revolution which brought rise to new powers that created a 2nd United Nations. This “United Nations” started to take everything and make it new and by the time I was 20 they owned everything. Then they realized they could control everything so they decided to do so and now they control most of the population. Then there is me and I am ashamed to say this but I helped them I created the software and something I created we call “the after” it’s a simulation of a post-apocalyptic world one where the powers don’t exist. It was created to scare people into full obedience. It had a small problem the simulation would take a toll on your body anything that happened there happened to you. I know because I tested it.

“You ready?” The superior officer said. “Yes!” I responded cheerfully. If only I knew what I was about to experience. I was chosen as a tester to see if it would work. Me and 5 others were chosen. Jayln also known as #5, Brett also known as #4, Matthew also known as #3, Amy also known as #2, and finally Melody, or number 1. We were sent into the simulation expecting to come out a little shaken up but alive. We were wrong about both things. 

“Alright begin-” The officer's voice faded out as I awoke in a cave or what I think was one it had gray walls made out of stone as the books said I left the dark coldness of the cave to a red world. Everything was somewhat red due to the red sky that was cast over. I was surprised that something that I doubt is possible was here but I never doubted them. I walked through the forest at a slow pace and this is the first thing I learned never walk slowly. Out from a bush jumped a bobcat. These haven’t been seen for years but here they apparently exist. I barely dogged a scratch from it. It roared out it was a disturbing sound it was so real. I quickly sized up the situation and decided to run as opposed to fighting it. The thing quickly gave chase. I ran I was running out of stamina. It wasn’t. I had no idea what to do but fight I turned around to fight the beast and it slashed me with a sallow gash on my abdomen.

“Shit!” I gritted my teeth. A searing pain struck me. I punched the thing before it could pounce. It roared as my fist connected with it. Luckily the gash wasn’t deep enough to cause much blood loss. I kicked the thing but this thing wasn’t going down while it was disoriented I ran and found a broken-down apartment building and hid inside. I ran to one of the apartments that still had a door entered and locked the door behind me and ran to the other side of the room where a blunt object hit the side of my face. I felt heat rush to the place of Impact.

“Crap I’m sorry Josh!” a familiar voice said I turned to see who said it as I rubbed my cheek it was Matthew.

“I didn’t think it was well you.” he tried to explain 

“What do you mean?” I asked 

“Haven’t you seen the ghouls outside?” he looked at me with a puzzled expression 

“Ghouls what? No all I’ve seen is a bobcat.” I said in a high-pitched voice

“A  bobcat? So it wasn’t from a ghoul.” He looked at my abdomen at the place of the wound from my attempt to kill a bobcat. 

“No, it wasn’t from a ghoul,” I said then I said something I regret to this day “Can I see one of these ghouls?”

“Look outside.” He gestured at a hole in the wall. I looked outside and saw dead bodies walking. Wasn’t this supposed to be realistic well the U.N.I.C. said it was and I trust them so it must be! I reassured myself I believed their lies. The rotting bodies were surprisingly detailed to look as if they weren’t even buried they looked as if they were screaming in fear of something their faces stuck in a twisted frown forever. I wanted to cry for them but I decide not to. 

“Matthew how do we get out,” I asked

“The door.” He said bluntly

“No, I mean out of the simulation,” I told him slightly annoyed.

“When they pull us out.” He said

“Damn it!” I backed away distrusted I hated this I wanted out. Then i saw the bobcat running in the streets and the ghouls saw it and attacked it the bobcat fought back but was overwhelmed and the ghouls ripped his flesh from his bones after 10 seconds it stopped screaming and they had a feast of intestines and muscles to eat. 

“Hey, matt remember that door? Let’s use it to leave.” I said

“Nah the ghouls with kill us.” He said

“I think they are distracted by a certain bobcat,” I said

“Ha Alright.” He said and we ran. We got out of that city and on our way out I saluted to thank the now-dead bobcat for saving us. I thought we were safe then I realized that the bobcat wasn’t that meaty and I heard the growls of a group of ghouls behind me. We ran not even checking how many were behind us.

“I thought they were distracted what the hell man!” Matthew yelled

“Turns out these things eat fast!” I yelled back. We entered the forest the ghouls following us at a very good running speed. I didn’t remember much from before The Great Revolution but I remember ghouls didn’t run fast. We were running out of stamina and I had a theory maybe we get winded and they don’t. We were so distracted with getting away that we didn’t see the drop and I fell down about 10 feet. Matthew stopped running after I fell he was trapped with the ghouls I felt a pain engulf my whole body and I yelled to Matthew   
 “Tell them to bring me out I’ll see you when I get out!” 

“Ok- ahhhahahahahahahhah!” He screamed I knew you could feel pain but his screams were bone-chilling I plugged by ear and began crying I hated hearing someone else screaming especially in such a painful way. I am going to post this and then get a move on I need to follow the rebellion but in summary, what you’ve learned so far is never walk slowly. These things don’t get winded, and the ghouls eat fast as hell. I will post what happened after tomorrow. Until then Josh Rider signing off.
