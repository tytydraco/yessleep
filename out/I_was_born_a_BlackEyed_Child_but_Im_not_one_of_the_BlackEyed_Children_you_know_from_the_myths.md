I came into the world, not as a normal human being. When they saw me come out of my mother's womb, my parents saw me as a monster. My parents were fanatically religious, to the point where they even questioned God himself why they believed He cursed them.

My hair is jet black, and my eyes are demonic black without pupils. My skin is snow-white with black veins under the skin for all to see. I wore simple clothing, a black shirt, shorts, socks, and sneakers when I grew from a newborn to a child.

When I was growing up, I was subjected to home-schooling by my parents, believing me to be unfit for the outside world. I never got sick at all, which made my parents more paranoid. When they took me to the hospital each year, they told the doctors to draw some of my blood so they could know what was happening to their child.

Even with all this, they never found a reason to physically or verbally abuse me. They never did in the first place, and I had never done anything wrong. They just left me alone to let me do my thing by watching TV Shows with a blank expression on my face.

The doctors told my parents I never needed Food, Drink, or Sleep, and I never even needed to defecate or urinate. But this piece of news caused parents to become even more paranoid about their son becoming a potential monster. It was after my 10th Birthday that my parents abandoned me, and in fact, I'm still a Black-Eyed Child to this day.

I stayed in my former home until midnight after my parent's departure, knowing it was time to run away. I ran away from my home and my neighborhood and ran endlessly through the state of Oklahoma. Because of the lack of Food, Drink, or Sleep, I always stay energized from running any distance.

I got to Tulsa almost two days after I left the neighborhood I grew up in. It was nighttime, and the streets were quiet, with barely any cars to hear. I walked endlessly, hoping to find a place to stay. However, things sometimes go differently than planned, as I heard a car slowly driving toward me.

I looked to see a deranged person who saw me as a real-life monster. I never felt fear in my life, and I still haven't.

"Kid... I'm sorry for what I must do... You are nothing more than a monster now..."

I watched the man walk up to me with an enraged expression as he pulled out a knife and stabbed me in the chest. But the thing that horrified the man was that I. Did not. React.

I felt no pain from the stabbing as I took out the knife, and my wound healed instantly, almost as if the wound was never there. The man was terrified, realizing that he could never kill me. He desperately pulled out his Glock and tried gunning me down. But I shrugged off the bullets, terrifying him even more.

I don't know why this man tried to kill me. Perhaps he saw me before I saw him, but whatever made him do this must've been unpleasant. I walked over to the deranged man as he wasted his ammo on me. I healed from my wounds, grabbed his Glock, and used the final bullet on his leg, making him unable to walk. It was apparent that I had other Superhuman abilities besides my healing factor.

When I was beginning to walk away, it turned out the deranged man wasn't done with me yet, as he pulled out a second Glock on me. But before he could try gunning me down again, several vehicles arrived, causing the deranged man to scream in agony as several younger people restrained him.

Eventually, those people I found out were the deranged man's family would turn to see me in horror, seeing me as the monster I am.

Minutes after, the police arrived to detain the gunman for a trip to a mental hospital. The deputy of the police force of Tulsa, whose name I will not reveal, walked over to me and asked me a few questions, like how I survived the attack, why the deranged man tried to gun me down, etc.

After I gave him the best answers I could give him, the Police Deputy gave me a pat on the back and said these words that I took to heart.

"If you wanna make something of yourself, then take true responsibility for your Great Power..."

I silently nodded as I walked away from the crime scene. I was allowed to stay at a hotel because of the attempted murder. Although I don't know how long I'll be staying at said hotel, I know that people are starting to recognize me. I don't know where my life will go when more people start to know who I am, but I do know one more thing.

**I am the Black-Eyed Child, and no one can stop or kill me...**
