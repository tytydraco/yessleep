I was lost, lost in a world that seemed to have no end. The Labyrinth had consumed me, and I was no longer in control of my own fate. It was all because of my daughter, the one I had lost to a rare mental illness.

I had dedicated my life to finding a cure for her, but in the end, it was all for naught. She had passed away, and I was left with nothing but my guilt and my grief. My wife had left me, and my once-successful practice was now a distant memory.

One night, as I stumbled through the streets, drunk and despondent, I found myself drawn to an old abandoned building. It seemed to call out to me, and I entered without thinking. Before I knew it, I was transported to the Labyrinth.

The first room I entered was like nothing I had ever seen before. The walls were made of pulsating flesh, and the floor was covered in writhing tentacles. I tried to turn back, but the door had vanished, leaving me trapped in the room. That's when I heard the voice, a sinister voice that whispered to me of my failures and my weaknesses.

I knew I had to get out of there, and so I began to search for a way out. The room had multiple doors, but only one held the key. I had to choose carefully, as each door led to a different fate. Some doors were traps, designed to test my mental and physical fortitude. Others were normal doors that required me to solve a puzzle to progress. And then there were the secret doors, hidden away and difficult to find, but offering rewards beyond my wildest dreams.

I survived that first room, but it was only the beginning of my journey. Each room presented a new challenge, a new puzzle to solve or trap to avoid. I encountered creatures that defied description and landscapes that twisted my mind. But through it all, I was driven by a single goal: to escape the Labyrinth and return to the real world.

As I progressed deeper into the Labyrinth, I began to uncover the truth behind its existence. It was a place created by those who had suffered from mental illness, a place to escape the pain and torment of their own minds. But it had grown beyond their control, becoming a living, breathing entity that fed on the suffering of others.

I knew that I had to find a way to stop the Labyrinth, to save others from the fate that had befallen me. It was a daunting task, but I was driven by a newfound sense of purpose. I continued to push forward, solving puzzles and avoiding traps, until I finally reached the heart of the Labyrinth.

a dark presence was always following me, something ominous something.... dark, and as I entered one of the Corridor all light went off, I flashed my flashlight and looking here and there, and there I saw , for what the abomination it was and it was a monster that embodied all of my fears. It chased me relentlessly through the twisting corridors, and I could feel its hot breath on the back of my neck. My heart was pounding in my chest, and I was gasping for breath as I ran as fast as I could.

I could see the exit ahead of me, and I pushed myself to run faster. The monster was closing in on me, and I knew that I had to make it to the exit before it caught me. Just as the monster was about to grab me, I dove through the exit and tumbled out into the real world.

As I emerged from the old abandoned building, I felt a sense of peace that I had not known since my daughter's death. 

I reported this incident to the Authority, but I was too drunk for anyone to believe me. I tried to do some digging but it was all useless. But something unexpected happened.

I was Visited by a few gentlemen ,they said that they were from ORION or something like that, none of them were Americans, they were Indians, the told me that what I experienced was some kind of mass  hysteria, they took some test of me that required me to go to india, they did the test and said that i was free to go, they also gave me a small tour of their city, i loved india so much that i decide to stay and start my new life and phycologist here,  had found a new purpose in life, to help others who were struggling with their own mental illnesses. I don't known if it was real but The Labyrinth had taken so much from me, but it had also given me a new sense of purpose, a new reason to keep fighting.  


Today I start my new clinic here.
