Used to work IT for the Department of Natural Resources (EHA Division\*)\*. You’ve never heard of them. You’re not supposed to. They handle “environmental hazard anomalies.”

I’ve been sitting on this for months, hiding. It’s from 4 years back. I wasn’t going to post it.

Two nights ago, I started hearing the same sound they described in the Harrow’s Lake recordings. Low, pulsing, through the walls. It’s getting louder.

I’ve compressed and uploaded what I took. I’m pasting one of the main files here before my connection drops again.

If you’re in Western Canada, stay away from frozen lakes. Especially if you hear anything under the ice.

Copy and pasted below directly from the classified PDF. Apologies for any strange formatting errors.

# DOCUMENT HL-2193-A - Post-Recovery Material Analysis

**Classification:** Level 4 - For Internal Use Only  
**Origin:** Environmental Hazard Analysis Division  
**Recovered:** March 2021  
**Subject:** Subsurface Acoustic Patterns - Harrow’s Lake

# 1. Overview

Following the Loss of Survey Team 07 and the subsequent recovery of partial sensor data from Harrow’s Lake, the Division initiated long-term acoustic monitoring.

What began as a presumed gas-venting phenomenon has evolved into a *structured* resonance pattern occurring annually between February 10 - 15. Further analysis required.

The sound cannot be fully categorized as biological. Spectrogram shows frequency bands that form *linguistic cadence patterns.*

It is communicating.

# 2. Audio Data Summary

**Timestamp:** February 14, 2021 - 02:14:00

**Duration:** 11 minutes, 48 seconds

**Detected Pulses:** Seven rhythmic bursts between 28 - 33 Hz

**Anomaly:** Secondary modulation overlay consistent with *human speech at 0.7x temporal speed*

Translations yielded the following transcription:

“We remember the pressure."  
"The warmth above."  
"You are built from what we left behind.”

# 3. Material Interaction

Attempts to drill through the ice shelf following the 2021 event resulted in immediate equipment failure.

Recovered drill bits displayed what Nick refereed to as "crystalline distortion", as though the metal lattice had been rearranged.

Material scientists note the pattern resembles *coral growth under electron microscopy*.

However, no biological residue was present.

When submerged in saltwater, the samples emit faint vibrations (31–33 Hz), matching the anomaly frequency.

# 4. Personnel Exposure

Individuals exposed to raw audio files for more than 90 seconds reported:

* Vibrations in bones or teeth
* Persistent auditory hallucinations (“breathing under the floor”)
* Visual distortions near reflective surfaces
* Compulsion to return to the sound source

Exposure appears addictive.

Three staff members were terminated after unauthorized playback of the recordings at home.

Their homes later exhibited patterns matching the Harrow.

This specific situation was escalated to LEVEL 5.

# 5. Substructure Findings

Ground-penetrating radar detected a hollow space beneath the lake bed measuring approximately 400 meters long and 20 meters high, with arch-like geometry.

Thermal imaging shows the cavity is *warmer* than surrounding rock by 3°C, despite being sealed beneath permafrost.

Inside the cavity, vibration sensors recorded something moving. A rolling, circular motion, as if a massive object were breathing.

# 6. Suppression Orders

Public access to Harrow’s Lake and the surrounding five kilometers has been restricted under the guise of “unstable terrain and methane hazards.”

Satellite imagery was altered to reflect “dry sediment collapse.”

Requests to investigate further have been denied under Directive 9F-014 - Glacial Subsurface Entity Containment.

*(Note: Directive 9F-014 references older files from 1954, originally labeled “Churchill Subsurface Resonance”. No digital copy exists.)*

# 7. Addendum | Transmission Pattern

On February 14, 2022, the anomaly increased amplitude by 400% and briefly synchronized with national water-treatment telemetry.

Multiple water sensors across Saskatchewan and Alberta began broadcasting the same 7-pulse pattern before remote disconnection.

Internal memo excerpt (EHA Director L. Singh):

“If this pattern continues to replicate through infrastructure, it may not remain isolated to Harrow’s Lake. Sound travels in water. And every living thing on this continent is mostly water.”

# 8. Current Status

Containment efforts have shifted from isolation to information suppression.

All related personnel have signed NDAs under National Safety Act §19.4.

Satellite monitoring continues. No excavation authorized.

Next pulse expected: February 14, 2026 - 02:14 a.m.

Predicted amplitude: \[REDACTED\]
