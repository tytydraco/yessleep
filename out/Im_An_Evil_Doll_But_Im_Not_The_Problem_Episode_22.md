https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/NED7me104z

Revenge, so much has been said about the subject, I can’t really think of a new spin to put on how I’m feeling. 

Will might not have been the Bishop, but by any metric, he’s screwed us all over. If ever there was a person who dug their own grave, it’s him. 

Like the dog that catches the car though, once we had him at our mercy, we didn’t really know what to do. 

Alex tore the revenant down to a limbless torso. Tearing out his hipbone and leaving his bottom half a hanging mess of black, leathery organs. 

We let it happen, half shock, half being in the moment. But eventually good sense and unfortunate morality kicked in. 

Alex wouldn’t give him up, and seeing as none of us has the first clue what happened to the kid, we weren’t really keen on making  her. She’d came by her rage honestly. 

Eventually though Alex gets distracted by something only she can see and we lock Will in the basement. His head wrapped in some old leather jackets, mouth stuffed with a ball gag,  to try and tone down the volume of his screaming. 

Alex locks herself in her room for 3 days. When we walk by we hear one sided conversations, giggling and nonsense. 

The rest of us sit around the kitchen table, intent on having a couple of awkward conversations but lacking the will to begin. 

“Do we talk about Alex or the lump first?” Mike asks, breaking the silence. 

“I don’t have the energy to start off with Alex.”, Sveta replies. Her face still looking thin and malnourished. 

“At this point, we’re killing him in cold blood.” Leo offers. 

“Isn’t that your forte?” Kaz asks, genuinely curious. 

“I can get why you think that. Especially given how things have played out lately. But my people are hunters, not killers. 

We try and keep things from jumping off, thin the herd here and there. But besides the real inbred weirdos  who haven’t left Appalachia since the 50s, we don’t go around scorching the earth and salting the land.” Leo replies, unoffended. 

“So, what then? We let him go? Wait for him to find some new limbs and come after us again?” Mike questions. 

“I don’t think he’s going to be healing from anything.” Hyve begins, “There are some strange forces at play within Alex.”

“Even so, how is letting him evil around the place even an option? Fuck this guy.” I add. 

“There’s always strings attached.

 Would I have killed him if I got ahold of him in the Museum? Without a second thought. 

But who knows what fallout we’d be dealing with now if I did.” Sveta replies. 

“Why don’t we make him live up to his end of the bargain, and ask what he would prefer?

I can’t imagine there’s much appeal living indefinitely in his…state.” Kaz volunteers.  
 
“In other words, no answer. Great. 

I guess it’s time to talk about Alex then.” Leo prompts. 

“What’s there to talk about?” Hyve questions. 

Leo, Mike and Sveta look to each other. 

“We don’t even know if Alex is still in there.” Sveta begins, uncomfortably. 

“And if she is, I don’t know if that’s better or worse. 

We’ve seen what she’s capable of. What about if next time it’s someone that doesn’t deserve it? Does she know the difference anymore? 

We’ve all tried talking to her, it’s like having a conversation with a badly tuned radio.” Leo takes no joy in what he says. 

“Why is everyone looking at me all of the sudden?” I ask, “My problem has always been having too much control over what I do.”

“What are you all saying?

This is a child, her body was harmed, but she remains.” Kaz pleads. 

“Maybe. But Kaz, what kind of life is she going to be able to lead?

She sure as hell can’t go back to her family now. She’s not any kind of entity I’ve heard of, so there’s no one to teach her about herself. No lore, or mysticism  to let her know what she needs to survive. 

She’s not one of yours, she’s not one of mine. She’s no hybrid, either. 

I don’t know if we understand what would or wouldn’t be cruel right now.” Sveta laments. 

“Mike, Punch, if you two can get Alex’s attention, I think I’ve figured out a way to shut up the doorstop downstairs. Temporarily,  at least.“ Leo says without much hope. 



“Alex, kid, is it alright if I come in?” Mike says softly, knocking at the bedroom door. 

Whispers, cryptic and sinister. 

“If there’s anyone that knows about body horror, it’s me. I don’t mind listening.” I’ve lost count of how many burner phones I’ve used, but the voice app on this one is off-brand SpongeBob I think. 

Silence. 

Cautiously, Mike opens the door. 

A pale hand, unnaturally gangly and clawed lashes out. Mike avoids being blinded by inches as he slams the door shut. 

“ Fuck!” He says, eyes wide. 

“Quarter for the swear jar.” Says a voice from within the room. It has to be Alex, but it doesn’t sound like her. 

“Any ideas?” Mike asks as we hear Leo and the rest getting Will from downstairs. 

I nod.

“If you’re not Alex, that’s okay.” I begin, “Maybe you’re her, maybe you’re something in her body. Either way it seems like you need help. 

I’m a broken evil doll. Kaz is a Candyman who doesn’t like making deals. Leo is a monster hunter who spends his free time with nothing but monsters.” 

Mike looks to me, motioning to let him talk. 

“Having a party line in your skull sucks. Trust me, I know. 

Or maybe it isn’t that, but either way…

What we’re trying to say, is, we’re all here for a reason.” . 

The whispers have slowed, the sounds of force and scratching from within the guest room have  stopped. 

The door opens, just a crack, Mike instinctively backs away, flinching. 

The room is dim, we see half of Alex’s face. In the poor light, you could almost forget anything had happened. 

“It’s still…me.” She says timidly, “Kind of.”.

The Museum took its took on all of us. Leo, Sveta and Mike are all still sporting half-healed wounds and the after effects of malnutrition. 

None of us really have a right to complain though, compared to Alex we got off easy.

She hasn’t changed so much as put new clothing atop the blood soaked, shredded rags she was wearing. It breaks my heart to see that keeping herself together enough just to walk down the stairs is taking all her effort. 

Everyone talks to her like a smart pet or a slow child. I can see frustration brewing on her face. Mike looks uncomfortable. 

Leo holds a massive syringe filled with a thick, yellow fluid. Will, wrapped in layers of leather and sheets vainly struggles on the table. 

“What is that?” Kaz says, his tone accusatory. 

“You’ve heard of a painkiller? Aspirin, morphine?

Well, this is a pain war criminal. Hard to get ahold of, but useful to have on hand.” Leo explains, in a needlessly violent manner. 

“Well and good if someone has things like nerves, and a circulatory system. Our friend relies on neither.” Kaz debates. 

Leo’s expression doesn’t change but his tone is smug. 

“I’m sure it’s been a while since his body has been anything other than a container for what keeps him going. 

But that’s where the kid comes into play.” 

Mike, Kaz and Sveta look shocked.

“We have no idea what kind of forces are causing these reactions. They could have effects beyond what we see.” Hyve worries. 

“And I don’t really like the idea of using her as some kind of medical device. 

Fuck sake, what if he gets control of her, like he can with Punch? Hell, what if he just does that and uses him to gut her. 

No offence.” Mike says, trying to keep his volume level. 

“A little taken.” I reply. 

“We’re past the point of being able to worry about every little ‘what if’ in the situation. The bishop sure as hell doesn’t. 

Maybe we all catch soul flu and spend eternity as ghosts shitting ourselves  inside out. It’s a possibility Will gets supercharged when he catches a dose of this. 

But right now, it’s our only shot. And we have to take it.” I can’t tell if Leo is using any of his magic when he talks, but I also don’t really care. I’m scared, and Dutch or no, I need courage.

Alex begins to rummage through the fridge 

“It’s on you if this goes tits up Leo.” Sveta warns as everyone begins to unwrap the screaming corpse. 

At first when I see Will I get a sense of shame. Dead is one thing, but the look in his eyes, the ever-dripping, shifting, amputation wounds. They don’t make a person feel like they’re on the right side of things. 

But as he looks to me, I feel fear. Everything is on the table, any rule is up for debate at this point. Will is one lucky break from getting away and plotting something worse for all I know. 

Leo starts to turn to Alex, to ask his favor. 

“I’ve got this. You’re bad at kid.” Mike says, “Alex, we’ve got a favor to ask…yeah she’s eating raw eggs.” Mike laughs, unable to regain his composure as Alex looks toward us. 

“Answers the uncomfortable question of what she eats.” Kaz says, hopeful. 

Sveta scrambles out of her chair. Dashing toward the broken child.

I’m sure everyone is thinking the same thing I was. These eggs were some kind of component. Poison, or rare to the point of being invaluable. 

No, sometimes it’s the little monsters that sneak in easiest. We haven’t bought fresh food since the start of this mess. Those eggs were fit for nothing other than revenge on a neighbor.

She cries about her stomach in two voices. When she vomits, muscles no human has seize. In between pained bouts of nausea she rambles about corners of reality and the apocalypse.

But at the end of the day, we all spend 4 hours helping a kid who ate something she shouldn’t have. For all of the twisted, incomprehensible things going on, it was a little island of normal. 

After Sveta gets Alex cleaned up and changed, we all stand around the table. Looking at the fruits of our labor. 

“I want to go over this one more time. 

Alex, you grab Will’s heart. Just touch it, we need him alive.” Leo says. 

“And, ripping the guy apart is cruel.” Mike says, giving Leo an exasperated look, “After we’re done, we’ll figure out something for you to eat. 

You okay with this kid?”

Alex’s eyes are glazed, she shakes her head, focusing, “I am.” She says. 

 The way the centuries old, vestigial organ starts to turn into a glistening, crimson muscle is almost beautiful. Blue veins start to snake through Will’s flesh. His skin slowly begins to reach a shade that, while unhealthy, is almost human. 

Will begins to scream loud enough it cuts easily through the ball gag. Lungs inflate, lymph fluid begins to drip onto the floor as nerves reknit themselves. 

“What are you waiting for Leonard?” Kaz yells over Will’s animalistic wailing. 

Leo isn’t gentle with the syringe. Jamming the oversized plunger with his palm, and roughly injecting a couple shot glasses worth of dimly glowing gel into the half-corpse. 

Within seconds Will stops thrashing, stops screaming. His exposed heart and lungs slow to a normal speed. The look in his eyes goes from pain-crazed to annoyed. 

“Mike, take the gag out.” Leo instructs. 

“Fuck you?” Mike says phrasing it like a question, “I’m not getting bitten by a zombie.” 

“That’s not how…I’ll do it.” Kaz says, removing the gag. 

“I suppose y’all will be wanting me to square up.” Will says. 

His cordial tone is shocking. And if I’m being honest, scares the hell out of me. 

“How tough are you planning on making things?” Leo says, taking a seat. 

“If I could, I’d kill the whole mess of you.  

But being locked in a cellar, experiencing pain that’d make god himself take an aspirin, gave me some time to think.” Will begins. 

“And?” Sveta says, impatiently. 

“There was no way y’all could have came out on top. Not one of you had a damn thing that could have put a dent in me. 

Not even you, Lassie.

I learned everything about you 6. 

But none of that was enough. Somehow, this is where I ended up.” Will explains. 

“Sore loser, I get it, now make with the information.” Mike says.

“You ain’t hearing me Clown. 

What do you know about good and evil?” Will asks, cryptically.

“A myth.” Hyve says dismissively. 

“Some think that. I don’t. 

And tell me you can’t see the face cards in your little group. The king, the knight, the knave?” Will says, tauntingly. 

“I’m so lost.” Mike replies. 

“I’m not talking about concepts. 

Ever wonder where the buck stops with the paranormal? A thousand religions, a billion stories, uncountable legends. They can’t all be true, but they all have a little something, don’t they?

Above the old ones, and the void gods. There are two people, for lack of a better term. Good and Evil. 

They exist for one purpose. To keep the natural order. 

Infinite power, pigeonholed into a single goal. 

Good, handles the mortal world. Evil handles the void. 

Now, what the ‘Natural order’ is, we have no clue. That’s  some reading the mind of god shit. Impossible. 

But we do know one thing. 

Humanity, as a whole is not meant to know about the void. It going from an open secret to a fact, would be catastrophic. 

It’s happened, events too large and obvious to explain away. Things that would lead to people understanding the void.  Roanoke comes to mind.  

It's then Good has to step in. Reweave the fabric of time and space, make it so things simply didn’t happen. 

This kind of thing takes it’s toll on the universe though, makes history a little bit of a guessing game. Some folks call it the Mandela Effect, others Déjà vu.” Will explains. 

All of this is scaring the hell out of me. Leo, on the other hand, looks disappointed.

“The Bishop’s plan is just a curtain pull? That’s, I don’t know, mundane. 

It always gets stomped down, too many entities and groups have a vested interest in keeping things covert. 

Personally, I think the whole ‘Good and Evil’ thing is just a cult for monsters. But at the end of the day, the Bishop still ends up screwed no matter what does it.” Leo questions. 

Will smiles, relishing in having a little bit of leverage. Some knowledge we lack. 

“You’re thinking in the wrong direction.” The half-corpse teases. 

“So, he’s going to tell demons and shit we exist? 

Hey Hyve, you know we exist right?” Mike says, sarcastically. 

“First, I am a Malignant. Second, I understand what Will means. 

I know it can seem like the world is lousy with things like myself. Everyone seems to have some tale of a brush with those not of this earth. 

But that is a mere fraction of a fraction of a percent of my kind. Even the lowliest of us that you could encounter are those with the power and agency to get here.” Hyve explains. 

“Bingo. 

You think a few billion humans knowing there is a whole other world to exploit would be Armageddon?  
  
They don’t have names for the number of things in the void. And those trillions of trillions, knowing this place was out there?

Just the wars it’d cause as they decided who goes first would warp the fabric of reality. 

The Dutchman plans on a pilgrimage to Hell and he’s going to take a couple dozen good folks with him.” Will reveals, telling us some website information I can’t reveal here. 

What it shows though is an invitation for what the Bishop dubs the “Steel Toe Revival”. The website promises salvation for even the most wayward of god’s children. 

The location is remote and the audience small. The perfect opportunity to get a handful of folks not likely to be noticed if they go missing. 

“Mike, you get your army, I’ll make some kit and we all show up to the revival ready to confess some sins. The Bishop won’t know what hit him.” Leo asserts. 

“You could. 

But that ol’ boy, he’s got more lives than a cat. Paranoia and power make a hell of a combination. 

You’d win the shootout. But somewhere, he’d be back. Only now, you don’t know what he looks like. You don’t know what he can do. Where he is. And he has all the time in the world to plan. 

That preacher has a million ways to avoid his soul passing through the void.” Will explains. 

“But if we hit him closer to his destination…” Sveta leads. 

“Exactly. 

Where what’s left ends up is a mystery, but it all goes through the void to get there. 

But that’s not the information I’m trading. That’s what you call a ‘Good Faith’ payment. 

Let’s talk how I end up when y’all go chasing a lunatic through hell. 

If your fixing to kill me, just sit me up facing the sunrise. 

If any of you has a notion to let bygones be bygones though, I wouldn’t argue.” Will offers. 

“Both options seem cruel at this point.” Sveta begins, “You’ve destroyed a child and killed my husband. I don’t see how I can let you live.” Sveta sounds like she’s searching for a reason to commit to a plan of action. 

“For what it’s worth, I have no clue what in the hell happened to the half-pint. 

I ain’t shedding any tears, business is business, and I’ve done a sight worse than child murder. But, murder’s where I would have left things. 

How about this? I tell you what to expect on the trip to the void, then we flip a coin. 

Heads I see the sunrise, tails you drop me off somewhere dark and let me figure things out. And if I’m lying to you, you can come back and let the kid have another turn with me.” Is Will’s Grim offer. 

We, backed into a corner as we are. Have no choice but to agree.

“I won’t be able to join you.” Hyve says. 

“Why is that? Seems like we’d want a local.” I reply. 

“If I were to be there, I wouldn’t be who you know. I would simply be the chaotic denizen I was.” Hyve says, ashamed. 

“I would be hesitant to make the trip as well. 

There would be an amount of temptation I wouldn’t trust myself to resist.” Kaz adds. 

“Not the worst situation, we need someone to look after Alex anyway.” Leo says. 

“I wish your aim was as bad as your ideas, Hoss. 

That kid is the only trick you’re going to have. She’s unknown, and where you’re going that’s the closest you’re going to get to a deterrent.” Tension rises as will talks, “There’s three turns on the path to the void. You’re going to be tempted to go as fast as possible. Do not do this. 

There, your not just your flesh and blood. You’re all the concepts that make you, the farther you go the more you’re going to feel this. Go too fast, it’s like the ethereal version of the bends. 

This alone kills or destroys most of the mortals that try the trip. Some people have things within their soul and destiny that simply tear them apart. 

The first turn is the wilderness. This is where things that never were run wild. No advice to give, what you find there will be unique. And angry.

Next you will get to the city. This is where all of the truth seekers and braggarts congregate. It’s not the void proper, it’s simply a waypoint carved out by the most twisted of pilgrims. Too smart to throw themselves into the void but too demented to return home. 

Last, before the void proper, is the wall. Miles and miles of terrain designed with one goal. To keep mortals from reaching the void. This is where you will catch up with the Bishop. 

The other turns are vast, incomprehensible. But there is only one path through the wall that a mortal, even one as tainted by the void as the Bishop could even hope to take.” No one debates Will. We all hate him, but he’s the only lead we have. 

Before we go on our hunt for the bishop, we flip that coin. Advertising the outcome seemed, ghoulish so I’ll let you guys fill in the blanks on that one. 



As far as plans go, it’s probably the most straightforward one so far. The massive, tattered tent is guarded by a handful of humans. Mike and a half dozen of his lunatics make short work of the sentries. 

Then it’s just a matter of timing. 

We have to hit when the Bishop has finished his ritual, we have to make him think he’s escaping, not opening a door for us to follow. 

So we wait. Crouched at the edge of the dull light from within the tent. Watching around twenty people buy the fire and brimstone sermon of the Bishop hook line and sinker. 

His words are more than just twisted theology. A power begins to build inside the tent. Sermon turns to ritual as the One of the Bishop’s clergymen brings in a foal. 

The young horse looks confused, terrified of the crowd and the unnatural feeling around it. 

The sermon takes on a darker tone, blood, power and sacrifice. Redemption through vile acts. 

A few people leave at this point. Good sense overcoming the brewing compulsion from the bishop. Thankfully none notice us. 

Behind him the Bishop hangs a glossy, white silk sheet. He rants about purity and value, any sense in his statements lost in the lunatic vigor of his speech. 

Wind without a source begins to blow inside of the tent. The remaining people are nervous, but enthralled by what’s happening. 

We all wince as the Bishop slits the foal’s throat. His sermon taking a turn toward the purifying nature of pilgrimage. Christian imagery is crudely married to occult ritual. The bishop begins to draw a large oval on the sheet in the horse’s blood. 

“Pray with me! If your worthless lives have ever meant anything to you, pray with me!” The bishop screams, as he finishes the last of the symbols surrounding the oval. 

The stars seem to fade, the isolated field we are in is plunged into darkness. The Bishop’s tent the only source of light. 

The crowd prays, nothing so structured as the lord’s prayer though. More a cacophony of screamed pleas for aid from a god that hopefully isn’t listening. 

Behind the Bishop the blood drawn oval begins to steam. Dripping crimson energy to the floor like molten steel. His body blocks what’s behind it, but the crude image has turned into a gateway. 

Mike starts to move. 

“Not yet.” Leo says, holding him back with one arm. 

Tentatively, the remaining dozen or so parishioners start to walk toward the bishop. His sermon begins to praise the brave, the faithful, those willing to risk everything for their god. 

“Go time.” Leo whispers as the last of the damned group walks through the rift. 

Leo announces our arrival with gunfire, purposely missing the bishop, but tearing apart a speaker next to him. 

He looks to us with a twisted grin on his dead eyed face. He throws his arms wide, as if unconcerned by things as trivial as gunfire and werewolves. 

Then, I saw it. 

Inside that rapidly shrinking, energy dripping portal was a place no one was meant to go. 

Horrors, a vast senseless field of things too wrong to live and too angry to die. Energy pours out of the portal in amounts that dwarf anything we’ve seen so far.  

I’d thought I’d seen what goes bump in the night. Had the veil lifted on the secrets of the universe. But the barest glimpse of what waited for us on the turns to the void showed me I didn’t know a damn thing. 

Without a second of hesitation, the Bishop gives us a small salute, ducking into the now waist-high rift. 

All of us, from creature of the night to hardened hero pause. Everything we’ve been doing so far, has been like fighting a fire. The realization hits us, now we’re planning on jumping into a volcano. 

We’re going to go in. We’ve all came too far, and lost too much to stop now. But what are the chances you guys hear from me again? This isn’t some torture chamber, or backrooms knock-off, for all intents and purposes, we’re going to hell. 

Till next time, not that I’m too confidant there will be a next time. 

Best wishes from Hell.

Punch.
