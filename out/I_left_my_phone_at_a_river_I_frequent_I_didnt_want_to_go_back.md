I live in the far-north of the state of Queensland, Australia. As a result of the tropical latitude, and my proximity to the coastline, there are a lot of interesting and beautiful places to explore and relax within a relatively short distance of where I reside.

I'm a young man just out of high school, and as such I definitely possess a level of arrogance - I've just moved out of home, I'm doing my dream course at university and overall everything is seeming to be going my way.

On a recent Saturday afternoon I had just finished my cooking and cleaning to prepare for the next week, and decided with about three hours of daylight to spare to make the hour and a quarter drive up to a waterhole / waterfall area I had been to a few times since I had moved.

This waterfall was about three quarters of the way up a twenty kilometre long winding single lane mountain range road that had a very small township at the summit before the road ended and turned into farmland. It is a very beautiful and sometimes popular area, however I had decided to go later to avoid the families that may have been having a late lunch. I still expected there to be at least a few people up there at the time as it was a Saturday on a long weekend.

The waterhole is about fifteen kilometres up a mountain range off the main highway that runs up and down the Australian Pacific Coast. I arrived at the base of the mountain at about quarter to five, which gave me about half an hour to swim which was plenty for me. The weather wasn't awesome, a low cloud ceiling almost had the majority of the road obscured from the reduced visibility.

As I pulled into the small gravel carpark of the waterhole, I noted that the only car in the carpark, and the only car I'd seen in twenty-five minutes since I'd exited off the highway, was an older white Toyota Hilux. I was a bit surprised, as I really didn't think that it was so late in the afternoon that I was one of the only people there.

I made my way down the two flights of stone stairs that ran under the bridge that crosses the stream about midway down the swimmable area. I decided I'd go and check the largest waterhole to see if it was free, as it had the best area to sit on a shelf underneath the largest of three waterfalls.

As I climbed up the smooth rock faces towards the uppermost waterhole, I saw a towel, a purple Melbourne Storm cap and two swim shirts laying on a boulder abeam where I was climbing. I thought this may have been indicative of the driver and likely passenger of the Hilux I'd seen being close by.

I peered my head over the largest of the boulders I'd had to climb and down into the bowl-shaped swimming hole fed by a strong waterfall, expecting to see a couple as I'd grown to expect from this particular area. I was surprised when I saw no-one, and so I climbed down into the bowl.

Something about being down in that waterhole that late in the afternoon made me uncomfortable. I'm not usually the type of person to spook easily, however I just felt incredibly exposed and trapped. I decided I'd wander further downstream to some of the smaller streams that I usually swam in.

I waded for twenty minutes in a dimly lit stream that had brush encroaching on it on either side, and I felt relaxed and at ease after a stressful month of exams. 

The sun began to move below the trees, and as it did everything quickly became dark. Mid-deciding I was ready to leave I suddenly felt a strong urge to run. I had come to the slightly terrifying realisation that I was isolated alone on a mountain with no reception as the sun was setting and that I had not seen another living thing for over an hour.

I honestly freaked out like a little girl, grabbed my towel, my keys and my shirt and bolted back up the gravel trail through the forest, back up the stone stairs and was back at the carpark in just under three minutes. As I ran into the carpark I noticed that the Hilux was gone and that my fears had been confirmed - I was completely alone.

I started my car and spun my wheels out of the carpark. I drove down the mountain range at a speed that was probably faster than safe, however I didn't really care at the time. I contemplated the feeling of dread I felt in that moment down in the stream. I really had not felt that scared since I was very young, probably similar to that feeling you have as a child when you find yourself properly lost from your parents in a supermarket or shopping centre.

When I turned off the mountain range road, I reached down to my phone to pick it up and turn on my music now that I was back with reception. My heart sank. I hadn't picked up my phone and it was still up on the mountain. Leaving it there simply wasn't an option, as I couldn't afford losing it.

I turned my car around on the narrow road in a three-point turn and sped back up the mountain

Again I did not see a single soul for the entire drive up the mountain. With the sun already set over the mountains in front of me, the only natural light I would have to go get my phone with was whatever remained in this period of civil twilight. The feeling of dread slowly crept back into my body the further I drove up the winding road in the same way it had slowly drained as I drove down.

I pulled just into the gravel carpark so I could make a quick escape once I returned with my phone. My bare feet slapped down the stone stairs as I descended into total darkness, the only noises I heard were the sound of running water and the buzzing of mosquitos trying to molest me. I ran solely on my memory of the trail, down into the bottom concealed waterhole, where I found my phone still perched on the boulder I had left it on. 

As I moved my vision up and back towards what was visible of the trail, I caught something in my peripherals across the waterhole:

Two pale white hands with long and bony fingers and a wrinkled white forehead, long grey hair and manic eyes.

Peering from behind a rotting log resting between two mossy boulders.

Yep. Totally Fk this.

I'm not a great runner, but the extra adrenaline of this situation going from bad to nightmare fuel temporarily turned me into an Olympic sprinter. I can't remember whether or not I heard myself being followed, as the sound of the running waterfalls and my absolute unshakable focus in that period drowned any other noise out.

I threw open the door to my car, locked the doors, turned it on and threw it into drive. I looked left down the trail to the stairs one last time and saw two black silhouettes in whatever daylight remained. I sped down the road and a glance back into my rear view mirror revealed that the two figures had moved onto the road and were joined by another, all of which looked similar to the other.

Luckily for my safety, the adrenalin and terror of the moment still had me in a buzz and I was focused enough to not wreck myself racing down the mountain range at such a speed that I was back on the highway in fifteen minutes.

I'm not sure if the feeling of dread I had before I left the first time was my body sensing myself being watched or how long I was being watched for.

I can't tell you if the figures I saw were male or female or both, but I was not willing to stay there to figure it out.

I'm also not sure whether they were drug addicts, homeless or just psychotic to be up their acting so threatening at such an odd time. A lot of waterholes in Queensland such as these attract backpackers and other kind of strange types, some of which use the privacy of the location to try illicit substances, however this occasion seemed far more sinister.

I count myself extremely fortunate that the tyres to my car weren't slashed or something similar as I tried to leave either times.

This only happened recently and is by far the most scared for my life that I have ever been. I haven't been up to that waterhole since and do not intend on going their anytime in the near future.
