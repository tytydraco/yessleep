OK Soda always left a bad taste in my mouth—figuratively, that is. I was too young to remember it hitting the shelves, but its strange, counter-culture aesthetic intrigued me when I stumbled across an old can at a flea market. Gray, blocky, and covered in cryptic slogans, it radiated an aura of mystery that felt too calculated to be accidental. I bought it for $20 from a vendor who chuckled and said, "Careful—drinking that might make you disappear, too."

I thought it was just a joke.

The deeper I dug into OK Soda’s history, the stranger things became. It was designed to appeal to cynics, a self-aware marketing ploy meant to poke fun at advertising itself. A drink so nonchalant it bordered on nihilistic. Yet, for a product so steeped in irony, its disappearance was anything but amusing.

The lost marketing VHS intrigued me most. A ten-minute tape designed for Coca-Cola’s internal use, it was rumored to hold bizarre, disjointed footage in the same unsettling style as OK Soda’s commercials. A Reddit user, **Ok\_Tumbleweed\_7146**, claimed to have the only surviving copy. They promised to digitize and upload it for the world to see—but then they vanished.

No posts, no replies, no updates. Just silence.

I found an archived thread where they mentioned the VHS’s contents in vague terms: “It’s... unsettling. Something isn’t *right* about it. The visuals feel like they’re watching *you* instead of the other way around.” Another comment stuck with me: “The ending doesn’t make sense. It’s just static, but if you look closer, it’s not.”

Determined to uncover the truth, I tracked down their profile. It was eerily blank—no posts, no history, as if they’d never existed. But someone else had commented a cryptic phrase: “Things are going to be OK.”



After weeks of dead ends, I found a local estate sale listing a box of “miscellaneous Coca-Cola marketing materials.” I called immediately and drove three hours to the address. The house was decrepit, overgrown with weeds and ivy. Inside, a musty smell permeated the air, and the boxes stacked along the walls looked untouched for decades.

The tape was there.

Its label was faded but unmistakable: “OK SODA INTERNAL MARKETING MATERIALS – PROPERTY OF COCA-COLA, 1993.” My hands shook as I paid the seller and left, barely noticing their warning: “You don’t want to know what’s on it.”



I couldn’t wait to watch it. Back home, I dusted off an old VCR and hit play.

The footage was unlike anything I’d ever seen. It started with static that flickered into the OK Soda logo—a grinning face with hollow, piercing eyes. The narration was monotone yet unsettling, repeating lines from the OK Manifesto:

“OK Soda rejects anything that is not OK.”  
“Please wake up every morning knowing that things are going to be OK.”

The visuals grew stranger with each scene. Cartoonish animations gave way to grainy, surreal live-action shots of empty streets, faceless mannequins, and people staring blankly at the camera. There were subliminal flashes—images too quick to process, but they left a gnawing unease in my chest.

Then came the *coincidences*. A narrator listed bizarre urban legends tied to OK Soda, accompanied by uncanny visuals: a soda can sitting on an empty train track, a vending machine surrounded by police tape, and a shadowy figure lurking just out of frame.

“This is a coincidence,” the narrator intoned after each tale, the words lingering too long on screen, as if daring me to believe it.

The final segment was... wrong. It was just static, but it *moved*. Shapes writhed and twisted in the noise, forming outlines of faces, bodies, something alive. My TV crackled, and I swear I heard whispering—low, guttural voices that seemed to spill from behind me.

I unplugged the VCR, but the static didn’t stop. The screen stayed lit, and the whispering grew louder, coalescing into a single phrase:

“Drink it. Join us. Things are going to be OK.”

The screen went black.



I haven’t slept since. The whispers didn’t stop—they’re in my house now. My TV, my phone, even the hum of my refrigerator carries their message.

“Things are going to be OK.”

I tried reaching out to Coca-Cola, but my emails bounced back. Their offices had no record of the tape or the marketing campaign. No one I spoke to even remembered OK Soda existing. It’s like the whole thing was erased from history.

The final straw came last night. I woke up to find an unopened can of OK Soda on my nightstand. It wasn’t the flea market can—it was pristine, ice-cold, and dripping with condensation.

The whispers were deafening.

“Drink it.”

I don’t know how much longer I can resist. If you’re reading this, please—don’t look for the tape. Don’t dig into OK Soda’s past. Some things are better left forgotten.

Because once you start, you’ll hear it too.

And trust me, things are *not* going to be OK.
