The castle hovered somewhere ahead, not quite near, not quite distant—just suspended. The sky above was a sallow gray, drooping like a sigh that had forgotten why it was ever drawn in. His gaze dissolved into the vast pale ceiling, where two clouds wandered alone, their paths slow and reluctant, like they were dragging memories behind them. They moved without wind, without will. Only the idea of movement remained.

The gates had fallen flat against the ground, collapsed like thoughts too heavy to hold up. From them, figures in black robes spilled out—not walking, but appearing, all at once, like smoke given form. They drifted into the woods around the castle, their presence soft, almost mistaken for silence. Above, the sky hung still—no breath, no pulse—just a quiet choke, like time had stopped to weep but couldn’t remember the reason. Ravens circled low, pecking half-heartedly at the fleshless remnants of something once alive.

Shadows rippled over the clouds, hues of gray darker than grief. They felt sent—perhaps by a god, or the memory of one. Someone immense. Someone long gone. Someone who had given up.

By the lake—what used to be a lake—she paused. It twitched once, then reversed, water folding back into sky like a reel unwinding. She reached down, brushing the surface. But there was nothing. The lake had dried in the war, the last war, or the one before that. Still, she kept walking.

The corpses revealed themselves—shapes sunken into the earth, soaked in forgotten years. For a moment, she thought of robbing them. Her fingers met flesh, but it dissolved on contact. Beneath, a bone. Then, not even that—just a pale stone, cold in her palm. She turned to the trees, asking with her eyes what sin she had committed. No reply. When she exhaled, deeper this time, she realized: she hadn’t moved at all. She was still at the lake. She had never left.

"Maybe love will reach you one day."

The voice was distant, or maybe inside her, weary and translucent. It didn’t matter. She dismissed it, unsure whether it was from memory or something worse.

"Drink."

Wind crashed in, sudden and absolute. The lake swelled again, brimming like a lung filled too fast. She drank. It tasted of ink. Bitter, thick. She spat, startled—but it was only water. Or so she thought. When she opened her eyes, the lake was dry again. The liquid at her feet turned scarlet. Not ink. Blood. Hers.

Hands trembling, she reached for her dagger. The need was sharp, familiar. She wanted to end it. She almost did. Her eyes flicked open again.

"Don’t. Angels shouldn’t stain their wings."

—fall from grace—

The castle was still far. Maybe it had never moved. Maybe she hadn’t either. Still, she had to reach it. Maybe it meant something. Maybe it meant nothing at all. But she couldn’t stay. Not in this moment that refused to pass.

Her feet were bare. The ground clung to her—muddy, warm, unclean. Somehow, she found comfort in it. Then, a hedgehog appeared. Or tried to. She stepped forward and pain bloomed. No hedgehog. Just broken steel. The earth had turned on her. She walked anyway.

The gates weren’t far now.

Maybe she never was.

The birds began to see.

Slowly, as if awakening from centuries of silence, they gathered on the castle gates. Their songs grew harsher with every passing second, twisting from melody to something more like screaming—shrieks caught between metal and throat. It wasn’t beautiful anymore. It was collapse. The birds seemed to be choking on their own voices.

And then, they changed.

Owls now. But not the quiet, wise kind—these looked wrong. Elongated. Heavy with judgment. Their eyes, hollow and aching, didn’t just watch. They declared. They were omens stitched into feathers.

> "Now, show us... what hides behind the mask."


The voice was not quite spoken—it floated, brittle and echoing. A demand made by the wind, or by the owls, or by something older.

She finally reached the gates. She looked at the birds, but there was no fear. Only recognition.

She placed her hand against the cold steel. It softened beneath her palm. Metal turned to aged wood, grainy and warm. The castle had vanished. Before her stood a crooked old house.

She opened the door.

Inside: a small girl, weeping quietly in the corner. She didn’t speak to her. She didn’t need to. Behind the child, the bodies lay still. Fresh. Blood pooling into the splinters of the floorboards. The air was thick with it—death that hadn’t learned to settle.

She stepped over the threshold, and the wooden house melted behind her.

She was inside the castle again.

> "Welcome home, my beloved nephew."

The voice was velvet, lined with rot. Familiar in the way a dream can be.

> "Aunt... you haven’t aged at all. Do you still... eat them?"

> "Only the special ones are delivered here," she cooed. "You, darling? I wouldn’t dare touch you. You're far too beautiful."

> "You say that... but you’re already looking at me like you’ve chosen where to bite."

> "Oh, don’t be so dramatic. Just one taste. I must stay young."


Then the knife was inside her.

The pain followed instantly, a soft gasp turning to a silent scream. A piece of her belly slipped to the floor like it no longer belonged to her. Her aunt crouched like an animal—no grace, no shame—and began to chew, face smeared in red. Not hungrily, but as if it were necessary. As if youth itself required sacrifice.

> "Hey—are you okay? You’re bleeding."

The voice snapped her back.

Her eyes opened. Dizziness peeled away like old wallpaper. She was standing upright, alone. The dagger was in her stomach—really there. She hadn’t noticed. Until now.

She gritted her teeth, found some fading piece of will, and pulled it out. A delicate, broken cry escaped her lips.

> "You’re not from here, are you?"

She didn’t answer.

She just kept walking forward. Past the pain. Past the stranger. Her mind still trapped behind some locked, burning door she no longer knew how to open.

> "Hahaha... this flesh is to die for!"

> "Truly. Keeps you young and full of breath."

> "The Apostles were feasting well all this time."

The tavern breathed like an old lung, damp and wheezing. She stepped inside, unnoticed, her presence absorbed by the shadows. No one looked up. As if she wasn’t there at all.

She drifted to the farthest corner—where the candlelight barely reached. The table was half-rotted, swollen from dried blood. The chair groaned beneath her like it remembered pain.

The bartender didn’t look up. He leaned against the bar like a man bored of existence. His greasy black hair hung limp around the long fox ears curled backward like wilted petals. His shirt was torn—half-eaten, like something had taken a bite from him and he never bothered to mend it.

He was busy carving at his fingernails—no, removing them. Entire nails, one by one, flicked into the air. A few landed in the drinks of the old men laughing in the back. They didn’t notice. Or didn’t care. They looked half-mad, wearing smiles too wide for their faces.

The light inside the tavern flickered like memory—dim lanterns swaying from rusted chains, barely holding back the dark. Shadows whispered behind them, as if they were waiting their turn.

Another man approached her table. He had fox ears too, but no eyes—just smooth, pale skin where sight should be. He placed a glass in front of her without a word, his hand shaking slightly as he set it down. Then he turned and vanished into the haze, like a thought she forgot mid-sentence.

She stared at the glass. It shimmered faintly in the candlelight, a colorless liquid inside—or maybe no liquid at all. Her hand hovered near it, hesitant. Detached.

All around her, the world moved wrong.

Dice clattered beside her. Laughter rose, sharp and brittle. Then—a sudden thud. One of the men collapsed forward, his face still twisted in amusement. No scream. No shock. The bartender walked over slowly, grabbed the corpse by the collar, and dragged it across the floor—leaving a streak like spilled ink. He tossed it into the river just outside the window.

A few minutes later, smoke began curling up from the grill near the tavern’s back wall.

She didn’t flinch. She was too thirsty.

The glass still appeared full—still, clear, empty. She brought it to her lips and took the smallest sip.

It tasted like nothing. Like absence.

She lowered the glass and found it empty. Had it always been?

Her gaze drifted toward the window. Outside, the sky was bruising—dusk bleeding into night. An owl landed on the ledge, inches from her. Their eyes met.

The owl looked exhausted.

Like her.

Then, without warning, a larger owl descended—slow and silent—and devoured the smaller one whole. A single gulp, like erasing a sentence. The girl recoiled slightly, her stomach tightening. She looked toward the tree nearby. The little owl had always sat there. Every time.

She blinked.

> "You should try this," the bartender said, setting a plate in front of her.

> "I don’t eat fingers," she replied, voice dry.

He tilted his head, ears twitching slightly. His hands rested on the edge of the table, long fingers tapping slowly.

> "But you don’t look old. Are you lying?"

> "I’m still human."

He grinned, exposing yellowing teeth.

> "They all say that. Then they feast on other people’s dreams."

He left the plate behind. It twitched once. Then went still.

Outside, the sky collapsed into dusk. The tavern dimmed. She stood slowly, legs stiff like they had forgotten how to move. Her eyes lingered on the window once more, then turned away.

It was time to go.

> “Go back. If you don’t... they’ll erase you from this world.”

> “It’s too dark—I can’t see his face. I think he’s smiling.”

> “She wouldn’t drink. Not at first. They made her. Should’ve buried her with the others. God isn’t watching anymore.”

The trees moved like something breathing through its ribs. Windless, but swaying. The night folded over itself—folded again. She was walking, maybe. Or standing still. Even the sound of her steps felt borrowed.

A tremble underfoot. Not loud. More like a memory of an earthquake.

The moss peeled back. Roots curled in. The forest shivered in a way no forest should.

> “A fallen…” came the whisper, drawn-out and hollow. “Let’s see if your flesh remembers being sacred.”

She looked toward the voice, but the trees melted sideways, making space for something long and wet and wrong. A serpent, but not quite. Its scales reflected things she hadn’t lived. Its eyes were wide with things she didn’t want to remember. It circled her—but not around her body. It circled around her mind.

> “The forest is not your friend. Apostles fed us before they rotted. We swallowed dreams whole.”

She raised a hand—instinct or prayer, it wasn’t clear. A soft light gathered in her palm. Not sunlight. Not fire. Something colder, like the afterimage of hope.

> “I deny your existence,” she said, though her voice came from somewhere behind her.

> “You don’t get to deny what you dreamed,” the snake said. Or maybe it didn’t. Maybe that voice was hers, coming from the snake’s throat.

The white glow pulsed once.

Around her, the snakes revealed themselves—tall as trees, thin as memory, writhing in silent judgment. But were they ever really hidden? Or had she just refused to see them?

One lunged.

She didn’t flinch. She couldn’t.

Its face met her palm—and shattered. But the shattering made no sound. Just a ripple of glass breaking somewhere underwater.

Bone fell. Or rain.

The others hissed—but it sounded like sobbing now. Or laughter.

They pulled away, dissolving into the tree trunks, slinking back into whatever they had been before shapes were named.

Her hand was empty. Had it glowed? She couldn’t tell anymore. It felt cold. It felt burned. It felt like it had never been hers.

And now, just ahead, the forest ended. A river waited—black and slow, mirroring nothing.

She walked the winding road, her feet silent on the ground. A small serpent slithered by her ankle, flicked its tongue, and kept going. It left no mark in the dirt. When she looked back, there were no tracks.

She watched the village across the water. The lights in the inn flickered warmly, like candles remembering who they used to be. Smoke curled from its crooked chimney. It looked safe.

But she had learned by now—so often, safety only dressed itself in old familiar skins.

The inn’s door creaked open without anyone touching it.

> “One night as always, Sylvae?”

She didn’t answer. Her mouth felt stitched shut.

The voice had called her name like it owned it.

--

At last, faint shades of light broke through the grey expanse of cloud above. They weren’t strong—just gentle traces of warmth—but they cast soft reflections across her face, flickering like memories too distant to reach.

And then—

“Heh… it feels good,” Sylvae murmured. Her voice was quiet, almost unsure. “I’ve been here all along, haven’t I? Trapped in something that feels like endless pain… but it’s okay. I’ll make it through. I have to.”

“It’s always been your fault,” a voice whispered from nowhere. “You should never have been born into this world.”

“I know,” she said, without anger. “But I’ve been walking this path for so long now. I know I haven’t done everything right. I know I left Him behind… but I didn’t mean to. I just… I wanted to be like her. Like my mother—before she took her last breath.”

“So you’re lost,” the voice replied. “Adrift.”

“No. Not lost,” she whispered. “Just… hollow. I haven’t felt anything in a long time. And maybe I never will again. But it’s too late for tears now. Too late for memories. I have to stop them—the ones who destroyed everything she cared about.”

“You’re weak,” the voice said coldly. “Your mind is splintered. What do you have? A dagger and a dream? What good will that do you?”

Sylvae looked down at her hands. They were trembling, but not from fear.

“It’s not about what I hold,” she said. “It’s about what I choose. What I carry. What I still believe in. That’s why I have to continue what she started. That’s why I can’t give up. She loved me more than the world ever could. And the world took her away.”

She stepped into the lake. The water was cold, still, quiet. It embraced her feet like glass remembering rain.

“I don’t need to cry anymore,” she said softly. “I’ve rejected that part of me. That’s not what she would’ve wanted.”

“You’re living inside an illusion,” the voice said. “The world doesn’t change. The past is the past, and it always will be.”

“Maybe,” Sylvae replied, “but I don’t need the world to change. I only need to move forward. Even if my mind breaks… even if the illusions kill me… I’ll keep going. I’ll stand again.”
