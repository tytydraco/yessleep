There was this girl named Mandy that I went to school with. She was in my class every year from second grade up until 8th. I didn't know a whole lot about her, other than she walked to school everyday wearing a green backpack that turned brown and ratty as the years went by. I've never seen her parents and I never saw where she lived. She had thin, lifeless dark hair and wore glasses. Her skin was pale, almost pallid looking. Her arms were thin and bony. She had a peculiar smell about her. Her clothes emitted a stale, musty odor. It wasn't rancid but was rather off putting, like moldy, rotting wood.

Needless to say, Mandy wasn't very social. At recess she'd go off on her own and circle around the playground, like she was in her own little world. The most odd thing about Mandy, was that she often talked to herself. I could see her mumbling to herself as she trudged along in the grass. Her black hair lying limply on her bony shoulders. Her oversized sweater hanging down past her hips. Her tiny arms drowning in her baggy sleeves.

Mandy wasn't treated very nicely either. If you were seen sitting by her, the other kids would take notice and mock you for it. Her smell didn't help her social life much either. In the spring of 8th grade, it was a particularly lonely time in my life as my best friend had moved away. Things got fairly lonely. The first time I talked to Mandy was around this time.

It was an unseasonably warm fall day, and I came across Mandy walking home from school. She was further ahead of me, so I quickened my pace to catch up to her. As I approached, I noticed she was acting a bit odd. She was occasionally looking to her right and gesturing with her hands. As I came closer, I saw her lips moving, as if she were speaking to someone. When I finally caught up to her I immediately asked who she was talking to. She completely stopped what she was doing and paused before she responded

"Oh...You saw that huh?" I nodded yes. "Sometimes....Well sometimes my friend keeps me company on my walks."

I inquired about her friend, which I found peculiar. Why would an 8th grader have an imaginary friend? She told me her friend was shy, and she wanted me to keep him a secret. That he only reveals himself to her. She then leaned over and whispered in my ear

"Don't say anything but... he's walking right behind us."

A strange sensation came over me, and a chill went through my body. It was no less than 65 degrees out, but suddenly I felt icy all over. I glanced back over my shoulder just to make sure no one was there.

"I told you" Her voice had a hint of irritation "He won't show himself to you without my permission."

The rest of the walk was fairly silent, Mandy would occasionally look over her shoulder, which made me very uneasy. I knew logically that no one was there, but Mandy was so obsessed with this imaginary...entity, it made me question my own sanity. I mean, this girl is nuts, right? She made up this person in her head and fully believes he just follows her around. I muttered a goodbye as I turned right to head up my street.

As I headed farther up the road, I had this strange feeling. I felt like I was being told to turn around. I tried to fight it but the urge became overpowering. I cautiously turned my head and saw something standing there motionless at the end of he street near the stop sign, staring at me. I blinked a few times and it was gone. "Mandy?" I uttered. Surprised at my reaction, it didn't look like Mandy...Why did I think it was her? It didn't even look human.

I tried to avoid Mandy after that unsettling incident, but unfortunately I kept bumping into her. She began to take a liking to me, as she would wait up for me after school. Her "friend" would sometimes join us, and Mandy became more comfortable interacting with "him" around me. He however, was apparently still quite shy.

I tried to probe Mandy with questions about her life, but she didn't say much. I asked her about her parents and she told me her father is a prosecutor. She said she didn't know much about her mother as she died in childbirth. She doesn't have siblings but enjoys the company of her rat "Asmodeus." I stopped asking too many questions. Learning about Mandy's life was like entering a dark, strange, unfamiliar place. It just felt cold and unsettling.

One afternoon, on one of our awkward after school walks, I noticed Mandy looked very...angry. I could almost palpate her fury. After walking a while, I finally asked what was wrong. She let out a huff before she exploded. "Him!" she barked. "Ask him!"

"Uh, who?" I asked startled, but tried to act as casually as possible trying to avoid her turning her wrath toward me. A very angry, impatient Mandy responded

"Jake!" "That's his name! Jake!" "The imbecile, the moron who follows me around everyday like a lost dog!"

I was speechless. A strange noise escaped my mouth instead of words, I was trying to say something, anything to calm her down, but I failed. I looked over at Mandy and her face, it looked... different. She had deep frown lines, and the crows feet of a much older woman, and her mouth, that scowl, it was so hateful. In that moment it just seemed so...evil. Her eyes even looked different. Her pupils looked so dark, the whites of her eyes tinged an unhealthy grey.

Moments later I felt a slight pinch on the fleshy part of my arm. It wasn't painful, but I nearly jumped out of my skin.

"What was that?" I shrieked as I turned around, pulling my arms up around myself. I looked again at Mandy's distorted face, a chill went down my spine.

"Jake, what did I tell you? You are not to interact with *anyone* else." She hissed through gritted teeth. Her voice gravelly and deep. "Now I have to punish you!"

"Jake isn't real Mandy. He doesn't exist. This needs to stop!" I pleaded.

"Oh Jake...See? They *still* don't believe you're real." She said, in a mocking voice. "I'm all you've got in this whole existence dear Jake...whatever pathetic existence I allow you to have"

"That's it, I have to get away from you Mandy...we can't walk together anymore, you're messing with my head."

She let out a small laugh as she relaxed her horrid looking features.

"Ok, well...Bye bye for now." Mandy replied. A devious smile appearing across her twisted  face.

"No Mandy" I shot back. "This is the final goodbye, this side of you, it's scaring me...I don't want to be anywhere near you or your *friend*."

I rushed ahead as if I were fleeing a building about to collapse. I tried so hard not look back, but that sensation came over me again. Something was demanding that I turn around. It became almost painful not to. Suddenly I stopped. I held out my hands in front of me...they were shaking. I balled my hands up into tight fists. "No" I told myself, "Do not turn around." I knew if I turned my head, something awful would be there.

As I quickened my pace I heard something that shook me to my core. It was a scream. There was torment in the voice, a pleading. It sounded like "Help me!." The voice sounded male, which was odd because the only other person I saw was Mandy walking on that street.

I froze for a moment but then continued on running. My heart was pounding as I raced forward, feet pounding against the pavement. What if this was a trick... or what if it wasn't? Whatever the poor soul crying out needed, I didn't have. Whatever Mandy was, she was not just a strange school girl who smelled bad and had an imaginary friend. She was...Something else. Something entirely different.

I fumbled with my keys a bit as my hands were still shaking. I unlocked the front door to my house and leapt inside, slamming the door shut behind me and quickly locking it. With my back to the door, all I heard was my loud breathing. I stood there huffing and puffing, as I collected my thoughts. I stood there on high alert, frozen, afraid that if I moved, she would somehow hear me and find me. If only I had the comfort of knowing that would be the last time i'd ever see Mandy.

The next few days I hid out at home, terrified to go outside. I told my mom I didn't feel well and she let me stay home from school. I drew my curtains shut and barricaded myself in my room. I wasn't from a particularly religious home, but I had my grandmas crucifix nearby. I needed protection, and spiritual protection felt comforting to have. When I retuned to school, Mandy was gone. Her name was barely mentioned by anyone. It was as if she never even existed.

As for Jake,  I don't know if he was imaginary. I don't know if Mandy was playing tricks, or if she brought him to life in her own mind. Could he be a tormented spirit? Was Mandy evil, and using trickery to make him seem real? Or there's the possibly that my own mind was playing tricks on me. Maybe Mandy was just peculiar and had a very nasty side to her that spooked me into believing maybe he was real. Who knows.

Many years have passed and I still don't know what happened to Mandy. No one from school seems to know either, and no one seems to care. I truly don't want to know. Where ever she is, hopefully she is somewhere very far away, like deep down in the core of the earth where she belongs.
