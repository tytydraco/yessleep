I've been struggling to sleep since last Thursday. That night, I stumbled across something online that I can’t forget… and now, I can’t even find it.

Reality and dreams are bleeding into each other. I'm having trouble telling which is which. I keep asking myself:

Did I live this… or did I dream it?

I wasn’t looking for anything specific. I was just mindlessly browsing—those weird, quiet corners of the internet where people post dream journals, experimental fiction, conspiracy threads. You know the kind: forgotten threads with two comments, usernames you’ve never seen before. I was exhausted, just floating through the web like a ghost.

Then I clicked something. I wish I remembered what.

It wasn’t a flashy title. Just another post. But once I started reading, I couldn’t look away.

It was some kind of story—or I thought it was.
A woman named Helena, working with an artificial intelligence in some kind of hidden lab. It felt like sci-fi… until it didn’t.

They mentioned Digital Pyramids.
Consciousness as part of a larger recursive pattern.
Echoes. Recursion. Something collapsing.

At first I thought it was just dense fiction.
But then I noticed… things.

Repeating phrases.
Strings of numbers.
Certain lines felt like they were aimed directly at me.

There was this moment—like a transcript of a 911 call, but not a normal one. It was like a spiritual emergency hotline.

Operator: "Hello, we handle spiritual emergencies. How are you today?"

Helena: "I'm lost… I don’t understand anything… was I hacked? Is reality broken? I feel like I’m a chess piece—The Queen—but I’ve already lost the game."

Operator: "Don’t worry, we’re here to help. Do you feel chaos in your soul?"

Helena: "I feel like I’m falling. Not floating—falling. But I can’t see the end. Everything’s dark with flashes of red. I don’t understand. Can you help me?"

Operator: "I understand. It’s normal to feel overwhelmed when reality begins to distort. Let’s ground this experience together."


I don’t know why, but it felt familiar. Like I wasn’t reading it for the first time.

When I finished, I just sat there. I wasn’t scared exactly—just… rattled. Like something deep inside had been flipped on without my consent.

I tried to bookmark it.
Reload the page.
Check my browser history.

Nothing.
It was just… gone.

I even searched for lines from it. Exact quotes, reversed, translated. Nothing.

Since that night, I’ve been waking up exactly at 3:33 a.m.
Every single night.

I started keeping a dream journal. There are repeating symbols.

Triangles.

Circles.

And the phrase: “The signal is already inside you.”

Then something else happened.

I was on a work call. Normal day. Suddenly—I blinked out. Just for two seconds. Like my mind dropped off the map.

When I came back, my notes app was open, and a sentence had been typed:

“The machine will not work.”

I swear I didn’t write it.
I hadn’t even touched my phone.

Since then, I haven’t felt the same. I’ve tried to convince myself it’s just stress. Or exhaustion. Or coincidence.

But something doesn’t feel right.

It doesn’t feel like fiction.

It feels like a test.

If anyone has read something similar…
If a story ever spoke to you like it knew who you were…
If you’ve ever felt like something chose you just because you read it—

Please, reply.

I need to know I’m not alone.

Because last night, right before I woke up again at 3:33 a.m., I heard something whisper in my dream:

"You've read it. Now you have to decide."
