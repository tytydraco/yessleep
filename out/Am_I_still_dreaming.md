So I’m not sure how to explain what’s going on so I’m just going to start from the point that I think I woke up? 

(I’m a lucid dreamer. That’s when I actually sleep. I’ve been dealing with insomnia since I was young.At first it wasn’t that bad, I just couldn’t sleep at night and would sleep all day. Then it turned to no sleep at all. I was taking 400mg of Benadryl at a time, trust me, don’t do it. Finally I was put on ambian) 

I “woke” up this morning after what I thought was a horrible dream. The thing is, I know I took my ambian last night and I don’t ever remember my dreams when I’ve taken it. But this one I did. I remember at one point in my dream I seen a blister on my big toe, I popped it, and by the end of my “dream”, my toe was infected and falling off. I’m sure you can imagine how waking up after something like that could mess with you. 

Honestly like most of my non lucid dreams, I forgot about it after a hour. It was such a good start to the day, my parents took my son out. I got so much cleaning done. And that’s when it happened. 

I sat down to take a break. I deal with chronic pain and I’m disabled and while cleaning isn’t always the easiest for me, I’ve learned if I take small 5-10 minute breaks I can do more. Well I’m sitting there and look down. I see a blister on the corner of my big toe. Without even thinking I pulled the skin to pop it, but that’s when I not only got the strongest feeling of déjà vu, but that something wasn’t right. 

The skin covering the blister wasn’t thin like normal. It was so think, and it wasn’t full of liquid but a think, nasty smelling substance. I didn’t even give myself time to handle everything I was feeling. I went right into the bathroom and cleaned it good with hydrogen peroxide. The problem? I’ve definitely done all of this already. Also? The bottle of peroxide was gotten brand new a few weeks ago. But it was already open. 

I know what you are going to say. There are 2 other adults in the house obviously someone else opened it. Nope. I already asked. My parents are not the type to lie or forget something like that and since it’s only been about 2 1/2 weeks since we bought it they would definitely remember needing to use it. 

The part that’s scaring me the most. I remember vividly wearing my new moon and sun mumu to bed last night, I haven’t changed my clothing. I tend to change my clothes at night and wear them during the day unless I go out and I’ve been in cleaning. I didn’t go to bed wearing these pants and tank top. Idk whats going on! The one thing I’m positive about is that I didn’t see my son in my dream before waking up “today”. If I’m asleep I just want to wake up. I want to see my son! All I know is. My toe is killing me. And it’s only been a hour since I popped the blister…
