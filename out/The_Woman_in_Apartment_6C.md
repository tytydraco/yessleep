I moved into the building a month ago. It’s not much a dingy, four-story block in a forgotten corner of the city, just cheap enough to afford without giving up heat or water. The kind of place where the walls have seen too much, and the carpets have given up on redemption.

There’s something off about it, though. Not in an obvious, “the walls bleed at night” kind of way. More like the elevator never stops at the second floor, and the landlord refuses to answer why. More like the way neighbours shuffle out of their doors and then *freeze* if they see someone coming up from the floor below.

And then there’s 6C.

At the end of the sixth-floor corridor, past the flickering light that no one bothers fixing, there’s a door that looks the same as the others, except it *isn’t*. No one has ever seen the tenant. Not once. I asked the postman. I asked the building manager. Hell, I even tried to ask one of the old ladies who lives in 6A. She just shook her head, muttered *"you don't talk about her,"* and closed the door before I could press further.

Of course, I couldn't leave it alone. Curiosity’s a disease, isn’t it?

One night, maybe two weeks in, I was coming back from work late, past midnight. As I reached the top of the stairs (the lift had decided to do its usual trick of not existing), I saw her door was *open*. Just a crack.

There was no light inside, but I swear I could feel something watching me from the gap. My skin prickled. The hallway went *quiet*. Even the humming bulb stopped its buzzing like it knew something was wrong.

I paused, maybe for too long, then took a step.

A whisper floated out.

*"Help me."*

It was so soft I thought I imagined it. Then again:

*"Please… help me…"*

So I did what any rational adult would do. I panicked and bolted to my apartment like a six-year-old who just turned off the basement light.

The next morning, I figured I dreamt it. Until I found a single photograph outside my door.

It was faded, crumpled at the edges, and looked like it’d been taken decades ago. A family, smiling stiffly at the camera. Mother, father, son. And in the upstairs window of the house behind them — a face.

Not just any face. *Her* face. Pale, wide-eyed, the kind of expression you’d find on someone watching you sleep through your own keyhole.

I tried asking the landlord again. He went pale and told me, *"If you hear her again, do not speak back. Whatever you do. Don’t answer her."*

I should’ve moved. I wanted to move.

But two nights ago, it happened again.

Her door was wide open this time. No whisper. Just silence. And that smell -- damp wood, mould, and something metallic underneath.

I couldn’t stop myself. I stepped forward. I looked inside.

The walls were covered in hundreds of photos -- all of them the same. That same family, that same window, that same face.

In the middle of the room stood a single chair.

Facing the wall.

And in it… was *me*.

Not like a mirror. Not a reflection. It was me, hunched in that chair, eyes glassy, mouth open in a silent scream, wearing the same hoodie I had on *that night*.

I ran.

I don’t remember getting back to my flat, locking the door, pushing the fridge against it like that would help.

I haven’t slept since.

She knocks on my door at exactly 3:06 a.m. every night now.

Not loud.

Just once.

**Knock.**

And then she whispers:

*"Help me."*

Last night, I made a mistake.

I whispered back:

*"What do you want?"*

The lights in my flat flickered. The walls creaked. And the fridge… moved an inch.

She’s closer now. I don’t know how I know, but I *feel* it.

If you don’t hear from me again, don’t come looking.

And whatever you do…

Don’t open the door.
