Despite the hotel only being run by Mrs. Coriz and me, we had a pretty good thing going. 132 rooms, 133 spirit tenants (the twins shared a room). Contrary to popular belief, spirits aren't the dead, but creatures born from humanity’s pain and suffering (which there is no shortage of). They feed off of fear, and they’re fed on by vipirits, which are creatures born from humanity's hate and cruelty (which there is also no shortage of).

Mrs. Coritz’s family has provided spirits with sanctuary for generations, having the innate ability to create protection barriers and banish vipirits. The spirits wanted to give back, and hence the Eidolon hotel was built. Each spirit gets a room, and they're free to scare the guests who book specifically to get their thrills. It's a perfect scenario and everyone is happy.

Unfortunately, Mrs. Coriz is the last of her generation, so she adopted me and we're both working hard to get me to a level where I can protect the spirits as well as she can. We even have a secluded place in the middle of the forest where I can practice making barriers.

It was going well for a while, excluding a few situations, but then Mrs. Coriz got her diagnosis. She was scheduled to undergo a dangerous surgery, and that was when everything changed.

Mrs. Coriz never panicked, but I could see the worry in her eyes. I was worried too. I didn't want to lose my adoptive mother who taught me so much, and I definitely didn't want to run the hotel on my own. I wasn't ready. As a last-ditch effort, I suggested she take a DNA test to see if she had any distant relatives who might have her innate ability. So she did.

And she had.

Howard. 

He was a distant cousin, and she invited him over to the hotel right away. We explained everything, and he took the news as well as I did, in that he was excited and eager. He'd recently lost his job as an investment manager and this was the break he needed.

Mrs. Coriz spent the evening teaching him how to create barriers, and he picked up on it within seconds. I was relieved we finally had someone proficient to help me, but I couldn't help but feel a little envious. He'd asked her about every detail and learned advanced rituals I didn't even know existed.

My envy began to grow over the next few days, especially now that he was bossing me around. He may be older and blood-related to Mrs. Coriz, but I had more experience running this hotel. I also treated the spirits like the tenants they were, while he treated them like a commodity. Mrs. Coriz didn't seem to notice, though, her attention focused on her health.

A week later, Mrs. Coriz put Howard in charge while she stayed home and prepared for her surgery. That day, I came in for my 7pm shift and was stunned to see a small greenhouse being built behind the hotel. It was pretty much complete, and Howard was inspecting the work.

“What's that for?” I asked, walking over.

He didn't bother facing me. “Each room only has a small window. I thought the spirits might like an area where they can get sun and see the outside world in a safe environment.”

“Oh,” I said in surprise. “That's thoughtful of you. How much did this cost?” 

“Cost is secondary to the benefit.” Now he turned to me, frowning in disapproval. “What are you doing here? Go inside and check people in.”

I scowled at him but made my way to the front desk. He hadn't even been here two weeks and he was already acting like he owned the place. I sighed, realizing technically he would own the place after Mrs. Coriz passed on. The Coriz’s only wanted family to own the hotel, and I guess blood trumped adoption.

It was midnight by the time I finished checking in the guests, and I placed the *"Be back soon! If it's urgent, call the number below!"* sign on the desk before I went about my rounds. On my way back, I noticed a guest sitting on the lobby armchair.

“Hello! How may I help you?” I said, jogging over.

The old man stood up. “I’m in room 28. I always book that room, but today the ghost isn't there.”

“Oh,” I said, trying to hide my concern. “Don't worry, sometimes the spirits shift their haunting schedule. Please return to your room and I'll personally inquire about the delay.”

“Thank you. And please make sure it's the same ghost. I do enjoy my time with her.”

“Of course! She always looks forward to your visit and would never miss a chance to welcome you! I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Do you need assistance up the stairs?”

He tapped his cane on the floor and smiled. “No, thank you.”

Once he was out of view, I frowned. Wd. Luleelei was the spirit in room 28, and she was the sweetest one. The elderly and those who wanted a gentle thrill usually booked her room, and she loved every minute of it despite not getting her fill of fear.

The first step was to call her. I pressed the button that made a small light glow in her room. This indicated that I wanted to speak to her, but she didn't come down. Worried, I called each of the other spirits. They all came down. None had seen her since check-in. 

Now my worry was veering towards panic. I'd never lost a spirit before. Before I swallowed my pride and called Howard for help, I remembered the greenhouse he'd set up. Perhaps Wd. Luleelei decided to try it out and lost track of time.

Grabbing my banishing weapons (an engraved stick and a hollow orb), I walked outside and made my way to the back, the midnight moon hiding behind the clouds. It was dark and chilly, and I wished Howard had built a way to get to the greenhouse from inside the hotel. The glass hut came into view, and I stopped in my tracks, fear petrifying every atom in my body.

Vipirits.

A dozen of them.

Hovering around the greenhouse.

And inside, I could see Wd. Luleelei, her flickering silver whizzing around in a frenzy.

Responsibility overtook my terror and I pulled out my weapons and ran over, acting on autopilot as I held one up in each hand and began chanting. The vipirits froze, their hazy white color stuttering as I worked on banishing them. I'd never done so many at once, and sweat trickled down my face as I concentrated all my essence into the ritual. I was almost successful …

… until a shot rang out.

I screamed and jumped back as the bullet pulverized the hollow orb, showering me with fragments. The vipirits hissed and charged at me, and I screamed again as I turned to run, only to crash right into Howard. 

“Howard! Help! They—”

I lost my words when I saw the gun in his hand. Aimed at me. He raised his other hand, and the vipirits backed off and returned to hovering around the greenhouse.

“Howard? Wh-What’s going on?” I asked, putting my hands up.

“I'm taking the business in a new direction.”

I frowned. “What?”

“I've found a way to make more money with these creatures.”

“H-How?”

“By making a deal with vipirits.”

My mouth fell open in incredulity. “What?”

“It is the next logical progression.” He lowered the gun. “Come, let me show you.”

I flinched as he draped an arm around my shoulders, and I stumbled beside him as he walked me towards the greenhouse. Towards the horde of vipirits. My two previous interactions with them had almost resulted in my death, and my pulse raced faster the closer we got.

“I call this edifice the Dining Room,” Howard said, gesturing towards the greenhouse.

My confusion morphed to horror when I noticed that Wd. Luleelei wasn't alone in there. A vipirit was with her, chasing her around while the vipirits outside cheered.

“No!” I cried out as I ran over, banging my fists on the glass. “Howard, let her out!”

“No, that vipirit paid for its meal.”

I turned to him in disbelief. “What?”

“My new business model is to auction off spirits. The vipirit who pays the most will win their meal.”

“Pay you with what? They don't have money!”

“They find it.”

“Your new idea is to profit off murder and theft?” I yelled, my desperate anger overflowing.

“It's not murder, spirits aren't alive. And it's not theft if no one realizes the money is missing.” 

“They *are* alive! They eat and feel and have personalities!” I slammed my fists against the glass again. “Let her out now and return the vipirit its money!”

“No.” He pulled out his phone. “This single spirit brought in as much as this hotel made last month.”

“I don't care! This isn't what The Eidolon Hotel is about! Mrs. Coriz won't approve of this!”

“I know, I wasn't expecting either of you to be on board.” He knocked on the glass. “This demonstration was to prove to the vipirits that I keep my word. I'm offering them the first vipirit restaurant, if you will, and now they know to flock to me for a convenient meal.”

He turned towards the hotel. “Tonight, I'm transporting all the spirits to a different facility. Of course, I'll continue advertising it as a sanctuary to attract spirits. The renowned Coriz name will help me greatly in setting this trap.”

I shoved him. “You're a monster! How can you do this? They trust you! Mrs. Coriz trusts you! You're betraying them!”

“Why are we protecting spirits and denying vipirits their sole source of sustenance?” he asked, crossing his arms. “Vipirits didn't choose to eat spirits, that’s just how they are. They’ve been shunned for generations, now I'm giving them a chance and they're grateful.”

“But you're killing spirits!”

“As I said before, they aren't alive. And what good is keeping them around?”

“They keep the hotel running! They have fans! They’re loved!” I gestured to the vipirits above. “What good is keeping *them*?”

“Easy money with no stress.” He placed a hand on my shoulder. “Running a hotel is not my strong suit, especially the hassle of dealing with guests. If you want this hotel to end on a good note, accept that my plan is the only way forward and I'll let you take charge of the hotel's refunds and cessation.”

“No way I'm agreeing!” I yelled, pushing his arm away. “Let Wd. Luleelei out now!”

“Do you really want to see the Coriz reputation ruined by the sudden closure of this hotel?”

I gasped as he whipped his hand forward and snapped something around my wrist. Handcuffs. Before I could register what he'd just done, he snapped the other cuff around a railing encircling the greenhouse.

“I'll give you time to think it over,” he said, frisking me and confiscating my phone. “I'll take over your shift for now.”

“No, wait!” I cried out as he walked away. “Howard, please let Wd. Luleelei go! We can talk about this but let her go first!”

He didn't even glance back as he walked out of view, and fear eclipsed my anger as I looked inside the greenhouse. Wd. Luleelei was still zipping around, bouncing off the walls in a frenzied panic, and the vipirit was right at her heels. Or tail, I should say, as she'd chosen to look like a mix between Swamp Thing and a mermaid.

“Wd. Luleelei, hang in there!” I said, straining to free my hand.

“I don't want to die!” she screamed.

“I know! I'll try my best to save you!”

Howard had obviously set up a barrier around the greenhouse that blocked both vipirits and spirits. I hadn't learned that chant yet, or its reverse, and I cursed my slow learning curve. That chant didn't need props and I could've saved Wd. Luleelei instantly. Her only hope now were the spare banishing weapons I had in my car. I just needed to free myself and get them before the vipirits figured out my plan and attacked me.

I glanced up, gulping at the white, wriggling clumps above me. Howard knew my limits, which is why he had no qualms leaving me here. But he didn't keep me alive because he cared about me. He only cared about the Coriz reputation. If the hotel abruptly shut down due to mysterious reasons, spirits would become suspicious and avoid the Coriz name. Avoid him and his new deceitful business. He needed me to smoothen things out.

A new wave of fear spread beneath my skin.  What about Mrs. Coriz? How was he going to stop her from stopping him? I had a feeling she'd track him down to the ends of the Earth once she found out what he did. Unless she didn't survive her surgery. Maybe he was counting on that. 

The vipirit chasing Wd. Luleelei was flailing its vines with ravenous frustration, and my restless heart slammed against my chest as it let out a piercing screech. It was getting angry, and that wasn't good. I looked down at my bleeding wrist. Nothing I'd done had gotten me any closer to escaping. 

Desperate tears blurred my vision as I twisted and jerked, the clanging cuffs clashing with my growling breaths. Every few seconds, I'd look inside, following the pursuit with fretful eyes and praying that Wd. Luleelei’s luck continued as she dodged her predator.

After half an hour, I collapsed onto my knees, crying, weak with emotion and effort, rivulets of blood trickling down my arm. The vipirit seemed weak too, its white nearly transparent. The vipirits on the outside were screeching in anger, and I cringed as I looked up, hoping Howard's decision to leave me here wasn't a mistake.

The screeching transformed into a cacophony of shrill shrieks, and I covered my ears as I looked back inside the greenhouse with dread. I was expecting to see Wd. Luleelei dead … not the vipirit.

I gawked at its limp vines splayed on the floor, the white of its body barely visible. Wd. Luleelei was gawking too, her silver still flickering with fear, but brighter than I'd ever seen her. The vipirit had lost all its energy. It probably hadn't eaten in weeks. But Wd. Luleelei looked like she'd just scared an entire stadium of serenephobics. 

The vipirits above me began zooming all around the greenhouse, and I cowered against the glass, trembling as they shrieked like banshees. I had no doubt they were going to kill me now. One of their own just died after paying a human a fortune for a presumably convenient meal, and they wanted revenge.

Wd. Luleelei sat beside me on the other side, distress etched on her scaly face. She put a webbed hand against the glass, and I placed mine over it as I locked eyes with her, both of us sharing our fear. Fear for ourselves and for each other.

A crash made me yelp, and I whipped my head around, my heart running amok. A vipirit had lifted Howard's truck and slammed it back into the ground. The other vipirits seemed to take inspiration from that as they began demolishing the vehicle, and I turned to Wd. Luleelei in relief.

“Th-They seem angry at Howard, not me,” I said, my voice quaking.

“I'm glad they didn't realize you’re the reason I'm alive,” she said, her own voice quaking.

I wiped a tear. “What do you mean?”

“I’d never felt your type of fear before. You were afraid *for* me, not *of* me. It was filling beyond anything I'd ever experienced.”

“Really? I didn—” I flinched as Howard's truck door crashed against the hotel wall. “I didn't know different fears were different for you.”

“Me neither. Out there, we never form connections with humans, and in the hotel, we're never in situations this dangerous. Your fear for me was so concentrated it was invigorating.” She gave me a worried smile. “You saved my life, but I don't know how to save yours.”

“You're still not safe, you're stuck in there and—” I gasped as an eye stalk peeked out of the ground. “Wd. Layl!”

The eye glanced around in confused horror as a mouth poked out and whispered, “What's going on? The racket got us scared!”

“Howard betrayed us,” Wd. Luleelei said. “He's made a deal with vipirits.”

“What!”

“You have to tell all the spirits to go to my practice spot in the forest,” I said before giving her the location. “There, you'll find a broken bridge over a dried up creek. I've protected the area beneath the bridge. It should fit you all. Stay there until I come for you. Go now while the vipirits are distracted. Please be careful. And please get me a phone before you go.”

“On it,” Wd. Layl said, vanishing.

“What is your plan?” Wd. Luleelei asked.

“I want to call Mrs. Coriz so she can teach me how to remove your barrier.”

“What about you?”

“I don't—”

“What the hell are you doing?” Howard yelled, startling me as he stomped over to the vipirits still tearing his vehicle apart.

They hissed and yelled, letting him know what happened, and he frowned as he walked over to us. I scrambled to my feet, still trembling as I squared my shoulders and faced him with seething hatred.

“What happened here?” He asked in confused shock as he stared at the dead vipirit. 

“Your plan failed,” I spat.

He turned to me, narrowing his eyes. “What did you do?”

“I *wish* I had something to do with this. You just suck at making smart business decisions.”

I gasped and fell against the glass when he punched me. Blinking back involuntary tears, I put a hand up, flinching as I expected him to hit me again.

“Stop, you beast!” Wd. Luleelei cried out.

He ignored her, but he couldn't ignore the vipirits as they threw his truck engine at him. Gasping, we both ducked, and it crashed through the glass, shattering it all around us. My pulse stuttering, I peeked above my arm, and I watched in surprise as Howard marched over to the vipirits and pulled out his banishing weapons.

The vipirits froze and I sat up, hopeful, but my hope didn't last. Howard wasn't chanting. He didn't want to kill them.

“I understand your reaction,” he said. “What happened was unexpected and unfortunate, but it’s by no means an example of our business going forward.”

As Howard spoke, Wd. Luleelei drew my attention to a black object slithering across the sand. If it wasn't for her bright glow, I might have mistaken it for a rat. But it was a cordless phone. Once it was next to me, an eye stalk and a pair of lips protruded from the ground.

“I couldn't find an unlocked cellphone,” Wd. Layl whispered. “I hope this has range from here. All the spirits are out. How else can I help?”

“You should go,” Wd. Luleelei said. “Save yourself."

“I can help. Tell me how.”

I glanced at Howard still making his speech to the vipirits. “I need to call Mrs. Coriz without Howard finding out. Can you call him pretending to be a guest? Preoccupy him? Maybe insult the Coriz name too. He's afraid to lose that reputation.”

“I can do that.” 

“Don't call it here, though. Go as far away as possible. I think after an hour you can stop and go to the bridge. Okay?”

“What about you?”

“Don't worry, rituals don't work on me.”

“But guns do,” Wd. Luleelei said.

“He won't kill me. I know where you guys are.”

“Great, so he'll torture you for information instead,” Wd. Layl said.

“Will you just go? We're wasting time!”

Wd. Layl’s eye stalk glared at me before it disappeared, and I sighed and picked up the phone. After taking a furtive glance behind me, I began dialing Mrs. Coriz's number, only to pause in shock.

“As an apology,” Howard said. “I will remove the barrier off the first fourteen rooms, one spirit for each of you. Do not hurt the guests or damage the rooms.”

My heart dropped and Wd. Luleelei gasped. “Oh, that beast. I'm so glad you told Wd. Layl to get them out!”

The vipirits flew towards the hotel in a ravenous race, and the blood drained from my face as Howard walked towards me. Afraid he'd see the phone, I slipped it between my kneeling legs and leaned over as if I were in pain, hoping Wd. Layl would call him soon.

“Go away!” Wd. Luleelei yelled at him, baring her piranha teeth. “You should be ashamed of yourself!”

“And you should explain to me exactly what happened …” He grabbed my hair and pulled my head up. “... or your friend here will become headless.”

I gasped, tensing up as he pressed his gun to my temple. What was taking Wd. Layl so long?

“I don't know what happened!” Wd. Luleelei said. “It was chasing me and got tired and died!”

I flinched, my rioting pulse throbbing beneath the muzzle as he pressed it harder against my head.

“No, something happened. Why are you so bright?” His eyes widened with realization and he looked at me. “Your fear. It fed her. But somehow even more than the guests. Why? What m—”

His phone rang, and I stifled a quivering sigh of relief. Wd. Layl came through. Howard let go of my hair and picked up, but the gun was still aimed at me. I gulped as I listened to him, hoping she could get him inside.

“This is The Eidolon Hotel … I understand. I'll be right there, give me a few minutes … Now? … I understand, but … No, of course the Coriz’s care about customer satisfaction! … That is our priority, ma’am … Of course we care about the spirits! ... Yes, of course, I'll be right there.”

He hung up and looked between Wd. Luleelei and me. “You two better have answers once I get back.”

The moment he turned and jogged away, I pulled out the phone and called Mrs. Coriz, my hands shaking.

“Hello?” she answered, groggy.

“Mrs. Coriz! I need to know how to remove a barrier that blocks spirits.”

“Why?” she asked in concern, her voice strained. 

She was not only in pain, but also mentally and emotionally vulnerable with her surgery scheduled for tomorrow. I really didn't want to add to her stress, but she needed to know.

“Howard made a deal with the vipirits. I can't tell you everything now because he trapped Wd. Luleelei and I have to free her before he comes back.”

“I see,” she said, stoic as ever. “Repeat after me.”

I listened to her carefully, mimicking her words down to the intonation, and after only two tries, Wd. Luleelei cheered as she fell through the barrier and landed beside me.

“You did it!” she said. “You're getting bett—” She gasped in delight and pointed. “Look!” 

I turned to where she was pointing, and my eyes widened with joy. The railing I was cuffed to had popped free when the truck engine broke through the glass. After a quick tug, I was able to slip the cuff off it, and I stood up, shaking glass shards out of my hair and clothes.

“Go, now,” I said to Wd. Luleelei. “I'll meet up with you all later.”

“I can take you with me.”

“No, I can't leave the guests here with the vipirits and Howard.”

“Are all the spirits safe?” Mrs. Coriz asked through the phone.

“Yes, I got them to evacuate. Wd. Luleelei, go before the vipirits come out all angry and hungry. I'll—”

“Go with Wd. Luleelei. I'll take care of the rest.”

“Mrs. Coriz, you're sick and have surgery tomorrow. I can—”
 
“I said go. This is my mistake and I aim to fix it. I don't want you to get hurt. Go, now.”

After an anxious glance around, I gave in. “Okay. Howard has my phone, so I'll call you from another.”

“Take care. I love you. I'm sorry.”

I swallowed the lump in my throat. No one had ever said they loved me before.

“I love you too, and don't be sorry. I understand why you—”

“Go!”

I hung up, hurled the phone, and held my breath as Wd. Luleelei grabbed my waistband and the back of my shirt. She took off into the sky, and I closed my eyes and hugged myself, afraid of heights, but trusting Wd. Luleelei. And Mrs. Coriz. I just hoped her plan would go off without a hitch.
