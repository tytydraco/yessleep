*“. . . fourteen . . . open . . . effect . . .”*

Frustrated, I shook the radio and tapped against the side of my headset it was connected to, trying to clear some of the static from the garbled messages. It had been bad enough listening to the constant fuzz on our march from Black Oak to the rally point, but as we got further south it seemed a few of our transmissions began to slip through ELSAR’s jammers, enough that I was tortured by the fragments of my husband’s voice on the airwaves. On one hand, I’d nearly wept at knowing he was alive, but on the other hand I couldn’t ignore the continuous drumbeat of exploding artillery shells on the horizon, and the rattle of machine guns that had to be aimed at him. Every part of me wanted to ride straight for Chris, to help him in any way I could, to fight by his side until we could both run to safety, but I knew that wasn’t possible. He could be miles away, and if Chris were with me, he would have told me to be an officer first and his wife second.

*Stubborn man. You better not die out there. I’d never forgive you . . . or myself.*

Under my legs, Styx snorted and pawed the ground to find some grass to nibble, his antlers off-white against the falling snow. Our fellow riders continued down the slope from us, and out of their ranks Jamie trotted up to me astride a small gray mare.

“Anything?” She reigned in her mount to blow warm air into both gloves, Jamie’s shoulders hunched against the frigid wind.

I slipped the radio back into its pouch on my belt and settled the headset back around my ears. “Nothing.”

Her mouth turned into a grim line, and Jamie jerked her blonde head over one shoulder. “Come on, there’s something you need to see.”

Brow furrowed, I spurred my deer to trail behind her, and we cantered over the slopes onto the crest of the nearest hilltop. As the trees opened up, my eyes adjusted to the glare from the fresh snowfall, and I drew in a sharp gasp.

Standing high over the surrounding valley, a large, wide hill lay barren of growth, pockmarked with deep gouges and round craters. I could see the remnants of sharpened logs in a few places, shattered and broken like old toothpicks. Rusted bits of metal fencing torn and toppled bunched around the hill, the pastures empty, the fields abandoned. At the long flat summit, charred, haphazard piles of debris slumped in coats of patchy ice, and it sent pangs of a strange form of yearning through me for a place and time that no longer existed.

“Home sweet home.” Jamie let slide a sad, melancholy smile, and stared out across the frozen landscape at the bones of New Wilderness.

Neither of us moved for a few minutes, the silence filled with windblown flurries and hidden thoughts. So many memories came flooding back, my first night at the reserve, Jamie and I training together, Chris asking me for a dance in his room at the lodge. I’d never known a place could embody so much pain and happiness, every good and bad thing mixed together in a bittersweet ache that rang through my chest like the tolling of a bell. Home. This was home, even more than Louisville had ever been, and it felt as though the old Hannah was ancient history compared to the scarred, quiet girl who sat where I did now.

*Imagine if I had a time machine and could walk into my old life. Would mom and dad even recognize me now? Would I recognize myself?*

“We’ll rebuild it.” Jamie studied the ruins from her saddle, lips pursed in contemplation. “Chris always said the place needed a complete tear-down anyway, in order to make it more defensible; now that everything’s flattened, we can make it twice as big. Use wood for the first wall at the base of the hill, bring in stones from the quarry for the main rampart at the hilltop, drill a new well . . .”

I made a thin but hopeful grin and tried to picture it in my head. “Sounds more like a castle than a zoo.”

She shrugged and Jamie laid a subconscious hand on the Kalashnikov that rested across her lap. “Why not? Give it twenty years and kids won’t even know what the internet was, but stone walls will last forever. New Wilderness might be the most important place in the world, or at least, our part of it.”

We rode on throughout the afternoon and into evening, the dim light of sun fading behind the thick cloud cover. The temperature fell as night closed in, but our animals plodded on, and many riders sacrificed their ration of dry oatmeal so the poor beasts had calories to keep warm. At every step the shelling followed us, the echoes of war sometimes closer, sometimes further, but I noticed it drew nearer the further south we went. It seemed ELSAR was keeping pace with someone, likely Chris, as they retreated in parallel with us across the vast wasteland that once was a part of Ohio. Even as the snowy clouds lit up with flashes of rocket strikes behind us, few spoke, too tired, cold, and tense to carry on anything other than the most essential conversation. At long last, we reached the southern ridgeline and climbed the ice-slick roadway to Hallow’s Run, which led westwards toward the orange glow of several unknown wildfires on the horizon.

*Bawooo.*

Half unconscious in my saddle, the feeling gone from my knees down, I heard the horns of Ark River announcing our arrival, a primitive but un-jammable communication system that we’d fallen back on. Rifle fire still clattered nearby, along with the deep *boom-booms* of our field guns, the shock of their report vibrating in my chest. Together with Jamie, I shook the fatigue from my head and rode forward into the last coalition base north of the ridgeline.

Sean had dug our remaining forces in on a small outcropping that overlooked the western pass, which stretched out in a nearly fifty-foot drop from the summit. Steep slopes meant that any enemy advance would be grueling, and already there were foxholes hacked into the frozen ground with pickaxes and crowbars, dugouts and shelters prepared to house various squads. Trees covered the hillside, but thanks to winter removing most greenery, we had an excellent view of the valley and plenty of brush to conceal our own positions from enemy spotters. The tents, vehicles, and shelters of the camp were on the opposite side of the hill’s crest, keeping them out of view, and thus harder to target. The few trucks still in camp were lined up as if in a proper motor pool, the tents reinforced with plank floors to withstand the cold, and barbed wire had been strung to keep mutants from wandering into the camp. As with Rally Point 9 I could smell woodsmoke but couldn’t see its source, the fire pits no doubt under cover to try and mitigate whatever light they might give off. This was for good reason; perhaps a mile north, I could just make out muzzle flashes in the central forests bordering the pasturelands of the old reserve. However, despite the impending advance of our foes, the people here moved with a tired but steady assurance to their steps, the wounded wrapped in clean bandages, the nurses energetic, the sentries calm at their posts. A large group of coalition fighters stood around the biggest shelters, no doubt with fires inside to keep warm, and they welcomed our ragged men into their midst as we trickled into the camp. It gave me such a great surge of confidence that as we reigned in our trusty beasts near the command tent, I swung down from the stirrups with renewed energy, only to almost topple over as my numb legs gave out.

*Oh man, I really can’t feel anything. I can’t even tell if I’m moving my toes. This is bad.*

“There you are.” Metal clanked, canvas tent flaps rustled, and snow crunched as a strong hand looped under my arm to help me up. “I’d almost given you up for dead. Lansen, a hand?”

Stunned, I blinked at Sean as he and Jamie half-carried me into the warm interior of the command tent. It surprised me how much better he looked even compared to the night prior at the city gate, his color returned, eyes bright with determination, hair combed back in its old manner. He’d donned his coalition uniform beneath many winter layers and wore his old handgun on one hip. A bulletproof vest with rifle magazine pouches lay over his chest, the strap of his M4 across one shoulder. The dull gray metal brace on his right leg clinked and clacked as he moved like an automaton, but our commander looked very much like his old self, and it seemed Sean’s energy permeated the room to draw hopeful gleams in the eyes of the various soldiers around us.

“Well done, boys.” Sean called to Charlie and the rest of my platoon as he draped my arm over his broad shoulders. “That’s all from our left flank. Once Major Dekker turns up, that should do for our right. Then we’ll give those mercs a real thrashing.”

Rare smiles flashed across the faces of my platoon, and I let myself be led inside the command tent, my submachine gun banging against my hip by its leather sling.

On the other side of the rubberized green canvas flaps, a small fire burned in a central metal stove, around which stood a folding table covered in maps, flanked by a few aides, messengers, and a radio operator in the far corner who tried in vain to get signal on his dented main unit. Jamie and Sean lowered me into a chair by the stove, and one of the aides came to help pry my snowy boots off, an elderly woman sporting the red and white armband of a Researcher medic.

“Thin boots and wet socks; it’s a wonder we have anyone left who can walk.” With a scolding note in her voice, the medic yanked my socks off to reveal pale, wrinkled skin that didn’t so much as tingle when she poked at my toes. “You’ll have swelling for sure, but I don’t think you’ll lose any toes. Still, they’re going to hurt like the dickens when the feeling comes back, and you’ll be more prone to cold-weather injuries from now on, so if you don’t want to lose a foot, *stay here* until everything dries out. That’s doctor’s orders too, so don’t give me any of that officer nonsense.”

This last bit seemed directed both at me and at Sean, who granted the wrinkled woman a polite bow of his head as one might do with their grandmother. Shame-faced, I did the same and propped my feet up so they were close to the stove, wrapped in spare rags from my weapon cleaning kit that were passably dry. Jamie sat down beside me, and the old woman left to tend to others from our column, doubtless with similar words for their injuries.

“If I’d known where to find you, I would have sent more help.” Sean offered Jamie and I paper cups of steaming tea, and sat in his own chair across the little scrap iron stove from us. “I was a fool, thinking the left flank would hold long enough for your boys to make it out. From the reports Ethan sent, it’s a miracle any of you made it out.”

Half delirious from the wonderful heat of the woodstove, I accepted the handshake and tea with trembling hands. “We lost a lot of good men on the retreat. It was a bloodbath, from start to finish. I tried to evacuate the aid station, but ELSAR moved tanks in and . . .”

He waved my confession off, and Sean limped back around to lean on the table with both hands. “I’m not angry, Hannah; the fact anyone survived at all is enough. Besides, we still managed to come out with decent numbers. Combining our own soldiers, Ark River troops, and what resistance fighters came with us, we have around 600 men. A further three hundred Ark River men went with Mrs. Stirling.”

Jamie rubbed her hands together over the vent slits on the stove, and glanced at him. “Did Adam make it?”

Sean’s expression fell a little at that, and he rubbed at his square chin. “They had to amputate both of his legs below the knee. Sandra did it herself, before they shipped him off to Ark River. He’ll recover, but when he does, Adam will have to relearn how to walk, ride, and even run with whatever prosthetics our Researchers can piece together. Needless to say, Eve was devastated.”

*Naturally.*

My guts churned at the memory of her tear-streaked face at the aid station, how Eve had shielded her husband’s body from the falling debris with primal desperation. Had it been Chris, I would have lost my mind. I couldn’t imagine how dismal the ride back through the southlands would be for her, what with the baby still on the way and the love of Eve’s life now crippled by a war no one asked for. The more I imagined myself in her place, the sicker I felt, and had to force my thoughts back to the task at hand in order to keep nausea at bay.

As if picking up on my grim disposition, Sean put a wooden token on the map in front of him, a little rook piece from a chess set that marked the citadel at Ark River. “The good news is that Eve can help prepare a full evacuation of the fortress in the event ELSAR decides to bombard it. At this rate, the only thing keeping them from doing so is likely our rearguard attacking their advancing units. They can’t spare the munitions to hit our rear areas while we have them engaged, so it’s bought us some time. I’m confident over the winter we can glean several hundred more recruits from the civilian refugees, once we set up alternative camps in the southern marshlands.”

*Boom.*

Somewhere to the north, another artillery shell exploded, and everyone in the room seemed to hold their breath in reflex.

“Of course, that leaves us with a problem.” Sean’s optimism slipped, and I saw in his grimace the same stress we all felt; the weight of a massive decision bearing down on his shoulders. He pointed to a series of roads on the faded paper, much of which had been updated by our scouts with highlighters or ink pens to show which routes were no longer viable due to the war or neglect. “Right now we have thousands of civilians streaming down our main supply route hoping to get away from ELSAR. As I said, we need them in order to rebuild in the south, especially if we want to replenish our combat units in any meaningful way, but the enemy is catching up fast. From what little information we’ve been able to pass back and forth via messengers, Major Dekker is delaying the enemy with hit-and-run attacks three miles to the north, but he’s losing ground fast. I expect him and his command to be here in a few hours, and once they arrive, every mercenary in Barron County is going to converge on this spot.”

I didn’t miss the eyes of the aides in the tent that flicked in my direction, but was too engrossed in the tightness inside my own lungs to care. Knowing that Chris and his men were fighting for every inch of those lost miles was enough to make my nausea return with a vengeance. Even if his forces managed to escape without being destroyed, we would still be in contact with ELSAR’s main force by midnight.

*We’ve already been awake for 24 hours now . . . can Chris make it another two?*

Scowling at the lines traced before him, Sean picked other little wooden tokens off the map one by one to show how depleted our army had become. “Most of our armored vehicles . . . hell almost of *all* our vehicles have been destroyed, captured, or ran out of fuel during the retreat, which means anything we send to help is as good as stuck on the front. More of our scattered units are trickling in all the time, but if the enemy gets past Dekker, they’ll drive right down the valley and through the pass, which means game over for us. However, if we leave now and blow the pass behind us, it’ll strand our rearguard as well as the rest of the civilians on this side of the ridge . . . with ELSAR. Considering the damage they’re willing to inflict this time around, I doubt they’d be merciful to either group.”

Machine gun fire echoed from a few miles off, a skin-crawling reminder that we didn’t have much time. At my side, Jamie said nothing, but held her AK propped against her chest, eyes staring into the floor with deep, morose thought.

Sean kept his eyes on the map, like a skilled poker player watching the cards he’d been dealt, and turned a wooden chess knight over in his fingers. “Once this snow clears up, we’ll have planes and drones all over us, along with as much artillery as ELSAR can buy. Our boys have about had it, and we need downtime to resupply that we just won’t get. Koranti knows all this, and he’s gonna push us until we drop because he expects us to keep running like we’ve been doing all night. Either that, or some desperate counterattack like what Dekker has been doing to keep the mercs at bay. What he *doesn’t* expect, is for us to do neither.”

Placing the remaining tokens at various positions, Sean grew more animated, his resilience building as he presented an idea that had clearly been on his mind for hours at least. It was infectious, an electric hope that sparked across the tense air, and I found myself leaning in on my chair, hanging on our commander’s every word.

“We go dark.” With pencil in hand, Sean drew rough lines and circles to show various new positions in the landscape around the pass. “Abandon the camp, leave some things behind to make it look like a full rout, just like before. Light a few spare tents on fire, scatter some old clothes, rig up a few dummy gun emplacements. I’ve already briefed the other officers; Ethan will take the rest of our transports and move half our number through the pass, and as many refugees as he can. Aleph has taken command of the Ark River cavalry and will link up with Chris to help him break contact; Dekker’s order are to run like crazy for the pass as soon as that happens. The other 300 fighters will dig in here, around the road down in the valley.”

“We have an elevated position here.” Raising her head at last, Jamie folded her arms across her chest in confusion. “Why abandon the heights just to get on the enemy’s level? Their tanks will roll right over us, and they can call an artillery strike at any moment.”

At this however, Sean moved more pieces on the table to prove his point. “Which is exactly why we have to get in close. Their advantage is being able to stand off at long distance and hit us with shells; we take that advantage away by getting in close, so they can’t fire without hitting their own men. So long as the snow keeps blowing, they can’t bring their planes to bear, which means without tank or artillery support, we’re almost even. We cover our foxholes with our ponchos and snow, use the forested areas for cover, and dig every field gun or tank we have left in deep so they’re harder to hit. Once ELSAR’s armor passes us, we attack the troop transports from all sides and use our dug-in tanks to wipe out their vehicles. If we can kill enough of them, maybe we can buy time for both the refugee train and Dekker’s rearguard to make it through the pass. They won’t be expecting a well-planned ambush if we convince them we’re beaten, so we let their arrogance lead them right into our trap.”

I paused from rubbing at my now tingling feet and noted the mathematical imbalance between us and our enemies, the ELSAR markers easily three times as numerous. “Why send half of our number away? We can do much more damage with our entire force. With luck, we might even stabilize a new defensive line.”

“Because there won’t be enough time for all of us to make it through.” Sean’s eyes flickered with a glimmer of remorse, as if delivering the punchline on a sad joke. “The men who fight with me are going to die, Hannah. Once we dig in, we hold our positions until they kill us.”

Stunned silence followed, broken only by the distant gunfire drawing nearer. I thought of Chris, out there risking his life for me, for us, for our future, along with his men. I thought of Jamie next to me, of her brother Bill, of all the people who had sacrificed so much to get us this far. If there was to be any way of holding back the gray tide of our enemy, it had to be found here. Yet, I also couldn’t help but think of what I’d been told in the sunlit clearings of the redeemed Tauerpin Road. The Breach was closed, Barron County would be dragged through the tear in reality to another timeline, one where ELSAR had no sway. I wanted to tell Sean, to beg him to change his mind, but even now I realized that this knowledge wouldn’t make a single grain of difference. ELSAR was closing in, The truth was simple; if we wanted to live to see the new world promised to us on the other end of reality, then we had to put up a fight like never before.

One waged to the last bullet, the last shell, the last breath.

*Justice must yet be done in the old world.*

The One’s voice rang in my thoughts, and I worked up the courage to meet Sean’s gaze. “I’ll stay.”

“No, you won’t.” He gestured to the green canvas strap on my shoulder holding the launch panel, and Sean added a few tokens denoting where 4^(th) Platoon would be stationed. “You’ll remain in the heights above the pass to take command of the artillery batteries and demolition teams. From there you’ll provide fire support for us and detonate the charges to seal the pass when the time comes. If we fail, you are to carry out your special instructions as we’ve discussed, but if the plan works, you’ll retreat south with the others and continue the fight.”

“But that’s not fair.” I stammered, too shocked and frustrated to recognize the insolent nature of my rising tone. “You’re far more important than I am, why leave me behind? I can fight, my feet aren’t that bad, you *need* me out there.”

To his credit, Sean didn’t bark a harsh response to my outburst but limped to stand in front of me by the wood stove. “I’m not sidelining you, Hannah. You have an important mission, one I wouldn’t entrust to anyone else. If I don’t make it out of this, I want to ensure my final bill passes the Assembly.”

With that he handed me an envelope, and upon opening it, my jaw dropped.

*I, Sean William Hammond, issue as my final order to the combined forces of the New Wilderness and Ark River coalition, a promotion for one Captain Hannah Elizabeth Dekker to the rank of Major and declare her commander in chief of all coalition forces in absence of myself and Major Christopher Dekker. As well, if it should pass that myself, or Major C. Dekker, or any other official with a better legal claim to the office dies or relinquishes their role, I hereby nominate Major H. Dekker to fill the post of interim president of our republic, and have her name added to the ballot for an official vote by the general population at nearest convenience. All clearances, authorities, and defense secrets fit for the station are to be transferred to her, along with the rights and privileges endowed to the Assembly leader written down in our bylaws.*

*Signed,*

*Commander Sean W. Hammond*

Before I could speak, Sean held up one calloused hand to stop me. “You know what’s at stake. I cannot leave our political and military structure up to chance. I want to hope that Chris will make it through, but in the event this ends in tragedy for us both, then I’ll know I’ve done right by our people.”

At this point, most of the aides filtered out of the tent, leaving few of us in the small canvas structure, yet I felt as though I were on a stage before a thousand peering faces. True, the idea of leading the new government had arisen in my mind once before, but at Colonel Riken’s prompting, not my own. I didn’t want the presidential seat; I wanted to see Chris in it. If I occupied the office, it would mean that my husband was dead, and despite knowing how important our rebellion was, that thought made my lungs constrict in painful twitches.

*It's just a precaution, the plan will work, this is just a precaution, that’s all . . .*

Sean offered a handshake to Jamie and I, at which we both swayed to our feet in delirious surprise.

Grasping my palm, he leaned close to whisper, and Sean’s dark eyes never broke from mine. “I’m counting on you.”

Emotion swelled in my chest like a tidal wave, and I sniffled, remembering the first night I’d walked into his office back at New Wilderness to join the Rangers. “I-I won’t let you down.”

Jamie’s thin smile bore a grievous pain that seemed etched deep in my bones, and she pulled her right arm into one last salute. “It’s been an honor, sir.”

“The honor was mine.” Waving to his few remaining aides to gather up the maps, Sean marched to the entrance of the tent via the support of his metal leg brace, and we followed him as the canvas parted to reveal a mass of waiting faces.

The 300 men who had been picked for this moment stood in formation, grim, exhausted, but determined. They watched in mute expectation as Sean limped forward to inspect them, his brace clanking with every step. He had to be in pain, I knew that, but it never showed. Instead, Sean paced up and down the formation a few times, before one of his aides helped him clamber onto a nearby empty crate.

Our breath fogging in the air, Jamie and I shuffled to join the other members of our forces who looked on in silent expectation. Gone was the haunted, broken man I’d seen at the city square, and yet gone also was the Sean I’d known from New Wilderness. Here stood someone else, someone larger than life, a striking figure in the dark tactical armor and the green uniform of our fledgling nation that rose like a mountain against the blowing flakes of snow all around him. Gunfire continued to echo in the background while the shelling drew closer, but the impending doom lost some of its ferocity for the way our commander looked out at each and every one of us.

“Some would look at where we are today and tell us it’s hopeless.” His expression hardened into a stoic glare, and Sean gazed into the eyes of his chosen few like they were sons and daughters of his own. “They would say we’re too few, that we don’t have the supplies or the guns to make a difference. Such men, lesser men, would look at what we have done, the cost we have paid, and say it was all in vain.”

No one spoke, other workers, medics, and soldiers crowding around the neat ranks of the volunteers to listen, their pale faces craned upward in desperate hope. It seemed the entire camp trickled in from all sides, including the sentries who were too enamored by the scene to return to their posts.

“But when I stand here, I do not see what we do not have.” Sean raised both arms to the crowd, sharing their thoughts with a simple look. “I see the lives of those who have gone before us. Tell me, when the first of the mutants came, and your spouse threw themselves between you and the beasts so that you could escape, did their death mean nothing? When the soldiers dragged off your children, tortured them, killed them for refusing to give you up, did their blood go to waste? When a patrol took your brothers, when a fever claimed your sisters, did they vanish from this world for no reason?”

Tension hung in the air, thicker than the snowfall, agony etched on the countenance of everyone as they relived the worst memories of their lives.

With a shake of his head, Sean pointed first to his chest, then to the smoke on the northern horizon. “Our lives are *not* our own. We were paid for, bought with the blood of those who loved us most. They died so that we might live, and it falls to us now to honor that debt. What we do, here and now, will determine the worth of their souls.”

Beside me, Jamie wiped her face, and I wondered if she thought of Bill. I slid my cold hand into hers and did my best not to cry as the parade of memories rose in my mind. Andrew. Tex. Kabba. Andrea. So many faces, so many names, so many people, gone.

*Who will remember them if we all die?*

“I want you to know I’m proud of you.” Rifle on his shoulder, our commander turned on the crate to take in the whole crowd, wearing a tired but warm smile. “*All* of you. The world will forget what we do here, but there will be generations to come because of you. Our enemy fights for money and power, but we fight in the name of our families, our friends, of all mankind. We struggle in the memory of everyone who gave their all to carry us to this day, and the love that binds them to us even now. This is not defeat; our victory will be the laughter of tomorrow’s children. Our triumph will be the survival of our species, the planting of humanity’s flag on our soil once more, the dawn of a new era in history. We *will* turn the tide, and when that day comes, those who follow after us will look back on our suffering with joy, for we will have built a better world with our own blood.”

Artillery thundered beyond the distant forest, and I had the presence of mind to dig into my bag and retrieve my camera. Pointing it at Sean, I hit the record button and watched with bated breath as the sky lit up with the flashes of approaching battle.

“If the enemy breaks through our lines, they will take the pass, and thousands more will die.” Sean’s tone became one of powerful conviction, and he jabbed a finger at the pass below. “If ELSAR wins this war, they will sweep the ashes of our loved ones into the dustbins of history, and no one will ever know we were here. These lesser men come to annihilate us. Stand with me, and let’s give them a fight worthy of our families’ blood.”

A few men muttered in agreement, heads nodded, and one or two people shouted their approval from the crowd. Energy built up between the ranks, a growing anticipation that was like electric current in their eyes. Everything had been taken from us, our little army on the brink of total decimation, but here at last our hope was reborn.

“You are not Workers.” Sean raised his rifle high, his energy infectious, as the men began to cheer in time to each of his sentences with their own weapons raised. “You are not Researchers. Today, brothers and sisters, you are vengeance . . .”

A shout went up from the chosen 300, one that spread into the surrounding crowd with vibrant defiance. Fear melted away, weariness retreated, and in the face of every coalition soldier I glimpsed a strength that raised goosebumps on my skin.

“. . . you are wrath . . .” Sean’s eyes blazed with the fire of a Greek demi-god, zealous and unwavering.

Deafening war cries erupted from the camp, the shouts building in volume and number, as collective fervor spilled forth with volcanic intensity. At some point, I found myself cheering with them alongside Jamie as Sean belted out the finale of his speech.

“. . .  you are *my Rangers*.”

Together we raised our guns to the sky, roared at the top of our aching lungs, and readied to descend into hell together, one last time.
