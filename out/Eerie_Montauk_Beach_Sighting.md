In the summer of 2017 or 2018, I was in Montauk with some friends. Earlier in the day, I had been arguing with my girlfriend, and after a few drinks, I went to bed around 4–5 p.m., frustrated and wanting to avoid the situation. I woke up around 3:30 a.m., with everyone still asleep, and found myself unable to fall back asleep. So, I decided to head down to the beach.

The night was pitch black, with only the faint glow of moonlight offering any visibility. The path down to the beach was a bit unsettling— a wooden staircase leading down a steep cliff, overgrown with shrubbery. I grabbed a beach chair, planning to relax in solitude after a long night of sleep. The isolation helped clear my mind, and despite the eeriness of being alone at 4 a.m., I felt surprisingly calm.

About 20 minutes later, I heard something behind me, about 20 yards up from where I was sitting near the staircase. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and saw two pairs of eyes reflecting back at me from the bushes. I assumed they were just nocturnal animals like raccoons or cats, but it was unsettling to be watched in the pitch black. The eyes moved slowly, eventually retreating up the cliff. It felt strange, but it was 4 a.m., and I was alone on a beach—of course, it was creepy.

Eventually, I dozed off in the chair. But around 4:45–5:00 a.m., I was woken by a sound that seemed like a deer stomping or running nearby. I looked around, but didn’t see anything. The area was pitch black, so if anything had been there, it could have quickly run away. Still, it felt off—especially after the eyes in the bushes—and I decided to walk along the beach to catch the sunrise.

At around 5 a.m., I started walking between Shadmoor State Park Beach and Ditch Plains Beach. The sky remained dark as the sun began to rise. I took a few photos of the scenery and noticed I was now farther from the houses, though they were visible in the distance. That’s when I saw something strange in the water. At first, I thought it was a black swan, which seemed odd given the location, so I walked closer. As I approached, I realized it was a human-like figure far out in the water—where no one could realistically stand unless there was a sandbar (but there didn’t appear to be one).

Considering that just 15 minutes earlier, it had been pitch black, and I was far from any houses, it seemed incredibly strange for someone to be standing motionless in the water at that hour. The figure remained perfectly still, not reacting to the waves at all. I couldn’t tell if it was looking at me or even if it was alive.

I used to have a Live Photo of this on my iPhone, but over the years, it got corrupted, leaving me with just a still image. In the original Live Photo, the waves were moving, but the figure didn’t move with the water like a person or animal would. It just stood there motionless, as if rooted to the ground. I continued to watch, trying to make sense of what I was seeing. The figure didn’t reflect any light—it was as black as could be. I approached as close as I dared and snapped a photo. At that moment, I felt an overwhelming, inexplicable sensation—something I couldn’t rationalize.

I’m a pretty logical and rational person and don’t really believe in things like the paranormal, aliens, or the supernatural etc.—at least not without clear proof. But the shape of the figure, its stillness, and its position in the water seemed unexplainable. Sure, there could have been a sandbar, but even if that were the case, it would still be strange for someone to be standing there, in the dark, with no one else around. Initially, I thought it was a bird, but as I looked closer and took the photo, it looked like it was a 10-foot-tall black figure, standing motionless in the water. I turned and started walking away, glancing back at the figure as I moved.

As I walked, the figure seemed to shift with the rising sun and the tide. The further I went, the smaller it appeared. The last time I saw it, it appeared to shrink, as though it was sinking or disappearing over the horizon. When I reached a large rock about 100 yards away, I turned and walked back a little toward the figure’s direction, hoping to spot it again, but by then, it had completely disappeared.

At this point, the idea that it was a person didn’t add up. No one ever came out of the water or onto the beach; the figure just faded away. I briefly entertained the idea of it being a scuba diver, but the thought of someone gearing up in complete darkness on such a desolate beach seemed unlikely. The figure had appeared motionless, and if it were a human, it would have had to be standing on a sandbar—one that I couldn’t see.

The figure had no movement, no subtle shifts, nothing that suggested it was a person. It remained perfectly still, as if rooted to the ocean floor. No sounds, no signs of movement—just complete silence. It was unnervingly unnatural. Some thought it could have been a buoy or driftwood, but that didn’t explain the figure’s behavior. Normally, debris or a buoy would float and bob with the waves, but this figure didn’t budge. It stayed perfectly still.

Given the time, location, and the bizarre events that led to this moment—like the fight with my girlfriend, the animal eyes watching me, the deer waking me up, and ultimately leading me to the figure on the beach—there was something undeniably strange about the whole situation.

In some of the other photos, taken before I even noticed the figure, it seems to shift positions slightly, almost as if it were “moving its arms.” But in the main photo, it was entirely motionless, as though frozen in place. In hindsight, it almost felt as if the figure stopped moving when it noticed me, pausing before I slowly backed away. The stillness of that moment stood out, and it almost felt like it was reacting to my presence.

I’m the first to doubt these kinds of things, but this was so eerie, so out of place, that it felt like something else—like I wasn’t meant to see it or was in the wrong place at the right time. The figure didn’t behave like anything I could identify. I even enhanced the photo by increasing the contrast, trying to make out more details, but the figure remained black, reflecting almost no light at all. Without the photos, I’d never entertain this story if someone else told me about it.

The experience still bothers me. I can’t explain what I saw, and I can’t shake the feeling it was something out of place. I’ve shared the story with a few friends, but the mystery remains unsolved. Some have suggested it could be Navy or Marine-related, others think it might be an angel, a spiritual being, or something like an alien, sea monster, mermaid, or skinwalker.

The location where I had this strange encounter is just a few miles from Camp Hero, a former military base near Montauk Point. The area is known for its connection to the Montauk Project, a conspiracy theory claiming secret government experiments in mind control, time travel, and other unexplained phenomena took place there. Locals often report odd occurrences, like mysterious lights and a sense of being watched, which only adds to the unsettling nature of the place. Given the eerie history of the region, it’s hard not to wonder if the strange figure I saw in the water had some connection to the folklore and strange happenings that have surrounded Montauk for decades. Whatever it was, I’d rather not see it again.

None of these photos are edited (except the contrast one), by the way. You may have to zoom into the background on some photos to see the figure in different positions. I truly wish I still had that live photo.

I can't post photos here but the post is on my profile with all photos.

What is this thing..?
