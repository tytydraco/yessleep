[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1eh6576/do_not_trust_your_foster_mother/)

Thanks to a lot of the advice in this subreddit. I did decide to meet the woman who wanted to kill my mom and then kill herself to keep the fight going in Hell. I know it's different but, as I talked to her online and said I'd meet her, I didn't feel too different from her daughter in a way. A stranger talks to you out of the blue and tells you you have some grand purpose to complete. Ivy ended up with her youth stolen and a death worse than anyone deserves. I did not want to end up like Ivy. However, the risk is the right one to take, right? Because it's important to do the right thing. Because it makes other people do the right thing and we're all happier for it, right? 

And, please don't judge me, but when I write, I try to be honest. I am sixteen years old, I've been in seven different families, and I can never call any of them home. I really hope if I'm good, I can have a home and a family. 

*Ivy thought the same thing though, huh?* That if you listen to the right person, they'll whisk you away to a magical land full of sunshine, purpose, art, and people that love you. But Ivy's dead.

This revelation shocked me as I got out of my mom's car and walked inside the ice cream shop we were supposed to meet. I put on a tough face though and tried to think tough thoughts. I'm not orphan Annie. I'm orphan Bruce Wayne with boobs. Of course, I was scared, though. I was meeting a stranger who could toss me in their van, or pull out a gun and tell me I had to do what they said. 

I swung my keys in a tight circle as I walked to put all my nervous energy there. I strolled with purpose. I checked my surroundings, all ten of my house keys jingled. If I'm given a house key, I never take it off. If keys to the home need to turn to knives that slice heads, I will be ready. 

Surroundings checked: it's a summer night, orange skies, and the ice cream store only has a few customers. A couple on a date, a family with a kid in high school, and Ferran, the woman I'm supposed to meet. We make awkward eye contact through the glass. That scared me but, I've met adults who've hated me, so I'm used to not showing fear. I gave a curt nod. She gave a curt nod. I walked in. 

I ignored her in the booth on the other end of the store and headed straight to the cash register. No games. She won't manipulate me. I decided I wouldn't let her pay for my ice cream or even try to withhold it for a second to chat more.  I decided I'd run this conversation. I even looked at the menu online to know what to order. I knew I planned this to the letter and I knew it wouldn't end with my loss.

"Hello," I said to the dark-haired man behind the register. "Can I get the chocolate macchiato," I paused for half a second; I was shocked by what I saw behind the counter, then I continued without missing a beat because like I said, I'm Bruce Wayne with boobs. "in a small bowl with sprinkles."

"Sure thing, anything else?" he said back. 

"No, thank you."

"Any toppings?" 

"Just sprinkles."

"Okay," he punched in the numbers with a smile but slow unease with the task.

I waited for my order. I held my arms by my side. I placed two sets of keys on my knuckles. Based on what I saw behind the counter I knew I would be turning my keys into knives. My eyes never left the server at his task. He gave two scoops of chocolate macchiato, selected a medium bowl, and then put them in the bowl. 

"Have a good night," he said and handed me my food. 

"You too," I smiled and walked away. The light in the ice cream parlor was too dim.

Normally fine, unsettling now. I couldn't get great reads on the expressions of others.

I sat across from Ferran, the woman I was supposed to meet. I noticed she was in a wheelchair. Was that genuine or part of an act?

"What's wrong?" she asked. 

"Nothing's wrong."

"No," she was stern, business-like, like a college professor who didn't care if you passed their class or not.  "Something's wrong." 

"How can you tell?" 

"Your face."

That annoyed me. Most adults and people couldn't read my expressions well. 

"The problem is," I said, "that man behind the counter hates me. Like throat-crushing-in-your-sleep hate."

"Do you know him?"

"Nope."

"How can you tell he hates you?" she asked, undisturbed.

"Experience… it's a vibe," I said. "We might need to leave." 

"What? No, why? I can protect you. I promised I could protect you," she reached out for my hand. I swatted it away. 

"I can protect myself, and now that I think about it, I don't like how you're not alarmed."

She rolled her eyes. 

"What?” She asked. “Do you want me to cry and hug you?"

"I'm leaving," I said and pushed off the table. When I whirled around toward the door, the man from the counter stood in my path, shaking and holding a gun.

"No--- no-. You gotta stay here.." he demanded. I couldn't tell if he was more angry or more scared. The other patrons were strange. They didn't duck for cover, they didn't gape at us,  all of them pretended not to look. Those weren't customers. This was a setup. I leaped behind Ferran, dumped her out of her wheelchair, and slammed her to the floor. My keys pressed against her neck.

"I will slice her open if I don't get answers right now!" I demanded.

"N-- no-.. No, you give us answers," the man with the gun said, and every fake patron turned to me, accepting the jig was up.

"The only answer is I'm going to slit her throat if someone doesn't explain what's going on."

Ferran yelled beneath me, "Your mother is the Old Soul!" 

"Yeah, and what exactly is that?"

"She's not from our world. She's from a world of people like her, and she's feasting on us. Someone trapped her in that book and took her to our world."

"Okay... and who are you people?"

"Well, I'm ex-FBI and these are volunteers. They've lost someone to the Old Soul and don't like you. You're the only one she's spared. So, they don't trust you. They think you're responsible for their lost loved ones."

I looked harder at the cast she assembled. They all hated me. Their posture was too stiff, their lips too tight, and a shade of red grew underneath their expressions. If I were burning alive, they'd risk third-degree burns to be the ones to choke the life out of me.

"But they won't hurt you because we need you. So, how about we meet somewhere else?" Ferran said beneath me.

"Guns," was my only response.

"Derrick," she commanded, "slide the gun to her."

Derrick complied. The gun slid and whisked against the floor.

"I said guns," I repeated and pressed my knee into Ferran's back.

"Alright, alright. They're volunteers, not SEALs." Ferran said. "They wouldn't have shot you. Everyone, slide your guns this way."

They did as commanded and everyone slid their guns across the floor. They slid into a pile and it looked so extreme, so silly, so mean, seven guns all for me. I didn’t believe her. They really all hated me.

"Okay, if we meet elsewhere,” my voice cracked. I held my tears back but it hurt. They hated me but didn’t know me. I had just lost my foster mom and I was trying to do the right thing by helping these people and they hated me.

"Fine."

We met at the only place I felt safe, my foster mother's home. She was usually away in the mid-afternoon and encouraged me to invite a friend or even a boy over... She's um very open and trusting, so I felt kind of sick taking advantage of it.  *What if my foster mom really wasn’t evil?* Regardless, I did.

We went into my room. I had to carry her up the steps and then come back for her wheelchair. It was as awkward as it sounds. I don't think any of us were the type of person to make jokes. 

Once we got there, Ferran judged my room. It's always clean, just a little moody. I've been told it's dark. My posters of Billie Eilish(classic Billie note new Billie I’m still not sure how I feel about that song with Charli), Dream of the Endless (debating taking it down for obvious reasons), and Batwoman (Cassandra Cain) give the vibe that I'm some goth chick, but I find all of them hopeful in their own way. The black bedsheets and dark purple pillows don't help though.

"I know you said she's not coming," Ferran said, "but can we put the TV on so if she does come, she won't hear us talking? You can just say I'm your girlfriend or something."

"I'm not gay," I said.

Ferran squinted in disbelief but said nothing.

"I'm not gay," I repeated.

Ferran shrugged, "It's the purple hair."

"I just like the color..." I mumbled. Then changed subjects. "What should I put on the TV?" I grabbed the remote and clicked away.

"Whatever is natural. What do you normally watch on TV?"

"Oh, like stuff on Disney Plus. 'Dog with a Blog' and stuff like that."

She chuckled, then giggled, then full-on laughed.

"What's so funny?" I asked.

"It's just that my daughter felt she was too old for it and here you go watching it."

"Alright... do you have to criticize everything?" 

"You see why I'm a terrible mother, huh?"

I didn't know how to respond, so I didn't. The 'Dog with a Blog' theme played in the back.

"I thought I was doing the right thing abandoning them," she said. "I'm obviously not an FBI field agent, just a data junkie, so most of my work could have been done from home. " She sighed and rested her hand on her chin. "But I could tell everyone was getting fed up with me, so I left. I said duty calls and no one could argue."

"I'm sorry... If it helps, they didn't seem fed up to me in the letters."

"Isn't that crazy? How love works? How merciful it really is." She shed a tear and wiped it away faster than it came down. "Okay, here's a breakdown of our plan..." I held myself and sighed. I wish I could feel that love. 

She went into logistics. The more she talked, the madder I got. The TV was too loud. She was going into too much detail. And honestly I realized I didn't want to sacrifice everything I had for anybody.

I paced through the room pretending to listen. My mind wandered and I thought about this time when I was 13. I made friends with this girl, Vicky Vanessa. She talked too much and maybe had slight autism. She was not popular. Anyway, she also still liked Disney Channel, was sweet, and made me laugh. She usually sat by herself at lunch, so I thought that was weird and I asked her to sit with my friends. Long story short, they hated her, they said don't bring her back. So naturally, because Vicky didn't have friends, I chose her. I knew what it was like to not have friends. 

I loved her and she was ecstatic to have a friend. We spent so many days together. She wasn't stupid, she knew hanging with her was social suicide. She'd always have a grateful twinkle in her eye. And yet, when I moved, she ghosted me. I messaged her on IG, Twitter (not calling it X), TikTok; I even found her on Facebook and I was still ghosted. So, what's the point of all this? When I needed her... when I was being tossed around foster homes, she left me. Why should I give up my perfect life for someone who doesn't care about me?

"You're not going to go through with it, are you?" Ferran said in the midst of my pacing

"What? Yeah, of course I will."

"No, you won't." Ferran was pissed. She pressed her teeth together and wrinkles formed on her forehead. "I see your eyes glazing over. What's the problem?"

"No, problem. I'm just tired."

Neither of us talked. The audience laughed and clapped at a pretty bad joke on the TV. I sighed. She called my bluff, correctly. 

"I like my life," I admitted. "I know it's selfish but I don't want to give it up."

"And why should you ruin your life for anybody?" 

"Yes!" The words poured out and I realized I had been holding them in for hours.

"You should help because evil is an infection and it always spreads. It might take a while but it'll be your turn soon enough."

"What if I'm immune?"

"You're not."

"What if I am? What if I'm the one person the Old Soul cares about?"

"She's a monster."

"She's somebody!"

"Oh... and you've never had somebody."

"No! So why do I have to give it up?" I was yelling, furious. I slammed my fist on the bed. It left a big black indentation that did not pop up immediately.

Ferran chuckled at me and looked at the TV.

"Despite loving 'Dog with a Blog,' you've been through some stuff. Haven't you, kid?"

"Yes, so don't lie to me."

Ferran chuckled at the dog typing away on the screen. She still didn't look at me.

"Molly, this doesn't end with you getting some award, divine or otherwise. The FBI says the Old Soul is too much of a threat to address, so I don't have their funding nor resources. I'm so poor from tracking her down, renting an ice cream shop, and buying bullets, I couldn't even buy you a plastic trophy. You'll be an orphan about to age out of the system if you survive. I'm not adopting you or anything dumb like that. Like I said, I'm killing myself when this ends. I don't want to live. The only guarantee you have is that a bunch of strangers you don't know won't die, a bunch of innocents. A little justice. Is that good enough for you? Yes or no?"

"Yes," I said, unsure if I meant it.

The next day, Mom (or should I call her the Old Soul) and I walked up to the front of the ice cream store. I said I'd go with the plan and I was nervous ever since. 

"Wait," the Old Soul said. Her voice was always cracky and scratched, almost like a teenage boy's. But I assure you, her words were always poised, poignant, and sharp. "Your hair's a mess," she said and came forward to adjust it. Ever since the email, everything about her disturbed me. The way her eyebrows danced as I lied to her, the way she brought her cane everywhere but she never let the bottom touch, and that sweater of victims… their faces always changed. Never smiles. Now many had frowns of concern for me.

"Oh, you're sweating," the Old Soul said and brushed my cheek. I flinched. I stayed in a home once where I was smacked a lot. *Did she know that? Was she toying with me?*

"It's hot, Mom."

"Not for a girl from Mississippi," she mocked and raised her eyebrows in that dance I found so silly before. I sweated more, my heart ran rapid, and I wanted to run just as fast.

"It's like 90, right? That’s hot."  We were so close, so close the door. Once inside I at least had allies but here I was exposed.

"It's 80 and your face is flushed... Oh." The people on her sweater also made the same shocked expression. "Disheveled hair and face still flushed. Molly, did you just see a boy before asking me for ice cream?"

"Oh," I laughed, relieved. "No, Mom, you're so gross!" I held the door for her and mocked her. "Nasty old lady." 

"I don't know why you're ever surprised. You know exactly what I am," she laughed and laughed. *Did she know I knew?* The comment unsettled me. I opened the door for us and we walked in.

"You want to take a seat. I'll order the ice cream for us."

"Oh, what manners. We'll have to keep this fella around if he gets you acting like this."

The mission was simple. Deliver her person ice cream without dying. Everyone else here was backup I hoped we didn’t need.

I flicked her off behind my back. It's frightening to betray someone, even someone who deserves it. And to turn your back on them? I imagined her laughing at me, her smite would be as wicked as a gator, and her laugh as quiet as the wind. I wanted to look back. I was briefed multiple times that looking back would be a dead giveaway though, suicide. So, I walked forward, almost forgetting how. I took small self-conscious steps and switched my gait at least 4 times. Again, like yesterday, I spoke to the man at the counter. 

"Hey, I'll take a vanilla and a butter pecan, please."

"What size?" A single bead of sweat rested on his forehead. 

"Two medium cups please," he coughed twice just to get that sentence out. Under pressure it appeared he wasn’t the best either. 

"Any toppings?"

"Just sprinkles."

He gave me the price, I used Apple Pay and tipped $2.00. And I waited. Nerves took over my body. I couldn't stay still. I tapped my foot, I watched the clock tick, tick, tick. I rattled my nails against the counter, I sighed deeply and inhaled the magical aroma of an ice cream shop, and I probably made eye contact with every person in the ice cream shop. Ferran sat three rows down directly across from the Old Soul.

"Vanilla and Butter Pecan," the man behind the counter said. I skipped over to get it. I never skip. I know it was suspicious but my mind was jumbled and I thought it was more suspicious to stop, so I skipped to the Old Soul. It all felt like slow motion. Like I was wading in the water on a raft going up and down, up and down, and I was wading closer and closer to a shark and I had to pretend like it was normal, despite my shaking stomach, despite the world bouncing. Eventually, the world went still when I sat and I slid the Old Soul her ice cream.

"Aren't you in a good mood!" she mocked.

"I'm just happy to have ice cream with my favorite woman," I countered.

"Uh-huh," she said and then took a big scoop of ice cream. She swallowed. It was over. Done. I did my job. I would miss her. It should only take one bite for the poison to kill her. She took a big break to sigh.

"What's wrong?" I asked.

 "I'm just relieved it's only poison," she said. “And do you know what’s funny. I knew you knew so I was going back home right after this.” She leaped up and slammed her cane on the ground. She disappeared.

"Weapons out!" Ferran shouted. The clicks of guns whipped through the near silence of the room beforehand. "She can teleport with her cane!" Ferran yelled again. "Keep your heads on a swivel!"

Sorry, but I'll pass out before I'm able to go into too much detail. So I will say it was um, like finger painting.

Finger painting. 

Yes, finger painting would be the best analogy for what the Old Soul did. When a child finger paints, they put their hands in and out of whatever color they want as they, please. They'll leave the project and come back whenever to make big splashes of color that go everywhere. The Old Soul left and returned each time to make someone a bloody red or gutsy green that sprayed everywhere by using her wicked cane. Like a child, she got a lot done in a little time.

*Splish, splash, red blood, and green gas flowed.* 

Slip.

Bodies fell and slid, searching for safety and vengeance. Blood's metallic scent flattened the ice cream's magical smell. A white bone flew past me. I wasn't scared, I was only an observer. Something in me knew she wouldn't hurt me. Bullets beat against everything. Windows, chairs, tables, people, but none could beat her. None could touch her. One gun slid toward me and would have gone past if not for the pile of blood by my feet. I raised it and walked toward her.

Only myself, the Old Soul, and Ferran lived. Ferran survived by playing dead. The Old Soul tested her by crushing her legs with her cane, they cracked and bent sideways. However, Ferran was a paraplegic. She felt no pain in her legs.

Her cane was on the other side of the room.

"Now, sweetheart, what are you doing with that gun?" she asked, as sweet as marshmallow, and covered in every color the human body contains.

"Sweetheart," she warned. "Stay where you are. Guns are dangerous."

"Molly…" she eyed me with malice.

I placed the gun on her forehead.

"Molly, get that gun out of my face," she spat at me.

I had her dead to rights. I couldn't kill her though. I had one question to ask her first.

"Why did you let me live?" I asked her.

 "Because you're a slut," she said with a smile dripped with arogance. 

"Wh-what?" 

"You invited men in here to fix that little hole in your heart that your first daddy made because he had the Midas touch." 

"Mom, that's not nice," I had I called her mom but I was so crushed. I was reverting to a child before her eyes.

"You're right, it's not nice it’s funny. Everyone uses you for your body. I know about orphanages, I know about foster care. How many dads and brothers did you tempt?"

"I didn't tempt anyone!" I swear to you, reader! I really didn’t! I was assaulted by one of my foster mom’s husband and she didn’t believe me! I swear to you!

"The mothers think you're a liar and I think you're a liar. I know you have nightmares of them. Your yellow-stained sheets don't reek of lemonade. At your age too? What trauma? That's why you can't stop bringing men over. You need someone to hold you and tell you it's okay. You wanted to 'reclaim your body' and I wanted access to men and boys who snuck out and covered their tracks so they couldn't be found."

"No, no way! They're all dead?"

"Sweetheart, you think those men in your DMs found you by accident. Aww, baby. Your mother was pimping you out."

She imitated me. It was my voice and close to perfection. "Why wouldn't he text me back? He was so nice and we had a great time."

She broke her mocking tone and screeched out a laugh. "Because I killed them, stupid! I killed them and put them on my sweater!" she cackled. "And now, because some woman told you, you're going to be a killer. Does your body feel reclaimed yet? Good luck with a whole new batch of nightmares starring the face of yours truly."

"Molly, I want you to put the gun down and walk away," Ferran said breaking her attempt to play dead.

"No, I can-."

"Yep, you can," Ferran said. "But I've killed a man and she's right. You're bound forever to the first person you kill. If you kill her right here, she'll never die in your head."

"I can do it. This is what she wants. She wants us to let her go."

"Guilty," the Old Soul said.

"Yeah, but it's about what you want. You don't want to see her face in your nightmares. You want to watch Disney Channel. You want to sit down for family dinners. You want a mother. I saw that and tried to take advantage of it. I'm sorry. Let her live. Let her own universe take care of her."

"I can do it!"

"But you don't want to. Drop the gun and walk away. She'll find her cane eventually and then she'll leave. That'll be the end."

And that is what happened. I let her go and the Old Soul did leave our world.

In my world, things got better.  I'm adopted now. Turns out Ferran felt it would be a better use of her life to be a better mom again than to just end it. Even though the Old Soul is gone, Ferran and I aren't done. There are plenty of people out there being taken advantage of by evil adults, natural and supernatural. We'll be stopping them both. As for the Old Soul, I'll let those of her world stop her.

Oh, and as for my friend, Vicky, whom I mentioned earlier—the one I thought ditched me once I moved. Turns out she actually passed away, which is heartbreaking. I was mad at a ghost. But you know what? I was grateful I chose to be her friend. I was so grateful that we got to spend time together. I think that's an underrated reward of goodness or whatever. I get to look back on my time with Vicky, and I can smile. If this reaches heaven, Vicky, just know I loved you and I'd choose you all over [again](https://www.reddit.com/r/Finchink/comments/1enal35/what_happened_to_the_old_soul/).
