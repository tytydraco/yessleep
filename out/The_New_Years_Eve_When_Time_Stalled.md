Experts described what happened in Caribou, Maine on New Year’s Eve as a case of mass hysteria. That somehow more than seven thousand people had simultaneously taken leave of their senses. There was only one person the good people of the City of Caribou believed had lost their mind that day, a man named Vic Huntington. But more on that in a minute.

I am a woman of science, an undergraduate biologist and a psychologist by both PhD and profession. My background gives me a well-informed understanding of what mass hysteria is and is not. In psychological terms, what is known as mass psychogenic illness is when a close group of people develop some physical illness when no organic or pathogenic cause can be found. 

The earliest examples were dancing manias during the Middle Ages when groups of people would dance for weeks on end often spitting, stripping, howling, or making obscene gestures as they did. Similar rude behaviors were also common in nunneries during this time period. In both cases, it was likely the groups were acting out against oppressive social norms and strict codes of conduct. Sometimes you just need to blow off steam and blame possession by spirits. 

I submit that mass hysteria is *not* an entire town experiencing the same event, no matter how strange or unexplainable. And that is what happened this particular New Year’s Eve. 

Vic Huntington is a much-loved member of our community. A high school physics teacher, mentor, a member of the Aroostook Family Services Board of Directors, a coordinator of multiple charity events. A person who lifts people up, knows the right things to do and say in almost every situation, and now a man with stage four lung cancer. Vic is strong, but he is tired. After fighting hard for six months, he decided to stop treatment. But to everyone’s astonishment, he claimed to have another plan. 

He began laying out his plan in the middle of December by speaking about it everywhere he could. Chamber of Commerce meetings, Rotary and Lion’s Clubs, book clubs, political groups, the library, street corners, anywhere he could draw an audience.

It was during this time that Vic’s closest friend Manny came to see me. “I am very concerned about Vic’s well-being,” Manny said during our visit. “Vic is convinced he can somehow stop the progression of the cancer and ultimately save his life by slowing or stopping time somehow. It’s pure madness.” 

“Vic is an optimistic man. It may be that he is having a bit of trouble moving off the denial phase of his grief,” I offered. 

“I’m not so sure. All his friends are beginning to think he may need to be in a hospital. His doctor says there’s no physical reason to put him into care right now, but we all remain concerned about his mental health. Have you seen one of his lectures? I think we need to disrupt his plans.” 

“I have not had the pleasure of hearing one of his presentations yet, but here’s what I can do for Vic. I’ll attend his lecture tonight and see if I can detect any significant signs that might indicate a need for intervention. We’re usually looking for signs that someone is at risk of harming themselves or others. Of course, if he’s depressed or grieving, I can always suggest setting up some sessions as opposed to a major intervention. In the meantime, just try to be there for him. Let him know he can call you anytime day or night if he needs something or is feeling overwhelmed.” 

“Fair enough. Prepare yourself though, it’s really weird.” 

I entered the high school gymnasium with no particular expectations. Another twenty or so people were also there, some already snickering amongst themselves. Vic took the stage and stood in front of a portable white board, a set of fresh dry erase markers resting in the tray. A microphone was clipped to his baggy t-shirt. His clothes hung on his body, his frail form slowly disappearing into them, a result of his cancer treatments and failure to thrive. 

“Thank you everyone for coming tonight. My motivation for giving these lectures is to make sure everyone is aware of what I’m planning to do on New Year’s Eve as it may impact all of you.” 

Vic took a deep breath and a moment to survey the assembled. He gave a nod of greeting in my direction. 

“Let me begin with a little background.” He drew five stacked, parallel lines on the whiteboard with a stick person beneath them. “One theory of time is that all time in any given place exists it a series of layers. All events are present, just in different planes of existence. Theoretically, an individual could use certain sound frequencies or other devices to disrupt the borders of these planes and travel through time.” 

Vic drew an arrow from the top of the stick person’s head up through the parallel lines.

“A second theory, and one I tend to subscribe to, is that time is more like a perpetually expanding oval that never quite joins together.” 

He drew an oval with a gap in the middle of the bottom portion to show where the lines didn’t meet. 

“Imagine if you will,” Vic placed his marker on the point to the right of the gap, “this is the beginning of time. Creation or the big bang, depending on your philosophy.” 

Tracing the oval all the way around he stopped at the left point of the gap. 

“And this point is the present, this exact moment in time. We are moving forward along this portion of the oval’s line, but you notice the present and the beginning never meet. That is because, like our universe, time is constantly expanding. As we move forward in time, the oval gets bigger so we remain at this exact relative point in the continuum of time in perpetuity.” 

There was a pause as Vic looked for signs that his audience understood. Some heads were nodding, other listeners were squinting, and a few people whispered to one another. 

“As you all know, I am dying of cancer. However, it has occurred to me that if my theory of time is correct, it may be possible to stop it. To prevent the growth of time and allow us to remain where we are. None of us will get sicker or die, we will all stay as we currently are in this particular moment in time.” 

Someone expelled a sharp, “Ha!”. 

I looked down at the cast on my arm. Presumably this also meant the wrist I broke skiing the previous weekend would never heal. It would have been nice if Vic could have stopped time before I had to live for eternity with a busted appendage. 

Vic went on quickly before he lost his audience to doubt. “I have developed a machine that I believe will be capable of producing the right vibrations and tones at the correct frequencies to stop the expansion of time. If I am successful, it will likely impact the entire town. I’m sure you have some questions.” 

A hand shot up. The man did not wait to be called upon. 

“Let’s pretend your machine actually does something. What stops us from dropping into the gap or meeting up with the beginning of time. I’d hate to wake up New Year’s Day in the middle of The Creation.” 

“Let me assure you, if you arrived at The Creation, you would not exist yet so you would not have to worry about waking up there.” There were titters from the audience. “But seriously, if time is stopped the line won’t move forward making it impossible to close the oval. As for dropping into the gap, the risk is not zero, but since it is nothing but a void, I suspect there is really nowhere to drop into.” 

A man of advanced years who had been listening intently spoke up, “You said this would impact the whole town. Why just the town? What about the rest of the world?” 

“An excellent question. My theory is that the rest of the world will continue on but as long as the machine is active, we shall remain in the same time. You see the range of the machine to project its impulses is limited. My estimates indicate they would cover the entirety of Caribou and perhaps just a little beyond the city limits.” 

“You’ve lost your mind,” a man in a flannel shirt yelled as he led his wife out of the room. 

The next day Manny returned to my office. “Well, what do you think. Can we stop him?” 

I sat back in my chair, choosing my words carefully. “I’m not sure we should. This project, as foolish as it may be, is giving him hope. If we stop him, he will blame us for preventing him from living. I think the best course of action is to let him go through with it. Once he fails, it will be easier to reason with him and help Vic reach acceptance about his pending transition to the other side. Believe it or not, this is good for him. Though I realize it is painful to watch him go through this so publicly.” 

Four days later on New Year’s Eve at seven in the evening as planned by Vic Huntington, seventy-seven people showed up in the middle of town at the high school football field to watch his attempt to stop time. We stood on the field as a semi-truck pulling a flatbed trailer arrived and rolled onto the fifty-yard line. The machine took up about two-thirds of the trailer and a large fuel tank the remaining space. 

Vic used a step ladder to get himself up onto the flatbed where he connected the fuel line to his machine. The device itself was unremarkable, resembling a generator with a large, fan blade on one end. He said a few words to the gathered group of friends and supporters that no one could hear over the rumble of the semi-truck, which waited until after he spoke to cut the engine. 

With little fanfare, Vic, hair and clothes disheveled like the mad scientist he had become, began turning on the machine. It awakened with an ordinary mechanized whir. Flipping two switches initiated a vibration that shook the field making it difficult to stand. People were adjusting to a wide stance to steady themselves, a few grabbing the arm or shoulder of the person next to them. Manny turned his head in my direction and raised his eyebrows. 

It was as a series of hums and tones across different frequencies began to fill the air, rising to a deafening pitch, that everything changed. The air around us became disturbed, thickening with motion caused by the sound waves. It became difficult to move as though we were surrounded by wet sand. To the east, a wall of darkness began to form. Clouds were moving rapidly overhead, then there were stars in a night sky followed soon after by sunrise and the passing of another day. While I could see and hear, I could no longer move at all as time whooshed by overhead. 

In the east the emerging darkness had progressed to a wall of absolute black. A void where no light had ever entered. I wanted Vic to turn off the machine, but how could he? Like the rest of us he was immobile, stuck wobbling in this moment in time like a skipping record. 

A gust of wind came from the void in a howl and two smokey shapes began to emerge, floating overhead. More form than figure, the misty black vapor began to organize into a pair of winged, demon-like creatures with thick rear legs, rows of wispy spikes running the length of their pointed tails. Coming from the void where time didn’t exist made them immune to the concept. They used their wings to steady themselves as they seemed to be moving through the space by riding the sound waves that congealed the air. 

Initially the beasts moved toward one another, stopping short before rearing up on their hind legs, dipping their heads from side to side as if looking at each other. The existence of the other seemed to surprise them. Then one peeled off dipping downward, riding the soundwaves toward the rapidly oscillating people on the ground like it was descending a flight of stairs. Once nearer the crowd, the figure began riding the gentle rollercoaster waves close to the heads of those gathered as the other figure continued to hover above. 

Following its third pass over our heads, the beast reached out it’s taloned rear claws and snatched Mrs. Westphal off the ground. The demon didn’t grasp her so much as guide her through the airwaves. It began to play with her vibrating, paralyzed body much like a cat would toss a toy into the air before batting it around on the floor. The second beast descended, scooping up a man I didn’t know, and began the same game of slow-motion play, the bodies remaining aloft in the concentrated air. This same demon figure then found itself caught in a loop of air. It drifted toward the first beast who lurched out at it, defending Mrs. Westphal as its own human toy. The first beast pushed Mrs. Westphal upward and the smokey figures began to swirl in a battle for control. Mrs. Westphal began to slowly descend and the second beast pulled her toward it, the first giving chase before managing to regain control of the woman by using its wings to vigorously pull the air in its direction. 

The unstable air it had created caused the beast and Mrs. Westphal to descend rapidly in a yin and yang-style spin as the second beast began pushing its man nearer the edge of the void. As they approached the ground, the first beast attempted to put on the breaks by thrusting its powerful legs out in Mrs. Westphal’s direction. This move allowed the beast to regain control of its flight while at the same time repelling Mrs. Westphal, who slammed into the fan of Vic’s machine. 

Two fan blades bent and the machine began to rock violently. The beast joined the other near the void, both hovering as they watched events unfold. As the machine began to falter, the air currents wavered, tossing the beasts and still aloft man violently up and down. The machine sputtered and a sucking sound was rising. I was able to move my arms ever so slightly. 

The sucking sound grew louder as the smokey beasts began to dissolve back into the void. The man they had snatched from the ground was also caught up in whatever gravitational force was pulling the beasts into the void. With a loud pop, the man shot rapidly toward the void, hitting its edge as if it were a brick wall, causing his body to shatter and rain slowly down upon the ground. In that moment, as the machine’s fuel line separated from the tank, there was a powerful jolt as though someone had suddenly pulled their foot off the clutch and stalled the family car. The assembled were tossed roughly to the ground where they remained dazed and confused. A light breeze moved across the field. 

It was the Maine State Police who first arrived on the scene at the high school’s football stadium to find a group of stunned citizens, a machine in pieces, the body of Mrs. Westphal, and whatever was left of the man littering the field. They began taking statements, not believing a word any of us said. 

As an officer was taking my statement, the church bells chimed in the steeple across the street. The officer looked at his watch. 

“Clock’s a little slow.” 

I looked down at my phone before turning the screen toward the officer, “No, its eight o’clock on the dot.” 

The officer glanced at his smart watch before pulling out his phone. “My phone says its four minutes after eight.” 

I shuddered. “Everyone,” I shouted across the field, “look at what time your phone says.” We were all running four minutes slow. 

The preliminary report from the State Police listed what happened that night as a mass hysteria event caused by the stress of witnessing a double homicide. In other words, an entire city had lost touch with reality due to the murder of two townspeople. It was a story that made even less sense than ours. They had no clear murder suspect. 

While the incident convinced me to have Vic committed to the state psychiatric hospital, it ultimately wasn’t what we witnessed that haunted me. My psychiatrist mind couldn’t help but consider a different motive for a mass hysteria event, creating a nagging fear that I couldn’t trust my own experience. 

We were a close group of community individuals who came together to support a dying man. A man who wanted to live forever, whose loss would be painful in some way to every one of us on that field. People under stress due to Vic’s impending demise who truly wanted to break the rules of the universe and perhaps even God’s plan, our own mortality staring back at us from a flatbed trailer in the form of Vic. Was it possible that Vic’s machine somehow placed us in a hypnotic—or dare I say hysteric state—that allowed us to blame the stoppage of time for whatever actually happened on that field? Did a mass hysteria event paralyze us? 

Could it have been Vic who murdered those people and we needed to blame demons to protect our friend who had suffered enough? A friend none of us would ever have expected could do such a thing. Had someone in the group had the technical knowledge to know how to disrupt the time settings on our devices to make our mass psychogenic delusion seem even more real? 

Following the event, I bought a new phone that keeps proper time. Others who left the area claim their clocks reset to normal time once they left the city. As for me, I keep the old phone on a charger so I can look at it whenever the fear that I experienced a psychogenic illness wells up in me. The time on the phone I held that night remains four minutes behind. It allows me to reassure myself that the event actually happened as I remember it no matter how difficult it is to believe. I desperately need to remain unbroken.
