I didn’t even have time to run before they started walking toward me. That’s when it happened—


“Hello valued customer, how can I help you today?” 

I had seen enough horror movies to know that I was fucked. Thinking quickly as they approached me I turned around and went to pull on the door… which was no longer there. With my back literally against the wall I prepare for the worst, taking a defensive stance and really just hoping I can take some of these things down with me.

As the employees closed the gap between us I prepared for the worst, only to have the workers… or whatever the hell they are, stop and stare at me inches away from my face. Not sure of what to do, I froze. That is until a particularly gangly one of these creatures parted its way across the crowd and put its palm on my chest. Instinctively I backed away, only to be trapped by the wall behind me. The coldness of the touch combined with the spongy feel of this creature's skin contrasted strongly against just how gently he pressed his hand upon me, almost as if trying to feel something.

Whatever it was it was looking for I quickly found out that I did not have it, as I suddenly felt the thing’s hands wrap around my neck, with an amount of hostility that was not there moments prior. Lifting me up from the ground I clawed at its arms, my hands easily flaying the monster’s forearms, before those same forearms knit its skin back over itself. With black shadows beginning to dominate my vision I took one last look at my aggressor, hearing his hollow and disjointed voice speak almost as if it was echoing a message, rather than speaking on its own:

“You are not a valued customer. Goodbye.”

I awoke with a jolt, quickly sitting up and immediately panicking as I realized I did not know where I was. Whatever place this is, it's dark and cold and it stunk to all hell.

As my eyes began to adjust to the darkness however I saw that I was in some kind of prison, as I could see more cells across from me, some of them open while others were locked. 

As I stood there taking in my surroundings, it began to dawn on me how screwed I am. There was not a single person in the world that knew where I was, and even if there were people who were looking for me, how would they get to me?

Becoming more panicked I frantically started looking around the space I was in, hoping to find anything that could help me break out of here. It was immediately apparent that I was not the first person to be held here, as I looked upon a room with a lot of waste and blood everywhere, as well as a torn mattress on the floor. 

Lifting the mattress up I am surprised to find a big rock tucked underneath it, which considering my circumstances might come in handy sooner rather than later. Dropping the mattress with a thump I nearly jump out of my skin when I am suddenly addressed:

“Shhh!” The voice screeched.

“H-Hello?” I responded, apprehension and fear palpable in my voice.

“SHH!” It responded immediately, harsher than before. “Don’t make too much noise, the guard will come in if you do.” The voice continued barely above a whisper.

Whoever this was, the voice was distinctly human. Even though you could tell that through their voice they were tired and scared, it felt so good to hear the voice of another actual human being after so long. 

As risky as I knew it was to continue talking there were simply too many questions about on my mind, and to be honest I don’t know how long I’ll have the opportunity to talk to someone or if I’ll see anyone else at all, so I began:

“Where are we?” I asked, more resolute than before but matching the person’s hushed tone.

Silence.

“Hello? Can you just tell me that I really want to get out of here.” I said, hoping the desperation in my voice would motivate them to answer me.

“Please, can yo-”

STOMP STOMP STOMP

Thundering footsteps, fast and heavy made their way towards us. Fuck, whatever it was that was coming it definitely heard me. With terrifying dread taking over my body I heard a hard booming sound echo throughout the hallway our cells are in, and even though the person in the other cell didn’t react, we both understood what I had brought upon us. 

STOMP STOMP STOMP

With movements quick as lightning I saw the figure standing in front of my cell, its hulking size contrasting the tightly pulled skin on its body.

The Guard had come to punish me.
