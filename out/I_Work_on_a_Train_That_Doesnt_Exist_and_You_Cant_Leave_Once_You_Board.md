I collect tickets for a train most people can’t see. Some say it’s just a myth, others call it a ghost train, but I know the truth. The train is real, and it takes people who shouldn’t be taken.

I didn’t choose this job. I didn’t want it. I was seventeen, wandering a deserted station after missing the last train home. The fog rolled in thick and choking. Empty benches, empty tracks…until it arrived.

The train was black as a starless night. Its windows were mirrors, reflecting not who you were, but who you could become. The doors opened, and a voice called my name. I stepped in. That’s how I ended up here.



The Keeper and the Rule Book

When I first arrived, there was no uniform, no ticket scanner, no role. Just endless carriages and whispers that seemed to echo my fears. I tried to leave. I sprinted to the doors. They wouldn’t budge. I pulled at the windows. Cold, unyielding metal. Panic rising, I finally noticed a small, leather-bound book on a seat nearby.

It was titled Rules of the Train. I didn’t want to open it. I didn’t want to know. But the moment I did, the rules sank into my mind, as if they were already part of me. The train doesn’t allow ignorance. You either learn, or it teaches you permanently.

The book told me to never speak of the outside world. Break this, and you’ll vanish or worse, be forced to relive your regrets for eternity. I had to sit only in my assigned carriage because the carriages shift, and the wrong one can trap you forever. I had to collect every ticket because tickets are not paper—they are the essence of each traveler’s secret. And I must never look behind me when the lights flicker because curiosity has consequences.

I tried to escape. I ran down endless carriages, heart pounding, gripping the rule book. The train shifted under my feet. Doors vanished, walls grew taller. By the time I stopped, dizzy and gasping, a voice said, "You belong now. You are the collector."

And so, I became the keeper of the train.


Rules in Action

The train doesn’t just move—it watches, waits, and feeds. Travelers are different here.

Some appear normal at first. They board, carry a suitcase, fidget with their phones. But as the journey stretches on, the oddities show.

The Time-Lost look up from their seats, eyes glazed, whispering years-old memories they’ve never told anyone. One boy spoke of a sister he never had, yet the details were impossibly vivid. I had to collect his ticket while he stared into the void, trembling.

The Echoed repeat words not spoken aloud before, phrases that crawl in your head long after they leave the carriage. A woman muttered a name I hadn’t heard in twenty years—someone I thought forgotten.

The Still don’t breathe, don’t blink, just sit. Some never move, some vanish mid-journey, leaving only the faint smell of wet earth.

And then there are the anomalies, travelers who defy all rules. One man walked the carriages, eyes silver, muttering about “the gap between seconds.” He laughed at my warnings. When the train stopped at a station that didn’t exist, he stepped off. I ran after him. Gone. Fog swallowed him whole.



Haunting Encounters

Every day brings a new story. A child refuses to sleep, staring at the ceiling, recounting the way he died in a dream I know isn’t his. A woman has hands that drip water, even when the carriage is dry, muttering apologies to someone invisible. A man with his reflection wrong in the mirrors smiles at me with teeth I have never seen before.

I collect their tickets, each one heavier than the last, carrying whispers of fear and regret. Some try to hide. Some fight me. None escape.

The train teaches them, and me. Every flicker of the lights, every shift of the carriages, every sound—clack of wheels, whisper of wind—is a lesson in what it means to belong here.



The Eternal Journey

I sometimes dream of leaving. But the doors never open. The mist waits outside, patient. Inside, I am the collector, the keeper, the witness.

If you ever see a train that isn’t on any schedule, hear a whistle that doesn’t belong, or feel a chill when no chill should be…don’t look for the doors. Don’t try to touch them. Never ask for a ticket.

Because once you’re aboard, the journey never ends.
