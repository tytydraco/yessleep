I still remember that Halloween night like it was yesterday, even though it was the fall of 1998. I was thirteen, still young enough to trick-or-treat, but old enough to know it would probably be my last year. You know, that awkward age where you’re not a kid anymore but not quite ready to let go of the things you love? Yeah, I was right there.

My best friends, Josh and Ethan, and I had made plans weeks in advance. It wasn’t just about the candy; Halloween in our town was a huge deal. Streets would be packed with children, and parents partied while kids ruled the night, running through lawns with half-assed costumes causing mischief. The houses were decorated to the max, with fake spider webs stretching across porches, jack-o'-lanterns flickering orange on every step, and skeletons hanging from trees. And the air, it had that crisp bite, just cold enough to see your breath when you exhaled, but not so cold you needed more than a sweatshirt. You could smell the damp earth, fallen leaves, the chocolate, and a little something else, that scent of plastic from store-bought costumes. Man, it was perfect.

The three of us had met up at Josh’s house as soon as dusk started to creep in. His parents were hosting one of those Halloween parties for grown-ups, the kind where they hand out apple cider to the kids and spiked cider for themselves. We had on our last-minute costumes, nothing fancy. Ethan had thrown on a scream mask, Josh was a zombie, and I was wearing a cheap Batman cape with a black hoodie.

We hit the houses on our street first, just to get things going. The wind rustled the orange and yellow leaves at our feet as we walked, and you could hear them tumble along the pavement. The sun had just about disappeared, leaving behind this deep purple hue in the sky, the last light of day slowly fading away. Porch lights flicked on, and soon we were moving through the first wave of trick-or-treaters, those little kids with their parents holding pillowcases already stuffed with candy. The sounds of giggling, the wind blowing through the trees, the occasional shriek from someone who got spooked by a fake ghoul on someone’s lawn, it felt like Halloween in its purest form.

After a few blocks, we made our way to Franklin Street. Now, Franklin wasn’t like the other streets, it had the biggest houses, old Victorians that had been there for over a century. They always went all out for Halloween, each house trying to one-up the other with elaborate decorations and bowls filled with full-sized candy bars. All of the houses on Franklin Street looked like they came straight out of a Halloween movie. All except one, the Mallow house.

Everyone in town knew about the Mallow place. It was creepy all year round, not just Halloween. The house had been built sometime in the 1800s, three stories tall with an overgrown yard that looked like it hadn’t been mowed since before I was born. The owners, Mr. and Mrs. Mallow, were an older couple who never came outside. I think I saw Mr. Mallow once or twice picking up mail, but he was always gone before I could say hello.

As we got closer to Franklin, Josh nudged me. “Give you a handful of candy if you knock on the door at the Mallow place this year.”

I laughed it off. “Sike! And then what, get murdered?”

But deep down, I was feeling that familiar pull. The dare, the challenge. It wasn’t Halloween without doing something a little stupid, right?

We made our way down Franklin Street, along with all the other trick-or-treaters. There was a constant buzz of chatter and laughter as we joined the crowd moving slowly down the sidewalk. The Mallow house loomed ahead of us as we made our way closer to it, sitting completely dark. The gate at the front of the yard was open, the path leading up to the front porch covered in a layer of wet leaves. As usual, there were no decorations. No fake cobwebs, no plastic tombstones, no pumpkins. But it didn’t need scary decorations. The house was scary enough on its own.

I didn’t even have to say it aloud. We all knew it was next.

Josh and Ethan started slowing down as we got closer, and I could feel the shift in the air. The excited banter between us had faded to an awkward silence. It was that kind of house that no one really talked about, but everyone knew to just stay away. You always passed by a little quicker, maybe glanced at it out of the corner of your eye, but you never lingered. It wasn’t because it was haunted, there were no ghost stories. It was just… creepy.

People whispered about the Mallows, mostly rumors. Mr. Mallow was some kind of veteran, though no one was sure, and Mrs. Mallow was even more of a mystery. Some said she had dementia and was shut up in one of the upstairs rooms. Others swore she was dead. Either way, no one had seen her in years.

“I’m not going up there, they’re freakin’ weirdos!” Ethan said. He tried to sound casual, but I could hear the edge in his voice.

Josh kicked at the sidewalk, trying to act like he wasn’t bothered.

I glanced up at the house. A hulking Victorian with peeling paint, sagging roof, and windows that seemed too narrow, like they were squinting down at you. Every year, that house stood there, untouched by Halloween spirit, no pumpkins, no lights, nothing.

Josh, of course, wasn’t going to let it go. He had this thing about proving himself, especially if Ethan and I were around. That year, we’d spent most of our afternoons watching *Faces of Death* tapes in his basement, trying to outdo each other’s tolerance for gore. He’d never admit it, but this wasn’t about candy, it was about who would back down first.

He nudged me, a grin plastered on his face. “I’ll go if you go.”

My stomach knotted, but I wasn’t about to back down, not in front of them. “Fine,” I muttered, “but we’re in and out. We knock, get the candy, and leave.”

Ethan looked between us, clearly not thrilled, but he wasn’t about to be the only one to chicken out. “Let’s just make it quick,” he said. “I don’t wanna hang around this place.”

We crossed the street and made our way toward the Mallow house. The closer we got, the colder it seemed to get, as if the place had its own climate. I could feel the dampness in the air now, the earthy smell from the neglected garden mixed with the scent of old wood. Our footsteps crunched softly, and the sound seemed to disappear into the thick silence surrounding the house.

When we reached the gate, we paused. The iron bars were rusty, and the gate itself hung crooked on its hinges, like it hadn’t been opened in years. But tonight, it was ajar, just wide enough for us to slip through.

Josh, ever the brave one, was the first to step inside. The moment he crossed the threshold, the air seemed to thicken. I followed, feeling the weight of the atmosphere pressing down on me. Ethan brought up the rear, looking back over his shoulder every few seconds, as if expecting something, or someone, to jump out from behind the bushes.

The porch creaked under our weight as we climbed the steps. I could see the door now, a massive oak thing with a brass knocker shaped like a lion’s head. It looked ancient, the kind of thing that looked like it belonged in a museum. The windows were dark, covered with heavy curtains that looked like they hadn’t been opened in decades. I couldn’t shake the feeling that we were being watched from behind them.

I reached out and grabbed the knocker. I hesitated for a second, my hand hovering over the cold brass, before bringing it down with a loud *thunk*. The sound echoed through the house, hollow and unsettling.

We waited.

For a long moment, nothing happened. The wind picked up, rustling the leaves in the yard, but inside the house, there was only silence.

Josh shot us a look, trying to play it cool, but I could see the tension in his jaw. “Well” he whispered. “I guess no one’s home.”

Ethan turned to leave, “sorry guys, nope, peace out.” But before he could leave, we heard it. The faint creak of floorboards, like someone shifting their weight inside.

We froze. Another creak, closer this time. Then, the soft click of the lock being turned.

The door opened slowly, inch by inch, until it revealed a narrow gap. No light came from inside, just darkness so thick it felt like it could swallow us whole.

And then, a voice. Low, raspy.

“Come in.”

I glanced at Josh, expecting him to make some stupid joke and bolt, but his face had gone pale. Ethan took a step back, muttering under his breath. “Hell no, man. No way.”

But before any of us could move, the door opened wider.

Standing there in the doorway was Mr. Mallow. He looked even older than I expected, more skeletal. His skin was waxy, stretched tight over his bones, and his eyes... you couldn’t see them. They looked hollow, empty, shadows casted around them like two black holes. He didn’t smile, didn’t offer any kind of greeting, just stood there, staring at us.

His clothes were dirty, stained in patches I couldn’t identify, and his hands… his hands were covered in something dark, like oil. My stomach turned as I tried to make sense of it all.

“Trick… or treat,” Josh said weakly, his voice cracking.

Mr. Mallow’s gaze flicked down to Josh, then back to me, and finally to Ethan. His lips twitched, like he was trying to smile but had forgotten how. Slowly, he raised one hand, motioning for us to come inside.

“You boys are just in time,” he rasped. “We’ve been waiting.”

I felt something cold run down my spine. *We?*

Ethan stepped back again, his voice barely audible. “Let’s go. Now.”

But before we could move, something shifted in the shadows behind Mr. Mallow. I couldn’t see it at first, just the movement, something dark. Then, slowly, as my eyes adjusted, I began to make it out.

It was Mrs. Mallow. Or… what was left of her.

We stood frozen at the door; eyes locked on the sight before us. Mrs. Mallow was hunched over at the kitchen table, barely illuminated by the dim light. At first glance, she almost looked... normal. Just an old woman sitting down for a quiet meal, her thin hands resting limply on the table, as though she’d been waiting for someone, waiting for *us*.

But then I saw it. The way her body sagged, like something inside her was giving way, crumpling. Her head lolled to the side, neck bent at an impossible angle, and her body seemed to deflate, slumping lower as if gravity was pulling her apart, piece by piece. Her skin, pale and waxy under the faint light, clung loosely to her bones, too loose, sagging in folds as though her flesh was simply draped over a frame that was barely holding together.

She didn’t move at first, just sat there, her empty eyes staring at us. But then, there was this sound. It was low at first, a faint crinkling noise.

Mrs. Mallow began to shift. Slowly. Horribly. Her legs seemed to twitch, her knees jerking unnaturally beneath the table as her whole body started to fold in on itself, collapsing in slow motion. Her back arched, her spine pushing out against her thin skin, the bones grinding and popping as if they were breaking apart, rearranging themselves in ways they weren’t supposed to. She was twisting, contorting, her limbs bending into unnatural angles as her body crumpled lower and lower until she finally poured out of the chair, hitting the floor with a dull thud.

For a second, she didn’t move. Just lay there in a heap, her limbs splayed out, her chest heaving in shallow, rasping breaths. Then, slowly, horrifyingly, she began to crawl. Her hands slapped against the floor, too fast, too eager, like some twisted animal skittering across the ground. Her skin, that loose, sagging skin, dragged behind her as she moved, sticking to the floor in patches like it was melting off her bones.

She crawled on all fours, her body twitching with each movement, but her head, her head stayed locked on us. Those empty, hollow eyes fixed on us, unwavering, like she could *see* us even though there was nothing there behind them, nothing but blackness. Her mouth hung open, jaw unhinged, but instead of words, a wet, gurgling sound bubbled up from her throat, thick and choking. Like she was trying to speak, but something inside her was broken.

I couldn’t move. I couldn’t breathe. My legs were locked in place, my mind screaming at me to run, but my body just wouldn’t listen. She was getting closer, too fast, her hands slapping against the floor, her joints popping and grinding with every jerking movement. And her face. God, her *face*. It was rotting, decaying, skin peeling away from her cheeks in thick, wet strips, revealing the gray flesh beneath. The stench hit us then, thick and rancid, the unmistakable smell of something long dead, something that had been festering in the dark for far too long.

Josh let out a strangled gasp, his voice barely a whisper, and he grabbed at my sleeve. “Run! he said, his words trembling. “Now!”

But I couldn’t tear my eyes away from her. She was almost at the door now, her gnarled fingers reaching out toward us, clawing at the air, reaching out for us.

Suddenly, her body convulsed, her back arching violently as her whole frame shuddered. Then she collapsed again, her head hitting the floor with a sickening crack, but she didn’t stop. She kept coming, crawling, scraping, inching closer and closer.

Josh was the first to break. He shoved past us, bolting down the steps and back toward the street. Ethan and I were right behind him, not looking back, just running, running as fast as we could. I could hear the door creak shut behind us, but no footsteps followed. Just that horrible silence.

We didn’t stop until we were halfway down the block, gasping for breath, hearts pounding in our chests. I glanced back at the Mallow house, half-expecting to see them standing there, watching us, or worse, chasing us.

But the porch was empty. The door closed. 

We didn’t say anything for a long time. Just stood there, gulping down cold air, staring back at the Mallow house, expecting… *something*.

But nothing happened. The place was dark and silent again, like it had always been. I could still see the faint glimmer of that dim porch light, but otherwise, it was just another shadow on the street.

Ethan was the first to speak. His voice was hoarse, shaky. “What the hell was that? Did you see that? Was that… wha.. what was that?”

Josh didn’t answer. He was bent over, hands on his knees, still catching his breath. But I could see it in his face, he saw it too. He was more freaked out than I’d ever seen him. That cocky grin he always had was gone, replaced by the look of a scared child.

I swallowed, my mouth dry. My brain was still trying to catch up with what I’d seen. That... thing. That couldn’t have been her. Not really. No one’s body was supposed to look like that. The way she moved, the way she looked. The image was burned into my mind, and I felt vomit forming in my throat.

Josh straightened up, finally breaking the silence. “That wasn’t normal,” he said, his voice flat. “There’s no way that was normal.”

“What do we do?” Ethan asked, his eyes wide, darting between Josh and me. “We can’t just leave it like this. What if someone else goes there tonight? That wasn’t just some crazy old couple… that was.. ”

Josh cut him off, his voice hard. “We’re not doing anything. We’re going home, and we’re forgetting this ever happened.”

“Are you serious?” I blurted out. “We can’t just pretend we didn’t see that! What if something’s really wrong in there? What if they need help?”

Josh whipped around, glaring at me. “Did they look like they wanted help to you? That was messed up, man! I’m not going back there, and you shouldn’t either. It’s NOT our problem.”

I opened my mouth to argue, but the look in Josh’s eyes shut me up. He wasn’t being a tough guy anymore. He was scared. Really scared. And maybe he was right. What could we even do? Call the cops? Tell them what?

Ethan was biting his lip, his hands shaking. “Man, I just wanna go home. Let’s go.”

We started walking, fast at first, like we could outrun the memory of that house, of Mrs. Mallow’s twisted body. But it stuck with me, clinging to the back of my mind like a nightmare I couldn’t shake.

By the time we reached Josh’s place, the adrenaline had worn off, leaving us exhausted and rattled. We didn’t even bother to check the rest of our candy haul. The excitement of the night had soured, curdled into something darker, something we didn’t want to talk about.

Josh’s parents were still in the living room when we barged in, laughing with their friends, oblivious to what had just happened. For a second, the normalcy of it made me feel unhinged, like maybe we had imagined the whole thing. But I knew we hadn’t. I could still see the way Mrs. Mallow’s body moved, like a puppet with tangled strings.

“I’m going to bed,” Josh muttered, not even bothering to say goodnight. Ethan and I mumbled something in return, but no one was in the mood for conversation. We were all too busy replaying what had just happened, trying to make sense of it.

Ethan and I headed upstairs to Josh’s room, but neither of us bothered to change into pajamas or unpack our sleeping bags. We just laid there, staring at the ceiling. Every creak in the house, every groan of the floorboards made my heart jump. I kept picturing Mrs. Mallow’s face no, not her face, her *mask*. That’s what it looked like, a mask stretched too tight over something rotten underneath.

I couldn’t shake the feeling that she’d been watching us, not just looking at us, but really *seeing* us, like she’d marked us somehow. It was a stupid thought, but it stuck with me all night. I was terrified I’d wake up, and she’d be standing over me.

Eventually, I must have fallen asleep, but it wasn’t restful. My dreams were a mess of dark hallways, twisted bodies, and eyes, those hollow, empty eyes staring through me. When I woke up the next morning, my skin was slick with cold sweat, my heart still pounding.

We didn’t talk about the Mallow house the next day. Not really. Josh was quiet, distant, which wasn’t like him. He usually couldn’t stop running his mouth, but now he just mumbled answers, kept his eyes down, and didn’t crack a single joke.

Ethan left early, muttering something about having to help his dad with some yard work, but I knew he just wanted to be out of there. I didn’t blame him. The whole thing felt like we had stumbled into something humans weren’t supposed to see.

I left soon after, walking back to my house in the cold autumn sunlight, but the daylight didn’t help. The world felt quieter, heavier. I couldn’t get rid of the uneasy feeling sitting in my chest, like something bad was coming for me.

That night, I kept thinking about what Mr. Mallow had said. *“We’ve been waiting.”* Waiting for what? Why had they opened the door for us?

I tried to push the thoughts away, but they wouldn’t leave. Every shadow seemed a little too dark, every creak of the house a little too loud. I didn’t sleep well for days.

And then, about a week later, I heard the news.

Mr. and Mrs. Mallow were dead.

It wasn’t until the smell started leaking out of the house that the neighbors called someone to check on them. They found Mr. Mallow dead in his recliner. He had been dead for weeks. Bur Mrs. Mallow, they found her body upstairs, in a chair, rotting.

The coroner said she must’ve been dead for at least a year. Mr. Mallow had never told anyone.

But I saw her. I saw both of them. We all did. That night. I swear, we saw her moving, walking, staring at us with those dead eyes. I didn’t believe in ghosts, but I couldn’t explain what we saw.

Josh wouldn’t talk about it. Neither would Ethan. We all just went back to our lives, pretending like it hadn’t happened. But it stayed with us, lingering in the back of our minds, a memory we didn’t want but couldn’t shake.

The town boarded up the house, and left it to rot. No one wanted to buy it. No one even wanted to even get close enough to tear it down.

But every year, near Halloween, when the air turns cold and the leaves start to fall, I think about that night. About what we saw. About what really happened in that house. That sound… that wet crunch of her body as it hit the floor, it’s burned into my memory. I swear I can still hear it sometimes, like an echo in the back of my mind.

I had been right. That was in fact the last year I ever went trick-or-treating.
