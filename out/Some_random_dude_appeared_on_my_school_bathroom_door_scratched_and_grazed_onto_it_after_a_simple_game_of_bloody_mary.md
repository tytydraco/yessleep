So this is set when I was in grade 4, so quite a long time ago. Though it was quite memorable and a running joke, so I might as well share it.

My phase of loving witchcraft and horror was born here, which is what got me and my friends to do a simple and easy bloody mary in the school bathrooms. This school was established in 1870, so everyone had some scary stories about it. And not much of it was renovated. The old brick buildings from when it was first built were still there. 

There were about 5 of us, mostly some mutual friends. We did it when there was no one else and turned off the lights.

 There was a lot of paranoia, and I always ‘imagined’ things in the corner of my eyes. Like dashes of dark figures but then again I would always assume it’s my imagination. The mirror was very blurry, so we could only just see our reflections. We couldn't help but giggle and stay close to each other, just some little kids having fun. After we said the words needed; ‘Bloody mary, bloody mary, bloody mary.’ We ran straight out.

 One of us had been lagging behind a bit and almost had the door shut in their face, they yelped and screamed, valid. After we ran out, we stood a few feet in front of the door, reflecting on the situation and laughing. But the one that lagged behind was not laughing. Maybe from the fear? They looked genuinely scared.

‘Guys I swear I saw a shadowy figure at the end of the cubicles. I swear.’ She spoke, acting super scared. 

She looked really desperate, genuine. There was a lot of paranoia as I said, maybe just a trick of the mind, or maybe a joke. Either way, I didn't know what to believe. We were little kids so we always assumed it was true.

That totally changed once I looked back at the door. 

The shape of a human figure had been etched on the door with scratch marks. Like it had been scratched by a sharp object. It was light, so only I was able to see it from my perspective, just in the right lighting and angle. It was at the very top of the door, about quarter size. Just a normal human silhouette shape. I was terrified.

I called for the others to stand where I was and look at the scratches. They all saw it too. Detailed in a way. You could tell where the folded ears were, though only an outline. It felt too perfect.

None of us remembered it being there prior to the game. We all grew up in that school and we were sure of it.

I remember on the very last day of primary school, I still saw it. Even after two years it was still there. I live very close to this school, sometimes going in to say hi to my old teachers. Every time I walk past that door, I still see the human figure, etched and always watching on the door.
