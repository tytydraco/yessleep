When I was a kid, my family went to a lot of garage sales. You find the coolest stuff—to a kid, anyway. Lava lamps, old joke books, cigar boxes—these things are treasures when you’re single digits.

One Saturday morning, I was wandering someone’s lawn of junk while my mom haggled over second-hand clothes. I usually looked for books, though I was still learning to read. I liked the way they smelled, liked the crisp type on the yellowing pages. Every one felt like a treasure chest, and you never knew what would be inside.

But what caught my eye that day wasn’t a book. Instead, I happened across an old, honest-to-God, ink ribbon typewriter.

My mom was skeptical when I tugged on her sleeve and pointed to the clunky machine, but I suppose my enthusiasm convinced her. After a few more minutes of haggling, we left with a box full of clothes, a scuffed pair of shoes, and the typewriter in tow.

I loved that thing. I spent hours typing away, giggling with glee every time the type guide slid home with a ding! Spelling wasn’t one of my strong suits, so what I produced was barely comprehensible, but it didn’t dampen my joy a bit.

Eventually, the ink ribbon ran out. I begged my mom to buy another, but she refused. Instead, the typewriter went into the closet, and eventually, I forgot about it.

My mother kept everything. “Packrat,” is what she used to call herself. I understand it—when you’re scraping by your whole life, you don’t want to get rid of something you might need one day.

But it means cleaning out a house takes a long time.

I didn’t find the typewriter until a few weeks in. It was sitting on the top shelf of the hall closet, nostalgic and neglected. Despite my recent grief, I smiled seeing it. There were good memories in this place, buried under the pain.

I took it down, and with it came a rain of pages. The typewriter had sat on top of a pile of paper, now scattered around my feet. Some of the pages were fresh as untouched snow. Others were yellowed and wrinkled. But—I discovered as I picked them up—they were all blank.

Shuffling them into line, I brought them to the kitchen for safekeeping. And there, under the old iron chandelier, I realized there were indentions.

Someone had written on them, but not in ink.

Curious, I dug around in the junk drawer until I found a pencil. Starting with the oldest page, I gently shaded over the indentations, revealing the hidden words.

They were disjointed, some letters and even whole words missing. But the jist of it remained.

My mouth went dry. I kept shading, revealing more messages, accumulated over years.  
*Lit le c nt thinks she s al that Who doe she think she  s struttin  around in that tiny sk rt like a whor*   
*Why did I ha e a kid It s only mad  my life wo se I can t go anywhe e or do any hing I wish she d never be n born*

In the end, I sat at the center of 53 papers, filled from end to end with hidden vitriol, finally revealed after 30 years.

I guess I never really knew my mother after all.
