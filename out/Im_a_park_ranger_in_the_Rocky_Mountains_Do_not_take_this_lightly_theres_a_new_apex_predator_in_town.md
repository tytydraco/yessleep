I've been a park ranger in the Rocky Mountains for nearly a decade now, and I've seen my fair share of strange and unsettling things, but nothing like...

Nothing like ***this.***

What I encountered on my last patrol, well, it still sends shivers down my spine.

It all started when I came across an unusual number of bear carcasses. Now, I'm used to seeing the occasional dead animal, but this was something different. It seemed like every few feet I walked, there was another. Some had been partially eaten, others were torn apart as if something had attacked them with intense ferocity. The smell was unbearable, and it seemed to get worse with each new discovery.

Despite the overwhelming sense of unease creeping over me, I pushed on, determined to find the cause of all this death. As I walked, the forest around me grew darker and eerier. The trees seemed to close in, and I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched.

It wasn't until I stumbled upon a small clearing that my worst fears were realized. In the center of the clearing stood a creature unlike any I had ever seen. It was hunched over, with pale, wrinkled skin, and sharp claws on foot-long fingers. It was humanoid, put its knuckles dragged along the ground, and it had black, dead eyes set deep within its hollow-looking eye sockets. It had a gigantic, fresh wound across its stomach, but something about it looked.... off.

Its eyes gleamed with a malevolent intelligence, and it emitted a low growl as it saw me. Fear gripped me, and I froze in place as the creature slowly approached me. My mind raced, trying to come up with a plan as to how I could escape.

Suddenly, the creature lunged at me, and I turned and fired two shots at it with my pistol, and ran as fast as I could. I heard its claws scraping the ground behind me, and I knew I had to keep moving if I wanted to survive.

I could hear the creature gaining on me, its growls growing louder and more threatening. My heart was pounding in my chest, and I felt like I was about to collapse from the exertion and terror.

Just as the creature was about to catch me, I stumbled upon an old abandoned cabin. Without thinking twice, I ran inside and slammed the door shut, locking it behind me. I was safe for the moment, but I knew that it was only a matter of time before the creature found a way inside. The cabin was dilapidated, with holes in the roof and walls. I could hear the creature snarling outside, trying to find a way in. I knew that I had to act fast if I wanted to survive.

I searched the cabin frantically, looking for anything else that could be used as a weapon. My heart sank as I realized that there was nothing but a rusted old axe in the corner of the room. I picked up the axe, my gun in the other, my hands shaking as I prepared to face the creature. I could hear it scratching at the door, trying to break through.

At some point, I heard it roar, before it moved very quickly, and suddenly, I couldn't hear it anymore. I waited for about five hours, standing still and listening for even the slightest sounds as I took a deep breath to steady myself and opened the door, ready to fight for my life.

But the sight that greeted me was nothing like I expected. The creature was gone, and in its place was a trail of viscera and gore. It seemed like the creature had disintegrated into a pile of rotting flesh and bone.

I was speechless, trying to comprehend what had just happened. Had I imagined the whole thing? But the stench of decay and the claw marks on the door were all too real.

I stumbled out of the cabin and made my way back to the ranger station, my mind reeling with what I had just witnessed. When I finally arrived, I was met with a team of forensic investigators and 'state police'. They had been tracking the unusual number of bear carcasses and had discovered a disturbing truth.

The creature I had encountered was found a little ways away from the cabin I had hidden out at, torn apart with its flesh strung out on the fucking treetops so messily it was barely recognizable.
