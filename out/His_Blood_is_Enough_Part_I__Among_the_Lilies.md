I never thought I'd work at a funeral home. But after months of sending out resumes and getting no callbacks, you take what you can get.



 **Office Assistant Needed. Quiet Environment. Immediate Hire.**



 No salary, no details—I could feel the desperation. It screamed “sketchy,” but I was burnt out. After hundreds of applications, I needed a job, any job. As long as it wasn’t a scam or something worse, I could make it work. Still, I didn’t expect to hear back.



 I applied, not expecting anything to come from it. It had been months since I got fired, and unemployment was running dry. 



 I hadn’t told anyone—not my parents, not my friends. My landlord had been giving me extensions on rent, but I could tell his patience was running thin. I was ashamed, and I couldn’t stomach the idea of moving back home. 

🖤🖤🖤

When I arrived at Halloway Funeral Home for my interview, the scent of lilies hit me as soon as I stepped through the door, thick and overwhelming. My nose wrinkled. I hate lilies, I thought. They smell like the dead. But of course, it did—it was a funeral home. If I got the job, I’d better get used to it.



 The funeral home stood alone, its weathered brick façade blending into the overgrown cemetery beside it. Crooked headstones poked out from the tall grass, leaning awkwardly—slowly sinking into the earth. It was clear no one had come to visit in decades. No flowers, no offerings of memory or respect. Nobody checked on the graves, but that was life—people moved, died, and forgot.

 

The chipped stone walls of the funeral home felt oppressive from the outside, but as I stepped inside, the atmosphere shifted. Despite the worn-down interior—the peeling wallpaper, faded rugs, and dust clinging to every corner—there was something oddly comforting about it. The dim, flickering lights barely illuminated the space, but the warm glow of mismatched lamps created a sense of familiarity. It felt lived-in, like a well-worn sweater, frayed at the edges but still warm and familiar. With a little attention and care, it could easily regain some of its former charm.

 

In the adjacent room, the viewing room held onto that same strange comfort. Its pews were dusty but neatly arranged, and the soft glow from small lamps on either side of the room cast a muted warmth. A closed coffin sat at the front, surrounded by lilies, their thick, sickly-sweet scent filling the air and making my eyes water. The coffin made me uneasy, but like the lilies, I’d better get used to them fast.

 

 

Jared Halloway, the funeral director, greeted me at the front desk. He looked to be around forty, his appearance just as worn as the building itself—shirt half-tucked, tie hanging loosely around his neck. Despite his disheveled look, there was a warmth to him, a quiet familiarity that mirrored the comforting, lived-in feel of the funeral home. His eyes briefly flicked to the coffin I’d been staring at before settling back on me.

 

He smiled, trying to put me at ease.

“Don’t worry. We don’t bite. Well, at least I don’t. The ones in the coffins, though… they’ve been known to get a bit restless.”

 

I couldn’t help but laugh at that—it was such a dad joke. 

 

Jared grinned again. “Sorry, I have a 5- and 3-year-old,” he said, and you could hear the love for his kids in his voice, softening the darkness of his humor just a little.

 

“And well, you have to have some twisted humor surrounded by this,” he gestured towards the viewing room. His eyes grew dark, and he looked even more tired.

 

He shook his head as though banishing whatever thoughts he had. 

 

“I’m sorry,” he apologized, “I’m exhausted. Along with my two monkeys, my wife is pregnant again, and since our old assistant quit, well…” He trailed off. “Well, come on back to the office, Nina, and we can chat.”

 

🖤🖤🖤

I followed him to his office, which was a mess. Papers were scattered across the floor and piled high on the desk as though the weight of the funeral home’s operations had been hastily dropped.

 The smell of old paper lingered in the air, adding to the sense of age and neglect. Despite the disarray, the personal touches made the space feel lived-in. 

 Framed pictures of Jared’s family sat on his desk and hung on the walls. 

 There was a photo of a young boy grinning with his front two teeth missing and a little girl with blonde pigtails laughing beside him. 

Jared was smiling broadly, one arm around his children and a hand resting lovingly on his wife’s round belly, who was beautiful and laughing, eyes closed.

 “That’s Ethan and that's Iris,” he said, pointing to the picture he was beaming.

 “And that beautiful woman is my wife, Elise.”

 

He noticed me looking at the rest of the pictures.

 

“That’s my mom, she’s a beauty, right?” He said, pointing to the picture of the woman with the kind eyes. “I get it from her, obviously.” He chuckled, but his laugh trailed off as his gaze shifted to the picture of him and his father. The change in his mood was instant, a shadow falling over his face. 

 

And that’s Dad—Silas,” Jared said, his voice dropping. His eyes flicked toward the hallway, then back to me. “You’ll meet him eventually. He… keeps to himself. Spends most of his time in the mortician’s room. He was supposed to interview you as well, but…” Jared’s voice took on a sharper edge, his smile tightening. He glanced down the hallway again, then back at me, shaking his head slightly. “Guess he had other things to do.”

 

As he spoke, a faint thud echoed from down the hallway, followed by a distant bang. My head jerked towards the sound, but Jared didn’t seem to react. A faint buzzing, like a saw starting up, hummed through the silence.

 

“He prefers the dead?” I offered, trying to lighten the mood.

 

Jared laughed. “Right, yeah. I think you’ll be a good fit here, Nina.”

 

Yeees, I thought silently, trying not to show my excitement, which was hard.

 

🖤🖤🖤

 

The interview went as expected.Jared asked the usual boring  interview questions, such as:

“Have you worked in an office before?” and “How comfortable are you with answering phones?” but some questions were… more unique:

 

“How do you feel about being around the deceased?”

 

The question hung in the air, and I swallowed, trying not to think too hard about it. “I think I’ll manage,” I said, my voice steadier than I felt.

 

“Can you handle being alone here after hours?”

 

Alone? Here? My skin prickled, but I nodded. “Yes, I think so.”

 

“What would you do if something in the funeral home made you uncomfortable?”

 

I hesitated. “Depends on what it is, I guess,” I said, managing a weak smile.

 

“Are you squeamish at the sight of a body?”

 

“No,” I lied, though the thought of an open casket still made my stomach twist.

 

“How would you react to people in extreme distress from grief?”

 

This one gave me pause. “I’d try to stay calm and help them through it,” I said, though I could already imagine the weight of other people’s grief pressing down on me.

 

 

The overall functions of the job were simple enough—answering phones, handling scheduling, filing paperwork. My mouth dropped open when he told me the pay rate. It was way more than I had made at my previous job, and hope fluttered in my stomach.

 

“Does that work for you?” Jared asked, looking down as he adjusted some paperwork. “I know it’s not a lot, but you get yearly raises.”

 

“Are you serious?” I blurted, unable to stop myself. “That’s twice as much as I made at my old job!”

 

I clapped my hand over my mouth, cheeks flushing with embarrassment at my outburst, but Jared just chuckled. 

 

“Okay, well, you’re hired,” Jared said, grinning. “. You’ll fit in just fine, Nina. And well, we are in a bit of a bind right now with Luella just up and quitting. So, let’s go. Let me give you a tour of the place.”

 

My stomach flipped. This was it—I had the job. Relief. Excitement. But something wasn’t right. Everything was moving too fast, too easily. A flicker of doubt crept in, making my skin prickle. I forced a smile, telling myself to shake it off. Don’t think about it. Just follow him.

 

Jared led me back to the front and gestured to the reception area. The large mahogany desk was cluttered with paperwork and old files stacked precariously on every surface. “This is where you’ll be working most of the time,” he said, gesturing toward a small desk by the window. “You’ll greet people, handle phone calls, schedule, paperwork—basic boring admin stuff. Nothing too crazy.”

 

I nodded, my eyes scanning the room. It looked as if the woman who worked here had left in a rush. An open tube of lipstick lay abandoned on the desk,  a half-empty coffee cup sat forgotten, and a jacket was slung over the back of a chair as though someone had just stepped out but planned to return any minute.

 

Everything felt… unfinished, like whoever had been here left suddenly.

 

“This way,” Jared said, guiding me toward another room. As soon as we entered, the heavy scent of lilies hit me again, and I realized this must be the viewing room. The soft glow from the lamps created a muted warmth, and the room, though simple, had an almost comforting feel.

 

“This is the heart of the place,” Jared explained, his voice taking on a more serious tone. “You’ll sometimes help out here—arranging flowers, making sure the tissues are stocked, keeping things neat.”

 

He smiled. “You don’t have to worry about the bodies, though. Leave that to us, the professionals.”

 

I laughed nervously. The closed coffin at the front of the room caught my eye, sending a small shiver through me. I quickly looked away, not wanting to let my unease show.

 

As we left the viewing room, the floorboards groaned underfoot, and a sudden draft chilled the back of my neck as if something had brushed past me. I whipped my head around but saw nothing, only the soft glow of the lamps and the lingering scent of lilies. My stomach clenched as I tried to shake the feeling of being watched.

 

Jared continued the tour, walking down a narrow hallway lined with dimly lit portraits of solemn faces. “This is the arrangement room,” he said, opening another door. Inside, an old wooden table sat in the middle, surrounded by chairs. Brochures for caskets and urns were fanned out across the surface.

 

“You probably won’t spend too much time here unless I need help organizing stuff or setting things up for families,” he said, his tone light but distracted, as if his mind was elsewhere. I noticed his eyes flicker toward the corners of the room, almost as if expecting to see someone.

 

“Okay,” I muttered, feeling the heavy air pressing in around me. I glanced over my shoulder again, the shadows in the hallway seeming to shift, just for a moment. Something was wrong, but I couldn’t put my finger on it.

 

We moved on to the storage room, cluttered with supplies—more files, cleaning materials, and stacks of unopened boxes. Jared gestured absently. “This is where we keep any extra supplies. If you ever need anything, it’ll be here.”

 

I barely listened. The hairs on the back of my neck were still standing on end. I was sure someone had been watching us.

 

Jared’s voice broke the eerie silence. “This way,” he said, his voice dropping slightly lower, guiding me toward another door. “The garage is through here. It’s where we keep the hearse. Yeehaw!” He chuckled. “Sorry, my kids call the hearse a horse. Another dad joke—better get used to them.”

 

I found myself smiling. He clearly adored his kids. He was a good father.

 

I told him so, and he laughed again, slightly embarrassed. “Yeah, they’re my world. I’d do anything for them.”

 

We reached another room, larger and dimly lit, with cold steel tables and cabinets along the walls. Jared’s voice grew quieter, more serious. “This is the prep room. The embalming and everything happens here. You’ll never have to come in unless…well, you’ll probably never have to come in.”

 

He hesitated momentarily, glancing at me before adding, “And that back there is the cremation room.” He pointed toward a large, scratched door at the end of the hall, its edges darkened from years of wear.

 

“You won’t be going in there either,” he said, his voice soft, almost reluctant. “But I just want you to know the full layout of the place.”

 

I swallowed hard, my eyes darting around the sterile space. A shadow flickered at the edge of my vision, but when I turned my head, it was gone. My chest tightened, and a shiver ran down my spine.

 

Jared stared at the door so long that it made me uncomfortable. The seconds dragged on, the silence pressing in like a weight. I shifted on my feet, waiting for him to say something. Just as I opened my mouth, Jared blinked, snapping out of whatever trance had taken hold.

 

He cleared his throat awkwardly. “Okay, that’s the end of the tour. Now, I can officially welcome you to Hawthorne Funeral. Congratulations,” he said with a smile that didn’t quite reach his eyes. 

He turned to me, eyes strangely bright. “So, when can you start?”

 

“Is tomorrow okay?” I asked, trying to keep my excitement in check.

 

“Perfect,” Jared said with a grin. “Let’s get the paperwork sorted, and I’ll train you first thing in the morning. Let’s say 7? Before it gets rowdy in here.” He chuckled at his joke.

 

My heart skipped a beat. “Yeah! Sure, thank you so much,” I said, my voice bright with excitement. This was exactly what I needed—a fresh start. But as Jared turned and started walking down the hallway, whistling a low, casual tune, that excitement began to dim like a candle flickering in the wind. The uneasy feeling from earlier crept back in, heavier this time.

 

I followed him, but the sensation of being watched clung to me. The shadows along the hallway felt darker, more alive. Instinctively, I glanced over my shoulder—and froze.

 

The door to the embalming room was cracked open. At first, it seemed like nothing, just a sliver of darkness. But then, my breath caught in my throat. Through the gap, I saw a face. A man with wild white hair tumbling to his shoulders, his pale, lifeless eyes locked onto mine. His expression was completely blank, emotionless, as though there was no thought or feeling behind those dead eyes—just a cold, hollow stare.

 

Silas. The man from the picture in Jared’s office. Co-owner of the funeral home. Jared’s father.

 

I blinked, my heart hammering in my chest, and when I looked again, the door was closed.
