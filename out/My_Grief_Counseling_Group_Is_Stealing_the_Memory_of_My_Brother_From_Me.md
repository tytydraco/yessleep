I know this is going to sound insane, but I swear I’m not paranoid — please, just listen.

I wasn’t going to post again. Not because I didn’t want to, but because I hoped the first session was just a weird coincidence.

After my younger brother Eli died in a car accident, my parents forced me into grief counseling. I expected stale coffee and awkward silences.

Instead, strangers described things about Eli that no one else could’ve known.

A green hoodie with a torn elbow pulled from the wreckage, orange popsicles he called “sun sticks,” and “All Apologies” by Nirvana, the song he used to play on repeat.

They spoke as if they were talking about their own dead brothers.

I panicked and deleted my post a few hours later, convinced that it was my brain trying to find patterns in my grief when there were none.

Just before I took it down, though, I added something — a memory Eli never had.

I made it up to prove I wasn’t losing my mind. To prove there was still one memory of my brother that belonged only to me.

I’ve been back to the group several times since then. Most of those sessions were uneventful — at least, nothing I could pin down as sinister.

But I went back tonight and I didn’t think it was about grief anymore.



I got there early, hoping to get ahead of the grief spiraling in my brain.

Jean’s gray-streaked bob stayed perfectly still as she watched me enter from her seat in the middle of the room, her notebook resting in her lap.

“Good to see you again, Lucas.”

I didn’t smile back, just gave a quick nod and avoided her sharp, green eyes.

I sat in the same uncomfortable plastic chair as last time as I watched Mark, Greg, Lillian, Jonah, and another person I hadn’t seen before shuffle in and take their seats.

I tried to remember what was said about Eli’s popsicle obsession, but it kept slipping away.

Had I mentioned the hoodie? I didn’t think so.

I’d done my best to tell myself that I was just suffering from a hyperactive imagination because after all, there was comfort in the panic, right?

My eyes landed on the rabbit-shaped coffee stain on the floor — darker now, like something was pushing up from beneath the tile.

I blinked, but it stayed. A jagged crack ran through its liquid features like a scar.

I rubbed my eyes, the line had vanished, but the rabbit was back. 

“Some things leave their mark, don’t they?” I heard Jean’s voice, but I never saw her lips move. It was as if her voice was inside my head.

That was when my ears picked up on something in the distance — a soft, off-key humming.

The opening chords of “All Apologies” drifted through the room slowly, almost methodically. It was quiet enough for me to think that maybe I was imagining it, but it was there, and the humming was growing louder behind me.

I turned my head slowly, my heartbeat rivaling the sound of the music.

I noticed that Jonah was sitting in his chair, rocking slightly from side to side. His chapped lips were barely parted, and his eyes were half-shut behind his square framed glasses like he was halfway between sleep and trance, but it was unmistakable, the melody was coming from him.

I leaned forward in my chair slightly. “Hey… you okay?”

His eyes opened sharply as if he had just woken up to a morning alarm.

He gave a light chuckle before smiling faintly:

“Why so jumpy, Rabbit?”

I felt my blood turn to ice. I hadn’t told anybody that nickname, not one time.

How did he know?

“What did you just call me?”

His brow furrowed. 

“I didn’t say anything, man. You alright?”

I shook my head and dropped the conversation with Jonah. 

I knew what I had heard.

Everyone else sat still — left hands curled around their paper cups; elbows bent in eerie symmetry.

It felt rehearsed, like a ritual they’d practiced.

I didn’t feel scared exactly — just disconnected. My body was in the room but my mind was elsewhere entirely.

I hadn’t even said that nickname aloud since Eli died. That was his name for me — something only he ever called me because I would jump at the sound of anything.

But now, others knew it.

How?

“I am losing my mind.” I thought to myself as I twiddled my fingers, waiting for the session to begin.

Jean’s smile tightened like something crawled behind her teeth.

“No you’re not, dear.”

Had I spoken aloud and didn’t realize?

I blinked in confusion and was met a look from Jean that suggested that I had been staring for too long.

“Thanks.” I responded briefly as I did my best to calm my rattled self.

Eventually, Jean asked us to once again “share a memory” and this time, Lillian volunteered to go first.

Her fingers danced over the leather bracelet  on her left wrist in tight, practiced loops.

“He dotted his i’s with tiny bubble circles.”

My stomach lurched; Eli used to do that. His school assignments always appeared vandalized by balloons.

Jean nodded slowly.

“That’s a beautiful memory, Lillian. Thank you for sharing. That’s yours now.”

Why did she say it like that? Like she was giving it away.

There was no time to dwell on that as Greg went next. His knuckles were red from being rubbed raw — a habit he didn’t seem aware of.

“He avoided spaghetti at all costs because he thought the sauce smelled like pennies.”

When it was my turn, I opened my mouth... but nothing came out, not even a whisper.

I frantically searched my brain for something — anything — about Eli that hadn’t already been said. 

The harder I tried to remember, the faster it all evaporated — like breath on glass.

I could remember his face, but when I reached for the little things like his laugh or his habits, they slipped through my fingers.

“Come back to me.” I grunted, dismissing my turn so I could ponder everything further.

I received a stern look from Jean as she reluctantly made the new person introduce himself. 

He was pale, lanky, and nervous, with sandy hair sticking up at the crown of his head.

“I’m Shane,” he spoke softly. “My brother—Ben—he was hit by a drunk driver a few years ago.”

The silence sat for so long I wasn’t sure he was going to speak again, until he finally did.

“We used to build these massive Lego castles together. He’d always insist on putting the flag on the top because he said it wasn’t a ‘real fortress’ without the flag.”

“You don’t know him! Stop pretending you do!” 

The words ripped out of me before I realized  I’d sat up straighter in my chair. My throat burned with shame, but nobody looked surprised.

“Lucas, no speaking out of turn.” Jean tilted her head. “You don’t want to lose him again, do you, Rabbit?” 

“What did you just say?” My tone now turning combative.

“I was telling Mark to go ahead.”

“That’s definitely not what you said.” I grumbled with clenched fists, earning glares from the others.

Mark leaned forward in his seat; his eyes a little watery as he recounted his memory. 

“He had this real wide gap between his front teeth. I thought he looked like a rabbit because of it.”

My eyes widened as my head snapped towards the coffee stain on the floor, the one that resembled a rabbit.

Except, it wasn’t a rabbit anymore.

It was a devilish grin with two wide, stained teeth, shimmering like dampened ink across the tile.

I watched as the smile stretched and widened, it’s proportions growing with every second before it disappeared in the blink of an eye.

I shivered in my chair as I clutched myself tightly, the room seemingly dropping in temperature as I listened to Jonah speak.

“That dinosaur shirt. You remember the one? Yellow, raggedy thing with the little hole under the armpit? He wouldn’t take it off. He wore it everywhere he could..”

“Stop it,” I spoke through gritted teeth.

They didn’t listen, one by one they spoke Eli into the room — in fragments of hobbies, phrases, and inside jokes. 

Each detail carved into me like glass under the skin.

Then Lillian said something that made me shudder.

“He used to say clouds were made of cotton candy and dead dreams every time we drove past the old park.”

The words fell from her mouth like they’d always belonged to her.

But that was mine. That was the one thing Eli never said.

I felt sick, the world began to spin and tilt around me.

I reached into my backpack for my water — and my fingers brushed fabric.

Confused, I pulled it from my backpack.

It was Eli’s hoodie. 

It was torn at the elbow, the fabric was damp, faintly smelling of gasoline and scorched plastic. 

Someone had folded it neatly into my backpack. 

The dampness seeped into my palm as if it had been waiting for me in the wreck this whole time.

Inside the collar:

“To Rabbit – You’ll always be my player two.”

I remember Eli writing this on the inside of a birthday card he had given me once.

This was after we had spent hours, days, and weeks grinding different video games together. 

That was our memory, no one else knew that…right?

I glanced at Jean, half-expecting her to react. Instead, she was watching me, like she’d been waiting to see my face crumple at the sight of that ratty hoodie. 

She didn’t even blink as I stood up in anger.

“These aren’t your memories,” I declared, louder than I meant to. “You’re not talking about your brothers. You’re talking about mine.”

The room stood still, the only sound I could hear was my heartbeat, thudding in my chest.

But then, Jean’s expression shifted to reveal a smile that was wrong in every possible way.

“Lucas, I know this is hard for you, but don’t interrupt the process.”

Mark looked up at me with a slow, deliberate frown.

“Why are you so scared, Rabbit?”

“You’ve always been here.” Lillian chimed in, her eyes looking like they were going to protrude from their sockets.

The color drained from my face as words failed me.

They smiled in unison — not real smiles, but ones carved into their faces like wax figures left too long in the sun.

I took a step back, and that’s when the lights began to flicker.

Once…twice…until complete darkness.

I could only see their silhouettes faintly sitting in their chairs, like chess pieces that had never moved.

I went to leave when I heard the humming begin.

It started out low, but slowly crept to a crescendo as the sound of static crackled to life somewhere behind me.

The first, dissonant chords of “All Apologies” leaked out like rot through the community center. 

It was so distorted and warbled that it sounded like something dying was dragging itself across the room.

The voices started again except they weren’t speaking anymore.

They were mimicking and echoing Eli’s laugh…his voice…his humming.

One by one, I listened to his words leaving their mouths in the pitch black like they were chewing them up…and spitting them back at me.

I sat there trying to picture Eli’s face again, but for a moment, all I could see was the hoodie.

What kind of brother forgets that?

Greg’s head twitched in violent spasms, his neck bending at a sharp, almost impossible angle as he whispered:

“Sun sticks. You remember sun sticks?”

Jonah’s smile stretched almost past his nose. His eyes two flat pits of shadow.

“He said clouds were made of candy and dead dreams.”

I tripped backward over my chair, landing hard with a thud.

The coffee stain shimmered like pond water, rippling under the flickering emergency light.

It was grinning and I watched in horror as its teeth grew huge, and the stain seemingly took a life of its own.

The melody of the song looped repeatedly, bent and broken until it sounded like screeches of agony in reverse.

“Player two,” Lillian whispered, her voice trembling with excitement. “We saved the castle together. Remember?”

I heard joints cracking like tree branches in quick succession as something started crawling across the floor slowly.

Bones scraped across the tile as a labored wheeze thick with phlegm came closer to where I stood.

I turned to run but it grabbed my ankle, its grip firm but slippery like a hand covered in oil.

“I’ve fed on softer hearts than yours.” Jean’s voice echoed in my thoughts as I kicked hard and stumbled to my feet. 

I ran as fast as my feet could carry me until I slammed into the doorframe.

I fumbled with the lock in a frantic struggle. Then—lights exploded back on, and the music stopped.

The room had returned to normal — everyone was still in place, like chess pieces that never moved.

Jean sipped her coffee as she stared at the terrified expression on my face.

I didn’t say goodbye.

With my heart still racing, I grabbed my backpack and ran the whole way home without looking back once.



My mom asked about the session, but I didn’t dare tell her what I saw, not even a fraction of it.

I couldn’t even really put into words what I experienced.

All I told her was that it was fine and that I walked home because I needed the fresh air from how heavy it got today.

I went upstairs to my room and closed the door hopelessly gaslighting myself into thinking that a thin piece of wood could keep the horrors out.

All I could think about were those dying lights, the way their faces shifted, and a name I hadn’t heard in months being spoken again.

I dumped my backpack onto the bed, but the hoodie was gone.

I swore I had it — hadn’t I taken it out?

Then I saw it, folded neatly at the foot of my bed.

I knew I hadn’t brought it home; I would have remembered

I curled up on the bed, wiping at tears I didn’t remember shedding. The grief was still there, but I felt hollow — like my body was going through the motions without me.

All I kept repeating in my head was:

“He called me Rabbit.”

I don’t know how long I sat there in uninterrupted silence but the sound of my phone lowly buzzing in my pocket snapped me out of my thoughts.

I didn’t recognize the number and just let it go to voicemail.

If it is important, they will leave one.

But the number kept calling me, no matter how many times I silenced or blocked it.

In a moment that I would come to regret, I answered the phone on the seventh try.

First came the static — gnawing through the speaker angrily.

Then the warped twang of “All Apologies,” every note nauseatingly dragged out as if it were being played from a melted cassette tape. 

It sounded more like a funeral than a song.

I pressed the phone harder to my ear before I realized my hands were slick with sweat.

Underneath the layers of distortion, words manifested themselves.

“You shouldn’t have deleted me, Rabbit,” said a voice that almost sounded like Eli.

I whispered his name before the line clicked dead.

“No no no no no.” I repeated as I felt the phone drop from my hand to the bedroom floor. 

I knelt to pick up the phone, but my hand brushed something else.

There, on the floor beside my bed, was a popsicle stick.

“Sun stick,” written in messy, orange marker.

It was unmistakably Eli’s handwriting.

I didn’t know if I was shaking from fear or from the kind of cold that creeps inside when nothing makes sense anymore.

I crawled under my bed and pulled out an old box I had tucked away, I hadn’t touched it since the funeral.

Inside were pictures of crayon monsters with jagged teeth and drawing of our Lego fortress.

After a couple moments of quick searching through the contents of bittersweet nostalgia, I found the picture I was looking for.

It was Eli, he was around eight years old, and he was grinning wide with both front teeth missing, holding up a Lego castle with a tiny red flag.

I could hear his voice clear as day in my head:

“It’s not real without the flag.”

I felt myself choking back tears as I remembered begging him to play video games with me that day.

If only he had stayed home, he would still be my player two.

My chest stiffened with the memory of his laugh, that pure, careless joy. 

Maybe I’m the reason he’s gone, and that’s why I keep hearing him.

I ran my thumb over the photo, over Eli’s gap-toothed grin. Tears fell from my eyes.

I shut the box, the memories felt radioactive.

A dark thought crossed my mind: 

What if none of them are lying?

What if they’re not sharing stories?

What if they’re taking turns carving him out of me piece by piece?

The sun sticks, the castle, the damn fake memory?

It was the only explanation I had to rationalize the things I was seeing.

But if they can steal something that was never real…what exactly does that make them?

And worse, what does that make me?



It’s late at night.

I haven’t slept and I don’t think I honestly want to.

I heard my mom answer the phone downstairs earlier. 

Jean called to make sure I had made it home safely. 

Something else was said but mom wouldn’t tell me what. 

“It’ll all come back to you.” Is what she told me.

All I could picture was Jean’s smile — the one that always knew more than it said.

I’m not just losing Eli — I’m losing myself.

If anyone out there has ever heard of a grief group like this or anything even remotely similar, I must know.

I’m not sure if I should go back but I feel like the only way I’ll get answers is to keep going.

I’m scared I’ll forget his voice next.

If I forget him completely…did I ever really have a brother at all?

God, that sounds messed up. But I don’t know how else to say it.

I’ll update whenever I go back again.

I promise to stay safe and keep in touch with you all as much as I can.
