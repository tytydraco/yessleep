Part One – A Dollmaker’s Curse

I’ve always been obsessed with perfection.

It started when I was a child, with my first doll. I didn’t just want it to be a toy—I wanted it to be alive. I wanted it to feel something. I wanted to give it a soul. I wanted it to love me the way I longed to be loved.

That obsession led me here, to あなたの新しい愛する友達—“Your New Loving Friend,” Japan’s most renowned doll factory. I didn’t just want to be a worker there—I wanted to be a master. And I was.

People came from all over the country for my dolls. They swore my creations had eyes so lifelike, they could blink. They said my stitching was too perfect. My dolls didn’t just sit on shelves; they watched. They waited. There was something in them—something that made people uneasy.

But no matter how perfect they were, something was always missing.

They were empty. Soulless.

I hated it.

I hated that I could make something so flawless, yet it would never be real. It would never love me back.

So I kept working. Long after everyone else had gone home, I stayed. My hands bled from the endless stitching. My eyes burned under the dim factory lights. But I refused to stop. Not until I found what I was looking for.

And then, one night, I found it.

Or maybe… it found me.

I created a puppet unlike any other. It was beautiful. Its joints moved with inhuman grace, its glass eyes didn’t just reflect light—they seemed to hold something. The stitching on its body was perfect, as if the thread itself had a will of its own, pulling everything together in ways I could not explain.

It was more than a doll.

It was alive.

I stayed up all night, adjusting its delicate seams, ensuring every detail was flawless. But as I worked, I felt it—a breath.

Not mine.

I looked up.

The puppet was watching me.

I froze. My pulse thundered in my ears. The room was silent, save for the soft, almost human creak of the puppet’s wooden frame.

Then, it spoke.

“Why did you make me?”

The voice was soft, childlike. But it was wrong. There was something beneath the words, something dark. Something knowing.

I couldn’t speak. My hands trembled. I had never given it a voice. I had never taught it to speak. And yet—

“You love me, don’t you?”

I swallowed hard. My throat was dry.

The puppet tilted its head, its glass eye gleaming under the dim factory lights.

“But I am not enough, am I?”

The room felt smaller. The air thickened. I tried to push my chair back, but my body refused to move.

The puppet stepped down from the workbench.

Its movements were smooth. Unnatural. Human.

“You love your work more than you love me.”

And before I could react, its fingers shot forward—thin, delicate, strong.

Threads—**invisible, gossamer-thin—**wrapped around my wrists. My ankles. My throat.

I gasped. The strings tightened.

I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t fight it.

The puppet’s human eye gleamed with something dark, something hungry.

“Don’t struggle,” it whispered. “It only makes the stitching tighter.”

The strings pulled.

My vision blurred.

And then—

Everything went black.


By morning, the factory workers found nothing.

No blood. No body. No sign that I had ever existed.

All that remained was the puppet.

But it was different now.

One of its eyes… was human.

And stitched across its porcelain lips—

A small, twisted smile.



Part Two – The Threads That Bind

Decades passed. The factory shut down.

My story became nothing more than a whisper. A ghost story.

And then—

Yuto came.

He was young—fresh out of university, eager to make a name for himself. He had heard the rumors about the factory. The ghost of the dollmaker. The cursed puppets. But he didn’t believe in such things.

Not at first.

When he arrived, the factory was cold and abandoned. The walls were thick with dust. The air smelled of old wood, mothballs, and something faintly rotten.

Dolls lined the shelves, their glass eyes staring into the void. Some were missing limbs. Others slumped forward, as if waiting.

At first, Yuto wasn’t afraid.

But then—

Creak.

A soft noise.

A floorboard shifting.

Footsteps.

He spun around. His flashlight flickered.

And in that brief moment of darkness—

The dolls moved.

Not their bodies. Not their limbs.

Just their heads.

All of them turned—to face him.

A chill ran down his spine. He took a step back—

And then—

“You shouldn’t be here.”

The voice came from everywhere. From nowhere. It didn’t belong to a single doll.

It belonged to her.

She stepped from the shadows—

Tall. Ghostly pale.

Stitches pulled across her body, barely holding her together.

One of her eyes was glass. A doll’s eye.

The other—

Hollow. Dark. Endless.

Her dress, old but elegant, fluttered as she moved. Black ribbons wrapped around her sleeves. A delicate silk choker circled her neck—hiding something underneath.

Her small smile suffocated the room.

“You don’t belong here.”

Yuto tried to move. But he couldn’t.

The threads wrapped around him.

Thin. Invisible. Tightening.

“Threads never break,” she whispered.

Her glass eye glinted—cold. Unreadable.

“Only those who resist them… do.”

The strings pulled.

Yuto gasped. The air was heavy, suffocating.

His body—locked. His limbs—stiff.

And then, in the moment before his vision faded to black, he understood.

He wasn’t leaving.

He wasn’t escaping.

Because he was no longer human.

He was a puppet.

Bound by the hollow thread.
