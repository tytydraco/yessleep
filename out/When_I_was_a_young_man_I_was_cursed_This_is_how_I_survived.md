When I was a young man, I was cursed.   
  
I don’t know how, or by who. I don’t know if it was an accident or a deliberate attempt at ruining my life, and at this point, I doubt I ever will. I don’t know which one would be worse. In the end, I guess it doesn’t matter.  
  
I’m seventy-six years old now. I was born in a mid-sized town in a mid-sized county into a mid-sized family. I was a good kid. As good as anyone else, I guess. People weren’t as good then as they are now, though, but I hardly see that as being my fault. But sometimes I’ve wondered If I ever did harm someone badly enough for them to curse me; if I was the villain in someone’s story.  
  
But I don’t know what that something or who that someone could have been. I did my schoolwork, I played baseball, I hung out with my friends. Normal stuff. But when I was seventeen, something changed. Something sinister entered my life. I keep thinking back to that time, and if there was something I missed. Something I’d done, or someone had done unto me. But as is often the case, the roots are buried somewhere beneath, out of sight. Just under our footsteps, never in front of us.  
  
I began to see shadows where there weren’t none. Sometimes they were in the windows, blocking the sunlight like an ephemeral fog. Other times they rose up into dark and thin creatures in the distance, like sprouting trees. Those same shadows started to invade my dreams, and I’d wake up in a cold sweat with my hands in taut fists, the fingernails digging deep into my palms.   
  
And when I couldn’t sleep - or sometimes outright refused to - they began to walk on our rooftop. I’d hear their steps; up and down, around and over, like they were playing hide and seek. I wondered how shadows could make footsteps. Often I wrapped a pillow around my head to drown them out. But the tighter I pulled the pillow, the harder they stomped. My parents nor my siblings never heard a peep.  
  
After a while, I entered a state of constant drowsiness, which quickly reflected on my day-to-day life. I couldn’t concentrate at school, as I would sleep through all my classes. Those noisy classrooms were busy enough to grant me some peace from those things. They couldn’t do much in large crowds. Those were the only times when I could sleep peacefully. Have a break.  
  
Soon I didn’t have the energy to play sports or hang out with friends anymore. My friends, along with my parents, asked me questions I had no answers to. Had I started taking drugs? Hanging out with the wrong people? Gotten some illness? Funnily enough, nowadays I feel like all my symptoms pointed to depression, but in those days the word was used purely in its economic context. Nowadays it’s easier to talk about such things, but back then, there was no way - I’d be sent to the loony bin in a quick second. And a padded, isolated room sounded like a death trap. Probably would’ve been, in a very literal sense.  
  
As often as I could I’d sneak out of the house at night and try to get into any of the local bars. Seeing as they were deterred - or at least somewhat incapacitated - by large groupings of people, incidentally, bars were the only places during the night which granted me that veil of protection. Sometimes I got in, oftentimes not. If they shooed me away, it was a long and anxious walk back home. They’d gotten closer and closer. More familiar. More… *brave*. I saw them climb around fences and up on the roofs of buildings, just staring at me. Sometimes I ran home.  
  
But there was one bar that let me in pretty much every time. It was quite a long walk away, but the owner, Andy, was a good guy. The first time I went there, as I went to order a beer, I could see that he was about to tell me to take a hike; I never looked old for my age. But when he looked at me, I mean *really* looked at me, something in his mannerism seemed to change. Maybe it was the bags under my eyes or the defeated posture I held, but I like to think that Andy thought that wherever I’d go back to would be worse than there in that bar. So Andy let me stay.  
  
The establishment itself was, I guess, what you would call a dive-bar. To get into the semi-basement, you had to walk down these uneven concrete steps that also functioned as an impromptu outdoors urinal, giving them a consistently wet, ammonia-marinated quality. All the windows were small and high up the walls, showing a curbside view of people’s feet as they walked past. Inside was the bartable itself, lackluster in choices of drink, and around the room were round wooden tables and an array of different kinds of chairs, no two of which were the same kind. In its own way, it was kind of cozy.  
  
I couldn’t always make the trip. The walk was too long, and filled with too many shadows. But I tried as often as I could. But every time I did go, Andy had saved me a seat. When it was quiet, usually during the early evening or late-late night, we’d get to talking. Just small talk about something funny that had happened at the bar, or how the weather was looking. It was nice to get to do something normal, to feel some connection to humanity again.  
  
After a few weeks I’d developed a new routine. I’d sleep at school, and I’d head over to Andy’s as quickly as I could, before the dark set in. Andy wouldn’t serve me alcohol, but he went through the trouble of giving me apple juice in a whisky glass, to give the right appearance, I guess. I stayed even after Andy kicked everyone else out, and I helped him clean up. We’d walk out together, but once he was out of view, heading to his place on the other side of town, I’d sprint back home. When the streets were empty and the light was low, I’d hear them whispering. From alleyways and under broken street lamps I could see their elongated forms taking shape, but I never looked long enough to see their full form. Somehow I knew that if I did, that’d be it. My end.  
  
I started bringing some of my school books with me to do just enough homework so I wouldn’t fail my classes. Even with the faux whiskey, I must’ve looked out of place, but no one ever gave me trouble. I think Andy had something to do with that.  
  
One night me and Andy were talking, and he said he had something important to tell me. He never had anything important to say, which was a trait that served him well as a bartender. I was sure he was going to tell me I was no longer welcome, that it wasn’t good for him to host some stray kid every night. But the truth was much worse.  
  
“Donnie, listen,” he began, his voice entirely devoid of his regular bartender’s joviality. “I’m moving.”  
  
“Moving where?” I asked, hoping that he simply meant he’d move to a new apartment; and maybe he’d need to close earlier or start charging more; or maybe he’d found a new bar, something closer to me perhaps; or *something*.  
  
“Connecticut. I’m leaving.”  
  
I couldn’t believe it. Or, I *could*, but I knew that without Andy and his bar I’d be shit out of luck. I needed this place. It was the only thing keeping me safe. And although I wished Andy nothing but the best of the best, what came out of my mouth was “You can’t leave.”  
  
He sighed and put down the scratched glass he’d been drying so long the act had evolved into futile polishing.   
  
“I’ve been thinking about it for a while. All my family’s there, and now my dad’s sick. I need to go there and help out. I’m sorry.”  
  
And I believed him. But I *needed* him.  
  
“Where am I supposed to go, Andy?” I asked him. “What will I do without you?”  
  
“Go home,” he said, then sighed again, this time with utter defeat in his voice. “Look, I know that there’s some reason you’re out here every night. Things must be hard for you at home, and I’ve never asked you why. That’s your business, and I respect that. But you’re gonna be eighteen soon, so I strongly advise you to get the hell outta dodge. Leave. Find some job, and make your own life.”  
  
Tears began to well in my eyes. “I can give you some cash, if you need it,” he said.   
  
“It’s not that,” I said, as I wiped the tears on my sleeve with quick swoops. “It’s…”  
  
“What? C’mon, you can tell me,” he said, with slight agitation in his voice. He put the glass in a cupboard behind him, slamming it down harder than he needed to.  
  
And as the myriad ways in which I could explain what I was going through tumbled through my mind, one obvious and concrete idea seemed to come up more than others. I hadn’t thought to put it into words before, but this particular word was, in all its ridiculousness, perfect.   
  
“I’m cursed, Andy,” I said.  
  
For a moment it seemed like he stopped breathing, and his eyes looked as if they were assessing me in the same way he assessed his real-whiskey-drinking patrons for signs to cut them off.   
  
“Cursed?” he finally answered.  
  
And that was enough acknowledgement for me to spill my guts out. I told him everything, and when I was done, I felt embarrassed, *crazy*, even, but also a little bit lighter. Andy was quiet for a while after that. I dared not look at him. I wanted him to process what I’d told him, give him the chance to make up his mind on his own. I mean, it was a ludicrous idea, and anything more I’d say would probably only strengthen any disbelief he held. So I let him stir.  
  
He began to do his final rounds, putting chairs back under the tables and checking the locks. I was sure he’d had enough - he was finally kicking me out; sniffed out my bullshit; realized that I’ve been pulling his leg all this time.   
  
He stood by the door with the keys to the bar in his hand, looking at me.  
  
“Show me,” he said.  
  
\-  
  
I didn’t even know if I could show him, if the curse was a purely subjective one, or if others really could see those dark shadows lurking. But I had to try, so I walked outside without saying a word, and he followed, locking the door behind us.   
  
“I’ll walk you home,” he said. “All the way.”  
  
And so we began to walk.   
  
At first they seemed reluctant to come forth, and for once when I needed them, they wouldn’t show. Maybe they were smart like that. We walked for almost half of the trip without saying a word, and with nothing at all happening. Andy kept looking around, but his swiveling head began to turn less and less, until he was simply staring forward with a disappointed and worried look on his face.  
  
With no less than a quarter mile from home, I saw it.   
  
It was standing on the slanted rooftop of a fancy, midwest-modern home. It seemed to emerge from the darkness of night itself, its features diminished and visible only by the aura of faint streetlamps. But it was there. Its body stood at least nine feet tall, with long, sharp arms that seemed to drag on well below its knees. Its face was blurred, but I knew it was looking at me. My legs screamed in agony for permission to run. But they stalled. I had to stall. This was my last chance.  
  
Andy walked a few feet in front of me until he realized I was no longer by his side. He turned towards me with palpable confusion. When I looked at him I realized my eyes were strained from how unnaturally open I’d kept them, with teardrops forming at their edges. I wasn’t sure what to do, so I simply looked at the rooftop again and asked him “Do you see it?”  
  
I’m not sure if I was relieved or death-scared when he simply said “Yes.”  
  
\-  
  
Without a word, we began to run.   
  
I led the way towards my house, and I could hear behind me how Andy’s breathing became ragged and malformed. Glancing back at him, I could see his legs detouring slightly as he strained his head to look at each and every rooftop and shadow with sheer fright. There were more, now. And even though Andy was obviously having trouble keeping up - he wasn’t the athletic type - with him by my side I could keep my own mind clear. Home wasn’t far, and it was much better to do this with someone else, even if I felt terribly scared that Andy had contracted the curse as well.   
  
Finally, we stopped on the opposite street to my house and I said “We’re here,” as I pointed at my house.  
  
Andy sat down on the curb. He was breathing so hard that for a moment I thought he might die.  
  
“C’mon. You can come inside. Let’s go, Andy,” I said. We hadn’t seen anything out of the ordinary for the last stretch of our run, but that left me with the gnawing uncertainty of them catching up.   
  
Andy’s breathing finally normalized enough for him to speak. “That’s your parent’s house, yeah?” he asked.  
  
“Yeah.”  
  
“And they’re home?”  
  
“Yeah. C’mon, let’s go, Andy. They’ll catch up.”  
  
“And how do we explain you coming home with a pudgy middle-aged man in the morning?”  
  
That was a fair question, and one with no obvious good answer. But I didn’t care. The explaining was going to be better than sitting here, waiting for those things to catch up to us.  
  
“We’ll pretend I snuck out to drink at your bar, and you ID’d me and found out I was underage, so you brought me home to tell my parents,” I said hurriedly.  
  
Andy got up and said “That’s not going to work for a number of reasons.”  
  
“But —”  
  
“Listen,” he said, his voice shedding off the fringes of fright to make way for something serious. Andy looked around the rooftops and the shadowy lawns, giving an extra second or two to evaluate the long road behind us. Then he turned to me and clasped my face between his hands, which had thick calluses that scratched at my cheeks.  
  
“I believe you. You’re cursed. I thought you were just making it up, but as we ran here, I thought about it and what it means. I know you’re not lying. Now, we probably don’t have much time, and I’m not coming inside your house, so you need to listen to me very carefully.”  
  
He let go of my face and I nodded, giving him my full attention.  
  
“Do you know where or how you got it from? The curse?” he asked.  
  
“No. No idea.”  
  
“Are you absolutely sure?” he asked. I didn’t understand how that was so important. At that moment, to me, it was like the universe: it was there and we were in it regardless of where it came from or who had made it.   
  
“I’m sure,” I said.  
  
“*Shit*… okay,” he said, glancing over his shoulder to look at the street. “Here’s what’s gonna happen. I’m gonna give you some cash, and tomorrow you’ll use it to buy yourself a bus ticket. Anything that’s cheap and will take you as far away from here as possible. With the rest of the money, rent a motel room. Again, as cheap as you can find. Stay there and see how long it takes for them to catch up. Figure out how it works. Find odd jobs to get yourself more money, and buy another bus ticket if you need to. You figure it out and you make a plan, okay?”  
  
Something broke inside of me then. Andy voiced the ultimatum I knew to be true, but didn’t want to accept.   
  
“But I need to graduate and —”  
  
“If you stay here you won’t graduate. You won’t get that far. You need to figure this out, and to do that, you need to move around. Learn how it works. Otherwise you’ll be putting yourself and those close to you in danger.”  
  
“And how would you know that?” I said, the words coming out as near-screams.   
  
“I don’t,” he confessed. “But you said it’s gotten worse over time, yes? That you can barely function at school, and you don’t even see your friends anymore? And now, you’ve been staying almost every night at the bar for what, a *month*?”  
  
I nodded. Even if I wasn’t aware of it, I was already running from them. Staying at Andy's every night was proof of that.  
  
“So it’s safe to assume it’s only going to get worse,” he continued. “And if you have no idea how you got this curse, then you’ve got no options but try and figure it out. And once I’m gone you’ll be alone at night. Think about that! I don’t know how it would end, but it won’t be good. Do you understand what I’m saying?”  
  
“Yeah. I understand.”  
  
He pulled out his wallet and with shaking hands grabbed everything he had in the bill-slot and gave it to me. There was at least two hundred dollars. I pocketed the wad of bills.  
  
“Go home. And when you can, go get the bus ticket. The earlier the better. Figure it out. You’re strong, Donnie. You can do it.”  
  
The first slivers of light began to play in the horizon. I was about to say something to Andy, but all I can remember coming out of my mouth was nonsense; words of gratitude and fright and pleading melted into a sobbing mess of gibberish. I must’ve been shaking, because Andy, even though he shook as well, grabbed my sides and stabilized me. He looked me in the eyes and said “Good luck, Donnie.”  
  
And I turned to go home. Andy walked hurriedly towards the rising sun.   
  
The next day, I did exactly as he told me. I went to get a bus ticket. I told the lady at the desk to give me the cheapest long-distance ticket she had. I never said goodbye to my parents. I never saw my friends again.   
  
\-  
  
The first year was the hardest, but it taught me some valuable lessons - lessons which served me well for the rest of my life.  
  
1. It took them around two months to catch up. Although this made no sense to me, I had to accept it as it was. Curses don't abide by natural law. And it coincided with Andy’s theory, which, in my mind, gave it more validity. I doubted that the shadows used buses and roadmaps to find me, but maybe it was something more psychological. Like they wouldn’t let me settle down. They’d tear down whatever life I tried to build, forcing me to abandon it before it even really got started. A false sense of security.  
  
2. Post offices, construction, and restaurants were the best for odd jobs. They always needed workers, and it wasn’t unusual for them to have people come in and out. At the very least, I could get some money to sustain myself.  
  
3. No relationships. One time I got mixed up with this girl, and when she started to see the shadows, I had to leave her. I felt so bad for her, but what else could I have done? This curse was infectious, it seemed. It was smart and deliberate.  
  
There are a thousand other rules and regulations I made for myself, but those three, set in the first year, truly saved my life. Like Andy had told me, I’d figured it out, and I’d gotten good at it. And I guess I got used to it. The life, I mean. It was different, and very lonely, but it was a life. And I got to see a lot of stuff because of the constant traveling. Silver-linings and all that.   
  
\-  
  
That was all so long ago now. The first year turned to the first few, and then I hit the ten-year mark, then twenty, and so on. The date I had left my hometown replaced my birthday. It was more important. It was my calendar, my sun, and my compass, by which I regulated my life.   
  
I got so good at it that I almost completely stopped seeing them. I could evade the curse’s corporeal form just before it manifested. Sometimes I’d think it had stopped, and I spent too long in one place. Then they caught up to me, and I was once again reminded of the curse. But I got better and better. So much better that now it’s been twenty years without seeing them. The twenty years before that proved to me that they wouldn’t go away.   
  
So, yes. I hadn’t seen them in a long time. So long that I began to forget what they looked like. What they felt like. Until now, which is why I’m writing this story for you all, which is why I can once again recall their form and their movements. But now it’s worse than ever.  
  
\-  
  
Old age has taken its toll, and I'm unable to run from them no longer. I’m sure my unorthodox lifestyle didn’t do me any favors either. Never having a home. Someone to come home to.   
  
I regret it all so much. I miss my parents, who are long dead - I found out on the internet some years ago. On the obituary, where they write *missed by such and such*, I wasn’t included. I guess that makes sense. I miss Andy, the man who saved my life, but I hate him so much for it. Now I wish I had stayed. Graduated. I wish I’d told someone, tried seeking help, even if they couldn’t provide it. At least my parents would’ve known what took their son. My friends could have visited me in the mental asylum, or attended my funeral.  
  
But now I’m stuck. I’m too old to run. So, after all these years of cat-and-mouse, they’ve caught up to me.  
  
I’m staying at a fancy hotel. I decided that if I’m to die, I wish it to be somewhere fancy. It took a lot of my savings, but money don’t matter anymore. I don’t have a will, either. Who would I give my money to, anyway?  
  
They’re all around me now. They creep in the shadows, and stir me awake just as I’m about to fall asleep. They torture me in these diabolical ways, yet they don’t attack my person. It’s like they want to take their time with me. I guess after all this time, as they’ve finally caught their prey, they wish to make me suffer. Take their sweet time with me. They’re no longer afraid of the light. Of crowds. I see them everywhere. Behind the young man at the lobby who gave me my key. Crawling on the ceiling of my room. Behind the windows, scratching at the glass in long, searing streaks.  
  
Their pointed, long tongues scrape at the wooden furniture. Their long arms slither like snakes under my bed, leaving rusted stains on the carpet. Their bodies, made of gnawed, dark flesh, taunt me as they walk around the room. And their faces, oh *God*, their faces, like charcoal, with the sharp teeth of a shark, they stare at me, their bloodshot eyes round and unblinking.   
  
And soon they will take me. I’m sure of it.  
  
This is my goodbye. To nobody and to everyone. I never found out how I’ve come upon this curse, but I’ve fought it the only way I could.  
  
If you ever happen upon a curse like mine, do not run.  
  
Face it.  
  
It’s better to love until the end than to wither away in desolation.
