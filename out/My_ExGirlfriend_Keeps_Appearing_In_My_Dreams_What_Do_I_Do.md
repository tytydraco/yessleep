I live a pretty miserable life. No aspirations, no goals, no hobbies, no real connections with people. It sucks, but at least I have the insight to admit that it’s all my fault. My passion died when I turned 14 and everything since then has been distractions to fuel my dopamine addled brain until I die. Even writing this now is a struggle, I’m having to use literary muscles I thought had atrophied completely. I wouldn’t be writing this at all if I didn’t need help, badly. I don’t think anything else besides posting my story here would be able to help me, God knows doctors can’t.

It all started a few months back when I learned about the concept of lucid dreaming, controlling your dreams through realizing you’re in a dream. It seemed like the perfect tool to make my miserable life a little better, provide some escapism through sleeping. So, I started looking up how-tos to DIY my own nocturnal reality.

 One of the big methods other lucid dreamers encourage is reality checking, setting a timer so every few waking hours you check to make sure you aren’t dreaming. These checks usually involve touching a mirror, pinching yourself, trying to remember how you got where you are or checking if the people around you are behaving normally. The whole idea behind it is that if you start checking your reality while being awake, you’ll start checking your reality while you’re asleep. So, I set a timer, and every 2 hours I did a reality check. I touched the walls, looked at my hands, or tried to hold my breath. I also started logging these in my phone. It felt silly having to denote every 2 hours, but it seemed a small price to pay for unlimited freedom for 8 hours each night. I was just beginning to doubt the value of my efforts when I had a lucid dream for the first time.



It started within my old elementary school, stuck within the front desk in the class, alone except for my ex-girlfriend. It felt hazy, foggy like the room was trapped in a cloud, swaying back and forth as if seabound. My desk was covered in exam papers for an exam I hadn’t studied for.

“Micheal, you haven’t even started your exam and there’s only 10 minutes left of class”

“I didn’t know we were going to have an exam, Angela,” my voice wavered, swaying almost in time with the room. Angela shook her head, moving closer to me now. Her skin porcelain, hair like straw that brushed against her shoulders, her eyes pearlescent, fingernails tipped in faded blue polish. She was stunning, just as I remembered her last. Her hand came up and ruffled my hair.

“You never really try, do you Micheal?” She made her way out of the classroom, smiling, swaying through the rows of desks, almost waltzing with the sway of the room. I wanted to call her back, I wanted to draw her close, but I found my mouth glued shut, and my body now glued to its seat. I despaired, I was losing her again, and then, my phone’s alarm went off.

I checked my surroundings. Classrooms are real, I might not usually be in one, but it could happen. I couldn’t pinch myself, my arms and legs were thoroughly stuck. Then, I tried reading the writing on the whiteboard. In cursive scrawlings was written “Good Morning”, but when I tried to read the word letter by letter I couldn’t. The meaning of the writing was there, but the actual writing was nonsense, gibberish, my brain trying to fill in the gaps while the language center of my brain was sleeping. I was dreaming. In hindsight that made a lot more since considering I hadn’t taken an exam in 10 years and my ex would certainly not be around to administer it to me. 

I stood, willing the façade of the classroom to fade. Leaving me on the shore of a beach, waves lapping at my feet. I called to Angela, summoning her back. She turned to me, the light of the sun cocooning her, her skin a prism reflecting the harsh rays, taming them like the soft glimmer of the moon. She smiled, something I had not seen for a long time. I ran my hands against her. I knew it was a dream. I knew it was fiction made from the firing of nerves in my sleeping brain, but I could have sworn I FELT the skin of her arms against me like the fuzz of a peach.

“What are you doing Micheal?” she whispered. Her dress fluttered around her, lapping against the wind. She tamed my stray hairs with her hand, running it against my neck, settling it to rest upon my shoulder.

“I’ve missed you so much,”

“You can’t do this. It isn’t right. I shouldn’t be here,”

“Just stay a little longer. For me?”

“Just a little,” she let me hold her to my chest, and the dream continued. We talked, we reminisced, she was everything I had remembered her to be. Kind, funny, smart. I wanted her to talk forever, my life could be a glorious eternity of sitting in rapture of her. But the sun set upon the dream beach, and she stood pulling away from me.

“Our times up again. It already was. I’m happy I got to spend just a little bit more with you,” she said.

“No. I won’t lose you again. You have to stay,” I grabbed her, I hadn’t meant to grab her hard, but she seemed to flinch in pain. She struggled but I held on. She shouldn’t have struggled, it was my dream, I was the master of it, it bent to my will.

“You don’t get to leave again, ever,” I shouted. The sun set upon the crashing waves of an imaginary ocean. I stood, grasping at the ghost of a girl long gone, a fragment I would trap within my psyche for an eternity I couldn’t understand. The twilight colors of night began to set in, reflecting off her glossy eyes, wet with tears.

“Please,” she cried, desperate, begging. I awoke.

 

I know it might sound strange after the half success of my first lucid dream, but I became like an addict looking for another fix. I wanted to see her again, I had to. My days were consumed by a cycle, every 2 waking hours was a reality check, a handful of melatonin gummies, cold medicine, and even Benadryl to get me to fall asleep. I began sleeping more and more, and the less I remained awake the more drowsy my waking hours became. This might sound miserable. It was, but what else was there to do? 

My reality became neglected. Bugs gathered around dirty dishes that littered my apartment. Everything smelled of decay and rot, a miasma of apathy. 



A couple days after my first lucid dream, Angela appeared at my doorstep, slumped, unmoving. I had taken her inside, she hadn’t said a word about the state of the apartment, I think her presence might have even worsened it. As crazy as it sounded, I figured I might have summoned her here, like my dreams had a sort of analog to the real world. I was happy that she was back, even in the state she was in. It was a little less lonely with her there. 

I know this should have been the end, Angela was back and I could patch up our relationship, but she was unresponsive, cold. I had tried talking to her, but she wouldn’t respond. I guess it made a strange sort of sense that we could only connect through dreams. If my dreams were powerful enough to bring her here they must be strong enough to make her better as well. 

Angela moved about the apartment sometimes, seemingly only when I wasn’t looking. I was so focused on my dreaming efforts that I often didn’t see her for days. I figured she must still be in the apartment though as I would find little trinkets she would leave, wet footprints across the bathroom, stray hairs on the furniture, doors open that I had left shut. It felt very much like having a pet cat silently roaming around.

 Despite not seeing her frequently, her appearance seemed to worsen each time I did see her. I should have been concerned, maybe taken her to the doctor, but I was stuck, ingrained into the idea that I could only help through my dreams, that if I could do it again, we would be like we always had, that first dream had been so picturesque it was easy to deny the reality of her.

Things continued much the same, until weeks later, I had my second dream. 



I stood within a chapel, one from my youth, back when I still attended services every Sunday. The stained glass casting colored light through the pews. This was the church my parents had been married in. I remember the day, nearly tasting it on my tongue, the memory so strong, dissolving like cotton candy against my lips. Memories embedded with youth and sunlight. I was sitting next to my family. They’re bodies stiff, an empty facsimile of the people I loved. They stared straight ahead at the pulpit, where she kneel praying. 

My reality check was much quicker this time, with no need for a phone reminder. She was here, so I must be dreaming. I walked to her. Her hands trapping a rosary, thumbing beads, eyes closed, lips moving in silently uttered prayers. I reached out to touch her.

“You need to let me go,” Her voice rang out through the church, echoing against its high ceilings, her eyes still shut. 

“You know I can’t do that,”  I muttered quietly into her hair.

“You’re going to make yourself sick, it isn’t healthy, it- it hurts,” her body wracked with quiet sobs. I stood back and took the sight of her in.

 Shrouded in a black robe robe she looked at me with tear laden eyes. Every section of her peeking out from under the robe was a mess of bruises, pooling in strange spots speckling her skin like splatters of carmine colored paint against a pale blue canvas. From her mouth trailed a line of fluid, also rust colored that spewed from her mouth incessantly, flying from it when she spoke. Her lungs rattled. Her eyes, the color of cataracts, seemed pushed back into her swollen skull. Delicately she reached out a bloated arm, tears staining her cheeks crimson. 

“I’m sorry, oh God Angela. I can fix it,” I couldn’t imagine the reason why my subconscious would depict her in such a way, in such torment, but I could fix it. I was the master of this realm and I could just will her to be better, to be healthy, to be back to how she was the first time I dreamed her. It would be as easy as thinking it so.  

It wouldn’t. Nothing I did made it better. I could will anything into existence, but I couldn’t make her better. I tried, ceaselessly I tried. As she begged to be released, I tried over and over again, and she wouldn’t get better. She wouldn’t heal. I felt useless as I watched her suffer. I begged and pleaded alongside her, staring up at my family in the pews, their hollow eyes only reflecting my pain back to me. 

“I can’t move on until you let me go,” over and over she would scream, a pile of pieces, barely humanoid laying on the floor. 

“I can fix it, I just need more practice. I promise, you don’t have to leave,” 

“Please,” she begged, more puddle than human, melting before me. I awoke.



As horrible as it seems, I didn’t stop trying  to fix her through my dreams. Of course I had to do some trouble shooting before making a real attempt again. Obviously the abuse of over the counter medication had led to some weird side effects but that could be fixed through their removal and course corrected through the reading of some lucid dreaming guides to avoid melted ex girlfriends. I figured after a few weeks of getting my sleep schedule back to normal through eating healthier, cutting down on my screen time before bed, cleaning up a little around the apartment, limiting myself to 8 hours of sleep a night and fixing my circadian rhythm, I’d be good to go for another attempt. 

Angela seemed to have left the apartment after that dream, I don’t know if it had scared her away, if I had messed it up somehow. Her absence at least made it easier to clean up the apartment, when she was here she was always leaving messes behind.  I missed her though, my days were now so much quieter, emptier with her gone again. It made me all the more desperate to get her back. When I laid down to sleep each night, begging myself to dream of her again I could almost feel her with me, like she was encouraging me with her presence, cradling me as I fell asleep. 

It only took a handful of days for her to reappear in my dreams. 



I was on a dock. Across from me she stood, facing the waves. I was so excited I almost ran to her. She looked halfway normal again, until she turned to face me. 

Her eyes were squashed like old grapes, draped across her ashen cheeks. Her skin now tight against her bones, almost like the head of a drum, breaking in places where it had given away to the tension. From her crawled forth all manner of creatures, boring holes into her body, their fat white flesh acting as a contrast to her blackened sunken features. She dropped her robe, it rising into the breeze, revealing her stomach pregnant with her liquified innards, skin transparent in the sun's light. 

She walked towards me, each step rocking the gallons of fluid contained in her body cavity. Finally, taking my face into her hands, she gazed at me with her unseeing eyes. I awoke, but the dream did not end, I lay in my bed, her hands still upon me. I screamed. I could feel my body stuck in place, glued still, as our faces grew closer and closer. From her eyes crawled beetles with radiant carapaces that mirrored the green her eyes used to be. 

Finally, our faces inches apart, she opened her mouth. What poured from her was tarlike, featuring bugs, teeth, chunks of flesh and still squirming rats. It coated my face, covering my eyes, my mouth, even dripping down into my ears. I thrashed, trying to claw her away, trying to get the substance off of me. I woke up, clawing at my face screaming. I reality checked, immediately, holding my breath for 30 seconds. Yes, this was real, I sighed and vomited onto my floor. 



The damage was mostly psychological. I had a few scratches on my cheeks from myself initially freaking out upon waking up, still trying to get the gunk off of my face. I tried not to think of the way her hands had felt against me, leatherlike, crone-esque. I called a psychologist, obviously I had not handled things as well as I had initially thought if my subconscious was going to commit such levels of treason against me.

 The psychologist visits went well, talking about the sudden shock of the loss, how it can be hard to move on, and why my ex-girlfriend might be appearing as a sleep paralysis ghoul. The psychologist didn’t even seem too shocked, it might be a more common phenomenon than I had initially thought. Armed with tools of self forgiveness and mindfulness activities I mentally felt better prepared for the next time, physically however, I couldn’t fall asleep. The psychologist called it somniphobia, a fear of falling asleep, probably caused by my nightmares. 

Everytime I went to lie in bed I felt my heart race, I felt like I needed to flee now or risk death. My thoughts would race until they felt like pure static in my head. I tried deep breathing, exposure therapy, CBT,  but I couldn’t get more than a few hours of sleep a night and could only fall asleep if I passed out from exhaustion. I started moving through the world like a zombie, days blurring, everything feeling wrapped in cotton, dull, muted. At least I couldn’t dream while sleeping for such short periods. At least I didn’t have to see her again, not until the sleep paralysis started. 

Lack of sleep and my now developing panic disorder both contributed to an increased risk of sleep paralysis, but even the doctors don’t know why it happens every night. Everytime I wake I am glued still, even my lungs aren’t able to fully move, and I see her. Sometimes she is sitting at the foot of my bed, sometimes petting my hair, sometimes she is hiding somewhere in my room watching me. Everytime I see her she looks worse, more pieces fall off of her, sometimes she tries to talk, I think her vocal cords are long gone, but I still get the meaning even if I can’t hear the words. She wants me to let her go. But I can’t, I can still make things better. 

My sleep paralysis only lasts a few minutes, and then once again I am the master of my own limbs and I am able to get out of bed and see that she is not really there. But sometimes I am not so sure she is really truly gone. I think I can feel her sometimes, in the corner of my eye, in the closet tucked next to my shoes, just outside of the shower curtain while I wash my hair. I think I can sense her behind doors, just waiting for me to open them or around corners just out of sight. She can only move in my dreams, and for the few minutes when I transition from sleeping to waking, but nonetheless, I can still sense her. 

Ever since my last dream I’ve stopped reality checking, I’ve actively tried to prevent lucid dreaming just to ensure I don’t see her again in my dreams, but yesterday I was at the psychiatrist again discussing my progress since the last session and I realized that I couldn’t read the diploma on the wall. I could see it, I could make out the meaning, but the letters were just beyond my comprehension. I went to ask the doctor about this, ask if this was a symptom of the lack of sleep and she was there instead. She just stared at me.

 She was so small, crumpled against herself. She reminded me of a mummy, hollowed out and dried, a husk. She sat unmoving, as if she was unable to push herself to do so, even in my dream. 

“I’m tired of this game,” I told her, she nodded, her neck crinkling like dried paper. 

“I don’t think this is healthy for either of us,” I said, and she nodded again.

“I’m sorry, I should have been there for you. I didn’t try hard enough and now I’m just making it worse,” she stood from the chair, slowly and with great effort,and hugged me. I awoke.



I stood from my bed, taking in my apartment with fresh eyes. The bugs and rodents had worsened, flies born from maggots born from flies, generations created and died solely within the apartment. A large stain creeped out from under my bed. I had noticed it weeks ago, but I had been in denial of its source. The dark rust color of the stain could be from only one source. A source that was also perpetrating the bug problem. I kneeled beside the bed, leveling my head with the floor and gazed at Angela. 

She hadn’t left, she had just been hiding. I tried to scoop her out as delicately as possible, making sure that she came in one piece without much of a fight. I slid her small form into a duffle bag, hauling in over my shoulder, loading it into my car. I drove down to the lake, our favourite spot and I delicately laid her down on the wooden dock next to me. Her body supine, as I dangled my feet into the water that had taken her so long ago.



I have not been entirely honest, not with you the reader or with myself. Angela Withers died 3 months ago, drowning in the local lake due to exhaustion. I was with her. I had tried to save her, but I was just too late. I was too scared to call the paramedics. What would be the point? So, I left her, and I went home. No one knew I had been out there with her. I told her parents she had dumped me and left with another man to a different state. 

I won’t pretend to know the force that brought her back to me, but I know that it has to end. Sitting at the dock, for the first time in weeks, I basked in the sunlight, letting it infuse me with its warmth, feeling it radiate into my bones. I was no longer a creature of dreams, trapped in a spiral of loss. It was time to let go.

“I know it hasn’t all been good, but I’m glad we got to spend a little bit more time together,” I kissed her, delicately on the remains of her forehead, and tossed her remains into the lake. She had always been right. It was time for something new. To build new skills, gain new hobbies, make friends, call my parents, clean my apartment. 

That should have been the end of it. She was gone back, released, back where she really belonged. But my dreams haven’t stopped. I still see her, but she is something else now. 

Her skin is new, made from patches of algae, her teeth glitter like the scales of a fish. Her hair is strands of plants that dance in the water surrounding her. She is beautiful again, and she is not ready to let me go. Each night I dream of her beautiful watery form as she pulls me close to her, whispering to me of everything she has become. She tells me that she’s there at the lake, waiting for me, that she has an eternity planned for us, and I listen.

I feel as if I am in her dreams now, she dreams of the lake, of me, my body made out of the fauna of the lake just as hers. I am imprisoned by these dreams, she holds me captive. Mentally, I twist and writhe but she is so much stronger than me now. Sometimes she dreams of me as I am with my flesh and bone, jumping into the lake. In these dreams she holds me as I drown, Holds me as I rot, holds me as I turn into bones, and holds me as I finally as filled with new life through the lake. I have drowned dozens of times in her dreams.

If the dreams were just dreams then I wouldn’t be writing this, but I no longer wake in my bed. She is pulling me towards her. I started waking in my front lawn, then down the street. Now I awaken in the forest, everynight having to walk further and further back home. It is exhausting. I don’t think I have much time left until I find myself on that dock.
