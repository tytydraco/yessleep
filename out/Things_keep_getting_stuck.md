You know that optical illusion where you’re driving by a plane coming in to land, and you’re both moving at the perfect speed and the perfect angle, and it looks like it’s not moving at all? I’ve seen this dozens of times, and it never bothered me, until it destroyed my life.

I’m a pretty regular person, at least professionally. I show up for work at 6:58 AM every day, and leave right at 4:00. So when I noticed a 737 doing the “not moving” illusion two days in a row, I didn’t think anything of it.  Nothing beyond “Hey, I saw a plane there yesterday.” The third day I figured it just must be the same flight. The 2:30 in from Chicago or something. It quickly became a fixture on my drive home, a little joke I had with myself. “There’s the magic plane again!”

After a week or so I had a day where I worked late. Nothing too bad, 15 extra minutes or so to finish up a project. When I drove back home, there it was, in the same spot, doing its same illusion. This confused me more than anything. I didn’t think the world was ending, but the chance that the plane happened to be 15 minutes late on the same day I was, seemed pretty much impossible. I thought that maybe it was a different flight, but the plane looked like the same model, same airline, and I don’t think two planes would land so close to each other on the same runway, right?

The next day I got curious, so instead of taking a little overtime I decided to leave 15 minutes early and break even on the week. When I took the curve onto the highway, there it was. The same plane 15 or so minutes early this time. If the fight being delayed the same day I was is almost impossible, the same flight being 15 minutes early the same time I was is definitely impossible. It really shook me, and I didn’t think about much else when I got home, or at work the next day. 

I decided to run a little test. I felt on the verge of crazy, and even my test felt a little silly at the time. When I got off work, instead of heading straight home, I found a parking lot near the airport, an Arby’s. I parked and found my “magic plane” in the sky, expecting it to just fly by because I was at a different angle. I figured the optical illusion would break if I wasn’t driving. I was wrong, because it wasn’t an illusion. The plane stayed there. Minute after agonizing minute, it just hung in the air, refusing to move. 

I stayed there for a half an hour, every second begging the plane to move. I tried to convince myself it had a crazy headwind. I even tried to convince myself it might be some new experimental commercial aircraft that could hover. I mean as wild as that sounds it seems more probable than a plane just… stopping. I stayed until I saw one plane land and another take off. That’s what finally convinced me I wasn’t going to see anything change.

Thank god it was a Friday, I couldn’t imagine going to work the day after that. I barely made it home. It was like driving after learning my Dad died, just so full of emotion that basic function was hard.

When I did get home, I didn’t do much. I just showered and tried to go to sleep. I guess eventually my brain just got tired of running the same few explanations and gave up. 

I felt better in the morning. I managed to sleep off the shakes of the previous night and put together a decent breakfast for myself, trying to fill the gap of a skipped dinner. I contemplated going to the doctor, but I could only imagine the incredulous look on her face as she shipped me off to a shrink. I was always scared of doctors anyway. I ended up spending that weekend holed up, just watching movies and YouTube. I realized that I was gravitating towards things with movement, finding them more comforting than anything else.

The next few work days went by with very little of note. It might be more crazy than the plane itself how fast I adapted to it being there. I just kinda… didn’t look up. I knew it would be there, but I somehow managed to convince myself the whole situation was fine. As long as I didn’t look at it, I didn’t have to think about it too hard. Over that week at work my headspace slowly started to fill back up with the normal drudge any office type worker thinks about. PTO, deadlines, the works.

I asked a couple of my coworkers about the plane at the start of the week (indirectly of course, asking if they know the illusion I was talking about) and only got confused looks and segways to other topics. I left it alone after that, and by the end of the week I only thought about the plane when I was passing it on the highway. Again, crazy how quickly it became normal. I think that’s why it shook me so hard when I saw a tree off the highway that refused to move.

There was a breeze. I know there was a breeze. All the trees around this one were moving, just a gentle back and forth of their branches. This one was stuck. I guess it’s possible the trees around it were blocking the wind, but it was more than just not moving. It was stuck. Like pausing a movie. Even when something isn’t moving it has some sort of life to it, some imperceptible sense of change. This tree didn’t have that. 

I took off work and went to the doctor the next day, yelling at myself for normalizing the plane so quickly. I should’ve gone the second I stopped and confirmed it was frozen in air. Like I said, doctors scare me. I don’t like being poked and prodded just for the doctor to tell me I’m actually fine and not to worry. I figured it was time to get over that, though, considering at this point I was genuinely scared I was losing it. I have some health problems that run in my family. My Dad died of some heart thing they never really got to the bottom of, and his Dad before that. I didn’t think some genetic heart issues would translate to going insane but I’d be willing to go with just about any theory that made a semblance of sense.

The doctor told me exactly what I expected to hear. Physically I was fine. I could tell she wanted to just ship me off to a shrink, but I insisted the problem had to be more material. I did do a psych evaluation, but that turned up nothing besides the obvious. Sure I was acting strange, but that all related back to the stuck things, easily explained by stress, nothing to imply why I was seeing them in the first place. After squabbling over a brain scan for what felt like hours the doctor relented, warning me that insurance would most likely not cover it. I told her I didn’t care and would pay out of pocket if I had too.

I never want to do an MRI again. I think I’d rather let my brain rot if fixing it meant going back in that donut of hell. If you don’t know, an MRI machine is LOUD, like can’t hear your own thoughts loud. Weird rhythmic thunking and clanging noises just driving into your head. I won’t embarrass myself by trying to type out the sounds but trust me, they’re awful. I was in there for 30 seconds of my 20 minute scan before waves of panic washed over me, made worse by the pads and tape that were immobilizing my head. I didn’t think I was claustrophobic when I went in there, but I sure as hell do now.

The worst part of it was that the MRI showed us… nothing. I guess it showed us something by showing us nothing. The scan came up clean. There was no tumor, no shadow, nothing. So either things really are getting stuck, or I’m just going crazy.

I went home. I put up all my PTO, told work I had a family emergency, and got on the road. Pulled an 8 hour drive in one go. I nearly ran out of gas but I really didn’t want to stop. The more I moved the less chance I saw something stuck. I still saw them though. I counted three on the drive. A sign on a chain link fence, a bush next to a stop sign, and a section of a wheat field. All frozen. I wonder how many I missed. I have to assume there’s more I just never saw. 

I felt better after a few days at home. A nostalgic sense of normalcy was exactly what my head needed. Even just a change of scenery seemed to help. For the last half of the drive or so, I didn’t see any of the stuck things. Either my brain just started to calm down on the way back home, or the stuck things were somehow localized. I don’t know which one I was hoping for, but I didn’t really care. The stuck things felt far away, and that brought me some peace.

My Mom wasn’t totally sure what was going on, but she was happy to have me home. I hinted at what was going on with the stuck things, but dropped it when I could tell she wouldn’t understand. I ended up just telling her work had been stressful and I needed a reset, which seemed to satisfy her. 

Three days into my impromptu vacation I felt good enough to go out. I called up a few high school friends and asked if they could hang out. I don’t make it back home that often, so even though they have their own lives to pay attention to, three of them managed to make time, which I appreciated. We went and saw a movie, which ended up being a mistake. As we walked into the theater, I saw my first stuck person.

I just glimpsed her out of the corner of my eye at first. A woman sitting on a bench, presumably waiting for someone. I barely saw her, but the fraction of a second I did was enough. I’m too good at spotting the stuck things. I could just tell something was wrong. I couldn’t look back, I just kept my head straight and walked right into the theater. My stomach dropped, and I spent the movie fighting off a panic attack. Did the stuck things follow me here? Am I causing them? Are they actually everywhere but nobody else notices? Did I really see that woman or am I stressing over nothing? I kept asking questions on repeat, knowing that I’d probably never get the answers I wanted so desperately. 

I also thought about the plane. I never considered it but it was sure to have at least two pilots, some flight attendants, passengers. Were all those people stuck? Or have they been panicking on board a frozen tin can in the sky for weeks? I hope they were frozen, if they weren’t they’d be dead by now. What about their families? They would have noticed them missing by now. Do stuck things just innately go unnoticed? Why can I see them? I spiraled with these questions for two hours, staring at the movie without watching it. 

When we left the theater she was still there. Any hope I had that I’d imagined the stuck woman, or just mis-saw her, vanished. There she was. Frozen in place, lifeless, people milling around her without a care in the word, not noticing the crack in reality sitting on the bench inches away from them. 

I ditched my friends. I don’t even remember what I told them, some excuse about my stomach hurting or something. We had plans to get dinner after the movie but there was no way I could act normal for another hour. I broke down when I got to my car. I didn’t dare drive for a while, the adrenaline and panic would’ve made me crash. I stayed there for almost an hour, thinking and trying not to think about everything. Objects getting stuck was horrifying on its own, but people? My head spun. Eventually I made it home and beelined past my Mom, promising to fill her in on the movie in the morning.

I think the only reason I was able to fall asleep was because my brain couldn’t stay awake. I don’t even remember going to bed, I just remember waking up. I wish I hadn’t.

It was nice for a few seconds when I woke up. In my morning grog I didn’t remember the previous night. When it came back to me I managed to stay calm about it, a good night's sleep will do that for you. I figured I’d just take the day one step at a time. Hit the bathroom, brush my teeth, go from there.

I sleep on my left arm, so waking up and not being able to feel it was nothing new. I dragged it out from under the pillow and started doing my standard shake routine to get some blood back into it. It didn’t wake up. I didn’t feel pins and needles. I kept shaking and I kept feeling nothing. As I blinked the weariness out of my eyes my mild confusion turned to horror. That distinct lack of life was attached to me at the elbow. My arm was stuck.

I slammed it on the bed, then the desk. I smashed it into my desk harder and harder, trying to feel anything. I heard a knock on my door. My Mom was awake and wondering about the noise. I lied and told her I was fine, that I dropped something under my desk. I don’t think she totally believed me, but she went away anyway. I sat down and set my arm across the desktop like it was an operating table. I flicked my arm, then I punched it. Nothing. I moved on to the fingers, trying to bend them. Forward, backwards, sideways, I would have killed for any kind of movement, but none of them would relent. I grabbed a pencil and started pushing the sharpened end into my palm. I pushed harder and harder until the lead snapped, but my skin didn’t even flex. 

I rooted around in my desk drawer looking for something stronger. I found a sewing needle in the corner and pulled it out, aiming the tip at the fatty part of my hand beneath the thumb. Holding the needle at a right angle, I pushed. Slowly, the tip of the needle broke my skin. The only thought going through my head was relief that something could interact with my frozen arm. I pushed harder, and the needle went deeper into my hand. I don’t know what I was hoping for, but it felt like if I could do this, my arm wasn’t quite lost.

I kept pushing. An inch, an inch in a half, finally the needle started to press against my skin from the other side. I guess I managed to miss the bone of my thumb. The needle started to feel warm. I could feel something! I figured that meant I was doing something right. The spot where the needle pushed against the skin got bigger as it stretched up, looking like a tiny tent on the back of my hand. Eventually I ran out of needle, with just the eye of it sticking out of my palm. I pushed on it but all that did was dig into the fingers on my free hand with no progress. The needle felt like it was burning at this point, and I welcomed the pain. If I could feel anything, I wasn’t truly stuck. 

I picked my arm up with my right hand, and slammed it on the desk, aiming for the eye of the needle to hit first. It worked. The tip of the needle burst through the tent of skin on the back of my hand, and feeling rushed through my arm. Pain mostly. The tiny holes the needle was lodged in began slowly bleeding. I started to cry, equally from pain and relief. 

My Mom started knocking on my door again, having heard the final slam on the desk. I told her I was fine and begged her to just give me a few minutes, I’d come out and explain everything. She hesitantly agreed and I heard her walk off. I dug out a multitool from my desk and unfolded the pliers. The eye of the needle was buried in my thumb, so I had to grab it by the tip, dragging the slightly wider eye all the way through the flesh of my hand. 

Once it was out I examined my hand, flexing the fingers and turning it over. It looked fine enough, minus the two pinpricks of blood on the front and back. The pain was awful but manageable. I could wiggle my thumb a little, but didn’t because it hurt too much. I somehow managed to miss something critical, thank god.

I found my mom sitting at the kitchen island. She noticed the blood dripping off my hand and started to dote on me, filling the silence with questions.

I told her everything. The plane, the tree, the woman, and my arm. I didn’t have the creativity or will to lie to her. Maybe I should have, she looks at me a little different now. There’s always a shadow of pity and concern in her eyes. She took me to the hospital that day, and I ended up in the psych ward, the needle being considered self harm and all. I tried to explain it was necessary but that just made me look more crazy. 

That was 5 months ago. I’m still at home. I let my job know I wasn’t coming back and my mom hired a couple of my high school buddies to go get my stuff from my apartment. She told me I could move back when I got better but I don’t think that’s going to happen. I see stuck things all the time now. I think they were always there, but nobody knows how to look for them. Besides me of course. 

I mostly spot them on my way to the psychiatrist. Trees, traffic lights, cars, trash, everything. There’s more stuck things with every trip, and every stuck thing is still there when I pass by again. I go to the psychiatrist twice a week now. Each appointment I have a new stuck thing to tell him about. He says he believes me, but he’s lying. That’s ok, I lie to him when I say I haven’t needed to use the needles again. The holes are tiny, and you can hardly notice them unless you’re looking closely. Dozens of pinpricks litter the webs of my hands and feet now. I don’t know how or why but piercing all the way through makes them unstuck. Luckily I only have to do it once a week or so. 

It’s getting more frequent though. I know I’m on my way out. I know I’ll get more and more stuck, and nobody will believe me, and one day I’ll wake up with a part of me stuck that I can’t fix.

I’ve been thinking about my Dad recently, and his mystery heart thing the doctors never figured out. I’ve been thinking about what the doctor told us, which meant nothing then but means everything now. 

“His heart just… stopped”
