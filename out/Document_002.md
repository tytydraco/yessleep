**Interrogation Transcript: Subject - Stitches**

**Date: [Insert Date]**

**Location: Research Facility, ████████**

**Interrogators: Dr. ██████, Dr. ███████**

**Subject: Stitches**

**Background:**

Stitches is a mysterious entity with formidable powers, including the ability to regenerate his body from a single molecule, manipulate tendrils of black blood, and assimilate traits from consumed opponents. He was captured by a team of scientists and brought to a secure research facility for study and interrogation.

**Transcript:**

[The interrogation room is dimly lit, with a single table and two chairs set up facing each other. Stitches is restrained in a specialized containment unit, his pale form illuminated by a faint glow.]

Dr. ██████: Good evening, Stitches. We appreciate you cooperating with our interrogation.

Stitches: [His voice is a chilling blend of politeness and menace.] Of course, doctor. I'm always eager to make new acquaintances.

Dr. ███████: Let's get straight to the point, shall we? We're interested in learning more about your origins and capabilities.

Stitches: Ah, my origins. A tale as old as time itself, doctor. I am but a product of experimentation, a creation born from the depths of human ambition and folly.

Dr. ██████: Experimentation? Can you elaborate on that?

Stitches: [Chuckling softly.] Oh, I'm afraid it's a rather lengthy story, doctor. Suffice it to say, I was once a mere mortal like yourselves, until I stumbled upon certain... opportunities for enhancement.

Dr. ███████: Enhancement? You mean your powers?

Stitches: Precisely, doctor. Through a series of... shall we say, unconventional methods, I have acquired abilities far beyond those of ordinary beings.

Dr. ██████: And what about your ability to assimilate traits from consumed opponents? How does that work?

Stitches: Ah, a fascinating subject indeed. You see, when I consume an opponent, their essence becomes a part of me, granting me access to their strengths and abilities. It's quite... invigorating, really.

Dr. ███████: Invigorating? You mean to say that you enjoy consuming others?

Stitches: [Smiling ominously.] Enjoy? Perhaps that's not the right word, doctor. But I must admit, there is a certain satisfaction in expanding one's horizons, wouldn't you agree?

[The interrogators exchange uneasy glances, sensing the underlying menace in Stitches' words.]

Dr. ██████: Let's move on to your regeneration abilities. How exactly are you able to regenerate from a single molecule?

Stitches: Ah, regeneration. It's a simple matter of... rearranging the pieces, so to speak. You humans are so fond of categorizing things into neat little boxes. But in truth, the boundaries between life and death are far more... flexible than you realize.

Dr. ███████: Flexible boundaries? What do you mean by that?

Stitches: [Leaning forward.] I mean that life and death are but two sides of the same coin, doctor. And with the right tools and knowledge, one can traverse the divide with ease.

[The interrogators exchange a wary glance, realizing the implications of Stitches' words.]

Dr. ██████: Well, I think that's enough for now. Thank you for your cooperation, Stitches. We'll be in touch.

Stitches: [Smirking.] Oh, I'm sure we will, doctor. After all, our little chat has only just begun.

[The interrogators exit the room, leaving Stitches alone in the dimly lit confines of his containment unit.]
