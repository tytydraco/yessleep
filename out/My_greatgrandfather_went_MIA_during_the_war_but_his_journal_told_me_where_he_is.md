My mother and I were cleaning out my 93-year-old Mawmaw’s house after she passed, getting it ready to sell. In the attic, I stumbled upon an old wooden chest buried under dusty boxes. Inside were a folded American flag, some medals, and a journal—all in perfect condition, almost untouched by time. Here’s the strange part: my mother always said my great-grandfather and his squad-mates were never found after an assignment, so I assumed they were MIA in combat. But after reading his journal, I realized that wasn’t the case at all.

 

**August 28, 1899**

It’s been a few weeks since I last heard the sweet voice of my Ruby, and oh, how I miss her.

My thoughts often drift to her swollen belly, our unborn child, and the plans we made for after this mission. Louisiana was supposed to be our new home once I returned—war or no war, I promised her that much. Yet here I am, in this forsaken ruin, the Spanish Fort, which should’ve long been left to rot.

They say it’s strategic, but I’ve yet to see any sense in that. We ain’t seen hide nor hair of an enemy. Sergeant Harris got the orders, though he seems just as puzzled as the rest of us. He’s a solid man, Harris, but there’s a look in his eye I don’t care for. Maybe it’s just the quiet here—too much of it.

The air feels... wrong, heavy, like it’s watching us.

Orders were simple: *report any anomalous activity*.

What that means, none of us rightly know. But I can’t help but think we’re here for something more than they’re telling us.

**September 1, 1899**

Fort’s falling apart at the seams.

Wall’s crumbling, place is a damned wreck.

We’ve been patrolling day and night, but it’s dead as a graveyard. Richards keeps griping about how this whole thing’s a waste of time, and maybe he’s right. Still, Hunter takes it all too serious-like, creeping around every corner as if an army’s about to pop out of the shadows.

But it’s Jameson that’s got me worried. He’s been here longer than any of us, but the man’s been spooked ever since we arrived. Pale, eyes hollowed out, muttering about “the voices.” I asked him what he meant by that, but all he did was look at me like I’d find out soon enough.

Ain’t no comfort in that, I can tell you.

**September 5, 1899**

It was late last night when things took a turn.

Hunter and I were on watch when we heard it—soft, like someone whispering from a distance. It didn’t make sense. The fort’s been empty for years, but there it was. We scoured the perimeter, found nothing, just that voice slipping away like smoke.

When we told Harris, he brushed us off, tried to act like it was nothing. But I saw his hands shake, just for a second. Something’s not right here.

Jameson gave me that same look again—like he’s known this all along.

**September 8, 1899**

Jameson finally cracked, pulled me aside last night after everyone else had turned in.

He’s been hearing things since the day he set foot here, he says. Voices, whispers, just like the ones Hunter and I heard. I told him it was just the wind, but he swore up and down it wasn’t.

“It’s them,” he said.

What he meant by that, he wouldn’t say. Left me with a knot in my gut that ain’t gone away since.

**September 12, 1899**

Sergeant Harris broke his silence today.

Turns out, we ain’t the first ones to be stationed at this godforsaken fort. There were others before us, sent here for some ‘observation missions.’ Most of ’em never made it back. Disappeared, or left their posts, according to Harris.

He was told to keep quiet about it, but with all that’s been happening, he couldn’t hold it in no more. He said this place has got a reputation, that people say it’s haunted. Haunted or not, something’s definitely wrong.

The whispers... they’re getting louder.

**September 15, 1899**

Jameson found a chamber.

God knows how he came across it, but it’s been buried under rubble for who knows how long. He took me there just before dawn. Inside, we found old uniforms, rusted weapons, and bones. More bones than I care to think about.

Jameson stood there, white as a sheet.

“This is where they are,” he whispered.

“They never left.”

I wanted to run, hell, I *should’ve* run, but Jameson wouldn’t budge. Says the fort’s cursed, that what happened to those soldiers is happening to us.

**September 18, 1899**

Jameson’s gone.

Just like that.

One minute he was here, the next—nothing. We searched every inch of the fort, but there’s no sign of him. Only thing left was his jacket near that chamber. Richards is close to losing his mind, keeps saying we need to leave before it’s too late.

Harris, though—he’s sticking to orders like a drowning man clinging to driftwood. The whispers... they’re following us now.

Sometimes I think I hear Jameson’s voice among them, calling out from the dark.

**September 22, 1899**

I don’t know how much longer I can do this.

The fort feels alive, like it’s breathing down our necks, watching every move we make. Harris is falling apart, trying to keep us in line, but it’s no use. Hunter won’t speak anymore, and Richards... well, Richards isn’t far behind him.

The voices—they ain’t just in the air anymore. They’re in our heads, calling us by name.

How long before they call me too?

**September 24, 1899**

Found another door today, hidden in the old barracks. Behind it were more bones, and an inscription on the wall:

*We are the forgotten. Do not seek us.*

It felt like a warning, like it was meant for us, though we ignored it.

Hunter’s convinced we ain’t supposed to be here, and I’m starting to think he’s right. But it’s too late for second thoughts now.

**September 26, 1899**

Richards is gone.

Left in the middle of the night, no note, no nothing.

All we found were his tracks leading off into the woods. Harris sent us to search, but it was a waste of time. Hunter’s barely holding it together. Keeps muttering that we’re being hunted, and I’m starting to think he’s right.

The whispers—they’re louder now, clearer. Sometimes I hear footsteps too, but when I look, there’s no one there.

**September 28, 1899**

Three of us left.

Harris, Hunter, and me.

We don’t talk about the others, not anymore. Last night, we heard something moving in the fort, heavy steps echoing through the walls. Harris went to check, but he came back shaking like a leaf. He won’t say what he saw, but whatever it was, it’s only a matter of time now.

Hunter ain’t slept in days. He says we were sent here to contain something, something dark, and I’m starting to believe him.

**September 30, 1899**

It’s happening.

Harris is holding on by a thread, clinging to duty like it’s all he’s got. But there ain’t no mission left, not really. Just survival. Hunter won’t leave the gatehouse, says something’s coming for us, the same thing that took Jameson, Richards, and God knows who else.

The whispers—they’re so loud now, it’s like they’re right beside us. Harris keeps talking about orders, about relief coming, but I don’t think anyone’s coming for us.

I think we were sent here to be forgotten.

**October 3, 1899**

I’m the last one now.

Harris, Hunter…

They’re gone.

Vanished like the others. The whispers—they won’t stop. They’re calling my name, telling me it’s time. I hear Jameson’s voice in the dark, telling me to come to the chamber.

I don’t know how much longer I can hold out. Whatever’s here, it’s been waiting for us all along, and now it’s calling me home.

May God be with me.

**October 5, 1899**

After months in this sweltering heat, these islands don’t seem so bad anymore. The lads are in good spirits, joking around like old times.

Harris has been keeping us steady as always, barking orders but with a grin.

Richards keeps talking about heading back to New York after this, says he misses the noise of the city and the hustle of Manhattan. He’s had his fill of the Philippines, says he can’t stand the heat, the mosquitoes, or the dampness that clings to everything.

Hunter’s been quieter, but that’s always been his way—watchful, thinking things through. Keeps his thoughts close.

Jameson...

Well, Jameson’s been restless. He keeps saying we’ve got more work to do here, that the insurgents are still hiding out in the hills, waiting for us to drop our guard.

But I reckon we’re nearly done here.

**October 7, 1899**

I got a letter from Ruby. Our daughter’s here now, a little baby girl, can you believe it?

She gave birth last week, and I’m already picturing her in my arms. I’ll be holding her soon enough. They’ve named her Myra, after my mother. Sweet thing, I can almost hear her little cries.

Ruby says she’s the spitting image of me—poor girl, she’ll have to grow into the nose, I suppose. I can’t wait to meet her, to see the way she looks at me when I walk through that door in Louisiana.

We’ll be a family.

A real family.

**October 10, 1899**

You know, it’s strange, but I had this dream last night.

Myra, all grown up, wearing a white dress, a veil over her face. She was getting married, standing at the altar, and I could hardly believe it—how fast the time had gone. Harris and Richards were there, laughing, patting me on the back, saying, *“Can you believe it? She’s all grown up!”*

It felt so real. And when I saw her, my little girl all grown, I wept like a fool. I think she even kissed me on the cheek before walking down the aisle, telling me, *“I love you, Pawpaw.”*

Isn’t that something?

**April 13, 1979**

Thank the good Lord it’s Friday! The boys are coming over for a few beers!

Would you look at that—I can’t believe I still have this log book after all these years. Been sitting in the dresser all this time, just waiting for me to remember it. Funny how life sneaks up on you like that. Myra’s all grown now, married, and with a baby on the way. I reckon Melinda’s a fine name for a girl, but at my age, what do I know? Hard to wrap my head around the thought of being a grandfather soon.

Retirement, well, it doesn’t much suit a man like me, but I suppose I’m finally ready to hang up my hat. Ruby’s been after me to tidy up my old service things—calls it sentimental value, and I guess she’s right.

Just got to track down the rest of my decorations now.

 

That was the last entry.

I’m not sure what to make of it. According to my mother, my great-grandfather never made it back home. She said she never got to meet him. The strange part is, they were stationed at Spanish Fort, right here in New Orleans, Louisiana. But in his last journal entries, he wrote as if they were in Southeast Asia, during the Philippine-American War in 1899. Was he confused? Did he enter the chamber? How did the journal even make it back to my family? I have so many questions, but no one left to answer them now that my grandmother has passed.

Still, the journal revealed much about the man he was—a loving husband, a good father, and a true friend. I only wish I could tell him “He’s never forgotten.” But I find comfort knowing he’s happy, wherever he is.
