Log book of Det. Ryan Snow
Case #2798: the Appalachian Murders
Description of enclosed evidence: One bloody, torn up, blue and green guest book retrieved from suspect.

I have read through the guest book entries during the time Kate Blackwell (only survivor and possible suspect of the Appalachian Murders during the week of 09/20/2017-09/26/2017) and her friends were staying in one of the three cabins owned by Cloud Nine Vacation Rentals in the Appalachian Mountains. It appears the group wrote in it each day leading up to the murders, recording everything happening within the cabin.

The first entry was written by Blackwell, stating that the cabin was beautiful and that she was looking forward to the rest of the week. The next entry was written by Paul Woolfe asking about the attic, stating that the group was hearing sounds, but the door was locked. They pass it off as an animal having getting itself stuck up there, but that the girls would be asking the land lord, a Mrs. Alba Larson, for a key to get it out. Note: Mrs. Larson had indeed owned the three cabins in those mountains, but had passed away in 2005 and the property was bought by Cloud Nine Vacation Rentals not long after when no next of kin was found. 

The entries that followed are when my concerns for the well being of not just Ms. Blackwell, but the rest of the group as well began. It was written on the same day as when Ms. Blackwell and Sonja Greymoore said they'd be going to speak to Mrs. Larson about the attic. I will be attaching the more concerning entries to this log, only giving my commentary during points of no consequence to the murders. I will also be attaching the earlier entries from before Blackwell's arrival to see if I can find any similarities between each guests' stay. As far as I know, there have been several missing persons cases concerning that area, however, it is common for people to go missing in the Appalachian Mountains on a daily basis, most of which go cold. One of the only known murders to occur in either of the three cabins happened in 2010. The suspect, a Mr. Leighton Raines, pleaded guilty to the death of his fianc√©, Mrs. Bonnie "Bunny" Collins and was given life in prison with no chance of parole. Mrs. Collins was found with her torso cut open and her heart missing. Mr. Raines was in the corner of the room they were found in covered in Mrs. Collins' blood. The couple wrote in the guest book as well. All others before and after were never found or heard from again, but again, those cases went cold and it was speculated that their fates were left to the mountains. 

However, I'd be lying if I said most of these entries were not the least bit concerning.

Guest book entries from Cabin #2 of Cloud Nine Vacation Rentals in the Appalachian Mountains concerning the murders that took place during the dates between 09/20/2017-09/26/2017

Entry #3 09/21/2017- This was recorded the second day of the groups' time in the cabin. The group was hearing sounds in the attic that was locked, group believed it was an animal, so Ms. Blackwell and Ms. Greymoore went to ask the land lord for a way to the attic. This entry is believed to have been written by Ms. Greymoore. 

The land lady wasn't in her house. We tried to look in through the window to see if she was in there, but the place looked empty. Kate tried to call her, but she's not answering. We're going to try finding out who this lady is and really give her a piece of our mind! The boys are saying that they're going to try breaking in to the attic and get whatever is up there out. Kate and Jasper are worried about getting in trouble, but I'm not going to sleep with all that noise over my head!

Entry #4 09/21/2017- After some analysis of the handwriting, it's believed this was written by Jasper Steele. 

We apologize for the attic door. We were able to get it open and we thankfully didn't find an animal, but that noise is still concerning us. It stopped and we didn't find anything up there, but we're a little freaked out. Is this some kind of prank? 

Entry #5 09/21/2017- Written by Ms. Blackwell

There's was a fucking Ouija Board up in the attic! Hell to the fuck no! First the noises the origins of which we no not, now there's a Oujia Board! Where's that land lady?

Note: During my first successful interrogation of Ms. Blackwell, she told me about the night they played with the Ouija board and that they stopped playing when it answered a question she asked correctly. Ms. Blackwell was not directly playing the game and she asked a question about what she was thinking about in that moment they were playing. It was after this night she states things got worse. Based on the entries here on, I believe her friends would share this sentiment.

Entry #6 09/22/2017- Handwriting analysis points to this entry was written by Paul Woolfe. 

We still can't reach the land lord. She's still no where to be found at her house. We tried patching the attic door up as best we could, but the lock is still broken. We put the Ouija board away because it was scaring Kate, but we didn't put it back in the attic. Luke wants to play it again when things settle back down, but there's still noises coming from in the house. We're looking around for what's making these sounds, but we can't find where they'd be coming from. I'm just gonna say this place is way old and not caught up on any safety regulations.

Note: To save time, the next entries to follow for the next two days are about the group complaining about the faulty wiring and possible tilt of the cabin due to lights turning on and off depending on how they were left before a person left a room or an item being placed somewhere they didn't leave it. Ms. Blackwell told me of all this as well. The entry I'm attaching after this is presumably when Ms. Blackwell told me about Ms. Greymoore wanting to leave because of her boyfriend, Luke Billings, being caught cheating on her with multiple girls. I will be doing a search on each of these girls during the time of this investigation to see what they knew of Luke and his relationship to each of these victims and Ms. Blackwell. 

Entry #10 09/24/2017- Written by Ms. Greymoore

I hated it here. I hope this old bitch loses money and goes bankrupt. The fucking sounds, the God damn voices, and now Luke wants to get violent! I'm never coming back to this place ever again! Everyone here can bite me! 

Entry #11 09/24/2017- Written by Ms. Blackwell. During interrogation, she stated that it was midnight when this event took place, hence the sudden date change.

She was out there. The land lord. She was outside, just standing there like she was waiting for Sonja and I to get to my car. Paul and Luke went to talk to her, but she ended up stabbing Paul. Luke says she slashed our tires. She's still just standing there. We can't call anyone because there's no service now. We stopped Paul's bleeding as best we could and are trying to get him to rest. We're going to take shifts watching the land lord. If she tries anything, we agreed to wake the rest up and try ambushing her. I'm so sorry... I just wanted to go on vacation with my friends one more time...

Entry #12 09/24/2017- The next entries will be of the group going on shifts, recording each hour the supposed Mrs. Larson just stands outside the cabin. The first is recorded by Jasper Steele. 

1:00 am. No movement detected.

Entry #13 09/24/2017- Written by Mr. Billings 

2:00 am. No movement detected. 

Entry #14 09/24/2017- Written by Ms. Greymoore 

3:00 am. Land lord looks at the knife before looking back to cabin. No movement from here on. 

Entry #15 09/24/2017- Written by Ms. Blackwell 

4:00 am. No movement, but I hear the voices. They keep telling me to go outside. I won't do it. I don't want to. Not with her out there. Why is this happening? 

Entry #16 09/24/2017- Written by Mr. Steele 

5:00 am. She looks at knife before back to cabin. The voices we keep hearing are telling me to blame Kate for bringing us here. I don't. 

Entry #17 09/24/2017- Written by Mr. Billings

6:00 am. Sun starts coming up. Land lord looks at it and shuffles off into the woods. No idea where she went. Paul's wound is bleeding through the rags we used to stop the bleeding, but he's breathing and is staying aware. Sonja hasn't spoken to me. She's sleeping as far from me as possible near Kate. I didn't mean to... Hit Kate or Sonja for that matter... I just... These voices... They won't shut up... I know how Sonja felt about Kate, but... She was with me... I just thought... I... I thought I could get back at her for cheating on me, but it all just spiraled... I'm sorry... I'm sorry... I'm sorry... 

Entry #18 09/24/2017- Written by Mr. Woolfe

The land lord slashed all of our tires, even the spares. We're going to the trails to get to high ground to try get cell service. If we don't get back home when we told our families we would, we're either lost somewhere on the Appalachian Mountains or that land lord did something to us. Please let us find a way out of this.

Note: There is one more entry written in the guest book. However, it appears to have been written by Ms. Blackwell after the murders took place. She told me that it was when the group returned to the cabin and found the Ouija board on the coffee table that that's when things got blurry for her. I will try to get her to give me a more detailed explanation of that night. If I can get her lawyer, Mrs. Mayfield, away from her long enough that is. 

Mr. Steele had been found in the attic, the door shut and locked. It looked like he'd been attacked by some kind of animal; torn and his limbs scattered about the attic. Mr. Billings was found in the living room next to the coffee table where the Ouija board was with a head wound. Hikers found Mr. Woolfe dead from possible blood loss and his body picked off by wild life, his mother identified him by the tattoo of a sword on his arm. And Ms. Greymoore was found in a shallow grave with a piece of paper in her hands near a cave, the grave marked by a stone with a bloody hand print which was found to be Ms. Blackwell's. The back of Ms. Greymoore's head was found caved in and her spine broken. It's assumed she fell and died shortly after. It's believed Ms. Blackwell buried her with the note before making her to the road where she was found. The paper she used came from the guest book.

The note read: Sonja Greymoore, 18. My family lives in Fayetteville, North Carolina. My dad is Owen Greymoore, he works at Kelly's Tires and Tune Ups. There's four others. One is somewhere out here in the woods, two are in Cabin #2 on 3000 Fairy Wood Lane, and the last one is either wandering somewhere around these mountains, dead, or was found by police. Please get us home. 

Ms. Blackwell had been picked up by the teens the day before her friends were found. There were no other people, living or dead, found in those mountains. This thing Ms. Blackwell says is to blame for her friends' death is still unknown. I will need to do even more digging as it seems, based on the other entries before this case, there is a pattern to these cabins. I will contact Cloud Nine Rentals once I understand more of these cabins' histories. 

The last entry made by Ms. Blackwell in the guest books reads:

09/30/2017... I think... 

If anyone finds this, my name is Kate Blackwell. I invited my friends on vacation before we went our seperate ways to college. There names were Sonja Greymoore, Jasper Steele, Paul Woolfe, and Luke Billings. I buried Sonja near a rock with my hand print on it. Paul is somewhere near one of the trails. Luke and Jasper are in Cabin #2 on 3000 Fairy Wood Lane. I'm not entirely sure who killed them all, but I was the one who brought them here... It was all my fault... I should have just let them go... Being alone would have been worth it if it meant they'd still be around... I should have trusted we'd stay in touch... It's all my fault... I'm sorry... I'm so, so sorry... If I die out here, I deserve it... If anyone finds me... I'm sorry to everyone's families... It was my fault and I wish I could take it back... I want to take it all back... I'm sorry... I'm sorry    I'm sorry     I'm sorry 

Note: The phrase "I'm sorry" continues on until Ms. Blackwell runs out of ink.

Note: I'll need to question Mr. Raines, see if I can get more details on his case from his perspective. It almost sounds similar to Ms. Blackwell's. There may be someone else involved. I will update more in this log when I get more information.

Case #2798: the Appalachian Murders
Description of enclosed evidence: One bloody, torn up, blue and green guest book retrieved from suspect.

I don't know what the hell just happened. I had received a call from an unknown number on my work land line. The reception was awful, but I could make out that it was male, possibly of an older age. He sounded upset, asking for a female and begging I "bring her back." The way he spoke didn't sound demanding. He sounded upset. Like a child who had their toy taken away and they were pleading to get it back. I assumed he was talking about Ms. Blackwell, but I never got any real helpful information from him. 

Front desk had received the call first, the operator saying he sounded normal when she picked up. He had asked to speak to me, but refused to give a name, telling the operator the call was classified and that it was information meant only for me. He wasn't on the line long enough for the station to track where he was calling from. 

However, all of that wasn't what was bothering me about this whole interaction. He had called me "Lucky Dime." Only one person ever called me that and there's no way anyone would know that except my parents and I rarely speak to them. Whoever this was, knew more than even my closest friends and I don't have any of those. 

To hell with Mrs. Mayfield, I need to speak to Ms. Blackwell. Now.
