I was laughing menacingly. I would finally fool the entire world. I had a devious prank. I was just a douche I guess.

**It had been two weeks and after extensive planning I had put together the best prank.**  
**I would fake my own death, disguise myself and send creepy emails to my parents from my(supposedly dead) email id. The same night I would enter my house through the window and scare my parents.**

That was supposed to be my plan but I was now encaptured and hoarded by creatures. My best option to escape torture was my own death.  
Here is what happened in the past 24 hours.  

I brought my mannequin and seared it with animal blood.  To make it seem like I had died due to a car accident I had twisted the mannequin's face and put some bruises but still kept the mannequin's face(my face) recognisable. Lastly I called my best friend Trev and told him about my plan but he took a lot of convincing to give into. The forensic report would come a day later and by that time my prank would be over. This was perfect!

Everything was going in order. My mannequin was found 3 blocks from my home my small neighbourhood near the infamous red pine forest. I was reported to be in a car accident and even made it to the local news. My parents came to my burial. But here is where things go south. At about 11:30a.m. my parents got out of their car and walked down to the site of burial. The look of fear, terror and horror that had enveloped my mother's face. Her eyes were red and filled with tears and her face had deep, dark eye circles. Her mouth was wide open and when she saw my mannequin, she could take it no more. She died due to heart attack when she saw my mutilated corpse. What a lovely mother and woman she was! She was an extrovert  and had many friends, she did not deserve to die, I did. All of this was too much for my father Mr.Justin Winston. H sorrowfully limped across the cemetery and left the neighborhood with his car, our lovely red Camry. I had no idea whether he would return or not and how much time he would return after. After my burial I darted across the cemetery with the sun about to set. I had disguised myself as a 25 year old man with a beard and a hat. I wore a blue coat and white shirt along with blue pants which overall was a formal attire with a business card which stated my name as Mr.Paul Brinsky. I reached my home  and cried on my bed till I fell asleep. It was then when I woke up to the sound of the house door opening.  
Before I proceed ahead I would like to tell you about a rule, which had been drilled into my brain since I was a child. As long as I can remember my parents had told me to sleep before 10 in the night. They used to hand me over my headphones saying that listening to music would help me fall asleep. Through  these years I had heard few noises like hissing, scratching and sometimes thumping or walking. Sometimes when it got to extreme I could here faint knocking and raspy voices. But had never given any thought to them. I would simply clutch my blanket so tightly and fall asleep. had always religiously followed the rule.

But  today as I lay on my bed, I heard the sound of the door creaking open. I felt a sense of relief thinking that my father was back but something felt wrong. Something felt terribly wrong.  
I live in a flat on the 2nd floor and my room is situated at the other end of the flat. So when I heard the thud of heavy footsteps I checked the time.  
It was 10:16 p.m. I heard hissing which was getting louder. I was sure that whoever or whatever was walking across the kitchen was not my father.  
Covering my mouth with a trembling hands I ran in a panicked frenzy. I carefully tip toed and jumped out of my balcony and landed on the ground. I carefully sneaked into the basement through the back of the building but felt like something followed me. When I turned around, I could see a 4 foot tall creature. The eyes were wide open and orange in colour with a tinge of yellow. There was this faint glow in its eyes which was mesmerizing...so mesmerizing. If I could just forget my troubles and kept staring at those eyes for eternity... It's mouth was wide open showing big black teeth. Instead of hands it had four black tentacles. It began to grunt and then roar. I could here other creatures roaring back at it.  
They were coming for me. It was then that my adrenaline helped me to run across the huge basement to the lift on the other side. Our basement was no less than a big maze. Heaps of unused pipes, metal sheets, garbage along with discarded clothes, beds and what not. Adding to this were racks of cars parked across the half a mile huge basement.

A hand rested on my shoulders. I had accepted my fate and turned around when I saw Trev. Trev explained how he had seen my mother die and had tried to find my dad. Searching for my dad he had reached my home at 2:30p.m. but had not found me there. When he returned back to my house it was 10:05p.m. and before he could wake me up he noticed one of those creatures crawling towards the entrance. Luckily he shifted me who was fast asleep below the bed and sneaked out in the same manner as I did. While jumping he looked through one of the big windows into the lobby of the building. Crawling across the whole floor were many creatures ranging from 4 feet of height to 8. This was trouble. He found a good spot near the lift of the basement and waited for me unsure about what to do.

  
Now I understood the strict rule about sleeping before 10 p.m. I thought my parents were being strict telling me to sleep early but it was otherwise. We couldn't use the lift, it was too risky. What if the creatures were already in the lift? We hid behind a big orange traffic cone which was behind piles of garbage. But I could here the roars get louder and louder. They could smell our flesh. We had to make a run for the lift. There was no other chance. Dashing across the dirty concrete of the basement we reached the lift and pressed the top floor.

  
Trev and I were creeped out about all of these events, these supernatural occurrences. But to our luck, upon scanning the lift for any kind of help we found a very small pinkish red button at the top wall of the lift. Trev pressed the button without any  hesitation after all what more could we lose? Slowly the side of the lift opposite to the doors opened revealing a series of tunnels from the lift.

  
We had almost reached the 12th floor and I could here the creatures desperately trying to rip apart the lift. We had no other option. We made a run for the tunnels and the entry to the tunnels from the lift closed. At the same time the front side of the lift opened at the 12th floor revealing 5-6 of these horrendous creatures. They were 7 to 8 feet tall unlike the one in the basement.

  
These weird metallic tunnels lead to big metallic caves. After an hour of searching here are a couple of revelations we made:  
-There are multiple such caves and seem to never end.  
-We found the mutilated bodies of Gemma, Serene, Jacob and many more of our classmates which had gone missing over the span of few years. Each of their body seemed to be infected and had a greenish tinge. So this is how the town hid the dark secret of this building... By hiding the infected bodies.  
-There was some food and small container. Seems like somebody is living here.

  
I am writing this on my mobile right now which has 12% battery. We have survived on the little food I had in the deep pockets of my coat in case of any emergency due to my prank. The creatures bang at the entrance every now and then. I have tried to find a pattern but it is completely random. Food is running out, Trev is feeling a little dizzy. I have no idea where dad is, I am too scared to go back to the entrance of the lift. I am posting this here anonymously in hopes of any sort of help.
