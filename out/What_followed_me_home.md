San Agustín Church. Almagro. Late winter 2023.

I don't know if what I experienced that night was real or a figment of my imagination, but since then I can't look at San Agustín Church without a chill running down my spine. I still wonder if someone else, hidden in the shadows, was watching me without my knowledge.

I looked at the time on my cell phone: eight o'clock sharp. The icy wind howled outside like a lone wolf, while inside the church only an ancient, dense silence reigned. I was the last one in the temple that Friday.

San Agustín, with its centuries-old walls, stood like a sleeping giant. Its faded frescoes seemed to watch me from another era. I wrapped myself in my black coat, my only armor against the treacherous cold, while my green scarf tightened around my neck like an uncomfortable but warm snake. “I can't wait for the day to end,” I thought as I checked the light switch.

The sigh that escaped me echoed through the naves like a faint protest against centuries of silence.

I was heading for the exit when I remembered: I had left my backpack in the office.

“Damn!” I muttered.

I went back inside. The cold seemed to have seeped into the stones, a different kind of cold that penetrated to the bone, as if something invisible had taken root in that place.

Then I heard it:

**Clong... clong... clong...**

Three sharp, metallic blows, spaced apart, with an echo that seemed to linger longer than normal... as if they did not belong only to the present, but to a remote time trapped within the walls. The lights flickered and, at the same time, a fine mist began to seep in from the end of the side corridor.

I stood still.

I remembered the stories that circulated about that place: the ghost of an Augustinian friar, dressed in a black habit, whom many claimed to have seen. They said he had lived in the 19th century and that, even after his death, he watched over the church to prevent its demolition. Several people swore they had felt his presence: the smell of incense, footsteps approaching, low voices speaking in Latin.

The air smelled of incense, but no one had lit it. I had the absurd certainty that if I stayed there a second longer, something would brush against my neck. I clenched my teeth and took a step toward the sacristy, and then I felt it: a pressure on my back, as if someone had placed their hand on me. It wasn't a firm touch at first, but a brief, icy caress that quickly turned into a decisive push, as if cold, bony fingers were gently closing around my coat.

I froze, unable to turn around.

And then I heard it.

It wasn't footsteps... it was like the rustling of a habit dragging across the stone floor, closer and closer... until it was right behind me.

The smell of incense grew stronger, and I was afraid that if I turned around, something would be there, so close that I could feel its breath. I wanted to move, but my body wouldn't obey me. It was as if that cold hand was also holding my will.

When I finally gathered the courage to look, there was no one there. Just a pale mist floating in the air and a silence so thick it hurt my ears.

I moved forward to the sacristy. I hesitated before opening the door. My heart was pounding, as if trying to warn me. Finally, I turned the key.

What I saw took my breath away: filing cabinets that should have been lined up were scattered across the floor, papers strewn about, folders open, a chair overturned, a crucifix fallen. I had checked it just two hours earlier: everything was perfectly tidy. No one else had the keys but me. It was impossible for anyone to have entered.

“What the hell...” I whispered, feeling my voice break between anger and fear.

I took out my cell phone and took pictures, as if I needed proof that this was real. I locked the door and turned around.

Then the knocking returned: **clong-clong-clong**, faster, more insistent, as if trying to drag me back there.

I took a deep breath, turned the key again, and opened the door.

The sight froze my blood: everything was in its place, as if invisible hands had played with my sanity. It was so perfect that it seemed fake, a scene hastily staged to hide what had happened. The scent of roses lingered in the air, soft but unmistakable.

Not even a minute had passed since I locked the door. Not a sound, not a rustle, not a shadow betrayed any activity, and yet everything looked as if it had just been put there.

With my phone trembling in my fingers, I checked the photos. They clearly showed the absolute chaos I had seen: filing cabinets on the floor, crumpled papers, open folders. There was the proof... and yet something inside me whispered that not even a picture could protect me from whatever had done this.

I left the church, closing the door behind me. As I walked home, the cold feeling on my back didn't go away.

I didn't want to tell anyone. Not in a town like Almagro, where stories fly and get distorted. I was afraid they would think I was crazy... or worse, that they would say it was all a hoax.

That night, on my sofa, I tried to convince myself that maybe I had imagined what had happened. But every time I came close to that idea, I felt as if something—or someone—was too close, listening.

And deep down, I knew that my life, from that night on, would never be the same.

That night, in bed, I could still feel the cold hand on my back. And that wasn't the worst of it.

The worst part was that I had the feeling that whatever had followed me to the door... hadn't stayed in the church.

At 3:15 in the morning, my phone vibrated. A photo notification. The system said, “New image saved.”

It was a photo of me. Sleeping.

And behind me... a black silhouette, with a hand resting on my shoulder:

It was smiling!
