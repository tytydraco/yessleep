Okay, it needs to be said. I am supposed to be dead. What has happened to me is not normal to any standard in our known universe, but I guess nothing’s impossible? 

I really don’t know where to begin with this but it’s been happening my entire life, I’ve only come to realize it once it happened again. 
When I was born, I came out perfectly healthy. My grandma claims I was a beautiful little girl with no issues in sight. When my parents were finally able to take me home from the hospital we got into a horrible accident. 

My father was driving and my mother was in the back next to me. I obviously have no recollection of the events that took place but I have been told, we were hit by a semi that was running a stop light. My parents were killed instantly, the car was crushed, I was crushed. 

When they were removing our bodies from the car, I started to cry. Bystanders were terrified at the state of me. My mushy little brain was half way out of my head and I was screaming at the top of my little lungs. After about 8 minutes it was like time had reversed through my body, no injuries at all, a perfectly healthy baby. 

This was just chalked up to be some freak thing that happened and inevitably I grew up. Now I could break my arm and I would have to wait those six weeks like anybody else, so I was never really seen as special or anything. But now I know that I am. I can’t die. I’m like Bruce Banner in this bitch, but it’s not that my body is resistant or I have an alter ego that brings me back, it’s like some time controlling force is keeping me alive. 

About 8 months ago was my 23rd birthday and I went out with some friends. We were drinking and having a good time when I noticed this guy staring at me from one of the tables. I instantly got the creeps, sure it’s normal for people to check you out at a bar but this guy just felt wrong. I asked my friends if we could leave and we did. We watched a few movies and had dinner at my place and it was over all a really good night. They were both drunk so I made them stay over, I have two guest beds so they didn’t argue. 

We’re all settled and sleeping, and I’m having some crazy dreams. I’m sitting at a long dinner table. In front of me is a dead deer with its innards exposed, I begin to eat it like a wild animal, tearing and digging at it as though I’ve never eaten before. It tastes good, it feels good, it’s like my whole body is experiencing a climax. Then the dream changes and I’m laying in shallow water. As soon as I go to sit up, the dream is over. 

I’m back in my room and I had a strange urge to check on my friends, it was still dark but the atmosphere of my home felt wrong. I go into the first bedroom and she was everywhere, it was like she was torn apart by wolves. I scream and run to the second bedroom. It’s the same, only I see the body of a man. He looked as though he ate some sort of bomb, his stomach was blown wide open. 

I haven’t been able to get those images out of my head since I ran. I wish I would’ve just stayed dead. I really am enjoying my new life though, I managed an escape with the help of my grandmother, who has been going through this since her birth in 1820. It’s funny how we stay young, I just wish everyone else did too.
