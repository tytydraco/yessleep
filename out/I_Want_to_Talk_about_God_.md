I am going to talk about God. 

First of all, i don’t think God is all-loving. I think *Jesus* is all-loving since Jesus was at least partly three-dimensional. God is more unknowable, more infinite and eldritch and amorphous. Whatever it- and it is an *‘it’-* has planned could not be understood by the human mind. From what i read in my brother’s books, ‘God’ would most likely be not a creature that resides in the fourth dimension, but the fourth dimension itself. Everything, all over, experiencing it *all:* past, present, future, simultaneously. 

Experiencing and watching with a hyper-human intelligence and a plan that nobody knows and ever *will* know because it’d all be so alien to us and we’d disavow it for that reason. It’s why it wants us to fear it. Fear is simply respect for ultimate power. 

And it puppets, and it watches, and it laughs at us because it didn’t put us here, it just is around to watch us be here and my God i can feel it everywhere i go now it’s just fucking *looking* at me and *leering* at me and it knows everything that is going to happen to me and it takes pleasure in the fact that *i don’t.* I wish i could- one day i might know how it’s all going to happen. 

Whatever Jesus was, he was a projection. That’s what the books said: that it never fully appears because it’s so incomprehensibly huge it physically *can’t,* so it sends down projections of itself. Smaller, three-dimensional holograms that aren’t even a millionth of a millionth of a billionth of the actual size of it. That’s Jesus to me, now, and angels. I mean, that *has* to be it. 

I know ascension is real now too. That there is a way of bringing your body with you when it takes you into its maw. Then you can harness its power. I wonder if my brother ever got its power, like Phillip and Alexander say they did in the books. I wonder if he could levitate and tell the future and bring back the dead. I wonder why he kept it from me if he could. Not that it matters now. But in my reading, i wonder if death is really so permanent? 

Even if i could bring him back, i’m never going back to that infernal town to get *him*. I love him enough to know that he is better off dead now. He didn’t even die at the hands of that murderer- at least, that’s what i know happened. A *human* killed my brother and made it look like The Elmsbury Vampire did it. Too much blood at the scene. That’s what gave it away. His soul is not in the fourth dimension, it would have taken his blood with him. His beautiful Borthwick blood. 

I think i’m being visited by an angel- a projection, to use the scientific term. It comes to me in the shape of a man with great, curving, antlers and a face like a bird’s. It doesn’t speak to me, it just whistles its tune. It’s so familiar to me, but i can’t think for the life of me where i’ve heard it from. It sings me to sleep. My guardian angel. 

I know so little and yet so very much. I can feel the tunnel from my head in a trajectory upward so dizzying it makes me faint from vertigo- like staring up at the peak of a mountain whilst stood at its foot. Like looking into the eye of a kaleidoscope. 

That was another thing, also, that they wrote about. The *knowing*. The mere revelation of this knowledge is enough to make you visible to it- it’s like it sees in infrared or something, it sees ripples or heat markings. Or maybe it’s like a hammerhead shark and it can feel the electro-magnetic pulse of your heartbeat as your frequencies shift and change and you ascend. Simply knowing your God will bring it to you. You don’t even have to believe in it at first. 

God, just typing it all up here to share with you makes my soul sing. I’m calling out to it without even knowing, without even wanting to. It’s reflexive. 

I’ve pored over those books, absorbing them into myself as i try to go deeper and deeper down this rabbithole but there’s just nothing out there in the worldly plane and i know that what i want to know- what i *deserve* to know- is down there still in that library. In *our* library. 

My brother was descended from the Borthwicks, that means i am too. They’re *my* books. It’s *my* knowledge to seek out. *My* turn, now, to dig. 

I’m writing this all up on here for you, my angel made it known to me that this knowledge works best spread. The fourth dimension is our internal world, after all- if i can make it a part of everyone’s internal world, then the knowledge can be spread. For lack of a more accurate term, you are now blessed. 

Dig, *dig.* Turn your head toward the wych elm and *dig.*
