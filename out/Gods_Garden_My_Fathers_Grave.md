My father was an old-school pastor. Fire and brimstone, no room for doubt. 

He brought us to Europe when I was still a girl, dragging his faith across the ocean like a rusted anchor. Like most lost children of the clergy, I endured the rituals of suffering—pressure, isolation, the slow-burning resentment that settled in my bones like a second skeleton.

My mother was never really part of the story. She died when I was six. A faded photograph, a whisper in the hallway. By the time I turned sixteen, my father’s punishment began.

Multiple sclerosis. 

A disease that peels you apart, layer by layer, until you’re just a prisoner in your own body. It started with tremors, then the stumbling, then the collapse. 

By the time I was twenty, he was trapped. His arms were barely functional. Legs? Useless. The only thing still alive in him was the pain. 

Lightning spiders were crawling through his spine, grinding his bones to powder, screaming through his nerves like they were being peeled raw.

Doctors were useless. Pills only turned him into a drooling relic.

We found one thing that worked—medical weed. But it was just a bandage on an open wound. A distraction, not a cure. The pain was always there, whispering in the back of his skull, a needle dragging slow across his nerves. It never stopped.

So, I took matters into my own hands.

We built our first grow box together. I gutted old cabinets and lined them with reflective foil. Computer fans whirred inside like mechanical lungs, drawing breath through activated carbon filters. I rigged cheap LEDs at first, but the yield was garbage, so I saved up and upgraded to full-spectrum lights—thin beams of artificial sun soaking the leaves in chemical love. 

The apartment stank of earth and chlorophyll, no matter how many filters I burned through. We lived in a cathedral of illicit green, the mechanical hum of air pumps and circulation fans filling the silence between us. 

Pre-war stone walls, towering ceilings, sunlight bleeding through the huge windows like a god’s eye watching us sin.

What started as medicine became a business.

Parcel lockers became lifelines. A friend in sorting—a grease-slick rat with nicotine fingers and a taste for bribes—kept things moving. Orders flowed, cash piled, and soon my father’s pain became just another part of the daily routine.

But the pain never really let me go.

I tried psychedelics, searching for something bigger, something to break me open, let the rot spill out. Ego death turned out to be just another lie, a temporary trick. So I switched to morphine. Smoothed out the edges. 

I fucked strangers with forgettable faces, just to grind away the gnawing emptiness inside me. I couldn’t stand being alone, but I hated them after the fact, so I always left before morning. Smoked Camel Blues on my walk home through Kraków’s damp streets. My father was probably still sleeping.

We stopped talking about God a long time ago. Our prayers were nothing more than purple haze and carbon filters. When we smoked, we played music on a Technics SL-1210MK7, something I got as a down payment for a bigger delivery. We loved Nebraska LP. One of the few things left from the old country. A keepsake of my mother.

*"Maybe everything that dies someday comes back,"* I’d sing along with Bruce.

And usually, we’d fall asleep to the last, somber notes of "Reason to Believe." Then the vinyl crack came to an end.

But the hunger for escape? That never stopped.

I needed more money. I had to keep my father from losing everything, from sinking too deep into his ruined body. Time was shrinking. 

Then I heard about it. My seed supplier told me in a hushed, feverish voice. A mutation. A mistake.

A plant that absorbed more than just light, that thrived in darkness, that bloomed under the „right kind of pain”. He mentioned the name once, something archaic and alchemical, but all I remembered was that it sounded ridiculous. 

Like a snake oil remedy peddled by some back-alley mystic.

*"It's a cross between Chemdawg and Querkle,"* he said, eyes darting like a rat’s. *"Hits both the body and the mind. The perfect hybrid. But this? This is different. This shit was marinated. The seeds—soaked in a special LSD solution. You won’t find it anywhere else. This strain doesn’t just get you high. It restructures you. Makes you new."*

Fucking junkie nonsense. His teeth were rotting in real time, and he kept licking at the sores on his lips. I barely listened. But then he said something else, something even more absurd:

*"You need to do it right. Blood in the soil. Male seed in the dirt. It’s part of the process."*

I stared at him.

*"You’re fucking serious?"*

He grinned, a mouthful of nicotine and decay. *"Dead fucking serious."*

And just like that, he left. Said the next drop would be in three months. Went into the alleyway like he had never been there at all. 

I laughed about it at first. The whole thing felt like a fever dream, the kind of thing you only half-remember after a three-day bender. 

Then, my father had another stroke.

Worse this time. His whole right side locked up, his face twisting in a way that barely looked human. His body shook, veins screaming under his paper-thin skin, and all I could do was hold him down until it passed. He pissed himself, his breath wheezing in and out like something caught in a drain.

Became too regular. Too violent. 

Desperation makes you do things. Things you swore you wouldn’t.

I found some guy, someone with forgettable eyes and the kind of body you don’t even pretend to want. It didn’t matter. We fucked in the car behind the place, my hands gripping cold handle, the stench of beer and cigarettes thick in the air. When it was over, I took the condom and left him there, half-dressed, still trying to remember my name.

At home, I laid everything out. The seeds, black and swollen like something calcified in a corpse’s gut. A deep ceramic pot filled with a mixture I had perfected over the years—perlite, peat moss, and worm castings for richness. The usual routine. But this time, I added the blood.

I bit down on my wrist until I tasted iron, let the droplets spatter onto the soil like rain. Then I tore open the condom, squeezing out the pale offering, mixing it in with my fingers. It felt obscene. Sacrilegious.

It felt *right*.

I planted the seeds. Watered them. Set up the grow lights—600W LEDs, full spectrum, adjusted for vegetative growth. 

Circulation fans placed at strategic angles, and humidity hovering around 65%. The first sprouts emerged within days, their leaves dark, waxy, almost *wet*\-looking. Something about them made my skin itch. I couldn’t stop watching them grow

Usual two- to three-week routine, but this time it felt... faster. Like time was bending, slipping through my fingers in a way I couldn't hold onto. 

I tried to keep my father in higher spirits. We talked more about the future, about what I wanted.

He told me to get out. To find something else. A life waiting somewhere beyond these four walls, already soaked in the excess of THC and resignation. But the truth? I couldn't imagine life without him. The only constant, the only weight keeping me from floating into nothing. He was abandoned by everything—his love, his faith, his God. But not by me.

So I had to find a way out. For him. For us.

That night, we listened to *The Contino Sessions*. *Dirge* came on first. The drugged-out *la la la’s* drifting, reverberating through the apartment like a half-forgotten prayer, looping in the cavern of our concrete garden. It felt holy in a way nothing else did anymore.

I left him dozing on the couch, curled into himself like a husk, and went to check the grow. He had already told me it was different. That it was *something else.* But he couldn’t explain why.

I saw it immediately. It wasn’t just a plant.

The leaves weren’t normal—too dark, too thick, a deep green that pulsed like the back of an eyelid under a bright light. The veins were black. Not *dark green*, not *purple*, but black, like something burnt and still bleeding. The stems twisted, not up, but *around* each other, coiled like tendons. And the smell—

Not weed.

Not even close.

Something richer, denser, like iron and decay, like old pennies on a fevered tongue. The scent clung to the air, filling my lungs, coating the back of my throat like something alive, something I’d swallowed by accident. My stomach turned, but my hands?

My hands were already reaching for the leaves.

The moment my fingers brushed against them, I felt it—this slow, creeping pulse, like something *breathing*. The edges were soft, almost fleshy, the underside slick, damp with something that left a film on my skin. I wiped my fingers on my jeans, heart pounding. I should’ve backed away. I should’ve trashed the whole fucking thing.

But I didn’t.

Because for the first time in years, I felt *calm*. Like something had reached inside me and silenced the static, turned the noise down to a whisper. The hunger, the rotting feeling in my ribs, the weight of it all—it didn’t go away, not completely, but it *shifted*.

Like this thing—

This *thing* I’d grown—

*Knew me.*

I stood there in the dark, listening to the low hum of the lights, the faint crackle of the vinyl skipping in the other room, and I knew.

We had to smoke it.

Not for business. Not even for money. But for *him.*

Soul Auctioneer played behind me. *"To crucify Venus in cinemascope The narcotic preachers are happy."*

How fitting, I thought. We will finally be happy. I thought.

I started trimming the plant off with sugar leaves and fan leaves. The sugar leaves, sticky and dense, I set aside for hash. The fan leaves, though barely potent, curled under the heat, releasing the faintest whisper of something strange. The air turned thick, humming with a scent beyond cannabis—metallic, sweet, like rotting fruit left in the sun too long. My fingers tingled where the resin clung, and I felt a slow, creeping warmth in my chest. People say you can’t get high from handling raw leaves, but something in this plant said otherwise.

I staggered, heat spreading up my arms, settling in the base of my skull. I pressed my knuckles into my eyes until sparks bloomed behind my lids. No. Not now. I forced myself toward my father’s wheelchair, hands trembling as I rolled the joint. The first inhale made his body slacken in relief, a long, deep exhale cutting through years of agony. 

Then, something I hadn’t seen in over a decade—his fingers twitched. Then his wrist. Then, impossibly, his whole hand lifted, hovering in the air like a fragile, disbelieving thing.

I gasped. *"Dad—"*

His eyes widened as he flexed his fingers, once gnarled into useless claws. Then his other hand followed, slow but sure, reaching toward mine. I grabbed them both, gripping them like a lifeline, our breath shaking in unison. Tears burned down my cheeks, his own eyes glistening in the dim light of the apartment. And in that moment, we weren’t in this ruin of a home, this concrete tomb. We were elsewhere, a different time, a different place. Somewhere warm.

A flicker in the periphery.

She was there. Not a memory, not a hallucination, but something else—an imprint, a ghost, blurred at the edges like a forgotten photograph. My mother. Watching us, her face a mixture of sorrow and something close to peace.

I squeezed his hands tighter. I know he saw her, too. 

And for the first time in years, we were together again.

That night, I slept deeply, dreamlessly, like sinking into warm water. But when I woke, something was wrong. The apartment was too quiet.

Then I saw him.

The wheelchair was empty.

I found him crumpled on the floor, his body twisted unnaturally, one arm pinned under him, his mouth slightly open, drool pooling against the cold tile. A stain smeared across the wall where his head had struck it in the fall. His breath was ragged, wet, like something caught in his throat.

*"Dad,"* I whispered, kneeling beside him. *"No, no, no..."*

His eyes were open but vacant. The light that had flickered the night before was gone. The stroke had taken everything.

The worst one yet. The final one. 

I sat there for hours, watching the slow, mechanical rise and fall of his chest. This wasn’t life. Not anymore.

I knew what I had to do.

The night air smelled of damp earth and lake water. I wheeled him through the city, past silent buildings and flickering streetlights, down cracked sidewalks toward Zakrzówek, our place. His head lolled to the side, his body loose in the chair, his breath the only sign of lingering existence.

I reached into my pocket, pulling out the seeds. The last of them. The ones that had made him move, made him remember. I knelt in front of him, cupping his chin, forcing his slackened mouth open. 

*"This will bring you back,"* I whispered. *"I swear."*

I pressed the seeds onto his tongue.  
He swallowed without protest.

And… nothing really happened.

We sat there, watching the godrays slice through the tree leaves, the world moving on without us. Just wind. Just light. Just the slow decay of time.

But sometimes, at night, I can hear it. A sharp, wet sound escaping his lips, his fingers twitching—just like before. Only for a moment. Sometimes, the high ceilings and cold walls hum. Breathe.

And some nights, if you get too close, you can hear it.

The whisper.  
The prayer.  
Waiting.

For it to grow.
