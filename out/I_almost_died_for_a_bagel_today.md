Is this the right place to post about a brush with death? I feel like you guys on this reddit can appreciate it, even if there’s no ghosts or tragedies. Ten minutes ago I stepped out of an elevator. I was supposed to die when the cable snapped. I don’t know whether to laugh or—should I be looking over my shoulder the rest of my life, waiting for the other shoe (or elevator) to drop?

Let me explain. Last night, I took a Lyft. Didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary at first. The driver had a smoker’s rasp, floral pastel shirt, lines spider-webbing around her beady eyes—think your kooky aunt who wears too many rings and keeps a stash of vodka in her glovebox. We were talking about making the most of life since you never know how long it’ll be, and she chuckled and said, “Well—actually, I know exactly how long your life’ll be. Your death—I can see it right in your eyes. Anyone’s. Except my own, of course. A mirror’s no good. Has to be the real thing.”

“You can see my death… in my eyes?” I sputtered, incredulous.

“Sure.”

“Uh, ok. So how do I—”

“B’fore you ask, I gotta warn you, nothing you do can prevent it.”

“Nothing?”

“Nothing,” she said, with smug certainty.

“But how do you know?”

“’Cause I know.” Seeing my skeptical stare in the rearview, she said, “Take the guy I picked up last year. He was flying home to Minnesota. He asked me to tell him, so I said, ‘Your car’s gonna skid on the ice in a terrible snowstorm and you die in the crash.’ Now, this guy, he’s not like you—*you* think I’m talking nonsense. But him, he’s a believer. He takes what I say dead serious, get me? So what’s he do? He gets a separate home for the winter. Stays out of Minnesota. Overwinters in San Antonio. They get maybe five inches of snow a decade. He figures he’s safe.”

“But he wasn’t?”

“Remember last year? What took out the power grid in Texas?”

I did remember when she mentioned it—the freak winter storm that caused power failures all across Texas as temperatures plummeted.

“Funny thing—his car in Minnesota had good tires and handled the snow well. But in San Antonio, he wasn’t prepared for it.” She shrugged. “I read his obituary. May he rest in peace… though he won’t.” Before I could ask what she meant by this ominous remark, she went on, “Then there was the guy last week…”

“What happened to the guy last week?”

The woman’s eyes twinkled in that way of a street grifter who’s made their mark. “I picked him up from the airport, same as you. Gave him the warning, but he was curious—same as you—so I told him: ‘You die from the bite of a predator.’”

“And?” I was too curious to restrain myself.

“Turns out this guy was planning to go on this safari with his girlfriend. But after my warning, he called her up, right there in the car, and told her he couldn’t go. Oh, you should’ve heard!” She laughed and slapped her thigh. “Hoo boy, was his girl peeved! She told him canceling after they’d already paid wasn’t fair. I told him she was right. He’d better not cancel. Might as well just go on that safari.”

“And did he?” I asked, riveted. “Did he go and get eaten by a lion?”

“Nope. She went alone.” There was a sly glimmer in her eye. “He stayed home and looked after his girlfriend’s cat. The cat bit him. He thought it’d be fine with just some peroxide and rest. Killed him in a day.”

“No way!” I said. “How could a little cat’s bite kill a grown man?” I didn’t believe her, but she told me to look it up, so I did. And… There was the story from last week, in local news. I was horrified. Cat bites can turn deadly in a matter of hours if they become infected. I put my phone away.

“Geez,” I said. For a few minutes I was silent, contemplative. “He shouldn’t have agreed to watch the cat. If it were me, I’d have avoided all animals. Even a rat can be a predator.”

“Smart, you.” She tipped her head toward me. “But don’t matter. It’s like I told the soccer mom yesterday, the one who’s gonna die of rabies—there’s no way to avoid what I see.”

“Why not?” I challenged. “What if the soccer mom locks herself in a room for the rest of her life and never has any exposure to nature?” I knew this wasn’t a logical course of action, of course. But hypothetically. “If she did that, she’d be safe.”

“Nope.”

“Nope? How nope? You’re saying even in secure isolation somehow some rabid animal would break in, bite her, and give her rabies?”

“Nah—you’re thinking too extreme. It’s a lot simpler than that. It’s always the simple thing. Listen, she was in the car yesterday with me, yeah? And just like you say, she said she was going to avoid all nature and live in the city and never leave her enclosed high rise building. But I told her it wouldn’t help. Then I gave her some water. And I told her funny thing is about rabies, you can get bitten by something with tiny fangs, like a bat, and not even feel it—you don’t even know you’ve been infected. And you might not get sick until, oh, five, six weeks, even months later. Of course the symptoms of rabies look a lot like flu at first, but as it progresses there’s delirium, agitation. And of course the most distinguishing symptom is with water—that’s why they call it hydrophobia—aversion to water. See it spreads through saliva, so the rabies virus makes it so you can’t swallow. Now the woman, she hadn’t touched her bottle. She was looking more and more agitated. She’d been kinda feverish looking since before she got in my car. And I told her, she might be thinking she’s just feeling a touch of the flu and it hurts her throat if she tries to choke anything down—but the thing about rabies is, there’s no treatment once the symptoms show. Sure there’s a vaccine, but you gotta get it immediately, right after exposure. ‘Cause during that loooong incubation period, it’s spreading all through your body, so that by the time you start showing symptoms—you’re already dead.”

I sat silent, appalled. I looked at the water bottle I’d been offered by the driver and that I had already sipped from, and set it down. This whole business about rabies sounded horrific. “You said she was in here yesterday?”

The driver chuckled. “You think I’d give you a used bottle? C’mon, now. Besides, it’s not how you die.”

“How do I die?” I said, the words out of my mouth before I could stop them.

To my surprise, she didn’t hem or haw anymore. “You die because the elevator cable snaps.”

“I die… because the cable snaps?” That gave me pause. My building *does* have an elevator. I use it every day. I live on the 10th floor, so climbing the stairs isn’t feasible. I considered my options. Immediately, I found myself thinking about moving to a single-story building or some other location where my traveling in an elevator wouldn’t be necessary. But that wouldn’t work, would it? After all, she already told me stories of people who changed their habits precisely *because* she warned them, with the result that their changed habits caused their own deaths. In fact, the more I thought about it, the more it seemed there was always a catch to her warnings. Suspicious, I asked her, “Why didn’t you tell the safari guy that it was a cat bite? A little more clarity and he might still be alive!”

Her lips curled at the corners, and I swear I saw tiny horns in her mess of dark hair, and she said, “Well son, there’s rules to these things, you know. I tell the truth… it’s up to you to interpret it.”

“Who makes the rules?” I asked.

But the car screeched to a halt. She tapped her nose. “Think this’s your stop,” she said. I hadn’t even given her the building address—just the general neighborhood name. But here I was. I paid her and got out, and she zipped off before I could ask more questions.

Later I contacted Lyft, but they didn’t have a driver matching her description or any record of the ride that picked me up.

\*\*\*

Well. What would you have done? I marched my suitcase over to the elevator and pushed the button. I wasn’t about to carry that damned suitcase up ten flights of steep stairs. I reasoned that, instead of trying to outmaneuver her predictions, I’d pretend not to know about my death-due-to-snapped-elevator-cable.

Pretending was hard, though, given the knowledge was already in my brain. I almost fainted when I crossed the threshold, dragging my suitcase into that wobbly, janky old elevator. Every creak and clank sent my heart plummeting. The sixty seconds it took to reach the 10th floor felt as if they stretched on for sixty years, and I was nearly sick on myself when the doors finally opened and I stumbled, pale and shaking, to my flat. Research helped me feel better about my situation later. See, unlike rabies, which really does leave you dead if you’re showing symptoms, or a cat bite, which really can kill you—an elevator plunging you to your death is more of an urban myth. There are backup cables and brakes, so that despite what you see in the movies, it’s essentially impossible for you to go plummeting. I spoke to several elevator technicians, and they all assured me there’s no way for me to die from a snapped cable, short of having a heart attack. And now that I know *that*, my panicking and dying by heart attack is a lot less likely.

And here—here comes the bagel—the bagel that I mentioned in the title of this post, which nearly cost my life. See, I didn’t really *need* to go out today. But around lunch time, I craved a bagel. So.

I took the elevator.

I punched in the button for the lobby. I was already imagining what kind of toppings I’d order from the corner bagel shop. No sooner had the doors closed then there was this horrible *CLANG*, and—

—the elevator dropped—

—I was suspended in the air—

—my heart stopped—

—my stomach—I left it hovering somewhere on the 10th floor—

—I cursed all my research and the elevator technicians who’d lied to me—

—then my body slammed into the floor as the elevator car jerked to a halt. I’d only dropped… maybe a few feet? The brake saved me! And though my heart was hammering like the wings of a hummingbird, I think the fact I *knew* the elevator car couldn’t fall prevented me from being as petrified as I would’ve been otherwise. I’m proud to say that I was quite calm as I waited for emergency services to get me out. They’re still repairing the elevator, and despite my anxiety, I plan to ride it again once it’s fixed. Gotta keep on pretending like the cable hasn’t got it out for me right? Haha. Because see now, I’ve proven it is *safe.*

So sorry this tale doesn’t end in the grim or ghostly, but what a wild ride, eh? And I never even got my bagel! Guess I’ll get it now. Figure I deserve it after all that! The elevator’s probably not operational yet, so for now, it’s the stairs. Hmm… [cinnamon raisin or everything…?](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuincyLee/comments/11nxwz3/welcome_thanks_so_much_for_stopping_by/)
