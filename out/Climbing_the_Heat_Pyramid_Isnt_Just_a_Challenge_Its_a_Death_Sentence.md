Some things you see, you can’t unsee, no matter how hard you try. I’ve spent months replaying that afternoon in my head, asking myself if it was even real. But every time I close my eyes, I remember Donovan—what happened to him. How fast it all spiraled out of control. And the worst part? I can still smell the burnt flesh, like it’s soaked into my brain and refuses to leave.

It happened on a Friday afternoon, a few blocks from our high school. Donovan and I were walking home like we always did, kicking rocks down the sidewalk and talking about the usual stuff—video games, girls we had crushes on, and the spicy ramen we’d tried last weekend. We’ve been obsessed with spicy foods for years, like those weirdos who ask for hot sauce gift sets at Christmas. Donovan was even more hardcore than me—he kept one of those mini bottles of ghost pepper sauce on his keychain, just to flex.

So when we saw the cart, it was like the universe was testing us.

It was sitting at the corner of Blake and Sixth, where the hardware store used to be before it closed. The thing looked way too professional to just be a random food stand—sleek black panels, shiny chrome trim, and banners with block letters: “CLIMB THE HEAT PYRAMID.” There was a colorful chart plastered to the side, showing all the peppers you’d expect: jalapeño, habanero, ghost pepper, Carolina Reaper, and the new champion of heat—Pepper X. But above those were even more levels, names I didn’t recognize—like “Sun’s Wrath” and “Devil’s Grin.” There were at least ten more levels beyond what should’ve been physically possible.

I should’ve known right then that something was off. But the vendor? Man, he was smooth. He had the whole carnival-barker vibe down to a science—grinning wide, gesturing dramatically, and calling us over with the promise of “a *new sensation*.”

“Come on, gentlemen! How tough are those taste buds? Care to test your limits?” he said with a grin. “Today’s your lucky day—free samples, all heat, no charge.”

Donovan’s eyes lit up. “Free?”

“Absolutely. You just gotta prove you can climb the pyramid.” The vendor’s grin was way too wide—like, cartoon-character wide. “Think you’ve got what it takes?”

I felt a knot in my stomach. I wanted to say no, but Donovan was already walking toward the cart, like a moth to a flame. I couldn’t just stand there, so I followed.

The vendor handed us each a sample—a weird, puffy chip that looked like someone combined a Cheeto with a potato chip. It was dusted in a bright red powder that smelled dangerous.

“This one’s jalapeño. Baby stuff,” the vendor said, winking. “Let’s see if you can make it to the top.”

We popped them into our mouths, and the heat hit instantly. It wasn’t anything we couldn’t handle—just a warm-up—but it was *sharp.* Like the heat wanted to crawl into your gums and nest there. Donovan grinned and gave the vendor a thumbs-up.

“That all you’ve got?” Donovan teased.

The vendor laughed. “Oh, we’re just getting started.”  
  
\* \* \* \* \* \*  
  
We climbed the pyramid fast—habanero, ghost pepper, Carolina Reaper. Each level was hotter than the last, but Donovan and I powered through. My face was sweating like crazy, and my throat felt like it had been scrubbed with sandpaper, but Donovan? The guy was in his element. He kept grabbing the samples without hesitation, grinning like it was the best day of his life.

When we hit Pepper X, the burn felt like someone had taken a blowtorch to my mouth. I gasped, blinking tears out of my eyes, and clutched my knees as the heat punched through my sinuses.

“Holy crap,” I wheezed. “This stuff *hurts.*”

Donovan, of course, wasn’t satisfied. “One more level,” he said, wiping the sweat from his forehead with his sleeve.

“Dude, we’ve already hit Pepper X,” I said. “Nothing’s supposed to be hotter than this.”

“Wanna bet?” Donovan grinned and pointed to the chart. “Look at these other ones.”

The vendor leaned in with that same eerie grin. “He’s right, you know. You’ve still got a ways to go if you want to hit the top.”

I tried to talk Donovan out of it. Something about this felt *wrong*. But Donovan wouldn’t listen—he was already grabbing the next snack from the cart. This one had no label. It was jet black, like someone had rolled charcoal dust onto it.

“Last one,” Donovan said, popping it into his mouth.  
  
The change was instant. Donovan froze for a second, blinking hard. Then smoke—actual smoke—began curling out of his nostrils.

At first, I thought it was some kind of trick or prank. Maybe the vendor had put dry ice in the snack to mess with us. But then I smelled it—burning hair and scorched skin.

“Donovan…?” I whispered.

He exhaled slowly, black ash puffing from his mouth. His eyes were wide, but he looked calm—too calm, like he was under some kind of spell.

“Dude, you okay?” I grabbed his arm, but he didn’t respond. He just smiled dreamily and reached for another snack.

The vendor stood silently, watching with that same damn grin, like this was a show he’d seen a hundred times before.

“Stop him!” I shouted at the vendor. “He’s burning! Do something!”

The vendor shrugged. “He’s climbing the pyramid. Can’t stop him now.”  
  
Donovan’s skin started blistering. Red welts popped up on his arms and face, then burst open with little hisses of steam. He didn’t even flinch. His hair, still damp with sweat, dried instantly and *caught fire.*

I grabbed for the snack in his hand, desperate to stop him, but the moment my fingers touched it, pain shot through me like I’d stuck my hand into molten lava. I screamed and yanked my hand away, watching in horror as blisters formed and popped along my palm.

“Donovan, stop!” I begged, but he didn’t even hear me. He shoved another chip into his mouth, his grin widening as his skin peeled away like paper. His teeth showed through cracked lips, and his fingernails fell off, but he kept eating.

Then, the worst part: his eyes started to boil.

At first, they just looked cloudy, like he had cataracts. But then they swelled and hissed, little bubbles forming along the whites.

Pop.

His left eye exploded in a burst of steam.

Pop.

The right one followed.

And still—*still*—he kept eating.  
  
I couldn’t take it anymore. I turned and ran, screaming for help. My vision blurred with tears and sweat as I sprinted down the block, shouting for anyone who would listen. A couple of people stopped and stared in confusion, but no one moved to help.

By the time I dragged a group of adults back to the spot, the cart was gone. No vendor. No snacks. No sign of Donovan—just a greasy, blackened stain on the pavement where he’d stood.

“Where’s your friend?” one of the adults asked.

I pointed to the charred outline. “He… he was right there.”

They all looked at me like I was crazy.  
  
\* \* \* \* \* \*  
  
The police didn’t believe me. They said maybe Donovan had gotten mixed up in some dumb prank or that I was in shock from witnessing something traumatic. They tried to tell me it was a hallucination or some freak incident—maybe “spice poisoning.”

But Donovan’s parents? They weren’t buying it. They blamed me from day one, told everyone that I’d gotten their “perfect son” into trouble and run with the “wrong crowd.” They made it clear they thought I was covering up something worse, maybe even responsible for his disappearance. Every time I saw them, they looked at me with pure hatred.

They moved away a few months later. I think it was easier for them to start over somewhere else, away from the town where Donovan vanished.

The cops marked it as a cold case—a likely abduction, maybe a runaway situation, though they never found any leads. No body, no evidence, *nothing*.

But I know what I saw.  
  
I don’t touch spicy food anymore. I can’t even walk down that street without feeling sick. And when the wind blows just right, I swear I can still smell ash in the air—like a faint reminder of what happened.

So here’s my advice: If you ever see a cart offering free spicy snacks, just walk away. Don’t even look at it.
