I want to confess something, and who better to tell than strangers on the internet?

My name's Mark—though that's not my real name. Like many of you, I'm just a normal person, though I've become obsessed with taking care of plants. I know many people are, but I took it too far. I apologize for what I did, but for my plants, I'll do anything.

I don't even know why I developed this obsession or why I do what I do. It started after my wife left me. When she announced she was pregnant, I was the happiest person alive—until she revealed I wasn't the father. It was her ex-boyfriend. Haha... I might have gone crazy at that point. I really wanted to hurt them, but seeing her tears as she said sorry and ran away made me stop. Just for a bit.

The divorce was clean cut, at least. I kept the apartment and most of my money, while she got away with nothing. No consequences. For months after that, I wallowed in drinks and isolated myself.

Conveniently, we had a roof deck with a garden that used to be hers. I guess in my muddled mind I tried doing some gardening—the next day I woke up holding some gardening tool I didn't even know the name of back then, covered in dirt. Fortunately, it hadn't rained.

That's where it all started. Maybe it was how I processed my grief; I'm not really sure anymore. But I stopped drinking and instead focused on the plants. Like they were my own kids.

I started researching what's best for them and created my own little garden. That's when I discovered bone meal could be a good addition, and lucky for me, I found a local butcher who sold it. The price was surprisingly low, and when I tried it—it worked wonders on my plants, giving them more luster and color than I'd ever seen.

I've been watching them grow and develop, each day dedicated to observing them. Every change brings me joy. I really had to thank that butcher. But just when my stock was almost gone, I went back only to find the place shut down indefinitely. His phone was dead when I tried calling. As time passed, I grew frustrated and angry—I couldn't let my plants go without it.

I searched other stores but found only regular fertilizer. The stuff I managed to buy online just disappointed me after weeks of use. My plants showed damage, and everything went in the trash. Each failed attempt felt like watching my children wither away.

I grew desperate trying other brands, but nothing came close to what the butcher sold me. For months, I carefully rationed what little I had left, afraid to use it. Every morning, I'd check my dwindling supply, hands shaking as I measured out smaller and smaller portions.

Then summer came, and I watched my plants suffering. Nothing worked until I was forced to use that last bag. The next week, they were growing greener and brighter than ever. The transformation was almost unnatural—leaves stretching toward the sun with an eager hunger I'd never seen before.

But how to get more? I searched frantically online, sending emails everywhere, trying to contact the butcher. Finally, I got lucky—a reply from his work email gave me hope.

The message read: "Go to the back of my shop. There's a warehouse where I put several sacks. They're yours for $1,000. I'll give you the passcode and location of the hidden lock."

The money didn't matter anymore. Every second waiting was agony. After a day, he sent the code and instructions. I wanted to report it to the police but couldn't risk it. My plants needed this.

At the warehouse, I noticed a weird smell of decay but dismissed it as spoiled meat. While rummaging through various equipment, I found what I came for—twelve sacks of bone meal piled in the corner. I loaded them into my truck, excited to put them to use.

I tested the first sack carefully, adding more each day. The plants became lusher and greener than ever. Their growth was almost aggressive, stems thickening, leaves spreading wider than I'd ever seen. Each day I sat watching them change. I never really questioned what was different, just kept using more than the recommended amount. The plants seemed to love it—no, they seemed to crave it.

But my excessive use made the twelve sacks dwindle quickly. I paced back and forth, feeling hopeless and angry at the butcher, thinking I'd been scammed. When I tried contacting him again, everything was deleted or disconnected.

Then it hit me—I remembered the bones in his warehouse. What if I ground them myself?

The warehouse was darker than I remembered, the single bulb casting shadows everywhere. The smell hit me harder this time—thick, putrid, and sour, like meat left to rot in the sun. My stomach churned, but I kept going. That's when I saw them—bones scattered everywhere, heaped into piles.

And that's when I realized my mistake about them being special animal bones. Heh... they were special alright. I found a metal plate on one—the kind used in surgery. I must have stared at it for hours before running away.

I holed up in my room, just thinking. Days passed while I moved like a puppet, consumed by thoughts of that metal plate. Should I report it? Would I be arrested for using the bone meal on my plants? My beautiful, precious plants...

Watching them wither each day, something in me broke. I went back, ground the bones anyway, and brought them home. The sound of the grinder haunts me still—a wet, crunching noise that seemed almost eager.

I was happy—or I think I was—just watching them grow. This time I used the bone meal only once daily and sat there. I ate and drank occasionally when hungry, but mostly I just watched the plants. Sometimes I stayed awake all night making sure they were okay. They seemed different now—more vital, more alive. Sometimes I swear I could hear them growing in the dark.

Then another crisis—the bone meal was almost gone. One more sack, and I didn't know what to do.

But then... I woke up one day with bloody hands here in the butcher's warehouse. Three skulls and bones were piled up. On one bone, there was a metal plate—reminiscent of my ex-wife's volleyball injury.

But at least now I have more bones, for the plants...
