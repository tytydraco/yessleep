The first thing I remember is the taste of saltwater and blood. I awoke to the sensation of one flowing in through my helplessly ajar mouth while the other escaped from the fresh lacerations along my throbbing tongue. As the water entered my chest I felt my lungs begin to burn, and I quickly forgot all about the bloody ache in my mouth. 

Powerful, eager waves, fresh from the depths of Poseidon's briny maw, tossed my limp, useless body like an angry child throws around their doll moments before getting placed in time-out, the key difference being that the Lord of the Ocean faces no such punishment for flexing his mighty influence. My arms and legs flailed wildly as my body tumbled through the water, no longer bound to any whim of my own, but to the suggestion of Poseidon’s Earthshaking tantrum. If my brain could have properly functioned in all of that chaos, I would have thought he meant to play with me until the end of time; evidently, though, he grew bored of our game, something I learned in the form of crashing pain as my back slammed against a hard, sandy shore.

The blow knocked me unconscious again for another moment, and when I came-to, Poseidon, his energy reinvigorated, was already using the mighty tide to pull me back into his domain. In an act of blasphemous defiance, I quickly flipped myself onto my knees, hacking up seawater as I did, and crawled with all of my strength up that length of sand. My clothes felt weighed down by iron and my body, weakened by my recent ordeal, was on the verge of collapse. Harsh, stinging rain lashed across my face as the wind screamed in my ears, telling me to give up, it would all be so much easier if I would just give up. I was certain the raging tide was going to defeat me, but I somehow managed to fight against it long enough to finally escape its grasp. Once free, I crawled another few yards up the beach before I tumbled onto my side in a state of unrivaled exhaustion.

I closed my eyes for only a moment — not much longer than a blink — and when I opened them again, the storm had mostly passed. Rain still struck down upon me from the cloudy nighttime sky, but it had largely abated from its early fury, and the raging waves and tide had also grown more placid. The wind no longer howled terrible suggestions into my ear, and the curtain of clouds above broke up just slightly enough to allow some azure moonlight to slip down from the peaceful firmament.

I forced myself into a sitting position, a task made almost impossibly difficult due to the weight of my soaked clothes, though my brief siesta seemed to have given my body back some of its strength (though it had done little for the raging headache that now dominated the space within my skull). Looking around, I found myself on a long stretch of beach. The vast ocean, like onyx glass in the blackness of night, extended before me in one direction; in all others was only shadow and sand.

Disoriented, thirsty, and shivering with the cold, I struggled to gather my thoughts while I sat on that frigid stretch of lonely beach. I couldn’t remember how I had ended up in Poseidon’s playground. The only thing I knew was that I couldn’t stay there on that beach, exposed to the rain and the chill. I needed to find shelter as soon as possible; regaining my bearings would come afterward. With this in mind, and suddenly warmed by a fresh determination to escape the elements, I forced my protesting body to its feet. I was immediately hit by a wave of nausea that I was sure would lead to vomiting. My suspicion was quickly proven correct, as I soon found myself doubled over, bile and brine escaping from my open mouth. When my expulsion was over, I stood panting for several long seconds before attempting to spit excess vomit into the sand. My mouth, however, was too dry to conjure any saliva for the wanted action, and so the taste of puke remained. After giving myself a few moments to recover, I took a cautious step forward along the beach. My body screamed with a thousand years of ache, and my legs felt like melted jelly, but I thankfully didn’t seem to be seriously injured. I was lucky; much more lucky than I even realized at the time.

I only made it a few steps along the beach before I noticed the body.

It appeared so suddenly from out of the darkness, seeming to materialize from the very essence of the gloom itself. At first it looked like it may have been an outcropping of rocks, or maybe even a jumble of seaweed, but after a few moments, its true identity became known to me. I scrambled toward the crumpled form with as much haste as I could, clumsily falling to a knee when I reached it. It was lying on the beach with its back to the sky, its face in the cold, wet sand. I reached a pruny hand toward its soggy shoulder and shook it with what strength I could gather.

“Hey!” I said. “Hey, wake up!”

When the figure didn’t respond, I decided to flip it onto its back. Upon doing so, I immediately realized two things. The first was that this person, judging by their clothes, was the pilot. The second was that they were dead. I reeled away from the corpse in a sudden tempest of shock and disgust. The body’s vacant, watery eyes seemed to follow me as I went; they bulged out of the corpse’s bloated head in a way that seemed like they were trying to escape from their home.

I was only able to recognize the pilot from their uniform; I never would have been able to identify them based on the state of their corpse, which had already been ravaged by death and the sea in such a relatively short time. The presence of the dead pilot, while disturbing and tragic, at the very least helped me to settle my swimming mind. I remembered that I had been on a last-minute red-eye flight that was on its way over the Atlantic when we suddenly hit a particularly rough patch of turbulence. This apparently wasn’t too much to be concerned about, as the pilot — the same one now lying dead in front of me — hadn’t seemed worried at all when announcing the possibility of a slightly bumpy flight.

That was before the storm appeared.

I returned to my feet and looked back in the direction of the ocean’s maw, searching for something — the sinking wreckage; some supplies floating in the angry surf; a deployed lifeboat, maybe — but all I could see was more black. It was as if my entire world had been reduced to the inside of an inkwell, in which I was confined for all eternity. Never have I feared the terrible might of the ocean as much as I did in that moment, in the midst of that lashing rain, beneath the alien darkness of the nighttime sky. 

I suddenly heard a voice calling to me, sounding very far away. I likely wouldn't have even heard it had the storm still been at its worst.

I followed the voice with my eyes. Approaching me from farther along the beach was a young woman, who staggered toward me with all the grace and speed that her worn, soaking body could muster. When she finally reached me, she was drained of her energy, and was reduced to heavy panting that prevented her from speaking for some time. 

“Are you alright?” I asked her, then realized I could provide a more apt question: “Are you hurt?”

She shook her head, then, finally catching her breath, said, “No, but I need your help. There's a man over here who can't stand. I think he has a broken leg.”

“Where is he?”

“There.” She pointed toward the darkness that she had just emerged from, and I immediately understood that I had asked another foolish question. “I can't lift him by myself. Please, I need your help!”

The woman turned and made her way back in the direction from which she had come. I prepared to follow after, but, remembering my original purpose for stopping there, offered one final glance at the body of the pilot. Where was once a corpse, now was only sand. The body of the pilot was gone.

The woman yelled for me to hurry, knocking away any shock that I might have felt at discovering the pilot’s absence. Brushing aside any hesitance, I followed her into the shadows, both of us struggling to make our way along the beach, until we came across another figure lying on the sand. For a moment I thought back to the dead pilot, but the pit this memory formed in my stomach was immediately dispelled when this new figure began to move. He groaned in his agony as he turned to look at me, his face awash with the anguish of his apparent injury.

“Oh, thank God!” he said. “Please, help me! Get me out of here!”

“It's going to be alright, sir,” I said, not knowing if that was true. “Where are you hurt?”

“My legs!” He yelled. “My fucking *legs*!”

“Alright,” I said. “We're going to help you, but we need to get you out of this rain first.”

“There's a cave nearby,” the woman said. “I saw it further inland. We can take him there.”

“Alright,” I said. “Then we need to move now. I’ll get him, you just lead us to that cave.”

I positioned myself behind the agonized man and wrapped either arm beneath his armpits and up over his shoulders. After signifying to the woman that I was ready, we began our trek through the darkness, her leading the way while I, walking backwards, dragged our companion through the sand. Soon the terrain became more rough as sand transitioned to less agreeable surfaces, and the sounds of his pain began. He groaned and yelled as I dragged his ruinous body across stones and branches and sharp thorns. Our trek seemed to go on for hours, during which my own heavy, exhausted body begged for me to abandon my charge and leave the man to his fate. I barely remember reaching the cave, which seemed to spring up out of the gloom like a waiting tombstone. Once inside, I placed the injured man against one of the cool earthen walls. The relief of losing my burden overwhelmed me so greatly that I too collapsed to the cave floor, my strength completely lost. I intended to only lie there for a brief moment while I recovered some of my energy, but soon the exhaustion that had overtaken me grew far too powerful, and I once again fell unconscious, my mind as dark as the surrounding cave.

I awoke to the sound and heat of a crackling fire. I enjoyed its warmth, though inside I possessed a chill that seemingly no flame could ever chase away. When I opened my eyes, I saw the orange glow of the blaze, which rested just beyond the mouth of the cave. Sitting in front of the fire were two silhouettes; behind them was nighttime darkness. I could see twinkling white stars beyond the figures’ heads, indicating that the storm had finally ceased, but not much else.

Sitting up required the immense task of ignoring my screaming head. I looked around, taking in my surroundings while I waited for my mind to stop dancing. The chamber of the cave I was in, while appearing to be fairly small, extended beyond where the light of the fire could reach; I didn’t yet know how far it went, or what passages were hidden deep within the shadows, but the distant sound of dripping water told me that there was considerably more to the cavern than what I could see.

I forced myself to my feet, rising as high as I was able (the low roof of the cave forced me to crouch to about half of my full height) and shuffled my way toward the two figures in front of the fire. As I approached, I noticed the injured man lying near the blaze; he appeared to be unconscious, and in the flickering firelight I could see the gentle rise and fall of his chest. He had been stripped to his underwear, and I caught a glimpse of the pair of horrible bruises that covered either of his legs in huge blotches, looking like tattoos of raging hellfire.

One of the silhouettes noticed me and turned in my direction. I recognized the look of the young woman, her face dancing in the shadows produced by the blaze. She offered me a concerned smile. “You’re awake,” she said. “How are you feeling?”

“Everything hurts,” I said, “but I’m alright.” I looked at the unconscious man. “How is *he*?”

“Broken legs.” It was the other figure who talked. He was a burly-looking man with a bushy, thick beard of gray that matched the grizzle in his voice. The stranger kept his gaze on the fire as he spoke. “Both of ’em. Seems alright enough, though. Bones didn’t break skin, and no bleeding far as I could see.”

I failed to suppress a frown. “Can’t we do anything for him? Set his bones or something?”

“You a doctor?” The stranger looked at me now. His eyes were as frigid as the fire was warm. “Ever set a bone before?”

“No,” I said sheepishly, answering both questions at once.

“Setting bones without knowin’ what you’re doin’ is dangerous,” he said. “Could even be deadly.” He gestured to the young woman with his chin. “You can ask the nurse all about that.”

I looked at her. “You’re a nurse?”

“Nursing *student*,” she corrected kindly. “Only just finished my first semester. He needs more help than I’m able to provide him.”

“Then we need to get him out of here,” I said.

“You a good swimmer?” the stranger asked.

I nodded. “I’m good enough.”

He grunted in some strange affirmation. “Good enough to swim across the Atlantic with him on your back? Because that’s the only way you’re getting him off of this island.”

“How sure are you that this is even an island?” the nursing student asked.

“Sure enough,” he said. “Not much else out where we went down. But I suppose we can find out for certain in the mornin’. I’ll look around this place come daylight, try to get an idea of what we’re workin’ with here.”

I looked at the man with the broken legs. “Hopefully he even lasts that long.”

“He will,” the stranger said. His attention was back on the fire now. “Injuries don’t seem life-threatening right now. Should be alright so long as we get rescued soon enough.”

“But who knows how long *that* could take?” the nursing student asked.

“Don’t know,” he said. “We’ll just have to wait and see.”

His words were less than reassuring, but they proved to be the last we would get from him that night. The stranger stared at the blaze in silence for a short while longer, then lay down in the brush and dirt near where he sat and seemingly fell asleep, his breaths soon coming in a series of calm, relaxed snores. The nursing student and I stayed up for a while longer. The conversation between us was brief, with long gaps between words; we exchanged names (although I don’t think I ever actually registered hers) and a few other details about ourselves, but besides these few short episodes, we mostly allowed the crackling fire and the distant crashing waves to do the talking.

Eventually our conversation turned to the stranger.

“Where did he come from?” I asked, my voice dropped to a low whisper.

“I don’t know,” she said. “The storm came to a stop not long after you passed out, and then he kind of just… showed up. Didn’t even introduce himself. He helped me build the fire and brought our injured friend closer to it, where we looked him over and assessed his injuries.”

“Strange,” I said. “Where was he during the storm?”

“He hasn’t told me. In fact, he hasn’t said *anything* about himself at all. And that’s really had me thinking.”

“What do you mean?” I asked.

“I mean do you even remember seeing him when we boarded our plane?”

“No,” I admitted, “but I don’t remember seeing you or the injured guy, either.” I paused. “Why? Do you think he wasn’t on our plane or something? How could he possibly be here with us, then?”

“I don’t know,” she said again. “I just get the sense that he… doesn’t belong. It’s hard to explain, but I just feel a very uncomfortable energy from him.”

“Well, we’ll keep an eye on him,” I said. “He’s been helpful enough so far. Could be that he’s a little socially awkward, is all. Maybe a bit of a loner.”

“Maybe,” she said. “Maybe I’m overly exhausted and I’m just being paranoid, but something about this whole situation — this whole *place* — just feels wrong.”

“Wrong how?” I asked.

“You’ve been out cold for a little while, so maybe you just don’t feel it yet, but *I* do. I just can’t shake the feeling like we aren’t *welcome* here, like there’s something watching us from the darkness, waiting for us to let our guard down. And I can’t help but feel like *he* is a part of it.”

We both glanced in the direction of the sleeping stranger, then back to each other.

“Maybe I’ll go with him when he gets the lay of the land tomorrow,” she said. “Try to get some information out of him, see if his story checks out.”

“Let *me* go,” I said. “Our injured friend will need a medical professional to look after him.”

“I told you I’ve barely got one semester of nursing school under my belt,” she said.

I offered her a tired smile. “That’s still more experience than *I* have.”

“I guess you’re right,” she said, returning the smile. “Fine. But be careful around him, alright? There’s no telling what he’ll do when the two of you are alone together.”

She and I took turns staying on watch that night. My time spent awake, watching the darkness beyond our camp, helped me to understand what she had meant when she said that something was off about our new home. Something definitely felt sinister about the place, something that, even thinking back on it now, sends a chill racing all over my body. At the time I figured it was possible the young woman’s words had placed this sensation into my mind, but as I sat near the fire on watch, I couldn’t help but feel like there was something or some*things* watching us — watching *me* — from the heavy darkness. The nearby shore, the surrounding trees, even the depths of the cave where the water dripped into the abyss; wherever there was an absence of light, there was an abundance of eyes. And they were all turned in the same direction.

The stranger and our injured companion didn’t stir for the rest of night, until the coming of dawn when the former seemed to rise like clockwork at the first trickle of sunlight. I was on watch when he awoke; he sat up with an almost inhuman roboticness that made my skin want to crawl right off of my body. Maybe the nursing student was right, I thought. Maybe something *was* wrong with the stranger. Or maybe her paranoia had infected me too. It was difficult to tell.

The young woman and the injured man awoke shortly after, but the latter was in a state of such pain and agony that he was practically incoherent, and drifted between states of consciousness the way parts from our plane surely drifted along the surface of the nearby ocean.

The stranger didn’t speak for nearly an hour after waking. He sat in his same spot, stoking the fire and resupplying it with fresh kindling, before abruptly standing and saying, to nobody in particular: “Going to take a look around. See what I can find.”

“I’ll come with you,” I said, perhaps too quickly.

He offered me an apathetic look. “Would be able to move more quickly on my own.”

“You’re also more likely to hurt yourself and not have anybody to come help you,” the nursing student said. She knelt next to the semi-conscious injured man and felt his forehead. I could tell by her grimace that he was likely running concerningly warm, despite what his intermittent shivers would have suggested.

The stranger thought about this for a moment. “Alright. But keep up.”

I nodded, climbed to my feet with a groan, and offered the nursing student and her patient one final glance before departing into the unknown with the stranger. I had the strangest fear that I would never see either of them again. This fear was later proved to be unfounded, of course — I would still see *one* of them yet, at the very least.

I followed the stranger back to the beach, which looked so much smaller in the morning sunlight. The azure ocean, more inviting than its obsidian counterpart, was still just as imposing in its vastness as its nighttime self. Even in the light of day, it was obvious that the endless body of water could easily swallow us whole if it chose to, and I didn’t intend to give it a reason to do so. I still saw no sign of the plane wreckage, and figured it had either long-since sank to the bottom of the ocean, or had otherwise drifted beyond the gently crashing waves to a point that I could not see with my naked eye.

The stranger drew a deep line in the sand with his boot. “Gonna get an idea of how far around this island is, see if we can’t make a full loop of it in a decent time.” He started walking, not waiting for me, and I hustled to square up next to him. Each step through the heavy sand felt like trudging through a dense pool of water to my aching body, but the stranger hardly seemed to notice the extra effort. “After that, we’d best head inland and look for a water source. That’s most important of all.”

His words made me realize just how thirsty I was. The creeping pain of dehydration hurt more than any pangs of hunger that I felt. My head pounded with the absence of water; my pulpy, scabbed tongue screamed for mercy. “How long do you think we’ll be here?”

“Could be days,” he said bluntly. “Could be years.”

“*Years*?” The word felt impossible on my swollen tongue.

He nodded without looking at me. “Not every missing flight gets found. I heard about a flight filled with college students that went down over this very stretch of the Atlantic a number of years ago. They eventually had to give up the search — probably much more quickly than you’d like to know.”

I frowned at the thought, but said nothing. When the stranger realized he wouldn’t be getting a response, he went on. “If we’re going to be here for a while, then we’re going to have to trust each other. That means no scheming behind each others’ backs.”

These words brought me to a sudden halt. He did the same, and our eyes finally met. To my surprise, there was no anger in the stranger’s gaze; in fact, there didn’t appear to be much of anything there at all. “I’m good at lookin’ like I’m asleep, ain’t I?”

I waited a while to respond, not sure what to say. The words I finally chose felt weak, pathetic. “I’m sorry.”

He nodded and began walking again. I followed his lead. “For what it’s worth, I *do* remember seeing you on that flight yesterday. Can’t say the same for the other two. Doesn’t mean they weren’t there, but… Again, for what it’s worth.”

“Are you saying you think they weren’t on the flight?”

“What I mean is that we probably have more to worry about than just gettin’ food and water here,” he said. “I’ll give that girl credit, she was right about this place. Somethin’ is wrong here. I didn’t sleep a wink last night, despite what you may have thought. I was too busy keeping my ears open; too busy listening to all the strange sounds in the darkness, many of which you may have even missed. I felt that presence, felt its eyes on me. There was somethin’ out there, beyond the light of our fire. And it was watching us, make no mistake about it.”

“An animal?” I asked.

He shook his head.

We didn’t speak much after that. We completed our loop in less than thirty minutes and confirmed that we were, in fact, on an island. Besides a brief few yards where we had to walk along the thicket, the beach remained uninterrupted, allowing for a straightforward journey along our circle.

When we reached his line in the sand, the stranger stopped and looked at me. “Well, that settles that. Next we need to look for something to drink. A stream, some coconuts, anything.”

“I heard some dripping water coming from somewhere in the cave,” I said.

“I did too,” he said, “and I didn’t like the sound of it.”

He didn’t elaborate on what he meant.

We doubled back and entered a less dense section of the thicket, searching for food, water, anything that could help sustain us. It was dark beneath that heavy crown of trees; the gloom made me think of the obsidian ocean the night before. I was suddenly reminded of the dead pilot, who had once lay sprawled out in the cold, wet, sand before vanishing in an instant. I hadn’t thought back to that moment since coming to the injured man’s aid, but the memory had managed to conjure itself from the great, suffocating darkness and force its way back into my troubled mind. I considered mentioning what I had seen to the stranger, but thought better of it; to verbally recall such a wicked occurrence felt dangerous in a place such as this.

The stranger led me past tree trunks and overtop tangled roots, deeper and deeper into that arboreal labyrinth, until I could no longer see the beach through all the foliage. I tried not to show my hesitation in following the man, but in truth, I still struggled to trust him. Part of me wondered if he was luring me into that sinister collection of trees and earth so that he could do to me what he had already done to the pilot’s soaked, decaying corpse. I did my best to banish this thought, but it lingered, acting as a barrier between the stranger and me that kept me from straying too close to him. 

The world around me grew dark as the sun above us vanished. We seemed to walk for hours, though I knew this couldn’t have been possible; the island wasn’t large enough for us to penetrate its inland for longer than a quarter of an hour at most. If we kept on how we were, we’d eventually make it to the opposite beach from where we had started. I knew this to be true; it simply had to be.

Except it wasn’t.

We kept going and going for countless minutes, hours, days, never finding the other end of the thicket. Darkness further enveloped us, obscuring our vision and thus our ability to perform our task — our entire reason for entering the forest in the first place. I could barely see the stranger in front of me, his form becoming more and more obscured by shadow with each step forward. I told him we needed to turn back, to find our way out of the forest. He remained deaf to my words.

A sudden snapping of a twig stole my attention. I turned in its direction for the briefest of moments, imagining that when my gaze reached its destination, it would be greeted by some dark, sinister form lurking in the shadows. When I saw nothing but more tree trunks and blackness, I cautiously returned my attention to the man leading me through the thicket. In that brief moment, the stranger had managed to disappear.

“Sir?” I called, realizing I had never learned his name. My own voice sounded far away, muffled, as if the gloom itself were choking me. “Sir? Where are you?”

Swirling darkness. Sounds of shuffling in the brush. The growing, thickening sense that stepping into this wood was a mistake, the thought that at any moment the thing stalking me, the presence that had been watching me since the previous night, was preparing to strike. I imagined the deep, Stygian tide squirming up from the ocean and pulling the pilot into the frigid depths, and I knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that those same watery tendrils were coming toward me now, winding through the trees on their way to me, ready to drag me kicking and screaming and swallowing brine back to the waiting abyss.

I grew dizzy. My vision became darker, merging with the gloom. Something was coming. Something was here.

I felt a firm hand on my shoulder. Snapping out of my own panicked bubble, I turned and saw the stranger, his stern eyes looking at me through the gloom. He had somehow gotten behind me, or I had somehow gotten ahead of him.

“This is useless,” he said. “We can’t see a damn thing in this place. Come on, let’s get out of here.”

It took us barely a minute to find our way back out to the section of beach that we had just stepped away from. Coming out into the sunshine, catching my breath and taking in that crisp ocean air, I thought that the worst of my ordeal was over.

What I didn’t realize, what I couldn’t possibly have realized, was that it was only just beginning.

I wanted to ask the stranger if he’d experienced the same overwhelming sensation that I had while in the forest, but I was afraid of his answer. As it turned out, I wouldn’t have to be the one to broach the subject. We’d only walked a handful of steps before the stranger stopped us in our tracks and looked at me. “I felt it too.”

I frowned at him. “Felt what?”

“That presence,” he said. “There, among the trees. It was the same presence that watched us all through the night. There’s evil on this island with us; this much I believe without a shadow of a doubt.”

“What do you think it is?”

“I haven’t a clue,” he said, “and I’m not sure I want to know.”

The camp was deserted, the fire in shambles. A few long, smoldering branches scattered about the place were all that remained of the blaze, save for the pitiful smoke which billowed up from the gray ashes in the center of the old pit. The nursing student was gone, and, even more strangely, so was the injured man.

I called out for our lost companions, but received no response.

“What happened here?” I said. “Where could they have gone?”

The stranger, who stood closer to the mouth of the cave, looked deep into the darkness of the cavern. I stepped closer and followed his gaze. Though the black curtain beyond the mouth was impenetrable by human eyes, my ears caught the sound of a distant, familiar voice, one screaming in agony over his broken legs.

“How’d he get in there?” I asked.

“How else does a man with two broken legs get anywhere?” he said. “He certainly didn’t move there himself.”

“You mean *it* took him there?” I said.

He nodded. “And I think it’ll take *us* too, if we let it.”

I looked into the darkness of the cave, then back to my companion. “We have to go help him.”

“Nothing we can do for him now,” the stranger said. “That thing *wants* you to go after him so it can get you alone too. Then you’ll end up just like him.”

I listened to the injured man’s cries of agony continuing to echo from somewhere deep within the cave. “But we can’t just leave him in there!”

“We can,” the stranger said. “Hell, I doubt if that’s even his real voice.” He picked up one of the smoldering branches. “That poor fella is likely already gone by now.”

“What are you going to do with that?”

“Only thing I *can* do now,” he said. “Gonna burn this whole place to the ground and pray that the fire is enough to purge the evil that rots here. Or at the very least keeps it contained to that cave.”

I looked at him, then once again turned my eyes back at the wailing cave. After another moment I picked up one of the smoldering branches and turned toward the cavern’s waiting lips. “I have to go after him.”

“You’ll die,” the stranger said plainly. “Die or worse. But I won’t stop you.”

These were the last words I ever heard from him. Without looking back, I blew on my smoldering branch in order to reignite some of its flame, ducked into the shallow mouth of the cave, and allowed the darkness to take me.

My makeshift torch did little to light the way ahead, and so I was forced to use the injured man’s agonized cries to guide me through the squirming, smothering darkness. I thought about the presence. How long had it been on this island? Centuries? Eternities? Since time immemorial, just waiting for poor castaways like us to arrive on its demonic shores? I couldn’t ever know, nor was I sure I even wanted to.

I understood that the stranger was right about this most likely being a trap. I was almost certainly shuffling toward my own death, but I couldn’t bring myself to turn back around. I had to know for sure whether the injured man was down there; if I abandoned him without knowing the truth, it would have haunted me for the rest of my life— as long or as short as that was meant to be.

The injured man’s voice came from everywhere and nowhere. Sometimes it seemed to suddenly grow louder, then just as quickly fade away. Soon it disappeared entirely, replaced by the sound of dripping water, which was itself replaced by the sound of a small, flowing stream. By now I was certain that the injured man wasn’t actually down there, but I couldn’t turn back. The presence was guiding me forward; the only reason it allowed me to continue on was because I was choosing to bend to its whim. To defy it would surely only bring about my premature doom.

I saw the stream of water, which looked to flow from out of a nearby wall only to quickly disappear beyond my torch’s glow, back into the waiting gloom. A silhouette crouched there, greedily drinking from the stream. As I drew within arm’s length of the running water, I realized that the silhouette had become — or it always *was* — my own shadow, doing what I so desperately wished I could do. I suddenly forgot all about the injured man, and his agonized cries. I forgot about wanting to leave that cave, about wanting to go home. All I could focus on was the insatiable desire to quench my thirst.

The cool, rushing water beckoned my parched lips, sang to my crumbling tongue like a siren. I leaned closer, answering its sweet call, until I could feel its racing chill right in front of my face. All I had to do was lean just a little bit farther.

But then I stopped. Something inside of me, something small but mighty, told me that I couldn’t drink that water. It told me that I needed to get as far away from that stream as I possibly could. Heeding this inner voice, I sat up, pulling my face away from the stream with great, almost insurmountable difficulty.

Only to have it shoved back down, directly into the rushing deluge.

The torch fell from my grip as my face slammed into the earthen surface beneath the waiting water. I heard the nursing student’s whispering voice in my ear, telling me to open my mouth, to suckle from the vitality of the stream. I fought to keep my dry, crackled lips shut against the antagonizing flow for as long as I could, but soon the voice’s suggestion, or maybe even my own, forced those same lips open, and allowed the water to enter me freely. Its cool, soothing touch ran over my teeth and embraced my aching tongue. I sat there, my face pressed against the stream, for close to thirty seconds, sure that my fate was to drown there in the dark, my body no longer my own.

But then I felt the pressure against my skull lessen, and I managed to pull away. I sat there, soaking wet and gasping, for only a few short moments before I snatched up my torch, still barely alive with its red glow, and rushed away from the stream, back in the direction that I thought I had come from. I heard the woman’s voice telling me to wait, but I ignored her. I just kept going, kept fighting my way through the dark, slicing through the shadows with my torch like a scythe through wheat.

It was already dusk when I finally emerged from the cave. Hours somehow had passed while I was deep within the bowels of the island. I stood up and rushed past the remnants of the fire, calling for the stranger, asking him where he was. It wasn’t until I found his own branch lying in the brush, no longer smoldering but dead and cold, that I understood his fate.

And yet still I called for him. “Sir!” I said. “Where are you?!”

“Gone.”

I turned around at the sound of the nursing student’s voice. She was in the mouth of the cave, her body having found a way to stand fully upright despite the aperture only providing enough space for her to crouch. When she saw that I saw her, she smiled kindly at me. “Or perhaps he was never there to begin with.”

I stared at her for several long seconds. I had so many burning questions that I wanted to ask her, but no voice with which to ask them, and so I remembered some of the stranger’s final words and did the only thing I thought I could: I threw my torch into the nearby brush, and I watched the fresh blaze grow.

I looked back at the nursing student. I expected her to recoil back into the cave, cursing in some ancient, furious language as the inferno began to consume the surrounding foliage. Instead, she just looked at me and continued to smile. It wasn’t a sinister smile; her lips didn’t curl away from impossibly long, sharp fangs, or twist into a devastating smirk. It was the subtle, close-lipped smile that you offer a stranger who you lock eyes with while you both wait for your drink at a coffee shop. At the time, I didn’t understand what she had to smile about, but I do now.

She was smiling because she had won.



The island was swallowed by the flame. Its bright blaze attracted the attention of a nearby fishing barge, which made its way to the unintended beacon, thus coming to my rescue. I stood on the ship watching the island disappear behind us, its all-consuming inferno visible for hours before finally falling out of sight.

The authorities found no sign of anybody else surviving that plane crash. As far as they understood it, I was the only person to make it to that island alive. An act of God, they said. I might have called it something else.

With great difficulty I returned to my normal life, and in the coming weeks, I thought that everything had gone back to how it was supposed to be. I thought I was free from whatever it was that tormented me on that island. I thought it was gone forever.

But I was wrong.

I started feeling that presence — that *evil* — rising up inside of me just a few days ago. It whispers in my ear while I try to sleep, torments me in my dreams. I had thought I’d escaped its terrible grasp, but I realize now that it had purposely let me go.

It had let me go because it knew I was taking it with me.

I can’t help but think it would have been better if I had died in that plane crash. Had I simply perished like all the others, the presence would still be trapped on that island. It haunts me even now, as I struggle to write these final words. I feel it slithering down my throat and coiling in my stomach like some otherworldly parasite, or like a cold, flowing stream of water. Thanks to me, the presence from the island has escaped from its eternal prison. It’s inside of me now.

And I don’t think it intends to stay there for long.
