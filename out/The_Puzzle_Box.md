I’ve owned Gold King Pawn Shop for almost twenty years, and in that time, I’ve seen my fair share of bizarre and unsettling items. Old photographs where the faces were scratched out, dolls with unsettlingly human-like glass eyes, even an antique music box that played by itself for a week straight until I finally burned it. But nothing—not a single thing—has ever burrowed into my mind the way that puzzle box did.

The man who sold it to me was unremarkable. Mid-fifties, worn-out denim jacket, smelled faintly of mildew and something sour. He placed the box on the counter without a word.

“You selling?” I asked, already giving it a once-over.

It was small, about the size of a grapefruit, and made of interlocking wooden panels, inlaid with tarnished brass. The wood had a dark, oily sheen, and the grain seemed to swirl unnaturally. There were no visible seams, no hinges—just a pattern of shifting geometric shapes, like an Escher drawing come to life.

The man nodded. “I don’t want it.” His voice was hoarse, almost afraid.

“Any idea what it is?”

He shook his head. “Just take it.”

I should’ve known better. I did know better. But I took it anyway. I gave the guy ten bucks, and he practically sprinted out of the shop.

I should’ve left it alone.

At first, I kept the box on my desk in the back room. I’d idly turn it over in my hands while doing inventory or counting the register. The surface was cool to the touch, even in the dead heat of summer.

Eventually, I started messing with it. The brass inlays shifted under my fingertips, sliding with an unnatural smoothness. The patterns realigned themselves in ways that shouldn’t have been physically possible, twisting and folding inward like a fourth-dimensional trick.

That was when the dreams started.

Dark corridors stretching endlessly in all directions. Shapes moving just beyond sight, whispering my name in a wet, clicking language that made my skull ache.

I’d wake up with my hands aching, my nails cracked and bleeding as if I’d been scratching at something in my sleep. And always, always, the box would be on my nightstand, even though I knew I’d left it in the shop.

After several weeks, I finally solved it.

I don’t remember how. I was in the back room, the shop long since closed, the neon OPEN sign flickering outside. My hands moved on their own, twisting and pressing in ways that felt instinctual, inevitable.

With a final click, the box unfolded, the wooden panels peeling back like the petals of some ancient, rotting flower. Inside was—nothing. A void. A space that should not have been there.

And then the lights went out.

I heard them before I saw them. The wet slither of too many limbs. The rasp of air being drawn through too many mouths. The clicking.

They poured out of the box. Long, centipede-like bodies, writhing and wriggling, their gelatinous flesh reflecting the dim emergency light from the EXIT sign. Their heads were wrong—too human, too familiar. Faces I recognized.

The man who sold me the box.

My grandfather.

Myself.

They swarmed toward me, and I ran.

I don’t remember getting home. I locked the door, shoved a chair under the handle, and sat on my bed, shaking. The box was gone. Not in my hands, not in my pockets. Just… gone.

But I can still hear them. The wet clicks. The rustling of too many limbs against too many surfaces.

I've closed the shop. I don’t go outside after dark.

And sometimes, when I close my eyes, I feel the weight of the box in my hands again.

Waiting.
