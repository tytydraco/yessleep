I've been camping in the woods for two weeks. Long enough for the world outside to feel distant, unreal. My food supply is running low, but I don’t mind. Out here, the quiet is intoxicating. I spend most of my time wandering through the woods, probably straying further from my tent than is actually advised. I can’t help it. I want to forget society exists. And sometimes I find cool stuff.

Yesterday, I found a horse.

At least, I thought it was a horse at first.

It stood in the clearing, framed by skeletal pines, its coat impossibly white. The air around it shimmered, like heat rising off asphalt. Its mane was long, silken, and a twisted horn jutted from its forehead, reflecting the dull light of an overcast sky.

That’s when I realized, “holy shit, that’s a unicorn.”

My first thought—insane, childish—felt like a dream breaking through reality. There was no way it could be anything else. It looked just like every depiction of the white equines I’ve ever seen. It was magnetic to look at, drew me in, made me want to talk out there and see just how soft that fur was.

Thankfully, I saw the carcass before leaving the tent.

A bear, ripped open from throat to belly, its insides spilled onto the pine needles. Steam still rose from the glistening ropes of intestine. The smell—thick, coppery, wrong—curdled my stomach.

The unicorn dipped its head, muzzle dark with blood, and bit deep into the bear’s ruined chest. It tore away a chunk of meat, the wet sound of it nearly sending me to my knees.

I should have run.

I should have backed away slowly, silently.

But I stood frozen, breath stuck in my throat. I had never seen anything so grotesque. The picture of innocence, devouring the flesh of something it *had* to have killed itself.

As I watched, the unicorn shoved its muzzle into the soft, blood-wet folds of flesh. There was an awful squelching sound as it rooted around. When it straightened back up, thick strands of rapidly cooling blood dripped from velvetine lips and onto the needle-thick floor below. It’s ears flicked, once, twice, and then it turned toward me.

Its eyes weren’t a horse’s eyes. They weren’t even an animal’s. They were black. Deep, endless voids, too large, too knowing. Strings of flesh clung to its teeth, and when it chewed, I could hear the wetness of the sound.

I stumbled backward, my boot snapping a branch. The creature’s ears flicked, and it took a step toward me, hooves pressing into the wet earth, leaving behind something darker than mud. The scent of decay rolled off it in waves, suffocating, like an open grave.

I turned and ran.

Branches whipped my face, roots clawed at my ankles, but I didn’t stop. Behind me, I heard it move—slow at first, then faster. A steady, measured trot, the sound of hoofbeats echoing through the trees.

I don’t know how I made it back to camp. I don’t remember how I got inside my tent, hands shaking so violently I nearly ripped the zipper. I spent the night curled in my sleeping bag, buck knife clutched to my chest, heart hammering against my ribs. There was a moment around midnight where I swear I could hear hooves moving again, but nothing trampled my tent.

This morning, I forced myself outside. The woods were silent. No birds, no wind. The trees loomed too close, their bark split and weeping something dark. It only took a second look to realize that something thin and sharp had been scraping into the trunks, leaving behind deep gauges.

My stomach twisted into tight knots. The forest no longer felt like a safe haven or a way to escape the crash of reality. Especially not when I stepped further into the morning light and saw the hoofprints circling my tent.

I left.

It didn’t matter how much I had loved the quiet or how badly I had wanted to escape society. None of it mattered anymore. Something was out there with me—that creature had circled my tent in the night—and I wasn’t about to wait around and see what happened next.

My hands shook as I tore down camp, stuffing my sleeping bag into my pack and rolling up my tent with frantic, clumsy fingers. I left behind anything that slowed me down—food, cookware, even my extra clothes. I slung my pack over my shoulders and took off down the trail, moving fast, too fast, my boots slipping against damp leaves. I didn’t look back. Not until I heard it.

*Hoofbeats.*

Slow at first, then faster.

I spun around, heart hammering, and caught a flash of movement between the trees. White shifting between the skeletal pines. My body moved before my mind caught up—I grabbed the knife from my belt and *threw.*

The blade spun, glinting dully in the weak morning light. Then it sank deep into something soft.

The sound that followed was *not* human.

A shrill, keening wail tore through the woods, sharp enough to send ice racing through my veins. My breath caught as I took an involuntary step forward, stomach twisting.

It was small. Smaller than the one I had seen yesterday. Its coat was white but dull, streaked with dirt and dried blood. Its huge, black, endless eyes locked onto mine, and something in them made my chest constrict.

The knife was buried in its throat. Blood welled up, dark and slow, spilling over its chest in thick, sluggish rivers. Its legs trembled, buckled.

Then it collapsed.

I didn’t stay to watch it die.

I ran.

I *fucking* ran.

The hoofbeats didn’t follow, but I felt something behind me—something massive and *furious*—pressing against my back like the weight of a coming storm. The drive back to civilization was a blur. My hands shook so badly I nearly veered off the dirt road.

Now, I’m sitting in my car at a gas station, typing this out, trying to calm my breathing.

I think I saw a unicorn in the woods. I think I killed its child.

So…what do you think the chances are that this *ends badly for me?*
