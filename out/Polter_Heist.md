It was early autumn 1988 in the Southeast quadrant of Bethelback City. Delaware side. The other half of the city was in Maryland and the laws were a little different over there, so when we picked our target we took that into consideration.

That target was the Frankfort Bank on Claymore Drive. It was on the edge of town, right about as far away from the financial district as respectable people were willing to go. There were some docks northwest on then inlet, ghettos to the southwest, an industrial park northward, and forests to the south, making this spot a confluence of diverse cityscapes. At night this part of the city was desolate making the bank the perfect place for my crew and I to do our work undisturbed.

A couple of the guys were nervous because there had been some unsolved killings nearby in recent weeks and rumors were that the Murky Drizzle was back. That was a term the city had collectively given to an unusual weather phenomena that sometimes made its appearance in the southern part of the city. 

It was characterized by a very light rain combined with a thin fog. The fog would roll in and just hang there about thirty or forty feet above the ground while the rain would float down through it. Sometimes the fog would descend and drift around like a giant, wispy ghost. When the Murky Drizzle came around, it is said, the paranormal comes with it and people start to die.

I didn't buy any of that crap, but I was nervous just the same due to the fact that I had to rob a bank with a bunch of superstitious, paranoid fools. Garry and Nathan were the two I was mostly concerned with. They were great at their jobs though so I'd have to deal with it. 

Garry was my lock picker and safe cracker. Best in the business. He had a ball of curly blonde-red hair on his head which made him easy to spot in a crowd. Nathan was our lookout, heavy lifter, and getaway driver. Burly guy with short dark hair. 

Slightly less superstitious was Tyson. He was one of those nerdy dudes with glasses. First in his class and brilliant at disarming alarms, rewiring phone systems, and bypassing security cameras. He's also tops at hacking electronic locks on safes in case we run into that. He worked full time for the phone company but can't turn down the challenge of a good heist. 

Then there was me. They call me Lamar, but that's my middle name. I never disclose my real or full name to anyone regarding any of my crimes. Why would I? I was the mastermind of the whole operation. I pick the banks, find the blueprints, design the plan, and do a variety of necessary tasks along the way. I hired these guys. This was my gig.

In those days there were no smartphones, cellphones, or any thing like that. Few people even had pagers back then. But Nathan had handed out walkie talkies to us. Those were small two way radios people used to use. He'd also be monitoring the police band but in Bethelback the cops didn't like to use the radio much because they were always trying to beat each other to the punch seeing as how there were competing governments there. Strange place to live. Even stranger place to be a criminal.

Since we'd not necessarily be able to tell if we'd been discovered from listening to the police band, we had an alternate method figured out. In the center of the city was the old Belltower building. Back in the 1940's they used to use the mast on top of it as a dock for loading and unloading passengers on and off of the companies many passenger dirigibles. They didn't fly them anymore but the building was still in use. One of the current uses for it of course was a radio tower along with WBEL AM talk radio. 

Late at night 10 p.m. to 5 a.m., Leslie Bower Ann hosted her show 'After Midnight'. Her studio at the top of the building had windows on all sides. She looked out over the city from on high reporting on everything she saw. Every fire, police car lights, weather, and everything else. People would call in and tell her what was going on which she reported over the air in real time. If there were cops headed our way, she'd let us know.

We entered the building just after midnight when the traffic had died down to next to nothing. Tyson had climbed a ladder up to a small electronics box, opened it, and disabled the door alarms and cut the phone lines. He waved down to us signalling to Garry, who then did his stuff on the rear access door in the back alley. Within two minutes we were in. 

There was a dark hallway leading from the door on the inside past a few offices and coming out in the lobby at the front of the building. The vault was downstairs one floor but we'd have to cross the lobby and get through two locked sliding grated doors to get there.

Garry and I walked through the lobby to the first door in front of the stairwell after Tyson closed the rear door and blacked out the security cameras with spray paint. Nathan set up in the lobby where he could see out the front windows and look back down the hall at the same time.

As Garry started to work on the first door, Tyson removed a small portable radio from his bag and turned it on. The familiar voice spoke quietly out of the speakers. It was soothing yet somewhat spooky. She never used background music. It was just her voice surrounded by silence. And she reported being able to see from her perch on high, southwest of her, to the south of our location, the Murky Drizzle travelling north. Heading right towards us. 

"It's After Midnight in Bethelback City. I'm your host Leslie tonight as every night. We've got a small fire in the Northeast Quad at Bob's Hardware on Port road. Firetrucks are on the scene. But the big news tonight is to the south. 

That's right you guessed it. The Murky Drizzle has returned so be watchful out there."

Garry stopped what he was doing and looked over at Nathan nervously. "Don't look at him," I said, "just get the lock open. For Christ's sake you guys. It's just a little fog and rain."

Garry said nothing and went back to picking the lock on the first door. Tyson was in one of the offices screwing around with the intercom system. Nathan peered out the window and spoke quietly. "I see it."

I walked over to the window and took a look. "It's a few miles out," he said, "you can see it on the horizon between those buildings." He pointed.

"Relax. It's just a light fog and some rain," I reminded them. Leslie's calming voice on the radio focused our minds like a hypnotist while we worked in silence.

"Notice to everyone in the Southeast Quadrant tonight. I just received a call from a listener down your way. It seems their house was engulfed in the Murky Drizzle while I had them on the line. I can't confirm it of course but here's what they reported. 

She said the drizzle started and the mist descended around her house. The caller was home alone and looked out the window and could see shadows darting back and forth in the fog through her yard. Her dog was outside and she heard him yelp and then go quiet. 

She checked all the doors and windows to make sure they were locked when she heard something break in her kitchen. It sounded like some dishes crashing to the floor. She closed and locked the door to the room she was in which was her bedroom and then called me. While I was on the phone with her something began pounding on her bedroom door in a slow beating rhythm. I could hear it myself over the phone. The last thing she said was that there was mist filling her room coming under the door. Then the line went dead. 

Was it a prank call or do we have another victim of the Murky Drizzle? I don't know but the caller did give me her address and my producer here called the Southeast Quadrant Police Department. Please for the sake of this woman if she is indeed in need, I'd ask the other police departments to stay away this time. We don't need another turf war. Hear me boys? Behave. The time is 12:23 a.m. and this is WBEL, After Midnight with Leslie Bower Ann."

Nathan spoke up. "Did you hear that?"

I shook my head. "She's just doing it for the ratings. That woman was a prank if she called at all."

Just then, Garry slid the grated door to the side breaking the quiet with it's loud metallic clanging and the tiny roar of its rollers. He looked over at me. "One down," he said.

He and I moved down the first flight of stairs to the second metal grated door. He began picking the lock. Meanwhile, Tyson and I were beaming our flashlights through the grating to get a look inside the next room. "I don't see anything I haven't already disabled," he said. "But there's probably something. Might be an auxiliary power source in there. When the door opens don't go in. Let me check some things first." I nodded my agreement.

Tyson and Garry were busy doing their stuff but it was taking a while so I went back up to the lobby where Nathan was staring out the front window. He glanced over at me with one hand holding the earpiece he was using to monitor the police band. "Airwaves are clean," he said.

I looked out the window myself then. In the distance the light mist was visible like a sheet. The streetlights beyond lit the haze with a dim orange glow. It was quiet in the lobby except for the low calming tenor of Leslie's voice.

"It's 12:39 in Bethelback City and if you live in the Southeast Quad and don't have to go outside, then please stay in tonight. There's something out there tonight. Something in the dark. Something in the haze. An evil in the rain. 

It's moving northward slowly. It's gotten up to 54th street. It's staying to the east of the peninsula so if you're downtown you'll probably be okay. 

I just got off the phone with a man on 56th. He said he was walking his dog when the drizzle started. The mist flowed down covering the intersection where he had stopped. His dog began to wimper and hid behind his leg. Looking across the street he witnessed several sets of light green eyes glowing through the haze. They moved about as if watching him. He suddenly felt an intense sense of dread come over him. 

He turned and quickly walked back toward his home. He said he was too afraid to look back even though he could hear raspy breathing behind him that sounded as if whatever it was were following him. 

He rushed inside and locked the doors. He peeked out one time and saw the eyes again stopped in front of his house seemingly staring at him so he took his dog and locked himself in the bathroom. His phone was on a long extension cord so he brought it in with him and used it to call the police and then to call me.

Was it just some animal's eye-shine or was it something else? Something in the mist. Something in the rain."

Nathan leered at me, clearly in fear. "We need to go man. That fog is on the way here?"

I rolled my eyes. "Afraid of a little weather?"

"You heard her man! There's spirits in the Murky Drizzle. Evil spirits," he exclaimed. 

I just shook my head. "It's just a show Nathan. A radio show. It isn't real. It's like that War of the Worlds thing  Orson Welles did in the 30's." 

He didn't appear to be calmed by this. "You're listening to the police band," I said. "Any cops responding to the Southeast Quad?" He shook his head 'no'. "Okay then. If they ain't taking it seriously then why should we?"

He paused in thought for a second and then replied in a low, half hearted tone. "I guess you're right. They'd have gotten calls on this when it came around before. They'd know it was real if it was."

Tyson called me down to the second door and asked to see the blueprints again. I got it out of my bag as Garry slid the second door open. We examined the layout on the page with our flashlights.

The vault room was a large square about thirty feet on all sides. The vault door was on the opposite wall from the stairwell where we were. The room was lined with safety deposit boxes but we weren't messing with those. We only wanted what was in the vault itself.

The blueprints showed the security cameras which should already have been disabled. But nothing more. Tyson pointed to some small boxes that ran along the bottom of the far wall near the floor. There were three of them. "Those look like electric eyes," he said. "They send out an infrared light invisible to the human eye. There should be sensors on this side of the room which detects the beams. If anything breaks the beam, the alarm goes off. I've cut the power but I don't trust it. It was too easy. I bet they're running on an auxiliary power source in the wall."

I put my hand on my chin to think. "Any way to tell for sure if they're on?" I asked.

He sat back and stared off for a minute. "If we could take a picture with IR film and blew some smoke across the floor, and could develop the film we'd see it reflected off the smoke. Short of that I can't think of any way to know for sure."

"Dammit," I said, "I wish we could've gotten a look down here before we came out."

"There was no way to know Lamar," he said. "There was nothing on the blueprints and we couldn't find an inside man to scope it out for us. These smaller banks don't usually go to this length."

I ran my hands through my hair. "Let me think about this. If I can't think of something in ten minutes then we'll call it and go." He nodded as I stood up and started ascending the stairs. 

I approached the front window in the lobby where Garry had joined Nathan in watching the Murky Drizzle in the distance. "Any sign of cops?" I asked.

Nathan shook his head. "No one's even driven past the whole time we've been in here. This bank was a great pick. Out of the way and in an area that's desolate at night."

I stared out the window again myself. Across the street was a camera shop. Too bad we wouldn't have time to actually develop some film, I thought, we could break in there, steal a camera and some infrared film, and use their darkroom. But there just wasn't enough time to do all that. 

Leslie was back on the radio again. I pondered our situation while she gave her latest report.

"It's 1 a.m. and this is After Midnight with yours truly, Leslie Bower Ann. Update on the Murky Drizzle in the Southeast Quadrant: I just got off the phone with a police officer who wishes to remain anonymous. He relayed to me that he and his partner listen to the show and they saw a couple of police cars from the Southwest Quad speed past them running silent with their police lights turned off, headed south. Though they work for the Southwest Quad, they decided to follow them to see what was going on. 

They headed right into the rain and fog and stopped at a small house. The other police entered the house and soon came back out and got on the radio. They got out of their squad car and approached the men, reassuring them that they didn't want any trouble but were just curious. Was it the woman who called in to my show, they asked. Turns out it was and she was found dead inside her bedroom. The officer didn't give me any more details but said he thought I should know since I spoke to her.

Looking out over the city, I can see the ambulance headed their way now. It's flashing lights make the fog pulsate with red light. In case you doubted the seriousness of the Drizzle, heed my warning. Stay indoors tonight. Whatever you do. Don't even look outside. If you see the Drizzle, the Drizzle sees you."

I glanced at Nathan. "Heard the call for the ambulance?" I asked.

He nodded. "I thought it was a heart attack. They didn't say she was dead."

"It was a home intruder Nathan. A common criminal. Pure coincidence that the woman thought it had something to do with the mist and rain." 

He nodded again. This time he was solemn. "I'm sure that's what it was."

My eyes drifted back to the camera shop when I noticed a sign in the window. It said 'Polaroid'. That's it! I rushed back downstairs. Tyson looked up from the blueprints and saw me coming.

"Tyson, across the street is a camera shop. They have Polaroid cameras. We don't need to develop the film."

He shook his head. "But those don't take pictures in infrared light."

"Yes, they do. They're too cheap to have IR filers on the lenses. All we have to do is block the visual light over the lens with something that still let's the infrared light through." I explained.

"Like what?" he asked.

"A piece of exposed film on a roll that's already been developed. It's completely black to the eye but infrared passes right through it. We just find one in the darkroom over there - probably plenty in the trashcan. Hold it over the lens so the visible light won't wash out the infrared and take the picture. Do you smoke?" I asked.

He nodded and produced a pack of Lucky Strike's from his pocket. "Great, we're in business then. One more question though. If the electric eyes are on, what then?"

He looked up at me with a grimace on his face. "Then we go home."

I called everyone together in the lobby and explained everything and that we'd have to break into the camera shop. This didn't go over well to say the least. It was that or we'd be going home empty handed. To their credit, the guys faced their fears and agreed. They brought the radio though. 

We exited the building in the back alley, walked around the side and crossed the street unseen. We entered the camera store in much the same way we did the bank: back door, cut power, disabled phone line and alarms. Tyson said the security system was amateur. Cameras off, and no other sensors in the building with power. We were safe to move about.

The radio was running on batteries. Garry turned it on while we conducted a search by flashlight. We quickly found the Polaroid camera and film we needed and located the on site darkroom.

Tyson and I entered the darkroom and began our search for a piece of exposed film. From in there we could still hear that familiar voice on the radio. Once again she delivered her warnings and updates on the situation outside. For the first time a bit of panic welled up in my gut. I just wanted to find what we came for and get back to the bank as soon as possible. I was beginning to believe her.

"It's 1:30 a.m. in Bethelback and the Murky Drizzle continues it's path northward. It's past 49th street now, and  appears to be moving much faster than before. If you're on the south side of Claymore, Pine, Jefferson, or Hartford street between 40th and 50th then lock your doors now and stay inside. If you're in a car then please, drive east or north. You can outrun it in a car, but probably not on foot."

Tyson gave me a nervous look. "That's us," he said. 

"I know. Just keep looking." I shot back as I frantically dug through the trashcan.

Just as I found a few strips of exposed developed film in the bottom of the can, I heard Garry from the front room calling out. "Guys. We gotta go!" he said. "It's just a couple blocks away. We can see it through the window!"

Tyson and I briskly walked into the front room and looked out the window. A few blocks down, the mist slowly swirled around a streetlamp as the drizzle drifted downward around it. The way it all moved had the appearance of intention. Like it was alive. 

Garry and Nathan quietly argued about whether we should hunker down in there, go back to the bank, or make a run for our Van while Leslie began speaking again.

"There's something in the night tonight. In the darkness. It's coming for you as it always does. It drifts in on the mist and in the quiet rain. It takes the shape of shadows and eye-shine. It seeps in through the cracks and crevices, takes form, and thumps on your doors. In it's path, a trail of dead lie in futile regret. 

No one knows what it is or why it takes lives. No one knows where it comes from or where it goes when the morning sun dries up it's moist flesh. But we do know that you can't hide from the Murk. You can't shelter yourself from the phantom drops of rain, for they seek out their prey and tonight that prey is you."

Outside the mist was fast approaching and I knew it was too late to make it to the Van. Maybe we could hide in the vault. 

I interrupted my crew's fascinating debate. "That's enough guys! Back to the bank!" I commanded. And we all headed for the door in a hurried quickstep.

As I closed the alley door behind me I felt the first drops of the drizzle landing on my arms. I piped up excitedly. "Go! Go! Go!"

We started to sprint down the alley but before we got to the end and could round the corner, the mist filled the space between the buildings where the alley met the road. "Run through it!" I shouted. "Just keep going!"

As the men in front of me penetrated the veil of white one by one, I swear I could see distorted faces in the haze. Twisted gaped open mouths, screaming and laughing in diabolical glee. I felt the hairs on my body stand up at static electrical attention, like obedient soldiers awaiting review.  

Some ball of pure fear formed in my belly and pushed upwards towards my throat. My instincts set off alarms of unrecognizable emotions informing me in some unspoken primal language that my time had finally come. 

Dread, foreboding, and the overwhelming presence of pure evil permeated by psyche and for the first time I understood what it meant for a intelligent entity to exist with absolutely no compassion at all. In fact, instead the thing seemed to exist as a force of complete malice. This gut wrenching realization was so intense that it caused immediate trembling throughout my body to the point where it had become hard to run.

In front of me as if in slow motion the other three men jogged through the haze alongside the brick-wall of the camera shop towards the road. Nathan was leading. As he cleared the building and stepped down into the street a body sized cloud of mist swept through him, pulling him to the left and knocking him to the ground about fifteen feet to the side. 

I only saw it for a moment but it seemed to have robe shrouded arms with claws  spread like fingers on end of each arm. It was all just mist but it took on the form of a hooded figure. As it passed it turned it's head towards me and I could see it's skeletal face and soft green glowing eyes.

We kept running as if on autopilot from some internal instinct programmed to save ourselves, but I managed to turn my head slightly to try to see if Nathan had survived. He lie there on his side holding his stomach and curled up in fetal position. His face was red and frozen in a contorted scream of terror. The thought crossed my mind to go check on him but as soon as it did I noticed the spectre was still there hovering over his body. 

The rest of us reached the other side of the road and went round the side to get to the rear door. The drizzle had built up a field of moisture on my face, speckled across it like a sweat from a summer day. It was blurring my vision by the time we rounded the back corner of the bank building and headed down the alley to the rear door.

Garry reached the door first, flung it open, and shot inside in one fluid motion. Tyson stopped at the door to briefly look back behind us. The look on his face caused me to do the same. 

At the end of the alley where we had just been mere seconds before, stood three cloaked figures. Again, they were made of the mist but in the shape of cloaked figures. Each one had a hood over skeletal faces with dull green glowing eyes. 

We darted inside and shut an locked the steel door behind us. We found Garry hiding in the stairwell motioning us to come to him. We did so. I asked him why. He replied by pointing to the front lobby window. I peeked around the corner of the stairwell and saw several of the figures at the window staring in as if looking for us. 

I told Tyson we really need to check out the vault. Maybe we could hide in there in case the things managed to get in. Tyson's hands were shaking so bad he could hardly get the film into the camera. I took the camera and held the bit of film over the lens as Tyson lit up a cigarette. He blew smoke across the floor and I took the photo. 

I held my flashlight up to the picture after it popped out of the device to help it develop. As we waited Tyson said we should just go in. Let the alarms trip. The cops who responded would keep the creatures busy. Anyway, jail was better than dead. I shook my head 'no'.

"I'm not going back to jail unless I have to. If the beams are on then we'll wait until the creatures breach the bank before we go in. Besides," I said, "even though I don't like cops, I don't want to bring them into a situation like this. These things have already gotten Nathan. There's nothing the police could to do and we'd just be putting them in danger for no reason."

The Polaroid finished developing and showed the beams were indeed turned on. "How fast can you and Garry get that vault open?" I asked.

Tyson tried to think between moments of panic. "Uh... I don't know. A few minutes if we're lucky."

"And if we're not lucky?" I asked.

Tyson looked me with a fatally serious expression. "Then we're dead."

Just then Garry started moaning. "Oh no.. guys!" he called out.

We climbed back up to the top of the stairwell where we found Garry peeking around the wall looking towards the lobby window. I really didn't want to know what more he might have been seeing that could be worse than what we'd already seen. I forced myself to look anyway. I wish I hadn't.

Floating outside the window, was what appeared to be Nathan's dead body. It was peeking in and moving about as if trying to find us. Behind it and holding it up as if puppeteering the body were a couple of those spectres. 

They made his arms go forwards and cup his hands around his eyes up against the glass as if he were trying to see in. Then he backed off and put his arms down. His mouth began to open and close as the ghosts moved his jaw with their own hands and he "spoke".

"There?" it said. "Let me in. Hurry before they come. Unlock the door."

Garry turned back into the stairwell looking away from it and started puking up a bit. His hands were trembling badly as they held up his crouched and shaking body. 

"Just don't look at it Garry. Go downstairs and just breathe deep and try to calm down." I said. Garry crawled down the stairs and for his sake I'd hoped he'd pass out or something. 

Tyson fixed his gaze on me. "I gotta know if he's still alive. Maybe he's just unconscious," he said.

"What are you going to do?" I asked.

"I'm going out there and get a close look. If those things could break the glass or float through it, they'd have already done it. And they wouldn't be trying to convince us to open the door. I think it's safe."

"Suit yourself," I said, "I'll stay here."

I watched from around the corner of the stairwell as Tyson stepped out where he could be seen and slowly approached the glass. The spirits moved Nathan's body over to where Tyson was, right up close to the window. Tyson leaned in and got a real good look. "Yeah, he's dead all right," Tyson said loudly so that I could hear him.

Those mist-demons must have heard him because they immediately changed their strategy. One came up from behind Nathan's body and seemed to enter it somehow. Inside his gaping open mouth the white teeth of the ghost could be seen emerging from the black. His dead eyes lit up slightly with the dim green shine.
 
Then the body became more animated as if alive rather than being controlled externally. He floated back about fifteen feet from the glass, paused, and then like a bull heading for the red cape of the matador, he flew forward bashing his head right into the glass window. 

The sound was loud as hell and Tyson jumped back. Nathan's head looked bad. It was starting to cave in at the point of impact. They did it again and a crack appeared in the glass.  

"Oh crap!" Tyson exclaimed. "They're going to breach!"

He started running back towards the stairwell. I turned and headed down myself. "Garry! Screw the alarms, get that vault open! Fast!"

By the time I got to the bottom Garry was already at work. The things hit the window again about every fifteen seconds. Tyson reached the vault and already had his tools out. He handed Garry his stethoscope and held the end to the vault door for him. Garry patiently turned the knob of the vault door back and forth trying to focus as sweat ran down his face.

With each bash on the window above, Garry would pause and then pick up where he left off just before the intervening bang. I've never seen anyone this focused, precise, and calm under pressure before in my life. The man was the consummate professional. 

"Almost got it," he said as we heard the first bit of glass hit the floor above. I was staring at the top of the stairwell not sure if they'd have to hit it again or if they were already inside. The longer I stared the more fear welled up in me. With each passing moment I kept expecting to see the light fog come rolling down the stairs or perhaps a complete spectre peeking around the corner at me.

Then another loud bash on the glass window above. It sounded like the whole thing crashed in and shattered on the tile floor of the lobby.

"Got it!" Garry shouted as he turned the handle upward to the unlock position. Tyson then rotated the wheel all the way to the left. I moved around them to the far right as they pulled the door open to the left towards the stairwell. I stepped inside first, moved to the left side and grabbed the door from the inside ready to pull it back closed. 

"Get in!" I shouted. Garry came into my field of vision first and turned to head into the vault when a spectre seemed to fly inside his body. He stopped moving and put his arms down to the side. He started shaking violently. Tyson came around behind him and was trying to get past him when Garry's body exploded, sending body parts in all directions.  

Drops of blood and God knows what else splattered across my face. Tyson was covered in gore and bits of Garry's skin, hair, blood, and bone. He slipped as he tried to lunge forwards toward the vault door. He started trying to crawl in the slippery mess as the ghost flew right into his body. He stretched his hand out to me and I reached out to grab it and pull him in when his head exploded into a thousand pieces. 

I grabbed the inside handle of the door and puled with all my might praying that the thing didn't get inside with me before I could get the door closed.

The door shut and sealed me in to complete darkness. Suddenly everything was quiet. I laid down next to the door to breathe and try to calm down. 

I'd end up doing ten years for the attempted robbery, but wouldn't be charged with anything else. The cops who knew were particularly kind to me at every stage of the proceedings. I was released in 1999 but only recently began to tell the tale. 

I passed out in the vault while listening to the only sound I could hear thorough the door which was the radio.

"It's 2 a.m. on After Midnight. I keep getting more reports from the Southeast Quadrant of the city. Be careful out there. 

There's something horrible in the darkness tonight. Something evil. Something murderous. Something ghastly and ghostly. 

It's in the rain. It's in the mist. It's in the Murky Drizzle that falls across the city and in the shadows that lurk between the trees and alleyways. 

Don't let it in and don't let your loved ones out tonight. Not tonight. Of all nights, not tonight."
