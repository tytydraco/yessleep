When I got to work that morning I kind of felt like I was walking into my own trial. Not because of anything my coworkers did, but I felt exhausted and paranoid, and I wouldn’t have been surprised if Nora had fired me.



While Nora was understandably horrified by what happened to Lana and Scott, she didn’t hold any of us responsible. She interrogated every single one of us much like the police had, and determined that Scott must have wandered off and gotten lost or killed. As for Lana, she assumed Lana must have been abducted by the mystery figure that spent the night tormenting us. She admitted that she was just grateful the rest of us weren’t killed. None of us wanted to talk about it more than that, and Nora let it go. She seemed to be on the same page as my mom, that the best thing we could all do was accept that they were both gone, and try not to let the guilt eat away at us too much.



That day passed in a blur, and by the time I was getting off work that night all I wanted to do was sleep, but Leano, Gabriel, and Marybell wanted to get dinner and talk about what had happened.



I hesitated, “I’ll go, so long as we can all get home before dark.”



Marybell had the same dark circles under her eyes that I was certain I still had as well. She gave me a tight smile, “Yeah. Same, I don’t want…” She trailed off with a sigh and a meaningful look.



I took her hand as we walked out to the parking lot, the same way I had when we walked to our tents just a few nights before. She didn’t say anything, but she did squeeze my hand gratefully.



Our cars trailed out of the parking lot like a line of ducklings, making our way to a nearby diner where we all slumped into the booth in silence. No one spoke until the waitress arrived, and we ordered coffee and fries to munch on.



After she walked away Marybell dropped her elbows onto the table and said, “Okay. Raise your hand if you heard them last night.”



Gabriel poked his fingers into the air and Leano dropped his head onto the table, but I thought I saw his fingers go up as well. Marybell also lifted her hand into the air, and looked at me with shock bordering on betrayal, “You didn’t?”



I shook my head no, “I got scared and called my mom, we stayed on the phone together all night. By them do you mean…”



Marybell looked numb, “Yeah. It didn’t sound exactly like them, at least not to me. But yeah..”



I hesitated, then decided to share the rules my mom had told me, “I might have something that could help.” No one spoke, but even Leano lifted his head to look at me. “I won’t share everything we talked about right now, but my mom is from Appalachia and she told me some things to do to protect myself from… I don’t know, from whatever we’re dealing with.”



I pulled out the list and slid it to the center of the table. The other three read it, then looked up at me.



Finally Gabriel said, “I understand everything but the acorn.”



I shrugged, “Yeah, she told me last night to add a cinnamon stick too, one on every window sill. I still don’t really get why, but she said it’s ‘deep mountain magic’ and not to question it.”



Gabriel shrugged back, “Okay. I can put cinnamon on my windows. Anything that makes it stop.”



I shuffled my feet uncomfortably, “What kind of things were they saying?”



Leano dropped his head again and Gabriel looked away but Marybell gave me a fierce look, “Things to upset us. Whatever is out there really wants us to come outside.”



I grimaced and glanced outside, the sun was still relatively high in the sky, “Does anyone have a theory on what it is?”



Gabriel glared at me, so fiercely I wanted to curl up on myself, “Naming it will just give it more power.”



I nodded, feeling the sleep deprivation make me a bit loopy, “Stinky it is then.”



Gabriel’s face scrunched up, “What?”



I shrugged, nonchalantly, “You said naming it gives it power. So whatever it is, I’m naming it Stinky.”



Gabriel stared at me like I had six or seven screws loose but Leano guffawed. After a moment Marybell joined in, and finally Gabriel’s face cracked and he gave me a smile as well. 



Gabriel said, “Fine, okay. If you have to call it anything, call it Stinky. I guess. And everyone needs to be following Sam’s mom’s rules. I’ll call my abuela and ask if she has any advice, but I think Sam’s mom pretty much covered it.”



We sat there in silence for a while and then I said, “Hey, I have a rental house with a very small guest room and a couch. I can easily sleep two people, three with a little extra work.” I paused, then added, “Plus I have my whole house spook proofed already, in case anyone can’t get theirs done tonight. You guys can stay with me for a while. If you want.”



Marybell smiled, “Office sleep over, yeah? I would love to, but I do need to get stuff done at home. Responsibilities don’t stop just because we’re being hunted by Stinky.” She smirked, then sighed sadly. “But could we plan for that this weekend? I really don’t want to be alone all weekend. I can’t spend all weekend just waiting for them to show up.”



I glanced outside again, gauging where the sun was at now, and turned back to Marybell, “That’s a great idea. Maybe we can figure out some new solutions or something too.”



Gabriel lifted a tired eyebrow, “Solutions?”



I shrugged, feeling embarrassed, “I don’t know, maybe there’s something we can do to combat this thing.”



Gabriel nodded, “Of course there’s something we can do. We can all stay inside when the sun goes down, and never go back out into the mountains or look out a window or whistle ever again.”



Leano stuck his bottom lip out, “No that does not work. I would like to marry someday, and having a seven PM bedtime is going to make that challenging.”  
  


Marybell and I chuckled and even Gabriel cracked a smile. We agreed to get together at my place over the weekend for moral support and brainstorming, then split and went our separate ways for the evening. When I got home there was still a tiny bit of sunlight peeking across the sky, and I practically sprinted through my house to close all the curtains before night fell.



I was relaxing on my plush green couch about an hour later, feet kicked up on my dark wood coffee table, when I heard what sounded like someone tapping at my door. I stood automatically, almost like I was in a trance. I walked to the door, a voice in the back of my head lamented my lack of a peephole to check who it was, but for whatever reason that didn’t stop me.



By the time the door was open, I had just realized what I was doing. But it was too late.



There on my front porch was a deer. It was a little large for a deer, although I guess I have no idea how big deer get in Appalachia. I think the biggest deer I saw in Alaska came up right about to my collar bone (the top of its head anyway), but this one was right at my eye level, almost more like a teenaged moose calf than a deer.



Wild animals don’t scare me, not even a little bit. But what does scare me is when an animal behaves so entirely outside of what’s normal. I instinctively backed up and the deer closed the gap quickly, both front hooves resting right on the threshold of my door. I stared at its nose, strangely terrified to look it in the eyes, afraid of what I would find there. 



I’m not sure how long this stand off lasted because I honestly feel like I fell asleep, like that aware sleep where you can see the room you’re in and you know you’re not awake, but you’re still dreaming and it’s hard to tell what’s real and what’s dream.



Finally my eyes began to drift upward, needing to confirm whatever horror might be waiting for me. My eye line travelled up the deer's muzzle until I reached the two eyes that should have been a murky animal brown or black (some deer even have red eyes and slit pupils like a goat) but weren’t. Its eyes were pure white, not the milky white film of a blind animal, but a pure white like dried and cleaned bones. The deer gave me a strangely intelligent nod as it shifted from four legs to hind legs, now towering several feet over me, but I held eye contact.



The edges of my vision began to blur, growing bone white on all sides, and I felt… I felt like my skin was sliding off, like if this creature put its teeth on me all my skin and flesh would just come right off. Just as my vision had narrowed to a pinhole and I could feel myself losing consciousness, my phone rang.



My mom has her own special ringtone, and I know this will sound silly but before I left I recorded us singing “you are my sunshine” together, and that’s her ringtone. I hate to say it because it sounds so cliche, but she is my best friend.



The sound of “you are my sunshine” in my mom’s voice snapped me back to reality so fast I almost slammed my own fingers in the door as I shut it on the crazy deer, stumbling backwards as I sobbed and heaved. I managed to answer the call before it could go to voicemail, but for the first few moments I couldn’t even bring myself to speak.



I heard, “Samira, it’s mom are you okay? I- Sammy? Are you there?”



I had fallen to the floor shortly before managing to answer my phone and it had slid a few feet away while I was trying to gather myself. I finally managed to grab it and squeak out, “Mom?”



Her voice was soaked in relief and fear, a heartbreaking combination to hear as she said, “Sammy, baby what happened? I had an awful nightmare, your dad and I woke up at the same time. Please tell me you’re okay Sammy, what’s going on?”



I took a few deep breaths and struggled to my feet, “Mom, I’m going to sound crazy but-”



She cut me off, her voice somehow soft and stern at once, “Samira, you know me better than that. Now tell me what happened baby, please.”



Another sob escaped my throat and I had to gulp air to try and calm myself down. Finally I said, “I was sitting on my couch relaxing before bed, and someone… someone tapped on my door. I thought it was a knock, or I felt like I thought it was? But it sounded more like a tap. And I opened the door,” when I said that I heard her hiss with disappointment and had to force myself to finish the story, “and there was this deer, mom. I- I think I’ve seen it before, the day of my hiking trip. And it was standing right there on my porch, and when I took a step back it stepped forward-”



She cut me off, terror piercing her voice, “Did it get inside?”



I had to choke down another sob, “No, it stopped on the threshold but I don’t know why.”



She sighed, “Okay, good. What happened next?”



I took in a deep breath, “Okay, it stopped on the threshold and I just kind of stood there for a while and- and then I looked in its eyes.” I could hear her taking a sharp breath and I rushed to finish the rest of it. “Its eyes were totally white, mom, and not blind white but like, bone white. And the longer I looked in the tings eyes the less I felt like I had control over my body.”



Her voice was small as she said, “You felt like all the flesh might just slip off your bones?”



My voice came out in a cracked whisper, “Yeah.”



We sat in silence for a long time, then both spoke at once:



Me: “How did you know that?”



Her: “What happened next?”



We both paused, then I said, “You called. Like right before I, I don’t know passed out or something, I heard your ringtone and it snapped me back to reality.”



There was a smile in her voice, “You are my sunshine?”



I laughed and gave our standard reply, “Yes I am.”



My laugh seemed to clear all the tension out of the air, and I took my first real deep breath since everything had happened. I glanced at my clock and saw it had been nearly three hours since I had sat down on my couch. I must have been in that trance for a really long time.



After  a moment she said, “So what happened after that?”



My eyes rolled to the side as I tried to recall, “Uh, the deer got on its hind legs and then I slammed the door and answered your call.”



“Did you lock the door?”



I glanced at the door and saw that it was unlocked, “No, but I’ll do that now.”



She didn’t respond, but I ran to the door and locked it, then stared at it, wondering if the deer was still on the other side. The memory of those bone white eyes chilled me and I paused, I was tempted to pull the door back open just to see if it was gone.



Once again it was her voice that brought me back, “Samira. Is the door locked?”



I coughed out, “Yeah, now it is.”



She sighed, “Thank goodness.”



I bit my lip, “Mom? Do you know what that was?”



She was so quiet I thought the line had gone dead. Then she whispered, “I think so.”



I had never heard so much fear in her voice, and for a moment I felt like I could hear what she sounded like as a sixteen year old girl who had just lost her best friend.



I waited, not knowing what else to say and not wanting to pressure her, but finally she said, “I think it’s called a bone witch? That was- that's what I think it’s called.”



The wind whipped the trees outside, sounding more like a scream than a whistle. I shivered and closed my eyes against the terror, but they snapped open as fear permeated my body.  A salty brine that both froze and energized me.



I asked, “Why didn’t it come inside? It was huge, more like a moose than a deer, and when it got on its hind legs it was freaking gigantic. It could have trampled me easily.”



There was hesitation in her voice as she said, “Bone witches follow certain rules. You have the seed of life in your home, and it radiates out that warning.”



I blinked, “The seed of what.”



She chuckled, “That acorn you put on your windowsill is a type of blessing, for your protection. Don’t ask me why, I know what I learned when I lived in Kentucky, but to be honest when I left I didn’t want to study any of it. I wanted to put it behind me and never think about it again.”



I sighed, my head dropping into my hands, “I’m sorry mom. I never should have moved out here.”



I could hear the tears in her voice, “No honey, I should have told you a lot sooner. I shouldn’t have kept this from you, and I’m so sorry. I hope you’ll forgive me someday, but I promise I’ll do what I can to keep you safe.”



I looked around my house, feeling a sudden surge of protective affection for it, “I don’t want to leave. I’m terrified and worried, but I love my little house and I really love my job.”



She sighed sadly, “I figured as much. I’ll do what I can to help you stay safe there.”



I let out a breath I didn’t realize I’d been holding, “Thank you. And I’m not mad at you, I probably wouldn’t have told me anything either.”



We were quiet for several more minutes. When I yawned she asked gently, “Do you want me to stay on the phone with you all night?”



I looked fearfully at my front door, “Am I safe to go to sleep?”



She sounded hesitant, “I think you are. If the bone witch wouldn’t enter your house with the door open I don’t think it would break in. Just make sure the doors and windows are all locked, and maybe put a cinnamon stick under your pillow.”



I made a face, even as I was walking to my kitchen, “Cinnamon under my pillow? Why?”



“It’s an old Appalachian superstition, cinnamon is supposed to bring luck and safety.”



I shrugged as I pulled a cinnamon stick out of the spice cabinet, “I guess I’ll try anything at this point.”



It sounded like she was forcing herself not to sound scared when she said, “Okay baby. I’ll stay on the phone as long as you want, but call me first thing in the morning please. Okay?”



I was already slipping under the covers, my eyelids heavy despite the lingering fear. “Of course. I’ll call you right before work.”



I’m not sure how long she stayed on the phone, I seemed to drift in and out of sleep for a while. I vaguely recall jerking myself out of sleep a few times, answering questions I thought she’d asked or continuing whatever conversation we’d been having. When my alarm went off that morning I felt like I’d gotten only an hour or two of real sleep. 



I yawned as I got out of bed and stumbled to my bathroom, pulling my phone out to call my mom and let her know I was okay. My phone was dead, of course I had it on a call all night, and I had to detour back to my room to plug it in as I got ready.



I made coffee, then slogged back up the stairs to grab my phone. When I turned it on I already had four text messages from my mom: the first one acknowledged that the call had dropped and my phone was probably dead, the second was her asking me to check in as soon as I woke up, and the last two were variations of “Sammy please text me back, I’m very worried.”



I immediately called her back, and the relief in her voice was palpable when she said, “Oh thank goodness, Samira. Your phone was dead and I was starting to panic.”



I swallowed a lump in my throat, feeling guilty now for dragging my mom into this mess, and said, “Yeah, I’m sorry. I was letting it charge while I got ready and I didn’t even think how worried you would be. I guess I thought you were asleep.”



My mom laughed, a high anxious sound that made me feel even worse, “Sweetie I’m not going to sleep with a bone witch on my baby girl's front porch.”



I cringed again, feeling even worse, and said, “I’m sorry. I wish you didn’t have to be involved with this mom.”



She sounded more calm when she said, “Oh Sammy, I was involved long before you were. I feel like if anyone got you into this mess it was me, but assigning blame isn’t going to solve problems and it’s not going to make either of us feel better. Are you on your way to work?”



I sighed, wondering if an energy drink or three would give me a headache as I said, “Yeah. Yeah, I’m heading to work.”



Her voice was sympathetic, “I’m sorry sweetie. Maybe, once we’ve monster-proofed your house, you can get some melatonin. You need to sleep some time.”



I closed my eyes, they felt dry still from lack of sleep, “Yeah I know. I love you mom, I’ll text you okay?”



I heard her take a deep breath in like she was steeling herself as she said, “Okay, Sammy. I love you too. I’ll talk to you later.”



I hung up the phone, finished getting ready for work, and made my way out the door to my car. The sun was up, giving me enough confidence to walk to my car instead of sprinting. Once in my car, I quickly slammed the door, locked it, and took several deep, calming breaths.
