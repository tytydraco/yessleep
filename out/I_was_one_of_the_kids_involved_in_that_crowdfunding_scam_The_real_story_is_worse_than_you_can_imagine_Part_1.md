You may have seen the news stories a few years back: ‘College Students Use Homeless Veteran in Viral Crowdfunding Scheme’. When the details came out, we were the social media monsters of the week. We got harassed. We got death threats. And then, of course, we were forgotten.

But some monsters don’t just disappear. And some sins won’t be forgotten.

I’ll preface by saying I’m not proud of what we did. And I won’t try to make excuses, except to tell you that my own dad was sick. And being sick is expensive, especially when you’re poor.

Unlike the others, I actually needed the money. It wasn’t for me, it was for him.

I know, I know. Hard work is how you make it, right?. Except, I did work hard—shitty food service jobs, rideshare driving, TaskRabbit gigs installing window ACs and building IKEA furniture for people too lazy or incompetent to do it themselves. It was never enough to get my dad out of that hole and back on his feet. In my experience, the harder you work the poorer you are.

I was in college at the time—Dad wouldn’t let me drop out to work full-time. I went to a good school that would, theoretically, guarantee me a good future. There weren’t very many people like me there. People who grew up eating baloney sandwiches; who weren’t surprised when their lights got cut off by the electric company. People whose families were drowning in debt.

It was the end of winter break. My car died two days before Christmas, so I was catching a ride from New Jersey back to our school in New Hampshire. I felt a stab of humiliation as the big, black Mercedes SUV pulled into the parking lot our run-down apartment complex.

I tossed my suitcase in the trunk, probably made some pathetic, self-deprecating joke about how bad my neighborhood was, and hopped in the car with my friends from college.

Emily was my roommate. She was more of a misanthrope than me. Back then we used to argue about it: whether people were essentially good or bad. These days I don’t think I would argue with her. I miss her all the time.

Colin was a nice guy. He wasn’t poor like me, but he came from a working class background. He drank too much. He’d had a crush on me since freshman year.

Unfortunately, the guy behind the wheel was Tristan. He was Colin’s spoiled rich-kid dickhead of a roommate. And beside him in the front seat, glued to her phone as always, was Genevieve. Pretty Genevieve. She was Tristan’s girlfriend—a wannabe influencer.

The plan was to drive all night and get to school the next morning. It was the kind of plan that seems brilliant when you’re 21.

We drove for hours through the darkness. I listened to the others go on and on about the wonderful holidays they had and mostly kept my mouth shut. Genevieve posted at least three videos from the front seat, crucial updates to her legions of followers on the progress of her journey.

Some time around 3 AM, on a deserted stretch of highway in New England, we hit a patch of black ice. The SUV fishtailed and slid off the road into a snowy embankment. Tristan gassed it, but the tires just spun uselessly. We were stuck.

It was the middle of the night. There were no other cars to flag down on this frozen stretch of road. Tristan wouldn’t call the cops or a tow truck because he didn’t want his dad to find out he’d had an accident.

Suddenly, we were startled by a loud tapping on the back windshield.

We turned to see a man in a threadbare scarf and a long, ratty overcoat whipping in the bitter January wind. He was holding a blade—something between a short-handled folding spade and an axe (I would learn later that the military calls it an “entrenching tool”).

We had no idea where he came from, or where he was going. But in a low, unsteady voice, the man offered to help us.

The others were too afraid to get out. But I stood outside and held the iPhone flashlight while he used his entrenching tool to dig out our tires. As he hacked at the ice, he muttered to himself about how he “got sent to hell but he came back”. He kept repeating that he wasn’t supposed to come back but somehow he did.

The man stopped digging. The SUV’s tires caught dirt. And Tristan pulled the back onto the shoulder of the highway.

I told the others we ought to give the guy a ride. It was ten degrees outside and we were miles from anything. But Trevor said absolutely not: “No,”—and I quote—”bum asses on his dad's leather interior.”

I started to argue—pretty much my default mode with Tristan—but suddenly Genevieve sat up in her seat. Up to this moment she’d been disgusted, barely deigning to look at the drifter. But now she was all smiles. She climbed out of the car and took his arm in hers. She sensed an opportunity.

With her iPhone Genevieve filmed while the man as he awkwardly reenacted digging the car out of the snow. What a Good Samaritan! The kindness of strangers was soooo incredible! When he was done, Genevieve paid him a crisp, new hundred dollar bill.

It was a touching end to the video. What heartwarming, sharable content. I felt sick.

As we drove away, I suggested we should least set up a KrowdFundMe or something for the guy. He helped us when he had no reason to. He clearly needed help himself.

Tristan started to argue, but to my surprise, Genevieve agreed with me. People looooove charity. Great narrative, she said. So Tristan used his phone to quickly set up a KrowdFundMe campaign with a goal of $5000. Genevieve posted the link along with her video.

It was only then, five miles down the road, that we realized none of us even asked the man’s name.

The next morning, we got to school. In the cafeteria, I checked the KrowdFundMe. It was at $9000 of its $5000 goal. By that evening, it was $20,000. The next morning it was at $45,000.

The video had gone viral and the campaign had taken on a life of its own. People loved the story of someone with nothing helping those in need. Here was proof that life wasn’t just a brutal struggle where the only way to survive was by stepping on someone else. There was kindness in the world. Compassion. It got as many likes and shares as Genevieve predicted.

I was crossing the quad, watching the KrowdFundme number go up, when I got an email like a punch in the gut. It was the Bursar's Office. Turns out my tuition check bounced. The long and the the short of what they were saying, in very polite language, was that if I didn’t pay up, I wouldn’t be able to enroll this semester. I wouldn’t graduate.

I felt my legs getting wobbly. I sat down on icy bench and tried to think.That’s when I saw it down the block: a new, blaze orange Corvette Z-06. Tristan was driving.

“Excuse me?” I said to Tristan (probably in less polite language). Where the hell did he get the money for a new car? Relax, Tristan told me (definitely in less polite language), it was wasn’t brand new. It was last year’s model and he didn’t buy it he was just leasing it.

Things were getting out of hand. The KrowdFundMe was at $70K now. The five of us needed to have a talk.

We gathered in an empty common room—Tristan, Genevieve, Colin, Emily and I—to hash it out. What was our plan for the donation money that kept pouring in? What should have been a short, civil discussion became a screaming match. The group was divided: Should we give everything to the man in the overcoat, or should we keep some of it for ourselves?

In the end, we put it to a vote. It was 3 to 2. Colin and I voted to give everything to him. Tristan, Genevieve and Emily voted to keep some. After all, they said, without us there would be no money. Surely, we deserved something. Right?

My greatest regret is that I accepted this vote. Perhaps if I hadn’t none of this would have happened.

But I did agree. Though I made Tristan promise he’d use some of the cash to hire a private detective to track down the guy and give him his share.

That night I needed to forget about my tuition check, and my dad’s illness, and the money he owed. I went to a party with Emily, where I had few too many tequila shots. There, for some reason, I hooked up with Colin.

We stopped making out long enough for him grab another drink. And in the darkness and the flashing strobe lights, I saw a haunted face in the crowd. The man was there. At the party. He grabbed me by the shoulders with a grip like iron and demanded his money.

I swallowed my fear and somehow managed to calm him down a bit. I told him we’d get the money but we needed to find Tristan first. He was the one who controlled the KrowdFundMe account.

Colin, Emily, and I walked the drifter across campus. It was freezing outside. He rambled about how he had done "terrible things” he couldn’t ever forget, and how the worst thing was when he realized that "the real hell wasn’t over there... it’s back here at home.”

We learned his name at least. He was called Abel Fryst.

We found Tristan in Genevieve’s dorm room. Both of them wrinkled their noses when they saw Abel Fryst standing at their door. The big man stepped inside and quietly explained that he’d heard about the KrowdFundMe and that he came for his money.

“Sure,” said Tristan, “I’m happy to give you the original $5,000 we set out as our goal.”

“Not enough,” said Abel.

“OK,” said Tristan, “Then how about nothing? Let’s be honest, you’re a homeless drug addict. If I give you all this money, you’ll be dead in a week.”

“I don’t want the money for drugs,” snarled Abel, his pale blue eyes flashing.

Tristan wasn’t having it. He told Abel Fryst to get lost. I said we’d get him a hotel room but Tristan said no.

“You can’t just show up and try to scare people. This ungrateful piece of shit doesn’t get a goddamn thing from us.”

At this, Abel swung his fist and smashed a hole in the drywall, six inches from Tristan’s face.

Before things could escalate any further, a campus cop came running, and Abel Fryst fled.

But as he ran, he called back from the darkness, “I swear I’ll get what's owed to me, no matter what.”

The next morning at breakfast I learned that the police had found a homeless man frozen to death under a bridge just outside of campus. He had no ID so they hadn’t identified him yet, but I knew who it had to be.

I felt awful. I broke down as I told the others that we were responsible for Abel Fryst’s death.

“Maybe”, said Colin, “but if that gets out, everybody’s going to turn on us. It’s awful but… we’ve gotta keep it quiet.”

There was a long pause. The five of us stared at each other. Then Emily spoke up. “Look, I’m just gonna say what we’re all thinking: What happens to the money now?”

Turns out Tristan had already looked into it (because of course he had). By the terms of service of KrowdFundMe, we were free and clear to keep whatever we raised.

I was disgusted. Days passed. I didn’t leave my room. I found myself watching Genevieve’s video of Abel Fryst digging out our tires and over again. It might have been my imagination, but each time I watched, I noticed something new. The tilt of Abel’s head seemed… different. I was struck by the strange way he moved. Stiff, almost brittle. I heard anger in his voice; anger at being condescended to, anger at being used, anger at a world that had left him with nothing on the side of the road. Had he always sounded like that?

For some reason, I checked the KrowdFundMe page. I gasped. Even though Abel was dead,  the campaign was still active. The money was still pouring in. Tristan hadn’t taken it down. The asshole hadn’t taken it down!

I caught up to Tristan on a bench outside the science building. He was mesmerized, refreshing his phone over and over watching the KrowdFundMe money go up, up, up.

I snatched his phone away and ended the campaign with the push of a button. The final tally for our KrowdFundMe campaign: $782,000 of a $5000 goal.

Tristan was furious with me. Called me a bitch. He was sure we could’ve hit hit a million.

Later that day I got a call from my dad. He'd had another fall and he was back in the hospital. He was OK but there would be more bills. Always more bills. No matter what else happened, the hole only got deeper.

I cried for an hour and Colin told me what he thought I should do. That night I went, by myself, to meet Tristan at a dive bar off campus. I swallowed my pride and asked him for a loan. Just enough to cover my tuition shortfall and some of my dad’s bills. I assured him this was just temporary. I’d pay it back pay it back as soon as I could, every last cent. I didn’t want to keep any of that money.

With a smirk on his face, Tristan gave me $10,000 in cash. No questions asked.

I went back to my room, disgusted with myself. As I sat there in the dark I couldn’t help it. I opened the video of Abel Fryst on my laptop. But this time time, when Genevieve handed him the hundred dollar bill, he didn’t take it. Instead he swung his entrenching tool and hacked her hand off at the wrist!

I screamed and flung my laptop across the room. Was I losing my mind? I couldn’t have seen what I just saw. I told myself it was stress, lack of sleep, guilt. I tried to take deep breaths until I could no longer feel my pulse pounding in my temples.

Then I went for the laptop, praying it wasn’t broken. The last thing I needed was to have to buy a new computer right now.

As I picked it up, the screen flickered. Instead Genevieve’s video, the browser showed a KrowdFundMe campaign. A new one. The campaign had no description, no details, no pictures. Just a name: “Payback”. And a goal: $0 of $782,000 raised.
