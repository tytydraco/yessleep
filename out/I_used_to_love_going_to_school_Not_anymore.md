I was a teacher at a small elementary school, and had always prided myself on my punctuality. So when I arrived one morning to find the school's front door unlocked and ajar, I knew something was wrong.

Entering the building cautiously, I noticed that all the classrooms were empty and there was an eerie silence that hung in the air. As I made my way towards my own classroom, I saw something that made my blood run cold. 

In the middle of my classroom floor, there was a large, dark stain. At first, I thought it might be a spilled liquid, but as I got closer, I realized it was something much worse. It was blood. My heart racing, I quickly scanned the room, looking for any sign of danger. That's when I saw it - a piece of paper on my desk with a message scrawled in what looked like blood: "You're next."

My mind raced as I tried to figure out what to do next. Should I call the police? Should I try to find my colleagues? I knew one thing for sure, I couldn't stay in the building any longer. I turned to leave, but as I reached for the doorknob, I heard a faint whisper. "Don't go." I froze, unsure of what to do. The whisper came again, a little louder this time. "Don't go. They're waiting for you outside." My heart pounding in my chest, I slowly turned around, trying to find the source of the voice. But there was no one there.

I was alone in the empty classroom, with only the bloodstain and the ominous message as my companions. Trembling with fear, I knew I had to get out of there as quickly as possible. I grabbed my things and bolted out of the room, not looking back until I was outside in the safety of the bright sunshine. But even then, I couldn't shake the feeling that something sinister was lurking just out of sight."

I rushed to my car and locked the doors, feeling safer but still on edge. I knew I needed to report what had happened to the authorities, but the thought of going back into the school sent shivers down my spine. As I sat there in my car, trying to collect myself, I noticed movement out of the corner of my eye.

I turned my head and saw a figure standing by the school's entrance, partially hidden in the shadows. My heart raced as I realized that it was a person, dressed all in black and wearing a mask. I couldn't make out their face, but I knew it couldn't be a coincidence that they were there at the same time as me.

I fumbled for my phone, trying to dial the police as quietly as possible. But as I looked back up, the figure was gone. I scanned the area, but there was no sign of them. Had they been watching me the entire time?

I stayed in my car, watching and waiting for the police to arrive. When they did, I told them everything that had happened, and they searched the school but found no one. The bloodstain and message were still there, a chilling reminder of what had transpired.

To this day, I have no idea who was responsible for the terrifying ordeal. But one thing is for sure, I will never forget the fear and paranoia that consumed me in those moments. And I will never again take my safety for granted, especially when it comes to the safety of my students."
