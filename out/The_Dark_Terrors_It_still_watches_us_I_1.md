It's still watching us, every night before I go to bed I see it... it's red gloomy eyes haunt my nightmares


After all those years, it still watches us... Why? Why us? Why can't it go and ruin other lives, it already made mine a living hell


We were a happy family.

I woke up one day to my wife's voice

"Wake up sleepyhead!"

My wife came in the room carrying a tray filled with plates

"Well thanks honey but I'm not that hungry right now"

I said as I slowly got out of bed to brush my teeth

"You sure? I made some beef bacon"

My wife replied 

"Well a few slices won't hurt"

I said before starting to brush my teeth.

As I was brushing my teeth I heard it, the scream that turned my life into a living hell


AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!
MOMMY DADDY WHERE ARE YOU

My wife got up and ran towards our son's room as I spat out the toothpaste and followed her... I-... 

I'm sorry, I get really emotional when talking about this. 

I still can't forget the horrific scene I saw when my wife opened that door

My 6 year old son gouged both his eyes out with his bare hands 


JONATHAN!!!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAH!

my wife let out an ear piercing scream before running over to Jon

As I heard the screams of my wife and saw my son's blood soaked face I stood at the door frame in disbelief, I waited patiently from the moment where I'd wake up from this horrible nightmare, that moment never came...

I eventually walked over to my son, and hugged him as tight as I could when he finally spoke

"He did it dad"

Said my son in an emotionless voice

"Who? Who did it Jon?"
 
I replied

"He did it! ITS HIM! HE DID IT DAD HE DID IT"

There was no one else with us in the room, atleast we thought so.


We took Jon to the hospital, he got his eye socket disinfected and cleaned, I never thought I'd say this in my lifetime but... we had to pick out a plastic eyeball for our son, to this day it still pains me to say this.


We eventually got out of the hospital, we went to McDonald's and got his favorite meals, we wanted to make him feel happy, after all he... he lost both his eyes!


We eventually went back home, we tried everything to make him happy, to make him smile... eventually night came, we let him sleep in our room that night, that night was the night where I first saw the thing at exactly midnight I woke up to my son screaming to the top of his lungs

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
MOMMMMM DADDDDDDDD HELP ME!!!

I woke up and saw my son sitting, looking at something, I tried waking up my wife multiple times until I realized her face was covered in blood, I looked back at my son but he was no where to be found.

Suddenly 

"Looking for this?"

A low, dreadful, chilling, rasping voice spoke


"WHO ARE YOU?"

I screamed as loud as I could 

"SHOW YOURSELF COWARD!"

I said 


"Fine..."

I felt my blood running cold as I saw evil, gloomy, red eyes emerge from the darkness

"There, I showed myself, you happy?"

"What are you?"

I said

"Do you really want to know?"

It replied

"WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH MY SON? WAS IT YOU WHO DID THIS TO HIM? LEAVE US ALONE! WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH US?!"

"Oh, the monkey is angry hah hah"

It said with evil in it's voice

I launched myself at the creature only to be pushed back with a great force

"Have you ever played "would you rather"?"

The creature said

"LEAVE US ALONE!!"

I replied 

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUUGHHHHHH

"BAD DOG"

The creature said as it broke my arm

"Would you rather kill your wife, or kill your son?"

It said

"What?"

I replied

"LEAVE US ALONE YOU SICK FREAK"

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

"Rude"

The creature said as it broke my other arm


"So who will it be? Claire, or Jonathan?"

"I SAID LEAVE US ALONE"

"Fine"

I woke up, drenched in sweat, was this it? Was it all a nightmare? A horrible, horrifying nightmare?


I looked at my wife, she was peacefully sleeping, but my son wasn't in his room, he was still with us and he still had that plastic eye

What is this?
Is this all connected? What is going on?
