I didn’t think much of the job when I took it. Just a side-hustle, really. Who doesn’t like some easy extra money? 

I live across the street - two houses over, more or less diagonal from theirs. Same quiet cul-de-sac, same trimmed hedges and shuttered windows. The kind of neighborhood where nothing happens unless someone forgets trash day.

The mother, someone I’d only exchanged a wave with once or twice, had asked if I could house-sit for the weekend. Watch her son while she was out of town. She seemed polite. Harmless. Tired in that expensive kind of way.

So I said yes.

*"He's quiet. That's the worst of it. Won't bother you much."* she said. *"No allergies, no screens, no trouble. You'll.. hardly notice he's there."*

She introduced her son with a soft gesture behind her. He was already sitting on the porch step. Pale skin, white-blond hair and dark brown eyes fixated in a cold stare - at a boy across the street. He was murmuring under his breath: "*one, one, one, one, one ..."*. He didn't look at me. 

His arms were wrapped tightly around a scuffed red-and-white soccer ball. It looked.. too stiff, like the panels were dry and peeling.

The other boy (probably 11) had been biking up the sidewalk, but he slowed. Not like he was being cautious - more like he was startled. 

I looked at the boy I'd be watching. His head was tilted slightly down, gaze locked and face grim, unreadable.

The kid across the street made a wide turn around the house and sped off without looking back. I tried a joke, *"Someone... you know?",* the boy didn't answer. He didn't blink.

He chanted, *".. one, one, one, one, one,"* a pause - *"not yet."*, ball rolling in his hands.

There was something really off about him. But I really didn't care. After all, he was just a kid. Couldn't do much harm to me.

The next morning, the mother left (for a weekend work trip). She packed in a rush - barely a word to the boy, just a quick kiss on the top of his head and an awkward pat on my arm. *“I'll be back tomorrow morning,”* she said. *“Just.. don’t let him wander too far.”*

Wander? He didn’t even move.

I stayed on the couch, flipping through some magazine I found on the mantlepiece while he sat on the carpet a few feet away. Not playing, not reading. Just… staring at a blank patch of a wall with the ball in his lap, rotating it slowly.

There were smudges on it. Like dried mud or reddish paint. He didn’t speak. Didn’t eat unless I handed food directly to him. Didn’t blink much, either.

Soon he went inside his room, proceeding to sit and stare at the wall, just by the window close to his bed.

At around four, I was scrolling through my phone when I heard it.

Thud. Thud. Thud.

The ball rolled out from the hallway and bumped into the leg of the couch. I looked up. The boy stood a few feet away by the corner of a wall. Staring at me.

He walked over slowly and picked up the ball and then didn’t move.

Just stood there, holding it, like he was waiting for something to happen. His eyes were… flat. No anger. No sadness. Just vacancy.

He mumbled something again. I couldn’t hear it. *“What?”* I asked. 

He didn’t repeat it. Just turned and walked back to his room. 

At around six, he approached me again. *"Can I go out now?"* he spoke, his voice flat and dry. I hesitated, *"Where? To play?"* 

He nodded. Head down, ball tucked under one arm like a growth. *"I guess?"* I said. *"Uh... just stay nearby, okay?"*

He didn't respond. Just walked out, letting the door creak closed behind him. 

Honestly, I was relieved he was gone. I didn't like his presence at all. But a word's a word. I took the job, and I was responsible for him as long as his mother wasn't back home. 

Though I let him leave, I figured he'd come back, so I wasn't bothered.

I didn’t see him again for nearly an hour. He came back covered in streaks of mud. Brownish grime smeared across his sleeves, knees darkened, fingers raw. His shoes left small, dirty wet ovals on the floor.

I was unsettled, *"What happened? Everything ok?"* I asked, though I expected no answer. He ignored me completely and headed inside.

The ball in his arms was filthy. Damp leaves stuck to the edges. Smudges of something dark red across the surface mixed with brown.

I stared as he passed me. He didn’t say a word. I followed him into the kitchen.

He stood on tiptoes and ran the tap, rinsing the ball gently under the flowing water. No rush. No effort to hide it.

Just in little circles, back and forth. The water pooling at the bottom of the sink turned pale red, then grew pinkish brown. 

I didn’t speak. I feared that was.. blood. I gagged at the thought.

He rinsed the ball carefully and patted it dry with a dish towel. Held it close again, like a favorite stuffed animal. *“Can I have dinner now?”* he asked, looking straight at me with his lifeless eyes.

He left the few damp, dead leaves in the sink. I didn't want to clean that - and I didn't.

I heated the lasagna his mom left in the fridge and served it to him. He sat there and ate like a normal child would, but he often stopped to look at me briefly, almost mechanically - only to resume eating as he dug his fork in.

I tried my best to ignore him.

By ten, he was in bed. Or at least, under the covers. Arms neatly by his side. Ball beside the bed on the floor. Eyes wide open, staring at the ceiling. *“Hey..”* I whispered. *“You good?”*

No reaction. Just silence in the darkness of the room. I leaned in. His chest rose and fell slowly. He looked asleep, but his eyes didn’t move. Like they were painted on. They looked slightly red.

I told myself it was just a phase. Maybe some sleep disorder he had. I covered him with the blanket again and went back to the couch. 

Just as I was about to close the door to his room, he sat upright in bed, staring at me.

This time, it was more audible - he began to chant: *"two, two, two, two, two ..."*

I waited by the door for a while, trying to process what was going on. Just as robotically as he sat up, he lay down again. Hopefully - asleep.

About twenty minutes later, I felt it. A tingling sensation like static behind your neck. I turned slowly. 

I was on the couch, doom-scrolling on my phone. The hallway was dark - except for the outline of something in the middle of it. 

The boy - standing again, motionless. What was he up to? 

I jerked up slightly. He just stood there, not saying anything. Not holding the ball now. 

Just... watching. Behind him, a slow rumble. The ball slowly rolled close (and I genuinely don't know how), stopping by his foot. *"Go to bed!"* I asserted. He didn't move immediately.

Then, slowly, he turned and disappeared down the hall again. He left the ball where it was. 

I stared at that ball in the darkness for long - fearing it'd move again or do something weird, though I expected nothing extra.

I'm not sure if it was me or something really wrong with it, but that ball seemed to deform and tug side-to-side.

My eyes grew tired and I fell asleep on the couch some time later. My phone had slipped from my hands to the floor. I woke again, struggling against a heavy weight on my face. Like a pillow. But too heavy for a normal one.

It was the ball, flattened over my face. And now I was sure it was NOT filled with air... it couldn't be!

This time, his chants grew louder - *"two! two! two! two.. two, two...."*  Pressure. More and more pressure.

A muffled gasp escaped as I kicked out violently, throwing my arms up. The ball fell to the floor with a thud. I rolled off the couch and scrambled back against the wall, chest heaving. The boy stood two feet away. Silhouetted in the far glow of the kitchen light. Not chanting anymore.

Arms at his sides. He didn't look surprised. Just curious. 

I had enough. He tried to kill me. And whatever he was planning to do.. whatever game he was playing.. no - I wasn't going to play along.

*"Bed!"* I snapped, hoarse. He resisted, but I dragged him by his collar and shut him inside his room, kicking the ball in too. It hurt my foot.. and it should not have.

I didn't care if he complained to his mother. 

I couldn't sleep. I sat there on the couch, trembling in disgust.

The night was long, and even with him almost locked inside - I didn't feel safe. 

I'm not sure if they were hypnagogic hallucinations or something - but I think in my brief moments of waking up fearing he'd be back again - I spotted him at odd places in the darkness of the living room, eyes coldly fixated on me... as if he was studying something with some sinister intent.

Once by the lamp, then behind the TV, then sat by a wall - and even one time peeking behind his door.

Each time I grew alert of this presence of his, he was gone in a blink of my eyes.

By seven in the morning, I went to check in on him. He sat by a wall, the soccer ball rolling in his hands. His eyes were wide open, darkly reddened. A defiant, ugly face he made as he stared at me.

*"two," ... "two, two, two, two, two, ..."* he began.

*"Your mom's going to be here in a while. I won't be back. Don't play stupid games with me anymore. You understand me?!"* I said.

He grinned.

I knew I wasn't very safe from him. I lived in the same neighborhood. I feared he could break in and attempt to harm me anytime.

I left a note on the table and a voicemail for his mother - telling her I was leaving.

When I crossed the street to return home, I told myself I was done with this business for good. No more taking care of any kids for easy or.. say, any money.

By 11 AM, his mother sent me my payment online - $19. *"Thanks again.. and sorry for the trouble he caused you",* she sent a message. Didn't come to meet me or give me cash in-person, conveniently so.

Trouble? How'd she know? She probably figured he'd done something. I was sure that he wouldn't have said a word. What child would admit to something so bizarre?

The day rolled by. I tried fitting in my usual routine. That evening by 6 PM, I couldn’t shake it. I needed answers. From a window in my bedroom upstairs I saw him leave his house in that same monotone fashion he would walk in, the ball by his side.

I followed him from a far distance through the sidewalk to the back of the block, past the last row of houses, to where the trees started.

There was a narrow trail leading into the woods. Just a little footpath beaten down by bike tires and sneaker prints. I walked for five minutes. I caught his little figure standing by a pile of dead leaves. Then I heard it.

A dull thud, not so far away. Then again. And again... and again. I crept closer, trying not to make a sound. Through the trees, I saw him one more time - standing in a shallow clearing. 

The ball was raised high above his head and then came down hard. I couldn’t see what was beneath it at first.

Then I saw skin. Not just dirt. An arm, limp. Fingers splayed. Something half-buried, breathing shallowly - or not at all. He raised the ball again.

It made a sickening, wet crack when it landed on the... body beneath the dead leaves. I think I gasped. A small, broken noise escaped me. He went at it again, and again, and again. The he turned. Saw me. The ball dropped into the leaves with a dull thud.

Then he picked it up again... and threw it at me with unnatural strength.

It hit my shoulder with a weight I didn’t expect. I collapsed backward. My vision blurred. The pain was hot and deep, like someone had clubbed me with a brick.

He started walking toward me. Just moving. Purposefully, quite directly. I scrambled up and sprinted through the trees. Branches cut across my face. Roots tried to grab my ankles. I didn’t stop until I was back on pavement.

I don’t remember the walk home, it was quick. Just silence and the sick, growing certainty that no one would believe me. I locked every door. Drew the curtains. Pressed a bag of expired frozen peas to my purple shoulder until the cold made my fingers go numb.

That night, I sat behind the window curtain in the dark. His porch was visible, just across the road - not very far. He was sitting there again, under a dim orange light. Same spot. Same posture.

Ball in hand. But this time… he wasn’t alone. His mother stood behind him.

She leaned down and whispered something close to his ear, lips almost touching his cheek. Then she kissed the top of his head.

Turned, and went back inside. Like nothing was wrong. 

He didn’t move. Didn’t even blink. Well I couldn't really make out.

Though I think I watched his lips part. They barely moved, just a faint rhythm I could barely catch from across the street. His head mechanically turned to meet my gaze by the window, almost as if he knew I was watching. 

I ... I feel he began mouthing *“three, three, three…"* 

He's been sitting there since.
