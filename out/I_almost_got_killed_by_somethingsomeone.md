First I want to clarify I don't use reddit (sorry in case anything's wrong) and also I'm completely skeptical when it comes to ghosts and all those things, however this is something that I've really got no answer to, even to this day. Also, this is not a fake story.  
  
This is my first time telling this story. So for context, its sometime in winter 2023 in Spain (near Barcelona), in a forest. There have been two encounters, I'll start with the first one.  
  
Me and my friend are riding our bicycles in a trail that we found behind a village. It was dark from what I remember, probably like 20:00 or 20:30. So we start going deeper into the trail and at some point my friend tells me to look behind me and tells me that there's someone behind us. I look and I see a light behind us, looked like a flashlight. Now as most people would do if they were in that creepy place and in that creepy situation, we hid. We pulled our bikes into a small forest clearing and hid behind a bush. I recorded the encounter but it was so dark nothing can be seen so I'm not going to add it to this post. The creepiest part is when the person with the light kept walking and stopped in the exact place where me and my friend "dissapeared" in his eyes, of course we were hiding near him but in his eyes we dissapeared in that place. He stood there motionless for like 2 whole minutes. Then he turned around and walked in the opposite direction. Me and my friend got on our bikes and sped in the opposite way as fast as we could and then we kept sprinting on our bikes until we got home.  
  
Now the second encounter was a bit more scary. We were in the same forest but it was later on, I think June 2023. We were in another forest clearing that had a very tall radio tower. We got there when the sun was starting to go down but we stayed until dark just messing around. While it was dark we heard like a siren. Typical tornado/nuclear/whatever generic siren. Although that was already creepy as hell, we for some reason didn't think much of it at the time. Like 1 minute after the siren had stopped we saw a light a bit deep into the trees. In a matter of seconds the light was out of the trees and approaching us rapidly. My soul left my body out my ass at that point, that's the best explanation I can give of how I felt. We hopped on our bikes and went as fast as humanly possible through the forest clearing into an abandoned road that connected to a trail eventually. I looked back for a fraction of a second while on the road and saw that bright white light behind us still, I felt the adrenaline pumping like crazy, like when you get into a fight. On each side of the abandoned road there were bushes, about 170cm tall (a couple inches less than 6ft I think that is). And as we were speeding down the road we saw how something/someone tried to come out of a bush very fast and very aggresively. We were going so fast I couldn't make out what the thing was, but definetly something that was alive and was trying to get us. We hopped into the trail and sped downhill and then uphill and then downhill again into the suburbs of a city, and then through the city until we got home.  
  
I haven't ever told this story with all detail to anyone, just vaguely mentioned it. Might go to the forest again sometime to see if we encounter anything again. For some reason, maybe because it happened long ago or because I still can't really believe it, I don't really have fear to go back there again, although if I encounter that again I'll probably shit my soul out my ass as I said before.  
  
I'll update this post if I encounter it again, might be in weeks or maybe months. If any of you got any explanation for the story I'm all ears because I still can't find one myself.
