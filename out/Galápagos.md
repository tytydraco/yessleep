In the depths of sleep, I drifted again to Angela’s coffin. Just before the wooden lid closed, I glimpsed the gathered crowd dressed in black.

As I descended, I heard the soft thuds of rain. At first, I found comfort in the white crepe fabric that lined the walls of my new home. Then, the claustrophobia kicked in. I wanted out. Heaven, hell, I didn’t care. Just anywhere but here.

I woke up whimpering and cold, my sheets on the floor from my arms and legs flinging against imaginary walls.

I showered, dressed formally, and passed the empty room where my sister once lived as I descended two floors to the kitchen.

My mother smiled as she poured coffee. I knew what she was thinking: at least something good came out of her daughter’s death. Her son may have been underemployed and destined to spend his twenties in his childhood home, but, in his grief, he’d found God.

At church, I half-listened to the scripture Pastor Jones read. When I joined the others in singing the hymnals, my voice carried an empty timbre. I couldn’t have cared less about the nuances of my faith. I was under no illusions that, in a different environment, I’d be a Muslim or a Buddhist or whatever the predominant culture steered me toward. Just anything that promised that there’s more to existence than the tangible reality around me.

When I’d first spotted the sign – *The Next 2 Miles Adopted By Lincoln County Freethinkers*, that horrible feeling crept down my spine of a question I hated to ponder: how many years do I have left before my only fate is to rot under the weight of six feet of the same worm-filled soil under which Angela decayed?

To me, that’s all that the denial of the supernatural – of anything beyond our immediate physical existence – boiled down to. Miles of pristinely-maintained highway heading nowhere.

I exchanged sly glances with my ex-girlfriend Bethany and her cousin Seth as Pastor Jones chastised those responsible. Surely, Pastor Jones proclaimed, the perpetrators were not from our community. No, *our* community, he insisted, was one of love, acceptance, and compassion.

Bethany, Seth and I had felt little of those emotions as we rammed the sign, stood over where it fell, and sprayed neon green over the sponsor’s name. The way I’d seen it, they were snuffing out Angela’s soul. I had to act.

Yet, the congregation nodded along to the messages of coexistence and tolerance. I shook my head. Did they really believe what they claimed to believe?

That evening, I brought to Bethany and Seth’s attention a column on the second page of the Sunday paper. “Those secularists are coming to our hometown.”

We arrived at the County Natural History Museum a few minutes after midnight. Bethany used the key her sister kept from when she used to run the gift shop. It still worked. We snuck inside a side door that I left propped open as we made our way to the new exhibit.

*Darwin and the Origin of Species,* read the banner over the entrance. Fine print underneath confirmed the name of a familiar sponsor.

We shined our flashlights over what we found inside: a miniature of the HMS Beagle, a selection of artificial trees and cacti, and mock tortoises, finches, iguanas, and armadillos scattered throughout artificial formations of rocks and beaches.

In the center of it all stood a mannequin of the man himself. He wore a hefty overcoat and contemplatively held a hand under his chin.

Seth removed a small metal hammer from his jacket while Bethany sprayed pink across an informational display about natural selection.

Before I join them, a component of the exhibit caught my eye. I approached where a small prop penguin presided over a stone nest of three eggs. Nails through its extended left and right flaps kept it fixed against the wall. A sign informed me that Darwin encountered male penguins fiercely protective of their “rookery”.

*Penguins are not afraid of humans,* it continued. *Darwin once blocked one from entering the ocean to see its response. It charged at him, pushing him aside before continuing on its way.*

I reached into the nest and removed the eggs. The speckled bits of blue made them surprisingly detailed recreations, and their weight suggested they were not hollow.

I threw one at the mannequin. The egg shattered on impact, sending its viscous contents running across Darwin’s thick sideburns.

“What was that?” inquired Seth, taking a break from destroying the mini sloop.

“These eggs… they’re *real*.”

Seth asked where I found them. When I motioned to the penguin, I discovered that it looked different from before. Its head was bent backwards and its beak, which had been closed, was now open. It also appeared substantially larger than I remembered it to be.

At Bethany's request, I tossed her an egg, which she hurdled onto Darwin’s chest. Seth sent the third flying into his forehead. As the contents oozed down his face, a pained cry from Bethany distracted me.

She held her gloved hand over her right shin. “Something bit me!”

I shined my flashlight over the wound. Something had, in fact, cut through her pants and into her flesh, leaving a small trail of blood dripping down her leg.

Seth reassured her that nothing could have bitten her. After all, it’s not like there was a guard dog on duty. She must have scraped her leg against broken glass.

“We don’t want to leave any blood for the police to find,” I said. “Let’s get out of here.”

As I left, I kicked the mannequin, sending it crashing to the floor. I looked behind it and noticed that the penguin was missing.

We approached the door I’d left propped open. “Wait,” I whispered, spotting a large silhouette looming over the path outside. “Someone’s out there.”

Bethany guided us as we tiptoe toward a different exit. We eventually found ourselves in an empty parking lot, and before long, we’d climbed into the van we’d left a few blocks away.

As we drove away, Seth asked who I’d spotted.

“I didn’t get a good look,” I replied. “Someone, maybe a night guard, probably saw how I left the door propped open.” But, as I said that, I recalled the shadow’s daunting shape, like a cloaked figure of death awaiting us outside that door.

The newspaper soon covered our stunt. “Are you seeing this?” I texted Seth and Bethany alongside a picture of the article's third paragraph. *In addition to destroying much of the exhibit, the vandals appear to have made off with a prop Galapagos penguin.* I hadn’t taken a prop penguin, and I would have seen if Seth or Bethany had done so.

The break-in became the talk of the town. The police offered a reward for the “hoodlums” responsible for desecrating the public museum. Only one letter to the editor expressed sympathy. At the next church service, I braced myself for a new round of sanctimonious gestures.

The sermon was worse than I expected. Pastor Jones not only spoke at length about the tragedy of “a few bad apples” tarnishing the names of true believers through their “reckless defacement,” but also announced a fundraiser to repair the damage. I stormed out in disgust, slamming the doors behind me.

In the lobby, I found Bethany. She was pale, and she held her hands over her face. At first, I figured she was as upset as I was over Pastor Jones’ sermon, but she quickly confirmed that that was not the issue.

She motioned to the stairs to the basement. “It’s down there. I can hear it.”

“What’s down there?”

The penguin from the other night,” she said, before scurrying outside.

I followed her. “*What?* Have you lost your mind?”

She maintained that she was telling the truth. That it had been stalking her. That she’d been seeing it and hearing it everywhere.

“It’s a *prop*, Bethany! You really think an artificial recreation of an animal Darwin met two hundred years ago is somehow…what? Alive? And out for, what, revenge?”

She told me that Seth hadn’t believed her, but that she hoped I would. As we spoke, she kept her eyes trained on the church entrance.

“You need help, Bethany. And, even if some magical penguin was somehow stalking us, what would we have to fear? It would be practically harmless.”

She motioned to her right shin. “You don’t understand. It’s huge. And dangerous. It’s hurt me already.”

I remembered the shadow that lurked outside the door at the museum. Whatever had cast it had to have been of significant size. But I found what Bethany was saying impossible to believe.

“It was just some broken glass that cut you,” I insisted. She ignored me.

Her eyes widened as the doors behind me swung open. Her nerves settled when only the departing congregation passes through them, but a wariness still underlined her voice as she informed me that she didn’t plan on coming back to this church. I told her that I won’t be either.

My dreams that night returned me to the funeral. For a change, I wasn’t in the coffin. Instead, I watched as the last bits of dirt filled my sister’s grave.

The ground rumbled. The earth before me fragmented as a dark figure bursts through it. The penguin shook off a layer of dirt and climbed out. Its once-white stomach had browned and decayed. Worms spilled out of it with each step it took.

My mother and other relatives fled as the giant bird waddled forward. I made the sign of the cross and kneeled. “Angela,” I whispered. “Don’t you recognize me?” It eyes me blankly, tilted its head back, and charged angrily. I awoke on my stomach with my pillow soaked by tears.

I tossed my Bible into a recycling bin. Christianity hadn’t provided me with any miracles. Charles Darwin had.

“You sure you’ll be alright without me around?” mom asked at breakfast that morning, referencing her weekend trip to visit a family friend.

Of course I would be. I was nearly thirty, after all. But I don’t tell her that. I just stared, blankly, lost in thought. Eventually, she shrugged and packed her bags.

My phone rang a little after she departed. It was Bethany.

“Yeah?”

She spoke in a desperate, panicked voice. “He’s dead, Adam. Seth’s dead.”
 
“*What?* What the hell happened?”

“It was…he’d been camping, and a hiker found his tent ripped up this morning with a body inside. They just brought me in to confirm it was him, and…and…”

“And *what*, Bethany?”

“It was horrible, Adam. He was *mangled. Ripped apart.* I could barely tell it was him.”

A pressure built inside of me until my whole body trembled. “Were there…any signs of what did it? Tracks from a black bear, or a mountain lion, or something like that?” It was an empty, perfunctory question. I knew what had happened even before Bethany described the oversized, webbed tracks left in the mud outside Adam’s tent.

“I’m going to confess, Adam.”

“Bethany, you need to think about the implications of what you’re saying-”

She interrupted me. “I’ve written down what we did. I want you to sign it, too, and we can bring it with us when we go to the police. Maybe, then, they’ll be lenient with us.”

 This infuriated me to no end. “Bethany, if you do that, that’s just a year behind bars for you. Maybe less. But do you have any idea what that will do to me? I’m not going back. No way.”

Maddeningly, she refused to back down.
 
“Bethany, you sit tight now, you hear me? Sit tight. I’m coming over. We’ll figure this out.” I hung up before she can respond, and I ignored her when she called me back. I needed to get to her before she did anything stupid.

The route to Bethany’s house took me on the highway and by the billboard. Unkempt grass had covered the marks my tires once left beneath it. Its obnoxious aquarium ad was long gone, replaced with a simple, “It’s Your Choice…Heaven or HELL”. *Who calls the number underneath, and in which place does the phone ring?*

My heart dropped at the gashes that extend through the open front door to Bethany’s house. I thought about calling the authorities, but I didn’t want them showing up and finding whatever Bethany’s guilty conscious compelled her to write.

I climbed out of my car and approached cautiously. I slipped through the door and crept down a hallway littered with shattered glass from broken picture frames and books strewn around dented, collapsed furniture.

A shadow extended onto the wall before me. I discerned its sharp beak and the two dots of light that mark where nails once punctured its flippers.

The figure leaned down, jabbed violently, and pulled up. A limb dangled from its mouth. I heard it crunch, then swallow as it absorbed the outline of Bethany’s lower leg.

As I backed up, I slipped on a book. I stumbled awkwardly, loudly. The figure growled like an old motor engine sputtering to life, and the outline of its head turned toward me.

I fled outside, hopped into my car, and floored the accelerator without looking back. Before I knew it, I was pulling into my driveway. I locked the front door behind me and fled to my room.

*What the fuck do I do?* I asked myself. Obviously, the police were out of the question. Should I get a gun, leave the state, or what? Was it following me and, if so, would it ever stop?

I tried to understand what’s happening, but my thoughts were jumbled and panicked. On my laptop, I began writing out recent events as clearly as possible, just as I experienced them. Maybe if I share what I’ve been through, someone else can make sense of it.

I’m nearly finished when a violent throb from below confirms that it knows where I am. Wood splinters as my pursuer bursts through the front door. I hear it ascend to the second level, and then to the third.

I think about jumping out the window, but I’m too high up. I barricade the door as best I can, but its crashes into its frame with the force of a battering ram. Its bloody beak pushes through, then pulls back before smashing into the door again.

My situation is hopeless, and I have no more than a few minutes left. Strangely, though, a sense of relief washes through me.

My blood runs with a vigor that I haven’t experienced since before the night I told Angela that I hadn’t had too much to drink, that I was safe to drive, that we’d be home in no time. Since before I’d left her lifeless form amidst the car’s smoky ruins underneath the mocking gaze of the stupid, flightless bird that stretched across the billboard’s canvas.

As my final moments approach, I lean my head back and laugh. Because, for this creature, this instrument of my torture, to exist, something had to have created it. And wherever that creator is, Angela is, too.

By the time anyone reads this, it will be too late for me, in one sense at least. But, deep down, I know now with an absolute certainty that a long-awaited reunion soon awaits me.

See you soon, [Angela](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeaceSim/).
