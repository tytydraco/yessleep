im now 19 and I think its time for me to get this off my chest. It started when I was around 5 just after my grandma came to visit.  sleeping in my single mothers bed while she slept next to me. I woke up to a terrible headache and someone, no something staring at me. it was 4 am the clock read. i couldnt move as more and more of these things started to appear in front of me. I rubbed my eyes but they were reaching out to me slowly, making sounds as if it were another language, but I was able to make out a few words; "Downstairs", "House", "Room". these were the only words that I was able to make out that morning. they disappeared and I suddenly woke up, the clock now reading 8:42 am. Little did I know this wouldnt be the last time I saw these things.   


as the months went on I completely forgot about that dream, I was 5 anyways my brain didnt know how to remember such things yet. I was quickly reminded of that night though, as my mom would walk into my room while I read "amulet book 5", she told me "we're going to grandmas tomorrow for the week, dont forget", I was 5 so my luggage was already packed for the trip. The next morning as I woke up I saw it again, staring at me but i could move this time. It was resting on a tree outside my window, its eyes black as midnight and its mouth slowly opening revealing sharp needle like teeth lined up perfectly all the way around its mouth. For some reason i didnt want to run, i went closer to my window and stared back but when my mom called my name it suddenly disappeared. The 2 hour drive to grandmas was peaceful, she lived in a huge house next to remote lake on the top of a small mountain. It was scenic. As we pulled into her driveway I could feel as if something was watching me from a distance, I always did get a weird feeling every time I visited. My mom rings the doorbell, grandma as if she was standing at the door waiting, quickly swung open the door startling me and my mother. She didnt look like herself, her eyes were darker and her hair was beginning to thin even more than it already was. Her voice was raspier too, my mom didnt seem to notice the changes in her appearance or voice, so i went along with it. I guess I thought i was just imagining things.   


Grandmas house had four stories, the first was where the storage and jacuzzi were along with the dock for the boat. The second story is where the master bedroom was, this is where grandmda slept, it also included 3 closests, a guest bedroom, and the laundry room. The staircase to the third floor from the second was steep, and creepy. There were photos of my great uncles and grandparents hung up along the wall, their eyes would follow you as you walk up or down. The third floor had the living room, dining room and 2 guest bedrooms along with the garage. The third floor overlooked the lake and had a view of the mountains behind. The fourth floor, I cant say with certainty what was on the fourth floor, but I know i wasnt allowed up there.   


Me and my mom would sleep on the 3rd floor in the biggest guest bedroom. This was the night where i decided to never go back. it was 11pm when we decided to sleep, as i walked to the bedroom my mom would stay back and talk to grandma, what i heard still haunts me to this day. "Its coming back" my grandma said to my mom "its worse then i was before" my mom was silent, thats when she suddenly yells "I CAME HERE WITH MY SON AND THIS IS WHAT YOU TELL ME". The conversation ends as my mom walks into the bedroom. She tells me to go to sleep and that we are leaving first thing in the morning. Thats when it started. I was suddenly hit with what felt like a truck but as a headache, my head was throbbing and all i could hear was faint screaming. everything was grainy as i laid on the bed. I could hear my mom snoring loudly next to me. The headache soon stopped but i could still hear muffled screams coming from the 4th floor aswell as the 2nd. I decided to walk out of the room down to the 2nd floor. walking down those stairs I could see it again, the thing was sitting on the foot of grandmas bed. it smiled at me and let its long skinny arm reach out to me. I tried to run back upstairs but i could only walk forward towards it. I looked at my grandma, but what i saw was no longer her.
