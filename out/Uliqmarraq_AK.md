Hello all. My computer has just flickered on. The lights outside must be fucking with the power again. I’m typing this as fast as I can, so apologies for any misspellings. My hands are shaking. The fire went out hours ago and I’m too afraid to relight it—relight my humble beacon against the lights.

Those goddamn lights.

The village of Uliqmarraq is a peaceful place. Fewer than 50 of us. We live out in the bushes, central Alaska, north of any reasonable human, along the Sushana River. It’s quiet here. We hunt, fish, work the forest for timber, and keep to ourselves. Folks from Outside pass through sometimes, pause, marvel at the little log houses, and gawk as we go about our daily lives. I was born here. I was raised here. And from the looks of things, I’ll die here.

I’m a young man, 20 winters. Raised by my grandparents after my father passed in a blizzard while hunting. I still remember his frozen body as it was dragged on the sled behind the snowmachine. His face—blue-black, like the crimson dark of night. I remember his eyes. I remember the village gathering, a lone drumbeat echoing like the heartbeat of our community. I saw a raven fly. We laid him to rest—a whole day of mourning, and everyone came. 

I was working the night shift at the station when the wind changed.

The gas station sits at the edge of Uliqmarraq, just a squat wooden box with a flickering “OPEN” sign and a single pump that groans like an old man when you squeeze the handle. Most nights are quiet. Maybe someone comes in for jerky, or a six-pack, or to warm their hands and talk about snow depth or moose sightings. But that night, something felt off. The air got heavy. Real heavy. Like the sky was pressing down.

It started with flurries. Just a few flakes caught in the yellow glow of the parking lot lamp. Then the wind picked up—first a whisper, then a scream. The flakes thickened, turned sideways, came down in sheets. Snow slammed against the glass like a fist. I could barely see past the pump.

The old radio on the counter crackled to life. It’s always on, just tuned low, mostly dead air. But this time, it hissed loud, like someone breathing through their teeth. Then a voice—Eli, from the road crew—cut through.

“All routes are closed. Repeat: Sushana road’s drifted over. All plows pulled back. Nobody's coming in or out tonight.”

My stomach dropped.

I stepped to the window. The town was already vanishing—streetlights swallowed by white, houses blurred into snow ghosts. Just shadows now. Movement? Maybe. The wind played tricks out here.

I turned off the station lights, all but the one behind the counter. Didn’t want to draw attention. I locked the doors. Not that they’d help, if something really wanted in. I thought about running for it—grandpa’s cabin was only a half-mile up the hill—but no way I’d make it blind through this mess.

And then came the lights.

Not headlights. Not auroras, either. Wrong color. Wrong movement. These were slow, pulsing things. Orbs, like moons, drifting between trees at the edge of the lot. Pale yellow, flickering like candle flames through fog.

They weren’t *ours.*

I dropped to the floor behind the counter, heart hammering. The radio crackled again, but no voice this time—just static, then a whisper. Not English. Not Yupik. Just… wrong.

I don’t think I blinked for ten minutes. Just sat there in the dim light, clutching the old hunting knife from under the register. Outside, the snow kept falling. 

The lights kept circling.

The blizzard didn’t stop.  
By morning, the world was buried. Not just snow-deep, *drowned*. Trees gone. Roads gone. The pump was a smooth white mound. I finally made the walk back up the hill, blinded and stumbling like a drunk. Felt like hours. When I got to the cabin, my face was raw and my eyes burned, but the door was still latched, and the fire hadn’t taken hold in the stove. It was cold. Colder than it should’ve been.

Grandpa didn’t say much when I came in. Just nodded once, handed me a blanket, and said, *“The lights’re out again.”*

I asked him what he meant. He looked at me like he’d already told me.

Later, I walked the village. It was too quiet. Nobody was shoveling. No smoke from the chimneys. No dogs barking. Just white stillness and the crunch of my boots.

I passed old Marja's house. Her door was wide open. She sat in a chair just inside, rocking slowly back and forth, wrapped in a parka. No fire going, not even a candle. She stared out at the snow like it was telling her something. Her eyes flicked to mine, and I swear to God—they didn’t look human anymore. Too wide. Too clear. Like she could see *through* me.

I didn’t go in.

At the store, the bell above the door didn’t chime. It always chimes. Even the wind makes it chime. But this time, nothing. Inside, Amos was behind the counter, but he wasn’t moving. Just standing, staring at the shelves, muttering something under his breath. I called his name, twice. He didn’t blink. Just said, *“They came before. They always come before the melting.”*

I backed out and closed the door quietly.

Even the ravens were gone. That’s what really started to gnaw at me. Uliqmarraq always had ravens—thieving, clever bastards. But the sky was silent. No wings. No shadows overhead. Just snow, snow, snow.

That night, I couldn’t sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw the lights again. Felt them blinking just outside the windows, pulsing like they had thoughts. I heard my father’s voice whispering in the walls. Telling me to dig. *Dig where?* I don’t know. But I found myself scratching at the floorboards until my nails bent back.

When I looked down at my hands, they weren’t my hands anymore. The skin looked waxy, bloodless. My reflection in the window lagged behind when I turned.

I told myself it was just fear. Just exhaustion. Just the storm.

But I keep hearing this sound—a low hum, deep and slow, like something under the earth breathing through a hollow bone. Grandpa hears it too. I know he does. But he won’t talk about it anymore.

The humming never stopped. Not even when I covered my ears with thick mittens, or buried my head beneath the blankets like a child. It was deeper than sound—it was *inside* me. My teeth ached with it. My bones buzzed. Every thought I had came through that low vibration, like something was tuning me.

Three nights ago—maybe four, I don’t know anymore—the stove went out for the last time. I couldn’t get it to catch. Matches broke in my hands. The wood felt damp, almost soft, like it had been soaking in the dark. Grandpa sat in the rocker, coat on, staring into the empty hearth. He whispered something I couldn’t understand. Not English. Not Yupik. Just breath and syllables like snow falling backwards.

Then he stopped speaking altogether.

I found him the next morning in bed, eyes wide, frost crusted on his beard, mouth open in a silent scream. I didn’t cry. I didn’t scream. I just sat there beside him until the afternoon light turned blue and the cabin filled with that gray, colorless dark that means *the night is hungry*.

That’s when I saw him.

Out the front window—just past the treeline, standing ankle-deep in snow, half-shrouded by the storm—was my father.

His silhouette was tall and broad, the way I remembered before he froze. The parka he wore was the same one we buried him in, stitched with red thread on the shoulders. He wasn’t moving, just standing there, waiting, the way he did when I was little and too slow getting my boots on.

My breath caught in my throat.

He raised one hand. A small wave.

I don’t remember unlatching the door. I don’t remember stepping outside. Just the cold hitting me like a slab of iron, and the snow swirling like it recognized me now, like it had been *waiting*.

He stood farther than I thought. I had to keep walking.

My boots sank. My legs numbed. My coat felt thin, too thin. But I didn’t stop. He kept standing there, just beyond reach. Always just a little farther.

“Dad?” I whispered.

His face looked wrong. I couldn’t see the details, but I could feel them—twisted, sunken, stretched in a permanent smile. The lights began to pulse again, drifting around him like moths made of bone-white flame.

And then, at last, I reached him.

There was no man. No body. Just snow. An impression in it—like something had lain there for a while, then risen. The humming stopped.

I looked up. The sky wasn’t black anymore. It was *white*—a dome of spinning snow, smooth as glass, and the lights were above me now, watching, blinking, blinking.

I lay down.

The cold wasn’t cold anymore.

It felt like home.
