I quit my job as an electrician yesterday. Being an apprentice was miserable: the pay sucked and I had no free time between the job site and night classes. I had plenty of legitimate reasons to give it up, but no one believed me when I told them the truth about why I left. My coworkers laughed at me, and my boss was just upset that I didn’t put in a two weeks notice. When I told my girlfriend about what had happened and begged her to move out of the state with me, she called me a liar and a coward. I went to the police and told them everything I know, but they wouldn’t hear it either. None of them realize that they’re in danger. I know that he’s going to come for me, but no one is safe: not even you. Don’t say that I didn’t warn you.

I never wanted to be an electrician, but my girlfriend insisted that I couldn’t stay at my dead end restaurant job forever. I had no college degree and no marketable skills beyond serving tables, so I went with her suggestion: the trades. Being an electrician didn’t seem so bad, it seemed less messy than other blue collar work. I interviewed with the union, got accepted, and started my apprenticeship.

I was assigned to a master electrician named Gary. He’s a scrawny old bald guy, probably around seventy years old, but more energetic than anyone else I know. I would end every day feeling absolutely beat from trying to catch up with him on the job site. I had no idea how a guy his age could move so quickly at the time, but after everything that’s happened I have some disturbing ideas about why that might be.

Gary loved to tell me stories. I didn’t really care to hear them, but I was willing to listen to appease the old geezer. He had worked in every state in the country at one point or another, and he had a story about each one of them. The strangest of them all was the one that he told about the state we lived in, Louisiana. I can still remember the first time he told it to me, it made my blood run cold.

“There used to be a job that I would do here, every year, right at the beginning of November. Wherever I was in the country, I’d drive back here to make sure it got done. You ever hear about the blue flash near Lake Catherine, down south?”

I told him that I’d never heard of the blue flash, but I knew where Lake Catherine was.

“That was about fifteen years ago now. People don’t like to talk about it much. There was this family that moved into an old house down by the lake. The Browns. They were good folk, didn’t cause any trouble. But they had a problem with their cellar. They thought it was electrical, but it wasn’t.”

He paused. He must have sensed that I was only half paying attention. I asked him what the problem was, to show him that I had mostly been listening.

“It was something I can’t explain. The blue flash. It would happen every year at the beginning of November. Had been happening for forty years by the time the Browns moved in. I first saw it when I was an apprentice, like you. The man I was working under was called to investigate it, and I was there with him. The family that lived there way before the Browns called him in to take a look at some wires in the cellar. It was the beginning of November, and the blue flash came. Thank God I was in the other room. You ever weld?”

I told him that I’d never welded.

“Ah, well, it was bright like an arc flash. Damn near blinded me. And the noise! Sounded like an atom bomb going off in my ears. Damn near made me hard of hearing, ha! It was bright, and loud, for just a second or two, and then it was gone. No more blue flash. But then I looked in the room. No more electrician neither.”

I asked him what happened to the guy.

“Dead. Burnt up in an instant. The smell was something else. Putrid and smoky. The family called the police. Imagine me trying to explain what happened to ‘em, ha! After the poor soul was removed, I came back and asked the family if I could take another look at the wires. Wanted to see what killed him. But I couldn’t find anything, there was not a thing wrong with the electric down there. Nothing!”

I asked him what this had to do with the Browns.

“Oh, the Browns, right. So for the forty years after the first time I saw the blue flash, I would come back at the same time every year and check the wires. The same day the blue flash would come. I kept my distance, of course, like the first time. Then I’d check the wires, to see what the problem was. Never was a problem. Never found anything wrong with those wires in forty years, least nothing that could cause that. It wasn’t an electrical problem. It was spiritual.”

I was a little confused. I asked how he knew that the blue flash would return after the first time.

“I guess it was just my intuition. Three different families moved in and out of that house, meanwhile. I was checking up on things for free at first, but when locals started to talk about the blue flash I turned it into a sales pitch. I would watch the flash come, keep anyone from getting too close, check the wires for good measure, accept my payment, and leave until the next year.”

I asked what this had to do with the Browns again.

“Oh, the Browns, the Browns, that’s right. So the Browns had this daughter, Jessica. And she’s always playing around in the cellar. For the first time in forty years, I’m running late to check on the blue flash. I hadn’t met the Browns yet but had heard that a new family had moved in who would need to be sold on my services. Surprise surprise, I get a call asking for an electrician from the Browns on my way to their place. So I show up and explain myself. Poor Jessica was blinded in one eye from the blue flash the night before. I look at the wires again. Always the same thing: nothing. The Browns press me for information, and I tell them that it ain’t electrical. It’s spiritual. I tell them about the poor man who died there forty years before. They laugh at me, they think it’s all a joke. Wasn’t no joke. And they found out. Oh, they found out.”

I was getting pretty invested now. I asked what happened to them.

“I heard about most of this secondhand. I wasn’t there. But people talked. They don’t anymore I suppose, but they did when it happened. Jessica saw a ghost in the cellar. Ghost of the man who was killed by the flash, I reckon. Jessica keeps ending up in the cellar, sleepwalking. Doesn’t remember going down, but she keeps waking up there. Parents get freaked out. They try to block it off, but she keeps getting in. Eventually, her father buys brick and just walls off the cellar completely. No way in or out. I don’t hear about all this until I show up for my annual checkup. When I arrive, the house is nothing but rubble. The flash came early. Mid-October. Right after it got walled off. Didn’t like being held in I suppose. Whole family dead. Presumably.”

He paused again for dramatic effect. I practically begged him for more information.

“You want to know the worst part? Are you sure?”

I did, badly, and I told him so.

“There was hardly nothing left of the house but the cellar. They found Jessica’s mother, father, and brother in the walls down there. Twisted up like wires in the drywall.”

I laughed. He frowned. It told him that it was a good joke, he got me good. He wasn’t amused.

“It wasn’t no joke, son. Imagine the human body rolled up like a wire, as thin as you could possibly get. Then imagine it even thinner and tighter. They was hung in the walls like that. Some say that when the police found them there, they were still breathing. That’s not possible, of course. Being twisted up and squished like that would kill you. You couldn’t survive it. But still, that’s what some folks say.”

I was skeptical, of course. I still thought that it might be a joke, but if it was, his poker face was impeccable. I asked him how that could even happen to someone’s body.

“No idea. Must have been the flash. Or the ghost! Like I said, it’s a spiritual problem that was going on there. There’s no earthly explanation for it.”

I realized that he hadn’t told me what happened to Jessica, so I asked him why she wasn’t in the walls with the rest of her family.

“No one ever saw her again. Disappeared. Into the ether. The blue flash doesn’t come in that cellar no more neither. Folks said it seems like whatever was in that cellar go out that night. Hard to argue with ‘em.”

That was the end of the story. It stuck with me for a while, I just couldn’t get it out of my head. I asked some people who lived around Lake Catherine if they remembered anything about the Browns. They told me that there had been a family named the Browns who had lived there and that they had been killed in an explosion, but they didn’t know anything about a blue flash. When I asked about the family being twisted into wires, they laughed the same way I had. I guess someone had heard about the tragedy when it first happened and based one of those cheesy chain emails from back in the day around it. All the stuff about the blue flash and the family being twisted into wires was just made up, they told me. When I mentioned that Gary had told me about the story, they faintly remembered that there was an electrician that would come around every once in a while. Their impression was that he heard about the chain email and turned the story into his own since he had worked in the area.

I felt a little better after all that. Gary was just a habitual liar, and not even an original storyteller. He told me the story a couple more times after that, and I just nodded along and acted like I was still interested. Really, all I could focus on were the contradictions and inconsistencies. The story didn’t even really make sense, and I began to feel embarrassed at having ever been frightened by it.

He tried to tell the story to me a fourth time, and by then I had had enough. I didn’t like that he had tricked me at the beginning, and I didn’t like for him to believe that he was still tricking me. I stopped him short while he was getting into it and told him what I knew: the whole thing was a farce, and the locals told me so.

“You believe ‘em huh? You’re not going to believe the man who was actually there, who actually saw these things? You want proof?”

I told him that there couldn’t be any proof, because it had never happened. He smiled.

“Let me show you something, kid.”

He reached into his pocket and pulled out his wallet. With great care he slid an old and yellowed Polaroid out of the fold. He held it up to me, but I could only see the back of the photograph.

“Are you sure you want to see it, son? The proof you want?”

I told him that’s what I wanted. He flipped the Polaroid around, and I saw the image. Immediately I regretted my decision.

The photo looked like it had been taken in a dark basement. I could make out a large piece of machinery on the floor and what appeared to be a family photo on the wall. That same wall had a large hole in it, and there was something you could just barely see inside the wall. I didn’t want to admit what I was seeing, but it looked like what Gary had described in the story: a person, twisted up into the shape of a wire.

I shoved Gary’s hand away from me to get that picture out of my sight. He laughed.

“What? You don’t like it, son? I thought that’s what you wanted!”

I asked him who took the photo and how he had it.

“I took it, of course. No one believes the story, so I have this. Can’t deny this.”

I told him that it could be fake, the lighting was so dark that I couldn’t really tell what I was looking at.

“Then why are you so scared?”

I walked away, angry. He was probably just tricking me again, I thought. Why was I so scared? I kicked myself for falling for it.

Months went by and he didn’t bring up the blue flash or the Browns again. I started to forget about it. Two days ago, he invited me to get a drink with him. I didn’t have any night classes to go to, so I obliged. I wasn’t exactly dying to hang out with the old man more than I already did, but I didn’t really want to go home either.

We got to the bar and he started putting them away like it was some kind of race. I was on my second beer and he had already moved on from beer to whiskey. He was babbling on and on about all of his different stories and they started to blend together into one big stream-of-consciousness lie. After about an hour and a half, he was absolutely hammered. I had to walk him to the bathroom and keep him steady while he threw up into the toilet, but it didn’t help matters.

He wiped the vomit from his lips and asked me to walk him home. I had never been there before, but according to him it was just a half mile down the road. We got there eventually, but we had to make multiple pit stops so he could throw up. I wondered how often he did this sort of thing.

When we got to the house, he spent what felt like an hour going through his pockets until he finally found his keys. We went inside and I helped him lie down on the couch in his living room. He asked for a blanket and a bowl to throw up in. When he had those things, he asked me to sit down next to him for a little while.

“I want — I want to talk about the blue flash,” he slurred out.

I told him that I didn’t want to talk about that anymore.

“No, I — I apologize. I didn’t tell you the, the, the truth. I told you the made up version. The made up version that I, that I tell people.”

I told him that it was okay, I wasn’t really interested in hearing any more about it. He ignored me.

“No, kid, I — the blue flash, it really happened. I saw it, and it spoke to me. Something was in it. Spirit. Spiritual. I saw it in that, in that, uh, in that cellar. And it said things to me. Didn’t like it. I didn’t like it at first but I — I wanted to hear more. It told me it would come back every, come back every year. Same time. Same time, same place. Every year. So I did, and it would tell me more. Told me how I could make my own. My own blue flash. Told me about how I could, I could make my own and what it could do for me. Could lure people. Mess with their brains. Make them think things. And then I could — I could—”

He trailed off and his eyes closed. He was still mumbling under his breath, but I could only hear a few words here or there. “Live forever,” “squeeze”, “machine”, and “poor girl,” were what I could make out. I sat next to him for another minute, then decided that it was about time for me to leave. I stood up and took a few steps toward the door, which caused him to regain a bit of consciousness.

“Where you going? You’re not going to the basement are you?” he stammered, with concern in his voice.

I told him that I was just going to leave.

“Don’t go in the basement, son. I don’t like, I don’t, I don’t like people snooping around. Snooping around my house. Not your business.”

He got quiet again and I wondered why he was so concerned about me going to the basement. I just stood there and stared at him for a while to make sure that he was asleep. There was no more mumbling, just snoring, so I figured that the coast was clear. I walked around with the lightest steps I could muster, looking for the basement door, and found it. I checked again to make sure that he was still snoring, then descended the steps.

I fished around for a light switch when I got to the bottom. I found one, but flipping it did nothing. How ironic, the master electrician couldn’t be bothered to fix the wiring in his own basement. My phone’s flashlight would have to do. It cut through the pitch darkness and revealed a familiar scene. There was a large machine in the middle of the room, and a family photo on the wall closest to me. This was where he had staged that photo.

The machine was strange, I had never seen anything like it. I searched it for any sort of brand logo but found nothing, it appeared to be custom built. It appeared to be operated by a hand crank, which would cause multiple large metal rolling pins to turn. What its purpose was I couldn’t tell at the time, although now I feel it should have been obvious. I examined the pins a little closer, and saw that they were stained with dark splotches all over. Could it have been blood?

I continued to look over the machine, being as silent as I could, and I realized that I could hear a faint repetitive noise coming from behind me. It sounded almost like breathing. Had Gary followed me down here, being as quiet as I was? I turned slowly to face the wall, expecting to see him staring at me, but there was no one there. I could still hear the breathing, coming from directly in front of me. It couldn’t be, but it sounded like it was coming from the wall. I got closer, and the sound got louder. It was gaspy, desperate breathing, like someone who just can’t seem to ever get enough oxygen. I pressed my ear against the wall, and I could hear it as clear as day. Could an animal have gotten stuck in there? I listened intently, and after a few moments I heard something that I will hear in my nightmares for the rest of my life. First a groan, a warped but human sounding groan, and then a single whispered word that sounded like it had been forced through their throat with every fiber of their being:

“Help.”

I turned to run up the stairs and out of that place as fast as I could. I got to the first step, looked up, and saw Gary in the doorway. He was slumped over, holding himself up by leaning on the door frame, but I could see fury in his eyes despite his drunkenness.

“I told you… I told you not to go down there, kid. Why? Why did you, why would you go down there? You’re gonna make me, you’re gonna make me…”

I cut him off to tell him how sorry I was. I pleaded with him, saying that it was just an honest mistake. I told him that I wouldn’t tell anyone about what I saw, and that I didn’t really see anything anyway. The rage in his face only increased.

“No, no, no, no, no. You wanted to see. Even after, after I told you not to. Well you saw. Did you hear her? Did you hear them? Them, there’s more than one. Many of ‘em, many, from all over. One, at least, at least one, from every state. Ha! They stay breathing for a while after, after the squeezing, and the twisting. For a long while, even after I get the life essence out of em. Blue flash told me, told me how to do it. Extract it and store it. You want to see that too? The, the blue flash? I can show you…”

I realized that begging wasn’t going to work, so all that was left was to try to run up the steps and push past him. As I climbed, he pushed his hands out in front of him and started chanting something loudly. I couldn’t make out any of that he said, my heart was pounding in my ears and I don’t think anything he said was English. Right as I reached the top of the stairs, there was a momentary burst of blinding light that came from behind me. I’m certain that if I had been looking toward it, I would have lost my vision. My back felt like it was on fire. I tackled Gary and we both went tumbling to the ground. He tried to get on top of me and hold me to the floor, but I could just barely wriggle my way out of his unnaturally strong grip. I ran out the door and back to the bar, screaming, his chanting still ringing in my ears.

I got in my car and drove home. I stayed up all night, watching out the window, as my girlfriend yelled at me for being out so late. You know what happened the next morning: I quit my job and I told my girlfriend, my coworkers, and my boss what happened. Nobody took me seriously. I can’t blame them. It’s a ridiculous story, and technically I didn’t really see anything. What I heard in the wall could have been my mind playing tricks on me. Maybe the machine was stained with oil and not blood. The bright light in the basement could have been anything. It could all have been an extremely elaborate prank that Gary was pulling on me. I can’t prove anything, but I know what it was.

I’m packing up and leaving Louisiana for Pennsylvania. I’ve got family there. I’m not safe anywhere, but at least I’ll have put some distance between me and him. He’s going to come for me eventually, I can feel it. I don’t expect you to believe this story either, but I’m begging you, just be careful if you need to hire an electrician. He’s going to be around for a while, and he could be anywhere. Don’t end up in Gary’s walls.
