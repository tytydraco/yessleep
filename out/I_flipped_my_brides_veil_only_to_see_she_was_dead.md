This happened three days ago, and I haven’t slept since. I don’t know how to explain what I saw. All I know is: I lifted my bride’s veil and what was underneath still hasn’t left my head.

Let me start at the beginning.

It was my wedding day.

No music. No friends. Just an old orchard behind my mother’s estate, filled with half-dead trees and rows of silent, overdressed guests I didn’t recognize—probably relatives and friends of my mother.

Each one of them covered their face in some sort of mask or veil, except my mother, who looked the happiest I’ve ever seen her, cheeks wrinkling on both sides from a permanent smile.

I never agreed to this wedding. Well, not really.

My mother planned the whole thing. She’s been planning it since I was 15. Said it was an “arrangement.” Said she “promised her mother once, a long time ago.”

“I don’t remember promising anyone anything. Where’s my say in this?”

But she acted like I did. Like this was something I wanted more than anything else in my life.

I would ask her about who the bride was. She would just smile and say,

“You knew her. Once. You two loved to play.”

That was it.

I never really fought back with my mom. I was homeschooled and worked on our farm, so I didn’t have many friends or anything growing up. She was my only support after her boyfriend left us, so something inside me felt like I needed to do this—for my mother.

The ceremony was quiet.

No music, no speeches. Just that slow shuffle of old people on soft dying grass.

The bride came down the aisle in a wooden carriage pulled by hand.

Not hand-in-hand with her brother. Or dad.

A carriage.

The people pulling the carriage stopped at the altar and brought her down carefully.

One wore a black mask resembling the facial structure of a man.

The other wore a large veil that draped from the top of her head down to her knees.

My bride wore an antique dress. High neck, long sleeves, gloves. Her veil covered everything—even the sides of her face.

She didn’t speak. Didn’t reach for me. Just stood there. Still. Frozen.

Her hands were cold. And not just from being outside. These hands felt like they hadn’t been warm in a very long time.

But no one reacted.

Not the officiant.
Not the guests.
Not even my mother.

I wasn’t sure what to do, to be honest. So I just went with it.

The vows were short. I don’t even remember them now.

I just remember that moment.

The moment when the officiant said:

“You may kiss the bride.”

I reached out.

My fingers touched the veil.

It felt dry. Old. Like lifting a dusty curtain at my grandma’s house.

I flipped it back.

And I froze.

She was dead.

The smell of decayed flesh violating my nostrils like it was waiting for me to flip her veil.

I ran off to the nearest tree and threw up.

I had no clue what to do and, to be honest, I still don’t.

I don’t know why my mom set this up. If this was some sort of prank, it was not funny at all… and nothing like my mother.

“This is beyond fucked up.”

That’s basically all that was running through my head at the time.

So I went home as fast as I could.

Didn’t say goodbye. Didn’t ask my mom what the fuck happened.

Just booked it to my car and drove straight home.

Since my wedding, my mom hasn’t said anything to me.

I’ve tried calling and texting her, but she hasn’t answered.

Maybe I should go back to check on her, but if I’m being honest… something in my gut is telling me not to.

From what I remember, the officiant said her name was Elowen.

If anyone knows a girl named Elowen who lived near Wren Orchard around 2007…

Please message me.
