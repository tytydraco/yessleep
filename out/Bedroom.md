I've never been very good at explaining things. Whenever I try to get my thoughts and memories out, they come out in random clumps of nonlinear mish-mash. However, due to recent events, and with help from friends and professionals, I have decided the most healthy thing to do is to try to get some of it out in writing. You can't suppress memories forever.

  


Right now the event I can best recall is the exact night when I began to see him again. I didn't know it was him at the time. It started about three months after I the phone call at work that resulted in an embarrassing breakdown, and was forced to stay on unpaid leave until further notice. I'll try to formulate that event into something coherent another day.



I had just gotten home from getting groceries. I felt my body ache and complain about my late nights as I climbed the stairs to my apartment, pushing the key in with my fingertips, opening the door with my elbows, and trying not to drop anything, I was greeted with a very loud meow, and the rapid footsteps of a little monster coming to see who was at the door.

  
  
“Too bad you don't have any thumbs, you could've me with this,” I tell Charlie as I set the bags of groceries down on the counter.

  
  
Her little orange and white face meowed in response. She hurriedly ran towards the sound of rustling paper bags, curious to see what was found today at the discount bin, and jump inside if there was enough space. I wrestled around with her while trying to get everything out from the bags, and after a bit, I managed to sort various cans of soup and pasta into the once-empty cabinets. I put the last bit of food away in my freezer, peeling off red stickers labeled with an expiration date of tomorrow, and then opened the window to let the stale air in my apartment out.

  
  
Trying to keep my eyes open, I shifted quickly through a thick stack of mail before tossing it aside to join a larger pile of unopened envelopes. The keywords and names my mind got used to scanning for weren't there.



Charlie popped her head out to look at me and started to purr as if she knew what I was thinking. I thought that after being together this long she could read my mind, and know exactly what I was thinking about, but with how she is I doubt much really happens inside that brain of hers. Realistically it was probably just her internal clock telling her it was time to start the daily routine we had worked ourselves into over the past few months.  


She bounced behind me as I cleaned the apartment from top to bottom, went through my emails, made my daily meal, checked the locks at least two times, those cheap locks always managed to unlatch in the middle of the night, and then cleaned again before it got too dark. Finally, when the sunlight stopped coming through the windows, we retired to the workroom to try and keep ourselves awake as long as possible. I tried, anyway, Charlie had no issue dosing off immediately underneath the table as I started to busy myself with small arts and crafts projects.

  
  
At that time, I had a lot of issues with my sleep pattern. Every time I woke up I would feel like I had run a marathon, and since I was out of work I had decided that the best course of action for me was to stay awake as long as I could. It had started shortly after I was let go, so I thought that clearly, the lack of my everyday routine must have had something to do with it. As soon as I was able to go back to my routine I would be able to sleep a full eight hours again every single night. Until then I tried everything I could to keep my mind busy.



A random video played on my phone beside me, the laptop in front of me was in the middle of some science article I had stopped reading a couple of hours ago, and arranged in a small ring around me were various cups of coffee, and bottles of cola I had been unhealthily drinking over the night. I've never had any coffee before in my entire life until around that time and honestly thought I was experiencing a heart attack the first time I had a cup. However, over a short amount of time, it lost its energizing effect. It turns out coffee also had a limit to how long it could keep a person awake.  


Focusing on several things strained my eyes heavily. Instead of closing both of them at once and risking falling asleep, every once in a while I would close one eye at a time to give them a bit of a break. I close one of them, put pressure on it with my palm, open it again, and then do the same with the other. Other times I would look up from my desk and stare down the hallway to my bedroom, to give my eyes something a bit further away to focus on for a moment.

  
  
The workroom sat on the other side of my apartment, separating them was a hallway about fifty feet long, splitting off to the kitchen, living room, and bathroom. During the day, from the other end of the apartment, I can see everything. I could see the edge of my bed, curtains, small nightstand, and the red-lit numbers on my alarm clock. Sometimes in the night, when I sat in my chair and looked up from whatever I was doing, I could still make out the shape of everything in the dark.  


Even when it was pitch black, it was still familiar to me. I could focus and make out the shapes of the furniture and where everything was supposed to be. The edge of the bed, curtains, nightstand, the red-lit numbers. If I stared and focused hard enough I could even tell what time it was from where I sat. Every once in a while though the shadows would play tricks on me, dancing in weird patterns to make me think I saw something when I hadn't. The red of the alarm clock became eyes instead of numbers, the curtains arms, and the table a small freakish body. When this happens I would take a deep breath, not panic, and instead, tell myself that I have to close my eyes to let them rest a moment before opening them again. When I open them again I would realize there is nothing there.

  
  
This was one of those times. I stared too long and started to see something form within the shadows. I groaned and closed both of my eyes, rubbed them with my palms, and then took another look. It didn't help, the shadows at the end of the hall still bent, and twisted, playing with my mind. I squinted harder, a heavy pressure bored into my eye-lids, threatening to snap them close again. On the other side of my apartment, beyond the open bedroom door, was a wall of darkness completely unfamiliar.  


Maybe the batteries ran out on my alarm clock. That's why everything looked so confusing. The red of the numbers must have been a sort of reference point for my brain and now that the clock went out I'm not able to make out where everything else in the room was. But this was the exact thing I was worried about when I bought the alarm clock. I was afraid that the batteries would go kaput in the middle of the night and I would wake up late for work. Because of that, I bought one with a cable that I could plug into the wall.

  
  
My stomach sank even deeper as I sat up in my chair, trying to be more alert. I questioned if I had to unplug it earlier for something when suddenly a shadow shifted in the darkness. A piece of black that was a completely different shade of black had sat itself upwards in the void. The pressure I had felt suddenly squeezed my chest a bit tighter in response. I took a hard deep breath, struggling to keep my eyes open, as I stood up from my desk.

  
  
At the moment I felt either a surge of stupidity or braveness but I wanted to see who or what it was. Suddenly the shape moved again, rising higher from its current spot and stopping. The burst of energy I had left my body instantly and I kept my eyes glued to it, not wanting to blink and miss another sudden flinch or movement. I didn't think whoever was there knew that I could see them. I needed to call for help. My phone was charging in the kitchen, and if I was quiet enough I could sneak by, grab it, and call the police to report an intruder had broken into my home.

  
  
Of course, that's what it had to be right? Maybe I forgot to check a lock or left a window open somewhere. I focused hard, forcing my already strained eyes to try to gather more details from stranger. I tried to make out a face, height, or any distinctive, but my exhausted vision twisted the shapes too far. Each limb looked too long to be normal, the legs bent at strange angles, and the arms scrapped the ground. The face, or where its face should have been located, was shrouded in a black indistinguishable from the darkness around it.

  
  
Carefully I stepped around my desk, not wanting to take my eyes off of the intruder when suddenly they moved again. They slid to the right, then tried to take a step but shot their leg too far. It slid out from underneath them, almost sending them toppling over but suddenly freezing before they hit the floor. With a loud crack and pop it slipped back up, resetting itself with one leg forward.  


Panic started to slowly take hold as I stopped fighting against my body. I let my eyes shut and open again and again, hoping each time that the shape would be gone but it still stood there motionless. Whoever it was at the end of the hallway knew I was there. They moved when I moved, and now the two of us stood frozen staring each other down. I raised my leg to make another move, and the intruder did the same, raising a leg a bit too high to take a normal step and let it hover in the air. I go to lower my leg, and the intruder lets his fall to the ground, sliding out from under him with a crunch before pulling itself straight up.  


My mouth fell open, I wanted to shout something intimidating, to lie and tell them I was armed or that the police were already on their way. Anything to break the silence before I planned to reach out and slam the door to my workroom shut. I started to shout, sucking in air and filling my lungs but before anything got past my throat the stranger beat me to it. The shadows where its mouth should be snapped open and cracked, sending a wet tear down the hallway, followed by a faint desperate gasp for air.

  
  
“Meow”

  
  
My chest jumped so hard at that moment that I thought I had died. I spun around in a panic to see Charlie poke her head around her sleeping spot behind the table looking just past me. A faint meow comes from the other end of the apartment, making me spin back around to once again see the red glow of my alarm clock.



Five twenty-three in the morning, cold blue rays of daylight forming beyond the curtains. Gradually the shape of my bed, night table, and curtains slowly come back into view. I take a long deep breath and rub my temple, leaning back against my desk, and finally close my eyes for longer than a second at a time, giving them the rest that they begged for. Charlie purred and hopped onto the table, rubbing herself against my arm and wanting attention.

  
  
“bedtime?”

  
  
Charlie only purrs in response. She's a cat, if someone had broken into the apartment she would have picked it up and alerted me, no matter how quiet the intruder was.



I guess I had no choice anymore. I did everything in my power to avoid it but when it came to visual and auditory hallucinations, maybe it was time to give in and get some shut-eye. Everyone has a limit, and I had pushed mine too much. I carefully took the little white noise machine in my arms and held her close to my chest, the two of us taking a moment to stare down the hallway together before leaving the room. The dark we were met with was empty and familiar like it always was.
