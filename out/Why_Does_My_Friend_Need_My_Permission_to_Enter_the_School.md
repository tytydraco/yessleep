I always knew that empty schools at night possess a certain morbid charm. The immense architecture, built to contain hundreds of children's voices, feels different when it is silent; it's the same feeling you get from empty malls, gas stations, and traffic lights late at night. The concept of a place teeming with life, now utterly deserted and oblivious to the absence. But that night, something was fundamentally displaced. Not just silence, but a kind of apprehension in the air, as if the space were only pretending to be empty...

I arrived at nine forty, late for our class’s astronomical observation event. It was an activity that took place in the senior year of high school, already a tradition at our school. In the group chat, my classmates had already sent dozens of messages saying they were *"in the courtyard," "on the court," "in front of the banners,"* with animated selfies under lighting that seemed... normal. Yet, as my mother's car zipped away and I stepped through the gate, the first thing I felt was that this normal had evaporated.

The light in the main hallway flickered at long, almost lazy intervals, casting elongated shadows that seemed to try and escape their frames. The temperature inside was a few degrees colder than outside, and the thermal shock caused an inevitable chattering of my teeth. And there was a subtle metallic smell, like dust mashed together with humidity, a scent that immediately put me on alert, though I couldn't explain why.

I called out for the group. No answer. No distant laughter, no footsteps, no friction of backpacks being dragged. Only the echo of my own voice.

— Okay, guys, it's not funny!

No response.

I proceeded down the corridor of Block B, the one that leads to the gymnasium. As I walked, I felt something I can't describe precisely: a slight pressure on my temples, like when you’re about to get a headache. But the pain never arrived. It was just the anticipation of pain. A discomfort that seemed to accompany my steps, the sound of them hammering against my eardrums with force.

Upon reaching the gymnasium door, I noticed the lock was askew, as if someone had tried to break it open. Looking closer, it didn't seem to have been done with tools. Look, it's not like I'm an expert, but my dad is a mechanic, and I've seen plenty of car locks scratched by screwdrivers and the like, but this padlock was sort of... strange. Something had scratched the metal, but it was more precise and fine, almost like cat claw marks on a sofa. I touched the grooves on impulse; my fingertips found deep, warm scratches, as if they had been made minutes ago. That made me abruptly pull back.

That's when I heard the first sound coming from inside the gym. It wasn't a loud noise. It was more like a shifting of weight: something large dragging itself along, a low, grave sound. Then, a dry crack, similar to an enormous joint being forced into function. And then... silence. A silence so abrupt that my mind filled the void with scenarios worse than any concrete sound could offer.

My body automatically entered that state of alert that precedes a desperate sprint. You know how it is: the racing heart, that sensation of blood rushing to your extremities, your restless legs begging to run. But, for some reason, I didn't run. Maybe it was the persistence of my colleagues' messages in my memory, all saying "we're here." Maybe it was the irrational idea that it was all a very elaborate prank. Or, perhaps, it was simply morbid curiosity.

I took a deep breath, pushed the door open, and the gym was empty. The emergency lighting cast a faint yellow hue over the bleachers and the scratched floor. There were abandoned backpacks near the side exit, three of them open, with notebooks haphazardly strewn about. A water bottle rolled slightly as the door slammed shut behind me, as if it had been nudged moments before I entered.

Then I realized: my feet were stepping on something sticky. I slowly lowered my phone, using the flashlight to illuminate the floor. For a moment, I thought it was dark paint... but the viscosity was thicker, more irregular. I slowly pulled my foot away and felt the material yield with a damp resistance that instantly made my stomach clench. My chest tightened with a new urgency, legitimate, raw fear.

— Okay, I have to get out of here.

I grabbed my phone, but guess what, no signal. The gym had signal blockers, something about not being able to slack off during physical education classes.

It was at that instant, as I spun around to return to the courtyard, that I saw the silhouette standing outside, leaning against the street lamp on the sidewalk, looking into the school with an almost solemn immobility. Leonardo?

For a few seconds, I felt a ridiculous surge of relief. A familiar anchor. A known face in a sea of shadows. But when I ran up to the gate, I noticed he didn't look... normal. It was Leonardo, yes, but a paler Leonardo. Had he seen some of what happened? I wondered if, perhaps, my state of panic had also drained the blood from my own face. He didn't smile when he saw me. He simply tracked me with his eyes, as if assessing my movements with mathematical precision. I stopped in front of him, the gate between us.

— Hey man, — I asked, trying to sound casual and failing miserably. — Did you just get here?

Leonardo took a moment before responding, as if he were choosing every word with extreme care.

— Ah... uh... yeah. I was late. And can I come in?

The way he said it, so direct, so simple, made something deep in my brain squirm. I gave a tense laugh.

— Something's wrong in here, Leo. Something big, I think. And there’s something that... I don't know, looks like blood on the court. I think... I think something happened to everyone.

He blinked slowly. It was impressive how a trivial gesture could seem almost... studied.

— I saw them going in... — He looked past me, his eyes scanning the school, as if checking if anyone else was with me. — Let's see what it is. Just let me in and we'll figure this out right away.

— Oh, the gate isn't locked, remember?

— So, you mean I can come in?

A shiver ran down my spine. Why was he insisting so much on this?

Leonardo took a step forward but stopped abruptly upon reaching the line of shadow cast by the streetlight. I stared at him and took a step back. His eyes had a vivid, blood-red glow, I would say, a predator’s gaze.

— Invite me in, — he said, his voice too calm. — I can keep you alive.

I was trembling. Literally shaking, with the phone vibrating in my hands, not because someone was calling me, but from the sheer instability of my fingers. I felt hypnotized by that stare...

Before I could answer, a noise echoed inside the school. A dry, scraping sound, as if something was running along a wall with many limbs, many contacts, many parts. I heard the impact reverberate all the way to us at the gate, as if the thing had chosen that exact moment to remind me it wasn't that far away.

My entire body reacted so strongly that I had to grab the gate to keep from falling.

— I don't know if I can trust you.

His gaze didn't change. But something in his tone became more... sincere, or perhaps hungrier. I can't tell the difference.

— If I could force my way in, I would have already.

He stepped back into the shadows of the post.

— But I'm afraid that what you heard doesn't need an invitation...

Behind me, inside the school, I heard another impact, closer this time, as if something were leaving the court, walking down the corridor that led to the gate.

I don't know who is telling the truth. Maybe no one is. I'm locked in the small janitor's room. I can see the post through the window; Leonardo is still there, his hand extended toward me, not crossing the boundary of the light.

— Say the words. Let me in. — I can hear him whisper.

I already tried calling my mom, but the phone shows up as *"out of coverage area"*. No other number works, actually. I have signal but I just... can't complete the call. And now, the thing inside the school just touched the doorknob behind me. I really am undecided, and I just wanted to do the damn astronomy activity...
