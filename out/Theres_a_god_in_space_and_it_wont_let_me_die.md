Trigger warning: Suicide

I doubt these logs will ever be seen by another living being, I don't care. What happened to my crew, what's still happening to me is something that needs to be documented, so here it is.

 I’ll start back on earth in the year 2096, humanity came out of that recession in the 2030’s basically thriving, we had solved the climate crisis and set up permanently on mars. Jupiter had been visited twice already and now humanity had its eyes on Saturn with the next big Apollo mission.

Apollo 31 had 4 crew members total: Vladamir Nevsky (Russian), Manny West (American), Phoebe Morizzi (Italian) and myself Heather milton (Australian).

 Us 4 spent months together preparing for this trip, making sure we get along, learning how to most effectively work together, and all that shit that doesn't matter now, just to say: we were excited, the whole of humanity was, the first steps on a new planet. The launch was broadcasted not just on mars (where we took off from) but also back on earth. The ship was supposed to be a “Marvel of engineering”, with enough food, water and fuel to make the trip to Saturn and back 3 times over.

 We were supposed to go down in the history books, our names to be known for centuries to come… I wish I never got on this piece of shit.

I’ll skip the whole event, we were now stuck in space for the better part of a decade. The trip there was going to take 3 years give or take, so the ship was installed with cryopods. I remember climbing into them at the end of the first week, how excited I was to wake up and be closer to that asteroid belt than any other humans in history. When I did wake up, there were alarms blaring and Manny was standing over me pulling me upright 

“Quickly up, let's go!"

He led me through the ship to the main living area, in there we found Phoebe and Vlad. 

The cryo pods were supposed to wake us up when we were about 3 months away, but were programmed to do so earlier in case of an emergency, apparently mine didn’t and I had to be woken up manually by the others, I should have seen it then and there. 

“We got nailed by something,” said phoebe. 

“What?” I responded.

 “Ship logs say it was an asteroid, it was seen coming hours beforehand but…”

 Vlad quickly cut her off “The ship is too stupid to dodge a rock, now we have giant hole in the engine”

 I quickly turned towards him “THERE'S A HOLE IN THE ENGINE?!”

“Don’t listen to him, Yeah it did hit the engine but its nothing the MRD’s can’t fix”.

The ship was equipped with several functions to take care of itself, the main one were the Micro Repair Drones, little things that made a lot of noise, knew the exact blueprint of the ship and where stored in a deceptively heavy box. 

“Main problem is the thrusters lost connection, so until it's fixed we’re space debris”

At this point Vlad was halfway through putting on one of the space suits against the wall 

“And I drew the short straw, so I have to go deploy them” he said as he started walking out of the room with an annoyed but determined strut

Manny started trailing him “The path there should be completely pressurized, but once you get to the engine room if you’re not….” 

“Yeah, yeah i’ll be careful, you know i'm just as qualified as you are” said Vlad as he glanced back giving Phoebe and I a witty smirk.

I didn’t know it then, but when he closed the door behind him, it would be the last time I saw Vlad in person.

The rest of us moved towards the cockpit, there we could monitor the rest of the ship with access to various sensors and cameras. 

Manny’s radio started up “I’ve got the drones, heading to engine now”

 We all glanced at each other as an invisible tension filled the room. I wondered if everyone else had the same sinking feeling in their gut as I did. Phoebe flicked the camera’s onto one of the monitors, searching through them till she found Vlad. 

Manny picked up his radio “We got eyes on you”

“Great, I've always loved having an audience. I expect an applause when i'm finished”  

At this point I was kind of thankful for his constant sarcasm, it made me feel a little less anxious about dying in space. Eventually he was 2 rooms away from the engine, he attached a cord from the back of the suit to an anchor on the wall and picked back up the box of MRD’s.

Phoebe switched to the camera in the engine room as Vlad walked in, it was then that I got my first look at the damage. A few loose cables and a hole the size of my head, I now understood why Vlad was so calm. He put down the box and pressed a little red button. As the box was opening the computer pinged the motion sensor.

If my gut was sinking before, now it was in the mariana trench. The radar showed a red dot fast approaching the ship, so fast we only had seconds to react. It was like the universe itself had a sniper rifle, and it wasn't letting us get away this time.

Manny was mumbling panicked words under his breath when Phoebe quickly grabbed the radio off his waist

 “Vlad we have another object incoming and it's coming fast, get somewhere safer befo…” 

I remember those next moments like it was mere minutes ago, my eyes locked onto that camera feed. Vlad had barely reacted to Phoebe when an asteroid the size of a horse came smashing through the engine room, the whole ship shook and started to spiral. Looking back at the camera’s vlad was gone, and I don't mean he was disfigured or made into a paste, Vlad along with 1/3 of the engine room had been ripped from the ship entirely. His suit's cord was still attached to its anchor 2 rooms away, but it was torn in 2 and dangling in the open space. Vladimir Nevsky was the first to die.

That was 3 months ago, since then we had just been getting further and further from earth. In retrospect, it all felt so meticulously crafted. Even though now I’m who knows how many thousands of kilometers from where Vlad died, I feel like this bastard outside my window had something to do with it. Or maybe I'm going insane, trying to rationalise the irrational, maybe it was all just bad luck.

Anyway, I remember how panicked Manny and Phoebe were. Manny scrambled to another console, Phoebe typed and clicked. I couldn't take my eyes off that camera feed.

Next thing I remember, Phoebe had stopped our spinning, we have more thrusters completely detached from the main engine. Glad this marvelous ship actually had a working component. But we were still drifting through space, and our friend was dead.

We quickly sealed off the engine room, the MRD’s weren't fixing that hole. Manny spent the first week Meticulously inspecting the ship, while Phoebe desperately tried to ping one of the satellites around Jupiter. you know when you're in highschool and think there's no meaning to life, I mean what's a botanist supposed to do to fix a ship.

I walked up to Manny, trying to cure my boredom with some conversation.

“If I can help with anything let me know”

“the greenhouse still has power” he quickly responded 

“I didn't notice we lost power”

“Well most of the ship running on backups, but the greenhouse is still connected to main” 

To be honest I had completely forgotten about the greenhouse on the ship, I was about to call it quits already but now I had something to fill my time.

 I'll stop interjecting with my bitterness. but just one last time, I wish I saw the early signs of the hopelessness of our survival and I gave up when I still could.

It was around this time I grabbed out a calendar I brought from home, nothing special on it just some pictures of cats and started tracking the days. The next 3 weeks nothing really happened. we would all go off and waste time during the “day”, And come together for at least 1 meal before bed. You would think that meal would be the brightest part of the day, but it was always 3 miserable people discussing what to do with ourselves.

We discussed going back to the Cryo Pods but they were also on backup power. Phoebe told us about the service pistol in the cockpit, but that was a discussion we weren't ready for. We never changed anything. At some point Phoebe brang Manny and I into the cockpit to show us an old game called “doom” she somehow managed to get working on the monitors. It helped cure boredom for a while, we would all take turns till about 1 month ago when the backup power died. Only a few rooms stayed lit the greenhouse, bedrooms, livingspace and the airlock. 

We started using flashlights to make our way around. Manny had gotten noticeably more dull, he spent all his free time fiddling with the ship and its mechanisms. One night Manny didn't show up at the table.

“you seen Manny around?” I asked Phoebe 

“I don't think he's left his room”

“Maybe we should check on him, he’s gotten pretty quiet recently, well more than usual” 

“Yeah I worry about the kid, you ever figure out what he was doing around the ship, before the power died?” 

“I always assumed he was trying to not let that happen” 

After we ate our rations, we grabbed some more and made our way over to Manny’s room. He was the youngest of us all, and never the particularly social type, I almost saw him as a little brother.

We reached the door and knocked 

“You alright Manny? We brought you some dinner” 

No response 

At this point I was expecting it, I'd become so bitter and cold already, from drifting in space for weeks and watching Vlad be ripped away from us. I think Phoebe was still holding onto some hope, I saw it drain from her eyes as the door opened. 

Manny was suspended about a foot from the ground, a stepping stool kicked over under his feet. He was hanging from a makeshift noose made from his bedsheets, with a hand written note on his nightstand. Manny West was the second crew member to die, the first to kill himself.

“I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. I can't keep drifting aimlessly. The most exciting moment of my life has turned into pure misery. I managed to reroute power to the Cryopods, I don't blame you if you don't use them. I hope you girls the best, for whatever awaits this ship. Goodbye” 

Phoebe left almost immediately, ran to the bathroom to throw up. I waited for her in the living area, and showed her the note. I could tell she was still processing it when she spoke.

“W-we should move the body, I don't want to leave him there” 

I nodded and stood up

“The airlock still works”

Phoebe didn't help, I didn't expect her to. I found a knife, cut through his bedsheets and carried Manny's cold lifeless body through the ship. I didn't really think about it, tried not to. I gently placed him on the floor of the airlock, and took a moment to look at his face, his eyes still open. The man that pulled me from my dysfunctional pod, potentially saving my life, now laid lifeless In Front of me. I closed his eyes.

By the time I stood up and turned around, Phoebe was waiting by the door. I met her gaze, and walked up to her. 

“Is this right?” she asked

I hadn’t really thought about the morality of ejecting our friend into space, at least this time it was by choice.

“Yeah, Space burials are a thing right?”

“We’re supposed to cremate the body first, but yeah”

Phoebe walked up to the glass and pressed her hand against it. she mumbled something that i couldn’t hear then walked up to the button.

We watched as the airlock door sealed, the room decompress, then open into the dark abyss of space. We watched on as it swallowed Manny’s body. He was gone now, out of sight, out of mind. 

The next few days went by, me and phoebe didn't talk much but there was a mutual understanding that we didn’t want to. We stopped sharing meals together and one day I walked past the room with the cryo pods to find lights on. Phoebe was standing there, as I walked in she turned her head towards me.

“I’ve been considering getting in, at least if we still die we won’t know it happened” 

“You can do it, I personally would like to know when it does”

“I don’t like the idea of hanging, or slitting my wrists. It’s all creates a mess for someone else to find a cleanup”

There was a once a point in time where we didn’t want to talk about the option of suicide. Now standing in this room, listening to Phoebe, it almost sounded like an inevitability.

“I would pick the airlock” was my reply

It was a week ago, when I had gotten out of bed, eaten and made my way into the cockpit to stargaze. I noticed something off in the distance, what looked like a blackhole. Almost excitedly, I called out to phoebe.

“Hey Phoebe, come check this out” 

I could hear her quiet footsteps in the empty halls slowly get louder as she found her way into the cockpit.

“Is that a blackhole?” she asked

“Maybe it’ll pull us in, at least death would be interesting”

“Or we wouldn’t die, only god knows what happens when you enter one of those things”

“Sure, but we might still do something no humans ever done before” 

It’s funny thinking the most hopeful I'd been in months was at the thought of getting sucked into a black hole. Phoebe didn’t share my sentiment.

“I’m thinking you were right, I would prefer to know when it happens”

There was a long pause before she spoke again.

“Could you come with me” 

I stood up and followed her through the ship, she led me to the airlock before stopping.

“When we left Mars, I didn't think anything remotely close to this could happen. I mean I know we could have blown up or crashed into the planet or something but not this” 

She took another pause, and then looked up at me.

“Are you going to go into the blackhole?”

I took a moment to think about it, I knew what she was about to do and I considered joining her.

“Yeah i guess so, it's the most exciting thing that's happened since we got hit”

“Okay well, if it kills you, you’ll have to tell me about it in the afterlife”

We both chuckled, Then she hugged me.

“Goodbye Heather, you where a good friend”

I was a bit stuck for words but i did tearily get out one

“Goodbye”

With that, Phoebe stepped into the airlock. She looked back at me, then walked over to the button inside the airlock. She turned to face the other door as she pressed down on the button. I watched as the airlock door sealed, the room decompressed, then opened into the dark abyss of space. In those final moments I believe she was at peace with her decision. Phoebe Morizzi was the final crew member to die, the second to kill themself.

I was then alone, in an empty dark ship, in the middle of space, not a single living being for thousands of kilometers. Or so I thought. The next 2 days were a little scary, sometimes I thought I heard footsteps or the ship would beep and I would have to remind myself that I was alone. I would spend my time in the greenhouse or in the cockpit watching as I drifted closer to the “blackhole”. 

At the end of that 2nd day I noticed the blackhole looked wrong, there was a small bit of light in the middle of it and the whole thing seemed to warp and move. Something about it made me uncomfortable so the next day I didn't look at it at all. 

3 days ago, I made my way back into the cockpit. It was not a blackhole. Light wrapped around it like it was, but what I was looking at was some Lovecraftian abomination. I’ve spent hours staring at it and yet I still struggle to describe it. The edge’s of it move in sharp scale like waves, it has a thousand arms and a thousand legs and a thousand tentacles that **wrap around my mind**. A single white dot twice the size of the ship darted around, it must be its eye, when it saw me it locked onto me and it hasn't **stopped staring**, I can **feel its gaze** through the walls no matter where I hide its always **watching**. 

…

I had to stop writing, this thing drives me mad whenever I'm forced to think about it. When I got closer, like I mentioned, its eye locked onto me and the ship was thrust in front of it at an impossible speed. A single tendril devoid of any light emerged from the black mass and wrapped itself around the ship. It wrapped it so tight I heard the metal of the ship crunch under the pressure, then the lights came on. The entire ship had power again. I looked back at it, I hated doing it. I watched the tendril slither back in the lightless void that was its body, it hasn’t moved since. 

Every time I try to sleep I dream of the thing, it drags my mind through the ship and to the cockpit where I stare at the thing. fear fills my body and yet i can’t look away, not until i wake up, always in a cold sweat. I hear it lurking the halls, thousands of heavy wet footsteps always just around the corner. Hands, disfigured, sharp and scaly reaching for my shoulder, **touching** my shoulder, **grabbing** me and **dragging** me into its inky abyss but when I turn around there's nothing. Eyes hundreds of eyes, thousands of eyes, **millions of eyes**. A single eye, of pure light staring into my soul, calling for me.

Yesterday I remembered the gun in the cockpit. I sat in my greenroom, staring at the peace lily I had been growing. I thought about the others, all that time we spent bonding and preparing to go into space. It was all wasted, we barely even talked compared to the amount of time we spent together on this ship. Each day we all got more miserable, incapable of cheering each other up at all. Vlad got it the best i think, didn't have to spend a single day thinking his life was pointless. a single second even, he was killed almost instantly. That poor boy Manny, he had so much potential and joy through his quiet demeanour and I had to watch as it all drained from him till he was left hanging. I wish I got to say goodbye to him. And Phoebe, such a sweet woman, we were actually born in the same hospital, decade apart and before her parents moved back to Italy but… I remember that's how we initially bonded during training, talking about growing up in the same area. I should have joined her.

I was supposed to be famous, or important or something more than stuck on a ship that didn’t fucking work drifting through space for months. All my fellow crew members are dead, I'm the only one still alive with an eldritch horror outside, and a gun in my hand, about to be dead too. I spent years of my life leading up to the moment I left for Saturn, and in the span of a few minutes that moment was ripped away from me. The realization that all those years were wasted, not just on a failed mission but a mission that sent me drifting in an endless expanse was something I had spent months contemplating.

Eventually I looked down to the gun in my hand, it was time. I checked the ammo, it was loaded. I put it up to my head and pulled the trigger. my mind was dragged through the ship and to the cockpit to stare at it. this time was different, this time I wasn't dreaming.

I shot awake, my head was piercing with pain and the left side of my face was covered in blood. Even though I was looking at the floor I could tell. I was in the cockpit. Without a second thought I stood up, my head throbbing harder with pain. It took everything within me to not look out the window, and as I walked out I noticed a trail of blood on the floor, leading from where I was laying towards the greenhouse.

As soon as I got out of the cockpit, I looked back down at my hand. Gun was still there, I checked the ammo, it was loaded. I shot myself again, and I woke up again. I tried my heart, I tried my neck, I tried every angle into my brain I could think of and everytime I would wake back up in that cockpit. Eventually I ran out of ammo. 

The pains didn’t linger for too long, I got changed out of my blood covered clothes. Eventually after some thinking I found myself here, at this terminal, Writing everything down, to no one. I guess I'll humor it, look at it, got nothing else to do. something must have changed right, if it dragged me back to the window so many times.

…

It’s bigger now, It unfurled like some sort of centipede. A million teeth, jagged and thin. calling me into the gaping maw of the titan, there's no sound in space but I can hear its call, it's hungry and I **have** to feed it. I **want** to feed it. Feed myself to it. I’ll save this all here, on this terminal in empty space, next to my god. It is **my** will to have this documented. I’m going to the airlock. This has been Heather Milton, the last crew member of Apollo: 31, the first to become immortal.
