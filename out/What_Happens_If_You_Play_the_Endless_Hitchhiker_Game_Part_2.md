Hi everyone.  
First of all: thank you, I guess, for all the messages on [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lqrpxg/what_happens_if_you_play_the_endless_hitchhiker/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). I never imagined so many people would read this, let alone comment. I read every question and, even if some were kind of indignant, I appreciate it. It makes me feel like I’m not completely alone in this.

A lot of people asked: *“Where the hell was Maya sitting? How did the passenger get in?”*

Good question, actually. I think I just couldn’t describe it properly.

My car is an older model, kind of adapted. We used to take my grandfather in it for his therapy sessions when he was at the end of his life. The back seats, especially the middle one, move on rails horizontally. There’s a lever underneath that lets you pull or push the seat almost up to the gear box and handbrake. Maya was sitting up front with me, and when that thing appeared, she threw herself back, pulling the seat forward so she could stay by my side, clinging to my arm like a child in a storm. She stayed there, almost wedged in the middle of the car, her knees bent, trying to shrink and disappear. I don’t know if that makes sense, but I hope it helps you picture it.

So… back to where I stopped:

The man carved his words into my mind: what would the “gift reserved for me” be? If Maya’s was this terrible encounter, would mine be… and yes, that thought crossed my mind: would I find Noah? Or maybe be confronted by my greatest fear? I felt a chill thinking about it and couldn’t help looking at my girlfriend’s hands, clinging to my shoulder, trembling.

The car stayed quiet for a long stretch, but not with a peaceful silence, it felt like it was building up inside the vehicle like thick smoke. I didn’t dare break it. Neither did Maya, who was still practically glued to me, her face half-buried in my shoulder, breathing too fast.

Then, without warning, the passenger slightly tilted his head in my direction again.

“You think about him a lot, don’t you?”

I didn’t need to ask who he meant. Noah’s name seemed to echo inside me, even without being spoken. I tried to answer, but my throat only made a rough, half-choked sound. The man just smiled, this time with lips stretched so thin at an angle that didn’t belong to a human face.

“Interesting how you humans carry so much weight for words thrown to the wind. As if a mouth had more power than blood.”

He looked back at the road, settling back into the seat again. But I couldn’t let out my breath for a long time, his emphasis on the word *human* pounding in my head that now tried to figure out what kind of being he really was. My hands tightened around the wheel until they hurt.

“Up ahead there’s a gas station. Stop there,” he said, in a casual tone that made me hate him more than any threat ever could. “Let’s stretch our legs.”

I tried to protest but nothing came out. Maya looked at me, eyes wide, silently begging me not to do anything stupid. So I just nodded, almost mechanically.

Minutes later, the station lights appeared up ahead, half dead, some flickering too slowly, like bulbs dying out. The sign said *SHOP & GAS,* but the ‘S’ at the end was burned out, so it just read *SHOP & GA\_.* The nearest pump was dripping fuel in an irregular rhythm, creating little black puddles on the concrete.

I parked near the convenience store, fog covering the whole ground and the horizon. The passenger opened the door slowly and gestured for me to get out too.

“Come. I need you inside.”

I looked at Maya, who squeezed my hand even tighter.

“Don’t leave me here, Jake…” she whispered.

“I won’t. I promise,” I lied, with no idea what was waiting for me, but deep down I think she knew...

I stepped out with trembling legs, the passenger at my side, almost setting the pace of my steps. The store door opened at his touch, ringing out with a long metallic chime that didn’t sound like any bell I knew. Inside, the shelves were lined in narrow aisles, generic products, yellowed packaging, and a stubborn smell of mildew.

The man gave me a look full of expectation and started walking through the aisles, disappearing among rows of expired chips and old magazines. I followed him, my stomach in knots, feeling like each step pulled me deeper into that sluggish white light.

The fluorescent lamps buzzed loudly, some flickered, casting shadows that squirmed in the corners of the ceiling like they were alive. The floor creaked under my shoes, stained with little dark smudges, maybe oil, maybe dried blood, I wasn’t sure anymore.

The passenger moved with absurd ease, like he knew every shelf in that place. He stopped in front of a row of dead freezers, the glass fogged up inside, and ran his index finger along the metal top, leaving a clean line through the dust. Then he slowly turned to me.

“Pick something, Jake.”

“What?” My voice came out hoarse, almost cracking. I was so tense I felt something pop in my back when I straightened up.

“Anything. A simple gesture. A gift from you to me. You come to me wanting something, don’t you? Well then, I want a souvenir too.”

I looked around. It made no sense. Everything there seemed too old, too forgotten to matter to anyone, let alone that thing talking so politely, like a customer waiting to be served.

But something in the way he looked at me: patient, yet with a flicker of hunger behind his eyes, forced me to obey.

My eyes scanned the shelves with difficulty. Nothing there seemed real. The packages looked more static than actual objects, like stage props in a poorly built play, just waiting for the next scene change to dissolve.

My hands were shaking so much I had to press them together. I passed dented cans of unbranded soda, opaque packages that didn’t say what they contained. Everything felt out of place, wrong.

Then I saw something.

At the back of one of the shelves, almost hidden behind a pile of moldy candy, there was a small plastic figurine. A little green toy soldier, the cheap kind, with half its face deformed, maybe melted by time or some old heat. One arm was missing, the ragged stump looked like it had been torn off. Still, it clutched a tiny crooked rifle in its other hand.

My fingers grabbed it before I could think better. It was light, fragile, almost warm. I felt a sharp sting run up my hand, and when I looked, I saw its tiny plastic edges had split the surface of my palm, rupturing small capillaries that now bled tiny drops. I ignored it.

I went back to where the man was. He was waiting in front of the freezer, standing with his hands clasped behind his back, contained. When I held out the toy, he took it delicately, pinching it between his thumb and forefinger. He brought the toy closer to his face, examined it.

Then he smiled. This time it was a genuine smile, almost happy, which made it a thousand times worse.

"A simple gift" he said. "But it carries something important."

"What?" I asked, before I could stop myself.

He didn’t answer. He just slipped the toy into his suit pocket and started walking back toward the door. I had no choice but to follow, my body obeying as if it were attached to invisible strings.

As we crossed back through the silent aisles, I noticed some packages seemed to tilt slightly toward me, with no wind to justify the movement. The floor felt stickier, clinging to the soles of my shoes, releasing a pungent, almost sweet odor that made my eyes water.

When we stepped out, the cold night air was almost a relief. In the car, Maya was still curled up, staring fixedly at nothing, her eyes wide and glossy. When she saw me, she let out a small, tense sob and reached out her arm for mine. I laced our fingers together, squeezed tight, mostly to reassure myself that she still existed there.

The passenger got back into the seat next to me without a word, settling in with that almost ceremonial care. Then he tapped the dashboard once, a gesture almost affectionate, like he was congratulating the car for bringing us this far.

"Now, Jake, keep driving. We’re almost there."

"Arriving… where?" I ventured, my voice hoarse, shaking.

He just tilted his head to the side, smiling.

"Keep going."

I obeyed.  
My hands found the wheel, and before I realized it, the car was moving again, devouring the road that seemed to stretch out on its own, the hypnotic pattern of painted lines slipping under the vehicle as we drove further and further away from home.

The landscape changed. I don’t know when it happened, but I realized the trees were gone, replaced by rows of poles without wires, each with a lone lantern hanging down, casting circular pools of light onto the asphalt. Between them, only darkness. As we passed under each lamp, I felt a brief warmth on my face, like a tiny sun.

The passenger stares out the window. Sometimes he whispers things I can’t understand, maybe not even in English. Or maybe they’re not words at all. Certain syllables leave a ringing in my ear, a small throbbing pain. Then he starts to hum. A slow song, no clear melody, just spaced notes, almost childlike. Maya shudders every time he starts the cycle again. I try to squeeze her hand as comfort, but my own fingers are stiff, almost numb.

"We’re close" the passenger says. "You’re going to love seeing old friends again."

I see flashes of my family, back when everything was calmer, happier. Laughing at the lake, my brother kicking water at me, our hands rough from endless pool games, the way my mother would shake out her wet hair. All of it crossed by the final memory of our father’s car parked, engine running, radio hissing.

The car starts to slow down on its own. I look at the speedometer: the needle wavers, drops, even though I haven’t touched the pedal. I try to brake, but the pedal gives no resistance, it sinks too easily. The passenger only smiles, staring out the windshield like he’s watching a private show.

Then I see it: up ahead, a dimly lit structure. Looks like an old cargo yard, the kind where trucks park overnight. There are lights strung on precarious wires, forming a large square of brightness in the middle of nowhere. Inside it, silhouettes stand still.

The car rolls into the yard without my command. The lights flicker, revealing human shapes scattered there, all facing us, faces hidden by the shadows cast by the bulbs themselves. They look like they’re waiting.

Maya starts crying softly, her body trembling. She tries to curl up even more in her seat. I try to pull her closer, but I can’t move my arm. It’s like the seat has grabbed me, holding me there.

The passenger leans forward, satisfied. He taps the dashboard twice, like a signal.

"Ready," he says. "Now let’s see who shows up for you."

Minutes or maybe hours passed with the car parked there, engine still rumbling in a deep growl. I lost any sense of time. It could have been the whole night, or just one long minute. The passenger, satisfied, just stared ahead, drumming the dashboard with meticulous nails.

Then he opened the door.

The sound of metal scraping, cold wind invading the car. The man stepped out calmly, adjusting his wrinkled suit jacket, tapping his hat lightly against his leg as if brushing off invisible dust. Then he bent down and looked at us.

"Come. It’s time to meet with… certain important figures."

My body reacted before my mind had any chance to protest. My hands let go of the wheel, I unbuckled the seatbelt almost without noticing, felt the seat push me forward with an almost organic click, like the car was cooperating with him. Maya stepped out behind me, reluctant, her face marked with the trail her tears had left on her cheeks.

Outside, the air was heavy, damp, smelling of wet earth and gasoline. The hanging lights swayed slightly, following the howling wind. The figures were closer now, forming a wide semicircle around us. Motionless. Some stood in crooked poses, heads tilted, arms hanging in the air like marionettes.

The passenger made a wide gesture with his hand, almost theatrical. And then, from the shadows beyond the light, something began to move.

At first I only saw a tall, staggering shape. Then, thin legs, dark jeans stained with something that might have been oil, but I suspected was something else. When it stepped under the weak light, my stomach turned inside out.

It was Noah.

I had always wondered what it would be like to see him again. My mind drifted through so many scenarios, maybe one day I’d find him again, he’d explain it was all a misunderstanding, that he just wanted to run away from home or something. In those fantasies, I always imagined myself crying, but now, I couldn’t show any reaction at all… not even the smallest one.

Half his face was deformed, his jaw twisted as if it had been pushed inward and had nowhere to settle. The left eye was just a dark cavity, swollen around the edges, the color of an old bruise. The other eye stared at me, small and lifeless. His right shoulder ended in a rough stump, no arm, the torn shirt there hung like a morbid flag.

He stopped just a few steps from me, his chest rising and falling too fast, air wheezing through misaligned teeth.

"N-Noah…?" The sound came out almost childlike, like I had regressed years in fear and guilt. "It’s me, Jake."

The corner of the lip still intact lifted, forming something that might have been meant as a smile? But there was no warmth in it. He tilted his head slightly, his neck cracking far too loudly, the sound made me flinch.

The passenger clapped his hands, satisfied.

"Look at that… family reunions always warm the heart, don’t they?"

"Jake... I think we should…"

Maya started pulling me, trying to drag me back, but the passenger grabbed her wrist with a false gentleness. She widened her eyes, her chest heaving as he leaned in and whispered something I couldn’t hear. But the effect was immediate: she went rigid, her breathing stuck, and she let go of my arm like she’d been shocked. The man then guided her a few steps back, closer to the other motionless silhouettes.

"She stays with me now. I need to make sure you… cooperate."

I tried to move forward, to protest, but Noah jumped in front of me in a grotesque lurch, his torso bending too far, his foot thudding heavy on the cracked ground. His remaining hand grabbed my shoulder with disproportionate force, fingers too long digging into my flesh. He leaned so close I felt his breath: it smelled of rotting meat mixed with something metallic, like old blood. The eye that was still there studied me with a terrible calm, almost curious, while my knees struggled to keep me upright.

Then Noah spoke, his voice a mix of hiss and growl, forcing its way through broken gaps in his face.

"Come."

The hand squeezed my shoulder harder and I lost my breath, a hot pain radiating across my back. Before I could resist, he yanked me with brutal strength, making me stumble toward the car. The passenger watched the scene with a slight tilt of his head, his eyes gleaming like he was witnessing a carefully rehearsed show.

As Noah shoved me into the passenger seat I felt the full weight of what this meant. And I knew, somehow, that this still wasn’t the end. But it was so much closer to it. My last glance was at Maya, who was crying again now.

Noah started the car, pulling her from my sight. I flinched when he slapped my shoulder like he used to do, but now it hurt absurdly more. I looked at him again and that "smile" was there, more alive than ever.

"Now it’s my turn to take you for a ride, little brother."
