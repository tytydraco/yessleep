“It’s a sunny day here in California! Ninety-four degrees Fahrenheit. Hope all you drivers on Highway 1 are okay, it’s looking a little-”

“Jesus Christ, Katlyn. It’s been two hours.” Jessica didn’t raise her voice. She said it to the window, like asking the glass for a different answer.

“It’s a long road,” I said. “What - a hundred miles?” I did the math anyway: two hours at sixty… We should’ve passed Hearst Castle by now.

The radio came back, same man, bright as a postcard.

“-clear tonight along the coast, no rain, and absolutely no-”

Jessica huffed a laugh. “Absolutely no what?”

I tapped the dash. “This is why I still listen to the radio. People who pay attention get rewarded with-”

She held up her phone. “Zero bars.”

“Great.” I checked mine: nothing. “Okay. We still have the map. We’ll pull over before it gets fully dark.”

We didn’t pull over right away. I let the idea sit while the sun lost half an inch. Cliffs to our left were copper. The forest to the right had begun to turn that glassy blue where you stop seeing depth.

“Katlyn,” Jessica said. “Please.”

“Next turnout,” I said. “I just don’t want to-”

The radio interrupted, cheerful to the point of silly: “-miss those views, folks! Beautiful along the Santa Lucia tonight, and if you’re thinking of stretching your legs, don’t. If you get out of the car, you’ll die. Humidity ninety-eight percent-”

My hand tightened on the wheel. The tires hummed. I let us glide down into the next wide turnout and stop anyway, nose toward the drop, ocean working below like a machine we couldn’t see.

We sat a second with the engine idling. The AC made the soft cardboard flap sound it always made at three. I put the car in park and cracked the glove box.

“Is that legal?” Jessica asked. “For them to say that?”

“It’s… a prank.” It felt thinner than paper as I said it.

We wrestled the map out. Florida ended up on her shoulder. Texas bridged the console. I pulled California toward the last of the light on my side window.

“Let’s just use the hood,” Jessica said. “This is stupid.”

The radio brightened, as if pleased to be helpful. “Lock those doors! It is very close now. And for our Highway 1 listeners, wow, that heat is finally breaking, let’s get you some-”

Jessica flinched, then ripped the map, then stared at me. “What the fuck, Katlyn. If you paid for some stupid bit-”

“I didn’t.” I looked past her to the treeline. The gaps between the trunks were the color of a turned-off screen. There was a shallow opening about twenty yards in, a little wedge of a clearing, that felt like a missing tooth.

A pair of headlights came around the bend behind us. Light swept both mirrors. Jessica’s shoulders sagged. “Thank God. See? People.”

“Wait,” I said, but only because the word was there.

The radio dropped its smile into the same sentence: “-and if you’re thinking of flagging them down, don’t. Visibility excellent! Surf calm!”

Jessica already had a hand on the latch. “I’m just going to wave. Two seconds.”

“Jess.” I heard my voice and didn’t like how thin it was. “Just-just wait a second.”

I checked the rearview.

A face was against the glass. Not reflected - on it. Skin a primer white, pores erased by pressure. A nose flattened like clay under a palm. The eyes were too open, tracked red like somebody had been trying not to blink for a contest and lost. It leaned harder and the glass made a dry sound, a click like a thumbnail on a jar.

The dome light didn’t come on. No door had moved. I was frozen.

“Jess-” I said, but she had already pushed the latch. The passenger door sighed a few inches and the car filled with the temperature of outside.

“Katlyn?” Jessica said. She wasn’t looking at the rear glass. She was watching me watch it, and something in my face made her mouth change shape. “This isn’t funny.”

I swallowed. I didn’t know how to describe the wrongness without giving it more weight than the car could hold. The headlights behind us washed over again. In that flash, the face should have lit or shadowed, done something. It didn’t. It pressed. The ridge above the eyes made two pale crescents.

I reached across and caught Jessica’s arm. “Don’t,” I said. “Please. Just - lock it. Lock the door.”

She stared at my hand on her sleeve, then at the open wedge of night outside. The forest smell edged in.. dry bark, cold. The AC blew against it but didn’t move it.

The radio delivered, bright as a tour guide: “Doors locked make for safer travel. Keep those hands inside the vehicle. Perfect driving conditions ahead—”

The latch under my hand twitched. Jessica was stronger than I was expecting. The door opened another inch, then another, then all at once with that hollow car-door sound that eats the last of the cabin.

“Jessica,” I said. I wanted to say her full name like it could anchor her. “Jessica, don’t-”

She stepped out onto the gravel, one foot, then the other, shoulders still turned toward me like this could be a joke I would end. She left the door open. The dome light came on and made the interior look like a set.

The headlights from behind crested the bend. I looked up into the mirror.

The rear glass was clean. No print. No smear. No face. Just the ocean beyond it, and the long white scribble of a wave chasing itself along the cliff.

“Jess?” I said.

No answer. The open door looked at the trees. The turnout had that Sunday-evening quiet, a big empty that pretends to be safe.

“Jess.” I leaned over the passenger seat and looked out, across the hinge, into the blue of the woods.

Nothing. Not an engine, not a footstep, not the cheap clack of her sandal on gravel.

The radio, with perfect cheer, slid a new sentence in between jazz: “Hope all you Highway 1 drivers are okay.”

I waited for the rest of the line, the part that would finish my thought for me.

It didn’t.
