I used to be a journalist during the early 2000s, more specifically 2008. I had come across the biggest story of my career, possibly of the century. But until now, I wasn't given the platform to tell it, because I was scared, because they didn't want me to.

I think I'm finally ready to recount my time in a town that doesn't exist anymore, that no one wants to talk about.

It was April 17th when I came across a thread on a paranormal forum. I had been searching for my next story because, while I may have been a journalist during one of the most turbulent economic events in American history, so were thousands of other journalists. We were cannibalizing each other just to be the one to interview people about the dire state of the economy- well, not me. I was never a big financial reporter.

I didn't know squat about the economy or who to talk to except for everyday people, but that's not what the big channels wanted, and it isn't what local stations wanted either.

People wanted an explanation, a why, and then a what happens next. The steps we had to take to fix the mess we were all in. Frankly, no one knew what the hell was going on. No one had any answers, so I decided to get caught up in fantasy.

I had tricked myself into thinking there'd be some lead to follow on some phony paranormal board online, that people needed a refresher. That is, until I found something.

It was out of this world, I figured maybe the guy who posted it was some nutcase, who I could at the very least interview and spin a thread out of, something heartwarming and sappy about a guy finding comfort in stories, until I kept reading. Through the text, you could feel how shaken up the guy was, like he was recounting a nightmare more so than an event that actually happened to him.

Now, I could vaguely describe the story all I like, but I transcribed it. The original post had pictures, but I lost those files on my old laptop. I'd written down his experience word for word to annotate later. I preffered having physical copies of what I could, I guess it worked out in the end, helped me remember some of this stuff.

I didn't know this thread would lead me down a rabbit hole.

The post was as follows:

'Hello /x/

I was told to post this here by a friend, who said you guys might be able to help me work through this stuff. Cause If I try and bring this up anywhere else, people think I'm crazy. Maybe I am, but I remember that town.

I was going through a very rough patch in my life, but that's not what I came here to talk about. Everyone goes through hard times, and to be honest, I had it lucky.

I didn’t have anyone tying me down, and in my hometown, it felt like I was drowning.

I drove for a long time, going to backwater towns and staying at Motel 8's, eating bad diner food, and then rinsing and repeating. I still hadn't found whatever I was looking for across miles upon miles of highways, intersections, and street corners. It all felt the same.

Except for this little bar, at the edge of nowhere, I can't even remember where now, I think I was in-between West Virginia and Kentucky. In that bar, there was this strange man I ran into on a bike loaded to the brim, with odds and ends from junk food, to nuts and bolts hanging off wire, various articles of clothing, a few stacks of CDs, and boxes of ammunition jostling as he rolled the weary bike in.

I thought it was some crazy homeless guy, I half expected him to pull a gun from one of the canvas bags straddled over the sides of the main seat. He was a little taller than average. He was Asian and he had this blue bandana on like a headband, a striped sweater and over the sweater was a fishing vest. Lastly was this pair of tattered jeans, plus these worn work boots.

He had a grin painted across his face, nodding to himself as he rapped on the bar counter with this fat wad of cash, taking out a few bills and placing them down. The bartender got him a drink. The man piqued my interest, but I planned on leaving soon anyway. I was gonna coast into the nearest town and lie down in some bedbug-infested shit hole. Until he started speaking to me.

"What's the matter, you owe somebody money? Did you love someone so much that when they said no, it broke your heart? So you ran? Life getting you down, you got too much to care about?" Before I could respond, he put his hand up. "Listen, I don't care if you're running from the law, the altar, your spouse, hell, even god himself." He reached into his jacket and began to pull out this yellowed, folded-up piece of paper. "There's a place, not too far from here, that no man nor god could find you in. If you want to hide, hide here." By the time he unfolded the paper, it was clear it was a map, and he was scrawling directions. My eyes were darting, following his hand. At some point, he got off the highway and started cutting a trail through the trees on the map.

"Here I'm feeling generous, I'll even leave you the map." He patted my shoulder a few times before leaving me with the map, with these scrawled instructions on how to get to somewhere. He didn't even write the name down. Crazy Bastard. But where else was I going? I reviewed the map a few times and left a crumpled up five to cover the beer I had bought, leaving the bottle and heading out to my car. I put the map across my dash, and I considered not even bothering, it was probably just some homeless camp. Then again, it seemed remote. Maybe it was a farm or something? Logging camp? I thought of the opportunity of a secluded logging job. It's not like the next town was going to be any different than the last, at least this place had a glowing review from a crazy guy.

Besides, I had a gun under my passenger seat if things got dicey. It's not like I'd be rolling into whatever that place was with my pants down, so I started driving. At first, it was more of the same. His directions le me down a major highway for a while. I got off on an exit ramp a couple of times, just to top up my tank and to grab a drink or a snack. Eventually, the directions led me off the highway and onto a smaller roadway. Still big, but after about ten minutes of driving along it, I realized there wasn’t a single car behind me.

I only ended up hitting one town before I got off the last roadway the directions had me on. I filled up my tank to the brim and slept in town. Nothing was odd about that night; if anything, it felt like this place was calling to me, not in any insidious manner, I'm not sure how to describe it. I was just so desperate for a path, a reason, the way forward, that when something out of the ordinary happened, it excited me. The next day it was only about half an hour before I was on a narrow two-lane road that was leading me into the woods. The road was well-maintained, with the occasional rogue pothole, some faded paint. While more explainable on such a small road, it still bugged me that I hadn't come across another car at all. Not even parked by the houses that were sprinkled out here and there in the beginnings of a forest. There was no way everyone was out for the day.

Then again, some of them had garages, and I was probably just focusing on it because of the tension I was creating for myself, there was nothing out here. No diners, bars, or floundering tourist traps, just the occasional gas station. By the time the sun was going down, I was still driving, and I pulled into what turned out to be the last gas station until I hit whatever place that crazy guy marked on the map. When I hit this gas station, the road was pretty beat up, the gas station wasn't in much better condition. The attendant inside didn't even say anything after I paid him, he just nodded and flicked on the pump.

Driving this long had already worn down my senses, I was anxious, eyes darting around and I was driving slow. Ever since I passed the gas station, there were no more buildings, landmarks, nothing. Nothing except for when I hit my next turn, and I finally saw another car parked in a ditch with no one inside. It was strangely comforting, after the sun had set and only having my headlights and this dirty map to guide me, to see something that suggested there was still civilization calmed me down. It didn't last long, though, my eyes grew heavy, and I knew I was either going to have to turn around or pull off to the side of the road. But I had already come so far, according to the map, I was almost there.

After considering my options, I pulled off to the side, I hadn't even noticed I wasn't on the tarmac anymore. I kept my headlights on for longer than I needed to. The woods made me feel uneasy, like something was watching me just beyond my headlights' reach. Before I turned them off, I pulled the pistol I had from underneath my seat and put it in my lap before shutting off what felt like my only line of defense. If I hadn't been so tired, I might not have slept at all, it couldn't have taken me longer than five minutes to fall asleep. When I woke up that next morning, I gripped my pistol and practically threw myself into my passenger seat.

That supposed sixth sense was screaming at me that someone was watching me through the driver-side window. If I was any stupider, I would've blown a hole through the window. I don't know why. I've never been the paranoid type, but that night out there felt like someone had watched me fall asleep and waited there the whole night until I woke up. After getting out to stretch and calm down, I kept going.

On the way to the town, there were no landmarks aside from cars- so many abandoned cars. Not that they were stacked on top of each other or all off some cliff. But just when the last one left your mind, another one would be just around a bend or hidden by some poison ivy. Some of them looked old, like they had been there since the 50s or something. Others looked newer, doors still open, like someone had just stepped out to get their bearings, or stretch and they walked out and got lost. I was at a quarter of a tank when I started to get antsy. I should've been close, but with my gas drawing lower and lower, I was worried that that crazy bastard had just followed some delusion in his head.

If my car ran out of gas out here, I'd be fucked. I barely had enough snacks for the remainder of the day, a few bottles of water, but I'd have at least a day of walking behind me. Just to reach that last gas station. I was gonna just swerve around and fly back the way I came until I hit the tarmac.

I coasted for a while, mindful of my gas until I finally saw the sign over some rusty railroad tracks.

WELCOME TO ULYSSES GLADE.

It was about an hour before I hit the main part of town, I assume at least. I passed by a general store and a gas station that had the lights on inside. There were buildings before it, but they looked stripped, just the bricks, foundations, boarded up windows, and barricaded doorways. Not a soul in sight though, I was still antsy, I thought maybe I was in some sun down town, that the whole town was watching, waiting until I honked or stopped to reveal themselves.

I was partially correct.

I had hit this intersection when I turned to my right and saw people, these kids, or young men, posted up on yet another abandoned car. That is, until they saw me and my car. It was like they saw a UFO because they ran up to my car and started banging on it, cackling like hyenas. Thrashing my car back and forth, I could hear the shocks squeaking from their assault. One of them with a hat was yelling something like. "Welcome to the first day of the rest of your fucking life!" They all whooped and howled, rapping their hands on my car like they were trying to make a beat out of it. When they tossed a glass bottle, and I heard it shatter on the roof, I was going to reach for my pistol, that is, until I saw the flashing lights behind me. The light made the kids scatter like rats, all running off and laughing, as I was left with my heart pounding.

An old state police cruiser pulled up alongside my car. Killing its lights, the officer rolled down his window and leaned to his passenger side. I remember him saying, "Sorry about them, they're bored and like to give newcomers a hard time...I'm guessing Issac led you here? Said we'd be respite, or somethin' along those lines?" The officer shook his head as he sighed, rubbing his nose's bridge. "You must've had a long drive, I'm Sheriff Gualtieri. There's a diner not too far from here if you need to eat, but if you wanna get situated in town, you can just follow me to the station...well, a radio station, the police station got bombed out a few years back, and the state hasn't sent anyone." It was freaky, I remember not being able to form words at first. The state hadn’t sent anyone? On the one hand, it was plausible that the only way I heard about this town was through some homeless guy. And I barely made it up here with the fumes in my tank.

If the state wanted to send people out here, they’d probably have to send a fuel truck behind it, then they’d have to find people close enough to make the trip viable. That’s when it hit me to check my cellphone, I flicked open my phone, it wasn’t surprising but still unsettling. No bars, no service. I was already regretting not turning around and burning rubber as far back down the road as I could. Around then, I realized I hadn’t said anything, so I just nodded before saying, “Yeah, I could use a bite to eat.” I forgot how long it had been since I last spoke, my throat felt like it split when I spoke out loud. The sheriff was maybe forty? He had short, curly black hair, a strong nose, and no facial hair. He didn’t look like someone from out in the middle of the woods, and his accent wasn’t either, he sounded like he had lived in downtown Manhattan his whole life. He didn’t seem shady, just tired.

I followed his cruiser and we coasted through town to this little place called Waffle Hut, inside was a man who I had a short, mundane conversation with. Something about how he could use a dishwasher or a guy to help with prep, since he was the only one who worked at the diner, if I recall correctly, he owned it. His name was Sammy or something. I was only there for about an hour for a bite to eat before I spoke to the sheriff again, and he told me that I only had a few options for a place to crash, a married couple was looking for somebody to rent a vacant room in their home.

But I wasn’t sure how long I could stay in this town, yes, it was isolated. But I had tried to ignore everything that was happening, the bombed-out police station, those teenagers who were acting like it was the end of the world, all the abandoned buildings, the fact the state hadn’t sent anyone in years? It was a lot to ignore.

But looking out of that little diner, there was something about it that was serene. Forgotten by the world, it wasn’t bothered by the distress of the economy. It was a quiet town, in a tranquil slumber, like something washed over its residents, none the wiser to the outside world, and that everything would be ok. That and god the sunset it was gorgeous. This purple hue to the sky, golden rays shining through the thickets of pine trees.

I had decided my best option was the radio station, something told me I’d be safest behind some steel bars retrofitted in there, especially since the Sheriff seemed to live there too. In hindsight, I probably should’ve been more cautious. I knew nothing about this man aside from some vague guesses about where he was from, because of surface-level observations. In reality, I had known the guy for two hours and felt comfortable staying in a holding cell he could easily lock while I was sleeping. But I suppose I was lucky, when we arrived at the radio station, he was lax and told me that I’d just have to answer some questions for him, and then he’d show me the cell I could put my stuff in.

The questions were odd, though. He asked if I had brought any weapons, valuable metals, meat, or fuel. After that, he did a background check on this ancient computer from the late 80s or early 90s or something. He hit the top of it several times, muttering with a cigarette hanging loose between his lips, before one final smack seemed to yield the results he was looking for. He told me everything was clear and then led me to the makeshift cells. They were sturdy despite their DIY nature, I grabbed one bar and tried to shake it, only to find no such give. Sheriff Gualtieri laughed, and I shrank ever so slightly.

I had forgotten he led me here, and like a child, I had started pawing at the new environment. He said something along the lines of how some guy who lived out in the woods was a blacksmith, a welder, and just as he was about to prattle on, he turned to me, mouth agape, before chuckling. Apologizing, he just called the man a general handyman and how they could use more around town since constructing makeshift cells wasn’t easy, and if they ever wanted to repair the old police station, they’d need more men like him.

After that he went to his office and closed the door behind him leaving me alone in the hallway. I brought my bags into the cell, and set it beneath the rickety bed. I wasn’t tired yet, despite driving for most of the day. I’m pretty sure it was the lingering anxiety from last night, and this morning. That feeling of being watched, I was in a secure place, but it still felt like something had clung onto me and been following me ever since I came into town. I ended up cautiously exiting the radio station. The only light emanated from the moon and weathered street lamps that occasionally flickered.

I figured I might’ve just needed a breath of fresh air to reground myself, when I heard music, it nearly scared me before I recognized the lyrics, faintly like a ghost it trailed down the road. \`I’m a foool to do your dirty work…’  I laughed for the first time since. Since I had left home. The absurdity of vengeful spirits playing Steely Dan to try and corrupt my mind left me soothed, I really was just wired.

So in a bout of confidence, I made way to where the music was coming from. It was maybe a seven minute walk from the radio station. Before I came across a bar, the neon sign flickering open, it once had a name I’m sure, and then a name plastered over the old one, before presumably the townsfolk got sick of renaming it and just stuck with the name ‘Club Spin’. I made sure to look halfway presentable, despite knowing that I looked rough due to my restless sleep, it’s not like any stragglers I saw stumbling out looked much better.

Just as I was getting ready to step in, I saw something out of the corner of my eye, silhouetted by the moonlight. It was people on a hill overlooking the town, dancing. It was hard to make out the exact details, but one of the figures, one that wasn't dancing, was holding up a lantern. The three other figures spun and hopped past one another, a part of it seemed choreographed but occasionally one would stop following the movements of the others, and they would perform on their own.

I was so transfixed by the moment, it was only the sound of a few gunshots ringing out that snapped me out of it. I nearly fell over, my body clenching so tight I thought I had been the one who was shot. My head swung around only to see the muzzle flash emanating from the forest along with a scream of pure terror.

The scream cut through the night air like thunder, and the music had even stopped as the patrons of the bar came out, some stumbling, others nearly tripping, while a few came out armed, a hand gun or two, presumably the bar owner. A rifle in hand aiming at the woods before he lowered the rifle in frustration.

"Floyd we have to go-" "It's to damn late for that!" The man with the rifle, Floyd, said. "If you wanna send someone go get Johnny and have him bring home the corpse, none of you are going out- We know better. We're lucky if the gun is there by tomorrow." And, to my horror most of the crowd dissipated and just went back inside. Indifferent after the initial commotion.

I spoke before I could word everything properly. "Shouldn't- Shouldn't we tell the Sheriff!" I had run over to Floyd, a stocky, broad-shouldered, bald man with a bushy black and white beard. He looked amused, like I was joking, before seeing the horrified expression on my face. "Oh, you must be new. That old boy knew we don't go out after dark. If he listened to a siren, or had to take a piss that bad, he knew what he was getting into."

I couldn't believe what I was hearing. He had to have heard the same scream I did, and he was citing some bullshit wives' tale rule about not going out after dark? "That doesn't mean we shouldn't tell the police-" Floyd stared me down as he gripped the base of his rifle. "Boy, Sheriff doesn't operate after dark, and he sure as hell doesn't go during the night. Come on in here and have a drink."

My body felt like it was convulsing, and I wanted to throw up and scream at him all at once. The lingering fear of the scream, and the absurdity of not going out to save the man who was in distress, possibly dead. Certainly dead to these people.

I don't know what came over me then and there, maybe I finally found what I wanted. A noble attempt to go out on, a delusion that I could save someone from, that could save me.

I didn't realize how dangerous the mind was when it craved purpose.

I grabbed the pistol from my waistband. I had tucked it in my pants after the Sheriff handed it back over after checking it into the computer for some reason. I started going toward the woods, Floyd went to stop me. "Don't do it kid, you don't understand how things work around here." I didn't stop, and he quickened his pace until he grabbed my shoulder and yanked me back.

"You go out there, you're going to disappear, they won't even find the body." My anger was still present. I wanted to tell him off until I saw his face, a sickening blend of pleading and despair. As if he had been through this motion countless times, like he swore to himself that he would never try again, but his nature wouldn't allow it.

But my anger in the moment was stronger as I wrenched myself out of his grasp and began to ran into the woods.

When I broke the treeline, it was like passing an invisible line. Even my body realized it and the adrenaline thrumming through my body practically stopped, leaving me to listen to the woods. I was surprised by how quiet it was. Not that it was silent there was the occasional chirp, shifting of branches, bugs chittering. But it was the amplification of these noises that unsettled me.

Those sounds shouldn't have been that loud, when the birds chirped it sounded like they had just flew by my head, and the bugs chittering I could feel in the soles of my shoes, and when the branches swayed and groaned I thought it was going to swing down and hit me.

Despite being in a clearing, everything felt tight, I quickly reached into my jacket to pull out one of those gas station flashlights and clicked it on. I scanned over everything a few times and I ended up seeing nothing. I proceeded cautiously, pistol gripped tightly in my hand.

The guy couldn't have been that deep in.

Hell if he made any noise it'd sound like it was right next me.

That when I heard a thud, something solid falling down and landing on the moist ground. I swiveled and it was the man, he had a huge claw mark across his back. Probably a mountain lion or something. The man was older, in his forties probably, he wore a hunting jacket, green scarf, some jeans, and work boots. He had gray hair and a stubble.

But he was moving, writhing in agony. He turned his head and saw me and his eyes went wide. "G-Get out of here! It's right above-" Before I could look up, a severed arm fell down just infront of me, smacking against the ground with a sickening squelch.

I backpedaled and then my back hit something cold, tall, and solid. I thought it was a tree, when I turned around my light just at chest level I saw grey, pallid flesh. I fell back my hands were shaking violently and my flashlight illuminated the whole figure. It was humanoid, but it's knees bent backwards like a deer, it was slender, almost decrepit, you could see it's ribs outlined, it was like there wasn't a pound of flesh on this thing that took up space it didn't have to.

The worst part was it's head. It had hair, long black hair like a lady you might pass by on a street and do a double-take because all her hair hid her face. Not all of this thing's face was hidden, it had big eyes, pitch black though, like an eight ball without the white. It tilted it's head and studied me.

It was taller then me, seven feet tall at most. It had hands just like you or me, with nails that grew into sharp points, deceptively sharp no doubt given the damage on the guys back. In this moment, staring this thing down, it's hands caked in blood I took the only action that made sense.

Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang. *Click.*

It didn't even flinch.

The bullets hit it, I know it did, because it's body jerked like when a kid tries to shove you when they're angry but you don't move an inch. Nothing came out of it, no blood, no sounds, no pain. It just walked over and leaned down to look in my eyes.

I didn't even realize I was crying at the time, trying to shuffle away on my back, praying to whatever was listening. Then the man started screaming.

"AAHHH!! HEY!! AAAHHH!!! ITS ME YOU WANT! COME ON YOU FUCKIN-" I was looking at him, my vision blurred by tears before I saw the creature walk over and grab him by the ankle and start to ascend the tree. It's grip was limp, like it was barely trying as it lifted the man easily up with it as he swung his one arm to bash it's leg ineffectively.

"RUN! RUN BEFORE IT'S-" He disappeared just into the brush of the tree, and I scrambled to my feet and ran. I was moving as fast as my body would let me. But the distance felt so much longer, I couldn't have been more than 40 feet away from the tree line but it took me what felt like hours to get there.

By the time I came out of the woods the moon was still high, and Floyd was still there. Rifle aimed at the woods. "Fucking Christ! Do you under-" I blew past him and made way to the radio station. I got in my car, and peeled out. My gas didn't even register as a problem until until the sun started rising.

I made it out of the town, and back to the gas station all the way back at the beginning in a night. I don't know how. I don't know why my gas didn't go, I don't know how I didn't make one wrong turn. But I made it out.

I remember stopping at the gas station, under the flickering fluorescent lights and feeling like I was safe. That the manmade, artificial light was a shield. The moment the car stopped, it stopped, sputtering out and shutting off. I cried in relief, and just as I was composing myself, I turned ot look out at the mouth of the road that I was just spat out of of. I saw it, standing at the threshold.

It followed me all night, and all the way here, while I was easily pushing seventy the whole time. I didn't want to blink, I imagined it sprinting towards me and dragging me back to the woods, and back to the town...and I knew it was the same one, because it had a green, blood stained scarf, wrapped around it's neck.

To this day. I don't know where I was, or if it was real. I went back home and straightened things out, I got a job, and I just shoved my road trip to the back of my mind. I chalked it up to sleep deprivation, and hysteria.

But I don't know what happened to my gun, and sometimes when I look out into the woods I feel like I can see the sign just past a few trees. 'WELCOME TO ULYSSES GLADE'.'

Writing this all out has made me remember the town even more, everyone I knew, everyone I couldn't have known, and everything that happened. I'm very tired. I'll write more when I can. - VU
