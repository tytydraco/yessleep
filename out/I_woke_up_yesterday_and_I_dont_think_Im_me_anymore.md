I woke up yesterday and something was wrong.

Not like “I had a bad dream” wrong, or “I’m sick” wrong. I mean fundamentally wrong — like I’d opened my eyes and found myself inside someone else’s body.

Everything looked familiar, but it felt like I was seeing it for the first time. My room was the same. The same posters, the same dirty clothes on the floor, the same half-finished cup of coffee from the night before. But when I sat up, I had this sudden rush of panic — like I was waking up inside a photograph of my life, not the real thing.

You know how when you look at an old picture, you can tell it’s you, but it’s not you anymore? That’s what it felt like.

I tried to shake it off. I told myself I was just disoriented. Maybe I’d had a weird dream, or maybe I was still in one. But then I checked my phone.

The date said October 21st, 2025.

I went to bed on October 19th.

There was no 20th for me. I didn’t dream, I didn’t move, I didn’t exist. But apparently, I did. Because when I got to work, everyone said they’d seen me yesterday.

“You were quiet,” one of my coworkers said. “Didn’t seem like yourself, honestly.”

That phrase — didn’t seem like yourself — has been replaying in my head all day.

When I asked what I’d done, she shrugged. “Nothing weird,” she said. “You just kept asking people what year it was. Thought you were joking.”

The worst part? I checked my messages from that day. There are texts from me — to my mom, to my boss, even to a friend I haven’t spoken to in months. But they don’t sound like me. The phrasing, the punctuation — it’s off. I always type with proper punctuation, but these messages were all lowercase, full of ellipses, and some of them didn’t even make sense.

Here’s one I apparently sent to my mom:

“it feels better now. i see what you meant.”



She replied:

 “Honey, that’s good. I told you it just takes time.”



When I called her, she acted strange — like she was trying too hard to sound normal. I told her I didn’t remember anything about the 20th. She went silent for a long time and then said, “You don’t remember the hospital?”

Hospital.

That’s when I found the scar — a small, healing wound at the back of my head.

I don’t remember hitting it. I don’t remember anything.

Later that night, I found a note on my kitchen counter. Folded paper. My handwriting.

It said:

 “Don’t trust your reflection. It learns faster than you do.”



I laughed when I read it — nervously, the way you laugh at something when you’re trying not to scream. But now I’m not so sure it’s a joke.

Because this morning, I caught my reflection watching me.

I mean that literally. I was brushing my teeth, half-asleep, and I noticed the reflection was just slightly behind my movements — a tiny lag. Like a bad video call. I thought maybe it was just me being paranoid, until it smiled before I did.

I dropped the toothbrush and stumbled back. My heart was hammering.

When I looked again, it was normal. Perfectly synced.

I spent the rest of the day trying to convince myself I was imagining things. I even tried calling my doctor, but the number just rang and rang — no voicemail, nothing.

Then, tonight, I got another text. Unknown number.

 “You’re stabilizing. Don’t look too closely.”



I swear I hadn’t given my number to anyone. The message vanished after a few seconds, before I could screenshot it.

Now the lights in my apartment are flickering. Only the kitchen light — the others are fine. When it flickers, I swear I can see movement in the dark spaces between flashes.

I tried cutting the power completely, but the kitchen light stayed on.

Dim. Humming. Almost alive.

I went to unplug it from the socket, but there was no plug. Just the cord trailing into the wall and vanishing.

And the reflection in the dark window above the sink — it didn’t move.

It just stood there, staring.

I whispered, “What are you?”

And it whispered back, in perfect sync with my voice:

> “You weren’t supposed to wake up.”

I’m posting this here because I don’t know what else to do. My phone keeps freezing when I try to record video. I can hear faint whispers when I sleep, coming from somewhere behind my bedroom wall.

Sometimes they sound like my voice.

I think maybe I died on the 20th. Or maybe I was replaced.

If anyone out there wakes up one day and something feels off — if your pets avoid you, or your reflection seems to move differently — please, don’t ignore it.

Because whatever happened to me, I don’t think it’s done yet.

There’s something scratching inside the walls.
And tonight, I think it’s trying to get out.
