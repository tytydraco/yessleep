The clock read 2:03 am as I drove down the deserted road, the only illumination coming from the dim headlights of my car. The air was still and quiet, with no sounds except for the low hum of the engine and the occasional rustling of leaves in the wind. My mind was foggy, and my head throbbed painfully from the effects of the numerous drinking games we had played throughout the night with my friends. 

The inside of the car was stuffy and warm, and I could feel the sweat gathering on my forehead. I knew I needed something to help with the headache that was slowly taking over, so I reached for the glove box in a desperate attempt to find any medication I could get my hands on. 

I rummaged through the cluttered contents of the glove box, my fingers blindly searching through the mess, but to no avail. I cursed under my breath, frustrated that I couldn't find anything to relieve my pain. With a heavy sigh, I resigned myself to the fact that I had to power through the headache and continue driving, hoping that I would reach home safely.

As I drove down the winding road, my headlights caught a glimpse of movement on the side of the road. Intrigued, I slowed down and steered closer to investigate. That's when I saw her- a woman standing by the edge of the road, her silhouette illuminated by the dim glow of the streetlight. Her clothes were torn and ragged, and her face looked tired and worn.

"Huh," I said, my voice laced with suspicion and confusion. I couldn't help but wonder what she was doing out here alone, in the middle of the night, and in such a disheveled state. As I pulled over, my headlights now fully trained on her, she turned to face me with an expression of surprise and relief.

I could see now that she was indeed in her 40s, with lines etched deeply into her face, and her hair was a wild mess. Her coat was too thin for the cold night air, and her shoes were worn and scuffed. Despite her bedraggled appearance, there was a spark of hope in her eyes as she stepped closer. I could feel the tension in the air as I rolled down my window, unsure of what to expect.

"How's it going," I said, trying to cover the slur in my words. The woman's voice was desperate as she told me, 'My car broke down 2 miles back. I could use a ride.' However, as I looked around, I began to feel doubtful about her story since I hadn't seen any car in need of assistance on the road while driving. Given my hangover, I dismissed it as a false perception and didn't dwell on it. 

"Where you headed?" "Just to the motel down the street." Though I hesitated at first, I decided to let her in. The thought of leaving someone stranded on the side of the road was too much for my conscience to bear. I opened my car door and she quickly sat in the passenger seat. Immediately, I was hit with a horrible stench, like a rotting animal, causing me to roll down the window to alleviate the smell. 

As I resumed driving, I couldn't help but feel the tension in the air,  making every passing moment feel longer and more uncomfortable.  To ease the tension, I said, "How long have you been on the road?" To my surprise, she didn't respond. I glanced over at her and noticed that she was staring blankly out the window, her eyes fixed on the passing scenery. I repeated my question, but still, she remained silent, and her unresponsiveness only added to the growing sense of unease that I felt. 

Though uncomfortable, I continued driving. Seven minutes passed, and she still hasn't said a word. Just staring out the window.  I could see a motel about 4 miles down the road, so I asked her, hoping for a response, "Is this it right here?" Her voice was shaky as she responded with a "yes." 

I glanced over at her once more and was surprised to find her staring directly into my eyes. Shocked, I quickly looked away. I was at the peak of my unease at this point. I could hear the sound of metal coming from her direction. I quickly turned my head to look over at her, and much to my surprise, I could see that she was holding a pocket knife. 

I immediately stopped the car and tried to get out, but I forgot to unlock the door. I knew what was about to happen. She yelled while simultaneously slashing the base of my neck. Pain shot through my body as I desperately tried to defend myself from the sudden attack. As I struggled to keep control of the car, I could feel warm blood trickling down my neck. The woman continued her assault, her eyes filled with a wild, frenzied look.

Despite my efforts to fight back, the pain and blood loss were too much, and soon, everything went black as I succumbed to my injuries.
