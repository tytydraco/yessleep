"We are receiving word that up to 25,000,000 people may be infected in the United States alone with hotspots being New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. FEMA urges that all people stock up on food, water, first aid equipment, a battery powered radio, and a weapon if possible. We hope all citizens of the United States stay safe and healthy. This is Alexsis Corleone signing off."

"Fuck" I said to myself. I knew things were bad, but I didn't expect things to be this bad. My name is Jack Maxwell. I work as a security guard in a department store here in the concrete jungle known as New York City. As if things weren't bad enough here with gangs and crime as well as horrible transport and just general annoyances, now I had to worry about this disease? I used to work in FEMA a good few years ago and I have friends who still work there that keep me up to date with this disease that the news is calling "The Pale Flu". I was about to walk into my kitchen to grab a beer when the news came back on.

"My name is Mike Thomson and I'm here with fellow reporter Katie Williams. FEMA has requested that all people be notified about the symptoms, causes, and general information about the Pale Flu. The most common symptoms of the Pale Flu are headaches, sensitivity to light, rage induced psychosis, vomit containing blood, pale skin, and unnatural movement. The disease can spread through bites, scratches, and ingestion of infected blood. FEMA is working with the United States military to set up evacuation and screening zones. We will release the locations of these zones when FEMA announces them publicly. This is Mike Thomson signing out."

I took a sip of my beer. I really felt like this was becoming like that game "Left 4 Dead". I forgot to mention that I'm a huge zombie media fan.  I remember the first time I watched "Night of the Living Dead" with my dad and grandpa I got hooked. Thats when I started hearing screams and what sounded like growls. I looked out the window and was taken aback. There was this guy who was dressed like a normal crack head you would see in New York City which I'll start abbreviating as NYC who had leaped onto a guy walking down the street. He was... chewing off the man's face. Thats when the real commotion started. A bunch of cops ran from a truck and started to surround the guy. They were all dressed in what looked like biohazard gear. Then they just shot the guy dead. Didn't tell him to put his hands up or anything, just pumped him full of lead. I heard roaring and screaming from the opposite end of the street as a huge hoard of about 250 infected ran towards the cops. They opened fire but it was an 8 vs 250. They started retreating as mass panic set in. I ran towards the door and pushed a shelf in front of it in case any infected managed to get into the apartment complex I lived in. I ran into my room and opened my safe and retrieved my pistol. I ran into the kitchen and checked the pantry. I estimated I had enough food to last about a week. I knew shit had just gotten real.

\[One Week after the event known as the Mass Infection\] Okay so I've been held out here at mi casa. They stopped broadcasting the news on Tuesday, but I heard what it's like in other countries. Small nations like Kosovo and Luxembourg completely fell and Bulgaria declared martial law. Other places are just as fucked as here. I managed to have a little food left over after rationing it evenly each day. Most of the city is either dead or infected. There are a few gangs or factions I should say that are just trying to survive. There are some remnants of the NYPD and FEMA left scattered. The military is still holding up pretty well. A guy I ran into while scavenging said that the military is holding out in Staten Island. I'm planning on trying to find another place to hold out at since I almost got killed here. Let me explain. I was resting on the couch since that's where I keep my radio and there's a station that still plays music. I heard someone pushing the door open or at least I thought it was someone. It turns out it was an infected soldier wearing heavy ass armor. My pistol basically tickled the thing and thank God it couldn't run otherwise I would be dead. I finally managed to somehow knock its face plate off and shoot it in the face. I'm thinking of moving towards either central park or by the water since I've heard the military still has outposts there. I'm starting to pack my stuff now, so I'll update soon.

&#x200B;

OKAY HOLY SHIT. SHIT IS GETTING REALLY OUT OF HAND. I'm hiding out in a convenience store right now and I think it's safe to update. I came across what I think was a military squadron who almost shot me to death. I was talking to them when this thing just started charging towards us. This was no ordinary infected. This thing was 3rd stage infected. it was huge, built, and fast. It flung a makeshift barricade at us, and it decimated some poor dude. I started running as I heard automatic gunfire and shouting. I watched that thing throw who I think was a general at least fifty feet and splatter him on the pavement. He just splattered like if you dropped a water balloon on the ground. I think this store used to be some kind of safehouse or base. There is writing and drawing and graffiti on the walls talking about how the military is starting to collapse. Shit I think I hear something.

I just got grazed by a bullet. There are infected surrounding the room I am hiding out in. I wasted all my ammo shooting back at whoever just tried to kill me. There's no windows, no furniture, nothing in here. I'm surrounded by the dead with no options left. If I stay here, I'll starve, I can't kill myself or escape. I'm laying here with thoughts rushing through my head. This is probably going to be my final update. Whatever you do, do not go to the Central Park Alpha Outpost. It is overrun by both infected and gang members. The Dock Outpost is not safe either. The military is shooting to kill. Get out of this city if you can, the military is starting to destroy and barricade every entrance to this city and are gathering upstate. The moaning and noises of the infected are driving me insane but I have no way out. All I can do is lay here and pray. Pray for mercy.
