Hello, everyone. I hope you're all doing well. I'm back to share a bit more of what's been happening (you can read the Part 1 [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ajmti0/the_former_librarian_of_my_school_was_a_criminal/)) , and I'll divide it by days. The last time I wrote to you was on February 5th. After that disturbing day, things seemed to return to normal. I was alone in the afternoon of the 5th, as I mentioned, but nothing abnormal happened (fortunately). I continued my tasks in the library, helping students and organizing books (basically assuming it was just my paranoia).  
  
However, something strange happened last night (February 6th). It was late, I was almost asleep when my phone rang. The screen lit up with an unknown number. I answered, but on the other end of the line, there was only heavy breathing. I tried to speak, to ask who it was, but I received no response. The breathing continued, heavy and steady. In the end, I hung up, feeling a shiver run down my spine. Everything came back to my mind: the paranoia doubled. Was he letting things calm down? Waiting for me to let my guard down? I checked the doors and windows again and felt foolish for it.  
  
I decided it was time to investigate further. Honestly, I think there's no escaping this anymore, and all I have left is to delve deeper. But how? The files were scribbled on, and searching the names didn't yield anything useful on the internet. I returned to the library early today for work. I was doing the routine cleaning when, in a volume of "Greek Myths," upon opening (since I enjoy reading, both for pleasure and to familiarize myself with my collection), I saw on the page displaying the golden title 'Medea and Jason' a small folded leaf, slightly eaten at the edges with traces of moth marks.On the paper was written: 

*"Hello. I suppose you're the new librarian. Been snooping around my things, huh? It's okay, I'm not angry, but I'm sorry if you got caught in the middle of this. If you have no idea what I'm talking about, it's better that you keep it that way, just tear up this sheet and pretend nothing happened. Now, if you really read and saw that... well, I can't take any risks. I left more information for you in the archive. Just to be cautious, the lock code will be intuitive, okay?"*  
  
I stared at it for a few moments, feeling somewhat confused. Was she joking with me or something? Was it a riddle game, and did I find the next clue? For a moment, I was annoyed to be involved in this against my will, but... you know... human curiosity is a strange, seductive thing.  
  
I reached the school secretary, a guy who started with me, also young. Let's call him H.  
  
"Hey, good morning, H. I needed to look into the archive. Do you have the key to it?"  
  
"Oh, sure, did the principal ask you for it?"  
  
"Yes, they use it to store the books in stock, and I have to replace some," I lied.  
  
He shrugged.  
  
"Here," he said, handing me the metal key with its yellow casing displaying the title of the room to which it belonged.  
  
"Thanks," I replied, accepting the key with a forced smile. I was nervous, with that folded paper still in my mind. I only realized the folly I was exposing myself to when I inserted the key into the door. "What if it's a trap? What if it's not M who wrote it? What if it's..."  
  
The click unlocked, and the door opened. A slight warm breeze greeted me, carrying the smell of old paper and mold. The dim lights barely illuminated the place, casting dancing shadows over the stacked boxes and the two large gray cabinets.  
  
I began to search the cabinets, eagerly looking for any clues that could help me understand what was going on. Minutes seemed to drag on as I sifted through old, dusty documents, each page turning out to be wrong.  
  
That's when I found a drawer labeled "Personal Documents - M." My heart raced with excitement and apprehension as I opened it, revealing a row of folders. Several staff names were there, and I shuddered when I realized that, like the librarian, I also have a name with M... hers came before mine, so I wasted no time in grabbing it. It was locked by a small golden padlock, with space for 3 symbols.  
  
I confess I'm not a fan of puzzles, and it took me a while to understand what to put... I turned the gears until the front part of them displayed the initials: "C, I, M," then heard the satisfying click.  
  
I began examining the documents, hoping to find some clue about the strange events that were occurring at the school. Among the papers, I found a letter addressed to M, written in an elegant handwriting. There was a certain tone of mockery and veiled threat, nothing explicit, but at the same time, it was clear what it meant. A photo was attached to the letter, showing who I assume to be M, getting out of her car and entering her house. I almost overlooked it amidst the whirlwind of discoveries, but in the corner of the photo, I noticed a small piece of adhesive tape, what caught my attention, in fact, was a piece of colored plastic, a fragment of candy packaging...  
  
A pang pricked my brain, an idea. M also received candy, right? A date well before my arrival, at least two months... And if the letter M left for me, as soon as I arrived... I thought too late, as I heard the door creak behind me, closing.  
  
With my heart beating fast, I turned abruptly to face the closed door, feeling the adrenaline coursing through my veins. My first instinct was to run to it and try to open it, but upon reaching for the handle, I heard a sound: slow and deliberate steps echoed in the silence, as if someone were approaching cautiously, coming down the hallway.  
  
I know there were staff there, I know it was madness, but fear led me to the idea of hiding. It would be strange to explain what I was doing if it were a staff member, but if it weren't, and I were exposed... I don't know what would happen. I ran through the file room after turning off the lights and wedged myself between one of the cabinets and the wall, holding my breath as I felt my back scrape against the dusty surface. I tried to control myself, but the sound of those steps echoed closer and closer, in a threatening way.  
  
My whole body was tense as images of the crimes made their eventual retrospective in my consciousness, trying to imagine what would be the least bad end if I were caught. The minutes seemed like hours, and the oppressive silence was only interrupted by the sound of footsteps echoing in the hallway.  
  
Then, suddenly, the steps stopped. A shiver ran down my spine as I realized the person was standing right next to the cabinet where I was hiding. I could feel their presence, so close it seemed they could touch me at any moment. Slowly, I risked a peek through the crack between the cabinets, turning my head with difficulty, trying to see who was there. But the darkness was so dense that I couldn't distinguish anything beyond shadows.  
  
I stayed there, motionless, for what felt like an eternity, until finally the footsteps resumed, moving away gradually until they disappeared completely. I let out a sigh of relief, but my relief was soon replaced by a renewed sense of terror.  
  
Whoever was there, they knew I was in that file room. I may have escaped, but for how long?  
  
I exhaled the air behind the wall, hitting my shirt as I tried to shake off the accumulated dust, when the footsteps returned. Sped up this time, with no time to hide, I tried in vain to return to my place, but they were already there, had opened the door, I closed my eyes waiting for my end...  
  
"Are you okay?" H asked, noticing my tense expression and pale demeanor.  
  
"H?! Oh, yeah, I... I just got lost for a bit here while organizing the files." I lied, trying to keep calm, although my mind was still in a state of high alert.  
  
H frowned, seeming confused by my situation, as half of my body was stuck in the cabinet gap, but he didn't press the matter further. Instead, he approached to help me get out of where I was cornered. As he reached out his hand to me, I checked the open door, making sure the intruder wasn't there.  
  
I grabbed his hand, feeling grateful to finally get out of that tight spot. Once I was standing, H studied me for a moment, as if trying to decipher something in my expression.  
  
"You seemed scared. Did something happen?" He asked, his voice sounding concerned.  
  
"No, it was nothing. I just got lost in my thoughts for a moment." I lied again, unable to share with him the truth about what really happened.  
  
H seemed not entirely convinced, but he dropped the subject, leaving me to walk back out of the file room and closing the door behind us. I felt a shiver run down my spine as the click of the door sealed the mystery of what had happened inside.  
  
As we walked through the empty halls of the school, a persistent sense of paranoia settled over me. I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched, as if invisible eyes were fixed on me from all sides. Finally, we reached the entrance of the school, where H bid me goodbye with a wave before going his way home. I watched him disappear into the dying light of the sunset, feeling more alone than ever.  
  
"Hey, H" I called out.  
  
"Yeah?"  
  
"You didn't see anything strange when you went to the file room?"  
  
"Besides you getting stuck in the wall?"  
  
I gave a wry smile.  
  
"Now that you mention it... I smelled something strange. Today is the cleaning ladies' day off, and despite that, there was a smell of... ether, I think, alcohol in the air..."  
  
"Was that why you went to the file room?"  
  
"No... that wasn't it." He seemed to start remembering something important now. "Ah, yes, true, it was because you rushed past the entrance, I thought you were late for something and forgot to give me the key, so I rushed back to get it... and then I found you."  
  
He seemed confused, realizing what he had just said.  
  
"H... are you sure you saw me leaving?"  
  
"Yes, yes. I mean, I didn't "**see**" you, like I said, you (or whoever it was) ran past, I just saw it out of the corner of my eye, so I assumed."  
  
"Right... We need to keep a close eye around here, I feel like we have an intruder (I said, whispering)"  
  
He nodded.  
  
"I really need to go now. Shall we report to management tomorrow, maybe?"  
  
He said and went back to his usual path.  
  
I was about to leave the school when something on the wall caught my eye. It was a series of framed photographs, displaying the smiling faces of students and staff from the school over the years. But one photo in particular made me stop.  
  
It was an image of a woman, with dark hair and piercing eyes. There was something familiar about her, something that stirred me in a strange way. Her frozen smile seemed out of place... That's when my eyes dropped to the bronze plaque with her name: it was M. I had never really stopped to think about her face, looking like that she seemed younger than I expected, probably just over 30 years old.  
  
She continued to stare there. I didn't know what she wanted, and now, I didn't even know if it was her "talking" to me all this time. With a resigned sigh, I turned to leave the school, but a sense of determination bubbled within me. I was determined to find the truth, no matter what happened, and now that I at least had her full name, I was willing to demand my answers.
