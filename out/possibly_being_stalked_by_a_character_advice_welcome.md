Warning for animal death. 

I had a nightmare last night that went like this:

I was in my bed, in the dark and the quiet of the night. My bed's in the corner and I usually fall asleep facing the wall. In my dream, I had my eyes closed, not fully aware that I was "awake" laying in bed. I rolled over but squinted my shut eyes tight, feeling a bright light sting them. As I slowly worked them open, the source came into focus: my PC. It was sitting on my desk, fully on, brightness cranked up. It looked like there was a webpage on it, but when I rubbed my eyes and took another look, my heart started to pound in my ears. Dread built up in me as it became clearer and clearer in tortuous slow motion. The room was dead silent. I couldn't even hear the sound of the computer's fan.

On the desktop was a photograph of a dead dog. A horrible picture of a dog that had been dead for some time, parts of it turning black and green, laid out flat on the ground in a side profile. Its only visible eye was displaced from its socket, its stomach was finely cut open and dark with rot, the color of bacteria eating the edges of the skin around the wound. It was bald in many places, and covered with soaked, matted, discolored fur in other places. After a second I realized I could also see the other eye, a featureless meat marble laying in the grass near where the corpse's jawless mouth sagged open. Out of its disfigured, tongueless hole of a mouth, I swore I saw traces of pink that I understood to be earthworms exploring its body.

All I could do is roll back over and squeeze my eyes tight. Tears filled them and I shivered in my bed. I couldn't even think of getting up to turn the computer off. I was terrified of getting any closer to the picture, of seeing it any clearer, of seeing it move.

At this point in the dream, there were three knocks at my door.

Not my roommate. She was at work, and the person knocked in this rigid way and said nothing. I squeezed my eyes until they hurt, cowering into the wall. The knock came again, in the exact same way. I hugged myself and shook so hard it made me sore. They knocked again. I threw up in my mouth and swallowed it. They didn't knock again. Instead, I heard the handle turn, and I heard my door slowly creak open.

I woke up in the bleary light of early morning with a start, my heart pounding and my head in massive pain. After a long shower and some headache pills, I sat down and wrote a tame and sanitized version of this experience in my dream journal - but I did mention one revealing detail, that I figured would be of interest to my psychologist when she read it.

I wrote that I knew who was at my door.




I've spoken and written about this event literally hundreds of times; to journalists, to family members, to friends, strangers, dozens of times to my psychologist alone, and probably several dozens of times to my diary, but I've never typed it up for the internet before. I know reporters, journalists, news people who I could talk to and get an article published if I really had something important on my mind, but I'm here instead because I can't talk to them about what's happening to me now. I can only talk about this to people who earnestly believe in shit that's not fucking possible, which is you. Explaining the background is easy, that's the part I've relived literally thousands of times over the last decade, and I hope you'll forgive me if I go through it a little too quickly.

In 2015, a Boeing 737-800 flying for United experienced a freak engine fire while midair and failed to make an emergency landing, crashing just outside of Portland and killing 49 people, mostly passengers. It's not exactly a secret. The internet briefly fixated on this incident as a kind of ghost story, as the plane passed inspection before takeoff and the severity of the damage made it so the cause of the fire was unable to be determined, leaving the only verdict a kind of airplane spontaneous combustion - the likes of which haven't been seen before or since. Boeing settled with the affected families out of court for an unknown amount rumored to be in the ballpark of $150,000,000 - some of it went to my family too. It's been almost ten years now, and most people have forgotten, but I'll never forget. I'll think about it every day until I die. I wasn't even a passenger.

The plane hit *my* house.

I don't really want to talk about my memories of the actual moment it happened in any detail, but I'll say this: I saw it happen almost a full ten seconds before I heard it.

I was fifteen, and home alone (not exactly). My mom and her boyfriend were at a show for the evening, and I was in my room, playing Risk of Rain, which was my favorite game at the time. The family dog was a dalmatian named Louie, and I, in my craven, selfish ignorance, had banished him to the backyard because he wouldn't stop howling in the house. He was a very loud dog, very loud and energetic and friendly and excitable and needy and loving. He was killed by the impact, but not instantly. If I had kept him inside, we would both be alive today. If I had gone out with him, we would both be dead. Instead, he suffered for an unknown amount of time while I cowered against the wall, trapped by the collapsing roof. The point of impact where he was killed was only feet away from my bedroom. I was spared by barely two yards.

The experience left me with two diagnoses - partial permanent hearing loss and post-traumatic stress disorder. By the time the firemen found me, every survivor of the crash had been extracted, but most of the corpses had not yet been moved. Louie was crushed on his side under a collapsed part of the plane's main body, his head visible and his jaw broken by the incredible pressure with which his organs were forced out of his mouth by the impact to his torso. He was dead by then, but looked to me in that moment like he had lived long enough to see and taste his own lungs as they clogged his throat and spilled onto his tongue.

Jesus Christ. I wrote a little more than I meant to there, but I'm going to leave it. I dropped out of school. My mom tried to talk to me but when she couldn't she hired a wonderful psychologist who I've been working with for almost a decade. For a long time, I would meet with her and I would fixate on the most pointless details from that day. My mom going to see Love Never Dies. The frozen pizza on the counter that I never ate, and the strange way it looked after the accident, covered in dust and rubble, somehow miraculously standing perfectly straight up on a counter that was almost totally destroyed by the collapsed roof. Our enduring inability to figure out what was making Louie howl in the house, a habit he had only recently adopted which was giving everyone headaches. But mostly, the thing I fixated on was Risk of Rain.

At first I thought it was stupid, but my psychologist reassured me when I described the game a little more to her. Sure, it makes sense - Risk of Rain is a game that opens with the firey, terrible crash of the UES Contact Light. You play as someone who survived this disaster, and she told me that it made sense to connect them in my mind - the whole thing seemed like a "bad miracle". The crash, my extremely lucky survival, the game connection. But she became concerned in our later sessions, when I started describing the game in more detail. I spoke to her about *why* the Contact Light crashed, and what happened later in the game. I told her about the mysterious figure in the cloak and headdress who appears in the opening cutscene, teleporting onboard the ship suddenly and destroying the engines, inducing a crash that he hoped would kill everyone onboard. The figure that hunts the player for the rest of the game, stalking the crash site, looking to finish what he had started, to bring his blade down on the neck of any survivors he could find - to get revenge on them for their selfish and ignorance defiance of their fate.

I told her about Providence. Providence was the reason I couldn't turn the game on again. His face, which lacks almost any features, was just too accusatory. I couldn't even let the first frame of the cutscene play while I was mashing skip, I just couldn't bear it. I couldn't think about the game, I couldn't think about the crash, and I especially couldn't think about the gaunt alien with the crystal blade who haunted the wreckage looking for any "bad miracles" he could correct.

I had nightmares with this character in them for a long time, and she always made me keep a dream journal and discuss it with her, so we ended up talking about Providence a lot. I told her about how he was the Bulwark of the Weak. About how his mission was viewed (at least by me) as a type of divine punishment for humans who placed the value of own lives above those of less intelligent creatures. In my recurring dream from that time I would be hiding in my partially caved in room after the crash, except now it was the middle of the night instead of the evening, and now there were no firemen, no EMTs, no newscasters, no police. I couldn't see the wreckage from where I cowered in the corner behind the rubble, but intuitively I understood one thing: He was here. He had brought down the plane with intent, and now he was stalking the crash site, looking for any movement. Looking for survivors to kill. Looking for me. And he would find me if I didn't find some way to run, somewhere to go, some way to get out. Often, if I didn't wake up, this dream would progress until I heard him coming towards the house, dragging his large ceremonial blade behind him. I never saw him, because I had to roll my body onto the floor and play dead, pissing in my pants as I felt his presence in the room, as I tried to guess when he was looking away so I could take a breath that would make my chest move. Many times I would do this wrong and hear him coming towards me. I never got any further than that without waking up.

I had this dream several times a week until I was 18 or 19. A few medication changes and my first job kept my mind busy, and the event was getting more and more distant, and I had plenty of current things to worry about, and eventually it stopped happening. When I was 22, I found out through a friend that Risk of Rain 2 was now a real game (and had been for several years), and I brought this up to my psychologist with timid interest - hoping she would talk me into trying to play it (and she did). This was good progress. I actually had a lot of fun, mostly with bandit. But it wasn't meant to last.

Last month was when she brought up the idea of revisiting the original game.

She was very gentle with this suggestion, and it was clear that she had waited a very long time to be absolutely sure that it was an idea that I was able to process emotionally. With nine whole years and change between myself and the incident, and a renewed fondness for Risk of Rain thanks to the sequel, I cautiously accepted the idea. We agreed that, whenever I was ready, I would try it and make extra sure to document in detail any dreams I had in the following days. I did truly love the game, so even though I was afraid, I really, truly wanted to do it.

But there was something wrong with the game.

I live in another state now, and I have a much nicer PC. I installed the game on a Friday evening, realizing only too late the unfortunate coincidence of the time of day I was playing, but I went ahead with it anyway.

There was something. Wrong. With the game.

When I started it, I couldn't skip the opening cutscene. The prompt to do so didn't come up no matter what I hit on my keyboard OR my controller. Input issues probably, the game not recognizing something or other. But that wasn't it. Because the cutscene didn't end. No one boarded any escape pods. I watched, frozen, transfixed, as a version of this opening scene that I had never witnessed in my life played out. This time, I watched the ship entirely from the outside, instead of a cutaway view. As a result, I never saw Providence, but I saw his work. The Contact Light caught fire and spiraled into a nosedive and smashed into the surface of the planet right in front of me. The camera followed it all the way to the surface, and then remained on the burning wreckage as the fire tore through it and caused a series of explosions somewhere in the back that left the entire vessel looking unrecognizable. I still couldn't click any buttons. Panicking, I force quit the game and took a long fucking walk, trying to figure out what had happened. My first theory was that I had somehow, by some inexplicable and totally improbably means, installed the remake of the game instead of the original (a remake that I had never purchased) and witnessed an altered version of the cutscene made specially for it - quickly ruled out as you can imagine, although I was now too scared to watch the remade version of the cutscene just to confirm. I googled around to see if the cutscene had ever been changed in a patch, and found nothing. So what? A waking nightmare? I had heard of those but never (to my knowledge) had one. I wanted to walk for a long time, but the sun went down and I felt like I was being watched, so I went home. I felt watched there too. I didn't touch the game again that evening.

That night, I dreamt I was in my current house, but it was collapsed like the house in Portland, and the wing of the plane was carved into my living room. My house was full of people I didn't know, all milling around, chatting, like some kind of party. There were people in the backyard too. People everywhere. Strangers. It was busy, crowded, I had to push past people and excuse myself to get to my bathroom, but I left because there was a line for it. I didn't know what to do - I desperately wanted to be by myself but I was afraid to go outside, so I just sat in the living room, people shoving past me, trying to talk to me, asking me questions I couldn't hear, wondering why I was softly crying.

I told my psychologist about the dream and about the cutscene, which she had no answer for - after all, she didn't know anything about Risk of Rain other than what I had told her. She could only take me at my word when I said that what I saw should've been impossible, and she didn't bother trying to speculate. She only asked if I was going to try playing it again.

I was. I was tired of living in fear of a fucking video game character. I was going to pick another day, preferably in broad daylight and on a day when my roommate would be home, and boot it up again. It took me five days to work up the nerve. I played it at lunch time this time. My roommate was home, but she was asleep. I still felt better about it.

There's no more questioning it at this point. There's something wrong with that fucking game.

The same second I clicked the button to launch it, my computer froze, emitting a loud sudden shrill tone that almost made me shit myself. The tone persisted, ignoring my attempts to close the application, switch off the PC, and only ceasing when I pulled the plug from the wall. After recovering from a minor panic attack and checking to make sure I hadn't woke my roommate, I plugged it back in and restarted it. The game was actually *running* when I signed back in, which obviously didn't make sense, but it had successfully made it to the title screen. I knew something was wrong but I didn't believe what I knew. I tried picking commando and starting the game, but it was fucking wrong.

There's something fucking wrong with it. There's something so, so fucking wrong with it. What I'm going to describe isn't possible but I don't give a shit because surviving a 200 seat plane crashing into your bedroom isn't possible either.

I spawned in on Dry Lake, but in front of me was a chest that had no gold cost at all. I walked up to it and pressed the interact button to open it, and an item dropped out right on top of me and was instantly collected. It wasn't an item that exists in any version of Risk of Rain.

It was a rotted paw. Pixelated in the style of the game, green, with bone jutting out. The item's name displayed, but it was the name of the real game item - Dead Man's Foot. The description that popped up was new, though.

"I don't accept your sacrifice."

I uninstalled it after that and took another walk, dragging the block of lead that now sat at the bottom of my stomach the whole way. I walked myself nearly to exhaustion and made it all the way to the main road, where I stepped into a coffee shop and just sat on one of their chairs and didn't say or do anything for what felt like hours. Why the fuck should I try to rationalize it? My existence isn't rational. The story of my life isn't rational. He was making his point very clear. I understood it intuitively, like I was back in one of those dreams where I could feel his presence without ever seeing him. I understood it:

The transaction was declined. Somehow knowing that I was meant to die on that day, I had sent Louie to go in my place. The Bulwark of the Weak had come to Portland on that day to punish us, like we deserved. We've exploited our world, and the weaker creatures in it. He came to punish the people on that plane, and he came to punish me too. What I had done to survive had enraged him, and why shouldn't it? It was cowardly and pathetic. It was supposed to be me out there, and I sent an innocent dog in my place. Providence, maybe not the video game character, maybe the kind of divine force of wrath that the video game character was an attempt to explain/depict, had a job to finish. I think somehow, through reinstalling the game in my new home, through connecting to him via the game, I had given myself away again. He had picked up a trail that went cold seven years ago.

My dream that night was awful. My nightmares always start with me sleeping in my own bed for some reason - like waking up in the middle of the night before you're entirely aware you've woken up. This time, I shifted a bit, trying to figure out why I was uncomfortable, and brushed an itchy spot on my arm. When I felt the slime touch my fingers and realized my arm didn't feel them, I practically jumped out of bed. The light came on and I saw what was happening to my bed: worms. So many goddamn worms. Slimy pink earthworms. In my covers, on my pillow, under the mattress, on me. I panicked, squirming and brushing my arms and legs frantically, and worms came flying off from all kinds of horrible places. They must have vanished at some point when my focus changed to my window, which I couldn't see out of very well, so I (with some fear) hit my light back off.

There he was.

He was standing across the street. I could see his cloak flowing gently in the nighttime breeze although the unnaturally tall and skinny figure was perfectly still. I could see his headdress, set with gems, the mark of the hero. I could see the one "eye" that was formed where the two lines intersected on his otherwise blank face. I could see his sword reflecting the moonlight. He saw me too, because he turned the infinitely sharp blade back and forth with his wrist, catching the glint of the night over and over in a signal to me. A promise that I knew he was going to keep.

I was overtaken by terror at this point. I called work and told them I was horribly sick. I didn't leave my room for days. I was scared to sleep, to have another nightmare, but I was scared to stay awake too. Scared of the coming night, somewhere in the distance, when he would step out of the nightmares like he had promised to. Eventually my room itself became the locus of my fear and I moved to the couch in the living room. I turned the TV on and sat there for hours, dulling my senses in front of it. Eventually, something like 26 or 27 hours after my last nightmare, I started blinking slowly, nodding off in front of the television, but when I closed my eyes I saw Him. He posted like a portrait. He had that promise in one hand, and the severed head of a dog in the other, crawling with hungry worms. I snapped back to the waking world with a gasp that made me choke on my own spit, and noticed only a few seconds had passed. I made coffee and found a new channel to distract myself better.

Around sunrise, the morning news came on. I was still wide awake, and trying to invest the entirety of my focus into the top stories of the day. But I made a horrible mistake, because I saw something that I'm sure took years off my life.

At first, I was sure it was some kind of sleep deprived hallucination, but I have since confirmed that the story I saw was real. I can't believe they ran something like this first thing in the morning.

It was an update to an ongoing case. A local murder. Her name was Sherri something. She lived alone. At 10AM, her landlord found her dead in the house. "Deep penetrating abdominal trauma", they said, her house ransacked, signs of forced entry. Police were suspecting a botched burglary, but the wound was perplexing. I watched even though it made me feel sick. Maybe I knew it was building to something or maybe I only feel that way in hindsight. Either way, my entire world condensed into a single black point of space in the center of my vision when the news anchor added the very last detail to their morning coverage of the story:

The story was apparently "especially tragic" due to the fact that the victim was one of only a few documented survivors of the crash of United flight 5504, which went down just outside of Portland in 2015 due to a spontaneous midair engine fire.

My memory of the next few hours is hazy. My psychologist later described what I experienced as a "severe and prolonged nervous breakdown". If it weren't for my roommate coming home from work in the early morning, I'm not sure what would've happened to me. She drove me to my appointment at some point, but it wasn't until the afternoon, which is when my memory comes back. I told my psychologist about the murdered woman story but not about what happened with the game. This worked out, and she was very understanding and patient with me as I collected myself and occasionally stopped to sob in unusually short and sudden bursts. I told her I uninstalled the game but I made it sound like I had done it after I saw the news, not before. I admitted to her that I felt like there was someone or something that wanted to "tie up the loose ends" of the crash, and I even told her about my genuine belief that there was foul play involved with what happened that day, but I didn't mention any fucking sentient video game characters. She very patiently listened to my crazy talk and asked if I had any dreams in my journal to read for her, but I lied and said no. We talked about Louie a bit, and about my mom, and it made me feel a little better. I could tell she knew I was lying about not having any dreams, and she made me promise to come back next week with a filled out diary.

This is my filled out diary I guess. But I can't show it to her. I can only show it to freaks on the internet who believe in things that are obviously not real, the same person I have become. I'm writing on my work laptop from a hotel, now. I'm not going back to that house ever again. I don't give a fuck if my stuff is still there, or if my roommate is worried, or if anyone is worried. I'm never setting foot in there again.

Because I got up this morning, took my shower, took my pills, went into my room to get dressed, and realized that image of the dead dog was still on my computer. and it does move
