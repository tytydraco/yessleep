The last time I decided to journal my travels didn’t end well. I was hunting a demon that had the supernatural abilities to create life out of written word, and all the messed up shit I put down came back to kick my ass for months after that. Nearly killed me on multiple occasions, and I had many sleepless nights. 

I think it’s safe to say that the pesky little fucker got what was coming to him though. I thought it ironic to use my own word as bait, only to lure him into a paradox. It went something like,

“You will cease to exist once you understand why you cannot.”

You like that? I spent all day thinking about the best way to mess with him. Poor bastard tried to twist out of it, but you can't fight words when they break your own damn rules. He ended up comatose, loaded up in the back of my truck and thrown into the holy burn pit after that. Good riddance. 

Anyways, my shrink says I gotta keep writing things down and really “process” my thoughts and actions. I can then maybe identify what triggers my PTSD, and try to make some progress out of it. I don’t think he really understands the gravity of what I do. As long as I keep hunting, I am safe. The world is a safer place. It falls on me to keep it that way. 

So, I’m shacked up in this musty yellow motel room in butt-fuck nowhere typing out my “emotions”. As long as it helps me hunt, then it’s alright by me.

Butt-fuck nowhere is actually a special place called the Hoh rainforest in Olympic National Park. All kinds of god and devil given creatures alike call it home. It’s over 1,400 square miles of dense and mountainous terrain. Most of it is so remote that GPS and cell service doesn’t work at all. 

What I’m saying is, I'm very lucky to have narrowed my search down to just a small part of it. About 25 square miles is where my stage is being set here in Hoh. Hopefully it ends up being a good show.

It’s also one of the only temperate rainforests in the world. Meaning, it’s cold, foggy, and constantly damp. Everything out here is covered in thick sheets of emerald moss. They grow out of twisted and wound up trees under the cozy blanket of fog. Those wind-up trees are massive and ancient. Some even tower well beyond 300 feet. Their twisted roots and dense undergrowth make the forest a labyrinth with no real entrance or exit. Perfect for a little mouse like me to go and find my cheese.

The whole place looks and feels like a dream. Straight out of high fantasy. I’ve already done some preliminary scoping out of the forest to figure out what I’ll need to survive for a week or so. Camping out there is serene, but also utterly terrifying. It’s so silent, you could hear your own blood pumping, only to be broken up by the sounds of blood curdling screams. Cougars. 

Among the animals to look out for in these parts are of course bears. The aforementioned cougars, and maybe an elk if it’s got its balls twisted in a knot that day. But, the real big bad (the one I'm interested in) is responsible for centuries worth of disappearances and lunatics. I call it the Mnemosith. From “Mnemosyne,” the Greek goddess of memory, and “sith,” an old word for shadow, or parasite.

It’s an elusive creature that I suspect has some sort of memory warping ability. From what I understand of the research, it feeds off of the memories of its victims, sucking them of their life’s essence so to speak. Once your memory is gone, you become like a husk with a brain filled with holes. As if a parasite burrowed its way through your soft fatty tissue and left you to rot.

I talked to a young man last week who had an encounter with it. The only possible survivor from such a deadly monster. Every other account was just second hand descriptions of events. I can assure you that he acted like his head was swiss cheese, and he looked like it too. 

After the incident, he sure as shit couldn’t take care of himself anymore. His parents kept him in his own “room” in the backyard. It was a shed converted to a livable area, complete with a bathroom, A/C, and everything. They claimed that they couldn’t handle his episodes anymore and so I got the vibe that they needed the space more than he did. They looked tired.

They wheeled out a decrepit young man with a thousand-yard stare, folded in a strange position. One leg tucked under himself and left arm grabbing the back of his seat. He looked like the origami of pain. A collection of mobile bagged fluids and tubes littered around him. Some coming in, others out. He was gaunt and deathly. Head was caved in, a perfect concave lens around both temples leading to a sharp edge at the top where some wiry hair held on. I smiled and waved with smooth southern hospitality, but could tell my smile was just a bit too straight lipped. That slight grimace of acknowledging something terrible had happened to him and my sympathy couldn’t help but show itself in an awkward gesture. I hoped his parents didn’t notice and thought I was wincing, but they didn’t seem to mind. They gave me nothing but kindness. The sort of people that would take great care of their disabled child. Good people.

“Hey Eddie, my name’s Mark,” I said.

I reached over and touched his frail shoulder. He squeezed his eyes and lurched back in his chair a little, like I was threatening to hit him. 

“He hasn’t talked much since the accident,” said his mom. 

The father chimed in. “He doesn’t do much at all. Stares off into space, draws a little. He likes that one cartoon, you know, the creepy one with that weird pink dog-”

“Courage, baby.”

“Yeah, yeah. That one.” He looked solemnly at Eddie, then glanced at his wife for a brief moment seemingly from embarrassment.

I crouched down and got a better look at the kid. From what I’ve heard, the parents, Beth and Rick, went camping in Olympic National with their two sons Eddie and Ryan about a year ago. 

“So Eddie, you like to draw?”

He looked scared. Nodded his head a little. 

“Beth, could you show me some of his drawings?”

She took me inside his shed, which honestly looked better than my own apartment. It was pristine and clean. Very sterile, hospital-like. His drawings were black and white sketches of abstract nature. Some almost looked like chicken scratch. They were all pinned up on a corkboard past a drafting table set up to fit his wheelchair under it. 

Some of the chicken scratch looked like humanoid figures. Almost amphibious and wet, dripping with charcoal onto eggshell ground. One of them looked like a little boy, holding hands with a taller, more pronounced and thick stick figure. I heard the rattle of Eddie's wheelchair behind me, and when I turned around he looked me in the eyes for the first time. 

“Don’t trust what you know…” He slurred “what you think…” He took a deep and laboured breath. “Yourself”.

I don’t know what Eddie was trying to tell me. But I think, at that moment, he knew what I was at his home for. He knew what I was after, and I felt like he was trying to warn me.

They said that Eddie started to act irrationally on the first day camping. He would say the same things over and over. He would think he was somewhere he was not. He started to have some night terrors in the tent, then went out sleepwalking in the middle of the night. Beth got scared shitless when she woke up and didn’t see poor Eddie in his sleeping bag. She ran out into the forest, following the sounds of light thudding in the distance, and found Eddie bashing his head into a tree, over and over. The bark was stripped bare, and so was his head. Raw and broken. Bleeding all over his face. He turned and looked at his mother, woke up, and cried. He didn’t know where he was, or what was happening to him. 

That night was the single most excruciating time of their lives. Something feverish that punched my gut and made me queasy.

Beth tried to wake up her family, but she said it was as if they were drugged. They’d just mumble, Rick would say some profanities and something about leaving him alone, and they’d doze off once more. Meanwhile, Eddie was a zombie. Looking off into those damp twisted trees, eyes following each one in spirals making him nauseous. He wretched onto the ground, creating puddles of stomach acid until he dry heaved while his mom was desperately shaking and slapping her husband to wake up. 

“I don’t want to go! No mom, please! Please don’t leave me, please!” He begged her as she squeezed her eldst’s red stained face and promised him everything was going to be okay. 

Beth dragged Rick out of the tent to try and put him in the truck to take to the hospital. She had the right idea to get the fuck out of dodge, but it was too late. 

She says she swore she saw something dragging Ryan’s limp body in the dark. When she shined a light at it, the thing hissed at her and looked at Eddie, who started to attack his mom. 

He didn’t recognize her anymore, and screamed she was a monster as he brutally beat his mom half to death. She said she could hear the bones in her face crunching under the weight of his fists. Her screams and pleads for help were so loud it finally woke up Rick, who promptly restrained his son. 

“What the fuck! What the fuck are you doing!” She heard as she ran after the thing carrying Ryan into the woods. 

All bloodied, face smashed in and still in her pajamas, she looked through swollen eyes as the thing held hands with Ryan who was still only five, kissed him on the cheek, and let him jump off the cliff ahead of her. 

Eddie followed behind, passing her right by as she was still frozen in shock, looking at a real life monster that just pushed her little baby to suicide. 

He jumped off in one big leap to what was supposed to be his demise. She thought she lost both her babies that night. She thought she was insane. That’s what the police told her too. That’s what they told Rick, who at the time was folded like laundry at the foot of the truck by the hands of his deranged and empowered son. 

The thing looked back at her, and she swore she saw it give her a smirk. Reveling in her pain, just for a moment, before it leaped away.

The authorities found Eddie and Ryan’s bodies the next day. No one thought Eddie had even a remote chance of survival, but he did. He hung on that whole night and half a day, battered and broken at the bottom of a crumbling rock face, with his little brother’s dead body lying next to him. Nothing he could do. Nothing he could say to be forgiven. Just the pain. Just the sadness. Just the insanity to keep him company.

After hearing all of this, I didn’t know what made the young man mad. Was it the Mnemosith, or his own actions? But, Beth showed me a copy of his head MRI when I asked for it, and I saw for myself what the real damage was.

It looked like a worm burrowed its way through his head. Leaving it a messy art piece of collapsed bridges and glued together with sticks. How could anyone be alive with nothing but mush in their head? How could anyone keep living after they did such a thing? Thinking it was all their fault and had no one else to blame?

I couldn’t help but blurt out through gritted teeth, “this is sick.”

Beth looked up at me, finally with tears in her eyes and conviction in her voice. Stronger than any other sentence I heard the woman ever say to me. “You’re going to kill it. You’re going to stop that thing.”

Deep down, boiling inside me was a rage I haven’t felt in a long time. Something animalistic and profoundly human. 

“Consider the fucker dead.”

So, that’s how I got here. Out in the boonies of Washington, setting the stage of my next hunt. I plan on waking up at dawn, and heading to a fire lookout perched on a tall mountain overlooking the rainforest. I got my weapons ready, but something tells me I’ll need some better tricks up my sleeve for a creature that’ll wipe my memory and mess with my head. Something more than just firepower. I’ll definitely need to keep my wits about me. 

… 



The view from up here is amazing. Panoramic windows and deck give me the greatest vantage I can ask for. Although this being the case, dense fog and thick forest obscure the ground level where I can assume the Mnemosith is hiding out. I already set a couple of alarm traps in my vicinity, and made my presence known with a large bonfire I built at the base of the tower. The little fucker should know I’m here and I hope to God he’s hungry. 

I changed up my sleep schedule earlier on in the week so I can stay energized through the night as it is likely a nocturnal animal. Just woke up a little before sunset, and I’m enjoying some instant coffee on the deck. Taking deep breaths, and establishing a strong connection with my mind and body. If this thing is going to mess with my head I figured the least I could do is practice some meditation (something my shrink also wants me to do anyways). I don’t believe in hoo-ha nonsense like the spirituality you can buy at a supermarket, but I concur that the meditations do in-fact calm my nerves. 

My list is all checked off. Traps, weapons, food, water, shelter, transport, radio. Looks good. 

Okay. It’s time to find out what us little people are made of. 

… 



Apologies if some of this doesn’t make much sense. I’m still putting together the pieces of what happened last night. 

The sun was setting in marvelous glows of pastel tones arranged in warm colors that filled my body with comfort. I set down my mug when the final embers of the day vanished to reveal a night sky filled with the milky way. Like someone turned on the universe’s night light, it presented everything in just enough cool toned lighting that a flashlight wasn’t needed until the fog rolled in. 

I put on my backpack and threw the machete into my sling when I heard it. A loud bang, like a gunshot ringing out that rustled many feathers as a flock of birds got scared away just East of me. 

It could have been anything, but I had to go check and make sure. Climbing down the steps of the old rickety tower, I began to hear brutal screaming. The kind of screams you only hear in dire circumstances. Like someone was being mauled. Then another, and another. 

I was surrounded by the screams of what sounded like women all around me. I knew them to be cougars, but it was definitely some shady shit going on. It was like surround sound, all around my skull and off in the distance they were all curdling in fear. It made me scared too. I took a second to ground myself and started running toward the East. 

“Game time.”

Navigating that forest would've been impossible without my headlamp and machete. Still, progress was slow even with the paths I marked and cleared earlier. It was like the shrubbery had some magical miracle grow in them and they covered my paths just as fast as I cut them down. 

When I made it to my East trap, I was surprised to see that the trigger mechanism wasn’t pulled. The sly shit tricked me already, but I was prepared for a lure anyways. I hate the intelligent ones, because they always pull childish stunts like this, thinking they’re smarter than me. I may not be a genius but I’m good at what I do. 

I pulled out my hand gun, closed my eyes and listened… then the slightest rustle in the leaves jolted me back, I flipped around aiming through the iron and then… then I wasn’t there anymore. 

I was a kid. Back in Arkansas, and I immediately threw up in my lap from the sheer dizzying spiral of what just happened. I tried so hard to remember what was going on but it was like my whole life before that never happened and it felt like a dream to me. It got to a point that all I could remember was the mantra I said when meditating. 

“Don't trust what you know, what you believe, yourself.” I said in a rushed whisper over and over.

I was startled when I got a slug to the face in the middle of my rambling.

“What the fuck is wrong with you, Mark?” Said the man in the front driver's seat of an old Tacoma. 

“You little shit, you ruined my fucking car!” 

He threw more right hands at me until eventually pulling the car over to drag me out and started to beat me on the side of the road. The beating was a familiar taste I knew all too well. The salty sweat of a man I pushed back in my mind palace far far away from myself. My father. 

I tried to push him away but my feeble body didn’t have enough strength to fight back. I just ate every hit until a tooth cut through my bottom lip and I felt my nose crack and bleed down my chin. 

He stood up in a grunt and exacerbated breath. “Today’s the day Mark.” He took some deep inhalations. “You’re really fucking pushing me. I’ll leave you out here if you don’t suck it up.” 

He walked over to the truck and cracked open one of the Coors that littered the back seat. He started back over to me while swigging it, “Wachu gotta say, *little* man.” 

Still laying on that dry pavement, I spit a hot bloody loogie at his feet. “Fuck you, you *freak*.”

He got on top of me and really let me have it that time. Full swings and torn up knuckles driving my head into the pavement over and over. When I started to lose consciousness, I began to have flashes of me in the forest, and something else on top of me. Something slimy and wet, with claws and needle teeth.

That’s when I snapped out of it. 

I threw the thing off of me and was surprised to find just how light it was. About ninety pounds of gross muscle contorted and amphibious. It reeked of mold and decaying meat. The Mnemosith hissed at me and leaped away into a tree as I heard it bound across branches. 

“You scared, bitch?” I screamed in frustration. 

I let off a couple of shots, but none of them hit their mark as I was dizzy and tired. My equilibrium was off and my ears rang like a bomb exploded in my skull. 

It bounded away and I knew I had to go back to the tower to reassess and check the damage before it attacked again. 

The journey back was daunting. I stumbled all over the place and kept hearing my father in my head. Yelling at me, telling me things. Whispering to me to keep secrets. Terrible secrets. The one’s I’m in therapy for.

When I finally made it back I checked the mirror to find I indeed suffered a real beating. Broken nose, black eye, cut on the bottom lip. Definitely a concussion. The only new things were the small pin pricks nesting around my scalp. 

The monster tried to burrow its way through my brain just like Eddie. It almost got me good. Bringing my dad out like that was a real pain, and when I started to think of him my anxiety spiked. 

I shot up and cut down the stairs to the entrance of my lookout. Boarded up the entrance, then sat in a corner and took deep breaths trying to get rid of my panic. Ever since I couldn’t re-up my Xanax prescription I’ve had to just suck it up and deal with the panic attacks myself. When I finally started to feel a bit better I began to realize that taking away my only escape route might not have been such a great idea. But, in my mind at the time it was the only way to ensure I was going to be left alone. The only way to stay safe. 

I took some deep breaths in that musty corner and even ate a granola bar. It hurt like hell crunching on it but I had to chew on something. I heard that animals only eat when they’re safe so if you eat when you’re panicked then you could trick the mind into relaxing. This time it only helped a little. 

“Come on out Mark.” I heard from outside. 

I couldn’t believe my eyes when I saw dad making rounds about the lookout. He was holding an axe and was bigger than I remember. Wearing that same stupid hat and filthy plaid shirt. Looking like a goddamn lumberjack. His hands and body were still dirty and bloody from the beating he gave me earlier. 

His voice boomed with authority, “You can’t hide forever, little *boy toy*.” 

Shit. Panic mode was in full effect. That’s what he used to call me when… when he…

I leaned out the porch and with gritted teeth started shooting at him, but I was still just as bad of a shot as earlier and couldn’t quite reach him. The gun ran out of bullets so I ducked back into the cabin and began reloading when I heard thunderous cracks coming from below me. They shook the tower and threw me off balance knocking me on my ass. The bastard was going to take the whole thing down. 

Sure enough, the remaining legs couldn’t withstand the weight of its cabin and my big fat ass fell down with it. I saw the sky quickly revolve into earth and back again as I tumbled through the air.

The cabin slammed into the mountainside facing up but at a steep angle, shattering all the windows. The impact made the fridge fall from above me, crushing my left arm between it and the floor. I screamed out in pain as it slid off me and fell through the windows and down the cliff. My arm was twisted up, compound fracture through the elbow and nicked an artery too. Blood was gushing out three feet in spurts that were in sync with my heart beat.

I quickly tore off my shirt and wrapped it. That's when the cabin started sliding. 

The Mnemosith started clawing at the barricaded door above me. Cutting through the plywood like butter. It shrieked like a cougar and pounced as we both skii’d our way down the slope. 

Trees and rocks rushed past us, tearing up the cabin and splitting it into pieces like grated cheese. I rolled around a wall to avoid getting hit, but the damn thing kept coming at me with ferocity, swinging its claws around with no purpose or care. I managed to shoot it a couple times in the body and milky fluid bled from it like a punctured balloon. 

Smash. 

We made it to the bottom, and when the wreckage settled, all was silent. I stood up and through double vision and fog I saw my dad again. Approaching slowly with arms out wide. 

“You know I love you buddy. I love you so much.”

Hunched over, half dead, and completely done with that shit. I said, 

“You love me now?” and emptied the rest of my magazine into the filth. 

He doubled over and flexed back. Arching his spine into a bridge that melted the skin off and became his true form. A slimy, nasty, overgrown frog-thing. 

It screamed one last time, rattling its lungs out until slowly catching a hitch in its breath gurgling on fluids. It slowly died there, melting into the wreckage like bubbly acid. 

It took some time getting back to my truck. Even more time to drive to a hospital and convince the staff I was just in a car wreck. You live and you learn. 

I called Beth in the hospital and let her know what happened. She's ecstatic, and invited me over for dinner once I get out. I begged her to make me some cheesecake, and she did me one better to offer a ride from the hospital with Rick and Eddie too. 

I’ll be taking a short break from hunting to heal up and recharge. In the meantime, I’ll be taking any offers or bounties people have and setting up a schedule. My shrink is pissed that I missed my last appointment and told me “no excuses” when I explained the whole almost dying thing. He told me to just keep journaling and make sure to come back to the office once I’m out of the hospital. That guy. 

Something still bugs me though. When I first came down that tower, I didn’t just hear one cougar. They were everywhere… maybe just another sick trick. 

Anyways, till’ next time. 

Mark.
