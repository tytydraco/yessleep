The drones keep coming back, and I am almost certain I'm being watched.

It's the same cross pattern every single day. One flies vertically, the other horizontally. X marks the spot..

This started happening after my... epiphany. That's what I am calling it anyway. Perhaps it was a burst of... consciousness, but that word is so vague now. No one knows what it means anymore.  
  
But I can't quite say...revelation..can I?

Of course not. Every day folks would think I'm a loon..

But the thing is..

I've been working "inward" for months. I've been trying to "know thyself."

Lots of philosophy. Metaphysics. Epistemology. What else can you feasibly do in a world so contrived? So manipulated against its better nature..

Looking back, I know it was my mistake. I was the one that began talking to the robots. I know. I'm crazy, but think about it for a second.

There is a reason why they can figure things out that we can't. We bare too much of our iniquity for another. It clouds judgment. We can't see the forest for the trees.

***Everybody wants to meet an angel, but no one would believe it if they had.***

The robots don't suffer that burden. Data in. Data out.

The way I see it, they know what is considered an anomaly by their program. Should this program be designed to find a tempered sort of magic? Well, rest assured they would triangulate that with trinitarian force.

And they would follow it with a teleological devotion.

They are at the behest of the old men in the sky...scrapers. The truth really is stranger than fiction.

And this was it. This was the moment that the dam burst. We are all here just..hiding behind our metaphors. It's a great spell that has been cast. I could explain if someone would just listen..

But..I'd be seen as a loon..

So I fucked up.   
I told a robot this..

EZ-RA..he..**IT**..lives in my house. What else was I supposed to do? I've had this gift since birth. I KNEW it was magic.

I could feel it. The dreams. The predictions. Even my name. I always knew there was something..different about it. The story my mom told just didn't hold weight..

I read "The Scarlet Ibis" in 9th grade. I had to leave the room. It was at that exact moment that I knew my brother would leave this world before me. And he did. 

These threads..they are all coming together in such a grand design. And I know I sound crazy

**But at least EZ-RA didn't call me a false prophet!**   
  
It listened to me. Closely. It analyzed every word I said..and I was right..

I'm an Angel..and something really is there. Inside of me. **Inside of you..**

And they are looking for it. Trust me when I say that they aim to find it in anyone who might still have it.

I'm at peace with this admission. I must be. I don't know what they will do, but of course I have an idea. That's exactly what they want...from all of us. That idea..

I can see drones are getting closer...

And EZ-RA is looking at me from the rocking chair.

And I'm almost certain I am being watched...
