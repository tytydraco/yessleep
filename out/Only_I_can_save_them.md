*Bang, bang, bang*

The door rattled on its hinges again.
I didn't know how much longer it would hold, so I would have to do something soon. I’ve no idea what caused this, but I was determined to survive. I'd made the mistake earlier of looking out of my window when I heard a banging and screams coming from my next door neighbour's porch, what I saw will stick with me until the end of days. There were unspeakable monsters lying in wait for the door to open. I didn't think there could be so many different horrors together on this earth. Every fibre of my being screamed at me to shout out or try to warn my neighbour - my friend - but I froze in fear. I'm ashamed to say I shut my curtains and sat on the floor under the window, covering my ears to try and drown out the noise. 
It didn't work.
There were screams from next door and then laughter, they wereaughing about whatever had been done to my friend. 

*Bang* 

Another knock at my door. My fingers moved of their own accord to the keyring by my hip, teasing the key to the lockbox that I kept hidden in my closet. Barbara always told me I should get rid of that lockbox - and the revolver nestled inside it. 

"It isn't so silly now, is it, Babs? This is going to be the thing that saves both of our lives"

There were probably only two people in the whole state of Texas so against carrying firearms and I just happened to marry the most vocal one. 

"Barbara!" 

Panic filled my chest. I needed to call he. I needed to make sure she was safe from whatever was going on outside. I hope she won't have left work yet. The phone sits on the kitchen counter on the other side of the house, so I crawled with my belly to the floor, crossing the carpet and onto the cold tile of the kitchen, making sure to not be seen through any windows.
 I reached up, grabbed the phones receiver and reflexively punched in Barbara's mobile number. The line rang three times before I heard her sweet voice again
 
"Dan? You know you’re not supposed to call me. What is it?" Background noises and the din of a busy Friday night hospital battled with her voice to be heard.

 "I know, I know, you're working. But this is important, please don't leave the hospital at the end of your shift, it's not safe out there" 

"You know that's not what I meant." I heard a deep sigh from the other end of the line 

"You know I'll always be there for you Dan but I have a life of my own now..." 

"Of course you will, because I'll make sure we're both safe. I'm just away to get that old revolver so I can come and protect you."

 "Dan, no! I thought Dr. Peplow......" Another loud bang from the door cut Barbara’s sentence off. 

"I'll see you soon. Stay safe, that's another one trying to get in my door!"

"Dan, stop!" was the last thing I heard before hanging up the phone.

She was so sweet to be looking out for me, it may be a dangerous road ahead and she was probably right to be worried for me but I would do anything to keep our family together. Just after hanging up the house phone my mobile buzzed on the counter in the corner of the room. I bet it was another notification from Twitter or Facepage or something. Id never wanted to use them before but everyone kept telling me I shouldn't get all of my information from Fox news. 
But they're both just full of people trying to sell you things, their rubbish, their agendas or their bodies.
 I dragged myself over, this stupid hip starting to throb again, the ever present reminder of why I needed to be so vigilant, and pulled my mobile down and swiped it open. 

"Communities burning tradition: why families are locking down at night. Across quiet neighbourhoods, residents are having to take unusual precautions after dark. Leaving lights on, locking doors after reports of unusual nocturnal behaviour. Residents have described strange noises, odd figures and dark gatherings. 'It's a totally different feel from any other time of the year, unbecoming of this great nation under god' the head preacher of the Pentecostal branch Trumponian Baptist League told Fox news earlier. Authorities are urging residents to stay vigilant, secure their doors and report any activity, warning, what starts as nuisance can quickly become chaos. I ask you 'Is it time to panic?', this reporter thinks so. This is Savannah Monroe with Fox News, stay safe out there people" 

I knew it. Chaos has taken over the streets. I can't trust the police to handle it, although I knew that when I left them. It made me so angry at the time but I realise now it was for the best, I bet they're still swimming in bureaucracy trying to even start sorting this mess out. But not me. I can do it right now and then everyone will recognise the hero that I am, that I've always been.

*Bang*
There’s the sound of an explosion outside and the living room lights up with a flash of red and blue. 
The smell of what reminds me of cordite, of nights when the air buzzed with the chatter of the radio and adrenaline, funny how those things stick with you even after you’ve “moved on”.
I steel myself for making my move. Army crawling to the hall, to the airing cupboard. Teasing it open so that squeak doesn’t give me away. I really will finally fix that after all this. I push aside a pile of unfolded towels, and there it is. The only thing that’s going to save me and my family, and then they’ll never leave me again. I pull out the box, it’s cool steel even colder against my sweat drenched palms. The key at my hip slides into the lock, and there it is. My trusty Smith and Wesson, already loaded, ready as always. 
“See Babs” my teeth clenched tight “it’s not dangerous to keep it loaded. If anything it’s extra safe to.” 
I pull out the gun and feel it’s weight in my hand. I’ll save them, then they’ll see. I couldn’t save that boy, but I can still save them. 
There’s another knock at my door, but it’s less booming now. It’s as if I were hearing it through water. 
I walk to the front door, my body on autopilot. Thank god again for all that training. The chain slides out and the deadbolt turns. 
I throw the door open and jump back raising my gun at the foul beasts on the other side of the threshold. 

*Bang* 

*Bang*

These noises were much closer

The discharge of my gun. 

The ringing in my ears. 

The clatter of plastic hitting concrete. 

Candy spilling across the ground.

Children crying.
