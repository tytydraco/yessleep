A LETTER FROM MARK [REDACTED] TO RONALD H [REDACTED]

Ronald,

When Dad first left me the letters and tapes he told me that there might be a pattern he was missing, something to predict what’s causing most of it. While I don’t believe I’ve found a pattern per-se, I do believe I’ve found an indicator that could help us predict apocalyptic events earlier and possibly reinforce our own survivability.

I’d like to get permission to use the monitoring systems to take entropy measurements on various universes for my own research. I’ve noticed a pattern of more aggressive entropy growth in universes that have been ending. I believe this entropy growth is tied to the Veil tearing in our own universe as well, as some universes simply outgrow the pocket of space they’re given to exist in before it can grow with their regular levels. 

Another common thread I’ve noticed in apocalyptic scenarios is the Avarice Corporation. They seem to have their fingers everywhere when there’s a major world-ending scenario, and I believe their existence has something to do with the increased entropy growth. Perhaps their experiments or just mere presence in the universe is causing fluctuations. I would also like to put in an injunction to search all private business records in our universe to ensure they don’t have any kind of loose counterpart here. Call it a hunch, but I believe this could help save our asses in the future.

Thanks,

Mark

SCORCHED
Earth 38922
Case File of Mark [REDACTED]

11/13/2023

I don’t know that this is so much of a newly emerging event, but this Earth has been hurtling toward the end pretty quickly for a while now. A massive amount of manufacturing and drilling has destroyed their ozone layer, leading to increased UV rays reaching the surface of the earth. Along with this, there’s been a huge increase in Gamma radiation.

This has made the world nearly inhospitable. The surface is burning, with humans suffering intense sunburns from even the briefest of exposure to daylight. Stay out too long, and essentially the unguarded radiation cooks the human brain. This had led to a rise in those that are being called “Scorched” on their Earth, who turn incredibly violent after being in the sun for too long. 

Between widespread famine due to the burning of crop land, massive outbreaks of fire throughout the world, with wildfires even breaking out at the summit of Mt. Everest in the past year, things are looking grim. At least 1.6 Billion have died of starvation throughout the world in the past six months, and that number is only going up.

For those that haven’t begun to succumb to starvation yet, the Scorched are quickly becoming an even worse threat. These individuals have taken to stripping off all their clothes, running through cities and towns to find still living individuals to add to their numbers. They’ve been dragging people from their homes in recent weeks, nearly crucifying them up on wooden boards so that they become sun sick just like the others, then taking them down once they’re good and fried in the head. Assuming they don’t spontaneously combust in the bright light. The cycle of violence is never ending, and even perfectly sane people have begun killing each other over dwindling water supplies.

I give it a week.

QUEEN OF ROT
Earth 67349
Case File of Mark [REDACTED]

12/17/2024

Avarice really screwed the pooch in this one. Sent some probes out into space, typical exploration stuff, honestly not malicious like some of the other universes, but they found a whole floating city way out past the edge of Charon, one of Pluto’s moons at the edge of our solar system.

This place was just floating through the void, a seemingly abandoned, ancient city on an asteroid that was probably the size of our moon. The architecture was odd, irregular angles, tessellated buildings that looked nearly impossible for any living being to enter. It was something that Lovecraft would have had a heart attack and climbed into an early grave over if they found it when he was alive. 

Avarice ended up seeing that it was hurtling toward Earth at a rather fast rate, enough to get it here within a few months at least, and saw that it could cause some massive damage. Maybe their intentions were actually good for once and they wanted to stop it, maybe they just wanted to scrape out any secrets they could before the end. Either way, they sent some researchers to it.

I guess you could say we were lucky. Cleo, one of our Cognizant techs in Observation Division, was part of the research crew that was sent in that world. We got her to hook up to one of the headsets and piggyback with her other self, giving us first hand details on what went down.

They arrived a few weeks ago. Everyone in their atmosphere suits, ready to set out. Cleo was definitely nervous, and I can’t say I blame her. After seeing other versions of yourself die in horrible ends, it kind of takes a toll eventually. Still, she volunteered and said she was going to see it through. I kept an eye on her as they started to disembark, landing their ship on one of the more flat areas of the strange asteroid. As she set off, she described what she was seeing to me.

Walking around the city was like something out of a videogame. Everything seemed solid, structures surrounding them on every side, but for every point that looked like a door or window, there was some sort of barrier keeping them from going in. It looks like there’s nothing blocking the way through, but just an invisible layer of… something. When one of the scientists touched the barrier, it almost seemed to repel him, pushing him back though not with a lot of force.

After about an hour exploring the city, they found the pit. It was… definitely different. The edges of the pit weren’t rounded, it wasn’t like a sinkhole or anything, but a massive, carved out basin. Carved into the side were vaguely humanoid reliefs, faces twisted in terrified screams and hands held up to point toward the center. 

Cleo started losing it a little here. She said there was someone in the center of the pit, a woman, not wearing any kind of atmos suit or anything like that. She was just there, naked, body fused into the stone below as she appeared to sleep, hair floating all around her loose in the low gravity. 

The researchers all drew straws to see who would go down to investigate further, not that it would go very far anyway. Cleo was the one picked, and using some utility rope they brought along, lowered herself slowly into the basin, being careful not to step on any of the carvings as she stepped down. As she went though, she noticed that they weren’t quite human-looking. Many of them had at least six eyes, not only at the top of their face but extending down around their mouths. These mouths, open in screams of pain and terror, were shown to have long tongues carved inside, barbs on the end. Cleo tried not to look as the other version of her continued her descent, closer to the woman in the lower level of the basin. 

As she approaches, she notices that the woman looks different from the carvings, closer to us, regular, human. Cleo gets closer, watching as her sleeping face is framed by floating hair. 

Cleo tries to look around her, noticing that the stone growing up from the ground is encasing the woman from the waist down, pinning her to the earth. The rock continues up past her head, almost holding her like a throne that she’s trapped on. As Cleo does her examination, tracing fingers along the stone and noting etchings of runes in the sides, she accidentally brushes the woman’s arm.

She wakes.

Twelve eyes suddenly open all over her face, mouth gaping wide in a scream that somehow cuts through the empty void of space. Cleo in our world throws the headset off as the woman screams, holding hands to her ears as she tries to stop the frequency. 

It’s… it’s rare that anything happening in the other universes physically effects anny of us. It’s not like the headsets have a neural link or anything like that, it’s just like watching a movie from someone else’s POV. Cleo is broken though, the scream driving her insane as she starts muttering about angels and someone, I’m assuming the woman, named Lillith.

12/18/2024

Cleo has been carving runes on the wall of her room, though none of us can figure out what they mean. We’ve all tried talking to her, but she’s just… not who she was. She’s broken.

I looked in on my alternate in that universe this morning to see if anything new had happened. The floating city has sped up, speeding toward Earth even faster now. News reports say that none of the researchers have sent word back about what they found, but everyone is told that they should get underground as quickly as possible. It was due for impact within hours. 

12/19/2024

There was no impact. The city stopped right outside the atmosphere of Earth, throwing gravitational fields on their heads. The woman has grown large, breaking apart the city along with the entire asteroid that it sits on, revealing a huge network of nerves and veins underneath. As the rock breaks apart, it falls through the atmosphere down to Earth, raining debris on the humans who have so far survived the gravitational anomalies. Some get hit by the debris, dying instantly. That’s probably the most merciful death possible for them.

Those that are still alive start to become affected by the falling debris. Something about it gives off massive amounts of radiation. This in turn causes humans to begin wasting away, decomposing at a quick rate while somehow staying alive. The rot begins to work its way across the earth as the woman stays up in space, observing the decomposing world below.

The rot spreads quickly thanks to how widespread the debris is, affecting everyone within miles of a piece of it. Before long it begins to move to nature in the area as well. No organic matter is safe. Human, animal, plant, everything begins to decompose and rot. Those capable of movement and thought are left in painful states of decomposition, desperately trying to find a way to cure themselves or care for others as they rot away in their arms. It’s… it’s harrowing. 

My own duplicate in this world begins to rot almost immediately. I’m observing from the headset when my other begins to see his legs rotting away below him, leaving him unable to move as it works up around me. I was living by the sea, and as I’m trapped there I can look out my window towards the beach, seeing dead fish and whales washing up on shore, their bodies nearly rotted down to the skeleton. 

The last things I see through the fading vision of my duplicate is the Queen of the floating city coming down, the massive network of nerves and veins dipping into the ocean as she touches the surface. As she settles into our world, it appears that the nerves integrate into the Earth. Suddenly, my other can see flowers beginning to bloom from his decomposing body, roots coming from the ground below to take him over. She revives the Earth in her own preferred image, full of wildlife and flowers as land and rock begin to warp, tesselating into strange shapes while she sets in. There’s a brief attempt by governments to fight her, launching missiles toward her as she rests in the ocean, but around her it’s like a massive field of decay. The metal and components on the missiles rust, disintegrating into dust before they can reach her.

The flowers are beautiful. They’re the last thing I see before the headset goes dark, my duplicate self dying from the exposure.

That was the last universe that went through an apocalyptic event, so far. I’ve been scanning through telescopes and satellite feeds to make sure there’s no city floating off near the edge of the solar system, and so far there’s nothing. I’m going to keep an eye out though. 

Through everything, I’ve found Avarice all over the terrible events that bring other worlds to an end. Since then, I’ve been looking everywhere, making sure they don’t have any kind of foothold in our world. The Collective is aware of them now, so hopefully that means we’ll be able to stop them before they get any chance to bring this kind of evil here. I don’t know if they’re a multiversal constant, but they pop up often enough to be on our radar. 

The entropy investigation is going well. The guys in development are figuring out that the universes we see end are usually going through a massive entropical burst when these events happen. As long as we can keep an eye out on our own measurements, we may be able to prevent any kind of special circumstances that could lead to apocalyptic events here. It also might help cut down on the amount of tears we’ve been seeing Aberrations slip through, so that could help a ton.

If I have any other case files that might be of note, I’ll update. In the meantime, keep a close eye on your surroundings. We monitor a lot, but can’t see everything, y’know. If we want to keep our universe going, it’s going to take effort from [everyone](https://www.reddit.com/u/googlyeyes93/s/dIiFwQAhg2).
