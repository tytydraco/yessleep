# I don’t tell this story often. Maybe because part of me still doesn’t want to believe it happened. But it did. And if I ignore it… I feel like I might forget the lesson I learned.

That some things—some warnings—should not be taken lightly.

A few years ago, I was renting an old apartment here in the Philippines. It wasn’t much—just a quiet, lonely place with thin walls and an odd chill that never quite went away. But I liked it. It was home.

The landlady, *Lola Nida*, was in her sixties—a kind old woman who treated me like her own grandchild. She was always bringing me food, checking on me, pressing warm, wrinkled hands on my shoulder. She never let me leave without a soft pat on the back.

*"Magingat ka, anak."*  
(*"Take care, child."*)

It felt comforting. Like a ritual.

Then one day, she was gone. A stroke, they said. She was sent away to recover. The apartment felt emptier without her, like something was missing.

A month passed. Then, one evening, I heard whispers among the tenants.

*Lola Nida was back.*

I ran to her unit, eager to see her again. But when she opened the door, my smile froze.

She was thinner. Her skin had gone pale, her lips dry. One side of her body barely moved, like she was trapped in it. But her eyes—her eyes were the same. They softened when she saw me.

I stepped forward and hugged her. But she didn’t hug me back.

She just stood there, her breath slow and shallow.

Then, with great effort, her trembling hand lifted—just enough to *tap* me on the back.

I didn’t think much of it. Not then.

But after that, every time I left my apartment, she would do it again.

Her granddaughter helped her stand by the door, and as I passed by, she would reach out—shaking, struggling—and lightly pat my arm or shoulder.

At first, I thought it was sweet. But as the days passed, it started feeling… wrong.

She wasn’t just tapping me.

She was *insisting*.

Even when I told her, *"Lola, you don’t have to, please rest,"* she would *still* reach out.

Still tap me.

It was as if she *needed* to.

And then—she was gone.

She passed in her sleep. Peacefully, they said. The whole apartment mourned, but I took it the hardest. I felt like I had lost someone real, someone who actually *cared* about me.

Then the taps started.

At first, it was a single one.

I was leaving my unit when an old tenant passed me in the hallway. As we crossed paths, he reached out and *tapped* my back.

I turned, expecting him to say something, but he just kept walking.

The next day, another tenant did it.

Tap.

Then another.

Tap.

No words. No explanation. Just a light, deliberate *pat* as I passed by.

Tap.

Tap.

Tap.

At first, I told myself it was just their way of comforting me. That maybe they missed her too.

But then strangers—tenants I had *never* spoken to—started tapping me too.

Old men. Young women. Even children.

I would walk past, and their hands would reach out.

Tap.

Tap.

It was comforting at first. Then it became routine.

Then it became terrifying.

Because I started feeling… *watched*.

Like something was waiting for me to be alone.

One night, I saw Lola’s granddaughter standing outside my unit, her face pale.

*"Sumama ka muna sa akin."*  
(*"Come with me."*)

She took me to an *albularyo*—a folk healer.

The moment I stepped inside, the old man’s expression changed.

He didn’t ask me anything. He just started praying. Whispering words that made my skin crawl.

I didn’t understand them.

But my body *did*.

The air around me felt thick, heavy, like it was pressing against my chest. My head throbbed.

Then the granddaughter spoke.

And her words buried something cold inside my bones.

*"Si Lola… sabi niya, alagaan ka daw namin kasi malapit loob niya sa'yo."*  
(*"Grandma said we should take care of you because she was very fond of you."*)

*"Pero… nakita ka ni Lola na walang ulo."*  
(*"But… Grandma saw you without a head."*)

*"Ibig sabihin… hindi malayo ang kamatayan mo."*  
(*"That means… death is near you."*)

*"Sabi ni Lola, ang pagtapik sa'yo ang sasalba sa'yo."*  
(*"Grandma said the tapping will save you."*)

*"Kaya sinabi rin sa mga tenants."*  
(*"That’s why she told the other tenants too."*)

My breath caught in my throat.

Lola had seen me *without a head*.

A sign of impending death.

And the taps?

They weren’t just gestures of kindness.

They were keeping me here.

Keeping me *alive*.

The albularyo performed a cleansing ritual, and the taps eventually stopped. But I never forgot.

I don’t live in that apartment anymore.

But sometimes, in a crowded place, I feel it.

A hand brushing against my shoulder.

A faint pressure on my back.

And when I turn around—

There’s no one there.

At least, no one *I can see*.

And sometimes, just sometimes, in the corner of my vision, I see someone… *wrong*.

Someone distant. Someone *off*.

Someone who *doesn’t seem whole*.

And when I do…

I reach out.

And I tap them.

Because I know what it means.

And I pray it’s enough.

So the next time someone taps your shoulder—softly, deliberately—

Before you brush it off, before you turn around…

Take a breath.

And *make sure you still have a head*.
