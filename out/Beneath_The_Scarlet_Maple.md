I write to remember, or rather confess. Either way it feels strange since so much of my life I have only hoped to forget. I suppose I always felt he would come for me earlier, before the coldness of old age had put its hooks in me. Yet here I sit today, old, sick and tired of waiting.

The deterioration of my body has happened at a slow, nearly imperceivable rate, my mind however has declined much more rapidly. Most days I am still myself, others I am totally gone. Its gotten so bad that I have forgotten my own daughters name on multiple occasions. However, today I feel sharp and so I write. 

It was an abnormally hot October day and the sight of the rising sun above the treeline filled me with dread. I had hoped to reach my destination prior to its arrival but I had severely underestimated how taxing my journey would be. With each passing step my heavy legs burned, my breath was labored and the sweat had already soaked through my dress. My dearly beloved, who I dragged lifelessly behind me had seemed to snag his long limbs on every passing tree trunk, root or rock. His slender six foot frame  giving me even more grief from beyond the grave than he had while alive.

I dropped his ankles with a dull thud and wiped sweat from my brow, squinting through the thick trees I could finally see my destination. A winding stream divided the holler and in a small clearing near its bank a glorious Red Maple stood alone, its fiery leaves gently swaying in the breeze. Much of my childhood was spent dancing around this particular tree, its bright leaves remained year round even as winter left the surronding trees bare. Nothing else grew near it, not even a weed, the maple always stood by itself. I no longer lived near my beloved Maple, nobody did anymore, nobody does today.

I dropped my late loves legs one final time at the foot of its trunk and collapsed in exhaustion. I felt as though I didnt have the strength to stand, but my day had only just begun, I knew I must dig. I dragged myself to my feet and labored towards the stream to retrieve the pick axe and shovel I had stashed along its bank, but not before I submerged myself in its cool crystal clear waters. I emerged reinvigorated and took to the ground with the pick axe in a frenzied anger. I pictured my darlings drunk sleeping body with each violent swing. If only the ground provided the same lack of resistance his torso had to my knife, which aside from the occasional chipping of a large bone, had carved through him with suprising ease. The ground however stood firm.

I soon found myself exhausted again, the mid morning sun had already taken all the strength I had left, and I was barely a foot deep into the rocky soil. I again collapsed to my knees and wept. Strangely enough I prayed in that moment, I had never prayed before that day. I havent missed a day since.

"Please"! I pleaded through tears, my eyes fixed upward towards the Scarlet foilage that attempted to protect me from the suns scorching rays. I felt a sudden cold then, It always gets cold when he is close but I didnt know that then. I turned around rising to my feet and laid my eyes on him for the first time. His tall slender frame and long black cloak stood out against the green foilage. His impossibly wide sinister smile curled upward, contrasted by his handesome almost boyish features and piercing sky blue eyes. He always smiles but I didnt know that then. My eyes lowered following his endless black cloak down towards two bare pale white feet protruding downward. Never in 50 years have I seen those feet touch ground.

"Sarah Jean" he said warmly as he ever so sublty began to float towards me. "You look like you could use a friend". I felt frozen, but managed to sheepishly ask him who he was, he briefly paused and said simply: "yours". "You know I would never leave you Sarah" he continued "I would never get drunk and hurt you" he motioned towards the fly ridden corpse to my left. I closed my eyes, flooded with tramatic memories of the beatings I endured at his hand, "but thats all over now" I thought to myself. "It is indeed" I jumped, he was now directly infront of me seeming to cover a distance of nearly 40 yards in the blink of an eye. He was close enough to touch, and he did outstretch his pale boney hand towards me. I hesitated and then took his hand in mine, after all what choice did I have.

When I awoke it was a clear and quiet night, My eyes barely needed time to adjust as the moonlight brilliantly illuminating my surrondings: My dearest maple, a shovel and a pick axe leaned against its trunk, and below a smoothly patted layer of dirt where there was once a deep hole. My deceased partner was nowhere to be seen. I quickly arranged some leaves and sticks atop the dig site to hide the disturbed soil, and then set out shovel and pick axe in hand. Had it been a hallucination? Had the heat gotten to me? I assured myself it had, and that I alone buried him in some sort of daze. I believed it too, for awhile.

It started with visits in my dreams, his wicked smile startling me awake. He is always with me in my sleep, but he is with me always I suppose. He is the shadow in the corner of my room. He is the face in the crowd, the whisper in the wind. I always feel I am being watched even when I am alone. At first he was always far away but as I grow old and sick he grows closer, the wrinkles at the corners of his smile all to visable. I know I dont have much time left before he again reaches out his hand towards me, and I will take it again because after all what choice do I have?
