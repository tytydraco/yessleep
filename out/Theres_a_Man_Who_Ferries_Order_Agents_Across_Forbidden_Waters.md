Although the Order did tell me not to expect much from the dock, I was still surprised to see it empty. There were no guards, no checkpoints, nothing around that would indicate this is an Order-owned place.

There was supposed to be a boat somewhere around, with a person standing near it.

The waves slapped against the pier, splashing out droplets of water that fell on my clothes. My hands were inside my pockets, clutching the folded orders I got from the higher-ups.

That’s when I saw him. The Ferryman.

He sat hunched on an old crate, his cap pulled low to cover his face. His boat rocked gently in the water behind him. It wasn’t anything special – just a small, wooden vessel with peeling paint and weathered planks. A thing that looked to be centuries old, not cut out to survive storms. Though I had the strange feeling it had crossed many of those.

“You’re here for the crossing,” he said without looking up. His voice was calm, and demanded my attention.

“Yes.” I replied simply.

He nodded slowly, as if confirming a fact he already knew, then gestured to his boat. “Then get in.”

I hesitated, and glanced back at the empty pier.

“Don’t linger too much,” he said softly, almost as a genuine piece of advice. “The sea doesn’t wait for long.”

I stepped carefully into the boat, its planks creaking under my weight. The Ferryman untied the rope, and with a hard push, we were on our way. The Ferryman was told this is a courier job – a supply run, nothing more. But in reality, I was here for *him*.

I tried to keep my face neutral, but the instructions were running through my head and I couldn’t shake the things they’d told me.

This wasn’t a normal mission – but an *observation*. Into his work and methods.

Every five years, they sent someone like me to sit in this boat to confirm he was still safe. I had to memorize every motion, word and glance of his. Subject FERRYMAN was one of the Order’s “useful anomalies,” though they never used that phrase around him.

During the briefing I was also told about his violent outbursts, and why this mission was important. Twice in history, he turned against the Order. Twice, entire crews vanished – not a single survivor, recording or anything that could explain what truly happened.

Officially, he was just an asset for the Order – someone that would help Personnel cross and reach places difficult to access by ordinary means. But unofficially… he was an enigma.

Even I wasn’t told everything. Just that he’d been doing this longer than anyone in the Order could remember, and that no one – not even the Officer, though I doubt that – fully understood him.

That’s why there was a need for observations like these. To keep the Ferryman under their control. To keep him away from harming anyone.

“Long way to go tonight,” the Ferryman said suddenly, his voice breaking the silence around us. He hadn’t looked at me once since we left the pier. “Sea will get rough later on, but don’t worry about it.”

I wiped a sweat drop from my forehead and nodded, trying not to think about the second part of my orders – the part about an extraction team waiting a few miles offshore, ready to intervene if… anything changed about him.

The Ferryman dipped his hand briefly into the black water beside the boat. Then he sat back, calm again, and began steering us into the dark.

The further we went, the darker it got. The lights from the dock completely vanished. The moon was entirely covered by clouds, and soon there was no horizon that I could see – how the Ferryman operates in such conditions, I still don’t understand.

I checked my watch. 12:07. We’d been out for almost 50 minutes, though it felt much longer.

There was no chatter over my comms. The extraction team would be following us by radar, but they weren’t allowed to speak unless things went bad. Which, in some ways, actually made me more nervous than calm.

The Ferryman finally turned his head toward me. He was old, his eyes tired and dark. Although he wasn’t frail or skinny, he was definitely weathered. Which was to be expected from a mythical creature that is believed to have existed before the idea of the Order was even made up.

“You’re wondering how long I’ve been doing this,” he exclaimed.

I stiffened, surprised at the sudden comment. “Something like that.”

He smirked faintly and turned back around. “I don’t count anymore. I gave up after the first few centuries,” the Ferryman let out a laugh.

“You’re not the first to ask me that question,” he added softly, as if he was talking to himself.

The waves around the boat grew taller, slapping against it. I glanced at the radar screen on my watch, but there was nothing around. We really were in the middle of nowhere.

We weren’t following any lights, compasses or stars. The darkness swallowed everything around, and the Ferryman was guiding us through the endless ocean through sheer instinct.

After another silent moment between us, he spoke up again.

“You ever wonder why they send someone to watch me?”

I froze in place, my heart speeding up as my mind raced through all possible scenarios. Am I really this unlucky? Will I be the third incident report in the Ferryman’s subject profile?

I forced a calm tone and decided to reply with a rehearsed answer. “I’m not sure what you mean. I’m only here to deliver cargo.”

His smile widened. “Sure. Let’s go with that.”

The wind intensified around us, but the Ferryman didn’t seem to notice. I gripped the edge of the bench, trying to look like I wasn’t rattled – neither by the wind, nor his reply.

“You’re breathing too loud,” he told me.

I wasn’t sure if he was serious – did he already forget about me watching him?

“You’ll spook them,” he casually continued.

“Spook who?” I asked, my voice uncharacteristically nervous.

He didn’t answer. His eyes didn’t leave the darkness ahead, and his hand didn’t move. I began to wonder if he’d even spoken at all.

Another wave slammed into us, this one really hard. The boat swayed, and I instinctively reached for the railing. ‘Something’s wrong,’ my gut kept saying. ‘Notify the extraction team.’ But I resisted – in my mind, if I did that, the Ferryman wouldn’t hold back.

He leaned back slightly, his expression still serene. “You feel it, don’t you? She’s awake tonight.”

“She?”

“The current,” he replied simply, as if that explained anything.

“You’re very quiet,” the Ferryman continued. “Most people ask questions and I’m the quiet one.”

My mind went blank. Although I had dozens of questions I could ask, in that moment every one of them disappeared.

“I wasn’t sent here to ask questions.”

Again, he chuckled under his breath, shaking his head. “No, you weren’t. You were sent to watch me.”

Great. We’re back on this topic again.

I kept my voice even, this time a bit easier than before. “That’s classified.”

“Not from me,” he said, glancing at me for the second time. “You’re here because I’ve… misbehaved before. Twice, if I recall correctly. That’s what they told you.”

I felt my fingers twitch, and a chill ran down my spine.

He turned back. “They always think they’re so clever, sending an ‘innocuous personnel’ to deliver supplies.” He scratched his head. “Come on, why would they need a person for this? I can deliver it myself.”

Before he could continue, a streak of lightning interrupted him and illuminated the waves ahead of us for a brief second. And in that second, I saw something moving in the water. Something huge – larger than the boat itself.

The Ferryman’s expression finally turned from calm to serious. He sat up straight, his eyes peeled to the water around us. Although I was glad he took it seriously, I realized this meant we were in *real danger.* “Hold on,” he ordered.

Something moved beneath us. Some type of dark mass, large enough to rock the boat, glided just under the surface.

“What is that?” I shouted over the wind.

But the Ferryman didn’t answer. I think he couldn’t even hear me – his entire body tensed up as the large beast passed underneath.

Another surge hit us from the side, nearly tipping us. I heard the hull of the ship groan and screech, as if something massive had brushed by it.

Then, an unnatural silence swept over us. Not only that, but the storm passed, the waves subsided.

The Ferryman cut the engine. “She’s circling.”

Before I could ask who – or, more correctly, *what* – he was talking about, he followed up. “Don’t talk.”

I swallowed and nodded. That’s when I realized how ironic it all was: I was taking orders from a Subject. In fact, I trusted him – for some reason, I truly believed he would save me – save us – from whatever it was in the water.

The Ferryman reached into his coat and pulled out a long wooden pole with metal hooks latched onto it, and a set of bells that jingled in the wind.

But before he could do whatever it was he wanted to, the water beside us erupted. A slick, gray mass jumped out of the water – it resembled stone more than fish. I caught a flash of an eyeball the size of a plate before the boat swayed violently due to the waves.

The Ferryman didn’t flinch. He swung the pole in a wide arc, slamming the bells against the water. The sound was soft, almost beautiful.

The shadow recoiled, vanishing beneath the surface, but the water still moving erratically.

“She recognized me,” the Ferryman murmured. “That’s why you’re still alive.”

The Ferryman dragged the pole in a slow circle, letting the bells hum against the current.

“Down,” he whispered. Not to me, but to whatever that was that lurked below.

For a moment, the water swelled up again, and I thought something would breach and crush us whole. But luckily, they slowly disappeared.

Silence returned, broken by the words of the Ferryman.

“Keep still,” he said, his voice regaining that calmness of before. “She’ll follow for a bit, but she won’t rise up again tonight.”

I didn’t know what to say – do I thank him? Am I still in danger?

“That,” he said, looking at me for the third, and final time, “is why they send me.”

The storm finally eased as the coastline came into view – the coastline that the Ferryman was told to bring me to. He hadn’t asked any other questions about my mission – just guided the boat forward in silence. I finally spoke up.

“Why bring me here if you know about the true objective?”

He stopped to think for a moment as the boat entered a narrow inlet where the water was still. He cut the motor and let us drift. The boat’s creaks and the distant crash of waves against rocks were the only sounds of nature around us.

“This is where we part ways,” he said. “For now.”

For a moment I thought he was simply dismissing me and my question, but then his gaze flicked to his coat.

“They think I don’t know about the true objective of these trips. That I don’t know you’re watching me.”

He reached into his coat and pulled a small, rusted coin out with worn markings. He set it on the bench between us.

“Take this back to them in a bag,” he said. “And tell them it’s for the Officer. Tell them not to worry, as I’ll keep doing my work.”

I swallowed hard, my fingers hovering over the coin but not touching it yet.

“And,” he added, leaning forward, “tell them if they ever try to replace me again… there won’t be anyone left to ferry their people home.”

The boat bumped against the dock. I stepped off with the coin clutched tight in my hand.

Behind me, the Ferryman drifted off into the mist again, vanishing as if he’d never been there at [all](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThalassianOrder/).
