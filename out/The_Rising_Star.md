Against the advice of our manager, I have decided to keep all names the exact same as they appear in real life. No names have been changed.

I play bass in an avant-garde rock band touring with an up-and-coming rising star whose guitar solo has received 10 million Spotify listens within two years - as of this publication.

Our band was selected to be their opening act because they don’t see us as any sort of threat to their stardom. We also don’t see ourselves as a threat to their stardom so we all get along like very excellent travel companions.

My band is on stage right now playing a Jimi Hendrix song so very very badly.

A select portion of the audience is really into it. Most of our audience, in my humble opinion, is under the very misguided impression that we know exactly what we are doing. We do not know what we are doing but at least some people like it. Who are we to argue?

The show ends, the rising star takes the stage, the audience is thrilled, that show ends too, and now we are at a very very posh party to which my band would never have been in a million years invited to except that we happen to be friends with the rising star.

I slip out for a quick sangria with a friend.

When we return from sharing the sangria, we see that everybody at the party is gone. Just gone.

My friend and I check the time. The length of our sangria was not long enough to outlast what had a moment ago been a very awesome and lively party.

The furniture appears undisturbed. The ceiling, floors and walls appear also undisturbed. The people however are all somewhere else. I hope that they are not dead or worse.

Maybe they were never real and I have only been dreaming that I play bass in a band. I’m 95% sure they were real. I ask my friend about it and they agree with me - a moment ago, there really was a party happening right here. Look - there’s the fridge where we got the orange juice to make our sangria.

Well if the party’s over, we should get out of here. It’s very very late so I kindly offer my friend if they would like to perhaps stay at my place for the night, as the weather is not so forgiving at this late hour.

We agree that at least a cup of tea would be a good idea and we can see how the weather carries on after that.

The tea has been served and we are both enjoying the tea.

“Weird, how everybody just left,” says my friend in between sips.

“Yes, I think so too,” says me.

Mmmm.  This is very good tea, and then….

Vbrr vbrr vbrr. It’s my very phone.

I have received a text message from our manager.

Message reads: we are in deep shit and you need to get your ass here immediately.

I reply: no problem. Can I bring a friend?

The answer is no.

“Well you can make yourself at home,” says me to my friend. “I’ll try not to be too long. I have no idea what any of this is all about.”

“Ok,” to me says my friend.

So I get to the place by taxi and it turns out I’m broke so I get the manager to pay for me. Oh man it is awesome - way better than ever having to do an oil change at gunpoint.

The rising star is enough of a live attraction that people are paying $300 just for shitty seats. The manager has been very pissed at me lately. This is not the first time on tour that I’ve been broke.

Anyway, so I’m at the place and this very scary person who is holding an axe in one hand and a pistol in the other hand says to me, “you have ten seconds to give me one reason not to slice off your head and then use it to play croquet like in that album by Genesis where they do exactly that same thing on the album cover.”

I explain, “I’m with the band.”

The scary person tells me to keep my hands behind my head and they escort me down a flight of stairs into torture chamber where other people are waiting, each one tied to a chair.

My band and our love partners are tied to chairs. The rising star, their band and all of their love partners are also tied to chairs. The management personnel are also tied to chairs. The scary person pokes me with an axe in the solar plexus and instructs me to sit my ass down in an empty chair in between the rising star’s bass player and our manager.

“Now that you’re all here, we can get down to business,” says a person who is wearing a black hooded robe and I cannot see their face, though I can see that they are holding a remote control. “Everytime you lie or everytime we think you are not working hard enough to jog your memory, you will receive an electric shock. Observe.”

I receive an electric shock and I scream bloody murder. Nobody else receives an electric shock.

“...and if that doesn’t work, we will set you on fire. Any questions?” asks the figure who is holding the remote control.

“We’ll start with you,” they say directly to me.

I feel myself becoming pale. If they are not afraid to shock me, perhaps they are not afraid to set me on fire, either.

“No, not him,” somebody else says. “The person next to him.”

They are referring to the rising star’s bass player.

“If you weren’t able to play bass, you’d be out of a job. You know that, don’t you?” the hooded figure says to the bass player.

I empathize with the bass player.

“Tell us everything you know about the night with the Toyota Corolla,” to the bass player says the hooded figure.

Oh man, I’m relieved they didn’t ask me that question. During this month alone, I have ridden in at least ten different Toyota Corolla taxis and not a single one of those rides were remotely memorable.

“Um…” starts the bass player. For their sake, I hope the words they speak are correct and in the right order. “Well, it was me and um two prostitutes (yikes. I hope the press didn’t hear that) and we went to the pub next to the venue and I introduced them to everybody as my cousins.”

“Oh wow!” says the rising star’s drummer. “Now that I know they weren’t really your cousins, I don’t feel so bad about hooking up wi-”

Before the drummer can finish that sentence, I let out a blood-curdling shriek of agony as all the molecules in my nervous system feel like they are being stabbed with atomic miniature pins.

The sensation ends not a moment too soon.

“You got lucky,” says the hooded figure to the drummer. “That shock was intended for you. Next time, I won’t press the wrong button. None of you had better speak at all unless you are asked to do so.”

For a moment, nothing is said and somebody else who happens to be here glares at the bass player like a shark who has been born with a human face. The person with the shark-faced stare says maniacally to the bass player, “please continue your very interesting story.”

The bass player reflects before concluding, “then we locked ourselves in one of the bedrooms and what happened next, well that’s private but rest assured that no Toyota Corollas were involved.”

For a moment more, nothing is said until one of the hooded figures approaches the rising star.

“I’ve seen you before, haven’t I?” they ask the rising star.

“I’ve got a million of followers on Spotify. Maybe you saw me in a music video or something,” replies the rising star.

There is no reply.

Next to be spoken to is the drummer in my band.

“Tell us everything you know about the night with the Toyota Corolla,” to the drummer says the person with the human shark stare.

The drummer looks very nervous and panicky. “Well you see,” the drummer begins, “I’ve been blackout drunk and hippie-level-stoned literally every single moment of this tour - except when I’m on stage, of course, then, you know, it’s time to work - but yeah I’m actually stoned right now (I had suspected as much). If something did happen with a Toyota Corolla, I either don’t know or remember anything about it because paying attention is really hard once you’re out of practice.”

I receive an electric shock for a third time and for a third time, I scream bloody murder. Oh man the second time sucked enough already and this time is worse. Last time, it was only every molecule in my nervous system that felt like it was being stabbed. This time, it is every molecule in my nervous system and bloodstream that feels as though it is getting bludgeoned with atomic miniature pointed sticks.

“Why did you zap the wrong person?” somebody asks the person who is holding the remote control.

“Weird, that’s the second time that’s happened where I press the button and the shock goes to the wrong place.” “Here, let me have a try.”

After a moment of tinkering and some more testing that fails to electrocute anybody other than myself, they conclude that the remote control is malfunctional and that it will never shock its intended target.

“No problem, just get out the knives,” suggests another person.

“Wait, if we get to use knives, I want to go,” says a person with the sort of grin you never want to be up close to.

The knife expert gets to within awkward closeness to the drummer and says, “what about the Mazda 3? What do you remember about that?”

The drummer is very nervous as the tip of a knife rubs against an area not suited for the tip of a knife.

I am so glad it is not me being asked that question. At least four of my last ten taxis have been Mazda 3s.

“I’ve been so out of it,” the drummer says again, even more panicked this time. “I swear I don’t remember anything about anything. I don’t remember having ever seen a Mazda 3!”

Nothing more is said on the issue.

It is my turn now. The knife expert is within awkward closeness to my person.

“Tell us everything you know about the Toyota Corolla,” to me says the knife expert.

And before I can answer, somebody runs into the room, holding a dusty old book.

“I’ve found it! It actually existed after all!” they yell, referring to the old book.

There is a round of applause and based on what I know about old books, I am actually as stunned as they to learn that that book has indeed turned out to be real.

I happen to recognize this book from a Top Tenz video about the top ten most mysterious cursed books in history, narrated long ago by Simon Whistler. I’m sure you can hear him now: “hullo, I’m Simon Whistler, and in today’s Top Tenz video, we’ll be talking about The Top Ten Scariest Book of Curses Believed To Have Ever Been Written.”

According to Top Tenz, the book in question is a book of curses that dates back to the middle ages. The story goes that it was written by a monk who turned to witchcraft and escaped his execution by vanishing into thin air. As of the publication of that Top Tenz video, the contents could never be verified because no copies were known to exist but second-hand accounts spoke of curses for death, misery and lifelong pain.

“Try one out on him and see if he lives,” somebody suggests.

I go on to describe my most recent ride in a Toyota Corolla. It was a taxi ride that included a trip to the t-shirt store.

My reply is not to their liking and they read to me in Latin, occasionally throwing oils on my face… all is silent… and then nothing happens.

“Maybe you read it wrong. Let me try one,” says somebody else.

“Stop!” somebody else yells (I like this person). “You don’t know the forces with which you’re dealing!”

“Shut up,” says the other person in reply. They take the book, read at me in Latin and then cut off a lock of my hair..

All is silent and nothing happens.

“Whatever,” somebody else says. “Let’s just go back to the knives.”

Before they can ask me again about what I know about Toyota Corollas, the entire room ignites on fire and panic is everywhere. Everybody who is not tied to a chair, leaves the room, leaving all of us to die. A moment later, the rising star’s ropes catch fire and they free themselves. Following an excellent display of teamwork in the face of terror, we all become free from the ropes and hurry to the nearest exit.

The rising star’s manager is on the phone while we are all outside. “Yes,” says the manager. “Send firefighters, police, ambulance and clergy.”

We can imagine the voice on the other end confirming, “clergy?”

“Yes,” says the manager. “Multiple faiths if possible and maybe some ancient religion experts. They are going to want to see this.”

As the emergency services arrive, the manager dies.

If you’ll recall, I began this post by writing “against the advice of our manager…”. I wasn’t referring to this manager, who is dead and gone from causes unknown.

The police version of events goes viral in the news about how the rising star was kidnapped and held underground. The following day, the rising star is found dead. We are interrogated and then free to go about our business. The rest of the tour is cancelled so we return home.

\*\*\*\*\*\*

At last, home sweet home. I reach into my pocket and feel the never-forgotten sensation of security in touching my house key and knowing that even during my shittiest of shitty moments, I have a roof over my head and that is better than no roof at all.

I remove the key from my pocket and place it in the never-forgotten lock of my never-forgotten door. So far, nothing looks out of place from how I left it. Sitting on my comfy chair, is the rising star.

For a moment I want to scream but then think better of it. I wonder what this person has to say and why it is that they resemble the rising star, who I saw with my own eyes to be dead.

“I’m a ghost, in case you were wondering,” to me says this person who claims to be a dead person. “I can prove it, too. Think of a number between 42 and 9000. Is it 42? (wow. It IS 42) Haha, I knew it. What else? Oh. Get me a guitar.”

I am flabbergasted. This is not at all what I thought how I thought my evening would go following my return from the road.

“Um. Here,” says me, offering my best guitar.

Ok…

It is a new song but only a song that could have come from the shining flame of the burning mind of the rising star.

I am convinced that they are who they say they are, the ghost of the rising star.

I am a little terrified, though certainly not as terrified as when I received those electric shocks. THAT was terrifying.

I will go on to have recurring nightmares and occasional phantom pains since that horrible repugnant sensation of frequent electrocution. People suggest therapy but I’d rather write about it on the internet instead. I’m sure you’d agree it’s better than doing nothing at all.

“I was murdered,” to me says the ghost of the rising star. “It was the people wearing the hoods who electrocuted you all those times. When they read from the book of curses, spritzed you with oil and cut off your hair, it wasn’t to curse you, it was to curse me. Being a ghost is part of the curse.”

Wow. That is a lot to think about.

“It gets worse for you,” says the ghost of the rising star. “Your hair is all over the murder weapon. Of course, I know it wasn’t you and that it was really those hooded jerks but the cops don’t know that. I would tell them myself, but for ghost reasons, I’m not able to. At least not for now.”

“What should I do?” I ask.

“Get out of here immediately,” says the vanishing ghost of the rising star, and I do exactly that. I double check that I’ve got what I need in my pockets, dress appropriately, and leave, locking the door behind me, taking the stairs to the back exit and walking to the nearest pub to think over my next move.

I sit in a casual corner, nursing a lager.

A moment later, there is this loud kaboom sound and it turns out my building has just caught fire. Another moment later, the police arrest me.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

They let me go for the time being but man oh man did it ever lt look bad from every angle. My hair was found on the murder weapon then my apartment building just happened to catch fire while I happened to have walked away from the building only a minute before the fire commenced.

“What was your hair doing on the weapon?” they had asked me.

“We’ve spent the past month touring together. We’ve probably all got each other's hairs on each other's things,” I had answered.

“Fine,” they had eventually said to me, “but if we ever prove it was you, you will be behind bars probably for the rest of your life.”

Very scary indeed. I do not want to go to jail nor prison.

They end up being correct for the time being. I got a job as a bartender at two different bars. I work behind bars.

POST SCRIPT

The drummer’s love partner died while I typed this and their family has asked that the circumstances of their death should remain private.
