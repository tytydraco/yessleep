Hi everyone, I want to start by apologizing for my not-so-great English, it's not my first language so, you know, sorry in advance.  
  
As the title says, three days ago, I escaped from my home. My family, which is composed of me, my parents and my 8 brothers and sisters, lives in what I think is a pretty big house in the countryside, I don’t really know what’s the usual size for a house.   
None of us ever really left the area around our house, which is mostly plains, woods, and, if you walk enough, one road. We have plantations of vegetables that we eat, and our father goes out of the area with our only car to get some meat.  
  
  
Our parents are always loving and affectionate, we play games together, mostly hide and seek, which is fun, we watch movies and shows together (I now realize, seeing everything on the internet, that these are pretty old shows I think). They are also teaching us at home and they encourage us to be curious and ask questions about animals, nature, plants and everything. There is, however, one topic that they don’t want us to ask too much about: the rest of the world. They don’t get angry or upset when we do ask questions about it, but they are way less enthusiastic and their answers are not very developed. They keep telling us that what they told us about the world is all we need to know about it.   
  
This is how they describe it : The world is sad, it’s full of people who hate each other, nobody’s really nice, and those who seem to be are only doing it to get something out of you. There is no fun in the world, no games, and you must work your whole life in big buildings called “factories”. You start as a child and do it until you die, usually in your fifties because the world is unhealthy and dangerous. They tell us that they keep us in the house and the woods to protect us, because the people in the rest of the world would hate us and try to harm us. They said that they once lived there but chose to stay away from it forever.  
  
To be honest, this description of the world always scared us, we were happy to be safe.  
  
Now, there is one thing that always scared me personally, I don’t know about my brothers and sisters, but this scared me. Our parents called it “Le Passage”. They say it’s important and one of the best experiences we’ll ever have. We don’t know much about it, it’s something that happens at night, the night of your 17th birthday. Mom and Dad come to wake you up and you go with them somewhere outside of the house. They come back with you like, an hour later and t-you sleep on the couch of the living room for the rest of this night.   
My older brother, Vincent, who’s now 20 years old, and my older sister, Marie, who’s 18 years old, both had to do it. They obviously never told us what happened that night, no matter how much we asked them, but both seemed a bit off the next few days following. They eventually both got back to normal.   
  
Not much was different, about them, Marie was still the funny older sister I always knew, Vincent stayed pretty much the same too. The few things that did change are these:   
\-	They don’t learn with us anymore, they work on the plantations with Dad or help with other stuff during learning time.  
\-	They don’t sleep with us in the dorm room, they have a room for them.   
\-	They couldn’t play Hide and seek with us  
\-	They sometimes still feel a bit sad, more often than before.  
\-	During our free time, they tend to spend a lot of their time together, just talking.  
  
So now, what made me leave. I am 16 years old, and tomorrow, I’m turning 17. So the few weeks before I escape were pretty stressful for me. All my younger brothers and sisters were teasing me about me becoming a “Grown up” and my parents were also very excited, but me, I was scared. I didn’t know what to expect, and that was just terrifying.   
  
So, the day before I leave, during free time, I went to Marie, and asked her for the 100th time what was happening during “Le Passage”. She sighed and told me that she couldn’t tell me. I begged her to tell me, told her that the parents weren’t here to hear her anyway, but she just didn’t want to. So, I just asked her “Is it really that great? And am I going to sleep with you and Vincent?”. Then, her eyes filled with tears, and she tried to hide it. I apologized for asking too many questions, I loved Marie, I didn’t want to make her sad. Then she took my hands, and just said “Julie, you need to leave.”. I didn’t understand, I tried to ask her why she was saying that, but she cut me off and said “Julie, leave before your birthday, just like when you play hide and seek but never let them find you, ok?”.   
  
I didn’t sleep that night. I was thinking about what she told me. Marie made a lot of jokes, that was my favorite thing about her, but she never lied to me in order to get a laugh. This scared me even more.  
  
The next day, three days ago, I felt like I was on autopilot most of the time. I kept repeating what Marie said to me in my head, trying to decide what to do. I tried to talk to her again but just as I was approaching her, she shook her head and put her finger on her mouth. So I was in the dark. Then in the afternoon, Dad said something that brought me out of my thoughts: “Hide and Seek”. Dad was asking who wanted to play hide and seek. I didn’t even think about it, I just said: “Me”. A few of my younger brothers and sisters joined in and, before we all got out to play, I looked at Marie one last time. She nodded at me with a sad smile and showed me the pocket of her skirt then pointed her finger at me.   
  
Dad started counting to 100 and I ran in the woods to hide like my brothers and sisters. Once I found a good spot. I put my hand in the pocket of my skirt, and I felt a small paper. I took it out and unfold it. It was a note from Marie. She must have put it here while she was drying our clothes this morning. It was a small paper that said this: “run ALONG the road, not on it. NO COPS, I love you”. Reading this made me tear up, because it felt like goodbye forever.   
  
And then, I ran. I got to the road and, as the paper said, I ran beside it. I got as fast as I could. I’m good at running and hiding after all these years of hide and seek. Mom and Dad always tell us that the reason why we play this much hide and seek is so if one day outsiders got to our home, we’ll be able to hide from them, so they don’t harm us. And now, I was using it to hide from them.  
  
I must have been running for 5 minutes when I heard the noise of dad’s car coming behind me. I immediately jumped into a bush and hoped that he doesn’t see me. His window was open and he was yelling my name with a megaphone. He said things like “Julie are you lost ? Dad is here, follow my voice” and I almost wanted to go to him and say that I got lost. My mind was all over the place. I told myself “why are you running away from your dad, he loves you, and you love him, he didn’t do anything wrong, it’s your family, they’re all you love and care about, go back”, and then I was reminded off the face of Marie, her words, the fear in her voice, and suddenly, my home, my parents, my life, it all seemed so terrifying and dangerous.  
  
The car went in the same direction that I was previously running to, so I just waited. When the car came back, I saw dad’s face, and he seemed way less nice and kind than how I knew him. When the car passed me, I started running again. I ran for like, 20, or 25 minutes when I found another road. It was bright and loud, they were all sorts of vehicles, big lights that almost hurt my eyes as the sun was coming down. I was shocked by everything that I saw. I always thought these kinds of roads were way further our home.   
  
I must have been standing there for a full minute when a small car pulled up. The door opened and a young woman who must have been 25 years old asked me if I was okay and if I needed a ride. I didn’t know what to say, as far as I knew “anyone who seemed to be nice just wanted to get something out of you”. I hesitated, even thinking about going back to the house like nothing happened. Then I heard mom. She was screaming in the megaphone, she seemed not so far. All I heard was her voice, she sounded completely enraged, saying “Julie come back here you little slut”.  
  
I jumped in the car without a word, and they started the car. They were three, two girls and one boy. They asked me if I was okay, if I had a phone, some family to contact. I just kept saying no, I didn’t know what to do now. After 30 minutes during the which I kept looking behind us to see if I saw Dad’s car, I just explained to them that I needed to go away from here. They seemed scared by that and proposed that they called the cops, to wich I said no. They ended up leaving me to my request in a small city/town where we passed. Before saying goodbye, one of the girl gave me some money, I didn’t know if it was a lot, mom and dad never taught us how money worked specifically so I didn’t know the value of what she gave me.   
  
The last two days, I’ve been sleeping outside and buying food in a few stores that I found. I have found this Internet Café and I’ve been trying to understand how to seek help without cops on the internet and this is my first attempt.  
  
I don’t know what to do, I want to save my brothers and sisters but I don’t even know what to save them from.   
If anyone has any advice, please help me.   
I’m open to questions too.
