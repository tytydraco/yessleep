A man pulls up a barstool next to me, and beckons the bartender. “Could I get a Bloody Mary?” He says as he chuckles to himself. The bartender seems to stand still, as if frozen in place. “What the hell?” He says, laughing as if he made a particularly good pun.

“I must’ve had a bit too much to drink tonight!” I say to the man next to me. “I feel like I can’t even stand up.”

He sighs. “I’m afraid so. Finish your drink and come with me.”

“You tryin’ to fight me? I haven’t done anything to you. I’m a pretty good fighter, I’ll kill you if I have to.” I tell the man. He just chuckles.

“That would be preferable for the both of us. Sadly, you must come with me eventually.” He says to me, almost calmly, even as I raise my fist to punch him. He slowly pushes it down with his own hand, and playfully shoves me as if we’ve known each other for years. “At least be polite before you try and kill me, let me introduce myself.”

“I don’t know what you want, but I’m not going with you, wherever you want to go.” He doesn’t react, just waits polite as ever, like I didn’t just threaten to bash his brains in. I wait for a moment for him to say his piece, but he beckons me to speak. “Fine. What’s your name?”

He looks at me patiently, eyes unblinking, voice staying perfectly calm as if he has said this a million times.

“I’m Death, and your time has come.”

I pause for a second, my mind stopping to compute “I’m not ready yet” I tell Death. Hes no skeleton, no scythe standing by his side, just another man.

He sighs, “That’s what they always say, trying to delay, stall. I’m sure you already know it won’t work.” He smiles at me, and taps the simple watch on his arm. The hand seems to keep still, seconds not moving.

“You don’t understand - I still have so much to live for, so much more to do!” He doesn’t argue, just sits by my side, sunken eyes staring into my soul, as if they have seen centuries of use.

“We can sit here until I must claim the life of your sun and stars as well, you mortals can never get your affairs in order.” Death says to me calmly, almost comfortingly in a strange sort of way.

“But I need to talk with my family, and there are a million questions-“ Death cuts me off.

“I’m afraid your time is up. You will get no peace from talking with me.” He says as a mother would to her child, patient, understanding, yet firm and commanding.

“Then just one.” I plead.

“Go ahead.”

“Why sit here and tell me all of this?” I try hard to swallow but cannot, my throat closing in on itself. “Why-” I struggle to breathe “Why not simply reap my soul and leave?”

“I try to be kind. I do not enjoy taking life anymore than a mortician wants to dissect you. It is simply my job, I try not to make it too hard on you.” He continues “Take your drink for the road, for I shall walk with you into eternity.”
