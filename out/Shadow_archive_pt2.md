Time Capsule Of The Past

Jacob rolls out of bed. He didn't sleep much after that sleep paralysis. He gets into his car heading to a trail trying to find the area where Jake took the photo. They seem to be close to an abandoned rundown house “Where can they be disappearing off to anyway?”  

After a long hike he finds the place he grabs his gun ready he heads inside there’s empty liquor bottles old used cigarettes and graffiti when all of a sudden he heard some banging he readys himself entering the room. as soon as he turns the corner a masked thin man rushes him pushing him into the wall whacking him with a wrench hitting his hip,leg and side of the head the gun had dropped.

 Jacob knees him in the gut knocking him back  grabbing his gun the masked man runs off leaping out the window running off jacob fires a few shots at them not landing any hits “SHIT WHAT WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT” he runs into the room seeing the walls covered in messages “he’s always watching  “he’s getting closer”  “he is the darkness”  “he is god” and more rambling messages along those lines.


“the fuck the fuck” in the center an alter of shot glasses bloody knives hair and photos  “this this is some cultish shit”  he holsters the gun getting out of there fast stopping by a doctor getting patched up “what exactly happened to you sir”  “jumped by some masked guy”  “do be more careful alright”  Jacob leaves heading to the cordnates on the paper.

 he opens the trunk moving the sawed off pump shotgun in the back grabbing a shovel and starts digging in a big open feild the Forrest nearby. it takes all day but he eventually finds it a big army trunk he throws it up climbing out the hole opening it inside the trunk shakes jacob.


 there where two hoodies and there two notes some snack wrappers old toys and playing cards and other nostalgic items from the early 2000s. he skims though the notes they seem to be “to your future self” letters reading though kimbers brings him to tears “hello me hope your doing well and that your still with Jacob I’m writing this in 2004 cant imagine what life’s like 20 years from now I’m writing this to remind you of your past self and to see if you’ve gotten with Jacob yet I plan to ask him out maybe in two years or so let us grow closer I really hope so if you did kiss him for me much love form young kimber”

  Jacob tears up dropping the note “I I loved you to kimber” he closes the trunk he then looks around realizing how dark it is he checks the time it’s already 7pm “I I was only here for a few hours what how is it” he looks around also realizing how slient it was in the distance he saw that same figure form last night  just barely. he puts the trunk away in his car looking around not seeing him he rubs his eyes then looked around he was about 10 maybe 15 feet away he hops in his car and speeds off driving fast.

“WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT THING” he speeds down the path as he makes a turn its there right infront of him he screams swerving……….

2000
Jacob was new to town he was 10 he didn’t have freinds and didn’t know what to do he sat alone in the living room his parents have to take care of something when he gets a knock at his door he gose to open it the warm air of summer flooding in. a girl green eyes brown hair in a short sleeve shirt and jeans stands at the doorstep “hay I saw that your new in town my names kimber” her voice gentle and kind “Jacob it’s nice to meet you”  “you have a bike jacob”  he nods  “cool let’s ride for abit and talk”  “r really o ok one second”  Jacob writes a note letting his parents know he’s out when done writing he gets his bike and walks outside.

 “Don’t mean to sound mean but why are you doing this Kim”  “I know what it’s like to be in a unfamiliar place with no friends” she rides ahead jacob follows smiling having made his first friend. she showed him around town they stop at the park swinging on a swing set it and prattle. after awhile it  gets cloudy the smell of rain fills the air they ride to the Library sitting at a table reading together listening to the rain.

 “your pretty cool kim”  “aww come on your way cooler your from out of town trust me things get stale here fast”  “maybe things won’t be now we’re friends” she smiles “maybe” they continue to read together then later go on the computer. it starts to get  late and  the rain stops “it it was nice meeting you kim”  “same with you”  she hugs him before hopping on her bike ridding home jacob smiles “I I made a friend I made a friend” he rides off happy not caring if he might get in trouble for being out late just happy he met someone he can bound with……


Modern 

Jacob shoots up awake the car in the Field he was just in gasping for air. once he catches his breath he looks at his watch it’s 12:30 pm “wh wh what” he looks at the backseat seeing the trunk there opening it seeing everything there. he gets out looking around the holes he dug gone like he wasn’t even there “th that women mentioned a group in the hills with everything I’ve seen this this has to be a cult or….. I I don’t know what’s happening here I……..” jacob exhales falling to his knees 

“how is she connected to all this” he rubs his head trying to process all this “I should take a closer look at the run down house” on his way there fire trucks pass heading to the house of jake's parents. he speeds there seeing the house engulfed in flames firemen rush to put it out “shit shit” Jacob mutters speeding to the rundown house he runs up the hill to where it is only to find it’s gone not like demolished no it’s gone gone like it had just popped out of existence. jacob looks around out of breath “wh wh what WHY IS THIS HAPPENING” Jacob falls to his knees screaming when he hears rusling behind him he turns only to see a masked man swinging something at him before everything goes black.
