Sorry if the grammar in this isn’t the best I’m typing this in a rush because I’m hiding from it

Hi I live in a small town in Ireland called Evercrest don’t try and find it the government have taken it off the map and removed it from any records I think they’re just going too abandon us now that it’s here part of me thinks they always knew it was coming because our little town was always kept away from the other towns and cities in Ireland anyway here’s my story

I was in college and it was mid may and when I left I saw 3 crows pecking at something in the fields I went over to see what they were pecking at and found a small white snake like creature maybe about a foot and a half in length except it really wasn’t a snake at all it had no arms or legs but that’s where the similarities end it had no eyes, ears, nose nothing only a mouth a big one too I chased the crows away from it and lifted it up it let out a light screech as I did I said I’d bring him back to my dorm and show him to my science professor tomorrow it so I went to the pet store and got this snake starter kit thing and assembled it I put it together and he seemed to really hate the heat lamp so I turned it off and he seemed much happier I decided I oughta feed him luckily the starter kit came with frozen mice so I thawed one out and gave it to him he seemed to love it at this point it was midnight so I decided to go to bed unfortunately he didn’t like that idea very much and between the hours of 3am and 4am he wouldn’t stop violently screaming. 

When I checked on him after he stopped screaming he had grown legs 4 of them he was also covered in his own blood I cleaned him up and brought him to my professor only thing is my professor had no idea what he was he said and I quote “if there’s aliens this is one of em” but anyway he took some blood and said he’d get me blood test results for him as I was walking home with the creature in a box I decided I should name him the name I landed on was Crester when I got home I fed him and watched tv I let Creater sit next to me on the couch he seemed friendly and docile now so I had no problem doing this then after a few hours I fed him and went to bed thank god that night he didn’t start screaming again.

 When I woke up the next morning I noticed something something that scared me his tank was smashed and one of my windows was broken I looked for Crester thinking he had escaped nope he was on the counter sleeping twice the size he was the night before blood around his mouth he went hunting I thought so I put cardboard on the window I didn’t have the money to fix it at the time after buying the snake kit thing that id now have to work doubles to replace I just decided that he was friendly enough and big enough to free roam my dorm so that’s what I let him do. 

When I got to my college I saw the field where I found him full of dead crows I wondered had he done this as revenge against them I brushed it off the next few days were relatively normal with him increasing in size everyday but then one day I came back from a lecture and he was acting very aggressively roaring at me and walking backwards when I’d try to approach him he even whipped me with his tail I also noticed that his skin had turned too a dark green colour with a red stomach I left him alone I knew something was up with him but then the next morning I woke up too a massive cocoon in the corner of my kitchen huge enough for atleast 2 or 3 adult humans to fit inside I left the dorm quickly and went to work when I got back that evening the cocoon was shaking and making noise.

Later that night it broke in 2 and out walked Crester on 2 legs he had gone back to his white colour and was now 7ft tall with very long arms compared to his body he walked toward me slowly and cornered me in and growled at me and beared his teeth I had never been so scared I thought he was gonnna kill but then he hopped out my window and left breaking it in the process I went to the bar to try and forget about the whole thing as I was utterly traumatised the next day I got to my college and saw crowds of students crowding around crime scene tape as my science professor was wheeled out in a bag apparently someone attacked him ripped him apart they say it was likely someone he had a debt too but I know it was Crester getting revenge for the blood test 

A few missing persons reports later and there is a meeting about it in the town hall when the police start talking about suspects Crester bursts in and starts attacking people the rest is kind of a blur but I remember screams now I’m hiding behind a desk in the town hall there’s bodies and blood everywhere and Crester is still here looking for people I think he knows I’m here I’ll update this if I can
