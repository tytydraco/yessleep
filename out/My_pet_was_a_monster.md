Hi, I live in a small town in Ireland called Evercrest. Don't try to find it; the government has taken it off the map and removed it from any records. I think they're just going to abandon us now that it's here. Part of me thinks they always knew it was coming because our little town was always kept away from the other towns and cities in Ireland. Anyway, here's my story.

I was in college, and it was mid-May. When I left, I saw three crows pecking at something in the fields. I went over to see what they were pecking at and found a small white snake-like creature, maybe about a foot and a half in length. Except it really wasn't a snake at all; it had no arms or legs. But that's where the similarities end. It had no eyes, ears, nose, nothing—only a mouth, a big one too. I chased the crows away from it and lifted it up. It let out a light screech as I did.

I said I’d bring him back to my dorm and show him to my science professor tomorrow. So, I went to the pet store and got this snake starter kit thing and assembled it. I put it together, and he seemed to really hate the heat lamp, so I turned it off, and he seemed much happier. I decided I ought to feed him. Luckily, the starter kit came with frozen mice, so I thawed one out and gave it to him. He seemed to love it. At this point, it was midnight, so I decided to go to bed. Unfortunately, he didn’t like that idea very much. Between the hours of 3 am and 4 am, he wouldn’t stop violently screaming. When I checked on him after he stopped screaming, he had grown legs—four of them. He was also covered in his blood. I cleaned him up and brought him to my professor. 

The only thing is, my professor had no idea what he was. He said, and I quote, "If there's aliens, this is one of them." Anyway, he took some blood and said he’d get me blood test results for him as I was walking home with the creature in a box. I decided I should name him. The name I landed on was Crester. When I got home, I fed him and watched TV. I let Crester sit next to me on the couch. He seemed friendly and docile now, so I had no problem doing this. 

After a few hours, I fed him and went to bed. Thank God that night he didn’t start screaming again. When I woke up the next morning, I noticed something that scared me. His tank was smashed, and one of my windows was broken. I looked for Crester, thinking he had escaped. Nope, he was on the counter, sleeping, twice the size he was the night before, with blood around his mouth. 

He went hunting, I thought, so I put cardboard on the window. I didn’t have the money to fix it at the time after buying the snake kit thing that I'd now have to work doubles to replace. I just decided that he was friendly enough and big enough to free roam my dorm, so that’s what I let him do. When I got to my college, I saw the field full of dead crows. 

I wondered if he had done this as revenge against them, but I brushed it off. The next few days were relatively normal, with him increasing in size every day. But then one day, I came back from a lecture, and he was acting very aggressively, roaring at me and walking backward when I'd try to approach him. He even whipped me with his tail. I also noticed that his skin had turned to a dark green color with a red stomach. I left him alone, knowing something was up with him. But then the next morning, I woke up to a massive cocoon in the corner of my kitchen, huge enough for at least 2 or 3 adult humans to fit inside. 

I left the dorm quickly and went to work. When I got back that evening, the cocoon was shaking and making noise. Later that night, it broke in two, and out walked Crester on two legs. He had gone back to his white color and was now 7ft tall with very long arms compared to his body. He walked toward me slowly, cornered me in, growled at me, and bared his teeth. I had never been so scared. I thought he would kill me, but then he hopped out of my window and left, breaking it in the process. I went to the bar to try and forget about the whole thing as I was utterly traumatized. The next day, I got to my college and saw crowds of students crowding around crime scene tape as my science professor was wheeled out in a bag. Apparently, someone attacked him, ripped him apart. They say it was likely someone he had a debt to, but I know it was Crester getting revenge for the blood test.

A few missing person reports later, there is a meeting about it in the town hall. When the police start talking about suspects, Crester bursts in and starts attacking people. The rest is kind of a blur, but I remember screams. Now I’m hiding behind a desk in the town hall. There are bodies and blood everywhere, and Crester is still here looking for people. I think he knows I’m here. I’ll update this if I can.
