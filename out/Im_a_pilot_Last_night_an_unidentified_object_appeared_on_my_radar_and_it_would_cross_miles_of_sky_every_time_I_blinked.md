I’m a pilot. A first officer for a major commercial airline. My job is a series of complex, highly regulated routines designed to ensure one simple thing: that a hundred-ton metal tube full of people gets from one point on the globe to another without falling out of the sky. It’s a job built on checklists, on procedures, on the cold, hard, and verifiable data that feeds into the dozens of screens that make up a modern cockpit. I trust my instruments. My life, and the lives of my passengers, depend on that trust.

Last night, that trust was shattered. And now I’m sitting in a hotel room a thousand miles from home, thinking about what i have witnessed.

It was a routine red-eye flight, a six-hour haul across the country. The kind of flight that pilots both love and hate. The skies are quiet, the passengers are asleep, but the deep, soul-crushing fatigue of flying through the dead of night is a constant, creeping enemy. We were at our cruising altitude of 37,000 feet, somewhere over the vast, dark, empty heart of the country. The autopilot was engaged, the plane a steady, silent ship sailing on an ocean of stars. The Captain, a veteran with twenty years in the left seat, was quietly working on a crossword puzzle. I was doing my usual scan of the instruments, my eyes tracing the familiar, comforting glow of the displays.

That’s when I saw it. On my primary navigation display, the screen that shows our position, our route, and any other air traffic in the vicinity, a single, new icon had appeared.

It was a perfect, solid green diamond, the standard symbol for other aircraft. But it had no call sign, no altitude information, no speed data. It was just… a diamond. And it was located about ten miles directly behind us, on our exact flight path.

“Hey, Cap,” I said, keeping my voice casual. “You seeing this traffic on your display?”

The Captain didn't look up from his puzzle. “Nope. Screen’s clean. Probably just a ghost. ATC hasn't called anything out.”

Ghosts, or phantom radar returns, aren't uncommon. A bit of atmospheric interference, a flock of birds, a software glitch—they can all create a temporary, false target. They usually flicker and then vanish.

But this one wasn't flickering. It was solid, steady, and it was matching our speed of 500 knots perfectly.

“This one’s not fading,” I said, a little more insistently this time. “It’s been there for a solid minute. Ten miles, six o’clock, matching our speed.”

The Captain finally sighed, put down his pen, and leaned over. He looked at his own, identical navigation display. It was, as he’d said, completely clean. Then he looked at mine.

“There’s nothing there, kid,” he said, squinting at my screen. “Not a thing. Your display must be on the fritz. Run a diagnostic.”

I stared at my screen. The green diamond was as clear as day. I looked back at his. Empty. I looked back at mine. The diamond was still there. A cold, strange feeling, a prickling of deep, fundamental wrongness, began to crawl up my spine.

“I’m telling you, there’s something on my screen,” I said, my voice tight.

He gave me a look, a mix of annoyance and paternal concern. “Look, I see your screen. It’s blank. You’re seeing things. You’re tired. We’ve been flying for four hours. It happens. Just… run the diagnostic and get some coffee.”

He went back to his puzzle, a clear dismissal. But my eyes were glued to my screen. The diamond was still there, ten miles back, a silent, impossible companion in the night sky. I ran the diagnostic. The system came back clean. No errors. No malfunctions.

I kept watching it. For ten solid minutes, it stayed in the exact same spot, maintaining a perfect, ten-mile distance. A part of my brain, was still trying to find a rational explanation. A unique, localized software bug affecting only my display. That had to be it.

I finally broke my gaze. I had to make a routine radio call to the next air traffic control sector. I looked away from my screen for no more than ten seconds. I keyed the mic, made the call, and then my eyes snapped back to the navigation display.

The diamond was now one mile away.

My breath hitched in my throat. I didn’t just gasp; I think I made a small, choked, terrified sound. It had crossed nine miles of empty space in the ten seconds I wasn’t looking.

“Cap,” I whispered, my voice a strangled croak.

“What now?” he sighed, not looking up.

“It’s here,” I said, my voice trembling. “The thing. It’s one mile behind us.”

He finally looked up, his face a mask of pure, unadulterated annoyance. “For the last time, there is nothing…” He stopped. He leaned over, looked at my screen, then at his own, then back at mine. His eyes went wide. The diamond, now much larger on the display, was there. He could see it now, too.

“What the hell is that?” he breathed, his crossword forgotten. He grabbed the radio, his voice now sharp, professional. “Center, this is flight 1138. Do you show any traffic at our six o’clock, approximately one mile? We have an unidentified target on our scope.”

The reply from the controller was calm, but I could hear the faint undertone of confusion. “Uh, negative, 1138. Our scopes are clear in your vicinity. You’re the only thing we see for fifty miles in any direction.”

The Captain and I just stared at each other, the same cold, terrifying realization dawning in both our eyes. This thing, whatever it was, was visible only to us.

And then, I understood. With a clarity so sudden and so horrifying it felt like a physical blow, I understood the rule.

“It only moves when I’m not looking,” I whispered.

The Captain stared at me. “What are you talking about?”

“When I saw it before,” I explained, my eyes now locked on the green diamond on my screen, not daring to look away, “it was ten miles back. I looked away to make a radio call, and when I looked back, it was here. It only moves when I’m not watching it.”

It was the most insane, childish, playground-logic thing I had ever said. It was the rule from a horror movie, from a video game. Weeping Angels. Don’t blink. But in the cold, sterile, logical world of my cockpit, it was the only explanation that fit the data.

The next hour was the longest, most agonizing hour of my life. My eyes burned. My neck ached. I couldn’t look away. The Captain handled all the communications, his voice tight with a tension that I’m sure the controllers on the ground could hear. He kept glancing at me, then at my screen, his face a pale, sweaty mask in the dim cockpit light.

“It’s still there?” he’d ask every few minutes.

“It’s still there,” I’d reply, my voice a dry rasp, my eyes watering from the strain.

I tried to be clever. I tried to use my peripheral vision to look at the other instruments, but the moment my focus shifted even slightly from the center of the screen, I could feel it. A subtle, almost imperceptible lurch in my stomach, a strange, dizzying sensation of movement, of space being compressed. The moment my focus snapped back to the diamond, the feeling would stop.

But I couldn't keep it up forever. My eyes were on fire. They were so dry and strained that the screen in front of me was starting to blur, the glowing green diamond swimming in a haze of my own tears.

“I can’t do this, Cap,” I finally gasped, my vision wavering. “My eyes… I have to rub my eyes.”

“Don’t you dare, kid,” he hissed, his voice a low, desperate command. “Don’t you dare look away.”

But it was too late. My body betrayed me. I rubbed them, and it was a long, slow, agonizingly tired rubbing as i am trying to regain my focus, my eyelids feeling like they were made of lead.

When I opened my eyes, the screen was clean.

The green diamond was gone.

A wave of profound, shuddering relief washed over me. It was over. It had vanished. I had won the world’s most terrifying staring contest. I let out a choked, hysterical laugh.

“It’s gone,” I said to the Captain, my voice cracking. “It’s gone.”

The Captain didn't reply. He was staring straight ahead, through the cockpit window, his face a mask of pure, abject terror I had never seen on any human being, let alone this grizzled, unflappable veteran.

“First Officer…” he whispered, his voice a strangled, terrified thing. “What is that… above us?”

I followed his gaze, up, through the top window of the cockpit. And I saw it.

We were flying under an ocean. A living, breathing, impossible ocean where the sky should have been. And floating in that ocean, its colossal, bulbous body blotting out the stars, was a creature of impossible scale. It was a squid. A squid the size of a mountain, its skin a shifting, iridescent tapestry of colors I had never seen before. Its tentacles, each one as thick as a skyscraper, drifted lazily in the void, tipped with what looked like hooks of polished obsidian. And at the center of its great, fleshy head was a single, vast, intelligent eye, a golden, reptilian orb the size of a football stadium. And it was looking down at us.

We were a tiny, insignificant minnow, swimming under the belly of a leviathan.

My mind, simply… broke. I stared, my mouth agape, unable to process the sheer, cosmic, Lovecraftian horror of what I was seeing.

And then, I rubbed my eyes, not believing wat i am seeing.

Just a normal, reflexive this time. When my eyes opened, it was gone from above us.

It was now in front of us.

It was just there, filling the entire windshield, a solid wall of shifting, alien color and a single, vast, golden eye that filled my entire universe.

The Captain screamed, a raw, terrified, animal sound. I just sat there, frozen, waiting for the impact that would annihilate us.

I rubbed my eyes again.

And it was gone. The sky in front of us was empty. The stars were back. I looked at my navigation display. It was clean.

The Captain was hyperventilating, his hands shaking so violently he couldn’t hold his pen. “Did we… did we just…?” He couldn’t finish the sentence.

“Yeah,” I whispered. “I think we did.”

The rest of the flight was a silent, terrified ordeal. We landed the plane on autopilot, our hands too shaky to trust with the controls. We didn't speak a single word to each other. When we got to the gate, we just unbuckled, grabbed our bags, and walked out of the cockpit, leaving the plane to the next crew.

I’m in my hotel room now. It’s been hours, but I can’t stop shaking. The Captain is in the room next to me. I can hear him, through the wall, talking on the phone to his wife, his voice a broken, trembling thing.

I don’t know what we saw. I don’t know what the rules are. But I know this. There are things in the sky, in the deep, dark, empty spaces. And they have their own rules. And last night, I played a game with one of them. A game of hide and seek, at 500 knots, at 37,000 feet. And I am so, so afraid that it’s not done playing with me. I am so afraid to see it again.
