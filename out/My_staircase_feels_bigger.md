I don’t know how to explain it, but my stairs feel larger. I used to be able to bound them without thinking anything of it, but now I notice them. It’s something you just have to take my word for, or I guess I’ll have to take my own, since I never thought to measure them before now. Still, I exerted enough energy crossing the threshold of my doorway today to make a mental note of it. A lot of things lately just haven’t felt right, but I easily fall prey to depression, which can sometimes alter the way I remember things. My emotions tend to weaken my reliability as a narrator, I suppose. 

I don’t feel sad, but I’ve not felt sad before, only to realize I was festering in a pit of sorrow way deep down, too far down for it to have just happened. Even still, if this is sadness, it’s different than it’s ever been. Yesterday, I went to catch a matinée and ran out of the house without locking the door. I know I didn’t lock it because halfway through the drive, the thought hit me like an eighteen-wheeler. I’ve gotten into the habit of saying out loud, “I’m locking the door now,” when doing so, because I know I can trust myself, or at least I thought I could. I turned back around to fix my mistake, kicking myself for missing the previews. After thinking about those stairs again, I turned the knob only to feel resistance. The door was locked, but I know I didn’t lock it. I didn’t say I locked my door, and I’d remember my words. But unless my cats locked it for me, I did it. Right?

Is this what descending into madness feels like? Hyper-fixating on the tiniest, most minute details before nothing makes sense and everything feels like a lie? It’s not as bad as I thought it would be if it is, but maybe I’m still in the preliminary stages. I haven’t had much of an appetite lately, so I decided to buy some of those loose olives and other assorted pickled things they have at the buffet tables in the supermarket. I love sour and fermented things, things that make me pucker, food that bites back. I don’t care how long it’s been floating in the pool of vinegar and dried Italian herbs; it makes me feel something. I decided to eat them at the dining room table instead of in a dark corner of my home, to enjoy some sunlight for a change. Sunlight and I don’t always get along, but when I need it, I really yearn for it. Retreating to my home on days like that always feels wrong, so feeling the rays cascade on my skin through the cracks of my blinds, chomping away at cornichons and restaurant-style tortilla chips, made me feel as normal as I possibly could, all things considered. In fact, I decided to text some friends of mine and grab a drink at our local dive bar that night. Anything to not be home and think of those stairs.

I got dressed to go out that night, half-expecting to cancel at the last minute. I tend to make plans when I’m chasing normalcy but often abandon them when it comes time to engage. But this time, I followed through. I pulled on some clothes, spritzed myself with something citrusy and sharp, and forced myself out the door. I almost laughed as I reached the staircase. It felt silly, the way I stood at the top like it was some kind of obstacle course. The stairs weren’t visibly different, not longer or wider, not covered in mold or riddled with cracks. Just wrong. I tried to shake it off. Maybe I’ve been sleeping too little. Maybe I’ve been talking to myself too much. But then I counted them.

One, two, three. Each step was deliberate, as though the number could tether me to something objective. Eight steps. There have always been eight steps. I would know; I used to leap up them in twos. But when I reached the bottom, I had counted nine. I stood there, breath caught in my throat, trying to remember if I’d made a mistake. I turned back to look at the staircase from below. It looked the same. Nothing unusual. But the count was wrong. I told myself I must have doubled up somewhere. Miscounted. It happens. I left before I could dwell too long, half-daring myself to be spooked and half-praying I wouldn’t be.

The bar was noisy, a safe kind of noisy. Clinking glasses, overlapping conversations, someone laughing too loudly near the restrooms. My friends didn’t notice anything off about me, which comforted me more than it should have. We played pool and complained about work and talked about awful dating experiences. I didn’t talk about the stairs. I didn’t talk about the door. I drank just enough to stop thinking. But when I got home, the silence hit me like a wall. The shift was immediate. Still, heavy, attentive. My cats weren’t at the door like they usually are. I called out for them, but they didn’t come.

It wasn’t until I went to hang up my keys that I noticed it. The food. The flimsy Tupperware container of olives, the half-eaten cornichons, the little paper tray I had left on the dining room table—they were now stacked on the kitchen counter. The tray had been emptied. The containers were sealed. The table had been wiped clean. I didn’t do that. I know I didn’t do that. The air in the room changed, like someone had just exhaled after holding their breath for a little too long.

My chest tightened. I glanced around, eyes darting toward corners, toward vents, toward the closet down the hall. I was suddenly aware of the sound of the fridge humming and how every other noise in the house had gone quiet. Eventually, I sat on the edge of the couch, shoes still on, keys still in hand. My gaze drifted to the stairs. I stared at them for a long time. Then I stood up and walked toward them, slowly. I counted, aloud this time.

“One… two… three…” Each step creaked underfoot, but only slightly, like it was trying not to be heard. “Four… five… six…” My skin prickled. The hallway behind me felt too still. “Seven… eight…” I paused. My foot hovered above the next step. I knew, somehow, that it should be the landing. But it wasn’t.

“Nine.”

I looked up.

There was still another step above me.
