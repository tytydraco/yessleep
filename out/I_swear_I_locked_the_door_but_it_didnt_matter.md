Part 1

It had been a long Friday. One of those days where your legs feel like lead and your brain’s running on fumes, but you can’t really complain because everyone else looks just as dead on their feet. We’d been slammed since noon—storm or no storm.

Honestly, I thought the rain would keep people home. The weather station was blasting warnings all afternoon: flash floods, tornado watches, thunderstorms rolling in heavy. But if there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that a cheap Friday the 13th tattoo will make people wade through hell and high water. Literally, in this case.

I’m the shop apprentice, meaning I don’t actually tattoo yet. I do the cleanup, paperwork, setups, breakdowns—all the unglamorous stuff that keeps things running. Today, that mostly meant mopping mud off the lobby hardwood over and over again. By hour eight, I swear I could trace half the designs in our flash sheets from memory just from staring at them between clients.

Still, there’s a weird kind of satisfaction in watching the chaos die down. The buzzing slows, people pay, thank their artist, limp out into the storm with their bandaged little skull or dagger. Eventually the chatter fades until it’s just the rain outside and the hum of the shop lights.

I like that part. The end of the night. It feels like the shop exhales with you.

By the time I was wringing out the mop for the last time, my shoes were soaked, my back ached, and my hair smelled like disinfectant. But the hardwood floor shone again, and that was enough. 

By the time I hauled the mop bucket to the back, it felt like I was dragging fifty pounds of sludge. One of the guys—Chris, an old timer who’d been tattooing longer than I’d been alive—was heading out at the same time and caught the back door for me.

“Appreciate it,” I puffed, maneuvering the bucket outside into the rain-slick alley.

He just leaned against the doorframe, smoking, while I tipped the nasty water into the drain. My back popped when I straightened, and I gave him a tired grin. That’s when I noticed his hand outstretched toward me. A wad of twenties pinched between his fingers.

“You did a good job today, kid,” he said. “This is our thank-you.”

I blinked at the cash like it might vanish if I hesitated too long. At least a hundred, easy. More than I’d expected to see in one place, at least for just scrubbing floors. My throat caught a little when I muttered a quick, “Thank you. Seriously. Thank you.”

Chris gave me a crooked smile, flicked his cigarette into the rain, and jogged off toward his truck. I watched his taillights disappear into the sheets of water before pulling the door shut behind me.

For the first time all day, I let myself breathe. A little lighter, a little proud, even. I leaned back against the closed door and counted the bills, just to feel the weight of it. Two hundred bucks. My first real tip from the shop.

I tucked the bills deep into my pocket, shoved my hands in after them, and started back toward the lobby. 

Suddenly, a sharp, high ringing started in my ears. At first I thought it was just the quiet pressing in, but the sound grew clearer, thinner, like a thread pulling tight.

*Perfect. Just what I need—a migraine coming on.* I rubbed at my temple, hoping it would fade, but it clung to me, steady and insistent.

That’s when I heard the front door chime. The sound tangled with the ringing in my ears until I couldn’t tell where one ended and the other began. My chest tightened.

I froze—not scared, exactly, just… confused. I could’ve sworn I’d locked it after the last rush, and the only people still here were wrapping up in the back. I figured maybe one of the clients was just heading out late.

But when I rounded the corner into the lobby, my stomach did a flip.

Someone was standing inside.

Not one of our regulars, not a lingering client waiting for their ride. Just a stranger, dripping water onto my hardwood floors, their clothes plastered to their skin, hair hanging in wet coiled ropes. They weren’t moving, just… waiting, like they’d been there the whole time.

I tightened my grip on the mop handle, like that would help. “Uh… hey. Are you here to pick someone up?”

They lifted their head slowly, water dripping from their hair onto the hardwood. 

Her eyes were wide, too wide, like she’d forgotten how to blink properly. The irises were dark, but not like normal—almost like polished stone catching the light in the wrong way. When she smiled, her pupils didn’t shift the way they should; they stayed fixed on me, sharp and unblinking, and it made my stomach drop.

I felt my toes curl inside my shoes, a cold prickle skittering up my spine. There was something… *aware* about the way she looked at me, but it wasn’t warmth or curiosity. It was deliberate, measured, and disturbingly patient—as if she had all the time in the world, and I was a bug caught in her gaze.

Every time I tried to look away, I couldn’t. My eyes slid back to hers, drawn like a magnet, and the same hollow, too-wide stare met me again. Something about it pressed in, and I realized it wasn’t just that she was staring—it was the wrongness of it. My brain screamed at me to run, even though my legs refused.

Her voice was soft, polite, but the sound of it made my stomach drop. She spoke in an accent impossible to place, but one could almost compare it to the Transatlantic accent you hear in old Hollywood movies.

“Do you have time for one more flash tattoo?”

For a second, I just stared. The storm had soaked her completely through—shirt clinging, shoes leaving dark puddles underfoot. Her face was pale under the harsh fluorescent lights, almost waxy, with shadows sinking deep into their eye sockets. And yet, the way she asked, it was so casual. Like it was the most normal thing in the world to walk in after midnight, dripping wet, and ominously stand in our empty front lobby and ask for a late night thirty-dollar tattoo.

I glanced down at my phone. 12:01 a.m. Saturday. Technically not even Friday the 13th anymore.

“Uh… I mean…” I shifted the mop to my other hand, suddenly aware of how ridiculous I must’ve looked standing there dripping wet just like her. “Most of the artists have already left. We kinda wrapped up the sale at midnight.”

Her eyes didn’t move from me, didn’t flick around the lobby the way most clients do when they’re turned away. Just fixed, steady.

I swallowed hard. *It’s just a long day. I’m exhausted. That’s all it is.* I told myself that over and over, but it did nothing. My ears started ringing again, a high, insistent whine that made it impossible to focus.

I cleared my throat. “I can… go see if anyone’s still around, though. Maybe one of them’ll take you.”

Her composure shifted—barely, but enough to make my chest tighten. The tension in her shoulders eased, and for the first time she smiled. A teethy grin, one that made her eyes stretch even wider. 

“Thank you,” she said, her tone gentle, almost relieved.

Up close, under the fluorescent lights, I noticed her skin looked strange—pale and glassy, like porcelain slicked with rain with freckles peppered across her forehead and nose. Tight black curls clung damply to her face, framing eyes that seemed too wide, too dark.

I forced a small nod, the words catching in my throat. 

“Yeah, for sure,” I said, tugging at the hem of my hoodie as I stepped past her, my heart accelerating closer I got. I turned the lock on the front door, giving it that extra jiggle just to make sure no one else could wander in again from outside.

I turned back to her, trying to keep my tone light. “Go ahead and take a seat on the couch, I’ll be right back.”

The pale glassiness of her skin caught in the overhead light, and one dark curl slipped forward against her cheek. Her body didn’t move, not even her smile—just her eyes—and said in that soft, odd voice, “Thank you.”

I smiled back, but the expression felt more automatic than genuine, and as I high tailed it down the hall toward the back, a little prickle of unease crept in. Something was off, but I couldn’t place it—something about her presence, like her creepy eyes and smile, maybe the funky accent—or just the fact that I could’ve sworn I’d locked that damn door. And the ringing in my ears especially did not help. Maybe it was the start of a migraine?

All I knew was that it had been a long day, and I just wanted it to be over.

The hallway buzzed faintly with the sound of the last machine shutting off as I stepped in. Two artists were still around—Steven, who was standing and handing his client a little aftercare card, the other, Joe, was still in his chair, zipping his iPad into his backpack.

I hovered a moment, not wanting to push my luck, but the thought of that girl still waiting in the lobby put an air bubble in my chest that I could barely breathe through. Finally, I cleared my throat. “Hey, um… would either of you be up for one more? Just a quick flash piece?”

Steven didn’t even look at me. “Nope.” he muttered flatly, his eyes still on his client.

The woman he’d just finished tattooing gave me a brief, uncomfortable smile, like she felt sorry for me, before gathering her purse. My face burned a little, but I turned toward Joe, desperate.

He sighed, leaning back in his chair, shoulders slumping. “Do you even know what she wants?”

I nodded quickly, too quickly. “Yeah—something small from the sheet. Nothing big. Real quick.” I had no idea if that was true, but I’d have said anything to keep him from saying no.

Joe pressed his lips together, then exhaled in defeat. “Fine. I’ll meet you up front. Just give me a minute to set up.”

Relief washed through me. “Thank God.”

I turned toward Steven’s client and gestured towards the lobby, “I’ll walk you out.” 

No way I was going back out there by myself.

She nodded politely, and together we made our way up the hall. The ringing in my ears grew louder like needles piercing my eardrums and filling up with fluid, trapping it all inside my head. My ears were ringing loud enough now that it hurt. *Maybe this is the start of a migraine,* I thought desperately. But migraines don’t make your toes curl in terror. They don’t make your chest hollow with the feeling that something is… fundamentally wrong.

I swallowed, trying to force my voice to work. “Joe… uh… he’ll be back in just a minute.”

Her eyes followed me again. Not once did she look at Steven’s client. Just me.

I forced myself to walk past her, leading Steven’s client to the door as quickly as possible. The unnatural, unblinking stare never wavered. The smile stayed. And for the first time since this whole night started, I felt truly, unmistakably, watched.

I unlocked the front door, held it open, and smiled at her as she stepped into the night. “Get home safe, okay? Have a good rest of your night.”

“You too,” Steven’s client said, before disappearing into the rain.

I pulled the door closed behind her and slid the deadbolt in with a loud *click*. Locked, definitely this time.

Before I could even turn around, I heard Joe’s footsteps in the lobby. He greeted the latecomer casually, “Hey, you already picked something out?”

Her voice floated back, softer now, but with a touch more brightness than before. “Yes—I’d like this small cross.”

Her demeanor was still uncanny, but lighter somehow, like being asked by Joe made her more real.

Joe nodded, reassuring as always. “Of course. No problem.” He grabbed the clipboard from the counter and held it out to her. “Go ahead and follow me back. We’ll get your paperwork started.”

Joe and the girl disappeared down the hallway, and I shrugged to myself, left alone in the lobby again. My body ached from the long day, so I stretched, rolling my neck until it cracked. There were still things to finish before I could leave, and I needed to get as much done before this migraine took me out.

Room by room, I tied up the day—slipping new trash bags into bins, pushing all the client chairs neatly against the walls, resetting the shop so it would feel fresh when everyone dragged themselves back in tomorrow. I gathered the mountain of paperwork and carefully organized it into separate stacks for each artist. By the time I had everything tucked under my arm and made my way to the filing cabinets in the back, Joe was just finishing up with the girl.

I pulled open the heavy metal drawer, the smell of weed and dust wafting up as I slid files into place. Behind me, I heard Joe walk her out. His voice carried down the hallway, low but polite: *Have a good night.*

A crack of thunder boomed right on cue, rattling the whole building as the front door shut. The lights flickered, humming back to life after a few seconds of stutter.

I slid the last folder into the cabinet and let the metal drawer thunk shut. The thunder outside rolled again, rattling the glass in the windows. Joe was leaning against the wall a few feet behind me, pulling on his vape, the sweet, artificial cloud curling toward the ceiling.

“Thanks again for taking her on,” I said, keeping my eyes on the stack of papers in my hands. “I really owe you one.”

He shrugged, exhaling. “No problem. Buy me lunch tomorrow, we’ll call it even.”

I smiled faintly, shaking my head as I tucked the paperwork back into its folder. After a pause, the words slipped out before I could really think them through. “She was a little weird, huh?”

Joe’s brow furrowed, just slightly. “Not really. Why?”

I froze.

I kept my back to him, pretending to straighten a stack of papers that was already perfectly aligned, hoping he didn’t notice the way my shoulders stiffened. My stomach sank. It was such a casual answer, tossed out without hesitation, but it didn’t make sense.

*Not really?*

Had he not seen the way she just sat there? That off smile? Those eyes that followed every step I took, like she was wound up on springs and waiting to pounce?

For a split second, it felt like Joe and I had interacted with two completely different people.

I forced a soft laugh, masking the unease crawling up my throat. “Oh, nothing. Just… she seemed quiet, I guess.”

He didn’t press, just nodded, blowing another cloud of vapor. But the unsettled feeling clung to me like a shadow.

Joe pushed himself off the wall, pulling his hood over his snapback and nodding toward the back door. “I’m gonna step out and finish that blunt from earlier before I clean up. You wanna come?”

I gave a small, almost reflexive shake of my head. “Naw,” I muttered, a little more dejected than I meant to.

He lingered, hand on the doorframe, studying me. “You good? You seem… I don’t know. Off.”

My heart skipped, but I forced a tired smile, waving it off like it was nothing. “I’m fine. Just tired. I had this migraine earlier, and now that it’s finally gone, I just want to wrap everything up and get out of here.”

He seemed to weigh that for a second, then gave me a slow nod. “Fair enough. Don’t overdo it.”

“Wouldn’t dream of it,” I said, even though my chest felt tight.

With that, he pushed open the door, cool night air rushing in as he stepped outside. He glanced back one last time before letting it shut behind him.

I was left in the hum of the old shop lights, trying not to think too hard about how much easier it was to blame a migraine than explain what was really gnawing at me.

Once the last file was tucked away, I returned to the front. The clock on the wall read 12:40 a.m. I sighed, figuring I’d make myself useful. I loaded the copier with a stack of forms, punched in *75*, and let it hum to life.

The shop felt different with just me in it, quiet but still buzzing faintly from the storm. I perched on one of the padded client beds, scrolling absently through my phone while the copier worked. The rhythm of it, mixed with the sound of the rain, lulled me until my eyelids grew heavy. At some point, I must’ve dozed off.

I must’ve dozed off harder than I realized, because the sound of the back door creaking open jolted me awake. I rubbed my eyes, blinking against the harsh fluorescent lights as I heard Joe moving around in his booth, metal clinking, drawers opening and shutting as he started to clean up.

And then it hit me again.

The ringing.

This time it wasn’t just a dull edge humming in the background—it sliced through my skull like a feedback screech from a blown speaker. My teeth clenched, and I pressed the heel of my palm against my temple, hoping to smother the noise, but it only seemed to make it worse. The longer it stayed, the more it drowned out everything else—the shuffle of Joe’s feet, the buzz of the lights, even my own breathing.

It felt like the world was narrowing down to that single, piercing note.

I swallowed hard, fighting to steady my breath, praying Joe wouldn’t suddenly call out to me and catch how rattled I was. The last thing I wanted was for him to think I was losing it.

I let my head fall back against the wall, closing my eyes again—until a sharp beep from the copier jarred me. Out of paper. “Dammit,” I muttered, standing up. A messy pile of finished forms had already spilled onto the floor. I crouched down, nearly losing my balance, to gather them.

“Hey, Joe!” I called out as I scooped up the papers. “You about ready to head out?”

The crinkle of bags came from his room. His voice followed, muffled but calm: “Almost, hang on—”

Before I could respond, the walls lit up with pulsing red and blue. It was sudden, violent—the whole lobby washed in color, shadows jerking across the blinds like they were alive.

My breath caught in my throat. My heart lurched so hard it rattled my ribs.

*No, no, no… what the hell?*

I crouched lower, clutching the scattered papers in my hands as if they could shield me, and crawled toward the hallway door. The copier’s beeping felt like it was screaming at me, each high-pitched note drilling into my skull.

Outside: slamming doors. Boots hitting pavement. The crackle of radios spitting static.

Then—the banging. A thunderous, bone-deep pounding that shook the glass in its frame.

“POLICE!”

The word hit me like a slap, loud enough to reverberate through the floor.

I flinched hard, spine curling in on itself.

My gaze shot down the hallway. Joe was there, silhouetted at the far end, his backpack slung over one arm, his face still bent toward his phone. Oblivious. Until the lights from outside found him.

The moment the flashlights sliced through the blinds and landed on him, he looked up.

Our eyes locked.

For a suspended heartbeat, everything went still—like the storm outside had sucked all the air out of the building. His face drained of color, frozen in that awful deer-in-the-headlights stare. His eyes were larger than I’d ever seen them.

The pounding came again, louder this time, rattling the front door on its hinges.

“JOSEPH GREEN!” a voice thundered, rattling my skull. “WE NEED YOU TO COME OUT WITH YOUR HANDS UP!”

My pulse was everywhere—in my fingertips, in my ears, in the hollow of my throat.

Another crash of fists against glass. The words came again, angrier, “JOSEPH GREEN, OPEN THE DOOR!”

The beams of light stretched farther down the hallway now, brighter, harsher, pinning him in place like a prisoner already in the spotlight.

I wanted to move, to say something, to breathe—but my body wouldn’t obey.

And then the thunder hit.

The kind that doesn’t just sound, it *rolls* through you, shaking the air itself. The lights flickered violently, stuttering, buzzing, before the whole building was swallowed by darkness.

The second the dark took him, Joe vanished.

Joe’s backpack slipped from his shoulder and hit the floor with a thud, forgotten. His shoes squealed against the hardwood as he bolted, sprinting for the back door.

And I stayed crouched there on the floor, clutching crumpled papers, heart hammering so hard it felt like it might break through my ribs.

My eyes darted toward the front. The cops were still pounding, rattling the glass in the frame. My only thought—my only *hope*—was that Joe had remembered to lock it after walking that girl out.

*Please, God. Please let it be locked.*

But even as the prayer formed in my head, I knew. I *knew* it didn’t matter.

The next bang was louder, sharper—wood splintering, hinges shrieking. Then everything happened at once.

The front door gave way with a violent crack, and suddenly the lobby was *flooded*. Black uniforms, heavy boots, flashlights spearing the dark. They moved like a single beast, all noise and chaos and urgency.

“Police! Joseph Green, show us your hands!”

“He’s running out the back door!”

“Clear the lobby! Watch the corners!”

I jerked back, blinded by a beam of light that landed directly on me.

I flattened myself against the wall, choking on the smell of wet leather and rain as half a dozen officers stormed past me. Their radios spat frantic static. Guns were drawn, beams cutting across every surface.

“You there! Hands where we can see ’em!”

My arms shot up before my brain caught up. I stammered, “I—I work here! I’m not—”

“Stay still, ma’am!” an officer barked, holding one palm out toward me while keeping his other hand tight on his weapon. He didn’t close the distance—he didn’t need to. His tone alone pinned me in place.

“GO, GO, GO!” someone barked, and I heard the rush of footsteps pounding down the hallway after Joe.

Others fanned into the lobby, sweeping every corner, their flashlights cutting across my face. One of them shouted, “CLEAR!” but the word didn’t make me feel any safer.

My whole body was trembling. I wanted to tell them I wasn’t part of this, that I didn’t understand what was happening, but my voice wouldn’t come. All I could do was press myself smaller into the corner and hope—stupidly, desperately—that somehow they would let me just get up and go home.

But of course, they did not.

I flinched back against the wall, my body rigid with shock as a hand grabbed my arm and yanked me forward.

“Don’t move! Hands on your head!”

“I—I don’t—” My voice came out as a hoarse whisper, but it didn’t matter. My face was forced toward the cold lobby floor, the grit of glass biting into my cheek as they pinned me there.

While half the officers surged after Joe, two stayed behind with me. One angled his body between me and the chaos, keeping his flashlight fixed.

“Who are you?” the officer barked, flashlight still pinning me to the floor like a spotlight.

“El—Elizabeth. Apprentice here. Please, I didn’t—”

The officer didn’t lower his light. His voice was sharp, clipped, the kind you obey without thinking:

“Elizabeth, don’t move. Do you understand me? Don’t move.”

I nodded, but my whole body trembled, arms aching above my head. I listened for Joe or any sign of him, but from what I could tell, he’d somehow escaped into the night. 

Another crack of thunder shook the building, rattling the glass.

“Don’t move!” the second officer yells, his voice so close it makes me flinch.

I don’t dare breathe too loud. My chest is tight, trembling against the floor.

“Palms flat,” another voice commands. “Do not reach for anything.”

My fingers splay against the hardwood, every nerve in my body screaming. That’s when I notice, the ringing is gone again. The seconds drag, each one heavy enough to crush me. I hear more shouting outside, more running. Joe is out there somewhere—I know it—and every part of me feels like I’ve been swallowed whole by the chaos.

Then the officer leans closer. His words cut through everything, sharp and merciless:

“Now—put your hands behind your back.”
