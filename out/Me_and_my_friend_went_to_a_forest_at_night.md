This happened only a week ago from me writing this and I still remember every detail. Me and my friend who for this story I’ll call Mark, decided that we would have a sleepover. Mark lives about 10 minutes away from my house so we decided meet halfway and then go back to my house. Me and Mark eventually got a bit bored at around 3pm and decided to go out and come back later.

Next to mine and Marks school is a big field split into 3 ares, one is for my school, another is for a football club and the last is just a random field. On the football field is two containers and is usually a great hangout spot for friends. And on one corner of the field is a large forest, while at the containers we decided we would go to the forest later that night and walk around as we thought it would be a creepy but fun experience. 

At around 11pm we eventually snuck out of my house and started walking to the forest. On the way to the forest was scary enough, we both live in quite a small town and at night it gets very eerie and dark, especially when around alleyways or low-light areas. We eventually arrived at the forest and to get in we had to climb a small gate as it was locked after a certain time. After climbing over into the forest we started walking around, and yes we did have a torch but it was on our phones so it wasn’t that good. After walking round for a few mins it felt fairly normal, yes it was creepy being in a dark forest alone at night, but nothing was really happening…yet.

It had been about 5 minutes and now we were hearing things, like footsteps when we were stood still or leaves and sticks crunching around us. The air felt warm but we heard a strong wind, it gave a weird feeling. Throughout all this I felt like I was being watched, and I think Mark felt the same as he kept looking around him. We decided to stand still for a minute and listen for anything as we now thought something was off. After a minute or two of standing still, we both hear a loud quick movement as if something started running in front of us. We ran away after hearing that but we didn’t leave, we were still in the forest but now we could see the gate in case we had to run out and climb over, turns out we did. I kept seeing something moving around between the trees, Mark said he was hearing what he thought might be whistling. Now we were very creeped out but it soon got a lot creepier. Both me and Mark saw something behind a tree but couldn’t properly see what it was, and then we see a silhouette of a person peak around the tree and stare through our body, me and Mark ran and quickly climbed over the gate.

After a few mins of standing in front of the Forest Gate and listening, I came up with an idea that gets most people killed in movies, I entered the forest alone, to see if I could get anything else happening since I was now alone. After only about a minute or two of walking, I heard whistling from the left side of me, as I turn my head I was faced with pure nightmare fuel. There was a person or thing staring at me only a few steps away from the other side of a bush, to describe in detail what I saw I would say it had a wide smile with haunting white, cracked eyes. I was now darting towards the gate and then hopped over and even nearly fell from how fast I tried to climb over. Mark asked what happened and I told him, he was about to say something as we heard a loud cough from inside the forest and very close to us, we ran and turned onto the road we went down to get to the forest.

I wish I could say this story is done but it’s not. We stood down the road looking down and we see what look liked 2 people on different sides of the road standing still staring down at us. We turned around and kept walking acting like we didn’t see anything. But I kept hearing the same usual noises, coughing, whistling and even laughing. I’m going to skip a few parts as it’s mainly just us being scared and standing still for 10 minutes trying to look and hear for anything. But now I see a person crouched behind a public garbage bin. I decided to walk up to it and try see more. Once I was a bit closer I noticed there was something now waving around, like this person or thing was holding an item and taunting us with it, then I realised this item was a knife, Mark must’ve seen it too as I saw the face on him, genuine fear. I looked back at the person or thing, and as I looked back I saw a head pop up over the bin and stare directly into my soul. Me and Mark were now running faster than ever. We kept looking behind us, and one of the corner we turns, a person popped out and ran for us, Me and Mark were now getting chased around the dark, empty, silent streets of my town. We eventually got to my house and now weren’t being followed.

That night was definitely something that’ll be in my memory until I die, I just hope that whatever the fuck was in there, dosent know where I live. Me and Mark might go back to the forest and I’ll keep updating if we do.
