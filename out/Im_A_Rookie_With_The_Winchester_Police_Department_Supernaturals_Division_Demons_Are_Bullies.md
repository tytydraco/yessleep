Well, Halloween *sucked.* So much so, that it’s taken me a couple days to physically recover, but more on that later.

If you're confused, you can read my first case [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gfkkpn/im_a_rookie_with_the_winchester_police_department/)

I gotta be frank with ya, it felt like I was a chicken running around with its head cut off for most of the day. Being a rookie and working the busiest day of the year was not a fun experience.

And it definitely didn’t help that my Halloween started out on a pretty rough note. My barista asked me out on a date.

Yes, that’s a bad thing. I don’t *date.* Not since…

There’s this little coffee place by work that I liked to stop at before my shift- Conner’s Cafe. It’s quaint, cozy too, with a good rustic vibe going on and dim lighting. For some reason, it also reminded me of home. Chicago. Probably why I frequented there so much. That, and they gave me a good discount when I wore my blues.

The staff were all genuinely friendly and welcoming to me too. The coffee itself didn’t taste half bad either, so I quickly became a regular. Maybe a little too regular given the events that were about to occur.

The bell chimed above the door as I entered the shop. It was pretty empty in there. Gauging by the state the dining room was in, the morning rush had just cleared out, granting the employee’s a bit of respite before the inevitable lunch rush.

“He did it!” The barista manning the counter shouted at me with wide eyes, pointing to his co-worker behind him. I’d come in wearing my uniform.

The accused looked at me like a deer caught in headlights before dropping the stack of cups he’d been holding in his hands and booking it to the back.

A smile spread on my lips as a soft chortle escaped me. My cheeks pinked up immediately and I covered my mouth in embarrassment, giggling something fierce. The barista joined in with a hearty laugh as he bent down behind the counter and picked up the discarded cups.

The rabbit, his name is José. Don’t worry, he didn’t have any active warrants out for his arrest or anything, he just went out back to take his smoke break. Albeit in a very dramatic way.

The kid behind the counter was Noah. He was young, in his early twenties. He looked like an E-boy with his singular earring and that mop of curly brown hair atop his head, which usually covered up his brown eyes. In addition to his uniform green apron, Noah wore a headband with fuzzy wolf ears on them accompanied by a pair of fingerless gloves with paw pads drawn on the palms. Draped around his shoulders was a fake sheep’s pelt. He’d dressed up as a wolf in sheep’s clothing for his Halloween costume. *Clever.*

“Aren’t you going to get in trouble for wasting all those cups?” I asked, stepping up to the counter to order.

“Nah, it’s fine,” he answered, chucking them in the trash bin, wiping imaginary dust off his hands. “Our seasonal cups are about to come in anyway, so these ones won’t be missed. What can I get for ya, miss? The usual?”

“Yeah, but could you add two shots of espresso please? I’m going to need it.”

“Ooh four shots of expresso, huh, what’s the occasion?”

I covered my mouth, yawning. “I’m working a twelve hour shift today. Twelve to twelve.”

Noah pressed his lips into a thin line, sympathizing with me. “Oof, yikes. I’ll get that coffee right out for you then. Wouldn’t want you to be off your game today, officer.”

“Thanks Noah,” I called out to him as he walked over to the espresso machine, “‘preciate it!”

A second later, he came back, placing my large cup of steaming hot supercharged coffee on the counter. I went to pull out my wallet to pay, but Noah waved me off. “It’s on the house,” he said with a glimmer in his eye and a dopey grin.

I smiled back, shrugging my shoulders and picking up my drink, not saying no to a free coffee. That’s when I noticed something written in sharpie just above the paper sleeve. The note read: *Will you go out on a date with me?*

My gaze flashed from the cup, to Noah, then back to the cup again. He stood there patiently, smiling like a puppy, eagerly awaiting my response.

“Oh, uh,” I let out a nervous laugh, gripping the straps of my purse for dear life, “no.”

The smile fell off of Noah’s face as he looked down at me, heartbroken. I didn’t want to kick the puppy, but I had to.

“I-it’s not you,” I blurted out, awkwardly waving my hands at him. “You’re great, really. A little young, but great! What are you, like twenty, twenty-one? You’re like five years younger than me!” I sucked a gasping breath for air. “It me, that’s the problem. You don’t want to date me. All I do is hurt the people that get close to me. I don’t mean for it to happen, it just does. But, yeah Noah, you’re great. Awesome, even! Best barista I’ve ever had, truly.”

As you can see, I like to word vomit when I’m uncomfortable.

Not giving him any time to rebuttal, I whipped my wallet out of my purse and haphazardly threw a five dollar bill across the counter, then ran out the door- all while abandoning my coffee in the process.

Great. Now I can never go back and show my face there again. That’s what I get for getting too comfortable. Should’ve known my safe place wouldn’t stay safe for long, *stupid.*

Guess I’ll just have to suck it up and stick to a certain chain coffee shop with a mer-person on the logo.

Now that I’m thinking about it, is their mascot a mermaid or a siren?

*Ugh.* The thought of sirens sent a shiver down my spine.

My throat is feeling a lot better, by the way. It’s still stiff and is a little bruised, but at least I can fully turn my neck again. Being able to keep my head on a swivel is pretty vital for the job after all. Never know when something might jump out at ya.

When I got to the precinct, everyone on our side was bouncing off the walls it was so hectic. Officers were bringing people in left and right. Our holding cells were packed full, the intake line stretching across half the precinct. Every time someone answered the phone, dispatch had a new incident for them to respond to. And as soon as the phone hit the receiver it would just ring again.

I set my things down on my desk, eyeing the coffee machine like a hawk. If I were going to survive this shift, caffeine needed to be flowing through my veins. Since it was Halloween, we had no clue which calls *actually* pertained to the supernatural and which ones were just humans being human. So that meant we just had to respond to *all* of them.

As soon as I stepped towards the kitchen, Dustin appeared out from nowhere and dashed all my hopes of acquiring a pick me up. “Rookie!” He called, slipping an arm through his black police jacket. The other followed and he adjusted the fabric so it rested comfortably on his broad shoulders.“No time for dilly-dallying, get in the car. We got ghouls to catch!”

A hefty groan left my mouth. I shuffled my feet forward a couple inches, my hand outstretched towards my lord and savior: coffee. Dustin called out to me again, causing me to flinch. With another huff and groan, I turned away from the source of my vitality and followed Detective Davidson out to his vehicle. I knew then that it was going to be one of *those* days.

Dustin wasn’t lying by the way. We’d been called out to a report of someone at the graveyard disturbing the graves. The groundskeeper caught the perp as he was sucking the intestines out of an old woman who was about to be lowered into the ground. After hearing that, it wasn’t hard to figure out we were dealing with a ghoul.

We classify ghouls as a type of vampire since they feast on flesh and blood, but mostly of the dead variety. You can think of ‘em as vampiric zombies. The classification is mainly because ghouls die just the same as regular vampires. Decapitation works best in most cases, but a wooden stake to the heart could do the trick too.

Here at WPD the last thing we want to do is end the life of a supernatural individual. Just like for us humans, supernaturals have the right to go to trial and let The Court decide their fate. Though, we are extensively trained to neutralize any threat if absolutely necessary, especially if that threat poses immediate danger to a human life.

Unfortunately, it was looking like that would be the case for this ghoul.

The groundskeeper had managed to detain him, but not unscathed, sustaining a gnarly bite wound on his hand. That’s when he called Winchester 911 and asked for an officer out to help him.

Getting that taste of fresh blood was like a shot of adrenaline for the ghoul. If he got loose, there was a very real possibility he’d kill the groundskeeper and eat until there was nothing left. Once a ghoul eats a live victim, the dead just don’t taste as good to them anymore.

We got to the graveyard just in time. As Dustin and I left his car, weapons drawn, the ghoul escaped from the groundskeeper’s binds and was trying to strangle him to death. The ghoul was an older, redneck looking man. His skin was pale and caked in dirt, human tissues, and viscera. The smell of death radiated off him.

“Help me!” The groundskeeper called out to us in a choked gasp.

Not wasting any time, Dustin drew his crossbow and aimed a wooden stake at the ghouls heart. I tensed, the groundskeeper was keeping him from a clear shot. The stake whistled as it soared through the air. My eyes clenched shut.

They opened again when the ghoul let out a ghastly cackle. Dustin had missed, hesitating with the shot at the last second because of the groundskeeper’s position. The stake had landed in the bark of the oak tree behind them.

The ghoul laughed, tilting his head back and unloosening his jaw. Leaving his neck exposed as he prepared to take a bite out of his next victim. Thinking quickly, I grabbed the crossbow from Dustin and reloaded. A sharp breath withdrew from my chest as I squinted my eye and pulled the trigger. A stunned gargling noise came from the ghoul’s throat as a the wooden stake embedded itself into his trachea.

The ghoul released the groundskeeper in its state of confusion. Relieved, he ran far away from the redneck and towards Dustin. This left the creature wide open. I unsheathed the machete I’d brought and ran up to the ghoul as he clawed at the wooden stake in an attempt to remove it. I didn’t give him the chance to. I kicked the piece of wood deeper into his neck. The sound of his spine cracking rang out as he stumbled into the tree, right next to the stake Dustin had fired. The momentum of my next swing enabled the blade of the machete to slice through his neck in one smooth swoop.

The red neck’s body fell limp as the head landed on the ground with a wet *thump*!

“That’s what ya get for eating Mrs. Patty, bitch!” The groundskeeper laughed, dancing around the ghoul’s corpse. Dustin cleared his throat and shot a stern look at the groundskeeper. Feeling the chill of Dustin’s iconic icy cold glare, he stopped, a serious and more adult expression returning to his face.

“Not a word, got it?” Dustin commanded.

“Y-yes, sir. You don’t gotta worry about me,” he answered. Davidson gave the man a sturdy nod. The groundskeeper didn’t stay long and quickly skedaddled, leaving us to clean up the mess.

“Nice one, rookie,” he said proudly, patting me on the shoulder.

I gently slid his hand off of me. “Thanks.”

After dropping the ghoul’s body off at the morgue, we were called out to investigate reports of a supposed ghost terrorizing the elderly residents in a subdivision on the other side of town.

The perp wasn’t the ghost of an ancient serial killer like dispatch had advised, but a kid dressed in *very* convincing ghost makeup. I swear special fx makeup is on a whole other level these days, because when I first saw the kid I was convinced he was a real ghost too. His skin looked pale, glassy, and if I looked hard enough, translucent. The face makeup made his eyes look real sunken in and sickly.

Turns out the kid was going around tp’ing these individuals houses and banging on their windows because he had some sort of vendetta against them from last Halloween. Apparently, these old geezer’s had handed out raisins and vegetables instead of the good stuff.

Since the delinquent was so young, we let him off with a warning. The looming dread of his mom’s fury as she calmly talked over the phone was punishment enough.

Speaking of warnings, one of the calls we responded to was at the residence of one of the local witches. Her name’s Marge and she’s a real sweet old lady. Something really bad must’ve happened if we were called out to her place. Dispatch had told us that someone had apparently been transformed into a cat?

When Dustin and I pulled up, Marge was sitting on a rocking chair on her porch, arms crossed tightly in her chest. A teenage girl stood in the driveway crying, holding a razor scooter in one hand and a fuzzy black kitten in the other. In front of her lay another razor scooter and a pile of baggy men’s clothes. A giant bloody skid mark was left on the pavement.

“What happened here?” Dustin asked, trying hard to hide his amusement.

“That *witch* turned my brother into a cat!” The girl angrily screamed, seething at the old woman just chilling on her porch.

“What’s your side of the story, Marge?” I asked, treading carefully up towards the woman. I didn’t want to run the risk of upsetting her and getting whimsically transformed into an animal like other the kid did.

Marge pressed her lips into a thin line and started rocking. She looked down at the blood stain solemnly. “He ran over my familiar with that damned scooter. It’s only fair he takes its place.”

After hearing both sides of the story and deliberating on what to do, we let both parties off with a warning. The boy’s sister wasn’t very happy that her brother wouldn’t be returning home, but I had to explain to her the grave mistake her brother had made by killing the witch’s familiar, even if it had been an accident.

She stormed off, learning a valuable lesson in that the next time she rides her scooter to be careful of her surroundings. Otherwise she might just find herself with new feline features.

As for Marge, Dustin allowed her to keep the  boy as her familiar, but warned that next time she’d have to go through the department and get a permit first. If she didn’t acquire one, we’d have to come and take them away, which nobody wanted.

We’d just gotten back into the liftback when we were summoned once more.

“Uh, could we get someone out here with us? This is turning out to be a bit more than we can handle,” Unit 217 called out over the radio.

Dustin and I checked their location on our map. We were the closest ones to them in the area. I looked at him, my eyes pleading for a break. We’d been responding to call after call for the better part of seven hours by then. I still hadn’t had a cup of coffee and something in my gut told me this one was going to be a doozy. He just smirked and shrugged his shoulders.

Asshole.

Dustin reached for the radio on the dashboard. “380 to 217. 10-4, can you give us a little more information? Let us know what we’re walking into.”

“217 to 380. We responded to a domestic dispute call and have the husband detained in the bedroom, but it’s gotten pretty weird over here. There’s something *wrong* with this guy. We need backup, just in case.”

Dustin let out a sigh and shot me an annoyed look.

“Told you,” I mouthed, sassily.

He rolled his eyes at me before responding back, “Standby, we’re on our way.”

When we arrived at the house, the sun was just setting beneath the horizon. Trick-or-treaters were out in full swing. Nosey kids and parents watched as Dustin and I met with the officers in Unit 217 on the porch.

An angry yell sounded from somewhere within the residence, the lights out on the porch flickered in response. A blonde middle aged woman came out from the open front doorway. She looked distraught and on the edge of tears. Her cheek was bruised, her upper lip was busted, and strangulation marks lined her neck.

“We’re so glad you’re here,” 217 said as the woman looked at them, pleadingly.

“You guys are good to go. We got it from here,”Dustin said, dismissing our counterparts. He shot me a glance, using his eyes to ask me if I was thinking what he was thinking.

The slight smell of rotten eggs clung in the air and the lights flickered again. Sharply, I nodded my head.

Unit 217 looked relieved as they retreated back to their patrol car. Two hardened and experienced cops like that looking so scared made me uneasy.

Of course we’d get stuck dealing with a demon of all things on Halloween, the one night a year where they’re at their strongest.

The girl introduced herself as Ginger Farley, the wife of the man 217 had detained inside. Harlen Farley. She’d called 911 after managing to lock herself in their bathroom before he could beat her to death.

Ginger initially flinched away when I reached out a supportive hand. After flashing her a sympathetic smile, knowing all too well what she was going through, she let me gently rub her shoulder comfortingly. “Can you show us where your husband is, Ginger? We’d like to check on his condition.”

“H-here,” she answered, shakily, “in the bedroom.” Ginger shot Dustin a weary glance and fiddled with her hands nervously, still blocking the doorway. Given the situation, it was normal for her to be feeling intimidated and scared by another male’s presence.

I stepped in front of Dustin and nodded, reassuring Ginger that she wasn’t alone and I’d be there to protect her. Hesitantly, she stumbled deeper into the house, still a little disoriented from her encounter.

The Farley house was a quaint one story ranch with a wrap around porch. The inside looked frozen in time, stuck in the 1970s. Dream catchers hung from the walls and hippie paraphernalia lined the shelves. A groovy Indian blanket was draped over a tan leather couch in the living room. The broken remains of a bong littered the floor, an overturned coffee table accompanying it.

Ginger slowly followed the path of destruction leading from ground-zero in the living room, through a short hallway, and into the master bedroom.

As we passed through the door, an overwhelmingly dark and overpowering aura filled the room. It was suffocating.

“Look what the whore dragged in!” A sickly looking man called from the bed with a wheezing laugh. He’d been handcuffed to the  bed frame of the couple’s water bed, one hand outstretched to each side. Yup, a friggen water bed. He sat spread eagle making it even harder not to laugh. The sight was so bizarre. Guess that’s Halloween for you.

Dustin and I shot each other curious glances. “Promising,” he muttered to himself, rubbing his thumb on his chin. Without proper confirmation, we had to operate under the assumption this man was himself and not under any sort of supernatural influence. Even with the signs we had observed, more tests needed to be conducted.

Us in the Supernatural’s Division rarely come across demon possession cases, and when we do, our job is to make sure what we’re dealing with is in fact a demon and not a really strong poltergeist or something else. After a positive ID is made, procedure states we wait with the possessed victim until we can get a priest out for an exorcism.

Dustin pulled out his emergency vial of holy water and started flicking water all over the potentially possessed man. Ginger stared at him dumbfounded. We hadn’t told her what we thought we were dealing with.

“Oh ow, no stop, that hurts,”Harlan said sarcastically in a mock whining tone as the water hit his skin. He then burped, the stench of sulfur emanating from his mouth. Though he was acting all tough, his skin had become red and irritated. And if you listened close enough faint sizzling could be heard.

Dustin made a non-committal noise as he pulled out his field notebook and started taking notes. I was just about to walk out and retrieve our state issued Holy Book and cross from his trunk when Harlan scoffed, tugging on his handcuffs, becoming clearly agitated. “You’re one of *them* kind of police officers, huh?” He asked, trying to sit up. He sounded annoyed.

Harlan then turned his head and looked directly into his wife’s soul. With a blink, the sclera in his eyes disappeared as his pupils blew up, leaving nothing but inky blackness. “Is this what you wanted to see, officer?”

“What the hell?!” Ginger screamed, grabbing onto my arm and squeezing the life out of it. The demon possessing Harlan let out a particularly nasty laugh, sounding like multiple voices talking at the same time.

Talking with our eyes again, Dustin gave me the go ahead to speak with her outside the room while he made the proper arrangements for her husband.

In the hallway, I endured a round of Ginger’s frantic questioning before conducting an impromptu interview of my own.

“T-two weeks ago, Harlan lost his job at the factory,” she began after I’d asked when she first noticed a change in Harlan’s behavior,” being replaced by a cheaper and more efficient automated system crushed him. He didn’t cope with it well, turned to the bottle instead of me. Harlan was real down, depressed and angry. So angry. He’s been going to the bar every night and a couple days ago he came back *darker*. He hasn’t been himself since. Then today-“ her voice hitched in her throat, causing her to pause. “Now it’s all starting to make sense…”

I grabbed Ginger’s hand and gently guided her back into the living room, kicking the broken glass and debris aside for her. She stifled a sob as she sat on the couch.

“Why don’t you stay out here for a while?” I proposed, sitting down next to her. “It’ll be safer this way.” With a tearful nod, Ginger agreed.

“Where’s the skank?” The demon asked as I re-entered the bedroom alone.

“Away, safe from you,” I answered, crossing my arms into my chest, leaning against one of the walls.

He scoffed, jerking his head my way. One of the bedside lamps flew across the nightstand, shattering into bits right by my feet. I stifled a jump by pretending to yawn, trying to show him he didn’t scare me.

“So, ya gotta name, demon?” Dustin asked, rolling up his sleeves, making himself comfortable. It was All-Hallows Eve, that meant we were going to be waiting a while for an exorcist to show up.

The possessed man spat at his feet, causing the waterbed to jiggle furiously. He laughed, “Not one that I’ll tell you!”

My partner did not look as amused. “Demon Dan it is, then.”

Demon Dan shrugged his shoulders, taking a liking to the name. Then, without warning, Dan turned his head towards me.   “Lucyyyyyy\~ you’re a bad girl aren’t you? A *very* bad girl!”

“H-how did you-“

“I’m a demon, girl, it’s my job to know these things!” Demon Dan hissed. He jerked his head back towards Dustin, yanking on his restraints harshly. “Dusty-boy, do you wanna know how she got her nickname?”

He shot me a nervous glance.

Dan then sang, “It’s because she’s lucky, *lucky to be alive!*”

“Hale, what’s he talking about?” Dustin asked, looking back and forth between us frantically.

“D-don’t listen to him, he’s a demon. He’s trying to get inside our heads!” I reminded Dustin.

In a panic, he retrieved his vial of holy water once more, dumping it over the demon. Small streams of smoke billowed off his skin. “You’re getting too rowdy for my liking. This outta shut you up for a while.”

A horrific wail escaped from Demon Dan as he violently convulsed. After a couple minutes of agonized gasps and groans, he seemingly settled down.

“Okay,” he said breathlessly in a serious tone as his eyes went dark, “playtime’s over.” A harsh metallic groan filled the room as Demon Dan broke through his handcuffs like they were nothing.

“Shit,” Dustin mumbled, stumbling back.

I pushed myself off the wall, looking around for anything that could be used as a weapon. I kicked myself for not getting the Bible and cross out of the car earlier. In his fit, Dustin had depleted his holy water supply, leaving us virtually unprotected.

“Why don’t you write this down for your little report, detective?” Demon Dan cackled as his back arched as an invisible force helped him slowly rise to his feet. Then, with a spectacular supernaturally aided jump, he clung to the ceiling like a cat. The sound of his feet padding around filled the room as he crawled around erratically.

“Me and this meat sack made a deal the other night,” with one hand still holding onto the ceiling, Dan brought the other down to his cheek, rotating it as he pouted his lip and mockingly cried. “He wanted to make sure his miss’s would be well taken care of.”

“So you possessed him?” I questioned.

Demon Dan smiled delightfully. “Did you know that Mr. Farley’s life insurance policy is worth one million dollars? He sure didn’t!”

Dustin bid in, “what does that have to do with possession?”

“Tsk, tsk, tsk,” Dan chuckled. “This coward would never end his life on his own. He needs someone else to do it for him! So, in exchange for a fun time with his wife, I would make sure she’d be set for life. Now it’s my turn to fulfill my end of the deal. Why don’t you say hi buddy, before you go?”

“No! No, no, no, please!” Harlan cried out, eyes going wide. Without Dan in control, he fell from the ceiling back first onto the hardwood flooring. A pained cry came from the man as many of his bones broke upon impact.

Ginger’s screams filled the house. Dustin and I turned around to find she had been peeking through the bedroom’s door, watching this whole catastrophe unfold. Seeing her broken husband’s dying body was enough to send her flying out of the house.

A gurgling sound came from Harlan’s throat as he coughed up blood. After the sound continued for a minute, I recognized it as a sinister chuckle. His eyes flickered from normal to pure black. Dan looked up at me and frowned. Harlan’s neck then snapped as it twisted to an unnatural angle, the frown turning into a sick smile. He flashed his blood red stained teeth. “There is no Heaven! There is no Hell! There is only darkness! Praise The Harbinger of Doom for they will bring darkness to us all!” He cryptically cried out with one final huff.

Demon Dan seemed to have left his host after that, leaving Harlan lying there broken and alone as he breathed his final breath, the light draining from his eyes.

We’d lost him.

“Fuck!” I shouted angrily, kicking the waterbed’s frame, causing the mattress to slosh around. I hadn’t wanted to go to the morgue for a second time that day.

Dustin tried to put a comforting hand on me, but I pushed him away. After letting me stew in self-pity for a moment, he told me to wait in the car. He’d call and cancel the priest and take care of the body.

After closing Harlan’s sheet covered body in the trunk of his car, Dustin drove us back to the precinct. The air was thick and heavy with tension. Something felt off. *Different.*

I confronted him about an hour before our shift was supposed to end. We’d been walking past the holding cells on our way to turn in the night’s paperwork. Passing by the last cell with its strategically opened door, I suddenly pushed my partner in. The door slammed shut behind him before he could even comprehend what was going on.

“Lucky? What the hell?” Dustin questioned, gripping and pulling on the silver bars frantically.

I stepped back cautiously.

He pushed and pulled even harder, staring at me like a caged animal. His look of shock turned into one of anger. In a rage he shouted, “What’s going on? Why am I in here?!”

My head turned away, unable to look at him. I couldn’t bring myself to say anything.

The rattling stopped. Then a beat. I forced myself to look at him. The pissed off look dissipated, leaving behind that same creepy grin I’d seen at the Farley house.

“Oops! Ya caught me!” Demon Dan giggled out, dropping the act. His eyes became two black abyss’s as the demon showed himself.

“Why are you possessing him?” I interrogated, my emotions enabling me to take a demanding step forward.

He shrugged his shoulders. “What can I say? I like it when you get all irritated and fired up.”

“You’re a bully,” I scoffed, tucking a stray piece of black hair back behind my ear, addressing the comment.

Dan bellowed out a laugh as if I said the funniest thing in the world. “No, I’m a demon, sweetheart. There’s a difference.”

“And why were you being so open about your intentions earlier?” I asked, changing the subject, “What did you have to gain from all that?”

Dustin’s eyes narrowed as he leaned his shoulder against the cell’s bars. “Nothing. I was just bored and you two were taking forever. I did find what I was looking for though, thanks for that.”

“Good, so you can leave.”

Demon Dan chuckled, crossing his arms into his chest defiantly. “And what if I don’t wanna?” He challenged.

I narrowed my eyes and seethed at the demon. “Get out of my partner, *now*,” I commanded. A strange feeling surged through my body then, causing my balance to falter just a bit.

The thing puppeteering Dustin’s body stepped back, holding his hands up defensively. “Whatever you say officer\~” he said with a smirk, flashing those black sclera-less eyes one last time. “See you later, toots.”

An evil laugh erupted out of Dustin’s throat as tears started to flow from his eyes. Then, in an instant, he stopped. His eyes were his again. “Hale, why am I in a cell?” He asked, confused.

“You were possessed,” I answered, opening the cell door for him. “Still might be.”

Then an intense wave of weakness and nausea overcame me. With the excitement of the day’s events over, the lack of caffeine and exhaustion had caught up with me. I stumbled to the ground, promptly passing out. My body felt like it was floating in water as my mind went blank.

I woke up lying on two office chairs that had been pushed together as a makeshift cot. Dustin was holding an ice pack up to my forehead, a thermometer sticking out of my mouth.

“Glad to see you’re back,” he chuckled after I spat the thermometer out and threw the ice pack on the floor. I gave Dustin the middle finger before he helped me up to my feet.

The fluorescent glow of the precinct’s overhead lights started giving me a headache. “What time is it?”

“Don’t worry, Halloween is over. And so is your shift,” Detective Davidson said as he helped me out to the parking lot. Outside, the early wisps of sunlight peeked above the horizon as birds started to chirp signaling the beginning of their hunt for worms.

Despite my protest, Dustin wouldn’t let me drive home. I kept reassuring him I was fine but he was not having it. With a promise to return my car to me, I reluctantly let him take me home.

Then that snitch told the Lieutenant about my fainting spell. I received an apologetic phone call from him, saying he felt bad to have forced me to come back to work so soon. Lieutenant Dawn then ordered me to take a mandatory week of leave to fully recover. He hung up before I could respond.

Today has been the first day I’ve truly felt able to do something since Halloween. I’ve expended most of my energy typing this out, but here’s my report for ya. And yes, of course I’ll keep you guys updated on what happens when I return back to the force.

I’ll leave you with this piece of advice: please, watch where you’re riding your scooters!
