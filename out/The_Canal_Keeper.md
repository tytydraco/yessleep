I've been the Canal Keeper of Sangrevor for twenty-three years, and in all that time, I've never missed a single day of work.   
  
Not when I had that operation three years ago, when they had to cut through my ribs to fix the damage. They said I’d need weeks to recover, but the thought of the canals sitting there, waiting… it pushed me through the pain. 

Not when the fever hit me hard, high enough to leave me delirious, my mind a fog of twisted dreams and aching bones, I still showed up. Because something about the sound of the water, the rhythm of the tides... it clears the head, soothes the soul.

Not even when my dear wife Constance passed five years ago. The canals don't care about your grief. Their flow is the one thing that’s never faltered. And so, I never have either.

My name is Edmund, and I suppose I should explain what a Canal Keeper does before I tell you about my daughter.

The canals of Sangrevor are the city's lifelines, twenty-seven miles of carved stone channels that wind through every district, carrying the crimson waters from the Weeping Springs in the northern mountains down to the harbor. The city engineers tell everyone it's iron deposits and clay beds that give the water its distinctive red hue. They've been saying that for generations, and most folk are content with the explanation. After all, who wants to think too hard about what they're washing with? What they're cooking with? What their children are drinking?

My job is simple enough on paper. I check the flow rates, clear blockages, and monitor the filtration systems at each district junction. I measure the water levels twice daily and file reports with the Municipal Water Authority every week. Clean, methodical work that keeps the city running. The sort of job a man can take pride in.

But there are other duties they don't put in the official job description. Things the city's founding fathers decided were better left unspoken, passed down from one Canal Keeper to the next through whispered conversations and careful demonstrations.

For instance, there are certain hours when you must never look directly into the water. The hours between dusk and full dark, when the light plays tricks and you might see things moving beneath the surface that have no business moving at all. During those hours, you keep your eyes on your gauges, your logbook, your tools, anywhere but the water itself.

Then there's the matter of the fish.

Not that we call them fish, you understand. The official term is "aquatic anomalies," and the official policy is that they don't exist. But every Canal Keeper knows about them. Pale, eyeless things that sometimes swim up from the deeper channels, their fins like shredded silk and their mouths full of needle teeth. When you see one, and you will, no matter how careful you are, you net it quickly and dispose of it in the furnaces beneath City Hall. You don't examine it too closely. You don't mention it in your reports. You certainly don't take it home.

My predecessor, Old Henrik, explained it to me on my first day. He was a weathered man with hands like tree bark and a nervous habit of touching the iron pendant he wore around his neck. "The water's been good to this city for three hundred years, boy," he told me as we walked the main channel. "It keeps the plague away, makes the crops grow strong, helps the sick recover faster than anywhere else in the kingdom. All it asks in return is a little discretion."

I thought I understood what he meant. I was young then, twenty-two and full of confidence in my ability to handle whatever strangeness came my way. I'd grown up in Sangrevor, after all. I'd been drinking the red water my whole life, and it had never done me any harm.

Twenty-three years later, I'm not so sure about that last part.

You see, there are things Old Henrik never told me. Things I've had to learn on my own, usually in the worst possible moments. Like how the water sometimes whispers your name if you listen too closely. How the pressure readings spike without explanation during certain lunar phases. How some of the older channels have hieroglyphs carved into their walls, symbols that hurt to look at directly and seem to shift when you're not paying attention.

But the worst part, the part that's been eating at me for months now, is what I've been noticing about the people who live closest to the canals.

It starts small. A slight pallor to the skin, barely noticeable unless you know what to look for. Then the eyes begin to change, not the color, but something deeper. A quality of attention, as if they're listening to something the rest of us can't hear. They become quiet, contemplative. They spend long hours sitting by the water, just watching it flow.

The changes are subtle enough that most folks don't notice. A wife might mention that her husband has been having odd dreams. A mother might worry that her child has grown too pale, too thin. But they explain it away: stress from work, a growth spurt, the changing seasons. People see what they want to see, especially when the alternative is too terrible to contemplate.

I might have continued in the same willful blindness if not for my daughter Clara.

Clara is fifteen, with her mother's dark hair and gentle eyes. She's always been a curious child, the sort who asks uncomfortable questions and refuses to accept simple answers. When she was small, she used to follow me to work sometimes, chattering about her lessons and her friends while I checked the gauges and cleared debris from the filters.

Those were happy times. Clara would sit on the stone walls of the channels, swinging her legs and making up stories about where the red water came from. Her favorite was that it was really liquid rubies, flowing down from a magical mountain where a kind dragon lived. I never had the heart to discourage her imagination.

But children grow up.

Three months ago, Clara began asking questions about my work that made me uncomfortable. She wanted to know why the water was really red. Why certain areas of the city had higher illness rates than others. Why the fish in our dinner came from outside markets rather than the harbor where the canals emptied.

I gave her the same explanations the city had given me—iron deposits, clay beds, natural geological processes. But Clara has always been cleverer than I gave her credit for. She started spending her free time at the city library, researching the history of Sangrevor's water system. She found old records, archived reports, newspaper clippings from the early days of the city.

She found things I wish she hadn't found.

Last week, she came to me with a leather-bound journal she'd discovered in the library's restricted section. It was the diary of Mr. Cross, Sangrevor's first Canal Keeper, dating back to the city's founding in 1634. His early entries were mundane enough, construction reports, flow measurements, complaints about his meager salary. But as the months progressed, his tone grew increasingly disturbed.

Clara read to me from entries that made my blood run cold:

*"The workers found something today while excavating the central channel.The architects want to seal it and continue construction, but the sounds... dear God, the sounds that echo up from those depths..."*

*"The red seepage has begun in earnest now. The city council insists it's a natural phenomenon, but I've seen the tests Dr. Harwick performed. This is no mineral deposit. This is something else entirely."*

*"I cannot sleep. The dreams come nightly now. I feel watched, measured, found wanting. Yesterday I caught my reflection in the canal water and for a moment... for a moment it was not my face looking back."*

The final entry was dated just three days before Cross's death. The official records state he drowned while performing routine maintenance, but his diary tells a different story:

*"It calls to me now, louder each day. The voice that speaks in the rushing of water, in the bubbling of air through liquid that is not quite liquid. I understand now what we have done. What we have built above. What we have been feeding all these years. The red tide rises."*

Clara finished reading and looked at me with eyes far too old for her fifteen years. "Dad," she said quietly, "what have we been drinking?"

I should have taken the journal away from her. Should have burned it and forbidden her from returning to the library. Should have packed our bags and left Sangrevor that very night.

Instead, I told her what I've been telling myself for twenty-three years: that the past is the past, and the water has been good to us. That whatever happened in Cross's time was different, and the city has learned to live in harmony with its peculiar resources.

But even as I spoke the words, I could taste the lie on my tongue. A metallic taste, like copper coins.

That night, I found Clara standing in our kitchen at half past midnight, a glass of thick canal water in her hands. She was staring into it with a expression I'd never seen before, a mixture of fascination and horror.

"Clara?" I whispered.

She looked up at me, and for just a moment, I saw something swimming in the depths of her dark eyes. Something pale and hungry.

"It's beautiful, Papa," she said, and raised the glass to her lips.

I knocked it from her hands before she could drink. The glass shattered against the kitchen floor, and the water spread in a crimson pool that seemed to writhe in the lamplight. As we both stared down at it, I could swear I heard something like laughter echoing up from the storm drains.

That was a week ago. Since then, I've been watching Clara carefully, and she's been watching me in return. During the day, she seems normal enough, helping with household chores, reading her books, and practising her letters. But at night, I hear her moving through the house with a purpose that chills me.

She stands at windows overlooking the canals. She whispers to herself in a language that sounds familiar but wrong, like words from a half-remembered dream. And sometimes, when she thinks I'm sleeping, she goes to the kitchen tap and lets the red water run through her fingers, cupping it in her palms and breathing in its vapors as if it were the sweetest perfume.

Yesterday morning, I found muddy footprints leading from her bedroom window to the main canal and back again. When I asked her about them, she smiled with lips that seemed too red and said she'd been sleepwalking.

I've been the Canal Keeper of Sangrevor for twenty-three years, and I've always done my job. I've kept the water flowing, filed my reports, and maintained the careful discretion that keeps our city's dark bargain intact. I've told myself that some secrets are worth keeping, that some prices are worth paying.

But now, as I write this by candlelight while listening to Clara whisper in the next room, I realize I may have been wrong. About the water. About the city. About what we've all been feeding for three centuries.

Tonight, I'm going to do something I've never done before. I'm going to miss work. Instead, I'm going to take my daughter far from Sangrevor, far from the red canals.

I only pray it's not already too late.

Because as I write these words, I can hear Clara's voice more clearly through the wall. She's not whispering to herself, as I first thought.

She's whispering back.

And the voice she's answering is coming from the pipes in the walls.
