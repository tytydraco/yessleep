Someone asked for an update on my first post, which you should probably read before this one: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/GTohACrIhc

I wish I had a better update than this, I really really do. But I’m really scared something bad happened to Mike and I don’t know where else to turn.  Maybe someone here will know what I should do? 

About a week ago  Mike asked Jim and I to meet him off campus. He said he wanted to show us a local coffee place with the best signature drink. I knew better than that; Mike would posted on Instagram or invited our entire friend group along if he was actually excited about some local gem he’d discovered. Mike was one of the most outgoing people I’ve ever met. If just Jim and were invited, something was wrong, and the pit forming in my stomach had a few guesses about what that something was. 

As I walked to the cafe with my head down, hands shoved moodily in my pockets, I let off a little steam under my breath. 

“Of course he couldn’t fucking drop it. I should have known this would happen. And now he’s gonna drag us all down with him because he’s gotta be some kind of hero,” I muttered to myself. I wasn’t actually that mad at him; I think I was mostly just upset by the shame he made me feel. Thinking back to this moment now I just feel even more guilt. 

When I got to the cafe, I saw Mike and Jim had already arrived and were sitting off to the side in a more secluded section of tables. I ordered the signature drink, because a rose and cardamom latte did genuinely sound pretty good, and walked over to them. 

Mike practically jumped out of his seat when I greeted him. That all but confirmed my suspicions about what we were actually doing here. I didn’t want to think about this again but it seemed important to my friend so I decided to literally grit my teeth and bare it. I was a coward, sure, and probably a bit selfish otherwise, but I was not a bad friend. Mike and Jim had been there for me on the worst night of our collective lives, and that bond felt inescapable at this point. 

So I sat down across from them reluctantly. As I did so, Mike began to write something on a napkin. He then slid it over to Jim and I. 

Phones off please

I looked over at Mike with an eyebrow raised and he responded by nodding grimly as if to confirm this was indeed, absolutely necessary. We did as we were told while Mike surveyed the room again with this anxious gaze. 

“Rose and cardamom Latte for Rachel!” The Barista called out and I felt my heart skip a beat. 

“Be right back,” I muttered. I tried to look and act normal as I approached the counter again but I knew I wasn’t doing a very good job of it. The workers seem completely unperturbed though and the barista serving me my drink just flashed me a classic customer service smile.

Once I was back at our table, Mike leaned as far forward as he could before whispering to us. “Y’all this goes so much deeper than I thought. This has something to do with Schmidts and their donations.” 

“The Schmidts?” I asked, recognizing the name because it was plaster all over campus. Our student center, an athletics building, even a parking garage, were all named after that wealthy family of graduates. I didn’t know much about them beyond that, though. 

Mike nodded. “They have some sort of… deal with the college. I couldn’t find anything in the official records but I traced the origin of the rumor. It seems to come from people who actually knew the most recent Schmidt to attend the college. He let a few things slip from time to time about just how powerful his family was.” 

I swallowed hard. That was absolutely not reassuring in the slightest. 

“Mike, are you saying…did a Schmidt…uh” Jim struggled with how to phrase his question in a public setting. 

Mike shrugged and said, “I don’t know, it’s possible it was one of them, but it’s also possible they were covering for someone else. I also learned that the family pulls strings to have their friends hired all the time. These people become untouchable. I have some guesses as to which professors and staff these friends of Schmidt are but like, the Schmidt’s aren’t the only ones doing this right.”

“So why do you think it was the Schmidt’s specifically then?” I challenged. 

“It’s one thing to be able to get a guy who’s horrible at teaching tenured, it’s entirely another to keep around someone, or multiple someones, who’re actively killing people and hiding them them on campus. Like I just think that’d take a much bigger bribe right? Also it has to have been someone who’s been around for A LONG time because of what we saw. The Schmidts go back three generations. There is no way for me to confirm it but, from where I’m standing, everything points to them being involved.” 

I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. I wasn’t certain I actually wanted to hear the answer to my next question. “Ok, so what are you planning to do now that you have this hunch?” 

“I have a big spread sheet of tenured professors. I’m not an expert but my guess is who ever did it had to have been here 20 or 30 years. I’m gonna dig up what info I can on anyone who fits the bill.” 

“Mike are doing all this on campus WiFi?” Jim asked with concern. 

“Don’t worry, I’m being really careful, I got a VPN. I do some of the snooping here on the cafe’s WiFi, I’m taking precautions to cover my steps.” 

Jim and I looked at each other for a moment, and it was clear he was as unconvinced as I was. 

“Mike, I am literally begging you, please, this isn’t worth risking your life over,” I hissed, sounding more annoyed than I had intended to. 

Mike sat back in the chair and crossed his arms over his chested before rolling his eyes. “I knew you’d be like this,” he muttered. 

I scoffed. “Like what? Like caring about my friend’s safety?!?” Raising my voice more than I meant to 

“That’s bullshit and you know it! Letting this go unsolved puts everyone on or near the campus in more danger, that includes a lot of your friends too!” Mike responded, matching my volume. 

“GUYS!” Jim whispered harshly. 

Mike and I looked a bit sheepish when realized how loud we’d gotten. 

“Someone is absolutely staring at us now,” Jim added, pointedly looking in the opposite direction. 

My eyes widened as Mike glanced over first. Then it was my turn to peak. 

Sure enough, a middle age man a few feet away was glaring at us with intensity. I recognized him as a professor of English. 

“Do you think he’s just annoyed we’re interrupting the peace?” I asked hopefully. 

Mike frowned and didn’t answer me directly. “That’s Professor Green, he’s definitely on my list.” 

I grimaced. “I was afraid you’d say that.” 

Mike looked first at me and then at Jim. “I don’t know if I’m safe, I don’t know what happens next, but I have to do this ok? I feel like I owe it to everyone here. This community let me be myself for the first time. I’m not going to let some jerks with money make everything feel unsafe again.“

Mike was originally from a small town in Kanas. He’s known all his life he was gay but hadn’t been able to come out until he got here. Our GSA student group was where he’d met me, Jim and most of our friends.  So we both knew just how sincere our friend was being in that moment. I also knew there was no way I was going to be able to talk him out of it. So I relented. 

“Just please please, be careful Mike. I need you to be there at lavender graduation. It wouldn’t be the same without you.” I murmured softly. 

“I love you guys, and I appreciate that you care about me. I’ll keep my head down, I promise.” He reached out across the table to touch each of our hands in reassurance. It made me want to burst into tears right then and there. 

I texted Mike as often as I could after that. We never talked about the situation, but he mentioned studying a lot which I assumed was his way of alluding to it. 

A few days ago he came to Jim and I with a request. 

“Did know there are walled off tunnels only accessible to maintenance workers?” 

We were once again at the cafe, seated in the tucked away the corner. This new information made me choke on my beverage momentarily. 

“Mike, are you… going to try to access these tunnels,” Jim asked quietly. 

Mike nodded. “And I can do it alone, but I’d appreciate at least a look out.” 

I glared at him for a moment. He knew he was asking for an impossible favor but what the hell else were we suppose to do? It’s not like we could let him go alone! 

Jim spoke first. “I’ll do it, but I’m not going in. I’ll keep watch outside.” 

“Ok but like, what if someone is already inside? Mike’s fucked if he’s alone.” I muttered. 

“So does that mean you’ll come into the tunnel with me?” Mike pushed. 

I groaned with irritation. “I want it to be known I think this is the worst idea I have ever heard, but I will go into the tunnel if it means Mike has more of a sporting chance to survive.”

Mike had gone to the lengths of printing out campus maps to help obscure his plan. 

He circled a little janitors closet off of the passage way that lead to the seldom used McBride parking garage. “We meet at this closet at 2am. Bring a helmet and protection. No phones just in case.” 

Protection? Did he mean a weapon? Like a gun or something? Was that even legal? I had a Swiss Army knife, but I doubted that do much of anything if we were actually in trouble. 

Mike interrupted my train of thought by adding, “I’m excited to try out picking locks, I’ve been teaching myself since we last might.” 

I put my hand over my face and sighed. “Of course you have.” 

I spent the rest of the evening debating if I should just stand Mike up and not go. I could fake sick, tell him my stomach hurts too much. That wouldn’t be a complete lie. I’d barely eaten in the last few days because being this anxious all the time was making me feel pretty miserable. I had become  so paranoid it was also hard to sleep. I wondered if Mike and Jim were feeling this awful too. Maybe that’s why Mike was being such an idiot. 

I decided I had to go through with it. I couldn’t abandon them. 

When I arrived at the closet, I was relieved to see that Mike had found a baseball bat to bring. I still didn’t know exactly what or who we  needed protection from but a bat would probably do a better job than anything I had managed to find.

Jim took his place against the wall and kept watch for any signs of trouble as Mike fiddled with the locked door. He asked me to try the knob a few times to test each attempt. It took almost 15 minutes for him to be successful, and by then he was practically drenched in sweat. The agonizing wait hadn’t been all that helpful for my anxiety either. When we got inside the closet we began to look for the way into the tunnel. I was in charge of holding an old fashioned flashlight this time. 

Mike scanned the back wall of the closet until he found a discolored panel. He pushed on the it and found it easily gave way. The panel fell into the deep inky blackness of what I could only assume was another tunnel. Mike motioned for me to hand him the flashlight for a second. He crawled through the opening first. I glanced back at the door to the McBride tunnel one last time before following him.

 It quickly became clear this wasn’t a normal disused passage. The walls were more shoddily constructed out of unpainted cinder blocks, and the ceiling had to be only about 5 feet tall. This was never meant to be for a main throughway for students. This was constructed by someone else, for another reason. I thought back to what Mike had said about only Schmidt’s having this much sway at the university.

Mike and I crept along, stooped over to avoid hitting our heads. The floor beneath us was only packed earth, and it was extremely uneven. 

We soon saw looming shapes in the darkness. They look like normal discarded boxes and crumpled sheets of cloth at first, but as we drew closer we started to see clearly that each object was stained with splashes of deep maroon.

When I noticed this, I stopped and I peered nervously over at Mike. He didn’t meet my gaze; instead he just kept moving forward. My shoulders slumped in defeat as I once again followed him. 

When I say Mike stumbled across a Machete, I mean he literally kicked it.  Mike looked down at the weapons, trying to make out a shape in the shadows while he waited for me to bring the flashlight closer. When I caught up to him, the large knife  became clear, as did the rusty coating of what looked like dried blood.

Mike took a large step back. His eyes were wide and I could his breathing quicken. I remembered him shouting at us last time to get out of there and was certain he was shouting the same thing internally at that moment. 

Mike balled his fists up and squeezed his eyes shut for a moment before whispering, “I can’t run away again. Someone has to get to the bottom of this.” 

I wanted to argue with him, to tell him to listen to part of his brain that said this wasn’t worth it. I knew, though, that to Mike, that would be a lie.  Anything was worth if it meant protecting the people around him. Anything was worth it to make his home safe again. 

We got to the edge of the blood soaked debris and stopped again. I shone the flashlight around, and notice the pile extended a ways back. Once again, I felt like I was only processing the scene around me in pieces. The larger pieces of hidden evidence were interspersed with glinting metal weapons. Everything from scalpels to pruning saws. I was beginning to notice that firearms were missing from the picture. It took a bit of processing to understand why, but now I think it indicates that the murderers were intentionally gruesome in their violence. A gun may have resulted in just too clean and quick a death. 


What felt like the sharpest kick in the stomach for me, though, was a dorm mattress ripped to shreds. It looked just like the one I slept on every night. I could more vividly imagine the terror the victim must have felt as an attacker pinned them to it and drove a knife in over and over again. Once again the image of the dead kid my own age intruded on my thoughts. Was this how he died?

There was no way in hell all this was from just the bodies we’d already seen. There had to be remnants from dozens of crimes present here.

Mike’s hand was over his mouth as he tried to process the additional information before him.  He shifted so his fingers were interlaced behind his head. “There is no way this was all done by just one person.” 

With dawning horror I was beginning to realize just how right Mike had been. No one was safe on or around campus, not at this scale of methodical and deliberate carnage.  

“What the hell do we do?” I asked earnestly, looking at Mike. Tears stung at my eyes. I refused to let them fall, though. Not now, not here. 

Mike took a deep breath before meeting my gaze. “I’ll figure it out Rachel, I promise. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Somehow.” Mike sounded like he was still trying to convince himself that was really possible. I had to swallow hard to choke down a sob. 

We debrief Jim in the janitors closet. He was glad he had chosen not to go inside. The three of us worked to replace the panel on the wall and obscure our entry. 

That night I stayed in Mike and Jim’s dorm room again. It felt like tradition at this point; I guess sleep overs are mandatory after seeing that much world shattering horror. 

I woke up the next morning to Jim shouting at an RA. I wasn’t sure I’d ever heard him this angry before in my life. 

“What do you mean he’s already in custody? He was literally just here!” 

I propped myself up so I could see what was going on. A few of the res life folks that worked in our building were going through and packing Mike’s belongings into boxes. His bed was already stripped, with just a bare mattress remaining. I shuddered as the image of the identical blood stained one flashed in my mind.

“What’s going on?” I asked blearily. 

Jim’s attention shifted to me and he softened a bit. “Rachel they came in while we were still asleep. They told me that Mike’s been expelled and arrested for breaking and entering. They’re planning to mail his belongings back to his parents.” 

I swiftly sat up fully on my cot. “What?!? They can’t just do that!” 

Jim shrugged defeatedly as the RAs appeared to be pointedly ignoring me. “I tried to say the same thing, but this order is apparently something even the president’s weighed in on.”

My mind raced as I tried to figure out who had ratted Mike out. Was it Dr. Green? Someone else at the Cafe? Was someone tracking Mike’s online actions? Where had we been to sloppy?

I looked at Jim and another train of thought hit me. Why was only Mike fingered? Why were Jim and I still standing here? I felt my blood run cold as I wondered if they took Mike as a warning to us.  Keep going and you’re next. Taking us all meant more loose strings, maybe? more cops to pay off? Judges to bribe? 

Well if he really was actually in Jail. I realized I couldn’t be sure of that either given everything that I knew now. Fuck, was Mike dead? 

Still in my Pajamas I stood up abruptly. I marched over to Jim and grabbed his hand. Glaring at the RAs and other university minions I growled, “Let’s get out of here.” Jim opened his mouth to protest but when my glare snapped over to him he shut it. 

He sighed dejectedly and muttered, “ok just let me grab my coat…” 

At my insistence, Jim and I caught a bus and rode down to another coffee shop I was familiar with. I was hoping that getting some distance would mean we could loose any tail that was tracking us. 

While on the bus, Jim got a call from Mike’s mom. She was worried because she had heard Mike was arrested but couldn’t get any other information. Jim repeated what the RAs had said and found out that no one had actually been able to reach Mike at the station. Mike’s mom had also called a lawyer they knew but even he was hitting more hurdles than they expected.  

When Jim hung up, we spend the rest of the bus ride just staring straight ahead, completely checked out and each lost in our own thoughts.

It was only after we got into the coffee shop and ordered that I let myself cry. I buried my head in my arms and just sobbed. I felt an occasional reassuring squeeze of my arm from Jim who looked like he was still struggling not to dissociate.

I couldn’t stay on campus after that. So Jim and I found some ratty old Motel to rent a cramped room in. That’s where I’m writing this now.

I need to save Mike, and he’s right I need to protect the others too. But I am so fucking scared, it feels paralyzing. 

Have we already run out of time?
