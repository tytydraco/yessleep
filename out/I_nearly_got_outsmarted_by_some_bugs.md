Last weekend I had Monday off, so I went for a little backpacking trip. I don’t think I want anyone to go looking for this, so all I’m going to say is that I was somewhere in the PNW. Anyways, I was going to drive to the trailhead Saturday morning, camp for two nights, and be back in my car by Monday afternoon. There’s not much to say about the start, I hit the trailhead, it was raining lightly, it was quite pleasant. I had changes of clothes anyways, so I didn’t put on my jacket, I just let myself get rained on. But, a few miles in, I looked just the right way and spotted this rundown shack. It was a few hundred feet off the bend in the trail and only the top of the roof was visible, there was a ridge obscuring the rest of it, so it had probably been easy to miss for some time. After a calm drive in and a calm hike so far, I was actually starting to feel a little restless, and thought I might as well have a look, though there’s honestly usually not much to see in abandoned places like that at least in my opinion.  
  
  
It was a weird building, I couldn’t really call it a shack anymore. I was expecting it to be one floor, but as I came over the ledge I realized it was a skinny two-story building. It had a slanted wooden roof covered with some sort of finish only on the top. Whoever made this, altogether it felt like a pretty lazy job. I don’t even know what they used to cut the wood– the surface of the planks everywhere seemed bumpy and uneven, and some spots were rotting even in the inside from the humidity. Anyways, I tested my footing as I stepped in. I could see that the floor was probably a few inches off the ground, there was some grass growing through the cracks. I don’t even know how you were supposed to get up to the second floor, I think there had to have used to been a rope or something on the outside, the tallest wall up there was open. I was thinking about trying to climb up there, but I am glad I didn’t.  
  
  
The inside was about ten by ten, and there was really nothing else to say of the construction, no furniture, no storage, no tools hung up. But by the wall opposite the doorway there were the bones of a deer. It started to freak me out a little because the bones were arranged roughly in the shape of the animal. How did they end up like that? Did someone clean a deer and then set it back up like this? It didn’t seem like the work of an animal. The bones were not all the way clean, though I guess dried enough to not smell much anymore. I decided hey, if I was here anyways I wanted to take a closer look, and I started to take a few steps across the room towards it. Then everything went to shit.  
  
  
As I got closer, a few of those big fuckoff ants showed up out of the floorboard behind me and were crawling vaguely towards my feet. I don’t like bugs, but I admit I always feel a little guilty if I shoosh one, and not thinking too much I stepped forward more. I was distracted, and generally feeling uneasy, and I blame on that that I didn’t notice the rotten floorboards not… quite holding as I shifted my weight. I felt my stomach drop and it was too late as it gave surprisingly quickly below me– there was a crunch as the board below me landed about half a foot below on the ground. I remember, in that moment right after, I was feeling a little on edge, but mostly just stupid. Then suddenly, I thought I felt something maybe drop in my hair, and then an ant definitely landed on my shoulder. I turned to look at it, as I did another one fell on my shoulder and I guess I did some subconscious calculation and realized something very wrong was happening.  
  
  
The one on my shoulder bit me and it was a searing pain worse than a bee sting. In my infinite grace I freaked out, trying to step and brush them off me at the same time, and caught my ankle on the still level board behind me. I stumbled and poorly braced myself with my arms as I landed on my back, looking up to see this… rain of ants start to pour down from the cracks in the floorboards above. The instant I landed, I should have flipped around and thrown myself out of the house, but I was in shock, and for a critical moment I just stared up at the ceiling in awe. I remember I was screaming. I remember noticing that my body couldn’t decide if it was worse to close my eyes, or try keeping them open. The second they were on me, they bit me, through my clothes if they had to, and every time it felt like I had been shot.  
  
  
I think there were literally thousands falling onto me. Impressively, they were mostly dropping in the part of the room onto where I had landed rather than beside me, I guess they were reacting to the noise of each impact. It had started in a trickle at the first time and after I fell they were now committing to a downpour onto the space where I had landed. Okay, I’m going to remind you again that these were those big fuckoff ants, the ones that can run pretty fast, and so it really wasn’t that long that I was down on the floor before they were to my arms. Picture a stick dropped in a thin film of water– the water rises up around the stick trying to attach to it as much as possible. They were coming right away from the floorboards beneath me or running towards me once they landed.  
  
  
Come to think of it, I didn’t think ants could even see well enough to run towards something if there wasn’t a trail. They were heavy enough that I could feel them piling not only around my arms but even against my shirt. As I recovered from the shock and tried to get myself back up, I found I could barely make my arms move. If most of my body hadn’t been covered, I probably wouldn’t have made it out, but besides the arms not enough of them could bite me. I was able to use my legs to turn myself over, and sort of dump myself onto my elbows. Somewhere in the struggle I remember dumbly blowing at my arms trying to get them off. It was hard to move at all from the amount of pain I was in, but I managed to pull in my feet below me and stand up. I was screaming my lungs out and praying to god I didn’t pass out and I just bolted out of there.  
  
  
My arms were useless by that point and I realized I couldn’t even feel them, they had gone not only limp but numb. There was a stream downhill and I just headed for that. Near the edge it was steep and muddy, I slipped on the way in and just fell back against the muddy bank, walking crouched down in the stream like an idiot until I got somewhere I could lie sideways and fit all of myself underwater. Managing to hold my breath for a few seconds, the pain did not at all stop but it seemed the bites had, I stuck myself out of the water and thank fuck the ants had come off. I remembered I was worried I was going to pass out, and sat myself up at the edge of the river to just catch my breath. I got jumpscared by a few survivors under my pant legs, but I was able to get moving and I hightailed it back towards my car. I was feeling fine again for the first hour, but then I started to feel unwell in a different way.  
  
  
The ant bites had just hurt where I was bit, but now my head hurt and my entire body felt like something was wrong. It’s hard to explain if you haven’t been poisoned before. It felt like “slow doom”, is the best way I think I could phrase it. I got to the trailhead and luckily found a couple setting up for the day. I tried to put on a casual enough face asking them for help, but I guess with the arms and everything they weren’t buying it and rushed me out of there to the closest hospital. I probably owe my life to them, because I was feeling even worse hours later when I finally got to the hospital. I guess I could have stood over my phone dangling my limp arm until I spelled 911, if I could even get my phone out of my pocket.  
  
  
I’ve been typing this with my left hand. More of them ended up on my right side, and while feeling and movement in the left arm has made slow progress (You’re welcome for me fixing every stupid typo. I could barely use my left hand before this.) the doctors have been… iffy bout the right. They said they had actually had a few patients with severe ant bites this year, and that based on those cases, it was hard to say how things would go over the next few months. I was kind of surprised to hear they had others besides me– I looked it up and supposedly ants kill about 30 people a year, and estimating from that I feel like this one hospital shouldn’t have that many accidents, right? I bugged them more, but none of them really wanted to talk about it.  
  
  
So, since my doctors aren’t telling me anything, have any of you heard of something like this? I know ants can do some clever things, but… these guys “ambushed” an animal as big as me, and they used a structure they found to hide. I haven’t found anything elsewhere online yet, but I’m going to keep looking.
