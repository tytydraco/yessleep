The late afternoon sun filtered through the trees as I guided our SUV along the winding forest road. Sky sat beside me, her fingers idly tapping on the armrest. The kids were unusually quiet in the back, Russ absorbed in his game and Pandora gazing out the window.

"You know," Sky said, breaking the comfortable silence, "my grandmother used to tell me the strangest stories about these woods."

I glanced at her, curious. "Oh yeah? What kind of stories?"

She shrugged, a small smile playing on her lips. "Oh, just old folktales. People going for hikes and coming back... different."

"Different how?" I asked, my hands tightening slightly on the steering wheel.

"It's silly, really," Sky said, waving her hand dismissively. "But she always warned us to be careful in the forest. Said our family had a special connection to it."

I chuckled, though something in her tone made me uneasy. "Sounds like typical grandparent superstition."

Sky's eyes met mine for a moment, and I could have sworn I saw something flicker in their depths. "Maybe. But you have to admit, there's something about this place that feels... alive."

As if on cue, a gust of wind rustled through the trees, making the branches sway in an almost deliberate manner. I suppressed a shiver.

"Dad, are we there yet?" Russ called from the back, momentarily breaking the tension.

"Almost, buddy," I replied, grateful for the interruption.

Sky placed her hand on my arm, her touch inexplicably cool. "I'm sure we'll be fine," she said softly. "After all, it's just a camping trip, right?"

I nodded, pushing down the nagging feeling of unease. "Right. Just a normal, fun family weekend."

As we rounded the final bend towards the campground, I couldn't shake the feeling that Sky knew more than she was letting on. But surely, I told myself, it was just my imagination running wild. What could possibly go wrong on a simple camping trip?

 Towering pines surrounded a clearing dotted with picnic tables and fire pits. A serene lake shimmered in the distance, its surface like polished glass in the fading light.

"We're here!" I announced, forcing cheer into my voice. Pandora perked up, while Russ barely grunted in acknowledgment.

We pulled into our assigned spot, a secluded area at the edge of the campground. As I stepped out of the car, I noticed a light mist beginning to form near the ground. Odd for this time of year, I thought, but brushed it off as a quirk of the local microclimate.

"Alright, team Vanderhouven," I said, clapping my hands together. "Let's get this campsite set up before it gets dark."

We fell into our usual roles with practiced ease. Sky and I wrestled with the tent while Russ and Pandora gathered kindling for the fire. As we worked, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was... off. The forest seemed unusually quiet, the typical evening chorus of birds and insects noticeably absent.

"Hey, Sky," I whispered, not wanting to alarm the kids. "Does something feel strange to you?"

She paused, a tent stake in hand, and looked around. "Now that you mention it, it is awfully quiet. But that's probably good, right? Means we have the place to ourselves."

I nodded, trying to convince myself she was right. Yet the silence felt oppressive, as if the forest itself was holding its breath.

As the last light faded from the sky, we gathered around the campfire. The flames cast dancing shadows on the surrounding trees, and the mist had thickened slightly, curling around our ankles like a living thing. I suppressed a shiver.

"Who wants to hear a scary story?" Sky asked, her face illuminated by the flickering firelight.

Pandora squealed with delight while Russ rolled his eyes, though I could see the hint of a smile tugging at his lips.

Sky launched into a tale of a haunted forest, her voice rising and falling with practiced dramatics. As she spoke, I found my gaze drawn to the edge of our campsite, where the mist seemed to be growing denser. For a moment, I could have sworn I saw shapes moving within it, but when I blinked, there was nothing but swirling vapor.

"Dad, are you okay?" Pandora's voice snapped me back to the present. "You look scared."

I forced a laugh. "Just getting into the spirit of the story, sweetheart. Your mom's quite the storyteller."

As the night wore on, we roasted marshmallows and shared stories of past family adventures. The unease I'd felt earlier began to fade, replaced by the warm glow of familial love. This was what we'd come here for, I reminded myself. These precious moments of connection.

When it came time for bed, we crowded into the tent, a tangle of sleeping bags and limbs. As I drifted off to sleep, lulled by the soft breathing of my family, I felt truly at peace for the first time in months.

I awoke with a start, unsure of what had roused me. The tent was pitch black, and an unnatural silence pressed in from all sides. I fumbled for my phone, the screen's harsh light momentarily blinding me. 3:33 AM.

A soft whimper from Pandora's sleeping bag drew my attention. She was twitching in her sleep, her face contorted in distress. A nightmare, I thought, reaching out to comfort her.

But as my hand touched her shoulder, her eyes snapped open. In the dim light of my phone, they looked... wrong. Too dark, too deep.

"Pandora?" I whispered. "Are you okay, sweetie?"

She sat up slowly, her movements stiff and unnatural. When she spoke, her voice was flat, devoid of its usual childish lilt. "The mist is calling, Daddy. Can't you hear it?"

A chill ran down my spine. "What do you mean, honey? What mist?"

But she had already laid back down, her breathing once again slow and even. I told myself it was just a strange sleep-talking episode, but the unease from earlier returned tenfold.

Unable to shake my disquiet, I unzipped the tent flap and peered outside. The campsite was enveloped in a thick, swirling mist that seemed to glow faintly from within. The trees at the edge of our site were barely visible, their outlines distorted and shifting in ways that defied natural explanation.

I rubbed my eyes, certain I must be seeing things. But when I looked again, the scene remained unchanged. And then I heard it â€“ a low, pulsing hum that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at once.

"Sky," I hissed, shaking my wife gently. "Sky, wake up. Something's wrong."

She stirred, mumbling incoherently. As she opened her eyes, I saw the same wrongness I'd noticed in Pandora's gaze. Her pupils were dilated to impossible proportions, leaving only a thin ring of iris visible.

"What's the matter, Alex?" she asked, her voice distorted as if speaking underwater. "Don't you want to join us in the mist?"

My heart began to race. This couldn't be happening. It had to be a dream, a nightmare brought on by Sky's scary story and my earlier unease.

I pinched myself hard, willing myself to wake up. But the pain was real, sharp and immediate.

"This isn't funny, Sky," I said, my voice trembling. "What's going on?"

She smiled, but it wasn't her smile. It was too wide, revealing too many teeth. "Oh, Alex," she said, her voice now a chorus of whispers. "We've only just begun."

As if on cue, Russ and Pandora sat up in perfect unison, their eyes as black and fathomless as Sky's. The mist began to seep into the tent, bringing with it that pulsing, maddening hum.

I scrambled backward, my mind reeling. This couldn't be real. As my back pressed against the tent wall, I felt it give way, not to the solid ground outside, but to a yawning void that seemed to pull at my very essence.

The last thing I saw before I fell into that impossible abyss was my family's faces, their features melting and reforming into something utterly alien and terrifying.

As I plummeted through layers of reality, each more nightmarish than the last, one thought echoed in my mind: The camping trip was only the beginning. The true horror of the Vanderhouven curse was about to unfold.
