I gently swirled my red wine in the stemless glass, and let out a long sigh.

It had been a really long week, and I was exhausted, so I decided to splurge a little and pick up a nice bottle of wine on my way back from work – Malbec, the best. I took a sip as I walked over to the back patio door and slid it open, letting in the cool autumn air. 

It was my favourite time of year – late enough in the season that the heavy heat of summer was just about gone, but still early enough that the leaves on the trees were just reaching the peak of their golden yellows, deep oranges and vibrant reds. The large and secluded backyard looked like a painting. It was beautiful.

After watching a single sunset yellow leaf lilt softly to the ground, I checked my watch.

6:13pm.

Good, I still had time. My darling Michael worked until 8pm on Fridays.

I turned back towards the kitchen and began to make my way upstairs, placing my wine glass on the kitchen island beside the ornate burgundy wine bottle.

As I walked down the short hallway towards the stairs, I admired the photos and paintings that hung on the wall and paused briefly. There was a picture of Michael posed on a lush green golf course with his buddy. He looked so handsome in this picture, and I stop and stare at it every time I walk by.

After admiring the photo for a minute, I continued down the hallway, now taking in the expensive looking artwork. I always loved how the textures and colours of the artwork contrasted, yet complimented, the refurbished wooden wall panelling of the main floor. The whole house had a rustic and farm-house type of vibe. It always felt so cozy and comforting, I adored it here.

The staircase was a beautiful plank style with 16 steps, all featuring a unique knotted wood pattern. Steps 2, 5 and 15 had the tendency to creak loudly, so I usually tried to avoid them, but I was here alone so I didn’t bother.

As I reached the top of the stairs, I thought of which pair of Michael’s oversized sweatpants and hoodie I wanted to throw on. All of his clothes were so comfortable, and they always smelled like him. I was so excited to change and continue enjoying my delicious wine with a little snack, it was my favourite time of the day.

I walked to the end of the upstairs hallway and into the master bedroom. As I moved passed the bed and towards the walk-in closet, I stripped of my blazer and placed it on the armchair in the corner of the room. My armpits and shoulders shivered with relief. Curse my manager, who insisted on purchasing our work wear from the cheapest place possible. The pants weren’t any better. The whole set was a starchy and stiff polyester mess.

I walked over to the bedroom window that faced out towards the isolated street and slide open the pane, feeling a light gust flow into the room and taking in another deep breath.

The only downside to leaving the summer season behind, was the sun setting earlier. One of the few things about summer that I actually enjoyed, were the long days and the glowing sunlight you’d get late into the evening. At this point, the sun was still up but it was setting, and it was too dark in the closet to see. So I flicked on the closet light.

I eagerly scanned the closet, looking for a comfy set to change into. There was navy blue fleece set hanging near the back.

“Perfect,” I whispered to myself.

I grabbed the hoodie off the hanger and was about to throw it on over my tank top, when I heard a faint sound outside. I paused, and listened.

Faintly, but quickly growing louder, it sounded like foot steps approaching the front door. But I wasn’t expecting anyone. Not at this time of the evening. I felt a brief sting of anxiety in my chest, and my mind began to spin a little bit.

I’m over reacting. I’m sure it’s nothing.

I tried to calm myself down, reasoning that it could just be a delivery guy or someone dropping off mail. And this reasoning worked, for about 10 seconds.

The footsteps never walked away from the front door, and shortly after, I heard someone fiddling with the lock and handle. My breath caught in my throat.

No, it’s fine. I had engaged the deadbolt on the front door. It maybe wasn’t much, but I’m sure it would hold. 

I realized it was likely dark enough outside that you could see the closet light through the window. I didn’t want anyone to know I was here, so before a second thought, I reached over to the switch and flicked it off.

I quickly realized I shouldn’t have done that.

As soon as the light flicked off, the sound outside stopped, and it felt like everything in the world froze. There was complete silence.

Then, the sound picked back up at a frenzied speed. And shortly after, I heard the lock click open and repetitive pushing on the handle and door.

“It’s okay. You’re okay.” I said out loud, reminding myself that the deadbolt was engaged.

That’s when I heard them start shoulder checking the front door. Throwing themselves at it to try and break through the deadbolt. My heart began racing, and I broke out in a cold sweat.

Three… Four… Five times. A pause. Then after a few seconds, I heard the footsteps quickly move away from the front door. After a moment of quiet, I realized I was holding my breath, and I let it out in a light-headed huff.

I was hoping this meant they’d given up. I didn’t hear any more noises in the front yard, but I was too nervous to walk to the window to check. I just stood stunned, standing half in and half out of the closet, trying to figure out what to do.

In the midst of my panicked brain jumble, I heard something that made the blood freeze in my veins – heavy boots stomping up the stairs of the back deck.

The back door.

I didn’t check if the screen door was locked when I slid open the glass. But really, what would it even matter if it was? It was a screen door.

Turns out, it didn’t matter at all. It was unlocked.

As soon as I heard the familiar glide of the screen door as it opened and those heavy bootsteps hit the hardwood floor, I sprang into action.

I dropped the hoodie where I stood, and ran to the bedroom doorway.

I had to hide. But where?

I looked back at the closet. Then at the bed. And over to the ensuite bathroom.

No, all of those are too obvious. He’d find me in a second. I had to figure out something better, and fast.

Thankfully, he chose to search the main floor first, which gave me a few extra seconds to collect my thoughts.

I stepped out into the hallway and observed my options.

The bedroom was out. I’d easily be found in there, plus I’d be stuck at the far end of the hall with nowhere to go.

The den to my left had a closet, and a big trunk. I could fit in either spot, but they’re also too obvious and I would again be stuck at the end of the hall.

There was a guest bedroom towards the stairs on the right, and there was a bathroom near the top of the stairs to the left.

I heard the footsteps getting louder again. They were heading this way.

I was sweating. My heart was racing and my brain felt like it was buzzing.

I made a quick decision to hide in the bathroom. I hurried down the hall as quietly as I could and slipped into the bathroom. I heard the footsteps getting louder as they charged down the hallway towards the stairs.

I frantically looked around the small room and realized, I may have made the wrong choice. There was virtually nowhere to hide.

The glass pane shower wouldn’t provide much cover. No good.

The vanity had solid drawers and no forgiving hiding space around or behind it. No good either.

I heard the creak of the second step. They were coming up.

I looked to my right and saw the slim closet door, and I felt a glimmer of hope. But as I opened the closet door, my hope disappeared. I saw shelving from top to bottom.

I almost couldn’t hear the footsteps over my own heartbeat.

As I desperately scanned the closet, I noticed the bottom shelf was placed higher than the others, leaving a bigger space between it and the floor.

I heard the creak of the fifth step. They were almost halfway up.

Thankfully, I’m on the smaller side, so I kneeled down and shifted the stacks of toilet paper over as far as I could, then squished myself into the cubby space. I barely fit, my knees pressed to my chest so tightly I could only take quick and shallow breaths. Damn these pants.

I was able to slide the folding door closed right as I heard the creak from the fifteenth step. They were at the top of the stairs.

The bootsteps stop right outside the bathroom doorway. They’d paused, like they were listening. After some time, I heard them shift and turn into the bathroom.

I tried to keep my breath from catching, and it was taking every ounce of willpower not to shift my cramped and uncomfortable body.

As he stepped past the closet, my heart skipped a beat as I saw the glint of a steel bat through the slatted spaces in the door. It hung still by his side.

It was clear there was no place for someone to hide anywhere in the bathroom, except for maybe the closet. I was praying he would assume no one would be able to fit in here and would leave it alone.

He stood in the bathroom for what felt like forever, then finally, he turned and walked out. I had to fight to not let out a breath of air in relief.

I listened as the footsteps move across the hall and into the guest bedroom, where I heard him opening closet doors and rummaging under the bed. I almost took this chance to open the closet door and make a dash downstairs, but as soon as my fingers slid into the slats to slide the door open, he came stomping back out. I yanked my fingers back inside the closet, and watched him turn and move on to the next room.

Once I heard his footsteps quiet down a little as he moved away, I took my chance. I slid open the closet door and crawled out, careful not to hit anything while I did. I carefully peeked around the corner of the bathroom doorway to try and see what room he was in.

It was hard to tell, but I think he was in the den.

I slowly stood and crept towards the stairs, being mindful to skip step 15. I could hear him still rummaging around in whatever room he was in.

After a few more steps, I thought I heard him moving back out to the hallway and I quickened my pace. But, in my focused listening, I had miscounted the steps.

As I took the next step down, I was mortified to hear a loud creak from the step. I froze. So did he.

There was total silence for a few seconds, then the storm of his bootsteps came thundering out into the hallway.

I leapt to the bottom of the stairs, skipping the last 4, and sprinted down the hall and into the kitchen. As I ran by, I grabbed my shoes that were tucked beside the island and bounded out the back door.

Still hearing the loud boots behind me, I jumped down the deck stairs and took a sharp right. I ran towards the bushes and brush at the side of the backyard and basically dove behind them.

I thought he would keep chasing me, and I was ready to run, but I instead heard the glass door being slammed shut and locked.

I sat in the dirt, taking a few deep breaths to calm down. I slid on my shoes. Once my ears stopped pounding, I made my way to the front yard. I found a large tree to sneak behind, and after another deep breath, I poked my head around it.

I looked up to the window to the master bedroom and saw Michael standing there, looking out into the front yard. His face twisted in fear and confusion. He was holding his navy blue fleece hoodie in one hand, and my blazer in the other.

I realized in my fluster, I’d forgotten to grab my blazer from the armchair in the bedroom.

But that’s okay, you can keep it for now. I’ll get it next time I visit.

I smiled, and felt my heart flutter.

That was a fun little curveball you threw at me Michael, coming home early.

Looks like I'll need to keep a closer eye on you.

I hope the wine doesn’t go to waste. It was very expensive.

I’ll see you soon, my darling Michael.
