There’s something about old things that carry a weight to them—like they’ve soaked up the stories of everyone who’s touched them, collecting all the pain, sorrow, and joy they’ve ever known. This jar… it was different. It held more than just dust and forgotten memories.

It started when Mrs. Thompson, my next-door neighbor, handed it to me one morning, her hands trembling. “A gift,” she said, her eyes never quite meeting mine. I didn’t ask where it came from, just took it out of politeness. It was small, heavy, and cold, made of dark green glass. The swirling patterns etched into its surface seemed almost alive, twisting in ways that made my skin crawl.

I placed it on my kitchen windowsill, not thinking much of it. That night, as I lay in bed nursing bruises from yet another one of *his* episodes, I heard something strange. A soft whisper, like wind through broken glass, filled the room. I sat up, scanning the darkness, but found nothing out of place. I told myself it was just my imagination—until I saw the jar.

It had moved.

The jar, which I distinctly remembered setting in the kitchen, now sat on my dresser, glowing faintly under the moonlight. I should’ve screamed, thrown it out, done anything but what I did next.

I touched it.

As soon as my fingers grazed the glass, a cold sensation shot up my arm, freezing me in place. Images flashed before my eyes—men, husbands, all from our neighborhood. They were familiar, but their faces were twisted in fear, their mouths open in silent screams. I saw their wives too, their faces hollow and gaunt, just like mine had become over the years. I pulled my hand away, gasping for breath, and the whispers stopped.

The next day, news spread quickly. Mr. Jameson from down the street had fallen from his attic and broken his neck. His wife, a woman who had always worn long sleeves to hide the bruises, was left alone—smiling for the first time in years. The whispers returned that night, louder this time, but I didn’t touch the jar. I was too scared to.

By the third night, the jar had moved again, this time to the foot of my bed. I lay awake, waiting. I didn’t have to wait long.

It was him.

He came home late, drunk, as always. I heard the door slam, his heavy footsteps, the slurred curses. But as he staggered into the bedroom, the jar began to hum, a low, vibrating sound that seemed to come from everywhere at once. He didn’t notice at first, but then… then he did.

His eyes locked onto it, and for a moment, he froze, as if something unseen had taken hold of him. His face twisted in confusion, then fear. He reached out, his hand trembling like mine had when I first touched the cursed glass. But the moment he touched it, the whispers grew into screams—horrifying, blood-curdling screams that filled the room. He dropped to his knees, clutching his head, writhing in agony.

I watched, frozen, as dark tendrils of mist seeped from the jar, wrapping around his body. His screams turned to gurgles, and then… silence. His body collapsed, lifeless, crumpled at the foot of the bed. I could still hear the whispers, faint now, fading into the night.

The jar was back on the windowsill the next morning, as if nothing had happened. I stared at it, wondering how something so small could carry such an overwhelming sense of dread. But there was no question now.

It was cursed.

And I wasn’t the only one who knew it.

Two more men in the neighborhood died over the next week—each of them known for the cruelty they inflicted behind closed doors. No one mourned them, not really. I could see the change in their wives, in their faces. They were free. And I… I was free too.

The jar still sits on my windowsill. It hasn’t moved since *he* died, but I can still hear it sometimes, whispering in the dead of night. I don’t know if it’s done yet, if its hunger for vengeance has been satisfied.

But I do know one thing for sure: every man in this neighborhood with blood on his hands should be afraid.

Because the jar is watching.

And it’s waiting.
