The verdant hills rolled past my window as we drove down the dusty dirt road into town, and as we passed I let myself admire them. If nothing else, this place was beautiful… Maybe I could call it home for a little while…

&#x200B;

“That’s the Donaldson farm.” Joel said from the drivers seat beside me, “I used to play with their son, Joey back when we were kids!”

“You think he’s still in town?” I asked, “Maybe you two could reconnect.”

“Oh, probably.” He replied, “I imagine most of the people I grew up with are still around. The community was always pretty tight knit.”

&#x200B;

I caught myself shifting uneasily and Joel gave me a reassuring smile.

“Don’t worry hun, I know you’ll fit right in.” He said, “You know, Mom just can’t wait to see you again!”

“Yeah, I can’t wait to see her either.” I lied. I think Joel saw right through it, but he didn’t say anything. He just kept up that warm, reassuring smile of his… It was one of the things I loved the most about him.

&#x200B;

I imagined it wasn’t any easier for him to move back home than it was for me… He’d never talked a lot about his hometown or his family. I didn’t get the impression that there was any bad blood between them or anything, Joel had always said he’d moved out of state for school, and stayed out of state for work. I’d figured that he just wanted his independence. A chance to be his own man. I could understand that. I loved my family, but I wouldn’t have gone back to live with them unless I had absolutely no other choice.

&#x200B;

I’d met Joel’s family either before or at the wedding of course. His brother had come down to visit a few times and his Mom and Sister had come down for the wedding. They’d seemed like nice enough people, and his mother seemed friendly. A little socially awkward, but friendly… I just wasn’t particularly thrilled about moving in with her. That said, I also wasn’t going to say no either. Even before Joel and I had gotten engaged, I’d known that his mother wasn’t in the best of health. I’d seen it firsthand at the wedding. The photos he’d shown me of her in her younger years bore almost no resemblance to the massive woman with red and scabbed eczema along her arms who’d clung to her walker with shaking hands. We’d needed to seat her close to a wall socket so she could plug in her oxygen tank. She was only in her sixties, but somehow seemed so much older.

&#x200B;

I wasn’t entirely sure what was wrong with her. Joel had told me, but I could never recall the exact name of the disease. I only knew that it was in her lungs. Even a year ago at the wedding, I felt an uneasy certainty that she didn’t have much time left in her… And what kind of wife would I be if I didn’t let Joel be there for her in what could’ve been her final days? If I kept him from her, he would’ve hated me for it and he would’ve been right to. I would’ve hated myself for it…

&#x200B;

I’d told Joel that he had my wholehearted support. I said I’d be with him no matter what, and if that meant delaying our plans for a couple of years to help his mother, then that was what we’d do. I wasn’t just saying that to be kind either. I truly meant it. I’ve always believed that family is one of the most important things. Besides, we could afford to wait for a little while, couldn’t we? Joel and I were both working from home and had more or less steady employment, so really this would benefit us in the long run. We’d save up as much money as we could and when it was time to move on, we’d be in an excellent situation to do it. Moving from Philadelphia to a small town in Alabama was a pretty big change… But I wanted to make the best of it. I wanted to try and see it as a new adventure. The first blank page of an unknown chapter of my life, full of possibilities. Every dark cloud always has a silver lining, right? And it was getting easier and easier to see that silver lining as we drove in to Smokey Falls.

&#x200B;

There was something so beautiful about the hills and the farmland. It all felt so serene and tranquil. It was nothing I’d never seen before, but here it all felt so new.

&#x200B;

The only thing that ruined it was the sign. As we drove into town, I remember us driving past it. It was a somewhat gaudy looking thing that read:

&#x200B;

*Welcome to Smokey Falls.*

*One Society, United in Jesus Christ under God*

&#x200B;

I’m not opposed to religion or anything. I went to a catholic school when I was growing up. I even sang in the choir. But I’ve sorta avoided it over the years. There’s too much of a negative connotation with it. I don’t think that religion is necessarily a bad thing. But there’s some crazies out there who take it way too far.

&#x200B;

I guess I shouldn’t have been too surprised though. We were deep in the Bible Belt, and I’d seen plenty of religious billboards on the drive over. But seeing it on the towns sign seemed to bug me a little bit. I’m not really sure how else to describe it. I suppose I can’t help but feel a little put off when someone pushes God in your face like that, there’s something very insincere about it.

&#x200B;

Joel had told me long ago that he’d come from a pretty religious town. But it wasn’t until I saw that sign that the reality of it slapped me right in the face. I was moving into Gods country… That shouldn’t have unnerved me as much as it did.

&#x200B;

I tried not to dwell too much on it, and tried instead to focus on the lovely scenery. Spring flowers blossomed along the side of the road and beyond that was nothing but forest and rolling hills as far as the eye could see.

&#x200B;

“We’re almost home.” Joel said to me, and I couldn’t help but think that he sounded a little excited. I smiled back at him. My heart was racing a million miles a minute, but I was so sure that this would all be worth it!

&#x200B;

Joel pulled up a dirt road, leading up to a pretty white farmhouse. Long grass swayed lazily in the breeze out front. The driveway was unpaved and rustic. There was a large shed out behind the house. I saw a man coming out as we pulled up to the house. He was tall and bore a strong resemblance to Joel. I recognized him from the wedding. Joel’s older brother, Patrick Anderson. He walked with a tall and confident stride, his cameo jacket flying open in the breeze. He had a neatly trimmed brown beard, short hair and kindly eyes. Beside him, I saw another person standing in the doorway. A skinny, dark haired woman with large eyes like an owl. Briar. Joel and Patrick's sister.

&#x200B;

While Joel parked his truck, Patrick drew nearer to us. His warm, welcoming smile made me feel his embrace before he even reached us. As Joel got out, Patrick pulled him into a big bear hug.

“Long time, no see, city boy!” He said with a grin.

“Good to see you too, man.” Joel replied, before stretching, “Some long miles on the road.”

“I’ll bet. I’ll bet. Come on in. Briar put on some sweet tea. Ma’s up and about too.”

“How’s she holding up?” Joel asked.

&#x200B;

Patrick faked a smile but it didn’t linger for long.

“Same as she ever was.” He finally said, before his attention turned to me.

“Dani, you’re looking good! Damn good! Hope this little bastard hasn’t been giving you too much trouble.”

“Nothing I can’t handle.” I assured him, cracking a sheepish smile.

“Well, if he steps out of line and you’ve gotta give him a whuppin, you won’t get no interference from me.”

“Noted.” I said, as Patrick sheperded us both inside.

“Well, come on in and get some sweet tea. Briar makes it better than anyone else does, I promise you that.”

&#x200B;

Joel’s family’s house was fairly small and tidy. It had something of a cozy, homey feel to it that was nice and inviting. Briar had already disappeared into the kitchen to get us our drinks. Patrick was right, it was better than any other iced tea I’d had before.

“Joel?” I heard a rasping voice call from the other room, “That you, baby?”

&#x200B;

Patrick took off into the next room and Joel followed. I trailed behind him, into the living room where their mother was waiting.

&#x200B;

Shannon Anderson was seated in a massive armchair that seemed to buckle beneath her weight. Her arms were covered in dry, cracked and red skin. Every movement looked like it must have hurt. She had wispy grey hair and a sort of dazed, faraway look in her eyes. She was struggling to stand when I walked in, and Patrick was helping her. She was breathing heavily as she rose to her feet, but the moment she set her eyes on Joal, her entire face seemed to light up.

&#x200B;

“Oh, thank you Lord… Thank you… My, my… You look so good, little Joel!” She cooed as Patrick helped her over to envelop him in a hug.

“It’s good to see you too, Mom.” Joel said warmly.

Shannon's attention turned on me next.

&#x200B;

“Oh, and Danielle! Oh, I’m so happy you’re here too! I’m so, so, so grateful you’ve come to join us!”

“I wouldn’t be anywhere else.” I promised her, as she clasped my hand tightly. She was stronger than she looked.

“I’m glad. It’s so good to have the family all back together again. I prayed, you know. I was down at the church and I told Father Abraham to pray for us all to be together again. God always listens to Father Abraham. He listens closely.”

&#x200B;

Briar appeared in the doorway, watching as Shannon fawned over us before interrupting.

“Supper’s just about ready.” She said, “Just warming everything up. Should be ready to eat in about twenty minutes or so.”

“Thought you were supposed to already have it ready for when Joel arrived?” Patrick asked, looking over at her. Briar just stared right back at him.

“I wanted it to be fresh when he and Dani got here.” She replied, “So we could all eat as a family.”

&#x200B;

Patrick looked as if he wanted to say something else, but Joel cut him off.

“Hey, ten minutes is plenty of time to set the table! Dani, think you can help Briar with that? Pat and I will get our stuff out of the trunk.”

“Yeah, of course.” I said, before letting Briar lead me to the kitchen.

&#x200B;

While she finished cooking, I set the table. I could hear Joel and Patrick coming in and out the door and going up and down the stairs as they brought our stuff in from the car. Since we wouldn’t be needing all of our furniture and whatnot, Joel and I had put a lot that into storage and had traveled fairly light for a cross country move.

&#x200B;

“This must be a big change for you.” I heard Briar say as she stood over the stove, “You’ve never lived in a place like this, have you?”

“I’m afraid not.” I said, “It’s a big change. But, I wanted Joel to be there for Shannon.”

“That’s real sweet of you.” She replied, “I suppose it’ll be nice to have us all back under one roof again. Ma was never all that pleased that Joel left. She always prayed he’d come back at Church. Guess those prayers were answered.”

“I just wish it were under better circumstances,” I said, before glancing at the door and moving closer so I could keep a more hushed tone.

&#x200B;

“How bad is it?”

“The Doctor says that Ma’s only got months left in her. Course, he also said something similar about a year back.” Briar replied, “Ma and Patrick are convinced that Father Abraham’s been healing her. Hard to say for sure… She’s lived longer than she ought to. But she also ain’t getting any better.”

“Well, I suppose I’m just glad that she’s held on as long as she has.” I said. Briar didn’t reply to that.

“Father Abraham, is he the local priest?” I asked, moving to a new subject.

&#x200B;

Briar gave a half nod.

“You’ll probably be meeting him tomorrow. Ma always goes to the Sunday mass. Although he stops in from time to time to check in on her and pray with her.”

“Oh, that’s sweet of him.” I said.

“Yeah. Suppose it is.” She said, before going quiet as Patrick and Joel came downstairs again. Joel went back out to close up the car, but Patrick poked his head into the kitchen.

“How’s supper looking, ladies?”

“Just about done.” Briar said, “You can go and get Ma.”

He huffed before disappearing back into the living room to fetch her.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Shannon was the first one to be seated at the table, while I helped Briar set everything out. We’d barely even put things on the table before Patrick started helping himself.

“Hey, you should get your Mom something first!” I said. Patrick paused. For a moment, I caught a cold glare in his eyes before he started laughing.

&#x200B;

“She’ll get hers.” He said, “Nobody else should be receiving a plate before the man of the house.” I glanced at Briar, who didn’t even meet my gaze. I could hear Joel coming in, and decided I might as well just let the issue go. I got Shannons serving for her.

Once everyone was seated, I watched Shannon suck in a few deep breaths before she spoke.

“Before we start, I’d like to say a short prayer. If you’ll all join hands with me…”

She reached out on either side of her. Patrick took one hand, Briar took the other. They linked hands with Joel and I respectively.

&#x200B;

*“Heavenly Father, I’d like to thank you for the blessings you’ve bestowed upon each of us this day and for bringing my family back together with me. I thank you for bringing us a new member, in Danielle. May her and Joel’s love be everlasting and may you grant us health, prosperity and happiness. Amen.”*

*“Amen.”* Came the reply, and I said it with them.

&#x200B;

“Hey, Pat, after dinner, could you help me set up the old office so Dani and I can work from there?” Joel asked.

“Yeah, sure thing.” Patrick replied between bites, “I’ll get you two set up on the wifi and everything. Should be strong enough for whatever the hell you two do for a living.”

*“Patrick Anderson!”* Shannon snapped, “You do not invoke that word in my house!”

“Sorry, Ma… Heck…” Patrick murmured, before looking at me, “Speaking of which… What exactly is it that you do again, Dani? I don’t recall.”

&#x200B;

“Oh, I do graphic design.” I said, “I do a lot of advertisements and stuff like that. Mostly online banner ads. The stuff you see on Google and Facebook.”

“Really?” He asked, before laughing, “Well shoot, sounds awful complicated.”

“I mean, yes and no. There’s certain ways you can lay out the ads to make them more eye catching, and a lot of companies have certain branding requirements that need to be followed.”

&#x200B;

“So it’s advertising you work in. Media.” Shannon said, “Oh honey, you’re so much better than that! Those companies… There’s a Satanic Influence to them. You see it in their logos. There’s a man on the television who talks about it and the pagan connections in their logos. It’s all there on purpose. It’s an invitation to the highest evils… We should find you a job in the community. I recall… Patrick… Who was looking for a worker?”

“Jeremiah Gunderson had a want ad out.” Patrick said.

&#x200B;

“Gunderson, yes! Gunderson’s a good boy. Oh, you’d love Mr. Gunderson!”

“I appreciate the suggestion.” I said sheepishly, “But I can work remotely. I can assure you, there’s nothing evil about the companies I work with. It’s mostly automotive. Nothing occult with them.”

“Oh, you would be very surprised… They hide it in most everything. It’s a taunt to the righteous. Father Abraham knows it… It’s why he’s given so much to the community. To help us grow independent. We’ll need it someday, you know. When Society is born…”

&#x200B;

“So what’s new in town anyways?” Joel interrupted and I was grateful to him for changing the subject, “What’d I miss?”

“Same old, same old.” Patrick said, “Just missed our last batch of new hires down at Smokey Oak Farm. You would’ve had a blast training these knuckleheads… We’ll probably be looking for new hires again in a few months.”

“Hey, you can count me in.” Joel said, “Good times, man. Good times.”

&#x200B;

They hopped between subjects for the rest of the dinner, keeping Shannon away from the topic of religion and whatever the hell else it was that she’d been going on about, which I was pretty grateful for.

&#x200B;

As night rolled in and Joel set up our office space, I set up our bedroom and unpacked our stuff. I was mostly done when Joel came in to check on me. He wrapped his arms around me and kissed me on the neck.

“Gotcha.” He crooned sweetly.

“You got me.” I replied, before leaning into him.

“Settling in okay?” He asked.

“Yeah… Although I thought Patrick and Briar weren’t living here anymore?”

&#x200B;

Joel paused for a moment.

“They’ve both got work.” He said, “You heard Patrick, he’s busy running Smokey Oak and Briar’s been running their storefront ever since the owners daughter passed. You’ve seen how bad Ma is…”

“I’ve never heard you call her Ma before.” I joked, turning to look at him.

“Sorry… Slipping into old habits. But you get my point, right? She doesn’t have a lot of time left and her mind… Well. It’s going.”

“Yeah… I can tell…” I murmured.

&#x200B;

Joel kissed me on the forehead.

“I wanna be by her side when she goes.” He said, “She was right there to raise the three of us after Dad died. We owe her that.”

“Yeah… You do.” I agreed, before returning his kiss.

&#x200B;

We spent the next hour setting up the room together before we got too tired to continue. The rest could wait until the next day. We called it a night at sometime around ten, and within the next half hour Joel was fast asleep in the bed beside me, conked out just as soundly as if he were in his own bed.

&#x200B;

Sleep didn’t come quite as easily for me though. Maybe it was the bed, maybe it was the strange new room. Hard to say. The bed was a little hard for my tastes, but I’ve also never been able to sleep that well in strange places. Even if this was our home now, it was still new to me. After tossing and turning for the better part of an hour, I finally decided that if I wasn’t going to sleep just yet, I might as well get up and try to be productive.

&#x200B;

So that’s exactly what I did.

&#x200B;

I quietly left the bedroom behind and made my way into our new office. Joel had finished most of the setup, there wasn’t much left to do to finish it. After about ten minutes, my monitors and work laptop were up and running. I connected to the wifi and checked my emails, before bringing up one of my projects to plug away at it.

&#x200B;

It helped keep my mind off of everything. The stress of a sudden change and the smothering silence that filled the house. I was used to at least some city noises outside my window. But out there at Shannon’s place there was nothing save for the distant drone of the crickets. I didn’t hate it but… Well… It wasn’t home…

&#x200B;

I suppose the ennui that gnawed at me was probably normal given my situation. Without something to ground you, I imagine it’s easy to feel so restless.

&#x200B;

‘*You just need to get used to it*.’ I told myself. *‘Give it a few weeks and soon, it’ll all be okay. You won’t feel so out of place. This place won’t feel so strange. It’ll all be okay…’*

&#x200B;

I wanted to believe it too.

&#x200B;

As I worked, my mind drifted away from the stress of the move and into more familiar territory. I could make more sense of work than I could of all of this and in a weird way I think it did sort of set my mind at ease. The hours on the clock drifted by and I started feeling my eyes grow heavy. My work started to become a little sloppier as I realized that it was probably time to call it a night. I just needed to finish one thing and then I could…

&#x200B;

That was when I heard it. Faint at first. The sound must’ve been there for a while before I noticed it. It was only as I was finishing up that it actually got my attention. I paused, looking up and listening for a moment.

&#x200B;

I could’ve sworn I heard somebody singing.

&#x200B;

I glanced at the clock on my laptop. It was 3 in the morning, who the hell was singing? The voice sounded female but didn’t sound like anyone I recognized… And I was pretty sure that it was coming from outside the window…

&#x200B;

I stood up and stepped away from the desk, before opening the window to look out. I could hear the voice even clearer now. It was absolutely coming from outside, and I could even make out the lyrics of the song.

&#x200B;

*“When we've been here ten thousand years*

*Bright, shining as the sun*

*We've no less days to sing God's praise*

*Than when we first begun.”*

&#x200B;

I looked around for the source and it didn’t take me long to see it. There was a woman skirting the trees just outside my window, wandering almost aimlessly as she sang, staring at nothing in particular. The way she seemed to move made me wonder if maybe she was drunk, but she wasn’t dressed like a barfly. It was hard to see her clearly in the dark, but from what I could make out, she was wearing a dirty, white set of what looked like scrubs with matching plain sneakers. Her hair looked discheveled and messy. She didn’t seem to notice me staring out the window at her. Even when I called out to her, she barely even seemed to react. She just kept singing.

&#x200B;

*“Amazing grace how sweet the sound*

*That saved a wretch like me.*

*I once was lost, but now I'm found.*

*Was blind but now I see.”*

&#x200B;

She just kept wandering, staring vacantly ahead as she began the song all over again.

&#x200B;

*“Amazing grace how sweet the sound*

*That saved a wretch like me.*

*I once was lost, but now I'm found.*

*Was blind but now I see.”*

&#x200B;

I left the window and headed downstairs, slipping on my shoes as I went out the back door and into the yard. I could still hear her singing as I approached her. Her back was to me as she walked, and her head lolled mindlessly to the side as she started another verse.

&#x200B;

*“'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear*

*And grace my fears relieved.*

*How precious did that grace appear*

*The hour I first believed.”*

&#x200B;

“Hello?” I called again as I approached her, “Ma’am?”

She still didn’t acknowledge me. She just kept walking, almost mindlessly ahead, and I followed her. Slowly I reached a hand out to put it on her shoulder and only then did she pause. The singing stopped as her body seemed to tense up. She finally looked back at me, a hazy, faraway look in her eye.

“Hey, are you okay?” I asked.

She just smiled emptily at me, before she started to sing again.

&#x200B;

*“Through many dangers, toils, and snares*

*I have already come*

*This grace that brought me safe thus far*

*And grace will lead me home.”*

&#x200B;

As she sang, I just stared at her, unsure what to say or think. Clearly, something was wrong here! I mean, maybe this woman was sick, or drunk or something! Whatever it was, she probably needed help, right? I couldn’t just leave her out there!

&#x200B;

“Hey, do you want to come with me?” I asked, although she just kept singing, oblivious to every word I said. I reached out to try and guide her towards the house and she didn’t put up any fight. She let me lead her towards the back door, singing all the while as I did.

&#x200B;

*“When we've been here ten thousand years*

*Bright, shining as the sun*

*We've no less days to sing God's praise*

*Than when we first begun.”*

&#x200B;

I escorted her gently into the house, taking care to close the door behind her. I was aware that her singing was probably going to wake up half the household, if it hadn’t already. But we needed to call someone!

“Just sit here, alright?” I said softly as I eased her into a seat at the kitchen table, “I’m going to call someone, okay? Do you have someone I can call? A member of your family, maybe?”

Still no answer. Just another verse.

&#x200B;

*“Amazing grace how sweet the sound*

*That saved a wretch like me.*

*I once was lost, but now I'm found.*

*Was blind but now I see.”*

&#x200B;

“You trying to wake up the whole goddamn house?” I heard a voice ask. There were footsteps on the stairs as someone came down, and in the darkness, it took me a moment to realize that it was Patrick.

“I’m sorry!” I said, “I just… I found her wandering around outside. She just keeps singing. I was worried, I thought that maybe we should call someone. I don’t think she’s okay!”

&#x200B;

Patrick turned on the kitchen light and stared at the woman I’d brought in. She stared back at him and as she did, her voice suddenly died in her throat. She looked at him with eyes that slowly grew wider and wider with an expression I can only describe as true terror… And Patrick just stared right back at her with an intense, stony look that was hard to read. I watched them both for a moment and was about to ask why the hell she was staring at him like that when he spoke again.

&#x200B;

“Minnie. Were you on one of your late night walks again?”

She seemed like she was trying to speak, but the words didn’t come out. The only sound she made was a weak rasping noise. Patrick glanced at me, before he spoke again.

“Does Bill know you’re out on another little walk?”

Still no answer from ‘Minnie’.

&#x200B;

“You know her?” I asked.

“Yeah I do, this is Bill Pickmans wife. Minnie. She’s… Sick… Looks to me like she’s having one of her episodes.”

“Well, should we call someone?” I asked, “Is there a hospital, or maybe the police?”

“Don’t waste their time on her. All they’re gonna do is drive her back home. I can save ‘em the trouble.” Patrick said.

&#x200B;

“Well, what about Bill? Should we call him?”

“Bill doesn’t own a phone. Don’t worry about it, Dani. I’ll take it from here.”

Patrick flashed me a smile that seemed… Wrong. It was hard to describe it, but there was just something off about it.

&#x200B;

“Come on Minnie… I’m taking you back home…” Patrick approached her, and I saw her shrink away from him. She shook her head violently but didn’t speak. It didn’t stop Patrick from grabbing her by the arm. He put one hand on her shoulder and pulled her to her feet, earring a terrified whimper from her.

“You’re scaring her!” I said.

“Yeah, she spooks easy when she’s like this.” Patrick said, “She’s fine.”

&#x200B;

His grip on her arm was tight enough that I half expected it to leave a bruise. I could see Minnie shaking! Why the hell was she so afraid of Patrick?

“Let’s just call the police and let them take her.” I offered, “You really don’t need to-”

*“I got it.”* Patrick snapped, “Trust me. I’ve dealt with this before. Just leave it with me.”

&#x200B;

Minnie was staring at me with big, wide eyes that looked to be on the verge of tears. I wanted to say more. I should have said more but now my voice was catching in my throat. That intense stare Patrick was giving me made it harder to speak. He suddenly seemed to loom over both of us, a great bear of a man daring me to say another word.

&#x200B;

“You should go back to bed.” He said, “We got Sunday Service tomorrow. Doesn’t do to be late to that… Get some rest.”

&#x200B;

He gave Minnie a tug on the arm to lead her away, into the living room. I stood silent in the kitchen, listening as he snatched his keys off the hook near the front door and took Minnie away. I finally followed him when I heard him step outside, and watched as he nudged her into his truck, then got in beside her. A moment later, the engine roared to life and the truck was disappearing into the night.

&#x200B;

When it was finally gone, I realized that my heart was racing in my chest still. The way Patrick had looked at me before he’d left… I’d genuinely been afraid of him in that moment. Just like Minnie had been.

&#x200B;

I know I didn’t have any real reason to fear for her safety or to think that Patrick would lie to me… But that look… I couldn’t get it out of my head.

&#x200B;

As I went back inside, my hands were still shaking a little from the whole encounter. I spied the phone in the kitchen and went to pick it up. I figured, maybe if I called the local police, they might be able to confirm that everything was alright… Looking back at it now, I realize that I wasn’t exactly thinking straight. I was really just looking for reassurance. I was expecting some country dispatch officer to tell me that they didn’t need to get involved.

&#x200B;

I dialed 911 and listened to the phone ring. It rang, and rang, and rang… Then sometime after the fifth or sixth ring, somebody finally picked up.

*“I told you I’ve got this, Dani.”* The voice on the other end of the line said.

&#x200B;

Patrick.

&#x200B;

I felt a chill run through me as I once again found myself at a loss for words.

“H-how did you…”

*“Just go to sleep already. We got an early morning, tomorrow. Minnie will be fine. Billy’ll take good care of her up at his place, alright?”*

“A-alright…” I stammered before Patrick hung up on me.

&#x200B;

The kitchen felt quieter than before as that heavy silence settled in again, and I swear I could hear my own heart pounding in my ears. As I stood there, an uneasy question lingered in my mind.

&#x200B;

What the hell kind of town had I just moved [to?](https://www.reddit.com/r/HeadOfSpectre/)
