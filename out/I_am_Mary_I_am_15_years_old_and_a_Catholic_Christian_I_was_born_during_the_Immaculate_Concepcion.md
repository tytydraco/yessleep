When I was a child, my grandmother would tell me stories of the Nativity of Christ. That a star so bright and big lit up the sky to take the pregnant Virgin Mary to Bethlehem.  
  
The Virgin Mary and her husband Joseph lived in Nazareth. An Angel told Mary that she will conceive the Son of God. But something bad happened and Joseph and Mary had to flee. They ended up in Bethlehem when Mary was about to give birth. No one would open their doors to them for shelter because they were strangers. There was but one, who offered the shed where their animals and livestock lay. And at that very place, the Virgin Mary gave birth to our Lord, Jesus Christ.  
  
I remember looking forward to the night sky, when it’s finally November. Trying to find the brightest star, I think to myself that it must be the first star Jesus has seen. But tonight, I looked up at the night sky and I could not find the brightest star. I could not even find one star alight. The sky is filled with thick glowing clouds of smoke and all I could see are wraith-like flames. There is not one house from kilometers apart with light. But then every minute, the clouds are exploding and raining down fire.  
  
As soon as the ringing in my ears stop, I could start to hear cries. The cries are everywhere, sounding like the wails of hundreds to thousands of mothers and children. When I don’t smell the putrid smoke, I could smell the burning flesh of my playmates. Some of them were still alive and screaming. But now, it has been quiet. I found a crying puppy on the street and even he had been quiet. I can understand him. Like me, his siblings were also buried in the rubble. So I tell him it’s okay, because he is not alone.  
  
The men in uniforms said, they were the chosen people of God. They said God has promised them our land as it says in the Bible. But when I told them we believe in the same God, they told me I should be slaughtered for worshipping idols. I don’t know why they would tell me that, but I know they are wrong. When I was a child, my grandmother told me that Jesus spoke the truth. And for that, He was accused of blasphemy and was tortured and nailed on the cross. The people condemned Him to death and said it was the lawful thing to do. They were hateful indeed, but Jesus forgave them anyway.  
  
I too, forgive them. I forgive them for taking the lives of my family. They first claimed my grandmother. Then they claimed my father and my big brothers in one day. I lost my mother and my little sister for a week now. All of my cousins. All of my neighbors. All of my friends. They are all gone to heaven today.   
  
When I was a child, my grandmother told me I would have grown up to be a great author if only I had not been born in the wrong side of the iron wall. She had known this war was never about our faith. They came here 50 years ago and just decided that our lives mattered less. I may still be a child without the knowledge of the world. But it is on them that this is what I will forever be. I forgive them, but I pray that you never forget for me.  
  
The sky is starting to rain fire once again. As I lay in the ashes of my city, I clutched the little puppy in my arms. He may be an animal, but he has more humanity in him than they ever have. I will tell him the truth of Jesus Christ, so we will be welcomed to join our families together in the kingdom of heaven.   
  
When Jesus was about to be born, the false king Herod ordered the slaughter of all the infant boys in Bethlehem. He knew that the Son of God will be born.  
  
Now that false kings and hateful people have turned to call for our slaughter.. I do not fear. I just know that my Lord, Your coming is near.
