When I was a kid, I had an imaginary friend named Mr. Smiley.

Only… he wasn’t really imaginary—and he definitely wasn’t my friend.

I thought he was long gone. But last night, my daughter said he missed me.

The house felt wrong—like something had made room for itself.

“Hi!” A small voice cut through the silence.

I jerked forward, snapping my head left to meet the sound.

“Are you okay, Daddy?” Elizabeth asked, standing barefoot in the hallway.

“Jesus, Lizzy,” I said, taking a deep breath. “You scared me half to death.”

She blinked up at me, wide-eyed. “I’m sorry, Daddy.”

“It’s almost three in the morning,” I said. “What’re you doing up?”

“Me and Mr. Smiley were wonderin’ what you’re up to.”

The name caught on something deep inside me. “Who?”

“Mr. Smiley,” she said. “He’s worried about you.”

“Worried about me?” I wiped the gooseflesh from my arm, stomach sinking.

“He says he was your friend when you were a boy,” she added, smiling. “He wanted me to ask if you’d like to come play again.”

Mr. Smiley.

My heart began pounding.

She held something out. Something familiar.

“Here,” she said. “It’s for you. From Mr. Smiley.”

The paper was smeared in crayon, yellowed with age.

I stared at it.

*scout, I’ve missed you.*

Scout. No one had called me that since...

“Did you write this?” I asked.

“No, Daddy. Mr. Smiley did.”

Static fizzed at my fingertips. My breath came faster, shallow, like the panting of wounded prey.

Before I could process it, Elizabeth walked away, closing her bedroom door behind her.

I leaned against the sink, legs like lead. I flipped the paper over.

Crude, childish drawings filled the page—stick figures in distress. And there I was, front and center. My eyes were jagged bottomless pits.

Above me, a red figure with outstretched arms and an impossibly wide grin loomed. In the corner, a priest with a cross.

Below that, broken letters:

*she’s almost ready. just like you were.*

The paper fell from my hand.

I entered Elizabeth’s room without knocking.

“Lizzy, where did you get this?”

A giggle answered.

She lay in bed, covers pulled over her face.

I stepped closer, peeling the blanket back.

She covered her mouth with both hands, giggling.

“Elizabeth. Where did you get this paper? Seriously. Come on.”

Her face was beet-red with laughter.

“Elizabeth…”

I gently pulled her hands down.

Her cheeks were round—but her smile—Jesus Christ—her smile.

It was cleaved into her face. Held together with tension and malice. Her lips curled past what should’ve been possible, revealing jagged fangs.

Her gaze was gone. Replaced with depopulated planets.

I stumbled back.

“Ah! What the hell?!”

“It’s been a long time.” Her voice was wet, parasitic. Her mouth—Jesus Christ, her mouth—

“I’ve missed you.”

The radio alarm clock blared beside her bed, loud and distorted.

*You are my sunshine, my only sunshine…*

I gasped, springing upright in bed, drenched in sweat.

My cheeks were stiff from dried tears; remnants of a storm that had passed. The morning light bled through the curtains, casting messy, uneven patches on the drywall.

My heart thundered as I swung my legs over the side of the bed, peeling my skin from the covers.

Just a dream.

But it felt so real.

I stood. The hardwood was cool against my soles as I shuffled into the hallway, arriving at Elizabeth’s door.

I pressed my ear to the grainy wood. Only silence answered.

I held my breath, my hand on the doorknob.

That smile… What if she has it again?

It’s just a dream. I hoped. Something felt off.

I turned the knob, wincing as the door creaked open.

Elizabeth lay under the covers, just like in the nightmare.

Shit.

At any moment, she’ll spring up with that smile.

I crept closer, hand on her shoulder.

“Lizzy,” I whispered.

“Elizabeth,” I said again, praying she wouldn’t hear me.

“Elizabeth—”

Ahh! She shot up, screaming.

I stumbled back, crashing into the wall.

Her face—it was... normal.

“Are you okay, Daddy?” she asked, her voice sweet and innocent. “You scared me.”

“Yes, I’m sorry, Sweetheart. I-I…” I stammered.

“It’s okay,” she said, smiling.

I picked up the cross that had landed upside down and placed it back on the wall. “I’ll see you downstairs in a bit,” I mumbled, unsure what to say.

I staggered to the bathroom, my head pounding. I grabbed the aspirin bottle, popped two pills. They scraped down my throat.

I turned on the faucet, smeared toothpaste onto my brush, and scrubbed my teeth in slow, mechanical strokes.

I caught my reflection in the mirror.

My mouth stretched wide.

And a giggle escaped my lips, but it didn’t feel like mine.  
  
What the hell is happening to me?
