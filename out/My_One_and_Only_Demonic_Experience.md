Although I can’t remember the exact year, I was most likely 16 years old. I‘d been living in Ireland for just under three years, having moved from England. My family and I lived in the midlands in a very small town. During my teenage years, because of how depressing my life was, mostly due to hating school, I regularly began believing and praying to God – naively thinking if I did, he would magically make my life better. 

Well, it was during this “spiritual faze” that I came upon a certain online video. The video was about a man who had apparently been brought by Jesus to hell, and while he was there, Jesus showed him all kinds of eternal horrors. From what I can remember, the man saw the souls of people being tortured and burned alive by demons or something. Well, after experiencing this, the man then wakes up in his bed, as though from a dream – however, the man claimed what he experienced wasn’t a dream at all, but a real experience of what happens to sinners in hell. 

Although I didn’t know if what this man experienced was real or not, it definitely made me terrified of ever spending eternity in the fiery depths of hell. However, not long after watching this video, I suddenly felt very unsettled. Not because of the video I just watched, but to my memory, I almost felt as though I was now being watched while supposedly alone in my bedroom. But not only did I feel like I was being watched, I also felt like I was somehow in danger – so much so that I leave my room to go downstairs, as that’s where my parents and sister were. 

Now, what comes next is the real scary part of this experience – because as soon as I reach down the stairs, before I could enter any room, I feel a hard physical tap on the back of my shoulder, where I then literally turn around and scream. No word of a lie, I screamed. But when I turn around, there isn’t anyone or anything there, as though a ghost had tapped me on the back. Also worth mentioning, is that I had screamed so loud that my mum was now shouting me from the living room, asking what was wrong. 

For the rest of that evening, I remember being very afraid and skittish, that every noise or movement I heard had me incredibly paranoid. In fact, I was so skittish, that whenever my dog, who was still just a small puppy at the time, came up to me, I was afraid of her touching me.  

Living in this house for only a few more months before moving, I never had another experience like this one - nor have I since. Although I’ve always been a fan of horror, I basically know little to nothing about demons or ghosts – as I find Aliens and cryptids a lot more interesting. If there’s anyone reading this who knows anything about demonic experiences or similar experiences of the supernatural, I would really like to hear your thoughts.
