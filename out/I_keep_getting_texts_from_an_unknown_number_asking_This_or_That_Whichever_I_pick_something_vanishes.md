*Ding!*



My phone startled me out of my half-asleep-half-awake state as I lay on the couch with the TV droning on in the background. I read the text from an unknown number through blurry, weary eyes. 



"*This or That? Tea or Coffee?*". 



The look of confusion I shot my phone for a split second before I put it down to some form of spam must have been hilarious. I flicked the ringer off and nodded back off only to be awoken a second time with that god-awful sound. Again, it was from the unknown number and again it was that same question. 



This was getting, well, *odd*. 



I, annoyed and increasingly tired, turned my phone off entirely but before I could even close my eyes again the ping! rang through the speakers and inexplicably those same words lit up the otherwise dark screen. 



How the *fuck* was I getting a text when my phone was off?



I had enough. With my phone now switched back on and my mind swirling I typed out a paragraph of expletives before the urge to do something else took over. I decided to humour whoever this was. You want me to choose? Well, damnit, I'll choose, I mumbled to myself. 



I chose "coffee" and promptly fell asleep without a care as to whether my phone remained on or not. I struggle to put this any other way than bluntly, but the next morning coffee no longer seemed to exist. I rolled out of bed and stumbled into the kitchen to start brewing so it could finish up whilst I brushed my teeth and showered - like I've done every morning for some time - and couldn't seem to find my treasured bag of grounds no matter where I looked. I get cranky when I'm without coffee, so I put it down to misplacing it and my still-tired brain struggling to remember where, so decided to swing by my favourite coffee shop Lucci's on the way to work. I had the usual small talk with the server who knew my order by heart at this point and proceeded to make the same old joke. 



"*The usual please.*" 



He looked at me like I had two heads. 



I went to fill the awkward silence that followed when another text came through. Part of me knew what it would be before I even looked, but I hadn't yet put the pieces together. Not until the stakes were raised. 



"*This or That? Luna or Sol?*" 



Knowing it was somehow able to keep pestering me regardless of my non-responses, I chose "This". I got home that day to find my puppy Luna had disappeared. There was no way out. No window to jump out of, no attic to hide in. Nothing. Her brother Sol moped all evening. 



I never found her. 



By the time the next text came through as I was ruffling through cardboard boxes and head-height cabinets in my desperately futile attempts to find my dear baby, I refused to play along. I couldn't possibly convince anybody else, but those texts were emitting something badly wrong into the world. Into my life. 



And as if in tune with my deepest thoughts, it knew I wouldn't play. Because this text came with a warning. 



"*Mom or Dad?*" 



"*Failure to choose immediately will result in a choice being made for you.*" 



I rationalised it. Told myself I'd rather have a bad thing happen without my direct influence. Even if said bad thing was something that made me stomach churn. 



So I never chose. 



Knowing what was coming, I called both of my parents minutes later in cold sweat brought on by fear and panic.



The search party for Mom began a few days after she vanished. We never found her either. 



As I lay depressed, horrified and halfway through a bottle of whiskey on the same old couch earlier tonight, that familiar ping! came through once again.  



"*This or That? Spine or Skull?*" 



Something has been whispering through the underside of my bedroom door ever since. 



I never chose.
