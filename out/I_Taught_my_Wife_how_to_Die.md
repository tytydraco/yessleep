By the time I got done writing that night, I was too tired to care that my wife, Symone, wasn’t home. I figured she’d gone for a walk or something.

When I woke up in the morning and saw that she wasn’t in bed, my first thought was that she’d gotten up before me and went to the store. It wasn’t until the evening that I realized she’d left me a voicemail in the middle of the night.

It was a short message, less than ten seconds. But when I think about it now I think that most of the worst things that ever happen to you happen in ten seconds or less. Probably most of the good things too. Ten seconds is enough time for a lot to happen.

I know it took me less than ten seconds to fall in love when I saw Symone for the first time. Sitting by herself in the corner of the coffee shop I worked at, reading of all things. Beautiful jet black hair, a soft face, and round glasses.

Like any straight college aged guy, it was normal for me to give some glances to pretty girls that walked in while I was working. But normally that’s all it was, a quick glance then back to work. I never thought that I would be so unprofessional as to flirt with a customer, but for the first and only time in my three years working at the coffee shop, I walked over to this beautiful girl and introduced myself.

We hit it off immediately. We talked about books, our hatred for annoying old people (we both worked in customer service), and found out that we were going to the same college, were both English majors, and we even had some of the same professors.

Months later, she told me that the moment she realized she was going to give me “at least one date” was when I told her how lucky I felt to have a professor as knowledgeable and passionate as Dr. Ridge.

You see, Dr. Ridge was perhaps the most made-fun-of professor in the history of education. During the first day in every one of her classes, Dr. Ridge would show a short PowerPoint presentation over her 17 bunnies, each with names like Dante, Raven, and Beowulf. That wasn’t the embarrassing part—the embarrassing part was that she had a FaceBook made for each one of her bunnies, and they all interacted with each other. Some of them were married and would post about their relationship struggles, only to argue online; some of them were dealing with injuries or illnesses and posted poems about their pain.

As you can guess, this did not go over well in freshman level classes. However, to hear Symone tell it, the fact that I looked past Dr. Ridge’s quirks to see how intelligent and kind she was, proved that I was worth a shot.

Fast forward to the day of our two year anniversary. I’m starting my last semester of college and Symone is only a few months behind me. We were at the nicest restaurant I could afford, talking about our future together for the thousandth time: we planned to get married shortly after she graduated and then move somewhere far away from either of our families. I was going to teach high school English while working on my novels, and she was going to pursue her PhD and eventually become a literature professor.

We finished dinner in high spirits and decided to go for a walk around the city. The ground was covered in snow and ice and the street lights reflected off the ground; the way that Symone lit up made her look like an angel. She was the center of the world.

We went through a local bookstore. My best friend Tommy was the clerk and gave me an employee discount on the book of Robert Frost poems I bought for Symone. When we were checking out, an old woman in line told us that we were about the cutest couple she’d ever seen.

“You look just like my husband and I did,” she said, then looked at me directly. “Don’t ever let her go.”

“I won’t,” I promised.

Drunk in love, we meandered through the city until we wound up at the underground subway station. In twenty minutes there was a train going to a place in the city we’d never been through before, so we decided, screw it. We’d go check it out for no other reason other than to say that we’d experienced all the city had to offer.

We spent our downtime sitting on a bench and playing sticks with our fingers (if you don’t know how to play, Google it). Symone was always a much quicker thinker than me. She was better at chess, Sudoku, crossword puzzles, anything that took brain power. She had just beaten me for the fifth game in a row when I noticed the group of guys on the other side of the tracks.

They were huddled together, but when I looked up they all had their heads turned, staring directly at us. They noticed me and turned back to each other. I figured they were just some funny guys making jokes about us sitting all lovey dovey on the bench. Maybe they were checking Symone out.

Either way, they were on the other side of the tracks. They were the furthest thing from a threat at the time. That’s why I felt fine excusing myself to the bathroom a few minutes later.

As I was washing my hands, I heard a scream and instantly recognized it as Symone’s voice. I sprinted out and found her circled by all three men. The tallest one held Symone in a headlock so tight that he was lifting her off the ground. The other two were looking around for witnesses.

When they saw me they barreled toward me. Symone let out a muffled cry.

For a second time slowed. I remember thinking to myself how incredible of a situation this was. Surely this would all just stop somehow, right? This type of thing didn’t just happen.

But it was happening, and the two men were only a few feet away from me. I had no chance in a fight. Even if it was just one of them, they were nearly twice my size. The one thing that I thought I might have over them, was speed.

Like a wide receiver juking a defender, I feigned as if I was going to run away. Instead, I cut back and ran towards the gap between the leftmost man and the tracks, narrowly escaping a five-foot fall to the bottom. He reached for me, but I lowered my shoulder and barreled through his outstretched arm. I cut to the right and slammed into Symone and her assailant at full speed, bringing all three of us crashing to the ground.

I ended up on top of the tall man and elbowed him in the ribs. As I rolled away, I heard a loud thud and a shriek. One of the other men had tried to grab Symone, but had instead pushed her into the tracks about six feet below us.

I tried to stand, but then the man grabbed me by the ankle and pulled me so that I fell on my stomach and cracked my jaw so hard that I saw stars.

I kicked my feet blindly and connected with his stomach. I got free and halfway to my feet before I was grabbed and put into a headlock.

The grip was so tight I was scared my throat was going to collapse. I flailed about and clawed at hands I couldn’t see, but as deep as my nails went, the grip never loosened—until we heard the horn.

The train was coming.

Symone’s on the tracks.

I was thrown to the ground and a heavy boot stomped on my back and knocked the wind out of me. “Let’s get the fuck out of here,” one of them yelled. By the time I could stand they were running away.

Symone frantically clawed at the wall, trying to get up out of the trench, but she was a short girl, barely five feet tall. Although she could reach up to the platform above her, the edge was curved, making it too difficult for her to get a firm hold.

I reached my arms down and tried to pull her up myself, but I just didn’t have the strength. Maybe if we had a little more time we could have worked together, but the train sounded so close. It was going to burst through the tunnel any second.

Once we saw the train, there wouldn’t be enough time to react. There wasn’t enough room down there for her to escape its girth.

I allowed myself half a second to close my eyes and think and think and think. I pictured the train bursting through the tunnel and Symone screaming my name, standing against the edge of the tracks as it ran into and through her. I thought about the sound of her bones being crushed, about never seeing her again, about spending the rest of my life without her.

I could try again to grab her, but the result would simply be the same: her getting crushed while we held hands.

There was no getting her up in time. There was only one scenario where I saw her surviving:

“Go to the middle of the tracks and lay down,” I said.

Without hesitation, she let go of my hands, ran to the tracks, and laid down flat on her stomach with her arms firm against her sides.

Just then, the train emerged from the tunnel. Her right arm was resting exactly where the wheels of the train would run.

“A little left!” I screamed.

She squirmed a half inch to the left just as she disappeared underneath the train.

She screamed so loudly that I could hear her over the rumbling. She screamed and screamed until the train came to a complete stop. For a long second I heard nothing except for the train doors opening and passengers holding their conversations that strung together like a bad choir.

“Symone!” I screamed

I flagged down the operator, and he kept the train stationary until Symone was able to squeeze out. Together, we lifted her up to safety.

I called the police and told them what happened, but none of the men were ever caught. I found that to be irrelevant. Symone was safe.

For the next week, she stayed with me at my apartment. She cried in her sleep almost every night, but eventually she felt close to normal—only, much less likely to take a late night subway train.

A couple weeks later, we were lying in bed and I was the one crying.

“I was so scared you were going to die,” I said. “I couldn’t stand to live without you, and I know that it was my fault. I should never have left you alone.”

She kissed a tear running down my cheek and hugged me close. “But you knew just what to do. You saved me.”

“I didn’t know what to do. I just said the first thing I thought of. I had no idea if the train was going to crush you or not, I just knew I couldn’t get you out in time. I had to try something.”

“Well, it worked.”

“Why were you so confident in me?” I asked. “How come when I told you to lay down, you just did it?”

“You’re my boyfriend,” she said. “You’re always there when I need you; you always do the right thing. I knew you wouldn’t let anything happen to me.”

Years later, we had a beautiful wedding at the very same church Symone was baptized in as a baby. I sobbed as she walked down the aisle; we both sobbed as we said our vows; by the time we kissed, our faces were so wet that they slid against each other like two blubbery fish.

We honeymooned in Greece where we climbed the Acropolis. We held hands as we watched the sunset. I promised  myself that, no matter what, Symone would be the important thing in my life. We were both on the precipice, about to free fall into the things we’d been dreaming about since we were young, and yet, I knew that whether I sold a million books or zero, I was going to love Symone more than anything. She would always be my priority.

Symone got accepted into one of the top English Literature PhD programs in the country, so we ended up moving to an even bigger city. She focused on her classes and worked as a waitress on the weekends. I found a teaching job at a local high school and spent my evenings working on my novels.

It was about a year into this new life when I began to find success. It started small. A publisher picked up my first book, a horror novel, and we were able to get it published in a short time with minimal edits.

A couple dozen people picked up the book, and I got some solid reviews. Every week a few more sales would roll in, and after some months it looked like I might even break even. Then some girl on TikTok made a video with a title like, “The most disturbing book of 2025.” She gave a quick, spoiler free summary of my book with lots of gasps and comments like “you won’t believe what happens next.” At the end she said that she didn’t sleep with the lights off for a week after finishing the story.

The video ended up going viral. Tens of millions of views and over a million likes. Other book content creators started making summaries and reviews, some people even posted live reactions of them reading the ending. People were speculating on whether or not the killer was actually dead. Would there be a sequel?

Suddenly the book was selling so fast that the small book printer my publishers outsourced to couldn’t keep up. They had to hire a secondary team, and then a third, all just to print more and more copies.

Edgy teenagers weren’t exactly my target audience, but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t in absolute bliss. I went to bookstores and saw entire displays with copies of my book. I started doing book signings and talks. I spoke on a panel with an author who’s a household name.

Even when the publicity started to die down, the book was selling at a steady rate. That’s when my publisher gave me a deadline: 45 days to finish the sequel that I hadn’t even planned on writing.

My school understood when I quit with only a week's notice. This was a once in a lifetime opportunity, and I had to strike while the iron was hot. Over the next month and a half I did nothing except work on my book.

I’d be lying if I said I didn’t notice Symone feeling down around this time. We barely talked anymore, sex was nonexistent. She tried to get me out of my office for a date at least once a week, but I was always just so busy. I kept telling her that as soon as I finished the book I’d spend all the time in the world with her. I remember being so frustrated that she just didn’t get it.

She got even more upset when I started drinking at night. Not a lot, but when you write and think for 12 hours straight every single day, sometimes you just need something to help you relax. I yelled at her more than once during this time.

I kept telling myself that I would start treating her better soon. But then a sequel turned into a threequel, and then I started a new series. There really never was a good chance for a break. I had this momentum you see, and readers are fickle. There was always the chance that as soon as I took a breather they were going to move on to something else.

Symone started struggling to keep up with her coursework, and every time she tried to vent to me about it I told her that if it was too much for her she should just quit.

I’m not quite sure when she did drop out, but it’s safe to say I didn’t notice for a few weeks. She just laid in bed and wouldn’t even try to talk to me anymore.

One night I forced myself to stop writing a little early. I really did feel bad for her. I knew I was being neglectful. It just seemed that there was always something more urgent. And I knew she’d always be around once it wrapped up.

That night I booked a vacation scheduled for the next month—our anniversary. We’d go to Hawaii and stay in a nice resort. “I won’t do any writing for a whole week,” I promised. “It’ll be just the two of us.”

When I told her she just nodded, and I could tell she didn’t believe me. But I meant it, I really did. It’s just that, as we got closer to the vacation, I realized I was behind on my next book. We’d have more time if we could just postpone it by a couple of weeks.

That would have worked just fine. Except for the fact that, the very day of our anniversary, she got run over by a subway train.

I didn’t listen to the voicemail until after the police called me to tell me she was dead. I was writing when they called.

They said that she had laid down on the subway tracks. Flat on her back, with her arms flat against her side. Witnesses said that it was almost like she was trying to hide under the train—to avoid being run over.

She almost did, too. If she was just one more inch to the left, she would have been fine.

The first thing I did when I got off the phone was listen to her voicemail.

“I’m going to the subway station. The one closest to our house. I hope you’ll meet me there. Somehow, despite everything, I know you will. I love you.”

All I can think about now is her lying there, confident that I was going to do something to save her. Did she believe that I was going to make it just in time?

Did she die believing, like she did when we were young, [that I would never let anything happen to her?](http://connorisaacwriting.com)
