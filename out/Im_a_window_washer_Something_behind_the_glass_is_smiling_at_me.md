I started the day, same as usual. The new contract had just come through Friday- window cleanings for the new office high-rise downtown, once a month, for four months. The suckers were paying twice my usual rate, but hey, I couldn’t complain.

We descended from the roof early in the morning and began to make our way down. This job would be easy- today we’d be doing floors 33 through 30, starting at the very top. 

It was about 3:30 when the bosun’s chair reached the 30th floor. A dust storm had hit our city a couple weeks back so it was taking longer than usual to get each floor done. I turned to my partner, Reggie, and asked if he knew which floors we were supposed to cover next month. He leaned back against the rail, and dug a weathered print of the job out of his pocket.

“Let’s see… today’s the 12th, right? Today’s floors are 33 through 30. Next month….”

He squinted, scanning for the details.

“Huh. Same deal next month too, just 33 through 30. Maybe these big pharma assholes keep all their important people up top, don’t care if the lower windows stay dusty.” He chuckled, folding the paper up and replacing it in his overalls.

“Maybe. Don’t look too fancy in there though.”

I picked up the squeegee and moved over to the next window. As I wet it down and cleared the dust off, I did something we’re typically advised against, and I squinted to look inside.

The room behind the glass was completely dark. Even against the afternoon sun, typically we’d be able to see some semblance of light or activity inside, but I must have just been looking into an inactive floor. I had almost turned to look away, but then I saw him.

Faintly, barely discernible in the dark hall, a figure sat in a chair, facing the window. He sat in complete darkness, his figure shrouded and his features hidden. 

“Hey Reg, you see that?”

Reggie rolled his eyes. “See what? We’re not supposed to look in, Paulie.”

“Yeah, yeah, but like… the guy’s just, I don’t know, looking at us? Tell me you don’t see that shit.”

He peered inside and looked, just for a second.
“I don’t see anything man. Probably just a janitor taking a nap in the supply closet. Happens all the time, did it every day at my old gig. Now hurry up, once we finish this floor we’ll be done.”

We finished up by about 5:30, and left for home. I’d completely forgotten about the encounter for the next month, its strangeness hardly relevant amidst the hectic working schedule we had to maintain. By the time our next cleaning for the building came around, it was out of my mind entirely.

We started the day a little earlier, knowing it would take a few extra hours. Reg and I finished up our work on the 32nd floor, and stopped to eat. We ascended to the roof where our packed lunches waited, and I enjoyed a leftover burger from when I’d grilled the night before. 

Reggie looked up at me from behind his meager salad. “You’ve gotta watch that cholesterol man, that stuff is no joke.” He took his next sip of water with his heart pills.

I shrugged. “You’re just jealous you can’t have these no more,” I chuckled through a juicy bite. 

We wrapped up, and climbed back down into the rig and descended to the 31st floor to begin the second half of our day. As we made it down, I began to wipe down the glass, when something inside caught my eye. The entirety of the 31st floor was dark, with every light turned off inside. In the darkness, however, I saw the same shadowy man sitting in the dim emptiness once more, just watching us. His chair was closer to the window this time around, and even though I still couldn’t make out any details of his appearance, I could see his teeth, white and perfect, beaming at me through a sly smile. He was holding something that glinted in the sunlight in his hand, resting it on the arm of the chair. I couldn’t make it out.

“Hey, hey Reg, he’s here again! Look!”

Reg peered inside. “I thought he was on floor 30? I don’t see anything in there man, you’re starting to freak me out.”

I looked back inside, cupping my hands over the glass to get a better look at the figure. 

“You don’t see that shit? Dude is just staring at us, he’s in an armchair like ten feet behind the glass, he’s smiling all creepy-like.”

I felt Reggie’s hand grab the back of my harness and pull me away from the window. He looked at me sternly.

“Hey man, if there’s anyone in there staring at you it’s because you’re looking inside when you’re supposed to be working. I want to get home before six today, let’s get back to work.”

Once more, we finished our work for the day, but the man inside didn’t leave my mind so easily this time.

When we returned a month later, Reg could tell I was nervous as we descended.

“Look Paul, if it’s about that dude, he’s probably just the guy who hired us, making sure we’re doing our job. Don’t wig out about it, okay?”

I nodded. We finished our work on floor 33, and descended to 32. I could tell before the cart stopped moving that the floor was entirely dark. We stopped, and I jumped back as I saw the shadowed figure of a man sitting five feet from the glass. It was still too dark to see him in full, but that damn smile would have been visible from a mile away. His hand, hanging over the side of the chair, was loosely holding a gun.

I tried to ignore it. I tried to put my mind aside from the man in the window, but after several minutes, began to hyperventilate. I sat down in the cart, and nearly dropped my squeegee off the side down to the street below.

Reg nearly yelled at me. “Dude, would you stand the hell up and stop rocking the cart? My heart can’t take this shit! We’re getting paid out the nose for this, can we just finish and leave?”

I stood, shaky and panting as I peered back inside. The man was gone.

I almost quit. I didn’t know if I was hallucinating, or if someone in the building was messing with me, but Reg swore over the course of the next month that every time I’d freaked out, he never saw a soul inside. It took reminding myself that we just had one more cleaning before I could be done with the place and that I’d be walking away with a hefty check to make me return. 

On the day of the last visit, I braced myself. It was overcast that day, and in the dim daylight I knew I’d have perfect visibility inside the windows. I prepared to see the same shadowy figure inside, his same smile as close to the glass as possible. I even prepared to see his gun, pointing out at me. But I knew he wouldn’t hurt me. After all, it was just in my head, right? Low oxygen from the altitude, or just stress getting to me, surely.

At 7:10, I loaded myself into the bosun’s chair from the roof, and harnessed myself in. Reg looked over to me, putting his hand on my shoulder. 

“Hey man, you cool? We’ll try to wrap up early today, but I can’t have you freaking out again.”

I took a shaky breath. “Yeah… yeah man, I’m good.”

I pulled the handle, and our cart began to slowly lower to the 33rd floor windows. He’d been one floor higher up each time, and I doubter the pattern would break today. 

I shut my eyes tight until the cart jolted to a stop. Then, slowly, I cracked them open. As I’d expected, the lights were off. I flinched- but then then exhaled. The room was empty.

I stared almost in disbelief for a moment, and let out a laugh of relief. I approached the glass, peering in, and I felt my face stretch into a smile as the fear lifted off my shoulders.

“See? No one. I told you you’d be fine, man.”

As I stepped away from the glass, my eyes unfocused from the room inside, and I looked at my own reflection, cast in shadow from the clouds above and smiling ear to ear.

The smile faded from my face, but the smile that my reflection wore did not. Large and toothy, its shadowed face wore a sickening grin, one that didn’t quite reach its eyes. I looked down at its hand, where my squeegee should be, and saw only a gun, gripped loosely with a finger on the trigger. I watched as my reflection’s smile grew impossibly wide, before it suddenly turned, arm outstretched, pointing the gun towards Reggie’s own reflection.

Bang.

Reggie fell back, his body toppling over the railing. He would have fallen over the side onto the pavement 33 stories below, but his harness held firm, dangling him over the edge.

By the time I managed to pull him back over and swiftly get us up to the roof, he was already gone. The medics said he suffered a heart attack, and he was dead before he knew what had happened.

I don’t know what it was I saw in that building, but  for obvious reasons, I’m not a window cleaner anymore. I don’t want to sound paranoid or anything, but I think he’s following me. It doesn’t happen often, but sometimes, when I catch my reflection in passing, I swear it’s smiling at me.
