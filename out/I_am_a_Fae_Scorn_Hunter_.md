I awoke to the steady ringing of my alarm clock and rolled over in my bed to turn it off. Reaching out a hand from the warm confines of my blanket, I swatted haphazardly at my nightstand, knocking my glass of water to the floor instead.

 “Damn it...” I muttered to myself under my breath, now focusing more on the alarm clock and successfully shutting it off. I rolled back over to the center of my bed and stretched, a high-pitched whine escaping my throat as I did. It was a good stretch. I slowly sat up in bed and blinked. Blunked? Blank? I opened and closed my eyes a few times to clear away the hazy clouds that blanketed my vision.

 Stretching and yawning once more, I gently tossed my blankets to the side, rotated in my bed, and got up. I only took one step and slipped on the water I knocked over, dropping an elbow John Cena would have been proud of straight to my nightstand. A sharp icy pain radiated up my arm because, of course, I hit my funny bone. It wasn’t funny. My lamp fell over too, and it knocked the plug to my alarm clock out of the wall. The offending glass of water was kicked in the fall and sent violently skittering across the floor until it shattered against the wall nearest my door. It was too early for this shit.

I lay there for a moment as I processed what had just happened. My not-so-funny feeling arm lay draped over my eyes. The water soaked through my boxers and now my left butt cheek was wet too. I want to go back to bed.

  Pulling myself together, I rose unsteadily to my feet. The discombobulated coordination of my still half-asleep body struggled slightly during this task. I took a second to look around the room, taking it in and rubbing my sore elbow.

With a defeated sigh, I bent over and picked up the lamp, inspecting it for damage. Everything looked good to me. I set the lamp on the nightstand then leaned back down and plugged in the alarm clock. I set it back up on the nightstand, too. I’ll set the time sometime later. Famous last words? Maybe.

I glanced around once more before I sluggishly made my way out of my room, making sure to avoid shards of glass I did. I headed straight down the hallway towards the bathroom to do my business and take a shower. I entered the bathroom and lightly pulled the door shut behind me. I didn’t have any roommates, but I’ve always had a bad habit of “sneaking” around. I often got accused of scaring people. Anyway, I stripped down, turned on the shower to pre-heat it, and then took my rightful place upon my porcelain throne. It was more like a plastic lawn chair, but you know, potato tomato.

 Once I finished my business, I stepped into the shower. I adjusted the knobs as it was just a little too hot, making it perfect. I stepped in and stood with my back to the shower head, water running over my shoulders and down my chest. I rolled my head side to side, getting satisfying little pops as I did. I leaned forward, bracing my hands on the wall and hanging my head. I started thinking about this girl from work, Phyllis.

Damn, was she beautiful. She had the best personality, an intoxicating smile, and a perfect body. Right now, I especially like her body. My mind started to wander in the comfort of my privacy, a steamy scenario beginning to develop a plot in my mind's eye.

I let my thoughts run rampant as I pondered her form. I slowly slid my hand down my chest, past my waist, and gently \[MASSAGED MY KNEECAPS\], going faster and faster as my eyes slid shut. It just wasn’t enough. Hesitantly, almost gingerly, I spat on my thumb and ran my hand down the small of my back. Then, I \[PLAYED THE GUITAR\] as fast as I could. Harder and faster, I thought. The steam of the shower was now a thick fog that clung greedily to my skin. Sweat and dew dripped from my body. My breath became labored as my body tensed. Harder. Faster. I kept going until I couldn’t hold it in anymore, and finally, I \[READ THE BIBLE\].

I continued my shower and finished rinsing the rest of the soap off my body, turned the faucets off, and stepped out of the shower. I grabbed my towel and dried off my face, hair, and then the rest of my body. I fanned my hand back and forth to clear away the misty murk that my shower had created. I don’t know why I did this, it’s not like I can make steam disappear. To further add to the “Why am I like this” questions, I wiped off the mirror to see myself in it. You know as well as I do that that doesn’t work right after a hot shower.

The air was hot, thick, and sticky. It was stuffy, hard to breathe. I put my towel on its hanger and grasped the dripping doorknob. With a sudden bolt of energy that tickled my frontal lobe, I threw open the door with way too much gusto and yelled a long, drawn out “RAH!” as I crab-walked, naked, out of the bathroom. I raised my hands like little crab pinchers while I continued my sideways scuttle back down the hallway to my room.

Ok look... the intrusive thoughts win far more often when you don’t live with anyone. Don’t judge me, ok? I bet you’re weird when no one’s around, too.

I entered my room, making little “mirp” sounds as I did. My tiny, pinchy, hand-claw crab pinchers pinching feverishly in the air as I did. I was facing my wall as I moved around the room, avoiding the broken glass to the best of my abilities. I crab-walked all the way around to my dresser before finally assuming the upright position millions of years of evolution had bestowed upon me.

 Sighing dramatically, I flopped over at the waist and began grabbing various articles of clothing from their drawers, when suddenly from behind me, someone loudly exclaimed through a barely contained laugher; “What in the actual fuck was that?”

  Let me tell you, if I hadn’t shit before my shower, I would have evacuated my bowels with a force equal to that of a rocket launching right there in my bedroom. My stomach sunk so far through my body that I was certain I’d at least pushed that out.

I shrieked a very manly, strong, high-pitched shriek, diving onto my dresser and hitting the wall as I did. It wasn’t voluntary. I didn’t want to smack the wall, but I was startled, ok? They saw it all. They heard it all. They knew too much. I had to kill them. Wait... That isn’t important. Who the fuck is in my bedroom?!

With all the grace of a paraplegic turtle, I gracefully rolled off my dresser and landed on my head and shoulders, just as intended. I grunted because I wanted to, and not because I knocked the wind out of myself. I then thrashed around violently on the floor as I oriented myself and found my footing. Standing upright, I spun around to confront the person in my room. Only it wasn’t a person.

 A tiny figure fluttered like a dragonfly in late summer in the middle of my room. I blunk hard, hoping it was a leftover soap bubble from my shower. Nope. I blonked again. Still there, it was very real. A little, chubby, winged man was right there, hovering over my bed. This pint-sized guy was no taller than my smartphone. He dressed in a green, shimmering gown. His little wings, beating blindingly fast, sparkled like lights through a prism. And his hair, oh his hair was a sight. He had hair that looked like it had a passionate affair with a unicorn, while still somehow also balding. His eyes pierced the air with their deep golden intensity.

He continued to look at me, growing concern shown on his face. “What did you just...” He trailed off as he stared at me, slack-jawed.

“I uh—” I began. “I blunk to make sure I’m actually seeing you?" I replied, a heavy dose of surreal confusion seasoned my words.

“No, no, not that.” he said, waving his hand back and forth and sinking a little closer to my bed “What were you doing when you entered the- wait.” he cut himself off, “Did you just say blunk?”

“I uh... yeah?” I replied, suddenly feeling even more self-conscious than I already was.

 The fairy raised his hand to his face and groaned loudly. “You’ve got to be kidding me!” he huffed with an exasperated sigh, “The one I’m supposed to get doesn’t even know it’s BLINKED?” he finished, his hand falling away from his face.

 I knew it was blinked! I had it right the first time!

“Wow, rude.” I said, blushing from the embarrassment once more. “And wait why are you- why is a-” I stammered, trying to find my words after my mouth already started moving.

 “Why is there a fairy in your room?” he offered, his expression now deadpan.

 I nodded my head slowly in agreement. He seemed to study me for a moment as he thought some things over. His eyes darted back and forth between mine, and I somehow began to feel even MORE exposed than I already was.

 He ran his tongue over his teeth, made a little clicking sound, and then began to speak. “I am Myff, a guardian of the realms, both Fae and human,” he said in a voice that sounded both soft and childlike, as well as wizened and old. He spun his hand in a small forward rolling gesture. "I was sent here by the Seelie court to--”

“You’re a guardian of umm, both realms?” I interjected, cutting him off. My brain did not like this.

 Annoyance flashed across his face. “Yes. BOTH realms. The Fae realm AND the human realm. I was sent here by the Seelie court to--”

 “What's the Seelie court?” I cut him off again, “How did you get in here? Why are you-” A static-like sensation crackled forth and filled the room. It was at this moment I knew.. I fucked up.

 “SILENCE!” he bellowed at a volume far greater than anything his size should be able to make, and I was simultaneously slammed down to my knees by an invisible force that I had no hope of defying. He rose higher in the air, almost until he hit the ceiling. Bewildered, I struggled to raise my head and looked at him.

Slowly the invisible pressure began to lessen and I was left with the fresh pain of being slammed down onto my knees. My knees now throbbed, my not-so-funny-feeling elbow still hurt, my head was spinning, and I remembered I was still stark naked. I felt light headed and sick.

Myff glared at me for a moment, studying me again. I can fully understand why he’s a guardian, now. I made a mental note to not cut him off again. The pressure dissipated from my shoulders while Myff lowered himself down to my eye level, floating in front r to me.

 He stopped a few inches from my face and spoke “I am Myff,” he said with a quiet voice, yet booming with a level of authority. “I am a Guardian of both realms and YOU, Ash, will be silent when I speak.” His eyes bore holes through my soul.

 “I’m s-sorry.” I managed to croak out, breaking eye contact. “It won't happen again. I’m sorry. I’m listening.” My head now bowed, and I stared at the floor.

 Pleased by the reply, Myff began once more. “I am a Guardian of both realms,” pausing slightly, as if expecting another interruption, “and I was sent by,” another pause and glare, “the Seelie,” pause, “court to--”

 I violently threw up. Like exorcism levels of projectile vomit. I was like a baby, full of milk, held above a first-time parent’s face. It went everywhere.

“Oh, for fuck sake!” Myff yelled, throwing his hands up.

 “...erm.. serry...” I slurred, wincing through the awful taste of bile in my mouth. The room was spinning now, and I couldn’t hold it together any longer. “I thing I'm gunna... fent.” The words felt like water leaving my mouth. I promptly fell over, listening to Myff in a rant with more cursing than other normal words. I blacked out before I even hit the floor. I was out like a light.

I slowly regained consciousness sometime later, my head pounding worse than a clubbed seal. I groaned and tried to sit up, noticing I was in a strange place. I sat up, bathed in soft, ethereal light.

 I sat within a circle of toadstools, their tops glowing softly with an otherworldly light. The air around me was alive with the symphony of a lively forest. Gigantic ferns rustled as if sharing secrets, and the trees seemed to whisper their ancient tales. Fireflies danced in the warm, golden light that filtered through the dense canopy above.

 “What the fuuuuuck...?” I muttered in amazement.

 A delicate voice cut through the stillness. "I'm sorry about that, Ash. I didn't mean to knock you out, but you were being annoying."

Blinking, I turned my head to see Myff perched on a mushroom-like stool nearby. His expression seemed to dance between regret and amusement.

 I mustered a weak smile. “Sorry about that, I thought you were trying to kill me honestly."

 Myff's wings quivered as he arose and floated closer, his eyes filled with contrition. "I really didn't mean for it to come to that. I was sent by the seelie court to find a hunter and it hasn’t gone well so far." Landing on the mushroom next to me, he continued, “When I used my magic to make you submit, I guess I sent all the blood to your legs.” He was the one avoiding eye contact now. “And... you passed out from that.” He let his voice trail off, inviting me to continue the conversation.

 I stared at the little guy for a moment. He really reminded me of a child who got caught doing something wrong and was now trying to put on a tough act, but the regret was written all over his face. Wait wait wait hold the phone what did he just say? Recruit a hunter?

 “Myff, what did you mean by recruiting a hunter isn’t straightforward?” My brow furrowed and I adjusted myself to fully face him. “And also, where the fuck are we?”

 Swiftly rising from his seat, Myff whisked into the air and began to fly around the clearing. “I’ll answer your questions one at a time.” He mused. He was incredibly nimble for being such a stout little winged potato “First off,” he started, “We are in the land of Fae. This is the realm that neighbors your own. This is a realm of nature and spirits, riddles and rules, light and dark.” Myff flew straight up into the sky, then let his body fall limply back to the ground. He stopped himself at the last moment from hitting the ground. “As for talk of hunters, that will need more detail.”

 I silently regarded him, waiting for him to continue as he rose back up.

 “Where do I even start?” He pondered his options for a moment as he slowed down to hover next to me. “Are you aware of cryptids?”

 “Well, sure.” I replied, reflexively rubbing the back of my neck. “You mean things like creatures from folklore, right?” I adjusted myself to get more comfortable. My butt hurt.

 He nodded in agreement. “Can you tell me a few that you know of?”

I suddenly felt very on the spot, glancing sheepishly down as I began to question my own knowledge. “A uh... A Wendingus..” Fuck. Wrong.

“It’s not a test, asshole” Myff exclaimed, laughing softly at my sudden panic, “You know about Wendigos,” He said, annunciating each individual syllable, “and Skinwalkers, and the Chupacabra, right? The big ones you all fan girl about?” He knew from the look on my face that the answer was yes. “As a hunter, you are going to hunt these creatures down and.”

 “WAIT!” I yelled, rising to my feet. “Wait wait wait wait wait woa wait what? Back it up. Cryptids? You want me to hunt cryptids?” My disbelieving shock clearly bled through my voice. “But there’s no way, they’re not actually real!”

Myff scoffed at me, the little dickhead. Squinting through the sun in his eyes, he made a point. “You’re arguing with a fairy in an enchanted forest, in the realm of the Fae, and the first thing you’ve seriously questioned is the existence of something in YOUR world?”

 He had a good point.

 “You have a good point.” I said, “Carry on.” returning to my toadstool stool.

Myff chuckled again and began to settle down once more, putting the sun to his side this time. A soft breeze rustled the trees around us. “Something as simple as a cryptid wouldn’t be cause for interference from the Fae, however.” Apprehension was clear in his voice. I sat still, focused intently on his words. “The reason we need you, and people like you, is because these cryptids... are...” once again making that rolling motion with his hand as if he was trying to lure out the rest of his thought. “Finding ways to eat the Fae. They're becoming... fusions of lore... and magic.” he managed. Taking a pause and then a deep breath, he continued, “We call them Fae Scorn. The amalgamations of nightmare and flesh, cryptid and Fae.”

Cryptids, the stuff of late-night radio shows, Reddit posts, YouTube stories, and blurry photographs. Monsters under the bed, right? But here I was, coming face to face with a truth I couldn't dismiss. But one that intrigued me. Myff's words echoed in my mind, his voice tinged with a cautious gumption.

Cyptids really are really real. That’s reality. It’s really actually really concerning. They're not just mythical creatures from campfire stories. They're out there, and they're feeding on the Fae somehow. Something is changing in our world.   I listened to Myff as he went on to explain some of the sightings, and some hybrids he knew of. I was so enraptured with his stories that I had almost forgotten what he wanted me to do. Did I hear that right?

“Hey, Myff.” I cautiously said, raising my hand in an apologetic gesture for cutting him off yet again, the woozy fear of earlier not forgotten. Swallowing the inner bees, I pressed on. “I don’t have any powers, I don’t have any special skills aside from my ability to crab-walk well enough to fool my cat, and I’m not brave or heroic. There’s no way you have the right guy. Right?” I was starting to hurt my own feelings, Myff quietly listened. “I mean, if you’re assembling the A team, the Avengers of the Fae, you need someone far better than me.” I hung my head low and intertwined my fingers, tears beginning to well in my eyes. I really wasn’t much when it came to the big picture, was I? I continued “I don’t--”

 Myff slapped the shit out of me. Like... Hard. With one little flick of his tiny arm against my delicate, beautiful, and manly face, I was sent flying off my toadstool stool in an arching corkscrew. I realized, as I was spinning towards the ground like a torpedo, that I was still naked. This was like doing a helicopter, but way more complicated. And horizontal.

 I landed about 10 feet away from my starting position. Thankfully, my face broke the fall. I opened my eyes as I slid across the grass, getting a whole new look at my toes thanks to the scorpion pose I was now in. I stopped my slip n’ slide adventure in a heap a few feet later.

  I lay still briefly, a weird flood of euphoria devouring my pain. My fingers instinctively brushed against the dew-kissed grass, and the moisture clung to my skin like the delicate droplets of a morning mist. It was as if the earth itself was sharing its secrets with me, inviting me to be part of this timeless dance of life and renewal. In that tranquil moment, lying in the sun-dappled field, I felt connected to the earth in a way I'd never experienced. The dreamy sensations of dewy grass on my face were a reminder that nature's beauty was not just something to behold but to be immersed in, a source of endless wonder.

I felt like the silver lining of a lofty cloud. I felt like I was soaring. I gradually teetered back up to my feet, and I felt all... wibbly wobbly. I felt wrong. Something I was seeing wasn’t right. What was it? The dreaminess made it hard to pinpoint. I closed my eyes, focusing on my breathing until the haziness began to clear away, and then I opened my eyes. I knew what it was right away.

 My head was wrong. Like, it was backwards. I was staring at my own butt, it didn’t look half bad if I’m being honest. But oh fuck. Did Myff break my neck?!

 “MYFF!” I screamed in my manly, high pitched, warbly voice, “AHHHHHHHHHHH!” The sound was unvoluntary and I began flapping my arms like a baby birb kicked from its nest. I sounded like a gargoyle in heat. I think. I guess that’s what they sound like, I don’t know. I’ve never actually heard one before. Anyway.

 “AHHHHHHHH!” Myff mirrored my screams as he rushed to my side.

“AHHHHHHHH!” I screamed again.

“AHHHHH!” Myff screamed, now flying around me.

“MYFF! OH MY GOD! WHAT THE FUCK!?” I screamed while I tried to figure out how to turn my body with this new perspective. If I walked forward, I went backward from my perspective. But if I tried to walk backward, my legs were also on the wrong side. My brain didn’t know how to process fine motor skills. I settled for unsteady shaking and stumbling since that seemed to turn me well enough. I was trying to see Myff. "MYFF!" I yelled his name once more.

 The dappled clearing that was once a shining example of serenity now brought me a feeling of fear. The soft sunlight no longer felt like it was nurturing my soul. Now, it felt like the sun wanted to blind me. It was hard to breathe through my twisted neck. Each step rocked my world back and forth. At this point, I was utterly terrified.

 But all is well that ends well.

Myff shot out of the forest at blinding speeds, just barely registering as something perceptible in the corner of my vision. He flew to where I wobbled and stopped in front of my nose. I must've looked like a wreck; head upside down, ugly crying that made me drool, which then ran into my nose, and over my eyes, and through my hair.

"You look disgusting." Myff commented under his breath, obviously disgusted.

"No shit you pompous mosquito! You broke my neck!" I yelled and flailed my arms again, but I stopped because it made my head bounce around, and that was no bueno.

 It was then that I noticed Myff was glowing green and yellow. He was radiating a buzzing energy that tickled the back of my eyeballs and gave my ears an erection. It's hard to explain. Have you ever Q-tipped your ears and hit it juuuuuust right? It was like that, but better somehow.

Myff's face of disgust dissolved into his stoic, deadpan, resting bitch ass bitch face. "Has it not occurred to you yet that something outside of your understanding is happening?" he questioned me flatly.

 "Of course it has," I ugly cried. "You broke my neck! I’m looking at my own butt crack!" Slimy drooly snooty tears covered my face.

 Myff did his shitty little shit eating shitfaced chuckle, and then asked me a very obvious question.

"Why aren't you dead, Ash?" One of his eyebrows was raised quizzically.

Actually... I was at a total loss for words. Why wasn't I dead? There's no way I should have been able to survive having my head spun like top while it was still attached to my body.

 Myff then gently placed one hand on my forehead, calmly caressing my cheek with the other. The energy he was giving off made my eyes sneeze, twice.

He embraced me, warmly swaddling my spittle slicked head. I felt my worry melt away instantly. It was intensely calm. Myff leaned over to my ear, and I heard him inhale a shallow breath before he whispered, "Ash?" His little breath tickled my ears. "You're being a little bitch." He then counter-broke my neck. Unbroke it? He threw my chin like the baseball your dad never threw for you.

 My new scream of surprise came out like a turkey gobble as my head snapped back into place. I felt like a leggo in a vaccuum for some reason. I looked up at Myff just in time to see him wiping my amalgamated snotty drool out of eyes. He looked a little green around the gills. Not that he has gills. Gills like the figure of speech or whatever that's called. He looked sick. But not like... cool sick... Like ill. But not like totally dude gnarly ill, but like he was going to vomit. Serves him right.

 Now that my head was right, I just went and sat down. I know, boring. What else are you supposed to do when a fairy breaks your neck and then unbreaks it? Dance? No. I went and sat back down on my toadstool stool, breathing deeply. After centering myself once more, I asked the now obvious question, “Why didn’t that kill me?”

 Myff buzzed over to me, looking at me incredulously, before he went on to explain in incredible detail, and with lots of necessary information, exactly what was going on. He told tales of ancient Fae power, humans being born with latent Fae abilities, and Fae being born with human abilities (they get depression and develop a fear of doorbells, tragic).

 As it would happen to be, I am someone with latent Fae powers. I’ve had them my whole life, and they were always active. I’ve just never “basically died” before to know it. I guess I should explain the power before I get too far ahead of myself.

According to Myff, my power makes me a Stitcher, or a battle tank of sorts. We’re called stitchers because our abilities allow us to take on a lot of big boo boos and we’ll stitch ourselves and our wounds back together from the brink of death. We can still die though. Like, cutting off our heads, taking too much blood etc. we die. We also apparently develop excessive strength with some training.

 The reason my neck didn’t unbreak automatically was that I didn’t set it straight for my powers to work right. That's why Myff broke and unbroke me, to demonstrate. Myff is violent when he wants to show you something... I’m going to keep that in mind.

Beyond Stitchers, there are Riddlists, Savagers, and Etherealists. I’ll go into [more detail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAQwt8pDJww&list=PLazBaFqmod1fx1dcIZ\_j1Y5G1Zftum3mu&index=1) about these in the future. K baii
