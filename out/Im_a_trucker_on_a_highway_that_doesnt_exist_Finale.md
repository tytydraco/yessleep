*Many lose themselves on the road. For most, it’s accidental. For some, it’s purposeful.*

*While we generally advise against practices that may result in personal harm, in the end, it’s a personal choice how much of yourself you leave or how much of yourself you bring back. And perhaps even we are wrong.* 

*Perhaps no one truly loses themselves on the road.*

*Perhaps they are merely heading somewhere new.*

Alright then.

For those of you who’ve made it this far, I want to say―well, a lot of things. Let's start with thanks. Really. For those who haven't made it this far…I mean I'm gonna assume you aren't here, by definition, so nevermind.

When I first started posting my experiences on Route 333, it was a way to pass the time between hauls. I never expected so many people to offer so many words of comfort and support. Things can get lonely on the road, especially for someone like me. It’s easy to just slip away. You’ve all helped me not do that.

There are so many things I feel I should say to you all before I wrap things up. It’s a bit embarrassing to admit, but I’ve typed up literally a dozen different versions of farewells. None of them feel quite *right*. 

The thing my mind keeps returning to is a childhood memory. I’m not totally sure why. It’s not a particularly relevant memory―maybe not even a *real* one―but I thought I’d share that instead of an official goodbye. The feeling of it seems fitting. 

I’m on my booster seat with my face pressed against the cold car window. Speckles of rain clump and slide down the glass. Outside, it’s storming. Inside the car is warm.

We’re heading somewhere. I don’t know where. You usually don’t know where as a child, but neither do I especially care. I’m more focused on the distant shapes in the rain. Between the trees, they twist into forms, constantly on the verge of tangible but always disappearing the moment before it’s clear what they are.

“What’s out there?” I ask.

My mom leans to me from the passenger seat and gives my knee a squeeze. “It doesn’t matter, Brendon. We’re in here.”

My eyes grow heavy. I fall asleep to the sound of raindrops.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The end of the road.

The sight was bizarre to say the least. It didn’t dissolve into gravel. There were no potholes or cracked asphalt signaling abandonment. The highway was perfectly maintained up until the point it cut cleanly away. Wild forest stretched beyond.

I walked up and down, examining it.

Could we walk back? Without a vehicle, and with Autumn’s lane-locking, how long would that take? Decades at least, and even then…This felt *different* somehow. 

Route 333 wasn’t trying to divert us from our next move. It wasn’t slowing us down. It had simply decided *game over*. Without it, there likely wasn’t even a way back to the real world.

Wind tousled my hair. Autumn was still in the cab of my rig, entirely unaware of our newfound predicament. Did it even qualify as that? *Predicament* implied a problem, something that could be puzzled over and solved, but this? This new reality was so absolute.

For a long time I merely gazed into the forest. Eventually, I sat. My eyes slid closed. I waited.

It was odd. In my time on Route 333 I'd felt every conceivable emotion: anger, loss, betrayal, hope, relief, fear. I'd met so many people, seen so many things that shouldn't have been possible, and clenched my fist against enemies in ways I never imagined I'd be brave enough to do. I’d felt afraid. So afraid and so many times. I'd experienced everything a life could hold in the space of months.

This though? What I felt now? It was a new sensation for Route 333 and one I couldn’t entirely name. It was like lying on the beach and waiting for the waves to bury me beneath the sand, inevitable but not altogether horrifying.

A breeze rustled the leaves. Pine tree branches battered against one another, and bird wings flapped overhead―and something else. My eyes remained closed.

I turned my ear towards the noise, straining to make it out. *Crying.* Something was weeping out there in the forest. The sound grew clearer. I waited until the noise was right in front of me, feet away, before relaxing my spine and taking a look.

A child peeked out from behind a tree. Boy or girl, I couldn’t tell. We locked gazes.

“The real thing from my trailer would have driven me mad to look at,” I said. “You aren’t it.”

The child ducked its head behind the thick trunk. When it popped out on the other side, it was taller, an adult. Not just any adult.

“Myra,” I said.

She flattened her blouse.

“Choose someone else. Please.”

She only shrugged as if to say *well, I have to take the form of something.*

I started to protest, but already this simulacrum of my ex-girlfriend was walking toward me and sitting cross-legged to mirror my own pose. Her on the side of sticks and weeds. Me on the pavement. 

I studied her. “You aren’t one of the hitchhikers. You're something else.”

She stared at me. Her chest made no movement. She wasn’t breathing.

“What do you want?” My patience was souring. “What was the point of coming if you’re just going to sit there?”

“Nothing,” she said. “There is nothing I want.”

It took me aback. The voice―it sounded just like Myra, though with a hint of something *other* to it. I hadn't honestly expected her to speak, but now that she had, I had to respond.

 “Even trees want water.”

“Then I want nothing you would understand. We are not real in the same way, you and I.”

She lifted a hand and examined both sides. She paused on a vein and studied it in interest. Blood pumped enthusiastically through it. With her other hand she pushed a sharpened nail experimentally into the skin, further and further, until finally it broke.

For a few seconds, the severed vein gushed with blood, dark spurts intermingled with the red. She sniffed, licked at the wound. Smiled. Eventually, she shook her hand and the bleeding ceased. 

The skin of her hand was smooth.

“Why are you here?” I asked.

“I’m always here.”

“So you’re the highway.”

Myra shrugged. *Yes. No. To you it makes no difference.*

It took me longer than it should have to realize she hadn't spoken the words. Her lips hadn't moved at all. I hadn't even necessarily *heard* them, and yet they’d impressed themselves unbidden in my mind almost like they’d been my own thoughts. Perhaps they had been.

“But you’re the one who stole the road,” I said.

“Is it stealing when you clip your own fingernails?”

“And what is the road? If you’re the highway―or part of it somehow―then what are you exactly?”

“What you perceive as one thing can really be many things.” 

I sighed. “While I do admire your devotion to speak in cryptics, I’ve just had some very long, rather unpleasant last few days to which you're currently contributing. Any chance we could chat like normal people?”

Myra only relaxed into a maddeningly knowing smile. *Do you think me a person?*

In a way, I did. Perhaps that was the point of her form: to put me off guard. It was working. Consciously, I knew this wasn’t Myra. It didn’t even act like her, but on a deeper level, I already trusted her. 

This was the girl who’d selflessly loved me for most of the last three years. She’d brought me soup when I was sick and rubbed my back when I would study for exams. Myra was the person that even months later, I trusted completely, always, without reservation.

And I’d left her.

Despite everything that was going on, the danger and the hopelessness of this whole situation, a sudden, unresolvable sadness filled me from my chest to my throat.

“Please,” I choked out, clenching my eyes to keep tears from welling up. “Be something different.”

When I opened my eyes, Myra was gone. 

Something dark, ghoulish, and malevolent stared back at me, more terrible than any inhabitant I’d seen on the road. A roaring, throbbing pounding built in the back of my skull. I blinked again.

The thing was gone.

It was my own face I stared at.

He didn’t smile. There was none of the playfulness of the child or the confidence of the girl. Not even the evil of the last thing. This new boy merely sat across from me. There was a heaviness behind his eyes, *my* eyes. They could stare directly at the sun and still see only dark. They could shut for a thousand years, and still be weary when they opened.

It clicked.

“You’re a mirror,” I said. “Whatever you are, the highway or an impossibility, or―or whatever―you’re also me. *Us*.”

His face gave away nothing.

“If I’m right, then you know how badly we want to get out. You *understand* it. Why are you trapping us? Autumn was so close.”

“You were never close. Your trick was a hollow plan. The girl will never stop suspecting you of trying to save her, no matter what deceit you attempt, because she knows you will never give up. The only manner in which you made it this far is because I allowed it, as I allow the wanderers to traverse where they will.” *Hitchhikers,* my brain automatically filled in. 

“There is no need to restrict them,” he continued, “not when their kind is so restricted by boundaries. Conditions are in place to allow safe passage of misplaced cargo, but the girl has not fulfilled those conditions.”

“Then lane-lock her again,” I said. “Give us back the road, but leave her lane-locked. Both of us if you want.”

“You’re close to the end now. She would be gone within a handful of turnings.”

“So what? Why does it matter?”

He tapped a single finger against his chapped lips. Again, the foreign words popped up in my mind. *A reflection does not exist without something to reflect.*

“You’d disappear then? That’s why you want us?”

“As has been stated,” he said. “I don’t desire in the same way that you do you. I may speak with you, converse in a form similar to your own, but that does not change my nature. I don’t want you. I simply cannot let you go. It would unbalance me. There are rules in place.”

“Then why are you here!” Familiar anger warmed me. “You wanted to gloat, that’s it?”

“Remove her from the vehicle, and I will let you pass. You still have many years on the road.”

“Oh, yeah?” 

Instead, I cussed him out.

My mirrored-face, already hard, turned to stone. 

The branches around him dried, shriveled, and split. Inky, hard-shelled beetles and writhing maggots scuttled out from hidden places in the ground, crawling up his clothing and squirming up his neck. He opened his mouth and they piled in. His eyes―my eyes―darkened and expanded. They bulged in his skull. They popped.

Rotting fluid splattered my face and arms. I spit and gagged.

Behind me came a ripping, tearing, crunching. Despite the atrocities in front of me, I whirled. The freight container had collapsed in on itself, fully crumpled. The cab where Autumn slept was untouched, but the threat was obvious. We were only alive, because the highway was letting us be alive. Such omnipotent power should have terrified me.

Instead, I understood.

This thing could scare us, but it wouldn't kill us. It needed us to survive. Without people to occupy it, the road would shrivel to nothing at all, the carcass of a living thing, an abandoned warehouse set to blaze. Lane-locking unlocked pockets of reality that would never otherwise exist. Our very presence seemed to do the same. Route 333 wouldn't kill us―but it wouldn't let both of us go

Through my nose, I let out a long, slow breath. My eyes closed. I pictured Autumn, unconscious and unaware, on my sleeper. I envisioned her watching the back of my truck after every visit, at the gut-sinking feeling of being left alone. Entirely alone. I pictured Tiff at dispatch. Waiting.

“Alright,” I said. “You need a reflection. Take me.”

“Only a willing being may be traded to enter my domain. Only an unwilling being may be traded to leave. The conditions must be met.”

I barked a laugh. “Don’t you see? I *am* unwilling. Without Autumn, there’s no way I’m leaving Route 333. I refuse.”

The thing wearing my body considered.

“You *will* leave eventually,” he said. “We’re close to the end. Once she is gone, you will drive past the barrier as they all wish to do.”

“I’ll stay then.”

“Your promises are smoke in the wind. Perhaps you believe you will stay, but once the deal is made, you will have no reason not to flee. You will hate me as they all do.”

“But that's the best part.” My hand outstretched. I placed it against the person’s face. *My* face. “What must it be like? Maybe you and I aren’t real in the same way, but it can't be easy being hated by every person you've ever trapped―hundreds of years of loathing. If you're the mirror, what sort of shards does that break you into? I’m sorry. I really am.”

His eyebrows narrowed, but he didn't pull away from my touch.

“I don’t hate you,” I said. “Not anymore.”

“You will.”

I shook my head. “You saved me.”

“You broke my rules. I have attempted to extinguish you a multitude of times.”

I laughed. “Fair point. But it's more than that. Before you, my entire life was this gray, meaningless nothingness. Because of you, it's―well―” I took his hand and stretched it across the barrier between forest and road. I pressed the fingers to the pavement and inhaled. “―all of this.”

The sharp scent of pine enveloped us. Moist wood and wildflowers, but more than that: wet cement and gasoline. Metal and asphalt. The smell of nature and material bundled together, of rotting logs and budding flowers, of movement and going and travel and meaning\*.\* The smell of *living*.

“You don’t have to loathe yourself anymore,” I whispered. “I’ll never leave you.”

For a heartbeat, just one, his eyes shimmered―tears perhaps? The first flicker of human emotion?―then he stood, breaking our touch. 

*Deliver her home,* came the words. *Then return.*

He strode into the forest. When he passed behind his first tree, the body that emerged was Myra. When he passed the next, it was the weeping child. On the last pass, nothing reappeared at all. As if his final form was the air itself.

I made my way to the truck where Autumn still slept and turned the key in the ignition. When I looked up, a familiar road wound its way into the trees, snaking back and forth until finally plunging left, into the all-consuming redwoods―how it had always been.

Perhaps the highway had never disappeared at all. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Autumn woke up minutes later. Perhaps the boom of the collapsing trailer had jostled something in her subconscious―“time to get up, sweetie!”―or perhaps the drugs were finally losing their effect.

Either way, she was ticked.

“*How dare you!* You drugged me? We could have died on the way back! You didn’t even ask!”

“I mean, that was sort of the point,” I said.

“Don’t change the topic, you lying, untrustworthy―”

“Tiff made it out too.”

“―sniveling, pathetic… wait, Tiff? She’s out?”

“Yup. Back at dispatch. We’re like five minutes away.”

Autumn stuttered, but already her anger was fizzling. “Well *fine* then. I suppose that’s…acceptable, then.”

I laughed.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The reunion was nothing short of tear-jerking. 

Based on Tiff’s retelling of the last five years of her and her daughter’s relationship I’d expected yelling. A sprinkle of arguing, at the very least, with a dash of awkwardness. Instead, they collapsed into each other's arms, sobbing hysterically, and sank to the floor in the reception area.

Randall and I watched the interaction for a few unsure moments before glancing at each other.

He shrugged. “We should probably…”

“Let them…”

“Yeah.”

“Yep.”

I dragged myself to the break room to feed my ever-increasing coffee addiction―how many hours/days/etcetera had I been awake for now?―where I received my second (Third? Fourth? *Twentieth*?) surprise of the day.

Chris waved at me from the break room table where he was shoveling down a plateful of eggs. He did it all casual too, like *oh Brendon, fancy seeing you here in this high-security bank vault where it isn’t possible for us both to currently be. S’up?*

You’ll be happy to hear, I replied to his wave with one of my signature, snappy quips: “*Uh…*”

“Deidree brought me an hour or so ago.” Chris shrugged. “Pretended she was one of the hitchhikers and waved this pistol around until I got in her trailer. Told her she should quit and go into acting after she explained it all.”

I scanned the room.

“She’s already back out,” he said. “Told me she’s going for Al before it gets too dark.”

“Relentless that one.”

“If she were a few years older, I might ask her out to dinner.” He forked eggs into his mouth and pondered. “Huh. Maybe I will anyway.”

Delightful as it would be to engage with my stand-in grandpa lustfully ruminating about my stand-in grandma, I decided Chris could probably use some alone time. He’d gone through a lot these last few days.

I considered finding a spare couch to nap on, or maybe just heading back to my sleeper, but in the end, there was only one place I was truly sure nobody would come looking for me.

It was odd, entering Gloria’s office after all this time. The door was unlocked, but it was obvious nobody else had dared enter the room since her death. The trash was full; a candy bar wrapper lay fallen on the floor. A half-full glass of water sat on the desk. A white ring circled the spot where the water must have risen to before beginning to evaporate.

Chris, Al, Tiff, Autumn. Most of us had made it out alive, more than I could have hoped for―I turned a photo of Gloria and her family face down on the desk―but not everybody.

I fell asleep instantly. That’s the upside to sleep-deprivation. Racing thoughts at bedtime? Not anymore. Stress-induced insomnia? No problem. The only *slight* downside is spending the majority of your waking hours in a state of constant fatigue.

Left to myself, I suspect I would have stayed asleep for hours. Instead, I stirred awake an hour or two later, groggy but feeling significantly better. Somebody leaned against Gloria’s desk, staring out the window.

“Gah!” I clutched at my heart. “Do you make a habit of watching people while they sleep?”

“Coming from the guy who drugged me,” Autumn said.

*Fair enough.*

“How’d you find me?” I asked.

“This is where I would’ve come.”

Because she knew me. Remarkably, this girl could predict what I was about to say and do in a way nobody else ever had. She understood me.

And yet…

“Hey, Autumn. About the things I said back on the bridge―”

“I know,” she said. “You don’t have to explain anything to me. Actually, I’d prefer you didn’t. You were saying what you had to to get me out. Feelings. Ugh.”

“Gross.”

“Icky.” 

“Mushy.”

We laughed.

“But it wasn’t totally a lie,” I said. “Not all of it. I mean, I’m not in love with you, sorry, but you are my friend, you know? You really do, like, *get* me.”

“Don’t I know it. As soon as you left after the hitchhiker, I knew you’d be back. That’s just what you do. I kept imagining every way you might try to trick me or force me to go with you. I tried not to think about them. It was like… hmm. What’s a good metaphor?”

“How kids keep convincing themselves they believe in Santa for years after they don’t.”

Autumn snapped and nodded. “I tried to convince myself you *wouldn’t* trick me, so that I could believe you when you did―but I would have been willing. For anything else you tried, I would have subconsciously known what you were doing. I’d have been willing.”

Except she had been anyway. That’s what the road had confirmed. In the end, a small hidden part of Autumn had understood what was going on. She’d gone with me willingly, even as she’d denied and ranted and refused.

She hadn't known I was drugging her―that much I believed. But she had believed my other offer, that I would lane-lock myself with her for the next set of decades. She’d refused in the same way you tell your friend *no, you have the last slice of pie,* knowing they’ll say the same back and you still get to eat it. Eventually she would have agreed. Autumn would have let me sacrifice my future for her own.

I hoped she never realized that. What a terrible thing to know about yourself: that you would ruin somebody else’s life so yours could be a little bit better.

Or maybe *I* didn’t understand what five years in isolation could do to a person, the sort of desperate weed that grew from that type of soil.

I stood, approached the desk, and leaned on it next to her. We stared out the same smudged window.

“You know,” I said. “I do think, in another life, if we’d known each other longer and I were a little less broken, I could have meant what I said back there. Been *capable* of meaning it.”

“Oh, Brendon.” She tapped her shoulder to mine. “We’re not broken. We’re just healing.”

For a long time we sat, watching the birds outside, saying nothing at all.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

In the end, I snuck out without a word to anyone. 

Diedree was still gone. Vikram and Estela were out for the day. Autumn was with her mother. Chris had left to see his own daughter, and Randall was―eh. Dunno. Terrorizing a puppy or something?

I selected my favorite rig (one with working A.C., thank you very much), hooked it up to another empty trailer, and set out. It was easier that way. It wasn’t like they couldn’t contact me over the radio or visit me on their hauls. This wasn’t a goodbye forever, not for most of them. It was merely me fulfilling my end of the deal.

As I drove, my mind drifted. I entered a trancelike state. I twisted through the redwoods without true comprehension.

It wasn’t sad, this fate. Not really. 

I wasn’t the same person who’d signed my job offer those months ago. The things I’d told the highway weren’t lies. Maybe I hadn't totally known them until I’d said them, but every word of them had been true. Route 333 had saved me―even if I still didn’t entirely understand who or what Route 333 was exactly. It was us but also its own person. Alive and not. It needed us to exist but formed itself without our permission. Something with desires and something with no desires at all. 

An impossibility.

But I could live with not understanding. Some things you don’t need to comprehend to accept.

It wasn’t gone, for the record. The empty thing inside me. It was still there, squeezing on my heart and stomach―but it *was* less empty. Before it was a hole. Now it was a tunnel: dark and hollow but leading to somewhere new.

I’d done it. 

I’d gotten them out.

Randall knew the secret. So did Chris, Deidree, Autumn, Tiff, and soon,  all of management. As long as they could keep it a secret, they could keep rescuing the other drivers. From now on they could remove impossibilities from our own world without sacrificing drivers in the process.

I rolled down my windows. Crisp evening air gushed through the cab.

My life had been short, but I’d done something good with it. I could be happy with that. Now I could rest.

And then. As I prepared myself for years of pine needles and towering redwoods, as I readied myself for a lifetime of lane-locked driving and moving and finally, *finally,* being able to let go―as I welcomed all of that, the treeline ended.

I careened past the forest section onto a flat stretch of desert I hadn't expected to reach for decades more.

I slowed and stopped.

For a long time, I watched the setting sun lower above distant mountains. Minutes passed. An hour. I didn’t even put the stalling truck into park, just kept my foot clamped down on the brake.

My trance was cut off by the blare of a horn. Another rig pulled up beside me on the wrong side of the road. Deidree rolled down her window.

“Engine problem?” she asked.

“Not exactly.”

“How long you been here? You passed me, what, an hour or so ago? You couldn’t have seen me. I was in a pocket. Saw you appear a mile ahead of me―gosh, I envy you young ones. You get everywhere so quick.”

Finally, I put my vehicle in park. “I assure you. I had no intention of making it this far this quickly.”

She barked a laugh, thinking I’d been joking.

“You take care. I’m off for Al. Hope he’s as much a coward as Chris was.” She plucked a gun from her passenger seat and waved it at me. “It’s a fake, but the shots sound real. You go get some rest. Sounds like you’ve been through the wringer.”

With that, she began rolling up her window.

“Hey Deidree!” I called. “Can I ask―well not to sound judgy, but I’m curious. You have three daughters, don’t you? Why haven’t you quit already? No offense, but isn’t the road a bit *dangerous* for a mom like you?”

“Course it’s dangerous. Life’s dangerous, but I suppose…” Her demeanor changed. She examined her steering wheel in sudden thought. “I’ve considered leaving. Haven’t we all? But I suppose it's because of my daughters I stay. College and all that.”

I slumped into my seat. 

Just as I'd suspected. She stayed because she *had* to. There were people she was protecting, a purpose to the madness, a reason to continue―

“Nah.” Deidree *hocked* and spat out her window. “Know what? Truth is I'd be hauling even without those drama demons. I stay for the same reason as you.”

“Uh. Why’s that?”

“Can’t leave. Every time I’ve thought about quitting, I knew I’d just end up wanting to come back. Sure, it’s dangerous, but there’s nowhere else like here. My day will come eventually. I’ll have to leave, but there’s a lot more miles between then and now. I know it. Road knows it too. Might as well drive.”

“Huh.”

The sun had completely disappeared beneath the horizon. The formerly pink sky had dulled to a dark blue.

“Plus―” Deidree leaned towards me. “―the pay’s great.”

With that, her rig inched forwards. She picked up speed. She vanished into the horizon.

A bit later, I maneuvered my truck into a pullout and turned it around, heading back into the sea of trees. Perhaps it was my imagination or a fatigue-induced hallucination, but as I turned the bend, I swear there was a figure waving at me from behind a tree, one with extra-long fingers and nothing but two nostrils on a perfectly flat face.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I’m a trucker on a highway that doesn’t exist.

I’ve hauled for quite some time now. Not as long as some but longer than others. I spend most of my time on this highway, dangerous as it sometimes is. We have an understanding, it and me.

Sometimes, I leave for short stretches: a week off at my apartment, a trip to my parents, a wedding, a visit to an old friend. It’s never for long, but when I depart, the road will rumble on my way out―not angry, more annoyed. It doesn’t like me gone, but it knows I’m not leaving it in any real way. I’ll come back. 

I always do.

After all, there are things that need transporting, things that are harmful if you leave them in one place for too long. We wish there were an easy answer, a button to push to destroy them or armor to wear to ensure safety in our travels. Instead, the solution is a slow and dangerous one. We resolve this impossible issue one haul at a time. 

It isn't always easy to see the point to the fight when there’s no conclusion in sight, but on those days, I find purpose in a thousand other, microscopic things. A decent cup of coffee. Wildflowers growing somewhere without water. The sun breaking between the branches.

There are hideous things on the road, *deadly* things.

There are beautiful things too.

For many, this highway lengthens over time, forces them to leave this profession. For me, it remains the same length that it’s always been. Even so, I know one day this will all end.

Perhaps something from a side street will lure me away, or I’ll forget to close my window one sweltering summer night. Perhaps a red rain will swallow me whole. Perhaps the words *it is time* will whisper themselves in my mind, almost as if it's my own self thinking them. Then I will drive past impossible canyons and tumbleweeds that roll without a wind to push them, past the laws of physics and reality itself. I’ll set out on a journey to somewhere new and never turn back.

I don’t know how it all ends. Only that it will. There are many miles between now and that eventual conclusion, years even. 

I think I’ll drive a [while longer.](https://www.reddit.com/r/lucasGandola/comments/1oax3n9/youve_been_reading_the_highway_that_doesnt_exist/)
