I painted a portrait of a woman in purple. A woman I’ve never met, and never imagined. 

After what felt like months of creative block, she appeared on the canvas as though the spark that once brought me joy had ignited again—briefly, feverishly—in one night of inspiration. One moment I was nothing; then suddenly, I felt like something, when she stared back at me from the canvas—from her painted world.

She wears a long dress the colour of bruised blueberries—deep violet with undertones of black and shadow, like dried blood beneath the skin. The fabric seems to flow, though I never painted motion into it, pooling at her feet and vanishing into the void from which she rises. Her figure is rough in places, like she’s emerging from the canvas itself, unfinished and raw at the edges. But her face… her face is something else entirely.

It’s sharply defined, eerily symmetrical, yet entirely unfamiliar. The skin is pale, not in a way that suggests illness, but as if it had never known sunlight. Her lips are tight, unsmiling, and her high cheekbones give her a regal, austere bearing. She doesn’t look at you—she looks past you. Her eyes, the only part of her that gleams with life, are fixed somewhere just beyond the viewer. Cold. Measured. Maybe even disappointed. It’s not beauty that caught me, but her gravity, her unknowable presence. She seems ancient. Not in age, but in meaning. As though her expression has been held for centuries and only now remembered.

I still can’t place the emotion in her face. It’s not quite contempt, nor sadness, nor anger. Something I didn’t put there—but which appeared anyway.

In that moment, I believed I had created something perfect. My own brief moment of transcendence, the divine inspiration artists dream of.

That was before I saw the gallery I’d submitted to.

I drove to various art fairs and eventually submitted my piece to a small local gallery—one that specialises in showcasing new and emerging artists. Painters, sculptors and artists alike send in their work to be viewed—admired, dissected, devoured—by the public and critics in equal measure.

Normally, once I’ve submitted a piece, I avoid these events. Part of it is anxiety, but mostly it’s the fear that I’ll unconsciously absorb someone else’s vision—some image or style—and let it worm its way into my own work. It’s foolish, I know. After all, what is art if not a collage of ideas, reimagined and made new?

Then I saw it.

I was browsing through a cityscape—grey buildings under a waning moon, the sort of painting that hums with urban melancholy—when something caught my eye. A smear of colour near the edge of the frame. Subtle. Almost hidden. A violet silhouette standing amid a crowd of faceless, monochrome figures. A purple dress in a sea of black, grey, and white.

The whole painting had touches of colour to break the monotony: warm glows in the windows, a splash of rust on a rooftop, the soft blue of night air. All the hues were restrained, carefully chosen to blend into the palette. But this—this purple—felt deliberate. Uninvited.

I shook my head at the leap of logic.

But the coincidences didn’t stop.

Out of the entire gallery of new submissions—around thirty pieces in total—twenty-seven featured the same distinct hue of purple. At first, I told myself it was a fluke. Purple isn’t exactly a rare colour in artistic palettes. But it wasn’t just the shade; it was the shape. The brushwork. The placement. Again and again, my eyes were drawn to streaks and curves that mimicked the sweep of fabric, the fall of a dress.

In one abstract piece, a storm of violent brushstrokes scattered across the canvas, the violet formed a curve through the chaos—almost like a figure caught mid-turn, her dress trailing behind. Another was a portrait, far more grounded, of a man seated in a lonely café. Reflected in the window behind him, barely visible, was the ghostly image of a woman walking past outside. Her outline smudged, out of focus. Her dress, however, was a clear, unmistakable purple.

Even the sculptures weren’t exempt. One stood near the entrance, a twisting metallic form meant to resemble flowing water. But the artist had inlaid thin veins of coloured resin along the folds—nearly all silver and steel tones, except for one thick ribbon of deep violet that coiled around the base like a hemline. Another sculpture, a jagged interpretation of a crowd in motion, bore a single figure tilted slightly away from the rest. Her form was only suggested by a sweep of bronze and an upturned hand—but draped across her shoulders, worked into the metal patina, was a faint stain of plum.

I just couldn’t stop seeing it. It’s like once you’ve seen a certain pattern, your brain tries to find it everywhere. But no matter how much I tried to dismiss it, I kept returning to each piece, over and over, tracing the shape and colour in the paint.

But she was there. In nearly every piece.

I managed to speak with one of the artists—a young woman in her thirties who had drawn, rather than painted, a striking depiction of a dog mid-stride. It was a beautiful piece, full of motion and life, but what held my attention was the figure in the background: a familiar shape, standing still and silent.

I asked her plainly where the inspiration had come from. She paused only briefly, then offered a simple shrug.

‘I don’t know. One night I just had this image in my head and I had to get it out.’

I held her gaze a moment longer, then pointed to the figure tucked away behind the dog, barely more than an outline—except for the splash of colour.

‘But why purple?’ I asked slowly.

She turned to the drawing, tilting her head as if seeing it anew. The dress was the only coloured element in the entire piece. The rest was black and graphite, charcoal and smudge, yet the fabric glowed with a rich, velvety hue.

She blinked, then smiled faintly.
‘Why not purple?’ she said.

I left her before I said too much. Before I let the realisation spill from my mouth and poison her peace of mind. But the weight of it clung to me all the same. I tried to shake it, to rationalise it, but the paranoia had already taken hold.

I took my painting from its place, suddenly gripped by the desire to hide it—to hide her. I left the gallery as though I were fleeing, as though by removing the piece I might prevent others from acquiring some terrible, esoteric knowledge. Something not meant for the average eye.

By the time I returned home that evening, the images of the day flooded my mind in a relentless assault. The streets, the people, the traffic—the cacophonous orgy of human industry—buzzed and blurred before my eyes, each mundane detail somehow sharper, more menacing, as though the world itself were mocking me for noticing.

I waited. Perhaps a day, perhaps longer—I can’t be sure. I covered her in the studio and lay sleepless, staring at the ceiling, the memory of her gaze drilling into my thoughts. I couldn’t rest. I had to know.

I went online and searched the gallery’s website. I combed through the submissions, flicking through artist bios and their exhibited works. One by one, the connections revealed themselves. Sculptures. Paintings. Sketches. All bearing some trace of her. And all created within the same narrow stretch of time—a single week.

I sat there for hours, maybe longer, my thoughts circling like vultures. I could feel her presence from beneath the dust sheet in the studio, as though her eyes still stared through the layers of fabric. I retrieved my diary and checked the date I had signed the piece—my so-called magnum opus.

It fell within that very same week.

It was too much. I abandoned the thought, tried to let the fear fade, to smother the cold dread that had begun to take root in my chest. But it wouldn’t go. It gnawed at me, quietly, relentlessly, from the back of my skull.

What did it mean?

It had to mean something. It was too close. Too specific. Too precise to be coincidence.

I let the sound of the news play in the background as I delved deeper—my white noise security blanket to keep the silence from feeding her stare any more than it already did. The usual litany of horrors, the terrors humanity inflicts upon itself, droned on from the screen: war, famine, murder, collapse. Always the same.

I began my search—for the woman in purple.

My initial results were frustratingly vague. Search engines gave me nothing but heavily edited photographs of skeletal women draped in garish clubwear, cheap fabric dyed in all the wrong shades of violet.

I had to be specific. I looked for artworks, murals, sculptures of the woman in purple. I saw specific renditions of that but it wasn’t correct. It wasn’t right. I went further back. Into older artworks. Folklore. Forgotten stories. I don’t know how long I spent trawling through archives and obscure forums, chasing shadows in digital catacombs. I barely slept. I barely ate. I just kept going.

Eventually, something surfaced. A thread. Perhaps it was confirmation bias—maybe I was clinging to the one scrap of information that suited my growing hypothesis—but it fit. It slid into place like the missing puzzle piece to an unknowable question.

It was a mural. Old enough that no one seemed to agree where it came from. A forgotten piece tucked away in an abandoned community centre somewhere, photographed once for a now-defunct local blog. No artist credited. No records. Just a single image and a caption that read: “Untitled – 14th century.”

Artistically, it was stunning. Meticulous. Every brushstroke deliberate. Every detail sharp. But the subject matter was… wrong.

It depicted a desolate world, drained of colour and life. A greying, sunless wasteland stretched from edge to edge, as if scorched by some forgotten cataclysm. The earth was fractured—jagged fault lines spiderwebbing across the barren ground like veins beneath diseased skin. From these ruptures rose gouts of smoke, thick and oily, pulsing upward as though exhaled by something alive beneath the surface. The cracks looked like incisions made to bleed the planet dry. And bleed it did, seeping a black ichor that glistened unnaturally under a sky that held no sun, no stars, just a pallid sheen of oppressive grey.

In the haze above, immense shapes coiled within the clouds—too large, too abstract to grasp. Their forms weren’t fully rendered, just hinted at in swirling smears of darkness, as if the artist couldn’t—or wouldn’t—paint them clearly. You couldn’t quite see them, and yet they were there, watching. Every angle of the mural seemed to draw your gaze to their presence, no matter how desperately you tried to look away.

The entire piece had the unsettling quality of a dream you half-remember upon waking—a sense of truth embedded in unreality. A silent scream.

And there, in the midst of it all, stood a figure.

Small. Almost insignificant.

A woman in a flowing purple dress, placed so precisely in the centre that your eyes were drawn to her.

She did not belong. And yet, she fit too well.

Once I found it, I noted the estimated date and documented it carefully. That was the first thread. From there, I pulled and pulled, and what unravelled was… horrifying.

Another painting surfaced—this one a grand family portrait, the kind meant to immortalise prestige. The brushwork was masterful: velvet textures shimmered in the candlelit illusion, silverware caught glints of unseen light, and the floor beneath their polished shoes seemed to stretch into infinity. It was a celebration of inherited grace—except for one figure.

The lady of the house stood at the centre, commanding the composition. Her gown was unmistakably violet, cascading in rich folds like crushed silk or bruised twilight, the only vibrant hue in the otherwise muted palette. But her face—her face was absent. Not erased or unfinished, simply a void. A perfectly circular, impossibly black aperture, so dark it felt dimensional. A negative space that devoured light, bleeding the pigments of the painting into its orbit.

It wasn’t just the canvas—it was the world around her collapsing inward. As though the painter, knowingly or not, had captured a singularity. Not merely facelessness, but obliteration. A visual wound.

The painting was signed and dated: 1666.

Another surfaced: 1914 - titled, The Violet Witness.
Then a sculpture - 1929.
Then 1939.
1986.
2001.

Each one depicting her, or something close. Not always the subject, not always in clarity—but always present somewhere within the art.

And finally, I found a photograph.

A candid moment—a tourist photo found in a digital archive. A family of four stands together, smiling stiffly in front of a low concrete wall, the backdrop a lovely coastal view. It appeared to be taken in Japan. A few dark clouds gather in the distance. The father wears a tucked-in polo, the mother a floral print blouse; the children, mid-laughter, caught in the blur of motion. It’s ordinary. Innocent. The kind of image you’d find in any photo album.

But something lingers at the far edge of the frame.

Just behind the youngest child’s shoulder, half-obscured by the angle, is a smear of colour. A graffiti tag—rough and fast, as though scrawled in haste. Violet purple. Bright and defiant. Not a word. Not a symbol. Just a mark. A stroke. A stain.

The hue is the same. And the abstract shape has a strange, flowing quality—like something mid-movement, or mid-emergence.

I checked the timestamp in the digital archive.

10th March, 2011.

I stared at the dates for a long time. All marked by that same violet stain. By her. It felt like a punch to the chest.

I now listen to the news. Wondering what is to happen. Wondering if I can change something. If I should try to warn someone—anyone.

But what use is that?

Would they believe me? That a colour, a face, a figure haunts the brushes of painters and the minds of creatives? That she appears like a stain on the world, moments before it bleeds? That she’s watching us now, waiting? They’d call it madness. They’d call me mad.

And maybe I am.

The news crackles in the background—another crisis brewing, another conflict flaring, another tremor beneath the surface. I stare at the canvas I’ve kept covered, now uncovered again. Just to look. Just to know. And she stares back.

There’s something in her eyes now. I can finally see it. Not contempt, not sadness or anger.

Inevitability.
