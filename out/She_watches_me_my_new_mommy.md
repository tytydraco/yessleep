When I was little I was kidnapped, it wasn't just off the streets or in my front yard, but in a park. My mother had taken me and my siblings to the park, my older brothers were playing with their trucks in the sand box, my sister was hanging upside down on the monkey bars and my twin brother had made friends with some other kids there. I had ran out into the grass area, chasing and catching moths, following bees, and searching for worms. I had only checked in with my mom a few minutes after we had arrived as I needed her to tie my hair up, so I hadn't talked to her in about an hour. She was busy watching my cousin, she was fussy the entire walk and was crawling around, so my mom was following close behind prying wood chips out of her hands before she could eat them. Now I was old enough to be by myself, I didn't need to have a hawk eye on me, and plus I was 5 and knew not to wonder off.

I was chasing a butterfly towards the edge of the forest, and stopped right at the edge of the sidewalk. I watched the bug flutter in between the trees, farther then I knew I was aloud. I was about to turn and run back when I heard a soft voice from behind the tree. It was a women, with pale skin, almost pink in hue with her veins every so visible.

"Hi baby, won't you come to mommy so we can go home?"

Her voice rang out, like a cool breeze in the scorching hot of the summer air. She seemed so much like my mom, so warm and safe. I hesitated only for a minute, looking back at the play ground where my siblings and other kids were running around. I spotted my mother, pushing my cousin on the swings, while chatting with another mother pushing her own baby. I looked back at the women, who's gaze was warm and soft. I nodded before walking towards her, she stretched out a hand and I took it, it was bony and cold. Slicked with sweat and nails caked with dirt she lead me further into the woods before we reached a house. It was old and falling apart but still she called it home. I had no room to say otherwise as by this point I had followed whatever delusion she was under.

It was days I stayed there, it was quite and peaceful the forest was. Well, when the things left us alone. They were grotesque things, bony and elongated. Rotted and hostile, mimicking those who I'd held bear to my heart even now. The days were calm and warm, like most of late spring was, I spent my days with this strange women. Sitting infront of her half asleep while she brushed my hair, pulling through knotted curls until they would slide right through the brush and spring back up. She had these little dolls made of sticks, clay, and twine, ones that seemed to move on their own.

The nights were cold and dark, the sounds of the forest became almost terror inducing. I spent those dark hours curled against the thing that the women became when the moon finally raised. Her fragile and spindly body growing even longer, her hair going from a short slick of black, to ropes and ropes of grease and bugs, reminding me of a terrifying version of my favorite Disney princess. Her warm voice would turn rigid and shrill, yet her words we gargled like she was speaking through water. I didn't mind though, he arms wrapped around me too many times over kept me warm and safe from those things that pretended in the woods.

It was a week or so before I was found. The women had been spotted talking to another kid in the same park, and the cops had tracked her back to the cabin. It all ended in a full blown shoot out, I remember the feeling of her arms wrapped around me as the cops yelled at her to let me go and my mother cried and pleaded, my father holding her back, tears dripping down his face as well. I can still hear the shot that was fired, the sound of it tearing through the women's skull, sending chunks of her everywhere. I could still feel her warm grip loosen and fall slack against me before she fell over completely. The arms that had kept me warm and safe all those nights were gone, leaving me cold and afraid. I fell with her, hoping for the safety of her grasp once more, feeling exposed and unsafe. I reached for her arms, burying myself back into them. The cold metal of what felt like a charm touched my arm. I looked to find a bracelet I hadn't seen on her before, but a little charm of a doll lay dangling from it. A charm bracelet, all too big for her malnourished wrist slid easily off as I took it and held it tightly. The next few days were a blur. Police, and doctors, and investigators. All asking questions, poking at my body and my mind. I didn't say much, just that she had taken care of me in the ways she could. I was silent for a while after that.

It was months later the first time I saw her again. It was the first night I had been aloud to sleep in my own room by myself since the abduction. I had fallen asleep quickly, tires from the day of running about with my siblings in the backyard. I woke up in the middle of the night to a whisper.

"Babyâ€¦ is that you?"

My eyes opening quickly and scanned my room until I saw her. Tall and bent all out of shape, her face not visible. All shrouded in darkness, only her wide never blinking eyes would show. She stood in the corner of my room, blood dripping down, her jaw unhinged and hanging farther than should be possible. The horrific wight didn't scare me though, I felt almost safe as she sat in the corner, eyes drawn right to me.

"Don't worry baby, mommy's here, you're safe."

She never left my side. She was always just out of sight of everyone else, but I could always see her. I could feel her protective eyes, and I knew she was there when I would fall and scrap my knees, she was there to lessen the blow, her arms catching me as best as she could. She was there when I was in class, hiding in the shadows of the trees just outside the window, watching over me. She has always been there, ever since that day. Just sitting and watching me. Whisper to me when I'm alone, protecting me the best she can. She's my other mommy.

My mom sees her too sometimes, I can see it in her eyes. The fear went away after a few years, it was replaced by a sick sort of appreciation. I think she knows she just wants to keep me safe, and for that she's ever grateful.
