"Ok, do I have this thing working? Oh, ok. Uh, Hi. About a month ago, I was [driving a bus at night](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/Qkf32fIptr), and it was crashed by, something?" I said into the GoPro I bought a few weeks ago.

"I guess I'll say this, I'm too curious about whatever attacked my bus, and I wanna help that guy."
I said these things, trying to keep myself from going back on this.

"I just need to find this thing, or I'm not gonna forgive myself for what happened to that man."
I said these things, and replayed them with the GoPro software, and decided that I was gonna keep this promise.
I strapped the GoPro onto the bus mirror, and every few stops, I'd shift it's position slightly for a new angle. I bought a sort of security system that I hooked onto the side, next to and under the ticket generator, barely out of sight from passenger eyes. It played whatever the GoPro, and a separate camera at the back of the bus that came pre installed in the bus, and the company I drove for allowed it because of the accident.

"Hey man, can I get dropped off at 8-10?," a man asked, and while I was watching the camera's; it brought me back to reality.

"Oh, yeah just give me a minute to generate the ticket."

"Hey I noticed you got camera's, is that cause of the accident?"

I wasn't really being secretive about the accident, so I answered yes, then went back to monitoring the cameras. I was keeping track of a tall, lanky man, he was wearing minimal clothing, just a tee and a pair of cargo shorts.

"Uh, man?," the man said.
"Oh I'm sorry, I'm just paranoid." I wasn't, but it was an excuse.

I handed him his ticket, and he went back to a seat opposite the lanky man. The front camera couldn't see his face, only the side of his head.
But the back camera saw, something? I can't explain it it was like looking at a bank robber using stockings as a method of hiding their face, but thought the perspective of a camera, which it was.
He'd asked to be dropped off at stop 16-6, a stop that didn't exist. I kept driving, until I reached stop 8-10, where I dropped off the guy, who payed his fair and said goodbye, letting 2 guys on the bus.

"Aye can we get a stop at 15-7 please?," one said in a loud voice.

"You paying for your friend too?" I asked that while still looking at the cameras.

"Yeah man!," the guy said.
I generated their ticket, didn't get a comment on the security system. They took their tickets and went on their way. The lanky guy was looking a bit restless.

When I had reached stop 15-6, 2 more people had gotten on separate, and they wanted to get off at 15-7. While the tickets were generated, they greeted the other guy's that wanted to get off at 15-7. They attempted to greet the lanky guy, but he ignored them.

"Alright y'all, here's 15-7. Pay your fairs and get off my bus!," I said in a playful tone.
The guys laughed, and payed their tabs to go on their way.

"I recognize you."

"What?," I said. "I've never seen you before."

"The doors ripped off the bus when I rammed into it."

I feel like it's important to mention that, I carried black plastic bags, and they were big enough to cover the screen of the security cameras, which were still rolling. I covered the screen quickly, and grabbed the pepper spray that I always kept beside me, on the driver's side window.

"I crashed into a bus around a month ago, you were driving it. I don't know how or why but I remember that."

"What do you mean?," I asked.

"It's like when I scurried off with that man, I secured my spot in humanity!"
I hadn't looked back at this point, and I'd pasted 15-9 and 15-10. I picked at the bag covering the cameras, and noticed that the lanky "man" was, surprisingly, a bit taller, and his face, which before wouldn't even register on the camera, was detailed, his teeth grew and sharpened to a point. He had made his way about halfway through the bus, and began on all fours.

"I don't know why this is, But I know it to be fact!"

I had gotten to stop 16-3, at which point I noticed someone who wanted to get on. I don't know why, but I instinctually drove in, and picked them up. The lanky man suddenly sat down, quickly shoving his head into his lap, possibly in an attempt to hide his face, teeth, and just disguise his lanky form with an attempt to look drowsy or sleepy.

"Hey man, can I get dropped at stop 16-5?"

I quickly generated the ticket, took it out of the machine, and wrote a message on the small ticket. It read "Turn on your camera and keep it on the other guy" it surprisingly fit on the ticket, and as I was handing it to the man, I mouthed the words "read it."
When he got to his seat, he read it, and to my surprise he did what the message said, and pointed his camera at the lanky "guy." 
Around 5 minutes later, I played a fake phone ringing noise on my phone, and picked up the buses phone, stopping it when I picked it up.

"Yeah boss?... ...yeah I can head back... ...m'k, see you soon."
I dropped down the phone, and said aloud, "Sorry guys, I gotta head back to the bus landing, repairs on the bus."

The lanky "man" begun to shake, and the guy sitting across from him started up and towards the drivers seat.
"Hey man, this guy is weird, are you oka-" he was suddenly cut off by a lanky hand covering his mouth, with the other digging into his neck, blood trickling down his shirt.
I immediately slammed the brakes, which slammed the monster and the poor guy through the window. The monster looked around and started staring at the sidewalk, which prompted me to look at it as well.
"16-6" the sign above the stop read.

"Looks like they do exist, eh?" The monster said this, and then scurried off, with that poor guy In tow. He must have died shortly after he was thrown though the window, from where that things fingers pierced, I'd say he hit an artery or something.

I had no intention of staying there, I made a quick U-turn, and stepped on the gas until I was at stop 9-10, and it was dawn by the time I was there. I was nearly unconscious, and people who were waiting at stops to be picked up for early work saw my bus, saw the shattered windows and blood soaked floorboards.

The GoPro that was stuck onto the mirror was hanging on by a thread, literally.
I finally had proof of the attacks, even 2 different angles of it. The company I drove for shortly updated policy not to allow rides for particularly tall, pale, and lanky individuals.

"I intend to go beyond 16-6, or at least when I get some rest. I guess I need to call them something. Inhumans will do for now." The footage of a new GoPro cried out on repeat...
