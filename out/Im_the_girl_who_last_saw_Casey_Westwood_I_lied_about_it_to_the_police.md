Casey lived one street over from me. She was a tall and strong and always excited for our next adventure together. We'd been friends since first grade, and we mostly either ran around outside or chilled in her living room. But today, some of her neighbor's kids had coaxed her out to play with them, and I ended up doing so too. They were younger than us and pretty rowdy and energetic. I was a little pissy because it was a hot day and I wanted to play games on her mom's iPad.

And of course, like any gaggle of weird children living in the bad part of a large city, there was one place in particular we wanted explore - the old abandoned meth house down the street. Granted, we were too young to figure out it was a drug house, we just knew it was abandoned and therefore it had to be haunted or something. Every abandoned house is haunted, that's just how it is.

I was always a pretty rational kid, I think. I tried to find explanations for all the weird shit I saw, and usually realized it was something like the wind or the angle of the floor, nothing spooky or strange. But I had learned that pointing things out to other kids typically made them mad at me, so instead I usually played along. It's not like playing Ghost Hunters wasn't fun, I just wasn't feeling it that day. Wanted to be in and out quickly so we could do something actually fun.

Anyway. We go into this house through the back door, which I guess some of the homeless people who squatted there must have left unlocked. There was a screen and thin a heavy wooden door that drifted closed if you didn't hold it, so me and my friend went out in the grass and found a nice and heavy rock to prop against it. We liked leaving a quick escape open in case any adults noticed us through the windows.

The house was small, just like every house in our neighborhood. The back door lead into the kitchen, which was only separated from the living room by the change from tile to carpet. There was trash thrown about, a box of cheerios scattered across the floor. About what you'd expect. Down the hallway there were I think two bedrooms, a bathroom, and a little closet where the water heater was kept. The door to that was smaller and raised up off the ground, I guess to discourage little kids from climbing in there.

That door was hanging open as we explored the rooms a bit. Nothing of interest was here, and I was easily bored, so I started to lead everyone back outside, until my friend stopped and pointed to the heater door. "Look, it's moving!" And when I looked, it was very slowly creaking closed. I knew there was a room with a window open directly across from it, so I brought that up. In response, my friend called out, "Open the door!"

And it creaked, slowly and steadily, back open again.

Of course, my friend and her neighbors all went ballistic, convinced they were now communicating with a ghost via a creaky old door. I stood at the end of the hall while they all rushed over to check around it, looking for anything out of the ordinary. It was determined that opening the door further meant 'yes' and closing it meant 'no', and from there questions were asked. I don't remember what was asked, I just remember the answers being weirdly intelligent. A little too intelligent for me to remain comfortable writing it off as the wind.

It just... answered things. It gradually got quicker with its responses. From basic math questions to question about this hypothetical ghost's life, it seemed to answer in earnest. Like it was a real person. Nobody was close enough to touch the door, nobody was tampering with it. They all just stood, fascinated by the door that seemed to be talking to them.

If it was hot outside, it was even hotter in the house. I was already in a bad mood and I wanted to go back to my friend's house. Even if we couldn't go inside, we could sit under her trampoline and cool off for a bit. Maybe her mom would even let us turn on the hose and fill up the inflatable pool. 

I was whining, insisting we head back. I whined that it was too hot, that I was thirsty and wanted water, that I was hungry and wanted to ask her mom if I was staying for dinner or if I had to go home. She wasn't even getting annoyed with me, just repeatedly shooting down my complaints as she wanted to know more, to learn about whatever she was speaking to. I opened my mouth to complain again, louder this time, but I was cut off by a loud slamming sound, so hard I felt the ground under my shoes shaking with the force of it. I whipped my head around just in time to see the rock skidding across the tile and catching on the carpet, rolling twice before coming to a stop.

The back door had been slammed shut. Like someone had come home angry and wanted to make it known. With the strength of a grown adult, not of any of us frightened children. And I saw nothing there. No homeless person here to hurt us, no angry demonic figure with a threatening glare. The space by the door was completely empty. I thought maybe someone was hiding outside to trick us, but through the window near the door I again saw nothing. Not even a rustling of the grass.

The younger kids started screaming and I ran over to the door, pulling it back open and breathing a sigh of relief. I had been half-expecting it to be locked, like in the horror movies. The younger ones ran out, then my friend, dragging me behind her. We ran as fast as we could around the corner of the house, through the side gate, and down the street towards my friend's house. The neighbor kids split from us to run home, and we ran inside, hurrying to her bedroom and closing the door, drawing the curtains just to be safe.

We talked a bit about what had happened. I don't remember exactly what was said, but I do remember the excited gleam in her eye as she spoke. She asked me what I saw, since she was further down the hall and couldn't see the back door. I told her I saw the rock moving, but nothing else. I guess in her child mind, she had asserted the ghost was actually a demon, and one that needed exorcising. So she grabbed her children's Bible and held it over her head triumphantly as she declared we were going back to get rid of it.

I was wholly against it. That shit was *real* and it was *scary.* I didn't want to go back, I wanted to leave it alone forever so it would have no reason to hurt me. I suggested telling her mother and she shot down the idea like I was a moron. We both knew if we told any adults, they wouldn't believe us and we'd probably get in trouble for going in there in the first place. I couldn't argue with that. The adults in our lives always wrote off whatever we said as kids having fun, regardless of it being something real that had frightened us or an actual game of pretend.

Still, I wasn't going back, and I made that clear. She could complain all she wanted but I wasn't going to listen to her. If she really wanted to go, she could go alone. So she puffed out her chest, shouted "Fine!" and I watched her march out of her bedroom and out the front door. I was upset with her, both for writing me off earlier in the house and for demanding we go back. So I went home, just around the corner in the other direction. 

The next day, my mom got a phone call while I was watching TV on the couch. After she hung up, I remember her coming over to me and just knowing something was wrong. Her movements were too slow, too gentle. I tried to think of anything I had done wrong recently. My friend wouldn't have snitched on me, even if she'd been caught, but those other kids might. Maybe they said something?

"Honey, you went to play with Casey yesterday, right?" My mom asked. My stomach sank and I looked down at my lap shamefully. I was definitely caught. This is why I hated playing with younger kids when doing bad stuff. They always told on you eventually.

"Did she say anything to you? Did she plan on running away or anything?" She questioned further without me saying anything, and I went from ashamed to confused. "No. Why?" 

"Did you see her going with anyone? Maybe a stranger or one of her neighbors?" Ignoring my question, my mom leaned forward, her expression starting to look more and more worried. I shook my head. "Why? What's wrong with her?"

My mom went on to explain, as gently as possible, that my friend never came home last night and her mama was scared, so if I knew anything at all, I had to tell. I remember the war I waged in my mind right then, my worry for my friend's safety being weighed against the unspoken rule of 'no snitching' among kids. I don't remember exactly what I said, but it wasn't the whole truth. I didn't mention ever going in there with her, saying I waited outside until everyone came running out. I told my mom that Casey said it was filled with demons and she wanted to play exorcist, but I came home because I was tired. I told her I saw Casey going that way though, when I left.

I don't think my mom fully believed me, even as she relayed back what I said to my friend's mother. She would ask if I was sure or if I had forgotten something at least six more times that day. Even as I parroted the story to a police officer, she asked if that was all, or if I wanted to add something other detail that might help. I declined every time.

The parents of the neighbor kids were always a bit sketchy. I wasn't technically supposed to play with them, but my mom gave me a pass since I was playing with my friend and those kids just happened to be there. But the sketchiness helped me out, because the parents wouldn't let the police question their kids. I was the only witness who said they were there with my friend and I, so I guess they couldn't get what they needed to make the parents stand down. I didn't really care about the specifics, anyway. My two main concerns were not getting in trouble and finding my friend.

I had already been put to bed, with a story read to me and a kiss on my forehead, when they found her. Nobody would tell me back then, but it was talked about on the news and I managed to dig up some of the clips on YouTube. She was found in the crawlspace, face down in the mud. She was messed up pretty bad, they said. Broken bones, covered in bruises. Police report said she was beaten to death.

And the worst part about it? I saw girls on there making videos about Casey, showing pictures of her smiling and laughing as they theorized about whether it was her father or the sketchy man next door. They brought up what I said too, wondering if I was truthful or if I'd been scared into silence by someone. There were a couple theories about whether I'd done it, too. I guess staying off social media was a good choice on my end, because there was an entire section of one girl's video was dedicated to attempts at reaching me specifically. There were some fake accounts who gave fake answers, but they'd all been proven to be fake, thankfully.

So here I am. Giving you all the real deal. At the end here, I do have a message to the masses. First off, fuck the true crime community and fuck everyone who's treated my best friend's death like some kind of spectacle. I talked to Casey's mom for the first time in a while, and apparently the harassment you guys have put her through has been a motherfucking nightmare. Blaming her dad for killing her up until the day he died, and claiming her mom covered it up to protect him. You're all fucking disgusting and I hope you die as horribly as she did, alone and cold and terrified, so then you can spend your afterlives apologizing to her. She would have hated you, too.

Second, I can't tell you for sure what happened to her. Like I said, I didn't go back. I didn't ride my bike down that street for the rest of my childhood. It could've been some demonic force or it could've been a homeless person on some kind of drugs that did it. I don't know. The only thing I can say is that nobody seems to have noticed her children's Bible. Either that or nobody seems to have mentioned it. Did anyone ever find it? Is it somewhere under that crawlspace still?

And lastly, I didn't do it. Her dad didn't do it and I doubt the sketchy one did it either. Her dad loved her and he treated her well. He would've taken a bullet for his daughter. And that sketchy dude was skin and bones, pale as paper. He never left the house and looked like he couldn't lift a dictionary, let alone do that much damage to someone. Casey was tough, too. She would've gone down fighting, and I feel like if she was fighting against him she would've won, so long as he didn't have help.

You have my side of the story - the real one this time, not the half-truths I told as a child and not the fake shit whoever's pretending to be me fed you. Is this what you wanted? It doesn't give you or me or her mother any answers. We'll never really know what happened to Casey Westwood and that's just something you've got to accept. I did, her parents did, the whole neighborhood did, so why can't you just let her rest? Give her name some fucking peace. God knows she deserves it after all this time.
