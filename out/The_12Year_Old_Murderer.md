I have been working as a Therapist for about 6-7 years. I usually treat elders but sometimes I do get children and teens. On May 1st I would be having a family dinner for my nephew's birthday, I had planned to leave early after I had seen Martha that day she sat with me and told me how her weekend was since I see her every week on Thursdays only. After I had seen her I went ahead and left. While driving I had a call from one of the girls working up front they said someone had brought in a girl who was 12 and was dealing with Depression and schizophrenia. I had said to let her go with the other Therapists there she had said "no she requested you only you". I said okay and quickly drove back to the office which when I came in I greeted the girl and said to follow me into my room. While we were walking in I could get a glance to see her mom's face she was looking at me as if she had guilt in bringing her or regretted seeing me.

After that I went ahead and told her to tell me how she was feeling at home, her voice sounded like a creepy doll but I didn't mind she calmly said "fine..?" It sounded like a question to me but I didn't care I just wanted this session to be done. She didn't really like to talk as I could tell I said "have you been doing something you'd like to share?" I knew she had to tell me something by her face but was probably too uncomfortable  "I did something horrible.. something cruel.." she had said I said "do you want to talk about it?" "I-I murdered my friend a week ago..outside at the park at night" I quickly stopped writing down things on my paper "um I-I is this true like did this actually happen?" She nodded I quickly put my things down and escorted her out and called the cops and stated her name and age and where she lived. The cops came and took her into the cop car with hand cuffs and told me they had been looking for her since Wednesday. Still to this day I get goosebumps thinking about this everyday I go into work but me and the ladies who worked there as long as me don't speak too much about it. Still to this day I get mad because I missed my nephew's 8th birthday just to meet face to face with a killer. I tell my nephew that I missed his birthday because I had to pick out his gift because I'm overall scared to tell him. But I've been having dreams of the same girl even though this incident happened 2 years ago I still remember her and I keep having multiple dreams of her killing me and saying it's my fault and that I ruined her life..
