I always wanted to live on a bit of land. Trees are beautiful, and being surrounded by them always made me calm. Now, I understand how sinister they can be. What they can hide in their shadows. 

I was so excited about this new place, tucked in the woods a few miles out of a decently sized town. It was the Northwest US, so it was rainy a lot, but that suited me perfectly. I had just got my first successful novel off the ground, so most of my days were spent in my office; the rain on the window and the trees swaying just beyond the yard always lulling me into a flow. It took far too long for me to notice how ominous the impenetrable foliage was. Sure, there were the occasional odd noises. Animal calls that sounded unnatural, perhaps a bit too high pitched. A bit too similar to human laughter. To human screams. I went out there a few times, just to make sure I didn’t have any dangerous animals lurking about the property. I found some strange things. Tracks that looked more like gouges than prints. Eviscerated animal carcasses. Looking back, I should have realized that far too much meat had been left behind. That too many bones had been splintered. 

I am by no means a tracker. I enjoy camping and hiking, but I really didn’t know what I was looking for in those woods. I assumed it was a mountain lion. I knew they made some distressing sounds, and chalked up the dead animals to its prey. We didn’t have any pets, and our kids were just old enough to understand how dangerous walking in the woods was with a wild animal on the loose. They never seemed to like going in there anyway. I suppose I’m grateful for that, but I wish I had recognized their hesitation as the sign that it was. Hell, even I avoided the place. It was beautiful, sure, but so quiet. Aside from the occasional concerning yelps that emanated from within. Still, it never seemed like a truly sinister place to me. Of course so much untamed forest would be home to some wild animals. That was almost part of the appeal for me. I had grown up in Texas, so I already had a few guns locked up in a safe, and sometimes, after I heard a shriek that sounded a bit too close to the house, I took one out and went for a look around. I never came across a thing, so I made a mental note to talk to warden. It’s a shame I never got around to it. Maybe things would have been different. Eventually, the off-putting nature of the forest just blended into the backdrop. The kids still played in the yard. I still stared blankly at the woods from my office window. Everything seemed completely fine, just as long as we kept our distance. 

It took one night for my perception to change. The wife and I left our kids with a sitter for a date in town. We made sure the house was stocked with everything they would need, so nobody would need to leave the property. What a blissful evening. The last one before the constant dread. 

When we pulled back up to our house, I caught a glimpse of it. The gaunt, animalistic figure in the tree line. I didn’t get a good look at first, but what stuck out was its pallid flesh, and its small, round head. Almost like a human’s. It recoiled from my headlights, and disappeared into the trees. My wife inhaled sharply and grabbed my arm. It had only been visible for a few seconds, but that was enough. Enough to let us know that it was no ordinary animal. I pulled into the garage, and got out of the car. Before I shut the garage door and went inside, I stepped out onto the driveway. I wanted to see if the creature was still hanging about. I gazed intently at where it had loped back into the trees, but I couldn’t make out anything. I did hear rustling, though. Like something heavy was prowling just beyond my vision. Then there was a piercing cackle, much closer than I had ever heard before. I immediately turned and ran back into the garage, hitting the automatic closer button as I did. I then stood in the doorway of my home, and watched as the agonizingly slow garage door rolled its way down. A few feet before it touched the ground, I saw four limbs appear in the shrinking crack. The front two seemed thick, and splayed far out in front of whatever they were attached to, while the back two were smaller and folded back on themselves, giving a disproportionate look that did not seem like something found in nature. Once the paneled door shut fully, I hesitated for moment. After a brief silence, I heard a resonant tap on the garage door, and saw it shake as if struck. 

I hurried inside and locked the door behind me. I found the sitter on the couch, staring at me with thinly veiled concern. 

“Are you alright?” She asked. My face must had been somewhat alarming. I don’t think I was hiding my anxiety well. 

“Where is my wife?” I inquired in return.

“She went to check on the kids. I promise I got them into bed at a reasonable time.” 

I nodded and tried to calm down. I put on what must have been an unconvincing smile, and asked, “did you hear anything strange while we were gone?”

I remember the deepening of her concerned expression when I asked this question. She was only able to give a small nod, before our conversation was cut off by a shriek coming from the front yard. I froze, staring into the sitters eyes. The look on her face had evolved into blatant fear. Within moments, my wife appeared from a hallway that led deeper into the house, our one year old son still sleeping in her arms. Our three year old daughter was trailing behind her, rubbing sleep from her eyes. 

“What was that sound, Daddy?” She asked me, child-like fear present in her voice. 

“Nothing, honey” I tried to assure her, but my words of placation were undercut by a slamming at our front door. The sound the creature emitted when it hit the sturdy oak was far lower and more guttural in nature than its previous shrieks. My daughter screamed, and without hesitation, I scooped her up and charged down the hallway. We came to our storage room, and I ushered my family and the sitter inside. It was in the center if the house, with no windows, canned food, bottled water, and, most importantly, my gun safe. I switched on the light and fumbled with the safe code. Once I got it open, I loaded a 12 gauge shotgun with a few shells, and stared at the door. 

My daughter started to cry, and I calmed her with quiet words and her favorite lullabies. Once she had subsided into whimpers, I pulled out my cell phone and dialed 911. The dispatcher had barely answered before I frantically explained the situation. 

“Clam down, sir. Where are you? We need your location.”

I remember the silence that followed after I recited my address. The single shaky breath the dispatcher took, before ending the call with a *click.* I tried to call back multiple times, but none went through. My best hope at that point was to believe that officers were on their way. I now know that I had moved to a cursed place. That local law enforcement knew to stay away. Bastards could have let me in on it before I brought my family there. 

We waited in that storage room for hours. Eventually, the sitter’s mother called her, chastising her for staying out so late. She was a high school student, the daughter of my wife’s friend. She cried when she tried to explain her situation, but I suppose her mom wasn’t privy to the same knowledge as the police, and merely got angrier at her daughter’s “ridiculous excuse to stay out late.” She threatened to come pick her up, and give us a lecture about her daughter’s time, which our poor sitter pleaded against. Unfortunately, this only seemed to reinforce the stubborn mother’s belief that her teenage daughter was breaking the rules, and ended the call saying she was coming to pick her up. Our sitter tried to call back a few times, sent a dozen text messages, then just held her head and cried as more muffled shrieks and growls began to reach our ears. It wasn’t long until a very drawn out, very human scream accompanied them.

“Mom!” The sitter shouted, jumping to her feet. She ran to the door, and grabbed the knob with a shaking hand. She waited, fear wrought into her frame. I stood behind her, torn on what to do. Then, a second scream, more gurgled and desperate than the last, sent the sitter flying out of the room. I followed after her, shotgun at the ready. 

“Lock this door and don’t open it again until you hear my voice,” I called to my wife, who barely had time to protest before I was out the door. Once we reached the living room, the screams had become louder, and were mixed in with the sounds of tearing flesh. The sitter was standing by the front door, which was thankfully still in place, listening with a horrified expression. It sounded as if her mother was being torn apart mere feet away from where we were. The sitter gripped the door handle, unable to bring herself to open it. I quietly pulled her away, and peeked out of an adjacent window. 

The creature was brutalizing what was now a human corpse. In the short time since the first scream, the sitter’s mom had been reduced to a mangled, bloody mess. The horrible monstrosity didn’t even seem to be consuming the meat, just throwing it around in some sort of perverse revelry. I watched it tear the limbs off the woman, and wave them around with vigor, slamming them into the pavement until they were nothing but bloody stumps. I saw it smash her head like an overripe melon with one stomp of its massive fore-limb. The look on its face… I will never forget. It was much too close to human. Except the features were… distorted. Too big eyes that were almost all pupil. A too wide mouth, grinning with jagged teeth at the horrific scene it was creating. No nose or ears, only slits in its pale, hairless head. It’s entire body was hairless. Only tight flesh stretched over prominent bones. It looked like a skeleton covered in fetid canvas. Its limbs were too long, and angled backwards, as if in perverse mockery of all things natural. 

I retched and stumbled away. The thought of opening the door and firing at it did not even enter my mind. At that moment, only primal fear and revulsion consumed me. I turned to the sitter and shook my head, fighting the urge to vomit. I gestured to her to return to the storage room, but she merely stared back with tears in her eyes. So lost were we in our distress, that we did not immediately notice that silence replaced the wet crunching that had filled the air moments before. It wasn’t until a delicate scraping began on the scrubbed oak of the front door that we snapped back to our senses. 

We were both frozen in fear. I was unable to run back to my family, despite my desperate desire to. The slow sound rooted me to the spot, and I wasn’t freed until the scraping stopped, and was followed by a crash on the roof. The creature moved quickly then, skittering across the shingles to the large windows of my study upstairs. It was so fast, that neither the sitter, nor I, could react until we heard shattering glass, followed by heavy footfalls quickly making their way to the stairs. It was in the house. 

“GO!” I screamed, before pelting toward the storeroom. I wish I could say that I dragged the sitter along. That I covered her while she ran ahead. But I cowardly ran to the only place that held any semblance of sanctuary. When I reached the door, I looked back to see the sitter a ways behind me. The poor girl must not have started running as quickly as I had. She gave me a terrified look as the creature swiped her legs out from under her, sending her to the floor. I got a full view as the creature, face lit up with glee, grabbed the top of the sitter’s cranium with a disfigured hand, and pulled backward, ripping off the top of the girl’s head, leaving only her lower jaw behind. The image of her tongue lolling out of the gaping maw, the blood spurting out and painting the walls, is one I will never forget. But I am even more haunted by the sound that her body continued to make. It was only about a second, but a gurgled scream still emanated from the halfway-decapitated body’s throat. I still vividly remember the creature lifting its gaze to me, boring its black eyes into my soul, and raising the top part of the sitter’s head at stare at me as well. Her eyes were still flitting around in their sockets as blood poured from her torn flesh. 

I screamed in terror. The monstrosity cackled. The sitter’s eyes glazed and went still. There was a moment of sickening silence, then my wonderful, brave wife yanked the door open and pulled me inside the storage room. She locked it behind me, and I collapsed to the ground. Call me a coward, but all I could do was cradle the shotgun that I should have fired at the beast. Truly, every other thought was driven from my mind when I fell into its cold, black eyes. It wasn’t until I saw the terrified face of my daughter that I began to regain composure. My family was in here. The one thing I truly valued above myself. I shakily stood, and aimed the gun directly at the door. It wasn’t the thick oak of the front entrance, and after witnessing what the creature could do, I had no doubt it could smash through it with ease. Yet, it never did. It snarled, and cackled, and made grotesque sounds right outside the door. It scratched at the wood separating us, it cracked the sitter’s bones, and tore her flesh aggressively, but never truly attempted to enter the storeroom. After a few of the longest hours of my life, I heard the heavy footfalls of its retreat. 

My son had woken up for a portion of the horrible noises, and he joined the rest of us in our silent crying. We stayed in that room for a few days, eating the canned rations and drinking bottled water until the smell of rotting flesh became unbearable. I had tried a few more times to get in contact with the authorities, but I was consistently met with fear and inaction. When we finally emerged from the storeroom, my family was met with a nightmare scene. What was once our babysitter was smeared onto every surface of the hallway. Teeth clung to a chunks of palate stuck to the ceiling. Bone fragments littered the hallway amidst shredded organs, along with what seemed like gallons of congealed blood. Unidentifiable mounds of meat were smashed into the carpet, walls, ceiling, and every crevice between the storage room and the living room. 

Both of my children were violently ill. So was my wife. I was in a state of complete shock. I numbly ushered my family through the horrid hallway, out the front door, past the rotten pile of meat that was once the sitter’s mother, and into our car. The entire time I had a white knuckled grip on the shotgun. I started the car and drove to the edge of our property. Just before I got to the end of our long driveway, the horrible creature emerged from the dark forest that encroached from either side of us. It stood in its distorted, stooped manner, blocking me from the road that would lead us into town. It stared with a delighted malice, and I knew in that moment, that it reveled in our fear. It terrorized us for pure pleasure. My children started to cry. My wife whimpered. I went numb and prepared for the worst. But after a final, bone-chilling cackle, it moved along. 

I never returned to that house. Everything I ever owned was there, but it isn’t worth it. I didn’t put it up for sale. I would never run the risk of putting another person there. Maybe when the bank forecloses it, and sells all my belongings, some poor fool will snatch it up. I went in-person to the local police station and told them what happened. They stared solemnly at me, and simply nodded. I was not given a witness report to fill out. Only the advice, “leave, and never return.” I followed that advice. I don’t know what to make of any of this, but I have learned something. Never live in a forest.
