The Carter family had long dreamed of owning their own home. Tom and Lisa had saved diligently to buy a cozy cottage away from the hustle and bustle of the city. They moved in with their three children: 15-year-old Kate, 10-year-old Jake, and little Toby, who had just turned 3. The house they chose was spacious, with a large garden and a fireplace in the living room. The only strange feature was an antique mirror fixed to the wall in Toby's room. It was massive, with a dark, ornate frame, and none of the Carters dared to remove it.

From the very first day in the house, strange things began to happen. Toby, usually cheerful and energetic, became withdrawn and silent. He could sit for hours in front of the mirror, whispering something under his breath. Lisa noticed how he would trace his hand across the surface of the glass, as if conversing with someone unseen.

One night, when the whole family was asleep, Lisa heard Toby quietly talking. She cautiously approached his room and gently opened the door. In the dim light of the nightlight, she saw Toby standing in front of the mirror, his reflection seeming distorted. The boy was whispering something, but Lisa couldn’t make out the words.

"Toby, who are you talking to?" Lisa asked softly, trying not to startle her son.

The boy slowly turned toward his mother. His eyes were empty, lacking their usual childish spark.

"A friend," Toby said, his voice unnaturally low.

"What friend?" Lisa struggled to suppress her growing fear.

Toby raised his hand and pointed to the mirror.

"He lives there," said Toby, "and he really wants to play with you, Mommy."

These words sent a shiver down Lisa’s spine. She quickly scooped Toby into her arms and left the room, firmly closing the door behind her. She tried to convince herself that it was just a child’s imagination, but deep down, she knew something was wrong.

The next day, Lisa told Tom about what had happened. He listened, but was skeptical.

"Lisa, you're just tired. It’s an old house, and kids often make up imaginary friends," Tom reassured her, though there was a note of uncertainty in his voice.

But Lisa couldn’t shake her unease. Soon Jake began noticing strange behavior in Toby as well. His little brother started avoiding daylight, spending hours in the dark, mumbling to himself. One evening, Jake overheard Toby talking to someone, but there was no one else in the room.

"Are you talking to your friend again?" Jake asked, approaching him.

Toby turned abruptly toward his brother. His eyes were eerily dark.

"He's not your friend, Jake," Toby said. "He's mine."

These words frightened Jake. He told Kate, and they decided to keep a close eye on their younger brother. But every night when they tried to spy on him, Toby was standing in front of the mirror, muttering. The reflection in the mirror always seemed distorted, as if it had a life of its own.

One night, Kate was awakened by a strange sound. She listened carefully and realized it was Toby’s voice, coming from his brother's room. But there was something alien, sinister in his voice. Kate woke Jake, and they went to Toby’s room together.

When they entered, they saw Toby standing in front of the mirror, his reflection seemingly moving independently, dark and distorted. A chill ran down Kate’s spine.

"Toby, what are you doing?" Kate asked quietly, trying not to show her fear.

The boy didn’t answer, but his reflection in the mirror smiled at them with a creepy, unnatural grin.

"He's here," Toby whispered. "He’ll come for you soon."

Kate and Jake ran out of the room in terror, locking the door behind them. They woke their parents and told them what they had seen. Tom finally realized that something serious was happening. Together, they decided it was time to do something about the mirror.

The next morning, Tom removed the mirror from the wall and took it outside. He wanted to get rid of it, but when he tried to smash it with a hammer, the glass remained intact. The blows rang out with a dull thud, but the mirror refused to break.

"This isn’t normal," Tom muttered when all their attempts to destroy the mirror failed.

They decided to leave it in the basement, hoping that would stop the strange events. But from that day on, Toby’s behavior became even more disturbing. He spoke and ate less and less, and at night, he continued to whisper, no longer in front of the mirror, but staring at a single spot on the wall, as if communicating with an invisible presence.

Finally, Lisa called a priest to bless the house. The priest, an elderly man with kind eyes, sensed that something evil resided in this house. He walked through the rooms, saying prayers, but when he entered Toby's room, he stopped.

"There’s something here," he said quietly, his gaze lingering on the wall where the mirror used to hang. "This isn’t just a mirror, it’s a gateway."

Lisa paled.

"A gateway? To where?" she asked, her voice trembling.

"To somewhere evil," the priest replied. "I can feel its presence. It wants to break free."

At that moment, Toby, who had been standing silently in the corner, suddenly began to laugh. But it wasn’t his laugh—a deep, eerie sound, full of malice.

"You can’t stop him," Toby said in a voice that didn’t belong to a child. "He’s already here."

Everyone froze, unsure of what to do. Suddenly, the door to the room slammed shut with a loud bang, as if by itself. The room plunged into darkness, and the walls began to whisper. Toby’s laughter grew louder and more terrifying.

The priest began to recite prayers, but Toby stepped up to him and grabbed his hand with a strength that couldn’t have come from a small child. The priest tried to pull away but couldn’t. A wicked spark flashed in Toby’s eyes.

"He wants to take him," Toby whispered, looking at Lisa. "He wants your soul, Mommy."

Lisa screamed and rushed to her son, trying to pull him away from the priest. But suddenly, Toby released his grip, his eyes closed, and he collapsed to the floor, as if drained.

The priest was breathing heavily; he crossed himself and said:

"I couldn’t cast it out. This evil is too strong. You need to leave."

Despite their shock, Lisa, Tom, and the children quickly packed up and left the house that very night. They moved into a hotel, deciding never to return to that cursed house. But as soon as they left, Toby seemed to begin recovering. He became the cheerful boy he had been before the move.

However, a few weeks later, when they finally found a new home in another city, Lisa noticed Toby whispering to himself again. When she asked him who he was talking to, Toby looked up, his eyes full of fear.

"He’s still here," the boy whispered, pointing to his reflection in the window. "He came with me."

Lisa froze, her heart pounding in her chest. In the reflection of the window, she saw a dark figure standing behind Toby, distorted and unnatural, as if from another world. The figure leaned down to the boy and whispered:

"Now we’ll be together forever."

At that moment, Lisa realized that the evil that had inhabited their house had never left. It had followed them.
