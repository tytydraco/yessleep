It was one of those super cold winter nights where the cold seeped through the walls no matter how high you turned up the heat. Outside, the wind howled, battering the windows and scattering brittle, dead leaves across the yard. The air inside the house was still, almost too still, and despite the extra layers I wore, I couldn't shake the chill. My parents were off somewhere tropical, enjoying warm beaches and cocktails, and my sister was out doing something or other. That left me alone. Or so I thought.

I was sitting on my bed, bundled in a fleece blanket, scrolling through my phone. The screen's dim glow was the only light in the room, casting faint shadows on the walls. I had been trying to ignore the uneasy feeling creeping over me all night, chalking it up to the loneliness that always came when the house was this quiet. But then it happened.

The room felt colder, and a weird, suffocating stillness settled over me. It wasn't just the usual quiet you'd expect in an empty house—it was something else. It was unnatural.

That's when I noticed it.

In the corner of my room, standing just at the edge of the shadows, was something. It was a figure. Its back was turned to me, but even in the dim light, I could see enough to know it wasn't human. It was tall, impossibly tall, with long, spindly limbs that hung too low. Its shoulders were slightly hunched, as if the weight of its grotesque frame was too much to bear. Its head was tilted down at an odd angle, and even though it didn't move, its presence was enough to make my skin crawl.

I froze, and my phone slipped from my hands and landed on the mattress with a muffled thud. My breath caught in my throat, and for a moment, I thought I was imagining it. Maybe it was just a shadow from something outside. Maybe the wind rattling the windows was messing with my head. But as I stared, I realized it wasn't a trick of the light.

The figure didn't move a muscle. It was totally still, but its presence filled the room and pressed down on me like a heavy weight. My mind was telling me to look away, to hide under the covers like a kid, but I couldn't.

And then it spoke.

"Brian..."

It was my mom's voice. It was soft, warm, and familiar—just like I'd heard it a thousand times before. My heart skipped a beat. She wasn't here. She couldn't be here. But the voice was so precise, so perfect, that for one awful moment, I wanted to believe it was her.

"Brian, come here."

This time, it was my sister's voice. Her tone was sharp and impatient, like she was scolding me for something. But there was something off about it. The words felt hollow, like they didn't have the emotion to make them feel real.

I was totally frozen, every muscle in my body stiff, as the figure didn't move a muscle. Then it started making other sounds. It even copied my dad's deep laugh. The creak of the old front door. Even the soft chime of the grandfather clock downstairs. Each sound was eerily accurate, but felt wrong, like someone had recorded them and played them back with a slight distortion.

The figure didn't move a muscle for what felt like forever, its back to me. 

Then, slowly, it started to turn.
