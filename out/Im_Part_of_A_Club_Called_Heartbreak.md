I’m part of a club called heartbreak - we meet on Tuesdays in an abandoned 1950s diner. The lights are off, the bathrooms don’t work, and the grill is broken. The only light we have is the sunshine. It dances around, making dust motes look like stars. But it’s home. A waitress, frozen in time, serves us black coffee. She’s had her own heartbreak, and she’s forever suspended in the past. We sit around in the diner, smelling phantom pie and ice cream floats, talking about the scalpels people like you took to our heart. What we are now is pieces - chunks of human beings. Maybe that’s all we’ve ever been to people like you. Have I ever been whole, and real, in your eyes? For fuck’s sake, have I ever even *been* whole? Not that I can remember. We are the frozen hotdog chunks stowed away in the freezer left from some abandoned culinary endeavor undertaken by a store clerk (“give up your dreams and just flip the damn burgers”). If I squint, I can see the diner for everything it used to be, instead of what it is now. It’s an eerie spectacle. I see this in tandem with visions of the person I used to be before I became your sacrificial lamb. I see it in tandem with the version of you I created in my head, the one I had in my heart when I first met you. A part of me died when that kind, good-hearted version of you died. Or, I guess it never truly lived. It is undead, sucking the life out of me. It is a vampire. 

I’m the loudest at this club called heartbreak. I have no right to be - everyone here has been through so much. The thing we all have in common is that the grooves in our hearts run so deep we cannot patch them up or let them go. Some were put here by friends. Some by family. Some by boyfriends or girlfriends or other romantic entanglements. Everyone has a story. But I’m dramatic, and I’m crass, and I’m willing to speak. So they let me. I talk and talk and scream until my lungs are sore and all the tears are gone from my eyes. I slur your name until the early hours of the morning. I pretend I’m screaming into your black void, and I will receive no response. I know that. I keep doing it. 

I’m at home in this club called heartbreak, where we sit around in booths far too small for comfort and taste the ghost of strawberry milkshakes past which are far too sweet for our liking. Country music blares on a muffled radio - no one can figure out where it’s located. When the diner closed, no one ever thought to tell the waitress how to turn it off (she insists we just call her our waitress - no names). Waylon sings about the pain of his own life (the song may as well be called "Mamas Don’t Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Country Music Musicians”), Willie sings about the blue eyes he left alone to cry in the rain. As Townes Van Zandt cries out about the pain of losing a friend and watching time pass, the hurt in our own hearts begins to heal. That’s what country music is for. That’s what heartbreak club is for. 

I’m never really going to leave this club called heartbreak. Once you’re in, you’re a member for life - there’s a reason the neon sign outside the diner still bids everyone welcome in that off-putting, vaguely unnatural 1950s lighting. It would be unfair of me to just blame you for putting me here, though you don’t deserve “fair” treatment. It would be disingenuous and a lie to solely blame you, though, so I will tell the truth. It's her. It’s him. It’s you. You are all still running around my head, taunting me and kicking me when I’m down. Only when I’m down. I would like to say I’ve never given any of you a second thought since those days, because God knows you haven’t given me the decency of one. But I wouldn’t be here if that were true. I wouldn’t be looking at the dead linoleum checkered floors of the diner. I wouldn’t be listening to Angela talk about how her deadbeat, good-for-nothing boyfriend showed up to her senior prom with the girl he told her not to worry about…while they were still together! I feel sorry for her. I feel the tears rushing down her face. I feel all of her frustration, her anger. It is mine. It is all of ours. 

I’m always there for the meetings of this club called heartbreak. I look at the teal and white patterned floors and the red plastic swivel chairs with holes in them from use around a drab counter. Without loyal patrons, all that’s left to see is an altar where the downtrodden go to worship. Much like the people beside me who will always curse the names of people like you who left them in the cold, there will always be a part of me that hates you. I hate myself for that. I was always taught to be the kind of girl who never lets things weigh her fragile heart down. Your heart can break, but not for long. I hate you for making me the kind of girl who can’t let go, still grasping her heart like a bloody and cracked hand around a straw. Hours, days, months, years later I still have my own blood dripping from my hands (why hasn’t it dried? I have become Lady Macbeth.). I start to hate you for making me hate myself. I stay up for long nights and think up long fights wallowing in this spiral of hate while it consumes my heart, piece by broken piece. Cliche. A broken heart? Well, it suits you - cartoon, predictable villain you are. Actually, calling you a cartoon villain is insulting to cartoon villains. At least they have cool one-liners. At least they have the possibility of a redemption arc. 

I’m a star at this club called heartbreak. People like me there - they smile when they see me walk in, the waitress frowns when I say I have to be getting home. I didn’t know people did that. I didn’t know there was a place in this world, however lead paint and out of date decor filled, that wanted me. Or, maybe I did, and you made me forget that I knew. We’re not friends there - we don’t laugh, we don’t have fun - but we understand each other. We’ve seen each other cry, and it’s hard to imagine a much deeper bond than that. It’s almost comical to think about what this place was before. At one point, it was full of reckless high school students paying twenty cents for a root beer float, people on their way to work grabbing a coffee and eggs, theater kids performing opening numbers for the staff after coming from their opening show. I almost feel like we’re doing it a disservice - what was once filled with so much love and light now has enough darkness to blanket the world. But maybe now the building can join heartbreak club. Maybe now the walls won’t have to listen because they’ve talked. 

You’re part of a club called heartbreakers - you meet on Saturdays in a crowded 80s mall. The faux modernity of the still-functioning mall speaks to the facade of love most of you have put on. Instead of the dull lights of the diner, you get flashy red and blue signs. You get synthy music about being in love. You get adoration. You get happiness. You get to shop. I’ll bet you get ice cream and soda in plastic cups with that dark blue background and the Pepsi logo on them. I’ll bet you get a plate of fries and a hotdog and you carry it in one of those stupid “thank you” take out bags. I’ll bet you chat with your fake friends with shopping bags all along your arm. I’d wish you a quick descent into madness, but heartbreak club has taught me better than that. Does heartbreakers club? I wonder what you talk about - do you talk their ears off about how you did right by me the whole time? How I was the bitch for abandoning you? I’d never know because I have never been like you one day in my life. And that is the one thing I can be proud of about myself. So I’ll take my abandoned diner, you take your 1980s mall. I’ll take my heartbreak, and I’ll let you take the fall.
