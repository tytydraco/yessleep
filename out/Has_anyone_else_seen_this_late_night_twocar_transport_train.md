I’m not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I need to ask someone, *anyone*, about it. Hell, I made this reddit account specifically to post this, as I usually just lurk and scroll. Hopefully someone out there has seen the same thing as me, because it’s been driving me crazy.

It started about a year ago, when my wife and I bought our first house in this quiet little country town in the middle of nowhere, USA. It’s not a great house by any means, just a little one-story fixer-upper, but we saved and scrimped, and took on probably more debt than we should have in order to buy it. Our plan was, and still is, to fix it up and make it home for us and whomever we sell it to down the road.

Anyways, the first time I saw the train was after a late evening supply run when we were working on one of our projects. I think it was one of the rooms we were painting – we’d run out of paint with an entire wall left to go (on just the first coat), so I ran to the hardware store about an hour away to get more. I figured I’d just grab all we’d need to finish the room’s second coat while I was out and then got some taco bell (I think it was like 10:30 pm or so by this point, so they were the only place open unless I wanted to traipse all the way across town) and went home.

When I got back to the town my new home is in, it was getting close to midnight. I probably drove a little slower on the way back than I did when heading out, as country roads around here are lousy with wildlife in the fall, especially after sunset. Either way, I was about to cross the train tracks when my radio fuzzed out. That’s not out of the ordinary – being so far away from large towns often means few radio stations come through clearly – but it got my attention just in time.

For a bit of context, there’s a single railroad crossing in my town, and most people live on the other side, myself included. It’s got the flashing lights and arm that comes down, with the loud bell sound, etc. It’s everything you’d expect from a crossing, and I’ve never seen it malfunction except when this train comes through. It’s the oddest thing – the arm comes down, but the lights don’t flash, the bell doesn’t toll. If I’d not been paying attention due to the radio fuzzing out, I might have driven through it.

And then I saw the train itself. It was just two cars: the engine, which was as unremarkable as any other, and a single flat car. On the flat car, sat in the center, was a single metal cube. From the side I saw it (though admittedly from a short distance), there didn’t appear to be any door or other way to open it. Around it stood three guards in tactical gear, rifles at the ready and trained on the cube. I remember thinking that I must have been more tired than I thought, because surely they’d be pointing their guns away from it, to keep people from approaching?

The only lights on the train were the guards' flashlights, along with a solitary light of some sort above the cube (it might have been connected, not sure). It was barely bright enough for me to make out the details I did, but the train was moving super slow, so I know I didn’t imagine it or something. Oh, and before I forget, the train was extremely quiet. Like, usually when the trains come through here, it’s loud, it shakes the house, and there’s no missing it. This one was nearly dead silent, and I’m sure if I hadn’t been next to the tracks in my car, I’d never have heard it.

Something about it really unsettled me, and I can’t stop thinking about it. I’ve been going out around midnight every night since, trying to see it again, and have seen it three times since. Each time, going in the same direction, with three armed guards and barely any light. This last time, about a week ago, one of the guards seemed different. Less tense, maybe? Like I said before, its hard to see well in the dark, but their stance was just a little less rigid than the others’.

So, has anyone else seen this (or something like it) before? Part of me wants to just walk the tracks and see if I can find where they went. I know I shouldn’t worry so much about this, but something about it truly bothers me to my core. What was in the box? Why were they so focused on it, like it was dangerous? And with the guns, I have to imagine it was something living.
