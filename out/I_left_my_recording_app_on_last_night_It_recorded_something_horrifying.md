Last night before bed, I dictated some notes about a project I’m working on into my voice recording app. When I got up in the morning, I realized I’d never turned it off; there was a seven-hour, twenty-one minute long recording waiting for me.

Later that night, as I was cooking dinner, I decided to have a listen. Did I still snore? Two years ago, in my last serious relationship, my boyfriend said I did. Or did I sleepwalk? One time I found my salt in the middle of the counter, without any memory of putting it there. Maybe I was one of those people who could cook a whole meal in their sleep without ever knowing about it.

Curious, I tapped a random spot in the middle of the seven hours and hit ‘PLAY.’

Quiet white noise played through the phone’s speakers. Then the soft rustling of blankets, as I rolled over.

I finished cooking my chicken, pulled the Brussels sprouts out of the toaster oven, and plated everything up. I ate for several minutes, listening, but there was only more white noise. *Maybe I should just put on the TV. This is getting a little boring.*

But just as I reached for the phone, I heard it.

*Creeeaaak.*

The unmistakable sound of a door opening.

*Huh. I don’t remember getting up to use the bathroom*. Knife poised over the chicken breast, I listened closely, for footsteps or a toilet flush or anything else. A moment later, I heard the door quietly shut; then there was only more white noise.

I shrugged and cut into the chicken. Took a bite. *Too dry. I’ll have to brine it longer next time.* I lifted my fork over a roasted sprout—

I froze.

There was a sound coming over the white noise. So quiet it was almost inaudible. But I could hear it, because it was irregular—a *sshhh*ing or hissing noise coming through at odd intervals. I paused, tilting my head, holding my breath as I listened.

The sound grew louder. I turned the volume up on my phone, holding my breath, straining to listen. I couldn’t quite make it out… but it almost sounded like…

Whispering.

The sound then faded away, and the uninterrupted rush of the white noise took over. I let out the breath I’d been holding and slumped back in my seat.

I listened for the next several minutes as I finished dinner, but it was just more white noise and rustling. *I guess I don’t snore anymore,* I thought. I picked up my plates and got up to bring them to the sink—

And then I heard it.

*Shabantemetashabantemeta*

Whispering.

*Loud* whispering.

As if, whoever was saying it, was right next to the phone.

As if they were *right in my bed.*

I dropped the plate. It shattered on the floor. But I couldn’t move. Couldn’t breathe.

*No. It has to be me. I must be sleeptalking.*

*There’s no way it could be someone else.*

I collapsed back into the chair and stared at the phone. At the jagged soundwave on the app. The whispering continued, a string of indecipherable syllables.

And then it stopped. I grabbed the phone and rewound it, playing the whisper again. But I couldn’t make out any individual words. Just the same sounds over and over: *shabantemeta, shabantemeta.*

*What was I trying to say?*

I paused the recording and whispered the syllables to myself. *Shabantemeta.* But I had to admit… the way I whispered them didn’t sound at all like the recording.

*Was someone… actually in here?*

*Should I call the police?*

I shook my head. I’d watched too many true crime shows. There was absolutely no evidence of a break-in. I locked the place up like a fortress at night. It had to just be me, sleeptalking. My mom told me I sleeptalked once or twice as a kid. I must do it all the time, without realizing.

Sighing, I finally got up and cleaned the shattered plate.

That evening, as I went about various chores, I kept the recording playing in the background. I thought I heard the whispering a few more times—but it was so quiet, it very well could’ve been my imagination. Other than that, there was just white noise and occasional rustling. Finally, at around ten PM, I reached the end.

I got settled in bed, pulling the covers over me. For a second, I considered turning the app on and recording my sleep again; but I decided against it. It would only bring more stress. So I cuddled against the pillow and closed my eyes.

But as I drifted off into sleep, a horrible thought occurred to me.

*Before the whispering, I’d heard the door open and close.*

*But I didn't hear it a second time.*

*If it wasn’t me, whoever it was—*

*They’re still here.*
