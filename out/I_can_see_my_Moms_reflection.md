Sorry for the formatting, I’m a bit of a mess right now...

I’ve been thinking about writing down what’s happening to me for some time, but I guess before today, I really couldn’t bring myself to do so.

Partly, because I’m afraid. Somehow, I feel like the act of doing that might make it all real... and I don’t want that. Please. Don’t... I just want to wake up in some hospital or even a straight jacket, instead of sitting here.

Shit... I can feel myself hesitating again, avoiding the problem...

That’s something I’ve always done.

Even as a child.

I don’t know why, or how to stop myself from doing it, but I’ve always been one for procrastinating and running away from my problems. It has cost me money, opportunities and even relationships, but right now, something more is at stake, I fear.

Back when I was a child, it was my mother, who always helped me out.

She stayed up with me when I realized that I had put off doing some project until the last evening, aiding me, encouraging me, and simply being there to support me in whichever way she could.

Even though she had to get up early the next day, she would sit by my side while I worked on my projects until 2 or even 3a.m. in the morning. I loved her, and she loved me too.

You see, my Dad was out of the picture pretty much the moment I was born. He went out to ‘buy cigarettes’ and never returned.

Well, Mom wasn’t surprised. She told me once, when I was older, that she had expected him to run even earlier, and that she wasn’t even mad at him, since his disappearance meant that I wouldn’t grow up with a bad example.

I didn’t care much either.

Everything he could have done for me, Mom did far better than he could have.

She told me how to ride a bike, how to talk to people and make friends... she even managed to teach me how to dance for prom... There was nothing she couldn’t do, I thought back then.

Even now, I’m still remembering her, all this warmth and her laughter... and even though it breaks my heart, I’m doing my best to smile through the tears.

She pushed me when I needed it, helped me when I didn’t feel like I could go on, and caught me when I failed.

My Mom was my hero. Still is, kinda...

Without her help I would have never amounted to much in life, if I’m being honest.

We celebrated my getting through school and into college, then my BA, my first real job, and even the small apartment I can now call mine...

Friends and partners came and left, but my Mom was always there for me.

At least every few days I would call her. Sometimes with problems, she was glad to help me with, other times just to talk.

Her voice stopped me from spiraling more times than I can count.

She was my rock, someone who I could always rely on.

Well... until she wasn’t.

It happened two months ago. A car accident.

One of those big trucks spun out and hit her car... there was nothing anyone could have done to save her, she was dead before the paramedics even arrived on the scene.

The news broke me completely.

I was pacing around my living room with the phone in hand, sobbing and screaming, and I’m pretty sure I worried that poor police officer who had called me.

Maybe I would have spiraled out of control then and there, if I hadn’t remembered her voice and what she always used to say.

One step at a time. One problem after another.

So I did what she would have wanted me to do, sat down, and wrote a list.

My boss at the company was great, so he let me take bereavement leave, and I drove to my mom’s place and took care of everything there.

I can hardly remember those days, to be honest. It felt like I was walking around in a fog, trying to never let my hands rest, for fear of breaking down completely.

Most of her stuff I gave to Goodwill, like she would have wanted, and took only some of the things that reminded me of her.

A vase I gifted her when I was 12. This necklace, silver with two sapphires, she always wore on special occasions. Her bedroom mirror, with the photos of us, stuck to the frame.

I would love to say that I got over it, that I managed to work through everything then and there, but that’s just not true. The next few weeks, I was a complete mess. I hardly slept, I started drinking and smoking pot almost every night, and I think I would have been fired from my job if it wasn’t for an intervention.

As strange as it sounds, I think it was her who saved me.

After one of my binges, when I was lying in bed, drunk off my ass and high as a kite I could feel myself falling asleep and slipping into the same nightmare again.

One about waking up in our old home as a child, yet finding it empty.

It was then, that I heard her voice.

I still remember sitting in my bedroom, crying, when she called out to me.

Deep down I knew even in the dream that she had died, yet hearing my name, spoken by her voice, seemed to shift everything around me.

The shadows shrunk back, and I stopped crying and listened.

She called me again and again until I finally hopped from the bed and began to walk through the dead and empty house.

My mother’s voice guided me, first out of my room which seemed so much bigger than it should be, then into the hallway, where the shadows reigned.

I could feel fear like a child in that dream, yet every time I thought about stopping, she called my name again and told me to keep going.

One step at a time.

Of course, I followed her voice.

She led me past the shadows and into her old bedroom, where she told me to take a deep breath, and then hop on the bed.

I still remember the darkness under there beginning to whirl around the moment I hopped on the mattress.

Mom spoke to me, and finally, I saw her.

She was sitting on the bed, next to me, but only in the reflection of the mirror.

So close, yet still too far away.

She looked just like she had the last time I had seen her, only sadder. Tears were streaming down her face while she told me that I needed to stop. To be strong. To go on on my own. I tried to get a word in, but she shushed me immediately.

She told me that she shouldn’t have come back, but that she could feel me suffering, which was something she never could stand. I was crying too much to even try and reply.

Somehow, I think I could feel her presence. Her warmth and love.

Then she told me that this would be goodbye. That I wouldn’t see her again, but that that didn’t mean it would be the end.

She told me that she loved me, that she was proud of the person I had become and with her last word, the dream ended, and I woke up in my bed.

My pillow was drenched in tears, and I was crying, but still, for the first time since that dreadful phone call, I felt like I could breathe again.

The next few days, I was still kind of a mess, but I slowly managed to get myself together.

I showered, stopped drinking, and started to wake up on time again.

Even though I didn’t like it, I forced myself to take walks and breaks, to cook for myself, and go out among people once more.

Every time I felt like I could start spiraling again, I remembered that dream and her voice, telling me how much she loved me.

My friends welcomed me back as well, and it looked like everything would be okay.

But that was only on the outside.

To be brutally honest, most of it was just a facade.

I still felt like shit pretty much all of the time and was hanging by a thread every evening, just waiting to climb back into that bottle to drown out reality.

My relapse came a week later.

After a shit day at work, I came home and I just couldn’t stand it anymore.

All I wanted was to call Mom and talk to her. Hear her voice and ask her how I was meant to deal with it all. But she wouldn’t pick up her phone. Never again.

So I pulled out the bottle, opened it, and took a big gulp. I cried and that was when my misery truly started.

When I whispered my Mom’s name, something answered.

It was quiet at first. Hardly more than a breath.

But I was sure that I had just heard a voice saying my name.

Of course, I looked at the bottle, which was still practically full, and put it down.

Only... the voice persisted.

It was calling out my name and getting louder every time.

I don’t know what made me do it, but I stood up and started walking around the apartment, looking for the source. Maybe I should have just packed a bag and run away...

Well, I found it, after a few minutes. In my bedroom. The mirror I had taken from my Mom’s belongings.

I didn’t see anything in there, at least not that evening, but I could hear the voice more clearly there, still calling out my name, so I answered, and suddenly it stopped.

That experience sobered me up real quick. Instead of going back to the bottle, I just brushed my teeth and went to bed. I was done with the world.

The dreams I had that night were worse than anything I had ever had before.

I found myself back in the old house, sitting on my Mom’s bed, in her bedroom. Only this time, she wasn’t calling out to me.

There was a darkness in the mirror and a shrill voice, laughing while the shadows in the room seemed to dance to its rhythm.

Every time I moved, the voice got louder, higher. Its laughter turned more and more twisted while the bed began to shake.

Hands shot out from under the bed and started to grab at the bedding, pulling it, and me, down to the floor.

I woke up, drenched in sweat with a heart racing out of control.

Do you want to know the worst thing?

Something was whispering my name again.

From the mirror.

I called out of work and instead chose to spend the day outside like my Mom would have told me to. The voice didn’t follow, so I soon felt better.

Well, that didn’t last long, sad to say.

Only until I entered the apartment again, to be precise.

The moment I stepped over the threshold, the voice reached my ears once more.

It sounded like Mom and then, on some level, not... It was an imitation, a mockery, almost, and I felt like I was losing my mind.

Of course, I tried recording it but got nothing but some white noise, then I tried answering again, only this time, it didn’t stop it at all. Instead, it got louder.

In the end, I called over a friend, and that made it disappear.

I don’t know if it can be heard by other people or not, since the voice only comes out if it’s just me here. Back then, I thought it was afraid of other people, but I’m not so sure of that anymore.

It’s playing with me, I fear.

You’re probably thinking I’m just having a mental breakdown. Some kind of unresolved, stress-induced trauma.

It could be that you’re right, of course. Only... well, the next opening with a psychologist is in around 2 months, and I’m pretty sure I won’t make it until then.

I was already at the ER, but they sent me away since they didn’t think I was a threat to myself or others. They gave me some mild sleeping pills and told me to take it easy for a few days, at least.

What a joke...

I took the pills, like they told me to do, but since then, my nightmares have gotten even worse.

That evening, Mom was in my dreams. Only, she didn’t talk. Couldn’t.

I saw her in the mirror, but she wasn’t alone anymore.

Some... thing... dark and big and almost formless was holding her, keeping her from speaking, while tears were streaming down her face.

Every time she tried to say something, this strange monstrosity started cackling my name, getting shriller and shriller until I woke up with a scream.

Since that night, I can see it even when I’m awake.

It was in the mirror, sometimes standing over my bed, other times walking through the room.

Every once in a while it called out my name, as if to mock me.

I threw a bottle into the mirror two days ago... I couldn’t stand it any longer.

Only... it didn’t help.

On the contrary, it got worse.

The laughter I heard as the mirror burst into tiny shards made me shiver, and since then, I can hear this voice calling out to me coming from every reflective surface, every window, every polished piece of metal.

It’s laughing, almost whinnying when I look at it, and I’m losing my mind completely.

I think I was fired yesterday, at least according to my email, but I don’t want to open my laptop to check. Once the screen turns black, I will be able to see this thing, standing right behind me. I know it.

In my desperation, I started to glue my Mom’s mirror back together.

It’s hard to see in there, with all the cracks and missing pieces and blood from all the cuts...

But I think I can make it out now.

The thing is dragging her around.

Torturing her... and me.

I don’t know what it wants, but I’m afraid I can guess it.

Maybe someone to take her place?

Me?

You?

All I know is this...

I can see my Mom’s reflection...

The tears in her eyes.

If I don’t do something soon...

I think I really might lose my [mind.](https://www.reddit.com/r/audiodrama/comments/10hqkpe/haunted_tales_a_horror_anthology_podcast/)
