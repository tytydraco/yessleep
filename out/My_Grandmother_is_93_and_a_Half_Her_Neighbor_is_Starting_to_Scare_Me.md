In October of 2011, my grandfather on my mother's side passed away from a massive heart attack, leaving my grandmother widowed in her house above the San Francisco Bay of California. The house that she lives in to this day is the same house that my mom grew up in. My grandmother lives on a hillside and when my mom was an older child, a new family moved into the house next door, up the hill from my grandmother's current residence. My mom played with several of the other kids that were her age that lived in the area, and one of them, a guy, let's just call him Rob, still lives there to this day. The people that moved in next door were nice, but it was their son who began to act - rather strangely - especially within the last few years or so. For the sake of this story, let's just call him Ed.

Ed seemed pretty harmless at first, as he would work on his hot-rod pickup truck in his driveway, and he had a successful business. Now I can't remember what Ed did in his business exactly, but he was successful. But lately he's been acting strange. 

One day my mom and I went up to visit my grandmother and when we pulled into the driveway, Ed was outside and he started talking to us. His speech seemed okay but he was saying a few weird phrases. Another time I was up there visiting my grandma with my mom, I was outside by myself. It was still late afternoon and in broad daylight and I was looking up at the moon that was visible in the sky, I think it was a gibbous moon, or the moon was more than half full, but still not a full moon. I love astronomy and looking at the moon and I could write a whole other post about the moon, but this is about my grandmother's neighbor, not the moon. Well, Ed started talking to me about ' me seeing God' in the sky. Like what? Ed was rambling on to me, or 'preaching' to me about God being visible in the sky because he saw me looking up into the daytime sky, when I was just simply looking up at the moon in the sky. 

These next 2 cases that I directly witnessed are by far the most disturbing. The first, my mom, dad, and myself were driving up my grandmother's street about to pull into my grandmother's driveway when we saw Ed, standing out by the street holding a heavy metal rod or pipe. He had a disturbing look on his face and in his eyes, and the way he was holding the heavy metal rod looked very threatening. We all kept an eye on him as we exited my mom's car and my dad asked Ed in a concerned caring tone, "Are you okay?" Then Ed answered back in a mocking way, "Are YOU okay?" My mom was thoroughly freaked out by Ed that day. The second, My mom and dad and myself were at my grandmother's house celebrating Christmas with my grandmother and my mom's friend and her husband and daughter, and the daughter's boyfriend. The sun had set and it was dark and cold out. Suddenly we started hearing what sounded like shouting coming from outside. At first, I thought it was just some rowdy teenagers yacking it up, but the shouting turned to angry sounding yelling and immediately my mom and I knew that it was Ed having an irrational fit of rage at nothing. Rob, the neighbor across the street that my mom used to hang out with as kids, heard it. Now these events are those that I directly witnessed.

The events that I have not witnessed are even more disturbing. One time, Ed crossed the street at night and with either a baseball bat or some other clublike object and entered onto Rob's property and literally was knocking out Rob's outside lights. Another time, Ed found a way into Rob's garage at night and began causing chaos and likely some property damage as well. Rob ended up getting a restraining order put on Ed. Ed's behavior was also getting so bad that his mom and siblings also have restraining orders against him and never try to visit him. Ed also confronted my grandmother's landscape guys and he was shouting at them to leave, my guess is that they were using a gas-powered leaf blower or some other noisy equipment. I personally hate the sound of gas-powered lawn care equipment, and the worst for me are the gas chainsaws. I personally think there should be tighter restrictions on the usage of those tools and more encouragement of the use of the battery-powered and quieter chainsaws, blowers, and trimmers. However Ed has more issues than just a simple noise-sensitivity - he just seems like he just hates everybody. He's caused other problems for my grandmother, one of which is he intentionally knocks over he garbage bins so their contents spill out and make a mess. I do worry about my grandmother's safety, though she does have a house alarm, but a house alarm is a deterrent, and if he further spirals downward in his mental health and self-control, he could very well become a dangerous unhinged psycho, right next door to my 93 and a half year old grandmother. What if instead of a bat or rod, he starts carrying around something - much worse...
