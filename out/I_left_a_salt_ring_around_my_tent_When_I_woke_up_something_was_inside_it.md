They’ll say I vanished. That I made a wrong turn, maybe got hurt and couldn’t get back. That it was just bad luck. But I didn’t get lost. I didn’t fall. I left the trail because something pulled me off it.

I’ve hiked alone for over a decade. Fifty-three trails across six states. No accidents. No panic. I’m not someone who scares easy. That’s why I noticed when the forest changed.

It was June 6th. I was doing a short two-day solo route through the Berkshires. Good weather, clear skies, familiar terrain. I’d even camped in the same spot a year before.

Around 11:40PM, I got this feeling — like the forest had gotten heavier. I don’t mean emotionally. I mean it literally felt like pressure was building around me, like the trees were holding their breath. Not a sound. No crickets, no rustling. Just stillness.

Something told me to make a salt circle around my tent. I know how that sounds. I brought salt with me because of an old hiking habit — sprinkle it around gear to keep some bugs off. But that night, I used all of it. A full circle. Then I zipped the tent and tried to sleep.

I woke at exactly 2:21AM. My watch has a backlight, and I checked it before I even opened my eyes. Something was wrong before I saw it. The air was cold. Too cold for June. I could feel that pressure again, like the night was pressing in on me.

When I looked out, there was something standing inside the salt ring.

It wasn’t moving. It wasn’t speaking. It didn’t even seem to breathe. I stared at it for over a minute, frozen.

It was tall. Human-shaped. But wrong. Its limbs were long, the way shadows stretch when the fire flickers. It wasn’t wearing anything of its own — it was wearing my jacket.

And then it crouched. Slowly. Deliberately. Like it was adjusting its posture to copy mine.

I ran. I didn’t grab anything. Just the flashlight and my phone. I sprinted down the trail, but I don’t even think I was heading the right way. I saw a light up ahead. I thought it was a ranger. It blinked — once, twice, three times. Like someone signalling.

I followed.

The closer I got, the further away it moved. I kept chasing, thinking I was close, but I never reached it.

Eventually, the trail just disappeared. The tape I had tied to trees earlier was gone. And when I checked the trunks, the bark was smooth. No marks. No breaks. Like nothing had ever touched them.

I kept walking. Hours, maybe. It’s hard to tell in the woods when everything looks the same. I found a hollow tree and crawled inside. I recorded a voice message — just in case. If someone found the phone, they’d know I didn’t get lost.

“If you’re hearing this... it followed me. It looks like a person, but it’s not. It has no face. It moves wrong.”

I don’t remember sleeping, but when I opened my eyes again, my phone was gone. The light outside had shifted — like the sun was setting, but it was barely past dawn.

And that’s when I saw myself.

Same hair. Same jacket. Same boots. Standing twenty feet away, half behind a tree. Just watching.

I blinked — she was closer. Same face. Same tired eyes. She tilted her head the way I do when I’m trying to listen.

Then she smiled. Slowly. Her mouth kept opening. Too wide. Wider than it should.

I ran again. I didn’t stop. I don’t even remember what happened after that.

But someone found the phone. Buried inside that hollow tree.

Still recording.

The voice on it is mine.

But I never said the last words.

“Come find me.”
