I have to get this out there. I’m using a burner account, something to throw away after I’m done. I cannot sit on this story, possibly getting someone else hurt. I cannot live with that, I don’t care if the Higher Ups find me, people must know what is still out there.

My entire life, I’ve been a nature guy. I camped nearly weekly - was always planning my next hike, and I would always be the one to organise drunken fishing trips with my friends. Knowing this, the office life dragged me down, and I jumped from job to job, hating every second. So, naturally, when the offer came from the World Wildlife Fund to be one of their rangers, I was ecstatic. When I started, I finally felt like I had a calling, and I put my soul into that job. Said job was never easy, nor was it a slog. I found conservation work to be rewarding. The feeling of making a difference in saving an ecosystem was exhilarating. But not anymore.

This may be confusing to you, so let me start from that morning:

The blaring of my alarm dragged my conscious mind out from the depths of sleep. Lead in my limbs, I blinked away the grogginess and haphazardly slapped my alarm clock until it shut up.

7:00 AM.

As my brain fired for the first time since my eyes opened, I rose out of bed, stretching, and hobbled over to the bathroom. I quickly freshened up and stepped out into my living room, before sitting down at my desk and reviewing the latest data from my last excursion.

For context, my job was to gather data and report on anomalies in various global ecosystems, meaning I always had a fair bit of paperwork to do, or create, and my free time usually consisted of reviewing said data. I was doing just that, analysing an uptick in Yellowstone wolf populations, when my phone rang. I grabbed it, The intrusive light flashing ‘James.’ I picked it up almost immediately.

‘Hey.’ I started, remnants of my morning tone still fading.

‘Damn, dude. Just woke up?’ he taunted. His grin was almost audible.

‘Yeah, yeah.’ I chuckled.

‘Anyway, the boss just got in touch. Were heading out to Argentina. Some suspicious activity over in Patagonia.’

Id been to South America before, but the one thing I’d learned from this job is that the travelling never got any less exciting.

‘Oh, really? What kind? We thinkin’ poachers?’

‘That’s what I’ve heard. I’ve also heard they’re really doing a number on the local biodiversity, so they’ve called us to go and check it out. The flight is, apparently, scheduled to leave tonight so we get there the following morning. Best pack soon. We’ve got Charles and Haley coming too, so the 4 of us should have it covered. Pack for a week at least, or so they said.’

My eyebrows lifted. It’s rare that all 4 of us got to go on the same assignment, so I was pretty excited.

‘Seems like were supposed to enjoy this one too, then?’ I respond, humorously.

‘Hell yeah, dude. Were all meeting at HQ to be transported down in a few. Ill see you there, Luke.’

‘See you there.’

The line cut, before the monotone beep of an ended call rung through my ear.

The Sun’s rays shining through my window, bathing my living room in a warm glow, reflecting off of surfaces in the way that left rainbows dancing across glass when you looked at them right. I smiled, before moving to pack my belongings. I threw in 9 days’ worth: Refreshments, a walkie talkie, a pair of binoculars, and my every handy field-knife, before shouldering my backpack. The weight of it rubbed on my back and dragged me down, as if I were giving a piggyback ride to a tungsten cube.

As soon as the door opened, a chill breeze caressed my being, I couldn’t help but relish it against the beaming of the sun. The walk wasn’t long, no more than 10 minutes, but the thought of travelling across the globe tonight had the clock ticking half as fast in excitement.

When I finally pushed the glass doors open, WWF logo standing proudly above them, I was greeting by the clacking of keyboards and distant chatter. I approached the man on the front desk:  
‘Hi. I’m on the Argentina flight leaving today.’ I handed over my ID, ‘I’m investigating anomalies in the Patagonian wilderness.’

The man flipped the ID in his hands, before handing it back to me. ‘You’re all good, Luke. Your colleagues will be arriving any minute now. Good luck on your mission.’ He clarified before returning to work. I thanked him before meandering down to a seat in the lobby, defaulting to retrieving my phone from my pocket. As I was playing away, a larger man with a goatee and a solid gaze strode towards the desk and repeated the process I did, before walking over to me.

‘You made it!’ James spoke and he stopped in front of me ‘Ready for this?’

I stood up, shook his hand, and pulled him into a one-armed hug, ‘Ready as I’ll ever be.’

James, by all means, was a unit. He possessed a bulky, muscular frame, black hair, and a cleanly shaved goatee. His WWF Ranger shirt clung tightly to his frame, giving way to large legs donned with shorts and thick working boots.

‘I know I am. You been alright?’ He asked as we separated.

‘I’ve been fine. The data’s rough, though.’ I rubbed the back of my neck. James chuckled.

‘Shame, as now you’ll have even more to work on when we get back. Lucky you!’ I glared at him, before cracking a smile. He continued, ‘I’ve brought the drone, though, so hopefully I can make it easier on you.’

Then, the doors opened again, and in stepped a brunette woman with a backpack too large for her body. She wandered over to us after being cleared by the man at the desk.

‘Hello!’ She called out to us, pulling us both into a tight hug.

‘Morning, Haley!’ we both exclaimed in unison. Haley was slightly shorter than us, equipped with dazzling green eyes, long, wavy hair and a smile that could kill. She was dressed similarly to the two of us - company dress code and all - with a fitting shirt, a wide brimmed hat, and shorts paired with tough, leather hiking boots.

‘Patagonia, huh?’ She grins, ‘Back to South America!’

‘Yeah! It’s just like old times, give or take about 2500 kilometres.’ Said James, grinning.

‘I’m actually quite excited!’ I swap glances with both parties.

If there was one thing I enjoyed tearing down, it was poaching operations. It felt magical to catch the bastards red handed.

After some more chatter, our last companion approached the desk – A darker man with messy hair, WWF outdoor clothing, and a leaner physique.

‘Morning, fellas!’ He gave an exaggerated wave in our direction.

‘Charles!’ I greet, returning the wave and gesturing him over. We exchange a hug, before he does the same to the others.

‘Ready to go?’ His energy seeped into my own, bolstering it.

‘Damn right. Let’s do this!’ James confirmed.

The following journey to Patagonia was not very memorable. It was filled with jokes, gossip, and other things, no doubt, but I cannot remember details. I remember staring out of the airplane window, drinking in the mountain views as we landed, but above all else, it’s like there’s a hole in my memory.

After we landed, it was straight to the campsite. We were given a temporary ranger vehicle to take us to our region. For your own safety, I will not be disclosing the location itself.

After we arrived, the majority of the day was taken up by setup. While the other three elected to build camp, I was the designated camera trap guy, meaning I was off-road for a long time setting them and marking their location on my phone.

For more context, I will be detailing the overall location of the cameras, so you can visualise the layout of my setup:

First, I set up a camera closer to camp. The goal was to monitor populations and closer to our site, telling us when to be more careful. I doubted it would capture much. This will be known as Cam 1.

The Second, Cam 2, I placed further into a grass clearing, giving a wide scope of the mountains in the distance and the plains before. The goal of this one was to monitor larger herds of indigenous species, like Guanacos and Pudu Deer.

Cam 3, I set up further into the trees to the left of the first two. I wanted this one to catch poacher activity, like snare setups.

Finally, I placed Cam 4 near the largest watering hole in the area, about a mile out from camp. Along with our game counts, this camera was supposed to give us a larger scope of the overall wildlife populations in the area. The order of proximity to camp, from furthest to closest, was 1, 3, 2, 4.

The cameras we were given had the ability to report data straight back to a central device - highlighting which camera had spotted what - allowing us to prioritise cameras based on these facts.

Before heading back to the camp, I looked out onto the land, taking in the biome fully. Large herds of Pudu and Guanacos littered the plains ahead, feasting on the buffet of grasses and shrubs around. Condors rhythmically circled a ways away, as if dancing with the air high in the sky. The calls of various animals filled the ambient air with the symphony of life. I found myself smiling wistfully and the grandeur of it all.

Then, I noticed something. I squinted, before pulling the binoculars out of my pack and holding them to my eyes:

The herds were all too tense. They spiralled at the slightest movement of brush, the tiniest foreign noise. I knew that prey animals should be weary, but they were so weary they almost didn’t feed at all. Then, I saw that there were more Condors. Another 3 in the distance of the herds, circling away above what was likely another bounty of carrion. A creeping anxiety festered in my chest as I observed. This was off – unnatural.

I brought the walkie to my mouth:

‘Hey, anyone copy?’

A moment passed, before static broke into another voice,

‘Lound and clear, Luke. What’s up?’ Charles’s voice.

‘I think this is more serious than we thought. The local herds are REALLY on edge, Condors are everywhere.’ I responded.

Silence. Charles must’ve been talking to the others back at camp.

**Crackle**

‘I just spoke to the others – they say we shouldn’t worry too much yet – Focus on getting everything set up, and we’ll go on a game count tomorrow. Sound good?’ He responded.

I took a deep breath, reminding myself of why we were here: It was poacher activity causing this. There’d be more deaths due to successful hunts, leading to more Condors, and the herds will be more careful now that their members have dropped suddenly.

‘Sounds good. I’m on my way back now – Cameras are up and running.’

I took notes and moved back into the car, slamming the door and starting it. I waved at the camera as I passed by and returned to the others. The sun had started to rest, lowering itself down further to the horizon to allow the night to take over. I shivered; the temperature had dropped dramatically.

When I returned, the others felt the same way: Haley had changed into work trousers and slipped on a jacket as she finished the last tent, while Charles and James were stoking a fire in the centre of camp. They perked up at the sound of me pulling in and greeted me with a wave.

‘Welcome home, Luke. Good job on the cameras.’ Haley said. I replied with a smile and a thumbs up.

I see you’ve got flames up and running. Anyone bring anything fun?’ I asked. Before I could respond, James reached into his bag and pulled out a bag of marshmallows.

‘Damn right!’ he sing-songed, picking up 4 sticks of the ground, wiping them, and handing us one each. ‘Down for a roasting session?’

‘Hell yeah.’ Charles grinned.

‘Always.’ Haley laughed.

‘Aw shit. Why not?’ I chuckled as we all gathered around the fire, joking and laughing as we bit into gooey, sweet bliss. This went on for a while before the cold sunk its fangs into us, and we retired to our tents.

I flipped off my light, listening to the sounds of nature as I slowly began to drift off.

Then, something stood out to me, A different noise. It was a low, deep hoot that reverberated throughout my entire body.

My eyes opened, bewilderment forcing me up onto my elbows. All the other sounds stilled, leaving only the wind and the rustling of plants outside the camp.

A haunting silence preceded another one, lounder and firmer, but still low and powerful – It sent shivers up my spine.

A zipper from across the camp sounded, followed by a whisper,

‘Guys?’

I undid my tent and slipped my head out, looking Haley in the eyes: ‘You heard it too?’

‘Yeah. What is that?’

Moonlight spread across the suddenly silent wilderness, illuminating the camp as to where the forms of my friends were visible, reflecting the light.

The hoots were replaced by another call. this time, sharper. More shrill bellows that repeated 3 times before pausing.

‘What the fuck?’

I jumped; Charles had appeared from his tent next to mine.

Another triplet of calls.

‘a Rhea, maybe?’ James asked, ‘It sounds kind of avian…’ Another low hoot rippled across the camp, shaking my ribcage.

‘No. Too loud.’ I quickly corrected.

The silence was longer: Still. No animal calls for miles. Stupidly, I climbed out the tent and shined a light into the expanse past camp. I scanned, waiting for something to reveal itself and explain the noise. But nothing did. The only semblance of normalcy was the chilled wind biting into my skin.

Then, as quickly as it all started, it stopped. The calls faded out, and the nocturnal animals resumed their songs.

We slowly clambered back into our tents, promising to investigate in the morning. Sleep didn’t come easily that night – my mind kept replaying those sounds. Eventually, I did black out, as the next thing I remember was waking up.

The next morning, we got to work.

A game drive started us off. We recorded a good number of herds, including Guanacos, Pudu, Flamingos, and even an armadillo or two. But, again, I noticed oddities. The animals didn’t react to our engine, simply observing us pass by, but they bolted at a twig snapping in the underbrush. They blocked out the hunk of metal barrelling through the trails but fled from a rock tumbling from a larger boulder. We noted the strange behaviour in our final count and returned. I wrote into my final report about investigating suspicious persons or behaviours.

‘I’m going to check on those cameras: try and see if one caught the source of those calls last night. Anyone want to come with?’

I checked my phone, the data on it telling me Cams 3 and 4 had the most anomalous sightings.

Haley’s interest piqued, and she stood up.

‘I’ll go, I’m curious too.’

Cam 1 and 2 were retrieved without issue. Cam 3, though, was accompanied by freakishly large tracks. The animal was bipedal, with 3 avian toes and points ahead where claws poked into the ground.

Sweat beaded on my skin as I snapped pictures, worries and questions rising in my mind.

What made these? Why are they so large?

Cam 4, while less incriminating, showed signs of anomalies. Long scratches were forced into the dirt. Grass bowed, as if it were squashed under the weight of an animal. An animal too large for the area.

We started with Cam 1. we looked over the pictures together. There was a few local wildlife, but nothing obviously suspicious.

Cam 2 was the same. A deer pressed its nose up to the camera on one of the photos, rising a giggle from the lot of us.

Cam 3, however, was different.

At first it was normal. Trees swaying in the wind, a curious Guanaco, the likes. But, at 12:09 AM the previous night, something odd caught our attention. We clicked on the image and froze.

It was a clawed limb. Grey skin on 3 long, spindly fingers gave way to enormous talons that stretched below frame. The beginnings of an arm loomed above, the skin shifting into brownish white filaments: Hair like, but not. The light from the photo reflected off the filaments, which created a blinding light towards the patchier parts, revealing mud caked onto it.

‘What?’ James whispered.

Charles was quick to rationalise, nervously chuckling, ‘Must be a Rhea walking off frame, right? Skip to the next one.’

I hesitated, pushing back the doubts in my mind: The claws are too long, the skin looks off.

The second image was the middle part of an extremely muscular leg. Its thigh poked out from the top of the frame, light bouncing back into the lens. The night vision revealed a long shin, with scaly skin tapering off into a backwards facing ankle – avian features. It was posed as if mid stride, walking past the cameras field of view.

Charles’s lips closed. Haley’s eyes widened further. James, stunned, let out a few confused noises. I took a shuddery breath.

The time is too late to be the noises.

We quickly abandoned that camera after cycling through the normal photos.

Cam 4 sent chills through me.

Animals, after a certain time of day, abandoned the area all together. The camera caught glimpses of birds fleeing and herds running into the nearby forest. The watering hole suddenly desolate in the wide Patagonian wilderness. There was no activity until 10:52 PM

The first image presented a barely concealed form in the darkness, a round, small creature digging through the soil. An armadillo.

We breathed a small sigh of relief.

The next image. It was looking back, startled, as if viewing something behind it. In the third image, its blurred form bolted out of frame.

Then, the fourth image. At first, we didn’t see anything other than wafting grasses and insects. But Haley spoke up:

‘Holy shit…’ She gasped, before pointing to the far-left corner.

In the grass, parallel to the camera, was the form of one of the largest creatures I’ve ever seen. Behind some strands of grass was a bipedal, horizontal figure. Two legs moved down from its hind end, tapering off into the beginnings of a snake-like tail.

We all held our breath. Charles went to say something, but paused.

The fifth image. Its head craned above the foliage, a long snout parted into two halves, screaming into the sky. Its neck and cheeks were covered in the same filaments as Cam 3’s thigh. There was no eyeshine, its head tilted slightly to the left enough as to where it could hide its gaze.

the final sixth image showed it wandering out of frame towards the watering hole.

Despite my anxiety in that moment, its shape broke through to me as familiar. I recognised its very essence. From the snout that broke through the shadows, to its tail that swept over the grass. I knew it, but couldn’t place it.

‘That… Isn’t a Rhea.’ James’s voice trembled slightly.

‘Nor a poacher…’ I added. Sweat seeping into my eyes.

Falling asleep that night was nearly impossible. I kept thinking of the images, the animal far too alien to exist. It did exist. For god’s sake, I looked right at it.

I lay there, listening to the hoots and bellows of an unidentified animal, my heart exploding in my chest.

It was closer, that night. Louder. My hopes of sleep, dashed in an instant.

I laid awake that night, getting a few hours at most, before groggily rising from my sleeping bag and eating with the others the following morning.

James was uncharacteristically silent. Tired, baggy eyes blinked slowly. Haley’s hair, messier than usual, betrayed her fatigue. And Charles refused to look any of us in the eye.

‘Kept you up too?’ I asked, a crooked smile gracing my lips.

‘Not a wink.’ Charles replied. The other two nodded in agreement.

‘Then I think we use the drone today. Take it easy.’ I suggested, earning positive hums from the group.

After a breakfast of heated canned beans, I assembled the drone and took to the skies. Its built-in camera swept over the grasslands, catching countless animals clearing our path.

Again, they were fleeing from something minor. The thing on the camera flashed behind my eyes, calling in the deep hooting, but I shook my head and focused.

I mentally took stock of the herd numbers – Healthy, but reduced from the average.

I covered the entire grassland before moving into the thicket of trees, opposite the side where we camped. I flew above the canopy, spotting nesting birds and other normalities in the trees. Until I saw a clearing.

I flew in closer, and the battered remnants of a campsite greeted me. Half-ripped tents flapped lazily in the wind, reaching for freedom. Ash from a pulverised fire splattered all over, paired with gashes and large tracks in the ground. A gasp spread through us, everyone clambering to get a closer look.

‘We have to get out there!’ Charles yelled, and we all rushed into the car. We sped out the camp, barrelling through the grassland. The air was suddenly colder. A chill seeping through me as I forced the car through the grassland and onward into the trees, ripping shrubs and branches underneath the wheels. I pulled the hand break and skid into the campsite, jolting as the car mellowed out into a sudden stop.

‘Look around. Check for signs of life.’ Haley said as she stepped out of the car, others following suit.

‘HELLO!? ANYONE HERE!?’ I yelled into the distance, the only response was the song of nature, no longer comforting. It felt as if it was masking the tragedy like a government coverup.

I jogged over to a large gash in the ground, investigating the depth. Too deep, too long. Not a Puma.

I turned over to a tent, torn in two. I ran over as the others called out into the trees.

Blood soaked into the fabric, the tent drenched in crimson. The stench of copper wafted into my nose, and I had to force down the bile that rose into my throat.

The others called out, examining the fire, the signs of a struggle carved into the mud. Something caught my eye.

A journal, squashed into the mud under a heavy footprint. I walked over, pulling it from the ground with a squelch, and tried my best to clear the pages of mud. The text was somewhat readable now:

‘We took the trail today. Its beautiful around here. The mountains are gorgeous. We even got lucky and managed to capture some Condors circling nearby – I’m saving those. We found strange tracks, though. Bird-like, but far too large to be any known bird around here.’

I read on, flipping the page to the next day.

‘Last night, we heard something. It was rustling in the bushes, extremely large. After it disappeared, we heard it call out. Hoots like a freakishly large owl with a deep voice, and sharper cries.’

My heart skipped a beat – Those noises were eerily similar to the ones we heard. I forced myself to continue reading.

‘We hiked again. The area was suddenly desolate. The animals fled from the watering hole without any reason, and it was deathly silent. I’m beginning to consider leaving.’

‘Something is out there. I can feel it. I’ve heard it twice now, walking around our tent. We’re leaving tomorrow.

The last entry, dated the same day, turned my blood to ice.

It was a hastily drawn sketch of an animal outside of a tent. It was a biped, with a similar build to the one in the camera’s photos. Its avian neck was craned, head tilted sideways in the direction of the tent door, where the viewer was peeking from. Its arms split into three fingered claws that flexed with power, that same tail wavered back and forth like a twisting serpent, and its jaws, filled with massive, serrated teeth seemed to grin at the viewer. The sketch had no pupils, just a blank circle where the eyes should be, as if they were erased. It was covered in quick, rough lines on its neck, back and arms, giving the appearance of small hairs. Based on the perspective, the creature seemed to reach around 14 feet in height in full stretch.

The sketch was flanked by repeating, hastily scrawled messages:

‘THEY WERE NEVER GONE’

With trembling hands, I flipped the page.

‘SHADOW OF DEATH.’

‘Luke!’

I snapped out of my daze, the book fumbling out of my hands and falling back into the mud with a loud splat.

‘You okay, man? We called you three times now!’

I had no voice, the lump in my throat prevented any from forming.

Haley approached me and grabbed my trembling hands:

‘Are you alright?’

I grabbed her arms. She grunted as my grip tightened.

‘We need to go. Now.’

The bushes nearby cracked and rustled. I prayed it was the wind.

After seeing me, the others nodded and moved towards the car. I leapt in and peeled out of the site as fast as I could.

I heard one of my friends speak, but their voice was muffled under the blood rushing in my ears. I sped back to camp, driving as fast as the car would function. I obsessively checked the mirror, expecting to see a monstrosity of a forgotten world stomping after us, but nothing ever came. My chest was cold, heart beating with icy purpose.

When we got back to camp, I paced back and forth, deliberating what to do, when I felt a hand on my shoulder:

‘Hey, hey, calm. Come outside so we can talk about it.’ James was undeniably gentle, but it did nothing to ease the hammering in my ears.

‘What did you see in that book? Because, quite frankly, you’re scaring us.’ Charles added, a worried expression on his face. Haley was waiting outside, preparing a snack.

For some reason, I couldn’t look them in the eyes and tell them. No matter how many times I tried, the only thing I could muster were baited breaths. Eventually, I mumbled out a phrase that twisted their faces:

‘It’s not poachers.’

‘Wh-What do you mean?’ Haley stammered, worry dripping from her gentle voice.

‘Its not poachers.’ I repeated. ‘We need to get out of here. Call in extract.’ I pleaded.

‘We just got here.’ James said, calmly.

‘Call. In. Extract.’ I demanded, heart palpitating in my chest. They stood frozen, glancing at each other.

Something inside of me snapped. I pushed through them and brandished my walkie, switching to the emergency channel.

‘This is the Luke from the Patagonia team, requesting urgent extract.’ I spoke our co-ordinates with a trembling voice. My friends muttered behind me in confused tones.

‘Why?’

‘What’s wrong?’

I didn’t respond, my grip on the walkie tightening until my knuckles turned white, pleading with HQ to read me.

My heart leapt as a voice responded through the static:

‘Copy. We’ll be with you in a few hours, hang in there.’

‘Tell us what’s going on!’ Haley called from behind me grasping my hand and turning me around.

‘There's something else out there.’ I whimpered softly. ‘I saw it in the book, the same one as the cameras.’

Their faces dropped, I could almost see their hearts sink.

‘Y-You mean… The campsite…’ Charles sputtered, pausing.

‘Yes. We need to leave.’

The next hours felt like years. We played blackjack, but I kept dropping the cards. We ate a lunch we could barely stomach, and whispered to each other. Night fell, and we started the fire back up, its warmth a seldom comfort against the ice-cold terror in my veins.

About 2 hours after I made the call, something brushed past the grass outside of camp.

My entire body went on alert, sweat beaded, and my hands trembled again.

Another brush. Behind us.

The others swivelled around on the spot, while I bolted and jumped into the footwell of the car, my light clicking as it switched off.

They called again, hooting loud enough to vibrate my very being. The low sound forced bile into my mouth.

I peeked into the trees and spotted an enormous movement just beyond the camp. I whisper-yelled to the others. James saw me and sprinted, scrambling below the other footwell, but Haley and Charles ran in opposite directions to their tents.

They circled us for minutes, communicating over and over. One bellowed in the low hoots from earlier, while the other responded in the sharper calls. We were hearing two of them the whole time.

The circling stopped, along with the calls. I remained still, trembling. The salt of tears washed over my lips.

The darkness was periodically split by the beams of light from flashlights. In the reflections, I saw movement in the centre of camp, stomps shifting the very earth beneath us.

I locked eyes with James, silently communicating. He nodded in agreement. If I was going to die here, I wanted to at least know what killed me.

I then made the stupidest decision of my life.

I crawled up, peeking over the dashboard, silent breaths shuddering, and flipped on the headlights. The sudden light poured onto the centre of camp, illuminating the creature in full.

Its neck bobbed and writhed at the sudden intrusion like a chicken, its head tilted suddenly towards me, and I locked my gaze into bright yellow eyes that reflected the light back at me. Its side and neck were covered in a mix of grey and brown filaments, creating a morbidly hypnotising pattern tainted with mud and dried blood.

It turned, rippling muscle raising its lengthy arms and spreading the clawed fingers I saw on the camera. Its bulky chest heaved as it turned on a dime to face me, legs masterfully twisting its body with unnatural agility, scraping horrendous claws and deep wounds in the ground.

Its thin, scaly snout, flanked by greyish brown filaments split in two, revealing a gaping maw that opened wider with every second and nostrils that flared in my direction. It seemed to stalk closer, every stomp louder than the last.

There was no doubt anymore. I was looking at a living, breathing Dinosaur.

I ducked, curling up into a ball as it suddenly dashed in my direction, letting loose a horrible mix of a snarl and a hiss.

The car toppled and rolled. The light died as the creature smashed into it. I held onto the seat for dear life. The car stopped upside down, and I clattered to the floor beneath it. Tears streamed down my face as I regained my bearings, lowering myself onto my stomach. I looked to my right.

James was gone.

My entire body tensed. I looked out onto the camp, and saw James hastily picking himself off the floor, scrambling for safety. I couldn’t do anything but watch. I couldn’t call out – it would hear me. A massive, scaly foot smashed to his left before the creature snapped him up at the waist. I heard his gargled screams as it chewed him alive, gore dripping onto the ground.

I closed my eyes and placed a hand to my mouth, mouthing, ‘James…’ over and over.

Stomps rushed past me, and I froze again, the second one ran out from behind the car.

This one was a full head smaller, more colourful. It ran around the camp, brushing into Haley's tent. I heard her yelp, and my eyes widened as it froze and whipped around.

Silence. It investigated the tent, sniffing loudly at the fabric. I couldn’t let her die like James.

Mustering all my courage, I smacked the bottom of the car.

Both creatures turned to face me, and I was met with two snouts, four front facing eyes, and outstretched claws.

They approached the car, and I equipped my knife. At the time, I thought I could do some damage if they did find me. I now realise how stupid I was.

The large one pushed the smaller one with its head, forcing it aside. It yelped in protest, before sulking out of view.

I felt its stare. It judged the noise.

It approached the car again, before slamming its claws into it and ripping through it. Metal screeched as it was torn from the car, and at a final heave, it tore the top off, chirping and clicking in victory.

Then, they turned to each other, before engaging in a twisted dance. The larger one bobbed its head up and down, with the smaller one responding in turn.

I closed my eyes and prayed. I spoke every deity’s name under the sun, every blessing, and prayed the rest of us could make it out safely, without tragedy.

I saw Haley peek out of the tent, her form obscured by shadow. I almost cried out for her to go back.

She caught sight of the creatures and ducked back in. They didn’t notice her.

I silently begged Extract to hurry. The creatures showed no signs of leaving.

They wandered, stepping around the tents and shoving their noses into the fire pit.

I almost passed out when one of them walked past the car, toes inches from my body.

I cried in silence, fear unlike any other coursing through me, hoping.

They cackled, clicking and whooping in monstrous laughter. I curled up further, clutching my knife to my chest, and stared out at them.

They had their necks craned to the sky, snouts pointing up, wobbling as they spoke.

Suddenly, their heads snapped to the left. Both silently watched the expanse of shadow, looking for something.

There was light meandering towards us.

I nearly sobbed with relief.

The creatures turned and sprinted back into the dark, stomps fading out into the night.

Headlights slowly Illuminated the campsite. I dragged myself from under the car, unsteadily rising to my feet, stumbling over as my legs failed to move.

A woman rushed over and crouched near me, speaking, but her voice didn’t register. Blood was still ringing in my ears, and I couldn’t do anything but look at the darkness ahead, searching for any movement in the gloom.

Next thing I know, I’m in the hospital.

Taken off guard, I glanced to my right, noticing Haley and Charles in beds next to me.

I searched frantically for James, eyeing every bed and curtain in the ward, but nothing.

James was gone.

Guilt hit me like a truck, and I almost passed out again. I almost believed I had dreamt the entire thing.

I tore a piece of tissue from the table next to my bed, took out a pen, and scrawled a message:

**Dinosaurs.**

 

I tapped Haley on the shoulder, who wordlessly turned to me, tired, heavy eyes staring into my soul. I handed her the note.

She read the word, and with the same expression, looked at me and nodded.

I resigned the following morning. They made me sign a waiver to shut the fuck up before letting me leave.

They know, and that makes me sick.

 

At the time of writing, it has been a week since that happened. The three of us attended James' funeral shortly after. Haley’s leg had a dark purple bruise spreading from a point where it had snapped, and Charles looked more tired than I’d ever seen him.

I read the news later that day – James was killed by a violent attack from poachers, warning people to stay away from the area until things ‘calmed down.’

We talked and agreed this shouldn’t be kept quiet – It’d be an insult to James. The people deserve to know.

My mind still flashes with its maw and teeth, its swiping claws and the sound of its cackle.

There are Dinosaurs out in the wild.

They were never gone.
