Seven had a…collection of sorts.

Imagine a picture book with your most precious memories and replace it with stolen consciousness.

That is what we were. 

On her tablet in a folder named “lol” — located on the Home Screen between the recycling bin, and the Google Chrome app, were… [us](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/149gqyv/when_i_was_sixteen_someone_was_editing_my_life/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). The us who existed before Smith, Nick, Bree, etc. 

It became obvious to me that just like me, Seven had grown up. They were no longer curious when editing my life, killing me, and bringing me back to life in progressively more brutal ways. When children play video games, they are completely innocent in the choices they make. Whether that is forcing their character to jump into shark-infested waters or making their simulated person complete a thousand laps around a pool before removing the ladder. It is innocent brutality. They want to push their characters past their pain endurance because it’s… fun. It’s fun to watch a pixelated person jump in front of a car or walk off of a cliff because there are no consequences.

She knew that forcing me to relive the exact same instances, like being gutted by my school counsellor, was wrong. However, that did not stop her from putting me through that nightmare over and over again. 

The “lol” folder wasn’t used for any other purpose than to torture us. Seven wasn’t an innocent kid playing a game. 

She was the psychopathic controller who had taken our real lives, the selves we had been before we became her playthings—and drew her own versions of them, replicating the realities we had lived and breathed as human beings, and combined them with her own fictional world. It was the perfect way to keep us trapped, to make us question our own reality while splinters of our real selves were forced into fiction. These memories existed in black and white, sketched-out drawings and outlines and nonsensical squiggles on a bright screen.

I likened them to the pages of a comic book because no matter how detailed they were, they were never finished. Of course, they were never finished. Seven liked to leave them half-finished to prove that these were nothing more than her own ideas, forgotten scribbles, and doodles she had come up with that never met the final cut. One storyboard of pages, or I guess memories, was always at the forefront of my mind.

These drawings of hers were her weapons, and her own personal, twisted torture.

One page in particular haunted me. Oblivion which stretched on for three full pages, just the night, and the stars, tiny shaded white dots, before movement. It came slowly at first. 

All I could see were pitch-dark splotches that looked so real I could… feel them. All at once, my senses were igniting and alive. Rain. Bitter and cold, running down the back of my neck and back, soaking my face when I looked up, ice cold drops clinging between my eyelashes as I struggled to blink them away, ducking my head to avoid the onslaught. Seven was an artist. With the way she drew the rain and its movements, its impact, and my emotions. I didn’t even exist yet. I was a single shadowy figure standing among this oblivion which no longer stretched out across the pages. 

Instead, streetlights were coming into view, intricately drawn close up, and then from another angle, as my face began to bleed into existence with every delicate stroke of her pen. Seven started to draw the world around me, a desolate street and a stray car moving past me in quick snapshots—the tail of a cat darting behind a trash can. I remembered that cat. 

I remembered she was a stray. I remembered running my hands through her fur and resisting the urge to pull her into my arms and take her with me. Seven knew my memories more than I did, taking time to insert every single detail. She drew the bag of Chinese food under my arm, and in a close-up panel, my wide eyes as I took in the dilapidated house in front of me. Once she was done with the background, Seven focused on me, and began to weave out the memory in manic scribbles. It was so…so cold. Sucking in breath between my teeth, I struggled to balance the Chinese takeout under my armpit..

The words came down on the page like raindrops sliding down a pane. I remembered my hands curling into a fist and slamming into old wood.

**KNOCK.**

**KNOCK.**

A single speech bubble appeared on the black page, while my voice came out in a whimper. “Dr. Caine, are you there?”  

This was when reality and fiction started to blur together, as memory quickly took over these endless scribbles of black and white attempting to replicate something I had lived through. 

I could feel the weight of the takeout under my arm and freezing cold raindrops gluing strands of my hair to my face. I regretted not pulling on a jacket before leaving. I was supposed to have a welcoming committee, two guards who would greet me on arrival and demand a password. But there was nothing. Silence. 

The nightmare which had haunted me since escaping was still fresh in my mind, though after battling with my own paranoia for months, I had let my guard down. I stopped jumping at every movement, at every knock on the door, refusing to trust strangers. I thought we were free. 

I thought we could live a normal life—and I hated myself for having that pathetic and naïve hope.  “Hey!” This time, my voice was louder, with far more exclamation in my tone. I reached into my pocket and pulled out a key, only for it to jam in the lock. With fresh panic twisting in my gut, the food slipped from my clammy hands, but I barely noticed. Grabbing the ornate handle, I tugged it in an attempt to open it, slamming the toe of my shoe into old, rotting wood.

Pressing my face against the door, I sucked in a breath that stung my chest. 

"Did you change the locks?" I managed to choke out. "Dr. Caine, it's me. I can't open the door." No reply. The windows of the house were dark, and when I took a step back, I was suddenly wary. I was wary enough for my instincts to kick in. I didn't have a weapon, but I did know basic self-defence. In the intense glow of my phone’s flashlight, I studied the door.  

When I peered into the keyhole, something was jammed inside. Like... putty.  It became increasingly obvious to me that we had visitors. Seven showed this in several different panels, detailing the lock, the windows, and the odd substance jamming the door. While my figure was reduced to an outline she couldn’t be bothered to draw, and the Chinese food spilled on the sidewalk. It took three kicks to break the door down, with my last kick knocking it off its hinges. The smell of my forgotten Chinese food curled in the back of my throat with a sour-like stink flooding my nose when I stepped over the threshold. It was supposed to be our solace. Home. I had no home of my own, so this place had been all I had. It was my familiarity.  

And just like that, it was gone.

Seven drew my facial expression staring into the endless dark trying to find those I had started to call my reluctant family--and finding nothing.

Instead, I was greeted by a hollow kind of darkness. The safety I had been promised, the warm glow of the hallway light, the smell of food from the kitchen, chatter from the lounge where the others were—it was all gone, replaced with an emptiness that swelled in my chest and twisted in my gut. 

The stink was akin to mold, but not quite. It buckled my legs, and I had to fight to stand up. Pressing my sleeve against my nose and mouth, I slammed my fist against the light switch-- and almost immediately, something cold, the curve of a gun barrel protruded into the back of my head. My first instinct was to disarm them, but that required actual skills I didn’t have. I was yet to finish my self-defense training, and this almost felt like karma for missing out on all those morning lessons. Seven’s depiction was far less detailed, settling for a black page with three ellipses.

Before…

Words.

They exploded onto the page in a manic dance, wriggling into the dark.

“State your name, or I blow your head off, kid.”

His chuckle startled me, and it showed in Seven’s sketched depiction, my eyes widening, my lips slowly forming an O.

“Ah, my mistake. I can’t blow your head off, can I?” The man took a step forward and made sure to protrude the barrel deeper into the bald flesh of my head.  I sensed his index on the trigger, the twitch in his wrist eager to pop a bullet in my skull. Seven was talented at drawing my emotions with just my eyes.  

The wrinkle in my brows and the curve in my lips were just enough to connote the terror paralyzing me to the spot. Next, she drew exactly what I, or her depiction of me, was thinking. The back of my head, and the bald patch I had been trying to hide. 

With horrific detail, she drew the perfect light which shone down on the horror show which was me. I could tell with the way she scribbled manically, her hand shaking with anticipation—this is what she wanted to draw all along. She wanted to draw me just how she saw me. 

The carnivorous hole drilled into my skull bleeding nonsensical static and shadings of brain matter, the tiny bulging bodies of insects; spiders, and maggots bleeding out. In Seven’s mind, all of us were rotting. We were inhuman. So, that is exactly how she drew us. In her eyes, we were nothing but rotting carcasses with the ability to be filled and remade and contorted into fiction, into her own personal wonderland. When Seven was finished showing the grotesque reality of my being in detailed shading, she drew my reaction.

Fuck.

The word scrawled across a single page of darkness. But the memory was stronger than her mocking portrayal. I could smell the stranger. The man smelled of antiseptic mixed with a strong lemony scent which gathered in my throat and nose, choking me. Sliding my hand into my pocket to grab the mask I had been instructed to wear at all times, my fingers had only managed to graze my jeans before I sensed the quick movement of the gun's safety being clicked off, and the barrel slamming further into the rugged skin of my scalp. Where it was the most sensitive. I had been growing my hair back for months now, and with the way he slid the barrel down the back of my head, his intention was to remind me exactly who I was. 

Instinctively, I raised my arms in surrender, just as the stranger spoke, his words appearing in blocky letters. 

"You must be one of Caine’s strays.” 

“I’m his student!”

The words exploded onto the page, mimicking the frightened hiss escaping my lips, as I scrambled to pull out my college ID. Not exactly convincing, but it was something. The girl looked nothing like me. 

But all she really needed was my facial structure and the color of my hair.  It was a lie—a pathetic lie-- and both of us knew that. 

Three of us, if I included Seven, who was taking time to perfect the man’s lips curling into a cruel smile. “Is that right?” The harsh curve of the gun barrel sliding up and down my spine in a tease came away, giving me momentary relief. “Well, in that case, you must be Atwood.” 

He paused, and I could sense exactly how Seven had illustrated his lips and the contortions of his face, stretching his grin into something monstrous and maniacal. The man was enjoying this. He was enjoying my buckling legs, my hands visibly shaking. So, he dug the gun into my head once again—and this time it was harsh enough to send me to my knees. Seven drew the movement of me falling, dropping to the ground, hands first. She even took the time to write out, “Oof!” coming from my mouth in a breath.

Faced down on carpet, I tried to lift my head to scan for the others, for Dr. Caine, before the man’s foot came down on my back, forcing me onto my stomach. He paused, and I could hear the laughter he was trying to suppress. The pure joy of finding us must have put him in a good mood. “Atwood,” he murmured. “Atwood, Atwood, Atwood…” His words appeared in bubbles around me, suffocating me, as well as the shadowy figure Seven depicted as me, entangled in her manic shadings. Compared to the real memory, she got most of it right. 

Every angle I had glimpsed was there in separate panels. The broken coffee table filled with cans of soda and comic books, sofa cushions and blankets, discarded clothes scattering the ground—and yet no sign of the others. Again, I tried to get back up. Only for him to stamp on my head, pinning me to the ground. “Also known as Subject 5E.” 

He lifted his foot, and instead kicked the ground, freezing me in place. I could tell Seven was exhilarated in the way she paid attention to every detail, every shoelace on his shoe, and the gap in his mangy teeth. “Tell me. How exactly did you escape, hm? And more importantly, why did you escape?” Seven made sure to emphasize the *why*, with bolded letters.

Already, she was sketching out exactly what my thoughts had been at that moment, dipping into the most precious parts of me to find material. She found them one by one, and each memory excited her further. Her trembling pen hit the tablet’s screen, and she drew four panels. In the first, she sketched out a small glass building situated in front of a giant stretch of land filled with trees. The next, was a wire fence, followed by automatic doors leading into long and winding stretches of hallways which didn’t end, collapsing into labyrinths of clinical white. Before she got creative. 

Instead of focusing on the waiting room or the desk, or shadows of patients and doctors bumbling around this bright white space which reminded me of my old life, or at least splinters of it left behind, she drew a single white room filled with a table, a chair, and a boy. The boy started as a simple blot of ink, before becoming more detailed as the perspective changed. 

The boy did not have a face. Or he did, but Seven chose not to draw it. Instead, she drew his head as a vast explosion of the first color inside her otherwise grey world. The explosion wasn’t orange, however. It was a gory kind of red, a gruesome smear scrawled into graphic swirls and squiggles completely blocking his identity. She drew blood, so much of it, pouring from him, down his face, and soaking the table in front of him, pooling in cracks on the floor. 

This boy was not a human being to her. 

He was an outline, a simple sketch of a torso with no face. There were two things on the table in front of him. A glass of water, and a gun. There was a piece of paper on the desk with the words, “Robbie Altrez”. While his identity was masked, Seven did not hesitate to draw the back of his head in the kind of detail I almost craved. It was enough for me to believe this thing she was drawing had actually existed. To her, though, he was a disgusting cavern filled with wires and tubes protruding directly into his brain.

That’s exactly what he was, a shell of a human being filled with wires.

“I mean, I’m sorry, but do you realize how *important* you are?” The man’s voice sliced into my thoughts, bringing me back to pain.

Another kick.

This time it was my gut. I was drawn curling into myself, burying my head into my knees as the stranger thrust the toe of his shoe again and again into my stomach.

“There are exactly twelve of you in existence, Atwood,” the man murmured. “All the others died. They failed, bleeding out on the operating table. We can’t make more of you.” Another kick. This time illustrated through an explosion of wild scribbles.

She drew exactly what I was thinking. Standing over the boy was a man in a white lab coat holding a clipboard. Seven took pleasure in drawing my reaction to the flash of memory, to what I was running away from. She drew my eyes squeezed shut, like I was a character with no real emotion, only the ones forced into me. 

In quick glimpses, simple sketches with not much detail, she drew the boy reaching out for the gun, and sticking it into his right temple. I screamed, and my scream was shown through my eyes that were squeezed shut, my head pressed into the carpet. Sobbing. The man continued, as the boy pulled the trigger. 

Click. His already non-existent face exploded into vivid swirls of black, his body slumping against the chair. It was almost breathtaking how much unnecessary detail was put into these flashes that suffocated my mind, forcing me deeper into the abyss. Dr. Caine had taken me away from that room, away from those wires, and that gun. He saved me. 

Seven knew this, her manic scribbles turning into our escape. Past the wire fence, and towering trees, my face buried in dirt to avoid gunshots, and the logo of a well-known games company bleeding into the distance as I ran further and further, blending into the dark.  

The stranger grasped the most sensitive part of my scalp, digging his fingernails into my flesh, and pulling me to my feet, as the memory continued in splashes of ink. I reached a road, a hummer and a man waiting outside. Drenched in shadow, he had no face, but I already trusted him. “We can’t even begin to copy this kind of miracle, and you try to run away from us?” 

He mocked a sob. “Atwood, how could you? After everything we have done. We gave you a miracle, and you run away with the traitor?” His lips grazed my ear, and Seven detailed it perfectly. The warmth of his tongue grazing across my ear, and then my neck, my body buckling, failing me. “Both of us know that you don’t belong here,” he hummed. “Both of us know that you only exist to sit in that fucking chair and—”

His words sucked into a hiss when I slammed the back of my head into his mouth.

“You have the wrong person!"

I managed to get away through pure adrenaline, twisting around and gunning for the door—and I was so close. My attempt was drawn in panels growing progressively bigger until all I could see were my hands reaching for the handle—and slipping away when I was dragged back, a cloth rag pressed over my mouth. I screamed, but the stranger ignored me, pulling me to the ground. When I turned my head, my thoughts spinning, I saw what was left of the only man left I could trust. Caine. 

Seven illustrated him as nothing but a blur of darkness behind the couch, a limp hand bleeding into the picture. She didn’t have to draw the others’ faces, or question where they were. I already knew fate followed was far more fucked up than Caine's. 

The stranger did not suffocate me. He did not kill me. Instead, he loomed over me with his boot pinning me to the ground. I waited for him to, but instead, the door opened, a shadow appearing. From my facial expression which Seven drew vividly, I knew who it was. 

She bled into the real world like a virus, something which should not belong, and yet she was real skin and flesh and bones. 

The woman in the grey suit advanced towards me slowly with no exoreison. In reality, she was less polished, with straying strands of hair in front of her face, and yet those same soulless eyes. She always took her time, always stride by stride to make me scream and cry and try and battle my way out of a nightmare I knew was never going to end. 

Reaching me, she knelt in front of my body, and wrapped her fingers around my ponytail like usual, entangling herself with me as I struggled to get away. Seven’s intricate strokes of her pen showed me lunging out and pulling off the button on her suit in an attempt to get away before the silver of the knife was shown in its own separate panel, followed then, by my wide eyes. The woman in the grey suit did not speak, only moving in jerking movements, before raising her knife above my head, and plunging it into my throat. It’s hard to draw agony in its purity. However, Seven managed it in scribbled metaphors.

THWOOOOSHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! 

Seven clearly enjoyed drawing the fountain of blood splurging from my neck, and then my choking breaths. She enjoyed writing my last words, which were just nonsensical garbage, and my attempts to beg for my life. She drew one single blank panel, followed by another, showing the woman in the grey suit picking me up and hoisting me over her shoulder. She even drew the stars in my eyes, stars I could see through my flickering lashes before they went out one by one, leaving me in darkness.

Oblivion.

Now, was that memory real? Seven liked it when she made me wonder. So much so that it drove me insane. When she drew all of these different scenarios of a past life, thousands of them, different possibilities of who I was. From an unlucky high schooler dragged off of the streets, to a broke twenty-year-old looking for any way to make cash. But this one was always far too detailed for me to ignore. As if my memories had not just been drawn, but intricately traced on purpose, to show me they were real. That I had existed as a living and breathing human being, and not a consciousness forced into a pixilated image. Seven started to be progressively more brutal. First, it had been senselessly killing me as a child. Now she was taking it one step further.  Taking my thoughts.

My ability to think for myself. 

Time did not exist inside the world she had contorted and twisted into my life. It could have been seconds, minutes, hours, or years since I was standing in front of Nick, who revealed he too was reliving the same night. Our junior prom—- and he too had been stalked and killed over and over again by the woman in the grey suit. Before my best friend had stabbed me in the stomach. And took me back. 

But how long had it been? How many times had I relived my junior prom? With the memory still in the back of my mind, I was back on my bike—- the last save point. The words “GAME OVER” once again faded from the backs of my eyelids. But something was different. Unlike the rest of the instances, this time it almost felt like I had been dragged back to self-awareness. Lifting my head, the first thing I was aware of was blood pooling from my nose, very real and wet and warm. Fireflies buzzed in my face. 

The late evening sun scorched my back, and a delicate breeze grazed my cheeks. 8 pm. My body moved for me, while my brain was still trying to register self-awareness. This time, it was different. 

The air in front of me was thick, phantom words I couldn’t make out caught in the folds of a sky filled with code. My body was aching, shivers racking up and down my spine. My mouth was… dry, a dull pain thrumming across the back of my head. 

I had never felt like this before. Before I could think my own thoughts, each past instance was violently slamming into me, hard enough to send me tumbling off of the handlebars. Gripping them for dear life, I managed to stay upright. I had to get back to Nick. That was my first thought. 

He knew something. Nick had lived through this night just like me and been a victim of the woman in the grey suit. I had to find him at prom and talk to him. But as that thought entered my mind, it retracted almost instantly, when splinters of memories from past instances I had not been self-aware of started to hit me.

Seven was clever. She realized I was awake. Which was bad. If I was awake, then her game couldn’t continue. So, she had taken away my free will. That’s what anyone would do to a video game character, right? Your characters suddenly become aware of what you are doing to them, and try to stop you? You take away their free thought so they are nothing but empty shells.

It was the perfect torture. 

Take away my thoughts, and then wake me up, hitting me with what I had missed, blaming me for the sudden change in the air and the eeriness swamping what had once been a relaxing night which now felt like the start of a horror movie. They didn’t stop, each one sucking breath from my lungs.

I was seeing the first, second, third, and fourth, fifth, sixth… seventh… eighth… ninth instances.

Tenth, eleventh, twelfth….

Thirteenth.

Fourteenth.

I could see my hands splattered in blood, intense red pooling between my palms, and all around me, glitching shadows and nonsensical words floating in the air. I saw myself standing on the stage. I was speaking. No, I was screaming, my eyes wide.

Fifteenth.

Sixteenth.

…

Oh god.

How many times had I been forced to relive this night… and what were the consequences of it?

Nineteenth.

It kept going. Through the thirties. Then the forties and fifties.

The sixties.

When I was plunged into the hundreds, I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t move, my body was moving for me.

This time, I did fall off the bike. I barely felt the impact of my bare knees skinning the ground. When I rolled onto my back to stare up at the sky, I was already back on the bike. Cycling towards school in my prom dress. In the one-hundred-and-fourth instance, my legs had been blood spattered. In the one-hundred-and-eighth, I didn’t have a face, nothing but a pixelated blur.

I was running for my life on the crumbling ground of my school, shadows next to me.

But every time, one of us fell, and the cruel blade of the woman in the grey suit’s knife cut through my spine, sending me tumbling.

Falling.

Over and over again.

Fucking falling.

Like falling down the page of a book, or a page.

It was endless.

It kept going.

And going.

I saw flashes of Nick’s horrified face which morphed into a twisted grin. I saw him standing on the edge of the stage, freshly crowned as prom king, his lips splattered with red. He was shouting something, screaming, his eyes wild. But his words were mute, deafened from my mind. 

In every instance after that, every repeat I was forced through, my best friend became progressively more unrecognizable. In his prom king crown, he resembled a kind of leader, who in the beginning attempted to take over and wake everyone up. But as I was murdered over and over again, and he was now fully aware of being killed, reliving the same night was slowly driving him crazy. I saw this in glimpses. 

His eyes, which had been hopeful and bright, ready to find a way out, morphed into twin pools of black, that could only be insanity. In the ninetieth instance, his head was completely gone, and yet his smile remained, floating in mid-air, stretched into a terrifying grin that spoke in gibberish, in bolded dialogue appearing in a flashing prompt box which I was not to supposed to see. But since things were wrong, since something had gone deeply wrong with Seven’s world, I was seeing things for what they were. 

I was seeing the video game we were trapped inside, forced to live. Seven knew this. She was forcing these memories onto me, it was another way of torture, warning me not to try to take control again. 

Eventually, I got a hold of myself and was low-key enough not to draw attention to myself. I cycled to the school gates as usual, but things were different. Instead of cars in the parking lot, was a single yellow school bus with its roof torn off. When I stepped inside, heading towards the gymnasium, phantom conversations and dialogue were popping up in front of my eyes instead of speech, my classmates passing me in a blur. There was no floor—or there was, but when I concentrated on it, a tile would appear and then disappear. 

The structure of the school itself was starting to fall apart, glitching classroom doors flashing in and out of existence. The only thing which seemed to be real, or real to an extent, were my classmates. Stepping over the threshold, I accidentally stamped on the body of a boy.

The boy didn’t move, his body glitching, blurring in and out of view.

“Ignore him.”

The voice startled me. When I twisted around, Robbie Altrez was standing with the decomposing head of a teacher in his hands like a football. Robbie’s grin widened. “He refused to wake up, Smith. He didn’t want to see reality for what it was.” Before I could answer, he was turning, and stepping inside one of the glitching classrooms, his body bleeding into the interior. “Catch ya later!” His manic laugh sent shivers down my spine. I could still see it very faintly printed inside a phantom prompt box. “See you for the one thousandth, eight hundredth, and sixth time!”

The speech of several girls was appearing in front of my eyes, but as I got closer to them, the words were becoming progressively more intelligible.

“Did you see what ®™<} [<] was wearing? Like OMG he l<[<€©] <like a tot&al hOttie.”

“Can you hold my ™®<€<] |÷>7w8ehwbsjs? Oh g%d, I think I’m going to barf!”

“My m$m is g*&^% to k*&^% me!”

A girl jumped in front of me with a grin stretching across her face. I didn’t remember her from past instances. But something told me Seven was no longer in control—or at least, she may have been in control of the world itself, but not its characters.

“Hey!”

She reached out her arm, which I noticed was flashing in and out of view, her phantom fingers wrapping around my elbow. The girl’s name was Lily, and her throat was slit open, a gunshot wound in the back of her head, revealing slithers of skull and brain. Despite that, she was still grinning, unblinking. Her eyes were unseeing, looking straight past me into nothing, into complete and total oblivion. This girl had lost her mind a long fucking time ago. “Are you coming to prom? We’re waiting!”

Before I could fully articulate an answer, she was dragging me down the hallway.

The same hallway I had died on multiple times. Thousands of times. Enough times to turn my classmates crazy. The gymnasium was definitely the catalyst for what had gone wrong. 

As I got closer, lockers disappeared from the hallway, and classmates walked into walls and each other, still moving and smiling. But there was also something so… human and yet terrifying as I stepped in front of doors which had been torn off, blood-spattered handprints and bodies sticking from the ground. “AWAKE” was scrawled on every wall, decapitated heads on sharpened hockey sticks. It was a blur of the game world and humanity who had woken up inside an illusion. My junior prom had become a massacre. Kids who had died or killed each other in past instances accompanied old versions of themselves which were decomposing flesh in pooling red. 

Take On Me was playing like every other time, but it was stuck, looping on the chorus. Stepping into the crowd of my friends, some of them were frozen, their expressions frozen in wide grins and wide smiles, while others were ignited to life, into the kind of madness I had never known. I didn't even think Seven knew how to draw that kind of unhinged insanity, feral and let loose.  

The prom was barely stable. I noticed the food I had been eating was nothing but stock image food photoshopped to look realistic. My dress was blood-stained, remnants glued to my flesh. No matter how many times the game tried to fix it, it couldn't. I was staring, wide-eyed at the stage in front of me, of the massacre of kids piling on the ground, textures on the walls becoming entangled code lit up in green. 

The room wouldn't stay still, jumping erratically around me. Where was Seven? I thought dizzily. Why wasn't she fixing this? As amazing as it felt to have a grip on myself and my thoughts, I was fully aware that my classmates were awake, and were being forced to relive this crazy shit with me. No wonder they were batshit insane.

"Smith!" His voice twisted my gut. I had seen glimpses of what Nick had become through splinters in my mind, but I wasn't ready for the real thing. My gaze flicked to the stage once a spotlight hit me in the face, and shielding my eyes, I saw them.

Our 2015 prom King and Queen.

Who had both been crowned one thousand, eight hundred and six times.

Bree, her shredded prom dress clinging to her. Bree's dress had been a white gown, now reduced to tufts of what had been white, dyed deep scarlet, her once strawberry blonde hair shaved off. Her crown still remained, delicately placed over her freshly bald head. 

Our prom Queen was sitting on her throne, laughing. Around her neck was a gory mess of intestines. The girl terrified me. When I focused on her, she popped up right in front of my face and cocked her head slowly, her laugh stretching off her face. "AWAKE." Her words appeared in front of me, twisting and contorting. “A&^AKE A&*^KE AW*(KE! AK&KE AW(*&!”

Awake.

The word was everywhere, almost like it had taken over Seven’s original program, forcing itself into every little detail of this little world.  "Smith! Hey, o®¥®™¥ here!" 

My best friend was perched on the edge of the stage, swinging his legs like a child. It reminded me of when we were kids. When he would sit on the edge of his pool, trailing his toes in cool water under the late evening sun. It was his freckles I saw first. 

They looked wrong, as if he had drawn them with a marker pen. Nicholas Highcliffe was such a fake name, like a character in a twisted mystery. And looking at the boy at that moment, I realized just like his name, he didn't look... real. Just like earlier, in the tenth instance, Nick didn't blend properly into the world, overlapping the textures, instead of him being a stable physical thing. He was our 2015 king, and somehow, something entirely else, a ruler, a leader to all these stray kids who had woken up and chosen to fall into insanity. 

Like Bree, he brandished a crown that was not his original one; instead, a crown of human bones, half of a crushed human skull still leaking its contents. Like a real king, he held his "trident" hockey stick, which had been sharpened in a spear. His dark brown nestled under the crown couldn't be called "hair" anymore. For one, it existed like its own separate thing, a nest of creepers on his head. When Nick caught my eye, his lips stretched into this unnatural grin that completely left his face. 

For a moment, I was paralyzed to the spot. I knew I could move. Seven was not in control. Her world was crumbling, and we had taken ourselves rightfully back. It's not that I couldn't move. It's that I didn't want to. I had known Nick since we were little. Since we were in diapers playing in my front yard. I hated that Seven had taken my self-awareness of these instances. 

It wasn't fair that she had left me behind, while my friends had gradually lost their minds. I was already taking steps back, stumbling over myself, and then into the refreshments table, which glitched before disappearing. Nick dived off of the stage, primed on his toes. I could tell he had done this before. He had started towards me with the exact same smile. 

Maybe initially, it had been innocent. Maybe he wanted to help at first. But over time, stolen time taken from me, my best friend's eyes had become hollow caverns failing to penetrate me. Before he could reach me, I found the doors, or at least the textures which looked like doors. All I could see were numbers, letters, and symbols tangled together screaming the word: "ERROR." 

When I made it back into the hallway, only just escaping Nick’s war-like shriek before the doors slammed in his face. The hallway itself was less glitchy. 

But when I started towards the door, I glimpsed April Lucas in the corner of my eye. Seven may not have had control over us, but the program was still working. April moved in almost twitching movements toward me. I was already twisting my head, and... there. There she was. The woman in the grey suit was just the program itself, entangled in this psycho narrative which could only move on if I was murdered-- and either sent back to 8pm or move forward if the so-called story. 

The woman didn't hesitate, her blank eyes finding me. When she lunged forwards, I turned and ran. But there was nowhere to run. It felt like I was running on clouds, on flooring which didn't make sense, towards a door that wasn't real. When I pulled open the doors of the school open, I found myself staring into endless, stretching darkness. Nothing beyond my feet except oblivion I didn't understand. 

Was it a way out? Was it an escape? 

Something possessed my body, willing me to step directly into the void. I felt it like a yearning, an indescribable pleasure, to throw myself into that darkness, even if it was nothing, even if I had no aware self or body. It was better than this. Better than this hell. Before I could, a warm hand was wrapping around my elbow, yanking me back into the light. I stumbled, throwing out my fists in an attack, only to find myself face to face with... 

Nick. Who… wasn't crazy? 

No, that wasn't it.

This Nick wasn't the Nick from prom. He was a different version from several hours earlier. 

The stain on his white tee, and his shorts he'd spilled coffee all over. Nick was out of breath, but he looked... sane. Before I could coerce words, he was shoving me against the wall, pressing himself against it. I saw the flash of the woman in the grey suit's ponytail. "Nick," I whispered when she was gone, stalking down the hallway. "How..?" 

"How?!" My best friend surprised me by slapping me across the face-- not enough to hurt, but enough to snap me into fruition. I blinked rapidly. He grabbed my shoulders, shaking me. "Are you fucking crazy?" His voice morphed into a sharp cry. "What were you thinking?"

"What?" 

Nick curled his lip. "You." He spat. "On the eleventh instance, you told everyone they weren't real, and woke them up. Seven put you on auto-play while the rest of us suffered." He gestured to himself. "I lost my fuckin' mind sometime between the ninetieth and hundredth loop, so she deleted me." Nick held out his arm, which again, was overlapping with the colors I was seeing. "I got corrupted, so a past version of me was inserted." He stepped back when I reached out to touch his face.  

"It's probably best if you don't touch me. I'm not stable. I could blink out of existence." His expression twisted. “Never mind that,” Nick’s eyes bored into mine. “You need to be honest with me, okay? Or we’re never going to fucking get out of here.”

“What is it?”

Nick hissed out a breath. “You need to tell me.” He whispered. “Who is the main character? That’s who controls this world, right?”

“I am.”

I said it with no hesitation. It made sense, right? I had to be the main character. 

That’s why I was awake.

But to my surprise, he was shaking his head. “I’ve been hunted down by our psycho guidance counsellor since I was fourteen years old. It has to be me.” Nick didn’t look confident. He wrapped his arms around himself, chewing his lip. “Right?”

I nodded. "So have I. She's been killing me every time I leave prom." 

His eyes widened. "Wait, what?" 

I opened my mouth to respond before his eyes were widening, his lips mouthing my name. “Smith!”

I didn’t have to turn around. I could already feel her cold fingers around my neck, and the teeth of her blade slicing into my back.

I didn’t die slowly this time. It was fast.

But this time I didn’t die alone. Through flickering eyes, I could see Seven once again. She was in her room, her tablet pressed to her lap, light pink fingernails wrapped around her tablet pen. A white room, and a shadow of a boy with no facial features slamming his hands into the door, his mute cry inside a speech bubble. A girl rocking backward and forwards, her head buried in her lap. A door. Two guards on either side. Inside that room was me. I sat on the edge of a bed, holding a gun to my head, colorful wires attached to my skull. 

The man with the clipboard stood over me, and a piece of paper revealing the words, **“Smith. (NPC.)”** in blocky letters. This time I could hear her giggling, as she perfectly traced this particular memory, taking time to intricately draw the lack of emotion on my face. Before both myself, and her scribbled drawing of me pulled the trigger, blowing my brains out.

…

Yeesh, that’s enough for now. Once again, I escaped this experience and this is an account. Back soon with an update.
