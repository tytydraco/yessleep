A truck pulled into my driveway, it was rundown, rusted and squealed as it grinded to a halt outside my home. I watched through my window in interest as a thin whip of a man and his pudgy little sidekick opened the back of the truck. The steel on steel created a sharp screech that pierced my ears and made me wince. The two men climbed into the back of the truck, I heard them yelling orders at each other from the interior, seeming more hurried than aggressive.

  “No, no quickly, over there. You gotta tie that one down, it’s fragile!”

  My house is the only on the street that isn’t abandoned, so I knew whatever was in there was for me or perhaps an order for my late father he placed before he passed. Either way, I waited in nervous anticipation for whatever the hell these two men were pulling from their truck. 



Finally after a gruelling ten minutes the men reammerged, the short fellow dropped to the road first, landing not so gracefully on the heels of his work boots and nearly toppling forward. The lanky man came out more gracefully, he had a trolley stacked with five boxes that he carefully and slowly rolled out. Even with his grace the wheels clattered to the paved road.

  “Fucking hell Topher, be careful!” The short one bellowed.

As they began towards my house I decided to meet them halfway up my driveway.



“Hello ma’am, my name is Topher and this lovely chap is my partner Humphrey.” He spoke with a certain elegance, like he was trying to serve me at a fancier restaurant and upcharge me for the wagyu. “We got your packages, straight from Whisk-Field Labs, kept private and confidential as you requested!”

  I looked down at the boxes, each was labelled, “DR KEN SONG’S EYES ONLY,” my father’s name.

  I raised my hands, “I can’t accept these, sorry, you’ll have to take them back.”

The two gentlemen looked at each other before looking back at me, Humphrey removed his cap and scratched his balding head, “But miss, we were told to take it right here, no exceptions, today.” He looked nervous and before I had a chance to speak he quickly added, “C-can’t we just leave them here?”



Topher slapped the back of Humphrey’s head, causing him to stumble forward a bit, “It’s no problem, we’ll make a call and get this sorted. May we remain parked over yonder while we take the call?”

  I nodded, he tipped his hat and they brought the boxes back to the truck but didn’t reload them. Topher drew an old flip phone from his pocket and immediately began dialing.



I was never permitted to accept my father’s packages, he always demanded I send them away until he got home. He worked for the government, a head scientist in a research division revolving around some medical field. I never was told the details, I wasn’t allowed to know. I only ever caught glimpses of what he brought home, chrome tools that looked like futuristic chainsaws, welding irons and other very non-medical equipment. Whenever he slipped up and I saw he would loudly and aggressively demand I keep my mouth shut about it. Even slapping me on a couple occasions to keep me in line, though I never dared slip out of it.

He would tell me if he ever died I wasn’t allowed in his study, I was to keep sending packages away and I would never sell the home. “Just let it rot,” he would say, “nobody is allowed to see.”

  Last month he died in an accident at work, all I was told is it involved a heavy vacuum sealed location and a pressure change. Googling those words I found out about the Byford Dolphin accident and that’s all I needed to know. This was the first package that arrived since his death and even after he was gone, I dare not go against his words.



After a few more minutes I went back inside and began making myself a coffee. Dad’s locked study felt darker than usual, like there was some kind of thing living behind it. A test subject for my father’s experiments or a creature from another world, waiting for the door’s to slide open and let it out. Though deep down I knew it was just strange tools and paperwork stamped with government seals, though whatever was written on those documents would probably be just as scary as a strange beast.

  My phone began to buzz in my pocket, I pulled it out and saw a private number. Slowly I pulled it to my face, “Hello, Kim speaking.”



“Afternoon Kim,” my Dad’s voice spoke. I immediately dropped my mobile to the floor and it landed with a clatter, skidding under a cupboard. I knew it was him, he only ever called from private lines and I had been mourning his tone of voice since I learnt he died. 

  After the shock wore off I quickly skid across the floor on my knees and fetched the phone, the call still running, “Dad?! Dad is that? How? What?” Tears streamed down my cheeks and pooled at my knees.

  “Are you done?” He responded bluntly, “It doesn’t matter how I’m calling, but I am. Bring the boxes inside, leave them in my study, but don’t linger. Goodbye Kim.” Then nothing as the call ended. I stared down at my phone, the now blank screen stared back, my father gone again as quick as he returned.



I dragged myself to my feet and looked towards the front door. I slowly shuffled over, snot pouring from my nose that I fruitlessly cleaned with my sleeve. As I cracked the seal to the outside world the two men were already waiting, the boxes right in my face.

  “We know where to go ma’am, Ken informed us,” Topher said softly, “I’m sorry for your loss.” 

  My heart thundered in my chest, none of this made sense. How were they informed? How did my Dad call? Being in total shock I stepped out of the way and watched them enter my home without a word. As they got close to the study I realised they didn’t have a key and neither did I, “G-guys, those are locked!” I squeaked out. 

  Humphrey turned and smiled at me, withdrawing a small silver key from his pocket, “Not a problem, miss!” As the key slid into the lock I winced and my cheeks stung as if they were just struck. The two men pushed the boxes into the study, vanishing into the inky blackness of the forbidden space. After a small argument between the two they exited, tipping their heads towards me.

  “Everything will get better soon ma’am,” Topher kindly offered, “I promise.” The two men waved me goodbye and left my house. I turned back towards the study and the doors were left open, the darkness lashing out like tendrils, luring me in.



I walked up and grabbed the two doors, ready to yank them shut but I couldn’t help and quickly scan the space. As expected it was mostly just paperwork on desks, filing cabinets and books lining shelves. Strangely none of the chrome tools were to be seen, potentially already removed. As my intrigue took hold I stepped forward, my foot colliding with a trash can, it rolled and bumped the side of the box stack. The highest box must have been heaviest as the entire tower came crashing down. They all landed with a sickening wet thud and slid along the floor. Instinctively I reached down to stack them back up but as I grabbed a smaller box the flaps peeled open and a red shape fell out, plopping to the floor leaving a small brown stain. A human heart.

  I watched in horror as the organ began to writhe and beat, spurting translucent red tinged blood over the ground. I turned away and ran to the bathroom, cramming my head into the toilet and vomiting a thick stream of acidic bile into the water. 



As I lurched out the remainder of my lunch I yanked my phone from my pocket and began to dial 911. I stared in horror, watching towards the bathroom door frame, expecting something or someone to walk in to stop me.

  When I finally connected, I explained that two men who worked for my Dad dropped off boxes of harvested organs. I screamed into the phone, begging for help. The lady on the other end was confused but trying to help, “Just stay on the line and try to breathe.”

  I went to respond and ask how long the cops would be but something awful yanked me from my panic. My Dad’s voice echoed through the house.

  “You shouldn’t have done that…”



I rose to my feet, my phone sliding from my grasp and cracking on the tiles, “Dad?” I called out, to no response. I slowly made my way through my house, the shadows of the setting sun causing everything to feel foggy and the hallways longer, “Dad? Dad, was that you?” Once again nobody called back.



I turned the final corner and the forbidden room came into view. The boxes had been opened. I saw body parts and organs strewn about, fingers, a shredded arm, an eyeball. As I got closer I locked eyes with him.

  My father piecing himself back together.
