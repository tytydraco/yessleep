breaking news today that a family home was burned down and broken into several bodies were found killed and missing their organs and their oldest went missing after the break-in and murder. No new trance for the killer or the boy. We will keep you updated on this case. 

It was a sunny day, the birds were out, and the world smelled nice, when my sister was alive it would have smelled great but after her death living in this toxic environment of a home. Jay just stared blankly out the window to the world. A black long hair boy, with freckles that anyone would love, some neck scar, and a scar on his nose. He was always a strange kid, had no friends, was always bullied get picked on by anyone even his own family calling him names, pushing, hitting him, and more. When he was little his father gave him a head injury and left those nasty scars on him. He left afterward. 

After his baby brother was born, no one paid attention to him he was like forgotten like his sister's death. Even his "dad" came back. Hey, lil brat yelled Axel mom said it's time for school you dumb weirdo... I always hated him he wasn't a good little brother he was worse than the others. I'm coming just getting my stuff. Finally, you lazy brat looking out that dumb window all day... I hated them. 

Ugh, school I always hate it here but today was different and maybe my crush Ace will notice me... Hey, it four eye freak everyone! Hey Jamie, can you give back my sketchbook? Ooo you mean this one. rip oops look my hand slip freak. With my anger held back for a year from all my family finally came out like a flame. I grab by the neck and slammed him to the locker and told him to give me back my book or else. 

He fought back and throw me back with my sketchbook saying "You weirdo don't have any friends, you should just fucking end it all there and here" he was right I don't mind I looked way he was ready to throw his powerful punch until everything stop and saw someone standing in front of me... 

"Hey, really Jamie fighting in school. Ugh, you never listen to this why we broke up." well I'm not bi like you weirdo, fuck you and leave us alone. Sure seen yea gay weirdos. "

"Hey my name is Tray, don't mind Jamie he's just a lil bitch since his girlfriend dumped him after she found out he was dating me hehe" Hi name the name Jay, after that day my life got somewhat better, I and tray always hang out, we talk about our problem mostly my and had a great life together. Until that faithful dread day... 

Found out that one of the girls said "Did you hear that weirdo friend Tray was just playing with him to get secrets from him and that Jamie planned this" I was baffled that Tray would do this angrier the flame got higher and hotter. So he texted me to meet him up on the school roof. So I went up and saw him standing there in the rain. He was saying "I'm sorry Jay, I didn't mean to lead like this, ik Jamie plan me to befriend you but in the end, I care since how close we go-" I wasn't listening to a word he said the anger inside me bolded up like a hot pot on a stove really to burst. The voice got louder, the heart beat fast then everything went black.... 

Police sound coming closer. Break news a boy with brown hair identified by a tray has fallen off the roof of the school by one of his classmates Jay. Right now taking the young teen to the mental hospital. More news at 5:00. 

They didn't let me say my part of the story right when I pushed him. I snapped back and got his hand. I told him "I'm sorry I won't let go" but he said I forgive you but he decided to let go and everyone blamed me, like always. It was all over the news of the accident. 

"So Jay you have been doing alright besides your new look by your cut on your arms/face and ear are you sure you Oki" Y-yes sir I'm Oki "You don't have to be so serious you can call me Joey" Oki Joey... "Let get to the chase ik it's not your fault for the accident but we don't have much proof of the accident so we won't be let you go out for a long time I'm sorry" ... Oki SIR!

I can't believe it... Jay, he did it. I don't want to, but it's too hard to face the fact. I've been getting notes saying "The monster from the cold is hungry, the hunger can't contain it forever hehe," along with a picture of Ace the night before the break-in while he was sleeping. The picture had dark red paint that I thought depicted a horrifying creature, saying "Father of the cold and hunger. I don't feel safe in my own home. It has gotten really cold, and I've been seeing things move with red drops. I'm not alone. If anyone finds this or reads this, please be careful and lock your doors. 

Joey and :D hehe
