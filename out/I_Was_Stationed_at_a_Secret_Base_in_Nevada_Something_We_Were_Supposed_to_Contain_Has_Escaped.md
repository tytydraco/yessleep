Full Audio Narration: [https://youtu.be/39C8xAaqRUU](https://youtu.be/39C8xAaqRUU)



I stepped off the bus into Nevada heat that punched through my uniform. The driver tossed my duffel beside me and pulled away, leaving a cloud of dust that settled on my polished boots. Behind a chain-link fence topped with razor wire stood Bravo Mike—seven squat buildings arranged in a horseshoe around a central courtyard. Nothing special. Nothing that screamed classified.



A corporal met me at the gate. "Wilson? Follow me."



The processing took less than an hour. I signed forms without reading them, got assigned quarters, and received my shift schedule. No welcome speech, no tour. Just paperwork and a set of keys. The corporal pointed me toward the barracks and walked away. So much for orientation.



My room was standard military—twin bed, metal desk, small closet. The window faced west, showing nothing but desert and distant mountains. I unpacked my few personal items, made my bed to regulation corners, and sat down to write my mother. Halfway through the letter, I realized I couldn't tell her anything about where I was or what I'd be doing. I ended up with three paragraphs about the weather and a promise to call when I could.



That night, I reported for my first shift. The operations center sat in the middle of the base—a windowless concrete box with a single reinforced door. Inside, screens lined the walls showing radar sweeps, atmospheric readings, and satellite imagery. Eight workstations faced the screens, each with its own computer setup and uncomfortable chair.



"Wilson," a voice called from behind me. "Station four is yours."



I turned to see a woman about my age with auburn hair pulled tight into a regulation bun. She held a clipboard and looked me over without smiling.



"Thanks. And you are?"



"Bane. Natalie Bane. I'm on your rotation." She handed me a thick binder. "Standard operating procedures. Memorize it by tomorrow."



I took the binder. "What exactly are we monitoring?"



Her expression didn't change. "Atmospheric disturbances."



"What kind of—"



"Just read the manual, Wilson." She walked away, posture straight as a ruler.



The night crawled by. I watched numbers change on screens, logged readings every thirty minutes, and fought to stay awake. Nothing in my training had prepared me for the pure tedium of Bravo Mike. By morning, I'd read the entire manual and still had no clear idea what we were looking for.



Three days later, I was eating alone in the mess when Bane sat across from me, dropping her tray with a clatter.



"Wilson," she said, fork already stabbing at something pretending to be meatloaf.



"Bane."



We ate in silence for a few minutes. The mess hall hummed with low conversations, metal scraping against trays, the kitchen staff yelling orders.



"Did you figure it out yet?" she finally asked.



"Figure what out?"



She leaned forward. "What we're actually doing here."



I shook my head. "Atmospheric monitoring seems pretty straightforward."



She snorted. "Right. And they need a hundred personnel and triple-layer security for that."



I glanced around, lowering my voice. "You think there's something else?"



"I know there is." She took a bite, chewed, swallowed. "Whatever we're watching for, it's not just weather."



Before I could respond, the mess hall door swung open and Sergeant Thomas Cooper walked in. The room went quiet. Cooper was tall with the kind of military bearing that made you want to stand at attention even in the shower. His eyes swept the room once, paused briefly on our table, then moved on. The conversations slowly resumed, but quieter than before.



"That's our fearless leader," Natalie said, not looking up from her food. "Sergeant Cooper. Man of mystery and zero explanations."



"You've worked with him before?"



"Six months. Never heard him say more than twenty words at a time." She pushed her tray away. "Just follow orders, Wilson. That's all anyone does here."



Weeks passed. The desert winter brought cold nights and clear skies. I settled into the rhythm of Bravo Mike—eat, work, sleep, repeat. The tedium became comfortable. I got to know the others on my shift rotation. Martinez always brought homemade jerky. Chen could solve crosswords in ten minutes flat. Rogers kept a picture of his kids hidden under his keyboard.



And then there was Natalie. We got paired on night shifts often, midnight to eight, when the base slept and the screens glowed in the dark. She relaxed around three a.m., when the coffee kicked in and fatigue lowered defenses. We talked about home, about training, about the food in the mess hall. Never about what we were monitoring.



"I'm from Michigan," she told me one night, feet propped on her desk. "Little town on Lake Huron you never heard of."



"Try me."



"Harrisville."



I laughed. "My grandparents had a cabin in Greenbush. We went up every summer."



Her eyes lit up. "No way. Small world."



After that, night shifts felt less like duty and more like time with a friend. We developed a shorthand for the boring parts of the job. She'd catch me nodding off and flick paper clips at my head. I'd bring extra coffee when she looked tired. Small things. Normal things in an abnormal place.



Cooper rarely visited during night shifts. When he did, it was just to check logs and leave. No small talk, no interest in his personnel beyond their function. I heard stories from others—how he'd dress down anyone who asked too many questions, how he kept his own quarters separate from everyone else's, how no one had ever seen him laugh.



"Blind obedience," Natalie whispered one night after he left. "That's his motto."



I shrugged. "He's military."



"There's military, and then there's whatever Cooper is."



January slipped into February. Nothing changed in the rhythm of Bravo Mike except the temperature outside. I'd been there long enough to stop counting days. Long enough that most nights I could do my job on autopilot, logging readings without really seeing them. Long enough that Natalie started bringing extra granola bars because she noticed I always got hungry around four.



On February 18th, I showed up for midnight shift as usual. Chen was finishing his rotation, eyes bloodshot from eight hours of screen time.



"All quiet," he said, standing up from station four. "Enjoy the boredom."



I settled in, logging my start time. Natalie arrived five minutes later, coffee already in hand.



"Extra shot of espresso tonight," she said, taking her seat at station six. "Had a feeling we might need it."



I didn't ask why. Some nights she just had hunches.



The first four hours passed like any other shift. We monitored, we logged, we talked about nothing important. At 4:17 a.m., the door opened. Cooper walked in, looking exactly as he always did—pressed uniform, perfect posture, expression carved from stone. But something was different. It took me a second to realize he was carrying a sealed manila envelope.



He walked straight to my station. "Wilson."



I sat up straighter. "Yes, Sergeant?"



"You have new orders." He placed the envelope on my desk. "Read them, memorize them, then destroy them. You have five minutes."



He stepped back, watching me. I felt Natalie's eyes on me too, but didn't look her way. The envelope had no markings except a red stamp reading "CLASSIFIED" across the seal. I broke it open and pulled out a single sheet of paper.



The orders were simple but made no sense. I was to proceed to Building C, Room 217, and wait for further instruction. I was not to discuss these orders with anyone. I was not to deviate from the prescribed route. I was to bring no electronic devices.



I memorized the instructions, then handed the paper back to Cooper. He took a lighter from his pocket and burned it, letting the ashes fall into a trash can.



"Report to Building C now," he said. "Bane, you're coming too."



Natalie looked up, surprised. "Me, Sergeant?"



"Different assignment, same destination. Move out."



We followed Cooper out of the operations center into the cold desert night. Stars filled the sky, so many they seemed to crowd each other out. Our breath made clouds in front of us as we walked across the courtyard toward Building C—the one structure at Bravo Mike I'd never entered.



Cooper unlocked a series of doors, each requiring different keys and codes. The deeper we went, the heavier the doors became. The final door was steel, at least six inches thick, with no handle on our side. Cooper entered a code, placed his palm on a scanner, and stepped back as the door slid open.



"Inside," he said.



The room beyond was small and spartanly furnished—a few chairs arranged in a line facing a reinforced window that took up most of one wall. The window looked out on nothing but darkness. Four other airmen were already seated, staring straight ahead. I recognized Martinez and Rogers from our shift rotation. The other two were from different rotations—Peterson and Chang, I thought.



Natalie took a seat, and I sat beside her. Cooper remained by the door, checking his watch.



"You are here to observe only," he said, his voice flatter than usual. "What happens outside that window is classified Level Eight. You will not discuss it with anyone, not even each other, after you leave this room. Is that clear?"



Six voices answered as one: "Yes, Sergeant."



Cooper nodded once. "ETA three minutes."



No one spoke after that. I glanced at Natalie, but her focus was on the window. Outside, I could now make out a perimeter road running along the base fence line. Floodlights activated suddenly, illuminating the area in harsh white light. In the distance, dust plumes rose from the desert floor.



A convoy of vehicles appeared, racing toward the base at high speed. Five vehicles—three armored personnel carriers sandwiching two heavy transport trucks. They swerved occasionally, as if avoiding obstacles, but maintained their heading toward the base.



Behind them, at first just a dark mass against the horizon, something moved. Something big. As it neared the floodlights' range, I caught glimpses of shape—impossibly tall, with multiple limbs that seemed to both walk and flow across the desert floor. It moved with fluid grace despite its size, closing the gap on the convoy with each stride.



My mouth went dry. Beside me, Natalie's breathing quickened. I felt her hand find mine in the darkness, gripping tight.



The door behind us opened. Cooper stepped back in, his face drained of color. He looked at each of us in turn, then at the window where the creature was now clearly visible—a nightmare fifty feet tall, with jointed legs like a spider's and a mockery of a human face stretched across what might have been a head.



"You are to watch only," he said, his voice hollow. "Under no circumstances are you to interfere or attempt to engage the entity. This is a direct order."



The sirens started wailing mid-sentence, cutting through Cooper's order with a sound like steel being tortured. I jolted in my chair. Everyone did. The floodlights outside flickered twice, then blazed even brighter, painting harsh shadows across the desert.



Cooper's radio crackled. He pulled it from his belt, listened for three seconds, then slammed it back into place.



"Stay here," he barked, and was gone through the door before anyone could respond.



I turned back to the window. The convoy had reached the outer fence, the lead vehicle smashing through the gate in a shower of chain-link and concrete. Behind them, the thing—Goliath, I heard someone whisper—moved with a grace that defied its bulk. Its limbs bent at impossible angles, covering ground in loping strides that ate up the distance between it and the perimeter wall.



"Jesus," Martinez breathed next to me. "It has to be thirty feet tall."



It was bigger than that. Much bigger.



Natalie's fingers dug into my sleeve, but I couldn't look away from the window to check on her. The creature moved like nothing I'd ever seen—not running exactly, but flowing, each limb finding perfect placement despite its speed. It reached the perimeter wall just as the last convoy vehicle cleared the inner gate.



Personnel scattered across the compound. Some ran for cover. Others moved with purpose toward defensive positions I hadn't known existed. Mounted guns emerged from hidden emplacements along the wall. Soldiers poured from barracks buildings in various states of dress, grabbing weapons from an armory truck that had appeared in the center of the base.



Goliath hit the wall and didn't slow. Its front limbs—too many, I couldn't count them—latched onto the concrete. The thing's body twisted, and it went up and over the thirty-foot barrier like a spider scaling a bathroom tile. No hesitation. No effort.



Something caught in my throat.



"They can't stop it," Chang said from the end of the row. "Nothing could stop that."



A single shot cracked through the night. Then another. Then a barrage as panic spread through the ranks outside. The guards on the wall opened fire against orders, their discipline crumbling in the face of the impossible. Tracer rounds cut bright paths through the darkness, passing through the creature's body as if through smoke. It didn't flinch. Didn't even seem to notice.



Once inside the wall, Goliath moved with terrible purpose. It surged toward the nearest cluster of soldiers, limbs extended. I couldn't see clearly what happened next—just bodies flying, blood spraying in patterns too perfect to be real. Screams reached us even through the reinforced glass.



"We have to help," I said, half-rising. No one moved with me.



"Orders," Rogers muttered, though he looked sick.



Outside, Cooper appeared from a side door, running toward a group of soldiers who'd formed a defensive line. He grabbed a radio from one of them, shouting orders we couldn't hear. More personnel emerged from buildings, taking up positions, creating a corridor through which the convoy could pass.



The trucks and APCs made straight for the largest structure on base—a hangar I'd only ever seen from the outside. Doors three stories high began to slide open, revealing darkness within.



Goliath paused, its head-like upper section swiveling toward the hangar. It changed direction instantly, abandoning a group of soldiers it had been cutting through. It moved toward the convoy with new urgency.



Cooper saw it coming. He directed soldiers to fall back, waving them toward secondary positions. Too slow. Far too slow. Goliath covered the distance in seconds, looming over Cooper and the men around him. For a heartbeat, nothing happened. Cooper stood his ground, sidearm raised in a gesture that seemed almost comical given the scale of the threat.



The creature's limb lashed out faster than I could track. Cooper disappeared in its grip, lifted high above the ground. For a terrible moment I could see him struggling, a tiny figure against the night sky.



Then he came apart.



There's no other way to say it. His body separated into pieces, and those pieces fell like rain onto the men below. The blood looked black under the floodlights. A sound escaped Natalie beside me—not quite a scream, something smaller and more broken.



I found myself on my feet without remembering standing. My palm pressed against the glass, useless. Natalie's nails dug into my other arm, breaking skin. I barely felt it. Outside, soldiers died by the dozens. Some shot themselves rather than be taken by the creature. Others ran blindly, only to be snatched up and torn apart.



The convoy reached the hangar. The middle truck backed in first, followed by the others. Soldiers swarmed around them, unloading something long and cylindrical from the lead vehicle. It took eight men to carry it, moving with urgent care toward the depths of the hangar. Whatever it was, they treated it like it might shatter—or explode.



Once it disappeared inside, the hangar doors began to close. Goliath froze in place. Its limbs retracted slightly, drawing close to its body. The misshapen head turned, scanning the compound with a deliberate motion that somehow conveyed intelligence.



Then, with the same fluid motion it had approached with, it retreated. It scaled the wall again, dropping to the other side, and moved back into the desert darkness from which it had emerged. Within seconds, it was just a silhouette against the stars. Then nothing at all.



The silence that followed seemed heavier than the chaos before it. On base, survivors stumbled between bodies. Medics appeared with stretchers that quickly ran out. The wounded screamed for help that couldn't come fast enough. The dead stared upward, their faces masks of terror frozen in place.



No one in our viewing room spoke. What was there to say? We'd watched dozens of our fellow airmen die in ways that defied understanding. We'd seen our commanding officer torn to pieces. We'd witnessed something impossible.



We sat there until the first gray light of dawn crept over the eastern mountains. No one came to dismiss us or give new orders. The six of us stayed, shoulder to shoulder, afraid to be the first to move, afraid to break whatever fragile thing was keeping us sane.



The blood on my arm dried where Natalie's nails had dug in. I didn't wipe it away. It was the only thing that felt real.



I woke to a fist pounding on my door. Didn't remember falling asleep. My clothes felt glued to my skin, stiff with dried sweat. The clock read 09:17.



"Wilson! Open up!"



Military police. Two of them filled my doorway in combat gear with sidearms unholstered. Behind them stood a man in a dark suit who looked like he'd stepped out of a government pamphlet—crew cut, blank expression, unremarkable in every way that screamed federal agent.



"Come with us," the taller MP said.



I didn't ask questions. Didn't even change clothes. The base looked wrong in daylight—bloodstains on concrete, bullet casings scattered like seeds, body bags lined up outside the infirmary. Twenty-seven of them. I counted twice.



They led me to the admin building and into a windowless room with a metal table bolted to the floor. The suit followed, closing the door with a click that echoed like a gunshot.



"James Wilson," he said, not a question. "I'm Agent Reed. You're going to tell me everything you saw."



The questions went on for hours. Each answer recorded, timestamped, filed away. I told him about the convoy, the creature, Cooper. My throat went dry. They didn't offer water.



"Did the entity communicate with anyone?" Reed asked.



"No."



"Did you observe any weaknesses?"



"Bullets passed through it."



"Were there any unusual smells, sounds, or atmospheric disturbances?"



I remembered the stillness before it appeared. "No."



More questions. Same ones rephrased. Reed checking my face for lies I wasn't telling. Eventually he slid papers across the table—pages of legal text with red tabs marking signature lines.



"Standard non-disclosure agreement," he said.



Nothing standard about it. Phrases jumped out like warnings: "lifetime obligation," "matters of national security," "prosecution for treason," "minimum penalty."



"What happens if I don't sign?"



Reed didn't blink. "Prison. For a very long time."



I signed.



They released me at sunset. I stumbled back to my quarters past clean-up crews hosing blood into drains. No sign of the bodies. No sign anything had happened except for sections of missing wall and bullet holes in concrete.



My room had been searched. Drawers left open, bed stripped, personal items moved. I collapsed anyway, too empty to care.



At 06:00 the next morning, transfer orders arrived—Osan Air Base, South Korea. Effective immediately. A corporal I'd never seen before handed me the paperwork and said I had two hours to pack.



I tried calling Natalie's quarters. No answer. Went to her barracks. Found it empty, bed stripped, closet cleaned out. Asked around. No one had seen her.



Forty minutes before my transport left, I found Martinez loading his gear into a truck.



"You seen Bane?" I asked.



He glanced around before answering. "Ramstein."



"Germany?"



"Shipped out at dawn. They're scattering everyone who was in that room." He slammed the truck door shut. "Don't try to contact anyone. They're watching."



The flight to Osan lasted sixteen hours. I spent it staring at the seat back, replaying that night, seeing Cooper pulled apart, hearing the screams cut short. The airman next to me asked twice if I was okay. I lied both times.



South Korea blurred past. Days became weeks. I did my job. Filed reports. Followed orders. At night, I wrote letters to Natalie that came back stamped "UNDELIVERABLE." Sent emails that bounced. Called numbers that didn't connect.



After three months, a message reached my terminal: "Stop trying. —N"



I stopped.



The nightmares started in month four. Always the same—Goliath finding me, lifting me like it had Cooper, my body coming apart like cheap fabric. I'd wake twisted in sheets, throat raw from screams I hadn't heard myself make.



My roommate requested a transfer. Can't blame him.



The military doctor prescribed pills that turned the dreams to static. Better than watching myself die every night. I took them until they stopped working, then got stronger ones. Worked my way through the pharmacy until nothing helped.



Found bourbon instead.



Finished my service in 2013 and settled in Denver. Rented a one-bedroom near downtown and landed an IT security job I could do half-drunk. The HR manager who hired me had a brother in the Air Force. Military discount, she called it.



Tried therapy. VA doc with a beard and coffee breath who nodded at my vague descriptions of "combat trauma" and wrote prescriptions that joined the others in my medicine cabinet. Couldn't tell him the truth. Couldn't tell anyone.



Tuesday nights I'd meet other vets at a bar off Colfax. They talked about Afghanistan, Iraq, IEDs, and firefights. Real horrors, human horrors. I'd nod like I understood, drink until their faces blurred, then stumble home to my empty apartment.



Six years passed. I functioned. Held jobs. Dated women who eventually got tired of the parts of me I couldn't explain. Drank less, worked more. Started running until my lungs burned and my legs went numb. Pain helped. Made other things fade.



In 2019, I was doing contract work for a Seattle firm. Security audit, two weeks on-site. Boring work in a rainy city. One night I walked into a twenty-four-hour diner near my hotel, soaked from a sudden downpour.



And there she was. Natalie. Sitting in a corner booth with medical textbooks spread around her, red pen between her teeth, hair pulled back in the same tight bun. Six years older but unmistakable.



She looked up as the bell above the door jingled. Our eyes met. Neither of us moved.



"Wilson," she finally said, red pen hovering.



"Bane."



The waitress appeared, coffee pot in hand. I ordered a cup I didn't want. Walked to Natalie's booth and sat without asking. She closed her books, one by one.



"You look..." she started.



"Older."



"I was going to say dry. It's pouring outside."



"I just came in."



Awkward silence stretched between us, years of it packed into seconds. I suddenly couldn't remember why I'd approached her. What was there to say?



She broke first. "Do you still have the dreams?"



The question hit like cold water. No preamble, no small talk. Just straight to the wound.



"Every night," I admitted.



"Me too." She pushed a textbook aside. "Sometimes I think I see it on the street, just for a second. A shape that doesn't fit. A shadow that moves wrong."



"I check the locks twice," I said. "Always."



"Three times," she countered with half a smile.



We talked until the waitress stopped refilling our cups. Traded theories about what Goliath was, why the government covered it up, where it came from. Compared transfer locations, dead ends, nightmares. Discovered we'd both tried the same medications with the same results.



I came back the next night. And the next. My two-week contract stretched to three. We moved from the diner to a bar, from the bar to walks along the waterfront. On my last night in Seattle, she invited me back to her apartment.



It wasn't romantic. We were two broken pieces that somehow fit together. Two people who didn't have to lie about the worst night of their lives. The relief of that was better than any painkiller.



I extended my stay again. Found local work. Moved into a studio twenty minutes from her place. We dated like normal people—dinner, movies, weekend trips to the coast. But underneath it ran a current of shared trauma that kept us close when any sane person would've walked away.



"Sometimes I think they put us in different countries to see if we'd break," she said one night, fingers tracing circles on my chest. "Like an experiment."



"Did you?"



"Break? No." She shook her head against my shoulder. "Bend, maybe. You?"



"Same."



When she moved in with me six months later, the nightmares came less often. By the time I proposed a year after that, they'd faded to once a week. Sometimes less.



We got married in a courthouse with two strangers as witnesses. No family, no friends. Just us, the way it had been since that night in Room 217. Easier that way. Fewer questions about how we met, where we served, why we woke up screaming.



Natalie finished nursing school. I built my security consulting business. We bought a small house in the suburbs with good schools nearby. Planted a garden. Got a dog. Normal life. Suburban life. The kind of life that feels like a shield against darker things.



Robert was born on a cold January morning in 2022. Seven pounds, four ounces. Perfect in every way. The moment I held him, something shifted inside me—a wall coming down or a light coming on. I'd been broken for so long I'd forgotten what wholeness felt like.



"He has your eyes," Natalie said, exhausted and beautiful in her hospital bed.



"Your nose."



"Poor kid."



We brought him home to a nursery painted soft blue. A mobile hung above his crib—stars and moons spinning in lazy circles. At night I'd hold him while Natalie slept, watching his tiny chest rise and fall, listening to his breath.



The nightmares stopped completely. Not fewer—gone. For the first time in thirteen years, I slept through the night. Every night.



We settled into routines. Diaper changes, midnight feedings, first smiles. Natalie worked three twelve-hour shifts at the hospital while I stayed home with Robert. Then we'd switch—she'd take over while I caught up on client work. We were tired in the good way parents are tired. Normal tired.



I built a security system for our house. Motion sensors, cameras, smart locks. Natalie pretended not to notice I checked the footage every morning. I pretended not to notice the bat she kept by the bed. Old habits, worn smooth like river stones.



Some nights we'd sit on the back porch after Robert went down, drinking beer and watching stars come out. Not talking much. Not needing to. The weight we carried had become familiar, almost comfortable in its constancy.



"Do you ever wonder if it's still out there?" she asked once.



"No," I lied.



"Me neither," she lied back.



But we both knew better. Something that large, that impossible, doesn't just disappear. The government didn't lock us down because it was a one-time event. They did it because they knew it would happen again.



Still, we had built something good. Something real. A life filled with first steps and client meetings and Sunday pancakes. A life where Goliath was just a fading memory, a story we'd never tell our son.



I pulled the stack of mail from our box and thumbed through it on the walk back to the house. Bills. Credit card offer. Something from Natalie's sister. And beneath that, a manila envelope with no return address.



My fingers knew before my brain caught up. Same weight. Same texture. Same government issue I hadn't held in thirteen years.



I stopped in the middle of the sidewalk. Our neighbor's sprinklers ticked through their cycle. A kid rode past on a bike, baseball card clicking in the spokes. I turned the envelope over and checked the postmark. Rachel, Nevada.



The only thing in Rachel was dust and the road to Bravo Mike.



Inside our kitchen, I set the other mail down and grabbed a knife from the drawer. Careful cut along the top edge. Clean. Controlled. The knife shook anyway.



Inside was a note card. Three words in red ink: "He is coming."



The handwriting wasn't Cooper's. Cooper was dead. I'd watched him die. But someone from Bravo Mike had sent this. Someone who knew.



I fumbled for my phone and hit Natalie's contact. It rang five times before she answered.



"Hey," she said, sounds of the hospital bustling behind her. "I'm between patients. Everything okay?"



"No." My voice came out wrong—tight and small. "You need to come home. Now."



A pause. "What happened?"



"Bravo Mike."



Two words. That's all it took. I heard her breathing change.



"I'll tell them it's an emergency," she said. "Twenty minutes."



I hung up and opened the hall closet. Behind winter coats and shoe boxes were two black duffel bags we'd packed years ago. Grab-and-go bags with cash, documents, clothes, first aid kits. Things we hoped we'd never need. I pulled them out and set them by the front door.



Next was Robert's room. He was napping, one arm flung above his head, blanket kicked off. I gathered his essentials as quietly as I could—diapers, wipes, formula, clothes, his favorite stuffed dog. Packed it all in his diaper bag and added it to the pile.



Natalie burst through the door nineteen minutes after my call. Her face was flushed, hair coming loose from her bun.



"What is it?" she demanded.



I handed her the card. She read it three times, lips moving silently.



"Who sent this?" she finally asked.



"Postmark says Rachel. Only thing near there is the base."



"We destroyed all records of where we were going."



"Someone kept track," I said.



She set the card down like it might bite. "You think it's real? Not someone messing with us?"



"Who else knows about him? About what happened? The government buried it all."



She nodded, already moving toward our bedroom. "How much time do we have?"



"No idea."



We'd rehearsed this scenario in our heads for years. What we'd take. Where we'd go. How fast we could disappear. Now that it was happening, the plan felt flimsy, full of holes.



"I'll get Robert," Natalie said, voice steady despite the fear in her eyes. "You load the car."



I grabbed our bags and headed outside. The afternoon sun cast long shadows across our driveway as I popped the trunk and arranged our things. Checked the gas tank—three-quarters full. Not ideal, but enough to get distance before we needed to stop.



Something felt wrong. I paused, keys in hand, listening. No birds. No neighborhood sounds. Just the faint hiss of someone's sprinkler two houses down. It was too quiet.



Natalie appeared with Robert bundled against her chest, still sleepy from his nap.



"Car seat," she said.



I helped her secure him in the back, his tiny face scrunched in confusion. He sensed our panic. Kids always know.



"Where are we going?" Natalie asked, climbing into the passenger seat.



"East. Away from the coast." I started the engine. "We can figure out details once we're moving."



"Should we try to contact the others? Martinez? Chang?"



"Martinez is overseas. No idea where Chang ended up." I backed out of the driveway. "Try Michael. He's in Portland."



Natalie pulled out her phone while I scanned the street. Still unnaturally quiet. No dog walkers. No kids playing. Nobody checking mail.



"Voicemail," she said after a moment. "Michael, it's Natalie Bane from Bravo Mike. If you're getting this, you might be in danger. Call me immediately." She left her number and hung up.



Robert started crying as we turned onto the main road. Not his usual fussy cry—this was different. Frightened. Natalie twisted in her seat to comfort him.



"It's okay, baby. We're just going on a trip."



The lie sounded hollow even to me.



I hit the gas harder than necessary, tires chirping on asphalt. The car picked up speed as we approached the intersection that would take us to the highway. Three more blocks. Two. One.



The ground trembled. So slight I might have missed it if I hadn't been waiting for something. Anything. A vibration that traveled up through the wheels and into the steering column.



I checked the rearview mirror. Four blocks back, between houses, something moved. Something large. A distortion in the air like heat waves, but sharper. More defined.



"James," Natalie said, voice barely audible.



"I see it."



Robert's cries grew louder. I pressed the accelerator to the floor. The engine roared in protest as we shot through a yellow light and onto the entrance ramp.



"Call Michael again," I said.



Natalie tried three times. No answer.



"Where are we going?" she asked, strain breaking through her calm facade.



The truth formed in my stomach like a stone. "I don't know."



Goliath was back. The creature that had torn apart Cooper and dozens of others thirteen years ago had found us. Whether it had been hunting us all this time or just now picked up our trail didn't matter. It was here.



I merged onto the highway at twenty over the speed limit, weaving between cars. In the back seat, Robert's cries had softened to whimpers. Natalie reached back to touch his leg, her hand trembling slightly.



"How did it find us?" she asked.



"I don't know that either."



Thirteen years of nightmares. Thirteen years of jumping at shadows and checking locks. Thirteen years of telling ourselves we were safe, that it was over. All blown away by three words on a note card.



I pushed the car faster, watching the rearview mirror more than the road ahead. Nothing followed—no massive shape flowing over asphalt, no spider-like limbs reaching between vehicles. But that didn't mean it wasn't coming.



"We need a plan," Natalie said. "Somewhere it can't find us."



But we both knew there was no such place. We'd seen what Goliath could do. How it moved. How it hunted. How it killed.



"We keep driving," I said, knuckles white on the steering wheel. "We don't stop until we have to."



The highway stretched before us, carrying us away from our home, away from the life we'd built. But not away from the nightmare. Never away from that.



It had only just begun.
