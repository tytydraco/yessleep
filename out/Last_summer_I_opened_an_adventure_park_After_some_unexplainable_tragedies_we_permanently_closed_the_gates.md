Have you ever seen *We Bought A Zoo*? I used to love that film. I repeatedly watched it when I was a kid, and I truly envied Matt Damon. I wanted to be him. Maybe I just wanted Scarlett Johansson. I don’t know. I’m getting sidetracked.

I was once transfixed by the pristine Polaroid of the American dream that *We Bought A Zoo* created, even though the story was based on a British family. Maybe Hollywood should purchase the rights to *my* tale of a dilapidated park’s renovation. I’ve a hunch it might not reach the pitching floor.

Now, obviously, *any* abandoned place is creepy. *We Bought A Zoo* added whimsy and wonder to the experience, but that wasn’t realistic. There was an eerie atmosphere to the derelict farm that I transformed into an adventure park. Perhaps it was compounded by the fact that I didn’t have Scarlett Johansson by my side.

I wasn’t entirely alone. My family came to my aide. We hired people and brought my vision of an adventure park to life. For obvious reasons, I’m going to change names throughout this post. My sister, Josie, was magnificent. My friend, Paul, was a lifesaver in every meaning of the word. Uncle Ron, however, just wanted a slice of the pie.

Anyway, I want to talk about the horrible events that led to the closure of my park.

**The Ghost Train Incident:**

We opened the park gates in June. May was a manic month, as you can probably imagine. I was hiring as many people as possible to get everything up and running. There was so much to do that I could hardly keep on top of every single problem.

Tess worked on the Ghost Train ride. She was setting up decorations and lighting throughout the tunnels. One Friday night in May, she came running to me in floods of tears. Gary, the train engineer, had gone home early, leaving Tess on her lonesome in the darkened tunnels. She had the fright of her life when she spotted something that she didn’t put there.

An animatronic in a purple pinafore.

Tess described the machine as a short girl with a grey face, baby-blue eyes, and the menacing mouth of a metallic nutcracker. It was nearly ten in the evening, and I was too tired to deal with yet *another*issue. Some of the other late-night workers teased Tess, and I admit that I thought she must just be confused. I assumed that another member of staff had installed the animatronic.

Begrudgingly, a few of us accompanied Tess to the Ghost Train tunnels, and we were unsurprised to find no sign of her mechanical ghoul. The girl was distraught, and I originally thought that was due to the incessant mocking from her co-workers.

But Tess told me something, after the others had left. She said the animatronic spoke. The mechanical girl said things that only Tess knew about herself. The machine made callous remarks, but its comments soon escalated to terrible threats. *That* was what had shaken Tess up. I told her it was probably a horrible prank from one of her co-workers.

She didn’t come into work the next day. Nobody could get in contact with her. We just assumed the girl had quit without saying anything. I feared the financial burden of a harassment lawsuit, due to the workplace bullying, but what actually happened was worse. The following day, Tess’ mother came into the office and spoke to Paul. He later told me that her daughter had been missing since Friday night. The mother was wondering whether anyone had seen her go home. We hadn’t.

The entire situation gave me chills. Uncle Ron was simply peeved that Tess had left us in the lurch right before opening, but I had a dreadful feeling about the whole situation. That sickening pit in my stomach was only deepened by Paul’s incessant comments about the farm being built on unhallowed ground. Old local tales. He had warned me not to purchase the abandoned land.

I explored the Ghost Train ride for clues as to the girl’s disappearance. I didn’t find Tess, but I found something that was, perhaps, much worse.

The animatronic. It was real.

The machine with a malicious smile hadn’t been there when Tess led us through the tunnels. I hadn’t believed it actually existed. Seeing it with my own eyes, I have never in my life been quite so petrified. Her purple pinafore, most horrifyingly, was covered in blood. I cried in terror and immediately fled the tunnels.

Uncle Ron urged me to keep quiet about the entire ordeal. He forced me back into the Ghost Train building, and we dragged the animatronic outside. My uncle loaded the unnatural machine onto the back of his truck and coldly warned me to keep my lips sealed. He wasn’t going to let “a prank” ruin his “investment”, even though I had invested far more into the park.

A few weeks later, we opened to the public.

**D-11:**

Aisle D, Seat 11. The cursed seat.

The jousting performance was one of our most popular attractions, and people were far too enthralled by the knights and jesters to notice the woman in D-11 who was hit in the face with an airborne child’s shoe. The culpable child, who had thrown his shoe behind him in excitement, was forced to apologise, but the fuss quickly dissipated. The bloody-nosed woman left to clean herself up.

It was Josie who first made a comment about the seat being “cursed”. The following week, we faced a slightly more serious incident in D-11. A young boy violently choked on his sandwich. Fortunately, somebody dislodged the food item, but the boy’s ribs were broken in the midst of the commotion. His unconscious body was carried out on a stretcher. I heard he made a full recovery.

Two days later, something happened that finally prompted us to get rid of the seat. Paul tore it from the cement. I’m not a superstitious person, but the final incident was horrifying enough to make me question the very nature of the universe. Sitting in D-11, a young man, who was perfectly healthy, according to reports and local rumours, suffered a fatal heart attack. Coroners had little to say, allegedly.

“These things happen.”

They happened far too often in D-11.

**Blind Spot:**

This was the penultimate event to the tragedy which led to my park’s closure. Two children went missing on the obstacle course in the woods.

Nobody’s sure how they could have possibly vanished. There were so many people around. The woods were fenced, as was the entire park. The two boys simply slipped between some trees and were never seen again. On the leaf-strewn clearing in which they disappeared, we found something inexplicably dreadful. Two child-sized mannequins lay on the ground, and they were wearing the clothes of the missing children.

**The Blueberry Man:**

This is something direful that only came to light after the park’s closure, and it certainly sparked a serious inquest. Many people still link this incident to the tragedy of the missing children from the obstacle course. I’m not so sure about that. It’s certainly a terrible story, though.

The blueberry man was not a member of my staff. My employees and I first became aware of his existence when children started to excitedly gush about delicious blueberry ice creams and even blueberry *pies* that they had enjoyed at our park. At first, I would chuckle at the bizarreness of such comments. We didn’t sell blueberry products of any kind.

“Yes, you do,” One kid told me. “The blueberry man’s stand is behind the petting farm!”

Members of staff tirelessly searched for this illegal stand, but nobody ever found the “blueberry man” behind the farm.

Weeks later, after the park closed, a man was arrested for the kidnapping and murder of a child. In his basement, alongside a corpse that was mutilated beyond recognition, there were tubs of blueberries in a small fridge.

What truly haunts me is that one of the responding officers, who is a friend of mine, said the man blubbered and insisted it wasn’t his fault. He said something in the woods made him do it. Something old.

The park closed as the result of *many* horrifying incidents. I’ll post about other terrible things that happened. That being said, I don’t know whether I have the courage to tell the tale of the straw that broke the camel’s back.

I’m also not sure that you would *want* to know it.
