Hello, I’m back. I still haven’t arrived to the city but something happened that I think I should have a known record of.

And just quickly, I realize I never told you people my name, it’s Paige Mendoza-Bardot.

The first 3 hours were uneventful for the most part, I almost hit a buck, but other than that, nothing much happened. Around the 4th hour the toll of not eating breakfast and reaching lunchtime began to weigh on me, so I did the obvious thing. I pulled over on the side of the empty road and turned off the car to save gas so I could eat.

I was chewing on my third small granola bar when I heard something. 

Tap. 

Tap, tap.

Something tapped on the window behind me. I turned around. Nothing. I turned back and kept eating.

Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.

Again, I turned around. Nothing again. I grabbed a flashlight and used it to peer outside of the window because I sure as hell wasn’t going out there. Nothing. Not even a squirrel scurrying away.

I pulled my arms out of the sleeves to be inside the coat and turned it around, then pulled the hood up over my face and put my arms in the sleeves again. 

Tap, tap, tap—

I whipped the hood off and looked right at what I can only call a creature with tiny beady black eyes, reddish flesh, elongated thin bony fingers and exposed teeth with wide canines stained red, and a few thin black hairs along it’s head. It ducked down below my field of view by the car door the second it saw me, thank goodness I’d locked the door in case someone tried to enter before, I grabbed the gear shift so hard my knuckles turned white and shifted into drive so quick I almost broke it, stepping on the accelerator with all of my strength and I sped out of there as fast as I could, I didn’t even breathe normally until I was 10 blocks away. 

It wasn’t until I almost swerved into a lamp post 2 miles away that I slowed down on the brakes.

About 11 hours into the drive, it was getting late and I decided to pull over to sleep. I double checked that every door was locked and all the windows were closed, then I pulled out some clothes from the bag and set it down on the backseat. I pulled the blanket over myself entirely to keep every part of me covered and turned off the car light things as well as the headlights. Soon after I was minutes away from peaceful sleep.

Scraaaaatch. Scraaaaatch.

I didn’t look over, I let it lose interest, if I kept moving, I wouldn’t be able to sleep, hopefully it didn’t figure out how to break the glass.

Eventually I drifted off. It’s morning now, I can’t hear anything outside but there are long scratches on my drivers side door window, I obviously didn’t go outside to check the door but I’m driving again now, I rolled the window down to look and found scratches on the door handle, I rolled the window back up and I haven’t looked again. 

I talked with Alex again a bit ago and we made a loose schedule, check in every 5 hours not including nighttime to make sure we’re both okay, He said he heard tapping at his window too but before he went to bed and he didn’t look, he says he has tiny scratches on his window from the tapping which I got too, I checked after I heard it from him, but he didn’t have anything on his handle. His cat hated the thing though, I guess I forgot to mention Anchovy, his cat. He’s this really cute orange tabby and he’s really clingy and adorable, he’s around 2 years old, but enough about him.

I’ve been driving this morning for an hour now, I have a little less than 28 hours left on the route if my math is correct and there’s no traffic or blockages, I’ll update again soon though. Hope to see you soon!
