Being a night nurse in an old person's home is not a job for the emotionally weak. Nor is it a job for the easily-scared or the superstitious. When you work in a place where Death is often greeted like an old friend rather than feared, where mortality hangs like a veil that can be torn and tossed away any second, and where old, tired, weary souls wait for the embrace of eternity to fold them in its soft arms, you see and hear things that can both shake and repair your faith in humanity and what comes beyond.

I've sat with men and women quietly and stoically accepting that their time on this plane of existence is over, like Mrs Baker, who made the most amazing cakes for all of us even as terminal cancer ravaged her frail body, and the last time I saw her matter-of-factly said "I won't wake up tomorrow, so tonight I'm staying awake". She did so, laughing and playing rummy with the night staff until she yawned, said "well, I guess I can't stay awake no more" and settled calmly to sleep, passing maybe half an hour later.

I've seen people come to the realisation too late that whatever they believed in, or refused to believe in, was or wasn't real. Or worse, I've seen people have the universe come to settle their debts in ways us mere mortals couldn't imagine. Like Mr Hackett, who came to us with rumours of having lived a long and sometimes dubious life - there was talk of "prison time" but we were never allowed to see the records for fear it would influence our care of him (Hippocratic oath and all that, remember?). I will never forget his eyes widening through the haze of late-onset Alzheimers as he sat bolt-upright in a bed he hadn't left in several days, looked at the corner of the room and said in the clearest words he had spoken in years,..."wait, no...not you. I don't want to go with you! I don't want to go! You can't!" before falling slowly into a sleep he would never wake up from. I hope wherever he went, it wasn't as scary as he'd feared.

And then...and then, there was Emily.

Emily was a sweet old thing. Very prim and proper indeed - old money. She had been born in the early thirties, which meant that unfortunately for her she was just old enough to remember the Second World War. A war in which her father was a bomber pilot in the Royal Air Force. She told us the story of how she always worried when he was going on a raid, and the way he got around it was to sing to her. I don't know how he managed to make time to sing to her in the midst of preparing for a mission...the way she told it was that he would, at some point during the day, always sing the old standard "We'll Meet Again" for her, like an incantation against Fate. She described it as a ritual, and a promise Daddy made.   
Twenty-one times throughout 1943 and early 1944 he sang it. He sang it to her on the 30th March 1944, just before setting off to Nuremberg on his 22nd mission, too, and he promised to be back for her birthday.   
  
You probably instantly guessed that that was a promise he never kept. As the pilot of one of the 95 RAF bombers that failed to return that night on the RAF's bloodiest night of the air war, she never knew what happened to him...whether he met death instantly in a fiery flower blooming with terrible beauty in the dark, was ripped apart by the terrible "organ music" of German fighters, or fell out of the sky, with time to make his peace, in a tumbling, twisting, screaming maelstrom of fabric and metal. She knew only that, like many, many others, he paid the price for stopping a certain Austrian's plans for world domination. And that she was now a little girl without a father, like so many of her generation.

She lived a full life - one that made him proud. She travelled. She followed her father into the skies, learning to fly in the more permissive post-war world. She flew all over the world, following in the footsteps of winged goddesses of the sky like Amy Johnson and Amelia Earhart. But strangely, she never flew over Germany if she could avoid it.

As she aged, there were hints that her body and mind and the proud spirit that had dealt with such terrible loss early in life was failing. She became forgetful, and her family realised that it was time to get help when, on a flight to a family wedding in Italy, she became anxious and scared as the plane crossed over Germany, convinced that she was following in her dad's footsteps and was about to share his fate, much to her distress and that of her fellow passengers.

And so she came to us. Her mind was sharp, then it was almost like a dam broke. She forgot who and where she was, who her family were. She had to be supervised for her own safety. Her speech, those glorious cut-glass English vowels, began to slur. She began to talk of wanting to "be with her daddy" and regressing in age.

The few times she became lucid, though, weirdly, were when planes passed over. The home is located close to a small airfield - one that hosts a flying club of Cessnas, Pipers and the like. She'd sit and watch them circle and land for hours on the runway. It made her happy. So did playing the old songs to her. She once became distressed and the only way we could calm her was for me to sing to her. I don't have the greatest voice in the world but "White Cliffs of Dover", "As Time Goes By", "We'll Hang Out The Washing On The Siegfried Line"...I sang them all for her. As the curtain drew slowly down over her senses, the melodies of a never-forgotten but already fading memory of a war seemed to fight off the darkness.

And then came the night she went [away. It](http://away.It) was the 31st March. Her birthday. Emily had been slowly declining into a world of her own. She would sit in her room, or lie in her bed all day. She rarely had moments of lucidity any more. We tried to celebrate her birthday with her but she seemed withdrawn. Sometimes you can tell when someone is preparing to leave this world, and she had one elegantly-attired foot out of the door already. All day she lay. The planes barely even registered with her, even. Her family had come to say their goodbyes in visiting hours, promising to return but knowing that she may not be there, at least in spirit, when she returned.

I had the night duty, and because it was very quiet that night, I sat in Emily’s room between rounds. Some people call it the “death-watch”. Me, I just felt that I needed to be there, just in case she needed me.

I remember it was around 4am when she began to decline. Her breathing became shallower, with longer gaps. She slipped deeper and deeper into sleep. And as that happened, and silence hung like a veil over the home so even the building seemed to stop breathing, I suddenly felt the need to sing to give Emily the sweetest of rest, as I heard a rumble of thunder outside…like the distant echo of four Merlin engines.   
  
It couldn’t have been though, because nobody lands in a deserted airfield in the English countryside at 4am.I stood and approached the bed, took Emily’s hand in the dark, and sang softly.  
  
“*Let's say goodbye with a smile, dear*

*Just for a while, dear we must part*

*Don't let this parting upset you*

*I'll not forget you, sweetheart…”*

And then, the rumble again, nearer. It seemed to pass over the house. Again…I thought it must be thunder as it faded away, and I continued to sing.

*We'll meet again*

*Don't know where*

*Don't know when*

*But I know we'll meet again some sunny day*

Suddenly, I realised Emily’s eyes were open. She wasn’t looking at me, though. She was looking towards the door, and there was an expression of such childlike wonder and joy in her eyes that I am convinced whatever she was seeing, it wasn’t me. But she was awake, and fully *there.* She smiled, and she spoke one word. A word filled with love, and meaning, and joy.

“*Daddy?”*

I didn’t know what to do, except to keep singing. So I did. Incredibly, in a voice that came from inside her, a voice that shed 70 years in an instant - a voice so young that shouldn’t have come from one so old…her frail voice rose with mine.

*Keep smiling through*

*Just like you always do*

*'Til the blue skies chase those dark clouds far away*

This is the bit where I told the doctors and her family she sang with me til the end of the song, then fell asleep with a smile on her face and didn’t wake up again. But that’s not what happened. What happened was something I’ll never, ever forget. 

As we sang, I felt a hand on my shoulder. As Emily smiled up at me, she let go of my hand, and she *reached* past me as if to take someone else’s*.* In the echoes of the building and our voices, I swear I heard a third voice. A man’s voice, rich and cultured just like Emily’s had been. 

And we sang together.

*“We’ll meet again*

*Don’t know where*

*Don’t know when*

*But I know we’ll meet again*

*Some sunny day”*

In the flickering shadows of the lamp, I watched as the shape of a man appeared, and hand in hand with him, a little girl. They walked - I swear they walked - across the room, and as they walked, they looked at each other, and they smiled, and then they faded away - and so did the other voices until I was singing alone.When I turned back to the bed, Emily’s eyes were closed. I didn’t need to check her pulse to know that she’d gone.I was sad, of course. Her passing left a gap in the home that never quite seemed filled after that. There have been other occupants of that room since. For some reason, all the occupants of that room have calm, serene deaths in their sleep, which is by no means a given in my job.

But most of all, sometimes, I walk into that room, and if I do so just as a plane passes overhead on its approach, or on a sunny day, I might hear singing. It’s always the same song. A song that warms the soul and chases any bad feeling away. A message from Emily, and her dad.

*So will you please say "Hello"*

*To the folks that I know?*

*Tell them I won't be long.*

*They'll be happy to know*

*That as you saw me go,*

*I was singin' this song.*



*We'll meet again,*

*Don't know where,*

*Don't know when*

*But I know we'll meet again some sunny day*
