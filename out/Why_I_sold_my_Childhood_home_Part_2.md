It's been about A week since I last updated everyone. I've tried to find research on whatever this creature that is stalking me is. Not even cryptid research can fit with this as far as I can find. It must be a damn Demon or something. If anyone knows what the hell this thing is please tell me ASAP.

I've been able to finally contact an old friend of mine, Let's call her 'Crist She is trying to believe my story but I can tell she thinks I'm insane. She isn't able to see the monster. She wanted me to go to a psyche ward and urged other people in my family to make me go. I don't think I can trust her or anyone anymore. Not like I had anyone to trust before. It's been getting really cold recently. I might need to steal a Jacket soon.  
  
It's really disheartening to be so alone all the time but I have to keep on moving. I heard on the news that they found where my mom was buried. A shallow grave only a mile from my home. So close and I didn't even know it. There's still no killer to be found. The image of her corpse is stuck in my head, she must've been beat to death and/or tortured for hours. I wish I knew who did it but I just don't.  
  
I'm currently hitchhiking out of the country, If this gets me away from that wretched monster then so be it. I'll start a new life anywhere to get away from that thing. I'll finish writing this when I get somewhere safe away from people and whatever that thing is.  
  
**Update:**  
  
It's been another week. I've been held up in a cabin in the middle of nowhere. I won't say exactly just incase this thing can see what I'm saying on here. Somewhere way up north. Once the Guy I was riding with was about to drop me off I saw that thing outside, I didn't think it could be here so fast. It's like its teleporting or some shit. I jumped out of his car and fled as fast as possible. The man was shocked and yelled for me to stop so I didn't get hurt but if I did stop I knew I'd surely die.  
  
No one else seems to see it, It was just walking around them at the Bus station I was left at with my mothers rotting corpse and no one could see it. I was yelling for help but some guy dressed as security kicked me out. That thing was keeping it's distance for a bit for some reason. I also managed to keep my gun with me and I never go anywhere without it pressed against my chest. If this thing doesn't die then either way I'm screwed.  
  
I only have two bullets, One for it, and One for me. If I don't update again in a week or two assume I'm with my mother.
