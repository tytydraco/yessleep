I bought the Machen place at auction for sixty-three thousand dollars. Sight unseen, technically, though I'd driven past it enough times over the years to know what I was getting into. Two-story farmhouse, built sometime in the 1920s, abandoned since old Earl died without heirs in 2019. The county finally seized it for back taxes last spring. I was the only bidder.

My name's Dennis. I've been flipping houses in rural Ohio for about twelve years now—started after the recession when you could pick up foreclosures for the price of a used truck. I'm not one of those TV renovation guys with a crew and a timeline. I work alone, mostly. Buy cheap, fix slow, sell modest. It's a living.

The Machen place sat on four acres about seven miles outside of Crofton, down a gravel road that the county stopped maintaining sometime during the Obama administration. The nearest neighbor was a soybean farm a half-mile east, run by a family I never saw. Just their equipment sometimes, crawling across the fields like slow insects.

I moved my trailer onto the property in early September. Set up my tools in what used to be a detached garage—roof half-collapsed, but three walls still good. The house itself wasn't as bad as I'd expected. Solid bones. The foundation was limestone block, which they don't do anymore, and the framing was old-growth oak that'd outlast anything they mill today. Roof needed replacing. Porch was rotted through. Plumbing was a disaster of corroded galvanized pipe that someone had patched with copper in maybe six different places, none of them to code.

But it was the floors that concerned me most.

The kitchen floor had a sag to it. Not dramatic—maybe an inch and a half of slope over eight feet—but enough that you'd feel it when you walked. Water damage, I figured. Old houses like this, the kitchen's always where the problems start. A slow leak under the sink, twenty years of moisture migrating into the subfloor, and eventually the joists start to give.

I pulled up the linoleum on my third day. Underneath was the original pine planking, black with age and soft in patches. I cut out a two-foot section near the worst of the sag and shined my flashlight down into the crawlspace.

The property survey I'd gotten from the county assessor showed a partial crawlspace beneath the kitchen and back hallway—eighteen inches of clearance, accessible through a hatch in the hallway closet. Standard for a house this age. They poured a perimeter foundation, laid joists across concrete piers, and left just enough room underneath to run plumbing and check for termites.

But when I looked through that hole I'd cut, my flashlight beam didn't hit dirt at eighteen inches.

It didn't hit anything.

I couldn't see the bottom.



I'm not a superstitious person. I've been in old houses where the crawlspaces flood and the standing water looks like a black mirror. I've seen root cellars that go down eight, ten feet and fill with shadows that play tricks. I figured the Machen place had something similar—maybe a partial basement that didn't show up on the survey, or an old cistern that got incorporated into the foundation.

I went around to the hallway closet and found the crawlspace hatch. It was a piece of plywood set into the floor, painted over so many times it was almost flush with the surrounding boards. I pried it up with a flatbar.

The smell that came out wasn't rot. It wasn't mold or standing water or dead animals. It was cold air, dry and faintly mineral, like the inside of a limestone cave. And beneath that, something else—something thin and chemical that I couldn't place. Like old pennies. Like the residue inside a battery compartment.

I got my good flashlight from the garage. Four hundred lumens, rechargeable, the kind that can light up a whole basement from the doorway. I laid flat on the hallway floor and pointed it down through the hatch.

The crawlspace looked normal for the first six feet or so. Dirt floor, concrete piers, old cobwebs strung between the joists like gray lace. I could see the corroded plumbing running toward the kitchen, and the newer copper patches glinting where my light caught them.

But past that—maybe eight feet in—the ground sloped downward.

Not gradually. Sharply. Like the dirt floor just dropped away into something deeper.

I couldn't see where it ended.



The rational part of my brain started constructing explanations. The house was built on a hill; maybe the crawlspace followed the natural grade and opened into a deeper hollow on the downslope side. Maybe there'd been an old root cellar or cold storage that got sealed off and forgotten. Old farmhouses are full of architectural afterthoughts.

I decided I'd check it out properly the next morning, in daylight, with better equipment.

That night I slept in my trailer with the windows cracked. The temperature had dropped into the low fifties, and I could hear the wind moving through the soybeans in the distance—that dry, papery sound they make before harvest. I don't usually have trouble sleeping on job sites. The quiet doesn't bother me. I've spent enough nights alone in half-finished houses that the creaks and settles are just background noise.

But I kept thinking about that slope. That darkness where my flashlight beam just... dissolved.

I got up around 2 AM to take a piss. Stepped outside, did my business by the treeline, and happened to glance toward the house.

There was a light in the kitchen window.

Faint. Yellowish. Not a flashlight beam—more like a glow. Like someone had lit a candle in there and walked away.

I stood there for a long time, watching. The light didn't move. Didn't flicker. Just sat there, steady and dim, for maybe three or four minutes.

Then it went out.

I didn't go back to sleep that night. Sat in my trailer with the door locked, telling myself it was a reflection. Moonlight hitting something. A passing car on the distant county road.

But I knew what car headlights look like through a window. I knew what moonlight does.

That wasn't either.



The next morning I went through the house room by room. Nothing was disturbed. My tools were where I'd left them. No sign of entry, no footprints in the dust except my own.

I checked the kitchen window where I'd seen the light. Nothing there—no candle, no lantern, no reflective surface that might've caught a stray beam.

Then I looked at the floor.

The hole I'd cut in the pine planking was about two feet square. I'd left it open, covered loosely with a scrap of plywood so I wouldn't step in it by accident.

The plywood had been moved.

Not much. Maybe six inches to the left. Just enough that the hole was partially exposed.

I stared at it for a while. Tried to remember if I'd nudged it somehow, kicked it on my way out the day before. I couldn't have. I'd been careful. I'm always careful about open holes in floors—one wrong step and you're looking at a broken ankle, a lawsuit, three months of recovery.

I moved the plywood back into place. Weighted it down with a cinder block from the garage.

Then I got my flashlight, my tape measure, and my phone, and I went back to the hallway closet to do a proper inspection of the crawlspace.



The hatch was where I'd left it, pried up and leaning against the closet wall. I got down on my stomach and lowered myself through, feet first.

The clearance was tight—maybe sixteen inches between the dirt floor and the underside of the joists. I had to army-crawl, dragging my flashlight ahead of me. The air was cold, much colder than it should've been for September, and that mineral smell was stronger down here. My breath plumed faintly in the flashlight beam.

I made my way toward the kitchen, following the line of old galvanized pipe. The dirt beneath me was hard-packed, almost like clay, and dry. No moisture problems down here. No sign of the water damage I'd expected.

After about eight feet, the ground started to slope.

I stopped. Shined my light ahead.

The slope was steeper than it had looked from above. Maybe thirty degrees, descending into darkness. The dirt floor gave way to bare rock—limestone, gray and smooth, like the walls of the old quarries outside Crofton.

And carved into the rock, descending with the slope, were steps.

Rough-hewn. Old. Worn smooth in the centers from use.

They went down further than my flashlight could reach.



I backed out of that crawlspace faster than I've ever moved in a confined space. Scraped my back on a joist, tore my shirt, didn't care. I got back up into the hallway and stood there breathing hard, my heart slamming against my ribs.

Steps. Stone steps, going down. In a crawlspace that the county survey said was eighteen inches deep.

I called the assessor's office that afternoon. Asked about the Machen property, whether there were any records of a basement or cellar that might not have shown up on the standard survey. The woman who answered put me on hold for fifteen minutes, then came back and said no. No basement. No cellar. The 1987 survey was the most recent on file, and it showed a partial crawlspace, eighteen inches, dirt floor.

I asked if there'd been any structures on the property before the current house. She said she'd have to check the historical records and get back to me.

She never did.



I should've walked away. I know that now. Should've eaten the sixty-three grand, listed the property as-is, and let it become someone else's problem.

But I've been doing this job too long. I've seen a lot of strange things in old houses—hidden rooms, sealed-off stairways, whole sections of buildings that got walled up and forgotten. There's always an explanation. Old man Machen, or his father, or his grandfather—someone had dug those steps for a reason. Root cellar. Storm shelter. Prohibition-era storage. Something.

I told myself I'd document it, figure out what was down there, and factor it into the renovation. Maybe it'd even be a selling point. Historic property with original stone cellar. People pay extra for that kind of thing.

The next morning I gathered my supplies: a better flashlight, a hundred-foot tape measure, my phone for photos, a ball of twine to mark my path. I put on my kneepads and my work gloves. I even brought a respirator, in case there was mold or bad air down in whatever space those steps led to.

I lowered myself through the hatch a little after 9 AM. The crawlspace was cold again—colder than yesterday, if anything. My breath came out in thick clouds. I made my way toward the slope, toward those stone steps, and this time I didn't stop at the top.

I started down.



The steps were irregular—some shallow, some deep—but solid under my weight. The limestone walls on either side were close, maybe three feet apart, rough-cut but clearly worked by tools. Not natural. Not a cave. Someone had carved this.

I counted the steps as I went. Twenty. Thirty. Forty.

At fifty steps, I stopped and looked back. The rectangle of my entry point—the dim light filtering down from the hallway above—was barely visible. A faint gray smear in the darkness above me.

I checked my phone. No signal, of course. But the timestamp said 9:14 AM.

I kept going.

At seventy steps, the passage leveled out into a small landing. The walls widened here, opening into a chamber maybe ten feet across. My flashlight beam swept across the space, and I saw—

Tools.

My tools.

My DeWalt drill, yellow and black, sitting on a natural stone shelf. My speed square. My chalk line. The flatbar I'd used to pry up the crawlspace hatch.

I hadn't brought any of them down here.

I hadn't even noticed they were missing from the garage.



I stood there for a long time, trying to process what I was seeing. The tools were arranged neatly, precisely, laid out in a row like a display. Like someone was showing them to me.

The rational part of my brain said: you're mistaken. You brought them down here yesterday and forgot. You were stressed, you weren't thinking clearly.

But I knew I hadn't. I knew.

I picked up the flatbar. It was cold—so cold it hurt to hold even through my work gloves. I shined my light around the rest of the chamber, looking for another exit, another passage.

There was one. A narrow opening in the far wall, descending again.

More steps.

I didn't follow them. Not then. I grabbed my tools—all of them—and I went back up. Counted the steps on the way. Seventy. Exactly seventy.

When I emerged from the crawlspace, the hallway was dark.

I checked my phone. 6:47 PM.

I'd been down there for nine hours.

It had felt like twenty minutes.



That night I loaded my tools into my truck. All of them. I wasn't leaving anything in the garage anymore.

I sat in my trailer with the doors locked, trying to make sense of what had happened. Time dilation. Disorientation in confined spaces. It happens—I've read about cavers who lose track of time underground, whose internal clocks go haywire without sunlight to anchor them.

But nine hours. Nine hours, and I remembered maybe twenty minutes of it.

What had I been doing for the rest?

I didn't sleep. Couldn't. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw those stone steps descending into the dark. Saw my tools laid out on that shelf like offerings.

Around 3 AM, I heard something.

A scraping sound. Faint. Coming from the direction of the house.

I looked out the trailer window.

The kitchen light was on again. That same yellowish glow. But this time it was moving—drifting slowly from window to window, like someone was walking through the house carrying a lantern.

And then I heard the second sound.

A rhythmic tapping. Metal on stone.

The sound my flatbar makes when I test a foundation for hollow spots.



I didn't go into the house that night. I sat in my truck with the engine running and the doors locked until dawn broke gray and cold over the soybean fields. When the sun was fully up, I walked to the house with a crowbar in one hand and my phone in the other, ready to call 911 at the first sign of... I didn't know what. I didn't know what I expected to find.

The kitchen was empty. The light was off. My tools were still in my truck where I'd locked them.

But the hole in the floor—the two-foot square I'd cut to inspect the subfloor—had changed.

It was bigger.

Three feet square now. At least. The edges were clean, freshly cut, sawdust still scattered on the remaining planking.

And beside the hole, arranged in a neat row, were the pieces of wood that had been removed.

Cut into perfect six-inch sections.

Stacked like cordwood.



I know how this sounds. I know you're thinking I should've left right then. Called the police. Called someone.

But what was I going to tell them? That my crawlspace was too deep? That someone had been using my tools to expand a hole in the floor? They'd think I was drunk, or crazy, or both.

And there was something else. Something I haven't mentioned yet because I'm still not sure how to explain it.

When I looked down into that hole—the bigger hole, the expanded hole—I didn't feel afraid.

I felt invited.



I went down again the next day.

I told myself I was just going to measure. Document. Take photos for evidence, in case I needed to prove to someone that this was real.

The steps were the same. The chamber at seventy steps was the same. My tools were gone from the stone shelf—I'd taken them with me—but in their place was something new.

A chair.

One of the kitchen chairs from upstairs. Wooden, spindle-backed, painted white. I recognized the chip in the paint on the left armrest from when I'd bumped it with my toolbox the first week.

It was sitting in the center of the chamber, facing the narrow passage that led further down.

Like someone had placed it there for me.

Like someone wanted me to sit. To rest. To stay a while.



I didn't sit. I took photos—or tried to. My phone's camera showed only darkness, no matter how many times I tried.

I went back up. This time I counted carefully, watched my phone's clock the whole way.

I counted seventy steps. The climb took four minutes.

But when I emerged, six hours had passed.



The next three days are difficult to reconstruct.

I know I didn't leave the property. I know I kept going down. I have fragments—images, impressions—but they don't connect into a coherent narrative.

I remember the steps. More than seventy now. I remember counting past one hundred, past two hundred, and still descending.

I remember the chambers. Multiple chambers, opening off the main passage like rooms in a house. In one of them I found a bed—my cot from the trailer, sheets and all. In another, my cooler, stocked with food I don't remember buying.

I remember the walls getting smoother as I went deeper. Less like rough-hewn stone, more like they'd been worn by hands. Thousands of hands, over thousands of years, polishing the limestone to a dull gleam.

And I remember the sounds.

The tapping had stopped. But there was something else now. A kind of breathing. Vast and slow, like the house itself was inhaling and exhaling around me.


I'm writing this in my trailer. It's—I think it's October now. The soybeans have been harvested; I can see the bare fields through my window.

I stopped going down four days ago. Or five. Time has become difficult.

The crawlspace is still there. The hole in the kitchen floor has grown again—it's nearly six feet across now, and I don't think I cut all of it. Some of it cut itself. The edges are too clean, too precise.

I can hear the breathing all the time now. Even up here. Even with the trailer doors locked and the windows sealed.

And last night, when I walked past the house to get to my truck, I looked in through the kitchen window.

The hole was glowing.

That same yellowish light, rising up from below. And in the light, I could see the top of the stairs.

There was something on the top step.

Something that hadn't been there before.

It was too dark to make out details. But it was the right size, the right shape, to be a person.

And I think—I'm almost certain—it was sitting in the chair.

Waiting.


I'm going to leave today. That's the plan. Load up the truck, drive to Crofton, find a motel with decent wifi and cell reception. File the paperwork to abandon the property. Let the county take it back.

But I keep finding reasons to stay another hour. Another day.

There's always something I forgot to pack. Always one more thing I need to check.

And the breathing is louder now. Almost like words. Almost like it's calling my name.

I measured the crawlspace hatch this morning.

It used to be two feet by three feet.

Now it's four by four.

Big enough to walk through standing up.



I don't think I'm going to leave.

I think I'm going to go down one more time.

Just to see.

Just to understand what's been waiting down there, in the dark, growing the space to welcome me.

The chair is still there. I checked.

And now there's a second one beside it.



If anyone reading this knows the Machen property—the old farmhouse on Route 7, seven miles outside Crofton—don't buy it.

Don't go inside.

And whatever you do, don't open the hatch in the hallway closet.

The crawlspace keeps growing.

And I don't think it stops.
