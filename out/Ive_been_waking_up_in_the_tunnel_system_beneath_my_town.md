My therapist/priest said I should write down what happened to me. He said it’d help with my therapy and hopefully help me get to a place in life where I can become self-dependent again. He also said that sharing my story with others could help validate my feelings, and help me see that what happened wasn’t my fault. So, I figured I’d kill two birds with one stone and just post it here. 



For you to fully understand my story, I need to give some back ground. To start, my name is Grayson Miller and I’m 25 years old. The town I live in (which is a small town in rural South Dakota) has a system of tunnels that run underneath the city. It mostly consists of smaller drainage tunnels (about 3 x 3 feet), but where all these tunnels eventually meet up forms a single large tunnel. This main tunnel spans about 2 miles in a single direction, and is about 7 x 10 feet. This tunnel is called “The Sheep Tunnel”. It was given this name because this used to be the tunnel that local farmers would use to bypass the town's streets while transporting their sheep to and from the nearby mountains (near Black Elk Peak, if you know where that is). But now it’s filled with graffiti and trash. The local teens and college students often visit this tunnel as a sort of “test of courage”. I myself have been here with friends several times in highschool for similar reasons. Though, one unspoken rule of the tunnels is that you never visit by yourself. Not because the tunnels themselves are a danger; the people who are rumored to live in them are.



When I was in highschool, the younger brother of my friend, Barry Bronson, went missing when he was dared to walk the length of the Sheep Tunnel alone. When Barry never showed up at the other end, his friends became worried and notified the police. Despite countless hours of searching, no one was able to find him. About two months after he was reported missing, a group of college students stumbled across his body. Barry was found at the main entrance of the Sheep Tunnel, a couple yards back from the opening. He was completely dismembered. The body was positioned on a small wooden platform and “decorated” around a tall wooden stake coming up from the middle of the platform. Based on the color of the blood and the state the flesh was in, it was apparent that it was recently placed there. The head was removed from the neck and put into an incision just below the rib cage, so that the face of the head jutted out, replacing the stomach. Sticking out from around the head were the small and large intestine, cut into strands, as if they were vines dangling off a long forgotten statue. The arms were also taken from their sockets and inserted in different locations on the torso. His right arm stuck out from his back and was positioned in a way that made it look like the hand was receiving a gift. His left arm was inserted in a hole where the left trapezius should have been. The arm bent over the neck and came down the front of the chest. The hand was positioned with the pointer finger, the middle finger, and the thumb all extended pointing down towards the ground; palm facing out. Both of the legs were removed from the hip joint and were wrapped around the waist, as if they were a belt. There was also a passage, of sorts, written on the wall next to the “sculpture”. It read:

 "Verily, I say unto thee, physical perfection in this 

Mortal realm is nigh unto impossible to attain. 

Yet, through the might and dominion of Mammon, 

All things shall come to fruition according to his will.

Behold, Mammon's wife."



Law enforcement scoured the tunnels and surrounding area for months, looking for any evidence or clues for who might have done this. But quickly, all leads ran cold. The Sheep Tunnel was permanently closed off, using rebar to gate off the entrances. Every so often people still go missing from this town; it’s always blamed on the Sheep Tunnel. 



Barry’s funeral was held at the church I attended. I sat next to my friend Sawyer, Barry's older brother. Sawyer and I had been friends for as long as I can remember, yet I found myself speechless as to how to help console my friend at this time. I remember Priest Malcolm gave some sermon about how this town is festering in a demonic presence and that we need to cleanse it. I don’t remember much from the funeral, I really only remember how uncomfortable I felt at how inappropriate it seemed to be saying that instead of giving some blessing to Barry or his family.  



About a year had passed since the funeral and the town was still in shock from the scene that had been found. But Sawyer and I had just graduated highschool and were figuring out what to do to celebrate. We discussed various activities for our graduation celebration sitting in the grass at a park. Somehow we found ourselves talking about paranormal hotspots.



“Why don’t we just go to Deadwood? It’s not that far from here and I’ve heard it’s got tons of haunted places,” I said.



Sawyer was less enthused “Okay yeah, but it’s a major tourist spot. If we go somewhere haunted I don’t wanna be dragged around by some tour guide. I’d hate that”



I nodded in agreement. I also had the same reservations of going to a major tourist destination. I too hated tour guides; I’d much rather just explore an area for myself. I thought for a second, still wanting to do something with the paranormal. (Looking back on this conversation, I wish I had never come up with this idea. What kind of friend would ever suggest something like this? I hate myself for ever having the idea.) “Well, there’s that new psychic that I’ve heard about who just opened up their business. Why don’t we go there?”



“That could be cool,” Sawyer said. “But that’s not that big of a celebration. I wanna do something more memorable,” his head resting on his hands.



“Fair. But what if we asked the psychic for information about the tunnels? There’s gotta be something paranormal in there.”



Sawyer froze, understanding what I was suggesting “You want us to ask the psychic about Barry? He was sacrificed to the devil, Grayson. Why would you even bring that up? What is wrong with you?” he started to get up from the grass.



My stomach twisted, and my face became flush. In the poorly formed brain of an 18 year old, I didn’t realize how messed up what I said was until I heard Sawyers reaction. “Nothing’s wrong with me. He wasn’t sacrificed to the devil. That’s just a rumor,” my pride made me defensive. I paused and then continued, “Don’t you want to find out what happened to your brother? There’s gotta be someone who knows. And if the police were useless in figuring it out, maybe a psychic could help?” I was pulling crap out of the air. Trying to find some defense for how absolutely inconsiderate I had been. But deep down I knew that we both wanted to find justice for Barry. Sawyer stared at me, disgust on his face.



“Just shut up,” Sawyer said as he walked away. I could see tears forming in his eyes. I knew I was in the wrong, so I kept my mouth shut.





About a week had passed without any contact from Sawyer. I knew I should reach out to apologize, but once again, I was a prideful brat. I laid in my bed, lost in thought, when my phone rang. It was Sawyer.



“I think you’re sick for bringing it up. But I want to know what happened to Barry before he died. My family has been falling apart since his death and I want to find justice for him.”



I didn’t know how to respond, “Yeah. Me too.”



“Tomorrow,” Sawyer said, “We’ll see the psychic tomorrow.”



Sleep didn’t come easily to me that night. My mind was running rampant with ideas and possibilities of what could come. My thoughts were split up into three parts. One: I am very skeptical of psychics. I think a lot of them are con artists who take advantage of people who do believe in the supernatural and want some sort of contact with the great beyond. Two: There’s a possibility that some psychics are real and actually have some sort of connection to the supernatural or are just more intune with their spiritual side than other people. Three: My own personal belief of ghosts or hauntings is that typically they don’t happen. On occasions, I believe that certain places can hold dark spirits or evil feelings. But one thing I believe wholeheartedly is that when you speak of the devil, he will come.





The next day I pulled up to Sawyer's house at the time that we had discussed. He came out to my car when he saw me pull up. “You sure you still wanna do this?” I asked.



Sawyer took a breath “Yeah, I’m sure. My family hasn’t been the same since what happened. I wanna help bring closure by finding the monster who did that to my brother.”



The psychic had opened up shop in a strip mall in Rapid City, which was only about a 30 minute drive from where we lived. On our way there we listened to music, mostly the band Gorillaz. Luckily, the music helped break the tension between us and we were able to joke and talk how we used to.



The time passed by quickly and in no time we pulled up to the street the psychics shop was on. When we pulled into the parking lot of the plaza, there weren’t any parking spots close to the psychic, but as we drove past it we saw the name “Ms Scylla’s Dark Arts Emporium”



“Weird,” I mumbled under my breath. We had to park on the other side of the parking lot in order to find a spot. Sawyer and I got out of my car and began walking. We passed by a deli shop as a sheriff and deputy walked out. “Sheriff Nelson?” Sawyer said. I looked over, surprised that Sawyer knew them. 



“You’re that Bronson boy! Sawyer, was it?” Sheriff Nelson responded.



“Yeah! How have you been doing?”



“I’ve been good. Just taking my lunch break,” the Sheriff laughed. He was a larger man, but was kind. Sawyer and the Sheriff had some small talk, and we were soon on our way.



“How do you know him?” I asked.



“He was one of the officers who worked on Bronson's case. He helped a lot and led almost every single search effort into the tunnels. He’s a good man; my family grew close to him.”



We reached the emporium, there was a sign in the window that read: “Palm readings, tarot cards, and scrying” We walked in and a little bell chimed. Somewhere in the back an older woman called, “I’ll be there in just a minute”. The first thing I noticed about this place was the smell. It had an old musty scent, almost like a library, but with a faint smell of rot mixed in. The second thing I noticed was a large painting in the back of the room. It was a fiery landscape. On the left in the painting was a mound of gold; a throne sat in the middle. There was a demon sitting on the throne. Gold encrusted horns were protruding from its head and it wore a headdress that was decorated in jewels. There was nothing particularly scary about the painting, but I shuddered from it. We looked around the store for a brief moment. It was filled with chintzy trinkets. There were animal bones, “spell books”, dark fantasy paintings, role playing dice, and various other seemingly useless items. I was not impressed. We heard footsteps coming from behind a curtain that was behind the checkout counter. The curtain parted and out walked an old lady. Her hair was gray and long with a dreaded lock in the front that had a feather and what looked to be small bones woven into it, about the size you’d see from a cat. Her face was wrinkled and she had deep brown eyes. Her outfit, though, looked like she had found a gypsy costume at Spirit Halloween.



“Well hello,” the old woman cooed, “What can I help you with?” 



A little put off by her appearance, expecting something more authentic, I forgot to speak. So Sawyer shot up.



“We’re here for some advice or guidance with some questions we have about the supernatural. There was an incident that we wanted your help with.”



The woman smiled warmly at us. “Follow me back here.” We walked with her back behind the curtain, passed a few stacks of dusty boxes, and into a room that was also blocked by curtains. As the woman parted them we went inside and sat down at a small round table that had a black cloth with a dark red trim that draped over the top of the table. Atop the table was a crystal ball that had a metal demonic looking hand as the base. Sawyer shot me a look that said We’re gonna waste our money on this old goat? I shrugged and cocked my head to the side saying we’ll see what happens, I’ll pay. 



The old woman looked at us both slowly, “So what do you want to know?”



Sawyer spoke first. He started out slow, “About a year ago my brother went missing. Everyone in our town searched everywhere. Two weeks later we found out that my brother was murdered. Not only was he murdered, his entire body was dismembered and positioned into some-” His voice cut out. “Like some sort of statue,” he said softly. I could see him reliving the moment the police told him what happened to his brother, in his head.



“Not only that,” I whispered, “There was an almost scripture-like passage on the wall. It talked about Mammon. I know in the Bible it talks about mammon, but as wealth. This mammon had the ‘m’ capitalized; like it was a name. Do you know what that is?”



A silent grin crept across the woman's face. “Mammon.” She said it in a whisper but with more force behind it then I thought possible. When she said it, darkness settled in the room. A weight fell on everyone around the table, almost as if I were being forced down into my chair.

“Mammon is one of the 7 demon lords. The lord of greed and wealth. He wants all, and he will take all.”



“What did he want with my brother?” Sawyer leaned forward as he asked. Waiting for the answer with eagerness and fear.



“One can’t say for certain, but I could guess that it wasn’t Mammon himself who wanted your brother, but someone who was trying to gain something from Mammon.”



Sawyer and I both froze; lead building in our stomachs. Tears began to form in Sawyer's eyes and his voice wavered, “What could they gain from mutilating my brother?”



The old woman's eyes flickered, “Do you want to find out?” Her grin becoming more prominent.



Sawyer and I glanced at each other. I could see so many emotions flashing through my friends eyes. Sorrow, curiosity, but mostly fear. Sawyer looked at the psychic, “I want to know.”



The old woman put her hands on the crystal ball and let out a breath that sounded like a death rattle. Her body trembled slightly; her eyes fixed on the ball and she muttered some words I couldn’t understand. I felt a presence entering the room. It literally felt as if someone else had walked into the room and was standing behind us. I shot a look behind me, yet saw nothing. The room was even darker now. I looked over at Sawyer, his eyes were glued to the woman and the ball; tears running down his face. A gurgle escaped the woman's mouth and she began breathing heavily. Fear had masked her face. She started looking around the room as if she was trying to see something. Then she spoke.



“Who’s there?” Her voice was no longer an old woman's voice and it sounded familiar. “Tommy? Sawyer? Is that you? If that’s you this isn’t funny. Get out of there.” 



Sawyer began actively crying, soft moans coming from his mouth as tears poured down his face. “B-Barry!” He screamed.



The old woman didn’t acknowledge Sawyer. She suddenly screamed in that same young boy’s voice, Barry’s voice, “Who are you?! Sawyer! Sawyer, help me!” The woman began moving around as if she were running; her hands still connected to the crystal ball. Her body jolted and she groaned. Her body began inching like a worm and she craned her head to look behind herself, “Pleeease! Please stop! Don’t kill me! Please don’t kill me!” Then the psychic began gurgling and shaking. Suddenly she smashed her head into the table and lay motionless.



Sawyer was now sobbing. He was trying to get up from his chair but his limbs were weak. Tears were streaming down my face too, but I got up and grabbed Sawyer, helping him to his feet. As I got my friend up, the old woman sat up in her chair and shot over the table, knocking it over and landing on top of me.



“MAMMON! MAMMON! MAMMON!” She kept screaming it in my face over and over again. I fought to get her off of me. Sawyer and I were both screaming as we tried to get her off of me. She pulled a small bone out of her hair and stabbed me in the side with it. As soon as she did, she stopped screaming, got off of me, and ran deeper into her store. I felt blood pooling down my side, but we didn’t hesitate for a single moment. We sprinted out of the store, accidentally knocking over a vase of fake eyeballs on the way out. 



We drove about 10 miles out of the city and pulled over on the side of the road. Sawyer was an emotional wreck and I wasn’t much better off. My side was soaked in blood and I was feeling woozy. That feeling of darkness still hadn’t left me. Whatever was in that shop was evil. I had never felt something like that in my entire life up to this point. Nonetheless, I knew the wound in my side was the first problem that needed to be addressed. 



“Sawyer, can you drive? I’m having trouble seeing straight right now.”



Sawyer looked over at me and saw the blood on my hand. He quickly wiped the tears from his face and locked in, “Yeah. Yeah, I’m fine. I can drive.” 



We drove to the instant care. Even though I was actively bleeding, we sat in the waiting room for almost 15 minutes before the doctor called us back. I was treated with antibiotics and easily sewn up. Sawyer took me home as we sat in silence in the car. How do you even talk about what happened? As the young men that we were, we struggled talking about how we felt for small and simple things, let alone something as traumatic as what we had experienced. We pulled up to my house as the sun was setting and Sawyer dropped me and my car off, he walked home; his house was only a block away. 



I walked into my house, carefully avoiding my parents; I didn’t want to have to explain the blood and my mental state, and I walked into my room. Carefully laying myself down on my bed, avoiding my hurt side, I quickly fell asleep; overcome by exhaustion.



As quickly as I fell asleep, I began to dream. In my dream I was in an aspen grove on a trail. The trail itself was littered with leaves. I looked up; it was dusk. As I walked down the trail, there was no sound in the trees. No birds chirping, no crickets singing, nothing. I remember when I was younger and in a scout group, our leader taught us that when the forest goes silent, danger is near. Remembering this, my senses heightened, and fear began to overwhelm me. I quickened my pace down the trail. Suddenly the forest around me darkened. I looked up, surprised that nightfall came so soon, but it hadn’t. It was still dusk. A sickening dread fell over me and I struggled to breath. I fell on my knees and put my face in my hands, trying to calm myself. After a few moments I looked up from my hands. But what I saw wasn’t the forest I was just in. My eyes took a second to adjust to the darkness I was now experiencing. I looked up at the sky once again and saw stars. It was nighttime. I looked forward and saw a wall of rebar, blocking a long, dark tunnel. My stomach twisted as I realized where I was. Sitting before me was the entrance to a place I hadn’t been to in a long time. Sitting before me was the entrance to the Sheep Tunnel.



I’m going to stop my story here for now. Recounting all of these memories has brought back a lot of pain. I need a break. I’ll try writing down more of what happened by next week. Thank you for reading this.
