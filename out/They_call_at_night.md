Hello, my loves. Let me tell you a story.

First, introductions.  I am the voice you might stumble upon during those haunting hours when the world is cloaked in silence, and you’re enveloped by nothing but the eerie static of the universe. If you listen intently, my voice may seep through the cosmic hum, wrapping itself around your lonely kitchen, your dimly lit bedroom, wandering down the desolate roads that stretch infinitely beyond your car’s feeble headlights.

And tonight, It happened to me.

I don’t know why I answered the phone that night. I wasn’t expecting a call. It was late, The kind of late when the world grows desolate, as if everyone has slipped into sweet oblivion, leaving you stranded in the shadows. The kind of late where shadows warp, stretching further into the stillness, and the quiet gnaws at the edges of your mind.

The first call came at exactly 3:00 AM.
I picked up, half expecting a wrong number. But there was nothing. Just silence. No breathing. No static. Not even a whisper of static—just an unsettling, pregnant pause that seemed to stretch on forever.

Just… waiting.

I hung up.

Three minutes later, the phone rang again.
This time, I heard something.an electric crackle of static, as if an old radio wrestled for a signal. And then, a rhythmic sound began to emerge. 

Then—breathing. Slow, deliberate.

And then—

My name.

Not from the phone.

From somewhere behind me.

I spun around so fast I nearly dropped the phone. My apartment was empty. The door was locked. The windows shut. But I felt it—that unmistakable sensation of being watched, of something just out of sight.

I hung up again.

Another three minutes passed.

The third call.

I didn’t want to answer. Every instinct told me not to. But my hand moved on its own, my fingers cold as I pressed the phone to my ear.

A voice spoke. Calm. Gentle.

It said my name.

“Yes, this is [censored]. Who is this?”

Silence. Then, softly:

“Please come outside.”

I swallowed, gripping the phone tighter. “Why?”

“Please. Come outside.”

Something about the way it said it—flat, emotionless—made my skin crawl.

“Who is this?” My voice cracked. “What do you want?”

“Come outside.”

I hung up.

I waited, barely breathing, heart pounding so hard it drowned out everything else. I told myself it was over. It had to be over.

Then—

A knock.

Soft. Steady.

At the front door.

I don’t know how long I stood there, frozen. The knock wasn’t right. Too sharp, too precise—like bone tapping against wood.

Then—

Another knock.

But not from the front door.

From the back.

And the hallway closet.

Then—

From right behind me.

I couldn’t move. I couldn’t breathe. It was inside. I felt it. Cold air brushed the back of my neck, the unmistakable pressure of something standing just too close.

My phone rang again.

I didn’t want to answer. I knew I shouldn’t. I shouldn’t have answered. But I did.
Silence.

Then—

“Come outside.” 

I couldn’t breathe. It wasn’t distorted or harsh, no static, it wasn’t a man or a demon. It was me.

“You’re bleeding.”

My stomach dropped.

I touched my face, feeling the damp warmth. Blood seeped from my nose, thick and metallic, trickling down to my lips, my teeth ached. Pain blossomed in my skull as my vision spiraled.

“Come outside.”

The knocking stopped. The whispering stopped.

Everything stopped.

I don’t remember what happened after that. I woke up miles away from my apartment, standing barefoot in the middle of an empty parking lot. My phone was in my hand, but the call log was empty. My nosebleed had dried to my face, tightening the skin it painted, but the headache pounded deep behind my eyes, like something was inside my skull.

I don’t answer late-night calls anymore.

And if your phone ever rings at exactly 3:00 AM?

DO NOT PICK UP.
