Sorry for my weird english. Greek is my home language.

I was on the way to my work conference which was 9 hours from my home. I stayed in a hotel called Cross. When I went inside I was very tired from a 4.5 hour trip.

When I entered the hotel there were not many people and things were going smoothly. Before I went to my room I asked the receptionist why they called the hotel Cross. The employee ignored my question and told me "here is the card for room 66" I asked him "sorry I didn't hear" he told me "the card for room 66" I froze and said "66?" the employee replied "yes and now leave because I have a job" I said "sorry" and moved on.

 Why 66, isn’t that Satan's number but I kept going. I went to the elevator and saw that the restaurant was at -1 but my room was on the 6th floor. I thought weird but still kept going. I arrived at the room, I left my things on the table and laid down on the bed. I started watching a show for hours.

 At one o'clock in the evening I heard a sound from the bathroom manhole. I went to the bathroom and saw the manhole shaking. I noticed that the shaft was big enough for me so I took the chair and put it under the shaft. I climbed up the shaft.

 I went ahead and saw that he was going to a corridor that had a red light coming from one side. In the morning I went to a nearby shop and took a staircase. I returned to the hotel and hurriedly passed by the weird receptionist. I went to the room and noticed that the shaft was not there.

 I was going to stay another day so I thought I didn't have time. The day passed smoothly and I slept around 9 o'clock.

 One o'clock in the evening I heard a sound from the bathroom. When I went to check I saw the shaft. I took the stairs and started crawling into the shaft. I put up the stairs and went down the corridor. There was paranoia, there were a lot of people crying.

 One came up to me and said "run now that you can". I didn't understand what he was talking about and I ignored him. A short time later, on the same endless corridor, I saw something approaching me with his knees thrown high, I turned around and started running.

 My staircase was not there. A few minutes later screams and sirens began to be heard. I found a corner and hid there. When I came out, I saw that my staircase was in a room that had a bunch of objects.

 The door was locked and had a small glass to look inside. I broke the glass with my fist and some pieces of glass got into my hand but I opened the door from the inside and took my ladder. Inside I found a knife and took it.  

A man came at me and I stabbed him in the skull causing blood to spill on my white shirt. I took the ladder and put it under the manhole. I went up to the shaft and proceeded to my room.

 I got down from the shaft and fell uncomfortably on my sink making my throat hurt a lot. I broke my arm but I didn't notice it at the moment because of the adrenaline.

 I ran to the elevator and stepped on the ground floor. I went to the receptionist and told him "I want to talk to the manager" the employee asked "and why" I said "because of room 66" the employee petrified and said "come over here".

 I went to a room that had a lot of books and the manager asked me "what is sending you here" I said "66" he said "oh, you went to the shaft I said yes and my story. The manager said hesitantly that it was of my imagination. I went to the room, gathered my things, and left.

 Since then, I have never set foot there. It was weird how he didn't understand me when he understood what i was talking about. I think that they were hiding something.
