My name’s Frank Fitzgerald, I’m 23, and honestly, I’m not sure how to kick this off, so I’ll just dive in. I’m in my last year at Boston University, grinding through law school. It’s been a ride, lots of late nights, too much caffeine, the usual stress, but for the most part, I’ve enjoyed it. I wouldn’t call myself a social butterfly, but I’m not a hermit either. I stick to my circle, I live mine and let others live theirs, and I’m good with that.

Every now and then, my friends drag me out for drinks when they’re tired of my excuses. I don’t hate it, but I wouldn’t say I love it either. Alcohol helps, or at least they think so. Honestly, I’ve been doing okay, until recently. Things were moving along fine, and then family trouble hit. That kind of stuff has a way of pulling you right out of whatever reality you built for yourself.

It started with a call from my mom. Grandpa passed away. She told me herself, but the way her voice cracked… when she brought up dad I knew she was worried. He wasn’t handling it well. Grandpa and Dad were close, all the Fitzgerald sons are I guess. My dad named me Frank after my granddad, just like granddad did for him. I'm actually Frank the fourth, I guess? My dad’s the practical type, the guy who keeps things moving no matter what, so hearing how badly he was taking this? That threw me. Sure most would let the cracks show if their dad passed away but even knowing that it still felt off to see him so, vulnerable. He wanted me home to help clear out Grandpa’s house. My mom said the place was packed with stuff, grandpa was an avid collector of the weirdest things, I guess that's where my dad got it from and me. They wanted to box it all up, sort through it, maybe sell what they couldn't keep and put the house on the market.

I hadn’t been home in a while. Honestly, I’d been feeling a little homesick, so I packed light and grabbed the first flight out for NYC. When I landed, Mom was waiting at the gate, all hugs and tears like she always was. I love her for it, but man, it’s embarrassing at my age. Dad, though… Dad was different. Something was off the second I saw him. He hugged me warmly, sure but not like before. I don’t know how to explain it except to say it felt… practiced. Like he’d rehearsed what he was supposed to feel and forgot the lines halfway through.

Here’s the thing about my dad: growing up, he was the life of every room. He’s a nerd, through and through; comics, conventions, you name it. My defining childhood memories are of him dressed as some ridiculous superhero, dragging me along for photos with cosplayers. His laugh used to fill a place. But that day? He looked hollow. Eyes dulled out, skin pale, like someone drained the color from him. Even his voice felt muted. He smiled, but it didn’t reach his eyes.

The ride home was quiet. The kind of quiet that makes you stare out the window and count trees just to avoid the tension. And when we pulled up to the house… I swear, it was like stepping into a time capsule. Everything looked exactly the same as the day I left for school. The same posters on my bedroom walls, the same old game console hooked up by the TV even the sheets on my bed were the same Star Wars set I had when I was a kid. The whole house was spotless, too. Like, unnaturally spotless. It smelled faintly of lemon polish and something else,  stale, maybe? Like air that hadn’t been moved in years.

It’s funny. I always thought my parents hated change. Guess I never realized how far they’d take it.

 

Mom was over the moon to have us together for dinner. She made her beef stew, and it knocked me back to a simpler time, no all-night study sessions, no deadlines and all with just the smell. Everything felt like a throwback, but not in a comforting way. I kept telling myself Dad was just tired from the drive, maybe hungry. I hoped once he got food in him, he’d crack a joke, do his goofy eyebrow wiggle, something to break that heavy silence sitting between us like a third guest. But he didn’t.

Everything was the same. The same tablecloth. The same chairs. Even the conversation was stuck on repeat. Mom kept up the small talk, tossing out the usual safe topics: *“How’s school?” “You eating properly?” “Seeing anyone special?”* I gave her the same flat answers: good, yes, and no. I was happy to be home, I really was, but sitting there made my chest feel tight, like I was guest at a friend's house and we just heard their parents fighting. The entire scene was begging for us to return to normal but whatever tension dominated the space between us wouldn't let that happen.

I didn’t ask on the ride from the airport. Didn't ask when she called. But as I sat there, staring at the same pattern on the same tablecloth, the question just slipped out of my mouth before I even realized:

“How did Grandpa die?”

The room froze. The only sound was Mom’s fork scraping across porcelain like nails on a chalkboard. She stopped mid-bite and just… stared at her plate. The air got thick, and this quiet formed like a pressure against your ears. My heart pounded, like I’d broken some unspoken rule.

Grandpa was old, late 70s, so I figured the answer would be something like a heart attack, maybe a stroke. Hell, our family tree is basically a medical minefield. It wouldn’t have surprised me if it was natural causes.

Instead, Dad said one word.

*"Suicide."*

Flat. Just, flat.

He didn’t look at me. Didn’t blink. Just kept his eyes on the plate while the weight of it sank in. My head spun, trying to process what I’d just heard. Mom shot him a look, judgment? Alarm? I couldn’t tell.

Dad pushed his chair back, slow and deliberate, like every motion had to be measured. “We’re leaving early,” he said, voice calm in a way that wasn’t calm at all. “Get to bed early.” He leaned down, kissed Mom on the cheek, then rested a heavy hand on my shoulder.

*"I’m glad you’re here, Frankie."*

I nodded because I didn’t know what else to do. The word stuck in my head, burrowing itself down deep. Suicide. That was crap, right? Had to be. But if it wasn’t true… why would he say it like that? So final.

 

Sleep didn’t come easy. I ended up crashing on the couch because my old room felt like a museum exhibit, frozen in time and it felt wrong somehow. Maybe it was just the house, the way every shadow seemed too still. Or maybe it was me. Either way, I didn’t sleep well.

The dreams, if they were dreams, dragged me under hard. Heavy, like something pulling me through black water. When I finally ripped myself out, it was with a violent gasp, like breaking the surface after almost drowning. My chest burned. My head pounded. No matter how much air I sucked in, it felt like my lungs were filling with sand.

I stumbled off the couch, legs shaking, heart hammering like it wanted out. It took forever to calm down, to force my breathing into some ragged rhythm. That’s when I noticed it, the smell. Faint, but sharp. Like flowers. Sweet and earthy.

On my way to the bathroom, I tasted it. That’s what made me stop. Like dirt on my tongue.

The hallway was darker than it should’ve been. The only light came from a car passing outside, spilling yellow streaks through the blinds. That’s when I saw their door was open.

“Mom?” My voice sounded small, garbled. As if I was trying to speak underwater.

I edged closer. The smell hit stronger, sweet and copper now, heavy enough to leave an oppressive aftertaste. I pushed the door wider. The room was black, but when another car rolled by outside, the beam sliced across their bed and everything in me went cold.

They were lying on top of the covers. Arms straight at their sides, palms up, like offerings. Their skin shone wet in the fleeting light. Blood. All over them, it ran down their bodies and pool beneath them. So much it didn’t look real at first.

My feet moved back on their own. I hit the wall and slid down it, shaking so hard my phone almost slipped out of my hand. The screen lit the dark, and that’s when I saw it. On the headboard. Written in thick, glistening strokes that dripped like candle wax:

 

There was a Silent house,

Upon a Silent hill.

Beyond it lies a Silent village,

Full of Silent dreams.

A man crossed Silent waters,

To reach a Silent shore.

He walked into a Silent place,

And claimed a Silent Queen.

Now he wears a Silent crown,

Upon a Silent hill.

Beyond it lies a Silent grave,

Full of Silent souls.

 

All who sing a Silent prayer,

Kneel before their Silent King.

 

It was in their blood. I swear to God, it was written in their blood.

I managed to stand. My legs felt like rubber. I stumbled out to the porch, phone clenched so tight my fingers hurt, and called 911. I don’t even remember what I said, I just remember that the words sounded like they belonged to someone else.

The wait felt endless. I couldn’t tell you how long I sat there, just staring at the dew forming on the rail. When the cops finally came, the sun was bleeding up over the trees. They took my statement. I told them everything: I woke up, I saw them, I called. Over and over, like a broken record.

At the station, they asked if I had somewhere to stay. I said no, but even if I’d said yes, I couldn’t go back to that house. Not now. Probably not ever.

I got a call later from the attorney handling my granddad’s estate. Looks like all of that falls to me now. No brothers, no sisters. Just me. She sounded kind, said she knew my family well. I’ve got a meeting with her in a few days.

Tried calling a couple friends from school. All I got back was, *“Man, that sucks,”* and *“You doin’ okay?”* I didn’t even know what I expected, maybe someone to just come sit with me. But I couldn’t ask them to drop everything. Hell, I don’t even know what I’d say if they did.

So, I’m writing here instead. If anything else happens, maybe I’ll keep this thread updated. Maybe putting it down will help me keep my head straight.

Before I log off, I just want to say:

 

My father, Frank (Franklin) Fitzgerald

He was everything a son could hope for. A man of faith, a man of love. He taught me to be strong, to be kind, to believe in something bigger than myself: *“Be the change you wish to see.”*

Proverbs 20:7 – *“The righteous who walks in his integrity—blessed are his children after him.”*

My mother, Melanie Fitzgerald

The strongest woman I’ve ever known. She was the quiet anchor that kept our family from breaking apart. She gave her life to love us, and she never faltered.

Proverbs 31:28 – *“Her children rise up and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praises her: ‘Many women have done excellently, but you surpass them all.’”*

 

I don’t know what happened in that room. I don’t know why they were taken from me in such a horrific way. But I do know this: I will not let whatever this is destroy the memory of the two people who raised me.
