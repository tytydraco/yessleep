From what I know a family the early 19s came our here to live to escape what was going on in the world they wanted to live a secluded life. The family was of 8 people 4 children, 2 grand parents, a wife,and a husband. Don't know what happened but soon after shifting there the grandmother died then the grandfather at first no one thought much of it they died of old age maybe no one knows. Then the youngest child which ranged from the ages of 4-6 died she was buried in the back yard. The mother was, understandably, devastated so they tried have one more child she would get pregnant but the baby would never survive this happened again and again for at 7-8 times before the husband decided enough was enough and they didn't get pregnant again.

After she stopped getting pregnant 2 more children died the oldest still alive but afraid shifted in with his aunt and uncle then the husband died but the wife never left the house. People went and put food infront of the door which is how she lived. People say that she sat their weeping untill her last moments after her death people would food infront of the house and they would see her in the window of the house so they thought she was still alive maybe animals took the food or something but people didn't get to know she was died for almost an year.

Don't ever go in their" my grand father always said. A broken house, broken windows and maybe just in my head a fowl smell I never went close enough to the house to actually know if it had a bad smell.

I mean who would right? It sat in the middle of the woods in the middle of no where. 

Wellll I would and so would my friends. Me,  meg and Jen. On a Saturday night decided we didn't have anything better to do so we just walked around the town for a while "you know the cabin in the woods where no one goes to?" Meg asked " yea, what about it?" I replied we were always big on horror stuff and if it was a new story that emerged then listening to it wouldn't be that bad "how about we go in their?" Meg smirked as if she had struck gold. "Have you lost it" Jen spat out "oh come on" meg said "well it does sound fun" I joined in Jen blinked at us "oh yeah of course how fun would it be walking straight to our death" Jen rolled her eyes.
But after much convincing she finally agreed. So we went on our marry way to one of the worst night of our lives.

After reaching near the cabin I started to get cold feet. Maybe Jen was right I thought to myself, but I wasn't gonna admit it.

The house was broken and the windows shattered just what you would expect of an abandoned house.

But from the looks of it no one ever came here the walls still had pictured but they had blackened the bed still had sheets tucked in bu they had gone yellow and moldy but the worst part was probably the kitchen it stank of the rotten food the food that I guess people put out front but the mother of the family didn't eat either that much or at all the food was still on the counter rotting and the sink had 2-3 plates of what looked like unbeaten rotten food. "You should eat it" Meg teased Jen wasnt having it though she was still quite pissy with us. The smell  was horrible we didn't stay in the kitchen was long and once out I started to take deep breaths just then realizing I had been holding my breath.

Something was weird though a place like this should be infested with roaches but it wasn't no flies or anything. 

Then we went again to the living room. "Everything is so boring here" I said "nothing like we expected" Meg nodded "why are people so afraid of this plac-" she cut herself off "hey look" Meg grinned I didn't like it but still followed her trail of sight. "We should go in" Meg encouraged a door in the floor we didn't see earlier "was it their before?" I asked "No no it wasn't" Jen replied stairing at the door "it probably was their but we didn't see it" Meg rolled her eyes she was getting annoyed of us being scared "come on" before we could stop her meg had opened the door and went in Jen an attempt to stop her went after her.

I followed suit but before I could enter I heard a thud "oh shit" I walked towards the sound but no one was their just a book lying on the floor next to a window a perfectly new unaffordable window and a chair my thoughts went straight to the mother of the family she died here on that chair on that window. I wanted to throw up I was scared I wanted to go home but not with my friend inside that weird door thing.

I picked up the book and started flipping through it

The name on the book read margret

'We shifted into our new house I love it'

'I had a bad day'

'We went out'

'My mil died'

'My fil died'

'Angel died'

'I am pregnant'

'I lost the baby'

I skipped a few pages untill I came across one which read

'It was the door it isn't a basement I shouldn't have send my children their to play it's my fault everyone is dead that door comes back everyday to haunt me it is trying to kill i don't wanna die but I don't wanna live like this I miss my children my husband i want them back that demon took them'
That was the last entry.

That door was a one way ticket to hell I need to get my friends out. I went over to the door and started shouting "MEG JEN COME OUT COME ON LETS GET OUT OF HERE" No reply "COME ON" "THIS ISNT FUNNY" then i finally heard a cling a clang they came out running they shut the door "come let's get out if here" Jen said out of breath I put the book back on the chair and ran after them.

What they saw I don't know what happened down I don't know we never talked about it. Even years after we still never bring it up we just pretend it never happened I take my dog out to walk in the woods sometimes and I am half tempted to go back to look inside to read the book and maybe one I will
