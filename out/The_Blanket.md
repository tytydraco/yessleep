My wife returned from her business trip yesterday. For the most part I was happy. However, it would be wrong of me to deny that the absence of her in our house, gave me a sense of freedom, I don’t remember when I last experienced. Yes, as you might have already guessed, our marriage hasn’t really been a fairytale. Amongst the constant arguments and the innumerable attempts to mend the regrets, we have grown to hate each other a little more every day. But I do care about her, and so does she. Maybe that’s why I’m writing this.

She came in through the door handling all her luggage restlessly. She looked at me, and while I did not expect it, she exchanged a smile and hugged me, all while being completely drenched from the rain outside. I felt her warmth slowly crawling in my body, making me question did she at all miss me? Did I miss her? But some questions are best left unanswered. 

She rushed to the washroom to get changed while I ensured to have some tea ready by the time she returned. We had some conversations, nothing out the ordinary. It was late already and I figured it would be best for both of us to get some rest. But I couldn’t sleep. The nights haven’t been kind to me recently. But she was in a dreamworld of her own. Perhaps it was the result of all the exhaustion of travelling. I closed my eyes in a last fleeting hope of challenging my insomnia.

Next morning, I woke up to the soft glow of sunlight filtering through the curtains. Slowly sitting up, I decided to check on her. She was still sleeping with the blanket covering her little face. I did not want to disturb her, so I went on my way to complete my morning rituals. There was sense of refreshment in the air that I can’t really explain. I mean my sleep was as good as someone working a late-night shift. Still, somehow, I was feeling happier and rejuvenated. Perhaps all the meditations, the workout sessions and as the philosophers like to call it, “a positive outlook”, have really paid off.

After almost about two hours I checked our room to see that she’s still sleeping. I realized this is as better time as any. I pulled out my bag from underneath the bed, ensuring I have packed my essentials, my phone, and some decent amount of cash. I rushed to the main door and locked it from outside. I booked a cab and got on, requesting the driver to hurry. I was heading for the airport.

On my way, I started reminiscing about the day I met her. It has been ten years and honestly, who would have thought this is how it turns out. Life has its own way of testing you, right when you think you've found peace. Well, it’s too late now. I ensured that the lacerations in her throat were deep enough to end her life fast. I did not want to waste any time. I hid the blood drenched knife in the attic, far away from prying eyes. I did not mind spending the night with my dead wife lying beside my side. But I did not want to see her face her before leaving her for good; the blanket ensured that. I checked the time, and it felt this is where my life truly starts.
