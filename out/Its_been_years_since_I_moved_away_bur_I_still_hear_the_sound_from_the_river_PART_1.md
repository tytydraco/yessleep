When I was younger, maybe 7 or 8, it became a family tradition to go fishing every other Saturday. We would get on a canoe, and then fish in the middle of the river.

I looked forward to it every time, even though at first I hated it. I loved the sound of being in the middle of the river, hearing streaming water, and watching bugs climb rocks.

When I was 14, It was just like any other time. It was the middle of summer, I had actually started dating this girl, life was going great.

I heard a sound, but I don't even know how to describe it. It wasn't natural, it couldn't be produced by anything on this planet. I was so surprised that I fell off the canoe, into the river.

I almost drowned even though I knew how to swim from panic. The moment I went under, water rushed down my nose and into my mouth.

I hit my head on the canoe, so I was disoriented, trying to find out which way was up, my eyes burning.

My dad jumped into the water and saved me, but I was in such a state of panic that I almost strangled him.

Afterwards, I sat by the fire, wrapped in a blanket. My older brother was by my side the whole time, making sure I was okay.

We stopped fishing after that, and I'm glad. That experience changed me, according to everyone I knew. I didn't crack jokes, or hung out like I used to.

My girlfriend broke up with me not too long after, so you can imagine how it was like for me. Because of a single moment of surprise, my entire life changed.

When I turned 19 I moved out and went to college in Iowa, where I got a decent job in the city and live in an apartment.

Well, I heard the same noise coming from outside my window in the morning, and my heart stopped. I live on the third floor of my apartment, so I  almost choked on my breakfast.

At work I was visibly shaken, and my coworker, Paul, kept checking up on me. During lunch break I actually ate food in the same room as the rest of my coworkers, because I couldn't bare being alone.

After work, when I got home, I knew something was off. I locked the door behind me, and as soon as I did, I heard the noise, as if it was down the hallway.

I paused, straining to hear again. After a few minutes I heard it again. But it was louder, closer. I grabbed my phone, and tried to call 911, but my phone was fucking dead.

The sound came again, from right behind the door. I grabbed a butcher's knife, and locked myself in the bathroom. The sound came again, and I heard the lock on the door to my apartment slide open.

I plugged in my phone, which is how I'm typing this right now. Someone please help, I can hear it moving around my bedroom, and it's going to come for the bathroom next.
