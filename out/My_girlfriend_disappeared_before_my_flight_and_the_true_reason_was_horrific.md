Referring to the tittle my gf (19) disappeared before I (19) got on a flight back to my home country of Mexico, she first stop replying to my messages 5 days before the flight, and after two days I contacted her parents, her parents told me that they hadn’t had a reason to contact her since last week so they had no clue of what was going on, they also reached out but no response, 

the next night the second last night before my flight I saw something outside my window, as I sat in the dark watching Netflix, I walked over and it looked like her, I looked closer cupping my 
eyes to the window, her teeth were here sharp and dribbling with blood, her eyes fully black,  I wearily took a step back and she was gone moments later after a flash of light from the tv bounced of the glass preventing me from being able to see, 

I freaked out and got in my car, I drove to a friends house and slept the night, the next morning with my pre packed bags I took a cab to the airport and got on the flight, I spent two weeks in Mexico and I forgot about what I saw outside my window, when I returned home I instantly fell asleep jet lagged from the trip, my heart pounded as I woke up later in the night with some sort of weight on my back , I have never felt so horrified in my life, 

I pretended to still be asleep, until I heard a horrible gurgling sound and a sharp clawed hand caressing my face, I felt a shock of adrenaline so high I felt like i was going to pass out , I grabbed the entire mini night stand next to my bed and smashed it over the things head , I turned around quickly and saw my girlfriend her face now mangled from the blow of the table, a large crack in her head with what I thought was brain leaking out , she had the most horrifically unsettling grin on her face her eyes pitch black like I was staring into a void  , or some sort of dark demented soul , 

this was not my girlfriend anymore ok, I freaked out and pushed her off of me, she stood their unfazed she store right into my soul and said “what’s wrong honey you look startled”, in a fit or adrenaline and distraught I grabbed the corned post of my bed and ripped it off using it to beat her head in till she stopped moving, What she had turned into I honestly didn’t know , I buried her beneath a large rock in the forest and left, 

one memory that I’m sure never happened continues to run through my head to this day , a vision of her saying “black bug” right to my face as her insides vomit out of her mouth and her brain falls out of the open wound on her head from the table, can anybody tell me who or what she was, please I have to know
