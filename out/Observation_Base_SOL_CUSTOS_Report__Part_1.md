LETTER OF INTRODUCTION BY DR STEPHEN FALCON OF DIMENSION 0000001

Hello, this message is intended for the newly established Sol Custos of your dimension. Dr Alexander Reach, you have been appointed as chief observer of Sol Custos 888936. 

You must be wondering why you have been transported to a random space station hovering within very short distance of the Sun. Unfortunately for you, you will never be able to return to Earth. Any attempt to do so will be halted by Sol Custos. Sol Custos is a revolutionary inter dimensional space station designed by myself and the other humans of Earth 000001. It is operated by a copy of the original Sol Custos AI designed by Dr Albert Green, may he rest in peace, and will be your sole companion for the rest of your days. Your job is to use the devices present on the station to combat and eliminate any threat to the wider solar system, and mostly Earth. 

Do not attempt to contact us again. We will contact you if necessary

Stephen Falcon

The bot is forcing me to make this log because it's protocol or something, I don't know who I'm writing this for, I guess this is accessible from the other universes?

>!Wait a second, what does it mean by breach? Transmitting to... why is it transmitting to Earth? Does that mean people can read this? !<

>!If someone is reading this then I guess my AI made a mistake. At least this means I can have human contact. I wonder if I could make this a two way connection... I'll have to see later I guess.!<

>!And the dimensional transmitter isn't working either, what is wrong with this thing?!< 

What the hell is that beeping noise?

DISPLAYING LEVIATHAN INFORMATIONAL DISPLAY

By Dr Heath 

Fauna Researcher

Leviathans are one of the most common threats to Human civilisation. Needing no oxygen and being resistant to intense heat and cold, they are fully capable of living in space for their entire life. They consume matter from stars and a herd can devour a star fully in less than 3 Earth days. 

Leviathan's can be classified into 6 groups, Class 1 to Class 6

Class 6's are the smallest and weakest type, only being the size of a moon, and having no biological weapons. These are juveniles and make up a vast majority of the herd.

Class 5's are slightly bigger, reaching the size of a small planet and possess the ability to create gravity wells in their mouths to suck in biomass. They think of biomass as a delicacy and will attempt to devour any planet with lifeforms present.

Class 4's are significantly larger and possess no biological weapons. They are ambush predators and scouts, capable of turning invisible at will and being able to shatter planets with a flick of their tail.

Class 3's are the brood mothers of the herd, giving birth to 1000s of leviathans every year. They are larger than stars and are heavily protected by the herd.

Class 2's serve as soldiers and guards. Much smaller than brood mothers, they use glands present across their bodies to release intense radiation which takes away a cell's ability to function and kills it in less than 4 milliseconds, and can also force other leviathans to eject their hearts, killing them, in the case of riots.

Class 1's are incredibly rare. Usually only one is present in a group and it fathers the entire herd. They are larger than the Class 3's and consume much more. They can exhale pure heat, hot enough to destroy a solar system instantly. They are to be dealt with first in a herd attack.

CLOSING DISPLAY

Didn't ask for a fucking biology lesson but ok. Also the safety wheel program is a bit insulting don't you think?
