I found the apartment on a non-corporate listing site. It was one of those rare finds in a city where everything is owned by some faceless property group. Apartment 8A. An old, pre-war building with character. The rent was suspiciously low, but I was desperate, so I didn’t question it.

The landlord, a gaunt man named Mr. Corbin, gave me a tour. The place was perfect. Hardwood floors, high ceilings, a decent view of the brick wall across the alley. He handed me the keys with a single piece of advice. “The building is old,” he’d said, his eyes lingering on the floor. “The walls are thin. Just be a considerate neighbor.”

I considered myself one. I don’t own a TV. I listen to music on headphones. I walk, I don’t stomp.

The first note came three days after I moved in. It was on thick, cream-colored paper, slipped under my door. The handwriting was an elegant, spidery script.

To the resident of 8A,

Your constant tapping is a disturbance. Please be mindful.

Sincerely,  
7A

I frowned. I hadn’t been tapping. I’d spent the evening reading. I figured it was a case of mistaken identity and tossed the note.

A day later, another one appeared.

To the resident of 8A,

The sound of marbles dropping on the floor, one after the other, is maddening. It must cease.

Sincerely,  
7A

I don't own marbles. A chill went down my spine. I started to walk around my apartment on tiptoe. I laid down extra rugs. I felt like a prisoner in my own home, terrified of making a sound I wasn't even making.

The notes got more specific. More bizarre.

Please stop dragging the heavy chain across the bedroom.

The woman’s weeping is keeping us awake.

Your chanting is not appreciated at this hour.

I live alone. I’m a man. I don’t chant. I finally called Mr. Corbin.

“I’m getting these insane noise complaints from 7A,” I said, my voice shaking with frustration. “They’re accusing me of things I’m not doing.”

There was a long pause on the other end of the line. “Mr. Davies,” he finally said, his voice low and flat. “Is the resident of 7A asking you to stop?”

“Yes, of course, that’s what a complaint is.”

“Then I suggest you do whatever you can to stop. It is in everyone’s best interest that the resident of 7A remains… undisturbed.”

He hung up before I could reply. That’s when the real fear started. The fear was a cold, heavy thing in the pit of my stomach. This wasn't about noise.

The notes changed after that phone call. They weren’t complaints anymore. They were rules.

The first rule slip was waiting for me the next morning. Same cream paper. Same spidery script.

**Building Rules for Cohabitation (Unspoken)**

**1. Between the hours of 3:00 AM and 3:33 AM, you may hear a faucet running in your apartment, even if you are not near a sink. Do not investigate. Do not use your own water during this time. We are thirsty.**

I read it twice. My blood ran cold. We?

The next night, I was woken by the distinct sound of a dripping tap in my kitchen. It was 3:17 AM. I lay paralyzed in bed, listening to the plink... plink... plink... until exactly 3:33 AM, when it abruptly stopped.

Another rule appeared the next day.

**2. If you hear your own name said from the heating vents, do not respond. Do not acknowledge it. We are simply testing the walls.**

And the day after.

**3. From time to time, we may need to borrow a small item. A fork. A single sock. A photograph from a frame. You will not see it leave. Do not go looking for it. It will be returned, but it may be… different. Consider it a cultural exchange.**

I started sleeping with the lights on. I covered the vents with duct tape. I began cataloging every item in my apartment, my hands shaking as I counted my spoons, my socks, my memories.

For a week, I followed the rules. I was a ghost. I didn't use water in the dead of night. I ignored the faint, wheezing of "Jaaaames" that came from the radiator. I pretended not to notice when a photograph of my sister from my desk vanished, only to reappear on my nightstand a day later, her smile slightly too wide, her eyes subtly darker.

But last night, I broke one.

It was an accident. I woke from a nightmare at 3:10 AM, my throat a desert. Forgetting everything in my half-asleep stupor, I stumbled to the kitchen and filled a glass of water from the tap.

The moment the water touched my lips, every sound in the building stopped. The sound of the refrigerator. The sound of the streetlights outside. Even my own heartbeat seemed to fall silent.

Then, from the pipes in the wall, came a low, guttural gurgle. A sound of deep, disappointment.

I dropped the glass. It shattered on the floor.

The faucet in my kitchen turned on by itself. A thick, black, syrupy liquid oozed out, smelling of wet soil and grave-rot. It wasn't water. It was filth. It was earth.

And then I heard a new sound from below.

Scrape. Scrape. Scrape.

It was the sound of something dry and heavy dragging itself across the ceiling of 7A. No, not across. Up.

It was coming up the inside of the walls.

I scrambled for the door, fumbling with the locks. I had to get out. I didn’t care about Mr. Corbin, or the lease, or my security deposit. I pulled the door open, ready to sprint down the hallway.

There was a new note stuck to the outside of my door.

It just said: **YOU HAVE BEEN A VERY LOUD NEIGHBOR.**

My breath hitched. I peered through the peephole, expecting to see the empty hallway.

I wasn't looking at the hallway.

I was looking down. Down into Apartment 7A.

There was no furniture. No floor. Just a cavern of damp, black earth and tangled roots, coiling and writhing in the darkness like a nest of sleeping serpents. Something huge and pale shifted in the center of the room, turning what looked like a thousand tiny, sightless eyes up towards me, towards the sound of my life.

I slammed the door and locked it. The scraping sound is at my door now. A low, patient scratching. It smells like a freshly dug grave.

It's a host. A body. And 7A is its heart. The apartments aren't apartments. They are burrows, carved out for things to live in, side-by-side with its core. The "noise" it hears isn't me dropping marbles. It's my breathing. My heart beating. My life.

The scraping has stopped. It’s quiet again. For a moment, I feel a sliver of hope.

Then, I hear it. A new sound. Coming from the apartment above me. 9A. The unmistakable sound of a moving box being dropped on a hardwood floor. A new tenant.

My phone buzzes. It's a text from a number I don't recognize. Mr. Corbin.

"A new resident has moved in to 9A. They sound quite lively. Please ensure they understand the importance of being considerate."

My body moves on its own. I walk to my small desk, my legs stiff. I pick up a pen. I find a spare sheet of cream-colored paper I didn't know I had. My hand starts to write, the script elegant and spidery, and not entirely my own.

To the resident of 9A,

Your constant stomping is a disturbance…
