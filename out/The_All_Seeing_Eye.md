That’s what the townsfolk referred to me as, and what I was born with. I could see many things after all. I could see someone’s deepest secret, what truly lies within their heart, their sins, their past, and best of all, their future

Most of the town adored me, well, \*most\* of the town. Some didn’t believe what I was capable of doing. Thinking I’m a fraud. I didn’t care though. 

They would always come to me to ask for their desires to be foreseen

“Can you see if I will become rich and successful in the future?!”

“Can you see if my husband is seeing another woman?”

“Can you see how long I’ll last before the cancer kills me?”

They varied from greedy, to hopeful, to desperate. Sometimes they’d accept the outcome, sometimes they didn’t and would get upset at me, screaming that I was lying and pouring sweet honey into their ears. When that wasn’t the case, I told them what I saw. Eventually, they would leave, some of them were angry, and some of them were tearful.

That was mostly how things went. Well, until Derek Foley paid a visit. He was a popular figure within the community, a rich one. He was one of the many that didn't believe in my abilities.

So it was surprising to see him, and 4 men included, who I assumed to be his friends, visit me. Derek glared at me in a snarky & confident way. "I heard about you, about your little "tricks" and how you could "see anything", well lemme tell you something, that bullshit may work for those idiots, but it ain't going to work on me." He sneered. As if on cue, his friends giggled alongside his remark

"If you're just here to belittle me, please leave with your little associates," I said calmly. Derek just scoffed at my statement

"I'm not here just to insult you, I'm here to see if you're the real deal," Derek said with a cocky smile. I shrugged, he'll get what he came for, it all mattered on what he asked for.

"Sit Mr. Foley, and then you can explain what you want me to see for you," I said, gesturing at the seat in front of him.

He sat down, and I asked what kind of desire he wanted me to foresee. His response was common. Something that many previous clients had asked before. The only difference was that it was a little more specific

"I want you to see what my future is within the next 3 weeks"

"Is there a reason why you want to see your future?" I asked. Usually, there was something more to that request, but not this time. 

"Nah, I just wanna see for myself if you're what the town says you are. So Imma give you something simple”

"Then, let's begin, shall we?" I said. "Place your hands in a receiving manner, please"

Derek did so, and then I reached out my hands and placed them over his. 

"Now I will see what your future will be like in 3 weeks," I said, closing my eyes.

Then, I did my work, I looked through it until I saw it. I saw exactly what would happen to Derek in exactly 3 weeks.

And it was very interesting.

"I saw your future," I said, opening my eyes & relaxing my hands on my lap

"So lemme guess, nothing happens right?" Derek said that same cocky smile plastered onto his face, thinking I didn't see anything. I did though.

"On the first week," I began, "Your mother, father, and older brother's bodies will be found torn up and mutilated so much that they will almost be unrecognizable.

Derek and his friend's eyes widened at what I said. But Derek just scoffed.

"As if, you're only lying about that aren't-"

"On the second week, The friends that stand behind you will be found dead in the same brutal manner as your family."

Now their faces showed fear. Derek however still tried to hide through his confident facade. 

"You're just toying with me..!" He said, his cocky little smile remaining, but his eyes told a different story.

"On the third and final week, you will hide in your house. Constantly in terror over what or who killed your friends and family, and eventually, you will be killed in your own home, in the same, gruesome manner, as your loved ones.

Derek's friends were now whispering to each other, their faces slacked with confusion, disbelief, and terror. Derek on the other hand was still trying to convince himself that I was lying to him. He laughed.

"As if that will ever happen!” he said, before getting out of his chair.

"It will happen, Mr Foley," I spoke, in a cold tone this time. **"It will happen"**

He stopped for a few seconds, before scoffing. "C'mon boys, let's leave this little fraud to continue doing her business!" then they left.

*Week 1*

*Thursday*

I sipped my tea as I read the newspaper, the first headline capturing my attention.

**"3 MEMBERS OF THE FOLEY FAMILY FOUND DEAD WITHIN HOME"**

*It was a cool evening, at around 6:27 PM, and Derek Foley was just arriving home, only to discover the door was ripped open. Derek stumbled inside, only to find the mangled bits and remains of Lewis Foley, Kristina Foley, & Danny Foley strung up in the living room and into the kitchen. Bite marks were found around their torsos and abdomens. The entire scene was grizzly. Neighbors were soon alerted when they heard a scream from Derek. Police believe the incident to be a wild animal attack.*

A small smile grew on my face as I finished reading the front page.

*Week 2*

*Friday*

**"4 BODIES FOUND DEAD IN THE WILLOWVALE FOREST"**

*On a bright morning, a hiker named Gordon Porter was on his way through a trail, when he suddenly stumbled upon the mutaliated bodies of Jeffery Davila, Scott Kidd, Malik Archer, & Oren Daniels found strung up together in a grotesque pile. Just like the 3 members of the Foley family, they too had large bite marks on their torsos and abdomen*

As I finished reading the last word, the bell around the door chimed, indicating that someone was coming in. 

I looked up and saw the man himself, Derek Foley stepping in. His hair was messy, his collar was undone, and his eyes were full of paranoia. I could even see bags under them, meaning he probably hadn't slept in days.

"B-bullshit...It's all bullshit...." he said, stepping towards the table in front of me. "E-e-everything that happened... is just a stupid coincidence-e..." He stuttered as he gazed at me.

"It's not at all a coincidence Mr Foley," I said, my tone calm for the situation. I knew he would soon try doing something reckless. So I kept my composure.

"IT'S ALL JUST A FUCKING COINCIDENCE!" he screeched. Slamming his hands onto the table. I didn't flinch though.

"Mr. Foley, what is happening isn't just a coincidence," I began, "it's just the future unfolding. I had nothing to do with what is happening in your life right now. I can't help you out of this. You will eventually end up dying the same way your friends and family once did, and there is nothing you can do about it. Whatever, or whoever is killing them will come after you next." I stated, in a cold and stern tone.

"I'm sorry, but I suggest you leave now." 

We both stared into each other's eyes as I finished my sentence. I saw complete defeat within those eyes, with a mixture of terror, panic, and anger. His entire body was trembling.

"C-can you...at least tell me who's killing them...?" he asked. "C-c-can you tell me who's behind all of this.....?"

I shook my head.

With a quick movement, he lunged for me but suddenly stopped in his steps. His arms were reaching out to me as if he was aiming for my neck. He was planning to strangle me. I only stared at him. My eyes were full of dead calmness. Not a single other emotion within them. 

Derek let out a whimper, before running out through the front door and collapsing onto the pavement. He quickly picked up himself and ran away.

I didn't bother, and only readied myself for the next client that would soon come.

*Week 3*

*Saturday*

**"POPULAR FIGURE DEREK FOLEY FOUND DEAD INSIDE OWN HOME"**

*Derek Foley was well known within the community, however, ever since the murder of his friends and family, Derek had started to dive into insanity and paranoia. Always saying that there was something out to get him. That something stalked him during daytime and nighttime. Eventually, Derek had locked himself inside of his own home. Boarding up all windows in the process. When the police finally got in, the entire house was a mess. Blood and flesh were strewn across the walls and into the living room where what was left of Derek remained. Just like the last two incidents, Derek had bite marks all around his torso and abdomen. Police believe whatever killed him is connected to the deaths of his loved ones.*

I giggled as I finished my cup of tea.

I knew all along what was killing Derek & his friends and family. 

However, I don't think he would be able to process what I told him. 

If I told him that there are things in this world that humans cannot comprehend, and that I saw one of those things kill his friends and family. I don't think he would believe me.
