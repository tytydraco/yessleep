#                                  Portrait of (a) God

**“Be not afraid”**

Lo, thou hast asked of me to speak of that which hath no tongue, no breath, and yet speaketh louder than the heavens. If thou wouldst linger in thine understanding, let thine ears hearken unto the words of one who hath glimpsed the Portrait of God—that cursed canvas, whose lines stretch not within bounds of mortal frames, but pierce the veils of this world and the next.

It began, as all such tales of dread must, with a whisper in the dark. A whisper not of men, nor of angels, but of the spaces between, where neither light nor shadow hold dominion. In a forsaken chapel, cloistered by brambles that bled ichor when cut, there hung a painting. Its presence was not recorded in the annals of the faithful, nor sung by the tongues of men; it was as though the thing had hung there before the first stone was laid, before the first hymn was uttered.

The frame was blackened wood, carved with sigils that gnawed upon the edges of remembrance. No artist had signed it, for no artist could. The image was not wrought by hands of flesh and sinew but by forces older than thought, forces that dream not of creation but of vast undoing. And yet, it was a portrait—or so it seemed to the eye.

“What seest thou?” a voice once asked of me, the voice trembling with the weight of what it feared to know. For I had dared to look upon it, I, a fool of many books but little wisdom. And I beheld not a face, nor a form, but a blank, shadowed, ebony yet it bears an infinite chasm of shapes ever-shifting, a geometry that bore no allegiance to the natural order. Its visage was the birth and death of stars; its gaze the unblinking void that drinks the light of galaxies; Archaic than the waves of particles that sparked form in the universe.

I saw, too, a hand, if such it could be called. It reached out—not from the painting, but into me. Its touch was neither warm nor cold but a sensation beyond sensation, and with it came the knowing, the terrible knowing. It is not we who have shaped God in our image, but we who are shadows cast by its unknowable form. Our lives, our loves, our deaths—all but fleeting echoes of its eternal, alien breath.

“Turn away, lest thou be unmade,” cried my companion, but their voice was naught but wind against the thunder of its being. For the longer I looked, the more the painting grew. Its frame swallowed the walls of the chapel, the stars beyond the roof, and the heavens beyond the stars. It devoured time, unweaving the moments that had brought me to stand before it. I felt myself unwritten, an ink-blot erased from the pages of the cosmos.

And yet, it was not wrath that emanated from the Portrait, nor pity, nor love, nor hate. It was a stillness so vast it pressed upon the soul, for it was a stillness born of understanding—an understanding that all things are as dust before the breath of God. To look upon it is to know that thou art naught but a fleeting question in an eternal silence.

I fled, though I know not how, for time and space had ceased their orderly march. I awoke far from the chapel, the painting, and yet I bear its mark. For in the deepest hours of night, when the world doth slumber, I feel its gaze still upon me. And when I close mine eyes, I see the Portrait of God, waiting, growing, devouring.

Let it lie where it dwelleth, beyond the grasp of mortal folly. For to behold it is to glimpse eternity—and eternity is a void wherein even gods do tremble; it is the silence that waits between heartbeats.
