[Part 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ofaikc/disembodied_podcasters_are_recapping_my_haunting/)

I’m ok, guys. I’m running on caffeine and hitting myself in the leg every so often to try and stay awake.

I’m hanging out at the library for the time being. I’ve seen homeless people here before, and the staff won’t let them sleep here. I can use the computer, and hopefully being around people means no more haunting. Isaac and Harris haven’t said anything for a while so that’s good too.

Wait a sec. Some guy just walked into the library wearing a black shirt that says, “It’s right behind me, isn’t it?”

Give me a sec. I'll update the post later.

...

That guy’s name is Todd. Todd was the editor of ScareTare, a horror story podcast. So I walked up to him, and he was super surprised that I knew about Isaac and Harris. Seemed pretty spooked, actually. I asked him where I could find them. Get this: they’re dead. They died filming an episode of their podcast. So now they’re ghosts haunting me! Everything they’ve ever recorded got scrubbed from the internet. I asked Todd for more info, and he must have smelled the desperation on me, because he gave me a flash drive with all the episodes of footage, including the final one.

I was about to watch it when the library closed. I thought, *ok, go to Walmart or something and walk around. I’ll go back to the library tomorrow.* So I drove to Walmart and parked, but I was so tired. I had the key to my salvation in my pocket. I could figure this out. And I was so tired. I hadn’t slept in a day. My front seat was so comfy. I forgot all about my haunted house and the poltergeist and my sleep paralysis demon. And I fell asleep like a fricken moron. Leaned back in my seat and everything.

My eyes flicked open. I couldn’t move. The demon was in the car seat next to me. Her legs slid over my chest, the darkness of her eyes making the wrong-blue streetlights of the Walmart turn to black. She smiled with horrible teeth. The weight of a truck stole my breath, crushing my diaphragm. My ribs should have all shattered. She drew back both hands, eyes full of pleasure. I prepared myself for her to shove her hand down my throat, but she didn’t.

She pointed both index fingers upward. Their surface elongated and morphed into points. She brought each hand to the side of my head, letting the strange flesh caress my temples. She stuck them into my ears.

The immense pain of my eardrums rupturing exploded through my head. All my hearing vanished and the world went silent. Her face exploded with pleasure. The fingers split and branch like roots, strange flesh surrounding my brain matter. I felt like my brain would be crushed like a fruit, like my skull would explode from the inside. The pressure on my sinuses made me want to sneeze but I couldn’t breathe. My eyes bulged out of their sockets. My brain was telling everything to spasm and yet nothing would move. She still held my gaze, and with every pulse of my heartbeat, every impulse of fear, the look of hunger satiated and her smile grew wider. My whole body was frozen in the tension of inactivity for hours. I couldn’t escape. I waited for my head to explode, for my body to lose feeling. I couldn’t hear, couldn’t balance, and the world spun and spun, but at the center was her, and I couldn’t escape. I couldn’t escape.

But then I was awake, back in the parking lot. I could hear rain pattering on the window. My brain felt like it might collapse like a crashing blimp if I tried to focus on anything. Every color shone too brightly, every texture felt too sharp. The smell of vomit overwhelmed me. I gasped for air. And all I heard is Isaac saying,

“Dude, that was next level.”

Hunter sounded impressed. “Yeah, man, I think the author really stepped it up. I was expecting the same thing, or maybe that it stays confined to the house and he has to go back and face it or something, but now it’s gotten even worse.”

Isaac mirrored his tone. “Oh man, yeah, imagine, just, like, it’s grabbing your brain and squeezing.”

“Yeah, dude, worst headache and hangover ever.”

Isaac sounded like he was about to laugh. “Would you let your wife do that to you?”

“Dude she can touch my brain anytime.”

“Eww, what?”

“Yeah I’d let her stick her fingers in my ears and play around with my balance.”

“Anything for a goth girlfriend, I guess.”

“You’ll understand when you get to be my age.”

“You’re like, five years older than me.”

“Yeah that’s ancient history. Were you even born before 9/11?”

I don’t remember the rest of what they said. It made my brain hurt so bad to try and listen. I’ve got to figure this out. I’m back at the library. I’m going to watch the video even though this headache is killing me.

Shit. There’s blood coming out of my ears. Need hospital.
