My hometown loves Halloween festivals. It seems like every civic organization and business has its own little carnivals. Costume contests, cake walks, apple bobbing. The whole nine yards.

My personal favorite was always the Scarecrow competition at Hidden Spring Cave Park. Until last year, that is. 

I don’t think the town will ever host it again.

Every school in the district and even a few businesses would create a scarecrow and enter it in the contest. Hidden Spring Cave was a local landmark in town that featured a cave, natural spring, and walking trails for the community to use.

Every October, Hidden Spring would take all of the scarecrows and place them throughout the walking trails. Joggers and families out for a stroll would walk through and admire the hard work and creativity of each one. At the end of the trail, there was a ballot box to leave votes. Whichever scarecrow received the most votes by Halloween would be awarded a hundred-dollar prize.

One entry was selected by a panel of judges for the grand prize: five hundred dollars and a picture on the front page of the local paper.

Last year, I was selected to sit on the judging panel. My family had owned a local florist shop for decades which I had taken over after my father retired. Most of the judges owned small local businesses. Sponsoring or volunteering was free advertising.

The week before Halloween and dozens of scarecrows lined the paths inside the little park. Most of the early entries were produced by the local elementary school classes. A few high school art classes would submit to a scarecrow but I guess the older kids kind of outgrew the contest.

While we didn’t make our final decision for the grand prize until the day before Halloween, I would usually take a walk on the trails to check for new entries each day. Most of them were your run-of-the-mill scarecrows. Straw hats, an old plaid shirt, and work gloves. 

A few others were low-effort with t-shirts and Halloween masks. 

The standout that year was entered by James Sterling, a local dermatologist. Well thought of in the community but rarely seen in public anymore. His wife had an affair and left him earlier in the year. The once vibrant man became a recluse. 

As I strolled the paths, I saw his name on a sign below one of the scarecrows. It made me happy for a moment to see he was getting out and about again. My happiness turned to discomfort when I saw the scarecrow. 

It was… too well made. 

The skin was made of rough burlap and it clung to the frame beneath to form an almost perfect face. Sharp cheekbones sat beneath the black button eyes. The arms and legs stretched into a T that me feel as though I were looking at a crucifixion. 

The clothes were also a bit strange. Stretched over the anatomical frame were a blue silk blouse and a pair of white clam digger pants. Both were in excellent condition and seemed too nice to use for a project like this. 

As I walked away, it almost seemed to watch me as I left. The figure haunted my mind for the rest of the day. I loved the scarecrows on the trail, but Dr. Sterling’s entry was too realistic for my comfort. 

As the days passed, the burlap effigy only became more disturbing. Scarecrow wasn’t an apt name for it. The figure seemed to do the exact opposite. 

When I would pull into the parking lot for the next few days, swarms of birds would be circling over the woods ahead of me. Just a handful on the first day, but by the second and third, there were dozens. 

They swooped and circled above the trails. Dozens more sat perched in the trees lining the entrance to the trails. Caws and shrieks filled the air, piercing the usual serene atmosphere of the park. 

Crows. Ravens, maybe. I couldn’t tell. Flat, black, hateful birds whatever they were. I was nervous to walk past or below them. They would cry out wildly and flutter their wings anytime someone walked nearby. 

On the trail, it became even worse. 

The farther in I made it, the thicker the flock of birds grew. If you couldn’t see them, you could hear their hateful racket. It was almost as if they were waiting to strike. My heart pounded and I felt the fear of a small child lost in the woods.

Dr. Sterling's scarecrow was the pinnacle for the dark visitors. The outstretched arms and head of the dummy were covered in the damn creatures. They perched in a neat line. Some cawed while others pecked at the increasingly ragged burlap face. 

If you drew too close to the scarecrow, the birds would flap their wings or take flight, darting above your head. A few would swoop so closely you could feel the wind rustle through your hair. A chorus of evil things would cry out from the trees until you moved away.

And there was that stench. It was the fetid smell of decomposition.

The cluster of obsidian birds must have killed something in the woods nearby. I had never been one to pay much attention in biology class, but I always thought crows and ravens were carrion birds. Maybe they were hunters. I couldn’t have been sure. For the smell to have been that intense, they would have had to kill something nearby.

Trail walkers were at an all-time low that year. I don’t know if it was the birds, the smell, or the disturbing scarecrow. My guess was a combination of the three. Something had to be done.

I called a few of the judges to share my concerns about the disturbing scarecrow and birds but their responses shocked me. Most of them, while equally disturbed by Dr. Sterling’s creation, thought it was the best one in the contest. Yes, they agreed it was off-putting, but that was no reason not to consider it. Before I could even recommend its removal, they stated their intentions to vote it the grand prize winner.

As a last-ditch effort, I tried calling Dr. Sterling himself. Every time I called his office the automated voicemail system would pick up. I left a few messages and even called the emergency number but never received a call back from him.

On Halloween Day, I arrived at Hidden Springs and parked my car in the tiny lot. The other judges were waiting at the trailhead and I joined them. We talked amongst ourselves as we began to walk through the path and jotted notes on our clipboards.

We were the only ones on the trail.

The flock of birds was as thick as I had ever seen them. Occasionally I would jump or stumble as one darted above our heads aggressively. The other judges reacted similarly but no one verbalized their obvious concern.

Shrieks and caws filled our ears as we neared the midway point of the trail. Dr. Sterling’s scarecrow came into view. It was covered with crows. The blue blouse hung in tatters revealing the disturbingly accurate burlap torso beneath. Ragged swaths of cloth dangled from the face as the birds pecked madly.

As we grew closer the murder of crows bolted from the scarecrow’s limbs and landed in the trees. They cried out toward us but kept their distance. Most of Dr. Sterling’s creation was in ruins. Mauled and shredded by the hateful creatures.

We all stood before the scarecrow. Our banter disappeared completely as we looked on. With most of the burlap peeled away, the frame beneath was now visible.

A human face sat wrapped in frayed cloth. Shredded flesh flopped away from the white plastic mannequin head below. Crusted blood covered the underside of the skin.

The crime scene technicians removed the scarecrow from the trail within fifteen minutes of our call. Detectives questioned us for hours, but none of us had any useful information to give them. Dr. Sterling’s scarecrow had been there for nearly a week and none of us were there when he had put it out.

According to the newspapers in the following weeks, the search of his house produced an abundance of information, but nothing led to his whereabouts. Most of his clothing and all of his identification was gone. He had left his dog with a neighbor saying he had to travel out of town for business.

He hasn’t been seen since.

The last thing they found was an old chest freezer in the basement. It was chained and padlocked, but the officers made short work of it with a pair of bolt cutters.

When they opened the lid, they found what was left of [Mrs. Sterling.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gtripp14/comments/uyezti/making_it_easier_to_keep_track_of_my_new_releases/)
