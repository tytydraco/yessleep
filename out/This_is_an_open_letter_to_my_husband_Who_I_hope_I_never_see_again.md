It feels a little weird posting something *this* personal online where anybody can see it. But right now, I need to know someone out there is listening. That they hear what I have to say. Even if it’s just a complete stranger on the internet.

So, here is an open letter to my husband. Who I’ll (hopefully) never see again…

\--

Dear Andrew,

I’m writing to you because this past year has been a nightmare for both of us, and Dr. Parker doesn’t think you’ll remember much about it. Please know I am not doing this to hurt you, but if I don’t jot my thoughts down now, I may never get the chance.

My memories surrounding *the incident* aren’t much clearer than yours. Anytime I sit down to write them out, it feels like I’m suffocating. Black smoke clouds fill my brain and I hear a loud wail. But hopefully by soldiering through I can help us both come to terms with what happened.

Now, to say I was worried about how you dealt with your grief would be like saying the outfits in Rings of Power *mildly* annoyed you. In therapy, you clammed up insisting everything was hunky dory, and if the psychologist even touched on the subject of Noah, you got defensive and stormed out early. Whenever Tim and RJ came over, you all played Mario Kart and drank beer, and never talked about anything deeper than the latest minifigures you were painting.

If not for the scars—along with that nasty chain-smoking habit you picked up—I could have pretended you were still the charming trainee costume designer who took me out for dinner. I remember saying I always wanted to be an artist and begging you to tell me more about a Cosplay you were designing for a client.

The ‘mental collapse’, as Dr. Parker calls it, didn’t start until you went back to work. They were shooting some fantasy film and you wanted to keep busy.

From what I remember, you got into a screaming match with the actor who starred in that Sci-fi movie. Something about him getting his cloak filthy. The outburst probably would’ve destroyed your career if the producers didn’t like you so much.

(If it makes you feel better, the entire cast and crew have since signed a ‘get well soon’ card.)

This is the point where *my* memories come back into focus. Which, knowing what I do now, isn’t super surprising.

The signs the loss was tearing you up inside became impossible to ignore. You did repairs on the house and decorated Noah’s room *exactly* as it was before. And you must have crammed half a million costumes into your basement workshop, each dangling from sliding rails standing around the room, organized by colour and size. Those new figurines lining the shelves also worried me—at one point I thought maybe you planned on opening some sort of toy museum.

Rather than restart those tired arguments about the way you obsessed over your projects, I kept my lip buttoned. Even when the flurry of packages started landing on our doorstep.

Meanwhile, your full-time profession became hovering over me. You haunted me like a shadow. I couldn’t go anywhere alone. It’s like you were terrified I’d die if you lost sight of me for more than five minutes.

I fooled myself into believing this was a sign of a healthy relationship. That this was just your protective nature.

I was in bed when the first ‘encounter’ happened. I thought you’d prodded me in the ribs, so I swatted your hand away.

Another prod. Annoyed, I reached for the lamp. Before I could grab it, I saw your face in the darkness. You were hunched beside the mattress grinning like a Cheshire cat.

“What the hell are you doing?” I asked.

In a shrill, high voice, you said, “I can’t sweep. Wead me a stowy.”

I sat against the headboard as though jerked up by invisible strings and flicked on the light.

And that’s when I screamed. Because you were holding…*it*.

*It* seemed to stare back at me. Forever smiling away.

You pinched the bridge of your nose and said, “Noah, it’s wayyyy past your bedtime buddy. I’ll read you one quick story and I don’t want to hear any complaining.”

My throat sealed itself shut. “Andrew…” I rasped.

You looked over at me, sighing. “I know, I know. We should reinforce him sleeping alone. But just this once.”

I took a longer, closer look at the little imposter. It had arms, legs, and even a neck that could be manipulated. You’d dressed it in our son’s Buzz Lightyear pyjamas. But it wasn’t Noah. Noah had my blonde-hair and your grey eyes. The lifeless *thing* in your arms had neither.

“Stowy,” you said again in that awful voice.

Thick, billowing smoke seeped into the room. An alarm shrieked at the back of my mind until I squeezed my eyes shut, blanking out the wail.

You chuckled. “Okay. Say goodnight mommy.”

“Goodnight momm-eeeeeee.”

With that, you carried *it* off down the hall into Noah’s old room.

Lying there, I could barely breathe. I remained perfectly still until you slid in next to me and said, “Little rascal finally nodded off.”

As your arms closed around me, I stared at the ceiling, praying this was all some terrible joke.

In the following weeks, you dipped in and out of this little fantasy. For two or three days, you’d work on Etsy commissions, vacuum the lounge, and call your mother like normal. If your workshop hadn’t reeked of cigarettes things would have been just like before.

Then, out of nowhere, you’d set three places at the dinner table, pull up a chair for the ‘stand-in’, and say halfway-through our meal, “Noah, if you don’t eat your green peppers, I’m taking away your Switch.”

Every time I tried telling you Noah died, it became impossible to talk. So instead, I hinted at the accident. “Did the insurer call back about the settlement fee yet?”

Those marks along the right-side of your face turned from red, to purple. Your clenched fist slammed against the table, hard enough to make the plates bounce.

“Uhh, are you excited about house of the dragon?” I asked quickly. That softened you. Although for the rest of the night you stomped around with a sour expression, compulsively fidgeting with a zippo lighter.

I realized there were scars on your brain, worse than the ones on your body. What would happen if I piled on the pressure by shattering the illusion? I’d already lost a child. I didn’t want to lose a husband too.

Besides, I had my own selfish reason for maintaining the charade…

Our days fell into a horrible pattern. We ate together, you me and *it*, and played around the garden, you orchestrating the little imposter to swing a tennis racket, or kick a football. You had the time of your life out there.

One afternoon, I found *it* half inside the fridge, ice cream smeared across its horrible, smirking face.

“Noah, are you sneaking more treats before supper?” you asked, your hands on your hips.

I wanted to scream—to tell you to drop the act. But anytime I tried speaking up, my breathing became hyperventilation.

By staying quiet, I let you tumble further into this delusion, which meant soon you *insisted* we take a family trip to the playpark.

I watched from the bench as you walked the fraudster up the ladder onto the climbing frame. There were three kids up there in the tube tunnel.

When they saw you play with fake-Noah, babbling in that creepy voice, the oldest girl grabbed her friends, dragged them down the slide, and raced toward their parents, whose expressions were an unhealthy mixture of disgust and worry as they gathered their things and made a b-line for the gate.

Meanwhile, you stood in the little lookout, bouncing our stand-in son up and down.

Later that afternoon the police appeared at our door, and you spoke with them alone. When I asked what they wanted, you shrugged and said, “Wrong house.”

I can only guess your recent ‘hero’ status counted for something around the village, otherwise you’d have got carted off to the nuthouse.

During our afternoon strolls, heads kept snapping in our direction. Even whenever you didn’t insist we bring counterfeit Noah along. People who used to invite us to their BBQ’s now crossed the street to avoid us. I’m guessing the store clerks you interacted with kept their opinions to themselves because they sympathized with the tragedy of your situation. Or maybe they were afraid all 6’5” and 23 stone of you might have lashed out if they said anything.

Soon RJ and Tim stopped by for an intervention disguised as a friendly visit.

I didn’t get involved. Harsh truths sounded better coming from impartial observers, I told myself. So, passively, I watched the scene unfold from the sofa.

RJ must have known you’d fly off in a tailspin if he pushed too far too fast, so he danced around the problem for an hour, asking when you planned on going back to work, about your newest orc figurines, and whether you planned on getting Baldur’s Gate 3 when it came out.

Tim said, “You know that scar makes you look kinda tough. We should head out for a few pints. We’ll tell the ladies you’ve got a badass backstory, like a 3D printer exploded in your face.”

You chuckled. “Well, it’d be a bit unfair on Vicky.”

Tim’s eyes flicked toward me. “Unfair?”

“Well, I know *you* wouldn't know this being chronically single and all, but parenting is a team effort. I can’t just run off and leave her to do all the work alone, can I?”

“And by *work*, you mean…what, put Noah to bed?”

“Do I have some other kids I’m not aware of?”

There was a long, tense pause.

Tim finally said, “Look, I’m just gonna rip the Band-Aid off here.”

RJ stepped forward, but Tim shook him off. “Andy, I’m really, really, *really* sorry for what you’re going through. I love you like a brother, but this is psychotic. You need to speak with a therapist and get on some horse tranquillisers or something because I can’t watch you put yourself through this.”

“What are you talking about?”

“I’m talking about you playing house here in cloud-cuckoo land. I’m surprised they haven’t locked you up in a padded cell yet.”

You were on the verge of headbutting your concerned friend until RJ stepped in.

I kept quiet, my throat seizing up. I looked around the room, studying the scorch marks where the walls met the ceiling. Everybody started shouting, so I let myself disappear into the smoke, and when it faded, you were alone in the armchair fidgeting with your lighter.

Over the next few weeks, the mental shield you’d built for yourself started to crumble. You’d argue with your own reflection or stub out cigarettes on the back of your own hand. More than once you used your Noah voice to ask what I wanted for dinner, then your own to beg for a chocolate biscuit. If I didn’t correctly guess who you were meant to be each time your jaw would clench, tight.

IT would wake us up in the morning, demanding chocolate cake for breakfast. And every time one of the inevitable father/son arguments played out, I became more and more convinced our relationship would end with a missing persons report.

How did I snap you back to your senses, though? Words alone weren’t going to make you better.

Some neighbourhood teens gave me my brilliant idea. On our way back from the grocery store, a boy in a beige tracksuit approached us while his friends watched from across the street.

Cradled in his arms, was his own version of…*it*. Not identical, but just as creepy. The adults may have wanted to steer clear of you, but kids will be kids.

As the boy approached, he looked at the Noah-imposter and said, “Oh wow, what an angel. My wee girl just said her first words, listen.” He held the thing out and then, like a ventriloquist, mimed the words: *Dada.*

It took you a moment to stop grinding your teeth and shoulder past him, your expression neutral.

“Hey Two-face, maybe we can setup a playdate?” the little shit shouted after us.

Back home, you chain-smoked and cried. Then, you stared at your lighter for hours on end.

For the first time in a long while, you didn’t haunt me like a ghost. I had time to myself.

I thought about running away—about leaving forever.

But I couldn’t. Without you, I had nothing. I *was* nothing.

Luckily, your unhinged reaction gave me an idea.

I worked on my ‘secret project’ while you were asleep. Or off in your own world. Oh sure, I was no artist before we met, but I’d picked up a few tricks during our decade together. At times it almost felt like you were working through me.

Whenever you were close by, I faked the smiles and played the role of doting mother. We’d stop at McDonalds and order an extra happy meal, then back home, you’d prop the substitute on your lap while you both painted skeleton minifigures. Seeing how you heaped praise on *its* work, the same way you used to with Noah, made my heart ache. It made me think of my own parents. As a kid, I remember I once drew a crayon picture of me and my mom, and she just sneered and said, “It’s too ugly to put on the fridge.”

Knowing our pretend family’s days were numbered only made it hurt all the more to work on destroying it.

I soon had everything ready, but a series of random panic attacks kept me from carrying out my plan. Out of nowhere I’d find myself suffocating on imaginary fumes.

Even though I was still in denial, a deeper part of me knew *why* my body reacted this way. Why I kept delaying things. Again and again, I told myself: *maybe tomorrow, maybe tomorrow.*

If not for the brawl at Victoria Park, I might have carried on with your ‘pantomime’ forever.

We’d gone for a walk, ignoring all the odd stares. As usual.

We marched through the forest encircling the football pitches until you made me and Noah pose for a photo beside a giant oak tree. That’s when the teenagers approached us.

The troublemaker from before strolled up and said, “Hey, we’re playing a game of five-a-side and one of our mates dropped out. Does your son fancy filling in?”

His buddies elbowed each other in the ribs, laughing away.

“We’re having a family day. Excuse us.”

“Aww come on. I bet he’d be lightning up front.” The kid darted around you and bent forward, grabbing *it* by the arm. “C’mon kid, we can—"

Already choking on fumes, I let the smoke carry me away. When I came back you were screaming, “DON’T EVER PUT YOUR HANDS ON MY SON.”

The punk lay flat on his back, the front of his tracksuit stained dark crimson. There was blood splattered across your knuckles, too.

You grabbed me and Noah and dragged us toward the bridge. Those shocked teens gave us plenty of space as we stormed past.

You cried the entire way home. In the lounge, you cradled me and *it* against your chest and kept kissing us on the forehead saying, “Everything’s okay now.”

But there was no mistaking the fear in your voice. The uncertainty. Your shaky hands lit another cigarette.

I hated myself for delaying the reveal this long. You could have killed that boy.

At the far end of the hall, the doorbell rang. You jumped up, flicked off the lights, and pretended we were playing a quiet game.

All night you paced around the house, mumbling to yourself. Now and again, you went and threatened your own reflection, or lightly banged your head against the wall, or waved your palm above the flame of the lighter.

I waited until you next ‘lost focus’ before I slipped away and got everything ready.

You woke up alone in our bedroom. You called my name, tearing apart the top floor of the house. In Noah’s room, there was another empty bed. Now *you* were the one having trouble breathing.

I shouted, “We’re down here. In the workshop.”

You flew down the steps and pushed open the door. Then, you froze.

In your little sanctum, ten ‘Noahs’ lay scattered around. Two sat in front of the TV, Switch controllers on their laps. Four sat in a circle playing marbles while others painted a model of a dragon. One even lay on the sliding coat hanger. They were indistinguishable from one another, each dressed in our son’s pyjamas, each doing activities the real Noah loved doing with his father.

You stood there, your chest going up and down in giant heaves. You looked as though you couldn’t decide whether to cry or lash out. In the silence, the ragdolls felt quite spooky.

You went and snatched the closest one, tossed it aside, grabbed another, flung it over your shoulder. I’d taken care to make them all identical. I could see by your expression how much this hurt. You couldn't pretend they were all alive.

You ran over and lifted me up off my feet. “What the hell is this?”

Your fingernails dug into my arms. You were crying.

I said, “Andrew, I love you, but this can’t go on.” I needed to pause. To take big, shuddery inhales. “Eleven months ago, there was an accident.”

“No,” you said, more to yourself than me. I closed my eyes. Breathe breathe breathe.

Making my voice soft, I said, “There was a horrible accident. Right here in this house.”

Because your throat was all choked up, you couldn’t shout me down.

I said, “It was an electrical fault. It started upstairs. You were down here, working on a commission. You had your headphones on.”

“Please stop,” you said, now struggling with your Noah imitation. “Please.”

“…And you didn’t hear the alarm until the flames had already spread.”

I waited for the emotional outburst. One big explosion, you’d hit rock bottom, then we could pick up the pieces.

Instead, your body relaxed. You grabbed your lighter out of your pocket, ignited it with a roll across your leg, and then held it under the garments hanging from the closest rail. A Captain America costume caught fire, quickly spreading to the wall.

A painful memory crept up. Fire, fire everywhere. An alarm blaring as black smoke invaded my mouth and nostrils.

You turned around, smiling, and I realized then that you wanted to die.

I forced myself to stay away from the smoke. If I blacked out now it would all be over.

Flames raced around the room, up the walls. The figurine army melted, as did the Noah gang. Their cloth skin burned fast, the little faces warping, blackening, shrinking, distorting. Soon there were just scorched plastic eyeballs looking up from piles of ash.

I said, “You ripped your headphones off and ran upstairs and found me in the hall. I had Noah in my arms. You were almost blind from all the fumes. My skin had already boiled.”

You buried your head in your hands. I rubbed your burn scars and made you look me in the eye. “Andrew, it’s time you faced reality. Noah and I…”

“No,” you said. “NO.”

“…we’re dead. We’re dead and we’re not coming back. And you have to get out of here NOW.”

With that, I collapsed in your arms. A lifeless doll dressed like your dead wife.

Now lucid, I saw the flames through *your* eyes. The entire room was burning, along with the hall. For a moment, you considered rescuing the ragdolls, but the bubbling flesh across the soles of your feet snapped you to sense. You stumbled toward the door, unable to see.

You crashed against the sidewall. You clawed your way along. The alarm continued to wail.

Even now part of you wanted to stay there. To lie down and let yourself burn to death so you could reunite with me and Noah. But the part of *me* that wanted you to live forced you to keep moving. So your hand reached out and felt around until it found the bottom step.

After that, there’s another black spot in your memory. Then you were in the ambulance.

An oxygen mask covered your face, your lungs ached, and every inch of your skin had already started blistering.

But you were still alive.

\-

The next few weeks are a giant blur. At the clinic, you sometimes spoke in Noah’s voice. Or mine. But with the right medication and intense therapy, the delusions started wearing off.

And now I think you’re well enough for some tough love.

Noah and I are gone, and we’re never coming back. But the fire was not your fault. In fact, you charged upstairs to save us. I think that’s why the neighbours gave your breakdown some leeway—because you’d heroically dragged your dead family out of a burning building.

But you couldn’t forgive yourself for not hearing the alarm sooner. So, you channelled your grief into creating doppelgangers as a way of keeping us alive. Of keeping us close.

Ironically, I think this whole mess proves how much the real Victoria cared about you, because even me, your imagined version of her, only wanted what’s best for her husband.

I like Dr. Parker a lot, from the little glimpses I catch. I can tell she’s almost got you thinking straight because last time I saw the common room, there was snow outside the window. I’m no expert, but it wouldn’t surprise me if this is the last time I ever appeared.

I know you’re terrified of starting a new life by yourself, and I don’t blame you. I would be.

But it’s time to move on. To go back to posting angry YouTube comments about the wardrobe department on that Netflix show. And painting minifigures with your friends.

So, I genuinely hope this is my last goodbye. And that we never see each other again.

And remember, if you’re ever feeling scared, or lost, or alone, just know that if the real me loved you even half as much as I do, you’ve got enough love to last a thousand lifetimes.

Goodbye my darling.

You’re loving wife,

[Victoria.](https://www.reddit.com/r/thoughtindustry/comments/te0fum/welcome_i_hope_you_enjoy_your_stay/)
