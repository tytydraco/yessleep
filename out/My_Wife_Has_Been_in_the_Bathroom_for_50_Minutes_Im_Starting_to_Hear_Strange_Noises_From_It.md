I know how it sounds, I do. But honestly, this is not one of those dumb fake Reddit stories where someone finds out their wife is a killer or possessed by a ghost. My wife, Hannah, is ordinary. Completely human. Level-headed, a bit of an introvert, laughs extremely hard at Adam Sandler movies. She smells like lavender lotion and steals my fries even when she says she's not hungry anymore. We've been married for six years. I love her.

So when she mentioned that she had to pee when we were grabbing a bite at the McDonald's off of I-84 on our way back home from a friend’s wedding, I didn't think twice. She picked up her phone, joked that her Pepsi was going to explode her bladder, and headed for the restrooms.

That was fifty minutes ago.

I’m still here, sitting in the corner booth under the broken ceiling vent. The air conditioning cuts in and out—either freezing or dead. Our trays are cold and empty now, except for a few limp fries that look more like pale worms, and my half-finished Pepsi that’s gone flat. I’ve checked my phone at least twenty times. Texted her. No answer.

The hallway to the bathrooms is tiled in red and white, like a sterile candy cane. One of the overhead lights flickers every seven seconds. I’ve timed it. Seven seconds of humming buzz, then a blink of shadow. Like a mechanical heartbeat. Employees have passed by, mopping or hauling boxes of ketchup packets. None of them seem concerned. No one else has gone into the women’s room since Hannah did.

But lately… I’ve started hearing noises.

At first, it was typical stuff. Hand dryers, the occasional toilet flush. But then, something else. Wet. Gurgling. Like someone sucking soup through a straw made of meat. Slow, uneven pulses. A sound your body recoils from before your brain catches up.

I should also mention the statue outside. Hell, I may as well with how distracting it’s been. There's a Ronald McDonald statue out there. Not the one on the bench. This one's upright, arms spread like he's going to embrace you—or show you the welcome mat at Hell. He's almost human. Too human. Definitely at the peak of the Uncanny Valley.

As we went inside the McDonalds, Hannah paused to look at it for a second too long. "Did it always look like that?" she asked. "Pretty sure," I said. She tilted her head. "I think the mouth used to be open." I waved it off. Had to be a new statue. Maybe the other one got destroyed. Maybe we both just misremembered it. But now, that moment won't leave me alone. Because I can still see the statue from where I sit, behind grease-covered glass.

I would've sworn the mouth was closed before. Now the mouth is smiling. Open. With teeth that are too white, too pristine. And the shoes… now they're aiming towards the building. Slightly. Like the building shifted. Another noise shatters me. A squelch. Louder. Grubbier. Like something in pieces.

My heart lurches. I glance down the corridor again. The flicker of light reaches the shadows too far. I spring to my feet. Decency says I shouldn't go into the ladies' room. But my wife might be being eaten by a bathroom monster. Good manners can wait. I make my way to the door. The door is barely open. Moist, warm air blows out, sighing against my cheek. "Hannah?" I whisper. There is a deafening silence. I nudge the door open and step in. The fluorescent lights are strobing hard, in time with the fry timer at the front. beep… buzz… beep… buzz. Like a countdown. Then comes the smell: burnt grease, blood and pennies. Heavy and metallic. It sticks to my nostrils.

The floor is slippery beneath my feet, but there's no sign of dripping water. The dampness is. wrong. Like it's coming up from underneath the tiles. One stall is shut. Beneath it, a white pair of sneakers. Hannah's. Laces undone, as she always leaves them "comfy loose," as she says. I continue on. The air appears to catch its breath. I knock. "Hannah?" Something shifts within. A curling, gentle motion. Then, her voice. "Babe? Help." A pause. "It's wedged. I can't get out."

The first half sounds like hers. The second. lower. Slurred. A throat mimicking human speech after too much practice. Two voices, barely out of rhythm. A bad dubbing on a foreign movie. My stomach churns. I clutch the door to the stall and push. Nothing. Won't open. I drop to my knees. The shoes are empty. Sitting there in line. Side by side. My face goes cold. Then the door slams open, pushing me back against the sink. The lights strobe maniacally and in that split second, I catch a glimpse inside. Nothing. Save for a crimson red smudge on the toilet seat, and on the wall. I dash back into the dining room, and halt.

It's empty. No customers. No workers. Too cold in here, like a walk-in fridge. The PlayPlace throbs with red and blue. Menu screens flash, restart. The Ronald statue is changed once more. Not smiling anymore. Now it frowns. Arms folded over its chest, waiting.

I don't know what to do. I dash to the back of the restaurant, behind the kitchen, grab a mop out of the janitor closet and psych myself up. Shaking hands. Thumping heart. Then, a noise. Clicking. Quick and wet. I turn around. Something zips past the ceiling tiles. It's wearing Hannah's hoodie. Her hair. But the face is far too wide. Mouth too wide. It's too far open, shiny and wet, like a just-minted coin from a fountain. And then it lands on me. I yell her name and beat the mop. The thing scream like a seagull being flayed and squirms on impact. Black goo spurts on the deep fryer. It smells of fryer oil combined with nickels. I persist until it melts. Until there's nothing but greasy sludge and wiggling clumps of something indistinguishable. Shuddering. Then silence.

I stumble back into the dining room. All's back to normal. Employees taking orders, a kid laughing in the PlayPlace, menu signs glowing like always, Ronald smiling again, peacefully gazing out at the parking lot, and in our booth I see Hannah.

She's sipping my Coke, crossed legs, smiling like nothing ever happened. "Took you long enough," she says. I want to scream. To insist that she tell me what she saw, but she appears… serene. Tranquil. Her smile wrinkles her eyes just like it always does. We throw away our trash, and then leave. The ride home is quiet for a few minutes, then she puts her hand on top of mine, whilst mine is on the steering wheel. It's warm, but something is off. Her nails are clean, too clean. Hannah always bites them when she's anxious. She has for as long as I can remember. I glance at her hand. Then her face, still smiling. I grab my Coke out of the cupholder, and take a sip as we drive off into the distance.

I could’ve sworn I had a Pepsi, I never cared for Coke, and Pepsi is the brand McDonalds famously has, that’s where the “McDonalds Sierra Mist” meme came from. The cup says Coke now though, and the drink is Coke. I glance over at Hannah again, and for an instant, one instant only, her head in the rearview mirror is upright, whilst I feel her head lying on my shoulder. I don't say anything. I don't pull over. I just drive, gripping the wheel a little tighter. If something changed back in that bathroom, whatever came out  of the restaurant with me might not be Hannah.
