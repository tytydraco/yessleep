Hi all,

It's been suggested to me to post my short stort series here, so if you don't sleep or want something to read whilst hope your brain will shut down, here is something I've been working on for some time. It's a short series of stories, all under the umbrella of 'The Salesman'. I hope you all enjoy.



# Flies and Static or The Salesman

By

Robert J E Smith



*“I’ll tell you what, Mick. This item is an absolute bargain. Bargain I tell you. This…this is not on the*

*highstreet at this price.”*



Static chewed through silence, as the darkness of early morning slowly receded.



*“What we have here is, and I’m not making this up, totally unique. There is nothing quite like this ladies*

*and gentlemen; even convenience stores are yet to conceive of it!”*



Bob’s vacant expression remained as ever, fixated on the faded luminosity of his Journeyman R150

series television screen. Dust, dirt and other microbial life clung to the heat vents in the form of

blackened, musky-smelling dots called home, which Bob thought needed another hypothetical

cleaning.



*“I’ll tell you what, I’m going to lower the price right now! Get your hands on this monthly subscription*

*before it’s too late!”*



Bob had to admit, the Salesman had style, but that wasn’t unusual for 3am teleshopping hosts. A

vibrant blue and yellow chequered suit was a bold choice on any occasion, but the icing on the top

were the dark tan cowboy boots the host paraded in front of the camera. Combined with the short

jives that segwayed between advertising each product, he made for easy entertainment. Bob

imagined him as a bingo host or wedding entertainer.



*“I’ll tell ya, fruit subscription is a plan for the future, Mick. Imagine: vast, plentiful fields of nutritious*

*and delicious fruits, from bananas to apples, tangerines to clementines. Mouth-watering melons and*

*exotic coconuts. The sweetest of peaches and the sourest of grapes…..and it’s all yours right now my*

*friends. You’ll never have to worry about suspicious or mouldy produce anymore!”*



Bob was yet to ascertain who Mick actually was. After ingesting 65 consecutive episodes of 3am

teleshopping, he was still no closer to unravelling the mystery of Mick, but the Salesman loved to

point his finger squarely at camera as if Bob were in fact Mick.



*“And….the best thing about this subscription is the unbelievable value. Honestly, you will not believe*

*it: 30. Whole. Dollars. That’s right, for the grand total of $30, this marvel of local produce can be all*

*yours, Mick.”*



The weight of Bob’s eyelids began to steadily increase and with them the continuity of the

teleshopping program, which Bob had been so dutifully being paying attention to. The strain of

concentrating took it’s toll as the flickering TV screen gradually faded from Bob’s view.



*“But don’t worry, Bob, there’s something for you too.”*



Bob’s eyelids sprung to life in a momentary jolt of confusion. The piercing stir of the Salesman’s eyes

were firmly directed towards the camera. A long, gaunt face with eminent dark circles filled the

television screen; the expression of which made Bob feel a sense of all-encompassing dread. It was

like looking at death, if death held a diploma in sales and took Saturday dancing lessons.



*“Bob, are you paying attention? This is kinda important.”*



Bob returned a dumbfounded gaze at the ever flickering television screen; his expression held in

eternal stasis by the marketing reaper.



*“Now, if you wouldn’t mind, I kindly request you stay awake for this next feature; it might just change*

*your life.”*



Bob slowly nodded in submissive agreement as drool navigated its way from his crusty, chapped lips

to a stained, yellowish-white vest that looked as though it was held together by dried tomato sauce

and globules of mucus.



*“Now I know what you’re thinking, Bob. This must be a dream of sorts; after all, how can a man in a*

*television be talking to you in your living room?”*



Bob’s silence implied confirmation.



*“Well, don’t you fret, Bob. I’m gonna give you a special offer. One of a kind. A real bargain! All you*

*have to do is pay attention. Now then, moving onto our more select items, just for you viewers at*

*home, from the ethereal market of the damned: one human soul. The living sum of rejection,*

*humiliation and tax evasion.”*



*“Freshly cropped from the desperate and unemployed, we at T&C incorporated proudly bring you a*

*real tear jerker of a life; a macabre reality so demoralising, so hellish, even Mick might have shed a*

*tear!”*



The camera, which had tracked the Salesman so vigilantly, rapidly panned 180\* to face the greasy

visage of Bob, held in static glory as he watched a virtual Counterpart stir back. Bob’s mental

contortion was fully on display as the Salesman jittered towards him, occasionally interrupted by

variety of corporate jingles.



Living room Bob stirred bewilderingly at Counterpart Bob. His fingers twitched as beads of sweat

rolled from the top of Bob’s forehead onto blue and white-striped pyjama bottoms. The invasive

smell of cheap cologne wafted through the air, pervading all of Bob’s senses. The feint echo of

humming and shuffling footsteps filled the dimly-lit living room as if the Salesman were performing

one of his routine jives.



*“Well folks, it looks like the lines are opening now. What y’all pay for Bob’s meagre excuse of a life?*

*Let the bidding start now!”*



A cartoonish animation ushered onto the television screen a series of numbers, comically performing

violence in a way only children’s entertainment can. It was only a minute after the fact that Bob

understood what these numbers represented and was now under the distinct impression that his life

may well be on the figurative line. It could also be a bad dream caused by previously ingesting stale

cheeseburgers and undercooked chicken pieces. Bob wrestled with the thought of telephonic

oblivion as the Salesman performed a jive behind Counterpart Bob. Bell chimes resonated through

the R150’s speakers, like wailing banshees, each signifying a bid on the life of Counterpart Bob.



Several bids and corporate jingles later, Bob’s fingers were aggressively fumbling over the many

dialling buttons on his T-307 telephone set. Comically violent numbers on Bob’s television jumped

back and forth between one another, as if anticipating his intent. Bob’s desperation was now on full

display for all microbial life to see, veering between laughter and tears as the Salesman announced a

time limit of 30 seconds left on the current offer. The Salesman’s jovial mood only heightened the

sense of dread, which Bob had completely absorbed.



*“Well folks, we got 20 seconds to go. Remember to ask the billpayer for permission before pledging*

*your bid and hurry on up if you don’t wanna miss out!”*



With unnatural speed, the Salesman’s otherworldly features engulfed the television screen.



*“That includes you too, Bob”* he said in a playful tone.



A sinister grin crept onto the Salesman’s pale lips; his wraith-like stir fixated onto the camera as a

countdown timer mercilessly marched to its zenith. Bob possessively stirred at Counterpart Bob as

his grasp of the T-307 handset loosened until it finally met the hardwood floor of his living room with

a slow, deliberate crash.



Palm trees fluttered delicately in a gentle breeze as the faded blue neon signage of Aztec Apartments

was slowly bathed in rays of morning sunlight. An elderly figure cautiously unfurled a cigarette from a

crisp packet of Ranger Regulars as he scanned the horizon for movement. It was always slow in the

morning, aside from the usual customers, almost no one stopped by these days. Most just drove

through this stretch on their way to the strip. Still, there was the possibility of quiet contemplation to

be had if the elderly custodian could avoid interacting with the resident lodgers.



A door slamming alerted the elderly custodian that self-reflection was not going to be amongst this

morning’s tasks. He took a deep inhalation of tobacco as he further scanned the road ahead. Heat

distorted the view as rocks and sand swallowed up what little of man’s creations had dared to

venture into the desert. This place was truly inhospitable in every sense of the word. As the elderly

custodian finished his morning ritual, he was accosted by a diminutive woman wearing bright green-

rimmed spectacles, her gait a mixture of military rigidness and impotent rage.



*“I don’t understand, Mr Brown.”*



The diminutive woman excluded as the building custodian twizzled his moustache. His hands

awkwardly fidgeting through various keys, as he slowly walked up a flight of stairs and came upon an

end corridor, flanked by faded signage and arid vistas.



*“I dunno either. The smell comin’ from this last apartment aint exactly nice. I got three complaints*

*this week alone from whatever’s in there. No one answers. No one visits. I tell ya, some people just*

*can’t take care of ‘emselves.”*



The audible click of the locking mechanism releasing signified success as apartment 7C’s front door

cracked open. Like a time-locked prison, the interior atmosphere of 7C vented through the small

opening created by the elderly custodian. His first impression was that something died, many times

over. The odour was enough to deter the diminutive woman from advancing further.



*“Maybe we should call the cops, huh?”*



The elderly custodian twizzled his moustache again. Cautiously moving forward, he tapped the door

with the end of his flashlight.



*“Hello, this is building administration. We’re just checkin’ on ya.”*



Silence greeted back as the two figures exchanged nervous glances.



*“I’m gonna come in. No need to be alarmed now.”*



The elderly custodian prodded the apartment door open, as it creaked in response. The glaring

sound of static resonated throughout the apartment. A single, faded armchair facing a moldy

television set caught the custodian’s attention as feint light from the outside world shyly peered

through drawn curtains.



The custodian hastily moved to open as many windows as possible, as the internal odour of

apartment 7C became unbearable. If something hadn’t died, it probably should have. A single, faded

armchair decorated the centre of the living room, which was now home to several nests of flies,

dancing through the air enthusiastically. A glaring static, emanating from a mold-infested television

screen immediately cut off, revealing the shadowy reflection of an elderly figure cautiously

approaching. Floorboards gleefully creaked as tired boots slowly treaded towards the now silent

television set.



A loud crack underneath his boots caused a momentary halt, revealing the shell of a telephone

handset discarded on the floor. The smell of decay began to grow steadily worse as the elderly

custodian approached the armchair. Despite sunlight beaming through the apartment, the darkness

surrounding the television set was unnaturally dense, encasing the armchair in an umbral cloak. Now

at the epicentre of flies and maggots, the elderly custodian sluggishly hefted the armchair into the

light; it’s weight deceptive in the shadows. Clasping his nose with a handkerchief, the elderly figure

hesitatingly probed the body of the armchair with his flashlight.



Nothing. There was nothing in the armchair whatsoever. No man. No woman. No corpse. Just flies

and maggots, all congregating around several fleshy growth-like pods, each pulsating in rhythm as a

slimy substance oozed from their interiors. The elderly custodian wore a baffled look as he attempted

to process the events of the day thus far. The previous occupant was nowhere to be seen. Bob had

for all intents and purposes, disappeared completely. All that remained were flies, maggots and the

smell of decay.
