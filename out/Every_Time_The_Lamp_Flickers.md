I think this has to be my favorite day of the year. The first cold front coming through after an oppressively hot summer along the coast is a blessed change. A far cry from the 100 percent humidity we cope with every day, the air has a crisp quality and makes me want to spend the entire day outside.

As evening set in, getting darker earlier and earlier as the year goes forward, I clicked on the lamp beside the couch, wrapped a light blanket around my legs, and settled down to read the latest novel by my favorite author. The wind was whipping hard outside. I could clearly hear it, but somehow it gave me comfort.

I was barely past the latest chapter when the light from the lamp flickered. The way the wind was blowing, it came as no surprise that we may lose power or at the very least have it blink in and out. So I wasn't phased. I got up and lit candles around the house, just in case.

When I sat back down with my book, I stared at the page. I couldn't remember where I left off. I flipped back a couple of pages and nothing seemed familiar to me. It was as though I was reading the words for the first time. I tried to think of the last thing that I could remember from the story and flipped back to find it. It was several chapters back. I shrugged it off. I attributed it to a sort of dissociative state. Everyone has those from time to time — like when you're driving home after a long day and zoning out, then suddenly realize you're nearly home. It had to be something along those lines. No harm, no foul, just pick up from where I left off.

I made it about five pages before the lights flickered again. So I got up to light candles, just in case I lose power. But there are candles lit. I don't remember doing that. I walked through all of the rooms and each one had a lit candle. I could tell by the amount of wax melted that they weren't lit long ago. You would think I would remember lighting them.

As I crossed into the kitchen, I saw the lamp in the living room flicker. I looked around the kitchen and couldn't remember what I came in here for. Maybe a cup of tea on a cold, blustery night. I filled the kettle and set it on the burner, then headed back to the couch while I waited to hear it whistle. I decided to text my best friend, Stacy, and tell her about my strange night. I told her about not remembering the book, not remembering lighting the candles, and that I still don't know why I went to the kitchen, but a cup of tea sounded nice.

She got back to me, asking if I had been in any sort of accident, if I had taken a tumble and hurt my head or anything that could account for the memory loss. I told her I hadn't. That it had been an uneventful day at home and nothing of note happened. She told me to let her know if anything else happened, that she was worried about me, and I said I would.

As the kettle whistled, I set down my phone and went to make a cup of tea. I curled up back on the couch while my tea steeped on the end table next to the lamp. After about two minutes, I reached for my tea and the lamp flickered.

I picked up my cup and blew on it as my phone chimed that I'd gotten a message. It said it was from someone named Stacy. I don't know anyone by that name.

I opened the message and read it. It said she was just checking on me. This makes no sense. I scrolled up. There were messages back and forth between us and it went on and on and on. I made my way back to where she says she is checking on me, and read what was written right above it. It said that I have been having trouble remembering things but that I have no idea what could have caused it.

This is really starting to freak me out.

Then the lamp flickered.
