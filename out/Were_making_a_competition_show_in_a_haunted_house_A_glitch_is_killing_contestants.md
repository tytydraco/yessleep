I’m about to break so many NDAs just posting here. There’s something really fucky going on though, and people are dead, so something needs to happen. I’m a freelance video editor, a few weeks ago I got a call about an indie production working on one of those Big Brother-style game shows. This time the twist was that the guests were going to be in a haunted house, unbeknownst to them.

Look, I’m not here to debate the morality or ethics of that. The producers said nobody would be in danger and they’d be the ones pulling the strings as “ghosts”. Yeah, don’t think they knew what they were getting into. Whatever, I needed the money and took the job. Now, I don’t know if I’ll even make it through the next week.

The house in question was massive, with room enough for everyone to maintain their space. Eight main rooms, a huge kitchen, a separate dining room, a separate den and foyer, along with a pool/hot tub combo out back. Honestly, would be a dope house to live in. Except for the ritual suicides and subsequent mass murders that happened in the seventies. That kind of throws off the vibe, no matter how low the real estate price.

From the research I did before taking the job, this house was home to some upstart techies back in the 90s, with one dude who was pretty charismatic as the leader. Then one day he just… broke? Said he found the truth of the world and was going to break us all out of the “manufactured reality we live in”. Dude wrote a TON of bullshit about finding some ‘precursor’ to humanity. From everything he said, it just sounded like he was a few years early to the Matrix. After that though information is really hazy. Some say he killed himself and others in the house, others think he took his little cult and fucked off to an island. Nobody can say for sure though. 

Everything started simple enough. The contestants, six of them, were in one haunted house. I and the producers, Saul and Shana, would alternate shifts in a nearby trailer, watching a live feed from inside the house at all times. From there, we would mark moments in the tape, saving them to compile into the show after it was done. Not the strangest gig I’ve taken to pay the rent.

The first few days were pretty normal, to be honest. Everyone settled in- Frank, Indy, Carol, Megan, Pete, and Jacob. All are in their late twenties to mid-thirties and of course, attractive to ensure drama pops off. Don’t fix what ain’t broken, as they say. So far, they were all amicable, not really getting on each other's nerves yet. That was until the third night when everything went weird.

It was maybe eleven at night, pitch dark outside with no moonlight to spare, and almost everyone in the house was asleep. Except Pete, who was making his way into the kitchen for something to eat. I was on watch, with the huge camera display up in front of me and at least thirty different angles to see every bit of their lives. Think they only stopped short of putting cameras in the bathrooms because of privacy concerns. 

Pete made it down to the kitchen okay, rummaging around cabinets for a minute before finally getting to the fridge. The camera I was watching from faced the refrigerator directly from above, so I could only see him from behind when he opened it. Static started humming over the audio. He could hear it too, turning away from the fridge and shouting at something nearby. The static grew louder, a constant hum in the audio feed as if it was about to completely cut out. He reached into the fridge after deciding whatever was there wasn’t worth worrying about, and that’s when it went wrong.

The camera glitched for a moment, a figure popping up right next to Pete. Almost as tall as him, but contorted in odd ways. Too many edges and angles to be a real person, but it looked like there were parts of them stretching outward. The static roared to thunder, and the figure disappeared. If Pete noticed it, he didn’t even get a chance to make a sound. The camera glitched again before something dragged him away, straight through the door back into the hallway, before he could scream. As quickly as it happened, it was over. The kitchen was still, with the door swinging slowly shut on shelves of food inside. 

I almost immediately lost my shit, switching between every camera I could to see if he just ran somewhere else or I was hallucinating. Nope. Pete was nowhere, not a trace of him in the whole house. Poof, gone.  It was like he went through a whole other doorway because he never even appeared on the hallway camera, just a black square of darkness in the doorway. Naturally, I called Saul because one of our damn contestants disappeared from thin air, and he was over in a few minutes.

This motherfucker told me he would handle it, I just needed sleep. I know what I saw, Saul, and it wasn’t because I was tired. Nevertheless, he kicked me for the night, telling me to get some rest. Didn’t have much choice then, so I went back to the hotel.

When I came back in the morning Saul told me he had found Pete. Though he would no longer be taking part in the contest, citing what Saul said as a “family emergency”. In hindsight, yeah, it sounds fishy. At the time I wasn’t going to argue though. They told me there was network interest for the show, so that might mean I could have a steady gig, and I wasn’t about to throw that away over a glitched camera.

He announced to the rest of the house and had them do their journals for the day with feelings on them. All the basic “oh, hope he’s okay” stuff, y’know. Things got weirder that night though, and I don’t think they believed it for long.

Everyone gathered for dinner that night, sitting together in the dining room. Drinks were being poured and everyone was talking, laughing, shooting the shit about life outside the house. Indy was the first to mention strange happenings.

”Hey, so I was in the bathroom last night and the lights suddenly flickered really bad. Was one of you playing a prank on me?” She asked the entire table. Nobody came forward, everyone just looked at each other unsure.

”I mean I’m not mad. It’s just when the lights flickered I got one of those weird horror movie experiences. It looked like someone was just… standing beside me. There was a big burst of static too. I got goosebumps.”

Everyone else still maintained their innocence. Telling her that there wasn’t anything to worry about. From the dining room camera I could see the entire table, and into the kitchen through the doorway. If I hadn’t been paying attention already, I would’ve noticed someone walking through the door into the room.

Just a note- for being a relatively low-budget seeming production, Saul and Shana had sprung for the good cameras, and I mean GOOD. These things were giving 8k resolution, and the monitors were able to match it. That’s the part that made me concerned about what happened next.

The figure walking in was like god used the least amount of polygons available, only a basic demo of a person. Even worse, there weren’t any actual features on the face, just a smiling, ear-to-ear grin with wide eyes that looked as if it was pressed on flat. I felt my skin grow cold as it stood in the doorway, staying there for almost fifteen seconds surveying the room. I almost fell out of the chair when it turned to me, face suddenly extending on its neck toward the camera. 

Apparently, the others in the house took notice of it too, because everyone jumped up screaming. My screen glitched out again, the horrible face briefly popping up in front of me, not just obscuring everything else in the camera but almost popping through my screen. Everyone in the dining room was freaking out, all standing as Carol ran out of the room screaming. Indy was pale, literally having just seen a ghost, and Frank looked ready to fight. Meanwhile, I’m shaking trying to figure out what the hell I just saw. It took me a moment to realize the audio feed was coming in again, with Frank shouting for answers to whoever was listening.

All the noise must have woken Shana in the next room. She came out, asking what was the matter and what the loud noise was. If she understood anything I was babbling about, more power to her, but eventually she said she would just go speak to the guests herself, assuring me it was one of the scares they had set up. All part of the act, supposedly.

I don’t buy it. It’s been a few days since without much incident, but I think things are only going to get worse. I’ve seen a few weird things here and there. Glitched pixels moving in some of the cameras, and occasional static when there shouldn’t be any interference. Yesterday, one of the couches scooted across the floor around midnight. If these were scares set up by producers, they didn’t bother making me aware.

I’ll keep a running update if anything happens. Right now I’m choosing to believe it’s just their setup, hopefully all fake. Something’s gnawing at me though, telling me that there’s something else behind how casual they are about this. There’s no way something popping out of my screen was just some kind of [glitch](https://www.reddit.com/u/googlyeyes93/s/zD0VXeeDSu).
