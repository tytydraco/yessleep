Two years ago, i went to a sports camp, with an ex-best friend. The camp was 10 days long. 10 days too long. Every day seemed like hell, my best friend would pick fights, the house felt suffocating due to 11 people living in a single cabin, something felt wrong the whole time.

The atmosphere was wrong. The air felt heavy at all times. The weather was hot, too hot. We were in the middle of no where. The closest store or any other form of civilisation was 5 km away, around us was only a forest and a small lake that belonged to the camp terrain.

On the terrain, was a playground, there was a big gym, 6 cabins (2 semi-cicrles of cabins, 3 houses per semi-circle. in the middle of them, an old, rusty double swing. All 6 belonged to the camp, one was for teachers), there was a big hangar for boats, another one for the windsurfing equipment, and in the middle of everything, was a big long building with the canteen and hotel rooms for normal visitors, non campers.

Each cabin looked the same. You would enter into a small corridor, on your left *the mirror,* on the right a coat hanger. Again on the right, beside the mirror, was a 3 person bedroom, on the left 2 bathrooms. Further against the right wall was an open space, the living room with a ladder to the 2 2person bedrooms (i lived in one). In the "living room", against the furthest wall was a small sofa and an armchair. In the middle of the room was 6 person table, on the right wall was a TV. Beside it was a door to a 4 person bedroom and a small kitchen aid. That's all. Nothing special.

Yet the mirror seemed different, almost wrong. The air felt the heaviest beside it. There was always something wrong with it. When you walked out the front door, onto the veranda, everything seemed different.

Second night, I go down to make myself some coffee as i'm planning on staying up and drawing for a while. I set the coffee on, leave my supplies on the table and walk to the bathroom to wash my hands. In the corner of my eye, i see two figures in the mirror. I walk closer, and of course see my reflection. Byt behind me, there is a dark figure, like a shadow. Yet that's impossible, because there are no lights on. And the "shadow" moves differently than me. Slower. I brush it off as nothing, since i'm sleep deprived and go wash my hands.

Later, the same night, i go wash my brushes in the sink. Again, something in the refection seems off. After i'm out the bathroom, i shut off the lights. Yet in the reflection, the small crack above the bathroom door seems to have lights on. But in reality, it's almost pitch black. The only light is on in the living room, it's my small drawing light on the table, it's light being barely visible. I look back at the reflection and again onto the door. Nothing changes. I feel weirdly, yet again, i blame it on my lack of sleep and insomnia.

I go back upstairs. I try to fall asleep, hoping the coffee will kick in and tire me out. I took my meds an hour ago, i should be asleep by now. Yet i'm not. I feel uneasy. Like someone's watching me. I take my phone and slowly go downstairs. Again, in my reflection, the shadow stands behind me, moving slower than i do. The refection still has the bathroom lights on, but in reality they're switched off. At this point, you can see a faded light coming not only through the crack, but also through the door window.

To ease my brain, i record it. I tell myself i'll watch it back when i get some sleep, maybe then i'll be sure it's my insomnia.

Finally, around 2 or 3 am i fall asleep. I rest till 6:30, when my alarm wakes me up. It didn't only wake me up, but also my best friend, who very nicely flipped me off and went back to sleep. I took my ear buds and clothes for change. I was going for a run. When i'm put on my shoes, i quietly tip toe back to the kitchen to take my water. As i'm walking out the front door, i see small drops of red and brown Dripping down from the corner of the mirror, down onto the frame and onto the floor. Most of it was dry. The drops also followed along to the table and bathroom door. I think of it as paint, since it was only me walking around here last night, painting.

As i'm running down the beach, i look around. I'm thinking of all the event of last night. It's only the third day and i'm already done with this place. I close my eyes and hang my head low as i turn back and run to the camp. When i'm jogging up the stairs, i see that my running shoes have little red spots on them, just like on the floor. I stop and try to wipe them off, but they're not coming off.

*Dry paint, it's only dry paint.*

I tell myself. I go back to the cabin, now the sun fully up, people are waking up at 7:30, so i have half an hour to get ready. I go to shower. Everything seems fine. i step out the shower and the red dots. They're there. Under the sink that most to the left. That's where things starts to go south.

As i get dressed, i realise i didn't use the left sink. I used the right sink last night. I check the possibility of splashing the red paint there, but that's impossible. I couldn't have possibly splashed it over the cabinet. And then it hits me.

*I don't have red paint.*

I didn't have red paint here. Neither did i use it, as i only did a background to my painting (purple and blue). I try to wash off the red stains, but they're not coming off. Only smudging around.

No one seemed to notice in the next 5 days. I mean, to be fair, the house looked like it went through an apocalypse. You had to try really hard not to slip on a tennis ball, or trip over someone's shoes. So it wasn't something special.  Just spilled paint.

Except it wasn't paint.

And i know it wasn't anybody else's paint, because no one else had art supplies in the cabin except me.

It was day 7 out of 10 when i finally gathered up the courage to watch back the video, afraid i wasn't seeing things. At 1 in the morning, i climbed out my bedroom window and onto the roof. I sat down, headphones on. I clicked *play* and watched, as me, from 5 days ago, appeared on the screen, my reflection visible in the mirror. I looked in the corner. There it was. The *paint.* It was brighter than it was in the morning.  Fresh, like blood.

I rewatched the video a couple times. I finally caught the exact moment when the *paint* appeared on the corner. I noted down the exact time, both of the video and night.

Then i moved onto the shadow. I watched it's every move very, very closely. When the exact time of the paint's appearance came, i realised something even scarier. Something, that sent shivers down my spine. The shadow's move, right before the paint appearance, was a stabbing motion. Like it was holding something in hand, like a knife, or a sharp object, stabbing it into my shoulder. The second the shadows arm "touched" my shoulder, the red dots appeared in the corner of the screen. Like they were splashed on there.

When i was about to shut off the video, having enough scares for the night, something flashed in the lightly lit up window if the bathroom door. Another shadow. But who was it? Everyone was asleep at that time, i checked the bathroom, no one was there.

I watched the video again, swearing it will be the last time.  I saw the figure. Flashing in the window, what seemed like an outline of someone's head, a wide, scary smile. spread across it's face. It appeared only for a spit second. I paused the video and took a screenshot of it, to be sure i wasn't seeing things.

I knew i couldn't be hallucinating this time, it couldn't be my insomnia. Over the past 3 days i slept 23 hours total, taking double the dosage of my meds to sleep. I knew my mind was fresh. I knew i was right.

*Something wasn't right.*

I climbed back to bed, dreading the next nights. I was right. And to make matters, worse, the next morning, day 8, only 48 hours left, when i was walking out of the cabin for a run, i knew i was seeing more. The dots have progressed through the living room, now slowly creeping up the ladder.

Other's started realising at this point too. Counting the fact, that the ladder was relatively clean compared to the house (it was so steep and old, you wouldn't dare to put a single thing on it, fearing that someone could slip off of it over a literal paper), you could see the marks on the steps.

It was day 9. In 12 hours i would be out of here. Just 12 hours. It was the last night, so we played rugby. It was dark, so the big lights had to be turned on, across the whole field. My team was currently sitting (i don't really know how to play rugby, don't judge the description. Also there were 4 instead of 2 teams, since there were too many kids), when i looked at the white marks on the side of the field. The dots. They were here.

*Like it was following me.*

I brushed it off. It was whole camps field. Couldn't be the dots from my cabin.

Last night. 5 hours left, i fall asleep. Everything went smoothly. We cleaned out the house last night, only then we realised how many red marks were there. But no one seemed to mind it. not like i did.

I woke up to a text from my parents, saying they will be there in half an hour. i wasn't going for a run that day, so i slowly cleaned out the rests of my room. By then, my best friend already was picked up by her mom. All she left behind was a note saying that it was an amazing time here, happy to meet so many people. I knew she didn't mean it, since most the time she was sitting locked in our room, denying me access, mad at me, but i didn't care at that moment. All i wanted to do it get out of there.

My parents came, we packed all my things to the car and i just finished checking my room, when one of the teachers asked if i took off the bedding. I run back upstairs, as quick as i could, only minutes from leaving. I chose to ignore the red marks that made their way up the ladder and into my room.

I pulled off the bedsheet. Didn't realise anything at first. I folded everything into a cube, took my backpack and phone, ready to leave. Only to realise, the red marks were on the mattress. Almost invisible, red dots covering the mattress, forming an outline of a body, laid out like in crime scenes. I froze.

*This was their goodbye?*

Slowly, i took out my phone and took a picture. I walked out, closing the door behind me. I walked downstairs and past the mirror. I looked at my reflection, the shadow behind me. Air heavier then ever.

I walked out the cabin, closing the door behind me. We drove off and i didn't dare to look back, fearing what i could see.

Maybe it was hallucinations. Maybe i was going crazy. Or maybe i was right. I don't know. I probably won't ever find out. But one thought won't leave my head.

*Maybe the mirror was haunted. If so, who was behind that shadow and what did they mean? Were they trying to warn me? Who are they? And what really happened?*

I don't know if it was a sick prank played by my best friend, or my housemates. Was it my meds, or was this really *someone.*
