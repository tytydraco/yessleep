Full disclosure, I haven't told many this story irl, and after typing it out, it sounds really out there.

When I was a kid, I had a friend named Boo. I called him this because you could see through him. 

Boo and I played a lot when I was little, even introduced him to the rest of my family. We did everything together. He was cool because he change his shape. He could be little like me or big like my dad. He could walk through walls and flew on with wings on his back.

A week or two before my 4th birthday, Boo wanted to play in the front yard, which was normal for us. After a while, he said we had been friends a long time, and he wanted me to meet his family. He said he told his parents and siblings about me, and he said everyone was super excited to finally meet me. He told me they were going to throw me a big party with all the cakes and candies I could eat. As you could imagine, I was very excited.

So, I asked Boo where his family lived. He told me they lived in the other world, but that it was really easy to get to. I asked how to get there. I was concerned I couldn't go, because i did have wings like Boo did. He said we didn't have to fly to get there, and all I had to do was follow him away from my house. He wanted me to go down the street and into a small grove of trees.

I got kinda scared about getting in trouble, and I told Boo that Mommy and Daddy say I'm not allowed to leave the yard. He said they're not with us right now, so they won't know that we left. Dad was inside watching Tv, and mom was at the store. I still wasn't sure. He told me that we were best friends, and I should trust him. Boo then took me by the arm and started leading me out of the yard. He had opened the gate for me because I didn't know how.

I walked with him to the street corner. I stopped when I was suddenly filled with an overwhelming sense of fear. Boo asked why I stopped. I told him I was scared, because that's the furthest I'd ever been away from the house without Mommy and Daddy. He said not worry, because we're almost there. His grip then tighten around my arm, and he started pulling me hard. I told him he was hurting me and to stop. Boo then told me, in a flat voice, to be quiet.  

He said if I didn't behave that I wouldn't get my party, and they would have to throw all the food away. I started to cry and asked why he was being so mean to me. Boo, said it didn't matter because we would be in the other world soon. Crying, I told him I didn't want to go anymore. He responded by saying, if I didn't go with him, then he would just leave me there, and I would have to find my own way home. I said fine and yanked my arm away from him. He made his face look weird. Like, not human werid. There were shapes that shouldn't be there, and parts of it were really sharp. Then he left.

I did make it back home and sat on the porch and cried. Boo was my best friend, I didn't understand why he was so mean to me. A few minutes later, my mom returned from the grocery store and asked me what was wrong. I told her everything about mine and Boo's fight. She looked back and saw the gate was still open, and told me I wasn't allowed to go outside without her or my dad. My father also got in trouble for not keeping an eye on me.

That wasn't the last time I saw Boo either, but he was never the same. He kept being kinda mean to me. One day, I told him we weren't friends anymore, because friends aren't mean to each other. So, I told Boo to leave and never come back. I never him saw again 

Years later, my mom told me how scared she was after I told her what happened, because she said gate was open that day when she got home from the store. She knew I was too little to open it by myself.
