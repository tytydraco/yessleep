What happens when you close your eyes and fall asleep, most people dream then wake up. Now some people believe that when you dream it’s your body being transported to another world or reality, and when you wake up its your body being brought back. What would you do if I told you that’s not only true but there’s more than one world you can visit. There's the real world we live in everyday, go to work, school whatever, then there’s the dream world it’s a world where you can do whatever be whatever and they have shapeshifting creatures that can transform into your happiest moment and memory’s and then feed off that happiness. Then there’s the nightmare world full of dark, evil things that seek to feed off the fear they produce, now the people that believe this to be true assume these are the only worlds but their wrong.

 

There are cracks between these worlds and to connect these cracks together there are bridges, the bridges are ways for people like me to cross between, people who travel these planes of existence are called travellers and they are there to ensure that these worlds don’t come into contact, of course there have been instances of this happening. Its like when your asleep and your about to wake up and your body is stuck halfway between a dream and reality and you see what has become known as a sleep paralysis demon, of course there not demons but they are evil creatures that grab onto you as your being brought back to the real world. sometimes we catch them before you ever wake up, but sometimes they slip through, and they keep you in a suspended state causing you to feel intense fear to feed off. These creatures are called tourists, now tourists are generally harmless they don’t want to hurt you they just want to incite fear, we catch them but we can’t put them back were the originally came from because if we do they will never stop attempting to escape to feast on the endless buffet of fear in the real world, so we have to transport them to the 4^(th) world that I mentioned earlier and before anyone asks no we don’t have names for them there just the worlds.

 

Originally this place was a hub world, it was a place where the other 3 worlds could pass over to one another but after the WTA (world travel authority) took over we closed it off and now use it as a home base and prison, now tourists are not the only thing we have to deal with but there the most frequent arrest, the creatures from the dream world often try going to the real world those are called pilgrims they usually transform themselves as soon as they pass over so they take longer to track down, there usually the celebrity types that people love, we call them pilgrims because once they arrive they stay there as long as they can, most of the time they get left alone to live in the human world, not that they should be just most WTA agents can’t be bothered because they live pretty normal lives and there not worth the paper work, unless they do something that’s worth arresting them for.

 

We even have a few humans from the real world who we had to detain we call them holidaymakers, there not there because they want to feed on anything they would just prefer to stay in a dream than in reality, we also once had a dog that got stuck here, we don’t know why but he makes a good mascot. Theres more but those are the most frequent, the worst we have to deal with is the one that scares me the most, well scares everyone the most are the excursionists there what happen when a tourist stays too long in the real world, they feast too much and they begin to change they morph and twist into this convulsive, deformed version of its self its horrifying but make no mistake they are incredible strong, they no longer need to hide in the shadows absorbing fear the can suck it straight out of humans, the last time we had to take one down we lost 39 WTA agents which is why tourists take priority over all other visitors.

 

There was one time me and my partner had a call out to go to the real world, we had reports that a pilgrim had been spotted taking human lives. not that it’s not impossible but it doesn’t happen often, in fact it is extremely rare for it to happen but when a pilgrim gets greedy they choose to forcibly take the happiness from humans, they excrete a pheromone like substance from their skin the causes happiness in humans, now most of the time they hold back on how much they produce but they can produce a hell of a lot when they want to, almost gassing humans then feeding on them until they die. We watched this pilgrim for 3 real world days, he was a lounge singer at a bar, he seemed to have a pretty normal life until we saw him grab a woman in the back alley of the bar and gassed her, but we watched, and he didn’t kill her he knocked her out with the gas, now even i didn’t know they could do that. We followed him back to the house he was living in; he opened the storm shelter behind his house and crept inside and we entered in behind him. We looked around the decrepit, old storm shelter there were women tied to metal posts with IV tubes, he was using this as his own personal farm to feed as much as he wants, whenever he wants.

 

There must have been at least 20 women down there all being kept alive, all deliriously happy being used as cattle and they didn’t even know it. When one of the travellers takes a life, we are given full discretion to terminate the target rather than arrest, but I had seen no evidence that any killing had taken place, but I think it’s necessary in this instance.

 

This is just one of my many stories about the WTA so if people like this I can look to write up some more of my experiences.
