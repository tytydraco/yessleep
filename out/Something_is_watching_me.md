I don’t know why I’m even bothering writing this- there’s no point. No one who reads this will be able to help me. Really, I don’t think anyone can. Maybe this is some kind of last ditch attempt to bask in some attention before it’s all over. I’ve always liked having eyes on me. Now, it feels like there’s always too many.  


  
So, I’m going to tell a story and I’m going to hope to god that someone reads it. Because no matter how much I know that I’m not going to make it, my nature never changes. I fucking hate myself.  


  
It started like this: I tripped over the three-step stairs that lead to my front door. Yeah, it was mundane. The thing is, I didn’t really catch myself the right way- holding out your hands and landing on your knees. Instead, I completely slipped off the stairs and dove for the bushes next to my front porch. I didn’t exactly land on the bushes, but my face crashed straight into the dirt beside it. Pretty embarrassing, but not the worst of my problems.  


  
I pulled out of the dirt pretty fast, not wanting any of the neighbors to see. But, then I noticed that my hand hadn’t exactly landed on even ground. I’d looked down to see that my hand was in a shoeprint rather than the expected leveled dirt.  


  
Funnily enough, I don’t actually remember that many details about the print, just that it was fresh and that the heel part looked like it had pressed into the ground hard. My brain is honestly a jumbled mess right now, and this happened a couple months ago, so I think I’m allowed to be a little sparse on details. Like how I can’t remember every emotion I felt when I saw the single print behind the bushes of my front yard. I do remember the panic though- yeah, that was definitely there.  


  
I remember how I’d traced the heel, wondering if the imprint had been so deep because someone had been crouching there. Then, I crawled a bit farther than that, looking for, well, I don’t exactly remember. Probably another footprint, the average person has two feet, after all. I didn’t find that though, instead I found an empty bullet shell, just hidden under a dishevel of leaves. At the time though, I hadn’t recognized it as a bullet shell, because I’d never even seen a gun in person before, let alone the things inside them.  


  
I’d pocketed it though, then called my sister, because the whole footprint stuff was freaking me out, and she had always been the most rational person in the family. I knew that I could tell her anything and that she would let me know if I was being crazy. One wild, frantic phone call later, she was driving down the street, probably more concerned than afraid for me, if I’m being honest. I don’t think I’d been very calm. Something about that shoeprint had gotten to me, even if- at the time- it had only been a bad feeling.  


  
Anyways, my sister came not too long after, and I showed her the bullet shell, still not exactly aware what it was. She explained it to me, and though I tried not to let my unsettled nerves show, it clearly hadn’t worked, because she led me back to the house and told me to take the day off. She didn’t seem particularly worried about my safety, just my health. My brain jumped to conclusions that she wouldn’t ever consider.  


  
She left, saying that I could call her if I got overwhelmed and stuff like that. I didn’t really plan on taking her up on that offer, and I still haven’t.  


  
That night, I couldn’t sleep. It was the same with the night after that, and the one after that too. You get the idea: I was scared. And, sure, I was probably a bit paranoid, but once the words “bullet” had left my sister’s mouth, I was consumed by fear and it wouldn’t go away. It still hasn’t left, really, which is why I’m writing this whole thing in the first place.  


  
How was I even meant to sleep when every shadow on the wall looked like a menacing gunman in black, some kind of leering monster out my window? No, I was destined to stay awake until I found evidence that this was all in my head.  


  
Some days, I would sit by the window sill, peering down to see if there was a figure by the bushes, like I’d always expected there to be. There was never anything there. On other days, I would stay bad far away from the window as possible- sure that something would be looking back at me if I even tried to peek. Sometimes, it’s easier to not acknowledge the danger. Or, at least, that was my thought process. Yeah, I know, I’m a fucking jackass.  


  
But, one night (the kind where I did everything but look out that goddamned window), I heard a sound. I’m not entirely sure how to describe the sound through text, but I think that anyone who’s watched an action or a western would recognize the sound. A soft click of lead against metal- the kind that I probably wouldn’t have even heard if the night hadn’t been so quiet.  


  
Something in me froze at the sound. I didn’t know what to do, how, really, to react to that sound. Part of me wanted to run to the window to look, to see what was down there, but it seemed too dangerous. Too impossible to even try. And, again, maybe I am an idiot, but at the time I thought that if I ignored it, it would go away. Slowly, I crouched on the floor, suddenly afraid to be spotted. And I stayed there for a bit, able to hear nothing but my own breathing at the rustling of leaves.  


  
Now, I know that the rustling could have just been the wind, but I didn’t think so. I still don’t. It sounded like someone shifting underneath a bush. I remember sitting on the hard ground of my second floor room, trying to imagine what they looked like. It just made me more scared, but I couldn’t help but imagine- it’s in my nature.  


  
After that night, I kept hearing sounds like that at nighttime, and I became more weary of looking out my window. There were times when I would hear footsteps, sometimes getting worryingly close. Whoever was there, watching me, had also made it to my front door, and on certain nights I could hear the light tapping of their knuckles against the wood. Less like a knock and more like they were testing the strength of the hinges.  


  
I didn’t exactly stop my peeking though, and only a few nights ago I saw someone more clearly.   


  
And, well, I don’t know how to describe what I felt the moment I locked eyes with my captor. Victorious, in a way, because at least I knew that I wasn’t crazy. But really, it was less of a moment and more of a heart attack. The slinking, silhouette figure was wearing all black and a mask to cover the lower half of their face. Still, I didn’t focus on that- rather, the first thing that I noticed were their eyes. They were so bloodshot that the red in them seemed to glow in the dark, and they didn’t seem to blink the entire time we met eyes, which for over a minute.  


  
The stare was intense. It was frightening in a way that I still don’t understand. I don’t think I really want to.  


  
They were also holding some kind of gun. The long, reaching kind that probably had a long range (it was hard to know how that person even came to own such a professional looking gun, the kind you wouldn’t find at a Canadian Tire). I remember thinking that I was going to die, before dropping down and shuffling against the wall. I’d hit my knee hard against the floor, but it’d been hard to feel any pain at the moment. The figure went away eventually.  


  
Which, yeah, leads me to now, where I’m writing whatever the hell this is instead of calling my family.  


  
I can hear the shaking of my door, a tussle I don’t ever want to hear the end of. There’s loud creaking, both from the door and from whatever’s trying to find me. It’s so cold in here.  


  
I’m contemplating jumping out the window.  


  
I don’t know why this person, this thing, is trying to kill me (because what else is it trying to do?), but what I do know is this: I’m not going to make it.  


  
I know that I probably sound amazingly calm through text, but I’m really not. My whole body is trembling. The door has broken- I can hear it. There’s a series of thumps rising up the staircase. Someone’s knocking on the door. I can hear the way they breathe, a deep, ancient sounding groan.  


  
I really might just jump out that window.
