December 31st

My doctor suggested I start keeping a diary to help manage my anxiety. I'm skeptical, but I'm willing to try anything at this point. Today was a great day. I threw a party at my house, had some drinks, played some games, and watched the ball drop in Times Square on TV. It was nice to have a distraction from all my problems for once.

January 1st

I'm a bit hungover today, but nothing too bad. My house is a mess, but I don't feel like cleaning it up right now. I just want to relax and enjoy the first day of what I hope will be a great year for me.

January 2nd

I finally mustered up the motivation to clean my house today. It looks a lot better now, but I'm feeling really sad for some reason. I feel so isolated out here in the middle of nowhere. I'm starting to wonder if buying this house was a mistake.

January 3rd

New year, new me. That's what I keep telling myself. Today was pretty ordinary, except for the nagging feeling that someone is watching me. It's probably just the winter chill getting to my head, or maybe it's the isolation. Either way, I can't shake the feeling that I'm being watched.

January 4th

I didn't sleep well last night. I kept thinking I heard footsteps, but every time I got up to check, there was nothing there. The feeling of being watched is getting stronger. I feel like I'm going crazy.

January 5th

Today was unnerving. I swear I saw something out of the corner of my eye, but every time I turned to look, there was nothing there. I feel like I'm losing my mind.

January 6th

I called my mom today and told her what I've been feeling. She offered to let me come stay with her, but I can't bring myself to do it. Not after the fight I had with my dad. I feel so alone out here.

January 7th

I started hearing whispers today. At first, I thought it was just the wind, but now I'm not so sure. They sound like they're coming from inside the house. I'm too afraid to look.

January 8th

I felt something touch my shoulder today. I turned around, but there was nothing there. I'm starting to feel like I'm being haunted.

January 9th

The whispers are getting louder. I can almost make out what they're saying. It sounds like they're saying my name. I'm too scared to leave the house, but I don't feel safe here either.

January 10th

I couldn't sleep last night. I kept hearing the whispers, and I could feel something watching me. I turned on all the lights, but it didn't help. I feel like I'm losing my mind.

January 11th

I saw it today. I was sitting in the living room, and I saw something move out of the corner of my eye. I turned to look, and there it was. A tall, dark figure standing in the doorway. It was watching me. I screamed and ran out of the house. I'm writing this from my car, parked down the road. I don't know what to do.

January 12th

I spent the night in my car. I was too afraid to go back to the house. I'm not sure what I'm going to do. I can't keep living like this.

January 13th

I went back to the house today. I had to. I couldn't afford to stay in a hotel, and I didn't have anywhere else to go. As soon as I walked in, I felt it. That same feeling of being watched. I tried to ignore it and go about my day, but it was impossible. I could hear the whispers getting louder and louder. I couldn't take it anymore. I grabbed my phone and started recording. I wanted to prove to myself that I wasn't going crazy. But as soon as I pressed record, the whispers stopped. I played the video back, but there was nothing there. Just silence. I don't know what's happening to me.

January 14th

I can't take it anymore. I'm going to my mom's house. I don't care what my dad says. I can't stay here anymore.

January 15th

I'm at my mom's house now. She was happy to see me, and my dad didn't say anything. I feel a little better, but I can't shake the feeling that something is still watching me. I don't know if it's just my anxiety, or if there's something more to it. I don't know what to do.

January 16th

I've been at my mom's house for a few days now, and I thought I was safe. But I was wrong. The whispers have followed me here. I can hear them even now, as I write this. I don't know what to do. I don't know who to turn to. I'm so scared.

I've decided to post this diary online, in the hopes that someone will read it and understand what I'm going through. I don't know if it will do any good, but it's the only thing I can think of. I don't know how much longer I can keep living like this. I feel like I'm losing my mind.

As I finish writing this, I can hear the whispers getting louder and louder. They're saying my name. I'm so scared. I don't know what's going to happen to me.

Please, if you're reading this, help me. I don't know what to do.

The door to my room just creaked open, and I see a shadowy figure standing in the doorway. I can't make out its features, but I can feel its eyes on me. It's watching me. I'm so scared.

I don't know what's going to happen to me. Please, help me.
