Something’s watching me.

My dog will bark at nothing a lot; he has ever since he was a puppy. I thought it was funny. That is, until about a month ago. 

I let him out one night before going to bed, and, like usual, he ran to the fence and started barking at seemingly nothing. I went to bring him back in, but saw something… weird. It was humanoid, but stood on all fours, hiding just behind the tree line. Now, I live in the Appalachians, so I know that if you see something, no you didn’t. So, I calmly brought my dog back inside, went to bed, and figured I wouldn’t see it again.

In the middle of the night, I was woken up by tapping on my window. Again, this wasn’t rare for where I live. I ignored it. It never crossed my mind that the creature and the tapping were related, until things started happening every day. It would suddenly go dead silent, or dark out of nowhere. Footsteps on my porch at night. More tapping on my window. I would even see it every once in a while. 

Eventually, I stopped going into the woods at all. I kept any visits outside short, only leaving my house for essentials. A deadbolt was installed on my door, and the locks were replaced. I wanted to avoid whatever this was at all costs. 

Last week, it started to get bad. It started with more footsteps, but this time, they stopped in front of my door. The handle jiggled for a second before the footsteps continued their usual path around my porch. 
It wanted in. It scared the hell out of me. The next morning, I put salt around my house. It didn’t help. 

After a few days of the handle-jiggling—which eventually progressed to pounding on the door and windows—I took my dog and went to my parents’ house. I figured if I stayed away, it would go back to the woods. 

I returned yesterday morning. I walked around my house and checked inside for any evidence of the creature. Everything seemed perfectly normal. My dog even stopped barking, save for the occasional animal. 

Last night, as I was trying to go to sleep, I heard something in my attic. Part of me wanted to believe it was a squirrel, or even an opossum. But the other part knew it wasn’t. 
I tried my best to pretend I was asleep as the attic door just outside my room opened, and something scurried out of it and into my room. It stayed for what seemed like forever before finally going back up. 

I’m not sure what to do. Everything I’ve dealt with in the Appalachians has been outside and pretty sparse. Nothing has ever been this persistent or in my house. I’m scared it’ll hurt me or my dog, but I don’t want to sell my house. I love it here. What is it? How do I get rid of it, if I even can? I really need some help here.
