
when i was a boy, i had no friends. not because i was fat or
because i was a nerd, but because things happened to the people
around me. bad things. this is the story of before i knew what
was happening in my life. so here is the terrifying story of my
life.

the bad things started out small, like some addictions start.
it started with preschoolers falling and scraping their knees,
not bad enough for you yet well it grew to my friends breaking
limbs in freak accidents i unknowingly set up to happen. i only
saw the pattern when my last victim got killed. he was a little
boy named freddy.

 we were having our first sleepover, playing a
new video game i got for my birthday just a week ago. i don’t
know why but i’ve been bloodthirsty for killing games, i now
know that it’s because of the demon that latched onto me when i
was just born. so he said he would go get a soda. so as he was
coming back i was just in a fight with a minigun as a weapon
which i was using to mow down wave upon wave of aliens.

 he slipped behind me with the glass of mountain dew in hand and he
fell on the glass. which pierced his eye leaving in it pieces of
shattered glass. i just sat there thinking that his scream was
part of the game. but my mom got worried and came to check on
us. she saw my friend lying in the blood and let out a
bloodcurdling scream that made me turn around. i was about to
ask what it was but i saw it before i could ask. my friend had
already bled out.
that was a year ago. i remember the police saying it was like
he tripped on air. but let's go back to a little after the thing.
shall we.
my mom moved me to a room next to hers for the time being.
and i was looking through some old photos of me and dad before
he died. but something disturbed me. in one of the photos i saw
something in the background. i was in the picture and across the
street from where the picture was taken i saw a shadowy figure.
it was disturbing to look at.

 i had a crazy idea. i was look at the
more photos of me and in each of them the figure kept getting
closer until it was close enough that i could see its eyes. the
eyes of the figure were blood red and full of loathing. it gave me
goosebumps to think of them they made me tired i almost fell
asleep.

 but as i saw him more in the photos i grew more and more
sure that this figure was the cause of my troubles. when i was
sure that the figure was the cause i heard a scraping in the hall.
i slowly looked up frightened almost to death. i saw the figure
more clear than i have ever saw him. it was as if he was feedingon my fear, sucking it out of me. he let out a chuckle when he
saw the pee drip down my leg. he lunged with amazing speed and
agility. his claws run down my chest, leaving a searing white hot
pain in its wake.
then, i wake up from my life wrenching nightmare. i find
myself drenched in sweat and pee. i look up and i see a figure
launching itself from above me through the door. along the
walls of my room i see what looks like blood scrawled in one
word “NOLA”. 

my chest still feels like it was ripped open so i pull
up my t-shirt and along my chest are four scars that look like a
bear mauled me. they ran across my chest just like they did in my
dream. i get out my laptop and search the word along my wall. it
popped up on google as the demon in the exorcism of emily rose.
it is the sixth demon of hell. i feel hot breath on my neck and
even though it's hot breath it sends a cold shiver down my spine.
i turn and my mom is staring at the screen. she wants to know
why i'm looking at stuff like that. i wonder why she didn’t scream
about the walls. but when i look back i see the walls are
unblemished.

 i pull up my shirt and my mom yelps. she sees the
scars for some reason. she takes me to the hospital. but they say
that those must have been there for a while. but i know
different, i say they weren’t there the night before. and they say
that we were just freaking out.
the next day i was making a sandwich, and while i was i saw
the figure as i was slicing the tomatoes. i yelp as the blade slices
through my right thumb going down the length of my thumb.

 but as i watch i see the wound seal itself until there is nothing but
a jagged scar. i am mesmerized as i replay the flesh sealing itself
in my mind. then i see the figure standing there with a wicked
grin. he says in the creepiest voice i’ve heard in my life. it was a
voice mixed with all of my loved ones voices in it. he says in his
voice that he wouldn’t want me to get hurt before the ritual. i
almost pass out i ask what ritual. he waits a moment as if
deciding whether to tell me or not. he finally decides to tell me
after what seemed like hours. 

he says that he will take over my
body in the next full moon and that there is no stopping him. i
faint i see mom standing over me sad looking as if someone died.
she acts like a broken record, saying the same thing over and
over again. i ask her what is wrong and she says in a demonic
voice, it’s too late i have taken over you. and everything morphed
into an evil, demonic version of my house. there i have been ever
since the incident. 

he sent me to the version of my world that
made sense, where there were no lies. everything was as it is
supposed to be. and i have embraced it. i say with a demonic grin.
