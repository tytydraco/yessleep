This story is true. I know “everything in this sub is true, even if it’s not,” but this is 100% true. 

No exaggeration—explanation will be fairly cut and dry (if verbose), simply reporting an event and the circumstances surrounding it. 

I want you to do the speculating. 

It’s Halloween and I don’t live in this apartment anymore. Terrify me.

By the way, just to contextualize this slightly before you get into it, I’m a woman in my early 30s. The first time I lived alone at 22, I was still afraid of the dark. Also, living alone rules, but there was an adjustment period of not feeling quite as safe as I do when I’m sharing a roof with at least one other person or even a dog. And yeah, okay, today as I write this, I’m still pretty afraid of the dark.

But I wasn’t afraid of this apartment. I’m grown. I felt at home there immediately. I was lucky to have found it in a super competitive rental market, too. It was far and away my best living situation yet of a dozen.

Then something weird happened.

One day in July of 2021, I got home. I hadn’t been there for a few days. 

It was a nice day, but scorching. Felt great to be home. I walked up to my door from the parking lot, expecting to see a package on my doormat because I’d gotten a notification that it was delivered, along with a photo of it in front of the door. 

Surprisingly, it wasn’t there. I thought, ha, this is by far the lowest-crime area I’ve ever lived in, and a package thief finally got me. 

I wanted to just take care of it right away, so I set down my stuff, went directly to my couch, got on Amazon on my phone and started the process of letting them know the item appeared to have been taken and I needed it to be replaced. 

Right before I hit the submit button for the request, I looked up from my phone, and something on my coffee table caught my eye. It hadn’t been there when I left.

It was a package. 

A rectangular prism of a package, addressed to me, neatly placed in the dead center of the table, with all four sides parallel to the table’s edges.

I was confused, but not yet concerned. 

I opened it. 

Inside was the item I was in the process of reporting missing. Up until now, an item that had ostensibly been stolen from the other side of a locked door.

Maintenance must have come in to do something routine and brought in the package as a courtesy. 

I went to my kitchen to look for the sheet of paper they would have routinely left behind with a date, time of entry, and what had been done. There wasn’t one, which bothered me because I definitely wanted to be informed of every entry.

I emailed the manager of the complex asking what maintenance had been performed while I was gone and mentioned that I was confused because I hadn’t asked for anything, and whoever came by hadn’t left any documentation, which I knew was standard. 

She wrote back. She’d checked the system. Nobody who worked there had entered my apartment since the previous month. 

I immediately felt chills up my spine reading the biggest mind-fuck of an email in recent memory. I called her and explained what had happened with the package because obviously that meant the system wasn’t correct. How could it be?

It surprised me that she showed next to zero concern. I assume she presumed that I was mistaken and had brought the package in myself and forgotten. 

That, or she didn’t want to acknowledge that it was beyond bizarre that a package magically made its way past a steel door. That meant a security problem. That meant rumors of break-ins or employees crossing boundaries. Shit, that even opens the door to the possibility that a ghost butler is moving through walls, going the extra mile for residents out of the kindness of his cold, dead heart. 

She ignored the fact that I was clearly extremely shaken, having reported to her something that made zero sense, likely afraid that I might do a number of things that would cause a ruckus, and therefore, problems for her. Or maybe she just didn’t give a shit. Who knows.

I’m sure your brain is trying to find a reasonable explanation, as was mine. I’m sure you’ve already figured out one, maybe two possibilities for what MUST have happened. 

So let me be clear about a few important factors:

1. As I said, I hadn’t been home for a few days—three days to be exact. The package had been delivered the day before. I’d already left my apartment for the three days when I ordered it. Most obvious explanation ruled out—impossible that I’d brought it in prior to leaving and simply forgotten.

2. I lived on the first floor and confirmed that all the windows and the sliding glass door were locked when I moved in the month before. They hadn’t been opened yet because it was summer in a hot-as-hell, southern US state. There were also screens on every window. My sliding glass door had a simple lock, as well as a more advanced mechanism that made it impossible to enter from outside without just shattering it and moseying in. 

3. My door had a digital lock to which only I knew the 5-digit code. 

I knew from talking to the complex’s office that in the case that someone who worked there needed to access my apartment, it was impossible for them to find my personal code anywhere—they would instead have to go to the office, generate a temporary code that would be logged in the system and attached to their name, the code would only work one time and expire in 24 hours, and there would be record of the exact time it was used to enter.

Another security benefit to the fancy door with the electronic lock: I locked it with the push of a button when I left, but in the event that I might forget, once closed, the lock automatically armed itself after one minute. 

4. Nothing was missing. Just a few inches away from the package there was even about $100 in cash lying in plain sight. 

——-

No way in for anything larger than a cockroach. No sign of forced entry. No sign of burglary. No keys to the apartment even existed. I was many miles away for days.

When I tell you I would have moved the next day if I could have…in a heartbeat. Wanted nothing to do with the place anymore. This had to be a person, right? And whoever it was, how could they possibly have good intentions? I’ll never not get chills when I think about this. But I finished the lease, and there were never any security concerns the rest of my time there.

I love horror, but I’m still the type to get scared when I see a *trailer* for a scary movie. But never again did I ever get spooked by a single thing in this apartment. That is, once the shock of the package wore off in time. It was quiet, comfortable, and apart from the package, seemed to be the most secure place I’ve ever lived, just as planned.

It’s undeniable that there are several logical explanations, but none of them make any real sense to me. And on top of that, nonetheless, they wouldn’t be explanations that would bring me a single ounce of comfort. That’s why I don’t even like to think about it.

So.

What. The. Fuck. Happened?
