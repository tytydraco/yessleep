The unknown howl of a beast pierced through the darkness, sending shivers down my spine. I found myself alone, accompanied only by my two loyal Shepherds. As a wilderness hunter with legal rights to hunt, I was no stranger to the dangers of the wild. However, this night was different. My dogs sensed something amiss, their alertness evident in their behavior. With caution, I ventured deeper into the wilderness, determined to uncover the source of this unearthly sound.

The howl that echoed through the night was unlike anything I had ever heard before. It was a grotesque symphony of distorted animal cries, as if a lion, elephant, and other creatures had merged into one abomination. Fear consumed me as I struggled to locate the origin of this monstrous noise. Disoriented by the lack of visibility, I could only rely on my hearing, which seemed to betray me as the howls grew closer and then faded into the distance.

To my dismay, I realized that we were the only living beings in this desolate place. No other animals roamed the area, leaving me alone with my two faithful companions. Suddenly, without any apparent reason, Lori, one of my dogs, began growling at an unseen presence. The darkness enveloped us, and I futilely attempted to calm her down. But her aggression escalated, and even Oxlin, my second dog, joined in, circling me protectively. It was as if they were possessed by an unseen terror, turning against me.

Driven by sheer terror, I fled from my once loyal companions, my heart pounding in my chest. The haunting howls seemed to command an unseen force, and then I heard it—the whimpering of my dogs. I discovered Lori, wounded and marked by an unknown assailant, her life hanging by a thread. In a desperate rush, I carried her in my arms, with Oxlin following closely behind, as we sought refuge in a nearby cabin.

Inside the cabin, I found no signs of life. The eerie silence only heightened my anxiety. I secured the doors and windows, doing everything in my power to fortify our sanctuary. But my efforts were in vain. Thirty minutes later, a series of deafening bangs reverberated through the cabin, growing louder and more forceful with each strike. It was as if this malevolent entity possessed an intelligence beyond comprehension.

As I fled upstairs with my dogs, I caught a glimpse of the creature. Towering over us, it stood on its hind legs, resembling a grotesque hybrid of human and beast. Its roar echoed through my very soul, instilling a terror that defied imagination. I tended to Lori's wounds, but the stress and fear overwhelmed me, causing me to lose consciousness.

When I awoke, the relentless banging had ceased. Two hours had passed, and an eerie silence enveloped the surroundings. Venturing outside, I discovered the aftermath of the creature's rampage—scrapes, broken objects, and a footprint that seemed to belong to a mythical creature serving the forces of darkness. In a rush, I share this harrowing tale, a chilling account based on true events
