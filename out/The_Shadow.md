I was just a child when I first saw the shadow.

I've always had trouble sleeping. I've always woken multiple times throughout the night, my sleep constantly interrupted. Some might say it's 'disturbed' though it's only disturbing when I wake, because that's when I see it.

At first, it was harmless. It lingered, still in the corners or against the walls. It never moved, save an odd static-like thrum that engulfed it if I stared for long enough. Sometimes I could convince myself it was just the shadow of a coat hanging on the back of my bedroom door, or an object I couldn't quite make out and my eyes were playing tricks on me, even though I knew deep down that wasn't the case.

After a few months, it started to move closer. I'd awaken in the night to see it standing at the side of my bed. Still, it didn't move. It just existed there, standing, motionless....*waiting*. It's a feeling I could never quite explain.

When I didn't feel brave enough to hide under my duvet until I could lull myself back to sleep, I'd shout out to my parents - small whispers that would claw their way out of my throat until they turned into semi screams and my parents would wake, turn my light on and bring me into their room so I could sleep in their bed. The shadow never went into their room.

My parents tried to convince me that my eyes were playing tricks on me too. I always told them, how can shadows simply appear in the dark? It never made sense. But they'd tell me that the streetlights or the moon would reflect into my room and it was normal.

They bought me nightlights, which worked. They'd leave the hall light on for me, which also worked. Then they'd turn all of the lights off when I was asleep and I'd wake to the shadow again. My mum bought a pretty pink canopy which hooked into the ceiling and draped around my bed, hoping it would make me feel safer. It only made me feel more trapped when I'd see the shadow standing behind the canopy, enveloping the side of my bed in its darkness as it watched me, always lingering and always *waiting*.

After a few years, it stopped. I don't know what changed, but it went away. As I grew older, I began to forget about it. I started to lead a normal life - socialising, working, moving out and being a normal person.

For the first time, life started to feel alright and I figured I'd just had a very imaginative mind as a child.

My parents moved to a new house when I was around 19. I'd visit them and everything would be normal. Occasionally, the shadow would come up in conversation but we'd always laugh about it. "Rose, you were so funny as a child, always able to imagine such things! You really had us going for some time!"

It wasn't until I was in my mid 20's when I finally saw it again and I wish I hadn't.

I was visiting my parents for a few days, a well needed break from the stress of adult life. It started off as a normal trip home - said hi to their cats, dad made tea, my mum showed me her new DIY projects, we went out on a walk and we ended the day with a movie together. It was lovely. My parents headed on up to bed and I'd decided to stay downstairs in the living room for a bit longer. It had been a while since I'd been down to visit and there was something about being there, around all the things I grew up around (even in a different house) that felt really nice and nostalgic. I'd been looking through old family photos when I heard one of the cats hiss. I looked up and noticed Tiggy, the eldest and biggest of the cats, staring at the doorway. His back was hunched, hair sticking up, and his face was certainly a picture. I figured one of the other cats were in the hallway, fronting him up. There are seven of them and they always fight so it's never a suprise to me to see them act like this.

I sighed and went to go and grab him but as I neared the doorway, I saw what he was staring at and my breath caught in my throat.

There, standing still in the doorway, was the shadow.

The same shadow that had haunted me throughout my entire childhood.

I've never been a fight or flight type of person. It's one of my downfalls. In any situation that involves tension, danger, basically anything negative whatsoever, I freeze. So I stood there, frozen, my heart threatening to escape from my body as I stared at the form in front of me.

Tiggy hissed, a more gutteral hiss followed by a low growl. I backed away slowly, refusing to take my eyes off of the shadow until my back hit one of the living room walls and I bombed it to the sofa.

I must have been up for hours staring towards the doorway, waiting for the shadow to emerge into the living room, but it never did. Eventually Tiggy calmed and returned to his normal cat behaviours and I must have fallen asleep as I woke to my parents nudging me awake, asking me if I was okay and if I wanted a cup of tea.

I spent the rest of that weekend in fear, the hairs on the back of my neck standing up every time I walked into that hallway. I spent my remaining nights there in my parents room with the excuse that we could huddle up and watch movies together, then conveniently falling asleep before they could send me out. They must have known something was up but they didn't question it.

When I returned home, I began to leave my hallway light on at night. As I'd grown older, I'd managed to work my way up to sleeping in the dark again but for the first time in years, I found myself caving to my terror. I was almost sure I wouldn't see *it* in my own home but I didn't want to take that risk.

Unfortunately, the light wasn't enough.

A few weeks later, I woke during the early hours. As you know by now, this wasn't uncommon but nowadays I usually just woke up to go to the toilet or have some water. As I sat up, reaching towards my bedside table, I couldn't help but notice a deep, static humming. I froze for a moment then slowly turned my head towards my bedroom door, the light from the hall stretching through.

I wish I hadn't looked.

There it stood, at the end of my bed, it's form more prominent than ever. A form so dark it almost glowed against the illuminated grey that was the rest of my room. For the first time, I could see it in its entirety. Not just a shadow, but an entire being. An entity.

I sat there, my arm still stretched out towards my bedside table, staring at it. That same static thrumming surrounded it, enveloping it as some sort of aura. Then, it moved.

I felt my blood go cold as it bent forward, two pitch black voids glaring at me....no, *into* me. It opened what I can only presume was its mouth and before I could register what was happening, a deep, thrumming voice surrounded me, enveloping me and boring its way into my skull.

*"I have been waiting"*

I felt those words echo in my head, bouncing around my skull in such a deep, numbing *pain*. I finally moved without thinking, my hands rushing to cover my ears as my eyes squeezed shut, but it did nothing to ease the thunder I felt in my brain. Then, as suddenly as it had happened, it stopped. I let out a breath I hadn't even known I was holding, gasping for air as my eyes opened to scan the room, frantically searching for the shadow, but it had disappeared.

I managed a few more weeks before it happened again. I kept trying to convince myself I was having nightmares, that I was making it all up. I tried my best to focus on work, to focus on general day to day life. I bought night lights. Outdid myself during the days so that I'd be more exhausted come the evenings, not that it made sleep come any easier.

Every time I managed to get myself to a place where I was able to sleep again, able to breathe and live almost normally again, it came back. My friends noticed that something was up. My parents noticed and started to worry. I stopped returning calls. Stopped going out. I booked time off work, I couldn't focus any more. I completely withdrew. I tried to research as much as I could but nothing was giving me results.

Each time the shadow returned, it came with more words that burned into my brain, painful and seething.


*I've been watching you for so long*

*I am always here*

*I am always watching*

*I'm getting closer*


Then, as quickly as it had re-emerged into my life, it disappeared again. I wish I could say that life returned to normal but it never really did. I remained withdrawn, only communicating and socialising when I had to. I started therapy, but I couldn't tell them the truth. I told them I was having trouble sleeping, that I suffered with recurring 'night terrors'. I bounced between different therapists in desperate hope (or a hopeful delusion) that something might help. They gave me some good coping techniques but the core of the problem was never going to be fixed.

"Did you experience any trauma throughout your childhood?"

*The nightmares are my childhood trauma*

"We suggest you book in with your GP, it seems you could be suffering from a sleep disorder"

Of course I didn't follow through with their suggestions. A doctor would see that I'm physically fine and dismiss me, rightfully so. How could I have a sleep disorder if I experience these 'nightmares' when I'm awake? But I couldn't tell a professional that.

After a while, though things never really returned to normal, I had moments where I could convince myself that it was all okay. But it isn't. That's why I'm writing this now.

See, I'm 27 now. This has been happening for years. Haunting me for years. I have no one I can reach out to about this, not really, and as time goes on it only grows worse.

Last night, it happened again. It started up again last year, slowly, but last night was different. When I woke up, it was bent over, it's face directly in front of mine.

I don't know what it's waiting for or what's taking it so long but I don't know if I want to find out the hard way. Because whatever it wants, it's getting closer and I can almost feel it *in* me, like it wants to take over my entire body. It took 2 decades for it to start clawing its way into my brain, but I think it wants more. Every time it returns, I feel myself slip away a little bit more and I think I'm letting it in but I don't want to.

I'm so scared. I'm too scared to sleep. It's almost 2am, I'm so exhausted, but I don't know what to do. It could come back in a week, it could come back in a month, it could come back in an hour but I don't want to see it again. What does it want? Whatever it wants, what's taking so long? Does it want me? *Why* does it want me? How much time do I have? When will it be back?

I'm so exhausted. I'm so tired. Has anyone else experienced this?

If you've made it this far, thank you. Genuinely. Getting this all off of my chest has taken a massive weight off of my shoulders but I still have so many questions and I'm desperate for answers. I just don't know why this has been happening to me.
