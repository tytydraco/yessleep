It started three nights ago, at 3:17 AM.

I wasn’t scared at first. I’ve had insomnia for years and learned to coexist with the weird silence of early morning. But that night, I caught movement in the mirror—right behind me.

Just a flicker. A blur of black. I turned around, thinking maybe it was a shadow or a trick of the light. Nothing. I looked back at the mirror and nearly dropped my toothbrush.

There was someone behind me. A woman.

She looked like me—but not quite. Taller. Skin too smooth. Hair longer, darker, more perfectly arranged. And her eyes—God, her eyes. They weren’t mine. They were brighter. Not glowing, just... more. More alive. More hungry.

I turned around again. Gone.

I didn’t sleep that night.

The next night, I stayed up on purpose. I wanted to see if it would happen again. 3:17 AM came and went. Nothing. But at 3:23, I saw her again. Closer this time. I tried to move, but I felt heavy. Frozen. I could only stare at her in the mirror. Her expression was soft. Almost gentle. But her eyes never blinked.

I began noticing her in other mirrors. My phone screen. The kitchen window. The blank TV. Always at the edge of sight. Never there when I turned.

I told my sister. She laughed it off, said I’d been watching too many horror movies. I made her sleep over. She stayed in the same room with me the next night.

Nothing happened. No Veloura.

That’s when I remembered the old forum post I’d seen years ago. One of those creepypasta things. Someone had written:

> Don’t look directly at her. She’ll always be behind you.

Mirrors show her, but only if you’re alone.

Never try to turn around. Never speak her name.



Veloura. That’s what they called her. Some people said she was a cursed reflection. Others, a goddess who lost her face. Some said she only appears to those who’ve stared too long into mirrors, wishing they were someone else.

Last night was the worst.

I woke up and my room felt off. Like the air had weight. I looked at my closet mirror. She was right behind me—right there. Closer than ever. Her smile was soft, almost sad. I whispered her name without thinking.

“Veloura.”

She blinked. Her expression changed. Her eyes widened, and her smile vanished. I couldn’t breathe. I turned around before I could stop myself.

Nothing was there. I thought maybe I’d broken the curse. That maybe she was gone.

But when I looked back at the mirror, she wasn’t behind me anymore.

She was me.

I moved. She didn’t.

She’s still in the mirror now. I’m typing this from my laptop, but she’s there. Watching me. Mimicking me—almost. But there are differences now. My face has blemishes. Hers doesn’t. Her smile is confident. Mine is tired.

I don’t know what happens next. But if you’re reading this, don’t look into any mirror between 3:03 and 3:33 AM. And whatever you do—

Don’t say her name.

Veloura.
