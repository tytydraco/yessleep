The truth is, I was a bad kid. Not just mischievous, but calculatingly cruel. I chose easy targets whose suffering I could measure. There was a boy in my class, Thomas, short and scrawny, always wearing clothes that looked too big or too small. He came from a family so poor, the school waived his lunch fees, and everyone knew it. I thought he was pathetic. 

I still remember his face on the day of the class Secret Santa. He opened his gift and pulled out a cheap football. He held it like it was solid gold, his eyes shining with pure joy. That football was likely the best gift he would receive that Christmas. 

Later, in the muddy school courtyard, I walked up to him, said some casual, vicious thing about his mother’s thirdhand clothes, and snatched the ball right out of his hands. I booted it in a soaring arc until it landed squarely on the inaccessible section of the gymnasium roof. I watched the joy drain from his face and felt a temporary, hollow satisfaction bloom in my chest. It made the weight of my own mediocre life slightly lighter. 

It was sometime after midnight. I was asleep, dreaming about the next insult I could deploy, when I heard a faint whisper on the other side of my bedroom door. Curiosity pulled me out of bed. I opened the door, and the whisper grew louder, drawing me down the staircase. It sounded feminine, soft, and angelic. I tried to wake up my parents, shaking my dad’s shoulder, but his breathing was deep and unnatural, almost like a coma. 

Something subconscious within me forced me downstairs until I stepped into the living room. The first snow of the season was falling outside, and the white glow of a nearby streetlight made the room feel alien and cold. On the coffee table, the cookies my mom had left out for the fat man in red were gone; only a few crumbs remained on the plate.  

The whispers were coming from the granite hearth, vibrating from deep within the chimney. I stared into the dark opening, and the sound suddenly cut out. A red stocking cap was shoved violently over my head, blinding me. Then a powerful vacuum materialized in the fireplace, dragging me toward the opening. The metal flue was still hot, and the residual heat bit into my bare skin as I was sucked inside. 

I started feeling lighter until I was practically falling upwards, as if gravity had reversed itself entirely. I struggled, my fingernails scraping against the rough, soot-covered walls, and my arms became bruised from being squeezed through a narrow section of the chimney. The heat finally receded and was replaced by freezing air. I landed inside a massive hemp sack, heard a drawstring being pulled tight below me, and then everything went black. 

I woke up to a dozen eyes staring down at me. I was lying on a thin mattress in a crowded room. The light was sickly yellow, and the air smelled of old wood, varnish and mold. 

“Where… where am I?” I gasped, pulling myself up. My clothes were covered in soot, and my arms stung, but the bruises had been replaced by just a few faint red marks. 

A boy, maybe eight years old, with huge, vacant eyes and a perpetually sad expression, shuffled closer to the edge of the top bunk. “You’re in the workshop, same as the rest of us.” 

A girl, with hair the color of tarnished brass continued: “This is where you work off your debt." 

Before I could demand an explanation, a loud, high-pitched bell chimed three times. Every child in the room instantly shoved themselves into their bunks and buried their faces into their threadbare blankets. 

The door flew open. Standing there was not a man, but a short, grotesquely thin creature with olive-green skin, spindly fingers, and a snarling grimace. It looked like the Grinch, had the Grinch been starved for a decade. 

“LINE UP!” The creature shrieked. 

We marched down a dim corridor until it opened into what I would come to know as the Lacquer Hall. It was impossibly vast, stretching farther than any building I had ever seen. Wooden beams loomed overhead; polished stone walls fitted with countless wooden doors and above, a glass roof revealed a moonless night sky. Hundreds of children, none older than twelve, stood in silence at long, grime-coated workbenches, their faces pale and hands dirty. On a raised platform in the center sat a taller figure draped in red, impossibly still, as if carved from wood. It had a long, red, pointed hat and sat with its hands resting neatly in its lap. The children looked down, focusing on their work to avoid its gaze. 

The revolting elf pointed a long, bony finger at me. “No talking. No playing. No taking. Every item must be immaculate. If Inspection finds fault, the debt is not forgiven, but increased. Any disruption, any failure, and you will be taken for correction. Understood?” 

I nodded dumbly. I was shoved toward a bench near the middle of the line. Before me lay an endless parade of raw footballs, the exact model I had kicked onto the roof. My task was to paint the black pattern onto the white fabric. 

A little ways down the line, a small boy working on a chessboard accidentally elbowed a pot of black paint, sending black drops onto the white squares. He whimpered. The bell chimed again, and an elf appeared instantly, grabbing the boy by his arm. 

The child screamed, "I'm sorry! I'll fix it! Please, I'll fix it!" But the elf merely dragged him away toward a big wooden door. 

"What... what happens to him?" I whispered to the boy next to me, who was methodically varnishing a wooden train. 

The boy didn't look up. "They... They come back. But they're different." 

Hours later, the bell chimed again. We were marched back to our rooms and given a thin metal bowl of flavorless porridge and a single, perfectly segmented orange slice. 

I sat on my bunk, scraping the bowl. “How long have you all been here?” 

The boy from earlier, named Peter, answered first. "We don't know the counting. It’s always dark outside; we call it the Longest Night." 

I swallowed. “The truth is… I was a bully. I made fun of people, stole their things… I regret everything I’ve done.” 

Andrew, sitting across from me, looked up and said with a serious tone: “It doesn’t matter now. You devastated another child's joy. We are all here for the same reason.” 

Peter continued with a hollow expression. "I took the alms from the church poor box after the Christmas Mass. I took copper and silver both”. 

"I took the comfort doll belonging to someone in my class and cut it into pieces. She took it everywhere, and I thought she was too old to still be carrying it around. She lost her only friend”. Andrew said, now clearly ashamed of his actions. 

I shook my head. “There must be a way out. Some mistake. Some rule we don’t know.” 

“There isn’t. Not unless you do what he cannot see… something no one has ever done.” 

Cycle after cycle, the bell chimed, the elves shrieked, and we were marched out to the benches to finish the impossible debt. I painted the black pattern onto the footballs with mechanical precision, trying to mimic the perfect obedience of my peers who had already begun to physically pay their debt. 

The boy who had spilled the paint now sat painting tiny chess pieces, his work flawless. But his skin had taken on a faint, green tint; his once-dark hair was patchy and dull, and his eyes were sunken in and lifeless. He didn’t look like a person anymore; he looked like a machine wearing a dead boy’s skin. 

Peter whispered to me: “He is a part of the system now. We turn the joy we stole into the service that keeps the joy circulating for others. That's how we all end up if we stay long enough." 

I glanced up at the raised platform. The overseer on the shelf remained still, its face frozen in a sickly smile. I realized its gaze was not merely punitive. It was tracking our despair, waiting for the moment the last of our joy was extinguished, preparing us for the final transformation. 

In our sleeping cell, the despair was the most palpable around a girl named Mary. She was perhaps the smallest among us, perpetually silent and clung to her bunk. Each cycle, she wept herself to sleep, her hopeless sobs a terrible contrast to the silent acceptance of the older boys. Whatever her sin, her suffering was deeper than the rest of us. 

As the next cycle started, a batch of exquisite, small wooden angel figures, classic Christmas symbols, passed by on the assembly line close to my bench. Suddenly, the bell chimed across the Lacquer Hall. An elf rushed toward a child who had accidentally dropped a toy soldier and broken its fragile arm. Every head, from the long-term-debtors to the freshly corrected boy, looked toward the ensuing commotion. Most importantly, the gaze of the overseer was fixed on the child. In a swift move that felt like screaming without a sound, I grabbed one of the small, beautiful angel figures as it passed by and tucked it deep into my pants pocket. 

That *night*, after the rations of porridge and the single orange slice, the cell fell silent except for the sound of Mary’s quiet weeping. I crept out of my bunk and ripped off a piece of my soot-stained shirt and used it to awkwardly wrap the angel figure. 

I walked over to her bunk. "Mary," I whispered, holding out the present. "For you." 

Her face, tear-streaked and pale, turned toward me. She stared at the small gift and after a moment that stretched into an eternity, she slowly took it from my hands. Her small fingers trembled as she unwrapped it. 

She saw the angel. She didn't examine its quality or size; she looked at it as though it were the only glimmer of light in her endless night. She raised the wooden figure gently, and then she did something that felt louder than any factory bell: she smiled. A small, genuine, expression of wonder and gratitude. 

The moment a selfless gift was given and received in the heart of the Workshop, I had introduced a variable that the system could not categorize or measure. 

An overwhelming wave of cold hit me where I stood. My vision blurred, the sickly yellow light warping into long streaks. My head spun and I felt like falling again, but this time downwards, until I hit the cold ground. I lay in a pile of fresh, powdered snow in my backyard.  

My bruises had healed, but my clothes were mangled and covered in soot and paint. I stood up, ignoring the deep chill that had begun to settle in my bones. I presumed my debt, for now, had been paid. I had been given a second chance, and I wasn't going to waste it. The only thing on my mind was to find Thomas.
