It’s been a few days since the package was delivered and my stomach still hasn’t unknotted itself. I’ve gotten some weird looks from my mom and dad, but I’ve tried to play it cool in front of them. The soggy package is still in my closet, I'm too scared to open it. Then a few days ago in the evening I heard a car pull up. I peeked out my window and saw Mr. B talking to a man in his front yard. I recognized him as one of the men with Mr. B in June. I ducked as they both turned to look at my house. He didn’t stay long, and Mr. B went right inside after.

&#x200B;

The next morning he called me over as I was leaving for school. Started asking the same BS questions that grown ups always do about school. Then he looked me straight in the eye and asked me something that made my stomach jump up into my throat.

&#x200B;

“Stu Corbett came by last night. He was pretty upset. I guess he got a weird package delivered yesterday. You wouldn’t happen to know anything about that would you, Dylan?”

&#x200B;

I stammered out a “no, sir”, but I don’t think he totally believed me. He let me go, but I felt him watching me as I biked away.

&#x200B;

Tonight after dinner I went right back up to my room. I’ve always been a bit of a weird kid, but I can tell my mom and dad know something is up. They keep gently asking about school and friends, not that I have any. I feel stuck, and stupid. If I’d just told them what Mr. B and his friends had done when it had happened then none of this would be going on. Then I remembered Mr. B’s hand on my shoulder. No, telling them would have created a whole different problem. I was accepted in my neighborhood, but barely. Mr. B was a pillar of our community, a family man. At best I wouldn’t be believed, at worst it would be dangerous. Better to do what I do best, turtle up and wait for it to pass.

&#x200B;

It took all of one night for that strategy to fall apart completely. The next morning I was eating breakfast when I heard it. A deep, guttural growl, followed by slow footsteps in the hallway above me. My blood froze and I sat, rooted to my chair. I knew I was alone in the house. The sounds stopped and silence stretched on. I felt like it was waiting for me, whatever *it* was. Against every instinct in my body, I crept over to the staircase and looked up. Nothing waited to pounce from above. I made my way up the stairs and clapped my hand over my mouth when I reached the top. Wet, muddy footprints made their way from my room to the top of the stairs, then vanished. I let out a muffled scream as our doorbell rang.

&#x200B;

A small man greeted me when I flung open our front door, glancing nervously behind me. He was older, well dressed, and had kind eyes. I couldn’t place his accent, but his voice sounded polished and almost musical.

&#x200B;

“Hello young man! My name is Rohan Singh. May we speak for a moment?”

&#x200B;

‘I- y- Yes, how can I help you?” I managed to stammer out, closing the door firmly behind me. He flashed me a warm smile and reached out a hand. His hand was dark, warm and dry and  the moment  it enclosed mine, I felt all my fear leave. My stomach unknotted. I felt so relieved that I almost started crying, but held it together as he began.

&#x200B;

“As I said, my name is Rohan Singh. I am in the employ of a family of a man named Rajat Seth, do you mind if I ask you a few questions?”

&#x200B;

“Sure? I guess. I don’t know anyone by that name though” I began, half focused on this conversation, and half focused on the possible monster lurking in my house behind me.

&#x200B;

“Not to worry! I have a photograph here somewhere.” He let go of my hand and began to search his suit. Almost immediately the anxiety and fear came creeping back. Then it doubled when he held out a photograph toward me. As I stared at the face of the man, I felt my mouth go dry. I was transported to the day in June, watching a man be flung to the ground in front of me.

&#x200B;

“I- uh, no. I haven’t seen him before, ever, sorry Mr. Singh” I stammered out. His eyes remained kind, but turned penetrating. “Are you sure?” He asked gently, “This young man’s family is incredibly worried about him.”

&#x200B;

I stared at him, and everything wanted to bubble up and over. Over his shoulder I heard Mr.B’s truck start up, and I felt myself withdraw.

&#x200B;

“No sir.” I lied, hating myself, “But... I hope you can find him.”

&#x200B;

“Thank you, me as well. Also, please, call me Rohan.” He smiled at me, almost sadly and handed me a card, telling me to call him if I thought of anything at all. He turned to walk back to his car. I saw Mr. B staring at him from his truck next door, but Rohan didn’t turn his head once to look at Mr. B.

&#x200B;

Not wanting to go back into my house, or face Mr. B, I quickly locked my front door and hopped on my bike and headed for school. I was almost to the school when a big SUV pulled up alongside me and kept pace with my bike. I looked inside and saw Rick Marshall, the third man in Mr. B’s posse from that day in June. He kept his window up and didn’t say anything, just stared me down. I hurried into the school. When I looked back, he was still watching me from the parking lot.

&#x200B;

The day passed with agonizing slowness. Then I came home to a full-on crap sandwich from my mom, I’d forgotten all about the muddy footprints in the hallway. Or maybe, I’d expected the monster-ghost footprints to disappear on their own? Whatever the case, I was in the dog house. I promised my mom that I’d clean up and take out the garbage. Whatever I needed to do to get her off my case. I cleaned up and got through dinner, it was dark before I got to the garbage. Mr. B cornered me as I brought the trash down to the sidewalk. He waved to my mom and asked if he could borrow me for a second, steering me toward his open garage door.

&#x200B;

“Explain to me what the fuck this is, Dylan” he spat at me, shoving me against his garage wall and gesturing toward his work bench. A soggy, burnt package just like the one in my room sat on the bench.

&#x200B;

“I- don’t know sir,” I managed to reply.

&#x200B;

“Is this a joke of yours boy? Something you and that *friend* of yours cooked up?” He growled at me and I was reminded of how huge he was. I smelled beer on his breath and felt small, smaller than usual.

&#x200B;

“No sir. He was asking about Rajat- the man from June. I didn’t tell him anything though, I swear.” My words kept tripping over the others. Mr. B stared at me like he was staring right through to my core, I felt like I was going to piss myself. When he spoke, he was deadly calm.

&#x200B;

“Dylan, I’m going to choose to believe you this time. I think the man that came to see you today is in cahoots with the same gang we saw in June, you understand?”

&#x200B;

I didn’t, but he was huge, so I nodded vigorously.

&#x200B;

“Good man, now listen. If this man contacts you again, I want you to tell me, is that clear? If anything out of the ordinary happens, you tell me. Understood?”

&#x200B;

Unable to speak, I just nodded.

&#x200B;

“Good. I’m glad we had this talk, son. It’s dark, better get inside.” He released me and I tripped over myself getting away from him.

&#x200B;

I stared at the package in my closet for a long time before going to bed. I felt Rohan’s card in my pocket. It felt like a talisman. Whenever I held it, the knots in my stomach went away. I felt normal. I fell asleep with it cradled in my chest.

&#x200B;

I woke up the next morning and cautiously poked my head into the hallway, heart pounding. I felt like a little kid looking for monsters, but thankfully the coast was clear. I made breakfast and scrolled through social media while I ate, until a headline made me drop my spoon.

&#x200B;

*Local Man found dead in pool*.

Underneath was a picture of Stu Corbett.
