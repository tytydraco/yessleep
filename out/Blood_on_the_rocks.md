The sky was that kind of flawless blue that you only see in paintings, the pretty flowers so shocking orange that they almost gave off heat.  Or maybe it was just the sun, up there on that mountaintop, as close to God as you can get without burning to a crisp.  We had been blessed with a glorious day, as fine as you could ask for.

 

If we were going to have to kill my sister, this day was as good as any.

 

I had known, as soon as Mary Katherine started having her fits, that it was going to come to this.  The same thing had happened to our mother, when I was only five, and to her sister and my grandmother and any number of the womenfolk in our family.  It was the source of much of our shame and dishonor, and even though nobody ever came out and said something about it to any of us, you could still feel it in their stares.  The way that people would hush up and stop talking when we came in to the daily service, looking at us out of the corners of their eyes.  You could hear it in whispers floating behind your head as you walked through the general store, buzzing around you like flies buzz around our old nag Deuteronomy.  You knew without hearing what they were saying, what you had been born into, the blood red stigma that you wore like the mark of Cain.  All of us, the entire Tourette clan, were spoiled, cursed, dirty, and impure.

 

Brother Jakob stood next to the highest rock on the altar, sun shining yellow through his hair and his beard and smoldering in his eyes.  He was a tall man, with a face like the rock cliffs down the valley, hard and worn smooth by the years.  The rest of the town waited on the plains below him, all through the orange flowers, silent and patient, waiting for the great man to speak, and after a long time he finally did.

 

“Brothers and sisters,” he began, lifting his arms over his flock.  “We are gathered here today to…”

 

“SUCK COCKS!  PISS ON YOUR MOTHER’S FACES!  SHIT!  SCABIES!”  Mary Katherine’s entire body shook and bucked against the leather straps holding her to gray rock altar, spit flying in every direction as she screamed obscenities and rolled her eyes and lashed her tongue in an awful manner.  “TITS AND WHORES!  DWARF DICKS!  YOU ALL EAT CUNTS FOR…”

 

Brother Jakob turned on his heel, raised his fist, and slammed it down into Mary Katherine’s stomach and face, over and over, until she finally stopped thrashing and lay there whimpering to herself.  When she turned her head, I could see her looking at me, her voice so small, so scared.  “Samuel…brother… please…” she sniffled the blood and snot from her nose.  “Please help me…”

 

I did nothing.  I turned my eyes away, and back to Brother Jakob.

 

He waited for a second, watching Mary Katherine, and when he saw that she would be quiet, he turned back to us.  “We are gathered here today, brothers and sisters, because of a great evil.”  He swept his arm over my sister, trembling and crying there on the rock.  “An evil that has manifested itself within the flesh of this little girl, one of the Lord’s innocent lambs.  Satan himself has…”

 

“FUCKED ME HARD WITH HIS BIG OLD DEVIL DICK!”  My sister slobbered all over herself and strained her neck up to look at Brother Jakob, veins and tendons bulging, her eyes the size of saucers of milk.  “YOUR MOTHER TOO!  SHE LOVES IT!  SHE HELD THE VIDEOCAM…”

 

Again Brother Jakob’s fists rained down on Mary Katherine’s head and body as she screamed and hollered and talked in languages that none of us had ever heard before.  This continued on for several minutes until finally Brother Jakob sagged and put his hands on his knees, breathing hard for a long time.  Once he was able, he wiped his hands on his vestments, leaving red streaks on the starched white, and motioned to two of our strongest men, Eli and Ezekiel.  They stood on each side of my sister and held her down as she screamed and tried to bite the men, teeth snapping so hard that I could her them smash together from where I stood, fifty feet away, on the very edge of the towns people. 

 

Brother Jakob wiped his brow on the sleeve of his vestment and looked down at my sister, who had stopped screaming and started to cry, her little body racked with sobs.  He just stood there, as if frozen.  After a long time he turned back towards us, and his voice sounded more like a croak.  “This evil that has manifested itself in this little girl is an abomination before God.  An abomination that we know all too well.  One that has plagued our people for hundreds of years, one that preys on the weakest in our flock.  But one that we have stopped before, and will stop again, every time.  With the power of our Lord, we will rid ourselves of this evil, and release the soul of this poor little girl.”  He reached beneath his vestment and pulled out the dagger of St. Barnabus, that which had laid down my mother and her sister and many of the women of our family.  It glinted white in the sun as Brother Jakob turned toward Mary Katherine and raised his arm.  “In the name of the Father, the ruler of Heaven and Earth…”

 

All of a sudden there was a sound like a thunderclap.  The back of Brother Jakob’s robes turned bright red and St. Barnabus’ dagger fell out of this hand, clattering on the rocks below.  As he fell, Eli and Ezekiel held up their hands and slowly backed away from the altar.  My father was there, waving his shotgun, turning towards all of us in town, making us move away.  His eyes passed over me, but I do not think that he saw.  After making sure that no one would attempt to stop him, he ran up to that gray stone altar.

 

Mary Katherine saw him.  “Oh, Papa!  Papa!  You saved me!”  She was barely able to get out the words.  Without thinking, I moved closer to them, to my family.  Our father was crying too, which I had never seen, not even when our mother had been taken.  He loosened the straps holding my sister and pulled her to him, holding her as she wrapped her arms around his neck and her legs around his waist, both of them unable to speak, so overcome with joy and relief.

 

I was about five paces away when Mary Katherine looked at me, smiled, and sunk her fangs into my father’s throat.
