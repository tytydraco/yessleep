I made it out. I’m saying that up front because you need to know I’m not writing this as a goodbye letter from the depths of the facility. I got out. I’m… fine, I guess you could say.

But fuck, was it hard.

I stayed in that room for days. I’m not sure how many, my phone died in the first few hours. And it’s hard to measure time when you’re half-starved and the only sounds are pipes ticking in the walls.

But I read everything. And I mean *everything*. And I learned what they were really doing down there – what they were keeping in the dock, what happened in 1979, and why this place was never meant to be found again.

First off, to state the obvious: the thing they call VESSEL-DWELLER (what I will be referring to as the creature from now on) is the living organism that inhabits the facility. It doesn’t survive in the air or on land like we do. For some reason, it needs a host. A vessel – quite literally, a ship or boat to live inside. That’s how it exists.

Before diving into its history, I need to tell you about the “Office of Marine Integrity” – or as it’s actual, classified designation states: The Thalassian Order.

I found their mission statement printed on aged paper, filed beneath layers of sealed briefings and declassified transmission logs. It was simple. Cold. Authoritative.

*“Identification, observation, containment of marine-bound entities and anomalous sea-based phenomena. Protection of maritime life and the coastal world from that which slips through the cracks of human understanding.”*

According to them, no ocean is ever empty. No silence is ever just silence.

They called themselves the Thalassian Order. Not just a research body – something older. From what I’ve gathered, they’ve been around since the 1400s, officially recognized in 1887 through something called the Maritime Silence Accord.

The treaty was never renewed. But never revoked either. That’s how they still exist – between policy and myth. No government questions them anymore. They just… comply.

Facilities exist beneath atolls, embedded in glacial cliffs, hidden behind innocuous-yet-beckoning hatches. Some are active. Others… not.

But forget the politics. I didn’t stay in that room to read about treaties. I stayed to learn about *it*.

It was first recorded in 1691, found latched inside the hull of a rotting ship off the coast. Myths spread; stories were created – then the ship vanished. It reappeared again in 1977 at the bottom of the ocean – tracked by Facility-ESC-02.

They got approval to study it. But they weren’t careful. The hull broke apart under testing. The creature lost its vessel.

That’s where the 1979 incident comes in.

For the first time in around 300 years, the creature woke – and surfaced. Unfortunately, the next boat it decided to occupy wasn’t deserted.

A fisherman washed up dead. Boat missing. The Order knew instantly.

They retrieved the boat and kept it isolated. This time, they observed—quietly. Carefully. The logs said enough:

>*“Log #9: Entity stable. No movement recorded. No damage to interior.”*

>*“Log #12: Not hostile. Territorial. Avoids direct light.”*

>*“Log #20: Response to loud noise: aggressive. Vessel remains intact.”*

>*“Log #25: Due to increased aggression, subject assigned Protocol UNDERTOW”*

>*“Log #29: All personnel ordered to evacuate. Entity classified as contained-in-place. Facility marked for abandonment.”*

That’s why this place was sealed. They left, as this was the only way of keeping it contained. No more testing, no more contact.

Then I appeared. And now I was stuck inside with the same thing they tried to forget.

Oh, and Protocol UNDERTOW? Apparently, the Order has a whole class system for threats – UNDERTOW means the subject is unpredictable and partially active, requiring soft containment and active monitoring.

It means *don’t touch it and pray it doesn’t move*.

And now I had touched it. Walked through its dock. Breathed the same stale air that clung to it.

No more sounds outside the room. No distant bangs. Just the pipes—still hissing. Still wet.

My phone was dead. My limbs were weak. My rations were running out and whatever hope I had left was rotting in my gut.

One line, buried in a relocation memo:

>“*Remaining subjects: SIREN-NET, RED-ALGAE, and COSMIC-LEECH – transferred to Facility-ESC-01 prior to evacuation*."

I read it three times.

*Subjects.* Plural.

I’d been so fixated on VESSEL-DWELLER, I didn’t stop to consider the rest. What else did they drag out of the sea? What else lurks beneath, waiting to be captured?

It took me hours of digging after that – tearing through decaying filing cabinets, prying open wall panels. That’s when I found it.

A blueprint of the facility.

I laid it flat, smoothing the creases with my hands. There it was.

A tunnel. Thin, almost overlooked. Leading away from the flooded main access shaft Leo and I used before. Marked in fine print:

“Emergency Exit Route. Authorized personnel only.”

I stared at it for minutes. It wasn’t much. A hope buried under decades of dust and protocol.

But it was something.

I packed whatever I could – my flashlight, documents, a crowbar I found. Took a deep, cold breath and opened the door, stepping back into the dry dock.

It was silent. Cold. Just like before.

I made my way slowly towards the other end of the dock, where the tunnel should be.

I passed a hallway where mold bloomed up the walls like bruises. A room full of observation pods – some shattered, others still glowing faintly. Another, a decontamination chamber, long dead.

Then I saw it. Not the creature – not directly.

But in the water at the base of the central dock window, something shifted. Slow, deliberate. A ripple that moved against the current, too smooth to be an accident.

I hurried, trying to reach the tunnel as fast as I could. Eventually, I found a door.

Unmarked. Rusted shut, but familiar – the kind used in old submarines or pressure chambers. I turned the wheel. It groaned, fought me. But it opened.

Beyond it: a descending tunnel. Metal walls. Bone-dry. And far, far at the end, another door.

I started walking.

It was colder in the tunnel.

The air changed with every step – drier, but laced with metal. No sound except my boots against the floor and the occasional creak from above.

There were no signs behind me. No signs of pursuit. But I kept checking anyway.

I reached the end and entered the door, hopeful that I’ll finally escape.

A large chamber, unexpected. On the blueprint, this wasn’t here – it was supposed to lead straight to the exit.

I realized I had a smile on my face, but entering the chamber, it quickly faded.

Still, the room felt safe – wrong, but safe. The buzzing I’d heard the computer room was quieter here, more faded. I flashed my light around, searching for where to go next.

Ahead: one final antechamber. One door stood at the end: emergency red, coated in rust, nearly swallowed by the shadows around it

“That has to be it,” I whispered to myself, the words dry in my throat.

But the air behind me had changed. Heavy. Warped.

Something dripped.

I turned – and realized I hadn’t closed the door.

Wedged into the doorway, its slouched form hunched and its arms dragged behind it. White, eyes locked onto mine — not glowing, not blinking. Just watching.

There was nothing I could do now. ‘It’ll come inside and it’ll end me’, I thought to myself.

I stepped backwards, toward the exit door. It stepped forward.

I considered turning and running, but didn’t get the chance to ponder – The creature steadied its feet for another lunge. I bolted, turning around and focusing on the antechamber.

Somewhere, a loud beeping began – a long-dead security system activated by my sprint or by *it.*

Behind me, the sounds of steel twisting, water splashing. The creature was fast, closing the distance with horrifying ease.

I wasn’t fast enough. That door was too far.

I threw my flashlight behind me. Managed to shake off my backpack without losing speed.

A hiss. A pause. Just one second.

Enough.

I slammed into the door at the end, hands scrambling for the release handle. It fought me, the old rusted wheel refusing to budge.

Behind me, something screeched. It began chasing again. I didn’t have long.

The wheel turned and the door cracked open.

I threw my weight into it – pushed through, and spun around to drag it shut.

The creature was there.

Close. So close.

Its hand reached out, long fingers brushing the doorframe.

I slammed it shut.

A final clung shook the chamber. The creature’s fingers didn’t make it through. But I could still hear it – on the other side.

Breathing.

I didn’t move at first.

Just stood there, hand on the rusted wheel, the other braced against the cold steel of the door.

I stumbled back. My legs felt like hollow rods. Breathing hurt. My lungs burned, throat torn raw from the sprint and the screams I hadn’t realized I made.

The hallway was narrow, angled upward. Each step felt steeper than the last.

I walked. Not sure for how long, time stopped working for me a while ago.

Eventually, I found a hatch.

Sunlight leaked through its rim. Real sunlight.

I pushed it open.

Blinding white. Ocean air. Silence.

I collapsed just outside – half on a rock, half on rusted concrete. This was below the initial hatch I’d entered through. Below the cliffside, on a small space between the rocks and the ocean.

I lay there, face to the sky. Not crying or screaming. Just… breathing.

There were gulls somewhere, and their laughter snapped me out of it.  

My limbs refused to move; every muscle pulsed with pain.

I didn’t take anything out. But maybe it’s better like this. The facility should never be discovered again. The researchers were right to just leave it as it is.

Let the dark things sink. Let them rot in the pressure, in the salt, in the forgotten blue.

Eventually, I sat up. My bones protested, but the worst had passed.

There was nothing in sight – no boats, no people. Just a ragged coastline, sea-slick rocks and the faint rhythm of distant waves.

I don’t know how long I stayed like that. Long enough to remember Leo.

He would’ve said something stupid. Something like “*You owe me drinks for this*” Or, “*Next time, you pick the abandoned hellhole*.”

And for the first time since that door creaked open, I let myself feel the ache of it all – of surviving, of remembering, of knowing no one will ever really believe what I saw.

But maybe that’s how it’s supposed to be.

Some things are better off undisturbed.

I stood. The cliffside stretched above me. Behind, the water was calm.

The hatch door shifted slightly in the wind. Then it stilled.

And I walked away. Not fast. Not far. Just enough to forget the sound of it [breathing](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThalassianOrder/).
