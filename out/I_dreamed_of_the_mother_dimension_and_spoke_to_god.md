I always knew I had some connection with the world of dreams, I've dreamed several times about things that happened in real life later. And I always wake up with that feeling that something has changed in me. But that night... it was different.
I dreamed I was in a place where no human being should be.
It wasn't heaven, it wasn't hell, it wasn't anything that seemed created for humans.
I was on a kind of higher plane, but completely geometric, as if reality had been dismantled and reduced to its most basic form: lines, fractals, gears and raw, ethereal light. And I could see all dimensions at the same time, in all timelines, in fact, time is something that didn't really exist there.

It's not easy to explain this... imagine looking down and seeing thousands of parallel “earths”, one fitted into the other like overlapping pieces of sparkling glass, and each of them moving like part of a giant clock. A conscious watch.

As I watched, I realized that those dimensions were not static.
They were alive. They breathed. They pulsed.
And something (or someone) coordinated everything.

It was then that I saw this.

At the center of the structure, where all dimensions converged, there was a shape.
A perfect triangle, gently floating and rotating.
It was not solid, but made of pulsing lines, as if drawn with breathing light.

And I knew, immediately, what it was.
Not because someone told me, but because the structure itself transmitted this directly into my mind:

“YOU ARE SEEING WHAT YOU SHOULD NEVER SEE.”

The voice was not heard, there was no physical human communication, just a primordial feeling that I was facing something that few (or no one) saw.
The triangle rotated once, and as it did, all the dimensions around me moved with it, like gears trying to keep up with the center of the mechanism. I felt a deep cold.
Not in the body, in the consciousness.
As if everything I experienced had led me there in that dream.

At some point, I tried to look away, in any other direction, but I couldn't.
The triangular shape held me like a magnet, and the more I looked, the more I understood that it was not a symbol of God.

That was God.

And there was absolutely nothing human or benevolent about it. It was just an infinite machine, existing since before existence, spinning dimensions as if they were disposable parts.

I don't remember everything that happened afterwards.
Just flashes.

I saw myself walking through the gear.
I touched something I shouldn't have.
I think I asked if I could come back.

And then… everything went dark.

I blinked.
And I was back in my bed.

But something changed.

Since then, every time I close my eyes, I see luminous streaks spinning.
Little triangles flash in my peripheral vision.
And sometimes, when I'm almost asleep, I hear a low vibration, as if it's coming from behind the world.

I guess I shouldn't have asked to come back.
I don't think you should have seen what I saw.
I don't think it should have been heard so quickly.

Maybe I should have given up my human life and joined the ranks, if that's what they wanted by showing me everything I saw...

And, worst of all:
I have the impression that some gears stopped turning as soon as I left....
