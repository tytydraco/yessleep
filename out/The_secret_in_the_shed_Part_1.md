It was the winter of 1976, and instead of playing with my friends outdoors, I was attending my grandpa’s funeral. I was twelve years old and I’d never been to a funeral before and I didn't know what to expect, but I didn't think it would be like this. Rows of wooden pews stretched out before me, filled with people dressed in black. Some were crying quietly, while others just sat with solemn faces.  
  
At the front of the church, there was a big wooden casket with flowers all around it. That's where they put grandpa. It looked strange to see him lying there so still, like he was just sleeping, but I knew he wasn't going to wake up this time. Mom said he was gone forever, but it was hard to believe because just last week we were ice fishing together at Lake Meade.  
  
There was a man up at the front, dressed in a black suit, talking softly into a microphone. He was saying things about grandpa that made people cry even more. Then there was a lady playing music on a piano, and it made me feel even sadder. Everyone seemed to know what to do except me. I just sat there, feeling lost and confused, wishing grandpa would wake up.  
  
After the service we all gathered at my Aunt Mary’s house and had a dinner where everyone shared stories of grandpa. They asked me to share a story and I tried to talk but then I started crying and I couldn’t stop. I know that crying like that is a sign of weakness.  
  
My mom took me into a bedroom and sat down with me, “We shouldn’t have had you talk about grandpa. I know this is hard on you.”  
  
I didn’t say anything. This felt like the speeches she would give me whenever I did something wrong, but I didn’t think I had done anything wrong, except for the crying… but she was crying harder than me in the bedroom.  
  
“We all loved him so much.” My mom said, hugging me.  
  
And then there was some shouting coming from the other room. My mom got up and went out to see what was happening and I followed her.  
  
In the living room, drunk, was Uncle Ernie. He was wearing hunter orange clothes since it was deer season in Michigan. “You all have blood on your hands!” Uncle Ernie screamed, pointing an accusing finger at everyone in the room.  
  
Several men gathered around Uncle Ernie and they escorted him into the bedroom where I was sitting with my mom a moment ago. I could hear their raised voices, but I couldn’t make out what they were saying.  
  
That’s when Aunt Mary came and grabbed me by the hand, “Let’s go outside and get some fresh air.”  
  
Aunt Mary was the youngest of my mom’s siblings and she didn’t have any kids, so I always thought she looked at me as a son. When I was young she used to live with us and my mom said I wasn’t sure who my mother was back then.  
  
“Don’t worry your Uncle Ernie is just venting.” Aunt Mary said. “He’ll be okay.”  
  
“Why did he say that?” I asked.  
  
Mary thought for a long time. “Well, sometimes when people die it’s hard for people to accept, so they blame other people to make sense of it.”  
  
A few minutes later Uncle Ernie came staggering out of the house and he walked up to us. “You could have saved him!” Uncle Ernie said. “You evil bitch!”  
  
Aunt Mary stepped in front of me, and said, “Not in front of Billy.”  
  
I think this was the first time Uncle Ernie realized I was there. He looked down at me with tears in his eyes. “At least you won’t remember any of this.”  
  
And then the men from inside were surrounding Uncle Ernie again and this time they escorted him to a car and drove away. I hoped I’d never see Uncle Ernie again, but the pit in my stomach told me that was probably wishful thinking.  
  
The next week things went back to normal. My mom was back to work at the factory and it was about this time I started to think about my dad. He’d died when I was two years old, and I figured he would have had some good advice.  
  
I decided to go out to the shed where grandpa kept his things. They hadn’t decided what to do with grandpa’s belongings yet. The door was locked, but I knew where grandpa kept the key, in the bird house hanging from the eavestrough.  
  
The shed was musty and it looked like grandpa hadn’t been in there for awhile. I rummaged through a few drawers and didn’t find anything particularly interesting. I thought about leaving and going next door and asking my friend Pat if he wanted to play basketball at the rec center.  
  
“What are you looking for?” a voice said from behind me.  
  
I turned around but there wasn’t anyone there. I walked outside of the shed and all around the back yard.  
  
And then the thought hit me that I might have heard the voice of a spirit. Or worse, I was losing my mind and hearing things. I wasn’t sure which was better.  
  
I thought about telling my mother, but I knew that she would tell me I just heard the leaves rustling. I stopped and listened and waited for the sound of leaves, hoping that my mind was playing tricks.  
  
But no leaves rustled, not even the sounds of any birds. It was dead silent.  
  
I looked up at the tree and laughed, it was the middle of winter and there were no leaves. I decided that I was hearing things. My mind was playing tricks on me. I had never heard a voice before so maybe it’s like growing hair on your chest, at some point you just start to hear things and need to see a doctor.  
  
“There are no such things as ghosts.” I said out loud to reassure myself.  
  
“What are you looking for?” the voice asked again from behind me, but much closer this time.  
  
I felt a mixture of fear and panic. There was a split second where I thought I wouldn’t be able to run, that I would be frozen in terror with the voice behind me closing in, but then I could feel myself running for the house and I didn’t look back to see what it was that was talking to me.  
  
“Mom!” I screamed as I flew through the back door. And then I remembered she was still at work, so I ran into the kitchen and grabbed a butcher knife off the cutting board and ran into the bathroom and locked the door.  
  
As I held the butcher knife, I wondered how I was going to use it on a spirit. And that’s when I decided to start praying. My mom had never taken me to church, but Rosie from across the street had told me about Jesus and how he loved little children. Rosie even taught me the song, “Jesus loves the little children.”  
  
I sat in the bathroom for what seemed like an eternity until my mom came home. She found me in the bathroom with the butcher knife. I was prepared for her to laugh when I told her the story, but she didn’t laugh.  
  
“Who was it?” she asked.  
  
This was not the response I was expecting from my mom. She was supposed to tell me it was all my imagination.  
  
“Do you believe in ghosts?” I asked my mom, finally putting the butcher knife on the sink basin.  
  
“Of course, not!” my mom answered.  
  
“Then why are you asking me who it was?”  
  
My mom thought for a long time. “I just didn’t want you to think you’re crazy.”  
  
I immediately thought back to what my Uncle Ernie said to Aunt Mary. Did my mom know something she wasn’t telling me?  
  
“I don’t know who it was.” I said.  
  
“Was it grandpa?” my mom asked.  
  
And that’s when I stopped talking and went to my room.  
  
As I sat on my bed, staring at the walls of my room, I started to wonder about my family. And then I wondered if the spirit was watching me. I got up and checked the closet and looked beneath my bed.  
  
I wished I had a dog to help guard the room, but my mom said I wasn’t old enough for the responsibility of a dog. The best defense I had was a few toy soldiers that I hadn’t played with in a couple of years.  
  
I placed one near the window, one in the closet, and one under the bed. I also said another prayer to Jesus in case the toy soldiers didn’t work.  
  
And then I thought about what the voice had asked me. I wasn’t looking for anything in particular. And then I started to wonder if maybe I should have been looking for something, but I had no idea what I was supposed to be looking for in the shed.  
  
“What am I supposed to be looking for?” I asked out loud.  
  
And then the lights in my room flickered on and off. And a few seconds later I was back in the bathroom downstairs holding the butcher knife.  
  
“Billy, come out.” my mom said, outside of the door.  
  
“No way, there is something in this house.” I said, trembling.  
  
My plan was to sleep in the bathroom but about an hour later my Aunt Mary showed up and started to talk to me through the door. “Billy, if you don’t think it’s safe here you can come and spend the night at my house.”  
  
That sounded like a pretty good idea, so I opened the door.  
  
“You don’t have to worry, the voices can’t hurt you.“ Aunt Mary said hugging me.  
  
This was the second response I wasn’t expecting. Why was she acting like the voices were real?  
  
“But they’re not real.” I said, confused.  
  
There was a long pause and then she smiled and said, “Of course they’re not.”  
  
I packed up enough clothes for a week and spent the next few days at my Aunt Mary’s. I didn’t hear any voices and things seemed to be going back to normal and about that time my mom showed up and said it was time for me to come home.  
  
I never wanted to step foot in our house again. I told my mom that I thought I would probably die if I came home. Her and my aunt Mary laughed when I suggested that my life was in danger.  
  
“We all heard voices when we were kids.” My mom said running her fingers through my hair.  
  
This is when I knew for sure I didn’t know my family. Nobody had ever said they heard voices as a kid. They had told me a hundred stories about their childhoods growing up but not a single one included voices.  
  
“You heard voices?” I asked, looking at my Aunt Mary who smiled and nodded.  
  
“Why didn’t you ever tell me this?” I asked.  
  
“Well, we hoped you wouldn’t hear them.” My mom answered. “But maybe grandpa’s death sparked something in you.”  
  
And that’s when I started to cry again just like at the funeral. I couldn’t stop. I cried until I was unable to cry anymore.  
  
Normally when I cry like that I feel better. But not this time.  
  
My mom took me home and I remember looking at the house as I got out of the car. The thought occurred to me that it couldn’t be the house since my mom didn’t grow up in that house.  
  
This thought made me want to cry again.  
  
“Mom, can we get a dog?” I asked through tears.  
  
And to my surprise my mom agreed, “Of course, we’ll go to the dog pound on Monday.”  
  
“What about me being too young?” I asked.  
  
“Well, you’re growing up fast.” She said smiling.  
  
Monday couldn’t arrive fast enough. The dog pound was filled with many breeds and sizes and my mom wanted a small dog that she said would be easier to house train. I wanted the biggest, meanest looking dog I could find. There was a black lab and German Shepherd mix named Thor that had been given to them a week earlier. They said the owners were too old to take care of him and that he was a gentle soul.  
  
He looked like a black wolf.  
  
Thor nuzzled up to me when they let him out of the cage. He was a gentle giant, but he looked ferocious. I tried to think of what a spirit might think when they first laid eyes on Thor. They wouldn’t know his backstory, so I thought Thor would be a perfect guard dog against spirits.  
  
After a half hour of debate my mom finally relented and let me bring Thor home provided I promised to feed him and take him for walks every day. What my mom didn’t know is the one thing I wanted to do more than anything was leave our house.  
  
I introduced Thor to the toy soldiers and instructed him not to eat them. I wasn’t sure if I should tell Thor about the spirit, but I did it anyway. Thor looked at me with a confused look.  
  
“You have to help us.” I said pointing to the toy soldier by the window. “You’re supposed to guard me with your… life.”  
  
I hesitated at the thought of Thor guarding me with his life. “Okay, if you’re too scared you can run, but wait until I’m gone before you run.”  
  
I realized that I was asking Thor to have more courage than me which didn’t seem fair since I was the reason he was in this situation. “Okay, we can run away together, but make sure you bark and growl.”  
  
For the next few months I worked with Thor teaching him how to fetch, but it looked like he already knew those tricks, but he didn’t like to let go of the stick. So, I guess I taught him how to release. I was careful to avoid the back yard. I half hoped that now that I had a dog I wouldn’t be hearing any voices.  
  
My mom acted as if nothing had happened. And it started to seem like a bad dream that I was having trouble remembering when the thought of going back into the shed with Thor crept into my mind.  
  
It was a terrible thought.  
  
“Why didn’t they get rid of grandpa’s belongings?” I asked Thor who perked up his ears.  
  
It had been months and nobody had been to visit except Aunt Mary to check on me. Before I heard the voice we had family visiting every week.  
  
“You’re not scared of that shed, are you?” I asked Thor.  
  
I didn’t think Thor was scared of anything. He even chased the neighbor’s cat up a tree. I was grounded for a couple of days for not keeping Thor on a leash.  
  
“You want to go to the shed, boy?” Thor barked, but he always barked when I raised my voice like that.  
  
I was too scared to go into the shed, but maybe if I let Thor go in ahead of me and look around I would be okay. That seemed like a good idea.  
  
“Tomorrow, you’ll go into the shed.” I said, wondering if Thor might be scared.  
  
“Unless you don’t want to?” I asked Thor, who sat in silence.  
  
The next day I introduced Thor to the backyard for the first time. He didn’t seem to notice anything. We played fetch for an hour. And then I started to throw the stick near the shed.  
  
My mom came out and checked on us and asked if I wanted to come in for lunch. I told her I had already eaten a sandwich, which was a white lie. I didn’t want to tell her I was trying to get up the courage to open the shed door again.  
  
I walked up to the shed door with Thor by my side, “Is anyone in there?”  
  
There was no answer, this time I could actually hear the wind rustling through the tree leaves. I felt a weight lift off my shoulders when nothing happened.  
  
“Maybe it was just my imagination?” I said.  
  
And that’s when the hair on Thor’s neck went up and he started to growl. And then Thor showed his teeth which I’d never seen him do before.  
  
I looked up at the birdhouse and wished I had the courage to take out the key, but I found myself running back to the house. I didn’t even check to see if Thor was behind me.  
  
When I reached the back door, I looked back and was surprised to see that Thor had not moved. He was still showing his teeth and looking at the shed door.  
  
“Come on Thor!” I said.  
  
Thor didn’t listen. He just kept staring at the shed door, growling and snarling.  
  
“What’s wrong?” My mom asked, from the kitchen.  
  
“Thor!” I yelled loudly, and this time he listened and came trotting up as if nothing had happened.  
  
“I’m just playing with Thor,” I said to my mom, trying to mask the fear in my voice.  
  
That night I laid in bed with Thor thinking about the shed, “You’re fearless.” I said to Thor who was fast asleep.  
  
I wondered if I would be fearless too if I had sharp teeth like Thor. And that is when I thought about the butcher knife again. Maybe if I had a weapon I would be fearless too? But then I remembered weapons wouldn’t work on spirits since they didn’t have bodies.  
  
And that’s when I realized I had missed the most important thing. The only weapon I needed was a cross. I was praying to Jesus almost every night and I wasn’t bringing Jesus with me.  
  
The next morning, I casually asked my mother if we had any crosses.  
  
“Are you hearing voices again?” my mom asked.  
  
“Nope, but I just thought it might help if I had a cross since I pray to Jesus.” I said.  
  
A look of concern washed over my mother’s face. “Billy, you know we don’t believe in Jesus in our family. You know that we don’t pray.” She said in a very serious tone.  
  
“What’s wrong with praying?” I asked.  
  
“Jesus, is not welcome in this house.” My mom said sternly and walked out of the room.  
  
I knew my family wasn’t particularly religious, but we did have grandpa’s funeral in a church. I then realized that it was the first time I had ever been in a church. If we didn’t believe in Jesus why were we having a church funeral?  
  
I tried to think back, and I didn’t remember seeing any crosses. And the guy in the black suit … was he a pastor?  
  
That afternoon I walked across the street to Rosie’s house. If Rosie was home, she was usually sitting on the front porch in her faded floral housecoat, silver hair pulled into a neat bun. She'd lived alone since her husband passed away a few years back. I brought Thor with me, knowing she always had dog treats handy for when her daughter visited with her dog.  
  
I asked Rosie if she stilled believed in Jesus.  
  
“Of course!” Rosie said smiling, feeding Thor a dog biscuit. “Why are you asking me that?”  
  
“Well, my mom said Jesus isn’t welcome in our home.” I answered.  
  
Rosie thought for a long time, “Well, not everyone believes in Jesus. My husband was an atheist and did not believe in God.”  
  
I thought about asking her why her husband didn’t believe in God, but I decided to focus on things that were more important.  
  
“Do you think I could get a cross from the Catholic Church?” I asked.  
  
Rosie smiled and reached down into her purse and pulled out a rosary. “Here, you can have my favorite rosary.”  
  
The beads were connected by a sturdy metal chain. At the center of the rosary was a small, intricately carved crucifix. The details of Jesus on the cross were so finely rendered I could make out the sorrowful expression on his face.  
  
“You might want to keep that a secret.” Rosie said, nodding toward our house.  
  
“Okay, thanks.” I said, and started back across the street but then turned back to Rosie, “Do you think this works on evil spirits?”  
  
Rosie looked confused at first and then she replied, “It works on everything if you have faith.”  
  
That night I lay awake with the rosary in my hands thinking about what Rosie had said to me. I needed faith. But I didn’t know what she was talking about. I knew I needed courage like Thor, but I wasn’t sure what having faith meant. It wasn’t exactly courage. It was something else.  
  
I said another prayer to Jesus and decided that tomorrow we would go into the shed. Thor would have courage and I would need to have faith.  
  
The next morning I woke up early. Thor didn’t appear the least bit nervous, but maybe that’s because he didn’t know what we were going to do.  
  
My mom cooked my favorite breakfast of scrambled eggs with Malt-O-Meal. She asked if Thor and I had any plans so I made up a story about teaching Thor to dig for treasures that he could smell. It was a half-truth because I had thought about teaching Thor how to smell gold and silver.  
  
It was Friday so my mom had to work. I half expected her to ask about the shed but she kissed me on the forehead and said goodbye like it was any other day.  
  
I looked out the back window at the shed and then down at Thor, “Are you sure this is a good idea?”  
  
I hoped that Thor would do something to tell me not to do it. He sat down and lifted a paw.  
  
“If you knew what we were about to do you wouldn’t be in such a good mood.” I said, pulling out my rosary and holding it in my hand.  
  
A moment later there was a loud knock on the door which caused me and Thor to jump. A moment later, Thor was barking and running toward the living room.  
  
“Anybody home?” I heard my Uncle Ernie yell, cupping his hands around his eyes to see inside.  
  
I opened the door and was prepared to ask him why he was here, but he walked right past me and sat on the living room couch. Thor sat beside him and he began to stroke Thor behind the ears.”  
  
“Billy, is your mom home?”  
  
“No.” I said. “She’s at work.”  
  
“Good.” Ernie said, looking around as if there might be someone watching him. “You’re the reason I’m here.”  
  
Uncle Ernie didn’t visit often and he’d never come to talk to me. “I’m sorry for the way I acted after the funeral. I wasn’t myself.” Ernie said.  
  
He looked at me as if searching for something. “What I said will make sense some day, but you’re too young to understand.”  
  
There it was again. He was talking about some kind of secret. I wanted to ask him some questions, but I was too afraid.  
  
“Before I get into the reason I’m here. I want to just say that your plan isn’t going to work.” Ernie said smiling, looking down at the dog.  
  
“You think this dog and that rosary your holding will save you?”  
  
I wanted to cry, but I just stood there in silence.  
  
“Yeah, they know about your plan.” Uncle Ernie said shaking his head. “You’re just like your dad. He had lots of plans too, and none of them worked.”  
  
Uncle Ernie had never mentioned my dad to me in my entire life.  
  
Uncle Ernie stood up, “This is confusing. It was confusing for me too, but you have a few more years before you have to decide.”  
  
I had no idea what he was talking about and I didn’t want to know. I wanted to run, but I wasn’t sure where to run to.  
  
“You’re too young to save yourself kid.” Ernie said. “But in a few years, when you’re 15 you can run away.”  
  
Could Uncle Ernie hear my thoughts?  
  
“When you’re 16, that’s when they’ll come for you.” Ernie’s voice started to crack as he continued, “That’s when they come for all of us.”  
  
He was going to say something else when the lights in the rooms started to flicker on and off. Thor began to growl and walked over to me, his eyes darting around the room as if something was moving.  
  
“Looks like they’re here…” Ernie said, looking up at the flickering lights. “I might have said too much.”  
  
I backed up against the wall, holding Thor by the collar.  
  
“I’m here to help you,” Uncle Ernie said, crouching down to a knee. “You have to trust me.”  
  
Uncle Ernie was the last person on Earth I would trust, but I nodded.  
  
“What are you looking for?” he asked, pausing as if listening to someone, “What’s in the shed?”  
  
I started to move away from him with my back against the wall, as the growls from Thor became deeper. “I- I don’t know-“  
  
“You have to tell me what you’re looking for!” Ernie demanded, leaning closer, and stopping when Thor began showing his teeth.  
  
Ernie smiled and lifted his head talking into the air, “He doesn’t know.” And then the laugh became diabolical, “He doesn’t even know!”  
  
And then Uncle Ernie walked toward the back door and motioned for me and Thor to follow him, “Let’s go into the shed and you can show me where grandpa kept his things and maybe that will help you find what you’re looking for.”  
  
I gripped the rosary in my hand and looked down at Thor and whispered, “We just need faith.”  
  
And then we followed Uncle Ernie to the shed.
