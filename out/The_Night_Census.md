Hey everyone, I know this is going to sound crazy but I need to know if anyone has ever experienced anything like this. I live in a small farmhouse that I inherited from my grandmother six weeks ago when she passed away. It sits on a lot of a couple acres of land. When she passed away I had just graduated from college, so instead of selling it I decided I’d live in it and maintain it while I looked for a job in the area. The nearest town is around thirty minutes away from me but I usually don’t mind the seclusion. In fact, my closest neighbor is around 10 minutes away as the crow flies. 

The first day that I got here I was over the moon about being the sole owner of my childhood home. The long dirt road to get you to the house was lined with dense forest and once I finally reached the house I realized that my grandmother had really let this place go. There were vines practically holding the shutters closed like the house was holding in a secret. I knew I was going to have a lot of work to do, but since I had a bit of savings I could focus on getting the house back in order. 

When I unlocked the front door and went inside I was met with an overpowering smell of lavender. It seemed that even though my grandmother let the outside of the house go, the inside was pristine. I set my luggage down and went into her bedroom. 

I spent the next week cleaning up the outside of the house. I found all kinds of things in the overgrown grass like an old farmer’s hat, gardening scissors, and coloring books that had been scribbled in. I hadn’t ever seen any of these items before but chalked it up to belonging to my cousins when they were kids. The first week of living there nothing else really went on. It’s this week, the second week, that strange things started happening.

After a long day of finishing the yardwork I came inside and kicked my boots off. I made sure to lock the front door and deadbolt it since living alone in the middle of the woods as a woman can get kind of scary. I made my way to the bathroom when I heard footsteps behind me. I whipped my head around but I didn’t see anything. I thought it was just the old house settling so I continued to the bathroom and got into the shower. Now, I don't know if it’s my mind playing tricks on me, but every time I dunked my head under the shower head I thought I heard giggling right behind me. Once again, nothing there. I got out of the shower, dried myself off, and slipped into my pajamas. That’s when I noticed something written in the steam on the mirror, “Hello :)”. I was genuinely freaked out at this point but knew that my younger family members had been here right after grandmother died, so I wrote it off that the writing was maybe lingering. 

That night as I was drifting off to sleep, I heard a loud knock at my door. I checked the time on my phone, 11:43 PM. Like I said, my nearest neighbor is 10 minutes away, so I had no clue what someone was doing here late at night. Before my dad passed away he instilled in me that the world is very dangerous, so the minute I turned 21 he paid for me to get a concealed carry license. I grabbed my pistol and tucked it into my waistband as I walked toward the front door. I could have just ignored it, but I didn’t know if maybe it was the police or someone in trouble. I opened the door a bit and saw a rather small man, I’m 5 '2 and he couldn’t have been much taller than me, in a button up polo with black slacks and those shiny shoes that the pastor always wore. 

“Hello!” He spoke up, “I’m Mr. Vister, I work for The Night Census!” He had the biggest smile on his face, almost like he had won the lottery. 

“The Night Census?” I said suspiciously, “I’ve never heard of that.” 

“Well, yes! We only knock on select doors. Think of it as a sort of government initiative for after-dark population tracking.” He ran his fingers through his gelled back, almost slimy black hair. “Who all is here? Has anyone been here since the last count?” Mr. Vister tried peeking around my shoulder but I quickly shut him down.

“I’m sorry sir, what do you mean since the last count?” 

“We come by a couple times a night to get the exact number of people living in the household. When I came by earlier I spoke to your gardener and he let me know that he lived here as well as his son,” he pulled a clipboard out from behind his back, “but he didn’t inform me that anyone else lived here. I’ll just write it down really quick.” I watched as he wrote ‘Young female in her late twenties, presumably alone’ under where he had already written ‘gardener and his young son.’ There was obviously no one else here, so I was extremely startled.

“I don’t have a gardener? I think you must have the wrong house, it’s just me here.” I didn’t notice my slip up until I said it.”I mean, my husband should be back any minute now. He had to run into town to get something” I tried to cover it up by lying but he saw right through it. His smile grew wider and he turned his head to the ground, still staring at me through his eyebrows.

“We know you’re here alone, Natalie.” He chuckled, but not in a friendly way. It sounded like a dry rattling coming from his throat. 

I slammed the door shut and locked it. I could still hear his laughter outside, which turned into a sea of screaming. I ran to the bedroom to call someone and had, of course, no signal. I couldn’t get to my car without him seeing me so I had no idea what to do. I barricaded myself in my room, but I accidentally drifted off to sleep. I woke up again to a knock at the door. I looked at my phone, 3:36 AM. I don’t know if this “Mr. Vister” guy is some kind of prankster, or lunatic. I wasn’t going to let him scare me. I opened up the door and didn’t let him get a word in.

“Stop fucking harassing me.” I spat, “I have a gun. I don’t know what you’re trying to do, but you’re trespassing. Go the fuck away.” His smile softened into a look of confusion. 

“I’m sorry for disturbing you, ma’am, but I don’t believe we’ve met.” His lips curled into a smile again and he held out his hand for me to shake. “I’m Mr. Vister! From The Night Census, we are-” 

I cut him off, “Yeah, I know who you are. You were just here?”

“Oh no, you must be mistaken. Me and my twin brother take turns checking houses.” I was obviously confused at this point, so he pulled out his clipboard. “So, you must be Natalie. I’ve got that you live in the bedroom towards the back of the house. Then the other occupants are the gardener, Silas, and his son, Thomas. I have here that they live in the bedroom that branches off of the family room.”

“No, I don’t know who Silas or Thomas are, but they definitely don’t live here.” 

“What? No, I see them right back there on the couch.” He stood on his tiptoes and waved to something behind me. As I turned around to see what he was waving at, Mr. Vister ran past me while giggling. I had no clue who this guy was, or why he wanted to be in my home, but I saw this as an opportunity to get out of there. I grabbed my keys from the bowl next to the door and ran to my car, leaving the front door wide open. I peeled out of there as quickly as possible to a small motel in town.

That’s where I am now. Do any of you know what’s going on? Has anyone experienced anything like this? Any help would be appreciated. Please help me.
