There was a 12-year-old girl who lived in the city with her parent. She was a happy little girl with many friends, but her best friend lived on a mountain far away from the city. Her name was Lily and her best friend was called Sarah. Lily´s grandparents lived near Sarah in the mountains, but they lived where the forest was denser. In the summer Lily used to spend a lot of time with her grandparents and Sarah, but in the last few years, she couldn´t go because of the financial problems her parents had

. This year she begged her parents to go to her grandparents so she could see them and Sarah, so her parents reluctantly agreed. They still couldn´t go in the summer, so they left the city on the first day of September. They left in the morning and arrived in the middle of the night. Because of the late hour, she couldn´t see Sarah, but she spent a few minutes with her grandparents before they went to sleep. The next day she told her parents and grandparents that she was going to see Sarah and hang out in the woods, her parents were ok with this as long as she stayed close to home, but her grandparents were a bit alarmed and told her to stay close and not to approach the fountain that was in the forest or the bells near it, and if she heard any screaming or if the forest went suddenly quiet to run home along with Sarah.

The girl thought her grandparents were overreacting but she assured them that everything was going to be ok. Lily took some water and food with her and went to see Sarah. When she finally arrived she saw Sarah and they hugged. The two best friends after a bit of talking and playing got bored and decided to go investigate the forest. While they started walking, they decided also to tell horror and urban stories. Lily told her best friend about the fountain, the bells around it, and everything that her grandparents told her. Sarah was a bit older, she was 15 years old, so she didn´t get scared that easily.

Sarah took all those stories as a dare, she wanted to dare Lily along with herself to go to the fountain and hang around it and ring those bells. At first, Lily was a bit scared seeing that she was a bit younger, but she also saw how Sarah was confident and that she wasn\`t scared at all and that eased her mind a little bit. The two girls went farther into the woods and finally arrived at the fountain. The fountain was old but still beautiful, the bells around her seemed new but gave an old vibe at the same time, the girls were fascinated. Tho the surroundings were beautiful, there was a chill creepy feeling in the air, but the girls ignored it thinking that they were only scared because of the stories and the fact that was their first time being there.

They went and looked into the fountain but they saw that it wasn\`t too deep or anything, so they thought it wasn\`t dangerous. Sarah thought it started to get boring so she thought it would be a great idea to scare Lily by ringing one of the bells. When she rang the bell it sounded very loud and for at least a minute it still could be heard from far away, Lily at first fell on the ground because of the shock and then started laughing along with Sarah. When the girls stopped laughing they realized that the whole forest went quiet, no birds or any creatures could be heard. They started feeling uneasy and kind of scared, but then all of a sudden a loud screaming was heard from far away.

When they heard the screaming they realized that danger was coming they\`re way, so day started running as fast as they could toward Lily\`s house. When they were halfway down the road to Lily\`s house they saw a dark figure behind a tree close by, the girls got scared and fell to the ground, but they did manage to get up and they eventually arrived at Lily\`s house. They were injured and out of energy and afraid, and when the grandparents saw them like that they knew what the two girls had done. The parents were panicking and were asking the grandparents what was going on.

The grandparents told them about a story of a bride who was drowned at that fountain on the day of her marriage by her jealous ex-boyfriend, they had bells around the house and at the door so they knew when one of them was leaving or entering the house, he left bells at the fountain so her soul was reminded of him every day. Whenever the bells rang because of the wind her soul would come out to take revenge on her killer. When the two girls rang the bell, the bride´s spirit woke up and started haunting them thinking it was her killer.

The grandparents tried to throw holy water on the two girls so the evil spirit would leave them alone. For a few hours, everything was quiet and everyone was relieved, thinking all the evil spirits were gone. In the middle of the night tho, Sarah heard crying sounds outside and Lily´s voice talking with someone, she thought her friend was outside crying so she got out of the house to look for Lily.

In the morning everyone was checking on Lily and Sarah if they were alright, but they only found Lily sleeping peacefully in her room, they searched for Sarah and called her parents to check if she had gone home, but her parents didn´t know anything and thought that she was still with Lily as they planned the day before for Sarah to sleep at Lily´s house for them to spend time together. The police were called for an investigation to start and for Sarah to be found, but nothing.

Lily found out about her friend and every night she tried to search for her everywhere in the forest, she missed one place tho...The Fountain. On her last night, out of desperation, she went to the fountain. She got close to the fountain and bit by bit she started seeing parts of Sarah´s clothes... she started freaking out but finally, she got to the fountain, there she saw a truly horrifying sight... Her best friend was hanging on two trees without clothes on, with her eyes rolled in her head and written on her ´´The bastard finally paid´´.

When she realized what had happened, out of desperation she started ringing all the rings around the fountain screaming ´´Take me too, you killed my best friend, kill me too´´ but for nothing... The spirit found her peace and she along with Sarah was gone. The girl told everyone what happened, but only a few who lived in the area believed her. The moral of the story is never mess with something that isn´t yours even if it´s abandoned, it has a story of its own and you have no place messing with it, or if you do, you will pay.
