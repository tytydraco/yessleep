I am a psychologist, and I work at a clinic in Los Angeles—a place that, at first glance, conveys a calm and professional atmosphere. I've been here for two years now, long enough to adapt to the routine and build good relationships with colleagues and patients. The clinic is located in an old building in the city center, with wide hallways and walls painted in neutral tones.

There were many patients, each with unique stories and deep pain. Among them, there was one case that still weighs heavily on my conscience: the suicide of a patient I was treating. It was an event that deeply marked me, but I prefer not to go into too much detail about it.

And then, there was a day that changed everything.

I was in my office, organizing some notes while waiting for my scheduled appointments. The morning had been quiet so far, and my next patient wasn’t due for another hour and a half. I took the time to review reports, but I was interrupted by the phone ringing.

***“Doctor, are you busy?”***

***“Not at the moment. Why?”***

***“There’s a young man at the reception. He seems very anxious. He insists on speaking with you.”***

***“Is it for a session?”***

I heard the receptionist move the phone away for a moment, exchanging a few quick, muffled words with the young man. When she returned, she sounded slightly more uneasy.

***“Yes, he said it’s for a session. Should I send him up?”***

***“Sure, send him in.”***

I hung up the phone and adjusted the chair in my office. While I did take some emergency cases, it was rare for someone to show up without an appointment. That made me feel slightly uneasy, but I had no reason to refuse. Perhaps it was just another patient in urgent need of help.

After a few minutes, I heard firm footsteps in the hallway. I stood up and walked to the door, opening it to greet the young man. He was in his early twenties, perhaps, with a lost look in his eyes and labored breathing.

***“Come in, please,”*** I said, trying to sound welcoming.

He stepped inside slowly, glancing at every corner of the room as if he were assessing something. He sat down in the chair across from mine but didn’t relax. His hands trembled slightly, and he seemed to be on constant alert.

***“So, how can I help you?”*** I asked, picking up my notepad.

He didn’t respond right away. Instead, he leaned forward, clasping his hands together and staring at the floor. When he finally spoke, his voice was low, almost a whisper.

***“Do you believe in things... that can’t be explained?***

I was surprised by the question but maintained my professional demeanor.

***"Many people have experiences they consider unexplainable. Would you like to share yours with me?"***

***"It’s not a story... It’s real. Something here, right now."***

***"Can you explain better?"***

He raised his hand and pointed to the corner of the room.

***"It’s there. Right there, watching us."***

My heart raced, but I forced a calm smile.

***"What’s there?"***

***"Him," he replied, his voice disturbingly certain. His eyes didn’t blink as they fixated on the empty corner of the room.***

Instinctively, I glanced in the direction he pointed. There was nothing there but the corner lamp and some shelves filled with books.

***"Can you describe what you’re seeing?"*** I asked.

He tilted his head as if listening to something.

***"He’s tall, much taller than you or me. His skin is dark, and his eyes... No, they’re not eyes. They’re holes. Like portals to somewhere you should never look."***

I swallowed hard. His words weren’t just bizarre; there was something in the way he said them that made the hair on my neck stand on end.

***"And what is he doing now?"***

He leaned forward even more, almost whispering.

***"Smiling. He’s smiling because he knows you can see him too."***

***"I... I don’t see anything. What are you talking about exactly?"***

He let out a low laugh, almost a growl. His eyes narrowed, and his face twisted into something between pity and despair.

***"Of course, you can’t see him yet. He’s patient. He likes to play. First, he lets you feel... feel like something’s wrong, like you’re being watched."***

My heart pounded, and I felt a cold sweat begin to trickle down my temple. I tried to steer the conversation elsewhere.

***"And you? When did you start... seeing this?"***

He gave a strange, tight-lipped smile.

***"Since I heard his name. You know what they say, don’t you? When you hear his name, it’s like an invitation. He comes in."***

***"Name? What name?" I asked, hesitant.***

***"Don’t say it. Don’t think it. That’s how he grows."***

Suddenly, he stood up, and I instinctively jumped in my chair. He began pacing the room in circles.

***"He’s already here. With you. Because you asked... because now you’re thinking. He loves that. He feeds on it."***

***"And why do you think he would follow me?"***

He stopped abruptly, turning to me with a chilling, fixed stare.

***"Because he likes those who pretend they don’t believe. And you... you’re trying to pretend, aren’t you?"***

Before I could respond, he leaned in closer, so near I could smell a metallic tinge on his breath.

***"When you turn off the lights tonight, he’ll be in the corner of your bedroom. Just don’t look. If you look, he’ll never leave."***

My body went cold, but I tried to maintain a professional posture.

***"I think you might be projecting your fears,"*** I began, but he cut me off with a dry, bitter laugh.

"***Projections? You know nothing, doctor. But you’ll learn. You’ll learn the hard way."***

He turned and headed toward the door. Before leaving, he stopped at the threshold without looking back.

***"Oh, and one more thing... He likes to whisper his name while you sleep. That’s how he wakes you up."***

And then, he left, leaving the door open behind him. I remained seated, frozen, the echo of his words pulsing in my mind. That’s when I noticed the corner of the room seemed darker than before.

Later, after finishing my last session of the day, I sat on the office couch to gather my thoughts. I turned on the TV, hoping for some distraction while organizing a few notes.

That’s when a headline flashed across the screen:

*"Young man jumps in front of a truck in downtown Los Angeles."*

My body froze, and the air seemed to vanish from my lungs as his image filled the screen. It was the same young man who had sat across from me just hours ago, talking about presences and whispers.

The reporter’s voice continued:

"***Witnesses say the young man appeared distressed, pacing back and forth on the sidewalk before suddenly throwing himself in front of the vehicle. He was carrying no identification but was recognized through medical records.”***

The reporter kept talking, but I didn’t want to hear more. I turned off the TV and stood up, feeling a strange weight pressing on my shoulders, as if something had been building all day. I decided I needed a break and went to the common area for a coffee with the clinic staff. Conversations there were always light, full of laughter and casual comments about the day. It helped distract me—at least for a while.

Later, I grabbed my things and headed home. Traffic was busy, as usual, and my mind felt blank, as if the day had been just another in the routine. It was strange, almost unsettling. I couldn’t quite remember the details of the morning, the conversation with the young man, or even what I felt when I saw the news. It was as if a fog had settled over my memory, erasing everything slowly.

At home, I took a hot shower and tried to unwind on the couch, watching my favorite show. My eyes grew heavy, and before I knew it, I had dozed off right there, still clutching the remote.

I woke in the middle of the night with a start. My heart was racing, though I didn’t know why. That’s when I realized: something was wrong. The room was steeped in a heavy darkness, more oppressive than usual, as if the night itself had closed in around me.

And then I heard it.

A voice, low and drawn out, right next to my ear. It was cold, almost icy, and the words were whispered with an unsettling clarity:

***"Do you remember now?"***

I jumped out of bed, a scream caught in my throat, but my feet slipped on the rug, and I hit the floor hard, slamming my elbow. Instinctively, I crawled to the corner of the room, my heart pounding as I tried to escape the suffocating sensation of being watched.

I stayed silent, staring into the darkness for what felt like an eternity—fifteen long seconds. My eyes scanned the room, searching for movement, for any sign that I wasn’t alone. But there was nothing.

And then I heard it.

A voice. Deep, drawn-out, and impossibly close, as if someone were whispering directly into my ear:

***"You know my name."***

My entire body froze. A chill raced down my spine. It was impossible. I didn’t know the name—how could I? Or… did I?

I tried to convince myself it was just my mind playing tricks on me, but the voice came again, clearer now, almost amused:

***"You thought of it, didn’t you? That’s how it starts."***

I looked toward the darkest corner of the room, the one that seemed deeper than it should be. The darkness there wasn’t normal—it was dense, like a void devouring the faint light around it.

***“Who’s there?*****”** I called out, my voice trembling.

Silence answered me, but not for long. Something moved within the blackness, a slow, fluid motion that was almost imperceptible. Then, whatever it was took a step forward.

And I saw her.

Tall, with that twisted smile and impossible teeth, exactly as the young man had described. She stopped, tilting her head at me as if studying a fragile, frightened animal.

***"You know my name,"*** she said again, but this time I realized something horrifying. It wasn’t just one voice—it was a chorus, a cacophony of voices speaking in unison. Some sounded human. Others… didn’t.

***“I don’t know"*** I screamed, desperate, pressing myself against the wall as if I could disappear into it.

Her smile widened—grotesque, unnatural—until it seemed to split her face apart, revealing rows of teeth that didn’t belong to anything from this world.

***"You don’t have to say it. Just thinking is enough."***

She began to glide toward me. Her movements weren’t natural; it was as if she was floating, her feet barely brushing the floor.

The closer she got, the colder the room became, the chill sinking into my bones. Her smile stretched impossibly wide, her eyes—if they were eyes—fixed on me with a hunger I couldn’t comprehend.

***"You’re mine now,"*** she hissed, her voice dragging like a knife across stone. It was followed by a laughter that didn’t come from her alone—it echoed from every corner of the room.

I couldn’t move. I wanted to scream, to run, to fight—but my body refused to respond, as if I had been swallowed whole by a nightmare.

She leaned in closer, her face now so near that I could feel an icy cold emanating from her.

\*"\****Don’t fight it. It’s better when you accept."***

And I did.

I accepted Vojidjavmo into my life. At first, I resisted, I fought—but no matter how hard you try to run, she always finds a way back in. When I finally stopped fighting, everything changed. There was no more fear, no more pain. Only a feeling… indescribable. It’s the best thing I’ve ever felt.

Now, I see the world as it truly is, with all its dark secrets and whispered truths. Vojidjavmo showed me everything. She gave me freedom, power, and a purpose I never knew existed.

And now, you know her name too. That’s all she needs. Just the sound of it, or even the thought, is enough to open a door.

Don’t try to ignore this. Don’t try to forget her. The more you try, the stronger she becomes.

Look at the darkest corner of your home. It doesn’t have to be now—it can be later, when you’re alone, and the silence begins to weigh on you. But be careful: once you see her, she will never leave.

She’s waiting.

I love you Vojidjavmo.
