Hi Reddit! I'm that guy who pulled a carbon copy of himself out of the Bag of Blessing, and I'm here to tell you what should have been obvious all along: anything called a "Bag of Blessing" was bound to destroy the world. 

I mean, nobody thought to ask the obvious question: where do the bag's contents actually come from? Shouldn't creating stuff out of "thin air" break several laws of physics? But in all the hot takes written about the bag, nobody was thinking in terms of physics.  

Instead, we were thinking about the legal issues, like who owns it? The bag was discovered by a hiker, half buried in the desert and filled with water bottles. The first time the public became aware of it was in a feel good story about how lucky she was to have stumbled upon so many water bottles in the desert after getting lost. But the next story in the press was about how she was making a fortune pulling random stuff out of the bag and selling it on eBay. That was when people realised that possessing the bag meant having unlimited resources for free, which was when the lawsuits started.  

Eventually, the government claimed the bag, arguing that a) as it was too advanced to have been made by humans, no human could claim it, and it should be deemed part of the desert landscape for legal purposes (i.e. government owned land) , and b) as it was buried in the desert, digging it out was a form of mining, which was illegal without a permit. The judge agreed, and the bag was handed over to the government’s National Parks Service.

Then, we started looking at it in terms of politics & economics. If there's a bag that can produce endless free stuff, who should control it and what should it make? Whose wishes should it fulfil? Some said we should destroy the bag, as any institution that controlled it would be too powerful and eventually impinge on our freedom. A million memes appeared about the world being destroyed by Ron Swanson asking the bag for “all the bacon and eggs you have”. Others said that it should be used to generate the basic needs of the entire population, as citizens had a right to a certain level of material needs. 

Then the CIA stepped in and argued that if we made copies of the bag, you could air-drop them into North Korea, so that new and competing power-bases would emerge that would challenge and overthrow the dictatorship there. That’s where I come in. I'm the physicist that was hired by the CIA to figure out how to copy it. That's why it was me that reached into the bag on my first day on the job. I still don't know why it was me, out of all the people that had used the bag before, to pull a carbon copy of himself out of the bag.

“Holy fuck!” I said. “You’re me!"  
“Yes”, said the other me. He looked distraught.  
“But this is fantastic!” I said. “Together, we’ll be able to figure out how this bag works in half the time! I can’t believe it, but you’re exactly what I need right now."  
“I already know how it works.” He said, looking even more distraught. “You would too, if you only thought about it through the right lens."  
“That’s what I’ve been saying!” I replied. “Okay. So where does all the stuff come from?"  
“That’s the wrong question” he said. “The correct question is when does all the stuff come from?"  
“Seriously? This is a time machine? Holy fuck!"  
“Yes,” he replied, “When you reach into the bag, you’re reaching into the future, and pulling stuff out from there. But like I said, you’re thinking about it through the wrong lens."  
I was momentarily stunned. “What lens should I be looking at it through?"  
“Why would a bag go to all the trouble of opening a wormhole in spacetime just to give some schmuck a bottle of water?"  
“Huh?"  
“What’s in it for the bag?"  
“Um. I don’t know what you mean."  
“Its biology! It’s reproducing itself! Everything anyone pulls out is covered in spores. Giving people what they want is its way of spreading copies of itself over the whole planet."  
“But … actually, that’s a good thing,” I mused. “This means that if we breed it right, everyone can have their own Bag of Blessing, and have all their wishes fulfilled."  
“Right, until the future."  
“Oh right. Until the future, where the bags are getting everything from. What happens, does stuff just randomly start disappearing?"    
“Worse. Think like a physicist for a moment. If you're a creature who can tear a hole in the space time continuum, what will you need?"   
"Well, a lot energy I suppose."   
"Right, and where will it get that from?"   
"Um ... I'm not sure. It's going to need a lot though."     
"Yes. It's going. To have. To feed."
