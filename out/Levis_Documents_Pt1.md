Hello, I wanted to come on here and get some thoughts on something I found. I would ask my wife but we've been separated for a little while now. Which is why I found this actually. I was looking about in our garage to take some things to my new place because my ex wife, that feels weird to say, is getting the house. I came upon our old family computer. A dinosaur I bought a few years before my wife got pregnant. I figured it'd have some old photos of us together with our son Levi that I could cry over with a bottle of whisky. Although I did find lots of photos and spent a considerable amount of time staring at my monitor through blurry tear filled eyes, that's not why I'm here. There's other forums for depressed old dads I'm sure. No, I found something, and I might say I could be overreacting or maybe a little drunk, but it's freaking me out. When looking through the files, again you'll have to forgive my lack of tech vocab, I'm in my late forties and had a hard enough time finding this forum, I found things that seem like they were purposefully hidden. it was a group of files where you click a folder that leads to another folder and so on until I found it. A final folder titled “Levi’s Documents”. In it were text documents, I haven't counted how many yet. I just finished reading the first one and am currently spiraling. I copied and pasted the first document below.

Levi was a silent boy. He never fussed as much as other babies. His parents were worriers. Chronic some might say. They took him to pediatricians regularly on account of his oddly calm and unresponsive at times behavior. He was always very loosely aware of things, observing. He had failed all of his stimuli tests. Not on account of non reacting but his reactions were always so uncaring that they were nearly impossible to measure. No laughing at images of puppies, kittens meowing, and sounds of babies crying produced no crying in return. Nothing. Blank staring at screens, looking around the room, and at his parents, no matter the noise or picture provided. But nothing seemed wrong, the doctors said, just not normal. The pediatricians all said he was a perfectly healthy boy, he just has some quirks. His parents were in and out of all kinds of doctors offices for months, being turned away from various places that had no specialty in the field, looking for something, absolutely anything to get their child to smile, laugh, or cry, anything. They would freak out over any kind of expression, dangling keys in Levi's face, making faces, funny noises. They loved him desperately so and so desperately wanted him to show them he was okay. So when one evening the child had made its way to the outdoor pool and fallen in, the household was a horror movie. Levi's mother screamed at the top of her lungs as she held in her hands a blue unmoving baby, water covering it. Levi's father ran from inside the house with a phone in hand yelling into it for an ambulance. A truly horrific sight for any parent, an unmoving child, on death's door, or possibly far past it. 


Levi's parents had told him that that was the worst night of their lives. When he got into trouble or made them worry, they never truly got upset at him. As other parents would let their rage loose regrettably and shout at their teen. No, they would approach him, hug him, and cry as they told them they were either disappointed or scared for his safety all while recounting the night he had scared his parents to death. He doesn't even remember that night, It was so many years ago. He always thought it was funny that they told him to never do it again. He was a child, a baby. They had acted as if he meant to scare them or had any real choice in the matter. He always chalked it up to their helicopter parenting. Both parents being so loving and present, suffocating at times. But he never complained. He knew that he was their only child and that they wanted so badly to have one. His father told him of how hard they had tried for one and for years with no luck, but he always felt uncomfortable when he said that because no one wants to be reminded of their parents “trying” for a child. 


But despite the constant presence of his parents he never truly got tired of it, it was comforting. Oftentimes his father would enter his room unannounced and sit down with him. Just being there. They didn't have to say anything, they could sit there in silence for hours, existing with one another. He liked that about his father, that he could be satisfied just being in the room with him. Sometimes he would play some music, as they lay there staring up at the ceiling on his bed, listening to the same songs over and over for hours. After a while his father would say I love you and leave, and Levi was left feeling warm and seen. This tradition with his father existed as long as he could remember. It's always been that way with his father. His comforting presence, sparing soft words, encouraging him to pull through.


Over the years Levi had to make steps into independence all at the horror of his parents. Saying he wished to go to places with his friends unattended by chaperone, or birthday parties which could mean anything to a worrying parent. But the year Levi told them he wanted to take a girl on a date his mother just about perished. Her face drew still and she began bawling on the spot, as his father hugged and comforted her. His dad had to convince her that the boy was at the age where he was going to start thinking about those things. He had thinking about it for years at this point, but he knew his mother would unravel at the thought of her baby boy wanting to pursue a girl. He never understood this notion, that a mother would feel sad about her boy wanting a girl. I mean perhaps it means he'd seek comfort and affection from her rather than his mother but it's a different kind of affection really, especially for a teenage boy. It's rarely about a comforting or sympathetic affection. Levi thought girls were hot and he wanted to kiss one, that was about it really. When his father had spoken in private with his mother they emerged from their room with a verdict. He was allowed to go. His father told him in depth how to treat a lady, holding doors, walking her to her house, and being gentlemanly and what not. Levi already planned on all those things, giving him yes sirs and nods. His mother didn't say anything. Just that he was growing up to be such a handsome young man. 


“You'll grow up to be such a dashing man.” She said.


It turned out that this wasn't just some teenage crush, at least it didn't stay that way. It was a year now of going steady with Levi and his girlfriend. They had gone on dates a few times a week. After school they'd meet up to “study” a vague explanation as to why they were absent form their respective homes for hours at a time. They'd go to a park nearby the house, one that had been described to Levi by his parents. The place his father proposed to his mother. A lovely little place with a pagoda, vines entangling it surrounded by a heavily wooded park, one could get lost in, exactly as his parents described it. Perfect for a secluded place to makeout. He felt weird at first filling his parents place with his teen passions, but he got over it relatively quickly. He spent a lot of his time there with his girlfriend as the months progressed. They didn't have much in common. To be honest, they never really got to know each other. Now that Levi was thinking about it, his face currently being vacuumed, he didn't know the slightest thing about this girl. I mean she was very pretty, like the definition of pretty. Even his own personalized definition of pretty, but He didn't know anything about what was in her head. She never asked him about himself either. They were strangers.


“Wake up Levi '' He refocuses his vision now looking at her. He had been lost in thought, to the point where he didn't realize they had stopped kissing


“I'm sorry I was-, sorry” They continued. He was pretty sure he loved her. It was a weird feeling though. Like he loved the idea of her, not her as herself. How could he, he didn't know her, not really. It was like he was feeling love, or being taught it for the first time. Or maybe it's his idea of love he was feeling. That there should be some feeling deep down but he was only reading it like a book, or looking at the idea and exclaiming that that was what he was feeling. He stopped thinking about it. It was his first girlfriend, it's bound to be foreign to him. He's never had one before.


He had taken a liking to this introspection. Or had a preoccupation with it rather. He never felt quite right in his relationships with anyone. As if he was present but wasnt supposed to be. He tried to soothe his parents' minds by pretending as if he wasn't dying to be silent, still, and unreacting. But they tried so desperately to get him to engage so he obliged to make them happy. But it never seemed like enough for them. Soon he had perfected his persona, now not knowing if he was some person he had made up or not anymore. If maybe he was lying, for so long.


He was graduating soon, now two years with his girlfriend, still having no idea who she was. Every so often she'd talk about her family, how they'd love to meet him, even going as far as to call hers his family. She clearly saw something long term. She did gradually reveal little things about herself, experiences, 


“We have a puppy at home, his name is Temmie. He'd love to meet you” Although Levi loved when she’d say things like that, or anything that wasn't vague I love yous, and you're so special to me, they always came out of the blue. Sitting in silence, which he was more than content to do, to be there with someone, and a thought would penetrate the air as if she hadn't said it herself. He never knew how to respond to them. Choosing rather to give an affirming grunt or half smile. But he loved her all the same. He was confident now after two years to say it, he did love her. 


His mother and father were heartbroken at his departure to college, his mother yelling, 


“Don't leave me Levi” His father had to hold her back from grabbing him and keeping him from leaving the door. Them both crying as he left. It was night time. The door was unilluminated as it usually was by the porch light. He felt scared. Was this how everyone felt moving out? No. No no no, this isn't right. Levi was terrified. Now drifting, pulled he's being pulled to the door, the black abyss behind it that held their front lawn but yesterday. What is this he thought, what's happening. His heart now pounding, faint beeps behind them. He looks to his father and mother now standing above him in his bed, not his bed. Them now towering over him as his heart pounds, their tears falling to the ground. He looks behind him and again he's even closer to the door, dark and cold water behind it like a wall. Reaching its frigid tendrils out grabbing him, entwining him and his face and plunging into his nose, and down his throat. He looks back at his parents, them sobbing as they look away from him, flinching at each beep drawing closer to its consequetor. 


Seeing his face now, looking at his own face entwined with tubes and wires, going to various parts of his body now encased in glass. His mother looks at him again, the beeps growing rapid, and bursts free from his fathers arms and begins pounding on the glass, screaming at the top of her lungs “WAKE UP LEVI!” over and over and over. Staring at her from behind a wall, his threshold now in front of him and his mother behind it. The water rippling and splashing as its surface is pounded upon by his mother now falling apart, eyes filled and pouring tears. He doesn't want to go. Looking at his mother, her love, her passion for him. His father standing feet behind her covering his mouth, tears streaming down his face and hands, snot covering them. He's cold, so cold. He doesn't want to go. He wants to stay with them, They love him. He loves them. But it's so cold. He tries to swim towards them, the surface, but his limbs are shot of energy, frigid and stiff. He can't, he can't go back to them. He begins to sink, the threshold and its watery barrier growing smaller. He has to go, He cant stay. 


“I'm sorry” he says, “I love you mom, I love you dad”. He closes his eyes as his chest stills, the cold water forcing his limbs unmoving, and drifts.


A splash, he crests his eyes open. A blurry figure swims towards him, his mother drawing closer, she reaches out her hand but he cant reach for it. She gets closer, finally grabbing hold of him. She shakes him violently over and over and over. Crying, screaming, yelling at him.


“WAKE UP! WAKE UP!” He sees her being pried off of him by doctors and his father, a solid beep filling the air. She doesn't relent, having thrown the glass off. Her hands around him shaking forcefully. Until finally his eyes open, and stillness. His eyes scanning the room, doctors looking down at him in shock. His mother lets go of him and covers her mouth as his father holds her. In shock, all the people in the room stare down at him silently. Levi reaches his hand out to them, and looks at it. Small, infantile. He tries to speak. Im okay mom, he tries to say, and all that leaves his mouth are coos. His parents begin bawling, as the doctors hurry around grabbing various things and maneuvering him. He tries to speak again, Dad, what's going on?  Loud cries come from his throat. He tries again, cries, loud and now screeching cries. He tries to tell them what had happened, what he had seen and lived through, and his voice only produces an ear piercing sound.


(-End of document)


This was the first document I found in the folder. I'm freaking out. I don't know if my ex wife decided to use our son's drowning and coma as some inspiration for one of her books or what. He was only ten months old when it happened and we never talked about it after because of how terrifying it was. So to think that she’d write some twisted fantasy version of it just doesn’t sit right with me. She wouldn't have. I'm going to come back to this when I'm sober, reread it and maybe the next one too. Might be deleting this post if sober me figures out what this is and gets embarrassed. I don't know how to check the file for the original date it was made. But if the date it's labeled with is when it was written, this was only months after Levi woke up.
