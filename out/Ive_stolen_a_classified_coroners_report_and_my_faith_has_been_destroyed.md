Just over a month or so ago, there was a post made here that pertains to a certain young man and his girlfriend. The lovers’ unfortunate situation has been relatively ambiguous, until now.

For context, this is a follow up to [THIS POST](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/17wb4ye/i_think_i_accidently_melted_into_my_girlfriend/)

I need manage expectations before I start. I am not Shaun, nor do I plan to make my identity known- as I’m sure my superiors will find out quickly. In fact, I’m surprised I haven't heard a knock on my door already. I have ongoing employment with a particular  international conglomerate of particular companies and government powers. I work with a particular team of investigators that only work particular cases, if you know what I mean. Maybe peculiar cases would be better phrasing for my line here.

If you can guess, of course I’m speaking of crime scenes that will go unseen by the public eye. The cases that only cross the eyes of my fellow investigators, our employers, and a select few oligarchs from around the world that are bold enough to buy into my employers inventory of strange, horrible discoveries.

When my eyes first came across Shaun's telling of events, I was very surprised as I had just retired from the aftermath of that very scene upon viewing it for the first time. A month went by, and in that month I’ve come to discover many things about myself and I have felt compelled to come clean with the full picture here.

If I tell this story from my own perspective, I will be singled out when this goes live.

Again, managing expectations- that would have me killed faster than I’m already most likely going to be offed for spilling the beans here.

Instead, I’m throwing myself through the whistle by leaking and transcribing the closest damn thing I have to a coroners report. The risk of nabbing the documents I did was enough to get me killed alone, so I hope that I’m at least informing- or warning some of you readers.

Clean.

Your.

Room.

**Time:** 1:14AM	**Location on body:** Ear canal- Common house flies.

**Time:** 1:17AM	**Location on body:** Underneath a large sac of flesh- Common house flies.

## Wounds, etc-

**Head:** Decadents head is fused at the base with its neck. Otherwise the right side of the face has fused into the back of his partner (Sara)- both eyes are visible although the right eye is no longer apart of decadents face. Right eye has seemingly traveled down his partners back. Long, strung out strips of flesh hang where decadents lips would normally be. Blood stains the end of them, most likely the result of a struggle.

**Chest:** Can not clearly distinguish decadents chest from his partners. Both are melded together- a few cracked ribs are seen poking out of the left side of the area, as well as the remnants of the female victims hand around where the collarbone region is. Only a few odd fingers stick out- the rest of the arm-bone and hand has fused into the “chest”.

**Back:** Upon further research, facial features of the decedents partner can be found on the underside. Removing the cadaver from the bed-frame required surgical accomplishment, allowing us to view the subject fully. The underside of this creature seems to have been consuming garbage from inside the apartment, upon trying to remove the heap of trash and sludge the anomaly was consuming- operatives ended up harming the cadaver.

**Buttock/ Pelvis Region:** No such area was found, although an autopsy may be 											able to coo-ordinate location of this region.

**Hands:** Three out of four hands have been assimilated into the decadent. One hand is not fully consumed, and one hand is free- grasping a nearby (dead) laptop.

**Feet:** No feet visible from any perspective.

… That's about all that's shockingly interesting from the initial report.

About four days now I’ve been combing over these moments in my memory- and all but confirming them in these documents. In this time I haven’t shown up to work at all. I’ve been ordering takeout and watching TV all night, perhaps a fear response for the stunt I had pulled at my workplace. Like I’m scared still, too afraid to move out of the comfort beam of the TV light. The past four days; I *remember.* I remember, and **remember-** and remember. I can’t stop *“Remembering”*. I remembered so much about that scene, in fact I’d like to share it all. After this transcription, my perspective has changed on this whole whistle blowing thing.

I am here to tell you now, what I saw that night in November was **unknowable.** I entered the room the 4th out of my squad. Around 5 feet from the doorway, I had marched through the dark. Eventually my footsteps began speaking with a squishy and wet tone. All I had seen was dust wavering in the moonshine when the light was promptly flipped on. I could blink the rest of that night away. *I could wish the rest of that night away.*

As I make my way through this little stack of paper here I’m noticing more and more consistencies I can piece together with my own memory. I’ll keep this updated to what I may find. This extended break from work serves me nothing but my own peace of mind- that or something is influencing me into this, as if.

I believe the next document I leak will be the autopsy report. There's more than just that kind of information among the papers as well. Information I need to read into. In the meantime, I’m going to try and clean this place up a little bit. Ill be honest, I’ve let myself go a little bit over the past few days. With all the work ahead of me- and with the fear of god in my heart- all I can think is
