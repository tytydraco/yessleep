Hi Guys, I am written a story. I have written this story as I am victim of the story.

I am 19 years old. I am little bit shy as well as introvert person from childhood. This incident happened around the final examination of grade 11. I am going to tell you about my paranormal experience. On May 13 2021, All of the family [ In my family, we are two sons ( one big brother and I am smallest one ) and one daughter( middle one ), and mother and father. We have five members. ] member expect me are going to marriage ceremony of maternal uncle’s second son. 

I can’t go due to my exam. I tell my parent that I want to go but they scolded and didn’t allow me to go. They told that exam is running then why should you come together with us. I agreed with my father other wise he would be angry at me. My exam time is around 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM. They have gone to marriage ceremony about 01:30 PM. And they told me that they will come late, so cook yourself or go to uncle’s house to eat. 

My uncle is very helpful kind of person. He hasn’t gone because he has leg pain. He always helps our parent in need. Tomorrow is the exam of Accounting. And I have started practicing from morning and I feel tired and when I look at the time, it was 11:00 AM  and I go to kitchen to cook. While cooking, my inner feelings is saying something would happen wrong.

I thought it was due my exam pressure. I forgot it and start to work. It takes around one hour to finish my work i.e eating, cooking, washing utensils. I have gone to my room and take a rest. While taking rest, a bad smell start to came. I thought it was gases from cylinder. It wasn’t that. After a while, i stop smelling that. I start to study. It around the time of 02:30 PM, I usually take lunch. And I again start to study. My eye suddenly starts to feel numb and suddenly I start to cry. 

I thought something has entered to my eyes but there was nothing. I washed my face and started to study. After a long time, when I checked the time, it was around 05:30 PM. So I have gone to kitchen for washing the rice.  While washing the rice, I had listen that someone has whisper my name twice. The whispers sound is adult person’s voice. And I go outside the room and look around but I didn’t find anyone and start washing the rice. But I listen that someone has whisper my name in angry tone. 

Again I look around and didn’t see anyone and go outside and look but I didn’t find anyone. I thought that it was my imagination and I start to cut the vegetables, I feel the presence of someone. And make everything to eat. Now the time is around 06:00 or 06:20 PM. So I go to outside to relax for some time ( watched YouTube videos and gone for walk ) . After a long time, I came back to my room and the time was around 07:00 PM or 7:30 PM. 

While I wash my legs and hands,I thought someone just touch my back but there was no one. When I go to my room then there is no one. I start to feel little scared. Then I eat and wash the plates which I have eaten. I have gone to lock the main gate and doors. And I have to my room and it is around 7:50 PM. I start to watch some YouTube videos and movie. After a while, when I realised that the time is 09:50 PM, then I start to study from 09:50 PM to 10:30 PM. Then my friend messaged me “ how much did you studied” and replied “ not that much ” and after messaging and talking with friends, I makes my bed and put the account book and copies to the original place with playing song in the background and gone to sleep. After a few minutes, somebody knocked my door because I have a habit of sleeping after closing the door of room. 

When I open door and there is nobody. I think it is my imagination or an pressure from a exam but it happens twice and whenever I look out and check but there is no one. And  then I start freaking out. When I closed door in intense and go outside of my room to check everywhere but there is no one. Then while coming back I feel that someone is following me and when I look back there is nothing. Wherever I stand, I feel that someone is standing behind me but whenever I turn back there is no one. Then i return to my room and closed the door. I sat on the bed and start to think what was happening and I suddenly saw a dark entity ( a person type entity ) at the corner of the room. When I go closer to see what was that . While going there weird things happen to start like heart beats becoming faster, sweating and other side I also think that it can be my imagination.

That dark entity turn back and throw me back to the corner of another side in full forced. The face of that dark entity is totally pitched black. The dark entity came near to me and started to choke me. And suddenly I woke up at 11:30 PM with heavy breathing and sweating. I drink water which is at study table and start to clam down myself that it would be my bad dream. After a few minutes, I listen the knocking sound and start to think that it would be my imagination or real. The knocking sound is increasing louder and louder. 

Then I start to listen a weird sound which have listen in the kitchen room before. So I plan to run towards my uncle’s house. I told everything to my uncle that was happened to me. Uncle give me some glass of water and claims me down. He told me that for today,  sleep on house because your family members isn’t coming today and Will tomorrow and your father just called me and told me that just before you came. 

Tomorrow morning, I have gone to my house and told everything about last night experience. On daily basis, I have started to listen weird stuff. One day I told my parent about listening some weird kind of stuff. Then my mother called priest and do some puja. After a while, I started to fresh.
