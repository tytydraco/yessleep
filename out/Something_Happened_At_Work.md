I want to start by saying this is my literal first post. So, I don't know how Reddit works or if I'm breaking any rules... I just wanted to tell this story... I’m typing this on my phone during my lunch period. I don’t have time to edit properly. It just happened today and while it wasn't the first scary encounter I've had here it was definitely the scariest.

I work at a school. We're an early school so we're expected to be here at 6:45 and class starts at 7:15. I’m usually here around 6:30 and at the end of after-school activities, I leave around 6:30 somedays 7. When I was just interning here the teacher I worked with and I would stay until about 8. 

Anyways, I had a bit of free time before I got my students for the day and ended up dozing off in a chair at my desk, I wasn't asleep for more than 5 minutes. I knew that I was asleep and also felt alert. During those 5 minutes, I started to hear voices. Voices that were whispering. I couldn't make out everything that they were saying but they started to sound agitated. The last thing that was whispered is what I heard clearly. "You ready?" One voice asked. It was quiet for a moment and I began trying to wake myself up. Honestly, at this point, I thought it was some of my coworkers. I felt as though someone was stepping around my feet (for reference I was sitting sideways with my arm on the desk propping up my head resting on my hand) they were stepping around my feet to get to the side of me. I felt a hand on my neck and started to panic and desperately try to move. After what seemed like 10 minutes I was finally able to wake up with a weird lump on my neck which is now sore. My brother encouraged me to post this here. I guess it was sleep paralysis...

 Like I said before this wasn't the first paranormal event that's occurred at this school. I have more stories including my 1st grader telling me a tall man with a hat followed her from her old classroom closet. She even drew a picture of it, I would include it but I don't know how to upload images. On more than one occasion I was locked in a classroom and locked in a bathroom, I stayed late working on a few things and I heard strange noises, things move and fall by themselves, things have flown off shelves, children were locked in rooms, birds somehow find their way in, we found two large birds dead inside of a recycling bin with the lid on it in a locked closet, I saw a person walk past the bathroom when almost no one was present but none of the shoes matched to any person that was there, odd occurrences in the woods behind the school. 

More than I didn’t mention here. I’m sorry if this sounds like I’m rambling. I’m still confused and very much shaken up.
