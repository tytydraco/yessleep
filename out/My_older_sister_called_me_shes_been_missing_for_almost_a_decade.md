My older sister, Jenny, was the golden child. She was beautiful, popular, and had good grades. As I grew older, I began to accept that she was always going to be better than me, that didn’t change how jelous I became. Even though I was cold to her, she always greeted me with a warm smile each time she saw me. By the time she was 25 she had already married and had two wonderful children. At Thanksgiving, everyones eyes were on her, never me. 

We lived in a small town, everyone knew eachother, that’s when it came to us as a suprise when we learned that Jenny went missing without a trace. The family was grieving, her old house became a memorial site. After years of looking, everyone gave up. I missed her sweet smile, and her strawberry blonde hair, I even missed all the jelousy I felt when everyone would praise her every Christmas.

Just a year ago I was watching one of her favorite shows as my dog, Penny, sat next to me when I heard my phone ring. “An unknown number?” I thought out loud, then held the phone to my ear. “Jane, Jane? Hello! Please help me!” The voice pleaded. “You aren’t my sister.” I replied, shocked. I hung up in fear, That was not Jenny. I almost completely forgot about the strange occurrence when a few days later I got a call from the same number while I was preparing soup. “Jane! I’ve missed you, come help me!” The voice cried. “How did you get my number!? Leave me alone!” I demanded, hanging up. I sat on my couch, tears running down my cheeks. That was not my beloved sister. 

About a week after I left a bouquet of colorful flowers at Jenny’s memorial site, it only took a few minutes before my phone began ringing. “What do you want!? Quit calling me!” I boomed. “Jane, I’m inside, come help me.” The voice was more clear. I hung up in pure fear and confusion and ran to my car. That wasn’t my sister, I killed her almost a decade ago.

I don’t know what came over me when I did it. I had mixed emotions as I drove home. Suddenly I heard my phone ring, it was the same stupid number. “What could you possibly want now!? I already know you aren’t my sister, ok!? Leave me alone!” I screamed. “Come inside.” The voice said calmly. I hung up quickly, rushing into my house. I opened the front door using my key. In front of me stood Jenny, her hair was tangled and raggedy, her white sundress was stained by dirt and mud, her teeth were rotten and gross, and worst of all she had to most evil look on her face. “Jenny..?” I mumbed. “I get it, you were jelous, but was no need to hurt ne, much less MURDER  me.” She stepped closer, backing me into the wall behind me. “I treated you good, I had a husband and kids, that I had to leave behind because of your bitterness.” I fell to the cold carpet floor. “I’m sorry, it was wrong but-“ I never got to finish, it was too late. Jenny began chasing me throughout the house. I ran as fast as I possibly could at the time until I reached a dead end. “It’s my turn, Jane.” Jenny hissed, then reaching to possibly strangle me, when all of a sudden she froze.

My dobermann stood behind her, blood dripping on the floor, staining the carpet. Jenny fell onto me as my blood covered dog barked furiously. “Good girl.” I told her, gasping for air. I decided right then and there I was going to move far away, and take Penny with me. I’m now living across the country, and if anyone is wondering, yes, Penny is alive and doing very well.
