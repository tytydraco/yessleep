In the spring of 2016, I had too much free time. I was 16. I was a lonely and introverted teenager with some complexes, so naturally, I spent a lot of time playing computer games.

So I joined a small Minecraft server. I liked the unique community, I liked the custom server plugins, and I liked the administration's approach to server management.

When applications for server moderation team opened in mid-summer 2016, I submitted my application. Even though I was a relatively new member of the server, my application was accepted, I was given a fancy red prefix, access to special commands, and I officially became a member of the server staff.

In a position of strength, my complexes began to manifest themselves. I started acting like an arrogant jerk.

It was around this time that I met J. She was a very creative server player, and without a second thought, I complimented her building abilities.

This turned out to be a mistake on my part; a little of my attention was enough for J to become obsessed with me and want even more. She did everything to get my attention: she threatened me with suicide, sent me gory photos, and drew disgusting drawings. This scared me a little. She was only 13; she had obvious problems with self-harm, and I had no idea what to do with her attention as I was worried about her mental and physical health.

On the evening of one autumn day in 2016, when I logged into the game after school and, as always, was busy satisfying my complexes by punishing some poor kids for doing kid stuff, a player with the nickname Z joined the server.

Almost immediately after he joined, an extremely ambiguous message was written on the server on my behalf in the general chat.

When I tried to ban Z, my prefix just turned toxic green.

I panicked and wrote to one of the server owners about what was happening and received an unexpected answer...

Z is a senior member of the staff and part of the development team.

It is worth noting that I was never personally introduced to all members of the staff; I was just added to the private server. That's the reason why I didn't know who Z was.

Although the problem was resolved, in my eyes, Z humiliated me in front of the entire server. I was angry, and I wanted to repay him in one way or another. It sounds funny now, but I was 16. At the time, it seemed like a matter of honor to me.

So from that very day on, Z and I developed a kind of comic feud. When we were both online, we joked and messed with each other.

Over time, we began to sometimes chat outside the game. Z was quite good at IT, and at that time I was thinking about a career in that field. so I sometimes consulted him on the topic.

In January 2017, something happened among the senior staff. I never found out what, but as part of this, Z and several other senior administrators resigned. The server could not withstand such a crisis and closed down two months later.

My interest in Minecraft was starting to wane a bit at that time, so I just shrugged and went back to the games I was playing before. But my connection with Z remained, and J continued to stalk my online accounts.

 

Somewhere in March 2017, I started playing another voxel game on the RP server. This was my first RP experience, and it just blew my mind.

RP allowed me to be anyone, and of course (now I’m even embarrassed to write this), I started playing as a lonely, serious, and rich government employee.

About a month later, Z found out about my RP alter ego.

*Me: damn Z, I’m playing this RP game, and presidential elections are going on right now, and I’m supporting one of the candidates and*

*Z: And he turned out to be a Nazi?*

*Me: NO!!! It’s just that there are two candidates, and the one I support is not the one who is going to win! What if they take revenge on me now?*

*Z: And what will they do to you :-/?*

*Me: EXACTLY! I HAVE NO CLUE, AND I'M SCAAAAAAARED!*

*Z: Why are you playing then if you're scared?*

*Me: I like it!*

*Z: That sounds interesting; what exactly are you playing? :-)*

and Z came in. and Z liked it.

We started chatting much more. I was lonely and didn't have many friends. That's why I became attached to Z and our chats with him. I often sat up until the early hours of the morning, just chatting with him about all sorts of stuff.

Z was two years older than me, had answers to all the questions, spoke four languages, was a troll, and had a strange, charming style of communication. One moment he would talk like your wise older sibling, and the next he would act like a stupid, naive little one.

*Z: You have a new car!*

*Me: Yeah, it's a little buggy, but they promised to fix it in the next bugfix.*

*Z: Why blue?*

*Me: I like blue*

*Z: But why not green?*

*Me: Because I like blue!*

*Z: But I like green :-(*

*Me: Well, paint yours green!*

*Z: I want yours!*

*Me: Nope, my car.*

*Z: meanie:\_-(*

He also had the habit of taking the conversation to unexpected places.

*Z: Hey, what do you think about immortality?*

*Me: IDK*

*Z: Hey, don’t be like that! I’m sure you’ve thought about this at least once :-/*

*Me: To be honest, I’m too lazy to think about immortality at 4 am haha*

*Z: lazy ass :-(*

*Me: What do you mean by immortality anyway? Like, how does it work?*

*Z: any theoretical immortality! Do you think this is good or bad?*

*Me: um... I'm not sure. Bad,  I think.*

*Z: Don't you want to live forever? :-)-:?*

*Me: I'm just not sure that immortality for all people is a good idea. Some might go crazy or smth, IDK*

*Z: How sweet! You care about other people!*

*Me: THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN!!*

Somewhere in July, I developed an addiction to opening cases in a very well-known online shooter. I spent most of the money that I earned on them.

I knew that Z had a lot of money; Z never hid that he worked in a lucrative position at a construction company. This led to one of the most humiliating moments of my life.

*Me: Hey Z, can you lend me 100usd, please?*

*Me: please?*

*Z: For what? :-/*

*Me: cases. I'll return it in a week, I promise!*

*Z: Nah, try to rob your parents :-)-: I'm sure this would make a cool news headline.*

By the beginning of June, I decided to sell some virtual game items for an approximate amount of 700 USD and spend it on my addiction. I found a buyer and asked Z to help me with the process. but everything didn't go according to plan. Z lied to me, transferred the items to his own account, and then... permanently banned his own account.

This was the first time I saw this side of Z. I sat helplessly and felt that, through the monitor, Z was glad that he could hurt me, glad that he was able to humiliate me.

I blocked Z on all platforms and decided not to contact him anymore.

 

I haven't talked to Z for two months. Honestly, I don’t remember what excuses I came up with, but I unblocked his accounts and wrote to him myself. I was lonely; I had no friends, and my time with Z was one of the best times I've had in years. Any excuse would do.

*Me: Hey, jerk.*

*Z: hi :-)*

I again started staying up late and texting with Z. Re-reading our chats now, I see that he began to behave more aggressively towards me, intentionally hitting my emotions and complexes. I was mistaking his obvious attacks for stupid jokes, which is what he was probably aiming for.

Moreover, I became even more attached to Z, which led to another extremely humiliating moment.

 

*Me: You know, I wish you could be my girlfriend.*

*Z: Oh wow, the offer is certainly interesting, but I’ll probably refuse :-D*

 

Around late November or early December 2017, J continued to write to me again and send me a lot of gory stuff. I was annoyed by this and complained to Z about her.

A couple of days after I complained to Z, I received a link to a file-sharing service from him, and of course, being a complete idiot, I downloaded the folder that was on it.

After opening the downloaded folder, I was completely shocked. The folder contained almost all possible data about J that you could think of. even her parent’s passports. Z doxed J to me. But my idiocy didn’t end there. I, as a 17-year-old edgy teenager trying to seem cool on the Internet to my ‘cool friend‘, so wrote in response the most moronic thing I could.

*Me: Fuck, she lives in my city!!!*

 

Yeah, I was so stupid that I doxxed myself. What was I thinking at that moment? no idea.  Z responded very vaguely:

*Z: What a coincidence :-D*

At the end of January 2018, Z and I had a little fight over some nonsense.

A couple of days after this fight, I saw J near my school. She smiled, waved at me, and walked away. I immediately realized that Z had contacted J, and told her that we lived in the same city. I shared photos of my life with Z, and from them, J could easily identify my school, street, and, over time, even my look. and she did.

So now J stalked me not only online but also in real life. I was terribly scared; I didn’t know what to do. She pushed her drawings under my door, she walked down my street in the hope that I would come out to, her online spam increased threefold.

Z found it funny. Yeah, even after Z did this, I still forgave him, put on a “brave face” and continued to chat with him. I didn’t want to seem like a coward in front of him, so I didn’t say anything about this. I just asked why he did it, to which I received an extremely common “Z answer“

*Z: I thought it was a great idea :-)*

In March 2018, Z and I had this conversation:

*Z: Hey, explain to me why you are so dependent on the opinions of others.*

*Me: This is a strange question; I have no idea how to answer it. We're all a little dependent on it, aren't we?*

*Z: Maybe so, but you make all your decisions looking at those around you :-/-: “Oh my God, what will people say? What should I do?”*

*Me: Um... well, I'm just a little indecisive!*

*Z: No, you are afraid of those around you. Let’s say, why isn’t your photo on one of your social networks? M?*

*Me: What does this have to do with it?*

*Z: This is very important; it's stupid to be afraid to show your face simply because you think others will judge you. Others don't matter.*

As a result of this, I put my photo on one social network. exactly for a couple of minutes, then I felt anxious, and I deleted it. But these couple of minutes were enough for Z to download this photo.

I didn’t know that Z saw and even downloaded that photo.

In March, J’s actions began to cross all boundaries, even reaching the point of making threats towards my parents. I was afraid to tell anyone about J because she threatened me with false accusations several times. On the Internet, J began using the same emoticons as Z.

Z jokingly advised me to kill J, and even gave several methods of slow poisoning, and even presented me with a scenario for killing J in which I would remain undetected.

This all happened in the usual humorous manner that Z enjoys, so I didn’t pay much attention to it.

In June 2018, Z sent my childhood photo to our chat.

*Z: Cool outfit :-D*

I had no idea how to respond to this. I was in shock; words didn't come to mind.

*I: ?????????????*

In response to my message, Z sent more photos to the chat. photos of my parents, photos of my deceased grandmother, photos of my parents' old and new cars. And the photo that I posted earlier.

It was some kind of strange, unvoiced threat without a threat.

**I know who you are; I can find out even more.**

At that moment, so many thoughts were swarming my head that I didn’t even think about the implications. I was just scared.

Z is the only person whose gaze I felt through the screen, and at that moment I felt it. I felt him enjoying the moment of my weakness, the moment of his control over me. But I didn’t want to look weak—to look like a coward in front of Z. So I typed something extremely stupid:

*Me: Yeah, yeah, very cool. How did you do it?*

*Z: :-)-:*

I never found out how Z got these photos; Z didn’t tell me, and I didn’t insist because I thought that if I did, I would show weakness.

Looking at it all now, I can assume that Z somehow forced J or someone else to break into my house for this. but this is a theory without evidence.

 

At the end of June, after J once again stalked me on the street, I wrote Z an extremely irritated message in which I said that his joke with J had gone too far, that it was putting my whole family in danger, and that I was afraid to go outside because of him. I expected him to be angry, but instead, he answered me very calmly.

*Z: Okay, I'll fix it. Your loss*

After a week, I no longer saw J around my neighborhood. I thought that Z had talked to her, or maybe even bribed her with something.

Later, I found out from J herself that he actually tried to reason with her, but she refused. In retaliation, he sent her self-harm video to all work emails associated with the company where her mother worked. This forced her parents to take action and find her help.

In mid-summer 2018, I had an extremely memorable interaction with Z. While playing with him, we had a humorous argument during which I accidentally killed Z’s character.

I didn't think this would be a big problem, but for Z, it turned out to be. Z literally exploded in chat and typed some offensive and very hurtful things. After some time, he stopped typing; his character stood unmoving for about 3 minutes, then disconnected from the game. I didn't see him online for about 3 days. When he returned, he apologized for his behavior and said that he had misunderstood my words and the situation.

I described all this to make it clear that Z was a paranoid person who could misunderstand your words by turning them around.

From the fall to the end of 2018, I was overwhelmed with a lot of studying. Z, on the other hand, was busy at work, which is why we had almost no time to chat. At first, it bothered me. Z was my safe space, and it was hard for me. But then I became more open and made real friends.

My chats with Z at that moment were limited to just a couple of messages a day. Z himself began to behave much more apathetically toward me, but in general, he showed joy and even strange pride in me, That I am no longer limiting myself and socializing with other people.

In February 2019, it was revealed that my school’s network was compromised and was used for malicious purposes; this even made it to the local news. I don't understand anything about cybersecurity at all, so I won't even try to go into technical detail. All I know is that all the school computers were infected with something, and because of this, the data of several professors and students was leaked online.

I didn’t even think it could be Z at that time, but now I don’t rule out this possibility. Based on his further actions, he is quite capable of such things.

In April 2019, I received a personal message from R on one gaming platform.

R said that he saw me on Z’s friend’s list and asked how I was related to him. I replied that Z is one of my best friends. R replied that he, too, once considered Z his best and only friend, and he wanted to warn me about Z.

R, like me, was once a lonely teenager who was hiding from real life in video games, and in 2015, he met Z on the same Minecraft server as me.

R and Z began chatting under the pretext of language learning. R, as a Russian, did not know English very well, and Z did not mind learning Russian, which he already knew well.

R was 14 years old at that time, so it was easy for Z to take control of him. And if Z behaved like a friend with me, with R, he behaved like an older brother.

Their main communication took place in voice chat, which surprised me because in those rare moments when I had the courage to offer Z talking through voice chat, Z refused.

R was talking to Z every day, telling him about his life and telling him some of his very intimate secrets. Z gave R advice, helped with homework (to be fair, he helped me too), and even helped his family financially when times got tough.

Just like with me, at a certain point in their relationship, Z obtained a lot of personal information about R, creating an unspoken threat.

R blocked Z from all areas after Z sent sketchy people to photograph R's younger brother on his way home from school.

Despite all the earlier threats, Z did not respond to this in any way.

R also wrote that Z was responsible for leaking some personal data of two bullied 11-year-olds in Ukraine in 2012, which ultimately led to extremely sad consequences.

Just like me, R became more open over time, made a circle of friends, and became a fairly well-known local DJ. According to R, without Z, he wouldn’t have achieved any of this. This upset me and lowered my spirit, since I was proud of myself that I was able to change a little, and in R's opinion, this is not my merit but the merit of Z.

I can't confirm or deny R's story, but I am inclined to accept the main part of it.

I chatted with R for one day, after which I blocked him. I felt disgusted and uncomfortable, and I chose not to listen to him anymore. He said what he wanted to say and warned. Well, I guess too late.

In July 2019, I started dating.

Z showed almost no emotion to this news; he wrote that he was happy for me. I think that he already had another victim, and he didn’t spend as much time on me as before.

Despite this, in October 2019, he sent some people to my girlfriend’s apartment complex to take photos of her. after which he sent them to me.

*Me: You're sick.*

*Z: Well, we are all sick in some ways :-)-:*

I didn’t stop chatting with him out of fear; he had too much information about me and my loved ones, and I can’t imagine what I would have done to myself if something had happened to them because of him.

In 2020, Z himself began to show me the results of his actions. From hacked computers, surveillance cameras, and data leaks to raider takeovers. It was clear that he was showing this to me to implant in me **the idea that it could be me**, and this made me even more scared.

Z's messages stopped being sweet and friendly; they became sarcastic, sometimes with some kind of double-threatening overtone. I think that it was at that moment that the real Z, who loved to destroy, torture, and enjoy all the destruction, communicated with me.

In the fall of 2020, due to my stupidity (previously, I downloaded some files that Z sent me), Z gained access to my phone and sent phishing links to all my contacts. As a result, the finances of several of my friends were jeopardized. Z didn't even deny his involvement in this.

 

In December 2020, I heard Z's ‘voice’ for the first and last time. It was in a discord voice chat with a few other people, and he was using a voice changer. He sounded completely distant and had a strange French-German accent. Perhaps it was some side effect of a changer

In the winter of 2021, Z entered into a conflict with a Russian lawyer, O. I have no idea whether this was a 'direct' conflict regarding some legal matters (I don’t think so, since Z is not Russian) or whether O simply offended Z in some way online. But you could feel the anger from Z through the screen.

To my horror, Z was determined to seriously ruin O's life, and I had to watch. If Z stalked me, then he giga-stalked O. Personal photos, secretly taken photos, and even live broadcasts from the webcams of O’s relatives and friends were sent to me.

I think that Z thought that O was challenging Z’s intelligence by not ‘getting under control’, and every day this infuriated Z even more. But again, this is just my speculation, since I don’t know how the conflict between O and Z started.

Over time, Z's actions became more... physical. Z sent people to crash O's car, set his elderly father's house on fire, and beat up several of his friends and coworkers. ‘**Others suffer because of you**’ seems to be Z’s favorite tactic.

Did O do anything in response? he did. I don’t know what exactly , Z preferred not to talk about his failures, but from the context and some vague wording, I could understand that O was trying to somehow resist Z, which irritated him even more. 

In the late summer of 2021, Z was able to gain access to O’s personal computer and phone. In early autumn, Z outed O as gay using personal messages from dating sites and a collection of gay prose written by O. Z specifically posted this information on websites for people with extremely negative views of it. Given Russia's problems with gay rights, I don't think O got off easy.

After that, the only time Z mentioned O was when O's prose was removed from all sites on which it was published. Z was clearly delighted.

I was horrified; a person’s life was being destroyed in front of me, and I didn’t know what to do. I felt like an accomplice (I still do), and I was afraid that I would be next. I was scared for my family, I started having problems sleeping.

In November 2021, I couldn’t stand it and told my girlfriend everything. About Z, and J, and about the fact that Z sent people to take pictures of her, and about O.

She supported me, and we both decided that the best solution would be to block Z and forget about him. For several months, I was afraid of some kind of retaliation from Z, but it never came.



In the fall of 2023, J contacted me.   
She gets the help she needs, and she is very sorry for what she did. She didn’t want to discuss Z.

Sometimes I just go in and re-read our old chats with Z, just out of nostalgia, and I see that Z's accounts are still active.

My story may be missing something because I tried to tell only about the important moments leaving out the unnecessary. Because of this, I might have missed small details.

Thank you for taking the time to read this.
