“I am the last guardian. He who stands against darkness, champion of light. He who stands between chaos and order, between the forest and humanity. The one who defends the good and the pure against evil and the shadows of darkness.

I am the last outpost.

I am the Last True Guardian.”

 

Jonas leaned his forehead against the rifle barrel and took another deep breath. Over and over again he repeated the chant his father had taught him. He felt that every word was true, because that was what his father had told him. They were the last in a long line of warriors who for hundreds of years stood up for good against the evil that threatened in the darkness.  The screaming and banging from the basement door caused him to lose concentration and he looked up and looked away towards sound. It was Anna calling out to him. She pleaded and begged him to open and let them out. Slowly he stood up and crept through the dimly lit room towards the cellar door. The floor creaked under his feet and Anna fell silent, then she raised her voice again, she sounded hopeful. Two small voices mingled in with hers. Jonas swallowed. It was their two young boys. Jonas leaned his forehead against the plywood door and asked Anna to make hush them, please, they must be quiet! Did they not understand that they had to be quiet? Otherwise, he would not be able to protect them. He could hear the sound of the boys crying and Anna trying to comfort them, then he heard her voice crack and soon she too was crying. He pounded his hand on the door and asked them to please, please be quiet. The sound grew fainter, and he understood that they were heading down the stairs again. He exhaled. Did they not understand that he did it for their sake? He had seen the signs, seen how the darkness had reached for her. He was the man of the house and he had to act. Just like his father had done. He must protect them.

 

A hard bang from the other side of the door made Jonas flinch and back away. A man's voice sounded through the wood. Anders, their retired old neighbor. Jonas glared at the door. Anders didn't try to appeal to him like Anna had done. No. His words were harsher, more commanding. Was he trying to command Jonas? Jonas could not allow that! In two steps and he was at the door, driving the butt of the rifle into the wood so that a  jack was formed in the white coating. He roared at them to shut up! Jonas didn´t have to lock Anders and Gerda up, but they came and hand mingled, so Jonas saw that as his duty to take care of them too. But it was clear that Anders didn't understand. He was an ordinary man, lulled by society's lies. Jonas leaned against the wall opposite the door and began to chant his father's rhyme again. He was awake, his father had seen to that. His father had taught him how the world worked. Who was the real enemy trying to take over society and how he and those before him were chosen. Jonas knew, however, that he was not alone, as his father had claimed. He had found forums online where he found others like him, men who weren't blinded by the pretty surface, men who saw the world for what it was! He had shared what he had learned, and others had shared their knowledge and experiences. How they saw the enemy infiltrate society, all the important bodies, the police, social services, journalism, politics. If this was true, it was huge and devastating.

 

But never had Jonas ever thought they would go this far. That they would try to reach him through his own wife and children! She had sounded so convincing when she had talked to him, tried to make him believe that he was wrong, that he was crazy. He shivered, had to quell the doubts, had to protect the family.

He heard noises from outside the house and immediately became alert. He had darkened the whole house so that he would be protected by the darkness and the shadows. No one would see him sneak up to the window and look out over the yard. He had rigged up floodlights all around the house which were aimed at the yard. The lights reacted to movements. They may be goblins and ghouls but they still had bodies, bodies whose movements caused the headlights to turn on. They would be dazzled but he would see them. He focused on his breathing. No one would come and take him by surprise. He was prepared. The knocking on the basement door started again.

 

He had seen the signs. He alone understood what about to happen. The forest was coming, and it was his sacred duty to protect as many people as possible. He had had a plan. Such a beautiful plan. But Anna had found out he was up to something, and he was forced to deal with the matter earlier than planned.

Jonas sensed movement out in the shadows, just beyond the light. He felt the sweat beading on his forehead. He couldn't save everyone, but he would try to save his family and maybe his sacrifice would serve as a warning to others. Because there were other warriors out there, men like him who understood, who shared his fears. He had broken both his computer and his phone so that no one could eavesdrop on him, but he had written in the forum one last message, they were warned.

A dazzling light streamed out across the yard. Jonas swore and crouched down. Carefully he looked out across the yard towards the forest. Nothing. Wait? Didn't he see a movement over there by the tree? As quietly and carefully as he could, he opened a crack in the window.

He put the the rifle to his shoulder and took aim. Sure enough, he saw movement, a dark body. He took a deep breath and hugged the trigger. A shot went off and it was answered with a scream from the forest. He smiled. A hit! He had hit one of them with one of his specially made bullets. He has two varieties; silver and iron. It might not kill them, but it would poison them. Just like that big pig in that creepy Japanese cartoon that Anna had forced him to watch. He had against his will like the message, although Anna claimed that he misunderstood. It was rather she with her hippie ideas who was misunderstood! It had been about man's battle against nature, and he had liked that. Even if the rest of the movie was complete fluff.

 

There was another movement that caught his attention and he fired again. Behind him, the people in the basement had fallen silent. They had probably been startled when he shot. Jonas fired another number of shots at the shapes in the darkness. They couldn't see him, the lights were blinding them, but he still crouches under the window as he reloads.

 

In the pause that took place while he reloaded, he heard a crackling sound, as if from a speaker and a voice calling out to him from the darkness.

"Jonas Trokelsson! This is the police. We ask you to lay down your weapon and surrender voluntarily so no one gets hurt!”

The voice was crackeling as if the speaker was speaking through a megaphone, but Jonas knew better! He smiled to himself. They cannot imitate human voices perfectly. But it worried him that they knew his name. He frowned, remembering what another user in the forum had written about the enemy infiltrating important societal agencies like the police. He hadn't wanted to believe it himself but considering the two who had knocked on the door earlier, the blue lights thar followed and now this. Maybe they were right? Jonas shook his head. No, it wasn't true. They were just very good at imitating, but he could hear how wrong it sounded, like a recording.

He breathed deeply, when it crackled again, he jumped up to his feet and aimed his rifle at the sound and fired. A scream was heard and a sound like that of a body falling. Jonas smiled. He aimed further into the darkness beyond the line of light, they didn't venture any closer, but he saw their shadows.

Then he heard a shout and that was when he saw the lighting flicker and then the sound of glass breaking. They shot at his headlights! Disgusted, he put the rifle back on his shoulder and started firing wildly into the darkness. But then he felt a burning sensation in one arm, and then his chest. He gasped and looked down over his body, a dark spot spreading across his chest. Another stinging sensation in others and he felt the energy drain from him. Voices, running steps, someone kicked open the door of his house, he threw himself to his knees on the floor and raised the rifle then another shot went off, once again he felt the searing pain and he felt an invisible force hurl him against the wall before he fell limp down to the floor. As if in a daze, he saw shapes enter the room, as if from far away he heard voices, he heard the sound of steps, of doors being opened. Something he thought sounded like Anna. She screamed. He turned his gaze to the ceiling, where her face hovered above him, her eyes red-crying, her hair a halo around her pale face. He tried to say her name but his lungs couldn't push out the air to give sound to the words. He coughed, his mouth became warm and wet, tasted like iron. He tried to raise his hand and touch her cheek, they apologized to her. He had failed.

 

As the yard was bathed in blue and red light from both ambulances and ambulances Negin looked down at the man lying on the bunk. He was breathing weakly. Medical staff worked intensively to keep him alive. Such a waste of resources! He might have cost the Order one of their top men and she couldn't forgive that. He moved uneasily, his eyes opened, and his gaze flickered. “Ana!” he cried. Negin put a dark strand of hair behind her ear as she leaned over him and whispered in his ear: “I am one of the many, one of those who stand between the forces of nature and the kingdom of man. I am one of those who protect, one of those who have the right to judge and to punish. The forest is on my side and so is the sacred of humanity. We stand together against those who want to harm, those who want to tear down and those who want to destroy. I know who you are and will punish you accordingly, Witch Hunter!” The man's eyes snapped open, and she smiled to herself as she saw the shock in his eyes and how they then rolled back into his head as the last life drained from him.

She watched as the man was loaded into the ambulance. Behind her she heard the wind rustling in the trees. The forest moved restlessly. She closed her eyes and inhaled. The power of nature filled her. She steered her steps towards the other ambulance where they had already loaded Harrier,  her supervisor. He was on life support already and she sat down on the bunk beside him and took his hand. The trees wanted what she did. The forest wanted what she did.  He was one of those whose pain and belief in the smallest kindness keept the rest of them human. They needed him. He was the Last True Guardian.
