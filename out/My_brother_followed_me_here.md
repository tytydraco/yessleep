I have no idea what's happening but I feel like im going to lose my mind. I have been taking sleeping pills but it doesn't help. I still see him in my dreams. I see that little fuck waiting for me under the sink in the pantry.

Police have been checking on me and Julie pretty regularly. We're staying at her parents house right now up in Ipswitch MA. I like to tell myself will come all the way from NC but something tells me he's willing to do anything. Why? Or to achieve what I don't fucking know yet. 

But I keep having these dreams every night. I'll try to explain it but it sounds fucking ridiculous I don't know. I usually wake up in a forest covered in dirt with a sharp pain in my chest. There's always this screeching off in the trees. Next to me is a big stone pot but evertime I try to look inside it I wake up. If anyone knows what it might mean please tell me.

Me and Julie have been going on walks she said it should help clear my head. I honestly don't know if it helps. She's the only thing that can really keep my head clear. Her parents house isn't really close to town it's off a path in the woods but it's quiet, peaceful, open. There's alot of wildlife mostly deer and birds. I've been so on edge lately Julie has been trying anything to calm me down. She'll stay up with me when I can't fall asleep even though I tell her not to. This land is beautiful if I wasn't losing my shit this would be the perfect place to propose.

Fuck. God damn it I knew I wasn't being paranoid. He's here.

We were watching a movie The Fly one of my favorites. Then the whole house started smelling fucking horrible. The unmistakable sharp sour smell of something dead. I looked around the house frantic holding an axe in my hands ready for that little fuck. Julie was trying to calm me down get me to stop but I wouldn't I couldn't not until I found him. But I didn't find him just the source of the smell. In the kitchen packages of frozen food scattered all over the tile. Julie already had her hand on the freezer door I held the axe high above my head ready to end this.

The door flew open at her slightest pull and the whole house was filled with the piercing cries of a baby dear. Mangled and bloody it's body twisted and broken like some broken toy having been hastily crammed into the freezer. Julie weeped covering her eyes. With every desperate cry from the deer blood gushed out of its mouth and joints painting the tile in a deep crimson. I took a deep breathe reached over and grabbed a knife from the drawer. I quickly pushed it into the poor things chest ending it misery.

I argued with the police for what felt like hours I hated the idea of staying here. He knows that we're here I insisted. But the brain dead fucking donut munchers claimed that I lashed out on the deer after it broke in due to my considerable mental strain. Julie sat upstairs crying, I felt horrible, she shouldn't have had to see that. After the police left and I cleaned the kitchen I went to our room defeated and fell asleep faster than I had in a week. I had another dream.

This one was more vivid I felt in control. I tried to wake up telling myself I was dreaming but the more I thought it the less I believed it. That screamed pierced through the air. But this time it called my name, this time I could tell it was Julie. I shot up to run but woke up.

I got out of bed checked all the locks on doors and windows. The vents too especially the fucking vents. I kept the door to our bedroom locked and the axe by the bed. I layed down next to Julie and wept.
