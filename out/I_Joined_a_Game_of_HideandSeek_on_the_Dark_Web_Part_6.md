Hey guys, I know it's been a while since I [last posted](https://www.reddit.com/user/DantesGhost92/comments/1egjxu1/i_joined_a_game_of_hideandseek_on_the_dark_web/) anything about what's happening to me, and my posting of updates throughout this entire thing has been sporadic at best, but I promise we’re getting near the end now.

So the last time I posted, it was just after I’d managed to get away from that security guard after that masked brute had cut off two of my fingers on the Walmart roof. I’d managed to hide in the alleyway from the police, but I was still on the streets, still exposed.

I wandered for a few hours after that, looking over my shoulder constantly, expecting a Hunter to appear from out of nowhere. I didn’t know what to do. The Organisers had made it abundantly clear to me that if I tried to stay in one spot, to actually hide, then that would have severe consequences. I couldn’t help but shudder as I imagined that masked brute's face again sitting above me.

I still couldn’t quite understand how my life had taken such a complete nose dive in such a short space of time. This game was nothing like hide and seek, nothing like what was promised when I signed up. The Organisers were just changing the rules as they saw fit, trying to put on as entertaining a show as possible for their depraved customers.

I had no idea how I was supposed to survive now. I was back out on the streets, exposed with no way to hide. I was back to square one. No, in fact, I was worse off. Even if I could keep moving, I had nothing, all of the things I’d shoplifted from Walmart were still on the roof, along with my fingers. 

Looking down at my hand, the bandages covering the stumps had stuck to me, the blood that had slowly wept from them browning and glueing them tightly to the skin beneath. They cracked slightly as I tried to wiggle them, the stubs barely moving, making me feel nauseous.

Although I needed to go to a hospital, I knew that would just result in a lot of questions and me inevitably being dragged onto that stage in front of the bird-masked man like the Hunter who'd crashed into me all those days ago. Still, the idea of wandering around with a gaping, open wound on my hand didn't seem much better. 

Not only had he bandaged my hand up, but the masked man who’d visited me on the roof had left me with my phone and included some sketchy-looking antibiotics in my other pocket. There were enough tablets to last me a few days, along with a note that said “You’ll be needing these”. Presumably having one of your “contestants” being taken out of the game by a septic infection didn't make for good viewing.

As much as I’d begrudged taking any sort of help from the people responsible for my missing digits, I’d taken two of the pills. Forcing them down with a great deal of effort as my dry throat wished for nothing more than one of the bottles of water I'd abandoned on that roof.

I shook off those memories, there was no point in dwelling on what had happened, I needed to try and think of what to do next. There was a gnawing in my stomach that had slowly replaced the nausea, and coupled with the memory of swallowing those antibiotics, I was acutely aware that I’d not eaten or drank anything since fleeing earlier that morning. Sooner or later I would need food, and I was already uncomfortably thirsty. Yet another problem to add to my growing list.

There was no way I could go back to that store again. Even if by some miracle the security guard or the staff had decided to leave my things there for whatever reason, if they caught a whiff of me on the CCTV then they’d call the police straight away. No, it wasn't worth it, I needed something else.

First things first I needed to get off the streets, somewhere safe. Not only that, I’d soon need to charge my phone again. I had no idea how I was going to do that, my charger was on the Walmart roof and even if I had it I'd need somewhere to plug it in. I'd need to steal a new one and, what, break into somewhere to hide? That was only going to end badly. As much as I hated to admit it, I needed money.

At least with money then maybe I could check into a hotel or something, even if it was just a dive. I could pay with cash, give a fake name to drop the trail and hope to god that no one came looking for me there. I wouldn’t be able to stay long though, not after what had happened on the roof, as the throbbing in my hand painstakingly reminded me. But maybe I’d be safe for a couple of days. Surely that wouldn’t be too long? Heck, I could just go from hotel to hotel if necessary, at least that way they couldn’t say I wasn’t moving.

The early morning sun washed over me as I walked the slowly busying streets, my thoughts cascading over one another as I tried to plan what to do next. People were filling the sidewalk now, some on their way to work, others moving deeper into the heart of the city with the promise of shopping and fast food. They all added to the slowly growing crowd and I tried my best to blend in, just another person making their way.

After deliberating the points again and again, I decided that, although every fibre of my being was telling me it was a terrible idea, my best bet for survival was to somehow withdraw money. I was still pretty sure that the Hunters would be monitoring our bank accounts somehow, and that doing so would surely flag my location. But if I was quick and did it somewhere busy, somewhere that had lots of people, then I could try and blend into the crowds and slip away before anyone had a chance to try and find me.

Listing off possible locations in my mind, there were a few places that I could think of. My first thought was the city centre, there were large crowds and several ATMs. I could draw money out from any of them and then hide in one of the nearby shops.

However, in doing so, I’d likely just draw more attention to myself than anything. Although I’d managed to get some new clothes at Walmart, I still hadn't managed to shave or wash properly since this entire thing started. Not only that, my bloodied hand, wrapped tightly in the browning bandage, wasn't the most inconspicuous thing. I looked rough, to say the least, and the last thing I wanted was people asking me questions and offering to help, drawing even more attention to me. Another obstacle came in the form of the city centre, being the bustling hive of activity that it was, having a regular police presence throughout as part of the mayor's new crime deterrent scheme. If I ran from a Hunter then they might give chase, assuming I’d committed some kind of crime, then I’d be arrested and I knew where that train of thought led.

No, the city centre was too risky. I needed somewhere busy enough that I could blend in with a crowd, where the people were so involved in what they were doing that they wouldn’t pay me any mind. Somewhere that, if worst came to worst and I needed to run, then I wouldn’t alert any police patrols.

I thought for what felt like ages, racking my brains until something I’d seen in the window of the Walmart drifted through my mind. A small poster stuck to the glass of the large, external windows had advertised a street market taking place this week in a slightly more rundown area of the city.

I never kept up to date with these community events, they’d been introduced a while ago to try and bring some business to the struggling areas, but thinking about it that seemed like the perfect place to blend in. It would be busy, what with all of the food stalls and merchants in the street selling their wares to the crowds. I could blend in, get to an ATM and draw out some money, before slipping back into the throngs of people and working my way out of there. My appearance wouldn't be an issue as it wasn't in the nicest neighbourhood, people would just think I was a local who was down on their luck and leave me be. 

There would be alleyways around there too. If I needed to hide then I could always dart down one of those to avoid the Hunters. Sure it wasn’t ideal, but it was the best I could come up with right then.

I began to walk the several blocks that separated me from the market, playing every possible scenario over and over in my head. All the while, my eyes darted from side to side and my ears were pricked, causing me to jump at the slightest unexpected sound. Although there was nothing to prove it, I felt like I was being followed, like a Hunter was just behind me, reaching out as I walked on oblivious. The weight of my situation was getting to me, I needed to get this done and get off the streets.

After about 20 minutes I turned the corner and was met with a thick wall of people, all bustling along what had once been a large stretch of road that had now been closed off and filled with several tents. Much like I suspected, the place was bustling with people going between the stalls as the owners tried to draw the crowds in, so there were plenty of folks to blend in with. Pretending to inspect the stalls, I made my way through, slipping between the colourful tents and the varying aromas of street food and fresh fruit. This was better than I could have hoped for.

Still, I’d need to be quick. The less time I spent lingering here, the better. Slowly working my way through the crowd, I did my best to look as though I was interested in the framed pictures at the entrance of one tent, or the various coloured cheeses that were visible in another as I made my way further and further through the masses, searching for any shop that looked as though it might have an ATM sitting outside.

After a few minutes, I was able to work my way to a nearby hole in the wall, just next to a small convenience store. Looking over my shoulder all the while, my heart beat rapidly as I inserted my card and entered my PIN. Although the bustling noises of the market behind me drowned out the majority of other sounds, my ears were pricked, half expecting to hear footsteps approaching behind me.

I needed to be quick now, undoubtedly by using this machine I was pinging up on the radar of some Hunter or another, and it would only be a matter of time before they turned up. I gripped the edges of the ATM, tapping my foot impatiently on the ground as I willed the machine to go faster.

Then the screen changed, asking me how much I wanted to withdraw and my heart soared. I quickly selected $400 and hit enter. $400 would have hopefully been enough to cover food, a few nights in a cheap hotel, and pretty much anything else I would need to buy, at least until the game was over. I didn’t want to be doing this again.

The mechanism inside whirred and returned my card before presenting me with my money. Snatching it out of the hatch, I jammed it into my pocket and turned on my heel. I needed to blend back into the crowd, I needed to get out of here. I wasn't safe anymore. Although I was no longer standing in front of the ATM, I couldn't help but expect to hear shouts from over my shoulder as someone charged after me now that I’d given my position away.

Slipping into the writing throngs of marketgoers, I tried my best to blend in, once again feigning interest in the stalls and the produce of offer. They were selling all kinds of things, from fresh fruit and vegetables, fresh meat and seafood, to food trucks selling jerk chicken and all sorts of authentic Mexican cuisine. All I had to do was pretend I was here for that. As long as I didn’t act as paranoid as I felt then I would be ok. It was all I could do.

The smell of molten cheese and fresh tomato filled my nostrils and captivated my attention. My stomach began to grumble as I scanned around for its source. Then I spotted it. A few stalls down from where I was standing was a truck. This particular truck was selling handmade pizza, firing them in a pizza oven they’d integrated into the back of it. The tantalising smell of melting mozzarella was almost too much for my starving stomach to bear.

Gazing around at the masses of people making their way to and from each stall around me, not paying me the slightest bit of attention, a thought floated to the front of my mind. Getting some food couldn't hurt, could it? I needed to eat anyway, plus I’d just got some money. Yes, the Hunters probably knew where I was, but they would probably expect me to have run away already, much like I had planned to. Looking around again, there was no frantic movement anywhere in the crowd, no sign of someone forcing their way to where I’d just been. I could get this pizza and then get out of here.

Making my way towards the pizza truck, I took another look over my shoulder as I walked, only to barge clumsily into a woman queueing at a stall selling samosas and other Indian street foods. I turned to face her, ready to apologise. She’d had her back to me but turned to fix me with a disapproving gaze as she righted herself, and I felt the colour drain from me as I recognised her. I knew that face. The last time I’d seen that face was on my phone, on the footage of the Best Bits of the game I’d watched while on the Walmart roof. She’d been chasing that poor man along a rooftop before tasing him, the maniacal grin she’d been wearing flashing through my memory.

Terrified, I mumbled an apology as she gave me a quizzical glance, as though something about me had intrigued her. I turned away slightly, trying my best to hide my face in the shadows cast by my hood, hoping to god that she hadn’t seen me well enough to recognise me. My heart was in my throat and I had to stop myself from trembling. This was the closest I’d been to another Hunter since I was chased through the Mall. I was less than an arm's length away. All she would need to do was reach out and she’d be able to grab me and it would be over.

Turning on my heel, trying to look as calm as possible and hoping that the split second she’d been able to see my face wasn't enough for her to place me, I started walking in the opposite direction. I felt sick as my heart pounded, my vision almost wavering from how close I’d come to being discovered. I knew this was a bad idea, I knew something like this would happen. Why had I gone through with this? I needed to go! Now!

A few seconds passed, although it felt like an eternity, and a soft excitement wormed its way through the terror gripping me. I was still walking. There had been no hand on my shoulder pulling me back, no taser in my back sending me to the ground. I’d gotten away with it. I was going to make it.

But then a sound from behind me reached my ears that caused my heart to sink, and that nauseous feeling to intensify tenfold. Loud footsteps. Frantic footsteps slamming on the sidewalk behind me, getting louder and louder as they charged in my direction.

Without bothering to look around, I knew it was the Hunter. It had taken her a while but she’d placed my face. I’d probably only gotten as far as I had thanks to my unruly beard and unkempt appearance, making me appear different enough from my picture to at least throw her off for a second. Either way, none of that mattered now. She was after me.

I charged forward without thinking. I needed to put as much distance as I could between myself and the Hunter. I needed to lose her somehow. Cursing myself as I ran, I couldn’t believe my luck. In being so careful to avoid a Hunter that may have been actively hunting me, I’d accidentally bumped into another one who wasn't. She’d just been getting something to eat, and now she was on my tail. If I hadn’t walked into her I doubt she’d have even noticed I was there. Still, it was an odd coincidence to find a Hunter who just happened to be in the same market that I’d decided to go to to get some money. But worrying about it now wasn't going to help me.

I forced my way through the crowd, startled yells of people in the street following me as I did so, pushing bystanders left and right as I tried to carve a path through them. From the equally annoyed yells coming from behind me the Hunter must have been doing the same thing, trying their hardest to close the distance between us. I was moving as fast as I could, darting in and out of the masses of people, but it was like fighting against a strong current. I was going to get caught if I kept this up. I need to get off the street.

My eyes darted around wildly as I pushed past person after person through the crowded street, trying my best to look over their heads for any means of escape, any way that I could lose the Hunter who, from the sounds of it, was still right behind me.

I spotted something just beyond the edge of the crowd to my left. A small alleyway between what looked like an office building and the smaller store next to it. It was narrow but out of the way. There would be no one down there hopefully, as it was out of the way of the crowd. If I could dart down there then I could lose her.

Pushing harder through the horde of shoppers, I closed the distance and could see the alleyway more clearly now. With one final effort, I burst out of the masses and into the open space beyond, darting into the alley. As I rounded the corner, my heart sank as I took in the sight before me. It was a dead end. Just bricks on either side, a locked door set back into one of the walls and a tall, chain-link fence at the other end. I was trapped. This was it.

I could hear the Hunter still pushing her way through the crowd behind me, getting closer and closer. I couldn’t turn back. The best thing I could do now, the only thing I could do, was climb the fence. I knew I wouldn't be able to do it before she caught me, not with my injured hand, but my only other option was to stand here and let her catch me. Either way, I was dead.

I readied myself, preparing to charge at the fence, when movement from further down the alley caught my eye. The door near the end opened as a slim man in a shabby-looking suit made his way out, lighting a cigarette he’d obviously prepared for himself before leaning against the wall and taking a drag.

At that moment, an idea began forming in my head. If I could burst past him into the building, then I might be able to get away. I had no idea what the layout inside was, and no idea how to get back out once I was in there, but it sure beat being dragged to the ground from halfway up the fence.

Without wasting another second, I sprinted down the alley, the man turning to face me with a look of concern spreading across his face. I charged past him and into the open stairwell, ignoring his shouts of confusion and protest. Taking the stairs two at a time, and hurling myself forward with the railing, I practically flew to the second-floor landing. A closed door met me, showing an office space just beyond, the workers typing away at their computers unaware of the utter chaos that was about to befall them when I opened the door.

I tried the handle but to my horror, the door stayed firmly in place. I tried again, looking around frantically for something I may have to slide or press, when I noticed the keypad next to it. My heart dropped in my chest again as I realised there was no way I’d be able to get in. The chances of me being able to guess the code were minuscule, and there was no way I’d have enough time to kick the lock or force the door.

More confused shouts from below and clambering footsteps echoing around the stairwell told me that the Hunter was just behind me, having run past the man downstairs just as I had. I chanced a look back over the handrail and a cold chill pulled at the back of my scalp. Sure enough, she was there, only a few flights below me.

She locked eyes with me over the stair rail and my mouth went dry. Her face, her expression. There was something there in her eyes, like a hunger. She wanted to catch me, but it almost felt like she needed to, like I was prey she was stalking. But there was something else too, something I couldn’t put my finger on.

With her at the bottom of the stairwell, I needed to keep the distance between us. If I could just get into one of the offices, I’d be able to lose her in there. It would create so much confusion that I might be able to slip back out unnoticed, or at least I could try and get out of the main entrance.

Spinning around, I flew up several more flights of stairs until I reached the next landing, all the while her footsteps sounded behind me. I felt sick from the exertion, my ribs and calf were screaming in protest the harder I pushed myself. Not only that, I could tell from the burning in my lungs that I couldn’t keep this up much longer. Cursing my lack of physical fitness, I needed to come up with some way out of this soon or I’d end up collapsing from exhaustion.

I could hear her heavy breaths echoing up from below as she gave pursuit. Although heavy and frequent, they were nowhere near as frantic as mine. She was catching up. Scanning the landing, there was another door on this one too, but I didn’t even bother to try it, spotting the keypad lock next to it before I even got within arms reach. There was no way I’d be able to get in. Crap, crap, crap!

There was only one way left for me to go now. I carried on running, still taking the steps two at a time as I climbed. I couldn’t help but feel the crushing sense of irony about this whole thing. Not only had this Hunter not even been looking for me, but the only place I could go now was onto the roof, just like in the footage where she tasered that other man. I couldn’t help but imagine myself on the next Best Bits video, my twitching body lying flat on the floor as she tased me again and again. Still, maybe that would be better than having to stand in front of the bird-masked man.

The stairs levelled out, leaving me standing on another landing with a sloping roof and only a metal door ahead. With the echoing footsteps still in pursuit, I didn’t stop to think. I pushed the handle. It offered no resistance as it opened easily, with it being a fire escape there was no way it would have been locked.

Stepping out into the bright sunlight, my eyes darted around, looking for somewhere, anywhere to hide. As I took in the rooftop around me, panic started to take over. There was nothing, only the flat PVC flooring that covered it. No air conditioning units or ventilation ducts that I could hide behind, nothing. No, no, this couldn't be it, there had to be some way out of this, I couldn’t have come this far only to get caught out by my own stupidity. 

The footsteps echoing closer in the footwell indicated that the Hunter had just rounded the last set of stairs. She’d be on the landing in a second and then out here before I knew it.  Looking around again, my eyes darted frantically for something, anything to get me out of this. With a sinking feeling in my stomach, my gaze stopped on something to the right of me. 

The next roof was around 15ft away and slightly lower down. It was quite a distance away, but not ridiculously far. An idea formed in my mind, as much as I hated it. It was a dangerous jump, but not impossible. Maybe if I took a run up then I could make it?

I tentatively approached the edge and peered down. We had to be about 6 stories up, about 70 feet if I had to guess. My vision started swimming as I took in the details of the alley below and I had to force myself to look away. A cold sweat broke out across my forehead as I couldn't help but imagine myself missing the jump and falling like a stone onto the hard concrete below. This was nothing like the supermarket. If I fell from here, that would be it, I would be dead. How the hell had I let myself end up in this situation?

The sound of the footsteps levelling out snapped me back to my senses and I realised that the Hunter was probably just about to reach the door. I needed to do something, now! It was a choice between falling to my death or getting tasered, and then killed by the Organisers. Either way only one of those options had the possibility of me getting away, and I’d rather fall to my death than let that freak in the eagle mask shoot me for fun.

I heard the door behind me open and the Hunters slow footsteps making their way across the roof, confidently closing the distance, knowing that I had nowhere to go. I had to act now! Taking a couple of steps backwards, I paused for half a second, taking a breath and trying to calm the screaming voice in my mind, before setting off at a full sprint. There was a crackling sound from behind me and something ruffled the back of my coat where I’d just been standing. I didn’t stop to look back, knowing what I’d likely see in the Hunter’s hand. I charged towards the edge of the roof, every fibre of my being protesting, wanting me to stop, before I pushed off one final time and leapt through the air. 

The wind whipped through my hair as my feet left the ground and I soared, feeling almost weightless. Time seemed to slow as I took in the alley beneath me, moving in what felt like slow motion. I was ascending through the air, almost flying, before gravity seemed to kick back in and I fell hard, slamming down onto the roof of the other building. My shoulder screamed in pain as it connected with the ground and I rolled several times, coming to a stop in a heap on the hard surface.

But that didn't matter. I’d made it! I’d actually made it! Turning around, smiling like an idiot, I looked back at where I’d jumped from seconds ago, expecting to see the Hunter standing there furious that I’d managed to escape them. There was no way they would have expected it, no sane person would have tried something as stupid as that.

I could see her face scowling at me from above, staring daggers at me before she turned on her heel, disappearing from my sight and I breathed a sigh of relief. I wasn't out of the woods yet, I still needed to get out of the building and out of the street before she got to the bottom of her stairwell, but at least I’d bought myself some time.

As I was about to turn around and make my way to the fire escape on the edge of the building, she did something that made my stomach drop. Taking off at a sprint, she leapt into the air as my stomach somersaulted. No, no, no. This wasn’t supposed to happen!

I watched helplessly as she got closer and closer, soaring over the gap, her hair whipping about her face. The look she wore was a triumphant mask, her eyes drilling into me with an almost ecstatic glee, before slowly turning to a horrified grimace as she vanished just before the edge of the roof, her jump coming up short.

I waited, horrified and slack-jawed, for the inevitable thud as she crashed into the ground, but it never came. Instead, she screamed as she dangled several feet above her impending doom, having managed to catch her hand on the edge of the roof, clinging to it for dear life. She turned to me, her frantic eyes locking onto mine as she struggled. She was terrified.

With great effort, she seemed to reach up, trying her best to scramble to safety, going as far as getting her other hand onto the edge of the roof, but she wasn’t strong enough. She just hung there, frantically alternating between looking at me and looking at the drop that awaited her when her arms gave out.

She pleaded with me, screaming at me to help her, her voice breaking as she begged. Her screams were primal, like an animal that knew it was about to die. Tears were rolling down her cheeks, smearing her makeup as she begged me to pull her up. I stood there, dumbfounded, not quite able to register exactly what was happening. All I could think to myself as I closed my eyes was, this can't be happening. 

This woman was ready to hand me over to the Organisers just to secure herself a shot at winning but now she was begging me for help. What would make her think that I’d help her? What was there to say that as soon as I pulled her up she’d not try to capture me then and there? If anything, leaving her there would mean there was one less Hunter to deal with.

Slowly turning away, I bowed my head and started to walk towards the fire escape. I tried not to think about how she might have a family. How they would find her at the bottom of the alley, or hear about her on the news. I tried not to think about how her screams would still echo around in my mind whenever I closed my eyes, her terrified face staring at me in my nightmares. I tried to push it all away and ignore her.

More frantic pleas arose as she realised what I was about to do. At that moment I hated myself, I wished I could have just been the cold-hearted survivor that I imagined in my head. That I could just walk away. But the truth was that as much as this woman was trying to kill me, I couldn’t let her die. I’d never killed anyone before, and by leaving her dangling there on the side of the roof, I’d as good as sentenced her to death. I couldn’t help imagining if our roles were reversed, how terrified I would be that I’d never see my wife and son again. 

Tears rimmed the bottom of my eyes as I struggled to push the thoughts down, to just keep walking, but it was no use. Yelling in frustration, I turned back around and ran to the edge of the roof, squatting down next to the terrified Hunter. I knew this was probably going to end up backfiring, that I was probably going to regret it, but I couldn’t just leave her to die. The look of relief that washed over her face, still muddled with the abject terror that had taken up her expression moments before, helped me to justify my decision slightly. This was another human being, equally as terrified of death as the rest of us, no matter how much the Organisers wanted me to think otherwise.

I reached out and grabbed her, wrapping my hand around her wrist and pulling with everything I had. She was surprisingly heavy, but still, I gave it my all. All the while she was thanking me profusely, tears of joy and relief streaming down her cheeks. She began to scramble against the wall, using her legs to walk up like an absailer. Before long she was nearly at the top, nearly able to get herself over the edge. She looked me in my eyes as she tried to pull herself onto the safety of the roof, the hunger now gone, replaced by relief and elation.

That expression was swept away only a moment later, deformed back into the terrified mask from before as she lost her footing. Slipping back from the edge, her free hand flailed wildly as she tried desperately to find purchase. I was pulled down flat against the roof by her weight, trying my best to hold on, terrified that she was going to drag me over the edge with her. 

Holding someone up like this, it was nowhere near as easy as it looks in the movies. I didn’t know how much longer I’d be able to keep her from falling, I was barely able to hold her, and my entire arm felt like it was going to rip out of its socket at any moment. 

She screamed as she dangled there, swinging from side to side, kicking her legs and trying to scramble back towards the roof. The terror that plastered her face before was nothing in comparison to the now abject horror as she stared at the ground below. Her wide eyes flicked between the concrete calling to her from below back to me. All I could see was the fear and pleading in those tear-stained eyes, begging me not to let her go.

My shoulder burned as my muscles cried out, threatening to give way at any second as I tried my best to drag her back. I pulled with all my might, feeling as though I was tearing myself apart, but it wasn’t enough. I had nothing left, I wasn’t strong enough. There was no way I couldn’t get her back into a position where she’d be able to walk back up again. All I could do was hold on to her as best as I could while I tried my best to think of some way out of this.

A cold trickle worked its way along my spine as I felt her hand begin to slowly slip between my fingers. No matter how hard I felt like I was trying to hold on, no matter how strong my grip was, gravity was still trying its best to claim its prize. After what felt like aeons of agony, but in reality, was probably merely a few seconds, I felt her hand start to slip further and further down, barely holding on. Her screaming grew louder and louder as she slipped further, all the while I was trying my best to calm her, to tell her everything was going to be ok, even if I didn’t necessarily believe it myself. All I knew was that she was going to fall if I didn’t do something now.

Swinging my free arm around, I reached out towards her, trying to get a better grip and take some of the strain from my screaming shoulder. No sooner had my weight shifted than the pain ebbed away and my arm felt light as a feather and I was nearly thrown backwards. Her screaming reached an all-time crescendo as the Hunter's hand slipped from my grip, her arms and legs flailing around in the empty air as she plummeted, desperately scrambling for something to save her as she dropped like a stone. I could see her terrified face falling away from me, shrinking as she neared the ground, screaming in abject terror as she descended several flights in mere seconds.

All I could do was watch, taking in everything as though it was happening in slow motion before a sickening crack echoed between the buildings, silencing her screams as her body shattered on the concrete. Crimson splattered the ground where she landed painting the alley a deep red as she lay there, perfectly still, with thick ruby liquid leaking out from what remained of her nose and mouth. 

I was numb. Nausea washed over me as I stared down at her remains, it was all I could do not to throw up. I’d never seen someone die before. I mean sure I’d seen it online, hell I’d seen several in the streams of this game, but it didn’t feel the same. The screen provides a degree of separation, so you can at least try to trick yourself into thinking it’s not real. That it’s all just computer imagery or fancy practical effects.

But as I looked at what remained of the Hunter, there was no way of tricking myself into thinking that wasn't real. Her motionless, broken body, the pool of sticky red blood slowly spreading out around her and the crack of shattering bone that I could still hear in my mind were all very real. 

The wave of nausea intensified, coming on so hard that I had to look away. She was dead. She was dead because of me, because I couldn’t save her. This was my fault. I’d killed her. Sure she’d captured people and sent them to their deaths, sure, but she was still a life, a human being, and at the end of the day she was terrified when she died. Something that I could have prevented.

A small crowd had started gathering near the end of the alley, obviously drawn by the Hunter's screams as she fell. Some of them gasped in shock or screamed as they saw her remains, others were on their phones, I assume calling the police. Then a sobering thought washed over me, breaking through the grief and self-pity. As much as it tore me apart, I needed to go. If I was still here when the police arrived, then they’d undoubtedly want to question me. I’d be stuck in a police station, a sitting duck. 

As much as it made me feel like a monster I forced myself to my feet, ready to climb down the fire escape, before taking one last look at the scene in the alley below.  Looking past the corpse of the Hunter at the faces of the people beyond, something about one of the onlookers caught my eye. Their face stood out to me for some reason. It was one that I’d seen before, not too long ago. I could have sworn that, blending in with the rest of the people in the crowd, I saw Jenny!

Sorry, I need to take a break for a moment. Remembering that Hunter splattered there on the ground, it’s bringing back too many memories, too many feelings. I need to compose myself. I’ll post the rest of this when I get a chance.
