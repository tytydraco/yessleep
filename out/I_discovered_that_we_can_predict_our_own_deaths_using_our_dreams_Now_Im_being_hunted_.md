You’ve probably read the title and made the assumption this is another click-bait news article. You probably think things like this doesn’t exist, they’re ’fear-mongering tactics by the government’. Well you’d be wrong. In fact (and at risk of sounding like another conspiracy-nut), the government really doesn’t want you to know about this. It would cause a worldwide hysteria-induced panic. So have I got your attention yet?



My name is Dr. Joshua de Arno and I live at **\~\~REDACTED\~\~** . I specialise in neuroscience at **\~\~REDACTED\~\~** Medical Centre in the UK and I’m currently fearing for my life. For who’s coming for me. 



Excuse me, I *did* specialise in neuroscience. 



See within neuroscience itself there’s a number of different areas to be researched. The area I researched is certainly a niche one, one that nobody that’s not in the loop will have heard of until now: Mortis Oneirology.  



Mortis Oneirology comes from the Greek word ‘Oneiro’ which means to dream, and the Latin ‘Mortis’ to mean death. The study, put simply, is that of predicting our own deaths within our dreams.



I did not manage to finish my research before the lay-offs, so the research area is still wildly unknown and largely speculative. 



Oh yes, I was laid off if you hadn’t have guessed. Hence why I’m writing this post for the world to see. 



I’ll get all of the science mumbo-jumbo out the way in this next paragraph. If you’re not interested skip forward, if you are then I’ve tried to use as little technical lingo as I can to make it bearable. 



The primary idea we were working on in 2022 through to 2024 was using the physics concept of string theory. String theory in its most basic form is that every particle in the universe is comprised of minuscule vibrating strings. More speculatively, that the strings are actually vibrating between dimensions, between the 3rd and 4th dimensions. When combining that with neurological research on brain activity during the REM cycle, we found something truly fascinating. To put it simply, we live in a three dimensional world. We believe our dreams allow us to temporarily live in a four dimensional world, hence why dreams often make sense when you are in them, but become incomprehensible and blurry when we wake up. This is because our three dimensional mind is now struggling to comprehend what we experienced in a four dimensional world. It’s like having a chimp try and understand and empathise with the life and work of a stockbroker - it is simply not possible for their mind to comprehend. We discovered these findings were highly plausible due to our research on brain activity during the REM cycle when asleep, with the brain being far more active (and active in different, previously unused areas) than when awake. We found the average person in deep REM cycle used 40% more of their brain than when they were awake. That when awake the average brain could focus on and play one game of chess at a time, but in deep sleep the average brain would have the equivalent power of focusing on and playing eight games of chess at a time. This extra processing would be our subconscious brains potentially accessing and experiencing the 4th dimension, bringing us along as a spectator for the ride. 



I hope that wasn’t too much of a tedious read, but that’s the gist of the neurological fundamentals. 



Where we began to struggle was with the meanings of the dreams when participants awoke. They had clearly experienced something: some waking after a dream feeling happy, some sad, some angry, some scared, some confused and some more enlightened. The exact nature of the dream however could never be accurately examined nor explained coherently in the qualitative research. 



The common pattern we found was on dreams of death. And thus, the Mortis Oneirology department was created in the early 2010s. Over our decade or so of research and filings of dreams done by ourselves and the participants, we found a strong correlation between those who had dreams of their own death and then dying in real life in the same manner that they had dreamt of dying. This varied from dreams of falling to death, to dying in a train crash - even as far as one participant who dreamt he would be mauled to death by a bear. All of those are real examples that seemingly manifested their own deaths. Some would happen within the same month, whereas the longest was 9 years later. We recorded 884 dreams of the dreamer dying (over the past 12 years), with 804 of those dreamers now being deceased. Of that 804, we found that a staggering 92% died in a manner that was the same/similar to the way they had dreamt it. We found that reoccurring dreams of the same death also increases the chances. 



The reason for this is still unknown. More research will likely have to be conducted on the 4th dimension to fully understand how this phenomenon occurs - but it does occur. We believe that the 4th dimension potentially transcends time, that time doesn’t move in the same linear fashion that it does in our three dimensional world. This would mean that strong, distinct or reoccurring dreams are glimpses at different parts of our lives we are viewing from the 4th dimension. 



Naturally, a number of governments worldwide are conducting their own research on Mortis Oneirology to see if it could hold military applications. I believe a breakthrough was made, and could be why a number of us were laid off. And why a number of us are now being added to the missing list - daily. 



This is what brings me to now. I had a dream last night, a very strong one. One in which a man in a suit and dark sunglasses was following me. He pulled a gun and, well, I was added to the missing list. I’ve studied MO long enough that I know what this means, I know they’re going to come for me. This post is going to accelerate that process too. This coincidentally also brings me to the last point of Mortis Oneirology that we found in our research. 



Should you experience the Mortis Oneirology phenomenon yourself too- I’m sorry. We have found no cures or prevention techniques thus far, and it seems as if the death can occur at anytime. 



That’s what I’m going to try and fix. If I have the same dream tonight, which I’m sure I will with the likelihood of the scenario, I must try and gather more details on my own murder. To try and stop it. For my wife, for my children - for all of you. For all of you so I can continue my research and find a cure to this horrible phenomenon. 



Shit! I hear knocking at the door. Banging, in fact. This may be my time. I'll update when I can - if I can. 



Goodbye, and good night. Pleasant dreams to you all…
