It started with a dare.

My friends Ricky and Thomas wanted to see if I had the guts to step into a decaying mausoleum at the edge of town, the kind of place that smells like iron and mildew-covered secrets. And like always, I said yes, because “no” didn’t seem to be a flavor in my vocabulary.

Ricky had that manic gravity that pulled you into bad decisions with a grin. He was the kind of guy who made chaos feel like a team sport. Thomas was quieter, but no less devious. He carried bandages in his back pocket, not in case someone got hurt, but because he knew someone would.

They were my best friends. Which probably says more about me than it does about them.

The mausoleum sits on a private forested lot. I’d heard rumors that the Livingston family estate, who owns it, stopped paying for groundskeepers in the late ’70s. Their great-grandfather had started a textile factory that boomed, bringing abundance to him and his lineage. But somewhere down the line, the textiles stopped selling, unions formed, and the shady practices the family relied on eventually drove them into bankruptcy.

When the money dried up, no one could afford to maintain the family mausoleum. And people don’t exactly line up to buy another family’s decrepit cemetery plot. They were an odd bunch anyway, a secretive family.

And unfortunately for them, abandoned places like this tend to attract vagrants, cultists, urban explorers, and dumb teenagers. I just so happened to fall into that last category. And unfortunately for me, I’m incredibly susceptible to peer pressure.

When we arrived at the rusted iron fence tipped with spear points, we slid through a gap Ricky and Thomas had discovered on a previous excursion. Ricky had gotten a sleeve caught on one of the jagged barbs last time and bled all over it. He wore the bloodstain like a badge of honor and told people it was from a bobcat attack.

The weeds came up to our hips, scratchy yellowed cheatgrass and pinkish green pokeweed with blooming white-stemmed flowers grabbed at us like fingers as we passed.

We pushed on and found cracked, overgrown Livingston headstones. One read:

*Tuffy, the loyalist dog, my fondest friend. 1978 - 1990.*

So they weren’t just burying humans here. It was their pets too.

The mausoleum sat like a weathered white marble skull. The gridiron doors were broken and folded outward, large pieces of chipped marble propped against either side so the entrance looked like an open mouth.

Orange lichen sprouted like black mold along its pocked, greying surface. It wasn’t huge. The walkable space inside the mausoleum was the size of a closet, but along the walls sat ten or so individual slots where coffins pointed outward toward you as you passed by. Only about half were occupied. The rest were deep square holes full of dust, cobwebs, and seeping pits of darkness.

Inside, as I peered in, I saw that it was dark, though I could make out the faint outline of spray-painted red pentagrams and scrawled phrases in Latin and English on the interior walls.

“Go in and get a bone. A knuckle bone or some shit. If you don’t do it, you’re a pussy,” Ricky said.

Ricky had the biggest mouth of anyone I knew, but it was an act. He wore cruelty like a costume, mostly to distract people from how much he cared.

“A hundred dollars if you get a whole hand,” Thomas teased.

Thomas was stone-faced. He usually went right along with Ricky’s antics.

Declining the dare would’ve been a direct hit to my dignity, so of course I had to accept. I always had to prove people wrong, even if it didn’t mean much in the end. I’m the type of stubborn that leads people whistling and smiling into their demises.

Some little twinge in my gut told me not to go in there. But I didn’t listen to my gut. I never did.

I stepped forward, and the wind seemed to shift, like the tilting head of a listening ear. It whistled through the marble vault.

I clicked my flashlight on and scanned it around. Several of the burial sites had been disturbed. I saw fetid black rot oozing like tears from the edges of the crypt fronts.

In the center stood a pedestal atop a series of red pentagrams. The smell was obscene, a mix of ammonia and rot. I slid my shirt over my nose.

Animal carcasses sat like grave offerings around the wooden pedestal. Mummified rodents, cats, dogs, what looked to be a raccoon. Decayed sockets stared up at the ceiling, almost begging for God to let them leave this place.

Candles burned down to waxy nubs circled the centerpiece on the pedestal: a single human skull, warped and blackened. A long-healed fracture split the crown unevenly, like it had been cracked open at some point and then sealed again with time and pressure.

A violent wrongness sank over me like a black shroud. Those empty sockets. That stretched, open jaw. That ridged split down the crown stared up at me like it had been cleaved and left to harden wrong. Tiny fractures ran outward from it like a spiderweb. Some of the teeth were missing.

Directly below the pedestal, in a gap between carcasses, I saw the edges of words formed beneath a pile of leaves and debris. I kicked the mess away with the side of my foot, revealing a chilling phrase:

*The Split Girl.*

The name hit me like a drop in my gut. And at once I saw a vision of her — maybe not clearly, but enough. A girl held down on a stone slab. Straps over her limbs. Something metal, humming. A mouth open in a tortured scream, eyes wide and unfocused. Her body convulsing like it was being torn in half. Just raw pain, locked in a loop. Not madness. Someone else’s memory.

I hadn’t noticed before now, but my eyes locked on one of the crypt fronts behind the urn that had been pried open. Crowbar marks bit deep into the marble like teeth. The tomb’s plaque lay smashed into scattered pieces across the floor.

Inside the hole, I saw the edge of a casket, splintered and blackened. The bones were curled in tight, locked into a shape of permanent recoil. Scraps of melted cloth clung to her ribs. I imagined this was where the skull had come from. From the Split Girl. God, it made me sick looking at it — at human remains so carelessly desecrated. The room pressed in like it was listening with bated breath.

I heard my friends chuckling outside. I leaned down and touched the skull. Jolts of static popped at my fingertips. Without thinking, I slid my fingers around it and pulled it free from its resting place.

I placed it in my backpack. God knows why. In that moment, my arm moved like a claw machine, outside of my control. The warmth leeched from my hand with each second my skin touched the ridged, bony surface.

I should have put it back. I should have placed it into the casket with the rest of her remains. Whoever she was. She’d already suffered desecration. Some vile form of worship. She was human — someone with aspirations, with love, humor, intelligence. That flash of vision I’d had — was that her torment I’d borne witness to?

And now I had taken her skull from a dusty pedestal surrounded by rotting animal carcasses and shoved it into my backpack.

And now I had taken her skull from a dusty pedestal surrounded by rotting animal carcasses and shoved it into my backpack.

And I couldn’t even tell you why I’d done it. Why I’d broken an intangible seal between my world and theirs. I felt a weeping agony in that skull. It burned bright like a solar flare. The world began to spin as I rushed out of the mausoleum.

I nearly bowled over my friends on the way out, nausea boiling in my chest. I shoved past them, shivering, and collapsed into the weeds. The sun’s rays were a warm, coaxing blanket, but God, I still felt so cold inside.

“Whoa, are you okay?” Thomas asked, a note of genuine concern in his voice. I could see the worry building in his eyes.

Ricky knelt nearby, holding out his canteen. “You’re gonna be okay, man,” he said.

“It’s fine. It’s fine,” I said between heavy breaths.

“Did you get a bone?” Ricky asked, half-joking.

I shook my head. I lied.

“I’d like to go home now,” I said, and started walking toward the fence line. My friends followed behind, bombarding me with questions.

“I’m sorry we dared you to go in there,” Ricky said after a moment of silence.

I didn’t respond. Because it wasn’t okay. Because I wasn’t okay.

My feet moved separately from me. Each step a willful defiance of my autonomy. I felt guided by hands unseen.

And like a break in time, the next moment I can recall was sitting in my bathtub, clutching the skull. Letting the water wash away the dust and grime from both of us. It was like the walk home never happened. Time had skipped away from me like a stone across a pond.

The eye sockets were hollow pits. The nasal cavity an open, yellowed cave, jagged and raw. I stared into it too long and started seeing visions in the flurry of water around me.

A girl backed into a corner. Her arms bound. A leather belt whipped across her body, again and again. Blood pooled in the dips of her spine, filling the grooves like a flood rising behind stone.

I saw her strapped to a hospital bed. Diodes glued to her scalp. Patches of hair missing, skin pale and slick with sweat. She began to seize beneath the current. Her mouth opened like it could tear her face in half. I watched it all unfold from above, distant, like a ghost. But I felt it rattling in my bones.

The priests chanting, splashing water on her.

Finally, I watched an axe hammer downward in a clean arc from meaty hands, directly into the top of her skull. Her father brought it down like he was chopping wood.

I watched her survive. Somehow. God only knows how. I saw her sobbing, changed. Her left eyelid permanently closed. Her left arm limp. A ragged patch of missing hair on her scalp. She was locked in a closet, iron manacles around her ankle.

Torture of unfathomable degrees. Generations of pain inflicted on one young soul.

I set the dripping skull down on the white and gray bathroom rug. My heart was a thunderstorm. A monsoon beneath my ribs.

Time kept slipping. I hated the feeling of losing control. I felt something trickling down the side of my face. My left ear was ringing. When I touched below it, my fingertips came away smeared with blood and a yellowish cochlear fluid.

I got out of the shower, cleaned myself up, and wrapped the skull in a towel, carefully, avoiding direct contact. I slipped it into the closet. My mom drove me to an emergency visit with an otolaryngologist. She was concerned, pacing in the lobby. She tried to pry the truth out of me, asked me what had happened. 

It wasn’t exactly a lie. I really didn’t know how it had happened.

I’d ruptured an eardrum. The tympanic membrane, they said, is the thin layer of tissue that separates the outer ear from the middle ear. Mine had torn clean through. They packed the canal with medicated gauze, gave me antibiotics and something for the pain. I was told to keep it dry, not to put anything in it, and to let it heal on its own.

The strange part was how precise the tear was. There was no damage to the tiny bones or nerves deeper inside, the really delicate stuff that controls balance and hearing. It was like something sharp had gone in, sliced the membrane, then stopped short of everything vital. Clean. Intentional. Like I’d taken a chopstick, stuck it in just far enough, and twisted.

I rushed to my room when I got home. I needed some sort of escape. Do you ever have one of those days that sinks like a stone in your gut? Even thinking about it feels like touching a sour wound? That’s how I felt.

My phone buzzed. A text from Mom.
“Hey, sweetie. I made soup—it’s on the stove. Don’t stay up too late, okay? Let me know if you need anything. Sorry about your ear. Love you.”

She always left sweet little texts. Just small ones. Like breadcrumbs in case I got lost. Quiet little nothings that showed she cared.

I slid into my desk chair and started up my gaming PC. I kept only one side of my headphones on. Slowly, I began to lose myself in the rhythm. My body slinking down into the chair, wrapped in a warm blanket.

The skull, the mausoleum, the visions of pain began to seep away from me like a deep breath.

Then I heard something skittering behind me in the darkness of my room. Light hands. Bare feet. Quick, sharp movements across the floor. I peeled off my headset and turned around. My bed sat stilted on its legs, sunk into a pocket of shadow. The sound stopped. Then peeled away, just out of reach.

I turned back toward the monitor. The skittering followed. Quieter now. I caught a flash of movement along the ceiling in my periphery. It scuttled fast and low to the surface.

I felt watched. With an intensity. Like something was memorizing the shape of me. 

I tried to drown it out, but my mind betrayed me. I imagined a pale face pressed against the ceiling, hair hanging like moss from a drowned tree. I imagined her clinging there, arms bent wrong, back arched, her neck craned so she could look straight down at me. I saw her eyes. Wide and dark, like the sockets in that skull.

The room smelled musty, cloying, like an old funeral home.

I turned my head again and glimpsed another flicker of black dart past my vision. Something moved like an insect, but far too large. My hands trembled on the mouse and keyboard.

The urge to flee tightened in my chest. I could feel her behind me, just beyond reach. Each time I turned, she shifted. A shimmer of pale skin. A foot slipping into shadow. She was playing with me. A slow unraveling.

I set the headphones down and ran from the room.

Behind me, I heard the slap of hands hitting the floor. Quick and precise.

I threw the bathroom door shut and collapsed onto the tile, rocking back and forth. For the first time, I truly wondered if I was losing my mind.

I flipped the shower on and cozied myself up on the bathroom rugs, hugging my knees to my chest. My head sat below the rim of the tub. Time began to weave away as I scrolled through my phone feed, distracting myself.

Trying not to think about those arched fingertips slapping the floor. Following me. That flowing hair and those wide eyes like two-toned coins.

After a few hours of wasting water and listening to its gentle tingle, the thought occurred to me. I needed to sleep. I had school the next morning. I couldn’t spend the night lying in the bathroom.

But I didn’t want to move. Didn’t want to go back down to my room. To hear the chitter of feet. I couldn’t handle it. I’d return the skull tomorrow after school. I’d do whatever I needed to make it right.

I thought she was down there still, looming like a phantom in the unseen corners of my basement room.

But then I felt something glide against the skin of my left cheek. Like a strand of spiderweb. A soft, quiet touch. My hands became stone. I heard a creak in the tub, beneath the water, behind the curtain.

I knew immediately it was her. She’d crept past me somehow. Wormed her way inside the tub. Whatever the hell she was.

My eyes glued forward to the screen. I lay slumped, fetal, on the floor beside the tub. Visions of snarling fangs and chipped fingernails, all biting and tearing, flooded through my mind.

I felt the tub shift again, groaning with the weight of something heavy moving inside.

Water droplets began dribbling down the angular lines of my cheekbone. One slid past my lips. I felt more invisible strands moving across my face. A shadow crept over me.

If I looked, something would break inside me. I knew that much. But I couldn’t go without knowing. A pull this way and that. A battle between knowing and ignorance. Would it go away? Odd how I knew what it was. Who it was.

I started to turn my head. Long tangles of charcoal black hair hung down from the lip of the tub. They moved across my face like writhing millipedes as I brushed them aside with the slow rotation of my neck.

A hand reached down. Skeletal, soaked, the nails yellow and peeling. It hovered above me for a moment, then lowered with agonizing grace. One cold fingertip touched the top of my scalp, gently, almost like a caress.

Her voice rasped above me, soft as wet paper.

“This is where he split it open. My father. With an axe. Said he had to let the sickness out.”

The finger lingered. It traced the part in my hair, slowly, back and forth.

I shook. Every nerve in my body screamed. My chest rose and fell in short, silent gasps. I couldn’t move. Couldn’t look away.

Then her face appeared over the rim of the tub. Water ran in streams from her chin, her lips pale slugs. Her eyes were black marbles dipped in red ink.

I smelled the potpourri now. Sweet and rotten. My ear rang louder and louder. My chest was alive with a pounding heartbeat, like fists against the prison bars of my rib cage.

Run. Run. NOW.

But I was locked inside myself.

Her mouth peeled open, and her teeth scraped together as she breathed.

“Bring your friends to the tomb before sundown,” she whispered, each word leaking out like breath through cracked porcelain. “Bring a padlock. Seal them in with my skull. Like they sealed me in there.”

A hiss followed. Long and hollow. Like steam from a ruptured pipe.

“Trick them,” she breathed, her voice fracturing into a bitter hum. “Laugh with them. Hold the door open like it’s nothing. Like my father did, when he told me it was just a place to pray.”

Then her tone dropped. Colder. Hungrier.

“If you don’t… I’ll hang what’s left of your mother from the ceiling by her hair.”

Another hand descended. Slow and deliberate. It cupped my face like it meant to comfort. But it burned. A deep, chemical cold that seared the nerves beneath my skin. Her nails raked along my jaw, finding bone with practiced ease. A wet thumb slid past my lips. 

I gagged as it pressed inside, slick and wrong, its nail tracing the soft grooves of my gums like she was searching for something hidden.

Then she hooked beneath my jaw.

Not to hurt. To hold. To own.

My eyes darted, trapped in the space between her face and the shadow above it. My heartbeat was frantic, a caged thing trying to tear free through my ribs.

And then—

I was awake.

Lying on my back in cold sweat, my phone alarm buzzing beside me. The bathroom was still. The rug twisted beneath my legs. The tub curtain untouched. The water still running.

I didn’t remember falling asleep.

Everything before felt like a dream pulled tight over my face. Not gone, just dulled. Like memory left to soak too long. And yet, I could still feel the pressure of her thumb against the roof of my mouth.

When I passed the bathroom mirror, I saw fingertip bruises all across my face. Small crescent lines of dried blood where nails had dug in. My mouth tasted like I’d been sucking on batteries. My ear ached.

My mom stopped by after a while.

“Honey, are you ready to leave?” she asked.

I imagined her hanging from the ceiling by her hair, head tilted unnaturally back, eyes wide and glassy. Her body a dissected ruin of blood, muscle, tendon, and bone, swaying ever so slightly. The threat returned all at once. It took everything in me not to scream.

“I’m feeling under the weather. I might stay home today, if that’s okay.”

“Can I get you anything? Are you okay?” I could hear the worry in her voice. The same worry she’d had at the ENT’s office.

“No. Thank you, though.”

She retreated, and I slumped against the wall, dreading what I’d have to do. I’d stumbled into a web far vaster than I’d imagined. I’d set things into motion beyond my control.

I went to step into the shower when I saw a curled black, sopping mass at the bottom of it. I picked it up between my fingers. It was one of Mom’s scarves. From inside her closet. My heart dipped low in the drizzling downpour. A message. A threat.

I needed to find out more about the Livingston family. I clumsily dabbed concealer onto the bruises using my mom’s makeup cabinet.

Then I biked to the local library, kicking up dust and cutting down weeds creeping along the sidewalk.

The library was an architectural tomb, like three cinder blocks stacked on top of one another, grayscale lined with curling red brick.

I chained my bike and went inside, casually meandering down to the lowest section. I know the library well—an abnormality in this day and age. But I like the smell of books. So what? Sue me.

I wandered down, still disheveled from the severity of my encounter. The emptiness of that basement level made my hairs prickle. I kept thinking of long black strands caressing my cheek, of glancing up to find two eyes watching from the porcelain walls of the tub.

This was where they kept the oldest books. Census records, old newspapers, ephemera. The shelves had a patina of dust. The carpets curled at the edges. Some of the lights flickered in soft, silent spasms.

I worked through pages of poorly organized material. I spent hours down there in the cool dark. Eventually, I found an old Livingston family biographic. The pages were yellowed and wrinkled. I sat on a musty couch and thumbed through it.

Halfway through, a page caught me. A photograph.

A girl strapped to a hospital bed. Maybe fifteen. Her wrists and ankles bound in leather. A priest stood nearby with a scarf in hand. Two nurses restrained her shoulders. Two Livingston men lingered in the background with their faces blurred, arms folded.

Her face was slack with terror. Her mouth hung open in a wordless scream. I could almost hear the whine of some old machine beneath it all, a distant electrical hum crawling through the concrete. I couldn’t lift my eyes from the image.

The caption beneath it read:
*Religious intervention, 1947*

The next page showed her again, this time slumped in a chair. Diodes clamped to her temples, cuffs tight around her arms. Her head had been shaved unevenly, tufts of dark hair clinging to her scalp. A hand hovered over a switch.

Jesus Christ. The pain she must have felt. It buzzed beneath my skin like my nerves had caught fire.

A smell hit me. Sweet at first, like dried rose petals and orange rind left too long in a bowl, turned bitter and sour with time. Something perfumed and rotten, like grief preserved in a jar. It nibbled at my throat.

The page shifted under my hand. The air around me felt wrong. Too still. I looked up.

She was there.

Not in the book. In the room.

Half-hidden past the shelves, hunched low like her bones had settled wrong. Her hair hung in wet strands around her face, clinging to her cheekbones. Her eyes met mine—dark, bottomless. It was an insects gaze. 

I couldn’t move.

She tilted her head slowly, a dry creak echoing through her spine, and her lips barely parted.

Then she was gone. Scattering back into the darkness.

The next page showed her laid out on a table. Two doctors stood over her. Orbitoclast in hand. A mallet raised. The rod already buried beneath her eyelid.

*Transorbital lobotomy authorized by Livingston family physician.*

Why was this even documented? God, it was sick. It was vile. But I couldn’t look away.

Staring at those images, I realized this wasn’t just fear or ignorance. It was punishment. She wasn’t treated like a person. She was treated like a mistake the family wanted to erase. First with rituals, then wires, then steel. Whatever the Livingstons thought was wrong with her, they didn’t try to understand. They tried to cut it out. And when that failed, they buried her.

But you don’t bury rage like that.

Pain like hers doesn’t stay quiet.

I heard scuffling nearby. The scent returned, thicker now—wilted lavender soaked in stagnant water, something trying to mask a deep rot and failing. 

It burned in my lungs.

I closed my eyes, threw the book down, and ran forward. I couldn’t handle seeing her again. Not after that. Not after she looked at me like she knew.

A hand seized my ankle. Ice-cold. Dry and cracking. I fell hard, my head rebounding off the thin carpet stretched over concrete. My breath hitched.

That grasp wasn’t meant to hurt.

It was a warning.

The pipes above me rattled softly.

I stumbled away, knocking over a stack of old letters, and rushed toward the stairwell without looking back. I took the steps two at a time and burst through the door, heaving.

And as I sat there, chest rising and falling, I made a decision. One I know I’ll regret for the rest of my life.

I needed to hurt my friends to satisfy a bloodlust I didn’t cause, because of a series of horrific events I did.

I thought of my mother. The countless hours she spent sitting at the edge of my bed, stroking my hair after Dad left. Comforting me when her own world was collapsing into dust. She gave me that. She brought me love when she had none left for herself. She carried the weight of unimaginable pain and still found room to care for me.

Then my thoughts turned to Ricky and Thomas. Us, laughing as we coughed on cigarettes, joking as the fingers of smoke curled into the night sky. There was comfort in that scene. A quiet, reckless peace. The kind you don’t realize is valuable until it’s already behind you.

But my world was pitching forward. A sinking ship. Teetering on the edge of a black, oceanic void.

I had set something deeper in motion by taking that skull. No matter how unconscious the act may have seemed, stepping into that mausoleum was a choice. And choices come with consequences.

I sat on the upper floor of the library with my finger hovering over a message for nearly ten minutes. These weren’t throwaway friends. Not passing acquaintances. They were my best friends in the world. They had been there for every schoolyard fight, every detention, every scraped knee and laugh-so-hard-it-hurt moment after school.

My hand trembled, caught between the weight of losing my mother and the two other people I loved most.

My mom once told me the scariest part of parenting wasn’t the danger. It was knowing your kid might be in pain and being powerless to stop it.
I wonder if she would still say that, if she could see what I was about to do.

I imagined Ricky and Thomas’s faces. My mother’s face. A tennis match of grief in my mind. The pressure behind my eyes rose. A hot swell of sorrow built in my chest like a boiling kettle, steaming and screaming for release.

And then I sent it.

A text inviting them to meet me at the mausoleum that night.
The second I hit send, something shifted inside me. A thread snapped. A line crossed. I felt it. Like I had broken a vow. Stepped out of the light. Done something unforgivable.

My mother’s image came without warning. Vivid. Horrific. Her body hanging from the ceiling fan, swaying gently, suspended by the torn length of her own scalp. Her skin bloodless and slack. Her clothes soaked red like they had been steeped in dye. Strips of flesh strewn across the carpet like dried leaves in October. Her eyes blank.

I had to make a choice. To end this. To save her life.
It wasn’t a fair choice.
It wasn’t mine to make.
But I was an animal in a trap. I could chew through my limb and drag myself free, or wait for the hunter to come and put a hole in my head.

It took me over an hour to stop crying.

Then I rode to the corner store and bought a padlock. My mom wouldn’t be home for a few more hours. Her shift always ran late. I tiptoed through the house, cautious, quiet.

I retrieved the skull from the bathroom closet, still wrapped in a beige towel. As I reached the stairs, movement flickered at the edge of my vision.

She was there.

Standing at the threshold of my mom’s room. Low slung, sharp jawed, her body folded in on itself like she was coiled to strike. Her eyes locked on mine. Not aggressive. Not even expectant. Just watching. Measuring.

I didn’t turn to face her fully. I didn’t need to.
I saw her retreat in slow motion, like a tarantula slipping back into the funnel of its web. She was waiting. Waiting to see what I would choose. What I was willing to become.

I biked to the cemetery and waited in a small clearing next to a tombstone split clean down the middle. It was folded over itself. I unwrapped the skull, removed the padlock from its packaging, and shoved the towel and lock into my bag.

And I sat, rocking in the weeds for hours. Chewing over the choices I was about to make again and again. My friends of over a year. God, that hurt. It was agonizing, thinking about betraying them. Leading them to an unjust demise. I held the thought in invisible hands, rolling it over and around. Looking at every angle. Searching for something I had missed. Licking at the thought like a cold sore inside my cheek.

I got up and moved aside two large pieces of marble blocking the gates to the mausoleum. Hid them in the brush nearby. I tested the gates, made sure they closed.

Until I heard the thump of metal at our makeshift entrance and realized the time had dwindled. The sky was melting into the horizon. I swallowed. My pulse quickened. They approached me, and I stood from my spot in the weeds.

“Hey, you feeling alright? You look exhausted,” Ricky asked.

“Yeah, you look like shit,” Thomas chuckled.

“I’m just feeling sick with worry. I took something out that I shouldn’t have.”

I handed them the skull, told them I was too afraid to return it. I begged them to help. Just like I had hinted at in the text messages.

They glanced at each other, puzzled. I watched Thomas shrug, and they moved toward the mausoleum just as the last few orange flickers of sun brushed across the sky.

I pulled the now-unlocked padlock with the twist dial from my pocket.

They stepped inside, flicking on their phone lights and peering around the pitch-black interior.

“Just on that pedestal,” I said, voice barely holding together. Guilt already boring a hole straight through my guts.

I grabbed both sides of the gate and slammed them shut. The sound rang out, sharp and final. My friends spun around abruptly, but I had the lock up fast, clicking it into place. I spun the dial.

They rushed forward, hands gripping the bars. A mix of fear and confusion swelled in their eyes. The gate rattled, iron grinding against iron, but despite the rust, it held firm.

“What the fuck, man?” Thomas yelled.

“This isn’t funny,” Ricky added, his voice sharper than I’d ever heard it.

I shook my head, stumbling back, retreating from their panic.

“I’m sorry. I’m sorry,” I said over and over, the words falling useless from my lips. My vision blurred with tears, my chest buckling under the weight of it.

Then I saw her.

A shadow stretching behind them.

“I’m sorry we dared you to go in here. Come back, please,” Ricky shouted, his voice cracking, a tremor of fear bleeding through.

But it was too late.

She stood behind them. Bent wrong, too tall for her frame, her limbs contorted with extra joints bending the wrong way. Her arms were raised, fingers twitching, muscles pulled taut under skin that looked like it had been dried and stretched and nailed back into place. She wasn’t just waiting anymore.

The Split Girl was ready.

I could barely see through the tears, but I watched her lurch forward.

I wanted to look away. God, I should have. But I couldn’t.

They needed to see it in my eyes—the ruin. The remorse. The truth of what I’d done. They had to know how much it tore me apart. Because these weren’t just classmates. They weren’t names on a group chat or faces in a yearbook.

They were my people. My stupid, brave, hilarious people.

And I had led them to the end.

Nails like dagger blades wrapped around both of my friends’ faces. I watched one gouge deep into Thomas’s eye, a bead of blood blooming at the edge of his sclera. His mouth froze in a rictus of pure fear.

I kept watching. Forced myself to look. At the pain I had wrought, the death I had sown.

Another hand slid beneath the skin of Ricky’s neck. The fingers moved like worms under the surface, twitching near his trachea in the last slivers of dying light. One hand cradled his jaw. His pupils were blown wide, silver coins catching the final glint of sun.

Then she dragged her fingers along the seam of his skull, braced him—and cracked the top open like a clamshell. Bone split with a wet pop. The halves parted, revealing the soft gleam of brain tissue. His eyes didn’t close. His mouth still tried to speak.

A wet mouth, barely human, latched onto Thomas’s ear. Her grinding molars tearing down, worn but cruel. Her lips peeled back in a snarl, and with a wrench of her head she tore. The cartilage gave way in a jagged bloom of flesh, a long tendon trailing with it like an unspooled white length of tine.

Both my friends had gone slack in her grip. Not unconscious. Worse. Fully present, fully aware—paralyzed. Eyes wide. Breathing quick and shallow. Caught in her arms like flies in silk.

She dragged them back.

I didn’t look away. Not until the mausoleum had gone quiet. Completely still. The only sound left was the slow, rhythmic noise of chewing.

Thin trails of blood ran down the chipped marble steps, seeping through the cracks. They shimmered in the moonlight, soft and surreal. The tears never left my face.

I passed Ricky and Thomas’s bikes on the way out. One of them still had a broken pedal from a ride last month. I looked at it and felt nothing. Just cold.

The night buzzed with crickets. A summer song. The world didn’t know what had just happened. But I did. My chest was hollow—emptied out. I wandered aimlessly, a ghost drifting through cul-de-sacs and driveways, unsure how much time passed. I didn’t feel real anymore.

When I got home, I dropped my bike on the lawn. My mom’s car was already in the driveway. The porch light was on. I unlocked the front door and slipped inside.

“Mom?” I called out. My voice cracked. Fragile. A child again.

Would I confess? Ask her to call the police? Just beg her to hold me?

No answer.

She must be in the shower.

I stepped upstairs, ready to fall into her arms. To let it all pour out. The nightmare was finally over.

I turned the corner and froze. My backpack slipped from my shoulder and hit the floor.

There, sitting in the recliner in the master bedroom, was my mom.

Her head hung from the ceiling by the scarf—just the head.

The striped black and red one my dad gave her for Mother’s Day, the one I’d found soaked and forgotten in the tub. It had been knotted around the base of her jaw, cinched so tightly it had sunk into her flesh. The weight of her body had torn everything else free. Her neck had stretched, snapped, and finally given out.

Her torso had been opened and emptied, organs pulled and placed with grotesque care. Her intestines were laid in looping, decorative arcs across the carpet like party streamers. Strips of skin had been flayed into long ribbons, tossed like crepe paper against the walls. Her limbs were arranged at odd angles, bent and crossed like the discarded pieces of a mannequin.

Her head swayed gently in the quiet. Back and forth. Eyes fixed on nothing. Mouth slightly open, as if she were still trying to say something before she had died.

The vision I’d had—it was never a warning.

It was a promise.
