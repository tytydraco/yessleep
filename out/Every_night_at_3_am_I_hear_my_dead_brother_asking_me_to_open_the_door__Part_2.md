A month ago, I opened the door. And no one was there.

No shadow, no voice, no sign of Elias. Just the hallway—silent, empty, somehow... wrong. I don’t know how to explain it. It was my home, but it felt like a fake. Like something built to make me believe I was alone.

But I wasn’t alone.

In the following days, things got worse.

The voice didn’t just come at night anymore—it started slipping into the day, catching me in quiet moments, behind walls, even through headphones. Always the same desperate plea, repeated like a broken record.

“Please. Open the door.”

I tried to ignore it, tried to convince myself it was just my mind playing tricks. But sleep became impossible. Every time I closed my eyes, I heard the whispering, the soft knocking. My appetite disappeared. Friends stopped calling because I didn’t answer. I felt myself sinking deeper into something I couldn’t control.

Eventually, I reached out to Ben, an old friend. I told him I was having trouble sleeping, and he didn’t ask too many questions. Maybe he sensed something was wrong but didn’t want to push.

On my second night at his apartment, I woke at exactly three a.m. Not because of a noise, but because of... silence. Absolute, suffocating silence. The usual hum of the fridge, the faint ticking of the clock—all gone.

Then came three knocks on the window.

Ben lives on the second floor.

I bolted upright and flicked on the lights. Outside, nothing. No branches swaying, no animals, no person. Just emptiness.

Still, I heard it again.

“Please. Open the door.”

My heart raced so fast I thought it might burst. I woke Ben, voice shaking and pale as a ghost. He didn’t believe me. Of course not. I told him everything—about Elias, the door, the diary, the sentence I found scribbled at the end: *I found a place for you.*

The next morning, Ben called someone. A few days later, I was admitted to a psychiatric clinic.

Voluntary admission. Observation. Medication. Conversations with people who wore the same empty expression: calm, understanding, distant.

At first, I thought it was helping. The voices stopped. I slept. I ate. I started to hope it was all in my head.

But three days ago, it all came back.

Three a.m.

I lay awake, eyes fixed on the ceiling, hearing something moving in the hallway outside my room. No footsteps. No banging. Just a slow, deliberate scraping sound, like a hand sliding over the wall, searching.

Then three knocks.

“Please.”

“I’m waiting.”

Since then, it’s been the same every night. They say I talk in my sleep, mumble to myself, reach out and touch the empty walls. They watch me closely now—worried I might hurt myself or someone else.

Today, the doctor came with two nurses.

“It’s better if we move you,” he said.

“Where?”

“To a safer ward.”

A locked unit.

Now I’m here.

White bed.

No doorknob.

Only a panic button.

And that feeling again—the air trembling around me. Something waiting, not for me anymore, but preparing itself.

I look at the clock.

02:59.

My hands shake as I write this, because I know what’s coming.

03:00 a.m.

Three knocks.

Not from the door.

From the wall.

Right behind my head.

Then his voice.

Broken.

Rough.

Distorted—like a tape worn thin.

“I… found… you.”
