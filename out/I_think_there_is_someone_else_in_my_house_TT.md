Ok, I might be crazy paranoid, or it is the new house doing its thing. But I think there is someone else living in my home. We checked the home all over, like even the attic but I still feel so off. You know the feeling when you feel a presence but can't explain? I keep hearing doors shutting upstairs and walking sounds and shit. ISTG I'm losing my damn mind. One day the door shut off upstairs like I heard it loud and clear. It's not like the door shuts off for AC air but more like a person shut it. One day I made sure all the doors are closed but then they shutting sound happened again. Whenever I used the bathroom I heard some dropping sounds in the vent more like a ball or marbles. I once heard a dragging sound so heavy that happens only when you drag a huge furniture or a body. You can only hear this sound when the house is dead silent means someone is being very careful about it.   
I think it all started when the ring alarm went off one day, but we couldn't see anything in the outside cameras, so we didn't think much of it. But last week the ring sensor was on the ground when we came home for outside. suspicious but we assumed it lost its sticky nature but ok. The thing is there is nothing out of the place in home. The only thing I lost is 100 bucks but I assumed it fell of somewhere but now I have my doubts.  
We live in a town house so we do hear the kids from our neighbors, but I can differentiate the sounds from them and in home. I am scared shitless, but my husband isn't giving a shit. He isn't even considering my words or my fear. He says, its nothing and I should be worried too much as it is a town house as we hear neighbors. I think I am finally losing it. He is taking it so lightly that I don't even know if i am mad at him or sorry for myself.  
Sometimes it just feels like there is someone staring at me through the vents, which I know is completely ridiculous, but I can't just brush off the feeling. I keep feeling that someone is standing behind me or just looking at me always. The thing that bothers me the most are the noises from upstairs. Now I am thinking that the 100 bucks I lost are not from outside but from inside my home. I heard all kinds of horror stories and saw docs on USA and I can't help but feel haunted.  
PS: I am originally from a different country, so we have brick walls there not this stupid carboard shit so I am maybe being over dramatic over small sounds. We are getting cameras so hopefully that would clear some anxiety.  Please let me know if you all experienced anything like this?
