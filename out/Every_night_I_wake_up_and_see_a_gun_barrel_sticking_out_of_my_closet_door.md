It starts with a creak, a motion of ancient rusty hinges that makes a quiet hissing sound as the closet door opens ever so slightly as if it were doing so of its own volition. It's not the creaking that wakes me though, instead  it's always the cold metallic click on the other side of the door, like the drawing back of a hammer that breaks my slumber and makes me shoot upright in my bed. 

Then I look at the closet and I see it. The long black barrel of what looks like some kind of revolver pointing right at me from the open crevice of the closet door. At first I am motionless, too terrified to move, and that's when I hear it. 

Click. 

I cringe and cry out in terror expecting to catch a bullet in the face, only to have fear and confusion grip me when the sound was followed by deafening silence. I sat up in my bed looking at the gleem of the moonlight against the revolver barrel in petrified terror. Hours pass by and I feel sleep tugging at my eyelids, but just as I'm about to fall asleep I hear it again.

Then it stops. The sound always comes in fives. Always keeping me from falling asleep. I stay up all night, terrified that my life could end at any moment, until the first rays of dawn begin to shine through my window and the barrel retracts back into the darkness of the closet and I hear this deep laughter from the other side of the door, and a voice like gravel taunting me as the closet door pulled shut. 


Seven days this has been going on and I haven't slept at all. My parents don't believe me. They think I'm losing my mind. I'm starting to see things that aren't there, shadows dancing in the periphery, waiting for me to let my gaurd down. 

It doesn't matter what I do or where I try to sleep, I've changed rooms multiple times , even tried to stay over at a friend's to avoid the thing in my closet,  but it always follows me, always sticking out of an open door to aim right at my face. 

Tonight I decided to fight back. 

I waited until my folks were asleep, then I crept into my dad's office and got the gun he kept hidden in his desk.  Then I went to bed, resolved to finally defend myself against whatever force was manifesting in my closet night after night. 

I waited for the creak of the door and the gleem of the barrel, only to racked with frustration when my closet remained motionless. I waited with the gun pointed at the closet door for hours, and I was finally about to succumb to exhaustion when I heard the sound that filled my body with adrenaline. 

Click.  

It sounded as if it was coming from inside the wall behind my head, I whirled around and fired into the wall in a terrified stupor, only to hear it again, this time from the wall opposite to bedroom door. 

Click.

In a fit if terror, I fired again. Punching a hole to the out side in my wall, praying that I had injured whatever this thing was, only to have my hopes dashed  when I heard it again, this time coming from the ceiling. 

Click. 

I fired upward, pure terror driving me. But the sound was relentless. The next ones sounded as if they were going off right next to my ear. 

Click. 
Click. 

I sat on my bed horrified and almost unable to move when silence washed over my room again for moments that felt like eternity when I heard the creaking hiss of my bedroom door opening and I fired right at it, survival instincts overpowering all reason. 

Then my stomach dropped when I heard my father's voice cry out in pain from the other side of the door followed by a heavy thud and my mother's terrified scream.  I tried to call out to her,  to tell her it was an accident, but she's hiding from me. 

I can hear place sirens down the street outside, someone must have called them when I started shooting. 

They are coming for me now, I now it. But before they get here I have to post the truth while I still can, so that someone out there will know I'm not insane, and that whoever this thing attacks next will be more prepared to fight back against it. 

I can still hear it laughing on the other side of the closet door.
