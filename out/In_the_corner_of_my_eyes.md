I'll get right into it. I know you would like some context and backstory, but I just can't shake it. Why is it always in the corner of my eyes?

Why is it that when I walk around my apartment and turn a corner, it's just off to my side?   
Or when I walk back to my desk, looking into my darkened bedroom, I know it's there.

How come it's always when I'm alone? Are you too afraid to show up when my partner is present? 

As I'm writing this on my desk, facing the wall - I know you're there in the corner of my eye.   
But as soon as I shift my gaze from the screen to the doorway, you're not there anymore.

We've all felt that sensation of being watched, but I don't get that from you.   
My hands are ice cold, probably from the ventilation on my wall. But my back is warm, as if being embraced.

It's always the same, isn't it? I wake up in the middle of the night - I'll look towards my window, and there you are. Or I'll look at my door, and I see you. But with a blink, you're gone again. An ever-dark figure, not mean or angry. Just existing.

As a child, I never had to check under my bed or ask my parents to do it. But now I'm afraid to even look under there. What if I finally see you? I have to muster up my courage to check my closet doors, and you can be damn sure I keep the lights on when I check.

But I guess you've made me change, I always instinctively turn on the lights when I enter a room- even if its bright outside. When I sit down in a room, I always make sure I have full view of any openings or windows. 

It feels weird - you're watching me, and I'm watching you. I know I can hear you sometimes, getting a glass of water in the middle of the night. Dropping a small object on the ground, or moving past my closed bedroom door. The lights from my kitchen always give you away; I can see the light shining through the keyhole gets blocked.

You've been with me for months now, maybe even years. I've grown almost comfortable with our strange arrangement - you in the shadows, me pretending not to notice.  
  
It's almost funny, how normal this has become. This dance of avoidance we do. But yesterday something changed. As I had grown accustomed to always looking over my partner's shoulders during dinner - I couldn't help notice that he too has started to do the same. 

The worst part? When our eyes met across the table, we both knew. 

Looking back at it now, I guess there were signs I missed. Like how he would freeze mid sentence, or how his eyes would be fixed on something behind me. I guess that also would explain why we both keep the light on in the bathroom at night.
