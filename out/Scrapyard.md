Your brother is an artist. A sculptor, technically. But not the kind that makes things you want to spend any time looking at. His work is "abstract." Big twisted things with points and swirls and sticking-out pieces that promise to snag clothing and skin. Usually made from trash. Metal scrap. You are no stranger to calls from the scrapyard, the landfill, construction sites– places he can be found looting from again and again.

People call you instead of the cops because your town is tiny. No one wants to fuck with the famous author's weird son. Maybe if Dad wasn't what put the town on the map to begin with, things would be different. Maybe they'd be better.

He called you half an hour ago from the scrapyard. He has been caught again. Will you come get him?

Sensing the tension across the room, where your husband sits on the couch, you sigh and answer the only way you really can.

“Yeah. I’m on my way.”

Your brother seems to think of this as a pleasant routine. Your husband, arms crossed, watching you pull your boots on, thinks the whole thing is inherently ridiculous and pathologically selfish on your brother's part.

"This isn't our problem. You're his brother, not his parent."

"I'll be back soon," you say, threading your arms into your down coat. "It's not a big deal."

Your husband turns away from your kiss.

You let the car heat up for a while. As the windows defrost, they reveal the woods outside, black against the setting sun. Real estate is still cheap out here in the boonies, but it won't be forever. A new housing development five miles down the highway hints at what's to come.

The only lights you pass on the way to the scrapyard are set far into the trees. Tiny, falling-down homes owned by people with no interest in or capital for improvement.

A mile away from the scrapyard, the night sky begins to lighten, as if time is reversing. As you make the turn into the lot, you have to squint against the canopy of halogens.

The scrapyard is small but sprawling. Husks of refrigerators and the empty shells of cars stick out from piles of twisted metal and dirt. Some of your brother's sculptures are indistinguishable from these organic heaps.

A cloud of insects foams around the porch light as you mount the trailer steps and enter the front office.

The wiry guy behind the desk -- a piece of sheet metal propped on cinder blocks -- stands to greet you.

"Harvey not in today?" you ask.

"Nope," he replies, shaking your outstretched hand, bent over like a pipe cleaner. "Called in sick. I've been here since ten this morning."

"Oof, that's awful. Hopefully you get to go home soon."

The attendant shrugs.

Your brother gets to his feet, giving you a lackadaisical smile, like this is all part of a beloved routine.

"Sorry you had to call," you continue pointedly. "I told Harvey he can trespass him any time he wants."

"No worries. He told us what to do if Brian shows up. Gotta be nice to the folks with stuff goin’ on."

Many people are under the impression that Brian is mentally ill. This is a reasonable assumption to make of someone who spends his time gluing trash together, but he's not. Brian just prefers what's in his head to what's outside it. He always has.

"Not like he can take much, anyway," the attendant continues. "Copper's all locked up for like a year now."

"Well, tell him I said thanks, and I hope he feels better."

"Will do."

You guide Brian out the door with a firm hand on his shoulder. He's taller than you -- older, too -- but it's never felt that way.

"Thanks, again."

"You folks have a good night."

Brian walks with his hands in his suspiciously bulging pockets. He stares at the piles of metal and pauses by the twisted hulk of a small sedan.

"Wouldn't it be great if I could take one of these? There's so much you can do with a big frame like this."

You pull him forward by the arm, digging your fingers in.

"Ouch, dude," he says cheerfully.

You shove him into the back seat. He makes a quip about being demoted.

"You good?" he asks you as you slam your seatbelt buckle into its housing.

"No, not really," you reply, looking over your shoulder and reversing into a turn.

"Why?"

"You know I have a life, right? That I don't exist to serve you?"

"I'm sorry," your brother replies, nonplussed.

In the rearview, his head lowers as he inspects his haul.

"I have a LIFE. I'm sick of this shit. I'm telling Harvey to trespass you if he sees you there again. I'm telling EVERYONE to trespass you. I am SICK OF THIS SHIT."

Brian turns his eyes up at you but, wisely, doesn't open his mouth again. He just sits there and plays with his toys like a child.

His house is the last on a long dirt road and is easily identifiable in the worst way. Junk metal glitters in the front yard, like a small plane crashed into the ten square feet of crispy brown lawn and disintegrated. The mangey roof sheds shingles. The garage, abandoned, is half-collapsed and leaning. If he had actual neighbors, this place would have been condemned years ago. As it is, he's just an eyesore. A directional waypoint. If you've hit the hillbilly house, you've gone too far.

You park on the street. You've lost enough tires to the nails and screws tossed carelessly into what passes for his driveway.

Brian gets out and knocks on your window. You lower it but don't look at him.

"Can I show you what I've been doing?"

You light up with a surge of anger that fades just as quickly. You repeat the mantra your mom used to say whenever the two of you fought as kids:

Don't ever go to bed angry. You never know when you'll see each other again.

So you nod and roll up the window and kill the engine and follow your brother up his shitty driveway and into his shitty house. Spaces bleeding together, every surface used indiscriminately. He turns on lights that put out a weak nicotine glow and the two of you walk over empty bags, papers, pieces of scrap.

"For fuck's sake, it's like a bomb went off in here."

"I gotta clean here soon," Brian dismisses, waving his hand. "But here, look. Check this out."

He opens the last door on the left and ushers you into what was once the spare bedroom.

Twisted metal forms loom everywhere, shoved into any available space around the antique flip-top children's desk braced against the far wall. The eye can barely make sense of the visual cacophony. Wrenches and bolts and screws and an ancient soldering iron sitting on a rolling laptop stand and spools of solder and more papers and even more empty fast food bags. Who knows what kind of insect life is thriving here.

Brian weaves between the statues -- organic tangles, loops of thick metal, headlight housings, electrical cables, all smashed together the frozen second of detonation -- and picks up a small object from somewhere in the clutter. He holds it tenderly in his palms, like a small animal.

He hands it to you. You gingerly accept it. It's a crudely made hollow cube made of solid, hand-smithed pieces of metal. Only one panel of the square is solid, and it is suspiciously copper-colored.

"What metal is this?" you ask, running your finger along it.

He ignores you. "Look inside."

“Can I not?”

“No, come on! Look!”

You could strangle him. But you do as instructed.

The inside of the cube is empty. The back panel is blank.

"Nice," you offer lamely.

Brian grins. "Keep looking. Pay attention to the corners."

"Dude, I want to go home."

"No, no, just look again! Look at the corners!"

He's selfish, and he always has been. He doesn't care that your husband has been waiting for over an hour now. It never crosses his mind that you might have priorities that aren't him and his shitty art.

You look again. Nothing. It’s just metal.

Except.

You look closer.

There’s something weird about the top left corner.

You turn the cube this way and that.

Something is definitely off.

You follow the lines and discover something very strange.

"How do you have the sides overlapping like that?"

Brian's grin broadens. "Doesn't make sense does it?"

You follow the lines again and again. It reminds you of that triangle optical illusion, where all the angles are impossible. Except this is different. This isn't a copy of any illusion you’ve ever seen. Every time you follow a beam, you feel a sort of slipping, an almost painful flinch, and when it's over, the lines have changed. You're sure of it. You test it over and over until your eyes hurt, like you've been staring into a bright light. In fact, when you pull away, you're left with an afterimage, and even the afterimage stings something in the center of your head.

You hand the cube back a little too roughly.

"Careful! For fuck's sake!" Brian chastises, cradling his bizarre creation.

"How did you do that?"

His face lights up with a proud smile. "You wouldn't believe me if I told you."

Your phone buzzes in your pocket. A text from Andrew:

Dinner's cold. I'm going to bed.

"I’m leaving. Andrew’s pissed."

For the first time that evening, Brian seems genuinely remorseful.

"Sorry. I really didn't know it was that big of a deal."

"It absolutely is."

"I can try and do it less, if that helps."

You don't have the time or energy for a single other second of your brother.

Brian stands in his doorway, waving as you leave. Still cradling the cube.

The drive home sucks. You use Siri to apologize over and over, but Andrew never responds.

The house is dark when you pull in. He left your dinner on the table. It's your favorite, and it is, in fact, stone cold. You eat it standing at the kitchen counter. You clean all the dishes by hand and put them in the rack to dry. Tomorrow, you'll get Andrew a chicken burger and some coffee. You'll try to make it up to him. You start up the stairs to the bedroom.

But, suddenly, you're not sure you’re actually tired. Could you actually sleep right now, even if you tried? It might be better to watch something. Get sleepy that way.

You lie down on the couch and turn on a movie. You turn it up a little. The house feels oppressively quiet tonight.
