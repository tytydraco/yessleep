Clouds flew by as I looked up to the sunny sky. Just a few wispy clouds swirled, as birds chirped. I was feeling gloomy, I sat by an oak tree as I sighed. Thoughts of my sister, who was achieving amazing things, getting good grades, being quite popular compared to me ran in. Today was her graduation, but I didn’t attend. I always resented her for always being better than me. I saw a big bird fly, and I begun to felt bitter. A stupid bird could achieve things more than me, it reminded me of my stupid sister. My thoughts paused as I heard a tweet. I look up and see a chick on an oak wood tree, preparing itself to fly. I saw a small bird jump up and try to spread its wings. It jumped up but couldn’t leap, it tried again before falling into the grass. I quickly picked it up and checked if it was fine. It looked okay, this small robin I held, chirped before I climbed the tree and placed it back onto the branch. I went down and loomed back at it. It made a few hops and tried to spread its wings before making one whole circle around the tree. I felt a bit of better when I saw the bird succeeding as it flew, as before it failed before achieving its goal. I begun to think about my bitter thoughts about my sister and that big bird I saw earlier, and begun to feel a bit sad. That bird was once a chick who couldn’t fly, but it was because of practice it could soar the skies. I begun to think about my sister, she must’ve worked hard to achieve her goals. I felt horrible for not attending her graduation, she did her very best to get that certificate. I got up and dusted my dress, and I looked back up to the small bird who hopped onto the tree. I then made my way to the school, to get my seat at her ceremony.  
When I entered, people were sobbing as the spotlight was on her, like always. There were many people who wanted to hold her hand, my parents were crying her name out. People made way for me, her sister to hold her. I asked if I could be by myself first, they understood and quickly left. I kissed her forehead. Whispering my apologies in her ear, as she laid in her casket. Her graduation hat looked beautiful on her, it’s too bad she’s dead. I’m sure she’d looks beautiful if she was all alive with her dress and hat. The teachers praised her for her efforts and dedication, telling about how she didn’t deserve to get killed. I let out a forced sigh before letting a small smile come out. “She was a very bright person” I said as I forced some tears out. I caressed my hand on her cheek, and softly said to her “Sorry, but it’s my turn to be the better sister.” Before I returned to my seat as the casket closed.
