There’s a point in any relationship with one’s in-laws that the dead come back to life, and you’re left wondering whether the gun in your fiancée’s hands is enough to double-kill the man you were just forced into throat-stabbing.

At least that’s what I told myself. Deep down, I knew I was lying. Hell, I knew I was lying at whatever very shallow analogue contrasts with not being “deep down.”

[Anyway, the “dead” man’s grimy hands pressed against the floor until he was looking up at me](https://redd.it/1717lr2), his eyes now grayish white, the poker still protruding from the fleshy wound in his throat. It was gross, if I’m being honest; blood covered his dirty skin flaps, looking like someone had dropped an uncooked pizza mid-spin and ripped the dough beneath the sauce. 

On top of being gross, it was horrifying and *odd*. His face had changed in just a few minutes, resulting in a shrunken nose, raised upper lip, and shriveled ears. His hands had become gnarled and hairy, and his t-shirt was tearing now that his human biceps had been replaced with some sort of cartoon-dimension muscles.

“Darn it,” I lamented.

“Joseph, please come here behind me,” Lacey whispered as the man got shakily to his feet. 

“Lacey, darling, I would really like it if you told me what was going on,” I answered, keeping my position between her and the man. 

“What’s it look like?” she asked in a barely audible voice.

“Um – it *looks* like your father tricked me into fighting some sort of poor, cursed man who was waiting to be killed and then made un-dead. Then, after shedding his mortal coil, it seems that he has arisen, phoenix-like, as some sort of a were-lion who has both reason to hate me and a fireplace poker at his disposal.”

“Yes.”

“I was hoping you’d say ‘no’.”

“I’m so sorry, Joseph.” Her voice sounded like fragile glass, ready to break.

“Lacey?”

“Yes?”

“Your father’s a dick.” 

The were-lion’s roar silenced me, shaking the room so violently that the ceiling’s semi-coagulated blood droplets shook free in a fine spray.

“Listen, Joseph, this gun has tungsten bullets, which are the only things that can-”

The grimy lion man cut her off. He placed his left palm on my shoulder and threw me to the floor with all the effort and grace of a man wiping his own ass, then swung the poker with his right hand to bat the pistol from Lacey’s grip. It skidded and spun across the room, stopping in a pool of the man’s blood.

Movies love to show badass heroes getting knocked to the ground and bouncing right back up as though their veins pump Viagra, but the reality of getting your ass beat is very different. It turns out that that shit hurts, and I would have just curled in to a ball of ouch if it weren’t for Lacey’s scream. 

The were-lion had her trapped; she was pressed against the wall with his arms pinned on either side of her head. His fingers were digging through the plaster. 

Love is a funny thing. We can know something in our heads but feel the complete opposite with our hearts and genitals. The latter inevitably wins, but the former is almost always right.

So that’s how I found myself racing across the room and leaping onto the were-lion’s dirty, furry back with my arms wrapped around his forehead. I grabbed his arms, which had the same feel and success value as trying to uproot a skyscraper. 

But he did turn away from my fiancée. 

I squeezed his head tighter, hoping that I might be able to find a weak spot. 

I did not. 

He turned around and wrapped his arms around my waist, squeezing me tighter than I thought possible. Panic crept into my core as I tried and failed to breathe; the thing had pulled me against his torso so tightly that I my lungs couldn’t expand.

I looked for Lacey, silently pleading that she would run. 

But she had only gotten closer. 

“Move, Joseph!”

I would have told her that I couldn’t, but that would have involved moving.

She rolled her eyes and batted my arm aside, which exposed his neck. Then she darted her hand forward, jamming her fingers into the bottom of his throat.

We collapsed. I fell on my left side, which was still in pain from the earlier falling. Then the were-lion fell on my left side, which was still hurting from a half-second prior. Both of us rolled in agony as she stalked across the room to retrieve the gun. 

The were-lion recovered quickly. I did not. 

So I was helpless to stop him as he leapt to his feet and snarled at Lacey. She turned to face him just as he jumped the twenty feet between them, pulling the trigger and dropping him to the ground at her feet. 

For a moment, we shared eerie quiet.

Then Frank opened the door and burst inside like a gelatinous bowling ball, yanking me to a standing position with a lighting storm of pain up and down my left side. 

“Dad!” Lacey snapped. “Be careful! You’ve put him through enough already!”

“Nothin’ wrong with a little bruising after a good time, am I right, Joe?” he laughed, his red face and bristly white mustache inches from my cheek as he supported my weight. He wove laughing and wheezing together before settling on phlegmy coughs.

“I…” I heaved, “feel that I am owed an explanation.”

Lacey crossed her arms in frustration, still clutching the bloody pistol, and damn if I didn’t fall in love with her a little bit more in that moment. “Dad?”

Frank propped me against the wall, where I remained in a leaning position. When he spoke, his voice was much softer. “Joe, we’ve been keeping a secret from you.”

“You mean the lion?”

“Yes, that’s what I’m talking about.” He smiled. “I was watching the whole time, you know. Let me tell you, Joe-Joe, a man is defined by what he does when he has to make a *choice.* You could have left Lacey and gone for the gun, like any sensible person, but that’s just not who you *are*.” His grin cracked wider. “A man who would abandon all sense to get closer to touching my daughter is the only type of man I want in this family.” He licked his lips and stroked my cheek.

“DAD!”

He stepped away, but the unpleasant chills remained. 

I gazed at Lacey. “Well that was fun. Didn’t you say something about leaving?”

She stared back with the saddest look. “Joseph, I – I’m so sorry.”

The chills settled in my colon. “Sorry about what happened, but happy that it’s over?” I asked in a hopeful voice.

She walked to where I stood and rested her hand on my cheek. I liked that much better than her father’s sausage fingers. “It’s been a family secret for 110 years, Joseph. I’m so, so sorry that I couldn’t tell you earlier.”

She and her father exchanged glances before turning back to me. “I hope you realize by now that this was test,” Lacey continued. “I could have killed him at any time. And even though you weren’t able to help me, we know now that you’re *willing*, which is the most important thing.”

“A noble man can learn practicality, but it rarely flows the other way,” Frank added. 

I looked back and forth between them, trying to guess the worst thing they could possibly say.

“There’s a problem,” Lacey explained. “Too many of them have broken through, and we can’t [keep them out on our own](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).”
