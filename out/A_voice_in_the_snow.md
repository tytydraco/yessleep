I’m an office worker in my mid thirties working in the heart of a city. My whole life has been surrounded by skyscrapers, businesses and angry people. To be raised in such an environment can be almost smothering. Lately I'd been really into videos of people hiking deep into the mountains or surviving in the wilderness. It was so much different than what I was used to and almost felt like a different world. The trees and wide open spaces looked so freeing.

Everyone in the videos looked so happy and in touch with themselves. It got to the point where I started thinking of planning a trip myself. It was a bit intimidating at first, but the more I saw the more hooked I was. The thought of breathing in that fresh mountain air and seeing once in a lifetime sites was so tempting. So much so that I began saving money. I powered through an entire year of work and made just what I needed. Next I bought plenty of supplies and a plane ticket. What was once a thought was now about to happen. For the first time in my life I'd leave the city and see mother nature up close. The flight filled me with so much excitement. I wanted to build a fire and catch fish; use a compass to find my way on unfamiliar paths. To be one with nature and get a break from the hustle and bustle.

Once I arrived, you could see snow capped mountains from the airport. Trees took the place of skyscrapers and busy intersections. This was it, this was what I’d needed for so long now. I wasted no time in dumping my luggage off at the hotel. Then I took a cab to the most popular mountain trail. During this time of year, snow covered the ground. But this was all the better for me, as it made nature’s beauty look even more breathtaking. After a quick check of my loadout, I was ready for my hike. The air smelled so clean; I felt the crunch of snow with every step I took. A light wind was blowing, causing the trees to sway ever so slightly. It was just as I had imagined, so peaceful and serene. I could easily go off the grid and stay here forever. Maybe living off the land wouldn’t be that hard. After a short time, the snowfall became heavier. Walking became more difficult, as I had to take larger steps. But this was only a minor setback; one I didn’t plan to let stop me.

Moving along, I had to admit that I was getting out of breath. All my years in a cubicle hadn’t prepared me for this. I checked my compass to make sure I was heading in the right direction. I could hear some rustling in the nearby woods. Figuring it was a rabbit or some other critter, I ignored it. After an hour passed, I sat atop a boulder and took a break. I packed some canned soup and granola bars to regain energy. While snacking, it was cool to see that I had made it this far. The sights were to die for and I was starting to feel like a survivalist. Over time however, the snow fell even faster than before. I didn’t think to watch the weather due to all of my excitement. But regardless this was my dream trip; something I’d planned for an entire year. A little snow wasn’t going to slow me down. And the end of the trail wasn’t far from here.

But the darn snow kept coming; with a powerful and icy wind blasting me from all sides. It didn’t take long for me to realize that I was caught in a blizzard. I’ll admit that I hadn’t watched many videos on what to do in this situation. But the ability to remain calm and never give up was always important. With such powerful winds, I could hardly keep my eyes open. So I grabbed a pair of goggles from my bag and put them on. Unfortunately, I could barely see past a few feet in front of me. Between that and the battering winds, I was getting a little worried. I assumed I was on the right path, but how could I be certain? For all I knew, I could’ve been seconds away from walking off a cliff. But just then, something strange happened. I heard a voice calling my name from within the snow.

I couldn’t see who it was, but the voice was so clear…I knew it. It was my mother’s voice, steadily calling out to me. Under normal circumstances, you could say that it was safe to approach. But that wouldn’t be the case seeing as how my mother had been dead for ten years. Thinking I might have been hallucinating, I gave myself a hard slap in the face. But the voice kept calling out to me; louder than before. Call it a gut feeling, but I felt it wouldn’t be wise to approach. Something just seemed off, so I tried to ignore it. As I continued, it was so cold the lens of my goggles started to freeze over. I couldn’t see where I was going and I didn’t know who was following me. All I knew was that I needed to get out of these woods and into some shelter. Minute by minute the snow kept getting worse, at this point it was up to my knees. Meanwhile that voice kept saying my name over and over. It also got closer, now right in my ear. That soft tone of my mothers i missed so much. It was nearly identical, but I knew it wasn’t her. No matter how bad I wanted too, I didn’t acknowledge it. Just then, I felt two hands shove me from behind.

I fell…I fell for so long, afterwards everything went black. I was sure this was the end; no one would ever find me buried under a ton of snow. It’s ironic, all I wanted was to see nature up close. And now I was going to die here. Or so I thought, I don’t know how long I was out. But I remember waking up to a bright light in my face. I thought it might be heaven, but then I’d hear a new voice. It was a man trying to wake me, he had on hiking gear and a thick orange jacket. I slowly came too and he explained the situation. He said the cameras caught me starting my trek just before a big blizzard. When they didn’t see me come out they got worried. To my surprise, the man said I’d been missing for two days. That I had fallen from a cliff and hypothermia was setting in. In the hospital, some policemen asked for my story. I told them everything, especially about that strange voice. While the younger cop didn’t seem phased, it was a different story for the older one.

He looked at me with big eyes and a worried expression. He asked me if I was certain of what I’d heard, I assured him I was. He told me those woods were home to a certain legend. A being from Native American folklore called a skinwalker. He explained that they were once witch doctors who sold their souls for immortality. With the ability to shapeshift into just about anything, they are impossible to spot. They lurk deep in the woods and prey on weary travelers like myself. The man had a deep fear in his voice while speaking; he said they were all over this area. And I wasn’t the first person to have run-ins with them. The officer even went as far as saying his niece had been kidnapped by one and was never found. I, on the other hand, have never believed in silly superstitions like these. I thanked him for his concern and told him I wouldn’t go back out there alone.

Of course this was a lie, I’d been planning this trip for forever. I wasn’t going to let some old campfire story keep me out of those woods. And I’m sure the voice I heard was just my own survival instincts kicking in. In fact, once some of the snow melted; I fully intended on going back. With a little more planning; I’m sure this will be a safe and unforgettable hike. After all, there’s no such thing as monsters.
