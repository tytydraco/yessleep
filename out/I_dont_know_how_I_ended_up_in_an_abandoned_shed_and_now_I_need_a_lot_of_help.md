**Three sleepless nights in total.**

The rotten smell of the bodies around me was killing me. I fought for two whole days trying to escape this place, but nothing worked.

It was impossible to break the windows; the wood was nailed down, deliberately preventing me from leaving. I don't even know how I got here. I remember being thirsty; it must have been late at night because even the neighborhood dogs had stopped barking. I also remember the footsteps. A security guard, one of those who patrol the streets at night with a useless baton, heard me and wanted to help.

Poor guy. The sound of his heavy body hitting the ground was traumatizing. He didn't even have time to see me. His warm blood, despite his body being cold due to the chilly weather, formed a puddle beneath my previously clean shoes… Of course, I panicked.

Fear took over, and I ran. I felt so cowardly because I had unintentionally led the man into that situation. The man who probably had a family, a wife, and surely friends waiting for him next Saturday to have a beer at one of those seedy bars around here.

I fled, ran as fast as I could inside. I couldn’t leave, of course not. It was obvious that something was waiting for me outside; the fear was consuming me more and more. I was prey, being toyed with. Something wanted to end me but was having fun first. You know when you go to those fancy restaurants that, instead of an appetizer, offer a show before serving the meal? Well, I was the show.

When dawn broke, a young couple entered through another door, this one made of iron. So heavy, the guy was too skinny, I don’t know how he opened it. I think because of me, they lost such a beautiful future together…

First, the girl fell dead. Blood poured from her mouth, bubbling. It was too late for the guy when he realized… The cut on his throat was fatal. There wasn’t enough time to see where it came from, these two were even more tragic than the poor guard, God rest their souls…

The movement was quick, clever, very well thought out. From where I was, the view was extremely graphic. A horror! The blood of the two bathed the old, moldy walls of that abandoned warehouse. Unfortunately, it’s not a good place for dating.

I needed to give the three of them something dignified, right? A human being is always empathetic. I hid all day, unable to bear knowing that outside it was bright enough for something to see me, even though it was so dark inside.

As soon as night fell, I pulled the guard by his feet. It wasn’t that hard; the body was heavy, but the gym gave me some muscle mass, despite being just a little girl, I managed to pull a bit.

I piled the couple with their heads on the guard’s belly. They seemed to be sleeping, all three of them. That was sadistic, for sure. The smell of blood closed my throat. I tried to cover my nose with my hand, but what was the point? My hands were covered in dark red.

When I thought maybe I could ask for some help, I shouted to a woman passing outside. I saw her through the crack in the window. The warehouse had been abandoned for ages, but it was behind a park, so it wasn’t unusual for someone to wander through the area on weekends, like I did.

“Please, help me, please.” My scream was guttural. I couldn’t hold back the tears when, finally, someone appeared for me.

In the end, it was useless.

She was also a threat.

I’m sure she also came to harm me. I waited for her to open the first door and close it.

“Hello? I heard you asking for help.” She played the innocent. Nice, right? If I didn’t know her intentions.

I waited for her to close the door and turn forward. Fool.

I raised the ax with all the strength I could muster and pinned her body to the wall with it. The sharp iron struck her neck directly, causing her head to slump to the left. The blood that gushed out seemed different from the other deaths.

Those I killed because someone wanted to harm them too, I just spared them, helped poor creatures escape a horrid world.

But her, she deserved it.

When her body fell to the ground, I waited for her to move. After all, she was a demon. But she didn’t move, the bitch didn’t move a single muscle.

I kicked her head until she woke up, but nothing, absolutely nothing.

I wept copiously as I ran to the three I had saved. Lying there, the four of us. I hugged them.

“I saved us, see? We’re safe.”

I stayed like that until, finally, someone came to save me.

I gripped the ax handle tightly when I heard the lock turn.
