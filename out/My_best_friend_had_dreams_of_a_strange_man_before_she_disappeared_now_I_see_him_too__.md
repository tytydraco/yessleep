Let’s get this over with, I’m Morgan and I’m looking for help. Yesterday my best friend Lillian disappeared, her parents think she just ran away from home. I think they’re just coping and I don’t believe it for a second. Not only did she not talk to me about this at all she recently started confining in me about some of her recent dreams. Some were creepy, sure but the night she disappeared I had one too, and here it is.



I was standing right on the edge of the woods looking at Lillian's house. I could see her window on the second floor through a couple trees, as I focused on her window a black figure with a cane appeared below. Not sure where he came from, if he walked out of the woods or just appeared. He put down his cane and stretched out his arms towards the window, he stood like this for a couple seconds, then with what seemed like a deep sigh of relief he breathed and his arms started to stretch and crack. I had broken my arm once in middle school and it sounded like that, bones snapping, ligaments ripping as his arms stretched toward her window. At this point I was terrified beyond belief, I tried to scream for someone to help but I yelled and nothing came out. I watched in horror as the black figure continued to stretch out its arms with awful sounds. Now that I think about it, it sounds like when dry trees sway in the wind, almost like they are talking to each other. The figure opened Lillian’s window with its now very long arms and proceeded to climb inside. I would try to run but my body refused to move. All I could do was stand and watch as this being picked up my friend and carried her out the window. Once it got to the ground it put her down, grabbed her by the back of her shirt collar and started to drag her toward me. While dragging my friend it walked directly by me, it remained dark as it passed but I got a good look at Lillian who seemed to still be sleeping. Its arms were so long that the elbow was now to the ground as it dragged her. I tried to reach out but the only thing my body would do is stand and watch as this thing dragged my best friend deeper into the woods.

  


As soon as I woke up I was terrified but as I soaked in my surroundings, my warm bed, the sun coming in from the window, I realized where I was and the nightmare began to fade much like any other. I immediately wrote down what happened in my dream and all the specifics I could remember. I did this to talk to Lillian about it since she was also having dreams of a dark figured man as well. Lillian and I would usually walk to school together, it’s close and her house is right on the way there. However yesterday when I did so I saw police surrounding the house, when I ran over to ask what happened Lillian’s mother told me she was missing. I immediately remembered my dream and ran to the back of the house. Her window was open. 



At this point I was in mania, she could have just left the window open right? The weather is fine enough for that! Maybe she just met a boy I didn’t know about and ran away with him! She could have done that, that must be why the window is open! The boy threw rocks at it to get her attention… Anything to not think of the nightmare I had that night before. Even with all the convincing of myself, this is no 80’s movie. No kid with 3 layers of pomade in his hair making him look like a JOJO’s character threw rocks at my best friend's window and whisked her away on a motorcycle. At least, without her telling me.



School was canceled but before the day ended I asked her parents if I could take a look at her room, I had finally stopped crying and decided to pick up the courage before my eyes turned back into water balloons and burst into tears. Jullie (Lillian’s mom) gave permission and I walked up the stairs to her room, her blanket was tossed aside and nothing looked too out of place. By her bed was a journal, I picked it up and flipped through the pages. It was full of drawings and dreams she had of the dark figured man, thing, I had seen it before when she talked to me about it but there is definitely some new stuff. I stuck it in the top of my pants under my shirt, said goodbye to Jullie and ran back home with it in hand. 



Once home I put the book down and started reading from the beginning, it seems most of her dreams started out “mostly” normal. She would be at home with her family when she would see something from the corner of her eye, out the window there would be a dark figure. Apparently this happened for quite awhile, a month or two, these I remember, she told me about them a few times. Some guy was watching her in her dreams. However as weeks went on this figure started to get closer and closer, almost inching his way towards her everytime she went to sleep. Although VERY scary, she always remarked that when she awoke the feeling of dread or fear simply went away. Like all other dreams the moment you wake up a flash bang of reality slaps you across the face. In a journal entry two days before she disappeared she said something different happened, she had a lucid dream, that one I will transcribe here. 



May 14 2024



I lifted my eyes and looked around to see a starry sky with endless grassy fields. I jumped and realized that I could actually float, the harder I focused I would float higher and higher. I started jumping and floating around this gorgeous place then I laid down and looked at the stars. That’s when I saw him, he was still there, standing in the sky, looking down at me. First I was scared but decided screw this, I’m done. I’m in control of this dream. I ketchuped my courage and that’s when I imagined I had rocket boots and two AR-15s, errmm yeah I’m pretty epic. I flew up to him and a staircase appeared, I slowly started to ascend the staircase and he just looked down on me, silent. I stopped three steps away, he was much larger than I thought. A deep fear started to creep over my heart as he started to get larger, I couldn’t move. Everything around me went dark, his eyes were blacker than black, I don't know how else to explain it. I was now surrounded by darkness and I could feed his gaze as his eyes grew around me. It was the most lonely feeling I have ever felt. A large crack started to form like a mouth, it opened and he started to cover me with it.. I don’t feel good, I don’t think I am going to go to school today. 



Morgan again, I would like to mention, no she did not go to school for two days before she disappeared. I talked to her lightly online but not much, she seemed pretty ill. And before anyone asks, yes, she did write that, that is her humor. In her Journal she writes on two pages every day, first page is her dream, second is her day. The days and dream she had when she was sick are gone, ripped out. The last thing that she wrote that I have is what I shared. Maybe the police took the last entries? But if they did, why wouldn’t they take the whole book? I don’t know, but last night something happened. I had another dream.



I was standing in a small dark room, there was a door, at least, I could feel a door knob but it wouldn’t open. I looked down and there was a small amount of light leaking from the other side.  I could hear something on the other end, so I spoke out. 



“Hello?” I whispered



Silence was all that replied 



“I-is someone there”



“Can anyone hear me”



I looked down and saw that the light that was originally full had a shadow, someone was on the other side. I didn’t know what or if it was that thing but I decided to ask it some questions if it was.



“Wha-what did you do with Lillian?”



“Did you eat her? Where is she!?”



Nothing replied, no noises, nothing. 



“Hello! I know you’re there! Where is Lillian! Tell me!.....



After a few moments of silence, the door opened, the dark figure was about 20ft away and walking closer.



I woke up in a cold sweat, but again, the fear quickly evaded me as I realized where I was. This next part is what has really scared me about last night. I don’t know where to turn because of it. I don’t want to tell my dad because he will just want to send me to a psychiatrist and I'm no schizo. After my dream I decided to take a shower to rinse the night terror sweat off myself. We had a semi transparent shower curtain, and when scrubbing my scalp I thought I heard something. A “hello”, I immediately froze, a second later there was a very audible “yes” It sounded like a deep voice whispering. Not like a normal whisper, almost like there was barely any air going through someone's vocal cords. I quickly scrubbed the water from my eyes and from the semi clear curtain I could see a dark figure standing in the corner of the bathroom. I froze in terror.



“Yes….” it spoke again then was quiet for a while, standing, staring into the shower.



“Yes…” it said once again, then stopped.



At this point I was terrified but also fed up. This thing is haunting my dreams, my life, and may have killed my best friend. Although the fear was overwhelming, my anger was bubbling as all it did was stand and stare. What kind of a perv is this thing anyway popping up in the bathroom while me a MINOR is in the shower. I’m pretty sure that’s a felony even if I’m only a year away from being able to buy scratch offs at a gas station. All of this is obviously nonsense but I needed to work myself up over something. After several minutes of silence I ripped the curtain to the side revealing the being. It was a black towel. I finished my shower with the curtain open, no way was I closing that again. I could be losing my mind right now. But I am positive that towel had two feet and a head when the curtain was closed. 



If anyone has had any similar experiences, please share, I am desperately looking for answers.
