In Obedient Grove, silence isn’t just the lack of sound—it’s a way of life, a kind of ritual, almost. It lingers in the air, in the way our neighbors nod rather than greet, in the steady tolling of the clock tower. Evelyn and I, we’ve grown accustomed to it. After all, in a place like this, silence can be comforting. Or, at least, that’s what I’ve always thought.

These days, our *quiet* is occasionally softened by the sound of Timmy’s laughter, and, if I close my eyes, I can almost pretend everything is as it was. He doesn’t understand, not fully. To him, this is just a visit to Grandma and Grandpa’s, a long one, perhaps, but temporary. He talks about his mother and father as if they’re right down the road, as if any day now they’ll walk through the door. Evelyn and I haven’t found the strength to correct him, to tell him that he’s here with us for good. Instead, we let him keep his illusions, because a part of me wishes I could still believe it myself.

In the morning, I watched Evelyn braid his hair into cornrows, her hands moving carefully. I think about it now, of Evelyn *smiling* as she sends him off to school with a sandwich and a small treat, watching him skip down the driveway. I know she worries, lingering at the door until he’s out of sight, fearing that, like his parents, he might simply disappear if we don’t watch him close enough. Each night, I read him the same stories we used to read to our daughter, and he falls asleep with his little hand tucked into mine. He’s the last bit of her we have, and I don’t think either of us would survive losing him, too.

The whole town seems to sense it, our need for this fragile new *normal*. The neighbors nod from their porches but rarely speak, lawns are pristine, and at night, the streetlamps all flicker on in perfect unison, a soft, reliable glow against the dark. Obedient Grove cocoons us, as if trying to keep us safe in its quiet embrace.

There’s a peculiar stillness to this place, something deeper than grief, something unspoken. It presses in, as though the town is watching us, biding its time.

That first night was the first time in a long while that I felt uneasy in my own home. It’s difficult to explain; it sounds almost foolish as I write it down, but the silence here, the stillness—it was different. There was a weight to it, a quiet that pressed down like a presence, as if something else had settled into the house with us.

It started small, just faint noises—a creak on the stairs, the thud of something dropping in the attic, footsteps. Old houses have a way of making their own sounds, so Evelyn and I brushed it off as our imaginations running wild. Still, when I checked on Timmy, I found myself hesitating by his door, lingering just long enough to hear the soft, steady sound of his breathing. He was fast asleep, oblivious to the unease seeping through the walls.

But the noises didn’t stop. At one point, I could’ve sworn I heard someone—or something—whispering from the corner of the room, but when I looked, it was only shadows flickering, shifting along the wallpaper. Just a trick of the light, I told myself. But I knew that wasn’t quite true. Evelyn felt it too. I saw it in the way her hands trembled slightly as she closed the curtains, how her eyes darted to the shadows that gathered just beyond the lamplight.

We tried to sleep, to put it out of our minds, but the house refused to let us rest. There were noises—an almost rhythmic tapping along the walls, faint but insistent, and a skittering sound, as though something was crawling through the walls themselves. I remember holding my breath, straining to make sense of the sounds, my heart thudding in my chest. I don’t remember feeling this way since *the accident*—this feeling of something terrible hovering just out of sight, waiting.

Then came the shadows. They seemed to pool in the corners, darkening the spaces between furniture, thickening under the bed. At first, I thought it was just the play of headlights from the street, but the shapes lingered, stretching along the walls and ceiling in ways I can’t explain. And just before dawn, I thought I saw a figure standing in the doorway of Timmy’s room.

When I gathered the courage to look again: there was nothing there.

It was only then, as I lay back down beside Evelyn, that I realized I’d been gripping her hand all along, and that I’d been praying, over and over, that it was only the house settling, that the quiet would return to its familiar, *peacefu*l hum.

But this morning, when Timmy asked why someone was whispering his name during the night, I could feel the truth beginning to creep in: we aren’t alone. Something has shifted, and whatever it is, it’s come to Obedient Grove to make itself known.

The silence in Obedient Grove has always been a comfort to me, a stillness that held the world steady and predictable. But lately, I wonder if it’s something else entirely, something alive, that stirs within the quiet. A force that thrives in the spaces where words go unspoken and thoughts remain nascent. As strange as it sounds, it’s as though the very hush of this town draws out what’s hidden, giving shape to things that should never take form.

It began with Timmy’s sketches. He’s always been fond of drawing—a happy distraction, I’d thought, a way to keep his mind on brighter things. But his drawings have changed. Where once there were smiling stick figures and animals, there are now twisted shapes, creatures that don’t belong in any storybook. Long limbs, eyes that bulge in impossible places, mouths that curl into jagged grin. Evelyn and I exchanged uneasy glances when we saw them, dismissing it as a phase, perhaps, or an outlet for the confusion he must be feeling. But it didn’t stop there.

The first real sign came a few nights ago. Timmy was fast asleep when I heard the patter of footsteps in the hall. Thinking he’d woken up, I went to check, but found only his toys scattered across the floor. They hadn’t been there when we tucked him in. As I reached down to pick them up, one of them—a wooden horse on wheels—let out a faint creak, as if it had moved by itself. I told myself it was my imagination, but the dread lingered, a chill that seemed to seep into the walls

Evelyn and I were sitting in the living room, exhausted and the house was finally still, or so we thought. A faint shuffle behind us broke the silence, something soft and scratchy—just the sound you’d make if you dragged a piece of chalk across the wall in slow, jagged strokes.

I turned, and in that sliver of dim light from the hallway, I saw it. The thing was barely there, a shape that wavered and shifted, like a child’s frantic drawing, come to life and slipping between worlds. It looked like something Timmy had scrawled in crayon on paper, then smudged over in wild streaks—a chimera, but incomplete, sketched in blurry lines that couldn’t hold still. A strange smear of limbs and eyes that almost formed a face but melted away when I tried to focus. It didn’t walk, didn’t crawl, just seemed to blur in and out, as if it were trying to find itself and failing.

It was there, and then it wasn’t. When I blinked, the shape shifted, slipped backward, and vanished. But there was a sickly residue left in my mind, like staring too long at something bright and having the shape burned into your vision.

Neither of us said a word. Evelyn’s hand was cold in mine, her grip unsteady, and I knew she’d seen it too. We couldn’t find words to fill the silence, so we sat there, each of us holding our breath, watching the shadows for any sign that it might reappear. I felt my heart pounding in my ears, the quiet pressing in again, as if the house had sealed itself over that strange, fragile thing.

Hours later, we climbed into bed, but sleep refused to come. I lay awake, staring at the ceiling, wondering if it would slip back into our room while we slept, if it had always been lurking just beyond our sight, waiting.

Morning arrived, but it felt like the earth had tilted slightly, leaving everything off-kilter. The sunlight poured through the windows, but it didn’t warm the room; it only made the shadows sharper, more oppressive, as if they were stretching longer just to remind us of their presence. I watched Timmy sitting at the breakfast table, still as stone, staring blankly at his untouched plate. His hands were curled into fists at his sides, and his eyes—his eyes were distant, hollow, as if he wasn’t really here with us at all.

Evelyn and I didn’t speak. We couldn’t. The silence between us had grown thick, a presence in itself. The kind of silence that makes your skin crawl, the kind that makes you feel like you’re suffocating on your own breath. The house was so still, I could hear my pulse in my ears.

I watched Timmy, my heart hammering in my chest, but I couldn’t bring myself to ask him what was wrong. His stare was empty, unfocused, as if he were seeing something we couldn’t. The air in the room was so dense, so heavy with something unseen, that I couldn’t move. I couldn’t look away.

Evelyn’s hands were trembling in her lap, wringing together like she was trying to hold onto something, trying to stop herself from breaking apart. I could see the same panic rising in her eyes—the kind of panic that comes from knowing something terrible is happening, but not knowing what or when it will strike. Her gaze kept flicking to the shadows in the corners of the room, as if expecting them to move, to shift into something more solid, something...alive.

I couldn’t look away from Timmy, and he couldn’t look away from whatever it was that he saw. The *silence* stretched on, longer than it ever should have, choking us, suffocating us. No words were spoken, not a sound—just the sound of our breaths, too loud in the oppressive quiet. I wanted to scream, to break the silence, but I couldn’t. It felt like the very air would tear if I did.

Timmy didn’t blink. He didn’t move. His hands were still clenched, and he just kept staring at that breakfast plate like it was the most important thing in the world. I wanted to shake him, to make him snap out of whatever this was, but I couldn’t bring myself to touch him. I was terrified that the moment I did, whatever we were avoiding—whatever we were waiting for—would rush back in, filling the room like smoke, like shadows, like something we couldn’t control.

The quiet wasn’t just the absence of noise. It was something more—something alive, suffocating, pressing against us from every side. I couldn’t tell where it was coming from, but I knew it was here, in the house, in the air. The same thing that had haunted us the night before, that had flickered in and out of existence like a smear of ink—now it was everywhere. I felt it creeping up behind me, in the corners of my eyes, where the shadows wouldn’t stop stretching.

Timmy finally blinked. But he didn’t move.

We didn’t move.

The house didn’t move.

And the silence...the silence just kept pressing in, tighter and tighter.

I had to get out of there, and left Timmy and Evelyn to go to the library. I've always got my answers from books. I have an uncanny knack for research and locating information. I had to do something, to find a way through the silence. It was strange that I felt like I was somewhere I didn't want to be, as though the threshold to knowledge were a cold and evil stone slab I had to step over.

I don't know how long I spent in the library—time blurred into something unrecognizable, a tangled mess of hours or perhaps days. The cold stone of the building seemed to press in on me, heavy and oppressive, as if the very walls were conspiring to keep me trapped. I had no idea what I was searching for, but I knew I had to find something—anything—that could explain what had been happening to Timmy. There had to be an answer hidden in the town's forgotten past, some piece of history that could tell me how to protect him.

And then I found it. A single, obscure folktale, buried in a crumbling old book, tucked between forgotten volumes. It wasn’t much—just a few tattered pages, barely legible—but it was enough. The story, something from the earliest days of Obedient Grove, told of a creature, a thing born from a child’s imagination. It had no true form, just a blur of shifting shapes, twisting shadows—like something sketched quickly with crayon, but alive. And it had been summoned by the innocent mind of a child.

The creature, too pure at first, had grown twisted, fed by fear, until it had become a terror that gripped the town for years. The child’s grandparents, it seemed, had been the ones to defeat it. They had used something—an artifact, a weapon of light, something the town’s history had nearly erased. These artifacts, the *Fulgence Illumum*, were the key. The light they wielded was the only force that could push the creature back, banishing it into the darkness, but at a cost.

The cost was unthinkable.

Using the *Fulgence Illumum*, the tale warned, would destroy the child’s imagination—erase it. The very thing that had brought the creature into existence would be destroyed, and with it, the child’s innocence, the very soul of childhood. I read those words, feeling them sink into me like vomit, heavy and suffocating.

But what could I do? The creature was here, in our home, in Timmy’s mind. I saw it every time he stared into space, every time he shuddered and looked over his shoulder. I couldn’t let it consume him. But the price...

I didn’t know what else to do. I couldn’t stop myself.

That’s when I overheard something. One of the librarians, a woman with an unsettlingly quiet voice, had mentioned the library’s restricted cellar. It was off-limits to the public, but there were rumors about what might be kept down there. Strange things. I hadn’t thought much of it until then. But now, in that moment of desperation, I knew where I had to go.

The library had emptied by the time I slipped down the hall, moving quietly through the back corridors, my breath catching in my throat. The air grew damp and cold as I descended the narrow stairs to the cellar, the stone walls pressing in on me as if they wanted to swallow my soul. It was darker than I’d expected, the kind of darkness that makes you feel like the shadows hide something, watching. Shelves lined with dust-covered crates filled the space, each one feeling more ancient than the last.

And then, I found it. A chest, sitting alone in the corner, its wood old and warped with age, covered in strange markings, too faded to decipher. Something in me knew. I felt it in my gut. This was it. This was what I had been searching for.

Inside the chest, the *Fulgence Illumum* lay waiting. Three objects, gleaming faintly even in the darkness: a lantern, its glass glowing from within as if it contained its own heartbeat; a pair of gloves, thin and delicate, woven from a silver thread that caught the faintest light; and a crystal orb, so clear it seemed to absorb the very air around it, casting a thousand tiny, fractured reflections on the walls.

I didn’t need to ask what they were. I knew, somehow. These were the very objects that had been used to banish the creature long ago. The light they held was the only thing that could stop it now. But there was no forgetting the cost. The child’s imagination would burn away. Timmy’s innocence would be gone forever.

I hesitated, standing there in the dark, the artifacts heavy in my hands. The price... the cost was unbearable, but what choice did I have? Timmy couldn’t go on like this, trapped in his own fear. I couldn’t stand to watch him slip further away, lost in that terrible thing that lurked in his mind.

I took the artifacts. My heart raced, my hands trembling as I slipped them into my coat, burying them close to my chest. I didn’t look back as I ascended the stairs, barely breathing as I passed the empty halls, out into the crisp night air.

The weight of what we faced pressed down on us, heavier than anything I’d ever carried. Evelyn and I hadn’t spoken much since I returned from the library, the silence between us thick with the weight of what we were about to do. I could feel it in her eyes—what I felt, too. The fear wasn’t the same as before; it wasn’t just the creature anymore. It had become about Timmy, and the uncertainty of what we had to sacrifice. What would it cost us to protect him?

When Claire and her husband... when they were taken from us, everything changed. The world became a quiet, desolate place. It’s hard to describe, that kind of loss. It’s not like any grief I’ve known, where you can say goodbye, where there’s a sense of closure. No, this was different. It was the suddenness of it that cuts the deepest. One day they were here, full of life, and the next, it felt like they’d never existed. That kind of absence, that void, it doesn’t fill up easily.

And now, in the quiet of this house that used to echo with Claire’s voice, there’s only stillness. The walls are heavy with it, and every corner feels empty. That’s when Timmy came. He wasn’t a replacement for Claire, and I knew he never could be. But he’s a piece of her, a part of this family, and we hoped—maybe foolishly—that his presence could fill just a little bit of the space she left behind. But I don’t think Timmy understands. He still thinks this is just a visit. That one day, everything will go back to the way it was. He doesn’t know that his parents aren’t coming back.

And that breaks my heart. He’s so young, and he’s so lost in all of this. He deserves to know the world isn’t a dark and broken place, that there’s safety and love. But sometimes, I see it in his eyes—the same confusion, the same fear I feel. I wonder if he senses it too. The emptiness, the loss, the way everything’s changed so suddenly, and so completely.

Every time I look at him, I think of Claire. I think of how she would’ve known what to say, how she would’ve made everything feel okay. But she’s not here. And now there’s something else—a creature, a thing born from Timmy’s imagination, his fears, and this quiet town that seems to hold everything in place, like it’s waiting for something to break. It’s feeding on him, growing stronger every day. It’s like watching him slip away, little by little, into something else. Something darker.

I wish I knew what Claire would have done. What she would have said. Maybe she would’ve known how to stop this—how to keep Timmy from fading into something I couldn’t reach. But she’s gone, and I’m left with this fear, this horror, and I don’t know how to fix it.

The *Fulgence Illumum*—these artifacts I found, these light-based objects that can burn away the creature—might be the only hope we have. But there’s a price to using them, a terrible price. If we destroy the creature, we destroy Timmy’s imagination, his innocence. I know it will break him. And I don’t know if I can do that.

But I can’t let him become what this creature wants. Not after all that’s already taken from us. I can’t lose him too.

So we move forward. The ache of Claire’s absence is still fresh, still raw in ways I didn’t expect. Timmy’s only just moved in, but already, it feels like he’s been here forever. And yet, every day, I feel like we’re walking on the edge of something we can’t quite see, waiting for it to take us. We can’t protect Timmy from everything—he’s already lost so much—but I have to try. I can’t let this thing steal him, too. I can’t let him become like this house: empty, quiet, forgotten.

For Claire’s sake, for Timmy’s, we have to face what comes next. Whatever it costs us, we can’t let him slip away into the dark. Not like she did. Not again.

It all happened so fast, too fast—one second, we were standing there, the light flickering in our hands, trying to hold it together, and the next, the creature was *everywhere*. God, I can’t even make sense of it, everything a blur—its body stretching, twisting, *growing*. It didn’t make sense. The walls groaned like they were alive, creaking, cracking, and suddenly the air felt *wrong*, as if the house itself was being torn apart from the inside.

The windows—they exploded outward, and I couldn’t hear myself scream over the shriek that tore through the walls. It wasn’t just screams—it was everything—growls, screeches, tearing metal, cracking bones, all crashing together, a roar that rattled my bones, shook the very ground beneath us.

We had to run. We didn’t even think. We just—ran.

Evelyn grabbed my arm, pulling me toward the door. Timmy was right behind us, his hand clutching mine, and we were stumbling, tripping over our feet, every step leading us farther from that *thing* inside. The floor beneath us groaned, buckling, the house itself seemed to be *caving in*, bending and shifting in ways I couldn’t understand. There was no time to think, just run—run, *get out*—and we did, through the door, into the air that felt cold, wrong, like it had been poisoned by whatever the hell was inside.

And then—*then*—it came. The house… *broke*. The limbs of it *reached*, stretching out from the windows, from the cracks in the walls, like they were made of nothing but air and shadow, barely there, flickering like some half-formed nightmare. It was too much, too fast, too much to even take in—everything splintered and cracked and *flew* outward, shards of wood, glass, the very walls breaking apart, exploding into the air, the wind screaming with the sound of it.

We were running. We didn’t even look back.

The air was full of glass, of splinters, like they were cutting through the world, raining down around us. We didn’t stop. I couldn’t—*we couldn’t*—look back.

But then, for a second, I did.

The house… it wasn’t a house anymore. It was just *pieces*, *fragments*, everything falling apart, bending, warping like it wasn’t meant to be real. The thing—whatever it was—was still there, still *growing*, limbs flailing, stretching outward, impossibly large, and the noise… God, the noise, it was like everything was screaming at once.

And then it exploded.

No, it wasn’t like fire—it was like the world itself cracked open, every bit of it pulled apart and shredded in an instant. The walls, the windows, the floor—*everything*—ripped away, flying outward, and I thought I was going to be torn apart with it. I was holding on to Timmy, holding on to Evelyn, and we ran, *ran*, just trying to get *away* from the destruction, the chaos, the terror. But there was no escaping it. It was all around us, too close, too fast.

And then—*it stopped*.

The house was gone. The wreckage of it was all that was left. We stood there, breathing heavily, too terrified to speak. My legs were shaking, my chest was tight, and I couldn’t even—*couldn’t even think*—I just stared at the pile of rubble. The thing—*the creature*—was gone. But we weren’t safe. Not yet.

Timmy was beside us, so we grabbed him into our embrace, alive, but *changed*, somehow, like he’d seen something no child should ever see. Evelyn clung to me, and I to her, and we all stood there, frozed, holding each other as the dust settled, as the echoes of the nightmare slowly faded away.

But that silence—it was heavier than anything else. And the fear, it was still there. In the back of my mind, gnawing at the edges of my thoughts, I could feel it.

The nightmare wasn’t over. It couldn’t be.

...

Now, I’m sitting here, writing this in the big city. There’s noise here, all the time. Sirens, honking cars, the constant murmur of the crowd. But it doesn’t bother us anymore. The noise is normal. We’ve learned to drown it out, to let it become part of the rhythm of our life. It’s like we’ve lived here forever, and somehow… that night, that house—it already feels like a dream.

Timmy is different now. He’s *still* Timmy, but there’s something softer about him. Something older, too. The other day, he showed me a drawing he’d made—a picture of his mom and dad going to heaven. There were clouds, stars, and a golden light surrounding them. I don’t know how long he’s been thinking about them that way, but he told me they were happy now. He said they were watching over us. He said it with this quiet certainty, like it was the most natural thing in the world.

And for the first time in a long time, I think he might be right. I don’t know how or when it happened, but he’s starting to heal. The scars from that night are still there, buried somewhere deep, but Timmy’s imagination is still alive, and it’s no longer a weapon. It’s his way of coming back to us, of understanding, of letting go.

It’s strange, though. Even now, I can’t help but remember the fear, the terror of what we had to do to protect him. The *Fulgence Illumum*, those damned artifacts—we took something from him that night. We didn’t just fight a creature. We fought against what makes him who he is. I can never forget the look on his face when he realized what had happened. But somehow, we’re all still here, still together, and in some ways, that’s all that matters.

We’re safe now. We’re *whole*. But I know that no matter how far we move from Obedient Grove, no matter how much the city’s noise drowns out everything else, I’ll never forget that silence—the quiet that swallowed us whole, that *thing* we fought, and the way our world shattered in an instant.

And I know, deep down, that we’ll never fully escape it. Not really. Not ever. But I’ll hold onto Timmy and Evelyn, and I’ll protect them for as long as I can. That’s all I can do. And maybe… just maybe… we’ll be alright.
