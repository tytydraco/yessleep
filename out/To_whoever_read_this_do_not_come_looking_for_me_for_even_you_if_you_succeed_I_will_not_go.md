Have you ever felt true happiness? I’m not talking about being content with what you achieved in life, or, for that matter, the satisfaction that comes in knowing how every choice you made has led you to being exactly who you are. I’m describing that specific feeling that you get right after waking up from a perfect dream. That moment just before being reminded of real life by your own morning breath or by hearing your spouse murmuring something in their sleep. That moment when you feel selfish and dirty for being frustrated with everything surrounding you just because It’s just not *that*. I don’t think I can describe it any better, and choosing wrong words would feel like blasphemy so I will not even try.

I felt that. Truly. In a place I would never consider to be even remotely pleasant to be in. Pouring rain, wet clothes sticking to your chilled, but somehow still hot and sweaty body. Hands full of heavy bags filled to the brim with all kinds of stuff. I remember looking forward to watch TV and eat a bag of chips I got. Being proud of myself for not forgetting to buy that damned canned corn my wife needed to make dinner that day. I thought I was happy. I did not know any better. And then *I heard it for the first time*.

It was not like anything I’ve ever heard before. I wasn’t even something a human being was able to hear for all I know. It wasn’t physical. It wasn’t mental. It was more like a feeling of hearing something, a symphony of emotions that played in sync inside of my consciousness. And still, it was a melody. It lasted for less them a second, but felt like whole orchestral performance just played right here where I was standing. The rain stopped. For the world it didn’t, but I was not a part of the world anymore. My feet moved by themselves, like in old cartoons when the character is dragged by the smell of a delicious pie placed on the kitchen window to chill. It wasn’t involuntary though, I wanted to go. I walked and walked, trying to catch the melody once more. So far, I was unsuccessful.

My phone rang and dragged me out of the trance.

“- Honey?”

“- Hey Bun.”

“- Just checking if everything is okay, there is a terrible thunderstorm outside. Are you gonna be home soon?”

“- Yeah, I’m okay Bun, I’ll stick around in the store for some time though, hope the rain will thin out a bit.”

“- Oh, okay, Amy have been acting fussy since you went out. We’ll wait for you, stay safe!”

“- I will, don’t worry love, see you soon! Bye!”

“- Bye-bye!”

The feeling of guilt slowly crawled up my back, choking me. Why did I lie? Did she hear the rain pouring all around me? And if so, why didn’t she say anything about it? Thousands of anxious thoughts started to race one another inside of my mind. I knew I needed to get back to the parking lot, to my car, back to my life. And it was right when I turned back that *I heard it for the second time*.

This time it was even more beautiful, more enchanting, like a song of a mermaid that desperately needed to lure in one more soul. My whole body was singing along, every nerve, every cell inside of me joined the ecstatic chorus. I did not want to open my eyes after it stopped. For several minutes I was desperately clinging onto the feeling, trying to relive it once more. Eventually, the rain got to me. The melody was completely lost and I was getting so cold the tips of my fingers felt numb. I shook, water pooling in the folds of my jacked flew everywhere. I took a step towards the nearby forest. Sure, it was coming from somewhere there. I ran, not wanting to feel the rain on my skin anymore. Not wanting to feel anything at all, actually.

When I entered the forest, I noticed something. Trees felt different. From the looks of it they were… ordinary, unremarkable? Maybe a little too ordinary even. I reached out and touched the nearest one, trying to understand what exactly was so off about them. My fingers slightly grazed the bark and I almost screamed. It was warm, almost soft to the touch. Pulsating, humming, buzzing inside. Like a giant animal, living and breathing, its thick blood running through its throbbing veins. Somewhere deep inside I felt repulsed. Still, I could not let go. A wave of admiration for the wondrous organism washed over me, flushing away every doubt and every hesitation I had. It was stunningly beautiful. I threw myself at it, hugging the delicate bark, my ear pressed tightly against it. Low humming warmed my consciousness. I caressed my tree with the tips of my fingers, shivering with joy at every new intricate pattern I found. And then *I heard it for the third time*.

This time it was different. The melody was distant, yet almost in sync with the voice of my tree. I froze in place, trying to locate where it was coming from, but couldn’t. It was simply everywhere, as if the trees themselves chanted in unison. I wanted to sing along with them but my useless body was just not enough to join their sacred rhapsody. Even worse, I would ruin it with my gurgling and I could not let that happen. So I sat down and cried. It was the only thing I could do, as the great sorrow bloomed its flowers inside of my mind. I was not enough. I was never enough. I cried and cried, still hearing the mesmerizing melody of the forest so close to me, yet still so unreachable. It’s only then when I realized that roots of every tree around me were going in one direction – deeper into the woods. I went as well.

I touched every tree on my way, lightly grazing them with my hands as I made my way trough the forest. Every single one felt different, sounded different, yet similar, like parts of one enormous system connected together. With every step I took my body felt lighter, my mind – happier. I felt like a child running to their mother. It was natural. More natural than the whole life I lived before this moment. More natural then eating and sleeping or even breathing. And then I saw a glimpse of *Her*.

There was no more ground under my feet, instead, bundles upon bundles of roots, tangled together, creating one gigantic perfect mesh, reaching its cord-like body to Her. She was, is, the most beautiful thing I ever imagined, one could ever imagine. Her voluptuous body stood in the middle of everything, generously accepting matted roots inside her stem. Several swollen burls were hanging on her arms, so bloated and perfect, like breast of a marble statue. Too perfect to lust over them, in fact, even thinking about Her in that way made my body tremble in discomfort. I couldn’t look at Her. My gaze felt dirty, unworthy, like wiping your greasy hands on a Bible. Still, I yearned for Her. That’s when *I heard it for the last time*.

It was Her call. She was calling for me. I reached out, and She sang louder. Never in my pathetic life I felt so in place, so accepted, so loved. I did not rush to her embrace, no. I walked, slowly, grateful for every step She had allowed me to make. I felt her body with my own, pressing my chest against rough, but welcoming bark. Wearing clothes in a moment like this felt like a crime, it took all I have in me not to strip right then and there. I caressed a small branch, only one I could reach, so fine and elegant. Kissed a shallow opening, revealing her glistening, perfect grain. I felt shameful, like a teenager caught exploring their body. But it did not matter as she welcomed my touch. I kissed Her again and again, sliding my tongue deeper in the hollow each time. My mouth felt hot, small creases on her bark scraped my lips, as if they were playfully punishing me for what I was doing. I let out a muffled moan, as small drops of resin, perfectly round and shiny started appearing inside of the hollow. They smelled strong, like the best kind of poison, so sweet, potent and musty, no person could ever resist stealing a bit to themselves. Neither did I.

The moment my tongue touched her irresistible juices, my sense of self disappeared. I stopped existing as a person, as a soul, there was no more “me” at all. We were one. I was Her, She was me, and we were all at once. I felt every soul that came before me, every bug, every leaf that were lucky enough to join Us. I could feel every inch of the roots covering the forest floor, every drop of rain that fell down on them. We were now and then, as I felt every sunrise that came before I found Her. And I could finally join in our collective symphony. There, I was happy. We were happy. My phone rang.

Suddenly, I became painfully aware once more.

“- Hey, Jay, I’m getting worried, where are you?”

Every word felt like a gunshot.

“- Um, I… I had some problems with the c-car.”

Still drunk with her juice, I could not think of anything better to say.

“- Jay, are you okay? What’s with the car? Do you want me to call a towing company?”

“- No, listen… I’m fine. I’ll be home soon, okay?”

“… Okay.”

She dropped the call.

And then I realized what needs to be done.

To whoever reads this: head to Bergland, Michigan, take the southern road to the Berland lake. Somewhere in between the city and the lake you’ll see a small forest opening with a gravel path. There I buried the bodies of my wife, Emily Grace Thatcher, and my daughter, Amy Lynn Thatcher. I marked their graves with pieces of torn bright red t-shirt, so it will not be hard to find. Please, give their bodies a proper funeral, but skip the prayers, as their souls became a part of Us. As much as I’m sorry, I tried my best to persuade them to go willingly. I failed and did not have any other choice. I could not bear leaving them to rot in their unaware, ignorant realities and made this choice out of pure love for both of them. And I repeat: do not come looking for me. Soon I will be one with Her and we all be One, dancing under thousands of sunsets and sunrises, existing in eternal bliss. My body will be no more, and I will be no more, and for that, I will not go.
