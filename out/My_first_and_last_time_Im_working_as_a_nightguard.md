So I was out of work again. The factory I worked in for six months had gone under and fired all the workers, including me. They let me keep my uniform and boots. The man in charge said we didn't have to bother returning them.

As I boarded the bus home, I thought of what to do next. I need to find work somewhere, I don't have a lot of money saved up. It would only cover the next month's rent if I didn't eat anything.

As the bus reached my stop I got out, still thinking about what I should do. I saw a leaflet on the ground. As I looked at it, it said a worker was needed. I picked it up, thinking maybe this was my lucky day.

On the leaflet, there was an ad about a worker being needed as a guard at a junkyard. The detail that caught my eye was that it only offered night shifts and a pay that was better than the one I had at the factory.
There was a phone number at the end, so I called it. I silently hoped that I wasn't late and that someone didn't call before me.




I dialed the number with shaking fingers, listening to the ring echo in my ear. It rang for a long time. Long enough for me to start thinking no one would answer. But then, a voice clicked in on the other end.

“Yeah?” The voice was rough, like gravel under a heavy tire.

“Uh, hi. I’m calling about the ad. The one for the night guard job?”

There was a pause, just a beat too long to be normal. “Still need someone. Pay’s what’s listed, no questions asked. Can you start tonight?”

The question caught me off guard. No questions about experience or even my name. But I couldn’t afford to be picky.

“Yeah, I can do that,” I said, glancing back at the crumpled leaflet in my hand. “Where’s the place?”

He rattled off an address on the outskirts of town, a place I didn’t recognize, and then hung up without a goodbye. I looked out at the street in front of me. It was a cold night, the kind where your breath fogs up the air in front of you, but I had a place to be.

I thought of what to bring with me for the job. I had an old flashlight that I bought some time ago, but it still worked. It was probably going to be cold tonight, but since the guy I talked to on the phone didn't mention me getting any uniform from him, I just decided to put on the old uniform that I used to wear when I still worked at the factory.

As night time came and it was time to go, I boarded a bus that was passing next to the junkyard. The bus was mostly empty. A few old people, that were probably here to visit their grandkids before returning to their rural towns.

As the bus driver stopped at my destination, I looked at the old rusty gate that was in front of me. As I approached the gate, I noticed it was locked by a chain. I waited there thinking the man that I spoke to on the phone would come and let me in. As I waited for a few minutes, I got a text message. It was from the number I called. 

The message said, "Forgot to tell you the key to the gate was lost by the last nightguard just jump over."

After reading the message, I jumped over the rusty gate. It creaked and shook loudly as I did.

As I landed on my feet, I looked around. There were a lot of cars here; some were rusty, and time had taken a toll on them. They must have been here for a long time.
I saw a small house; it must be a guard house, I thought as I headed toward it.

From the outside, it was a small house painted yellow; there was a chair next to the old wooden front door. As I reached the door, I remembered that I didn't have the key, but the door was luckily unlocked.

The inside of the small guard house was more like a storage area, with old TVs, fridges, and some other junk. I looked around, hoping this wasn't really where I was supposed to spend the night. I saw a door to the side of the large room. I opened it, and inside was a really small room. I flicked the light switch turning the lights on. And I saw there was an old furnace that was full of cigarette buds. An old green military-style locker that had a lock on it.A small brown sofa that, for some reason, had breadcrumbs all over it. There was a big table on the other end of the room that had a small TV, and there was a big window above the table through which you could see the outside and the old rusty gate.

I sat on the sofa, thinking about what to do as I was already getting bored. This was my first job where I had to work alone. Having no one to talk to and to pass the time is going to be hard getting used to.

I received another text message. It said: "Listen, kid, all you have to do for the night is to go out every half an hour and walk around to check that no one is trying to steal anything or trying to enter the property."

Ok, this was going to be easy, I thought to myself. Good thing I brought my flashlight with me.

I went outside and turned my flashlight on. It was a lot colder out, I thought, as I felt a cold breeze that seemed to go right through me, making me shudder.

As I started my walk through the junkyard
I noticed that a car at the very front had one of its doors open. Which I found odd, I could have sworn that it was closed when I came in. Maybe my mind is just playing tricks with me. I continued my patrol around the junkyard. This place was a lot bigger than I initially thought. My legs were starting to ache as I finally reached the old guardhouse.

Before going in, I looked around one more time. There was no need for it, but I just wanted to check. And I saw that the car that had its door opened when I started the patrol, well, now that same car had its door closed. I felt this chill that I can't explain go right through me. I went back inside the guardhouse, telling myself it was my mind playing tricks on me.

I won't lie, but I was feeling a bit creeped out.

The time passed quickly, and it was time for me to do another patrol. As I went outside, I pointed my flashlight at the car to see if there was anything different, but its door was closed.

As I walked around the property, there wasn't anything unusual, apart from me sometimes hearing some metal creaking.
But then, on one of the cars, I saw what seemed to be a jacket. I went closer to check it out. It was an old, worn-out leather jacket over the hood of one of the cars. I might have taken it for myself. If it wasn't filled with bullet holes all over, that would explain why someone might have thrown it away.

As I inspected the bullet holes, I heard a small thud coming from inside the trunk of the car. It was subtle at first, but the more I listened, the louder it got. It was like something was inside. I approached the trunk slowly. The thudding is not stopping for a second. I braced myself for what I might see inside as I slowly opened the trunk. But it was empty. I was hit with an unexpected odor, something metallic and faintly sweet.

 There were only some old newspapers. Most of them had their texts worn out. But the ones that didn't have, were full of stories of some kind of local mob syndicates being in war. And about some suspected members going missing, and still haven't been found. I'm starting to get a weird feeling about this place. I feel the air around me going colder. And then I heard a sound that resembled a car door slowly being opened behind me. I turn around but there is nothing. And no car door is open. I decide to go back to the old guard house, as I do. I can't get rid of the feeling of being watched.

 I could still smell that weird odor. It was as if it had caught on to my clothes and it was following me around. As I entered the old guard house, I found the old newspapers on the table. How did they get here? They weren't here when I first came in. My mind started racing; someone must have gotten in and brought them here to mess with me.

As I looked out of the window, paranoid that someone might have just jumped the old rusty gate and was still outside waiting for me, I noticed that on the table was an old picture. A person was sitting on the chair that seemed like the chair out front; he was an old man with a beard. He was wearing a uniform of some kind and was looking at the person taking the picture. He wasn't smiling, just looking with a serious expression on his face. In his hand, he was holding what seemed like a piece of bread. 
Was he a previous guard here? This picture was really old. This place is getting weirder by the minute.

I thought about just calling the police, but my thoughts were suddenly interrupted by the sound of the chain on the old rusty gate rattling as if someone was trying to get inside. I rush outside with my flashlight in hand to see what is happening. But there was no one there. I look around and check the area out of the junkyard and see no one there. When I returned to the old guard house, I found that the old military locker that had a lock on it was now open.

I looked inside and found an old black uniform in it, just like the one the man in the picture had on. As I checked it out, I found a key inside it. It was old, and God knows for what lock it was meant. It could be a house key, maybe? There was also a note. I opened it up to read it, hoping there were some answers on who it belonged to."GET OUT" was the only thing that was on the note.

As I read that word, I was thinking about actually leaving this place. The lights went out all of a sudden. As I was about to reach for the light switch, I heard the window breaking and a loud shriek. Frightened I turned my flashlight on. There was glass all over the floor. As I looked outside, there was no one there. I went outside to see what could have done this. But that's when I noticed something weird...the old rusty gate wasn't there anymore. There were some cars and old junk where the old gate was. I couldn't ignore this. Something was seriously wrong with this place. I took out my phone to call the cops. But there was no signal.

Panic started to claw at me, but I forced myself to take deep breaths and think clearly. If the gate was gone, maybe there was another way out.

I clutched my flashlight tighter, sweeping the beam around the junkyard. Shadows danced across the rusted cars and twisted metal piles, creating shapes that seemed to shift and twitch as I moved. I tried to focus on finding a way out, even though I couldn't shake the feeling that something was watching me from the dark spaces between the cars.

I took a path between two old trucks, hoping it would lead to a fence or some boundary I could climb. My steps crunched over broken glass and loose gravel, each sound amplified in the stillness. As I passed a large stack of smashed-up refrigerators, I heard a scraping noise behind me. I whipped around, shining my flashlight toward the sound, but all I saw was an old wheel slowly rolling to a stop.

"Just the wind," I muttered to myself, though I knew I didn't believe it.

I kept moving, trying to remember the layout of the junkyard. It felt like it was twisting around me, turning into a maze where the rows of cars and junk seemed longer and more winding than they should have been. My breath fogged up in the cold night air, and that strange metallic odor still clung to me like a shadow.

After a few more minutes of searching, I stumbled upon a section of the junkyard I hadn't seen before. It was a clearing of sorts, with a few charred vehicles surrounding a burned-out shack. The air felt colder here, and I could see my breath swirling in front of me. I approached cautiously, hoping that maybe this area connected to the main road or had a gap in the fence.

But as I got closer, my flashlight revealed something chilling: a series of old, weathered crosses sticking out of the ground, half-buried among the weeds and rubble. They were crude, made of twisted metal and old boards, and each one had a name scratched into the surface—barely legible through the rust and dirt.

One of the names caught my eye, and my heart skipped a beat. It was my name.

Suddenly, I heard a low murmur, like a voice carried by the wind, but I couldn't make out the words. I spun around, aiming my flashlight in every direction, but there was no one there. Yet the feeling of being watched grew stronger, the hairs on the back of my neck standing on end.

I had to get out. Forget finding the gate or trying to make sense of what was happening—I needed to run. As I turned to make a break for it, the beam of my flashlight flickered and then cut out entirely. I smacked it against my palm, but it only sputtered weakly before dying. I was plunged into darkness, surrounded by the shadowy shapes of the junkyard.

That's when I felt a hand brush against my shoulder, cold and skeletal. I froze, too terrified to turn around. I heard a voice, close to my ear, hoarse and barely more than a whisper.

"You should've left when you had the chance."

I spun around, swinging blindly with the flashlight, but hit only empty air. My heart pounded in my chest, and I could barely see in the darkness. I stumbled back, tripping over a piece of scrap metal and falling to the ground. As I scrambled to get back up, I saw a figure standing just outside the circle of darkness where my flashlight had died.

It was the man from the photo—the old guard. He wore the black uniform I had found in the locker, and his face was half-obscured by shadows, but I could see his cold, lifeless eyes fixed on me.

Then, just as suddenly as he had appeared, he melted back into the dark, leaving me gasping for air. The whispering picked up again, all around me now, like the rustling of leaves on a dead wind. My hands shook as I fumbled for the key I had found earlier. I didn't know what it was for, but in my panic, I thought that maybe—just maybe—it could unlock something that would get me out of this nightmare.

I ran back toward the guardhouse, the whispers growing louder as if they were chasing me. As I threw myself inside and locked the door behind me, I noticed something new in the corner of the room—an old trapdoor that I hadn’t seen before, partly hidden under a tattered rug. My flashlight flickered back on just in time for me to see the keyhole set into its rusted surface.

With shaking hands, I jammed the key into the lock. It turned with a loud, rusty click. As I heaved the trapdoor open, a cold draft wafted up from the darkness below, carrying with it that same metallic odor. I stared down into the pitch-black tunnel beneath, wondering if it was a way out—or something even worse.

Behind me, the whispers fell silent, replaced by the sound of footsteps approaching the guardhouse door. I had to decide, and fast.

As I went down, I was surrounded by darkness. As I descended into the tunnel, the darkness wrapped around me like a suffocating blanket. The air was thick and stale, each breath tasting of rust and damp earth. My flashlight cast a weak, wavering beam ahead of me, barely cutting through the pitch-black. The narrow, crumbling stairs groaned under my weight, and I gripped the railing—cold and slick with moisture—to keep my balance.

With each step, the world above felt further away, as if I was plunging into a place where light and warmth had never existed. My ears strained to pick up any sound beyond my own footsteps and labored breathing. But the deeper I went, the more I became aware of a distant, rhythmic noise—like something dragging along the ground, a slow and deliberate scrape that echoed through the tunnel.

I reached the bottom of the stairs and found myself in a narrow corridor, the walls lined with old, rusted pipes that dripped water into shallow puddles. The beam of my flashlight flickered again, casting eerie shadows that seemed to move on their own across the wet, uneven floor. I pressed on, every instinct telling me to turn back, but the thought of whatever had been outside the guardhouse kept me moving forward.

After what felt like an eternity of creeping through the dark, I came upon an old, heavy door set into the stone. The door was made of thick metal, and it looked ancient as if it had been here long before the junkyard above. There was a faded symbol scratched into the surface—something I didn't recognize, a crude pattern of lines and circles that seemed to twist the longer I looked at it.

With a deep breath, I reached out and tried the handle. It resisted for a moment, then creaked open, releasing a gust of air that was colder than anything I’d felt outside. My flashlight shone into the space beyond, revealing a room lined with shelves cluttered with old, dusty ledgers and strange objects—some that looked like old weapons or tools, others like things I couldn't even begin to understand.

At the center of the room was a large table, and on it sat an open book, the pages yellowed and brittle. Next to the book lay a bundle wrapped in a faded cloth, stained dark with something that could have been rust—or blood. As I approached the table, I noticed the familiar metallic odor had grown stronger, filling the air so thickly I could almost taste it.

The book’s pages were filled with scrawled handwriting—hasty notes, maps of the junkyard, and a list of names. Some of the names were crossed out, but one near the bottom caught my eye—it was my own. A chill ran through me as I traced the words, my flashlight casting long shadows across the page.

Beneath the list of names was a drawing, crude but recognizable: it showed the junkyard, the guardhouse, and the tunnel I had just come through. But there was something else—something that the drawing seemed to hint at, hidden deeper within the ground. It looked like a pit, filled with indistinct shapes and symbols that twisted my mind when I tried to focus on them.

Before I could think about what any of it meant, I heard the sound of shuffling behind me—closer than before. I turned sharply, my flashlight cutting through the dark, and saw a figure standing at the entrance to the room. It was the same old man from the photo, his uniform sagging over a body that seemed too thin to fill it. His eyes gleamed faintly in the beam of my flashlight, and his mouth twisted into a hollow, joyless grin.

"You came too far," he rasped, his voice like dry leaves scraping over stone. "This place... it doesn't let anyone leave."

He stepped forward, his boots splashing in the puddles that dotted the floor. I backed away, my pulse racing, trying to find a way out of the room. But the air seemed to thicken around me, pressing in on all sides. My flashlight flickered, and for a heartbeat, everything was plunged into darkness.

When the light returned, he was standing inches from me, his face inches from mine, those cold eyes staring deep into my own.

"You should have listened," he whispered, his breath chilling my skin. "Now... you're part of it."

I stumbled back, crashing into the table. The book and the bundle fell to the floor, spilling out something metallic that clattered loudly in the stillness. In the brief moment of distraction, I bolted past him, running blindly back through the tunnel, desperate to reach the stairs before the darkness swallowed me whole.

Behind me, I heard his footsteps, echoing in time with my own. But there was something else, too—a low, rumbling noise, like the earth itself was shifting beneath my feet. The tunnel seemed to grow longer and darker with every step, as if it was stretching out, trapping me inside.

I could see the faint outline of the stairs ahead, just a few more steps. But as I reached them, the ground beneath me trembled, and I lost my footing, sprawling onto the cold, damp stone. The flashlight flew from my hand, spinning across the floor and leaving me in near-total darkness.

I scrambled forward, my hands clawing at the stairs, trying to find the light. But before I could reach it, a shadow loomed over me—a shape darker than the tunnel itself.

And then, everything went silent.

In the silence that followed, my mind raced, adrenaline pumping through every vein. I lay there on the cold floor, barely breathing, trying to control the panic clawing at my throat. The shadow loomed closer, and I could feel a freezing chill as if the darkness itself was reaching out to drag me down into the depths.

But I wasn’t ready to give up. My hand brushed against something cold and hard—the object that had fallen from the bundle when I knocked it over. It was the old key. My fingers closed around it, feeling its jagged edges.

With no other plan, I scrambled up and grabbed the flashlight, shining it directly into the shadow. It recoiled slightly, and I took that moment to run toward the stairs, clutching the key in one hand and my flashlight in the other.

I heard the old man’s voice behind me, a wheezing, angry hiss that chased me through the tunnel. "You can't escape what's already claimed you!"

Ignoring him, I raced up the stairs, taking two at a time, feeling the darkness clawing at my back. My breath came out in short, ragged gasps, each one clouding the frigid air. I reached the top of the stairs and stumbled back into the guardhouse, slamming the door behind me.

I jammed the old key into the lock. I twisted it, hearing a loud click as the lock engaged. But I knew that wouldn't hold for long. I had to find a way out of this nightmare, or at least a way to keep whatever was chasing me at bay.

The windows were shattered, and the front door was no better. I rushed over to the green military-style locker that had been open earlier. Maybe there was something inside that could help me. As I flung the door open, I found an old flare gun tucked into the side, along with a few flares.

Hope sparked in me—literal and metaphorical. If that thing was afraid of the light, maybe this could buy me enough time to get away.

I stuffed the flare gun into my jacket pocket, grabbed the remaining flares, and headed outside. The cold night air bit into me again, but the space where the rusty gate had been was still filled with old junk and abandoned cars. I needed to find another way out, but I couldn't see any clear paths.

I turned back toward the guardhouse and saw the old man standing in the broken window frame, his silhouette framed by the dim light of the room behind him. His eyes gleamed with a cold fire as he watched me.

I didn't wait for him to make the first move. I raised the flare gun and fired. A brilliant red light shot out, illuminating the junkyard in a fiery glow. The flare arced through the air, and for a brief moment, I saw everything clearly—the old cars, the piles of twisted metal, and the shadows stretching long and far, writhing as if they were alive.

The old man let out a shriek, covering his eyes and recoiling into the darkness. I seized my chance and ran, following the path the flare lit up, scrambling over car hoods and piles of debris, moving as fast as my legs could carry me.

I reached the edge of the junkyard and found an old, chain-link fence half-buried in rusted car parts. The flare’s light was starting to fade, and I could feel the darkness creeping back in, thicker and more suffocating than before. I grabbed onto the fence and started to climb, the rough metal biting into my hands, but I didn’t care. I just needed to get out.

Behind me, the shadows surged, but I reached the top of the fence and jumped down on the other side. My feet hit the ground hard, and I stumbled, pain shooting up my leg. But I kept running, the flare gun clutched tightly in my hand.

Finally, I burst through a gap between two old shipping containers, finding myself on an old dirt road. I turned back one last time, seeing the junkyard now almost completely swallowed by the dark, with only the faint red glow of the flare still lingering. The old man’s silhouette stood on the other side of the fence, staring at me with those cold, piercing eyes, but he made no move to follow.

As I staggered down the road, I checked my phone again. This time, there was a faint signal. I dialed the emergency number with shaking hands, breathless as I tried to explain what had happened. But even as I spoke, I knew they wouldn’t believe half of what I said. Hell, I barely believed it myself.

But I was alive. And when I finally saw the headlights of a patrol car cutting through the night, I knew I had made it out.

As the police questioned me and looked over the junkyard, they found nothing unusual—no old man, no tunnels, just a run-down place filled with rusting cars and broken machinery. They chalked it up to stress and a bad night on the job.

But I knew better. I kept the old key, and I never went near that side of town again.
