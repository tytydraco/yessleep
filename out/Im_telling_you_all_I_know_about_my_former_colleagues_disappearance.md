I’m fine, ok? Finally, Human Resources seems to believe me. They’re interviewed me a bunch of times, the police too, about what happened that night- Jack's last evening at our workplace- or anywhere else, seems like. And HR is convinced I won’t be suing them.

Why should I? Nothing happened, ok? I’m fine! And I have no idea where Jack, my former co-worker is.

I’ll tell you exactly what happened that evening. I’ll even go back, from the first time I laid eyes on Jack, right in this office.

He was a new hire and we had one of those god-awful “ice-breakers” where we were paired and had to tell something about ourselves that the other could never guess. I trotted out my fail-safe line first.

“I went bungee-jumping for my twentieth birthday!”

Jack smiled politely without showing any teeth. “Really? Cool. I’m a werewolf.”

I have many years of experience in people-oriented positions, and my decorum did not falter. “Interesting- do you go to Comic-Con? I’ve heard our city has one of the biggest in the region.”

Jack drew his eyebrows together, which I couldn’t help noticing were somewhat thicker and bushier than normal.

“I don’t cosplay- I'm a real werewolf” he replied.

I didn’t know what to say. Fortunately the facilitator called out. “Ok everyone, time’s up! Let’s get into groups-”

We had to work together a lot. Towards the end of one meeting, as we closed their laptops and wheeled our chairs back from the work station, I remarked idly that I hoped we have good weather for the weekend.

“Honestly, I turn when the moon is full regardless of weather. The clouds make no difference.”

I felt like dying. I gripped my laptop and looked away.

Jack continued, “Although, the hunt is easier on cloudy nights.” He was standing with his back to me, staring out of the tall office windows. I mumbled something –can't remember what- and fled the room.

Next month I was again sequestered with him in one of the top floor meeting rooms. I told myself if he made another werewolf reference, I would email HR. It was weird and had no place in professional engagements.

But the meeting went very well, and I found myself warming to him. He was certainly competent. Towards the end, we were chatting like old friends, and stepped in the elevator together.

The elevator just started the long descent when it jolted horribly, and ground to a halt. We stared at each other, and once again I couldn’t help noticing the bushiness around his eyebrows and forehead, which before had seemed to conceal what I caught only now, a yellowish tinge in his eyes.

I slumped back in a corner. My heart was racing.

Soon a voice crackled through the intercom. Help was on the way, but there was a shortage of the parts needed, and it was rush hour. We had to brace ourselves for several hours of waiting.

We remained mostly silent. There was nothing to be said. I think I dozed off, then jerked awake, my body aching horribly. I glanced at my phone, on 1%. It was11:32pm.

Jack spoke. “You know I’m going to turn at midnight?”

I raised my head. I knew I should feel frightened, but my main emotion was extreme fatigue. “Will you kill me?”

Jack shrugged. “I haven’t eaten for hours. I’m hungry. But I don’t typically hunt humans.”

Tears welled out of my eyes despite myself. I could feel them, scalding hot, it seemed, rolling down my face. “Please Jack. I have family.”

Jack said nothing.

At 12:12 am, the workmen opened the elevator door, raising their flashlights. I shielded my eyes from the blinding light.

A big bounding creature knocked them over, a shadow heading straight for the stairwells.

I staggered to my feet. The workmen rose too, and laid their eyes on me, alone in the elevator, dishevelled and filthy, but I was calm.

I don’t know what happened to Jack, who was never seen at that office, ever again. Now leave me alone. I have a group of new hires who aren’t going to orient themselves.
