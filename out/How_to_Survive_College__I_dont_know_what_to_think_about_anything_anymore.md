It’s confirmed.  Something is wiping out my conversations with Grayson.  I’m glad I made it home and wrote down the last one right away, because the only reason I remember it right now is because I reread my last post.  Yes, I am seriously freaking out about this.  This means that not only is the Forgetter somehow getting access to me despite living off campus, but it is also ignoring Grayson’s warning from the prior year.  Either Grayson is losing his authority on campus (very possible) or the Forgetter is a lot more powerful than I thought.

Or both could be true.  That would suck.

I called Grayson up and asked if we could talk.  We’re just friends now.  I can talk to him about these things.

I asked him if I had a tendency to repeat conversations.

“You told me you were forgetful,” he added, after he confirmed that I did.

First off, wow, I told him that last year when I was panicking about finishing an assignment I’d forgotten about before the devil felt it necessary to intervene.  I’m a little surprised that he remembered and also interpreted it to mean that I was forgetful enough to not remember very important conversations we’d had.  Which I clarified to him.

“Normal forgetful!” I said.  “Assignment due dates!”

“So repeating conversations isn’t normal.”

“No.  It isn’t.  Has this been going on for a while?”

He told me that it’s increased in frequency, starting sometime last year in the spring semester.  He assumed it was mostly due to stress, as I’m starting to hit the harder classes in my degree program and am having to think about big decisions like internships and what I was going to do after I graduated.  Some of the conversations also felt like they could have been continuations of the prior one, just with some details repeated, and he didn’t feel it was significant enough to bring up.

“I need you to start telling me whenever I’m repeating myself,” I said urgently.  “I think the creature that makes people forget things is responsible for this.  I have no idea how it’s getting to me.  Can it leave campus?”

A long pause.

“It can,” he said quietly.  “It’s not coming after you though.”

“But I’m forgetting-!”

“Some things,” he interrupted.  “You’re forgetting *some* things.  Not everything.”

That stopped me cold.  My stomach twisted into an uncomfortable knot.  Cassie didn’t even remember her former roommate existed.  If it really was the Forgetter, then wouldn’t I have forgotten about Grayson and his dad?  The tree?  Everything that’s happened to me and my friends so far?

I’m just forgetting the things about Grayson.  The important things, like what’s happening to his dad and his relationship with the university.

“Is there something else protecting this college?” I asked.  “Something that wouldn’t want me to help you?”

“I think you already know the answer to that,” he replied.

The tree.  The damn tree, the one in the graveyard, the one whose roots are spreading everywhere.  I think it’s time to bring in the full team to figure out this problem.  Maria might be distracted by keeping the Folklore Society out of trouble (which might be extra hard if my theory about them being here to attract the monsters is correct) but I’ve still got Cassie in my corner.  I told Grayson I’d see what I could find out about the tree and then went to fill Cassie in on our problem.

Also I need to tell you what happened when I told Cassie about the incident with the garbage hill because damn it was savage.

“So there’s a sentient trash pile on campus,” I announced to Cassie as soon as I was home.

She didn’t even look at me.

“What, your ex came back from the dead?”

It was a good minute before I recovered my wits.  How do you follow that up?  You can’t.  I’m glad our friendship has progressed to the point where she can casually roast my dead ex-boyfriend like that.

Anyway, she’s been helping me spread rumors about the sledding tradition.  Not a word about the hill trying to eat people.  Instead, she’s telling folks that there’s debris buried in it and someone wiped out on it and broke both legs - badly.  It helps that the person who broke both legs is back on campus in a wheelchair and while she doesn’t remember exactly what happened, she’s confirming the story that yes, there was an accident on the hill and that’s how it happened.  We might be stupid college students that do stupid things but we’re still American and no one wants to risk crushing medical debt on top of student loans.  That’s a recipe for being in debt for the rest of your life and never being able to own a home or happiness ever.

It’s the best we can do.  Besides, in Cassie’s opinion we’ve got bigger problems to deal with.  I filled her in about the whole forgetting things to do with Grayson and she’s decided we need to deal with that first and foremost.  I think it bothers her that I’m forgetting things like she did.  Like.  Bothering her more than I expected it to.  She looked like she was about to cry there when I told her and then she got angry, but it wasn’t at me, and finally she calmed down and came up with a plan.

We’re going to run an experiment.  I remember my last important conversation with Grayson because I re-read it.  For the next week, I’m going to avoid Grayson.  I already let him know what we’re doing and why.  He agreed, saying if that’s what I wanted to do, then he’ll support it.  I’m going to have no contact with him and at the end of the week Cassie will check to see if I still remember the conversation.  After that, I’ll go hangout with Grayson as I usually do, and at the end of *that* week Cassie will check again.

I’m scared to find out what the results of this will be.  I’m not sure I’d be going through with it if it weren’t for Cassie’s insistence.  Because what if it is Grayson?  What if he’s the trigger?

Right now it’s looking like he might be.  We’re starting the second week and I still remember.  I haven’t talked to him yet.  I’m not sure when I’ll be able to.  But I wanted to type all this up in case I forget… because something very important happened.

Grayson did want a way to contact me, in case something urgent happened, so Cassie made sure he had her phone number and he could contact her instead.  Which he did.  And Cassie, reluctantly, knocked on the door of my room to let me know we had a problem.  It was in the evening, not so late that campus was quiet, but late enough that the sun had set.  It was an overcast day and the moon wasn’t visible from behind the low-hanging clouds that had settled over campus like a shroud.

“Grayson’s dad is missing,” she said.  “He didn’t come home from the office today.”

The flickering man would have found him in the past.  Found him and taken him to Grayson.  I wanted to throw up and for a moment I wasn’t hearing what Cassie was saying to me.  I was just thinking of the pavement and how it looked with the water pooling on it.  That’s all.  Just the texture of the sidewalk.

“Let’s go together,” she was saying when my head cleared.  “I’m worried about you going alone.”

“Yeah,” I said, still feeling like I wasn’t fully there, “that sounds good.”

Then I got up, got my shoes, jacket, and umbrella, and it wasn’t until we were crossing the street to campus that I finally came fully back to myself.  Cassie was asking me if I knew where we should start.  Grayson was going to stay close to his house in case his dad made it home.  He’d search the surrounding neighborhood and periodically check back at the house.  Cassie and I would look around campus.  Campus security was also searching, but Grayson had his doubts that they’d be effective and that was why he’d contacted us.  His pessimism was understandable.  They didn’t know what was going on with the university president and so Grayson had to make it sound like he was just out of the loop of where his dad was.  It was possible campus security would find him, tell him his son was looking for him, and then leave him wherever he was.

He’d tried not to tell Cassie what was really going on, even.  Cassie told me as we walked towards the administration building that he’d only said there was an emergency, then when she held firm he said it was with his dad, and didn’t admit to anything else until Cassie told him she already knew.  After that he was willing to tell her *everything* about the situation.

“Was he angry?” I asked anxiously.

“Nope,” she replied immediately.  “Didn’t seem to mind at all.  I told him I had to know if our experiment was going to work.”

So that’s reassuring.  He hadn’t explicitly told me to keep this between us but he also hadn’t given me permission to tell anyone.  I just… did because I was panicking a little bit and needed some help.  I’m still not used to relying on people for things.  Like it’s always been just my family and we had appearances to keep up so we didn’t let people outside the family know how hard it was.  Outsiders with no blood ties weren’t to be trusted.  They were gossips and voyeurs.  Surely none of them would *actually* be genuine in their offers to help.

Looking back, I wonder if that was actually true, or just a consequence of my mother’s desire to shelter us from the rest of the town.  Her affair became common knowledge, after all, and small towns can be vicious.

So it just feels wild to me that Grayson would trust Cassie because I trust her.

We started our search at the administration building.  I checked at the front desk first, telling them that Grayson was wondering where his dad was and I’d volunteered to check his office first.  The student at the front desk reluctantly made a call to the president’s secretary, clearly doubting that we had any legitimate reason to be asking, and then informed us (with more surprise than skepticism) that the secretary confirmed he’d left for the day.

After that we followed the path that he would have taken to the nearest parking lot.  We found his car from the license plate that Grayson had given us.  Still there.  Cassie glanced back and forth across the parking lot, as if she’d see him just standing around waiting for us to discover him.

“Now what?” she asked.  “Do we follow the route he’d take towards Grayson’s house if he was going on foot?”

“I feel like we’re long past the point where he would have made it home on foot,” I said, thinking hard.  “Otherwise Grayson wouldn’t have called in a panic.”

“So we search campus.”

We’d go methodically, I suggested.  Sweep back and forth, starting from the administration building.  I suggested splitting up so we could each cover one half of campus, but Cassie quickly shot that down.  We’d stick together.

Also she didn’t know what Grayson’s dad looked like.

My hopes were pretty thin that we’d find him, but I felt we had to try.  This might not be Grayson’s real dad and while I no longer thought that Grayson loved him, it was clear that he felt *responsible* for his condition and was trying his best to take care of him during his deterioration.  I guess I can understand that.  I know that it’s not my fault that things have happened like they did on campus.  It’s not my fault what happened to Patricia or Steven or anyone else, but I still feel like I have to do something so it doesn’t happen to others.  Grayson can’t walk away either.  This was foisted on him and he’s trying to make it better in whatever small way he can.

We walked and walked.  Occasionally we saw someone from campus security also walking out on the sidewalks, but it didn’t seem to me like they were deliberately searching.  More like they were dutifully out looking, but without a real plan and without a sense of urgency.  I unconsciously picked up my pace until Cassie told me to calm down, that panicking wasn’t going to help and I was going to walk her into the dirt if I didn’t slow down.

Then, to make matters better, it began to rain.  It quickly became a steady rainfall, not a downpour, but enough to quickly coat the sidewalks in a glistening sheen underneath the streetlights.  Visibility dropped even further and Cassie insisted we slow down even more, so that she could make sure he hadn’t wandered off the sidewalk or between buildings where he would be easier to miss.

“What do I tell him?” I said fretfully.  “Sorry Grayson, but we lost your dad.”

“You didn’t lose him,” Cassie snapped.  “And once we hit the other end of campus we call him up and tell him it’s time to involve the police.”

“But-”

“STOP.”

Her tone cut through me like ice.

“He is not your ex,” she continued.  “He’s not going to get upset because you’re not a mind-reader or a goddamn miracle worker here.  And if he does, I will *end him.*  Now take a deep breath.”

I did as she said.  4 seconds in, 4 seconds hold, 6 seconds out.  Just like my therapist had told me during our handful of sessions.  I was focusing on this when Cassie put out an arm to stop me.

“Look,” she said urgently.  “Does that seem weird to you?”

She was staring at the ground.  It took me a moment to realize what she was seeing.

The water on the ground.  It was moving.  Flowing, like a stream.

Flowing uphill.

And I knew exactly where it was going.

“The graveyard,” I whispered with growing horror.  “That’s where he is!”

Cassie was asking what I was talking about, but I wasn’t listening to her anymore.  I began to run.  I abandoned my umbrella and ran.  From the sound of footsteps behind me, Cassie was following suit, no longer trying to ask what was going on.  She was trusting that I knew what was going on and following me, knowing that there would be time for explanations later.

It had to be the graveyard.  That was the direction the water was flowing.  Towards the center of campus.

And that was where the tree was, waiting to drink him up.

The gate to the cemetery was hanging wide open.  My heart sank in dread as we rounded the corner and saw it drifting in the wind, glistening in the electric lights.  Beyond it stretched the graveyard, wreathed in an almost impenetrable darkness, the headstones brooding shapes in the gloom.  I came to a halt just outside the boundary and stared into the cemetery, straining my eyes to locate any sign of movement.

“You’re not actually going in there, are you?” Cassie panted as she caught up.

“I think he’s in there,” I whispered.

“But the groundskeeper…”

“I know!”

I took a deep breath.  Of the two of us, I was better suited for this.  I grew up in a rural area.  I knew how to navigate a dark forest.  And if our flight here was any indication, I was certainly a better runner than Cassie.

My legs didn’t want to move.  They felt like they were made of lead.

“He’s not worth it,” Cassie said.  “He’s already dead.  You said so yourself.”

Already dead… and not worth risking my life over.

But this wasn’t just about Grayson’s dad.

“I feel like everything is pointing towards this tree,” I said quietly.  “There’s been… signs.”

And by signs I mean the devil contriving a reason for me to go into the graveyard.  I don’t think that was entirely because he enjoys sowing chaos.  He does, he totally does, but there is also a purpose behind his actions.  I *know* this.

“I don’t know if the tree is responsible for what’s happening to me,” I continued, “but I see its roots everywhere.  I think it’s hurting Grayson.  I don’t know if it’s protecting campus or hurting the college or maybe it’s just another entity with no real purpose… but I’m not going to find out standing out here.”

Cassie swore under her breath.

“I’m going with you.  We can watch out for the groundskeeper together.”

I started to protest but Cassie didn’t let me.  She just… walked into the graveyard.  I wanted to tell her no, that I’d already made this mistake, that I trusted Steven and I was wrong and he died.  That I couldn’t bear to go through that again.  She didn’t give me a chance.  She was inside the graveyard before I could speak and then it was too late, because the only thing worse than her going inside would be making a scene *inside* the graveyard boundaries.  I feel like that would attract the groundskeeper’s attention.

I followed her.  What choice did I have?  My heart was pounding and I wanted nothing more than to curl up on the muddy ground and stay there until I died, but Cassie was moving resolutely forward, walking carefully on the slick paving stones.  At one point she reached back and I took her hand and just that small connection, the feel of her palm against mine - starkly warm in the cold rain - gave me some small measure of courage.  I wasn’t doing this alone.  And if we saw the groundskeeper, well, I’d drag her with me as I ran for the exit if I had to.  It’d be different this time.

The tree was easy to find even in the darkness.  It stood starkly against the dark sky, without form or definition, like a paper cutout.  We made our way towards it.  Both of us were scanning the graveyard and Cassie would periodically pause to look behind as well.  The groundskeeper was slow.  We had that in our favor, at least.  The rain seemed to be lessening as well and I could hear even the distant creaking of the trees branches from underneath the pattering of the raindrops.

“There,” Cassie hissed, pointing.  “Is that the president or the grounds keeper?”

He stood a short distance ahead, a few rows of headstones over.  It was the president.  The groundskeeper is way more intimidating in stature.  We picked our way over, watching our steps.  I edged up to him, calling out so I wouldn’t inadvertently sneak up and startle him.  He didn’t turn to look at me.  His gaze was fixed on the headstone.

“Is that… your grave?” I ventured.

“It *should* be,” he said.  “He purchased a plot and had the headstone made but they never put a body in the ground and never engraved a date.”

There was a flash of light behind me.  I flinched.  Cassie had taken a photo of it and had to use flash in the darkness.  The president didn’t seem to care, but I had to hope it wouldn’t attract the attention of the groundskeeper.

“You seem a bit more with it right now,” I ventured.

“The graveyard does that for me.  That’s why they keep me out of it, you know.”

They.  They they they.  The administration?  I had my doubts.  The flickering man?

Grayson?

He turned and began walking towards the exit.  Cassie and I quickly followed.

“We need to get you two out of here,” he said firmly.  “Shouldn’t have used flash.”

“Sorry,” Cassie said.  “But I don’t think we could find that headstone again in the daylight.”

“Who made you like this?” I demanded.  “Is it the tree?”

The gate was just ahead, hanging wide open.  I thought we’d gone further inside than this.  My heart pounded in my chest.  I wanted answers and something told me that once we passed that gate I’d lose my chance.  He wasn’t answering, not right away.  He tilted his head as he walked, considering his answer, while everything inside me was screaming to *please*, just tell me something, even if it wasn’t the answer to the question I’d asked.

“The tree isn’t the cause,” he said thoughtfully.  I could tell he was slipping away again.  “It was a… reaction.  When they realized what was happening.”

We were at the gate.  Beside me, Cassie made a small, strangled sound of dismay.

The river.  The traveling river had arrived while we were inside.

It flowed around the graveyard.  I stared at it in dismay, tracing its course as it wrapped around the fence of the cemetery, curving around to hug the corners and encircle it like a moat.  The water was choppy.  Agitated.  It spanned wide, far too wide for us to jump or maybe even swim.  Like it was trying to cover the whole of campus.

I glanced behind us, afraid of what I’d see.  It was so hard to make out details in the darkness.  Was that figure a headstone or was it the hunched form of the groundskeeper making its slow progress towards us?  My skin was icy cold from both the rain and fear.

“Thank you,” Grayson’s dad said, turning to me.  He was smiling sadly.  “You didn’t have to come after me.”

“It was nothing,” I replied automatically.  I wasn’t really listening.  I was staring at the river and wondering what we could do now, cut off by its expanse.

“It was *everything*,” he replied, still smiling.  “Listen.  It’s not the body that’s the problem here.  It’s the *soul*.  They haven’t gotten a replacement in a while.  Got too greedy there and tried to do something different.  I don’t know if they’ve got one in mind or if they’re finally putting an end to this charade… but with this last bit of lucidity I have, I’m going to make sure they’re not able to trap anyone else.”

I opened my mouth to speak.  To ask who it was that I was talking to.  Whose soul.  Beside me, Cassie said with relief that the river was receding, but I wasn’t listening to her.  I was staring at the president’s body and the person inside, who turned away from me, still smiling…

…and threw himself into the river.

He swam down, straight down, and vanished into the darkness.

The river raced away from us, like a snake fleeing the shadow of a hawk, convulsing on itself like it was trying to spit him back out.  It was too late.  He was too far down.  Too determined.

And there are things in the river that have a mind and a hunger of their own.

He was gone.

The river gave up, flattening out as if in exhaustion, and then it became a puddle - glistening darkly like a slab of stone - and then it was gone.  Nothing but water on the soaked earth, slowly sinking into the ground.

“What the hell just happened?” Cassie asked from beside me after a long moment of silence.

Yeah.  My thoughts exactly.

Cassie told Grayson what happened.  He sounded defeated on the phone, she said.  Like he hadn’t expected a good outcome all along.  He asked that we not talk about this with anyone for now.  He had to figure out what to do.  The university needed a president, after all.  Then he hung up and hasn’t called back.  He won’t answer Cassie’s calls, either.  I want to tell him to forget it, to let the university flounder, that he doesn’t owe them *anything*.  I *will* tell him that, when I next talk to him.

But before that, I’m writing all of this down and telling you.

I need to remember [what](https://alderrayne.com/) [happened](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/).
