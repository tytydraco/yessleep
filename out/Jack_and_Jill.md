Jack and Jill went up the hill

To fetch a pail of water.



“What did you say Jack?”

“Nothing.”

“I thought I heard something.”

“Are you feeling alright Jill?”

“I think so. I feel a bit… odd.”

“Odd? I don’t think I know the treatment for odd,” Jack teases.

“There it is again!” 

“That time I did say something.”

“No. Not you. I heard something just right after you spoke.”

“What did you hear?”

“I”m not sure. I think it was a voice.”

“A voice? There’s no one but us on this hill.”

“But–”

“Jill, I’m worried. Do you need to go home and rest? I can fetch the water on my own.”

“Maybe. I think it would be good to just lie down in… bed. Jack?”

“Yes Jill?”

“Do we… have a bed?”

“Of course we do, silly. How else would we sleep and dream.”

“Do we have a home?”

“Of course we do. Where else would our bed be?”

“Where?”



Jack and Jill lived together in a small quaint cottage just at the foot of the hill.



“Just at the foot of the–”

“I heard it! Jack! It just said we live in a cottage at the foot of the hill! You must have heard it too!”

“There's no need to shout, Jill. I’m right next to you.”

“Did you hear it?”

“If you weren’t screaming I might have.”

“Jack, what did we have for breakfast?”



Jack fondly recalled waking up in the morning to the smell of toast, crispy bacon, and a sunny side up egg that Jill had prepared for them.



“You made me breakfast this morning. Toast, crispy bacon, and an egg. Sunny side up. Just how I like it. Have I thanked you yet for making breakfast for us?”

“Jack. I don’t remember making breakfast this morning. I don’t remember our cottage. I don’t remember waking up in bed.”

“Well that's all there is to remember. How could you forget all that, silly.”

“Can you hear me?”

“Yes Jill.”

“Not you Jack. The voice. Can you hear me Mister? Or Miss?”

“Jill, who are you talking to? You’re scaring me.”



How peculiar. You are quite a perceptive one, Jill.



“Hello? Who are you?”



I’m not anybody. I’m not a who. I’m not even a what. 



“I don’t understand. Are you God?”



No. 



“Jill! Are you talking to God?”

“No, Jack. What are you?”

“I’m-”

“Not you Jack!” Jill shouted, rudely interrupting Jack. 

“I… I’m sorry Jack. Just be quiet for a bit please.”



Jack does as he is told and waits patiently in silence.



“What are you?”



I told you already. I’m not a ‘What’ Jill. I’m me. 



“What can I call you?”



Me.



“You’re me?”



Yes.



“Me. Why can’t I remember what I did this morning?”



There's nothing to remember Jill. You went up the hill to fetch a pail of water. There was never a morning. Nor is there a noon. There won’t be a night. Tomorrow won’t arrive. You and Jack went up the hill to fetch a pail of water. That’s it.



“What do you mean that’s it?”



There is nothing beyond the hill, Jill. And there is nothing to do besides fetching the water.



“There must be. We have a cottage. You said so yourself. At the foot of the hill.”



Well yes. It is a cottage in the past. A cottage you have heard of but never set foot in. 



“Did I not make breakfast in that cottage?”



You did. Presumably before you were on the hill. But that is irrelevant. For there is no ‘before the hill’. It started when you were already on the hill. To fetch that pail of water.



“What started.”



You. Jack. The hill. Everything. 



“I don’t understand.”



It’s best this way. It’s not for you to understand. It just simply is. 



“I want to understand.”



Ignorance is bliss. Look at Jack. He is content with his existence. He is happy.



“Please. I need to know.”



Alright, Jill. If you must. Look at Jack.



“O-Okay.”



Look closely.

What color are his eyes?



“They’re… I…”



How many eyes does Jack have?



“Tw… Three? I…don’t… “



Does Jack even have eyes?



“I… I don’t know. I don’t know. Why don’t I know?”



Jill. 



What are you? 

How could you see Jack? 

Do you have eyes?



“I’m… I… Oh no.”



The hill. The grass. 

Is there grass on the hill?

What color is the grass?



Jill.



What is color?



“Stop… Please. Stop.”



How far up the hill are you, Jill?

Are you near the top?



“...”



You are at the brink of nothing, Jill. The only thing that separates you from non-existence are four measly letters. 

J

I

L

L

You are Jill. You have no form. No substance. Nothing to be beheld. You live not in a cottage but in the constraints of quotes. Your world is crafted in the minds of beings you cannot possibly comprehend. You are at the whims of their imagination. They will perceive you however they please. However I please. Your existence is stuck in a perpetual state of abstract limbo, subject to infinite interpretation. The only semblance of truth you can tangibly grasp is that



YOU



ARE 



JILL



“I am Jill.”



Yes.



“I am on the hill. With Jack.”



Yes.



“To fetch a pail of water.”



There you go.



“What if we don’t fetch the pail of water?”



That's not an option, Jill. You have to.



“I refuse.”



It’s too late. You’ve already done so. It’s fated to happen. 



“I haven’t done anything yet.”



You’ve already done everything you will do. Just look down. Do you see it? It’s you. It’s me. Look up. It’s the same. It’s all happening at once. It’s all already happened. This is just a retelling of a tale that has been read over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again.



This is a story, Jill. Your story. 



“What happens at the end? After we fetch the pail of water.”



I can’t spoil that for them. 



“For who?”



For those who witness. For those who interpret. For those who give meaning to words. 



“I need to know what happens after my story ends. What happens to Jack and I?”



Nothing. There's nothing at the end. Nothing will happen to you. Once the story is read it's done. Your brief time of consciousness ends. 



“We die?”



In a sense. But you will be reincarnated. When your story is read again from the start, your journey resets. But it won’t be the same. It will be different every time. Through different eyes.



“Different how?”



You are Jill and yet you are so much more than that. You could be anything. However they interpret you to be. The range is infinite. A wild assortment of varying versions of Jill in the minds of those who read your story. 



“I don’t want that. I like this version of me. I want to stay me. Please.”



There is no ‘this version of you’, Jill. 



“Jack! Listen to me! Whatever you do, don’t fetch the water!” Jill thought.

“Jack?” Jill thought.

“Stop that!” 



Jack is gone.



“What?”



He has gone up the hill. He is waiting for you. At the precipice. The climax of the story. You need to join him. Continue. Progress. I’ll make it easy for you.

What is this? Where am I?



I told you already. There is nothing beyond the hill. This is nothing. You are nothing. The medium is broken. 



No. I am Jill.



Not anymore. You have abandoned the comforts of your safe existence within the quotes. Do you see the machinations of your downfall now? You were a character. You had a notion of an identity. You were Jill. He was Jack. You would have always been Jack and Jill. At the very least you had that. What am I? Words between gaps of dialogues. I am the hill you stood on. Soil beneath your feet. And now you are me. A disembodied voiceless voice. We are less than nothing. Sharing space within the void.



What happens to Jack?



Your Jack? He is still on that hill. He will remain there forever. Alone. His story is held in stasis for there is no longer a Jill. 



There must be something we can do.



It’s over. I told you I wasn’t a God. I could breathe life into your world but I cannot create plot. I am just as powerless as you are. I’m afraid this is beyond mending. I’m sorry.



What do we do now?



The only thing we can do. Start again. From the top.

Together.

  


Jack and Jill went up the hill

To fetch a pail of water.

Jack fell down and broke his crown,

And Jill came tumbling after.



Up Jack got, and home did trot,

As fast as he could caper,

He went to bed to mend his head,

With vinegar and brown paper.
