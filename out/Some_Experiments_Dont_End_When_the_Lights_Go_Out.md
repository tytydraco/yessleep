I thought it was a good deal, this research job. 



The email came to me on one of the days I called *pissdays,* when I was home and curled up under a blanket hugging my knees, the world outside lit in piss yellow, too lifeless to even attempt venturing out in. I was starting to have a lot of pissdays, at that point— people will tell you in medical school that psych residents have it the best, that our jobs are nothing but glorified social work where we *ihearyou*’d and *sohowdoesthatmakeyoufeel*’d our way through the day, taking breaks only to hand out benzos like candy. No blood and guts and glory. Not real medicine— except I’d been spat on, kicked, and cussed out more than even the gnarliest emergency med guy could claim. Hell, I’d had someone try and strangulate me with my own stethoscope, something my attending at the time told me was a rookie mistake. *Nothing that can be coiled around the neck on rounds, unless you’re really stupid or really optimistic.*

  


I don’t think I ever really figured out which one I was. 



Anyway, let’s get back to the point— the job. A salary that would make a significant— *significant*—contribution to the debt I’d racked up in my four years of med school. Not too long term, which meant I could look for a nice stable attending job in a nice stable city— where the apartments didn’t have grills on the windows and sirens running past all hours of the day. All I had to do was observe, take notes, and type it all up in a nice summary at the end. Easy stuff. The only catch was that it was more of a 24-hour job— 12 hours of official work a day, where I had to be on-site and working, and 12 hours where I would have to be available on call for any emergencies, in a cute little place they’d set up for me right next door. Not a big deal, right? I’d been through worse in residency. 



Besides, I was sick of pissdays.

The site wasn’t remarkable— a drab brown building at the edge of the city, unmarked, unremarkable. They dropped me there themselves, handled the luggage. Attending lifestyle, hey? It almost makes the slog worth it.



Inside, it was just as bare-bones— one room where I’d be staying, one room where the subject I was observing would be confined in. Glass between them, the supervisor told me, and I’d be able to hear everything the subject said. A door on the edge of the stretch of glass, if I needed to rush in and intervene. A workstation to type up notes. A stethoscope that I couldn’t help notice— looped neatly on the desk. A camera, glowing red in the far corner— protocol to prove the study had been done in good faith, with no bias, and with all those humane considerations they only realised they had to afford people after the Stanford Prison experiment. 



On the wall was a set of instructions to repeat what the supervisor had told me, cold and icy-blonde. *Observe, but do not engage. Unless the subject is trying to harm themselves or you, do not engage. Take conscientious notes, but do not engage.* 

  


Point taken.

  


“What’s the diagnosis?” I’d asked as she turned to leave, but she’d only smiled wryly at me before shutting the door.



“Isn’t that what you’re here for?”



I settled at the desk, flipped open the laptop and typed up a framework— always made it easier to take notes. *Behaviour, mood, sleep*. The bare bones of psychiatry.



The subject came in through a door on the other side of the glass, a short, plump man of about 40. He was missing a circle of hair on the top of his head, which didn’t seem to bother him. He wore a pair of silver-rimmed glasses, which he adjusted absentmindedly as he came in. 



But what I hurried to type up was this— he wore pristine navy scrubs, and a spotless white coat on top of them. A *doctor’s* coat. 

I realised instantly what I was working with— a delusion, possibly nestled in a web of other conditions like schizophrenia or mood disorders. This man thought he was a physician, believed it was true against every scrap of proof the world showed him. He would see patient charts in grocery lists, lifesaving drugs in the detergent aisle. His brain strained against the bounds of rationality that told him what he knew, and put up technicolor pictures of what it thought *it* knew. 



I could work with this. I’d done it a hundred times already.

I settled in my chair.



Behaviour, mood, sleep. The framework blinked back at me from the computer screen, and I struggled to think of anything to put down. So far, it had been a dull two hours— the subject had settled into his chair at an identical work desk, opened up an identical laptop, and done little else. I realised the room on the other side of the glass was an exact replica of the one I sat on, down to the peeling piss-coloured paint on the walls and the camera in the corner.



*Mirror images.*



Just as I was settling into my thoughts, he moved, slowly and deliberately. Almost like he could sense me watching, he looked up at the glass, right at me, and smiled. A friendly smile, and toothy.



“Good evening. I’m Dr. Claus Wash. I’ll be looking after you for a few days.”



*Subject introduces themself as physician*, I typed up. *Friendly and eager to connect.*



“Do you want to look at me when I’m here? I don’t think I’m that ugly.”



I stopped typing, fingers frozen on the keyboard. It was a line I’d said about a hundred times myself when I went into a patient’s room— something quippy and direct, to break the ice. *I don’t think I’m that ugly,* I’d say, and if I got a laugh I usually got through to them within the day.



“Where did you hear that?” I asked in spite of myself, realising as I said it that I’d broken the rule. *Do not engage*. 



The man smiled again, his eyes lighting up with genuine good humour. “It’s something I came up with myself. Helps me connect. Patient is a person, and all that.”



I bit down a reply. I was here to observe. Hell, they probably said that line in a hundred hospitals a hundred times a day, where a hundred guys like him spent months hearing it in the psych ward. I guessed if I was that original, I’d be writing for Saturday Night Live instead of doing what I did. 



As I watched, he sat down at the workstation again, and took rapid notes, his fingers flying on the keyboard. *Possible manic features*, I noted down myself, just as he turned and slammed the lid of the laptop shut, apparently satisfied.



“Where did you go to med school?” he chirped. I didn’t respond, and he shrugged, unperturbed. “I went to Cedar Falls. Not exactly Harvard, but not too bad either. Inner city, sketchy kind of place, but cheaper than the rest. Of course, I am still eyeballs-deep in debt…”



I sat up straighter, trying to mask the twinge of anxiety that crept up in me. Cedar Falls wasn’t exactly a well-known school, and it was in the middle of nowhere. I hadn’t gone there, but my fiancée at the time had, and I’d spent every weekend driving through shady lanes cutting red lights to visit her. 



How did he know about Cedar Falls?



For the first time, I noticed that he was mimicking my every movement, the way he held his head, half-cocked as he spoke, the way he ran his fingers through his beard every time I did. I tried to settle back in my chair, telling myself it was nothing, just one of the many kinds of mirroring patients did. But every time I moved, he moved. Tilted his head, leaned forward, scratched his temple—the same motions, the same hesitation.



I typed quickly, forcing myself to focus on behaviour, mood, sleep. But I caught him glancing up again, a faint grin tugging at his mouth. He paused mid-keystroke, fingers hovering over the keyboard, and I swear he was reading my thoughts before I even formed them.



A soft click echoed from the camera in the corner. I glanced over. Red light. Watching. Recording. Always recording.



Then came the first unexplainable comment:



“Did it hurt? When he strangled you?”



I froze. 



This wasn’t mirroring, or a coincidence. This man knew something about me that he could never have known. 



I told myself I was imagining it. It was a slip. Maybe he’d heard someone else. But the chill ran down my spine, the first real creep of dread in the room, and I knew it was real.



As I watched, he stood up, toying with the stethoscope on his workstation, blue and gleaming. I couldn’t tear my eyes away.



“I want to do it too, you know? Sometimes I feel that rage boil up inside me, so hot and heavy it starts spilling out of my ears and nose and mouth, and I want to do it too.” I watched, slack jawed. *No.* They hadn’t told me I’d have to deal with this—



The camera in the corner blinked, red and ever-watchful. The stethoscope on my own table winked at me under the light, a coiled serpent the colour of a winter sky. 



“And there’s nothing stopping me from doing it to you.” The man grinned, walking right up to the glass, his face flush against it. “Right now. I could open this door and come right in—”



He turned the dooknob. 



*No. No.* 



I felt my cells scream with the memory of the last time— my lungs screaming for oxygen, my hands clawing desperately at the cord around my neck. The utter desperation as my vision began to pop with spots of black. Silence after, that big, dark, silence. 



I couldn’t have it done to me again.



In one fluid motion, I was at the door, the stethoscope flapping wildly in my hands as I ran. He entered the room like a predator with his eyes on only his meal, and missed me standing behind the door. I looped the cord around his neck, and I pulled.



And I pulled, and pulled, and pulled.



And suddenly, I wasn’t pulling anymore. It’s all white. White and soundless. My ears are ringing, like tiny hammers inside my skull. Every limb aches, and yet I feel stretched thin, untethered. I don’t know if I’m standing, sitting, or floating. The walls, the glass, the peeling piss-colored paint—they’re gone. Or maybe I am. 

I’ll tell you the truth. 



I owe it to you. 



Or maybe I owe it to myself.



My name is Lucas Shaw.



 I was a guy with a bright future. Straight A’s, soccer in high school, loved by everyone. An Ivy League undergrad, med school after that. I was angry sometimes, but controlled it. I never hit anyone.



 I had a girlfriend. Two and a half years. I proposed.



 She refused. Said she was scared—scared of me, scared of my anger. 



And then—I snapped. Her stethoscope. My hands. The tide of heat and blood. And it was over before I knew.



 I remember surrendering. Arrest. Life without parole. Then the brick. My memory shattered. Fragments of my life lost, doors locked behind my mind.



 Now… now they experiment on me. Observe me. Push me. Tear me down to watch what breaks first—my mind, my memories, my soul. I consent. I deserve it. Every day is a pissday. Every heartbeat is debt. 



But the red light… it never stops blinking. 



And sometimes, when I close my eyes, I see him—the mirrored face, the grin I once wore, the words I once said. Sometimes I think I’m watching myself. Sometimes I think he’s me. 



I don’t know anymore.



 I don’t think I’ll ever know.
