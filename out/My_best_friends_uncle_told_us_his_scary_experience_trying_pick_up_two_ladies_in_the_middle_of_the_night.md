The amount of scary stories I've read here inspired me to share this story I've heard from my best friends uncle..This was back in 2015 I was in 8th grade my best friend  Janet who was my best friend then and still today invited me to her house for lunch and that's when I met her uncle Timothy who came to visit them for the weekend..he was quiet throughout the meal and so Janet's dad asked if something is bothering him so he sat us all down and started telling us what he saw the previous night on his way to Janet's family home.

 Uncle Tim worked late and after his shift ended he didn't have the energy to drive all the way back to his house and since my best friend Janet's house was just a few miles from his workplace he decided to sleep there for the night and so he called and asked her dad If he can sleep there for the night and he agreed and even told him to stay for the weekend..now the road leading up to Janet's place was just forests and bushes and there's a small grave with 5 crucifix around it and it was placed there as a memory of the people that died in a burning bus that happened back in 2008..the bus carrying men women and children had an engine explosion which caused the bus to be on fire the driver  veered on the road and into the ditch. There were no survivors. The incident made headlines all over the country. 

Uncle Tim happened to be passing that place around 1: 30 in the morning when he suddenly saw two women who looked to be in their early 50s was waving at him to stop the car. Uncle Tim being a good gentleman stopped just a few meters away from them so that they can hop into his car and take them to their destination. It never once crossed his mind why two women at that age are waiting for a ride in the middle of the night he was only concerned for their safety..after a while he started to wonder what's taking these two women so long to walk to his car. When he looked at the side mirror they were walking in the normal pace after a few minutes when he looked at the side mirror again they were running to his car then he became confused because they should've reached his car already if they were running then he decided to look back like actually put his head outside to look at them and that's when he realized....there's nobody there..it was all Bush and forest but there's nobody there..he decided to sit back in his car and look at the rear view mirror and what he saw caused his soul to leave his body and made him shit himself like literally. The two women running towards his car...they were still running but this time THEY WERE ON FIRE..like their bodies were lit up in flames and they're running to his car. When he looked outside the place was empty and nobody is there but when he looked at the side mirror they were still running to him while in flames but this time they're getting closer and closer to his car..he was so scared to death that he just turned on his engines and sped away from that place

..Janet's family thought he sat on dog shit or something because of his smell and the stain on his pants so her mom told him to wash up. He never once said any word until lunch time the following day when he decided to sit us down and told us what happened and why he shit and peed himself. Uncle Tim knew about that place but he never thought something like that would happen. Janet's dad had similar experience but he knew better than to pick up people standing near that place especially if it's the middle of the night. Today (2022) some houses are now built around the area and people residing the area claim they still hear people calling out to vehicles to stop for them or even hear babies crying
