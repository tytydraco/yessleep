Part one. :) lemme know if y'all want to read more.

I woke to a strangely distant world. The edges of everything feathered and were distinctly *indistinct*. My eyes opened - I pried them open, as though a tacky glue had welded them shut. Like a newborn, I squinted into the harsh and sterile light above. I turned slightly, wincing as a dull ache radiated from my skull.

*White walls, white sheets, the sterile smell of antiseptic. A hospital, then?*

I tried to lift my hand towards my aching skull, but it felt foreign. A hazy, disorienting panic welled in my chest. A knowing uncertainty that only grew as I tried—and failed—to recall how I ended up in this bed, in this too-bright room.

*Where am I?*

Before the thought fully registered, something more unsettling pushed its way into my pulsating brain—

***Who*** *am I?*

The soft humming of machinery broke into the blank space where my memories should be. *The last thing I remember was…* No, there was nothing. Truly nothing. Only the present feeling of starched bedding, a pillow that encased my bandaged head, and the pulse in my neck.  I listened to the quiet beeping and watched my chest rise and fall. I felt myself fall into a dissociative trance as I searched the reaches of absolute nothingness in my mind.

My trance was broken by a door to the room opening with a soft click. A man walked in, tall, wearing a white coat that practically gleamed under the fluorescent lights. His hair was slicked back and neatly combed. He entered with a calm and practiced smile. He moved towards the bed, clipboard in hand, and pulled up a chair.

“Good morning,” he said, voice deep and gentle as a lamb. 

He broke eye contact to peer at the many machines beside and behind me. “How are you feeling?” I blinked at him, attempting to focus through the fog around my brain. The words tumbled out, too slippery to grasp.

“I…I don’t know. What happened?” My voice sounded scratchy and foreign like it belonged to someone else.

“You were in an accident,” he explained, tone careful and measured. “We’ve been monitoring you closely. It’s normal to feel a bit disoriented when you first wake up.”

I looked at his eyes, which were becoming clearer, trying to make sense of his words. 

*An accident? What kind of accident? Why couldn’t I remember anything?*

I searched for the words, and the right question, but was unsuccessful. He nodded, as if he was expecting my reaction, and moved closer, pulling the chair beside the bed. The sound of the metal legs scraping against the floor was oddly grounding. 

“You’ve been through a lot. Your body… and mind is still catching up. There’s no rush—take your time.”

I swallowed, my throat like the desert. I looked at the unfamiliar fabric draped over me, “I don’t remember anything.”

His expression softened, and his gaze fixated on mine. “That is perfectly normal. It is not uncommon after the kind of trauma you’ve experienced. The important thing, right now, is that you’re awake, and you’re here.” He settled into his chair with an ease that made the space between us feel smaller and more disarming. I saw him studying my blank expression as he took a breath.

“My name is Dr. Elias Walker.”

I tried to nod and the motion sent a wave of pain through my skull. My alien limb drifted to touch the bandage wrapped around my temples. My vision became unfocused.

“Will I remember?”

He smiled again. Something flickered behind his eyes, unnamed, and disappeared. 

“We’re hopeful.” His touch was light, non-invasive, and somehow comforting.

Dr. Walker stood up suddenly. “I’m going to check a few things,” he spoke, smile never wavering. “You should rest. Your body needs time to heal, and so does your mind.” I watched as he moved across the room, checking monitors and moving the IV drip, his movements calm and deliberate. “What’s important is that you focus on the here and now. Your memories may come back slowly, in fragments.” He believed in what he was saying, which in some way, made it easier for me to believe too.

“What do I do in the meantime?”

“You take it one day at a time.” He continued adjustments, a look of hard concentration briefly crossing his face before he nodded to himself in satisfaction. A small cabinet sat to the right of the bed, which he reached into, and pulled out a small vial—carefully injecting it into the IV line. His hands were sure, confident as if he’d done this a thousand times before. “Just a little something to help with the discomfort,” he explained, noting my eyes on him. 

He stepped back, his reassuring smile still in place. “I’ll be checking on you regularly, and if you need anything—anything at all—just press this.” He motioned to a red, shiny button attached to a wire within arm's reach. 

I settled back against the pillows. 

“Thank you,” I said softly.

I watched as he picked up the chair and moved it to its original place. He left the room and the door clicked behind him. The hum of the strange instruments was a reminder of uncertainty that clung to me like a shadow. I peered at the ceiling, white tiles blurring into one another as my thoughts churned. He said all the right things—filled with confidence that should have put me at ease. But waves of doubt began to creep back in, slowly dissolving what little sense of security I was clinging to.

*What if the memories* ***don’t*** *come back?* 

That was the question that echoed in my mind. Too terrified to ask or say aloud. I felt the edges of panic gnawing at me, threatening to close in. I looked around at the equipment I was hooked to. The setup felt like a web I was caught in, tethering me to an outcome I couldn’t control.

The absence of memory is like an all-consuming void. Every time I reached into it, all I found was formless thoughts and emptiness. 

The room felt colder now. I tried focusing on the pulse of the equipment, but it only reminded me how mechanical—how clinical, this all felt. I adjusted slightly, the stiffness in my muscles the only key telling me how long I had been lying there. Sleeping with no sense of time passing. *Time.* A quiet ticking of a clock, I noticed.

I took a deep breath. 

*Steady. Anchor yourself.*

*Maybe,* I told myself, *I could take it one day at a time. I don’t need to have all the answers right now. I just need to get through today, then tomorrow, and then the day after that…*

*One day at a time.* I tried to make the words stick.

Slowly, sleep started to tug at the edges of my consciousness. My eyes were becoming heavy. I tried to focus on the ceiling tiles above me, counting them, and tracing the faint cracks that webbed across the surface. They kept blurring together into a shapeless haze. Indefinite questions screamed in my head, echoing in empty halls. If I closed my eyes, I’d lose what little I had left, slip further into an abyss where nothing made sense, nothing *was*.

*Just a little longer*…

I desperately clung to consciousness, that moment, but it started to slip through my fingers. The bed was too soft, and the pillow encased my head too perfectly, urging me to let go.

I let the fear recede. The room started to blur, the edges faded into darkness. It began to pull me under, and as I drifted off, a final thought, echoed by the gentle voice, soft and insistent—*one day at a time*.

─────────────────

I drifted into sleep, no longer in the sterile hospital room. The steady hum of the machines was replaced by soft, distant *bleating*. A sound that was familiar, but strange.

I found my feet planted on a vast, green field. Fog encased heavy air, and the scent of the earth was strong—and something tangy, *metallic* almost. All around me, sheep wandered the landscape. Their wool was white and unblemished. They moved in a circle, heads bowing low, grazing on the ground which shifted beneath them. As I moved through the field, the fog thickened, its haze swallowing the creatures one by one until only I remained. A path in the grass appeared, it twisted and turned, and I followed it deeper into the mist. 

“Where are you going?”

That voice…so gentle, so familiar. I turned to face a figure standing a few feet away. 

His perfect, white coat seemed to blend into the fog. He looked as he was, as he’d left me. There was something different though.

“What is this place?” I asked.

His mouth raised at the corners, but it didn’t reach his eyes. 

“This is where you’ve come to find yourself,” his voice cooed. “They’re here to guide you.”

As if on cue, the fog lifted, revealing a lone sheep. It seemed smaller than the others, and its wool was matted, and stained with something oily. Its eyes—usually placid, darted side to side—wide and fearful, searching for something, or someone. 

“Follow it,” Dr. Walker said, his voice low and coaxing.

I hesitated, but the sheep turned and began to walk away. Its hooves barely made a sound against the shifting earth. I began to be drawn in by the winding path. The soft bleating of the sheep faded, replaced by a new sound—something low and rumbling—like thunder. As I moved farther down the path and deeper into the fog, the creature’s pace quickened. It began to zigzag, I tried to keep up but the ground beneath me became more unstable. 

“Wait!” I cried out. It didn’t stop.

The rumbling—no, it became more clear—*growling*, grew louder. Closer. The hairs on my arms rose and a shiver of fear crawled its way down my spine. I looked back to see the path had vanished. The fog spread out until I saw a dark, open field, where the sheep had stopped, and it began to rain. The ground became drenched and I watched as the creature struggled to move in the twisting mud. 

Then, emerging from the fog came yellowed eyes. Wolves. Three, maybe four. They moved with a grace, light enough to hover above the soaked earth. They circled their prey with slow, deliberate steps. The sheep frantically tried to move but was only pulled deeper into the muck. One of the wolves, larger than the others, with darkened fur, lunged. Its jaws snapped shut around the sheep’s neck. There was a sickening crunch, and the creature was left limp and lifeless.

I wanted to run, to scream. My feet were rooted, my body frozen. I watched as the wolves tore into the sheep’s body. I couldn’t tell blood from mud as its shiny intestines spilled into the dark, wet soil. I looked as the wolves lifted their heads, mouths covered in gore, stretching it out like a sticky webbing. Their eyes locked onto mine. The largest took a step towards me, its lips curling back into a snarl, revealing its crimson-stained teeth.

“If memories are threads, which ones unravel in the dark?” It growled, too human to be real.

I stumbled back, heart pounding in my chest. He advanced, eyes fixed with such a hunger it chilled my blood. I screamed for help but there was no answer. He lunged open-mouthed, and everything went black.

I jolted awake, gasping for breath. The darkness was replaced with the dimmed fluorescent lights above me. The room was quiet minus the hum of the machines and my quickened pulse in my ears.

*Just a dream,* I thought. *A nightmare*.

I took a moment to catch my breath and calm myself. I looked down at the shiny, barn-red button that reflected the light. I then glanced at the clock, un-illuminated and difficult to read.

*“If you need anything—anything at all—just press this.”*

I stared intently at that button, and before I could even think of pressing it, the door opened and bright light from the hallway flooded the room. Dr. Walker peaked in, and I heard his soft voice and a light knock.

“Hello? Are you awake? I saw a spike in your vitals.”

I breathed a sigh of relief. “Yes…I just woke up, I had a nightmare. Sorry to worry you.”

“Oh? Mind if I come in?” His shadow stretched its way into the room.

“Sure. Thank you for checking on me.” 

*It was* ***just*** *a nightmare*. *Don’t be ridiculous.* I thought to myself—and him.

He walked in and pulled up the chair, quietly, making sure it wouldn’t scrape against the floor. He sat down just as quietly. He glanced at the monitors, then back to me.

“Everything looks to be in order. Would talking about your dream help you fall back asleep?” He asked, almost a whisper. “Or, I could give you a dose of diazepam. It’s a sleeping aid,” He cocked his head slightly. “Unless you wish to be awake for a while?”

I took a slow breath in, looking at the ceiling. I could look anywhere but at him. 

*Why is the first thing I remember a nightmare? Why couldn’t have been anything else? About* ***anyone*** *else?*

“I think I’ll be alright, unless…do you have warm blankets? I have a feeling I might like those.”

He chuckled, “That’s a good sign. Who doesn’t?” He got up. “I’ll be right back.”

He hurried out and left the door open. Moments later he came back with a neatly folded, waffle-knit blanket. He put it gently at the foot of the bed, and placed a paper cup full of water on a small table he brought in. 

“Now, I could tuck you in but I think I would have to charge extra,” He gently smiled.

I felt the tension fade and scoffed lightly, “I don’t even know your going rate, but, whatever treatment you deem necessary.” 

He chuckled again. “Well, I’ll keep that in mind.” He turned and walked towards the door. “Here’s to pleasant dreams,” He motioned an invisible glass.

“Thank you, Dr. Walker.”

The door clicked. The room was dim again, and I was alone.
