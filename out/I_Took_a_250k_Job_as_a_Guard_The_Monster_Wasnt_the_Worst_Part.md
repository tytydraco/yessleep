I am typing this in a desperate attempt. I don’t know how much time I have before they find it or delete it. I have to get this out. Someone needs to know.

It started with a letter. A weird letter in my mailbox. I can’t find the information of its sending address. It was a job offer, but different without others. I have never sent any application to this company or organization.  I’d been unemployed for over five years. Our pitiful savings are already running low.

The worse was that wife already impregnated with our third. We couldn’t even afford the first two. She’d mentioned divorce twice, and I saw the truth in her eyes—it wasn’t a threat anymore, it will be true if I can’t solve the economic problems this year. The only time I have been given.

The letter was from a medical company, it labeled itself as  non-profit which "supported by 50 governments and 95 individual contributors to charity." Their goal was "Focus on Developing the most advanced treatment for humanity's most hopeless diseases.

" We needed 132 healthy young men to serve as guards. No diploma requirements . Just strong psychological qualities, loyalty, a will to sacrifice, and the ability to use weapons "from knife to gun."” The yearly salary was $250,000.

I thought it must be a scam for a desperate man like me.  There were no details, only an email and a phone number. No physical address, just a promise of a meeting location after contact. I searched it on the google, it exist, but just known as a medical corporation established in the 1950s. No other information has been provided.

When I was going to throw the letter into the trash. But I thought of my wife’s face filled with disappointment, when I back home without anything in the pockets. silence in my house… I moved. I had to. Even if it was a scam, it was the only choice I had at that moment. And I regret doing that choice perhaps for the rest of my lifetime.

I sent the email. I followed the instructions to a remote location. Others were there, men in different ages, but their hollow eyes spoke of their desperation. On the train, and then the sterile white ship, we talked in low tones. Our stories were the same: debt, bankruptcy, lawsuits, ruin. We were not chosen for our skills. We were chosen for our desperation.

We landed at a temporary port on a forgotten island. They split us into seven groups, handed us weapons—knives, shotguns, assault rifles. A cold dread settled in my gut. This was no medical facility. I tried to quit.

During this time, some of us had to quit it because they got serious vomiting, fever due to the long and uncomfortable trip, the terrible temperature and weathers. The stuff in suit told us they will be treated at nearby islands until recovered. Without further explanation, stuff with white shirt took the sickness people away silently, and smoothly.

A veteran commander, a man with cold eyes and unfriendly expression, who’d served the company for twenty years in every hellish place on Earth, stopped me and dragged me back with his muscular arm. He pointed to the agreement we’d signed. No quitting. Total confidentiality. Legal repercussions.

Then he told us the mission.

We weren't guards. We were hunters. The organization had detected a life signal in an enormous underground wreck on this island, a structure over 500,000 years old, once a temple to a fire god worshiped by islanders. I never listened to any history class, this might be the greatest mistakes I made.

The creature inside was real. A Minotaur. Its venomous blood, they said, held a precipitant that could cure Alzheimer's. Our job was to contain it, to secure samples. I felt a bit weird at this time, but the commander's staring silenced me subsequently.

It was a lie. Every word was a lie.

They sent us underground into the dripping, colossal darkness. We entered narrow entry together, and later shattered to assigned squats, teams. The relic itself was an enormous labyrinth. They  provide one gasoline lantern and a bottle of gasoline for each team.

But all teams refused, they think it was dangerous to bring this in the dark labyrinth instead of torchlight. Our team tried to refuse at first. But Julia, the only female teammates in our team, persuade us to accept it reluctantly. She said it might be useful.

Perhaps she  just had some nostalgic, I thought, but what will be if this get burn to us.

After we all enter the structure and begin to search the trace. There was still full of talking and laughing in the vox box, someone discovered some ancient painting, and some relics, they talked about prices if they smuggled it out.

But our team can’t find any of those Treasure. I only feared scared when we went deep into the darkness, with spider webs, and dusts that scared me, Julia just distinguish the lantern to incase of been ignited. Which make our direction grew darker. Jack, one of my teammate, tried to make some joke to soften the environment, but terror to darkness still captured most.

With the passing of time, I kept getting more and more doubt, like why did company needed over 100 people just to capture a beast, even though how powerful it was, it would become collection of scattered and bones within our fire power at first round. This might be too much for hunting 10 of those beasts.

However, This was the last peaceful, sweet moment we could get. Late just in the first hour, it was a symphony of death over our comms. After the first sound of fire. Screams cut short by the brutal sound of a neck breaking.

The scatter of a skull under pressure. The splash sound of blood. Twenty men gone, their last moments broadcast to the rest of us.

With the screaming, groan, and massive shooting sound echoed in the hallways, in our vox box, more and more lives been taken away brutally in this darkness hunting field. We are the prey now.

My squad try our best to cluster closer together, shaking. The commander had said if we held out for twelve hours, reinforcements would come. We hid in a corner , behind some wreckage of perhaps a former storage room.

We turn off the torch light, and  listening to other squads die over the radio—sudden gunfire, then screaming, then silence. We whispered in the darkness, preying to god or anyone whom can heard us, or knowing where we are.

Around the fifth hour. I felt my mind already numb in the sound of constant screaming, and moaning, the crying of man at their death moment.

Suddenly, the dizziness hit me like a wave of Tsunami. In this vertigo, I heard my wife’s voice, clear as day, calling from the darkness. *"Where are you? I miss you. I won’t blame you anymore. Come home. Now"* The guilt and longing pulled me to my feet.

I was going to her. My teammate, Marco, grabbed my arm, and used his body put me on the ground, then slapping me hard across the face, and calling my name beside my ear.

I finally woke up to reality just in time to see Marco’s head vanish in a spray of blood and grey matter, shattered by a paw the size of my head or even larger.

The monster was in the chamber with us.

It was a biological tank, fifteen feet tall. In the illuminating of our dimmed light, they all corded muscle under skin with something like maggots and worms. They crawling, moving inside, made my gut felt grossed.

Jack and Ben and the others opened fire. Bullets tore into it, they go straight into it, and creating holes on its skin. The hole with its blood. And the maggots *swarmed*, repairing the holes almost instantly through their flesh. Our fire didn’t kill it. It enraged it.

It moved with a speed that defied its mass. One blow reduced Jack’s skull to hit against the wall. Ben tried to slide beneath it; the creature simply dropped its weight and crushed him simultaneously. Julia fired at a stone column. It collapsed, pinning the beast for a moment.

Its three red eyes fixed on me with pure, ancient malice. Before I can reacted due to fear. It freed itself but rushed to its target, Julia. “No, Julia” I shouted at my loudest voice. Louder than the time facing my bullies.

But the creature already reached her, then, grabbed her, and just bitted her in two with a terrible tearing sound before swallowing the pieces. I can saw the blood been squirted on the ground like Chinese ink painting.

Then it was just me.

It looked at me, and I knew I couldn’t run. I had nothing left to lose. My hand found the old, heavy oil lantern we’d been issued, the thing I thought dangerous to me, but now is my strongest ally.  The *fire*. The temple of fire.

"You end today!" I screamed, a raw, stupid sound in the dark.

I shot at its legs with my shot gun, the bullets tearing flesh that filled with maggots. I charged, rushed in an inhuman speed that  plunged my knife into the gaping wound on its knee, and sawed and stabbed, turned like if it was a screwdriver, I turned  in its deeper wound. Made the blade deeper, fueled by a terror so complete it became rage.

The beast roared, trying to kick me. As its foot swung, I smashed the lamp into the bloody, maggot-filled hole I’d carved and rolled away as they felt the oil. Its blood also splashed on my body, even some of my face, like burning on my skin.

I didn’t care. Only instinct of destroying. Destroying everything. Destroying this beast, for the death of everyone, for my family and children! I moved aside as the beast kicking me. Than I adjust the position, and press the trigger as I roared like a wolf.

I fired into the pooled oil.

The *sound* of ignition was the most beautiful sound I’d ever heard. Flame engulfed its leg, climbing its fur, which burned and smelled like barbecue. It beat itself against the walls in a final strike which hitting my chest so hard, that I been strike to the wall just behind. The enormous pain also swallowed me, but I filled with ecstasy and gratification as It began to lean to another side, shaking the ancient stones loose.

I lost consciousness immediately.

I woke up in a hospital bed. For a time, I floated through a thousand grey dreams—my childhood, the divorce, the bullies, dropping out, meeting my wife in a dim bar, my kids, the false accusation that got me fired.

A nurse told me my vitals. She listed my injuries: multiple fractures, ribs, arm, skull. Seven surgeries. All successful.

"Congratulations," she said softly. "Your employer has paid for everything."

A man in a pristine white suit visited. His voice was polite, calm, and utterly empty.

"Mr. Benjamin. Due to your unprecedented success, the company offers you a new contract. A $700,000 reward. A monthly salary of $50,000. We have prepaid all your children’s expenses for the next decade. Your medical care is covered."

"What?" I gagged out, my mouth dry.

"You will serve as a commander for the next mission. You are the only survivor."

"I want to quit, you are bastards" I whispered.

"I am personally sorry," he said, not sounding sorry at all. "But you signed the agreements. We have your family’s information. Your address. We will not be polite if you try to leave or speak. Rest now. Your funds will arrive in five business days. Any questions?"

My mind was spinning, but one doubt, the core of it all, fought its way out. "Is this… for the cure? For dementia? Why don’t you care that they’re all dead, my teammates, they are also the desperate people with a family waiting for them?"

He almost smiled. "Certainly, if you are as naive as a preschooler. Did you wonder where some of your teammates disappeared to on the ship? Why did a primitive culture build that labyrinth? It was never a temple. The creatures are not from here. They are from the stars. But also from the hand of us. They feed on flesh. On agony. On life itself."

"But… you kill them. You make us kill them."

"Have you ever been to a zoo, Mr. Benjamin? This is a menagerie, more specific, an arena. The one more greater than Roman’s one. and only for a specific clientele. Our supporters. You and your teammates performed splendidly. You and your pitiful partners made the organization very rich today. Take some rest, gladiator, before you go to the hot dust again"

He left.

Now I am alone with the beeping machines and the memory of fire. I remember the monster’s last, intelligent gaze. Its human voice in the crackling flames.

*You are the next one.*

The man in the white suit says I have to go back to work.

I don’t think he and the monster mean the same job.

They will come for this soon. They will delete it. Please. Believe me. And if you get a letter, a too-good-to-be-true offer for guards… burn it.

Burn it, and run.
