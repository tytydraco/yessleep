Me and my sister, Keira, have always been best friends. I'm 17 and shes only a year and 8 months older. We have always been inseparable and did everything together. One day we got home from the mall and I jumped into my bed, exhausted. It was quite late, around 11pm (where I am, some shops are open till midnight or even open 24 hours, I'm not sure about in America though) I was really tired so I fell asleep quite quickly. It's worth noting that I have lucid dreams on a regular basis so when I got out of bed to get a glass of water, around 2 in the morning, it didnt surprise me when I heard eerie noises and footsteps in the kitchen. Since I knew it was a dream I was gonna go back to bed when something caught my attention. In the corner of my eye was a shadow-like figure, holding my sister in its arms. It's body was mainly a misty black but it had razors for teeth and yellow eyes

"You're next KK" I heard it whisper. My name is Kaitlyn and while most people call me Lynn, Keiras nickname for me was KK. Only she was allowed to call me that.

Since it was a dream, I wasn't scared and went back to bed (It definitely shocked me but I was used to stuff like that). When I woke up, I checked the time and it was 10am. Keira's a huge early bird, up at 6am and stuff like that (The fact that she was even awake past 10pm last night was shocking) so I of course expected her to be awake but she wasn't in the kitchen, her usual spot around this time. 'Hm' I thought to myself 'maybe shes out with her friends' but that thought was debunked when I saw her white Jeep parked where it always had been. The sink was also empty but it should be filled with a glass smeared in green smoothie and dirty blender parts. I walked to her room, confused, scared she would be dead or something. But when I walked into her room she was awake on her phone. Definitely unusual for her.

"Keira why are you still in bed? You're always up at this time" I said

"Oh my god KK how many times? Don't come into my f\*cking room without knocking!"

'Ok something's definitely wrong' I thought. 1. Keira is almost never mad at me, and when she is, she tells me why and also never calls me KK when shes mad. 2. even if she was just having a bad day, she never takes that out on me. 3. I'm always allowed in there! How mad was she?!

She wasnt looking at me but I saw. I know it knows I saw. Reflecting off the phone screen was a huge smile almost reaching the yellow eyes, razor sharp teeth pointing through.

I ran out of her room and now I'm in my closet. I dont know what to do or where my sister is but I dont think it was a dream that I had last night. It must've been real. God I am praying that this is a dream right now because I can't live without my sister.
