**Part 1**

I'm not going to give much of an introduction because I am kind of panicking after my findings, but you can refer to me as Abigail. I enjoy finding old things in local thrift stores. Usually it brings me joy to find something with history and reusing it in my life. Ironically, what I found has brought me down a path I don't even know how to describe. 

After school I decided to stop by this local thrift store. The store was as generic as any other thrift store. Smelt of a mixture of dust and wood, had very few workers and fewer customers. As I make a quick scan of all the items near the entrance, my eye catches the area in the back labeled trinkets. Now looking with more precision, I find a very worn and torn book. To my surprise it was actually a diary. Eagerly, I skim the pages and find that every entry is signed by Abigail H. I made a small smile; it was such a pleasant surprise for her to have the same name as me. I take this as fate and without reading any of the writings, I buy it.

Honestly I forgot about the diary once I got home. Just another trinket to my collection that got swallowed by the mess on my desk. A few days after buying it, I sat down to take a look at its content. This diary was old. First date was 1969 and this author, Abigail goes directly into her life. 

*April 14, 1969*

*Dear Diary,*

*We’re leaving for our annual camping trip tomorrow. It’s always the same spot by the river, but supposedly this is going to help daddy’s and mom’s problem. This year it’s me, Daddy, Mom, Uncle John, and Thomas. I’m a little nervous about sleeping in my own tent. I hope I don't get scared. But I know Uncle John, God, and Daddy, will keep us safe. I also hope I get to see some deer this year! Last year, Thomas said he saw a bear but no one believed him.*

*I better go to bed now. We have an early start tomorrow.* 

*Goodnight,*

*Abigail H.*

A few things that I should probably clarify. Abigail is fourteen years old during this camping trip. Mr. H, is referred to as Daddy, and Mrs. H as Mom. Her Uncle, John, is her father’s brother. Thomas is her younger brother, as of right now I don't know his age but I assume younger than Abigail. What I didn't get at first was her parents “problem”, but based on context clues, it’s most likely marital issues. Based on this first entry, everything is normal. I thought before reading more of its content I should see if Abigail H is still alive or relatives of hers that might want the diary, but once I type her name in, the only thing I can find is newspaper articles. H family disappearance and daughter’s body found near camp site. Unwilling, I also saw photos of the crime scene. 

They are far from an accident. Whatever happened was horrific and intentional. The only thing that brought me to the conclusion that the mangled corps was Abigail was the articles specifically stating it as such. The grotesque scene was anything but recognizable of a young girl. The pictures had small numbers next to each piece of evidence, and the “evidence” were chunks of her body. Number one; left arm chunk. Number two; Left foot with no toes. Number three; head-back hollowed out. Number four; Jaw with missing all teeth. This evidence only stopped at number forty. I was sick to my stomach. I really hoped it was just some animal attack, but after reading the article no one knows what happened to the other family members, and the scattered "evidence" wasn't torn or bitten. It was cut. Cut with surgical accuracy. As if it was trying to make this… hell act… more humane. After my findings, I have come to the conclusion that maybe something human didn't do this. 

Next, I decided to do some looking into the H Family. Abigail H (14), daughter of Jim H (50) and Amy H (35). I will refer to her parents as Mr. and Mrs. H. Regarding earlier, my assumption of Thomas was correct. Younger brother (11) of Abigail.  As for her uncle, John H (55), who is commonly known by their community as Pastor John. Due to her family having close ties to a pastor, her mother and father were extremely active in this small Baptist church. The community's beloved Pastor John had a wife, Clair, and three children: Emily, John Jr., and Anthony. I found many newspaper articles talking about the church; *Baptist Church of \[redacted\]* *Book Drive Donates Over Hundreds of Books (1964)*. *Baptist Church of \[redacted\] Christmas Choir Concert (1967),* but after a couple of hours of skimming I see something that really catches my eye. *Baptist Church of \[redacted\] Fire, 7 People Dead, Many Injured (1969).* The fire was an act of arson, but the person responsible was never found. The incident resulted in the deaths of seven individuals, some were members of the community. Tragically, Clair, Emily, John Jr., and Anthony H were among the victims. The arson attack on May 1st, 1969, surprised me because it occurred five days after the H family tragedy.

I spent hours, and I mean hours, searching for information on the family members, but they were just like any other typical white Baptist American family. I started reading the diary entries again that night, specifically with the entry from April 15th. This was the next entry following the one where I had previously left off. 

*April 15, 1969*

*Dear Diary,*

*We have set up camp. Daddy and Uncle John helped with my tent and Uncle John says if I'm scared I can stay in his tent. Mom laughed. It wasn't a joke? Because I really might get scared. She's not very considerate of my feelings. Maybe I am just not used to her being with the family again. I wish it was just Daddy and Uncle John.* 

*Sincerely,*

*Abigail H.*

Mrs. H and Mr. H’s relationship isn't so “Baptist perfect”. Probably Mrs. H left the house for a period of time. This camping trip might be some form of family therapy. The next entry is the same day but most likely hours after the previous. 

*April 15, 1969*

*Dear Diary,*

*It's about to get dark. Uncle John wants to start a fire, and asks if can help get wood and sticks for it. I would rather continue showing Thomas how to braid my hair but he seemed pretty serious about the help. Can’t say no to uncle John, haha. Mom is still a bother. I asked Uncle John what I should do, but he told me only God has the right to judge people. I think God and I are on the same page though. How girls in high school would say, she's a B, I, T, C, H. Always telling me how and what to do. Like you weren't here for a good two months. Now you want to be my mom again?*  

*Anyway, I need to start a fire.*

*Sincerely,*

*Abigail H.*

Abigail's relationship with Uncle John is very strong. He has seemed to replace that void her mom has left. Although her return has brought a crowded feeling in the family. “Cant say no to Uncle John” does give this unhealthy power dynamic though so I wouldn't regard Uncle John taking her under his wing to be a good omen. Another thing to note Abigail is extremely religious, another reason she might feel connected to Uncle John, since he is a pastor.  

*April 15, 1969*

*Dear Diary,*

*The fire is really big now. Uncle John let me help light it, and said I did a good job. Thomas keeps tossing little twigs into it, watching them burn up real fast. It smells like smoke and pine, and I think the wind is carrying it all the way up to heaven. Maybe God can smell it too.*

*Mom keeps trying to talk to me. She asked if I wanted to help her make s’mores, but I told her I wasn’t hungry. She gave me that look, the one that makes me feel like I did something wrong just for breathing. I don’t know why she cares all of a sudden. She wasn’t here when I actually needed her and she made everything worse.*

*Uncle John says forgiveness is the key to a pure heart, but I think my heart is fine the way it is.*

Sincerely,Abigail H.

Abigail’s resentment is clear. Her mother is an outsider in her own home. The way Uncle John speaks to her, instilling moral lessons through religious teachings, deepens their bond. However, Abigail’s unwavering trust in him suggests an imbalance, an unspoken authority he holds over her. His influence is strong, and her devotion to faith only strengthens that connection. Something about this dynamic feels off… like a slow moving current pulling her further away from the shore. 

I put down the diary and cleared my desk of my notes. I need to escape this deep dive for a bit before I become lost in a rabbit hole. I texted my friend Carson about what I found. 

*“Hey, I think I found something you have some skill for, can I get your help?”*  I’m going to show all of what I found and get their feedback. Thats all for tonight, so please feel free to comment on areas I should look into. 

Thx,

Abigail
