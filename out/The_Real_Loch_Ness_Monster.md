They say Loch Ness is deep—deeper than the North Sea in places. A prehistoric trench filled with black water, where sunlight fades into nothing after only a few meters.

That was exactly why I came here.

I’m a commercial diver by trade, but a cryptid hunter at heart. Most guys in my field spend their time welding pipes or inspecting shipwrecks. Me? I take side gigs exploring the unknown. And Loch Ness, well… it’s the biggest unknown of all.

That’s how I ended up securing a permit, renting a small boat, and suiting up for a solo dive into the abyss.

The water swallowed me. Even with my high-powered dive torch, visibility was pathetic. Just silt, shadows, and the occasional ripple from God-knows-what moving below me.

I scanned the loch bed, my heart pounding with each kick of my fins. Sonar readings from previous expeditions suggested a cave system down here, a place so dark and deep that it could have hidden something for centuries.

My oxygen hissed softly in my ears as I approached the opening. A vast black mouth in the loch’s belly. My torch barely reached the walls. I hesitated. My gut screamed at me to turn back, but my hands moved on instinct—checking my tank, my pressure gauge, my line to the surface. Everything was fine.

Until it wasn’t.

It started with a vibration. Not a sound exactly—more like a pulse, a low thrum in my bones. The water shook around me, sending silt and debris spiraling in my beam of light. My radio crackled with static.

Then, I saw it.

Something big moved at the edge of my vision. Not an eel, not a sturgeon—something immense. The water twisted as its body coiled, just beyond the reach of my torch.

I barely breathed.

It watched me. I felt it watching me.

My instincts screamed to retreat, but before I could, it struck.

A rush of blackness surged toward me, a cloud of ink-like substance, engulfing me completely. My torch flickered, and suddenly, my suit burned. My arms, my chest, my legs—everything stung like acid was eating through the fabric.

I thrashed, trying to escape, but my limbs moved sluggishly. My fingers tingled. My breath quickened. What the hell was happening?

With a final burst of effort, I kicked free of the cloud and shot toward the surface, my vision blurring.

When I broke through, gasping, the boat was barely ten feet away. I hauled myself over the side, my wetsuit still burning against my skin. I clawed at the zipper and peeled it off, shivering violently.

Then I saw my arms.

Tiny black lesions had formed along my veins, spider-webbing beneath my skin.

My breath caught in my throat. The pain was fading, replaced by something worse: a creeping, crawling sensation beneath the surface of my flesh.

I grabbed my emergency kit, yanked out a disinfectant wipe, and scrubbed at the marks. They didn’t budge.

That’s when I remembered the stories.

Loch Ness had seen divers disappear before. Bodies recovered weeks later, covered in strange sores. Decomposition far beyond what should have been possible in cold water.

People blamed pressure sickness, cold shock, drowning. But I knew the truth.

The real monster of Loch Ness wasn’t some ancient reptile. It was something smaller. Something microbial. Something hungry.

I felt my heartbeat stutter. The black lines beneath my skin shifted ever so slightly.

I wasn’t alone in my own body anymore.

And I had no idea what I had just brought to the surface.
