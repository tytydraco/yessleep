I can’t stop the fluttering in my head. It beats against the inside of my skull like the wings of a thousand moths trapped in a jar, desperate, frantic. The light of the moon outside calls to me, whispering my name in a voice made of rustling leaves and the soft, rhythmic hum of wings. I am drawn to it.

No one understands. They look at me with wide eyes, pitying and afraid, but they don’t understand. You may think I’m mad, but what does that matter? You don’t know what it’s like to feel the hunger, the deep, gnawing emptiness that only the fluttering can fill.

I wait until the night is darkest and the moonbeams stream through my window. That’s when I climb out barefoot, feeling the cold earth beneath my feet, the damp leaves clinging to my skin. The air is thick with the smell of wet moss and rotting wood, and it wraps around me like a shroud, pulling me deeper into the trees.

The moths know I’m coming. They gather for me, drawn by the flames of desire and the hunger in my veins. I see them first as shadows against the night, darting between the trees, their wings whispering secrets I can almost understand. They’re beautiful, so delicate, bodies soft and fragile, like living pieces of the night itself.

I reach out, my fingers trembling with anticipation, and they come to me willingly, landing on my skin. Their tiny legs tickle as they crawl up my arms and across my face. I can feel their little hearts beating, quick and desperate, and it makes my heart race, a wild, frantic rhythm that drowns out everything else.

I bring one to my mouth, holding it gently, so gently, between my fingers. It flutters, trying to escape, but I won’t let it. The first bite is always the best, the crunch of its delicate body between my teeth, the burst of warmth and bitterness on my tongue. The wings stick to the roof of my mouth, clinging to my teeth, and I savour the sensation, the way they dissolve slowly, like bad sugar on my tongue.

The others watch, their tiny eyes reflecting the moonlight, but they don’t flee. They never do. They know this is what I need, that I can’t stop now or ever. The hunger is too intense, too deep, a hollow ache that only they can fill.

I eat them all, one by one, their bodies fragile as paper in my hands, their wings fluttering weakly until they go still. I swallow them down, feeling them settle inside me, filling the void, if only for a little while. Their wings line my throat, tickling and scratching, but I don’t mind. It’s the price I pay for the silence, for the momentary peace that comes after the fluttering stops.

When it’s done, I’m left alone in the darkness, the taste of their bodies still on my lips, their wings still beating in my head, but softer now, quieter. I walk back through the woods, the night closing in around me, pressing against my skin like a lover’s embrace. The trees whisper my name, the wind carrying their voices, telling me that they’ll be back, that the hunger will return, and when it does, so will they.

I know it’s true. The fluttering will never stop, not really. It’s inside me now, part of me, and no matter how many I eat, it will always come back, gnawing at my insides, filling my head with the sound of wings.

By the time I reach the edge of the woods, the sun is beginning to rise, its pale light creeping over the horizon, chasing away the darkness. I slip back into the house, into my bed, the sheets cold against my skin, but I don’t sleep. I lie there, staring at the ceiling, feeling the fluttering grow stronger and louder, knowing that soon, it will be unbearable again.

And when it is, I’ll return to the woods, and the moths will be waiting.

They always are.
