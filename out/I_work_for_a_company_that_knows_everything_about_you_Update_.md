They're looking for me.



I made a mistake in my last post by disclosing the name of what I saw. I think I pinged their watch systems, and they are now running internal investigations internationally. What was in that box was a bigger deal than I thought. I hope this storm passes over me. 

Regardless, here's the strange thing among many other strange things.

They haven't found me; or N for that matter. He's still around, still acting like he can't see me at all, but he's still around. Some comments asked if he was trying to protect me and honestly, maybe? I'm not completely sure. He's locked away in his office most of the day and only leaves to use the bathroom, eat, and do some small duties he has to do around the office.

But what doesn't make sense is how they seem to have no record of how the item got into one of the facilities in the first place. If they brought it in, they would have a record of that and would have found us already. And, I don't think N archived the game into the company system yet. If he did, they would have already come and kicked my door down to take me away. But I’m still here. They don’t know which branch location we’re in. 

I know they are reading these posts. I'll have to be more careful with what I say.

I tried to give him his invitation to my family's Christmas party yesterday. After everyone left I caught him out of his office and stood directly in his way with the card in my hand. I wasn't going to let him go without at least having engaged with him once today.



That was a mistake. 



Have you ever bitten your tongue while chewing something? I mean REALLY bit down. So hard your eyes start to water? Or, have you ever stubbed your toe on the corner of a table or something? Like so hard, you swear you just obliterated your pinky toe and sent it to hell? That unconscious force we exert in the day-to-day can be the most destructive force we ever face in our entire lives. Because of this force, I've come to believe that N actually can't see me. I stood in his way to give him the card, and He slammed into me with no expectation of stopping; crushing the card against my body and driving me onto the floor, sending us both into a fall that ended with the back of my head slamming onto the tiled floor.

I passed out for about 3 or 4 minutes before I opened my eyes to find myself lying in a pool of blood.

N was gone. I stood up slowly. I’m in a dazed state. I could only hear the hum of the building's HVAC unit. It was too loud. The lights were off. A single computer was on. It was my computer. I stumbled over. I tried to focus. The blue light was too much. I may have a concussion. 

As my eyes began to focus, I noticed there was something taped on my monitor. It was the now creased and folded Christmas card. I peeled it off the monitor and saw that someone had written on it.



“I'm sorry, I won't be able to make it to the Christmas party this year. Unfortunately, I've been having some eye trouble. But I know that my Mother would love to go with you. Maybe you should give this letter to her.”

I think I know what I have to do. I'll update you all when I do it.



Should I go to the hospital?
