Sorry if some of this is unclear. I’ve just got home from possibly the weirdest experience of my life and I don’t know what to do about it. At least putting this here could help warn someone else in my position.

I’m between jobs at the minute, so I’ve been doing a bit of babysitting on the side. I’ve always been good with kids, so the opportunity to earn a bit of cash while also interacting with weird little idiots for an evening was a no-brainer to me. The jobs have always gone smoothly. Until tonight.

The advert on gumtree looked like a perfectly normal one. No warning bells or weird rules.  Just “Looking for someone to look after our two little treasures this evening. Good money paid. No timewasters”. I sent them an email and almost immediately got a reply.

“Hey! Great to hear from you! My wife and I are heading out to the theatre tonight, and expect to be back late. Does that sound okay?”

For the money they were offering, it definitely did. I replied with the same, and set off on my bike to arrive at their place at eight.

When I got there, the place was beautiful. Sprawling gardens, an immaculate stately home, and shiny, brand-new Jaguars on the drive. Suddenly, the high fee started to make sense. I rang the bell, and was swiftly welcomed inside by a handsome man in his late 40s with a well-trimmed beard and a black poloneck. He introduced himself as Mr Jacobs, the man who had posted the ad. He was shortly joined by his wife, a stunning woman of a similar age in a dress that probably cost more than my rent.

“We’re so glad you could make it,” Mr Jacobs said, “So glad.”

“Indeed,” his wife purred, “It’s so hard to find someone willing to put up with the little terrors on such short notice!”

I laughed and said that it was fine, then reiterated my experience and bona fides, and my general approach to babysitting. They both seemed happy with me, though they were sharing smiles that I couldn’t quite understand.

“Well,” said Mr Jacobs, throwing on a jacket and heading for the door, “They’re upstairs at the minute. We should be back just gone midnight, though bedtime is no later than ten. My number is on the pad on the side if you need anything.”

I assured them that everything would be fine, and wished them a good night. 

As the door clicked behind them, I was struck by the size of the place. The emptiness. The strange, eerie quiet. I mean, I know kids need a lot of space, but I couldn’t imagine two kids growing up in a place like this.

As I thought this, something else struck me as odd. I couldn’t see a single toy. Not one. No children's books. No comics. Not even a games console. No evidence at all that house was occupied by anything other than two extremely well-to-do and extremely attractive rich theatregoers.

Suddenly, there was a crash from upstairs. Then a shriek. My breath caught in my throat and then…

Peals of laughter rang throughout the house from upstairs. I must admit, I laughed too. The house was probably so tidy because, clearly, any family this size would have an army of staff to help keep things tidy during the day. I relaxed, settled into a frankly ridiculously comfortable sofa, and called up-

“Hey kids! I’m Abby! I’m your babysitter for this evening! Do you want to come down and say hello?”

There was a frantic rush of footsteps as two little blonde moppets thundered downstairs, skidded on the polished wooden floor, and hurtled into the living room. They were a boy and a girl, both the same age, and both dressed in identical dorky dark green sweaters and khaki shorts.

“Hi!” said the boy, “I’m Charles! And this is my sister-”

“I’m Samantha”, the girl interrupted, with all the haughty gravitas a nine year old can muster.

“Well nice to meet you, Charles and Samantha,” I said with a smile, “I’m Abby, and your folks have asked me to look after you for this evening!”

I was about to ask them to sit on the couch opposite when there was another loud thud from upstairs. It sounded like something heavy and limp hitting the floor, or possibly a window thudding shut in its frame. I must have still been a bit jumpy, because I nearly jumped out of my skin.

“What…what was that?” I asked with a whisper.

For a second, both children looked afraid. Then, they looked at each other, then at me, then burst into laughter.

“That’s just the house,” said Samantha, “It’s old, so sometimes it makes funny noises. It scared us too when we first got here, but we learned to get used to it.”

I let out a big sigh of relief and joined in with the laughter, feeling silly and relieved at the same time. 

With the ice broken, we got on with getting to know each other. I asked how long they’d been there - almost as long as they could remember - they asked how long I’d been babysitting - six years, on and off - and we fell into each other’s company. They told me they didn’t really play videogames or watch TV, and didn’t seem interested in watching things on my phone, so we just chatted until 9, which they said was their dinner time. Throughout this, the house kept making its strange noises - thumps and bumps and groans. The kids didn’t seem bothered, though, so I figured why should I?

I wish I’d listened to my gut and left right then.

For dinner, they led me by the hand to the kitchen. And oh boy what a kitchen. It was bigger than my entire flat. After looking through endless cupboards, I threw them together an omelet each, and soon after polishing those off, we were all back on the couch.

At this point it was quarter to ten, so I had to make the change from Fun Abby to Enforcing Bedtimes Abby. This bit is never fun, especially when the kids have taken to you as a friend, but it’s all part of the job. This time, though, it was surprisingly easy:

“Right then, you two,” I said as brightly as possible, “This has been fun, but it’s time for you to hit the hay.”

I expected at least a little bit of push back, but they were good as gold. They both got up, said goodnight, and gave me a kiss on the cheek, which I thought was extremely cute.

“Do you want me to come tuck you in?” I asked.

“No,” said Samantha, haughty again, “We’re all grown up and we can do it ourselves!”

I stifled a smirk and wished them goodnight.

True to their word, they both shot upstairs, and I shortly heard running taps, flushing toilets, and closing doors. ‘Cute kids’, I thought, before sinking back into the couch to scroll on my phone and let time slip by.

Over the next hour or so, there was more thumping and creaking from upstairs, but I paid it no mind. At 11.30, I decided to go up and check on them, just to make sure, so that when their parents came back I could give them a full report.

I crept upstairs one step at a time, more mindful than ever of the noises an old house can make. It was only at the top of the stairs that I realised I didn’t know which room was theirs. I didn’t want to snoop, but I also didn’t really have a choice. I walked along the corridor opening door after door. Lavish bedrooms, spa-like bathrooms, and closets that could put a bedsit to shame were all revealed to me, door after door after door. At this point, it had started to rain, with the occasional rumble of thunder outside. I wondered if I could persuade the handsome Mr Jacobs to give me a lift home so I didn't have to cycle home in the deluge.

Eventually, I opened a door into a fairly sparse little room where they were both sleeping like angels, both tucked in and their clothes nicely folded. I smiled to myself, and gently closed the door.

As I did so, a flash of lightning struck nearby and illuminated the rest of the corridor, and my life changed forever.

Briefly, frozen in the silver light, I saw two strange, tall figures standing perfectly still by the window. A fraction of a second later, darkness fell again. I couldn’t breathe. My heart was in my throat. I wasn’t sure whether they’d always been there, or if they’d appeared when I was looking into the bedroom.

Another bolt of lightning. Another flash. Another terrible moment of detail thrown into stark relief.

They were both tall. One seemed to be holding what looked like a great, bulging sack. The other held something in its hand. Long and heavy looking, like a pry-bar, or a thick stick.

Their faces were white. Thick greasepaint only serving to highlight their black, shining eyes.

More lightning. More detail. More terror.

At this point I had managed to shake myself out of the freeze response and backed against a wall. As I did my back bumped into a lightswitch, illuminating the corridor and dragging an involuntary shriek from my lips.

I hunched down. I cowered. I awaited my fate.

After what felt like an eternity of hearing nothing but my heartbeat competing with the roar of the thunder outside, I risked a peek.

They were still there. Frozen in place.

Statues.

I let out a shaky breath and took a step forward. And another. And another.

Eventually I was close enough to see that they were, in fact, statues. They were so lifelike. I’d never seen anything like it. Their eyes seemed almost alive, following me as I moved.

On unsteady legs, I headed back downstairs and snatched the notepad with the phone number, and texted Mr Jacobs.

“I’ve put the kids to sleep, but I wish you’d warned me about those clown statues in the hallway. They really freaked me out!”

The second I hit send my phone started buzzing - a call from the number that was on the notepad.

“Hello?” I answered.

“Abby! Thank god!” cried Mr Jacobs on the phone.

“What’s wrong?” I asked. Is everything okay?

“Abby listen to me, you need to get out of there RIGHT NOW!” he yelled into the phone.

“I don’t understand!” I said, “What’s happening?”

What he said next will haunt me to the end of my days:

“Take the clown statues and run - WE DON’T HAVE ANY KIDS!”
