 This tale is a short one, so I won’t keep you long, it is about a strange occurrence that happened when I was a young boy. I Still remember it vividly and some of the important details were never answered. I will tell you about the time that Elliot Went missing.

Elliot was a local boy around the village, he was humorous of sorts but never came off as childish. His name was Elliot, but we called him “Rufty Tufty”. Because around our village he was one of the tougher ones, he would always look fear right in the face. So naturally we called him “Rufty Tufty”. one night as we set out to play our usual game of Seek n Find we played every Saturday, something peculiar happened. Well, let me explain a bit better than I have. Elliot was very good at this game, every time it was his turn to hide, he was never found. We would search hours and hours, but he was just too good for us. I was sort of jealous of his ability to do this, because when it was my turn, I was so clumsy. I would knock down trash cans and make all kinds of noise. But Elliot was as silent as a cat. At a certain point of the night our mothers would call from the balcony’s and that meant our game was over, then Elliot would come out of nowhere, and the game would be over. It always amazed me of how good he was. But one night, he didn’t come out of his hiding place.

As we took in turns during the night, it was Rufty’s turn to hid again. Off he went and we counted to 20 and then continued looking for him. Little good it did because as usual we couldn’t find him. He was like a shadow, nowhere to be seen. As usual he went all night undetected. Our mothers called from the balcony and off we went. But Elliot didn’t come out. I called out to a friend who lived on the opposite side, where’s Rufty? “Not Sure, didn’t see him come out of anywhere” he said. We ran back inside still looking behind us to see if we could spot Elliot running home as he always did, but nothing. It wouldn’t have been 10 minutes later, and Elliot’s mother came knocking on our door asking if we had seen him. I ran to the door and told her “No, he never came out of his hiding spot as he usually does” Her face turned pale.

My mother and her talked a little while longer and they both headed out the door. I looked out the window as they walked down the corner. I could hear in the distance people yelling his name, they even got the police involved. It had been days since I had seen Elliot and we were all worried about him. His mother spent countless nights trying to find him but came back empty handed. It was even in the paper my father was reading, Elliot was everywhere. We started to think maybe this was Elliot’s big joke on everyone. But months had passed, and he still hadn’t shown up to the schoolhouse. We weren’t allowed to play Seek n Find anymore as our mothers insisted, we not. To this day we still crown Rufty Tufty as Seek N Find champion.
