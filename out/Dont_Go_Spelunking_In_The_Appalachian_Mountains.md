It was an old mountain far away from the bustling cities and splashing waves of the beaches. It wasn’t marked on any maps, though it had a quaint town resting beneath its base. West Virginia is the place to travel for the scenic beauties of this kind of untamed wilderness. The locals are… odd to say the least, but besides that there’s nothing quite like it.  
   
I made my way into town with nothing but a backpack on my shoulder and a yes-we-can mentality. Clothes too, obviously, but not nearly enough for the shivering cold you’ll find atop the zenith of those white-tipped pyramids. I was trying to find something warmer, a coat, actual pants, a thicker headwear, just to stop myself from being a landmark atop the ring of monoliths that towered over me.  
   
As I scoured the shops, people eyed me up and down. I’d nod and wave, only to be met with snarls and loogies. I tried not to let it bother me or disturb my search. I got giddy as I entered one shop, “Buck’s Mountaineer’s Gears” since that seemed like just the place for what I was looking for. The man behind the counter seemed much friendlier than the other locals, giving me an actual smile and wave.  
   
“Hey, buddy! Need somethin’ specific? Look a ‘lil underdressed!” he gleefully greeted me.  
   
“Yeah, just a bit! I climbed Spruce Knob and realized that halfway up,” I chuckled out.  
   
“Ah, she’s a bitch, ol’ Spruce Knob. Hell’s Ascent ain’t no fun, neither!” he retorted with a hint of something sour in his words.  
   
“Hell’s Ascent? That mountain over there? I didn’t see it anywhere online so I figured I may as well try to be the first,” I said with a giggle.  
   
“Been a lota men thought that,” he said, his mood quickly shifting, “None done it yet. Go up, don’t come down. Some that did make it back went damn crazy, sayin’ the hole to hell up them mountains, how’s it gots its name. Had an ol’ mine jus’ under the valley all had’s t’ evaciate since the avalanche back in ‘77.”  
   
I looked at the floor as he spoke, quickly realizing my clear ignorance as a tourist. “Sounds tough. Guess I’ll pay a little extra for equipment,” I muttered.  
   
“That won’t do no damn help!” he shouted, slamming his hands against the counter, “You hear them screams up there, boy, you turn ‘round and come right back. Devil’s got a knackerin’ fer the curious type.”  
   
I was frozen for a moment in fear. He was dead serious and yelling at me for asking questions. I understand the urgency, but damn that was dramatic.  
   
“A-alright,” I nodded in understanding.  
   
I quickly grabbed all the gear I’d need and promptly left Buck’s freakshow. I stared up at the green land that pierced at the sky. Usually I’d try to sleep the night in town and go early in the morning, but this place creeped me out too much. I marched my way out of town and toward the great mass calling for me to scale it.  
   
In retrospect, that was a pretty dumb idea. Spruce Knob is supposed to be the tallest mountain in the state, but looking at Hell’s Ascent it seemed only half as high as this one. The trip was hard as there was no clear path, but the beauty of this untapped climb was just so natural and surreal. It wasn’t like any climb I’ve ever done before. About 2,000 ft up the Sun began to dim from behind the peak. A large shadow casted itself over me and across the town below. I set up camp and cooked some canned dinner.  
   
As I sat and ate under darkness, the thick foliage shrouded my fire from reaching beyond about 5 ft of distance. It was like a murky fog that encompassed me and me alone, except I got that odd feeling that I wasn’t alone. I dug a fork into a warm can of beans and heard crunching around me, leaves cracking and twigs snapping. Every time I looked down, I could swear I saw something darting between the trees in my peripheral vision. Yet every time I glanced, I didn’t see anything. I slept sparingly that night.  
   
The next day I stepped out and looked at my fire, and an animal got into my food. Shreds were everywhere and my backpack was stripped of its supplies. I let out a loud “Fuck!” as my arm reached around for anything salvageable. It was torn to pieces, even the fabric itself was shredded. I could’ve just gone back then and there, but there was no way in hell I was going to turn down the pride of being the first at the top of Hell’s Ascent.   
   
As I made my way through the trees and shrubs, I noticed an odd red substance leaking from a cut one of the trees. I went to touch it and it felt too viscous to be sap, though still sticky. It was warm to the touch. The cut itself was like a sword slashed through it. It had to be recent. I still had a can of bear repellent, and I didn’t smell bear, so I kept a closer look out and kept my way forward.  
   
I was about 4,000 ft up from surface level now and the air was growing thin and cold. This mountain just kept going and going like an endless stairway to the sky. My foot grazed something hard and I tumbled to the ground.  
   
“Ugh!” I let out as my face hit the dirt. It wasn’t warm, it was hot. It nearly burned my face as I pulled it away.  
   
I scratched my head and looked behind me to see what I tripped on. It was a human skull. Hair still stuck to the top held on by a thin layer of skin. I screamed and scooted away in panic. I saw that its teeth, however, were not human at all. Canines sharp enough to tear through flesh, contorted rows of misaligned teeth lined the jaws. Before I could notice more, it swept away.  
   
Something in the shrubs beside it began gnawing like a starved mutt. I heard cracking, gushing, moaning. I ran for it. I ran hard, fast. I ran until my foot hung on a hole in the ground. Before I could react, my body swept away into the earth.  
   
There was nothing but a humid cold. The pitch black was deafening and every move I made echoed. I reached in my pocket and pulled out my phone, lighting up the chamber I lied in. I gathered my bearing, stone walls and a small light peering down into the chasm from high above. I wondered how I survived the fall, and looked down to see a pile of flesh beneath me. In a panic I scurried myself to the cold wet floor of the cave.  
   
A massive pile of corpses lay beneath the light, arms stretching upward in a desperate attempt at salvation that never came. None looked human except the thin bones that scoured the chamber. I looked up again at the light, taking one last glimpse at the heavens before plunging into the abyss.  
   
The tunnels that funneled in different directions felt like a maze to navigate. The air was so dense it was suffocating. I heard scratching echo through the halls, and distant impossible screams. They almost sounded human, but weren’t quite. They were off, like the many corpses I’ve found littering this desolate hellscape. Every now and then I’d pass through a large opening, seeing a dim light above shine down, but impossible to reach. The cave mocked me with the idea of escape.  
   
There were rails and old carts filled with rock in some tunnels. This must’ve been the old mineshaft Buck was telling me about. Bloody pickaxes littered the ground. When the avalanche happened, did some not escape? I’ve heard tales of some people resorting to cannibalism and going insane, some even turning into hellish monsters. I kept moving on, not slowing down to act as dinner on a plate.  
   
I heard something scurry pass. My heart went still as I thought I was about to be disemboweled alive. It was one of those things, standing in the dark. I got a better picture of it as I shined my light on it. It had no eyes, long, heavy arms. Its hands were large and ended in a set of sharp talons. It looked human, especially wearing its bloody miner’s hat, heaving a pickaxe at a pile of rocks. Whatever it once was, shares no resemblance to what it is now. I backed away slowly, but its head shot over at me. I ran.  
   
The deeper I went, the less it made sense. It felt like an eternity running through purgatory. I felt like I was halfway to hell, stuck in between. I saw a light gently glowing in the distant turns and corners. I kept fast, as the beast behind me screamed so loud it etched into my mind. Almost as loud as the screams ahead of me.  
   
More screams became louder near the light. I shouldn’t have rounded the edge. I shouldn’t have but I did. I peered inside the red glowing room and saw something inexplicable.  
   
I can’t describe to you the sheer magnitude of the chasm that emptied out into a glowing void. The heat was so great that my freezing skin almost melted off. Millions of monsters crawled around the globe that surrounded a ball of flaming light. Their shrieks made my blood boil and my ears bleed. The miner behind me turned the corner at full speed, ready to pounce. As it leapt, I ducked and let it plummet down into the fire. Chanting and awful cackles followed as they watched their brother fall until he vaporized before my eyes, letting out a scratchy “Hheeelllpppp.” Then they all in unison turned their attention toward me.  
   
I was still tired from escaping one, but now millions of clawing grasps stormed behind me as I ran. It felt like days. The tunnels were filled with them, every notch in the wall held a hand waiting to latch onto me. I ran and ran until I saw a glow behind a pile of rocks. I dug for my life. They were heavy, my hands slipped and sliced. My blood only made my hand slide even more. I gave a hard push and fell tens of feet to the grass below.  
   
I could barely grab my bearings until I saw thousands of monsters all tumble out behind me, some stopping and remaining where they were at the doorway upwards. I crashed through the woods, knowing they were behind me. I was starving and weak, my body almost gave up, but I saw a cabin.  
   
I charged for the door, knocking as loud as I could. “Help! Help! Please help me!”  
   
I heard whispering inside, and then silence. A voice bellowing from behind the door, “You lost, boy?”  
   
“Y-yes! I don’t know where I am. I have no supplies. I’m starving, please!”  
   
I heard a grunt and the door swung open. The barrel of a gun looked down at me in front of an old man with white hair. “Y’ don’t sound like one. You followed?” he asked.  
   
I knew exactly what he was talking about, “Followed? What? Who by?” I asked innocently.  
   
He muttered and let me in. A wife and child cowered in the corner, “S’ alright. He’s just lost.”  
   
They scattered for food and water to get my strength back. A hot meal felt so refreshing after what I’d just been through. As we sat at the table, I had some questions.  
   
“You asked if I was followed, sir. Mind if I ask by what? There’s no bear around here.”  
   
He gave a hearty harumph as he leaned in, “Ain’t no more bear around. They ate everything bigger ‘an ‘em.”  
   
“What did?” I asked under a mouthful of food. “I need to get back, so what should I expect out there?” I asked.  
   
There was silence. “You ain’t been out long enough to meet ‘em? You ain’t hear them there screams?” he shot back.  
   
I was silent as I shook my head.  
   
He eyed me suspiciously before answering my question, “They look human but they ain’t. Demons they are. From deep in the Earth.”  
   
I tilted my head in confusion, but listened intently to his story.  
   
“Not far from here, we had us a mine. I worked there for a few years, diggin’ deep down. My daddy worked there, his daddy worked there. ‘Tween the three of us we must’a dug thousands a’ feet below yours. Problem is, we dug too deep.”  
   
“The mine. Someone told me it had an avalanche,” I butted in.  
   
He laughed, “Wu’nt no avalanche, boy. We told the folks that so they don’t get scared. Blew the damn entrance up ‘n sealed ‘em up good. E’ry now and then one digs him a way through, but none got through that main shaft thank lord.”  
   
I pondered for a minute, before utter terror left my body. “What would happen then?” I questioned.  
   
He looked at me with the stankiest face I ever received, “They ‘prolly all pour through,” he said, looking down at my clothes. “You awful torn up fer fallin’ down the top. How long y’been wanderin’?”  
   
I paused in shock, knowing my jig was up. “I-I don’t know,” I said.  
   
He stood up, “You don’t know the days? You can’t read the sun, boy? Where the hell you fall off at?”  
   
Thousands of echoing screams blew through the windows. “Shit. That’s them come to take us all back!”  
   
“Those things aren’t the miners are they?” I asked, standing up and backing away from him.  
   
He got up to my face, “Hell no. Them’s demons you let loose, boy. They only act like them miners ‘cause they mimic patterns! Them screams all they know! They wear them clothes to blends in withs us! The devil is the father of lies! Like you!” he screamed at me. I sprinted from the house.  
   
I could see the town in the distance slowly getting closer, gunshots rang out from the cabin I escaped from and the horde enveloped it. Then, silence.  
   
I made my way finally to the town and found someone to take me away. The nearest city was only a couple hours from Hell’s Ascent. When I made it back I wondered what kind of wrath I wrought upon the world in those few days I was there. Were they really demons, or did they find a whole other world beneath our feet? I won’t know until they come. The flood is only days away from reaching us.
