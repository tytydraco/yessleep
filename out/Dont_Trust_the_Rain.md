Don't Trust the Rain

The night was dark, it smelled like rain, and the air was wet and heavy. The clouds thundered overhead and lightning flashed in the sky. He knew he needed to be quick. The rain would cover his scent but for how long. He needed to hurry. He trudged deeper into the woods carrying the heavy bag farther and farther before finally stopping. The rain was pouring now not a second went by where he didnt feel the rain drops. He dropped the bag and began digging, he felt the rain soaking through his clothes but he wasn't upset about it. In fact he was thrilled, his heart thudded in his chest. He finally stopped digging after maybe 20 minutes. He grabbed the bag and tossed it into the hole, and covered it back up with dirt. He smiled wide, it was finally done. 

 His name was Mathew O'hare Andrews. He was on death row after murdering his wife, Martha Andrews, 2 kids, Allison and Josh, and 8 of his other victims were still missing. He said he wasn't crazy and that the devil had forced him to do it. But there is no doubt in my mind that he murdered all of those people on his own will. - David J Munson

It's been almost a year since that case and I can't stop thinking about it and I feel as though something is crawling inside of me. I've started writing this journal to make sure I'm not going crazy. - David J Munson

It's been two weeks since I last wrote in this journal. I'm sorry for my absence. I just feel like there's something inside me. I feel like it's talking to me and I can't stop thinking about it. It's to the point where I've been getting less and less sleep. Because it won't let me sleep. - David J Munson

It's been a month since my last entry and I can't believe what I'm about to do. I need to kill my wife. He promised he would leave me alone if i killed her so i'm going to, I can't take this anymore. - David J Munson

 His name was David Jhonson Munson, a former police officer and detective who worked on the Mathews case. He was on death row after murdering his wife, Shanon Munson, and child, Allison Munson. He said he wasn't crazy and that the devil had forced him to do it. But there is no doubt in my mind that he murdered all of those people on his own will. However a lot of what he said is similar to what Mathew said. And I'm starting to think It's not a coincidence though. Because I've started hearing things now.  - Johson H Anderson
