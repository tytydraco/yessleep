The old pub's clock struck midnight with a muffled sound, as the scent of tobacco and beer filled the thick, heavy air. The yellowish light of the oil lamps cast dancing shadows on the wooden walls blackened by time. Hardened-faced men clustered around an improvised arena, their excited murmurs blending with the barking of dogs and the occasional squeak of rats.

I, dressed in a worn coat and a slightly crooked top hat, observed the scene with fascinated eyes. I had always been an unusual figure, moving curiously through the underworlds of London that Victorian society preferred to ignore. The animal fights, as cruel as they were, held a strange fascination for me.

As a new round began in the arena, I moved to a less crowded corner, where the shadows were deeper and the cigar smoke formed slow spirals in the air. The worn wood beneath my feet creaked with each step, echoing the chaotic rhythm of the shouts and applause around. Walls covered in soot and forgotten memories seemed to whisper stories of nights as tumultuous as this one.

I picked up my glass of gin and turned to watch the crowd, hoping to find familiar faces among those present. The pub, with its soot-covered walls and secrets, was a place where I felt at ease, far from society's rigid rules.

During one of the brutal spectacles of that night, I remembered a story. Some time ago, there had been news of a killer on the loose. He committed crimes in the most cruel way: killing a person, cutting the body into parts, and throwing it into the River Thames. The body parts were found gradually, but never all at once.

I lived by that river. I was never surprised to find parts of the victims' bodies, but I can't deny that passing by there at night was truly terrifying. The streets were completely deserted, and the lighting was scarce, making it the perfect place for a killer to commit a crime. I can't deny that I was somewhat apprehensive about going home. I decided to spend more time at the pub, hoping to occupy my mind with other things and push that unpleasant thought away.

The fresh night air was a relief after the stifling heat of the pub, and I walked slowly along the Thames, enjoying the calm that only London at night could offer. The soft glow of gas lamps cast a faint light over the water, creating reflections that danced like mysterious shadows. The riverbanks were almost deserted, except for a few anchored boats and the occasional group of night workers passing by quickly.

I followed the cobblestone path that wound along the river, my steps echoing softly on the pavement. The breeze carried with it the nauseating odor of sewage, a pungent touch of waste, and the constant smell of garbage thrown into the river. The stench made my stomach turn, making the walk less pleasant. The city lights in the distance formed a golden halo, but here, by the river, everything seemed darker, more intimate. My only companions were distant murmurs and the occasional sound of passing boats.

Suddenly, a shiver ran down my spine. I looked back but saw no one. Perhaps it was just my imagination or the silence of the night playing tricks on my mind. I continued walking, more cautiously now, my steps quicker, though I tried to stay calm. The rumor about the killer who dismembered bodies and threw them into the river had been circulating for weeks, but it always seemed like a story to scare the young, something distant and unreal.

My gaze fixed on a figure approaching from the shadow of a distant streetlight. He was hooded, and I could only see the dark outlines of his face. Before I could react, he appeared by my side, his hand closing firmly around my arm.

I tried to resist, but his strength was impressive, and soon I felt a sense of vertigo as he pulled me into the dark alley that stretched along the riverbank. The shadows closed in around us, and the sound of the city seemed to disappear, swallowed by the silent night. My heart pounded in my chest, each beat a scream of panic, as I desperately tried to escape from that hand dragging me into the unknown. The last thing saw before everything went dark was the silhouette of the river, shimmering in the distance like a mirror of my own darkness.

I was lying on the cold ground, my vision blurred by tears and the throbbing pain in every inch of my body. The steel blade gleamed under the faint light, approaching with torturous slowness. Each second felt like an eternity, a prolonged torment.

I felt the first cut like a line of fire tearing through my skin. The pain was so intense it almost made me lose consciousness, but something inside me kept me alert, trapped in a nightmare that seemed endless. I tried to scream, but my voice came out as a muffled groan.

My body no longer obeyed me; I was paralyzed, helpless. I saw his hands working methodically, each movement precise and calculated. The air was filled with the metallic smell of blood, my blood, pooling around me.

Panic mingled with agony, forming a suffocating sensation. My vision began to blur, small black dots dancing in front of me. With each new cut, a part of me seemed to detach, fading away slowly.

I wanted it to end, for the pain to cease, but time seemed frozen. I felt when he began to separate my limbs, a searing pain beyond description. My body became a collection of parts, devoid of the life that once inhabited it.

The darkness finally began to envelop me, the pain diminishing as I drifted away. My last thought was a mix of relief and sadness, a surrender to the inevitable. Then, everything went dark, and the pain finally ceased.
