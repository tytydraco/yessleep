[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zhhq66/i_think_everyone_in_my_town_wants_to_kill_me_part/)

Typing this from my bedroom right now, figured someone should know about what's happening out here. I just moved into my new home a few weeks ago. I served two tours in Iraq and one of my old army buddies was able to hook me up with a new job in a new town. I was getting bored of the scenery in my childhood city and this new job paid better so I decided "Fuck it, why not?". Sold my old house and bought a new one in my new neighborhood. It was a nice neighborhood, it was small and most people knew each other. The town wasn't very big either, we had some mom and pop shops but that was about it, you had to drive further out to get to your Walmart's and Academy's and what not.

It all starting going to hell when people heard news that a girl had gotten stabbed to death while walking her dog at night. It was tragic, people in this place never really experience any crime outside of teenagers drawing penises on buildings so there was a lot of paranoia going around. It only got worse from there on, people starting beating the shit out of each other in the streets. I heard gunshots and screaming throughout the day and the night. What was strange about these crimes is that people never took anything, they didn't mug people they just killed each other out of nowhere.

And it wasn't just crime either, people yelled at each other over minor things, they were more spiteful, everyone was just so damn angry all the time. My neighbors started yelling at me for shit that didn't even make sense, said my potted plants were violating HOA rules or some shit. I bought a rifle to keep myself in case shit went down.

And it did about two hours ago. I was eating dinner when I heard gunshots close to me, like right across the street. People starting screaming, I couldn't make anything out though. I ran upstairs and grabbed my rifle and locked all my doors. I was in the living room when all of a sudden I heard banging at my front door, like someone was trying to break it down. I have a bar in my kitchen that gives me a full view of the front door so I ran over there to use the bar as cover as I was pretty sure those fuckers had guns. I could multiple people shouting shit like "Break it down!", "Kill him!". Most of what I could hear just was gibberish and the occasional slur or swear word. I had my rifle sights fixed on the door, waiting for them to get in. The anticipation was killing me, I could see the wood in my door start to splinter and crack.

Finally they bust open the door. The first dude to come in has baseball bat covered in blood and is foaming at the mouth. Basic training kicks in and I shoot the guy in the chest twice and he drops to the floor. Death isn't like movies or tv, they don't go flying back, they just drop like a sack of potatoes, sometimes they twitch and piss themselves before they die. They next guy comes in and opens fire with a pistol. I duck behind the bar and lean out from the side, I catch him off guard and shoot him. I see outside, there are at least three more people, two with hammers, one with nothing but his fists. They charge in despite seeing two other guys get mowed down. They just started screaming, the fucking screaming. It was inhuman, it sounded like they had been screaming all night and tore their vocal cords. I shot them, all of them and painted my entrance dark red.

I knew one of those guys, it was this old biker dude, average tough guy, "These kids can't look up from their phones!" type guy. He was unrecognizable, stomping his feet and yelling the most horrid shit I've ever heard. At least in Iraq I had the pleasure of not being able to understand the enemy. I shut the door and barricaded it with a table. I've locked myself in my room from where I'm typing this now. I can hear screaming and gunshots, it sounds like a fucking war zone. I don't glance out the window in case someone sees me and tries to break in. I called the cops but got no answer. I starting looking up news websites to see if this was happening somewhere else. Nothing. Am I going insane? I can hear police sirens right now, cops yelling at people to put their hands up and then gunshots. In a hour if shit doesn't calm down I'll make my way to the police station and try and see if someone can help me. Posting this here because I figured someone needs to know what's going on. I'll post an update if I don't get killed.
