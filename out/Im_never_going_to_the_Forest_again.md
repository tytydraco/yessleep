I’d like to start out by saying that this happened a long time ago and the emotions that led me to take the actions I did are long gone. I wouldn’t describe myself as happy, but I’m much better off than I was back then. I know that there is hope, what I was contemplating was a permanent solution, blah blah blah. That’s not what I’m hoping to get out of posting this. I feel that because it’s been so long, I can confidently separate what I was going through from what I saw in the forest that day. I also feel that I have finally arrived at the conclusion that what I saw that night was real.

To understand what I was doing in the woods, I think you need to understand why I was there. If it wasn’t obvious, I was there to kill myself. I didn’t have a lot going for me back then and losing my job was the final straw. I decided to do it in the state park about 30 minutes from my parents’ house where I lived. I picked that place because I had some interesting memories there growing up. Even as a teenager, I was a loner and that park was a place of solitude for me. I was there nearly every weekend. I say nearly since they shut it down for a month because bodies were found with some unusual markings. After they realized they couldn’t figure out what caused those people to lose their eyes and drop dead, they opened it up again. Some people felt it was a hoax, and honestly it probably was. They never released any more information about the supposed victims so it was really just a big ball of nothing in my opinion. Even the stories and everything surrounding them didn’t stop me from going every weekend. Looking back, I understand it wasn’t great for me and so much solitude in the woods probably didn’t help my mental health. But I couldn’t stop. I loved how the forest felt when I was there. Even on days when I wasn’t planning on going, I’d literally dream about it. I missed the way the trees moved and how it felt to smell that fresh outdoor air. I think that was another reason I felt it was the place to do it. It felt like it was meant to be, you know?

Anyway, in the days leading up to it, I hadn’t gone up there in a while. I was already on thin ice at work and I couldn’t keep missing more days. But when I found out that I was being downsized, the park called me again. It felt like I was going home when I finally got there. No one was going to ask me what my plans were. No one would ask why I’m still working at a restaurant so many years after all of us graduated. No judgemental tones. Just peace. I decided to stop at the closest gas station and bring some wood for a campfire. It was a Tuesday afternoon that I went, so I knew the campsites would be empty. The park itself was mildly popular at its height but ever since the shutdown after the bodies, it never really regained the visitors that were once there. I found the campsite I wanted and sat down. I started a fire and used the remaining light of the day to write out my final notes to my family and friends. Once it got dark, all I had was the light of the fire. It was a crisp autumn day so the fire warmed me up nicely. Once the light started dying down, I figured it was my turn too. I realized that this was my last night on Earth so I decided to take it all in. I wanted to just close my eyes and feel what the forest was telling me. I was expecting to hear the usual crickets, the comforting wind, and maybe even the distant car driving on the freeway. I wanted to smell the burning wood and the familiar scent of the Douglas Fir that surrounded me. You might think that these are details that don’t matter. What was important was that what I expected wasn’t there.

What I heard was absolutely nothing.

What I smelt was absolutely nothing.

It’s like I was sitting in my living room and had my headphones on or something. Any other day, I would have been unnerved. But I took this as a sign. Everything was gone and it was my turn to join it. At this point, I knew it was time. I won’t go into what method I used or what my exact plans were. While I’ve been somewhat flippant about this, I’m able to do that after years of therapy and medication. Just know that I was prepping what I needed to finally leave it all behind. The forest was completely dark at this point as well, other than the small fire that was close to puttering out. As I was ironing out the final touches, I heard what ultimately turned this into an experience worth sharing. It was a simple word and in any other context, I wouldn’t have really given it a second thought. But with the silence that had fallen on the woods, the sound cut through so I could hear it as clear as glass.

“Hello.”

It sounds silly and I’m sure you’re thinking that I imagined it. I know I would if someone told me. But without getting into detail about what I was doing to end it, I’ll just say that I hadn’t even started yet. My mind was clear other than the fact that I had absolute determination on what I was planning to do. But as you might expect, this gave me pause. Thinking back on it, what was most unnerving was how it sounded. It was clearly a male voice but what was off about it was how it sounded. It wasn’t exactly someone saying it to greet me but it was as though it was a statement. Like someone asked it “what is the word that people say to greet each other” and it responded with that. What was more bizarre was that it sounded somewhat robotic. Almost like when you tell Google translate to speak what you’ve typed out. It gave me pause but not enough to stop me from doing what I came here to do. I assumed I imagined it like anyone else would and got on with it. At this point, I’ll have to describe where I’m at because the location of everything becomes important. I’m not the best at describing this sort of thing so bear with me. The fire pit was at the end of a path that went about 50 feet off of the main trail. The landing I was at was also below some steps that were surrounded by a thick level of brush. The fire pit itself was in the middle along with a single bench and room for a small tent. This whole landing was actually on a cliff that overlooked pine trees that were probably 50 to 70 feet high. I loved this area because the spot was not only somewhat hidden but also extremely easy to get to if you knew what you were doing.

Anyway, when I saw the lights coming on the tree line across the cliff, I figured I was losing it. There was absolutely no way someone could climb up there. And I know for a fact it wasn’t just light that was being shined up from the bottom because I would have seen the beam. The lights were green horizontal lines that were touching the tips of the pine trees and were appearing and disappearing. Imagine lines that would appear and disappear on your computer screen but they’re on the trees. I can’t think of any other way to explain it. It was also extremely strange that they weren’t really mapping to the tree tips if that makes sense. You know how if you shine a laser pointer across a few things in your house and you can tell its being projected onto the item because it goes over and under? Well what was strange about these lines was that they were just covering the trees with the completely solid green color. I definitely thought it was my own vision going but no matter what I did like rubbing my eyes, using my water bottle to splash my face, they wouldn’t stop. The lights continued and started to act more erratically. I couldn’t stop staring at them. At the moment, I figured I was just entranced by the unique sight but looking back, I realized I was likely frozen and couldn’t move if I wanted to. While it was happening, I remembered why I was there and what I wanted to do. The deep sense of apathy came over me once more and I suddenly didn’t care about some stupid lights. I’m leaving. Why should I? Once those emotions came back, the lights stopped. Everything else that I was thinking left my head and what remained was one thought:

Move deeper into the forest.

I didn’t realize it at the time but that single thought probably saved my life. Honestly, at the time, I just figured there would be more seclusion. I wasn’t convinced that what I saw wasn’t just a person messing with me or trying to stop what I was doing since it was pretty obvious, though I’m not sure how they could see me. I gathered what I needed, put out the fire and started up the path to the main trail using my phone as a flashlight. I was somewhat aware of the fact that I’d never been here after dark before but given that I was here to die, the black unknown that my light couldn’t see wasn’t as scary to me as it should have been. However, the once welcoming brush that surrounded the rocky steps felt different now. It wasn’t necessarily scary per se, but it did feel wrong. I knew this place backwards after all of my years of coming here, but for some reason, I felt like I was lost. The brush swayed back and forth in what I would assume was the wind, but I could barely hear it. It wasn’t as quiet as it was before, because it felt like the sounds of the forest that I should be hearing were coming in and out, like someone was messing with a volume dial on a speaker. I kept moving and finally reached the main trail. I was vaguely aware of where I needed to go but honestly, with how lost I felt, I was kind of just walking in a random direction. I started looking down at the trail so I was at least ensuring to follow it to the next campsite. The forest noises were really throwing me for a loop and it really was unnerving me that the trees and brush were swaying even though there was no wind. My head was pointed down now and I was still frantically following the path which was illuminated by the light on my phone. 

At this point, I forgot why I was even in the forest. All that was there was just me and my phone light and the blackness between the trees. The combination of the noise modulation and the trees moving felt like I was being digested and being pushed further toward the middle of the woods.

Suddenly, the sounds stopped, even though the forest was still moving. It was quiet again, just like before. The change in noise got me to look up from the path, at which point I heard the voice again, but right in my ear.

“How are you”

I let out a cry and started running away. I wasn’t sure where but I must have gone off the path since I ended up in a clearing, surrounded by a bunch of trees. I regained my composure and shined my flashlight around me to see where I was and where I should go. I saw trees to my north and south and to my east. They were still moving, just much more rapidly than before. I shined it to my west and saw a figure standing there with its back turned toward me.

It was probably 10 feet away. The trees around it were still swaying but it stood absolutely still. It was clearly a person. It had arms, legs, and something resembling a head. It was then that I registered that it was wearing the same clothes that I was. I think I noticed this because I knew what clothes I wanted to die in and was very intentional about wearing them today. To see them on whatever was in front of me would have been impossible for me to miss. Whatever its head should have been was shaking and twitching as I heard what I could only describe as wheezing. It would have this long, high noise and it would let out a sigh. It was almost rhythmic.

It was then that I noticed that I couldn’t move.

I knew that in that moment, if it turned around, I would probably die. Not because it would kill me but because I, under no circumstance, should see what is on the other side of that head. It was the most important thing in the world to me at that point. With effort, I closed my eyes, which could still thankfully move and the tears started flowing on their own, along with the sweat that also came. However, even though I was scared out of my wits, I realized I was also ready to go. I remembered why I was here. My loved ones would still find my notes that I had with me and that would be it. The tears stopped and I finally felt at peace. I was ready for whatever this thing would do to me and frankly, I didn’t really care. The moment this realization hit, my knees buckled and I realized I could move. I opened my eyes and it was gone. The sounds of the forest had returned and I realized that I was on the main path again. The trees weren’t moving anymore, or at least not like they were before. I heard the crickets, the small animals running around at night, and even some mosquitoes buzzing here and there. I knew the ordeal was over because I knew where I was again in the forest. It was the familiar place that I grew up with once more. However, given everything that happened, I was done with what the forest had in store for me. Without thinking too much, I ran on the main path and out of the woods.

I haven’t been back since then, even though I still dream about it. Not regularly, but enough to make me want to at least share this with someone. I’ll be honest, I think it's calling me but I know better than to answer. I’m not sure what it was that I saw, but I know that I will never go back there again. Since that experience, I’ve really stepped up and taken care of my mental health a bit more. I would say that it was my mind trying to save me from what I was planning on doing but I’ve had day dreams and hallucinations before and they were never that vivid. Believe me if you want or don’t. I know what I saw and strangely enough, it helped me. I live in a city now, in another state, far away from any trees. The park’s hold on me is much less than before and even though the dreams haven’t stopped, I have too much to live for these days. I hope to never find out what that was or why it happened. But it saved me from myself and for that, I’m honestly grateful.
