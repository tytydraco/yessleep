I've been a writer since the ripe old age of nine. As an avid reader, I ate up every single story ever put in front of me. Once I'd absorbed every piece of fiction in the young readers section of the library I *yearned* for more. I found that I had to write in order to read. I read my own writing over and over and over and began to hone my craft. I knew how to write what I wanted to read. I learned to write what others wanted to read. In my lifetime I've written what has to, at this point, be hundreds if not thousands of short stories, all somehow drenched in horror. 

I remember the story that I wrote that made me want to be a writer. It was a one-off requirement for my high school sophomore English class. The assignment was simple: create a vignette that would fit into a popular *specific* World War I novel. I don't feel as though I can name which one, but I can sprinkle in that it has recently made headlines due to its adaptation. 

I loved my English classes, but I hated my teacher in that specific class. She seemed as though she had never escaped high school herself. She frequently spent class sitting with the "popular" girls, engaging in gossip (that the rest of the class could overhear) that put down classmates of mine, some of which were present and listening in that very same moment. On top of that unprofessionalism, she hated me. She made it clear. But what, in the end, she couldn't deny, was my writing ability. I submitted my vignette, expecting to be torn apart, and instead all that was written upon the top of my paper was "This piece brought tears to my eyes. You should be a writer." That day I learned that your greatest inspiration in life doesn't have to be your greatest champion. It can instead be a single, raw, sentence from a reader reviewing you, letting you know how you made them feel. From that day forward I wrote relentlessly. Even if a piece was complete and utter shite, at least I wrote it down. At least I practiced. 

That piece that made the flame in my writing furnace burn even brighter was outside of my horror scope but was still somehow horrific all the same. It was a piece about a dying soldier who knew his wife was pregnant and, in his dying moments, had to make peace with the fact that he would never meet his child. This character, in turn, ended up being my first visitor. 

It has been fifteen years. I truly cannot even remember my teacher's name, but somehow my character remembered me. In my dreams he began to revisit me, bleeding out, dying, stuttering his last words and imploring me to take the photo he always held in his pocket of his wife. He hoped I'd find her and let her know that in his final moments all he wished for was for her to know that all he thought of in that moment was her and his unborn child. This was a wish I could not fulfill, as I had written him as a fictional character ninety-four years after the cessation of WWI. 

He was not my only visitor, and for the most part I could tell my characters the things that would soothe them into a peaceful "afterlife." Yes, I'll convey your message, was most of what I found myself saying, and they peacefully drifted off into the ether. However, my most recent visitor has posed quite the challenge. 

I had written, maybe four years ago, a story about a girl who had been abducted. Horrible injustices had been endured by her. A horrible death awaited her within my prose. Writing her journey itself had caused me discomfort. I often shied away from finishing her story due to the fact that writing it had caused me so much turmoil and, unlike her, I wasn't the one living the moments that I myself had brought to life. 

It was a rainy Wednesday when she first visited me. She came in the night, between claps of thunder, urging her voice to be heard. I was her only tether to the world, and I was the one responsible for the fact that her only living experience was the pain that she felt day in and day out. 

I was fast asleep, and the dream began. Usually they only visit me in dreams. She requested I tell her mother what happened to her, and as usual I told her I would. I had long known there was no point in telling them I could not fulfill their wish; I could not tell them that they were not *real.* When I awoke from that dream I thought that all was said and done, as it had been with each of the others. But this particular character was unrelenting... by my own design.

She was a vivacious fifteen-year-old. She lived her life to the fullest before she found herself walking home from school, a stereotypical white van pulling up beside her and snatching her before she could even begin to think about running away to safety. She was held in a basement for three years where she had to endure torture no human should ever have to face, all for the purpose of scaring the heck out of anyone who read her story.

One winter night, heavy snow falling just outside, I was sat comfortably in my favorite chair in front of the fire working on my most recent short horror story. The house was silent save the crackling of the wood within the hearth, a glass of untouched wine just within my reach, as I click clack clacked upon my keyboard. 

Suddenly the roaring fire snuffed itself out. All transient noises ceased, and suddenly my home was silent. As much as I strained, I couldn't make out a single noise. As I attempted to listen, I noticed instead the hairs on the back of my neck slowly standing up, one by one, alerting me to imminent danger within the immediate vicinity. 

It began with a slow, rhythmic tap along the wall directly to my left. The taps grew into true raps, and then feverish pounding that confounded all of my senses and forced my hands to my ears in a desperate attempt to drown out the all-consuming noise that surrounded me. 

From the pounding began the pinching which escalated into scratching, drawing blood all along my forearm, leaving four distinct scratch marks as the person responsible dragged their jagged nails slowly along my skin, making it clear they were not to be ignored. 

Suddenly the fire roared to life, much greater than it had been before it had been snuffed, hungrily consuming the wood that remained within the hearth. All noise resumed at once, overwhelming my senses, causing me to clasp my hands over my ears. My eyes were shut tight, trying to adjust to the environmental stimulation, and when I dared to peek I saw her for the fire time, a silhouette against the raging fire, completely black and somehow indistinguishable but completely recognizable all the same. Within moments she came into clear focus, just as I had described her all those years ago. Stringy black hair barely kissing her shoulders. Her expression sour, as though I were the scum of the earth, as if I were the dirtbag that I had created who had inflicted such atrocities upon her. 

She stood, and she stared. She stared for such a long while that the raging fire had begun to die down into embers that elicited a subtle glow, bouncing off of the sharp cheekbones I myself had described. Her expression remained unchanged; she glared at me with absolute disgust. 

"I never escaped him," she told me after prolonged eye contact. 

"I know," I responded, wondering just how much it was that she knew about her existence.

Almost reading my thoughts, she responded, "You created me."

"Yes, I did," I responded shakily.

"Why?" she asked, the absolute hatred never leaving her eyes.

I couldn't find an answer. I couldn't figure how to explain that I write stories like that for peoples *entertainment.* That eliciting fear in the masses entices them to continue to read what it is I write. 

She continued to glower at me, knowingly. I felt as though she could see right through anything I thought and anything I might say. 

"I just write what comes to me," is all I could say.

Parents were a specific demographic of mine when I wrote her, and they all responded with their own creative ways of killing whoever would dare to inflict such torture upon their daughter. But she had no parents who would do that for her. 

As though she knew this, she told me, "Well, you can make it right," she looked me up and down expectantly. 

She made it clear that night that she expected me to find those who would exact crimes just like the villain of her story and make them pay. She proved her intention of ensuring I complied through showing me exactly the physical pain she can inflict upon my body. She can summon all the pain I inflicted upon her and, in turn, make me feel it in real time. 

I'm scared, and I don't know who else to ask. I need to make her go away, and I've never dealt with an entity like this. Does anyone have any idea about how to help her find peace? I'm a writer, not a vigilante. I can't fulfill her [wish.](https://www.reddit.com/r/cmpaizspooks/s/v2xJeBdZBA)
