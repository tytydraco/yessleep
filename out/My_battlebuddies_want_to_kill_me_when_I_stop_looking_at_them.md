It wasn’t my first rodeo in Iraq. In fact, it had been my third deployment there so I knew what I was heading into – but nothing could’ve prepared me for what would happen during that night.

Ramadi was a city on edge, the kind of place where shadows moved faster than the wind, and every corner could hide an enemy. My team – Rodriguez, Markus and Alex – were my brothers in arms. We had each other's backs through thick and thin and were running together for three months now. Rodriguez was the jokester, always lightening the mood with some ill-timed gallows humour, Markus the quiet strategist, and Alex, the glue holding us together with his unshakeable calm when shit began to hit the fan.

Despite it being one of the worst places to be during the Iraq war, somehow, I ended up in the most boring corner of this place – probably for the better. However, I’d take being blown to bits by an IED or getting a bullet in the head from an insurgent any day over what I’m dealing with now. In retrospect, I should have noticed it immediately – but let’s not get ahead of myself.

The three and me have been through some tough shit together. Firefights where we get dangerously low on ammunition and can only hope for a miracle because our supplies faded faster than expected, a teammate taking a bullet or a grenade fragment to a vital body part in the seemingly safest situations or running out of fuel in a dangerous, out in the open spot with a piece of shit Humvee that just won’t start back up anymore. Recently though, those situations became increasingly more prevalent – just for me and my team though.

Upon returning to HQ, all of a sudden, our ammunition supplies were right there in the supply bag, every other squad in our rather “safe” part of the city never seemed to take a hit or disturbance and the mechanic just ended up laughing at us after inserting the key into the ignition and starting the four wheeled monster like child’s play. I couldn’t wrap my head around it. Why did we always get the short end of the stick? That sure as shit explained itself fast in the following days though.

It was an unusually hot day when I got separated from my buddies – hotter than anything I’ve ever experienced before, but that was about the only thing that felt off at the start of that day. Me and the rest of my team were enjoying our time in the chow hall before taking up our duties and being sent out on our usual patrol throughout a couple of streets around our HQ. No weather warnings, no increased insurgent activity – “nothing out of the ordinary, just the usual bullshit” – how often we’d hear this phrase in that shithole of a city. “Yeah right.” I thought every single time “For you guys sure.” I knew something was out there, waiting for us – for our team specifically - already, trying to fuck us – and not in a good way, be it radio interference, a bad leg for one of my guys or a rogue civilian turned insurgent. It was none of those things. It was something way worse – and it was waiting specifically for me.

The sandstorm hit us out of nowhere. Radio interference fucked us at the same time, so it was even harder to communicate with my mates once I lost sight of them. We were spread out more than usual, walking around an outskirt area of the town checking for signs of civilian stragglers. I barely had time to pull the goggles down from my helmet before I could feel my face being harassed by the whipping winds and tiny sand grains trying their best to burrow into my skin. It was hard to breathe, harder than usual, I thought, even after having pulled up my shemagh for comfort. It was hard to make out anything at all really, but I could’ve sworn the sunlight and sky during this storm never looked like that before – an unnatural, very saturated shade of red began to coat everything in sight. I felt scared for the first time in weeks – as in the shitting bricks kind of scared. I was separated from my guys, even though they were just a couple feet away from me moments before, I could hear them, but not see them and the world seemed to want to swallow me whole right then and there as if the apocalypse had started just now without any warning signs.

I called out to them – Rodriguez, Markus and Alex. I could make out their faint yelling, but could never spot their silhouettes in the madness of that sandstorm. I tried to navigate my way back towards the outer edge of the city, trying to find shelter in a nearby building – trying to make it  back to HQ in this sandstorm would be a suicide mission – bad visibility and exhaustion would make us an easy target and we’d have no way in hell spotting an IED – nobody was keen on being torn apart and being sent back home in bits and pieces – apart from maybe Rodriguez, that maniac. I swear I’ve never seen another soldier who was so hellbent on pulling off the most dangerous and ludicrous plans and manoeuvres – whilst laughing about it in the process of course.

That’s where Markus was probably the exact opposite. Quiet, collected and stern. Kind of a poker face that guy. However, he’s a hell of a shot and got us throughout our current deployment with relative safety. Any plan with a chance of one of our guys being in grave danger was immediately dismissed and even though I’d call him my brother in arms any day of the week, I’m sure he’d save his own skin before taking a bullet for me or Alex if push really came to shove for real. Sure as shit can’t say the same thing about Rodriguez – a crazy battle angel that guy. Then again – Markus and I have a family back home, Rodriguez doesn’t. You go into this hellhole with a different mindset knowing you’ve got loved ones back home – like Alex.

Alex “only” has his girlfriend waiting for him back in the states, but shit, it’s written on his face that he regrets joining up and being sent on deployment every single day. I think if he was able to, he’d kick the next pilot out of a plane and fly straight back home himself. Rodriguez and Markus are doing their best to comfort Alex when shit gets rough but Alex will probably never get accustomed to what it’s like being stuck in a warzone. The fidgeting, the instinct to head for cover once a bombardment begins but most of all the goodness in his heart is what betrays him. I don’t think Alex can kill. I don’t think he ever has killed before. He’s a pacifist – a pacifist to the point where before pulling the trigger on the enemy he’ll hesitate to the point he’ll end up getting himself shot. Why’d he join? Maybe money? Maybe peer pressure? Maybe pride? Beats me.

I ended up stumbling into a small run-down building. The civilians here have probably been evacuated for weeks already like the rest of the buildings. Here and there we’d pick up a couple of stragglers, but nothing that we couldn’t handle. The windows were barred and light barely shone through the gaps of the wooden boards, which also meant that the wind and sand were mainly being kept away from my current hiding spot. I tried radioing HQ and my team multiple times to no avail, so I decided on sitting this one out. I put down my rifle next to me within reach and huddled up into a corner of the building, making sure to keep the entrances in sight and waited. The sandstorm assaulted the buildings of the city relentlessly – it sounded like rain on a metal roof – just harsher and more violent. It felt unnatural. Sooner rather than later I lost track of time. How long had this been going on for? Fifteen minutes – an hour – multiple? I began to feel tired after a while. As if something was eating up all of my energy ever since I sought shelter here. That storm…something wasn’t right. In my mind, all I wanted to do was get up, get my bearings and get out of here as fast as possible, despite the storm – but what really happened was that I ended up falling asleep.

I frantically reached for my rifle after being woken up by Markus, Rodriguez and Alex. My eyes needed to adjust to the brightness of the daylight seeping in from the windows, now that the storm had faded. “Brother, we thought we lost you out there!” Rodriguez exclaimed with genuine worry in his voice. “You know I’m a tough guy.” I joked, after being helped up by Markus. I froze in fear just moments after though. There was Alex, standing in front of me, face pale as ice pointing my service-pistol right at me, with his finger on the trigger. “You’re gonna need this…I guess.” he said. It felt like he wasn’t looking at me, but through me. Like he was looking at something behind my face, and not at my face. I don’t know what sent shivers up my spine more, the face that I’ve never seen Alex look like that or that he’s pointing a loaded gun at me, his index finger on the trigger and slightly pulling on it. “Are you fucked in the head!?” I shouted, shoving his hand away from me and gripping the pistol tightly, yanking it out of his hands. “That thing is loaded man, get your shit together!” I added, stumbling away from him, looking at Rodriguez and Markus for support.

They brushed it off. Rodriguez just said that Alex’s always been a little off, and that he’s probably just tired from the storm. Markus agreed with him and decided that it’s best not to make a fuss about it. Alex’s stare followed me throughout the room. An almost robotic “Sorry.” escaped his mouth. I only mumbled some curses to myself, adjusted my gear and made sure I was still in one piece, before looking at Markus. “We ready to head out?” I asked. “Let’s get back to HQ, whatever just happened out there is something entirely different than from what I’m used to. They need to get better weather intel or give us a Humvee that actually fucking works for a change! Going out there on foot during these circumstances is suicide for fresh meat – like him.” I looked over at Alex, then back at Rodriguez and Markus. “One event like this and he’s already losing his shit. This isn’t safe.” Alex was shuffling back and forth in his boots a bit, trying to get out of my field of vision for some reason. “Hey, do you think hiding from me makes this any less serious?” I shouted at him. During all of my deployments, I never had a friendly soldier intentionally point a loaded gun at me – that was a core principle you never forget. We started walking towards HQ shortly after this fallout.

The three of us walked for what seemed twenty minutes, trying to navigate throughout a city block where everything looked the same and now that the storm had swept over the city, some signs and waypoints weren’t where they used to be anymore – just swept away by the unnatural force of that sandstorm. And that’s how it started. That’s when I heard it from behind me. “Please don’t shoot.” in a distorted, haunting Arabic voice.

I don’t think Alex noticed that I saw what he did, when I turned around swiftly, visibly disturbed by what I’d heard – but his dominant hand quickly darted away from his holster, which his M9 gradually sank back into. He’d pulled it out – trying to draw it. Did he go completely nuts now? “What’s wrong?” Markus asked, looking at me in a puzzled way. “Did you guys not hear that?” I replied, a shaky tone in my voice. “You sure you’re not losing your shit too, Mr. Commando?” Rodriguez joked, raising a brow at me as he turned around but kept walking, both his arms resting on his rifle which hung from its sling in front of him. I blinked a couple of times, wiping the sweat from my face. That voice made the hairs on my neck stand up. I stopped dead in my tracks and shoved Alex in front of me. “I’m keeping an eye on you now – if you’re trying to fuck with me, it won’t work, son. You slip up one more time, I’m reporting your ass to command. This isn’t funny. Leave the jokes to Rodriguez.” Alex didn’t say a thing, but only tilted his head in a creepy manner before taking up his position in front of me and we all started walking again.

We found HQ. Well, what was left of it at least. Where camp should’ve been, there was only the empty building, trash and sand. Not a trace of our squad, nor command. Nothing. It felt like a fever dream. We decided to make camp and spend the night here, since the twenty-minute walk turned into a three-hour search mission until we found this place – we were absolutely exhausted. I kept an eye on Alex, and apart from his strange head-tilt and occasional awkward breathing, things seemed to be fine again with him – as fine as the circumstances allowed, at least. I closed my eyes to the sound of distant gunfire and occasional numb yelling – just where were we and how come we haven’t found friendlies?

The next few days passed in a blur, the haunting voice still echoing in my mind from yesterday. The gunfire stopped. Not a single shot could be heard. No wind, no choppers or aircraft above us. Still no radio transmission. Something was off with my team – and this city. I couldn’t shake the feeling that I wasn’t in the real Ramadi anymore. That sandstorm swallowed me up and spat me out somewhere else. Everything about this just felt slightly off. The windows of some huts and buildings were just too intact for the amount of war this shithole had seen. The sky’s colour was wrong. Water didn’t taste the way I remembered it tasting. The expiration dates on our MREs were wrong. And I began to figure out why Alex was acting so strange yesterday – because today he was fine – but Rodriguez was off.

He wasn’t laughing. He was talking in a numb manner. His movements were devoid of life - and the scariest bit? He kept trying to stay outside of my field of view. Then it dawned on me.
