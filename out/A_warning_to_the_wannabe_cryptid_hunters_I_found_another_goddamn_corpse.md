This time of year is really something. Frost is painting the windowpanes, the snowflakes look like tiny stars falling from the sky and I found a corpse on my property today. Or rather, one of the security guards did. He called me right away, talking in that sort of low, empty tone. He sounded dead inside, for lack of a better word.

"Miss Novak.'' He fell silent for a few seconds, like he hadn't really thought of what to say next. "Uh, you should come to the red meadow, I think."

"What do you mean, *you think?*" I asked, a little annoyed seeing as I'd been busy with some computer work at that moment. I instantly regretted my brusque tone.

"There's a body." 

I nearly dropped my cell phone. Suddenly feeling weirdly disconnected from myself, I staggered to my feet and began fumbling for my keys. "I'll be right there, Gus," I promised, voice trembling, before ending the call.

The red meadow is a wide plain right outside the eastern edge of the woods. It's full of these strange scarlet flowers. They're about the same size as a regular old daisy, and their petals are shaped a bit like tiny hearts. Weirdly enough, we've been unable to identify them. There are many flowers *like* them, but none are an exact match. My father used to be obsessed with them—he was always picking and drying them. He never found out more about them either, though.

Today, a blanket of snow covered the meadow, yet the intense red of the flowers still managed to shine through in some places. I could see Fergus standing near the treeline, stiffly waving to me. His shallow, labored breaths rose from his lips in tiny plumes of vapor as he jogged to meet me halfway.

"I didn't see it happen," he said dryly. "I heard screams, I followed them, and there he was. Whatever did it was already gone by the time I got there."

He led me over to the body. A man in his thirties, dressed in much the same functional clothes as the first cryptid hunter who'd found his way onto my property not too long ago. My head was reeling. How did these guys keep getting in?

"I think he died of fright," Gus remarked. "When I found him, he was lying on his stomach, with one of his arms underneath him."

"Why'd you roll him over?"

"Checking for injuries. Found nothing. Not even a trace of blood. Look at his face though."

I sighed. I'd admittedly avoided doing so up to that point. I knelt down next to the dead man, gathering my large, far too voluminous skirt at my sides. I raised my eyes to meet the corpse's empty gaze. Shaking my head, I tried to chase the flashing memories of my little brother's severed head from my mind. All those who die in fear seem to share this same look. Their horror remains imprinted on their contorted grimace, preserved for those unfortunate enough to happen upon their bodies.

Fergus was probably right. The way he'd found this man suggested he'd been on his way out of the woods, presumably running from something. Another thrill-seeker who'd had too much of a good thing. It was even sadder to see him *here*, beyond the treeline. He'd nearly made it out alive. Then the adrenaline must have overtaxed his heart, and he'd fallen over, clutching his chest. I wondered if he'd realized what was happening. Maybe not. Maybe he'd been so terrified by whatever was chasing him that he hadn't even seen it coming. Either way, in his last moments, there had only been him, this fearsome unknown entity and his exerted, failing body. What a shitty way to go.

"Are you okay, Gus? Do you wanna go home?"

"You need me here, don't you?"

"I do, but I don't want you to go around like nothing happened when you've just found a body," I argued.

"I'll be okay. It's not the first time we've had a death here."

I gave him a concerned frown. He didn't sound all that convincing. He obviously didn't want me to fuss, so I didn't, but it felt crappy leaving him on that note. I told him to follow his normal route, hoping the rest of the day would go smoothly for him. To me, however, this corpse meant a lot more work. First off, I would have to dispose of him. It's not like we go entirely unnoticed out here—we could get a visit from the police in due time. Now, my family has maybe two or three friends among the local authorities who know what's really going on in these woods. They're likely to see to it that, if someone goes missing on our property, no further inquiries are made. Imagine a search being launched in my forest—it'd be a bloodbath.

Even so, best not to risk anything. The corpse still needed to disappear. The easiest way to do that was to dump it in the lake. In case I haven't mentioned it before, the lake is located about a twenty minute walk from the red meadow in a lighter, less densely wooded area. It's twin lakes, actually, connected by a fierce old stream. I had the bigger one in mind, though. Drop something in there and it'll be gone in a flash. Fall in yourself and… oh well. It hasn't frozen over yet this year, so I decided to go for it right away.

I don't have a vehicle fit to transport a corpse through the woods, but I do have Jeanette. 

Jeanette is a mule. 

I got one of my workers who was hanging out at my family's house at the moment to bring her right over. We loaded her up and I got on my way. The woods were quiet, as per usual. Walking alone normally agrees with me, but hauling a corpse and a stubborn mule really put a damper on the mood. I tried to focus on the glittering snow beneath my boots and the many shiny icicles that made the forest resemble a stalactite cave—anything but the dead body bobbing up and down on the back of the animal beside me. We were getting on slower than I'd hoped. The wintry air was beginning to sting my bare shoulders. Seeing as I normally didn't mind it at all, that was saying something. 

Jeanette was being a drama queen. She always knows when I really need her help, and it's then that she's the most uncooperative. With the sun going down in the afternoon this time of year, darkness was already beginning to settle over the treetops. The water surface was still and undisturbed, covered partially by thin plates of ice. I surveyed the lake with bated breath. As peaceful as it looked, I knew how volatile a state this tranquility posed come nightfall. 

"Grandfather!" I called out into the darkness, trying to keep my voice down. Now, the creature I was hoping to rouse obviously isn't my actual grandfather; it's just a nickname he, the *vodyanoy*, goes by. I needed to talk to him to ask permission before laying the ill-fated explorer to rest in his waters. The lake stayed eerily quiet. "Grandfather!" I repeated, a little louder this time. I hated having to raise my voice. The woods prefer silence.

To my frustration, I received no response. The water remained an unblinking black mirror without so much as a single bubble rising to the surface. It didn't look as though Grandfather Vodyanoy was going to show up, which meant that I was being faced with a difficult decision. I really didn't want to stick around for anything that might have overheard me shouting to drop in. I would have to dump the cadaver without consulting the big boss. Against my better judgment, I dragged the body off my mule and rolled it towards the edge of the lake. Giving it one last powerful shove, it fell off the small ridge and disappeared with a satisfying *plop*. I imagined it rapidly sinking to the bottom, and a weight fell off my shoulders. I lingered for merely a minute, wallowing in my melancholy and wondering if the vodyanoy would be mad at me when he woke up to find I'd used his haunting grounds as garbage disposal.

That question would not go unanswered for long.

Just as I turned to leave, I heard a frantic, *enormous* splashing sound. Whirling around, I let out a yelp of surprise when I saw the creature rise from the murky depths. He was twice my size; an old, green-skinned man with a nightmarishly contorted face that resembled that of a catfish more than a human's. I staggered backwards as he started dragging himself up onto the dry land on his big paunch, his morbid, fleshy masses wrinkling and wriggling grotesquely. Algae hung in his long, tangled white hair and scales covered the lower part of his body which thinned into a fish tail.

I cursed myself for not waiting for him earlier. Perhaps he'd heard me, lingering just beneath the surface, expecting me to make a transgression he could justly punish me for. I could feel I was about to pay dearly for my impatience.

"Grandfather, I'm sorry!" I instantly cried out. "I was nervous; I had to be quick so I—"

He didn't answer, only letting out a gurgling laugh as he wrapped one of his webbed paws around my ankle, throwing me off balance. I landed on my ass in the dirt, blindly thrashing and kicking at his face, but before I knew it, he'd tugged me into a forceful embrace. Pressed up against his slick, saggy chest, I gagged at the foul odor he emitted. The slimy muck coating his skin rubbed off onto my face, arms and dress, instilling such a deep sense of disgust within me that I couldn't help but heave. Now soiled with my own vomit, I was pulled into the icy water. I was too shocked—physically as well as mentally—to fathom a single clear thought; all I could do was screech like a banshee. The vodyanoy let go of me, giving me a meaningful look before shoving me further out onto the lake. My dress bore me up, and I was sent gliding through the water.

"I do so despise impertinence," he called out to me, his voice equal parts rage-filled and amused. It was raspy, wet and blubbering, as though he was retching out water from his lungs with every word he said. "See you at the bottom." With that, he sank down, not causing a single splash.

Fuck. 

Mom had warned me never to stand too close to the water's edge. What the hell had I been thinking? 

I started swimming towards the ridge again, only to realize in horror just how difficult it was. My voluminous skirt was already soaked, its weight seemingly doubling mine. There was white all around me. My puffed sleeves had tightened, gripping my upper arms like chains. I was fighting against my own wedding dress and it quickly gained the upper hand. I was barely able to stay afloat, much less reach firm ground again; my head kept bobbing under—I couldn't keep it above the surface for long. Gasping for air, my rapid movements brought me closer and closer to exhaustion. Just as I was sinking down once more, I caught a glimpse of a menacingly tall silhouette looming over the lakeside. 

*"Quick, take my hand if you want to live!"*

The Leshy's voice cut through the water. I could hear it clearly even when submerged. Summoning my last bit of strength, I flung myself out of the water and reached for the monstrous, log-like arm he extended to me across the surface. It was long enough for me to climb it like an entire tree, but I was still too heavy—the dress dragged me under. I couldn't pull myself up. Sputtering and gasping for air, I dug my fingers into the Leshy's bark skin.

*"Shed your gown!"* the wood-demon commanded, urgency swinging along in his tone. *"Wench, it'll drown you!"*

"I can't!" I cried out. "Pull! Just pull, I'll hang on!"

He let out a growl, then abruptly drew back his arm, taking me along. Plowing through the freezing water, I felt a relief unlike anything I'd ever known. Once I was close enough, he grabbed me with both hands and lifted me out of the water, dropping me beside my mule. Jeanette had been standing beneath one of the old lakeside trees, resting up and not really minding my near death experience. Coughing up dirty cold water, I huffed and panted, trying to catch my breath while furiously rubbing my own upper arms to try and regain some semblance of feeling in my frozen skin. I didn't see the Leshy change form, being more occupied with myself at that moment; but when I looked up again, I found the bearded man with the cudgel standing over me.

"Why didn't you get out of your dress?" he asked testily. 

"I couldn't. It's hell to get into in the first place; you really think I can just pull down a zipper and it comes off?"

He looked almost annoyed. It was odd seeing him display such a human emotion. He caught himself though, straightening up and clearing his throat. "I hope you're aware you just caused me some trouble, potentially. The vodyanoy is the lord of this lake. He's unlikely to appreciate my intrusion."

"What are you getting at?"

He didn't respond right away. Instead, he gave me a long look, appraising me. "I'll tell you what, heiress. I'll see you home safely, so that you don't freeze to death… or get taken advantage of. All alone out here as you are. I will have saved you, and you are going to repay me."

The air felt even colder all of a sudden. I yearned for a dry, warm blanket to wrap around my shoulders, but my garments were drenched and more likely to freeze me into a statue. As much as it pained me to admit it, I needed his help. Dearly.

"I'll pay you back accordingly," I promised, pressing the words out between chattering teeth. "But I'd be willing to bet you already have something in mind."

"Right," he said. "Of course I do. And you *will* follow."

I sighed. "Yes, Sir. I will."
